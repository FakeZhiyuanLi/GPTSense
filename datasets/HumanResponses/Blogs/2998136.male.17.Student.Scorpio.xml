       By Hank C.K. Wuh, M.D., and Mei Mei Fox, from Lifetimetv.com    Add erotic eats to your diet.  Eating a balanced diet gives your body the raw material it needs to function at its peak, sexually and otherwise. Choosing healthful foods is good for your heart and, in turn, for your circulation, which benefits genital arousal, among other bodily functions. Try these sex-boosting snacks: Apricots have high levels of vitamin A and magnesium, which are reputed to contribute to fertility. Broccoli allegedly enhances sexual sensation because of its high vitamin A, C, B5 and niacin content. Potatoes contain vitamin B5, which is essential to sex hormone production.    Check out these sex-stimulating supplements:   Ginkgo biloba  optimizes sexual pleasure by relaxing muscles and increasing blood flow. Daily dose: 50 milligrams.  Ginseng  increases energy and stimulates sexual desire. Daily dose: 100 milligrams.  Kava kava  eases stress without the drowse-inducing side effects of sedatives. Daily dose: 60 milligrams.  Note: Consult your physician before taking any supplements.   Beware of these libido-stoppers.  Some prescription drugs, such as antidepressants, can interfere with sexual functioning. Talk to your doctor if you take medication on a regular basis, in particular, drugs such as antihypertensives, which can cause erectile and ejaculatory dysfunction in men as well as dampen desire in women; asthma meds, which can cause vaginal dryness; or birth-control pills, which can result in vaginal dryness and a lagging libido. Recreational drugs such as nicotine and alcohol -- and even caffeine -- can seriously compromise your sex life, especially when taken on a regular basis.    Arouse your senses every day.  Stimulating all of your senses with nonsexual massage, aromatic candles and even some fantasizing not only puts you in the mood for lovemaking, but can also rev up your physiology. Add these elements to your life, whether or not you have a partner.    Make exercise sexy.  Working out improves cardiovascular health, boosts energy, reduces stress and makes you feel good about yourself -- all of which can make you a better lover. Fitness fact: Exercise also triggers the release of endorphins, the same brain chemicals that are released when we fall in love.    Consider sleep essential.  It's easy to cut back on z's when life gets hectic. But the truth is, if you're not well rested, you won't have great sex. If you have trouble drifting off, avoid midday catnaps and caffeine pick-me-ups -- they interfere with your ability to establish a healthy snooze routine.    Banish stress from the bedroom.  Ironically, when we're stressed, we often don't make time for sex, despite the fact that sex is a great stress-reliever. Anxiety can decrease our ability to experience pleasure and can also shut down our libido, which is why it's important to integrate basic stress-reducing methods such as meditation, deep breathing, yoga or tai chi into your weekly routine.

      It's been ages since I update my blog. Firstly, I want to apologise to my blog for not feeding it for days and also to the readers out there who needs my inspiration from my nonsense.  Today it's a very surprising day for me in school, when I was walking to class, I turned my back and suddenly saw a ghost floating and had been following me behind me. Oh no, it was reading a pornography comic and it was my classmate who is trying to scare me by keeping silence in a broad-daylight out of everyone. Alright, I am not afraid of it. Then when we got into the lift, we were having kind of romantic atmosphere feeling for a while until we got out because there was only one light bulb working. I know this school wants to save electricity. Ok, I understand.  After school, I went to the library to do my proposal which is as long as my blog. The library plays very soothing and relaxing music over there which makes you very horny and the scenario is usually a sexy lady trying to seduce a man. You know I was trying hard to restrain myself from masturbating publicly in front of the surrounded cameras, but I think it's not worth it because the librarian could make a fortune selling porn video of me. I thought library should be a very decent place, nevermind I think it's trying to attract more people to the library. Not only they provide entertainment to the ear, also to your eyes. They even go to the extend of installing 3 TVs on the first floor, that's very inconsiderate of them. How can they expect us to have 3 eyes like the "Er Lang Shen" (a 3-eyed deity) to watch 3 screens at a time? And we also do not have 3 ears to listen 3 things at a time.  What's more? When I was doing my work half-way through, there was a guy's voice over the PA system saying that he's going to sing us a song. Oh my god, when did library becomes a KTV? So I waited a while, techno music started to blast out the whole library and I thought was I there to enjoy clubbing. Now the library became a disco in just a few seconds, so next time they are gonna install lighting effect and serve alcoholic beverage there.  That's all for my Monday today!

      (Assume you are a girl if you are a boy)  It's your first time. As you lie back your muscles tighten.  You put him off for a while searching for an excuse, but he refuses to be swayed as he approaches you. He asks if you're afraid and you shake your head bravely.  He has had more experience, but it's the first time his finger has found the right place. He probes deeply and you shiver; your body tenses; but he's gentle like he promised he'd be. He looks deeply within your eyes and tells you to trust him - he's done this many times before.  His cool smile relaxes you and you open wider to give him; more room for an easy entrance.You begin to plead and beg him to hurry, but he slowly takes his time, wanting to cause you as little pain as possible.  As he presses; closer, going deeper, you feel the tissue give way; pain surges throughout your body and you feel the slight trickle of blood as he continues. He looks at you concerned and asks you if it's too painful.Your eyes are filled with tears but you shake your head and nod for him to go on.  He begins going in and out with skill but you are now too numb to feel him within you. After a few moments, you feel something bursting within you and he pulls it out of you, you lay panting, glad to have it over. He looks at you and smiling warmly, tells you, with a chuckle; that you have been his most stubborn yet most rewarding experience.  You smile and thank your dentist. After all,it was your first time to have a tooth pulled.  Naughty, Naughty!  What were you thinking?  PERVERT  I know what you were thinking!

      Nowadays my tab-board has been seriously flooded and abused by some nuts. Obviously they must be my classmates. Think, who else would do that other than them? I have been keeping silent of it because I have things better to do than to debate with them. So now since I am in school and I have nothing better to do during this period, I shall write them a letter to pacify them and also soothe their heatiness with my consolation and sweet wording.    Dear MMT2J  crazy  women and men,  I know recently studies has been giving you  crazy  gals and guys a great amount of stress which derived all of you to be infatuated (meaning “To cause to behave foolishly”). I understand that you  crazy  guys have been undergoing perhaps hormone changes or menstruation that has causes you  crazy  guys to be immature at times. You  crazy  guys pretended sweet and innocent in front of me and take it as nothing had happened. That’s really good, this is what I call obedient patients from mental hospital. I know you  crazy  guys hated me after reading my blog.   But I wanted to strongly emphasize that while every effort has been made to prevent hurting people’s ego and reputation, I have no guarantee that it would offend you in one or any way. For goodwill, I greatly apologise to the characters involved.  Although my facts sound humiliation, but a fact is still a fact, you can’t change it. And what I am stating are purely facts and it’s supported with evidences and witnesses, I do not spread rumors around. So next time I shall attach photos, for example a picture of a girl being raped in my blog to prove I am correct.  I felt sorry in causing you  crazy  guys in this pathetic state, no I mean worsening. You guys are already in this sorry state before I started a blog. So that’s not my fault, and don’t worry I will quickly find a way to treat or cure to your terrible illnesses. In the meantime, please take note and good care of your health. Hope you  crazy  guys recover soon!  Your Lovable and Sweet Classmate, Lim Xing Yi   (This letter requires no signature as this is a computer-generated letter)

      Just read  urlLink keito's blog  and feel like blogging right now. It's such a small world, didn't know he is my dance instructor's friend until I found out that he gotten the Path Fiesta whole family photo (Quan Jia Fu) in his blog. I know my han yi pin yin not that good, but at least I could spell. Hehe, afterall my mandarin is not that bad. To be frank, I realised his blog to be either too long-winded or too short. Kind of unbalance, anyway I am too lazy to read everything on his blog. (Actually I am jealous of his English)       That's the family photo Keito stolen to put in his blog.    It's late now and why am I still staying awake. Because I am too scared to sleep, I watched "Resident Evil" at 10. Followed by watching "Huanting over America" half-way through because it was too frightening for a innocent kid like me. So I browsed throught other channels and stopped at Kids Central. Opps, there's no Kids Central at night. It should be Art Central, it was showing a Japanese cartoon. In the scene, I saw many guys covered in all white suits grabbing the struggling girl trying to escape. Then I don't know how did the girl suddenly got so much strength to resist and managed to free herself. So she ran at a fast speed and knock her head against the wall. During that time, question marks (??? -_- ???) were all over my head. I thought to myself, why is this girl so stupid? Is she dumb or nutcase? Or perhaps that's an accident, she ran so fast that she couldn't break in time.   If that's commit-suicide, it's a very interesting method to die. Normally in any drama or movie, the person will just stand in front of the wall and bump his head against the wall several times. Back here, the guy declared that this girl broke a record of shuttle run if I am not wrong with the timing of 7.1 secs if I am not wrong again. I think she also broke the record of being the first person to die athletically in such an amazing way.  Ok that's only just a cartoon and cartoon can die anyway they want. Enough of that crap, it's Saturday now and I still have not completed my school project. Time flies. Why does time flies and not crawls? Time always flies when I am having fun and crawls when I am bored. I am addicted to blogging and I spent more time blogging than my project. My deadline for the proposal is over, and the next deadline for my Flash project is next Tuesday.   I am going to do a shuttle-run and crash my head against the monitor. *Ouch* It hurts! *Fainted nicely onto the bed with head laying on the pillow and arms hugging the bolster*

      For your eye candy, here's a few photo of us during the event:                                            Thanks Ada for sending those photos to me! If you are curious to know who is Ada, she is the yellow body-painted species.

              There is a test paper which has a score of 100/100 full mark and an excellent remark there in the advertisement display. So eating Yoshinoya will score you full marks in test. I will eat more often then.     Does the poster means that the chickens cooked are gay or eating the chicken will convert one into a gay? If this is so, it would be a great way to become a gay immediately.

        For the past 2 days I have been scanning my PC for viruses like hell, it had dramatically slow down my internet connection. I felt like throwing down the whole damn PC off from the window, I think twice about it and I was not concern about injuring the people below, I am scared that my dad won’t buy me another PC. I was like a mad computer whiz till today, I done numerous online scan, use Norton to scan umpteen times, I downloaded a few spyware remover. And those detected over 100 viruses, script viruses, Trojan Horse and spyware. You name it, I have it. Now everything is back to normal, I told you I am a computer whiz.  Now I have regained my internet connection, a company keeps on sending spam message to me begging me to get a diploma. The message said you need not study and take tests or exams to obtain the diploma. What the hell is this! It’s asking me to buy a piece of paper, fake certificate. I could just block the spam but I want to know how many times it can send me in a day.  Below is how the message looks like:       You know I felt like dying without Internet for the past few days, I can’t live without it. I thought of committing-suicide by hugging my monitor and CPU together and jumped off from the building. That would make me the first person in the world to die with a computer. I simply have so many nonsense to blog, I need to type rubbish out of my hand at least a day. Now my blog is  very hungry and I am going to feed it with rubbish so that its stomach won't be rumbling so badly.

        Recently my class organised a class chalet to be held today till this Wednesday, guess who's the organiser?  It's those crazy gals in my class and you are right, I am not going to the chalet. It costs around $25 and I am very poor to even fork out a dollar. Another reason is that we have a Flash project on hand to be done during the holidays. So I would rather make full use of this 3 days 2 nights staying at home even if I were to play WarCraft 3, I think it's far more better than having to suffer havoc and disaster there.  I know I am just being anti-social as well as sarcastic, I didn't mean to. It's good that those crazy gals organised a chalet because this is where they will be able to release their madness, craziness and also horniness. Take that chalet as an escape resort or a mental hospital to be exact, nobody will care, they can do whatever they like, running and jumping about, screaming and shouting, touching each other and molesting one another at a time, or even group raping on a broad-daylight. Well, I must not let them read my blog or I will be dead meat when school reopens.  Since I am not going for the chalet, that does not mean I miss the opportunity to stuff myself with those foods. Anyway their BBQ skill sucks and scientists had proven female BBQ skill is lousier than male. Tell you what, my mum is going to bring me to a wedding dinner tonight and those are what I called delicacies which is much more superior than those sausages, fish balls, artificial crab-sticks and chicken wings. Mine is gonna be shark fins, abalone, steam fish, roasted chicken/pig/duck, etc… At least I won’t have to smell and eat charcoal.  Poor those innocents who are going for the class chalet. I bet it must have been a bad hair day for them.

            Stolen from Keito's blog. Thank you!    Last month I was involved in the Art Fista organised by Path Production, which is the company my school modern dance instructor is working in. It was a Friday to Sunday event at the Istana Park. Guess what? I am to be body-painted the whole day throughout the whole event, not only I have to perform on stage, I have to walk around orchard as a pathetic and miserable statue giving out balloons which always fly off from the stick.  But I don't mind anyway because there will be free hair-styling and futhermore they dye your hair. So I thought I could give it a try and performing for the event would earn me high CCA points and CIP hours. Our  sponsor is Jean Yip Group and they will be playing around with our hairs, my theme colour chosen is gold. They ran out of this colour and they dyed my hair brown. I am the only statue with brown hair and I love my hairstyle so much I wouldn't want to wash off when I reached home. It was way too cool, I bet I will never admire other guys' hairstyle unless it's done by Jean Jip. They are so professional.  On Saturday and Sunday, I went about scaring and frightening kids away at Heerens and Plaza Singapure before I could give them balloons. A few passer-bys were being busybody and took a few photos of us to report to the police or sue us to the court for scaring kids away. We were gone by then when the police arrived. When we were walking along Orchard, many people stared at us as if we were aliens from outter space doing window-shopping in Singapore and they stayed a distance away from us as if we are contracted from SARS.  Now if you were at there during that time spotted a few statues and had shoot a few pictures of statues even if that's not me, please send the picture to me at  urlLink xing_yi@kon-x.com . I would like to collect them, thank you!

        I had broke a new record in my life, surfing up to 100+ porn sites within a minute. All thanks to reading my classmate's blog, Melanie. You can check out her blog under the Friend's Blog section and make sure you do not right-click on her blog, because you will get a message telling you to eat her shit and when you click Ok because there's only Ok button, tons of Windows popping up which makes you busy doing hand exercise.  Lucky for me, I am a computer whiz so I managed to terminate the code from running. Everything was back to normal and I messaged Melanie in MSN.   Here's our conversation:  ﭏĩлğ Ỹї - http://limxingyi.blogspot.com/ says: Wah liao..... your blog got so many porn site...... u make me wanna... says: wahahhahahah whu call u ryte click huh? u make me wanna... says: hUH? u make me wanna... says: wahahahahahahah u make me wanna... says: coopy ryte u make me wanna... says: f**ker ﭏĩлğ Ỹї - http://limxingyi.blogspot.com/ says: See your source code also got wrong ar.... ﭏĩлğ Ỹї - http://limxingyi.blogspot.com/ says: Didn't know you are such a bad gal u make me wanna... says: yap u make me wanna... says: yayaya nw den u noe u make me wanna... says: u too weak ﭏĩлğ Ỹї - http://limxingyi.blogspot.com/ says: Nvm lor.... next time don't give you things liao..... ﭏĩлğ Ỹї - http://limxingyi.blogspot.com/ says: :P u make me wanna... says: hmmmermmmhnmdijfcn o u make me wanna... says: dun like tt la u make me wanna... says: i treat u spp gd u make me wanna... says: i ur gf leh u make me wanna... says: =[ ﭏĩлğ Ỹї is bathing - http://limxingyi.blogspot.com/ says: ......... "-_-"" .......    Back to here, she claimed she is my girlfriend but I am not her boyfriend. You know I am sick and tired of hearing her sprouting "Xing Yi, Wo Ai Ni (I love you)" out of the blue in Mandarin. It chills my spine whenever I heard it, and sometimes she come over and flirt around on me until I was chilled so badly, I couldn't move.  You might ask "Why don't I be her boyfriend?", "Is she very ugly?" or "Is she very fat?", "Is she very smelly?" or "Is she blah blah blah....". Ok, I will let you take a look at her picture below.     Then you might still ask "She's so pretty, then why you don't want to be her boyfriend?"  Because I do not fit her, we are impossible and she could find someone else far more better than me. (Hehe, I learnt this from Channel 8 drama). She should go after those who are handsome, good-looking, dashing, hunky and loaded to go with her beauty look.  So in order to dishearten her, I acted gay and I pretend to take interest in all the hunks in the sch. Despite knowing I am a gay, she still likes me. Oh man, how am I going to shake her off? Tell me.

        I am currently taking a course in Multimedia Technology, not sexual intercourse at  urlLink ITE MacPherson , if you do not know what's ITE. It stands for It's The End and MacPherson is pronounced as "Mad Person". So when you combine those words together, it becomes "It's The End Mad Person". Yeah, it's the end for me studying in this school.  And there really is a mad person in our school who likes going around shouting "Hoo...." to anyone he picked up randomly, I think he's been surfing too much Yahoo. He's so famous that almost all students know him even the toilet cleaners. His favorite hangout is at the school library, and his favorite cartoon is Pokemon. Because of that, we have to accompany him watching Pokemon. Really, I am speaking of facts here. I don't fabricate lies as Xiexue usually does. You can ask any student in my school, they will tell you.  Enough of that, I am gonna tell you what I had learnt in my course, as the name implies, this course deals with everything got to do with Multimedia, in the first year, they taught me how to design a pornographic webpage and then host it on the Internet. This year they are gonna teach me using Flash to do pornographic animated website and then shoot a few porn video and do some video-editing.  This is pretty cool, huh? But I got a B for my Internet Fundamental last semester, perhaps my site lacks of obscene photos and hence not erotic enough to arouse the teacher. Well, this time I am gonna do it better.  Every now and then, I have been thinking how misfortunate I am to be in MMT2J, a class full of insane girls and nuts. Imagine there's a high pitch scream out of a sudden and you thought a girl was being raped, but she was molested by another same species. Yes, lesbians rule the class.  This leads me to suspect Xiaxue is also a lesbian, because she's so highly sex-minded. She even designed her own pornographic website, which my classmates and I visited in school. Don't get me wrong, it's because she claimed that it's not pornographic so I thought I could just check it out anyway. Never did I know she will resort to this "Bu Zhe Shou Duan" (a Chinese idiom describing a person using despicable ways and means to accomplish their goal) method to increase the hits on her website. What a SIN to make use of human nature and weakness! She deserves to be executed.  Ok, that's all of my school life I will write for now. *Phew*

        Finally, this is my very first blog I setup today on the 13 March 2004 because I personally think it's a special day. Because 13 is an unlucky number and it falls on a Saturday instead of Friday and that makes a very lucky day instead. I have long been wanting to setup a blog due to its growing popularity nowadays.  Xiaxue is the one who inspires me to own a blog, and so far she is also one of the most lamest person among the bloggers. She is such a poor hypocrite and a grandmother storyteller. She can't lie properly and can't act well just like William Hung can't sing and dance. Just in case you don't know who she is, you can visit her blog at  urlLink www.xiaxue.blogspot.com .  Alright back to me, another reason for me to blog is that recently my life is full of misfortunes and accident...  I wanna write down my illusions and wild thoughts here to share with you guys how interesting and meaningful my life really is, that you will even dream of me every night, or should I say have more nightmare. See, I am a hyper-active boy who loves to grow roots at home and anti-socialise with others at outside. I keep everything to myself (I know I am Greedy!) and only tell my blog every mishap that had been occurring in my life.  Well, stay tune with my blog and I will do even better than that daughter of the bitch Xiaxue.

      “Die, die, die, Xing Yi. I want you die” is what all my classmates’ been thinking every now and then. They wanted me to die so badly and they are waiting for me to surrender myself…. I can hear their laughter in my mind like “Ha ha ha ha ha, you are going to die Xing Yi!” The another one goes like this “Xing Yi, I want you to die… die ……die…..die…..die….. DIE DIE DIE DIE DIE DIE….. HAHAHAHAHA!”  I dreamt about them one night, they slowly surrounded me in a circle where I was in the middle… one of them said “You have nowhere to escape…. You should die…..” Then everyone started chanting “Yes! You are going to die….. Xing Yi should die, Xing Yi should die, Xing Yi should die, Xing Yi should die, Xing Yi should die, Xing Yi should die…..” I then shouted back “NO~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~”. This went on over and over throughout the whole dream until their mouth became tired and thirsty…. One by one just knock down… Then here comes the Energizer battery, which ran out of nowhere and advertises itself with the slogan “Never say die” to my classmates. I was at ease that moment because at last someone or I should say something came up to them and helped me speak up. After this, I woke up from my sweet dream.   Why they want me to die? Because they are too jealous of my schoolwork. I had purposely handed up all my assignments late and they still don’t let me off. There was this girl that keeps on encouraging teacher to deduct my mark in class, another guy try to pursue me not to do the same topic of the assignment as him, a close classmate of mine is even smarter, trying to bribe me for doing his assignment for him.  They are now combining force to find ways and means to bring me down even if that is to resort to underhand methods because they know I pose a bigger threat to them in class. I am fine with it, I know they always put on a fake smile in front of me trying to be kind to me.   Will be continued…..

       I fall into category 1, The Originator. It's quite true and accurate, most of all I love being flattered!  My birth date: October 30, 1986   10 + 30 + 1986 = 2026   2 + 0 + 2 + 6 = 10   1 + 0 = 1    Birth Test   Let me know your number.  Once you have  discovered your Birth Number, forward this e- mail to the rest of your friends, including the  one who sent this to you. Put your "number" in  the "Subject" and Pass it on! Have fun!   Your birth date describes who we are, what we  are good at and what our inborn abilities are.   It also points to what we have to learn and the  challenges we are facing.   To figure out your Birth Number, add all the  numbers in the birth date together, like in the  example, until there is only one digit.  A Birth  Number does not prevent you from being anything  you want to be, it will just color your choice  differently and give you a little insight.   Example March 20, 1950   3 + 20 + 1950 = 1973   1 + 9 + 7 + 3 = 20   2 + 0 = 2   2 is the Birth Number to read for the birth date  in the example.   #1 THE ORIGINATOR   #2 THE PEACEMAKER   #3 THE LIFE OF THE PARTY   #4 THE CONSERVATIVE   #5 THE NONCONFORMIST   #6 THE ROMANTIC   #7 THE INTELLECTUAL   #8 THE BIG SHOT   #9 THE PERFORMER   ================================================= ==========    # 1 - THE ORIGINATOR   1 's are originals.

      How many times I have been complaint by my classmates and friends that I always either put Busy or Away on MSN Messenger? Ok, I admit it but not most of the time recently. I denied to them, "Not always but sometimes", and they argued back "No leh, always online or everytime see you put away or busy.". Ok, that's what I was well-known for regularly putting away in the past and I had been named as "Away King".  Another absurd line from one of my classmates said "You very hardworking leh, always see you online you put "Busy". Yeah, I was busy playing games. I replied back. Ok, I know you guys are human, obviously is human. Then what, animal or ghost? I understand human tend to make assumption and impression in their mind. To them, their impression of me is the one who goes online most of his time and then putting away or busy in MSN when actually sometimes he is at the computer.  Let me tell you guys, I am a human too and you should understand human sometimes tend to be lazy. If you don't get what I mean, I better get straight to the point. I am just simply too lazy to even move my hand a few centimetres to set off the away or busy. Are you convinced now? I think you guys should try to study more on me and perhaps even do a research on me so as to know and understand me better as what I have done to you guys.  You guys didn't know that "ni shen zai fu zhong bu zi fu" (Living in comfort, without knowing how fortunate you are). Haha, my English translation from a Mandarin proverb isn't that bad right? Anyway, that's not the main point. I want you guys to know you are so lucky and thankful to have me as your classmate who secretly study on you all the while.  So you guys know what to do? :P I don't request for much, each of you just take turn to give me a big treat for lunch everyday in school, be it McDonalds, KFC, Delifrance or Long John Silver. There's 36 of you guys excluding me right, so each of you will only need to treat me at least once a month and I can have my free lunch all year round. Isn't that smart? *Wink* ;-)  To avoid and prevent this case from happening again, I swore I will never put any status on my MSN except "Offline" so you guys will have nothing to complain.

      I shot Song Chuan in the back through the heart less than an hour ago. I watched him writhe in pain upon the floor in a pool of his own blood. The expression on his face was positively exquisite. He died with his eyes wide open, staring up at me. It was beautiful.

         Visit a gym on any given day, and you'll find both guys and gals working their abs with fury and commitment. The problem is, they're often doing it wrong. Foolishly wrong. Wate-of-time wrong.  The best way to a flat stomache is through your brain. Here are 4 bug myths about Six-Pack Abs.   MYTH 1:   Abdominal muscle is different from regular muscle. Ab muscle is ab muscle. Period. Like your quads, your biceps.   There's no structural difference, no psychological difference, no difference in how ab muscle conracts and how it gets stronger.  "The abdominals are different only in location" explains an exercise physiologist. "They are not resting on a body surface, like the biceps or quads. Instead, they span like a bridge over a cavern. Look at any anatomy book. But that doesn't change basic physiology or law of scince."    MYTH 2:   You have to train abs at least every other day.   Train them, at most, every other day to leave time for recovery, justlike any other muscle group, say an instructor of personal trainers.  "You abs cab get strong and stay strong with twice a week workouts," he suggests, but you have to train them hard enough.  The key is to choose an exercise that fatique the muscle, so that they need recovery time to get stronger. Add some exercises that use the abs functionally - in other words, the way you are used in real life.  For example, abdominals are used to stabilise your body. Feel this function by holding a push-up position without letting your belly sag. Don't do the push-ups - just keep holding the position and feel your abs going crazy to stabilise your body. If that's easy, put your feet on a weight bench, or even better, a stability ball. Now, you'll really feel your abs.    MYTH 3:   Ab exercises melt away abdominal fat.  Spot reducing has been disproved over and over again, but this persists. "You can't get rid of fat by repeatedly exercing one body part."  Chew gum - you won't get skinny cheeks. Do crunches in the best form - you won't whittle your waistline or belly. You may develop abs of steel, but they'll still be covered by fat if you don't do cardio to reduce it.  "Doing ab exercises for reducing waistline is a fool's errand. Reducing waistline has to do with reducing body fat." Burning abdominal fat the same as burning fat anywhere on your body: You have to do aerobic exercise and of course, restrict your caloric intake. "Your diet and large-muscle activity will accomplish much more than 1, 000 sit-ups a day." says expert.     MYTH 4:   High numbers of repetitions are required to make gains.  Let's say you want to work your biceps. Would you do 100 concentration with a 25lb weight? Making abdominal gains follow the principle : overload.   The reason we think we have to do so many reps is that we're not working them hard enough.

      I don't know what to do, recently at ITE Tampines I felt there's a girl hinting me something or what. I am truly surprised when she asked me this personal question when we were the only 2 in the lab.  The girl: "Xing Yi, do you have girlfriend?" Me: "Don't have..." The girl: "Why don't have, why don't you go find one?"  Then when I am going to reply, a voice burst out of a sudden from those guys coming into the lab. On that day, I sense something is quite amiss, because she is like trying to be close to me and somehow being sweet too. I can feel that the way she treat me and the others were totally different, I always have this kind of suspicious feeling whenever she talks to me.  No matter what, I am quite happy though if someone likes me, but how am I going to rejert her if one day she expressed her love towards me? Sometimes, I am contradict. I would like people to like me, but yet I can't allow myself belong to people.  I am not sure whether if this girl has a liking on me.... but I have listed down a few reasons that she might be.  1) She ask me this personal question out of a sudden when we are not even close friend or we are not having a conversation.  2) She treat me extremely different from the rest.  3) She find opportunity to get close to me. (I can tell that)  Therefore, there is a 50% chance of her has taken a liking on me.  I shall not dwell on this anymore, exam is coming. I should concentrate on my studies first and finish whatever unfinished work.  And 1 Melanie is enough to disrupt my life, I hope there's no more addition to it. But I think this girl is far much more better than Melanie because she's much more gentle and refine. Not like Melanie, so rough and so vulgar. Hahaha....

      Today in the school canteen, I had Mee Soto for my lunch. It's the usual yellow small-sized bowl which is just enough to fill my stomach, but today's Mee Soto is quite plain. I understand perhaps is because of the incident which happened yesterday, that has caused the auntie to be emotionless. I then came up with this theory, when someone is feeling down, the food they cooked will be awful to eat. That means their cooking skill will be greatly affected.  Even though having chilli added makes no difference to the Mee Soto... or is it my tastebud.  I can't tell what had exactly happened, I heard it, I felt it, but I couldn't tell how terrifying it was.  Something was already amiss in the past, it was not right, I should have knew it... but all is already too late. It can never be undone nor it can be forgotten, forgiveness it might be but unlikely.  Things are not going to be the same again, it can never go back to the past. Everything has changed from time to time, but the history will always remain. Nobody knows what will happen next, one thing for sure, anything can happen just in a second. It's just a matter of time, sooner or later everyone will know. What seems untrue can become a fact and a fact can never be changed to a tale.  It's the reality that controls our fate, not the virtual. Think before you regret, because you will never know the future that lies ahead beyond us...

         You spot a Matt Dillon look-alike across the room ans start to wonder just how good he'd be between the sheets. Your biggest physical tip-off?   (a)  HIS HEIGHT . The taller he stands, the bigger his little man.   (b)  HIS HANDS . The relative size of his fingers reveals that he's potentially a sexual winner.   (c)  HIS BUTT . The perkier his rear, the more skillfully he can steer.   The answer is (b): Men whose ring finger is longer than their index are especially fertile and frisky, according to a recent study. "  Such men tend to have higher levels of testosterone and produce more sperm than men with shorter ring fingers,  " says study author John Manning,Ph.D., a researcher at the University of Liverpool, in England.   Why the weird link?   The same genes that tell the finger to grow in utero also direct the growth of his family jewels:   Larger testicles produce more testosterone and more testosterone increases sperm production   - and jacks up his libido.   Other tip-offs? Check out the length of his index finger when he makes a gun with his hand:   The distance between the thumb-finger crease and his fingertip roughly correlates to the length of his mighty   (or not so mighty) member, according to research from Boston University.   Guys, after reading this, never anyhow point your fingers in the public again, you either get wow or boooooo .... before you take your risk, check it out at home first.

      In this new century and modern society, where everyone becomes more smarter and physically nicer.... as in looks and figures. Most of them is self-consciences of beauty and tend to try ways and means to touch up themselves to the utmost style. Just to attract a few seconds of glance from others, they would be contented enough.  The major problem is, uglyness will be overwhelmed by beautiness in the near future, as I have said earlier, increasing more people becomes good-looking. Which also means fewer people will be ugly and they might be discriminated and despised by the good-looking ones. Although they are taught in school not to think of this way, they would eventually make a barrier in their mind. Human nature has this tendency, which is inevitable.  I have sent my photos to countless strangers over the IRC and they have quite a few interesting comments on my looks. I shall not disclose it anyway because it's embarassing. Look, the ugly people would feel the same embarassment as I would do if they go out on town. They would definitely cover their face and bush in shyness because everyone is staring at them and laughing. Just like a person wearing a singlet with shorts and slippers to a wedding dinner. They would immediately be in the center of attraction in no time by the cool and stylish crowds. And it's not a norm to be ugly anymore.  Not only that, they also suffer for not being themselves. They have to do hairstyling and make-up before stepping out of the house. They are simply being dominated and manipulated.  Another problem arises is the balance of the university, if almost everyone in this world is good-looking, there's no balance and it affects everything aroound such as there would be high chances of people getting AIDs and result in increasingly over-crowded population matter. Let me explain that in more details, people will have sex with numerous various kind of partners because they have no difficulty in finding their ideal partner and that which in turn, results in more unwanted babies born. You will see people flirting all the time, it can be in school, office, clinic, hospital, restaurants and etc.... Imagine this... more people die at early ages because of AIDs, more babies infected with AIDs. Soon 9 out of 10 people are AIDs patients, economy fall in crisis and riots everywhere.  There will still be many more problems that will arise sooner or later if this is not fix immediately at the early stage, this is something to be taken quite seriously and carefully. So my advice is better put the action into an end and save the world from destruction.   Please stop making-up and hairstyling yourself to look beautiful and good-looking from now onwards, everyone plays a part in contributing to a better society.  Just remember what I have told you.

       Date:   Fri, 7 May 2004 16:44:54 +0200   From:   "Engr. James Ali."     Reply-to:   engrjamesali@mynetaddress.com   Subject:  Confidant   TREASURY /PAYMENT INVESTIGATION DEPARTMENT CENTRAL BANK OF NIGERIA NATIONAL HEADQUARTERS, AREA 1, ABUJA, NIGERIA  Phone: +234-803-3262345.  OUR REF: FGN/CBN/TPID/DATA/XXVOL1.2004   Hello Dear,  REF: CLAIMING A NEGLECTED FUNDS   I am the Information and Data analyst of the Treasury/Payment Investigation Department of the Central Bank of Nigeria.In the process ofcross  checking payment files inherited from previous head of this department I realized a particular payment file with series of complicated abnormal entries of a beneficiary who had made efforts towards getting the funds but to no avail; I then decided to investigate the genesis of the difficulties /hitches to the release of the said funds. I found out these:  There is NO PAYMENT STATUS on the file and on our payment computer columnas a result of mistake, I believe to have been made by the secretary who filed the particulars (DATA) i.e Bank particulars and payment reference as it was fixed in by the side column of another payment file as if the reference is not the principal benefactor of the money which effort were been made to claim it s fund.  The reference name did not appear at the foreign payment list but went and appear at the Banks domestic payment network, which is abnormal, because its fund is a foreign payment!  No fund claim certificate was issued to the reference for claim of entitled payment as constituted in our constitution for principal foreign benefactors to claim their estate benefits or contract payments without hitch.  I have decided to contact you through this medium because in my further investigation I found out that this claim is genuine with all legal backings apart from the above data irregularities and complications which made the beneficiary to gave up the claim. Therefore, I've withdrawn my submission paper for conversion of the funds to the CBN Treasury, which several payments have suffered because of irregularities since the implementation of the ICPC -Independent Corrupt Practices Commission Act.This assurance gave me courage to link you up for this particular transaction knowing it will be of mutual benefit to both of us.  Requirement: I want you to lay claim to this money as the principal benefactor, I will require from you your Bank account details ( newly opened bank account preferably for clarity)that will accommodate this total sum of USD12.5Million.I willl get the above complications corrected with your personal information as will be submitted by you.On reflecting this in the payment computer system, I will advise you on the application letter you will fax to this Departmentfor the release of the said funds.Sharing ration, 60% for me and 40% for you.I can assure you after the corrections and the application within 72hours the fund must be in your designated account.There is no single riskat all as it's quite clear to you that the Payment InvestigationDepartment of every Bank supersedes fund release at all level moreso I am the only person entitled to all payment data analysis and information.  I will oblige you with further information and please I need your privatetelephone /facsimile number for easy and confidential communication.Reply to:engrjamesali@yahoo.co.uk  ENGR. JAMES ALI.

      One late evening, there was this person, let's call this person "Sweet". Sweet was waiting patiently for a person (let's name this person "Chocolate") at a certain MRT station in Singapore. Chocolate sent Sweet an SMS stating that Chocolate will be late so Sweet waited for around 15 to 20 minutes. They always been wanted to meet up each other since long time ago, the story goes like this. Back then, they get to know each other in IRC. Sweet was fascinated by Chocolate's nickname,  Sweet then first private message Chocolate. And from there, they got each other MSN's contact, self-photo, etc...  From that time onwards, they have been chatting in MSN for almost 8 months. During those days, they had so far chatted on the phone for 3 to 4 times before only. What was keeping them hestitate to meet is because Sweet was busy of school stuff, so they never really got the chance to meet until the June's vacation. One day, Sweet initiated to meet up with Chocolate for a simple dinner in a shopping mall.  During the first time meeting, Sweet was playing game on the handphone when Chocolate approached. After a few talks, they proceeded into the mall. They weren't sure of what activity they can do, as Sweet had already eaten at home and Chocolate had a few bite in school already. So they just walked around and window-shopped while on the way talking about fashion, music and even food.  After finished going through all the stores, Chocolate suggested to Sweet whether if Sweet wants to go to the nearby park. Without much thinking, Sweet agreed since they were not feeling hungry. In the park, the lighting were dull and romantic. They took a stroll to the shelter and sitted on the bench, the shelter was bright and Chcolate was trying to sit intimately near to Sweet, who was feeling being squeezed. Sweet thought it would be polite just to slant to the left for more space instead of body contacting towards Chocolate. They both then started chatting, it was very silence as the chat was not continously non-stop, there were a few pauses which held up a few seconds to a minute. Both of them did not know what to chat, they were trying to break the "ice" so they asked and talked about their school stuff. The "ice" in Sweet was indeed very hard and tough to break for Chocolate. Chocolate tried to touch Sweet by holding Sweet's hand up, commented that Sweet had such long fingernails.  In the mean time, Sweet knew that Chocolate wanted to intimate with Sweet. Then they started to hanky panky around and occasionally joking in the conversation, one thing Sweet will never forget is that Chocolate always picked the pest, insects or whatever dirt away from Sweet's t-shirt. Sweet said to Chocolate he was like a monkey helping their fellow to pick away the lices. Till late, Sweet started to feel tired and requested Chocolate to lend Chocolate's shoulder for Sweet to lie Sweet's head on it. But during that time, Sweet was worried people might see. However Sweet didn't care much as Sweet don't want to miss the opportunity to lie on Chocolate's shoulder. Sweet had never felt so comfortable lying on a person's body, they went quiet just to enjoy the moment.  After that, Chocolate kept glaring directly on Sweet's face, it made Sweet shy and Sweet just turned away after a while. This was the time Chocolate made the first move, he initiatively asked whether if Chocolate can kiss Sweet. Without much hestitation, Sweet replied yes and said "Before that, which part are you going to kiss?". Chocolate wouldn't dare replied and replied sweet with a question "You guess?", Sweet then guessed it was the lips and bingo! So Chocolate asked if Chocolate can kiss and Sweet allowed.  But never did Sweet know, it wasn't a peck(To kiss briefly and casually). It was a French kiss that Chocolate gave, this was the first time Sweet received such a kiss. Sweet was kind of surprised. Sweet interrupted the few seconds of kiss into a hug. Eventually, they realised it was quite late already so Chocolate gave Sweet one last deep kiss again before they leave. Soon after, they returned home. Sweet by MRT and Chocolate by bus.  Finally they managed to get rid of the "ice", not by breaking it. It was by melting it, which Chocolate had succeeded by melting Sweet's heart with his romantic surprise.

      These neoprints were taken in Heeren, this was the first meeting after so many years of lost contact. Look at them, they are all "chiobus" (pretty girls). I felt like a thorn among the roses as I was the only guy being just an "extra" behind them.          I hate the red ears on my head! It's so ugly and I am not micky mouse.

      Today I would consider my luck average, neither good nor bad. My dad failed to wake me up at 9 am plus to let me have the time to go supermarket to buy bread and prepare breakfast to Sentosa. Time was running out and the lift was like taking its own sweet time from the 12th storey to get down to 5th storey. In the supermarket, there were long queues and I had to wait.  After the preparation, I met my friend at Woodlands MRT station Control Room. On the way rushing up to the escalators to catch the train, I tripped over the steps. And what happened? Instead of me falling backward and roll down the steps, I had to climb up the steps a few times in order to fall forward. In the process, my right leg was in friction with the rough edge of the steps and there, I got a vampire's fang mark. It's quite long and my blood was dark red. *Sighted* I shouldn't have sracificed myself just to be in time.  When we were in Sentosa's beach, it was indeed an eye-opener to see so many HUNKS! Some playing balls, some sun-tanning, some just chill out. I just got distracted by them the whole day, I couldn't help looking at their nice-bod, their complexion and as well as their cute looks. Wow, it makes me feel so "gay". Actually I am just very envy of them, I wish I could have their look, their figure, their size. Opps... I mean their body size. Look at their developed parts and you will get what I mean. In the mean time, I also felt inferior. I just wish I do possess everything of them. So I just make a pact with myself to try to reduce fats in my body and develope my muscle into good shape. At least they aspired and inspired me to be one of them...  I saw 3 very cute Japanese beach stud walking past, they are my cup of tea. Unlike those "ang moh", body is so big size and not quite proportional. After soaking in the water for long enough, I got down to the shower room. I saw a reflection from the mirror of an old man changing his swimming trunk to underwear, it was unsightful the first thing I stepped into the room. But who cares, I am not interested. Wahahaha.  I proceeded to enter one of the shower cubicle, there's no shower head installed and one long tude of water just flowed out. I am not used to it so I go out and changed to antoher cubicle, this time there is shower head but the water is quite small and there was no lock. So I got out again and went to another side of the cubicles. I was so fussy and particular about it, and ended up people went into the cubicles and I had to wait. While waiting, I went to another side of the cubicle and I saw people waiting outside. Then a few moment later, I went to see again and nobody's waiting outside. I walked past every cubicle and I was rewarded with a good show. Guess what? A naked man was showering without the door closed! Oh my god... this was sexually arousing. I even captured the moment he rubbed his body in my memory. His butt is also tanned but not as dark as his body complexion. Laugh out loud, it was just within 3 seconds glance and I can gain a lot of information. Amazing. ;)  I then told my friend about it and he went to see. How curious he was! I told him because I want to warn him about it. Not to encourage him to see it. Nevermind then. I then went there again and I saw the guy's "thing"! Luckily he didn't notice me, he was wearing his underwear that time. I was trumatised by his "incredibly" huge thing... it's making me very envy of him. I know he has this very "big" thing, but there's no need to show it off in public like this. But anyway, I enjoyed watching it. Wahahaa... too bad I don't have camera with me. So I can post it here for you guys to see... Hahaha. *Kidding*  So that's how my Sentosa's experience with a unforgetable memories and beautiful ending.

      Today I went to Orchard with my 3 close classmates. They are really truely a good pal to have, accompanying me the whole day till around 8pm. Before shopping, we went to have lunch at McDonalds. It's been almost 3 weeks since I ever had fast food. My stomach was feeling uneasy, my suspiscion is that coke float in my set meal. Sundae on coke doesn't goes well in my system I guess. After chit-chatting there for an hour or so, we were at the Orchard library. I borrowed some cookery and computer books, however they were just there waiting for me. How loyal they are!  Being stucked inside Ngee Ann City for hours, I decided we should get the hell out of there and take a fresh breath of air and also expose to the sunlight. It's good to see the sight of Orchard Road after living in Cambodia for 18 days. We then proceed to Heeren, one of my favourite hangout to enjoy the eye candy of those stylish people from all "range" (from gay, hip-hopper, ah beng, ah lian, nerd, stud, etc).  I am thinking of buying myself a jeans, and maybe perhaps a clothe or more. Afterall, it's Great Singapore Sales! Why not strike while the iron is hot! I have eyed on a few items, but I did not specially bring enough cash for those. I just want to buy everything at one go, so you need not have to carry those things around while you are selecting.  I saw a few new arrival necklace which originally cost $9.90, priced at $5 only. I bought a Scorpion necklace, what people might think of me? A "pai kia" or what?  I just heck care, I just like it and see no wrong in wearing it. But the problem is I looked so "guai", will I be a laughing stock if I wear it?  After that, we went to arcade and they saw me playing DDR. Feel quite bad having them to watch me playing and they themselves not playing. Once again, they accompanied me. Not only that, they even accompanied me to Carrefour till almost 8 pm to buy some bakery needs. Feel so sorry that they have to starve their own stomach just to accompany me, it's already bad enough for them to accompany me the whole day. Guess this is what friends are for and I think I am quite selfish and self-centered to only think of myself. I did spared a thought for others, however I can't resist the urge to get things done first for myself. I don't want and don't like the feeling of regret for not getting the things I want and need.  Life is like this, you have to grab the opportunity before it slips away. I realised that in life, if you want to gain a thing, you have to lose another thing. That's why nothing is perfect!

      I am finally back to Singapore from the undeveloped country, Cambodia. Life there was indeed terrible, imagine there's no high-rise building, the road made of soil and sand, a few shopping mall, no public transportation like MRT or bus, dusty and polluted environment, high crime rate, unhygenic dishes and aweful food.  For now, I shall not go into detail of how's my life in Cambodia. A lot of things have happened there, some bad and some good. It would take a whole lot to dump my thoughts and comments in this post. I would cut it short and sweet.  First of all, I want to apologise to you guys that I didn't buy any souveniers or gifts over there because there's really nothing special that takes my glance. And it's a bit costly.  Quite disappointed that when I am back, my MSN friends didn't take the initiative to chat up with me first or they didn't even notice I was in overseas? Nevermind. In case you might be wondering why it takes so long for me to update my blog, it's because I am too busy to blog those few days. My time is fully occupied by many activities that I got to do, like PC maintainance, Internet stuff, etc...

So I will no longer be able to blog for 18 days and if possible I would try to blog there.  I still haven't pack my luggage, why am I always doing things in the last minutes? I think I have formed a habbit on it.  I think I would make it short and go pack my luggage for now. Good bye!

      Yes, I went clubbing at MS the first time last night. MS means Mohd Sultan, not Microsoft. But before that, I went to my long-time-haven't-meet IRC friend's house to fix a harddisk into his PC. It gave me a sense of satisfaction and that shows what I am capable of.  So after that, we departed together from his house to meet his IRC friend at Clarke Quay MRT station to go clubbing. I was quite surprise that his IRC friend actually brought a group of people. 2 Ah Lians and 1 office boy. Ok, I was quite scared. Aiya I think better tell you my IRC friend's name lar. His name is called William, surname is Hung. Full name is William Hung.   One of the hilarious thing is that the Ah Lian teased William, you know what that Ah Lian asked him, she asked him "You really stay at West ar?", then William Hung replied "Ya". The ah lian immediately laughed to her friend "Wah, he really travel West to retrieve scripture(A sacred writing or book)". If you translate that into Mandarin and you know the story of the Monkey God, you will get it. What a joke for a Vista Day! Haha  We walked to MS from there and William's IRC friend collected $20 from everyone for the entrance fee to the club. I am underage and I did not bring IC along with me, so I pass my ITE ez-link card to William's friend to the bouncer and don't know what they said to the bouncer. Voila, I can enter.   The club is called "Angel". But actually it's a devil to me, the music there cannot make it. All those old technos.. that kills my mood of dancing. It limits my creativity. So sian.... kind of wasted my money.. But nevermind, luckily I drank many glasses of Martell to make it up. William's friend opened 1 and a half bottle of Martell with coke.  Let's called this William's friend "ABC". ABC kepts on serving me those drinks... we played the Guessing game and I kept on losing to him. Whenever I lose, I have to take a drink of the Martell with coke once. It's obvious that he is trying to make me drunk. But not so easy, you think I am that easily down? All thanks to my dad, who hardly been drunk before. Thanks him for passing the genes to me. Later on, ABC wanted me to drink "On the rock" meaning just purely the Martell without anything added I guess. So he got a small glasses of purely Martell and I drank it up at one go. He did that too after me. But both of us are still not drunk, he carried on with his dancing.  Just about when the last bottle of Martell is going to finish up, they poured 2 glasses of Martel purely. ABC's friend requested me to drink half a glass, so I drank. And they showed admiration to me.... I felt so honoured. Well, I do not intend to show off or what. I just simply gave them the face and entertain them. Throughout the whole night, been to the toilet up and down many times. My urine is whiter than usual. I do feel a bit dizzy and was quite sleepy... I felt even more dizzy especially walking past the dance floor with the light flashing at a fast rate non-stop. I could fall anytime but I am not really drunk to that extend.  It's weird that the more I drink, the more drowsy I feel instead of drunkness. We chilled out till the club closed at around 3.45 am and they went back home in taxi, but William and I take the NightRider back home. They were so rich and ABC is quite generous to treat us Martell. I haven't thanks them for that. I have been thinking suspicious in my mind, what uterior motive he has got to treat us the drinks. We just know each other the first time. I wondered.  The story here is being cut short because it would took hours for me to finish up the whole incident of last night.  I will continue the next time....

      First day of school, Chang Wei requested me to check my exam results online and *tata*. I got an A for my Networking Fundamental(NWF), B for my PC Architecture(PCA) and B for my Multimedia Content Creation(MCC). Just as what I had predicted, it came true! I felt quite satisfied and at the same time, felt very depressed because I know I would have done better, at least both module an A. Since even my close friend Song Chuan could achieved all straight 'A's, it was beautiful. During the June vacation, I wouldn't dare to check it because sometimes it's good to not know anything than to know everything. At least, I would be happier and my holiday mood is not ruined. But I had been worrying about my results when I restrained myself for not checking. Curiousity kills the cat, I remember.  You see, this is how I predicted my grades. I did not manage to hand in my Assignment 3 and 4 for my PCA, so even if my overall score is high. I wouldn't be able to get a grade A, how could a teacher grade a student A when he or she did not hand in all assignments? It's reasonable enough and I accept the fact that I should deserve a B. It's just being fair to the rest.  As for my MCC, how could I expect a grade A when I did not hand in my assignment punctually and my assignment 2 is not completed, furthermore I did not add any content or information inside. I was grateful that I got a B, I wouldn't dare to expect much. It was disheartening for a student like me who can achieve A not to deserve it. For my NWF, I knew it at the beginning I might get an A because I know my test results were quite above average and I had put in a lot of effort into my assignments that can be binded into a textbook. And since this teacher have to grade a student according to the test results and assignments, there's no way he could soley make a decision based on his judgement. He had to go by the book, add up our overall results and grade.  Blame it on my lazy attitude and slowness and whatever bad things, now I just want to be free from whatever CCAs or activities that last time I had devoted much of my time into. Especially Modern Dance and Entrepreneur Club, last time I had this YEP Project going to Cambodia to help assemble PCs. Every Saturday was like that "burned" away, now I am gonna free myself. Just as I thought I had washed my hands off those, Aisin this kind of classmate recommend me a job at the convenience shop in Esplanade. She told me the working hours there is flexible and the pay rate is $5 per hour. It is easy job, not much of things to do. Just tend the shop, restocks the drinks, sweep the floor, perhaps mop the floor, etc. I kind of like this job, because it's easy money to earn. Where can you find such an easy and relaxing job which provides flexible working hours, it's totally an ideal part-time job for students who want to earn some quick-cash.  If you are interested, they are still hiring people. So please either approach me or Aisin for the details.  This is getting late and I got to sleep for tomorrow's lessons.

      This is a blog that aims to discourages gays from continuing their lifestyles and hopefully help them seek their true purpose in life.  The writer approach the issue using logic, bible verses and people's experiences. What he wrote makes senses and he uses a religous method to somehow psycho the people as in brain-washing. Hopefully, his ultimate goal is to see the gay population in Singapore would decrease.  Blog's URL:  urlLink http://stopgays.blogspot.com/  Rating: 4 and a half out of 5 Stars

      To somone out there who is trying to piss me off, you are just a small tiny dot I know so far. Surprised to see that you have been checking my blog out in a regular basis, I am quite glad. Because this shows that someone's been reading my blog loyally, and is interested in my daily life.  I love to make enemies and you are the only one who dares to make enemy with me, I am truly impressed. I am a Scorpio, so you know what's the consequences of being enemy with me? I suggest why not you create a blog called "Xing Yi Sucks" or "I hate Xing Yi"? And you can comment whatever bad things to everyone out there? Call me son of a bitch, gay, horny bastard or what, you say it all.  Ok, maybe you are just trying to express your love towards me. Just that you do it in a nasty way just to bring attention to me. I now get what you are thinking and understand how you feel.  So I am gonna make you Xing Yi's enemy of the year and award you with a grand prize. Please reveal your name, gender, home address and contact number so that I can contact you to collect the prize or deliver the prize to your doorstep. But I know you are not gonna be so stupid to tell me your particulars, so I am gonna choose a location and time to leave the prize there for you to collect.  The location is at my school, ITE MacPherson. This coming Monday, I will put the prize into the rubbish bin which is infront of I-net cafe entrance at 12 noon sharp before I leave for class. To protect your identity, please collect the prize after I leave for about 5 minutes time. Remember to collect it or else you have to search it in the rubbish chute.  I got to go....

      I simply got too much to blog and I ended up not blogging much, because I simply have too much things to accomplish. I need to spend time on my recreation like playing computer games the whole day, reading the newspapers, socialising with my ex-classmates as well as my friends, spending time with family, etc... it just goes on and on. I need to learn ASP programming for my next semester project, I need to fully utilise my oven to bake edible stuff that doesn't look black, but before that, I need to do some supermarketing, research on the internet and library for the recipe.  Look, I am so busy. So it's good that you guys don't piss me off, but actually I hope I really do get it. But on the otherhand, I still want peace and luckily you guys didn't piss me off which I wanted it so badly. Do you get what I mean? I doubt so. For now I am gonna create 2 more blogs using the same account and I am seeking for any comments from you guys.  I am going to create a blog that lists out restaurants only in Singapore that serve not only good food, have the romantic ambience, beautiful surroundings and nice environment. In this blog, I will give my review as well as ratings on those restaurants. Essential details such as the address, opening hours and I think most importantly the price in the food menu will be shown there. Those are what helpful information that diners will usually look out for, so fret not. Now with this so-called "new service" in that blog, you will never have to crack your head again for an ideal place to dine in.  The second blog would be a blog that spots good readable blogs on the world wide web, its aim is to create awearness of such great blogs and recognition. Whether the blogs are hilarious, entertaining, informative, interesting or educational, they are welcome! As long as it's in English, understandable, readable, presentable and good standard English would be a plus! As usual, review and ratings will be given to indicate the worthiness of visiting such a blog.  So what do you think? Do you agree that I should set up this two blogs? I shouldn't have asked this question because I am gonna set up no matter how violent your objection is. Now I need your help in thinking of a suitable URL blog name for these two blogs, leave your comments in this post. Thank you!  I need to sleep now...

      This is the wonderful blog in the Lastest Update Section that I have came across on the main page of Blogger. The aurthor is humorous and creative the way he described his encounter in his daily life. Check out his latest addition that how desperate he was trying to eliminate all the mouses in his room and you will know why he is humorous. Oh lastly, need I say it out? He is gay.  Overall, I will give the rating 4 out of 5 stars for his blog. It was nice smooth read and it never bore me.  Blog URL: http://gaygaybrad.blogspot.com/ Rating: 4 out of 5 Stars

        LESSON 8: EVERYTHING YOU NEVER WANTED TO KNOW ABOUT PARTIES    The main part of a teenager’s life is spent in a noisy, wild, environment with loud music, spiked drinks and frantic dancing – but enough about break-time in the school canteen. This lesson deals with parties: how to host them, how to attend them.  There are basically four different types of parties:   Informal parties  – These spontaneous affairs are attended by a small group of close friends.   Mini parties  – These spontaneous affairs are attended by a close group of small friends (e.g. pygmies, elves, dwarves etc.) Snow White used to have lots of these mini parties, until her downstairs neighbour complained.   Celebration parties  – The people are wined and dined, and are invited to commemorate a special occasion (e.g. graduation, birthday, capture of first boyfriend, etc).   Opposition parties  – No food for the people, no music… and that’s all stated in the Manifesto.   Guest who?   A good teenager must realize that the secret to the success of any type of party depends on who’s on the guest list.  The Teenage Textbook  recommends that you invite the following types of people:  (1)	The Rich and Famous - Such guests will raise the tone of the party greatly. Teenagers will usually be sufficiently impressed by the following categories of Rich and Famous guest: National Sportspeople. Famous Fashion Models, Offspring of Rich & Famous People, People Who Have Made Song Requests on Radio, People Who Can Drive Cars, etc.  (2)	The Life and Soul - Your party would be empty without this guest. The ‘Life and Soul’ of every party takes the lead in making a fool of himself and sets everyone else at ease. Such a person should have a low IQ and an even lower sense of humour. If you cannot find a ‘Life and Soul’ simply hire a mobile disco DJ who can usually be relied upon to make a fool of himself for a small fee.  (3)	The Silent Majority – You will need a lot of these people to add ‘bulk’ to your guest list. Generally speaking, guests who make up the silent majority are not able to make conversation or communicate verbally. They are also so plain and anonymous that their own mothers would have difficulty recognizing them. Such people include students in charge of the library, students who take two maths subjects, teenagers with bad breath and people who win Mr and Miss Personality contests.  (4)	The Trendies -  Such teenagers are not rare. Dressed in fashionably feminine designer wear, bright, chunky jewellery and earrings, beautiful eye-makeup, blood-red lip gloss… and the girls are even worse.  (5)	The Wallflower – Have one of two of these lonely people around, and your other guests will feel much better about themselves. People who are ignored or avoided in real life make the best wall-flowers. Therefore you should pick teenagers who are aspiring poets, score more than 6 A’s at O-level or speak in words of more than two syllables.   Important note  So far, you may have noticed that  The Teenage Textbook  has been dealing with advice on how to host an informal party. Formal balls are different. How, then, should one throw a ball? With an over-hand motion, a smooth delivery, a twist of the thumb and a lot of follow-through.

       Lesson 14: Mox without Sox   Teenagers like dressing well. They have a lot of fun with clothes (actually, teenagers also have a lot of fun without clothes… see this book’s chapter on sex).  Basically, there are three sorts of dressing: informal dressing, dressing for dates, and thousand island dressing.  Informal garments (i.e. what you wear to movies, pop concerts, the beach etc), are the Number One most important clothes you should have in your wardrobe. This is because  you are most often seen in them.  Your jeans must be your most important piece of informal wear. Good jeans follow the three T’s principle, namely:   Tight  – Only children and middle-aged dirty old men wear loose-fitting jeans. The true teenager wears jeans which sharply reveal the hips, thighs, bottom etc. Remember: if it ain’t tight, it ain’t right.   Tough  – Tough jeans are good jeans. This is highly sensible because of the highly energetic life teenagers lead (including rough activities like watching movies, lounging at fast-food restaurants and catching the number 7 bus at Orchard Road).   Tapered  – Finally, jeans must be tapered, or a least straight. Nobody except Lucky Plaza salesmen and Australian tourists wear bell-bottoms.  The perfect top to complement jeans are T-shirts. Generally, your T-shirt can come in any colour, as long as it’s white. Sleeves should be about an inch (okay, 3.1 cm) above the elbow and collars should be round and covering the collar-bone.  Finally, footwear. For guys, leather tennis shoes are suitable for anything except playing tennis. Boating shoes (e.g. Topsiders) are also acceptable – unless you decide to go boating, in which case you should wear tennis shoes.  Girls may wear flat-soled leather shoes (no high-heels, on informal occasions, please), or moccasins. Of course, the rule to follow is “Mox without Sox”, i.e. wear moccasins without socks.  Good clothing for parties include the…

        Men in pubs      Not   that I have had much experience, but from the girl-talk and gossip I've gathered from my friends, there are a few categories of men in pubs or clubs that one can almost instantly recognise.    The (Leering) Uncle type    Can be spotted more often in:    Older pubs with (cheesy) revamped decor and tons of cheap beer.    Pubs or karaoke lounges that play (cheesy) retro music and have lots of young ladies.     Telltale signs:    May be balding or look like they've just gone for hair-weaving treatment.    May don a couple of gold chains or bracelets, thick gold watches or fat rings.    Often pay by cash (wouldn't want the wives to know where they've been from credit card bills).    Can't keep their eyes off the girls gyrating on the dance floor.    Old enough to be the father of the young ladies.      The (Rich Kid) Yuppie type    Can be spotted more often in:    Trendy or spanking new pubs.    Special premieres or exclusive events at clubs.     Telltale signs:    Short spunky hairstyle, well-gelled.    In office outfit, tie still on, albeit loosened.    Flashy smiles and heavily scented with cologne.    May be accompanied by a flashy vehicle or model-like girl companion.    Often pays by credit card.      The (Desperate) National Service Male type     Can be spotted more often in:     Watering holes along Mohamed Sultan Road and Boat Quay, especially during happy hours or ladies' nights.      Telltale signs:     Short shaven hair.    Very tanned faces, sometimes with acne.    Usually with his camp mates.    Often drinking too much, too quickly.    Often needing Dutch courage to approach girls (related to above point).    Overtly drooling over girls gyrating on the dance floor.       Written by Candice Lim

        Going for dates in pubs   Ok, so the nice, cosy dinner is over and you're looking for a place to chill out and carry on the interesting conversation you had over your meal.  And since it's Friday night, you are all for the idea of sipping alcohol in a snazzy bar with good audio vibrations that'll put you in a relazing mood for a nice chit-chat.  But before you get  too  relaxed, especially if it is your first time hanging out with your date, there are some things you may want to take note of:  If you cannot hold your liquor well, avoid drinking too much. Doesn't matter if the guy is paying for all drinks - one shouldn't be too greedy especially if alcohol doesn't go well with you. Avoid taking shots (such as tequila pops) because you are required to "pop" the drink down in one gulp, so chances are you'll get tipsy faster. Moral of the story is - don't let the free drinks get to your head.  If you are wearing a cute miniskirt, don't, for the love of all mankind, agree to go to a pub where they  only  have high barstools. Even if you are very sure you will not let anything slip into view, you can never be sure what will happen after a few cocktails. And even if you think you can trust your date, you haven't seen how he behaves after a few jugs of beer.  If you go to the ladies' to powder your nose and check for vegetable bits between your teeth, never take another sip of your drink when you come back. Never mind if you date looks like the harmless, innocent sort. Looks can deceive. Date rape drugs are so rampant now you can never be too careful. Some of these drugs can even make their victims permanently sterile. So always be more cautious than careless. Smile sweetly and ask your date nicely to order another Cosmopolitan for you, tell him you like it chilled, not lukewarm.  Finally, if your date turns a tad unruly after drinking and tries to cosy up to you in a tube way, be your own woman: just stand up and leave. Don't let him send you home. If he's driving, he shouldn't even be drinking in the first place. So always have sufficient cash with you, even on dates. You never know when you'll need to make a quick exit.
