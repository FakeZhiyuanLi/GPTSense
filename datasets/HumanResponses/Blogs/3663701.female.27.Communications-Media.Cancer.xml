       Four days and counting until we set off on our biking adventure.  There's so much to do this week between our normal working hours and last minute purchases and preparations.  We also have to practice packing the bikes as they will be on the trip, just to ensure that everything fits.  It's nuts...I can't believe I chose this as my holiday...it's gonna be dope.    In other news, there was a massive accident on the autobahn on Thursday of last week.  It happened directly in front of the exit to our house.  A tractor trailer carrying flammable goods crashed into the support pillar of a bridge and exploded - just like in the movies, man.  The heros of the day were two brave Dutchmen who pulled the truck drivers out of the vehicle before the whole thing blew sky high.  The bridge started to fall apart as a result of the explosion, so part of the autobahn was shut down for the entire weekend.  Traffic jams galore.     We were in Dortmund on the weekend, visiting the in-laws.  Nando's parents are great.  His mom was a home economics/family studies teacher and so whenever we go there she has elaborate cakes made for the Sunday afternoon "coffee and cake" session.  She is Betty Crocker and Martha Stewart rolled into one. Definitely the hostess with the mostess.      Europeans really are more cultured when compared to their uncouth North American counterparts.  They regularly eat dinner together as a family instead of everyone grabbing something on the go.  They never drink tea or coffee without a saucer, and they are much more skilled and efficient when it comes to handling cutlery.  Whenever I have dinner with the Laumanns family, I feel like the kid in the jungle book who has been raised by wolves and is reintroduced to civilized society when he's like ten years old or something.  My big clumsy paws are a running joke at the dinner table.  I am praised and congratulated if I actually get through a meal without dropping something on Nando's mom's lovely white table cloth.        Nando's nephew was also there this weekend.    urlLink     Leo and Lulu&nbsp; urlLink      This kid is the sweetest.  He's about 9 months old now.  It's really amazing to see how quickly babies grow.  I've never been around one for any extended period of time until now.  I love being able to play with him and then give him back to mummy and daddy as soon as he starts getting cranky.  I like being "Tante Jackie".  I think I will keep it that way for a very long time.  Got loads to do so until next time...  Jaxxx

       I find it slightly amusing that I've seen more low-budget Canadian films on German TV than I ever have in Canada. It's a given that film making isn't exactly Canada's forte, but it confounds me that the people in charge of programming for the movie channels here would actually buy our crap. How do I know they are Candian productions, you ask? Well, by the usual giveaway of course...the National Film Board of Canada logo that rolls with the ending credits. Until now, I think I've only ever seen the NFB logo on the films I was made to watch as a child in elementary school. (You know...the ones about bicycle safety and saying no to strangers). "If someone you don't know offers you candy.  Say NO! Then GO! And TELL someone!" I remember the early days of Jim Carey's acting career from those cinematic works of genius.  In other news...  I had my first visitors in Brausnchweig two weeks ago. It was really nice to see a familiar face. My main Aix-en-Provence partner in crime, Lee, and his main squeeze, Jon, came to visit for a few days of shopping, sight-seeing and reminiscing.      urlLink    Jon, Lee and Jax deciding where to have dinner&nbsp; urlLink     It started out a bit rocky when the boys' flight was delayed by 5 hours. To make matters worse, when Nando and I arrived at the airport, traffic was backed up and there were  "Polizei"  everywhere! According to the officer that was checking each and every car, terminals A and B were closed off due to a bomb threat! Luckily our visitors were arriving in terminal C.   We spent the next two days shopping, bar hopping and wandering about the city. The weather was grey, cold and rainy (as usual) but I don't think these British boys minded. I guess you get used to that on the island.   On Friday afternoon, we took off for Nando's summer home at the North Sea for some fresh air, even worse weather and pure relaxation. We ate well, drank well, sat by a cozy fire and played Scrabble until the wee hours of the morning.    urlLink    Ferienhaus in Burhave&nbsp; urlLink     All in all, a great weekend. We have a reciprocal visit planned for September so that the boys can show me all around Newcastle.  Can't wait. This weekend it's off to Dortmund to spend some QT with Nando's folks. So, until next time...  J

       Hello out there...  I've decided to hop on the blog-wagon after my good friend Vickie began her very own blog and graciously decided to send it to me. Why am I creating a blog, you ask? Well, since I don't keep a journal, I think it's a fun way to document my thoughts for future retrospection. It also lets those I love (who are far, far away) know what's going on in my life. Basically, this is how it works: A couple times a week, I will post my rants, thoughts, feelings and observations on the web for all of you to view at your will. You can read and post comments, if you so desire. It's as simple as that.   So...let's begin shall we? I will start with some basics and an update on my "current situation".   First off, this is me.   urlLink    Jax - sitting in a pile of garbage at the SARS concert.&nbsp; urlLink     I am presently shacked up with my boyfriend, Nando  urlLink    Nando - car fanatic&nbsp; urlLink     in  urlLink Braunschweig, Germany.    urlLink    Scenes of Braunschweig&nbsp; urlLink     I am working as an English teacher at the local uni and at a private language school. (My German is shit so I can't really do much else). Nando is working on a Phd. in integrated vehicle dynamics (or something) and working for Volkswagen simultaneously.  Smart boy. We live in a cute one-bedroom apartment with our geezer of a landlord (Mr. VÃ¶pel), living above us.  We try daily to avoid running into him, as a quick "hello, how are you" soon turns into a half hour monologue about any trivial matter he can dream up.  I wish he'd get some new material...I've heard the same stories a hundred times.  At the moment, life is humming along smoothly.  But I must admit, I miss my friends and family tremendously. I am finding it very difficult to stay close and keep in touch. I hope that this little journal will help bridge the gap somewhat.  I am planning to be back in T.O over the Christmas holidays, but that's a long way off.  In the meantime, I am enjoying all that living in Europe has to offer.  The best thing is undoubtedly the close proximity of neighbouring countries.  Germany shares at least 7 or 8 borders with other countries and they are all no more than a six hour drive in any direction.  And with the insurgence of discount airlines, flying is fast and affordable.  In the past few months, I've been skiing in Switzerland  urlLink    Near Zurich&nbsp; urlLink     and chillin' in the Corsican sun  urlLink    the view from our room&nbsp; urlLink     Over the next week or two, Nando and I are preparing for our summer holidays.  We are planning a three-week bike trip from Oberwald, Switzerland to Aix-en-Provence, France.  We will mainly be following the Rhone River as it winds its way down from the Alps to the Mediterranean Sea.  As this will be my first long bike trip, I am not really sure what to expect other than some breath-taking scenery and a great adventure.  You can be sure you will hear all about it upon my return on the 16th of August.  Well, this concludes post #1.  Feel free to bookmark this link and check back often.   Luv Jax

       I just returned from an amazing three weeks on the road and am excited to update you all on our adventures. I kept a journal while biking through Switzerland and France and will post one entry per day until all of them have been posted.   So without further ado...   Prelude: July 23rd - 24th   We arrived in Zurich late Friday evening. Flying with the bikes wasn't as difficult as we imagined. Marco met us at the airport and the three of us biked to his apartment together. We spent most of Saturday shopping and buying last minute items. Thankfully, I picked up some kick-ass rain gear that would prove VERY useful on our trip! Revital cooked up an amazing meal for us on the eve of our departure and then we relaxed over wine and great conversation until bedtime.   urlLink    At Marco and Revital's apartment in Zurich the evening before we set off on our trip.&nbsp; urlLink          Day 1: Sunday, July 26, 2004    Daily Stats: Kms - 39.76 Average speed - 23.16 km/h Time - 1:43:02 Max speed - 62.8 km/h Total Kms - 39.76   Today we started our journey from atop the Rhone Glacier (The Furkapass near Oberwald, Switzerland).     urlLink    Jax at the Rhone Glacier&nbsp; urlLink     Marco, Revital and Leo were kind enough to accompany us to the top of the glacier by minivan. (I felt sorry for the poor bastards I saw biking up that thing and was so thankful for the lift). We stopped for a lovely picnic near "Andermatt" where Leo had a few laughs on the swings.   urlLink    Leo on swing&nbsp; urlLink      Once at the top, we were able to actually go inside the glacier (for a small fee of course) via a cave-like passage that had been dug through for tourists.    urlLink    Entrance leading into the glacier cave&nbsp; urlLink      urlLink    Jax inside the Rhone Glacier&nbsp; urlLink      urlLink    Nando and ice sculpture inside the Rhone Glacier&nbsp; urlLink      urlLink    We look like we're having fun but we're actually freezing our asses off!&nbsp; urlLink     It was upsetting to see the photos outside the cave illustrating just how much the glacier had receded in recent years (probably as a result of global warming).   urlLink    Rhone Glacier - a wet, dripping mess&nbsp; urlLink     By the time we set off on our journey it was nearly 5pm.     urlLink    Ready to hit the road&nbsp; urlLink     We planned to make our first day on the road a short one. We said our goodbyes, did a final check on the bikes and set off down the side of the mountain at speeds of up to 63 km/h. It was absolutely exhilirating...a total rush!  The scenery in the Alps was just spectacular. I wanted to take everything in but full concentration was needed on the road as the turns were sometimes sharp and we had to be careful of cars and buses.   urlLink    The road that lies ahead - view from the top of the Furkapass&nbsp; urlLink     Once on less steep ground we found the bike path (Route #1) with little trouble and continued to follow the Rhone River. It was interesting to think that we had just begun our journey at the source of the Rhone and had actually seen it as nothing more than a trickle of water. By this point it was still pretty narrow, however it had changed from a clear blue to a cloudy jade colour.   urlLink    The Rhone becomes a real river&nbsp; urlLink     On our way, we ran into a short but extremely steep hill that posed somewhat of a problem. The back end of the bikes were so heavy that the front end came off the ground when we tried to ride the bikes up the hill. We were forced to push the bikes to the top (brutal). In the process, Nando gouged his shin on one of the peddals and began bleeding profusely...ouch. We took a quick rest at the top and then continued on toward Fiesch where we were planning to camp for the night.  The countryside was peaceful and we enjoyed the quiet solitude of the ride at dusk.   urlLink    Countryside in the Rhone Valley&nbsp; urlLink     We've just arrived at our campsite,  Camp S'Moosji  , in Fiesch. Since it is our one-year anniversary today, we are going to splurge on a romantic dinner at the Camp S'Moosji restaurant. Woo!   urlLink    Camp S'Moosji at last&nbsp; urlLink     Switzerland is so beautiful. I can't believe I'm here. I wish I could share it with all my friends and family. Everyone needs to see this and photos can't possibly do it justice. Tomorrow will be a long difficult day. I hope it goes well.  Nighty-night...  Jax
