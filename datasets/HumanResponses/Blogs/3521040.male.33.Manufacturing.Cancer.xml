						   شنیده ام، که حتی دلقک های پیر دربار هم قبل از خواب دعا می کرده اند دیده ام، که حتی کودکان بی سرپناه هم قبل از خواب دعا می کنند. دعا کرده ام، که امشب باران بیاید تا کودک معصوم و شیطان همسایه دوباره قبل از خواب به اندازه کافی صدای شرشر باران را بشنود.  I have heard, that even old clowns of the court were blessing before the sleep. I have seen, that even homeless children are blessing before the sleep. I have blessed, that it rains tonight, then the naughty and innocent kid of neighbour, can hear the purl of rain enough before the sleep.

       Work like you don’t need the money.  Love like you’ve never been hurt.  Dance like nobody’s watching.  Sing like nobody’s listening.  Live life like it’s heaven on earth.

      One advantage of marriage it seems to me is that when you fall out of love with him or he falls out of love with you it keeps you together until maybe you fall in again.  --Judith Viorst  Neither a lofty degree of intelligence nor imagination nor both together go to the making of genius. Love, love, love, that is the soul of genius.  --Mozart  Love teaches even asses to dance.  --French Proverb  Generally, by the time you are real, most of your hair has been loved off, and your eyes drop out and you get loose in the joints and very shabby. But these things don't matter at all; because once you are real you can't be ugly, except to people who don't understand.  --Margery Williams The Velveteen Rabbit  Love your enemies. It really pisses them off!  --Unknown  To infinite, ever present Love, all is Love, and there is no error, no sin sickness, nor death.  --Mary Baker Eddy  For one human being to love another: that is perhaps the most difficult of our tasks; the ultimate, the last test and proof, the work for which all other work is but preparation.  --Rainer Maria Rilke  If I speak in the tongues of men and of angels, but have not love, I am only a resounding gong or a clanging cymbal. If I have the gift of prophecy and can fathom all mysteries and all knowledge, and if I have a faith that can move mountains, but have not love, I am nothing. If I give all I possess to the poor and surrender my body to the flames, but have not love I gain nothing Love is patient, love is kind. It does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud. It is not rude, it is not self-seeking, it is not easily angered, it keeps no record of wrongs. Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth. It always protects, always trusts, always perseveres. Love never fails. But where there are prophecies, they will cease; where there are tongues, they will be stilled; where there is knowledge, it will pass away...And now these things remain: faith, hope and love. But the greatest of these is love.  --1 Corinthians 13:1-8, 13  Friendship often ends in love; but love in friendship--never  --Charles Caleb Colton  Falling in love consists merely in uncorking the imagination and bottling the common sense.  --Helen Rowland  If you judge people, you have no time to love them.  --Mother Teresa  Sometimes I find myself making love to my own misfortune.  --Norma O. Abrego  Put love first. Entertain thoughts that give life and when a thought or resentment, or hurt, or fear comes your way, have another thought that is more powerful -- a thought that is love.  --Mary Manin Morrissey  We must love one another or die  --W.H. Auden poem - September 1, 1939  May you live as long as you wish and love as long as you live.  --Robert A. Heinlein Time Enough for Love. (He may have gotten it elsewhere.)  Never sign a valentine with your own name.  --Charles Dickens  You never lose by loving. You always lose by holding back.  --Barbara DeAngelis  Where does the family start? It starts with a young man falling in love with a girl - no superior alternative has yet been found.  --Sir Winston Churchill  The whole world loves a lover' is an interesting theory, but a very bad legal defense.  --Keith Sullivan  Platonic love is like an inactive volcano.  --Andre Pevost  If you have it [love], you don't need to have anything else, and if you don't have it, it doesn't matter much what else you have.  --Sir James M. Barrie  If the universe has any purpose more important then topping a woman you love and making a baby with her hearty help, I have never heard of it.  --Rabert A. Henlein Lazarus Long  I know that somewhere in the Universe exists my perfect soulmate - but looking for her is much more difficult than just staying at home and ordering another pizza.  --Alf Whit  It is not how much we do, but how much love we put in the doing. It is not how much we give, but how much love we put in the giving.  --Mother Teresa  Love: Two minds without a single thought.  --Philip Barry  Love is also like a coconut which is good while it is fresh, but you have to spit it out when the juice is gone, what's left tastes bitter.  --Bertolt Brecht  The mystery of love is greater than the mystery of death.  --Unknown

      I'm not afraid to die. I just don't want to be there when it happens.  -- Woody Allen   The report of my death was an exaggeration.  -- Mark Twain (New York Journal, June 1897)  The man that runs away lives to die another day.  -- A. E. Housman (A Shropshire Lad, 1896)  If you die in an elevator, be sure to push the Up button.  -- Sam Levenson   I don't want to tell you how much insurance I carry with the Prudential, but all I can say is: when I go, they go too.  -- Jack Benny   Death was Nature's way of telling you to slow down.  -- Terry Pratchett (Strata, 1981)  It's funny the way most people love the dead. Once you're dead, you're made for life.  -- Jimi Hendrix   Death is a very dull, dreary affair, and my advice to you is to have nothing whatever to do with it.  -- Somerset Maugham

      1. Throw out nonessential numbers. This includes age, weight and height.   Let the doctor worry about them. That is why you pay him/her.  2. Keep only cheerful friends. The grouches pull you down.  3. Keep learning. Learn more about the computer, crafts, gardening, whatever.   Never let the brain idle. " An idle mind is the devil's workshop." And the devil's name is Alzheimer's.  4.Enjoy the simple things.  5. Laugh often, long and loud Laugh until you gasp for breath.  6. The tears happen. Endure, grieve, and move on. The only person who is with us our entire life, is ourselves.Be ALIVE while you are alive.   7. Surround yourself with what you love, whether it's family, pets, keepsakes, music, plants, hobbies, whatever. Your home is your refuge.  8. Cherish your health: If it is good, preserve it. If it is unstable, improve it.  If it is beyond what you can improve, get help.  9. Don't take guilt trips. Take a trip to the mall, to the next county, to a foreign country, but NOT to where the guilt is.  10. Tell the people you love that you love them, at every opportunity. AND ALWAYS REMEMBER: Life is not measured by the number of breaths we take, but by the moments that take our breath away.  (George Carlin)

      It’s bad when one thing becomes two. One should not look for anything else in the Way of the Samurai. It is the same for anything else that is called a way. If one understands things in this manner, he should be able to hear about all ways and be more and more in accord with his own.  If one were to say in a word what the condition of being a Samurai is, its basis lies first in seriously devoting one’s body and soul to his master. Not to forget one’s master is the most fundamental thing for a retainer.  It is a good viewpoint to see the world as a dream. When you have something as a nightmare, you will wake up and tell yourself that it was only a dream. It is said that the world we live in is not a bit different from this.  Among the maxims on Lord Naoshinge’s wall there was this one: “Matters of great concern should be treated lightly.” Master Ittei commented: “Matters of small concern should be treated seriously.”  According to what one of the elders said, taking an enemy on the battlefield is like a hawk taking a bird. Even though it enters into the midst of a thousand of them, it gives no attention to any bird other than the one that it has first marked.  In the words of the ancients, one should make his decisions within the space of seven breaths. It is the matter of being determined and having the spirit to break right through to the other side.  Even if a Samurai’s head were to be suddenly cut off, he should still be able to perform one more action with certainty. If one becomes like a revengeful ghost and shows great determination, though his head is cut off, he should not die.  It is good to carry some powdered rouge in one’s sleeves. It may happen that when one is sobering up or waking from sleep, a Samurai’s complexion may be poor. At such a time it is good to take out and apply some powdered rouge.  When one has made a decision to kill a person, even if it will be very difficult to succeed by advancing straight ahead, it will not do to think about going at it in a long roundabout way. The Way of the Samurai is one of immediacy, and it is best to dash in headlong.  Our bodies are given life from the midst of nothingness. Existing where there is nothing is the meaning of the phrase, “Form Is Emptiness.” That all things are provided for by nothingness is the meaning of the phrase, “Emptiness Is Form.” One should not think that these are two separate things.  There is surely nothing other than the single purpose of the present moment. A man’s whole life is succession of moment after moment. There will be nothing else to do, and nothing else to pursue.  There is something to be learned from a rainstorm, when meeting with a sudden shower. You try not to get wet and run quickly along the road. By doing such things as passing under the eaves of houses, you still get wet. When you are resolved from the beginning, you will not be perplexed, though you will still get the same soaking. This understanding extends to all things.  It is said that what is called “the spirit of an age” is something to which one cannot return. That this spirit gradually dissipates is due to the world’s coming to an end. For this reason, although one would like to change today’s world back to the spirit of one hundred years or more ago, it cannot be done. Thus it is important to make the best out of every generation.

      A man is as great as the dreams he dreams  As great as the love he bears  As great as the values he redeems  And the happiness he shares  A man is as great as the thoughts he thinks  As the worth he has attained  As the fountains at which his spirit drinks  And the insight he has gained  A man is as great as the truth he speaks  As great as the help he gives  As great as the destiny he seeks  As great as the life he lives                                      - C.E.Flynn

       WOMEN have strengths that amaze men. They carry children,  they carry hardships, they carry burdens, but they hold happiness,  love and joy. They smile when they want to scream. They sing  when they want to cry. They cry when they are happy and laugh  when they are nervous.   WOMEN wait by the phone for a "safe at home call" from a friend  or relative after a snowy drive home.   WOMEN have special qualities about them. They volunteer for  good causes. They are pink ladies in hospitals, they bring food to  shut ins. They are childcare workers, executives, attorneys,  stay-at-home moms, biker babes and your neighbors. They wear  suits, jeans, and they wear uniforms. They fight for what they  believe in. They stand up for injustice. They are in the front row at  PTA meetings. They vote for the person that will do the best job  for family issues.   WOMEN walk and talk the extra mile to get their children in the  right schools and for getting their family the right health care.  They write to the editor, their congressmen and to the "powers that  be" for things that make for a better life. They don't take "no" for  an answer when they believe there is a better solution.   WOMEN stick a love note in their husband's lunch box. They do  without new shoes so their children can have them. They go to the  doctor with a frightened friend. They love unconditionally.   WOMEN are honest, loyal, and forgiving. They are smart,  knowing that knowledge is power; but they still know how to use  their softer side to make a point.   WOMEN want to be the best for their family, their friends, and  themselves. They cry when their children excel and cheer when  their friends get awards.   WOMEN are happy (or cry) when they hear about a birth or a new  marriage. Their hearts break when a friend dies. They have sorrow  at the loss of a family member, yet they are strong when they think  there is no strength left.   A WOMAN'S touch can cure any ailment. They know that a hug  and a Kiss can heal a broken heart. She can make a romantic  evening unforgettable.   WOMEN come in all sizes, in all colors and shapes. They live in  homes, apartments and cabins. They drive, fly, walk, run or e-mail  you to show how much they care about you. The heart of a woman  is what makes the world spin!   WOMEN do more than just give birth. They bring joy and hope.  They give compassion and ideals. They give moral support to their  family and friends. All they want back is a hug, a smile and for  you to do the same to people you come in contact with. Women  have a lot to say and a lot to give. The beauty of a woman is not in  the clothes she wears, the figure that she carries, or the way she  combs her hair. The beauty of a woman must be seen from in her  eyes, because that is the doorway to her heart, the place where love  resides. The beauty of a woman is not in a facial mole, but true  beauty in a woman is reflected in her soul. It is the caring that she  lovingly gives, the passion that she shows, and the beauty of a  woman with passing years-only grows!

      Just for this morning, I am going to smile when I see your face and laugh when I feel like crying.   Just for this morning, I will let you choose what you want to wear, and smile and say how perfect it is.   Just for this morning, I am going to step over the laundry, and pick you up and take you to the park to play.   Just for this morning, I will leave the dishes in the sink, and let you teach me how to put that puzzle yours together.   Just for this afternoon, I will unplug the telephone and keep the computer off, and sit with you in the backyard and blow bubbles.    Just for this afternoon, I will not yell once, not even a tiny grumble when you scream and whine for the ice cream truck, and I will buy you one if he comes by.   Just for this afternoon, I won't worry about what you are going to be when you grow up, or second-guess every decision I have made where you are concerned.    Just for this afternoon, I will let you help me bake cookies, and I won't stand over you trying to fix them.  Just for this afternoon, I will take us to Mc Donald's and buy us both a Happy Meal so you can have both toys.   Just for this evening, I will hold you in my arms and tell you a story about how you were born and how much I love you.   Just for this evening, I will let you splash in the tub and not get angry.   Just for this evening, I will let you stay up late while we sit on the porch and count all the stars.   Just for this evening, I will snuggle beside you for hours, and miss my favorite TV shows.   Just for this evening when I run my finger through your hair as you pray, I will simply be grateful that God has given me the greatest gift ever given.  I will think about the mothers and fathers who are searching for their missing children, the mothers and fathers who are visiting their children's graves instead of their bedrooms, and mothers and fathers who are in hospital rooms watching their children suffer senselessly.  And when I kiss you goodnight I will hold you a little tighter, a little longer. It is then, that I will thank God for you, and ask him for nothing, except one more day...   Sometimes we get so involved in our daily routines that we tend to forget what great gifts our children really are. We never know if God is going to give us one more day.

      If one day you feel like crying... Call me. I don't promise that I will make you laugh, But I can cry with you. If one day you want to run away- Don't be afraid to call me. I don't promise to ask you to stop... But I can run with you. If one day you don't want to listen to anyone... Call me. I promise to be there for you. And I promise to be very quiet. But if one day you call... And there is no answer... Come fast to see me. Maybe I need you.

      If I knew it would be the last time that I'd see you fall asleep, I would tuck you in more tightly and pray the Lord your soul to keep.  If I knew it would be the last time that I see you walk out the door, I would give you a hug and kiss and call you back for one more.  If I knew it would be the last time I'd hear your voice lifted up in praise, I would video tape each action and word, so I could play them back day after day.  If I knew it would be the last time, I could spare an extra minute or two, to stop and say that "I love you," instead of assuming that you KNOW I do.  If I knew it would be the last time, I would be there to share your day, well, I'm sure you'll have so many more So I can let this one slip away.  For surely there's always tomorrow to make up for an oversight, and we always get a second chance to make everything alright.  There will always be another day to say our "I love you's," And certainly there's another chance to say our "Anything I can do's."  But just in case I might be wrong, and today is all I get, I'd like to say how much I love you and hope you never forget.  Tomorrow is not promised to anyone, young or old alike, And today may be the last chance you get to hold your loved ones tight.  So, if you're waiting for tomorrow, why not do it today? For if tomorrow never comes, you'll surely regret the day,  That you didn't take that extra time for a smile, a hug, or kiss, And you were too busy to grant someone, what turned out to be their one last wish.  So hold your loved ones close today, whisper in their ear, Tell them how much you love them, And that you'll always hold them dear.  Take the time to say "I'm sorry" "please forgive me" "thank you" or "It's ok" And if tomorrow never comes, you'll have no regrets about today

      You call Suicide Prevention Dept. and they put you on hold. Your twin sister forgets your birthday. Your 4-year-old tells you that it's almost impossible to flush a grapefruit down the toilet. It costs more to fill up your car than it did to buy it. You wake up to the soothing sound of running water...and remember that you just bought a waterbed. Your car payment, house payment, and girlfriend are three months overdue. The bird singing outside your window is a vulture. You wake up and your braces are stuck together. You call your answering service and they tell you it's none of your business. You put both contact lenses in the same eye. You compliment the boss' wife on her unusual perfume and she isn't wearing any. You call your wife and tell her that you would like to eat out tonight and when you get home there is a sandwich on the front porch. The restaurant check has been on the table for ten minutes...and no one has touched it. Nothing you own is actually paid for. Your mother approves of the person you are dating. Your doctor tells you that you are allergic to chocolate chip cookies. You have to borrow from your VISA to pay off your MasterCard. Your cat abandons the nice box you prepared for her and has her kittens in your dresser drawer. Everyone loves your driver's license picture. You realize that the phone number on the bathroom wall of the bar is yours. Your kids start treating you the same way you treated your parents. The gypsy fortune teller offers to refund your money. People think you are 40...and you really are.

       1. When loved ones come home, always run to greet them. 2. When it's in your best interest, practice obedience. 3. Let others know when they've invaded your territory. 4. Run, romp and play daily. 5. Eat with gusto and enthusiasm. 6. Be loyal. 7. Never pretend to be something you're not. 8. If what you want lies buried, dig until you find it. 9. If someone is having a bad day, be silent, sit close by and nuzzle them gently. 10. Thrive on attention and let people touch you. 11. Avoid biting when a simple growl will do. 12. On hot days, drink lots of water and lay under a shady tree. 13. When you're happy, dance around and wag your entire body. 14. No matter how often you're scolded, don't buy into the guilt thing and pout... run right back and make friends. 15. Delight in the simple joy of a long walk. 16. Never eat anything remotely dislikable and you will get lots more of what you like most in the world. 17. Love those who are close to you.
