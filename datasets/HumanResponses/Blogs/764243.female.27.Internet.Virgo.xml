       I've been having a conversation about relationships with a very longtime friend of mine today - one of those people you talk to a lot and then there's times you disappear from each other... No matter how much time has passed, though, you can always just pick up where you left off... Anyway, he's just told me he's going to propose to his gf. How exciting!...Which leads me to what I was just talking to him about.    The older you get, the more realize you want to slow down.  (Well, at least in my case.)  In college and for a couple of years after college, you partied.  You were a social butterfly.  Every weekend was a new adventure to you.  You had lots of friends around you and you knew about anything and everything going on.  Being in touch with the social scene was a huge priority to you.    At one point in your life, you just realize that things have a different meaning.  You have different priorities.  For him, he's never had to share his life with someone and now he can't get enough of spending his life with her... that's so exciting and scary at the same time.  For myself, I definitely know I'm not there, but Ive known for a long time that if and when I get to that point in my life, I'll be super excited.    But in the immediate moment, do you ever find yourself having to justify yourself and your actions to your close friends? Here's a good scenario... It's Friday night and everyone's excited to go out.  You just got home from work, though.  All you've been dreaming about all day long is how nice it would be to curl up with your pilllows in your bed and take a long nap.  Maybe even watch some tv or catch up on reading a book.  Who cares if it's Friday.  The parties aren't going anywhere - it's too much of an effort to get yourself done up for a club or a bar.  It's fun once in a while, but damn...every week? It takes a toll on you, especially your wallet.    It was one day a few months ago...that it all made sense to me.  A lot of my friends live with their parents, though very successful with their lives.  I remember when I lived with my parents.  I always wanted to go out, to get away from my nagging parents.  Now that I'm on my own, with my own financial responsibilities, I have no nagging parents to bug me about when I'm coming home or where I've been.  I have a house I get to enjoy, and I forget to do so sometimes.  I look forward to dinners with friends more.  I live for the weekends when I get to do laundry.  Damn, I must be getting old to be thinking like this.  (Disclaimer: I still love to dance though!) So in short, I realized that  a lot of my friends just haven't gotten to this phase in their lives.  They can't understand yet, but in time I know they'll know what I'm talking about.  The next time I feel like I'm justifying way too much, I'll have to remember that.  It'll ease my mind a lot more.

       Current Mood: Chilled Out (flip flops and a cargo skirt) Currently Listening To: Ice Cube, "Today Was a Good Day" *groove*   Yet another hot day in Mountain View - I woke up this morning totally freaking out that I was late for work...I was scurrying around totally rushing to get ready, thinking of all the things I needed to get done at work...All I remember thinking was ,"Damn, it's already 9am? How could I have overslept??"   ...and then I woke up and looked at my clock - 6:30am....    How funny is that..I laughed to myself and the morning's been pretty pleasant since.  I love waking up happy.  I think it's coz I went to sleep all giddy last night from this Korean movie a friend of mine and I watched... reminds me, I never asked for the name of the movie.    Anyway, it was a totally random movie in the beginning - not sure wheter to  say 'awww' or to laugh from how corny some of the humor was or to totally laugh my @ss off or to even want to tear a lil. The ending was the best - I'm glad my friend told me to watch it.  *smile*

       Current Mood: Giddy (for several reasons) Currently Listening To: Tagalog OPM cheesey love songs   Today's been an interesting day...actually, a really hot day.  It was 93 degrees out here in Mountain View - thank gawd for AC! A few ups and downs... my tummy still hurts from time to time though it's definitely not as bad as last week - I even have a few other friends going through something similar.  I wonder if it's something going around.  I hope not.    So I was reading friendster messages today and someone sent me  urlLink this   totally tragic news link... How absolutely sad is that. I really hope they catch the guys responsible for this guy's almost death.  You have to sometimes wonder what goes through people's minds.  I couldn't even fathom condoning such an act of violence.  blah, the world sucks sometimes.  On a super happier note, I found out my friend  is working at  urlLink PAC  again and I'm gonna visit so that I can get some laps in the pool in tonight - I so miss swimming! I know I'll be dying after the fourth lap though..we'll see.    On a last note, remind me to start writing more in my journal - then i'll have more poems to post in here!

       the sun came out to greet the clouds from a year long brewing storm... it covered my gloomy aura awaiting another rebirth.  the sunshine yanwed from a long slumber, ready to visit each passing heart.... wanting to hear each one's thoughts and bring those together that were once apart.   i felt its presence move slowly across my face. it passed from my nose to my cheeks. it left me a rosy glow that I held onto in the coming weeks.  I wondered if the sun bumped into you... Did it leave you a smile as big as mine?... ~Sept,2002~

        A symphony`s made its way into my head -  in sync with each step I take.  Driving me to whisper each note,  not realizing I`m just wandering and afloat.   Awake from the continuous beat...  It`s a song coming from my inner thoughts.  Uncomposed with any structure nor theory,  waiting for its melody to be caught.   The notes flow freely like my pen  with an innocence so naive.  Something I`d forgotten and tucked away..  part of me hopes It`ll stay.   Reality and it was the aura of the city...  half smoked stogs and steam rising from the streets.  Reality and I heard you singing...  Could that be the symphony in my head?  ~tine 3.17.03 1:30am~

       So it's kickin in... I'm a full time Googler now... how dope is that! I remember a while back when I was just getting out of college thinking to myself, "How cool would it be to work at Oracle (when I wanted to be a DBA) or Google..."  Funny how things work out.    Las night I hit up  urlLink yoga  at PG again.  I hadn't gone to yoga for about 3 weeks (maybe longer?) and I'm feeling it today.  To top it off, I have a softball game tonight so I'll be really feeling it tomorrow.  I've joined two softball leagues - one for work and one my sorority lil sis is on.  Apparently, (I didn't realize this) it's hard to find girls that play softball, especially girls that are good.  I guess I never thought about it.  I guess I'm a commodity.. ha ha

Free your heart from hatred.  2. Free your mind from worries.  3. Live simply.  4. Give more.  5. Expect less.

       While yesterday was a day full of meetings and Orientation, today is much calmer.  I can actually blog without feeling guilty at work.  So this last weekend that passed was definitely memorable, both for my bf and I and for myself.    Let's start with Jorge and I.  Friday, I met his parents for the first time, as well as some family that was visiting from Taiwan.  After picking them up at SFO, I drove them back to Fremont, where his parents greeted us as we drove into their driveway.  What a way to meet parents right? At least they were distracted from the actual act of it, since they were anxiously awaiting the family members from Taiwan. As we made it into the house, Jorge's mom starts flagging me down to look at a picture of Jorge as a baby. Awww, he was soooo cute! (not as chubby as I was though!)  We all decided to grab some dinner nearby, where I sat and just absorbed it all.  Sometimes I wish the whole world spoke the same language.  (Then there's times I'm ecstatic I can say something in another language and have no one understand me but the person I'm speaking to. ha ha) Anyway, based on such a short visit, I now know where Jorge gets his gentle, caring nature.  Sunday was our 1 month celebration, even though it was technically Monday (the 28th).  After I lagged a ton getting ready for dinner, we were finally off to  urlLink Tommy Toy's  for dinner and can i just tell you how fantastic dinner was... I almost had to be carried out because I ate so much.  They have something they call their  urlLink "Signature Dinner Menu"  that Jorge ordered for the both of us with foie gras added to it as an appetizer.  Oh gawd! It was practically orgasmic! So by the time dinner was over, we were in a rush to head to the Orpheum Theatre to see  urlLink Phantom of the Opera .  It was Jorge's favorite broadway show and it was my first time seeing it.  True love in the end does conquer all.  I teared in the end, almost cried I should say.  It was beautiful and I couldn't see myself with anyone else.    That brings me to why this weekend was so memorable for myself.  For such a long time, I always thought I was going to grow old by myself.  After failed relationships and trying so hard, I just gave up.  I stopped looking for love and I accepted the fact that if I never fell in love with someone so deeply to marry him, then I wouldn't marry.  I wouldn't settle for anything less than that.  I even told my parents I didn't think they were going to have any grandchildren from me, because I really imagined being on my own.  I loved having my friends and they were enough for me to be happy. I remember specifically in church one day.  I prayed to God, telling him that whatever he planned for me, I was okay with.  If he thought it was right for me, I'd trust his judgement and not question it.  It was the same thing I prayed for when I was job hunting.  I left my whole life up to him and stopped questioning my shortcomings.  This weekend, I said something to Jorge I never imagined saying to someone.  I imagined a life with him and growing old with him.  (I'm getting emotional just writing this.)  I let all traces of my wall down and I gave him everything I had. I have never ever felt so connected to someone ever. Everything I ever questioned or doubted in myself, I let go of, and he accepted me and loved me in return for everything I am.  This is how it should be.  This is  my fairy tale   happening in real time.

       It seems as if I have so much to empty out of my head right now since it's been a crazy week...  Let's start with last weekend.  Saturday was a full day of softball for a charity tournament my old softball team recruited me for.  Of all things, you'd think I'd go home to pass out but instead I drove over to Danville/San Ramon to meet up with Francey for a long awaited dinner with her.  The Blackhawk Grill was soooo yummy! (Too bad I can't find a damn link to the Blackhawk Grill's menu!)  I started Sunday with going to church.  I hadn't been enough lately, and was in need of some free therapy.  A surprise to me was that Jorge wanted to see what Catholic church was like so he came along.  Most people that know me know that I usually on go to church with family these days so taking him along with me was a pretty big thing to me.   (Back in college, i went with my dorm buddies and friends.) It was definitely nice having him next to me, but we'll see.  We then headed to De Anza College for his track meet.  Can I just tell u?? My baby kicked some major @ss in all the events he was in.  5 events. 5 golds.  Some of it was a team effort so you've got to imagine how fast they all were.  I'm so proud of him!   So by this point, after two full days of being out in the scorching heat, I noticed I was pretty dark.  My brother's gf was quick to point it out to me too, in her disturbingly odd bluntness.  Can u say TACT? okay, tangent...sorry!   With the new work week starting, I knew I would be finding out if I was going full time with my Google contractor job.  I was expecting the news to hit on Tues and to tell u the truth, I was pretty much paranoid.  Just like anything else, I was freaking out that I had the possibility of losing something I grew really attached to.  I like my team. I like my job.  I love Google.  I love the free food and t-shirts. ha ha I found out Monday afternoon from Eric that we all got hired full time.  Good timing coz I was at Jorge's house veggin out.  *cabbage patch* *dancing* *jumping up and down* *GIDDY TINE*   Jorge suggested a celebration dinner that night, but my mom was visiting so he was a sweetheart and invited her too.  Mind you, this is the first time they were meeting, so Jorge went all out.  Bouquets of flowers for the both of us (I got a balloon too!) as well as a night of Jorge being so polite and gentlemanly. (He's always like that but still, it's around my mom!) To backtrack, I'll explain my mom.  She's pretty high maintenance.  My dad pampers her and lets her get away with anything.  She's the most impossible person in the world to please.  I think at one point in her life she was hormonally imbalanced.  OKay, maybe i'm a lil harsh, but you get my point.  She's not one to be openly friendly to someone, especially if it's a guy that's supposedly "courting" me.  By the end of a night of lots of conversation and a full tummy at Capellini's, we were driven home. A nice surprise at the end was that my mom invited him up but he said he needed to get home and that we should rest.  My mom had nothing but nice and great things to say about Jorge.  So, for an impossible woman to please, Jorge kicked some butt yet again.  *mwah* +1,000,000 brownie points.    As for work, I start full time on Monday. We got our fulltime offer letters on Tues, on Dad and Tatay's bday.  We have Orientation as a newbie and we'll be formally introduced to the company as new hires.  I have to think of one interesting fact about myself.  I have benefits. I'm an official Googler now.  yipeeee! Hmmm...   One random thought... where in the world is my best friend Sisca... ha ha she's MIA

       I was reading an old blog of mine earlier and noticed a question I asked myself about a year ago...though I never seemed to answer it...    Are you running from something or to something?     When I compare the time of when I originally asked myself this question to the present, I definitely think it's two very distinct ends of the spectrum.  A year ago, I was running away from everything that had any importance to me.  Don't ask me why.  Maybe I was completely fed up of being the "responsible" one in my family.  Maybe I just didn't want to care for once.  Maybe I just had no clue where the hell I was going anymore.  All I know was that i was neglecting everything of importance to me.    Currently, if you asked me this question, I'll tell you that I'm running to something, though I have idea where I'm running to.  I think that's fair.  I can admit to myself that for once, I have a clue as to what I'm running to, but the specifics are still being worked out.  It's much better than a year ago, but not where I was coming out of college.  I have a little bit of work to catch up on, though I am very content.  Actually, I take that back...i'm ecstatic! Patience is definitely working for me, as slowly things are falling into place.  It's just a matter of time.    ....Supporting friends and family, a guy I'm completely in love with, a stable job I love coming to every day, finally happy with myself (ok, maybe besides the tummy and lack of exercise! ha ha), a therapeautical unconditional relationship with God, and to top it all off (disclaimer: this is my superficial side talking... ), I finally got around to ordering Season 4 of Sex in the City on DVD! ha ha okay, that last aspect is just my dorky side coming out...u know what i mean... happy day!

       I forgot I wrote this in my journal while JC was on vacation...   ~~ I've laid in my bed the past few nights with thoughts of you in my mind... Holding onto your voice along with the last kiss you left behind.    I've worn you shirt the past few nights... to pretend you were lying next to me. Holding me close, engulfed in your warmth- I close my eyes and it's your smile I see.  I've been wondering the past few nights.. where such strong feelings have come from. It's only been a short time & my heart and mind have been in a constant fight.  It's already been a few nights.. no need for anymore thinking. Soon you'll be in my arms... no need for anymore missing.  ~~

       It seems like it's been a while since I've updated my blog - a whirlwind of emotions, happenings and discovery in the last few weeks.... err..,I should actually correct that... the last 12 days to be exact.  The last time I wrote on this was 4th of july and woah, did we make our own fireworks!   I met him a little under a year ago, and I didn't think anything of it.  I was shooting pool and my friends kept trying to sell me on going on a date with this guy - they told me about all these superficial accomplishments. (ie: CK Model, tv shows,etc)  I'm thinking to myself... Whoopdefreakinwhoo...am I supposed to jump at it?  Where's the damn substance?   So standing right next to CK Model is another guy.  The guys identified him as another available guy I should talk to - he's getting his MBA at Stanford, blah blah blah.  So right off the bat, my blunt self says,  Knowing me, I'd pick the brains over the looks ...*points at Stanford boy*  I told my guy friend later on that I wasn't interested in either one, as I was just starting to date someone else.      It's a year later...and who would have thought... my instincts were correct from a year ago.. I found someone with the biggest heart in the whole world.  I admire the crap out of him - the more I hang out with him, the more I realize how much I'm in love with him.  People always tell me that your partner in life is supposed to be someone that grows with you...someone that complements you.  (For as long as I can remember, I always thought I'd never find this person.  I'd always be my independent, self driven self.  I didn't need anyone to take care or me, nor push me to do anything.  I looked to my close friends for that. ) For someone who thought she had a pretty big heart, I never thought I'd meet someone that thought the same way I did.  I've never been so inspired to be a better person.     Reality Check   It's been less than a month and I've realized that I've never felt this way ever in my life.  A girl friend of mine the other night said I was glowing. What's going on?! This has NEVER happened this fast in my life and for once, I'm actually okay with it.  I haven't ran the other direction.  I haven't made myself really busy to avoid any kind of confrontation.  I've told him a lot of things I've always been scared to tell a significant other, in fear that he'd look at me differently.  For once, I'm not in full control of the relationship.  Basically, I've left myself completely vulnerable to him.   Another reality check    WTF am I doing?    Part of me is deathly scared of what's to come... part of me is completely ecstatic - I always told myself I couldn't wait til this certain point in my life came.  It all had to be perfect, and if it worked the way I always dreamt it to be, then I couldn't wait! It's slowly getting there, and all I can tell myself and JC is to slow down.

       from an old Xanga post.... reposting it ? is that bad blog etiquette? ha ha   As mentioned in my entry yesterday...chivalry and romance...  The world seriously lacks chivalry and romance ... whatever happened to guys trying to "court" girls?? Maybe I'm just meeting guys that are so jaded they forget to romance a girl in the beginning...   Let's start from my upbringing... strict Catholic Filipino family...I was always reminded that a guy should always be very gentleman like with you...open doors, walk you to the car, greet your parents if he ever came over, stay in the living room so that we could talk there, sometimes make it to the family room to watch tv or the patio to get some sunshine... he always watched over you to make sure you were okay and knew how to make u smile...he knew how to make u forget that he was a guy only thinking of one thing...ha ha  I remember my first bf... I met him through my sorority big sis...I was on winter break at the time and working at the mall... he came by every day to visit me and sometimes even brought me something small... one time it was a rose..another time it was a care package...another day he brought me to lunch... it was all so cute... none of this let's hook up crap... our first date was to watch a movie and grab some dinner... in my young naive state at the time, the giddiness engulfed me... i still remember our first kiss- where i was, how i was feeling, how his cologne smelled - we took our time and before i knew it he was my bf...   So where is that all now?? I don't remember anyone even remotely going through that route... usually it's "hey, let's hang out on fri night..." ...the typical dinner and drinks and whether or not this guy was going to get lucky or not that night... BLAH what happened to conversation and getting to know each other?? what happened to first, second, and third dates...the whole "be ready at 7....i'll pick you up and i have a night planned for us..."  it's all about the little things... the surprises...the warm fuzzies and butterflies in your tummy...the whole chase that leads up to the honeymoon phase if you two click...   chivalry and romance... it's what makes women weak in the knees... it's my hopeless romantic side coming out....oh gawd..ha ha am i the only one feeling this way?

       i have two guy best friends and two girl best friends.  This posting concerns my two guy best friends, as lately I'm finally catching up with the both of them a lot more.    Yesterday, I had dinner with one of them. Let's call him Texas Buddy for reference purposes. I hadn't seen Texas Buddy for 2 months and we had A LOT to catch up on- so we picked a place I had his bday dinner at 3 years ago.  A sushi place in Sunnyvale where the mgr has the loudest most obnoxious voice in the world, though he so takes care of me! As I updated him with everything going on in my life, I got the usual "be careful" lecture.  "slow down...take ur time...blah blah blah" I know for sure I'm not in a rush with anything in my life, though there's always that thought of seizing the moment.  The more I analyze something in my life, the more I forget to live in the moment.  He also updated me with his life.  I knew he moved to the South Bay, but I never knew why or where exactly.  He let me in on some news, with a really somber face.  I automatically jumped the gun and thought I was going to be an auntie.  I was wrong.  Someone in his past is just back in his life and he's living with her and her son.  They're roommates basically.  I told him it reminded me of "Ross & Rachel" from Friends.  The idea of him taking anyone home was nonexistent, and even if he did, what would he say? "Meet my roommate.  Did i forget to mention she's my ex? No, I'm not the father of this boy, though sometimes I act like it." Talk about an ice breaker!   There's my 2nd best friend now.  He's a little more complicated to explain.  Let's see.  He was my first boyfriend, my first love, my first everything.  Let's call him Peanut. (inside joke) In one of the most hardest times of my life, he welcomed me with open arms and didn't judge.  He was a friend, more than a boyfriend, at times.  He got married about 5 or 6 years ago and his wife and I get along real well.  I'm even his youngest daughter's godmother.  Today, he found me online.  He wants to talk- he needs to vent.  I offered our usual JTown excursion.  When I was laid off, we went there.  When he was laid off, we went there.  When I broke up with someone, we went there.  We always head to JapanTown to basically walk around and do nothing but vent to each other.  (We eat ,visit his favorite mag shop, and visit my fav notebook shop too!) You see, he was really happy go lucky all his life.  So many times, he almost died, but he always made it through.  Just recently, I thought I lost him when he had a stroke.  He's only 29.  When they did an MRI, they found 2 other holes in his head, meaning he had 2 other previous mild strokes.  He may have not figured it out.  He made it out of this stroke, half paralyzed and not walking.  I cried so hard when his wife called me.  I finally gathered enough courage on Easter Day to visit him in the hospital, as I could not bear to think that this once happy go lucky guy was laying there in a hospital bed.  Today, he's getting there.  He goes to rehab. He's found meaning and appreciation in lots of things he ignored in the past.  He loves his family, more than anything.  But I kind of know what he needs to vent to me about.  I don't think he's happy with his marriage, even after all the caretaking his wife did for him after his stroke.  JTown, here we come.  AGAIN.  I'm guessing here.  I hope I'm wrong.

        urlLink  Missing Basketball Player    My sister and I were watching the news the other morning when she realized that a guy that was mentioned as being missing was her classmate from high school.  She was freaking out because she used to play basketball with Pat and her high school best friend.  They were all on the basketball teams, rooting each other on.  No one's been arrested nor has my sister's friend been found.  It's all so tragic because my sister had nothing but great things to say about him Hopefully it all works out.   We'll have to say a prayer for him.    ~~~  On a happier note, I came into work today only to find an email from my friend. There was a grin on my face, ear to ear, by the end of the email.  To top it off, he called after lunch to say hi.  I so didn't want to get off the phone, but work called and he was about to be stuck in food coma....which brings me to one of my random thoughts...    the little things...     Let's backtrack a little... I grew up in a very strict Catholic family.  I attended Catholic school all of grammar school and all of high school.  I came home before it was dark every day, and I was obedient to everything my parents ever told me (no matter how much I wanted to rebel).  In short, I think I was very sheltered from reality.  It was a naive innocence where I pretty much trusted everyone around me, because there was never any reason not to.  I appreciated all the "little" things that friends did for me and I couldn't be any more content.    The minute I went to college, it was the biggest culture shock of my life.  Literally, I grew up overnight. (Another story for another day) All the vices got thrown at me.  I started staying out later than usual.  I had to learn about everything on my own, without parents nagging at me about right and wrong.  In a way, I lost my naive innocence about the world - both a good and bad thing.  Before I knew it, I was leaving for Texas and moving back to California after a year.  More learning.  The next few years I worked in the dot com boom of California.  I became this self centered, high maintence bitch that took everything and everyone for granted.  No one could have bothered me, because I was invincible.  I bought a house, I had my friends, and I partied hard all the time.  Who cares if I was awake for 36 hours and totally unhealthy.  So, when everything's great and you feel like you're flying high, where else can you go? The only way from there is down... I got laid off in 2002 and the telecom industry went straight down.  No more rockstar life - I thought I was going to sell my house.  I hid from my friends coz I didn't want to talk about being unemployed.  I hid from my parents so that I didn't have to hear about my shortcomings from being unemployed. I hit complete rock bottom, both financially and emotionally.  My "path" disappeared. My "vision" was gone and I was a complete mess.  I shut a lot of people out of my life.   I started smoking again, a lot.      Talk about chaos....    It's a year later, and with a ton of persistence and support from my friends and family, it's slowly falling back into place.  No more substances.  No more horrible vices.  I picked up rock climbing and I found a job I really like.  I have a group of friends that care for me as much as I care for them. I still have my house.  Did I mention I love my house? I met someone that makes me giddy.  We're just friends, and it's really new, but damn, I love getting to know him.  I see my family a lot more these days.  I have time to sit there and read or I actually get to sleep in now.  I don't go out as often, unless it's to catch up with friends.  I'm being healthier with what I eat. I'm writing more and I actually want to write in my journal.  I got an email this morning that made me so happy I wanted to cry.  I got a phone call this afternoon that's making me smile ear to ear.  A kiss. His smile. Giddiness.   I'm inspired.     I can go on and on about the little things that are driving me nuts right now.  I'm floating.  For once, I feel okay and happy.  I'm not stressing about what I have to do or where I'm going.  I just know it's going to be okay.  I'm back to the naive innocence of everything.  Gawd, I love the little things.

       An email was sent out today from one of the engineers, quoting an article where  urlLink Charlie  (included in benefits @ Google), was mentioned in....  "Everybody in Silicon Valley seems to be talking about Charlie the gourmet cook at Google who used to work for Jerry Garcia. I can tell you, the food is spectacular even by Michelin standards, not just corporate cafeteria standards. Because the food in  the company cafeteria is so good, people don't leave work to eat. They eat with their colleagues, which increases learning and communication.  They get back to work within half an hour, making them more productive. They feel like Google cares about them, making them more loyal."  ... and you wonder why I've gained some weight since I started working @ Google...

        It's Thursday and I still can't believe I didn't write about last weekend...  Jorge finally met my whole (extended too!) family.  He brought a  urlLink fresh fruit cake  from one of my favorite bakeries, Sheng Kee.  It was a big hit and so was Jorge's stories.  My uncle manage to finally track him down towards the middle of the afternoon and so I left them for a few minutes so that they could talk and get to know each other.  Before I knew it, my uncle had busted out the  urlLink Remy XO  and he started pouring drinks.  What he didn't know was that Jorge had a little too much Remy to drink in Vegas a few weeks prior.   The smell of it made him nautious, though he sat there and took it.  What a sport! By the end of the evening, all I heard my uncle saying was that Jorge needed to golf with him or visit Manila with him.  Good sign right?    Last night, I was pleasantly surprised with a little mini roadtrip.  I was treated to some yummy dessert, followed with a mission to find a glimpse of  urlLink Mars .   Although, the moon isn't visible near it anymore, we still went.  The darkest place around here is Half Moon Bay, but little did we know that it was overcast.  I was disappointed to think that I wouldn't be able to see it so off we went to Woodside from Highway 1 thinking it would be better there.  Overcast too.  By this point, I was carsick from all the turns.  We called it a failed mission and headed to 280 for home and guess what?     Another surprise!  It was clear as could be and I knew exactly where to go.  Right near my parent's house and near  urlLink Filoli Gardens , it was pitch black. (Why didn't I think of this before?) We got out of the car and there it was. I headed home with a big smile on my face, probably as bright as Mars last night.  Mission accomplished.

       Today was the 2nd day in a row that I had to deal with some damn annoying @ss driver on the way to work....imagine this....  You're driving down 101 with the music playing and you're singing one of your favorite songs *la la la*.  You've got this great attitude to start they day cause the sun's out and you've got a good night's sleep.  When out of the blue, the idiot in front of you decides to stomp on his brakes... as if there's this huge traffic jam in front of him that he wasn't prepared for.  You look forward, to see past his car for anything that would have caused him to break so suddenly.  There's nothing in front of him, but a car about 20 feet in front of him, probaly singing his/her way to work too.  The fool even waved at me as to say sorry, when I passed him up.  What causes idiotic drivers to do that?!?  When I started to learn how to drive, I remember my uncle always telling me to avoid having to hit your brakes on the freeway, unless it was traffic time (or in this case where you're following an idiot).  He told me to take my foot off the accelerator and I'd slow down on my own...  *vent*   So, tomorrow's a new day.  I hope it's not 3 days in a row... *cross fingers*

       Last night, I went to a work dinner at the  urlLink Thomas Fogarty Winery  on Skyline. I've lived in the bay area practically all my life, and never once did I know that such a beautiful place existed so close to me.  I always thought you had to head to Napa for the wine country, when literally it's in my backyard (actually my parent's ha ha).  I took some pretty crazy directions off of Mapquest and ended up going through the mountain rather than around it on Woodside to Skyline.  Instead I ended up going for what seemed forever (i think it was only 3 miles though) on Old La Honda Rd.  At one point, I thought my car would slide off the mountain or run into an oncoming car with the sharp blind curves to the road.  Luckily I made it to Skyline and found the winery, although I was half an hour late.    At the dinner, after some wine tasting, we listened to the awards being given out and ate to our heart's content.  Yummy food.  After all was said and done, they passed out some pretty nifty  urlLink Timbuk2 commuter bag , in every color in the world.  Of course, being me, I grabbed a red one.  woohoo! it's padded and everything!   I also met some folks from the NY and Europe offices, and most of them kept mentioning that we needed to do an internal Blogger training, so I offered in person training.  I mentioned that we had a full team that would be more than happy to fly to NY or Europe to do some training.  They laughed and shot my idea down, and instead suggested a training via conference call.  Damn, it was worth a shot. ha ha  Lastly, the highlight of the evening.  I introduced myself to the CEO,  urlLink Eric Schmidt .  To my surprise, he recognized who I was, since he approved my job offer pretty recently.  I gave him a quick rundown and also mentioned we were addressing a lot of his concerns, so that put a smile on his face.  Overall, he was very down to earth and very welcoming.  It felt good to feel like I was someone to him, as he was very aware of what was going on in our team.  I wasn't just another face in the crowd to him...even if I only did speak to him for a few minutes.  (Correction to the article I linked to:  Google's based in Mountain View, CA...although it does include a snapshot of Mr. Schmidt)

       A friend of mine was IMing with me the other day, and I made a note to myself to blog about something he was talking to me about... let me backtrack to the context of the conversation.    We were talking about clubbing and bar hopping..something like that... about how guys can look at girls and think to themselves... "She's out of my league..."  Is there such a thing? It's a certain pedestal you put a girl you don't even know on, hindering you from even approaching the girl to ask her to dance or even say hello, that he was talking about.  ( I know I should have just cut and paste the IM convo but damn, I didn't think about it til later on!) He also went on to say that a girl can look at a guy and already know whether she'll give him a second to even say anything, let alone a glance.  In his mind, he psyches himself out to see a girl he thinks is attractive because right away he's thinking, will she give me a second or is she completely out of my league? Do I even get a smile?   So here's my thoughts for guys...  I don't refer to the barrier between two people meeting each other as a certain 'league'.  To me, I don't judge right off the bat and I don't categorize a guy  right away .  The score is even up until there's some sort of initial greeting - it could be a glance, a smile, a wink, even a hello.  The score to me could change,however,  depending on how that initial greeting was delivered.  When you're in a club/bar/social setting where alcohol is usually involved and you see a girl you're attracted to, don't bust out your stupid lines.  Don't refer to her as "hey baby" and don't give her some total slimeball look (you know what i'm talking about...the look that you're totally undressing her in your mind in those few seconds).  Right off the bat, she definitely will judge and she will  automatically be out of your league.  Smile as if you're just being nice.  You see people every day in the street, in the hallway at work, at a store, etc.  Usually, you just smile, right? You're just being a nice person.  Think of it that way.  Also, there's a time and place for everything.  If you're in a club and you're purely out there to be superficially attracted to someone, then by all means, don't listen to what I'm saying.  Be as judgemental as you'd like.  That's a game in itself that applies to both sexes.  But,  in the situation that you actually do want to meet some genuinely sincere person, think of the place you're going to.  It's a club/bar.  People have alcohol in their systems and you have no clue about a person u meet there. The only reason you met this person was because he/she spotted you across the room, and thought you were attractive.   So what?   As I always say, "Looks only last for so long.."  (My rebuttal: "Where's the substance?? Can you have a normal, intellectual conversation with me, without being intimidated by me? Feed my brain!! " *thinking* Although a tall, cute guy with a nice smile is some damn cool gravy to top it off! ha ha)    There is no league, and if there even was anything close to it, it's all your mindset.  A guy doesn't have to be out of my league, but he can definitely intimidate me and put me in a state of awe by his intelligence and every day manner just by a few minutes of talking to him.  (Also, u can ask yourself, "I wonder if he's even telling me the truth", but that's another story to blog about)    Number one example... my bf.  Not out of my league, but his intelligence, drive and inspiring character intimidates the shet outta me.

       After a few episodes (okay, maybe more than a few) of  urlLink Sex in the City  (4th season), I've come to realize something.  I guess I've known this for a long time but all along, I've never really accepted it until now.  I've trained myself all these years to depend on only myself.  Most people say I'm very independent.  I do things in my own quirky way and I'm used to that.  Being a middle child, I'm used to picking up after my brother and sister.  When both of them didn't want to do anything, my mom automatically assumed I'd pick up the slack and I was okay with that.  I liked making sure everything was okay and in a way, I think it made me grow up a lot more.  One of my best guy friends, Bill, always tells me I'm an old soul.  I think he first said that when I met him in Austin.  So, is this a good thing or a bad thing?    My biggest fear of ever depending on anyone else, but myself, is that I'll get used to it.  I'll look for it and ultimately, I'll feel helpless.  The worst part that would eat away at me....is that I wouldn't have control of the moment or of how I feel.    It's kinda scary that I can't control how I feel right now...

       After a weekend in the middle of the week, I'm officially tired and restless.  Oakland As game yesterday with Zachary's pizza afterwards.  Bowling, lunch, the Exploratorium, and dinner today.    Otherwise, I'm just plain bummed out.  I got into a car accident yesterday and fortunately, no one was hurt.  There was a child in the car though and he was really shaken up so I was freaking out that I might have hurt him.  Luckily, he had a big smile a bit later on and said he was okay.  The driver/father said he was okay too.    Today I got a call from my dad who spoke with our insurance agent.  The driver (his name is Bob) reported the accident  along with a report of injury.   How bogus is that.

       Happy Birthday Francey!!! *sings obnoxiously to you*    I finally have time to sit here and think about what I want to write.  Napa was sooo beautiful, and being around my friends meant the most to me.  All in all, there were 9 of us that went - mah baby, Sisca, Mykee, Debs, Marc, Alan, Alice, and Vivian.  After meeting up in Emeryville to caravan up, Marc and Mykee thought it would be a good idea to start with sake tasting.  We ended up at  urlLink Hakusan Sake Gardens .  Because of that place, I think my sake standards have gone up.  Then again, when you don't know anything about sake, I guess it has to go up right?  Something interesting I learned was that there was a huge difference with warmed and chilled sake. Quality sake always has to be chilled, thus to preserve the taste of the sake.  Mediocre sake is always warmed, as to evaporate and cover up the poor taste  So from now on, it's chilled sake for me!  As we went further inland, our next stop was in Yountville at a winery called  urlLink Domaine Chandon , specializing in sparkling wine.  Although there was a 40 minute tour where we'd be able to tour the grounds, all our tummies grumbled so after a couple of tastings and a ton of picture taking, we were off to our last stop,  urlLink V Sattui .   V Sattui was recommended by Marc, as it had picnic grounds, a huge gourmet deli, and most importantly, complimentary wine tasting.  After tasting all the samples in the deli and doing more than a few wine tastings, our tummies were satisfied with yummy barbeque, snacks, and a couple bottles of wine.    We lost all track of time and before we knew it, it was time to head home as people had other plans in the group.  All in all, I came home with 2 bottles of sake (Napa and Plum Sake), 1 bottle of sparkling wine from Chandon, 1 bottle of Napa Valley white wine, some cream cheese with artichokes, and a jar of Sake Wasabi Mustard for my brother.  Not bad for a few hours of wine tasting!  Thanks, Sisca, for putting this together!!! You're the best!!

       My hunt for cool housemate(s) is now officially over.  Welcome  urlLink Kaibin ! The second housemate is named Diana (not sure if that's how you spell it yet) but she's not scheduled to move in until mid October.    As for the weekend, I don't even know where to start as it was a verrrry long weekend. Here's the short story:  * Fri night: Cleaned and packed the office closet up * Sat morning: drove up to Napa to go wine tasting * Sat afternoon/night: cleaned out the rest of the office and moved it all over to the master * Sun morning: cleaned and packed some more, took off to  SF for Now & Zen to see Duran Duran * Sun evening: staff meeting at PG, helped Kaibin and the guys move more stuff in, more odds and ends.    In short, I'm plain tuckered out.  So tired that I can't even put any thought into this post.  This week will be hell with Phase 2 of moving next weekend.  Any volunteers?

She's the best!!! *big smile*  I feel like I'm in high school all over again!

       Tomorrow is my bday and it's not the same this year.  I think I've been saying that every year after I turned 25.  There's no age to look forward to anymore! At least with 25, you got to rent a car and even have discounted car insurance.  After 25, what's left besides turning 30? (Damn, that's soon approaching!)  So as I get older, I realize more and more that being younger was a lot more fun. The games weren't as involved and complicated. The music was so much better and not so "bumpin n grindin' type as it is now.  Atari rocked (it still does by the way!) and getting lost in my backyard down the hill was enough to keep me entertained for the afternoon.  WWF was a lot more exciting - none of this damn soap opera crap as now. I wanted to be a Solid Gold dancer. 80s movies, Jake Ryan, The Goonies.    I could go on forever and ever, but you all know what I mean. Tomorrow's another day for me.  I'm just happy to be where I am, be with the people I care about most, to be healthy, and do what it is that makes me happy.

       Why does it seem that I'm only updating my blog once a week... how sad.  Last week was pretty hectic now that I think of it, especially after I was recovering from Yosemite and catching up with work.  In short, here's some highlights from this weekend... * met Gary & Maria finally (Jorge's really good church friends) * Fri/Sat QT time with Francey & Terri (dinner with Carlos' family for his mom's bday, lunch at a french cafe and wandering around Blackhawk Plaza, boba, wandering around Danville/Pleasanton * Jon & Heather's wedding - absolutely beautiful and perfect! * totally last minute Giants game in SF on Sunday & a slice of my favorite cake (thanks babe!)   My brother just told me today he's moving on Tuesday. After waiting a few days for his new place to be painted, he's moving the big stuff... meaning I get to move all my stuff as soon as I clean up the master bedroom.  fun fun fun.  I'm still on this hunt for (a) housemate(s).  Anyone know really cool, laid back, drama free people looking to rent two rooms in San Mateo? Here's the highlights I included in the email to my friends... (I forgot to mention cable!)  * Bay Meadows development in San Mateo (centrally located on the peninsula to 101,92,and 280) * walking distance to Whole Foods, numerous restaurants, Starbucks, Pete's coffee, library and gym * ~ 1360 sq. ft townhouse - 3 BR/2.5 Bath (3 floors with bedrooms on the top floor) * 2 1/2 years old * DSL/wired ethernet to each room * fully applianced kitchen with corian countertops * hardwood floors on 2nd floor, carpet on 1st and 3rd floors * washer/dryer * central AC/heating * fully furnished house, excluding bedrooms * 2 car garage (1 spot optional for extra charge) * $750/month (open to negotiation) including all utilities, except long distance phone calls   One last thing... bday's soon approaching.  I'm so not excited.

                This will be a super short entry as I'm about to pass out from a very exhausting and challenging, yet inspiring weekend in Yosemite.  It was a weekend I learned about myself.   My life should be  just like the hike I took in  urlLink Yosemite Falls .  The  urlLink view   urlLink from   urlLink the top  was spectacular.  Full details in the next post... happy trails. *smile*

       It's already Wednesday and I still can't shake this sore throat I've had since this weekend in Orange County. ( urlLink Kimmy's   urlLink Froggy  invaded my throat!  ha ha ) I'm whining like a baby but I'm sure it's nothing compared to the locals living near these fires.  Once again, my heart goes out to these families affected by the wildfires.    Looking forward, this weekend should be pretty action packed starting off with Halloween.  There's a possibility for  urlLink rain  in the forecast but let's cross our fingers for all the trick or treaters. I'm actually pretty excited to pass out candy and see the lil kiddies in my neighborhood all dressed up.  Who knows what I'll do after passing out candy.. Any ideas for a Friday Halloween night?  Saturday is the  urlLink Stanford/UCLA  game and that should be pretty interesting.  My brother is a UCLA alum while my bf is a Stanford alum, and we're all sitting on the Stanford side. Imagine in a sea of cardinal red, there will be some baby blue and guess who that brave soul will be... you guessed it - my dorky brother. I think I'll stay neutral for this game.  Sunday, however, I will be a definite fan for the  urlLink Niners/Rams  game at Candlestick Park (I refuse to call it 3Com). I think my dad brainwashed us since birth to be Niners fans - anything outside of that resulted in being disowned. I heard the seats we got are completely awesome! Thanks babe for getting the tix! *mwah*

       Wow, it's Monday and I'm actually doing a full weekend recap.    This weekend I headed down to Orange County to see a very good family friend of ours get married to a really sweet girl named Susan. This was the first time I had ever met her, yet we both knew so much about each other because of Gerard constantly babbling about all the friends she hadn't met yet.    I got into LA on Friday only with my brother heading straight to his favorite place to eat in LA,  urlLink Johnnie's .  The only thing I love there are the french fries so I headed across the street to  urlLink Tito's Tacos . Super yummy hole in the wall mexican food!   There were damn long lines and by the time I finally made it up to the front and started ordering, I noticed something out of the corner of my eye.   My first blogger hoodie sighting!!   After waiting for so long in line and being a bit too far from the car to grab a camera, I saw a guy walk past us with his hoodie and a patch on the side of it with the Georgetown bulldog.  Of course, I texted  urlLink Eric  right away and chuckled to myself.    That night, I met up with some of the college friends.  I met up with Carmen, Anh, and Eric to wander a couple of the bars in Costa Mesa. Let's just say I woke up the next morning still a bit intoxicated and somehow made it to the wedding.    This wedding has to be the most tearful wedding I've been to.  The church was absolutely beautiful with a simplistic modern look to it, located in  urlLink Dana Point .  Unfortunately, due to the SoCal wildfires,  you could not see the cliffside view. However, all eyes were on the bride and groom so it didn't really matter.  In short, the reception was very interactive and activity packed.  The highlight was the first dance, sending me into tears yet again.  You could tell so much thought was put into this special day.  Congrats Gerard & Susan!   Lastly, after a weekend in a very gloomy, ash filled SoCal, my heart goes out to all the people affected by the numerous fires going on down in Southern California.  On the way back up last night, we saw some of the fires in Ventura off the 5.  The car was covered in ash and soot and my  urlLink throat  definitely paid for it. We'll have to keep these brave firefighters and the people affected in our prayers.

       In my usual pattern.. highlights from last weekend... (3 days later.. NOT BAD!)  * My honey's 10 year high school reunion at Bay Meadows * Winning a fluke bet on one of the horses - go #2!! HA! to the guy that told me that #2 wasn't going to win! * Sisca surprising my @ss at Hawaiian Drive Inn with Emmiel followed with me screaming to the top of my lungs * Jenn & Elvin's wedding / seeing all the KDPhi alums * Kingston's going away party  * Sleeping all day long on Sunday after church  and running errands * TGIF's with Alan, Sis, Emmiel, and Jorge making funny faces at the camera  It's now Wednesday and not too much has happened.  Actually, today my honey's kids (football team) won their last game .  7-0 for the whole season.  Must be the Coach... Congrats babe! *mwah*

       Finally! I woke up this morning with a full night's sleep. Thank you, Mr. Sandman. Let's hope tonight is the same way.    On a side note, peace of mind is such an assuring, warm feeling. Now I know why parents hate worrying so much.  It nearly drove me insane the last few days but I've got to admit it made me realize a few things about myself. *smile*

       Last night was another night of insomnia... lately it's getting to be more and more frequent.  As I laid there tossing and turning with my blankie, I began to think about how much my blankie has gone through with me. If my blankie could talk, it would be spitting out so many memories (now don't u all be getting any ideas).    I got blankie when I was in the kindergarten. He's one of those fuzzy brown blankets with an animal (a tiger) on it (almost every filipino family i knew of had one). I also had a grey one (my backup in case the brown one was in the laundry, but that's another story).  I remember being wrapped around in it all the time and at that time, I thought it was the biggest blanket in the world! I even made my forts with it.  Now, it's just perfect for me.  He was there when I cried and when I was happy, when I was sick and when I was freezing cold. He was even there when I fainted at my parent's house.   Hopefully, blankie will give me some pleasant sleep tonight.

       i've considered myself pretty patient...err correction... i've learned to be more patient.  This last week and especially this weekend has been pretty trying, almost as if i'm being tested.     One of my rules in life, even outside of religious sentiment is "Do unto others as you would like done to you..." (i know those aren't the exact words but u all know what i mean).  Whenever I've ever needed to make a decision, I've always asked myself, how would i feel to be on the other end of this action/decision?  For the most part, it usually works.    I know most people aren't that simple about how they live their lives, but still, isn't it common sense to be considerate of other people's feelings? Don't things work out so much better when you just talk it out and be completely honest? Whether I'm talking about my family, my bf, my housemates, my friends, etc it's just one of those things.  As you get older, you learn to empathize with people a lot more.  In my case, I'm going through this frustration where people I really care about are testing my patience.  I can't help but be mad and disappointed all at the same time.   In these cases... what do I do?  Tineybopper cleans anything and everything in site.  I cleaned the extra room in the house and made it ready to be moved into.  I cleaned out the garage and even arranged my shoes and the extra boxes in there.  I even handwashed some of my laundry! So while my laundry dries and while I sit here and figure out how to keep myself entertained, I'll just accept the fact that I have no idea what's going on right now.  Maybe it's a hint from someone up there to enjoy a lil more 'me' time.

       This last weekend, my friend, Tom, and I moved all the big stuff from my old room to my new room. (Jorge was being a princess) Being that it's been a few days now, I'm finally getting a bit more settled in and a lot more comfy.  Within these few days, I've noticed a kind of random ongoing murmur that I've never heard of in the past 2 1/2 years I've lived here.  At first I thought it was the new couple that lived next door but for some reason it just didn't seem like a sound that could come from a person.  I always heard this sound in the early morning and mid afternoon, too.      Today, I ended up having to work from home and throughout the afternoon, all I kept hearing was this really annoying type of 'coo'ing'.  After shutting my window finally, I see 3 pigeons fly right by.  *light bulb* I start thinking to myself... "Don't tell me...There's a freakin pigeon nest right outside my window.."  So, I called my brother to verify all of this (He had been living in this room the last 2 1/2 years).  His response.. "Oh, did I forget to mention your had new neighbors?... Enjoy the pigeons!"    Just my luck.

       It's already October?!? Boy does time fly.  I was watching the news this morning, only to be reminded that the  urlLink 'Do Not Call' List   for telemarketers would take effect today.  There's still a ton of stuff they're hashing out on policy but hopefully we can all say bye to those irritating telemarketers that absolutely love to call you during dinner every night.    That reminds me of a guy that called my apartment one day in SLO...  *ring ring*  me:   Hello?    guy:   Hello little girl. Is your mommy or daddy home?   me:   Umm, no. They don't live here.   guy:   Oh wow. Is your legal guardian there?   me:   Umm, no. I don't have a legal guardian.   guy:   Well, who do you live with then?   me:   That's really none of your business.   guy:   Well who takes care of you then?   me:   Excuse me?   guy:   Umm, can I ask you how old you are?   me:   I'm 22, you jack@ss.     guy:   Oh! Well , I'm Joe Schmoe and I was wondering if you'd be interested in subscribing to the San Jose Mercury News.     me:   Hell no.  *click*   HaHa... I always think of that story when I think of telemarketers.  Say bye bye to annoying telemarketers today!!

       At lunch today, we were all talking about really random stuff and the topic of what women and men could do came up. No, it was not a chauvanistic type of conversation, either!   At one point, I blurted out that women couldn't be sushi chefs.  Based on some article I read a while back, it said that women couldn't handle raw fish because they would ruin the freshness of the fish due to the temperature of their hands.  Til today, I thought that this theory made sense to me. (In my case, I can't wear gold rings because I end up melting it into odd shapes over time, but that's another story for another day.)   I decided to locate this article via a Google search only to find that some news sites charged for searching archived articles. No luck! Argh!  I did happen to find a couple of  urlLink message boards  and even an  urlLink article  on a chef's opinion:   Also, Lee says, "Women have higher temperatures than men." That translates to trouble when the food being handled is raw fish. "That's why we clean our hands with a damp towel," Lee says. "To keep the temperature down."  And, Lee says of women, "They use perfume and oil in their hair, and sometimes, when cooking, they might touch their hair and that smell will get in the food."  For the most part, a majority of the articles clarified that this once thought to be true theory was in fact invalid.  So, to the  urlLink Goldtoe  himself, I guess I was wrong!

        Friday:  urlLink  Angelex Technologies  Kickoff party This was a huge success in my eyes, as most of the interns, friends and family showed up to support the new office in Berkeley.  Congrats babe!    Saturday:  The Big Game So I guess I'm not a huge college football (or even sports) fan til lately.  It started with the  urlLink Stanford/UCLA  football game I went to and continues to watching the Big Game.  I didn't know what that was until watching it at Sneakers Sports Bar in San Carlos.  It's the annual football game right before Thanksgiving Stanford and UC Berkeley have and from what Jorge said, Stanford kicks major butt.  This year, unfortunately, Stanford lost to Berkeley's offense. I swear, since I've been following Stanford games, the more I realize that their coach sucks with passing plays. Argh. How frustrating!  Also, I went to dinner with my family for my brother's official bday dinner.  We went to a new restaurant really close to my house called Penang Garden, serving Malaysian/Singaporean/Indonesian food.  Definitely a must try! It's close, but definitely not up to  urlLink Banana Leaf  standards.  Mmmm.. On a side note, I still hate coconut.    Sunday:   Lots and lots of sleep! I finally woke up and grabbed some dinner before watching the movie, urlLink  Love Actually.   *swoon* That was such a cute, 'put you in the Xmas mood' type of movie! It's not as chick flick as I expected it to be.  It was hilarious and very recommended. Check it out!  And today... Happy Birthday to my grandmother (she passed away almost 10 yrs ago) and to my cousin, Adrian (he's 6 today)!

       I commute to Mountain View from San Mateo every day to go to work and every time I think I have the routine down, something always throws me off.  I've already figured out that you never drive south on 101 until after 8:45am... leaving at 8am usually takes around 40 minutes while leaving at 8:45am takes about 25 minutes... Also, heading home anytime before 7pm to go north on 101 is just as bad, especially right when Woodside starts.    Last week, I had a presentation to give at 9am... I left my house at 8am thinking I'd still have a few minutes to relax before the presentation.  I got to work at 9:05am.  Did I forget to mention that my commute is 15.34 miles long? (based on  urlLink MapQuest )  Today, I worked from home in the morning, had some lunch and then headed to work.  Around lunchtime on 101 up until about 3pm, it's usually a breeze.  Not Today! Some truck stalled and had police helping him out, forcing them to close one lane down. It was close to an hour before I got into work.    I live right on 101 in San Mateo and work is right near 101 in Mountain View... do I have any other options besides taking El Camino Real all the way down?  Argh...

        Something I read in  urlLink Cliff's  blog...    Hotter than Hades      A thermodynamics professor had written a take home exam for his graduate students. It had one question:  "Is Hell exothermic (gives off heat) or endothermic (absorbs heat)? Support your answer with a proof."  Most of the students wrote proofs of their beliefs using Boyle's Law (gas cools off when it expands and heats up when it is compressed) or some variant.  One student, however, wrote the following: First, we need to know how the mass of Hell is changing in time. So, we need to know the rate that souls are moving into Hell and the rate they are leaving. I think that we can safely assume that once a soul gets to Hell, it will not leave. Therefore, no souls are leaving. As for how many souls are entering Hell, let's look at the different religions that exist in the world today.  Some of these religions state that if you are not a member of their religion, you will go to Hell. Since there are more than one of these religions and since people do not belong to more than one religion, we can project that all people and all souls go to Hell. With birth and death rates as they are, we can expect the number of souls in Hell to increase exponentially.  Now, we look at the rate of change of the volume in Hell because Boyle's Law states that in order for the temperature and pressure in Hell to stay the same, the volume of Hell has to expand as souls are added. This gives two possibilities.  #1 If Hell is expanding at a slower rate than the rate at which souls enter Hell, then the temperature and pressure in Hell will increase until all Hell breaks loose.  #2 Of course, if Hell is expanding at a rate faster than the increase of souls in Hell, then the temperature and pressure will drop until Hell freezes over. So which is it? If we accept the postulate given to me by Ms. Laura Turner during my Freshman year, "That it will be a cold night in Hell before I sleep with you," and take into account the fact that I still have not succeeded in having sexual relations with her, then #2 cannot be true, and so Hell is exothermic.  The student got the only A.

       Growing up with my brother, I was forced to watch WWF (now WWE) and actually ended up liking it.  Like I said, I was the guinea pig for new WWF moves they featured on TV.  For some reason I dug on the tag team duo with the hot pink pants, esp the guy with the longer wavy hair.  For some damn reason, it's slipping my mind.  I have a feeling it was Brett 'the hitman" Heart though... Anyway, I still remember all the wrestlers from Hulk Hogan to Roddy Rod Piper or even Jimmy the Fly Snuka and even Andre the Giant.   I can't forget Kamala the Ugandan Giant or even the Iron Shiek.  Anyway, WWE these days isn't as fun as it used to be. There isn't the intensity of the new moves.  Remember when the figure four was first used or even when Jake the Snake came out with all his new moves... DDT i think?   There's even all this new drama with  urlLink Vince McMahon's  family taking over or betraying the family... and when in the world did we think that Vince McMahon could go from ringside announcer to the damn chairman of WWF?   And you wonder why  urlLink Mean Gene  didn't do anything as big.  Then again, I wouldn't know because I haven't been watching.    It's funny that I still remember all of this and that I still remember the crazy stuff my brother and I used to watch.  What's even more of a trip now though is that one of his college friends just signed with WWE.  I met him as  urlLink Spermie  and he pledged with my brother for the same fraternity down in LA.  The craziest thing I saw him do was order the biggest cut of prime rib at  urlLink Lawry's  during my brother's going away dinner, only to be still hungry and ask for seconds.  He was huge then, but according to my brother, he's completely massive now. From the little I know of him, he's a big teddy bear.  Though, WWE would make you think twice.

          It's all gloomy and dark outside and it looks like it's about to rain. (I'll have to think about going to yoga or running tonight) Actually weather.com says it'll  urlLink rain  this weekend. My brother's supposed to have a bbq with his gf for both of their 30th birthdays so hopefully they're wrong.     Speaking of my brother, it's a trip that my brother's gonna be 30.  The picture here L-->R is Mel (my brother), Gina (his gf), and Tommyboy (our 'adopted' brother).  I can still remember when used to make me his guinea pig for the newest WWF wrestling moves.  The best would have to been putting me into a DDT hold and slamming my head into the ground. Or was it using the corner of the bed as a turnbuckle and slamming my head into it? Naw, it had to be when he'd take our younger sister as his 'tag team' partner and launch her up into the air and throw her onto me.   It was even better when we played video games.  If you remember  urlLink Colecovision , you had to remember how much fun playing Donkey Kong was.  We always played for hours and waited for each other to die so that we could have our own turns.  It got to the point where we'd try to psyche each other out by jumping from each moving lever to the next and what he did had to be the funniest now that I look back at it.  He would sing the chorus of this song by  urlLink Billy Ocean  called 'When the Going Gets Tough' and it would drive me nuts.  I completely forgot that he had done this until I heard the song on the radio last year and couldn't figure out why it was making me laugh.  I called my brother to let him hear it and all I got in return was a bunch of laughter on his end.  Gawd, we were stupid.  One day, I should write a book about all the stupid things my brother used to do to me.  What I've said is nothing compared to some others.  I was a pretty gullible idiot growing up.  Ha Ha.  All in all, time flies. There were the three of us that grew up with my childhood best friend, Deanna. Now that's she's married and expecting, and with my brother's bday coming up soon, it's another reminder that we've all come a long way.

          I finally made it back to the gym last night to do some indoor rock climbing, after a very long hiatus. Gawsh, I so missed the feel of climbing! Of course I was a little hesitant and scared at first to do some of the climbs, but after I pushed myself a bit more, it all came back to me - almost like what they say about riding a bike.  You never forget.  Jorge was kickin some butt too and even if he says he's 'jungle climbing', I still think he's come a long way from the first time he climbed (when this picture was taken).       Climbing last night also made me kind of nostalgic and sad. I used to go a few times a week with Sisca and we always knew how to push each other.  I know she'll only be gone for a while but dang, I didn't think her being in Utah would bum me out so much.

       After watching Matrix Reloaded today, I finally remembered the dude's name... MIFUNE!  Now where in the world did I see him before Matrix? (refer to my previous post)

       Yesterday, I went to watch the Matrix on opening day c/o of work (Thanks Google!) and if you haven't seen it, I suggest you stop reading this now.      It wasn't all that I expected it to be and the ending was pretty weak.  I figured that when the first of the trilogy came out, it was released at a time where there was nothing out there like it.  ( urlLink Eric  mentioned the same idea too earlier.) It caught people's eye because of the special effects and because it was a story that the masses couldn't understand.  When the second one came out, the masses finally started catching on and of course they had to top the special effects in the first one only to leave you hanging in the end.  It's a guarantee to get the masses to see the third one.  In short, Matrix Revolutions reminded me of two things.  First, I thought of  urlLink Galaga  when all the sentinels were being fired at and second, I thought of  urlLink L.A. Machine Guns , a game I always play at Dave N Buster's.  It was overall an okay movie to me...something you just need to watch once.    Oh yah, one more thing... there's an actor in the movie that looks really familiar.  Anyone know  urlLink who this is ?

        Top 10 Implications of Microsoft Buying Google   10. Free worm with every search.   9. Google renamed "Microoosoooft."	   8. Google becomes default search engine on all computers; attempts to use Yahoo! causes PCs to emit a pungent odor.   7. The search choices on Google will change from "Web," "Images," "Groups," "Directory," and "News" to "Web," "Shop Microsoft," "Buy From Microsoft Because You Have No Choice," and  urlLink "Steve Ballmer Dancing."    6. Google Image Search will not show Microsoft's dark side.   5. All searches on the term "Steve Jobs" will return bios on Art Garfunkel, Ike Turner, Burt Ward (a.k.a. Robin), and other second fiddles.   4. Long speeches from Bill Gates about how "Smart Appliances" will allow owners to use Google to search for what's in their fridge. When pressed, Gates admits such appliances are only available in his mansion, and that he's never actually seen his refrigerator.   3. Microsoft uses Google technology to search for weapons of monopolistic destruction.   2. All searches on the term "Larry Ellison" will produce lists of garbage-collection websites.   1. "Bill Gates is richer than Warren Buffett" subliminally inserted into all search results.  Thanks  urlLink Rodney!  *laugh*

       How did I forget to blog about the  urlLink Niners/Rams  game yesterday?!? After a night of going out with my housemate and a couple of other girl friends, I managed to wake up early enough to go head to mass and have some breakfast with my pops.  We had just enough time to head over to Candlestick Park to catch the beginning of the game.  We got to a few miles within the Candlestick exit only to see a ton of traffic.  We made it within a few minutes of the first quarter and saw that the Niners had already scored their first touchdown.  The seats we had were aweeeeesome! (Thanks again babe! *mwah*) Lower Reserved, Section 20, Row 1.  That's about a lil more than 20 rows from the Niners bench. My dad and I were pretty stoked.  On a side note, is it me or is food/concession stuff at sporting games more and more expensive? It's neck and neck with the movies! I got a beer, a diet coke, and garlic fries for my pops and I and that was already 19 bucks... damn! Oh well...all well worth it!   Back to the game...these two men sitting right next to me were Rams fans and the shet talking went back and forth.  In the end, it was 30-10 ...Go Niners! We finally made it out of the park and on the freeway by 6pm (note we started walking and sat in traffic from 4:30).  With my brother and his gf bailing for dinner plans, my pops and I said screw it and headed to Daly City for some dinner. The day with my daddy was the best and I'm sure he'd agree with me.  ( I actually caught my dad jumping out of his seat a few times to cheer for the Niners... not the usual with his bad knees).

       My new  urlLink neighbors'  presence was short-lived - I heard a ladder being propped up against my place yesterday and couldn't figure out why someone was just outside my window (3 floors up).  Jorge headed outside to ask the guy what he was doing and we were told that they were sealing up some holes in the roof awning to prevent any more pigeon nests.  This morning I heard the pigeons return, pecking on the wall in an attempt to get back in their homes.  Sad..they were evicted! Apparently, my next door neighbors weren't as tolerant of them because they called the HOA to complain. Farewell pigeons!  On a happier note, the first signs of  urlLink snow  in the Sierra popped up early this morning.  2 feet fell and snow resorts are thinking of opening earlier in the season. *crossing fingers*

       So I lag a lil on updating this page real time... ha ha  Then again, I could just change the date/time and still be caught up right? Nawww... So yesterday turned out to be really fun at work.  Originally, I wasn't planning on dressing up until Kimmy brought up the idea.  After lots of talking on IM and Google searching, it was decided. We were gonna be a  urlLink pair of dice , even though she kept persuading me to be her sheep. (ha ha read her blog for details.) Overall, I'm glad we dressed up. It was a ton of fun the process of creating our dice was even more fun.  I can't wait til next year. Maybe we can get a Blogger team costume?   To complete the Halloween night even more, I headed home to wait for the kiddies to show up for trick or treating. Despite rain, the lil kiddies all showed up and they were sooo cute! Jorge and I followed that up with heading to Mykee's for his halloween get together. After figuring out that Mykee owned  urlLink 'The Ring'  on DVD (VHS would have been soo much better!) and also finding out that he was the only one that hadn't seen it, I popped in the DVD.  Let's just say Mykee wanted to go out after watching that since no one could crash at his place with him. (He lives alone.) Let's hope he slept okay last night. ha ha  Off to the Stanford/UCLA game I go...*cross fingers* for sunshine

       It barely sank in that it was Thanksgiving and then before I knew it, Christmas came and left just as fast.    Last year around this time, I was pretty depressed because I was jobless and stuck in a rut...I wasn't sure if I was going to have to sell my house and nothing was working right. This year, the more I think about it, the more I realize that it was a boring, quiet Christmas this year. Maybe it was because Uncle G and his family were in Manila for a funeral...or the 4 hour drive to Sac along with a ton of rain...or because i didn't even get to see Lori in Sac...or maybe since Jorge was in Vegas with his family. I know, I know.  I'm whining.     Really though, I know for fact that I have soooo much to be thankful for this year, especially for coming this far and somehow staying sane through the whole thing. Overall, I'm so glad my outlook on life has changed in a more positive humble manner.  I just can't believe it took so much for me to learn that simple life lesson.

       Last week flew by so fast and before I knew it, Friday came and so did packing for the Tahoe roadtrip.  On the way up, we stopped by my cousin's 21st bday party in Vallejo. Happy Birthday Charlene! Unfortunately, we couldn't stay that long because we needed to get up to Tahoe but at least we were able to stop by.   Saturday was a day of boarding at  urlLink Heavenly  in South Lake Tahoe - it was the first time this season I headed up to board so I'm feeling a bit of the pain today.... argh.. all worth it though - especially since I got to board with Jorge.  It was his second time and after taking a class, he was kickin butt going down the slopes. Unfortunately, we forgot to take pictures in the snow.  I guess we'll have to head up again to take pictures. ha ha  Finally back in the office today and it was a super looong day.  Let's just say that after a long horrible grumpy day, there were so many things that made it a good day. Jorge surprised me with beautiful flowers...I got two xmas presents that made me smile huge (especially since my coworkers shouldn't have given them to me)... Jason's wife, Allison, made some really yummy cookies that he shared with us... one of my housemates paid rent early...and most importantly, Lori and Tony were okay after the numerous  urlLink earthquakes  today...   It's always so much happier to talk about the positive things... =)

         Last night was absolutely magical watching  urlLink 'The Nutcracker'  in  urlLink San Francisco .  I always thought the ballet would be boring and would put me to sleep. Instead, I felt like a little kid that was at the circus for the first time. The snow scenes had to be my favorite because it looked so real.  The snowflakes couldn't have been any prettier and more graceful.    Jorge invited me, along with my parents.  It was good they were able to go at such short notice.  After the show, we finally grabbed some dinner at one of my favorite places in the city,  urlLink Crustacean's . Mmm..

         *yawn*  (no more late partying for tine)   Last night was the Google Holiday Party at the  urlLink Computer History Museum .  Talk about fun!  Each room was decorated with its own theme, Remedy dancers, and matching menu of food.  By far, the best food there was the sushi bars and the desserts! To top it all off, there were games and all sorts of entertainment to keep us busy all night long as well as an open bar (woohoo- i was a lil tipsy!).   It was absolutely great to see my coworkers dressed up with their significant others, having a great time. Happy holidays!

       So before I lose the excuse of being able to write about New Year's resolutions, I better start writing about the weird superstitions I have about ringing the new year in.  For as long as I can remember, I had always spent New Year's Eve with my family.  It wasn't until I left to live in Texas that I was away from my family for that particular holiday. Although I wasn't around my family, I found myself still doing the same things I dreaded doing when I was younger. For instance, the house had to to be super clean, meaning you vacuumed, organized and dusted everything. Bills had to be paid. You had to do all your laundry, especially wash the sheets and towels.  Basically, there shouldn't be some sort of 'to-do' list left to carry over to the new year. It was the same for what you were exactly doing at the stroke of midnight. Whatever you were doing at midnight or whatever you'd left lingering, you'd be taking care of that particular thing for the rest of the year.  Call me weird or superstitious. I still believe in it.   This year, I went into the new year pretty honest about everything in my life. Actually, I fibbed to my parents about how I spent the new year, but what else is new. That's an ongoing obstacle until the day I'm married. I got the majority of my 'to-do's' done and I started off the year relaxing with a massage and a visit to the spa. I thanked God for helping me make it to the point I'm at now and told him I wouldn't take my blessings for granted.  I reflected on my blessings - a great family and very supportive friends, an improved and more personal relationship with God,  an unconditionally loving bf, a job I love coming to every day, a beautiful house over my head, cool housemates, a happier outlook on life...positive thoughts and optimism... I can go on forever but I don't want to beat a dead horse.   To summarize... 2002 was a horrible, negative year. I wanted it to be over and done with.   2003 started just as bad but got better gradually through the year.   2004 started happy and it's only getting better =)

        I know I said my next post would be about my New Years superstitions, but I think this takes a bit more precedence.   It's been almost 10 years now that I could have been exercising my right to vote... I was never a huge political person but with all the crazy things happening in the world currently as well as our oh so 'bright' president, I've decided it's finally time to  urlLink register to vote .  I've completed the first step of filling the online portion of it out and submitting it. Now all I need to do is wait for this registration card to come in the mail, sign it, and send it back...then it's  urlLink official.

          Happy New Year everyone! I know I'm a few days late but better late than never, right?  If you asked me right at new year's if I was starting the year off perfectly, there would have been no doubt in my mind that I was! If you ask me right at this currently moment, I might have a few extra grumpy words to say about it. Ha Ha.. backtrack to New Years Eve...  After working from home and getting things in order before the new year (the new year superstitions will probably be my next blog entry), Jorge picked me up, all ready for our lil New Year's excursion/adventure.  We went to this cozy italian restaurant in North Beach called  urlLink Ristorante Fior d'Italia .  Jorge's really good friend's parents owned the place and he hadn't been there in almost 5 years he said.  It looked like one of those restaurants you'd see in the movies where mob fathers would 'meet' to discuss the state of their 'families'.  Talk about grub.  Afterwards, my forgetful butt realized I had forgotten to charge my camera battery so we ran home real quick to charge the battery before heading out to Kingston's party in SF at City Hall. It was a formal affair so seeing Jorge all dressed up was too cute.  Midnight came and being around Jorge's friends was so much fun- I know he hadn't seen them in such a long time and that he'd love partying with them.  It was after that where it gets a little hazy ( i think the champagne kicked in.. ).  I was trying to get a hold of my girl friends, who I was supposed to meet up with.  With the rain and little bit of cell reception they could get, it ended up that we all couldn't meet up. *sad tine*  I headed back to Berkeley and called it a night.    We stayed at a place called the  urlLink Claremont Resort  and started New Year's off with a bang at the spa.  Spa treatments and  urlLink massages  have to be the best thing ever, especially if it's how you start the year off with! So, as I said before, if you asked me at that particular moment if I started it off perfectly I would have undoubtedly said YES!   If you ask me right now, I'd start grumbling because for the last two days, I've been sick, especially today. A ton of nyquil, tea, liquids, and everything else my mom's been bugging me about later, I am still all stuffed up watching Dirty Dancing and the special features on DVD (a Xmas gift I just opened).  My mom's even got me all worked up about all the flu epidemic and pneumonia stuff out there... thanks mom.  Hopefully I'll be better enough to work tomorrow - if not, working from home is always an option.

       So after landing in Manila, I realized I forgot to update my blog and the voicemail greeting on my cell phone... *update*  I'll be in Manila and Singapore for the rest of the month...leave a message and I'll talk to you when I get back   */update*  Yes, you heard correct. I'm in Manila and on my way to Singapore early tomorrow morning for a few days before my cousin's wedding.   Pictures to come after Singapore... on my way to get a massage. Woohoo!

         I complain a good amount about my commute to work every morning.  It's a really short distance (~15 miles according to Mapquest) and should theoretically be a fast drive over (~16 minutes according to Mapquest again).     Instead... it takes usually about 35-45 minutes to get to work from home each morning.  That's on a good day too! If there's an accident, it's an hour easily! So today, I woke up fairly early, watched the news to see if there were any accidents, and even waited a bit for traffic to die down.  I left around 9:20am... stop...go...stop...go.  I think the fastest speed I ever went was 35  mph.  So, in my boredom, I did my makeup, sang a few songs, and took pictures. (excuse the dirty winshield!)  I think I'm better off working from home in the moring for a few hours and then heading into work... unless someone else has a better suggestion on how to get to Mtn View (near 101) from San Mateo (near 101)??

       It's been forever since I've written in my blog.  It feels like it's been forever since I've even hung out in my own house.  In the last week, I've started taking a Mandarin class at CSM, been to a Sales Conference, a company Tahoe trip, seen the Broadway show  urlLink Lion King , celebrated my uncle's birthday, and have gone to a Superbowl party.  In that last week, I've been home for two days and now I'm home somewhat sick.  Actually, I woke up this morning coughing up a storm and  without  a voice.   So, instead of writing about this crazy week, here's a few pictures...

       Just recently, I made a comment to a friend about a fear I had.  I don't want to lose my identity by being in a relationship.  He said to me that he'd never heard anyone ever say that before but that it was the perfect description to a really common dilemma in most relationships.    In the times that you're single and uninvolved in your life, you have to learn to enjoy being by yourself. You pick up new activities. You cherish the time you spend with your friends a lot more.  You learn to *heart*  alone  time.  A few years ago, I got out of a pretty serious relationship and had to learn to be on my own. I was so accustomed to having someone there with me all the time.  In hindsight, it had to be the best thing I learned about myself.  I learned to enjoy spending time with myself.  I could be walking/people watching, wandering Barnes & Noble reading, or even sitting in my room doing my nails or watching tv.  It was absolutely great not having to consult someone else's schedule.  Better yet, I didn't feel guilty for being selfish. (Yes, I know it shouldn't be that way but it happened.)  This went on for a while. I learned to be very autonomous and be really content with it.  It changed again, though, when I got into a serious relationship with someone else.  There wasn't as much time to do all the things that I enjoyed doing on my own.  The 'we' part of the relationship was great and I was head over heels in love with him, but I couldn't help missing some of the things I grew so accustomed to.  I missed being selfish and making sure I was taking care of  me .    People say that you're supposed to walk away from a relationship with lessons learned.  About yourself. About other people. About what makes you happy.  Recently, I learned you can't compromise your identity.  It's what defines your soul, your inner being.    Wouldn't it be great if the relationships you made in your life genuinely fit  the identity you've learned to love within yourself?

       Most things I write about in my blog are personal, but not the touchy kind of personal.  Nor, do I really choose to openly share to the world about these aspects of me.  A good example of 'touchy personal' is religion.  If you're not one to like reading about religion, I suggest you stop reading now.  Most people that are really close to me know that I'm Catholic, born and raised. For the most part of my life, until now, it was something forced upon me.  I didn't  choose  it.  There were even points in my life when I started doubting my faith, because I hadn't chosen it. At the time, I figured it was a 'habit' I formed, just like the rituals and sayings that were performed in a Catholic mass.     Stand. Sit down. Kneel. In the name of the father....   Did I really mean all these things that I said? Was I there because I had been there all my life and knew nothing else?   I always asked myself these questions, especially when people asked me about religion.  Even until recently,  when I decided to head back to the Philippines for my cousin's wedding.  Every time I'm back in the Philippines, I'm always there to see my family. It's a time to go catch up with people and places that bring back sentimental value to me, as well as my family. During my trip, there were so many times that we stopped by random churches.  To me, I was somewhat irritated because I was on vacation. Plus, it wasn't Sunday most of the times these random visits occured.  I absolutely dislike (almost hate) it when things are forced upon me.    My last straw came when we went to this  urlLink church  in Baclaran. For as long as I can remember, we've always visited  urlLink this church  each time we were back in Manila. The area isn't the greatest in being safe. Parking sucks. My mom always reminds us to be careful with our purses. There's a ton of people everywhere in this area and worst of all, it stinks! I thought to myself, "All this to visit a church?" I still went to visit though.  I sat in the church on a pew with my parents and aunt. There were so many people praying, especially in the middle of the week and in the middle of the day. Maybe my mom could tell I was irritated but she asked me if I knew why we visited that church so often. I said no.    Your grandmother (she passed away while I was in high school and I was really close to her) used to come here to pray all the time.  One day her doctor had diagnosed her with Cancer and said that she wouldn't be able to have any more children. She had only had three kids at the time.  So she went to Baclaran to pray that she'd get better because she wanted to have more children. She didn't want to die. She continued to pray there on a regular basis and one day she got on her knees and walked on her knees in the midst of all the people there down the center aisle, all the way up to the altar.  She got to the front of the church, still on her knees, when everything started glowing. After a bit of fear, she went to the priest to tell him about the glowing. He advised her to keep praying for whatever it was she was asking for because it was a sign.  A few months later, her doctor told her that the Cancer mysteriously disappeared and that she was getting better. She also ended up having four more kids, your uncles.  That's why we come here all the time. We say thank you for giving us our family.  By this point I was a bit teary and emotional. I thought about all the other things we did as a family, that I never really gave thought or care about. It all became clear.   Being Catholic wasn't just a religion to me. It wasn't all the rituals of mass and all the things they forced upon me in Catholic school.  It was my family and the source of individual happiness and console in the low points of my life. It was where I ran to whenever everything was falling apart in my life.  It's what brings my family together and how we interact with each other. It's how I want to see myself interacting with my future family.

       I just got back from having dinner and from shooting pool with a really long-time friend of mine, Mykee...  I've noticed that no matter how much time has passed and no matter how long we haven't hung out with each other, there's always a time when one of us will call the other person to shoot pool.  We never play for anything really material. We play for fun, it's always 9-ball, and we always play for bragging rights.  Tonight happened to be a night where both of us were off our game. We were missing simple cuts, the rail shots, and just being plain odd about our shots.  We hadn't had a drink so we blamed it on being completely sober.  A round of drinks later, we're finally starting to play and improve our shots and finally it's 2-2. Tie-breaking game.  In the end, Mykee walked away with the bragging shots, especially since he got some crazy hard last shot it.  Fine. *pout* Good game. *still pouting*

             I barely knew it was St. Patty's Day tomorrow until someone at work reminded me.    After work today, I went to stop by my uncle's house to visit my 5 yr old cousin and this was his 'grown-up' update on his life:     tine: So, how's Kindergarten? Adrian: *sounding like a stressed adult* I have so many projects. tine: *laughing* Really? What projects are you working on now? Adrian: I have to catch a leprechaun. tine: How do you catch a leprechaun? Adrian: They only come out at night so my teacher said we have to check the classroom for a leprechaun early tomorrow morning, in case he got stuck in there tonight.

       With all this great weather lately, I've been more than happy to spend lots of time outside to enjoy the sunshine and blue skies.  This afternoon, after being on a roller coaster of emotions, I had the urge to work from the balcony of our floor.  They added tables, chairs and umbrellas just recently so what better way to enjoy the weather?!? (I'd post a picture but silly me forgot my USB cable for my camera) Possibly  urlLink Kimmy's blog  for pics?  All's that's missing is me sitting at home in my pjs!

       The weather is absolutely fabulous outside and I had a really good weekend hanging out with friends I hadn't seen in a while...   You'd think I'd be super excited but today at work (I was ready to go over my workbooks and finish some homework), I dreaded going to class tonight.  I missed 2 classes in Chinese (Mandarin) because of my vacation to Asia and I missed way too much. I tried to catch up this weekend but by 2am last night, my right hand was half dead from writing in my character workbook.   *mental note* Do not sign up for a class that's 3 hours long and meets on Monday nights, especially for a language class. You'll practice during the class and possibly the next day but forget everything by the time Saturday comes along... *end mental note*  So it's official, I've dropped my class and I have no idea what the full reason is.. maybe it's coz i missed those classes? Or maybe it's because I picked the worst night to have a 3 hour class during the week? Or even maybe coz this class reminds me too much of someone..?   Whatever it is... the only thing I know is that it gives me more time to enjoy the nice weather outside!

       I finally met the other Christine XX and she's so absolutely cool!  We went over the past 20 years and talked about where our lives are now.    There's lots of insight to her and though our conversation wasn't in depth, I have this feeling that she's gone through a lot in the past.  I could be wrong but it's just a feeling.  We have lots of similarities, especially our love for cooking. I'm sure she'd kick my butt anyday though! *laugh*  I was also able to meet her roomate, who was just as down to earth and friendly. Overall, it was a great experience and I'm glad I've made new friends....especially one with the same name as me. =)

       Wednesday morning at work, a guy (Doug) came our cube area randomly.  guy: is there a Christine XX here? me: yah, that's me. guy: my friend at church has the same name as you.  me: wow, is she from south san francisco? guy: not anymore, but yeah. me: *tells the ice skating story* guy: oh gawsh! i have to call her to tell her! *guy leaves*  The ice skating story is pretty funny, especially since I always tell people about it.  You see.. I was about 7 when I went to Fashion Island Mall to go ice skating with my family. I didn't know how and my parents just shoved some skates on me and told me to have fun. So I'm on the ice battling the crowds of people skating around me, holding onto the rails for my dear life.  I get the courage to let go and skate a bit. I go one direction and in the corner of my eye I see another girl coming towards me. She's learning like me and can't stop just like me. We collide and hit the floor. We somehow make it to that little hump on the side of the ice where you can sit and rest.   me: Are you okay? girl: yah.  me: Sorry! girl: Sorry! me: What's your name? girl: Christine me: me too! What's your last name? girl: XX me: me too?? *weirded out* What's your middle name? girl: Elaine me: *pheeew* okie, you're not me. MOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOM!  All my life, I've always known she was out there so I always used my middle initial.  I always told people this story, too! So yesterday morning, Doug came back to my desk and said he talked to Christine and told her about how we worked together. He even mentioned that recently she was wondering about me and wanted to get in touch with me.  He gave me her cell number and told me to call. We got in touch yesterday afternoon and laughed about the whole thing.  What a trip. What are the chances right?  20 years later and we're laughing about it... She even lives in the same city as me! It'll be fun to meet her one of these days.

         For all of you that don't know who the 'Runt' is, it would be my younger sister... I have no idea how I even started calling her this but somehow it stuck and the rest of my family/extended family got used to it, too! So to the Runt, no more being 'christine' at clubs and no more having to go into places separately so that they don't know we're using the same ID (*laugh* I feel really old right about now!).  Have fun and don't do too much damage to your liver tonight...we still have Vegas at the end of the month! Then you're dead!

       I'm back..yipee! Actually, I got back late Sunday night and was too lazy to update my blog...figures.    Thinking back on the trip, I wish I didn't have to leave Boracay.  It was absolute paradise ...white powder for sand, sunny blue skies, crystal clear water, massages on the beach, yummy food stands, cheap fresh seafood, fresh fruit shakes, beautiful sunsets, perfect relaxation... it couldn't have been any better than that. =) Those three days in Boracay were the only days of relaxation I had on this trip to Asia. Everything else was a hazy blur jumping from plane to plane and driving all over the Philippines.    I'll have to further expand in another post on a few spiritual moments I had in Asia...   In the meantime, here's some  urlLink pictures ...

        It's just finally sinking in... my godson passed away yesterday morning from a tragic accident. R.I.P. DJ Gigante.  Your 5th birthday would have been on Sunday and I know you wanted a bouncer, the ones with a slide too. Happy Birthday!   I'm a firm believer in the saying that 'Things happen for a reason.'.  Maybe God had another plan for you. Maybe he needed a sidekick up there. For whatever reason, I know you're in a better place, bouncing on your birthday bouncer. Promise me you'll watch over your family, especially your parents and sisters. I haven't lost someone...I've just gained an angel to watch over me.

       Towards the  urlLink end of last year , I wrote about a lunch I had with some fellow coworkers. We were talking about sushi chefs and I brought up the point that women could not be sushi chefs because of their slightly warmer body temperature and how it would affect the freshness of sashimi.  After a bunch of reading, I concluded that I was wrong and gave it up to my coworker.   Last year, one of the reasons I realized that I could have been wrong was because of a japanese restaurant ( urlLink Ichiban ) in Utah I had read about that was owned by a woman. This woman was also a sushi chef.   After this weekend, however, I could have been somewhat right. Since I was in Utah, and since this was one my best friend's favorite restaurants, I decided to visit Ichiban. Seriously, it's some of the best sushi I've had in a long while! I also met the owner,  urlLink Peggy , and had asked her about the idea of women being sushi chefs. She had said that the majority of women really could not physically be sushi chefs because of the temperature of their hands. It really did make a difference with the freshness of raw fish. In her case, though, she had gone to Japan because she had wanted to study to be a sushi chef. She also was able to do this because she was part of a minority of women that had an unusually colder body temperature than most women.  How crazy is that.

       The world never ceases to amaze me. There's certain days in your life when things just don't seem to be working out right. I'm sure you've guessed. Today was one of those days.   I woke up sore (not as bad as yesterday) from snowboarding over the weekend. My neck and shoulders were still pretty tight, even after getting a sports massage on Sunday. To add to that, my arms and sternum were still damn sore. Let's just say I'm not a happy camper right now.   So, at work today, I was on my way to the bathroom. I bumped into a coworker I hadn't seen in a long time so naturally I said hi. We exchanged the typical 'how are you' talk, followed by my mentioning of snowboarding, being super sore, and being in need of a massage. I couldn't find an appointment though for this week. Without even stopping to think, he was on his laptop telling me that I should take his appointment for this week and starts switching it over to me.  Wow! How absolutely generous is that!   It's things like this that make me forget about how many damn evil people there are in the world. It's these random acts of kindness that make me smile and want to continue striving to be a good person.   Thanks O'Shane!

       Just when I thought the snowboarding season was over (vacationing in Asia left me in 'tropical'-mode), my last minute trip to Sisca also included a visit to  urlLink Snowbird . It was a year ago, right around this same time, that I went on a boarding trip to Aspen with the same group of friends I'm with in Utah. Leave it to these friends to push me on my board. I wouldn't have it any other way. *laugh*   Honestly, though, I love boarding with these group of friends. They're pretty hard core. It's the only time I ever learn new skills with snowboarding because I'm always feeling like I have to keep up with them. Plus, they know how to correct what I'm doing wrong or egg me on when I'm ready to call it a day.   Usually I always have a  urlLink trail map  just so I know what type of run I'm going on and so that I don't get lost.  With this crew, no one had a trail map because Sisca, Meda, and Mikey knew the mountain like the back of their hand. I just followed their lead, naively, as usual.  Somewhere in the middle of the day, one of the guys tells me, 'So, at least you can say you've been on a double black diamond.' (I just happen to be sitting on a lift on my way up to another black trail, by the way, as he's telling me this.) We board some more and I keep eating it pretty bad, wondering why I'm so scared of this mountain. I even collide with Sisca at one point, messing up my neck.  Meda then ends the day with, 'Snowbird has one of the hardest terrains. The blues are equivalent to the usual blacks so you did pretty good.' (wide eyed at this point)   So what in the world does that make the double black diamond?  Crack, I tell ya!!!

       For a while, Kimmy and I have been talking about dreams - dreams we've recently had, what these dreams could possibly mean, and just plain laughing about the randomness.    A few months ago, I had a dream and in most cases, I usually never remember my dreams.  I was running around the city looking for someone or something through most of the dream.  I also invented something somewhere in all that. Most importantly, it ended with me bathing my kids. (The invention was something for the shower and I was testing it out, while bathing my kids. Talk about random!) I had twin baby boys. I remember their faces vividly, the chubby arms they had, the color of their skin, and the smiles on their faces. They glowed when they smiled at me.   What if in the future, when I do have my own kids, they do look like the ones I saw in my dream? I'd tell them I saw and met them before they were even born. You see, my dad's side of the family has a set of twins in every generation. There's only one cousin on my dad's side (in my generation) that's had a child so none of us know which one will have the twins. My dad's mom was the oldest of her siblings and she had the twins. In the next generation, my uncle (the youngest of the siblings) had the twins.  Where's the pattern? None.   Dreams are supposed to be your subliminal thoughts acted out in your mind while you're sleeping. At least that's what I've always thought.  For the most part, all the dreams that I've ever remembered have always had some sort of meaning in my life.  They've told me something about myself and made me look at other perspectives I never really thought about. Maybe it's the voice inside trying to tell me something or even watch over me.   Could the dreams you have affect how your life plays out? Just another random thought...

        I stare at silence -  enveloped in utter confusion. my mind in unfamiliar places searching for any type of reaction. i travel to each place and thought from years ago to ten minutes from now... no permanence in each moment, just yearning to embrace my silence.  my facade conveys the surface, displaying what people want to see... enough to satisfy their curiosity  nothing short of reality.  a myriad of scrapbooked memories, put together in one identity - masks of different emotions representing changes very few can sense.  in my world of recurring patterns, do you truly see  me ?

       Allergies have to be the worst I've ever had in my life, even worse than when I was living in Austin, TX. In Austin, there was mold, oak trees, and other crazy pollen that made every living soul look like Rudolph the red nose reindeer. California, however, was never that bad until now.

       I just came back from watching  urlLink Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind  and I have this happy giddiness in the pit of my tummy.  Part of me is somewhat sentimental right now, relating with Kate Winslet's character, while the other half of me realizes that life is a lot simpler these days.    One of the first mentors I ever had told me that you'll never know someone unless you put them in the right situation.  There's moments in your life when things aren't as happy as you'd like them to be, but those moments are the times that you realize that the people you cherish mean the most to you because they truly love you at the lowest points in your life, unconditionally.    Wouldn't life be so much easier if you could initially and honestly reveal every aspect, especially the ones defining who you are, to people you've become friends with? And wouldn't it even be better if they genuinely accepted each of these qualities about you?   Each and every day, I've learned to love and accept who I've become. What a great feeling.

       We headed over to the Mission for some sushi (I think it was called YoYo?) and found ourselves in what looked to be a rat maze. None of us had realized that  urlLink Carnaval  was the next day so all these streets were blocked off. Luckily, someone moved a gate and we were outta there.  With my oh so cool parking karma, we find a spot right across the street from the restaurant.  *curtsie*   The five of us (Me,  urlLink Jane ,  urlLink Jon ,  urlLink Mario , and  urlLink Denny ) meet up with  urlLink Keith  there and from the first introductions to Mario and Keith, I could tell there wasn't going to be any type of weird, first time meeting awkwardness right away. After dinner we head to an Element party for open bar (yah, we're cheap bastards) and take off to finally do our barhopping rounds in the Mission. From what I remember, I think we were at three bars:  urlLink Skylark , some other bar around the corner I bump into college friends at, and  urlLink Elbo Room  (Denny had to remind me of that one). I learned four things that night: 1) pace yourself for a happy fun night, 2) be wise about the alcohol you decide to mix, 3) nonjudgemental, laid back people are the only people to be around when you're barhopping (none of the prissy, high maint. crap to deal with), and 4) pouring water on someone's head will make them stop snoring. Ha ha!  Thanks for a fun night guys!

       After coming home from work and taking a bit of a nap, Albert (close friend since college) came to scoop me up for dinner and a movie. Going along with this 'spending time with friends' theme, we both needed to be around each other to get our minds off other things. It's always refreshing to be around someone that completely thinks like and relates with you. It's almost like you don't have to finish stories because the other person can read your mind.  We decided to watch  urlLink Shrek 2  and it was absolutely hilarious. A must see! Thanks for a fun buddy night Albutt!

        Think of this post as half venting and half thinking out loud.    I can't even count how many times I've written about traditional courting- the chivalry...the romance.  It's absolutely fabulous!  It doesn't mean you put your best foot forward nor does it mean you forget to woo a girl to giddy oblivion. In the beginning, it's as a friendship. You're getting to know each other. You listen to each other and you remember all the small things. (ie her favorite flower or that funny childhood story he told you) You lose complete track of time.  You see this other side of the person you normally wouldn't see. And if you're lucky, he/she might even be just as giddy as you are.   Sometimes, though, people don't know how to let go and be themselves. The end up putting up this huge wall. Maybe it's because they're scared. Maybe because they're jaded from the last relationship. Or maybe they're just control freaks and don't know what it is to let go. We've all been there at one point or another.  Men (as opposed to boys or immature men) - I challenge you to think outside of the box. It's okay to color outside of the lines. Don't be conventional and don't calculate every risk you take. Strategies are good for your retirement plan or a poker game, but not for "woo'ing" a girl.

        For quite a bit of time, I've just been doing what I need to do and it's the same, day in and day out. I've kept myself busy with work, a few softball games here and there,  maintained enough of a social life that people didn't think i fell off the face of the earth, and dealt with some weird insomnia bug (yes, insomnia again!). It's all been pretty routine though. How blah!  I needed to change it up a bit. After a night of hanging out with the girls in the city and sleeping a few hours, I woke up in the mood to enjoy some of the bay area sunshine. The local farmer's market was calling my name and I wanted to wander around, in search of some fresh cut flowers for my room. I came home with my some fresh fruit and some of my favorite flowers - gerber daisies. Sooo pretty.

            Saturday night,  urlLink Kaibin  decided to celebrate her birthday at  urlLink Suite one8one  (the old Polly Esther's) after dinner.  Before the drunken silliness, here's a sober picture of the girls. Lots of fun but the hangover lingered on Sunday.

       The last two weeks have been one crazy emotional roller coaster and now that I'm finally settling down back into the normal routine of my life, it's left me a bit melancholy. It started at a low from the funeral, a complete 180 about the IPO news, a memorable dinner date, a really long tiring weekend of family and softball playoffs, and a goodbye to a good friend of mine that was on his way back to Amsterdam. It was almost impossible trying to wake up this morning and after a day at work, I went straight to my bed to take a much needed nap.   Life is definitely up and down these days, but I wouldn't have it any other way. It's these times that you learn to lean on the people that mean the most to you.

           I am completely spoiled by the company I work for. They bought us  urlLink Spiderman  tickets for opening day so I take Beeker, my sister, and her friend Sterling. I expected them to overdo the movie, almost like what they did with Matrix Revolutions. Instead, it was cute and goofy. It was just what I hoped for. Some of it seemed so random and cheesey but once Beeker filled me in on some of the references, it made a lot more sense.

       Good morning! I woke up to someone scraping a shovel on the sidewalk outside my window. Bastard. It was only 7am! Back to the point of this entry. I'm not crying but definitely sore from the run yesterday. It's a good sore though. I'm such a baby.  My reward: Spiderman and Stinger Lounge

       Vince (a coworker) mentioned a running group they just started a couple of weeks ago. They run to this hill behind the office every day and I got coaxed into it. For people that know me real well, they know i'm not a runner. I almost *hate* running because it makes my lungs feel like they're about to explode. (yes, I'm a big baby!) The closest thing I got to doing some crazy cardio workout was hiking up  urlLink Upper Yosemite Falls  with the girls.  Francey (one of my close girl friends) paced me and taught me how to listen to my heartbeat so that I wouldn't freak out. So today, running about two miles, I kept listening to my coworkers' directions and remembered everything Francey told me. It worked and I got through the run. Right now though, my body hurts and I'm sure tomorrow morning I'll be crying. Hopefully, if I keep it up, I won't be feeling this way in a few weeks.

       I just got back from having dinner at Whole Foods with  urlLink Eric . It's always fun to catch up with him outside of work, especially over some yummy food. He's still trying to get me to watch  urlLink Farenheit9/11  with him. He knows I'm on the fence about it.   It's Saturday night and I *grounded* myself.  The last few weekends I've gone out (marathon style) too much that by the time the weekend was over, I was more tired than when the weekend started.  It defeated the whole purpose of learning to recoop for the upcoming week. To top that off, I've been going out on the weeknights more often too. So tonight, it's Saturday and the world is probably partying. Me? I'm staying home to bond with the bed and my tv... Mmmm

       For the most part of this week I've been completely scatterbrained. I completely forgot about certain appointments I had. I was a bit clumsy and zoning out. I even caught myself smiling for no apparent reason (or so I thought). My coworkers even picked up on it before I could let it sink in. It's this random giddiness that makes everything all right all of the sudden. Everything's just simple and it all makes sense.   It was a pleasant surprise that came from no where, when I least expected or wanted it. And if you know me, you know that I *heart* surprises, especially the ones that leave this enveloping warmth in the pit of your tummy that creeps up on you every time you catch yourself smiling to yourself.

       I *hate* feet. I don't know how or when it started, but I just know I absolutely am mortified by the thought of anything that has to do with feet. You can't touch my feet. You can't stare at my feet. Better yet, don't even show me your feet.    Some people have foot/toe fettishes. What do I have? A phobia! Maybe it was when my mom would dig her feet into me to keep them warm? Or maybe it was when my dad would cut my toenails and they'd end up looking all ugly. More recently, it was an old coworker that used to love to take his shoes off and wiggle his toes or put his feet up near me. (Gawd, the thought of these things in my head is absolute torture! How am I writing about this?)   Ask  urlLink Kimmy.  We both realized we were going through the same self inflicted torture a while ago. (You'd think we could just ignore them, right?) Damn hilarious but cool coz at least I know I'm not alone.

       (Since I've been sleeping since Sunday, I'll pretend today's Monday.) It seems like there were two main parts to the weekend.  First and foremost,  spending time with the girls is definitely the only way to recharge.  Despite the distance between the 5 of us and our busy work schedules, we all manage to make time for each other, even if we haven't seen each other in months.  As mentioned in my previous post, Sisca's bday celebration was this past weekend and absolutly nothing was going to get in the way of our quality time with each other. Lisa's been in Boston finishing up med school so it was Sis, Debbers, Francey, and moi!   Friday was chill night for the most of us, but I ended up heading to the south bay after work for a friend's birthday at Gordon Biersch, with some downtown SJ barhopping afterwards. It ended up becoming what seemed like a Cal Poly reunion everywhere we went(Happy Bday Tim!). It was definitely a good idea that I was DD coz I needed to save the energy for the remaining weekend's festivities.   Saturday starts with the second interesting part of the weekend.  The city is full of interesting characters, and for most people, it's the place to be seen/met especially if you're single. In our case, however, we were out to have fun and dance up a storm - no need for 'boys' to complicate our quality time together. In my opinion, there's a time and place for meeting good people and clubs don't usually end up being at the top of my list. Saturday night was an exception to my rule, though. We met a couple of guys that genuinely wanted to hang out and dance - none of the stupid pick up lines or sly attempts to woo themselves into your pants.   Sunday continued with a daytime party. I call one of the guys from the night before to come out and play, even though I doubt they can make it. To my surprise, the new buddies show up and again, it's a happy fun day. We even bump into lots of other friends from the past, including some of my high school friends. Lots of pictures and lots of good times. It was a perfect way to end a really fun weekend.

        Today, I woke up to a phone call from my cousin, Adrian. "Are you coming to my graduation today?"   The ceremony was so cute, especially the presentation of diplomas.  Each one of them had these handmade graduation caps with their handprints on the top of them. The tassle was a lollipop, moved from one side to the other once they got their diplomas. It was almost impossible to get a shot of the class without some super proud parent's head and camera in the way.     This morning was even a bit more sentimental to me because despite Adrian and I's huge age difference, we shared the same kindergarten teacher, the same classroom, and the same memories. My kindergarten teacher even recognized me and couldn't believe how much time had passed. Again, I was a sap.   I don't even want to imagine how I'll be when it's my own child graduating from kindergarten.

       I think I'm finally accepting the fact that I really want what I can't have. Not something taken, but rather something that doesn't seem to exist. I want what keeps me on my toes. I want what challenges me rather than what whatever it is that bores or sterilizes me. I have no time or patience for the stupid, immature crap. You'd think that's totally obvious, right - a given perhaps?    I thought it was a phase that I would grow out of. It's not a phase, though.  Blah.

       Another chilled out Friday night.  I went to go see  urlLink Harry Potter   with a friend of mine visiting from LA. Despite the long wait in line and the noisy people sitting behind us during the movie, it was still worth it! I'm so ready to drop the book I'm reading right now and reread my Harry Potter books.

       Get your mind out of the gutter.  When you're cell phone-less, don't you feel damn naked? I guess I didn't realize just how much I depend on it.  Yesterday, I reported my phone "lost". Thank gawd for insurance! I'll have a  urlLink new phone  sent to me within 2-3 business days.  So if you're trying to get a hold of me til then, sorry! You can find me at home or at work.

       It was 1995 and I was just ending my sophomore year in college. 6 of us decided to start a new chapter of  urlLink aKDPhi  at  urlLink Cal Poly SLO . It's now 9 years later and after attending part of aKDPhi Convention this past weekend, I am so absolutely proud of the SLO House for all their hard work and dedication in carrying on the charter class' goals. Looking back, the feeling I had this weekend was the same emotional, touched feeling I had when I crossed as a Charter.  Thanks for bringing it back!  Cal Poly SLO aKDPhi, Omicron Chapter! Hells yeah!    On a similar sidenote, congrats to my kiddies at  urlLink UIUC aKDPhi  for getting Associate status this year at convention! I'm so very proud of you all and again, so touched for being able to share this moment with you!

       It's been a few days since I deliriously vented and after a sleepless weekend and a visit to the doctor, I was told to immediately go to the ER because I was severely dehydrated with a really inconsistent blood pressure. My mom and sister take me over where I can barely stand straight without thinking the sky was spinning around me. (Imagine yourself at your coherent drunkest state.)   After waiting almost an hour, a room opens where I get all the goodies - IV, blood tests, peewee tests, tons of pain meds, antibiotics, and all kinds of other meds shot up through my IV.  My arms are a dead giveaway that I'm a junkie from all the vein poking that was done. Ha ha NOT!  The doctor finally tells me what's wrong after my family doctor is stumped at what may be causing everything. I have a kidney infection and because of all the other symptoms I had, my blood shows that I'm potassium deficient and now gotta take these horsepill sized potassium tablets along with my antibiotics for the next two weeks.I think the highlight of the whole hospital visit, though, is that the doctor and nurses kept giving papers for my mom to sign which in turn she made me sign. In the end the doctor asked where my mom was when she was getting the car and then looked at my chart once again. The whole time I was there, they all thought I was a minor - 17 to be exact. Great. Either I really do look damn young or they can't do their math because my date of birth was on every sheet I signed.    Since the hospital, I still have fevers and headaches. I'm still sweating a ton, but the medicine's definitely helping it not be so bad. Thanks to everyone who sent me their get well wishes. It's so absolutely touching to know friends are worrying about you.   On two other sidenotes, my work laptop decided to get sick with me. Graham says they're sympathy pains. Blah. Status: Currently being diagnosed at HelpDesk Hospital.  Also, today (actually yesterday July 28) is technically my first year at Google. It's today that I went fulltime after being a contractor. Woohoo.

       It's not even insomnia... it's sheer sweat and being wide awake from napping most of the day. I've watched a couple of really random shows on the 'Oxygen' channel, Sister Act 2, an episode of Coupling, The Golden Child, and I'm currently watching an episode of MacGyver.   Hopefully the doctor will have some sort of explanation tomorrow.

       Today started off worse than yesterday. I woke up bright and early, freezing. I think it was about 5am. I pulled out another blanket and put a sweatshirt on, only to wake up later in the morning sweating yet again. I took my temperature and it was at 104.3 .  That's just not right. I swear that's straight brain damage.  Half dead I jump into the shower to cool down and guzzle about a gallon of water. Finally my temperature goes down to 102.3 and I sleep through the afternoon. Apparently (based on the news), the weather's supposed to be beautiful today, but I don't think I ever left my room unless it was to get more water downstairs. One second I'm freezing...another second I'm soaked with sweat. I sleep again and it's finally now that I feel somewhat okay. This has got to be the most random sickness ever.

       So much for hanging out with Alice and Kingston tonight... I left work early shivering uncontrollably. I've never felt so damn helpless before. To backtrack, the AC in our building died earlier in the day so I took an early lunch with  urlLink CiscoRick . Damn SJ is far when your tummy is grumbling.   I get back only to find out that AC is still dead. I'm sweating profusely and down to just a tank top. Andrea and I finally agree that we need to work somewhere else and go to another building. Ahhh, finally. I can breathe. After a while, we return to find out the AC is back but I'm starting to get cold so I put my sweater back on. I keep shaking and I can't control it so I sit in the sunshine for a while. I go back to my desk and the shaking won't stop so I decide to go home. I whine a bit to my mom on the phone and she automatically tells me to drink tea and sleep. I take her advice but before I do that, I decide to take my temperature - 102.4 . Great. I jump into my bed coz i'm freezing, even with sweats and a sweatshirt on. Half an hour later I'm sweating like I've ran 10 miles. I jump out of my bed but I'm freezing AGAIN. So even though it's 80 degrees outside,  urlLink my blankie   comes out of hiding. Being wrapped up in blankie remind me that he's been through everything with me. It's only now I've stopped shaking - instead now I'm sweating. I guess you can't have everything.

       Call me weird but I was raised thinking that every person in the world was genuinely nice and honest. I grew up on the peninsula where everything's green, where you could leave your doors unlocked, and where people were always friendly. Catholic school and my parents sheltered me pretty good. College was the first time I left home to be on my own and culture shock was an understatement. As the years passed, I learned lessons about people on my own. Some were dishonest, some hurt me, and some were genuinely nice. Friends came and went. Boyfriends came in and out of my life. I even dealt with my fair share of both psycho girls and stalker guys.  I hated being jaded.   Today, I was having lunch with Beeker before he left for Vancouver. We ordered our lunch and my tummy was looking forward to some yummy thai food. The satay came out and we continued to wait for the rest of the lunch. Suddenly, we heard all these people screaming at each other. There was even a little kid crying on the telephone. Apparently, the kitchen staff was getting into a scuffle in the back of the restaurant and the customers all sat there in amazement. Our waiter finally comes out and apologizes for the wait. He tells us that the food we ordered wouldn't be made and continues to apologize. We're comp'ed for our satay and each customer walks out of the restaurant. So much for thai food.   The more I venture out of the peninsula, the more I realize that I live in a bubble. Don't get me wrong. I hate drama and complication, but I'm glad I've learned there's crazy people out there. I loved growing up thinking the world was a good place where no one could hurt you, but I think I'd rather tell my future children about the reality of life. Some people will surprise you with their bad intentions, while others actually have good hearts.

       As promised, I said I'd write about learning how to rollerblade.  Previously I mentioned I decided to play a day of softball and go out with the girls Saturday night. I even briefly mentioned going rollerblading on Sunday - all after being already half dead from Saturday's festivities.   Sunday comes rolling around and I agree to learn how to rollerblade with Coach Beeker. He plays a ton of hockey and has been rollerblading for a while now. He even reassures me that he's a good, patient teacher so I'm game.   We end up driving up to the city, where he suggests that we blade along the Embarcadero. It's gorgeous weather and the Embarcadero is beautiful in the daytime. In all the time that I've lived in California, I realized that I've only driven along this street. We park near  urlLink Delancey Street Restaurant  and the whole way up to the city from Daly City, I'm pretty much psyching myself out. I keep imagining all these nasty things happening to me - eating it pretty bad in front of a ton of people, cutting myself up pretty bad, hitting my head, etc...  I buckle up, put on my knee pads and Beeker's wrist guards. I even sit on the sidewalk for a while paranoid of standing up. I finally do and pretty much eat it right away. Great. This is a bad sign.  Keep in mind we're on the opposite side of the flat part of Embarcadero so there's even a street to cross. What in the world was I thinking? Slowly, we make it across the street and I'm already floored that I wasn't run over or that I didn't eat it in the middle of such a busy street.   Coach Beeker teaches me the basics and slowly we start up the street.  He promises we'll stop once we hit the 'yellow building'. Damn that yellow building. It was so far away in my mind. We make it there and I start getting the hang of it. I want to go further so he tells me to go to the clock tower... and then to the flags.... the second flags... the tent... this parking sign... to Fisherman's Wharf. I made it without a fall! *tine's head starts inflating*   My foot starts cramping and I'm hating on all the cobblestone at Fisherman's Wharf so we start heading back. In my head I thought,  the further we skated the further it was back to the car.  Great. We start back and I weave through people, through poles that are in my way. Beeker warns me of the sidewalk ramps, about accidently falling into the oncoming traffic.  I'm actually going to make it back to the car without a fall or scrape.     A truck decides to pull out of a driveway and stops. The street comes to sort of a decline and I pick up some speed (I'm sure it was barely anything but to me, I'm flying!). I sort of learned how to stop and I could somewhat turn and slow down. In this instance, no matter what I did, I wasn't slowing down and all of Embarcadero could hear me screaming, 'I'm not slowing down!'. Instead of smashing myself into the truck, I try to turn and eat it pretty bad on my elbow and left side. Beeker comes to the rescue, as well as some guys on a bike ready to beat down whoever it was that knocked me down. I assure everyone I'm fine and get up to sit down on the nearby bench. *tine's head starts deflating* I knew I jinxed it when I thought that I'd make it back unscathed.   I sit for a bit and finally gather enough courage to get up and skate back to the car. A few minutes later, I see the yellow building I was so scared of initially. A few more minutes and we're back to the street I first crossed. I'm back to the car in one piece and I hug Beeker to thank him for such a happy, fun day. Reminder to myself for my next rollerblading lesson: Buy elbow pads and learn how to turn.   After this crazy weekend, I'm in need of a long hot bath or a massage. Siskee?

       *random thought* I go in these crazy spurts of blogging.. one minute it's every day, maybe even a few times a day. Lately, it's going on the once or twice a week... odd phases.&nbsp; (The randomness probably stems from utter exhaustion.)  &nbsp;  Since I knew I wasn't planning on going out on Friday (because of this annual charity softball tourney), I decided to go out Thursday night with Beeker, Justin and Helen. We hit up Suede (the old Bas) and bump into my roomie, Alice and Nelly... My sister, Mykee, Angela and Albutt even decide to come out, too! Prior to coming out to party, I decided to play&nbsp;a bit of Kingdom Hearts after finishing work.&nbsp;&nbsp; Can you say addiction? I literally played for three hours and forgot&nbsp;to even eat&nbsp;dinner.&nbsp; It was 9pm and we needed to meet Justin at 10pm and I was still in my pjs. No dinner + drinking + drinking&nbsp;more soju&nbsp;= drunk tine  &nbsp;  Friday comes rolling around and I'm a zombie at work. I get through the day and stay home for the&nbsp;night to have&nbsp;some dinner and watch movies with Beeker. Nice and relaxing. Mmmm  &nbsp;  Saturday is the big softball tourney that I've been looking forward to all week.&nbsp; I've had this huge softball withdrawal ever since our work league finished up.&nbsp; Plus, to top it&nbsp;off it was a sour feeling that was left in my&nbsp;mouth when that league ended but that's another story for another day.&nbsp; Softball straight from 1:30-7:30 which entailed 4 games back to back. It's a single elimination tourney but we&nbsp;dominate the first two games&nbsp;18-2 and 16-3.&nbsp; In playoffs, we kill the next team 12-6.&nbsp; As we wait for the next game to begin, I see all these familiar faces from Twin Creeks - RINGERS! We also find out that the last&nbsp;game they played, they killed them 30-3.&nbsp;So yes, we lost this&nbsp;last playoff game and come in second BUT&nbsp;the score was 10-5. Nothing to be ashamed of, considering that a a six foot chick on their team hit&nbsp;further than any guy on my team.&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Body pain and massive headache sink in.&nbsp; (I flake on my friend's bday dinner because of this *sad* )  &nbsp;  I also made plans to meet up with the girls this same night. Not realizing softball would go this late, I still attempt to make it out to Oakland for Organic.&nbsp; I was bored and half dead, but it was nice to bump into friends I hadn't seen in a while. Plus, my friend Anna hooked it up so what the hey.  &nbsp;  Again, body pain sinks in even further when I wake up.  &nbsp;  I head to my parent's house for lunch to visit with my aunts/uncles in town from the east coast. I pick at my food and I'm out the door to meet up with Beeker to go rollerblading. Yes, you heard me correctly. After being half dead from Saturday, I still agree to go rollerblading.&nbsp; We drive up to the city, where the weather is absolutely beautiful! A day of rollerblading (errr, learning how to rollerblade)&nbsp;on the Embarcadero gave me such a better outlook of the city. I'm so used to seeing the urban gloomy side of the city.&nbsp; If only it was like this every day I wouldn't be such a suburbian girl.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Learning how to rollerblade is a story in itself for another post. I warned you of the randomness of this post.  &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;

       After work and last minute, I decide to go take up Beeker's invite to watch  urlLink Anchorman  with him and his roomie, Jon. Their other friend, Linda, comes along too and it turns out I'm really good friends with her boyfriend. The world is too small.  Anchorman was damn hilarious though (watching Beeker laugh hysterically next to me came in as a close second). If you liked  urlLink Old School , this movie will make you practically pee in your pants.

       Considering what time it is, I'm wide awake. I think it's from a nap I took earlier.  Weekends are never long enough for me. I set out to vacuum my house and do some laundry. Instead, I didn't vacuum and I did one load of laundry (an hour ago). Friday night started with dinner with Peggy. Her husband Tom (more Austin transplants)is in Paris for work again and it was perfect time to play catch up. Dinner ran a little late so getting home and out the door for Beeker's hockey game  lagged. I was supposed to be there at 9 and i get there almost half an hour late. Disappointing someone absolutely sucks! No matter how much I apologized, I still felt like shet. Luckily, it all worked out and their team kicks butt. I even got a few cool pictures. After the game, we head to the city for Joe/Carly's going away party. I make my cameo and off to Cloud 9 we go... We make a couple more rounds only to start craving for our usual late night tapsilog run.   Saturday starts off late coz I sleep in. Beeker decides to introduce me to a PS2 RPG game,  urlLink Kingdom Hearts . Imagine Disney intertwining with Final Fantasy. I play for 2 hours (it seemed like half an hour) and I'm addicted. So addicted that I'm late for a friend's bbq. I finally make it over there with a chocolate cake in hand. I meet a bunch of asian people with austrailian accents. Mmm...  I veg around my parent's house for a while and then finally head home to pass out. I get a call from some of the homies to head up to the city for a hip hop party (Apollo and Shortkut are supposed to spin that night so that usually guarantees grooving beats, lots of dancing, and a chilled out crowd).   Sunday I go to church with Beeker and somewhere in the middle of mass, I catch myself smiling. It felt good to be at church with someone else. I'm so used to hearing mass by myself or with my family. I quickly thank god for giving me such a happy moment. We watch  urlLink My Sassy Girl  and Beeker has mixed feelings about it. He's not too happy that Kyun-Woo is a  urlLink 'cuddlebitch' . Kingdom Hearts calls my name and again, it's hard to pull myself away from it.

             urlLink Kimmy  was sweet enough to share in her raffle winning of a free makeover.  Thanks! Really though, we didn't cheat with the pictures. We just really needed to look like we needed makeovers. Ha ha

       People have always told me that you're supposed to name everything in your life of importance. They should have some sort of identity. So, I named my car. My car's been with me since early college and has taken me everywhere I've needed to go (including Austin, TX!). I named her TB - Tempermental Beyatch. If you didn't drive my car, you'd be irritated about its quirks, you wouldn't understand all the different sounds, and you'd grow a bit impatient about how high maintenance she is.   It was time for TB's checkup at the repair shop so I drop it off at my pop's place. I come back later in the day to pick her up, only to find out there's all sorts of things wrong. First of all, there's a coolant leak they can't find. Then there's something else with the cylinder head (sp?) where it's causing the water and oil to mix. Does this all make sense?   It's at the point whether you debate on spending the money to fix her or put the money towards another car. Sad! I've grown to have such an emotional attachment - so much that I'm blogging about her!

       Being with someone you really genuinely care about shouldn't be a compromise...it's just supposed to flow. Everything just fits in place and you connect on every level. It's simple. It's not trivial.  It's hard not to second guess it though. It almost becomes a fear. There's a fear that it'll all one day disappear. It'll be some short lived infatuation that disappoints you.   So why is it human nature to question something so good?   Many times before, I held myself back from opening up fully to people I dated. I feared that I'd be judged, that I'd have to justify who I've become. I had to censor myself, almost like censoring the types of things I write about.   It's almost second nature for me to show someone all the potentially bad sides of me first. That's logic to me. You show someone all the quirks and faults. If he still wants to be there with you, then at least you know you're not wasting your time getting to know this person. Ironically, it's kind of hard to go through the laundry list of things you deem as faults, though.   Why in the world would I want to be so vulnerable to someone that may not look at you the same afterwards? There's absolutlely no logic in that...  I thought about it some more. I do it because I want the real thing. I don't have the time or patience to deal with immature or ignorant people.  I don't want to be someone that's "ideal" or "safe".  I want the fairy tale.

       I think I've eaten the equivalence of a cow this past three day weekend. (If you're vegan/vegetarian, I suggest you stop reading now.) Sunday, we went through fajitas, chicken, steak skewers, veggie skewers, korean short ribs, hot dogs, and more steak later on in the night. I think the grill was constantly being used all day/night long. To top that off, Alice brought some clams with linguine and my parents decided to make some pancit (noodles) for me too. It was a food fest, outside of the drinking. The sangria I made seemed to be a hit, especially the batch that I let sit overnight.   After making through this food fest and waking up with a lump in my stomach, I have a craving for  urlLink Max's of the Philippines . The fried chicken is so yummy there and Beeker who lives about 5 minutes away has never been there. We get there and the place is packed. Our tummies demand immediate gratification, so we go to another place around the corner -  urlLink Ongpin .   I'm soon realizing that filipino food is definitely not made for vegetarians/vegans. One time after a team outing, I decided to take my coworkers there. Most of them aren't too meat friendly but I figure that all the veggie dishes should be fine. I don't realize that they're cooked in beef/pork products until I actually think about it. I think there actually turns out to be one item on the whole menu that's vegetarian friendly. Bad choice. Maybe that's why i'm such a carnivore.  I digress.  Beeker and I fall into food coma. We're half alive/half sleeping when I get a call from my parents. They're bbqing at home since my brother's in town and want me to come over. I finally make my way back to my parent's house only to grub on more beef - hamburgers, beef sinigang (tamarind soup), pork bbq, and halo-halo (filipino dessert). Again, I'm stuck in food coma. Notice a pattern here?  The salad bar at work will definitely find more visits from me this upcoming week.

       It's Saturday night and I'm getting ready for my annual 4th of July bbq - it's usually family and close homies of mine that go. Along with the usual jello shots, I decided to make sangria for the first time. I  urlLink  googled  sangria recipes from one of my favorite restaurants in the city -  urlLink Cha Cha Cha . I decide to follow one of the suggestions and continue to also experiment. After tasting the jello shots and making sure the sangria is good to go (as well as make some graham cracker snacks), tine's one drunk puppy.  It's a pretty good indication of what's to become of the weekend.

       Ever have those blogging moments when you're craving to write but can't really pinpoint what it is that you want to write about? My mind's almost to capacity and I still can't figure out how to put it into words. These are the moments I reach for my good ole traditional journel and start jotting down random thoughts.

       You may think I'm a bit weird but I've never posted to  urlLink Craigslist  ever... part of me thought I'd be opening my world to the crazy people I fear. I've only had to find roomies once so far and I got lucky that time to find them but this time around, I considered Craigslist. With Beeker's guidance last night, I was able to post my first post to try and fill the vacancies in my house.

(I'd include the craigslist URL but it'll keep changing everytime I post.)  ~~  2 bedrooms in my townhouse have recently opened up and are available to be moved in September 1st.

       Last week while I was sick at home, I got a call from my college best friend,  urlLink Lori . After all these years of being with her boyfriend, Tony, he proposed to her a couple of weeks ago by romantically writing it in the sand. How sweet. I'm so absolutely ecstatic for her. To add to the tears of happiness, she continued the conversation by asking me to be one of her bridesmaids. We always talked about this in college, but I never thought time would fly that fast.   Part of me is so used to taking care of Lori. All through college, I whined about how much of a brat she was, but deep down inside I loved watching out for her. It's a good thing that she has such a good guy that now takes care of her.  She's up here this weekend visiting and I can't help but be nostalgic and emotional. I definitely missed her.   I know for fact that til I'm old and grey, I always know she'll be my shet-talkin' sidekick and that no matter how much time has passed, we'll always be able to pick up where we left off (just like this weekend).   Congratulations Lori and Tony!

       Again, a few days have passed and I haven't had the urge to blog at all.  You'd think that being gone for a week at work and being completely disconnected from the world would make me absolutely anxious to get back into the swing of things.  Blah. Maybe it's the meds. Luckily, today's my last day of meds and now it's just a matter of getting over this weird rut.    To update, I'm back to finding a new roomie. Errr, make that two new roomies. Within minutes of sending an email out concerning the room for rent, I get a call from one of the girls also telling me she's moving to the south bay to be closer to her job. Talk about timing.  If any of you know anyone looking for a room to rent in San Mateo, send them my way! (Responsible, genuinely laid back and dramafree people need only apply.)  Outside of that, despite being really tired, I'm restless right now. I'm so in the mood to go out all of the sudden.

       So I got a call from the Helpdesk on Friday. They weren't able to recover a single file on my hard drive and replaced the whole thing. There goes a bunch of work files, a ton of mp3s, and almost a year's worth of pictures. =( It's easier to accept after Beeker says, 'Oh well, time to make more memories...'
