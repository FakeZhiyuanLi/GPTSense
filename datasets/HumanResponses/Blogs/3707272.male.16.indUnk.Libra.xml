       urlLink Hillary's Fortress of Solitude   Please alleviate me of this idiotic senator that is Hillary Clinton.  Alright, I would like anyone and everyone to view this video that Hillary Clinton has linked to on her website.   urlLink This video  is her "video welcome message" to all of the website viewers.  Alright, I ask you once you have viewed this video to question her words, "...It will be my privilege to support our men and women in uniform during these uncertain times."  How can she say such things?  She goes over into Iraq a few months ago and lectures the armed forces on why it is wrong that they are there and then insults their president, why are Progressive members (Liberals) always going back on their words?  Ack anyways...She goes on to say "...Our economy has stalled and we need an economic plan that will actually create jobs, and opportunities in every corner of New York and our homeland security needs have not been met to the level that they are required, and great uncertainty exists in our war against terrorism. Aswell as the uncertainty of the potential conflict with Iraq and the situation in North Korea. These are challenging times....[blah, blah, blah]"  How many times has she contradicted herself by her actions?  Too much.  Why would she even say that economy is "stalled," it has been gaining so quickly that if you were to watch the stock volume your neck would ache before you fall on your bottom due to watching it grow so quickly. Also, many jobs have been created by the recovering economy that unemployment has gone down by .6 percent!  "Potential conflict?"  What the heck is that?  "Potential?"  I do not get it, this mean that she is denying that we just got over a WAR with Iraq's dictator.  *grunts before keeling over*  I love politics :/

        I was thinking to myself this afternoon about something that has been bothering me for quite some time now,  urlLink Republicans  and  urlLink Democrats .  Over my very short life I have come to the conclusion that both of these parties are completely corrupt and are not worth anyone's time except for those who wish to cater to the corrupt.  Even though I lean heavily to the right and I fully support capitalism and the degradation of the polar ice caps I have to say that Republicans are bending in the wind to the will of the Dems and  urlLink Super Liberals  .  I am especially annoyed by the sheer amount of crap that they will allow to get through.  My example is Arnold.  When the man first started campaigning and speaking I was rather impressed, I was amazed that a person coming from Hollywood could seem to be completely truthful and lean to the right at the same time.  He promised that he would repeal the bill proposed by Gray Dufus that would allow illegal aliens to obtain drivers licenses from their local DMV, this appealed to me.  Now the fellow is in full support of  urlLink  SB 1160 .    My beef with the Dems is a little more direct.  They are Socialists, Maoists, Marxists, and Communists.  I stand firm that anyone who thinks that spending billions on the welfare system will make anything better. (And DO NOT even say that i am not being "compassionate," I have been there)  I am directly hateful towards  urlLink  Hillary Clinton .    This woman is pushing for a "universal healthcare plan" that would ruin the American way and the American economy.  MY example, England, & Canada, did you know that American clinics, doctors, and praticies near the Canadian border actually advertise in Canada.  Why you ask?  Because the wait in Canada is MONTHS for a simple check-up at the doctors office so the Canadians go to the US for healthcare.  Why? You ask again, because they have a universal healthcare system that will "help" everyone.  How can something like that help anyone?  Lets role-play for a second: You are a Canadian and you wake up one morning and are sick, you go to the local "doctors" office and ask when the next appointment is available, they happily say that the next appointment open is August 15th.  You return home happily thinking to yourself that you are so lucky to have "free" healthcare.  Hold on, wait a minute...It is early June...Oh well, what luck to have such a lovely healthcare system.  More to come...
