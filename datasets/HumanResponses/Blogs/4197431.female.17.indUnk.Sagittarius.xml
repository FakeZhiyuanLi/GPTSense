        Garr! That pic in the last post was back in like March before some concert I went to. I didn't really fit in at the concert, nor do i wear hats, lol, but despite those problems it was alot of fun. Well last night Mikey and I were flipping through the channels on tv and ended up on MTV watching True Life "I'm in a same sex relationship" or something to that degree. I sat and watched the entire show (which is usually difficult for me to do) and I formulated an even stronger view that SAME SEX MARRIAGE SHOULD BE LEGAL! I'm not bi nor a lesbian (obviously), but i feel there should be equal rights for all. I understand people's agruments that "it's against God's will" or it's "not christian." Oh please, everyone of those people that stood at the doors to the court house should stand (and protest) at the lawyers office when a married couple files for divorce. In my opinion divorce is no means christian. Sure you can go to the church and ask that your marriage be annulled, and that's okay? ONLY after you pay hundreds of dollars! Wait, that seems pretty hypocritical to me. From what I observed on television, none of those couples wanted to get married in a church setting, they all got married at a courthouse. All those diehard christians out there..if church was such a sacred sacrament why can people get married outside the church? I JUST DON'T UNDERSTAND! I'm all for religion, I even went to a Cathloic school from kindergarten through eighth grade, but when it comes to legality and benefits (insurance, etc) marriage should be an option to EVERYONE despite religion. HELLO, separation of church and state! Okay, I'm only 17 and may not be to familiar with the legal system, but I grew up being taught that "everyone is equal"..thanks to the good old declaration. Speaking of politics, I wish i could vote in the next election sooo bad! DAMN my birthday! (vote Bush  OUT!)  tehehe. Anyhoo, work sucked today..I would look at the clock "4:00"..think to myself, "Only 2 more hours"...look at the clock, i swear 10 minutes later..."4:01" ..damnit all! My mom left for Jerzee today, wont be back til Sunday. She ran out the door saying I can use her car, and I will, i repeat, I WILL take advantage of that one! yay! I'm itching to go drive it somewhere...I think I'll go do that...
