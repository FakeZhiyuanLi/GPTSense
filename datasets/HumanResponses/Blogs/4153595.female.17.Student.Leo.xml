      This b*TCH(my mother) decided that since i can't remember to turn the water off in the basement(pipes broke in kitchen so to use the w.c. or brush teeth or whatever, we have to shut off the main valve.) that she feels she needs to take my car away.   Number one you didn't pay for that car MY DAD DID!!!!, number two how am i supposed to get to work, cocksucker? Number three I need to take my damn drivers test on thursday, so thanks to her I can't practice and I'm going to fail.

      We went to daddy's friend's party today , he had waiters there, buy the waiters worked for him.  It was hilarious because when Jazzy and I walked into the house, they were eyeing us.  We sat down to eat and lo and behold here they come.  It was funny cuz they start making small talk how old are you 17 and 14  oh ok we're 16 and 17.  The one guy who said he was 17 was lying cuz he looked grown as hell!!!  lmao.  But all in all, today was a good day too.

      Today was kinda ruff, i woke up, well rather Kim did and told me to get up so we could work out.  Well I had a migraine due to the 900 calories a day and a gallon of water thing, you know.  So I just had a good morning.  Afternoon i walked down the street and made some 13-14 year old boys drool. FUN!!!  Later on I got a phone call from Shana talked to her, I guess her and Jamar are back together, but as she so eloquently put it, "IT STILL FEELS A LIL FUNKY."  My sweety called and I called him back and he was saying how he missed me and he loved me and all that mushy stuff.  I also told him the same, but I told him how late at night I get the urges, and he's not there to satisfy them.  He's pissed now cuz he's got football training so when I come home, he still won't see me for a week or so.  Poooooorr BAAAAAABYYYYY

      I feel kinda down, but kinda not, maybe cuz it's ABOUT THAT TIME maybe not...I felt kinda down about my body yesterday, but i don't know if it's just me, but i think i'm losing weight.  I walk 5 miles a day, lift weights, tone, and eat under 1200 calories a day.  Oh boy....
