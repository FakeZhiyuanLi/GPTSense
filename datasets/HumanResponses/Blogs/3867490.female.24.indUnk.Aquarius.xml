      Ahhhh, two days of pure relaxation ahead of me.  I just took a shower, dried my hair, now I get to get all prettied up to go to Birmingham!  Erin and I are going to dinner tonight at  220   (the restaurant's name, not the time).  Anyone who has never been there should go.  And get the caprisi salad.  Yummy yummy in my tummy.  It's a really upscale, classy (read: expensive) restaurant, but it has a great atmosphere.  We're going shopping for guys for Erin.  I'm just along to be the ugly friend.  :)   I have a feeling we'll be staying out late, maybe at the Townsend for drinks.  $14 chocolate martinis but damn are they to die for.  Saturday is supposed to be spent on Pete's friend's dad's boat, weather permitting, and Sunday we're heading up to my parents' for dinner and to pick up the cooler and solar showers for camping next week.  We're leaving Thursday evening, so I get a four-day workweek!

      Pete really impressed me.&nbsp; He's had something lined up for yesterday for a while (in celebration of our 1 yr ann.) &nbsp;and wouldn't tell me what it was.&nbsp; I was told to pack a picnic lunch and bring long pants, a sweatshirt, and some walking shoes.&nbsp; Naturally I think: some sort of hike in the woods.&nbsp; We went up to 7 Lakes State Park and had a wonderful picnic, including a bottle of my favorite wine.&nbsp; We weren't allowed to have alcohol there, but we managed to hide it from the DNR officers.&nbsp; It felt like high school all over again.&nbsp; :)&nbsp;&nbsp; After our picnic and playing in the park, he drove me to the big suprise which was ... (drumroll please) ... a hot air balloon ride!!&nbsp; It was one of the coolest things I've ever done.&nbsp; It was so peaceful being able to float above the trees and look down on people sitting on their porches, horses in the pastures, and deer running in the fields.&nbsp; Our pilot looked exactly like Stephen King, but luckily he didn't kill us.&nbsp; We all (there were eight passengers including us) landed in someone's front yard, but they were cool about it.&nbsp; There's a van with a trailer following you the whole way, so when you land you can just pack your shit up on the van and drive away.&nbsp; At the end we had a champagne toast, which we learned is a tradition after every balloon ride.&nbsp; I got home from it around eleven and went straight to sleep.  While we were doing our thing on Saturday, my brother had a party at his condo that we missed.&nbsp; Apparantly, everyone thought Pete was going to propose to me that night.&nbsp; People were making bets that it would happen, and Brian even called our mom, "Did Pete call dad to ask for permission to marry Shelly?"&nbsp;&nbsp; "No."&nbsp; "You'd tell me if he did, right."&nbsp;&nbsp; They didn't want to call us directly because they actually thought (and this is a direct quote) "that you guys would be doing it in the woods somewhere."&nbsp; Ha ha ha Pete and I were laughing our asses off when we found out. &nbsp;

      That quote was uttered by the anesthesiologist as our Philippino patient was getting an operation to put his fibula back inside his leg.&nbsp; Work is fun.&nbsp;&nbsp; :)  I went out today and bought a portable basketball net for Pete that I'll give him tomorrow.&nbsp; I hope he likes it.&nbsp; It's pretty cool (and fucking expensive) but at least we won't have to walk a mile to go to the elementary school to play anymore.&nbsp; I'm excited to see what he's got up his sleeve for Saturday.&nbsp; All I've been told is that he'll bring the wine, we're having a picnic, and he's providing the "entertainment."&nbsp; I've also been told that the "entertainment" is not a stripper.&nbsp;&nbsp; :)  To whom this may apply:&nbsp; Do NOT buy the Outkast CD.&nbsp; It's downright horrible!&nbsp; No ear-gasm for me.&nbsp; Kristin and I went halfsies on it, and she offered to give me my money back because it sucks.&nbsp; It's like someone took a shit and molded it into two God-awful cd's.

      I had a tiring weekend!  Erin is moving out of her boyfriend's house, so we spend Saturday apartment-hunting.  She found a few online that she wanted to take a look at.  We went to three of those (I think) but only got to see one.  It seems like all of those places had really nice clubhouses and workout facilities, but the apartments were shitholes.  They reminded me of college apartments.  I told suggested we take a look at the apartments that I used to live at.  She loved them, signed the papers, and should be in by Friday at the latest!  :)  Later that night we had fondue (yum!) at my brother's condo and saw Anchorman.  Will Farrell is the shiznit.  I don't know how he can keep a straight face doing the comedy he does.  It's definately worth seeing.  Two words:  Jazz Flute  Today was spent garage saleing around the Birmingham area.  We didn't find that many, but the ones that we did go to were selling absolute crap.  I would be embarrassed trying to sell most of the stuff these people put out.  People:  if it's garbage and looks shitty, just freaking throw it away!  Don't waste my time!

      Ok so Friday night was friggin crazy.  Erin and I had dinner at 220, which was delicious.  We went to the bar area of the restaurant afterwords and sat down for a few drinks.  Who did we see sitting two seats down?  Why yes, you're right, it was George Blaha, the Voice of the Pistons.  The guy is about 65 years old and had a bunch of 20-somethings crowded around him.  He was sitting on a stool and these whore practically had their tits rubbing up against his head.  I turned to Erin and said, "Damn, I didn't know George Blaha got so much pussy."  We were talking to some 40-something guys, one was nice and the other was drunk off his ass.  He was so drunk I thought he was retarded when he first talked to us.  "What's your name?"  "My name is Shelly."  "Is that spelled with a Z?  or an X?"  "Huh?"  "S-H-E-X....  the X must be silent."      Freak.   I had a dream later that night, in my alcohol-induced slumber, that I ran across that guy and found out he had his elbows and knees stolen.  Later on, some Rico Suave-wannabe leaned over to us and five girls around us and said, "I've just inhereted a lot of money.  The only stipulation is that I have to spend it all by midnight, so I'm going to buy all seven of you a drink."  We looked at him like he was crazy but he kept insisting, so we all got a drink.  That was the worst pickup line I have ever heard.  Did he think he was going to get a one-in-seven chance of getting some legs spread???      After that we went to the club Posh, because Erin knows the owner.  We walked in, and it was nothing but Chaldeans.  We were the only two white people in there aside from the bouncers and bartenders.   Erin said it's never been like that, it was just a weird night and Fridays are usually not busy at most clubs anyway.   We walk up to the bar and get some drinks.  Then two guys walk up on either side of us at the same time and start talking.  We tell them we're not interested, that we're already in relationships, but they insist that's not what they want and keep talking anyway.  That's fine, I'm not going to be rude.  Eventually Erin goes to the bathroom, comes back, and we talk to them a little longer.  All of a sudden she goes, "Where's my key?!?!"   Oh shit.  Our purses are locked in her car.  We run into the bathroom and check it out, even though she swears she had it when she left the bathroom.   No luck.  And we notice the guys have disappeared.  I tell her I'm going to go stand next to the car, because I'll be damned if someone steals it and my purse.  Not my smartest move.  After I get out there I realize 'oh crap, I'm all alone in a deserted parking lot in Ferndale.   What the hell am I going to do if someone does come to steal the car?  Or rape me for that matter?'   I stand out there for twenty minutes with no one coming out there, luckily, and then it's two o'clock and the bar is getting out.  Fuck this, I'm not standing out here with a bunch of guys walking toward the lot  (mind you, we're parked in a church lot half a block down the road).  I start walking toward the club and halfway there Erin is walking out with a bouncer.   And her key!   She told me she made the bouncers seal off all of the exits.  She threatened them with calling the owner and having him fire them if the didn't.  The bouncers were looking around with her.  She tried calling Carlo to see if he'd come and help us, but he didn't answer.  She tried calling the owner, Vladimir, to see what he could do, but he wasn't home.  I couldn't call anyone because my cell was in the car, so were our keys if we got a ride home and left the car there.    She ended up walking around to the other side of the bar and saw a glimmer under a table from the strobe light:  the key.  It was completely on the other side of the bar, nowhere near where we had been all night.  We never left the spot we went to when we first came in, except for her using the bathroom.  We figured the two guys must have taken it when she wasn't looking, then dropped it when they realized no one was leaving until she found her key.  One of the guys was talking about wanting to be a car salesman, so we figured the asswipe was going to steal the car, strip it, and sell it for parts.  The whole ride home all I heard from Erin was "Fucking Chaldeans!!!!   Eat shit and die!"   After our near-heart attacks, we went home.  Hopefully camping this weekend will go a lot more smoothly than clubbing did last weekend.
