      From: Arnold Delos A. Delos Reyes  Duddle, 02/16/2004:  Let's face it, a 'barkada' without  Jag's kind of personality is frankly a  type of friendship without meaning....  A niggard, slow-witted, a complete  dupe, a lad with lewd character,  definitely a jester, pornographically  defined 'dud', a man with his own  dictionary (squerrel, I can't breth,  acostic, suvinier, etc.), the  barkada's 'fungus'...always itchy, a  guy with imaginary boobs, a schizo...  just name it, he has 'em all.  Well a lot of people misjudge him.  They thought he's a type of guy who  live's life to the 'foolest'. A happy-  go-lucky guy as they said. But they're  wrong - he's just peculiar in his own  way. The only thing that i notice with  this guy is that he always  faces 'dilemma' especially in terms of  making personal decisions...always  facing conflict...choosing between two  unwelcome alternatives.  But do not under estimate this man.  Though he's a very transparent guy,  there are still things that u need to  explore about him - and that I think  is his inner self...once u did that, I  suppose u'll understand why he became  ur friend.  A presence of his is so  delighting...subtle yet grand...loud  yet silent...and A VERY GOOD FRIEND.  Hail to the chief of all total  byatch!!!! Ciao! Ü      From: Melani Feir Sabile  Maersk. araw-araw mo ba namang makasama  at makakwentuhan...kundi ka pa ba naman  maging close at saka wala akong  choice...anim lang kami sa grupo. kahit  lagi ako inaaway nito, i know di niya  naman ako matitiis. di ba kuya Jag?  kahit most of the time diko sya  maintindihan..iniintindi ko na lang  kasi alam ko feeling ng mga autistic.  hahaha! seriously speaking,sobrang bait  niyan ni Jag and i will never forget  yung times na lagi kaming magkasama sa  gimik, sa panonood ng sine at sa  church.
