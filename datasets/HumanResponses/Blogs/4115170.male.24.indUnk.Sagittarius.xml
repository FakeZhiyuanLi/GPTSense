      At the request of my passionate sister, I am setting up this blog to present a second side of our adventure and where it takes us. The sister site is  urlLink http://sibs-ontheroad.blogspot.com . So, I'm not full of literal history and significance. What I see is what you get, take it for what it's worth and develop your own opinion.  Never before have I spent as much time with Joy-Marie as I soon will. This will definitely be an experience to remember. The general idea is to travel cross-country with a loaded pickup from New York City to San Francisco while stopping in Colorado. Everything else is a possibility, an unknown idea, an adventure. I'm mostly excited about the stops at the national forests and state parks we may make. Joy is kind of the director and I'm the actor along for the ride. She says we fight a lot. I prefer to think of our confrontations as passionate disagreements.  I leave tomorrow from Colorado Springs, CO to meet Joy in NYC. I'm hoping for an uneventful journey that has me arriving in New York by Friday. Once I get there the adventure begins.

      First, let's note that the Latin etymology of   sib  , a version of sibling, is   suus   - "one's own," which Merriam Webster links to the word   suicide  . To be fair, M-W also notes it with the Latin   sodalis   - "comrade."  So, will Brandon be a comrade who drives me to suicide? Or will I drive him to suicide? Mom has already warned me that he won't let me drive.  In 1950 anthropologist Meyer Fortes observed "Next to the bond between mother and child none is so strong as that between siblings by the same mother, " ( Systems of Kinship ) . In 1974 Jennie Melville wrote in her novel  Nun's Castle  "Siblings and kinsfolk did not have to be friends."  In few days, Brandon leaves Black Forest, Colorado to pick me up in New York City. I've been a graduate student here for the last 2 years. We'll pack my books in his green pick-up truck with camping gear and a cooler, and we'll take to the two-lane highways back to my home-base in San Francisco. The plan is to take it slow and enjoy the journey.  I've set up this blog, a travel-log, for our family and friends and whomever else is interested in the cross-country travels of a brother and sister. We're not the White Stripes, nor the Carpenters, nor the Osmonds, nor the Gyllenhaals. We're neither hip, rich, famous, or thin -- but we fight a lot. It should be fun.

      Never had any intention of responding to any of Brand’s blog-gripings, but his latest tale of our Black Hills morning keeps bugging me. So I’ll post my side, and let it stand for all future responses.  When we woke up, he was set on driving up to the camp store for cinnamon rolls and “perhaps take a shower.” So not knowing how long he would take, I wanted to get my Mark Twain and coffee set-up; I was to stay w/ the tent on the edge of the lake. I offered to go up to the truck, but he said he had it. Fine. I started rolling up the sleeping bags. He comes down w/ a bag full of stuff I never asked for. Sweet foresight I suppose. Anyway, he knows that years of waitressing have drilled into me “hands in, hands out” – never make an empty-handed trip. I asked him to take   1   sleeping bag with him on his trip to the truck to get the rolls.    Brandon:   No, cuz I’ll have to pull it out again to when we pack the truck.   Joy:   Well yes, but that’ll be easier than having to haul it w/ all the other stuff we have down here.   Brandon:   No, I’ll just have to pull it out.   Joy:   So put in my seat and I’ll pull it out.   Brandon:   No!   Joy:   Why are you being such an asshole?  Yes, that was wrong. I should have said “Why are you being so stubbornly unreasonable?” So he called me a bitch. When he returned I hadn’t used any of the stuff in the bag because I only asked for the coffee and book. I didn’t have a match to light the propane for the coffee, so I proceeded to take down camp. By the time he returned, I had everything packed and I was folding up the tent. He took less time than I expected, so I never got to the book, yadayada.  What I learned is that Brandon is uncompromisable when he first wakes up. And when he doesn’t feel like doing something, he throws out some lame excuse instead of being honest. My mistake was getting trapped in arguing w/ his excuse and not recognizing his code for “I just don’t feel like it.” Later that night when we were setting up camp in the Badlands, and he furnished another excuse for something he was just too tired to do. I told him: Just tell me you don’t feel like it; you’re too tired. I can always understand that. He said he’ll try. Meanwhile I’ll brush up on my code.

      Here's how it "really" happened. (Thursday) The morning was spent packing up and taking Joy to Notre Dame for pictures and such. From South Bend, ID we stopped at some sand dunes on the southern shore of Lake Michigan in ID. It was beautiful, the sand was so fine in places. Traffic through Chicago, IL was a mess, a rainy rush-hour mess. Chicago is the city that never ends, suburbia central. She's getting better with the map, but still curses the map publishers for making "crappy" maps. We finally made it to the Mississippi River where we set up camp on an open field site of a state park in the dark. A fire at night and a fire in the morning. I'm getting really good at starting a nice fire with nothing more than a match and the materials from the wild.  (Friday) We awoke, saw the huge river, then proceeded along to Galena, IL. It was an old mining town with a main street riddled with country stores. Time for a big push, we had to drive across Iowa to make it to the Missouri River. After just getting into Iowa, Joy decides to spill half a box of Cherios; at least it was on her side by the door. (fyi, there are still Cherios spilt in the truck) We passed the place where the movie  Field of Dreams  with Kevin Costner was filmed, but didn't stop. Lots and lots of corn fields. In this area they add an Ethanol additive (from corn) to their gas to provide a cleaner fuel. At first I though this was a good idea, until I realized my truck traveled 25% fewer miles; basically, a person must burn much more clean fuel to reach the same distance negating the positive environmental impact. Good idea, they just need to learn how to improve the efficiency. Somewhere around here Joy realizes that she lost her medicine; this means pulling to the side of the road for 10 minutes to look. We managed to make it to a State Park on the border of South Dakota and Nebraska sometime after dark. It was a lake off the Missouri River that Louis and Clark passed on their famous journey.  (Saturday) At this point all I have on my mind is the realization that we will make it in time for the annual Sturgis Motorcycle Rally. After massive indecisiveness we finally decided to do some back-woods camping off Lake Pactola. For those that don't know, "back-woods" camping is setting up camp in a non-established area or site, basically a mile from an existing campsite or service center and 250 feet from the nearest road. We spotted a spot, then headed off to Sturgis. Never before have I seen so many bikes, or so many people trying to feel "hard-core". I loved it, hundreds, maybe thousands of free-flying enthusiasts thundering across mystical woods upon majestic chariots. I hope to find myself at the Sturgis Rally again someday. That evening, Joy's paranoia really came out as she remembered her Hollywood horror flicks of  The Blair Witch  and the  Halloween  films with Jason. She hardly slept last night because she was afraid of some country psycho attacking us in the middle of the night. I don't really understand it; my experience has taught me that people bring me most of my problems, hence avoid people then avoid problems. (problems with nature; that's life) Joy on-the-other-hand finds comfort with people because she feels others will protect her or come to her aid. Two conflicting views of people and problems, country vs. city. What's your opinion?  (Sunday) The last thing I want to start my day with is nagging; it puts me in a bad mood. (mom, ya know what I mean) (btw, whoever doesn't want to read our vulgar interaction, skip the next few sentences) OK, here we go; so I wake up and take some stuff to the truck on my way to get Joy's coffee, book, and her cereal out of the goodness of my heart. Upon returning to the site, I tell her that I'm going to get some cinnamon rolls from the campground store down the road. She tells me to take a load of sleeping bags to the truck. I say no, that's not really a good idea because we'll just have to unload it to pack the stuff for coffee. Then she has the audacity to seriously say, "Why are you being such an ASSHOLE?" I'm thinking, excuse me did you just call me an asshole after I fetched a bag full of shit for you. The words that came out of my mouth were, "I said no, BI*!H, get over it." I then walked away to get the cinnamon rolls. When I returned, I found that she didn't even use anything I fetched for her (it turns out that I was the only one with fire, oops). Anyway, we packed up camp with minimal communication, then went to a place we could shower. From this point on it was a loving relationship as usual as we are, with no further mention of the incident. The moral of the story is, don't talk to Joy before she has had her coffee and don't call me names or nag when I've just woken up. Later today we saw Mount Rushmore and the building of Mount Crazy Horse. I can't believe the prices for just parking your car, $8 and $18 respectively. (FYI, I bought a Golden Eagle Passport National Park Pass for $65 just for this trip. This way we could avoid entrance fees. We haven't been able to use it yet, and I'll be upset if it doesn't get used on this trip at all.) We also went to Wind Cave NP, but didn't take a tour because we want to get to the Badlands soon. Anyway, today was the first day that we've been able to get a decent start on this whole trip. With any luck, today will also be the first time since last Sunday that we set up camp during the daylight.  This by-far has been my most extensive road-trip ever. I'm very thankful that Joy and I get to experience it together.

      Brandon is one of those individuals who knows 90% of everything and almost never makes a mistake. His favorite phrase is “It’s a matter of perspective.” The setting sun finds us peering down a steep rocky hill off Pactola Lake, trying to decide whether the bottom, lakeside, will be our back-country campsite. Can we make it down there after midnight (cuz we’re on our way to Sturgis for the evening), can we find it and make it down there after midnight with all our gear and set up camp—did I mention after midnight. It’s a matter of perspective. He sees an adventure; scorn to those afraid of the unknown. I see a really dumb idea. We compromised, and made it down a different, not so rocky steep hill after midnight.

       upon marvelling at the brigade of bloody insects on the windshield somewhere along I-90 Minnesota     Joy  : I wonder if mosquito bites irritate cows as much as they do people.    Brandon  : Well, there are three ways a cow can deal with the itch of an insect bite. The first, and most obvious, is to slap it with his tail. Second, the cow can twitch the muscle of the itching area ( visual example accompanied ). And third, the cow can stomp his hoof really hard to relieve the itch. And there you have it: the three ways a cow can deal with insect bites.  He’s a fountain of information.

      Brandon isn’t fit to be a younger brother. He should’ve been born first. He won’t concede anything to me as an older sister; I don’t know any more nor have any more experience than him. I’ve led such a sheltered life, holed up in my university books, useless. This irritated me at first because he was claiming a higher learning curve than me. But when the discussion turned to who has more traveling clothes, and he does because although I have a higher number of pants & shirts, his few are inherently larger, therefore he has more clothing. Yes, this actually occurred. Here, I realized what do I care to be the older one; what do I care about being more. Let it be him. He will always treat as though he’s my big brother: chastising me when I lose things and tossing up pedantic “you-get-what-you-deserve” philosophy.  We’re reaching for Mississippi Palisades State Park, on the border of Iowa. He’s driven the whole way, and I’m cool with sitting back in the passenger’s seat. I think he plays math games in his head—like who puts more beer in the bottle, Canada or ‘merica.

      OK, so Wed. morning when we're leaving the camp-site, I mention to her to put the cap on her water jug when she's not using it so it doesn't spill. She says she's got it. . . well, now we're driving in downtown Toronto. I brake for a light, to my massive amazement, the jug of water spills on the cup-holder and gear shifter. I almost threw the jug out the window, luckily I didn't. Water on my truck is one thing, but it scares the shit out of me when she drinks coffee with my computer on her lap (I know her computer history). Issue 2, there's so much crap everywhere. I understand we've got a full load, there's lots of stuff, but damn. It's a sign when you lose your wallet a dozen times in 5 days. Her side of the cab looks like her room, and for anybody that's ever seen her room, ya know what I mean. I must be firm, my side (from the arm-rest to my door) will have none of her crap. Issue 3, we're working on it, but Joy needs to work on her navigating skill a bit. When we're driving down the road and I'm needing to know my exit or directions, I don't need to hear "I don't know" or "It doesn't say". I need her best guess, or gut instinct, something. I understand this takes a little experience and getting used to maps, so I'm giving her time. Wow, I feel better after getting that off my chest.  Here's what we've been up to. From Buffalo we crossed to border to Canada. They didn't like Joy's plants and didn't like me saying that my camping knife could be used as a weapon, but none-the-less, they allowed us to pass. Niagara Falls kicked ass. We walked along the Canadian river front, rode the Maid of the Mist, and crossed the Rainbow bridge. We both really enjoyed all of Niagara Falls. Joy's learned how to post pictures from her new digital camera, so you can see what we're talking about. From there we drove to the east side of Toronto to camp on Lake Ontario and a Province Park (like a state park). For dinner, I had a greasy double patty mushroom, onion, cheese burger from the 5th Wheel truck stop. Warning for anybody thinking about stopping at a 5th Wheel truck stop, it comes out faster than it goes in. Wednesday morning we drove around downtown Toronto and passed the supper-needle, tower thing. From Toronto, we drove South Bend, Indiana. Last night I walked around the Notre Dame campus while Joy worked on the computer. From here we head west toward Mt. Rushmore, I'm not sure if or where we'll be stopping; let's see what happens. -- Dare to walk with courage.

      Driving down the QEW, back to the border  Took my morning walk along a lapping Lake Ontario. Last night we camped at Darlington Provincial Park, just north of Toronto. Next to a nuclear plant, Darlington serves as a “spectacular example of how nature and industry can coexist.” I never imagined the Great Lakes to be so expansive. Whenever I’m on a cliff off Highway 1, I have the most ethereal feeling that the earth ends with the Pacific Ocean. Standing on the edge of Lake Ontario, with the heavy clouded sky doubling over, is like peering into a great whole in the middle of the planet. Forget the logic of the science, the feeling is a pre-Galilean thrill.  ...

      August 10 from the landing strip at Buffalo's airport  Brandon summed it all up on the dot, and this mythic "early start" keeps eluding us. i was disappointed to miss the open hours of harriet tubman's home, and in our rush to get to senecca falls before nightfall, we forgot to visit her grave down the street.  new york farm country is ghostly old. red barns and dells, 3-story wood-slated houses, dairy cows, corn, and cemetaries. it all floats like fog in an old scooby-doo cartoon. i've been quite the audubon naturalist collecting rattlebox, queen anne's lace, something like hemlock, and another i've named magenta candle. now the maiden in the mist is hollarin at me, late again.

      We woke up late and that made us late for everything else.  We missed Harriet Tubman, National Women's History Museum, and the night lighting of Niagra Falls because we were just too late.  The drive was nice through the hill country of mid-New York.  Our discussions were nice.  We stayed the night at a motel just outside Buffalo.  At some point some bugs feasted on Joy's feet, but luckily I've had no problem.  Today, hop the border.  I hope they let us back inn.

      Well, I'm a litle behind on my postings, so here's a day-by-day update.  Thursday the 5th I arrived safely in the Big Apple after 50 hours, 1,800 miles, 1 hitchhiker, and one motel.  The drive was fine and I avoided the bad weather.  Joy and I had dinner and margaritas at a local mexican restruant, Pancharita.  From there we hung-out at her apartment and got very little packing done.  After she went to bed, I explored the area a little bit and had a drink at the Four Faced Liar.  Friday the 6th To avoid parking tickets and the high cost of garages, we attempted to juggle my truck by parking it on the street during the evening and using a parking garage during the day.  That didn't work out so well.  For two days, I ended up totaling with 4 parking tickets, $23 for garage space, and $10 in parking meters.  I don't think I'll return with my truck for a while, or at least until my plates change.  During the day I spent most of my time and $50 at the Strand, a great bookstore on Manhattan.  For dinner, Joy and I visited with cousins Liz, Dore, and Alegra.  Good food, a nice blueberry pie and tasty scotch.  After dinner was the unorganized farewell gathering with friends.  We walked a lot and ended up at a bar called 119 for a couple of drinks.  From there we got a few 6-packs and hung-out at the apartment, I enjoyed the relaxed hang-out session.  Saturday the 7th Bad time for a hang-over.  Joy packed while I hauled all her crap down 3 flights of stairs and stuffed it in my truck.  She refused to get rid of anything and even picked up a lamp that the maintenance people pulled out of the neighbors apartment.  I'm impressed that I was able to fit all of it in the truck.  We didn't get out of NYC until after nightfall.  We stayed the evening in a classic apartment off the downtown square in Hudson, NY.  Good connections through Joy's friend Heath.  Sunday the 8th Breakfast at the diner down the street and coffee at the coffee shop across the street.  The coffee street has web access at a customer computer (using it now).  Also found a camping spot at the Lake Toghkanic State Park, nice and quiet because the weekend was ending.  Veggie dinner comple with Portabella burger, vegie shish-kabob, vegie stew.  I'm going to need a fat, juicy steak when this trip is over.  Funny thing, Joy got lost trying to find her way back to the campsite in the dark.  I guess I should keep a closer eye on her before the boogy-man gets her.  She sometimes gets paranoid of the unknown.  Monday the 9th Late start.  Posting blog in Hudson before leaving for Niagra Falls.  TTFN

      August 8, 2004 Lake Taghkanic State Park Campsite G-18  Camping during the week means the only pests we'll have to battle are a few insects. Hudson is in Columbia County, which is stuffed with B&B's and antiques shops like . We hooked up a sweet campsite at Lake Taghkanic, a fisher's paradise--chain pickerel; largemouth, smallmouth and rock bass; bluegill; pumpkinseed sunfish; yellow perch; brown bullhead; and the occasional cisco in deep waters. Brandon shot a turkey with his bow and arrow, and I got lost in the pitch black woods for a couple hours. Jumping off Niagara Falls is next.

      August 7 Anna's Apartment Hudson NY  We didn't arrive here until nearly 3am. Packing with a hangover takes a lot longer than it should. Last night after dinner w/ Dore, Liz, & Allegre (Liz makes the best blueberry pie!), we went out with some friends for a last binge. We didn't get to bed until well after 4am. Finally got the truck packed to the gills around 10pm; I even got to keep a 1970s-style chandelier the superintendent was throwing out. Brand & I had one last farewell drink at the Slaughtered Lamb before finally hitting the road for Hudson.  Hudson is a "Sleepy Hollow" town two hours north of Manhattan; we took the Rip Van Winkle Bridge to cross the Hudson River. My friend Heath is working as the Gaffer on a feature film up here. Hudson is a small town, and the film crew has booked every hotel room in town and half the ones in the next. Luckily, Heath hooked Brand &amp; I up with Anna, the set dresser, who let us crash at her place. It's actually a run-down building the film will be using as a location set. Thanks Anna!

      At the request of my passionate sister, I have set up a blog account to comment and provide a second point of view to our adventure and where it takes us. So, I'm not full of literal history and significance. What I see is what you get, take it for what it's worth and develop your own opinion. Never before have I spent as much time with Joy-Marie as I soon will. This will definitely be an experience to remember. The general idea is to travel cross-country with a loaded pickup from New York City to San Francisco while stopping in Colorado. Everything else is a possibility, an unknown idea, an adventure. I'm mostly excited about the stops at the national forests and state parks we may make. Joy is kind of the director and I'm the actor along for the ride. She says we fight a lot. I prefer to think of our confrontations as passionate disagreements. I leave today from Colorado Springs, CO to meet Joy in NYC. I'm hoping for an uneventful journey that has me arriving in New York by Friday. Once I get there the adventure begins.
