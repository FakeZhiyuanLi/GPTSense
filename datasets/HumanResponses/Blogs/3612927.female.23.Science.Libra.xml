      so my friend tracie sent me this website,  urlLink NYC Fireworks , and it's kewl.  go there.  so the other day i was eating dinner at home w/ my mom, dad and brother...and we got on the discussion of monica lewinsky and bill clinton's affair.  i was saying how i thought that monica was just being young and stupid in thinking that she could ever have anything more w/ clinton than a sorrid affair.  i wasn't saying this as a bad thing, i was just making a point that eveyone has been, is, or will be young and stupid in their lives.  love kinda clouds your thinking, maybe she was in love, who knows.  as for clinton, we all know why he got involved, b/c he's kind of a horn ball and saw a young intern who was lookin' to score...haha.  i still think he was a WAY better president than bush could ever or will ever be, but regardless, back to monica...    my other point was that monica wanted to get involved w/ clinton to help her career in washington since she was an intern.  i then said the following;  "monica just wanted to get ahead."   just say that out loud and think about it.  haha.  she did get  "a head"  alright!!  we were rolling b/c shit like that comes out of my mouth kinda frequently and it's almost always funny.  yeah.    something else...so i was driving home from wegmans tonight and i saw a shephard mix dog walk across the road.  i pulled into an old store that is closed w/ a parking lot and called the dog over.  she was friendly.  i checked her collar for tags, but there was only her state licencing tag.  no other identification, like the owner's name, address or phone #.  that pissed me off.  since it was like 10:30pm, the SPCA which is right down the road from where this dog was wandering, was closed.  also, i had forgotten my cell phone at home, so i couldn't call anyone about it.  bringing this dog home was not an option, but i would've kept her overnight and taken her to the SPCA in the morning if she would've gotten into my car.  she didn't want to though, so she walked away from me.  that's the last i saw of her.  i felt really bad that i didn't do more.  i hope that she makes her way back home and doesn't get hurt on the way.  i hate feeling helpless b/c i know that there were things that i could do.    also i'll get up on my soap box for this one.  if you have a dog or cat or other pet that can escape, PLEASE put a collar w/ a tag w/ your information on it on the pet.  also a rabies vaccination tag on the collar helps too b/c people may be less afraid to approach a stray animal if they know it has been vaccinated.  the rabies tag ID # can also be tracked back to an owner by veterinary clinic on the tag.  also, if the animal has a tag on w/ the owner's info or a tag saying that the pet had a microchip there is at least someplace that someone who finds the animal can call to help get the pet back to its owners.  i got a tag w/ my info on it from an internet site for free!  they are cheap if you buy them other places too!    **so please people, if you have pets and you want to give them the best chance of returning home if they are found by an honest person who doesn't want to steal your pet PLEASE buy a collar for them (that fits snug and won't fall off), and put their rabies tag, microchip tag (if they have one) and a tag with the owner's info on it!**  so i'm off of my soap box now...and this post is toast...

      this adkins thing has gone way too far...  urlLink low carb potatoes   people need to lay off the low carb thing and just eat smaller portions of the foods that they like.  low carb products taste like cardboard.  also eating all meats and cheeses is soooo bad for you.  hello triple bypass!  for people that have high cholesterol like myself, the adkins diet is a death sentance.  what is even more scary is that it can cause one to have high cholesterol...eekkk.  i have to admit, a few years back, before i knew that my cholesterol was 300, i tried adkins.  i felt like i was going to die.  i had no energy, so i stopped doing it.  the theories behind it are neat, making the body's krebs cycle work for weight loss.  using the body's fat instead of the carb sugars for energy.  but all of this is garbage because it's not a healthy lifestyle.  also, who the hell can stay on this type of regime for life?  because for true weight loss and maintence to occur, one must change the way that they eat for life!  the whole weight problem in america is because the size of the portions that we all eat are way too big.  i'm cutting down on how much i eat and it's been working wonders...and i get to eat carbs!  my cholesterol is also down from 300 to 223!  the article is pretty interesting overall though, talking about how carrots have only been orange for like 400 years, and how if they brought back the other carrot colors like red & purple it would add certain nutrients to our diets.  you have to be careful w/ the purple carrots though...the purple is water soluable...

      Dear Visitor, Here is your horoscope for Friday, June 25:  If you're flying solo-style, it's probably because deep down you want to be alone. The right person will find their way into your life when you're ready. If you're coupled up, give your copilot the day off.

      so yeah on july 3rd i am going skydiving w/ 19 other people.  i am very excited!  i only know a few of the people that are going, they went to medaille w/ me, the other people are some of their friends and family, so who knows, maybe i'll meet someone.    right...what the hell am i thinking? haha.  so at least the actual skydiving will be fun.  we have to get there at 8 am to take a 2 hour class on how to suit up, use the parachute and go over legal stuff and paperwork.  then we chill for a bit, have lunch and then we do the jump.  my friend megan who has gone skydiving quite a few times said that it is illegal to skydive if you can't see the ground, so if it is cloudy, we can't jump until it clears.  if it is good weather though we get to jump from like 15,000 to 20,000 feet!  how kewl.  i'm so excited!  i have to work 7am-6:30pm tomorrow.  not fun.  i'm in dog surgery all morning, i get an hour for lunch (thank god) and then i am in dog appointments.  what i should mention is that the a/c blower is broken on the dog side of the hospital. (we have seperate buildings for dogs and cats where i work and they are connected in the middle)  it is working everywhere else but there.  it has been broken for like 3 days and will not be fixed until tuesday or something b/c the part they need is on frickin' back-order.  it is stuffy and hot and very smelly on the dog side!  i have just been drinking lots of water b/c i have been sweating so much.    anyway... i am happy b/c on friday i work 7am-4pm, but i am in cat surgery all morning until lunch and then i have to go to dog appointments...blah.  i do like working w/ dogs way better than working w/ cats, i think it's because i was raised w/ a dog and my mom hates cats so we never had one.  my brother is also allergic, but that's beside the point. i like cats, but not so much when they come to the clinic.  they get nasty and they have lots of weapons and they always seem to nail me.  my arms are all scratched and have scars on them from all of my cat scuffles.  i look like a battered woman or a cutter!  oh well. so i'll never be a hand or arm model...haha.  it's getting late and i need sleep.  Travis is looking at me and in his eyes i can hear his brain saying; "turn off the light bitch, i'm tired and i wanna sleep, NOW!"  Travis is my scottie dog, i love him, he is the best guy ever. anyway i think the heat got to my brain today at work and i need some sleep...night...

      what is the deal w/ people being be-headed in iraq lately?  the portions of the tapes that they show on tv are so creepy.  they remind me of the movie "the ring."  this whole thing sucks.  just look at how many of our people have been killed:  urlLink http://www.cnn.com/SPECIALS/2003/iraq/forces/casualties/ .I cried a little tonight looking at that webpage.  i have 2 friends that are in iraq, michelle & amanda.  they seem to be doing ok, but anything can happen...

      yeah, i know you probably think that i spelled "fuzzy" wrong in the title of this post, but i didn't.  i wanted it to read "fuzzily."  kind of like how i call my dog "fuzzily wuzzily" all of the time.  but anyway what i meant to get at with the post about the cat with the kittens was that it's amazing that on a daily basis i help animals live.  it was kewl just to be there, let alone be a part of it.   c-sections are my favorite surgeries to assist in b/c of the way that we as technicians can be in charge of reviving an animal.  i love it.  but i still want to be a vet so i can do even more :)

      so i was thinking today about the last night that i worked at the emergency clinic.  what i am going to type about happened like 3 weeks or so ago and i don't know why i'm thinking about it now, but i am, so i'll share...  This lady calls and says that this cat that she found as a pregnant stray had 4 kittens earlier that morning and now she has something hanging out of her.  I told her that she should bring the cat in b/c it could be a prolapsed uterus.  so this woman brings in the cat and her 4 kittens and the cat does in fact have a prolapsed uterus...the whole left uterine horn is hanging out of her body :(    she was pretty stable so about an hour later the doctor went in to remove the uterus, etc, basically to do an OVH...in other words a spay.  as we were prepping her for surgery, clipping her and expressing her bladder, etc, a technician felt something in her abdomen.  it felt like another kitten!  so the dvm went in and sure enough there was a very limp kitten still in its fluid sac.  the dvm didn't want to contaminate the abdomen, so she tied off the kitten in its sac and continued on with the OVH.  she then cut the kitten free.  Kim the technician opened the sac and at first we thought the kitten was dead.  we were watching the dvm close up the mom cat and the kitten gasped for air in kim's hands!  it was amazing!  the kitten ended up surviving and went home with the owner.  oh yeah and another thing, this cat and her 5 kittens really found a great home.  the woman who brought them in was all like "money is no object"...and she was happy that she found the cat and that it had kittens.  it was wonderful.  i guess there still are good people in this world...

      my employer is so nice.  they gave all 3 of us who were taking the board exam thursday, friday and saturday off, without pay of course.  on thursday i drove with some friends up to syracuse. wait let me re-phrase that, i drove myself in my car while the other girls drove on the same highway (the 90 & 690)in 2 other cars.  i have driven there before when i visited syracuse university, so it wasn't that bad. we got to the hotel around 3pm and then took a test run to see where the exam was going to be held.  then everyone but me went to the mall, i stayed in the room and slept b/c i was feeling shitty.  when all of the girls got back we ordered pizza, breadsticks and cinnasticks from dominoes!  then we all fell asleep by 10:30pm b/c there was nothing else to do.  plus we had to wake up at 6am the next day.    on friday we all took the national board exam for veterinary technology at the fair grounds.  i think i did ok, which kind of scares me.  seeing everyone from school was fun.  i haven't seen them in a few weeks and i was missing them.  now that the exam is over i miss them now.  oh well what can you do?  i hope that we can all keep in touch, but i already know the drill with that from my canisius days...  Good things that happened lately: -I walk my dog 2 times a day on days i don't work, since i have no life -State boards are over -I quit working at the emergency clinic (although I do miss Katie,     Lynnie, Joe, Kathy G & K, and the DVMs!) -I lost 3 pounds. -This post is finally done.

      so yeah earlier this summer i was enrolled in organic chemistry @ NU.  needless to say, it was one of the worst experiences of my life.  so, i withdrew from the school all together.  kind of a long story, but i am planning on going to nccc in the fall instead so i am still planning on going to veterinary school, if anyone cares.   well as if working full time and trying to study for this class were not bad enough, my troubles did not end when i withdrew from the college.   there was this guy in the class that always talked to me and made it a point to sit next to me.  i just schuged it off and was pleasant towards him being careful not to lead him on, etc.  also, before i knew he was kind of weird we exchanged e-mail addresses within a small group of people in the class in case we had questions, etc...  well now he IM's me almost every night and says that we have to get together and that i should visit the class in my spare time.  haha.  i barely have enough time to scratch my ass and i am going to visit an organic chemistry class for fun?...well to be honest, maybe i would if i liked him in that sort of way, but i don't so i won't be a visitor at that class.  so now he has this crazy idea that he is going to take me out next week to celebrate that my board exam is over with.  eeekkk.  i'm trying to be nice but i don't want to go out w/ him, and i won't.   **ahhh as i'm writing this post he writes this in an IM to me:   Picolo875:  I know this sounds stupid and i'm not trying to be persistent, but am I a type of guy you would consider going out with ?  **i just want to say hell no...but i'm trying to be nice...so i say:  Jupiter926:  well i am not really looking for anyone right now...i kinda like being single...i like you as a friend though.  **oh man, now he's trying to lay the guilt on:  Picolo875: yeah, lol i get that A LOT, lol. sorry if I scared you.  Its just when i first met you I thought you were very nice and really pretty.  i had wanted to ask you out because i thought you were very pretty.  anyway...enough of that.  i have had my share of guys who didn't like me in the same way that i liked them and i had to deal.  everyone does.  so i shouldn't feel bad for being honest...it's the way to go.

      so yeah my life is pretty boring.  i work full time as a veterinary technician and then i come home to eat and sleep.  wow. i can't hold back the excitement.  at least now i get to go out once and a while.  usually i'm the one standing around while my friends are making connections w/ people they are attracted to.  i just don't have the motovation to even talk to guys, i figure they are all a waste of time anyway, and life is short.  if i am going to talk to someone or take an interest in them it  better be worth it.  i'm not going to be in one of those situations again where i date someone for a long time and then it just ends.  no way, i'd rather be single forever.  that is the way that things are looking right about now.  so i know lots of people who are gay or lesbian.  i think it's a trend today.  more people are experimenting and deciding that they like what they are experiencing.  some people say that they are born gay/ lesbian and never chose to have the sexual preferences that they do.  who knows...maybe it is a factor of genetics.  i know people on both sides of the issue.  people are dumb.  that is re-affirimed on a daily basis for me at work especially.  it was really apparent when i was working at the veterinary emergency clinic but i still see it in private practice.  i don't just mean that the pet owners are stupid, some of the employees are too.  i know i act stupid sometimes, everyone does, and everyone makes mistakes, but i try not to do it on a regular basis.  eeekkk.  so i am reviewing for my veterinary technology state boards that are being held on fri (6/18) in syracuse, and i am getting all of the questions wrong.  if i don't pass ( passing is a 75%) i don't have a job anymore, and that also means that i don't have health insurance, but i usually work well under pressure so maybe i'll pass...

      so there has been a wheaten scottie named jimmy&nbsp;at the clinic for the past few days...he had a barium series done to see if he had an intestinal blockage on monday and part of tuesday, and it turned out that he had something stuck in his intestines, so he needed to have surgery.&nbsp; i was the technician who was resiponsible for him in surgery so i got to prep him and everything.&nbsp; the doctor found and removed a rubbery thing from his small intestine.&nbsp; it was weird, we were thinking it was part of a toy or something.  well today he was looking great...he was frisky and even gave me a kiss on the face!&nbsp; he was also eating a bit on his own so that is great.&nbsp; his owner came in with his doggie dad bobby&nbsp;who is a wheaten scottie and his doggie sister lizzy&nbsp;who is a black scottie.&nbsp; they needed physicals and vaccines.&nbsp; they were really cute too!&nbsp; bobby needed blood drawn and he was ok...just kind of whiney.&nbsp; lizzy was a bit wild and tried to bite the doctor but i had her in a headlock so it was all good and no one got hurt!&nbsp;   below are some links&nbsp;to&nbsp;pictures of bobby and lizzy...jimmy looks just like bobby!&nbsp; they are really cute!  urlLink http://www.beac.petplace.com/pet-gallery.asp?pg=3219   urlLink http://www.beac.petplace.com/pet-gallery.asp?pg=3220

Enjoy it -- and don't you dare stay home tonight!   &nbsp; haha...well what did i do tonight?&nbsp; i came home after work and let the neighbor's dog out and fed her and then i walked travis and by that time it was pitch black outside.&nbsp; then i watched what not to wear and while you were out on tlc.&nbsp; so i didn't go out tonight.&nbsp; haven't been out in a while.&nbsp; go figure.

       so i called the clinic today and mooch is ok.&nbsp; i hope that they figure out what is wrong w/ her...she is such&nbsp;a cute and friendly kitten!&nbsp; she is a&nbsp; medium (length) hair cream color w/ a puffy tail, and a half grey, half cream/tan muzzle area...and she has blue eyes...ultimate cuteness!&nbsp; anyway i am so glad that she made it through the night.&nbsp; the doctors seem to think that she has FIP (feline infectious peritonitis) or toxoplasmosis (cat scratch fever...the one pregnant women can get if they come into contact w/ cat feces), so the future may not be so bright for poor mooch...  i work tomorrow 12-8:30pm though so i guess maybe i'll see what is going on w/ her and see if they know anything more...  so today i had 2 cavities in one of my molars filled...i go back on aug 3 to get the other 2 cavities filled in another molar.&nbsp; my dentist couldnt do them all today b/c i have TMJ and cannot have my mouth opened for long periods of time for dental work.&nbsp; so yeah...the novocaine didn't kick in right away so they gave me more...so after a while my whole right side of my face was numb, including my nose and right eye! lol...it wore off hours later.  then i went to the optometrist for my eye appointment.&nbsp; turns out that i need glasses for seeing up close now too...eerr.&nbsp; i picked out these really kewl DKNY square frames which should be in early next week so we will see how it goes...that's really all for now...  &nbsp;

      yeah so tonight i was the only technician left at the clinic along with danielle, an assistant who is also a vet student, kim who is a receptionist and marylisa, a veterinarian.    danielle and i had just finished mopping and kim came in the back and told me that this kitten who is staying at the clinic had some blood in his IV line.  i thought nothing of it as this happens sometimes and is normal, but i figured i'd check it out before leaving anyway.  danielle was holding the kitten and i was flushing the line w/ heparin (to break up the clots in the line) and fluids.    the line was still ok so i was all ready to tape the line to the kitten's leg when she went all stiff and a second later started having a seizure.  i got the oxygen hooked up and ran to get marylisa to see how much valium (an anti seizure med) i should give the kitten while danielle did some chest compressions.  by the time marylisa came over the kitten was on oxygen and was somewhat stable.  marylisa told me how much valium to give and i gave it and then everything was ok.  the people had no money to transfer the kitten to the emergency clinic so it has to stay at our clinic overnight.  good thing there is a technician who lives upstairs who will be monitoring her overnight.    i'm going to call tomorrow and see how the kitten is since i am off.  oh yeah the kitten's name is mooch be the way. i'll keep ya posted...

      my degus, rocco & vinnie finally have a new house...they were living in a 15 gallon regular height aquarium...and now thanks to my friend and co-worker gretchen, the boys now call a 30 gallon high aquarium home!  the extra height will prevent escapes...b/c if they escape they will literally chew the whole house down!    anyway...gretchen used to have lizards and they lived in this tank.  she doesn't have the lizards anymore and doesn't need the tank so she gave it to me.  it even came with a wire screen cover.  it's nice.  so tonight i scrubbed it all up and put all of their stuff in it.  the boys love it...they have so much room to move and jump, etc, it's great.  on another note, i rented the movie "the butterfly effect" tonight on dvd.  it was a kewl movie but it was disturbing at times.  i won't give away any details though to those who want to see it.  the dvd has 2 versions of the movie on it: the directors cut and the theatrical cut.  the only thing that is different between the 2 are the ending scenes.  overall a kewl concept.  to close...today at work we had to put: 2 basset hounds from the same family to sleep (long story), a 15 year old boston terrier to sleep who was dyspnic and a 15 year old scottish terrier (*sob*) to sleep who had chf(congenital heart failure) with a palpable thrill (a heart murmur so bad that it can be felt from the outside of the body).    i just couldn't help with the scottie...her name was judy.  it was upsetting.  very.  i shed a few tears.   (**for those of you who don't know i own a 13 year old scottish terrier named travis**)   euthanasia best thing for this dog though, but even though i knew that i just kept thinking of my own dog...   i'm glad that i wasn't able to do it though...it shows that i haven't become cold and detached about and from the whole process... ____________________________________________________  on a side note...another person my age got married today, a (used to be)friend from high school.  i wasn't invited.  this is prob b/c of an e mail mishap which involved the sending of an e mail not intended for this now married friend straight to her e mail box!  oops!  my bad.  i hate when people don't have aol...then you can't unsend stuff to them...eerr.    my single time clock, on the other hand, is still ticking full force ahead and has been for 3 years now...

      Dear Visitor, Here is your horoscope for Friday, July 16:  Someone is about to let you know in no uncertain terms that they're tickled to know you. Oh, stop blushing. Even Librans get to look smug every now and then.  ___________________________________________________________  so yeah this horoscope came true today.  while i was at work today one of my co-workers and friend, sarah told me that 2 of my favorite doctors at the clinic were raving about me and how i am a great tech, especially in surgery.  yeah!  also while i was driving home from work tonight, i noticed that someone had written "catherine rocks" on my back window with their finger.  haha.  anyway...my horoscope was very accurate for today...go figure...

      i worked on saturday 7:30am-4:30pm on the cat side of the clinic.  just about every cat that we dealt with was a nasty bitch which made the day just that much more fun.  yeah.  one of the cats that we saw came in being held by it's owner.  this 23 pound devil cat was being contained in a pillowcase which was closed at one end w/ a rubber band.    i suited up and put on my handy dandy suede full arm welder's gloves and went into the exam room with the doctor.  the cat started thrashing wildly everytime i attempted to stabilize his head.  i was unsucessful, so the owner had to carry the cat in the back treatment area so that we could shave his ass which was matted and crusted with shit.    while we were back there, the owner proceeded to show us her arm which the cat had attacked a few days earlier...it was a mess.  the owner also had large scratches across her neck from where this cat had clawed her while she tried to get it into a cardboard carrier, which it then proceeded to tear apart.  this is why the cat was in a pillowcase.    it took 2 technicians, and 1 assistant to restrain this beast while the doctor shaved its ass.  the cat ended up biting the assistant through the pillowcase, a towel and welders gloves and peeing in the eye and mouth of the other technician.  i (the second technician) and the doctor emerged from this experience unscathed!  after this appointent there were scores of nasty cats and maybe 1 or 2 nice ones.    then, while we were supposed to be on lunch hour, a cat was brought in that had been in the dryer for 5 min.  the cat was panting a bit, and had bleeding front paws (it had been de-clawed 2 days before and the glue on his feet had come undone in the dryer). i got out the oxygen and attempted to mask the cat with it.  he took it for a bit then started being retarded.  i then had to place an IV catheter and start the cat on fluids, which was done without a hitch.  yeah!  he then got solu delta cortef for shock, alcohol on his back paws (to lower his body temp) and pressure bandages on his front paws.  we put ice packs in his kennel with some blankets to cool him down and then he was fine.  he went home several hours later and is scheduled to come back on monday for paw stitching.    in all respect, this cat's dryer experience was nothing compaired to a cat that came into the emergency clinic once...it was in the dryer for 25 min, had "cooked" skin which made catheter placement very difficult, was panting and open mouth breathing as bad as i have ever seen!  this cat also survived and went home.  it was amazing.  so yeah that's all i have to say for now...peace out...

      "what doesn't bend breaks."- ani d  i have been listening to a lot of ani d lately.  i am sad that i was unable to attend her free concert at niagara square on july 4th...blah.  i think it's really kewl that a super talented woman musician came out of buffalo.  amazing...but then again everyone comes from somewhere...  tonight at work a doctor and i almost got bitten.  i was restraining the dog on an exam table while the doctor was examining at her ears and neck.  then the dog let out this ear piercing, blood curdling scream/ bark.  i was scared shitless.  the doctor jumped back and then i did the same.  i kind of blacked out for a few seconds...b/c i have no clue how the dog didn't fall off/ jump off the table when we both jumped back.  it was weird.  so then the doctor grabbed a muzzle for the dog and all was well. the muzzle really stole her thunder!  we determined that it was a dominance issue w/ the dog...b/c holding a dog about the neck and having a doctor touch the neck while restrained is a signal to a dog that says that we are dominant over them.  the fact that we were doing this was an insult to the dog and she reacted by being extra scary to show that she was in control.  we had to counteract this with the muzzle and continued physical exam and vaccinations so that she wouldn't win this mental battle!  well yeah...nothing else exciting happened at work except for that.  well, i did bring my dog in for a urinalysis and in house bloodwork, but everything was normal, so that wasn't exciting, thank god.  in the past few weeks we have had 3 possible cases of leptospirosis in the clinic.  this is bad b/c this is a zoonootic disease, in other words, it can be spread from animals to humans.  animals get it by coming into contact with rodents and their urine.  the dogs all came back lepto positive when we sent out their blood to a lab  one of them, an older beagle, was euthanized (put to sleep) a few weekends ago. another one, a yorkie puppy, responded to treatment and went home last week.  the most recent one, a middle aged husky is in the clinic now.  he doesn't seem to be responding well to treatment, but that could change.  when dealing w/ these dogs we all have to wear gloves and make sure that everything used for these dogs is kept in isolation w/ them, such as garbage cans, sharps containers, vet wrap, tape, gauze, food, dishes, muzzles, leashes, thermometers, etc... their laundry also has to either be thrown out, or washed seperate with bleach.  yeah.  all of these precautions take so much time, especially when the dog wants to bite your face off, like the most recent case, the husky.  but anyway...  oh yeah, and another thing...i have added  3 more deep scratches to my left arm.  well, i didn't add them, a spazzy lab mix did with his nails.  i was trimming his nails and he was being restrained by 2 people and he still nailed me (haha no pun intended), and also one of the restrainers.  just walking in the door at work is a hazard, let alone doing your job...  i hope no one was too bored with this post, but i found it interesting...haha...ciao ;)

      "i'm going to do my best swan dive into shark infested waters."- ani d  that quote sums up kind of how i feel everyday at work.  it's kind of dramatic but pretty much true.  at least i like what i'm doing.  that's a plus.  tonight at work was nuts...we were all working our asses off and for about 1 hour the dog side was backed up 8 appointments deep!  eekk.  no one got really bitchy or anything so that was good at least.  after work i went to my co-worker and friend ellen's house for some beers and popcorn with 2 other girls that we work with.  we all sat around and vented about work and things which felt good.  and now i'm tired...i'm going to bed...

      today was fun.  i went to the buffalo kennel club dog show at the agri center at the hamburg fair grounds.  i saw all kinds of dogs...airdales, wire hair and soft coated fox terriers, SCOTTIES, westies, pugs, poodles, borzois, german short hair and wire hair pointers, spononi italianis, great danes, mastiffs, malteses, springer and cocker spaniels, english water spaniels, old english sheepdogs, dobermans, rotties, collies, labs, akitas, irish setters, irish wolfhounds, bulldogs, shelties, papilons, skye terriers, sealam terriers, kerry blue terriers, german shephards, huskies, corgis, pekineses, bernese mountain dogs, dalmations, boxers, boston terriers, golden retrievers, yorkies, and many many more.  it was really fun.  then we went to my cousin's house for a cookout.  the weather held out so that the kids could go swimming and stuff which was good.  then it poured, and poured and poured...so we sat under the porch roof in the back.  it was nice.  then i showed everyone my skydiving dvd b/c everyone wanted to see it.  then we all went to niagara falls to watch the fireworks that seneca niagara casino let off.  it was great.  the rain held off until the very end of the show, which was amazing.   i found out that yet another one of my friends is engaged now.  damn...i feel so behind...i thought i'd be at least engaged if not married by 25.  i'm turning 24 on september 26 and with no prospects at all it's not looking too good for that engaged or married by 25 thing :(     tomorrow it's back to work at 7am so i am heading to bed now...

      skydiving was AWESOME!!!  there is really nothing more to say.    photos to come...they took still shots of me and my instructor, peter while we were jumping and after we landed and i have to get the roll of film developed.  i also got a dvd made of my jump and it's kewl.  everything came to $280 which was a bit pricey but not that bad.  with every jump that you do the price goes down some.  i don't know when, but i will definately go again.  i had a great time!

      So yeah...i really love this poem by maya angelou...it's just beautiful...so here goes...   Phenomenal Woman   Pretty women wonder where my secret lies. I'm not cute or built to suit a fashion model's size But when I start to tell them, They think I'm telling lies. I say, It's in the reach of my arms, The span of my hips, The stride of my step, The curl of my lips. I'm a woman Phenomenally. Phenomenal woman, That's me.  I walk into a room Just as cool as you please, And to a man, The fellows stand or Fall down on their knees. Then they swarm around me, A hive of honey bees. I say, It's the fire in my eyes, And the flash of my teeth, The swing in my waist, And the joy in my feet. I'm a woman Phenomenally. Phenomenal woman, That's me.  Men themselves have wondered What they see in me. They try so much But they can't touch My inner mystery. When I try to show them They say they still can't see. I say, It's in the arch of my back, The sun of my smile, The ride of my breasts, The grace of my style. I'm a woman Phenomenally. Phenomenal woman, That's me.  Now you understand Just why my head's not bowed. I don't shout or jump about Or have to talk real loud. When you see me passing It ought to make you proud. I say, It's in the click of my heels, The bend of my hair, the palm of my hand, The need for my care. 'Cause I'm a woman Phenomenally. Phenomenal woman, That's me. ______________________________________________________  now isn't that poem great?  i really like it.  i found it in a folder in my closet when i was cleaning it out this afternoon!  it was a great surprise...makes it worth while to clean my room...

      so i went to the erie county fair today with sarah. it was my first time ever going to the fair. it was fun. we hung out with the goats, cows, swine, llamas, sheep, bunnies, chickens, guinea pigs, geese and saw some big cats. we saw horses too but there weren't that many of them there yet. :(  i liked the animals the best out of anything at the fair. since i am on weight watchers i couldn't really have any of the normal fair foods, although i did split some millenium fries with sarah. millenium fries are basically potato chips that are made fresh in front of you. they spiral slice a potato and deep fry it. yeah, i know it's not the most healthy thing but they were good and i tried not to have too many. the way i see it, before weight watchers i would have sampled the stuff at lots of the food booths so i did good today. instead of stuffing my face, i focused on the other things there were to see and do such as the animals, the displays and bazaar booths. it was kewl.  after the fair, sarah dropped me off at the emergency clinic where i had left my car. i stopped in to visit since katie, lynnie and tonia (dr. hite) were working. i ended up staying until 12:30am when katie had to leave and mel came in as her relief. it was fun visiting. when katie and i were walking out we were scared by a rat hanging out by the dumpster!  haha i screamed.  how ghetto.  i miss working there. i miss a lot of things that i used to do. damn work. i am stuck where i am too because i need health insurance. blah. well i'll stop complaining now...i just need something really good to happen really soon. i should be getting my vet tech licencing exam score soon, but i don't know if that will be a good thing! haha. that's all for now...

      so i watched the movie "13 going on 30" tonight with my mom...it was good...it made me think about old friends and things...i really liked it.  i have been listening to john mayer's "room for squares" cd lately in my car and i really like it.  one of my brother's friends had burned it for me a while back and i had never listened to it before this week.   this is my favorite and most appropriate quote for my life right now from that cd...  to my soulmate where ever and whomever he may be:  "i'm tired of being alone, so hurry up and get here...could have met you in a sandbox, could have passed you on the sidewalk...i'm so tired of being alone"
