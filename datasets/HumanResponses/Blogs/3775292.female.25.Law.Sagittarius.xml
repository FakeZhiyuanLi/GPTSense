      This site is dedicated to&nbsp;garnering proper&nbsp;respect to&nbsp;one of the most over-looked, under appreciated foods in America Today:&nbsp; The Peanut Butter and Jelly Sandwich.&nbsp; It is my goal, and the expressed purpose of this blog to have the Peatnut Butter and Jelly Sandwich replace Apple Pie as the quintessential American food.&nbsp; If I have my way the next generation of American children&nbsp; will grow up describing things: "As American as PB&J."   There are numerous reasons why PB&amp;J should replace apple pie as the all American food.&nbsp;First of all, peanut butter is a 100% American food!&nbsp; Peanut butter was invented by Americans,&nbsp;made from nuts native to this nation, and is consumed primarily by Americans.&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm certain the majority of you have a jar of Peanut Butter in your pantry right now....how many of you have an apple pie on the counter right now?     Please keep coming back as I continue to develop my site and my argument.&nbsp; Until then, I ask all visitors to my site to spread the notion of PB&J USA across this great land, like so much&nbsp;creamy peanut butter over bread. &nbsp;     &nbsp;    PBJ!!! USA!!! PBJ!!! USA!!! PBJ!!! USA!!! PBJ!! USA!!! PBJ!!! USA!!!

						   I just finished filling out my entry form for the Fall Festival.&nbsp; I must admit, I'm slightly terrified!&nbsp; I haven't shown a horse in over 4 years!!&nbsp; I know I just need to get back into the ring, and that once we get going everything will be fine.&nbsp; However, until then I will live in fear.&nbsp; It is difficult for me to comprehend, that after all the showing I have done in the past, I can be this worried now.&nbsp;Perhaps it is because I have no trainer.&nbsp; Perhaps it is because I haven't bothered to ride a test yet. Perhaps it is because I feel too fat to be in the ring being judged.&nbsp;   Regardless, I am going!&nbsp; I will show first level and hopefully win at least one class.&nbsp; I hope I can remember how to braid...I hope I can remember all the stupid little shit needed to show a horse...I hope Dobby's shoes stay on for the entire weekend...Okay, I'm going to go breath into a paper bag now...

						   Hi, Margo..Since i am blogtarded still I am responding directly. I have the World Cup on my calendar and plan to go. It was a blast when we went to the Show Jumping championships in 2003. A bunch of the H/J folks will undoubtedly go, too. I felt like I was a groupie at a rock concert some of the time. I was sitting near Will Simpson once....of Hidden Creek farms (I think). Then Ludger Beerbaum, Norman della Joio, and a bunch of other guys were signing autographs in the vendor area (which was of course quite nice...Hermes saddles anyone?) And of course there was Rodrigo Pessoa who practically got a standing ovation every time he came in the ring. It was fun to see all the great riders and horses and to be at an equestrian event where there was actually a big well informed audience that cheered and had a great time, especially on Sunday for the actual World Cup final. Omaha's own Karen Cudmore (who rides for Canada) placed 20th out of 40 some. Not bad for the best riders in the world. Debbie MacDonald did her freestyle on Sunday between the two rounds of the finals. Very cool. They had other Vegas type entertainment, too. Like the guy who jumped over a convertible standing with one foot each on the backs of two paints....I kid you not. They also had some of the German riders do a barrel racing competition on some little barrel racers...That was a hoot. I am rambling but can you tell, I had a great time. Even Hubby had fun. He kept score (how boylike) and really got into it. So I for sure am going again and Steve will probably want to, too. I know Cindy Berlin and some of her friends are hoping to go.

						   I was reading the USDF Connection last night, and saw that both World Cup Dressage and World Cup Jumping will be held in Las Vegas next April 20-24!!!&nbsp; 2 classy sports held in the trashiest town in America!!&nbsp; Sounds like its time for a vacation ladies.&nbsp; Tix for the events are pretty expensive, but there is a group rate for groups of 10 or more...check out the website for more info.&nbsp;  urlLink www.worldcupvegas.com &nbsp;  I've never seen "world class" competition first hand, so I would love to go.&nbsp; I think if we got a group together we could have a really great time tearin' up Vegas and watching dressage on an international stage.

						   Yesterday my mom stopped at the tack store and bought Dobby some new bell boots.&nbsp; Hoooray for mom!!!!&nbsp; Except that she was forced to by 2 green boots and 2 blue boots, as they were the only 2 pair of XL bell boots left in the store.&nbsp;   For most normal horse owners this would not be a problem "oh fun, 2 different colors."&nbsp; Not for Margo.&nbsp; I've been religious about sticking to Dobby's color scheme: Black, white, silver and grey.&nbsp;&nbsp;These green and blue bell boots are just a nightmare...much like our fly sheet which is white with navy trim...at least the boots will match the sheet.&nbsp; At least Dobby has bell boots he can wear all the time so he doesn't ruin his feet.&nbsp; (pardon me while I try to accept color).   It's just that I have this little dream about&nbsp; me and Dobby...everything matching (yes, this could also be called OCD) in varying shades of black, white and grey.&nbsp; None of his blankets match and now these misfit bell boots!!!&nbsp; Perhaps the dream of a full scale color scheme will have to be reserved for shows only.&nbsp; *sigh*&nbsp; Or perhaps I should seek some kind of medical treatment for my color focused OCD!   &nbsp;

						   Since I caught so much hell about this article.....here is the revision.... I love you guys, I really do!! :)     How to Care for Your Dressage Arena      by Jamee L. Amundson    Drag the arena daily or every other day, paying close attention to the high traffic areas on the rail.&nbsp; If the rail has a four foot trench, then please take a rake and pull dirt from the corners and wall to fill in the trench before dragging with a tractor.   When it comes to watering, please try to use a water, drag, water, drag practice so that the footing does not clump.&nbsp; By doing this, all portions of the footing are wet and watering will need to be done less often.&nbsp; Please do not flood the arena and then not drag it, as this creates mud and slick spots and not to mention hard crusty balls of sand.   Ok, I am finished.&nbsp; Sorry to bitch for a minute there ladies.&nbsp; I am just irritated that we pay for that&nbsp;indoor&nbsp;and it's crappy at times.&nbsp; Not to mention we can't ride in the outdoor arena because there is five feet of grass growing in it.&nbsp;I really&nbsp;hate to be one of&nbsp;"those&nbsp;boarders", but sometimes I am curious as to what my board is going towards........but I am finished now, I promise!

						   Thought you guys might be interested, considering the projected weather today and tomorrow:  &nbsp;  From University of Illinois Vet School:&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Signs of heatstroke are unexpected fatigue, possibly stumbling, and an increased respiratory rate. Horses normally lose heat by sweating. When they are overheated, they pant in order to lose more heat. If the respiratory rate becomes higher than the heart rate, especially after resting for a few minutes, then the horse is overheated and needs help.&nbsp; When this occurs, cool the horse off immediately. Get it in shade. Offer some drinking water. Run as much cold water over the horse as you possibly can. Use a fan, if one is available, to help cool it off.  &nbsp;  There are a few myths concerning horses and heatstroke that need to be put to rest."Traditionally, we were taught not put a lot cold water on horses' backs and hindquarters,"says Dr. Foreman. However, exercising muscle can reach 110 degrees (F), at which point protein fibers start to denature or fall apart, and must be cooled off. "We've done it to over 500 horses in field settings and competitions leading up to and including the Olympics. We were slinging ice-cold water everywhere and had no horses tie up." One thing you should not do is leave wet towels draped over the horse's neck and head.&nbsp; Unless you keep pouring cold water over it, the towel will warm up and become an insulating blanket and retain heat.  &nbsp;  Another myth forbids a hot horse to drink water. "If they have normal to increased gastrointestinal sounds then let them drink, but not so much that their stomach can be distended, not bucketfuls," says Dr. Foreman. "In fact, the thirst drive to drink decreases with time after exercise." If you let them drink right away, they usually will. If you wait, even 5 to 10 minutes, they may not drink at all for a while even though they are dehydrated.  &nbsp;  Another myth is that trotting or cantering will cool horses off. The rider feels refreshed by moving through the air. However, horses produce more heat to create the breeze than they lose to it. The temperature of a trotting horse goes up, not down. You can prevent heatstroke by providing protection from the sun and by always having a salt block available. "People underestimate how much radiant heat is gained by standing in the sunshine. They think of it for themselves and wear a hat but they don't think of it for the horse," says Dr. Foreman. "Also, a salt block will provide electrolytes lost in sweat." A horse will sweat just standing in the pasture and will lose a lot of sodium and chloride and fair amount of potassium.  &nbsp;

						   Yesterday, after a scortching hot ride and a nice relaxing cool shower, I gave Dobby an extra special treat.&nbsp; He loved it so much, I thought I would share this no brainer special treat recipe with all&nbsp; y'all. &nbsp; I don't know the exact measurements, so you'll have to eyeball it. &nbsp; 1/3 cup or so Instant Oatmeal 1 1/2 Cups Wheat germ 1/2 Cup Dark Molasses 1 Tbsp warm water &nbsp; Dobby really enjoyed this mixture, he started eating it out of the bowl I'd mixed it in before I even got a chance to dump it in his feed.&nbsp;

						   I get an online Horse Newsletter called "The Horse" and it mainly deals with horse health issues, contagious diseases and new veterinary techniques, but it also has lots of current news.  One interesting thing came up today:  Two American Saddlebreds had to be euthanized last year because of a "brutal attack".  (The article was in there this week because they are trying to get one of the bodies exhumed for further testing and autopsy) Someone came in the barn and injected the left front pastern of five World Champion saddlebreds with a caustic, necrosing substance.  All five horses had large circular wounds on their front pasterns where the tissue had simply died from the injection, it then began to eat away at the internal tissues and two had to be euthanized because their other foot got so bad that they couldn't stand.  The other three horses had lengthy recoveries and are now back in training.  USEF offered a $10,0000 reward to find the jerks who did this. The barn manager said she walked into the barn on Monday morning and the left front legs of theses horses were severely swollen up to their shoulders.  Could you imagine??  Hopefully Voldemort (Darth Vader) won't see this and find a way to off all of our horses.....this is something he doesn't need to know about !!

						   Make way!  Clear a path, make room for the expanded egos of our former barn mates, and followers of Jenny.  If Jenny is the mesiah of Dressage, then Cindy Ishoy is surely the goddess most divine.  Recently Cindy Ishoy was named a member of this year's  urlLink Canadian Dressage Team.   Congratulations to her (even though she is a pompus blow hard).  I can't wait to run into one of the cult members, and hear all about their "Olyimpic" quality training methods.  Sheesh.

						   Those poor things.  This weather is miserable.  I spent 20 min. running cold water over Snr. Kranky Pants yesterday just so that his body temperature would drop.  I got up at 5 to ride this morning and it was already 80 degrees and felt like 90, so I thought "what's the point?" and just went back to bed.  Hopefully they will be outside today, I don't know how much rain we got last night.  To whomever is in charge of these things:  90 degrees is ok, but it doesn't have to be so freakin' humid!!

						   Ladies, I am a little concerned about my dedication to dressage....because it was supposed to be ungodly hot today, I was planning on getting up at 5 and riding before going into the office.  But when the alarm went off at 5, I just turned if off and went back to sleep.  What is the matter with me?  Now I have lost a day of riding.  I promise to go out and give him a shower this afternoon....but does that mean I have no dedication to my beloved and my sport?  Is there therapy out there for people like me?  Or is it just because it is Monday and the weather was miserable at 5 this morning?  Do I need help?? :)

						   There are 2 things in this world that really piss me off.  1) Stupid people 2) People who don't take care of their animals. I would like to say here and now that if you don't want to put the work into your animal, or if you aren't going to treat that animal with the respect every living thing deserves, you should not have that animal at all.  Poor poor Hercules (our visiting German Shepard) has to cross a dangerous road to seek out some love and entertainment.  I adore Herc, but find it quite sad that his owners obviously don't care enough about their beautiful dog to make sure he isn't crossing the highway.  I don't know about any one else, but if my dog were missing for several hours I would notice, and probably go into a panic.    I am sick and tired of awful people not treating animals well.  Having a pet or a horse is an honor. It is an understanding between species.  People who don't understand this concept should not be honored with the kind of loyalty and love an animal can give.

						   Ladies, the dressage portion of the NE State Games will take place this Sunday at the fair grounds.  Intro through 2nd level will be shown (supposedly) as well as musical freestyle.  I'm planning to check it out hopefully some of you will join me.  Perhaps the Games will inspire others among us to pack up their trunks and head off to the show grounds this August!

						   I think people should be measured in hands, just like horses.  As I watched Angie disappear behind Miss Margo's gynormous equine yesterday, I thought, you know, it would be so much easier for me if people were measured in hands.  My brain seems to be much more inclined to wrap itself around estimating the size of horses in hands than it does estimating the height of people in feet.  For example, I can walk into any barn, look at a horse and estimate, within a .1 of a hand, how tall that particular horse is, and be pretty darn close.  People on the other hand, not so much.  If people were measured in hands and I were mugged on a street in NYC, I would be much more effective at reporting the perpetrator to the police.  If I had to do it in feet, I think it would sound something like this; "Ummmm, I think he was between five foot and six foot, but I don't know".    So...in terms of my personal safety, and all the rest of the horse people out there, I think my drivers license should read 16.3HH under the height category.

						   CLEARLY, creating a musical freestyle to be performed in 60 days is a bit more difficult than I anticipated.  After spending last night working w/my dressage arena white board (which I ruined in the process), the USDF "requirements" and my chosen Cd, I am slightly concerned that I have bitten off more than I can chew.  As it turns out, all the cool moves I came up with don't necessarily blend as well together as I had anticipated. It also turns out that first level just isn't that interesting. So....what now?  I'm not going to give up, even though the really difficult work of putting all of this together has yet begun.  It is going to be a spectacle at the Fall Festival anyway...I might as well set it to music....can't be worse than all the other crappy Freestyles I've seen over the years.  So, if anyone has musical freestyle videos they would be willing to share PLEASE let me know.  Lord knows I need the inspiration.

I am ready to swallow some bugs (which happens frequently if you ride w/your mouth open)! All I want to do is walk my horse out in the pasture, for the love! Stupid rain...ruining a perfectly lovely summer!

						   Because I have a NASCAR loving boyfriend, I have watched the  Dressage Today  and  Chronicle of the Horse  subscriptions make a new friend,  American Thunder .  My Sunday afternoons are now filled with watching the weekly NASCAR Nextel Cup race.  I have found myself getting into this seemingly redneck sport....and I wasn't quite sure why, until I watched the cars and drivers practice for the road course in Sonoma, California two weeks ago.  While watching this practice session on FX, I realized that NASCAR has some similarities to dressage!!    First off, all of the drivers are assigned to one car and one team that they work with, every single weekend.  Similar to how Grand Prix dressage riders typically only compete one horse at a time.  Some NASCAR drivers will be contracted to drive another car in the Busch Series, one "level" below the Cup race. We see this in the dressage ring as well.  The Grand Prix riders often have a younger, less experienced horse they will compete at lower levels.  Additionally, the drivers and teams take their cars to the race track before the actual race to "test".  This gives the driver the opportunity to learn the track and the team an opportunity to fine-tune the car and make adjustments to the engine so that come race day, they are more than ready.  I am pretty sure I do exactly the same thing when I practice my dressage test at home before a show.  I ride through all the movements, learn the test and then fine-tune the problem areas.  Like that tricky half-pass to flying change movement.  On race day, the drivers focus and put their game faces on.  Many of them have pre-race routines that they follow.  I have similar pre-show routines.  During the race, the drivers are allowed to have a spotter that is positioned high above the track and through radio communications with the driver, helps them pass other drivers on the track.  The spotter is responsible for alerting the driver if there is another car on the "high" side (right) or "low" side (left). The terms "high" and "low" feel all too familiar.....outside and insider rein?!?!? In my mind, the spotter is similar to the person reading my test.  At superspeedways, the tracks are so large that drivers often need more than one spotter.  Wouldn't it be nice to have two readers at the times when the wind is blowing 90 mph and you can't hear the one reader at B?  Throughout the race, the driver communicates with the crew chief about how the car feels.  The driver will report whether or not the car is loose or tight, or if it is pushing or pulling.  All of these terms refer to how the car is driving through the corner.  A loose car feels like it is out of control and will spin out in the corner.  A tight car is really hard to turn.  I know a tight horse is really hard to turn around an 8 m volte!  At pit stops, the crew chief will take those comments from the driver and make adjustments to the car.  They will add or remove spring rubbers to stop pushing and pulling or they will tighten and loosen the track bar to correct looseness or tightness.  To me, these symbolize all of the things I do in my warm-up to adjust how my horse "handles".  I might school a series of travers, renvers, travers to loosen up my horse's "track bar" and get a little better control over the hind legs.  For me, the profound discovery of the similarities was apparent while watching the cars take tight s-curves on a road course.  As these cars were switching directions and taking these curves, I realized that the crews had the cars set up so that they would almost sit through the turns.  The cars would crouch on their rear tires through the turns and lift their front ends off the ground.  It looked like a very classically trained horse doing a canter pirouette!  Interviews with the crew chiefs revealed that they manipulate the springs in the rear-end and aerodynamics so that they cars do that and they are faster.  Are you with me yet........?  Even the way the press talks about the drivers is similar to  Dressage Today's  commentary on our famous Olympic riders.  I recently read an interview discussing the surprising talents of a rookie driver.  The article said this rookie was so successful because he has a "natural feel of the car and its faults; and an amazing ability to tell his crew chief how to adjust the car".  I am certain I have read that sort of commentary on up-and-coming dressage riders.  "They just have a natural feel for the horse".  So next time you have finished schooling your wonderful steed on a Sunday morning, take the opportunity to watch a NASCAR Nextel Cup race....I promise you the similarities will be quite surprising.  I am not sure, however, that I have convinced myself that galloping around on a 1200 animal is more or less dangerous than driving a stock car at 195 mph.  The nice thing about sticking with dressage is that we get to go to the right and the left.....NASCAR drivers must go to the left every race.  It appears those NASCAR drivers need a little more left rein and a lecture about straightness between the seatbones.

						   Can I comment on riding attire for a few minutes?  I thought dressage was about history, sophistication, and tradition.  It is possible that I am wrong.  Our show attire, white breeches, black coat, crisp white shirt with stock tie, represents all three of those things....history, sophistication, and tradition.  When did sex appeal enter into our schooling attire?  I recently saw a young lady school her horse in some interesting attire.  She had the waistband of her breeches rolled down to her hips, and it was quite obvious there were no undergarments under those tight-fitting, tan breeches.  Here shirt was short-sleeved and equally short-waisted.  Her belly button ring was shining in the sun.  Her shirt was  tight-fitting and scoop-necked.  Her large, pontentially fake, chest area was well presented in this particular shirt.    My practical thinking mind would like to know what was gained by wearing this attire??  Perhaps it was to show off her slender figure in the saddle.  That's all well and good, but there wasn't anyone else watching.  It was her and the horse.  Furthermore, what would have happened if she were launched from her steed's back?  Her bare stomach was surely going to experience some serious lacerations and "road rash" from the abrasive arena sand.  I would really hate to have sand in my bra after skidding down the long side of the arena!  My biggest worry was the belly button ring.  Can you imagine the carnage if she were bucked off and her ring caught on the saddle or other tack item?   Perhaps I am being petty.  Or perhaps I am just a product of old school dressage training.  Maybe this young lady needs a German riding instructor yelling at her about her choice of schooling clothes.  I know that I was never yelled at for this particlur crime, but it was an unspoken rule that your breeches (typically of a dark color, some plaids and pleats as long as they were sophisicated)were worn with a leather belt and collared shirt to a clinic or when schooling.  Sleeveless shirts were ok, as long as it had a collar.    Evidently, I have missed the memo about sex appeal in the dressage ring.  First it was swallow-tailed dressage pads in the show ring (which I love, by the way), next it will be belly-cut dressage coats.  I guess I need to relax.....

						   As we all know, I am a single lady now, and up until last night the origins of my split from Jason were unknown.  As it turns out Dobby made the top 3 reasons Jason had to break it off.  1) We are too different 2)Empty Promises (mostly relating to me cleaning the house) 3) I spend too much time and too much $$ on my horse  Okay, I love the guy, and I know we are going to be friends, but man if you can't love my horse, you can't love me.  Done dealin'!  I felt like I got my life back when I bought Dobby, but apparently Jason was threatened.  Silly man!  I guess I am supposed to be at home cleaning the house and cooking him dinner instead of out at the barn ridin' my pony.   So Cheers to Dobby, for bringing back the Margo I know and love, and making Jason show his true colors!

Between my arm, Margo's boyfriend and Cosette's dog.....we are finished, no mas!!  My arm is feeling ok. The morons that call themselves Drs. are disagreeing, but life goes on. ALL of you will be recruited to ride Durango at some point or another in the next two and a half weeks. I'll help you with him.  See you at the barn!!

      Yesterday I mocked my malingering co-worker, and her pimple/second head.  Today I wake-up, and the subterranean pimple living in my chin turns into a HUGE puss filled mountain on my face.  And they say there is no justice in this world!    In other news, a new horse is moving into the barn today, a stallion.  I'll be interested to see how the mares at the barn react to his testosterone!  I'll also be very interested to see him ridden, as his rider is under the tutalage of one of my old riding instructors and the former owner of our barn. How did I live for 2 years without all of this horse drama?   As far as I am concerned, if the rider is nice, and the Stallion behaves, they are both welcome.  However, we have such a nice dynamic at the barn right now, the prospect of someone else coming in is a bit nerve racking. Only time will tell.

      You really ought to give Quetta a chance.  Not only is she a gourmet guru, but also a truly wonderful companion and friend.  Maybe sometimes you get down, perhaps the other billionaires pick on you.  If you would just give her a chance, I'm sure Quetta could make you feel better.  She has a way of making even the worst situation feel better.  She can see the silver lining in almost everything. Everyone needs someone like that in their life, Quetta could be yours.  Plus, I bet she is a better kisser than Sergey.  Don't be foolish Larry! Don't miss your shot at the best thing going in the Bay Area!

      I have this co-worker, and she is constantly sick. Already this week she has suffered from: a migrane, a sinus infection, a giant lip pimple and a sunburn. What amazes me about this young lady is that although she "suffers" from all these ailments, she shows no sign of actually having any of the diseases (except for the pimple/second head).   Today she is claiming her sunburn (which must be on her ass because the rest of her looks decidedly not burnt) has caused a sinus infection, and the infection has caused her lip to swell. I have it on good authority from an acutal licenced nurse that sunburns can in no way cause someone to develop a sinus infection, nor grow a second head on their lip.   I find her "suffering" both funny and sad. On one hand, it is sad that the only hobby she has is faking illness. On the other, she is so ignorant of the symptoms and causes of the diseases she suffers from it is funny.   I think I am going to go get the medical dictionary and look up some interesting ailments. Perhaps I can convince her that she can get Monkey Pox from toilet seats or somthing. Hee hee.

      Is is possible to have a 2 day hangover?    I spent the entire weekend at a wedding in Howells Nebraska. I took more shots in one night, than  I did during my entire sophomore year of college.    Despite my grumblings about the cranberry bridesmaid's dresses Jenny's Howells wedding was, to date, the best wedding I have ever attended. It is such a rare thing to be a part of someone's dream.  And though her dream involved a 2 hour wedding ceremony, a hay rack ride and the chicken dance, it was a beautiful thing to see it finally come true.   All this being said...I'm off to get cup of coffee number 4, in an attempt to caffinate the remaining Jack Daniels out of my system.

If I could get to Cali in one day to help you move I would.   This blog is also for dear Jamee, who broke her arm while working with 1,100 cows.  I'm sorry, let me know if you'd like me to type out your blog.  I'm great w/dictation!

      There's been a great deal of controversy in the sports world swirling around Ricky Williams's decision to retire after only 5 years in the NFL.&nbsp; Sports writers everywhere are calling Ricky, selfish, stupid, weird and crazy.&nbsp; They are already blaming him for the Miami Dolphins shitty season, before pre-season has even started.&nbsp;   You can't freak out about him leaving the league and in the same sentence say he is&nbsp;not much of an asset to a team.&nbsp; Make up your mind people.&nbsp; If&nbsp;Dave Wonstadt gets fired&nbsp;after this season it won't be&nbsp;Ricky's fault.&nbsp; It's not Ricky's fault that the entire line is built upon one man running 350 yards.   I fully support Ricky's decision to leave the game.&nbsp; especially if he goes back&nbsp;(as he is reported to be thinking about)&nbsp;to Texas A&M to get his teaching degree so he can become a teacher.&nbsp; Good for Ricky for getting out of the NFL with some cash and a body that isn't totally fucked so he can do something a little bit more beneficial to society than running with a ball on Sunday.&nbsp;

      The Baroness has done it again!&nbsp; Just when I think I have reached the bottom of the stupid barrel with her she does something like this!&nbsp; Not surprisingly, the Baroness is a blonde.&nbsp; Apparently this past weekend she and Chauncey went up to a beauty school in Fremont NE (which is known more for producing dog chow than trendsetting hair styles) to get their hair done.&nbsp; Chauncey's do turned out fine, the Baroness was not so lucky.&nbsp; She had requested that the "stylist" give her ruby red highlights (yes in her blonde hair), as luck would have it, red turned out to&nbsp;be fushia, and pink.&nbsp;She looks like  urlLink Jem .  Everyone at the office is grinning like a Chesshire cat because the baroness looks so pitifully stupid.&nbsp;Despite all the grins and muted giggles, the Baroness is planning on keeping her hair this awful color b/c Chauncey said it was "sexy."&nbsp;&nbsp;This hair will live on forever in office lore... I don't know how anyone will ever top this!

      I  LOVE  my truck!&nbsp; Earlier this spring, I sold my gas guzzling peice of shit, busted-ass Durango and bought myself a beautiful 100% American GMC pick-up truck.&nbsp; Aside from deciding to buy my horse Dobby, the pick-up truck is one of the best decisions I've made in the last 2 years.&nbsp; Veronica (named after the Elvis Costello song of the same name) is much much more practical, has a better fuel economy and will safely transport me, my horse, my dog and all the crap we can fit into her short box where ever the hell we want to go!&nbsp;   She (Veronica) is a graphite gray GMC Sierra, extended cab (has a back seat), short box 4 wheel drive, 1/2 ton&nbsp;joy on wheels.&nbsp; Growing up around horses, I've always loved pick-ups, so it really is a dream come true to own one!&nbsp; The bumpy ride, jumping into the bed using the rear tire as a step, the high celing, flat winsheild, the hollow noise the doors make when you close them...paradise on wheels.&nbsp;   The best part of the whole truck,&nbsp; is driving with&nbsp;my right&nbsp;&nbsp;hand on the wheel and my left arm&nbsp;out the&nbsp;window.&nbsp; To me, hanging my left elbow out the window of my very own truck is much more satisfying than any sun roof, or&nbsp;convertable.&nbsp; Sadly,&nbsp; this elbow out the window habit has resulted in a very odd trucker/farmer tan.&nbsp; The only part of my body that has a "tan" is my left arm from the sleave down.&nbsp; Thank god I don't get a very dark tan!&nbsp;   Ah who cares, I love my truck and it makes me very happy, regarless of any odd body coloring that may result.

      Today is Friday! For as long as I've had my own transportation and $$ Friday has been a day for light shopping.&nbsp; After work I am going to buy myself some new music.&nbsp; I know for sure that I am going to buy the new Franz Ferdinand album and something else that is primarily guitar driven music not soley written about the pursuits of money and pussy.  I really miss rock.&nbsp; I miss the days when guitars and drums ruled radio stations and there were more songs about love and life than about bling and bling.&nbsp; I hope someday rock returns to the forefront of popular music.&nbsp; Perhaps someday music will be about artistry, not industry and all songs won't contain advertisements for cars, clothes, vacation destinations or liquor.&nbsp; I just hope that when my kids grow up there will be great rock band for them to play air guitar with and bang their little heads.&nbsp;   Long live rock! And if anyone has suggestions for a good rock band to fall in love with lemme know!

       Before I get started ranting and raving, I'd like to mention that I am in no way seeking pity, or fishing for complements.&nbsp; Tonight, I am going to attempt to use my blog to clear my thoughts about being a fat girl.     &nbsp;   First of all, I am a size 16ish, down from a 20 this winter.&nbsp; Like most "fat" people, I'm on a diet. My preferred method of deprivation is the South Beach diet, combined with a healthy dose of cheating (usually pizza, beer&nbsp;or ice cream).&nbsp; Most people right off hand wouldn't call a girl my size fat, but you would be surprised how marginalized I feel.&nbsp; Let me explain....     &nbsp;  Pretty much everything I do, from grocery shopping to the way I sit revolves around the fact that I am fat.&nbsp;&nbsp;I am unable to escape from my size.&nbsp;&nbsp;Regardless of the love I feel from the people around me, I&nbsp; feel like less of a person simply because there is more of me here than is necessary. It seems all today's society cares about anymore is your waist size.&nbsp; I&nbsp;tell myself that I am a good and interesting person of many talents, but those&nbsp;things don't matter anymore.&nbsp;Talent and personality seem like lame excuses for why I am not thin. I would never want to sacrifice my personality for a size 4 waist...but I probably&nbsp;would be better off if I did.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  I feel as if I will never get the kind of respect a smaller girl does. I will always be perceived as lazy, or undisciplined as long as I remain over weight.&nbsp;&nbsp;Lately, I am worried that I&nbsp;will get&nbsp;beat in the dressage ring by a lesser rider on a lesser horse merely because they are more aesthetically pleasing than I.&nbsp; Why must everything today be sexed up?&nbsp; Why&nbsp;is extra weight around the mid-section a scarlet letter?&nbsp; Surely not because of the health risks! &nbsp;  I am really sick of feeling so ashamed but my stubborn "fuck&nbsp; you" nature urges me not to bother with losing weight because I love who I am...I just happen to hate what I look like.&nbsp; I don't want to be skinny so&nbsp;Joe America will&nbsp;accept me.&nbsp;&nbsp;By&nbsp; the same token I don't want to be shunned by him either.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to lose weight so I can walk through a bar without my ass knocking over a chair.&nbsp; I want to eat french fries without being looked at like a criminal.&nbsp; I don't want to shop in the "women's" section anymore.&nbsp; I want to go any where and do anything I want without anyone looking twice.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  I could go on for days about what being over weight does to your life... all the little things, the nasty&nbsp;comments, daily humiliations.&nbsp; What good does it do? I suppose none. I suppose I could have been doing Pilates right now instead of bitching about being fat.&nbsp; Easier said than done.  &nbsp;

      I don't claim to be an expert on relationships...I'm no Dr. Phil.&nbsp; However, I have been with my lovely BF for four and a half years, during which we have weathered many storms, so perhaps I'm more of an expert than others.&nbsp; The Baroness Von Munchausen's is at it again!&nbsp; Apparently her affinity for disease is not limited to her own mind and body, but also pollutes her realtionship with Chauncey. &nbsp; Today over lunch she was complaining that Chauncey doesn't say "I love you enough."&nbsp; From prior lunchtime convos, it has also come out that he doesn't show her enough affection, he is not romantic enough and he has a required daily dosage of the Baroness. "If&nbsp;I didn't force Chauncey to spend&nbsp;3 nights at home with me during the week and&nbsp;one weekend night, I'd never see&nbsp;him!"&nbsp; To me, all of the above within a year and a half period is a terrible sign. &nbsp; With this in mind, let me give out some advice to all of you on relationships.&nbsp; If you have to force your BF to say "I love you", spend QT with you, pay attention to you, snuggle with you...there are some major problems.&nbsp; The whole key to a relationship is wanting to be together...if your BF doesn't want to spend time with you, then perhaps it is time for a new BF.&nbsp;&nbsp; From my perspective, I only want to be with someone who wants to be with me, and I only want genuine romance and affection that comes from his heart, not from a list of things I told him&nbsp;he should do. &nbsp; &nbsp;

      WHOA!!!! HOLY FUCKING SHIT!!!!!!!!!!!!  I just finished watching this week's installment of one of my fav TV shows, Six Feet Under.  AND HOLY FUCKING SHIT!!!  It was so scary and disturbing, I'm honestly feeling very unsettled right now.  I watch Six Feet Under for the pretentiousness and weird characters...I don't need this shit!    For those of you who didn't catch the episode, let me break it down for you.  The last 40 min of the show were devoted to David (the gay funeral director)and the hitchhiker he stupidly picked up!  The innocent, cute looking guy ran out of gas blah blah.  Turns out, that the guy is totally banannas, forces David to take a bunch of money out of an ATM, throws this week's corpse out of the transport van, forces David to smoke crack, rapes him...beats the shit out of him then pours gasoline all over him and leaves him for dead in an alley. VERY SCARY!  I have nightmares like that...and if you know anything about Six Feet Under, you know how cerebral and distrubing this episode was.  HOLY FUCKING SHIT.  I am soooo writing Alan Ball to complain!  I hope they don't win any Emmies just because this particular episode was so nasty and unnecessary! David's relationship paranoia and hankering for annonymos sex does not need to be punshied so visciously!    Okay...I am going to go light some calming candles and crochet for a while so I can forget about this nastiness.  I may have to watch Charlotte's Web or Harry Potter just to counteract the brutality of this episode.  Motherfuckers....damn TV..wait, it's not TV it's HBO...Damn HBO!

      I have a confession to make.&nbsp; I hate to tell all of my regular male readers this, but honesty is important to me...so here I go.  &nbsp; Despite&nbsp; all of your wild fantasies, I am not sexy.&nbsp; I am intelligent, funny and cultured.&nbsp; I can cook, clean, bake, crochet, ride a horse, do all kinds of wonderful things with computers...I can even speak french. I am a fiercely&nbsp;loyal friend!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I've got a degree in Political Science! &nbsp;But I am not sexy.&nbsp; I even have (what I would consider to be) a great personality, and have been told by some very reliable sources that &nbsp;I am fun to hang out with.&nbsp; I also am talented in other fields, which are not suitable for the blog right now.&nbsp; But I am definitly not sexy. &nbsp; I came to this realization the other night after being bombared by commentary on the&nbsp;100 sexiest women of one thing or another.&nbsp;&nbsp;All of them were very skinny, had big huge boobies, and some major hair.&nbsp; Not to mention flawless skin and the perfect "come hither" stare.&nbsp;&nbsp;So, despite my best efforts and all my talents, it must be said that I am not sexy.&nbsp; My boobs aren't that great(acutally, I noticed yesterday one points up, the other down).&nbsp; I'm not skinny, my skin doesn't glow and even after practicing for several hours, I still can't do a come hither stare. &nbsp; What is all this talent, kindness, and intelligence worth if I can't&nbsp;wear a bikini top with jeans and heels to the hottest clubs in Lincoln NE???? Looks like it is time to apply for an&nbsp;Extreme Make-over.&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp;

      I love my coffee. I drink it black, with grounds in the bottom of my cup...really strong.  I love my coffee. When my coffee man told me that my favorite blend of coffee, Hatian Bleu Voodoo, was not going to be available until next year b/c a flood (and civil war) ruined the enire crop of beans I was devestated!  Since then my coffee man, Mark, has been trying to find me a new brew until mine is growing again. I view Mark with the same kind of passion that a gourmet has about their Fishmonger or Fromager. Bless Mark and his fair trade organic coffees and teas.    Mark runs The Coffee House here in Lincoln. There are others (whose names aren't even worth mentioning) but The  urlLink Coffee House  is the best.  It is the only place in Lincoln where you can enjoy the sublime combination of strong coffee and a cigarette in public (until 10/31/04 anyway). It is the perfect place to read a book or write in your journal.  It is also the best place in Lincoln to meet up with your pals and hang out until the evening really gets started. There are couches, computers, Goths, board games and free books.  It is the venue from which many of my finest undergraduate term papers were written, and the host to some extraordinary conversations. Not to mention vicious card games and raukcus domino matches.  I will always love the Coffee House, Mark, and all the other Baristas (epecially Collin, Sandy, Chris and of course Casey). They are my little coffee family.  And though some may scoff at my endless love for a place my mother calls "a smoke filled dive"  and my boyfriend says is "dark and weird" there will always be a place in my heart for The Ho.

      I'm not a racist.  I'm not homophobic.  I'm not sexist or even agist, but I do discriminate.  I really can't stand stupid people.  I just ate lunch with stupid people.  Grrr!  The only thing I dislike more than stupid people, are stupid people discussing intelligent issues for dummies.  Here is a list of things that I've observed make dumb people feel deep/smart/cultured:  Dateline NBC  People Magazine Exclusives Greek Food Red Shoes The Matrix Forrest Gump The Day After Tomorrow The Goo Goo Dolls Counting Crows Dido The War in Iraq Low Carb Diets Vincent VanGogh's Starry Starry Night All Monet...especially on coffee mugs and posters in bathrooms Oprah/Dr. Phil Inside the Actor's Studio John (?) Patterson Novels Starbucks Coffee Las Vegas, NV AOL Email Forwards About Angels (or anything to do w/believing in Angels) The Wedding/Baby/Date Story  If you happen to be an intelligent, cultured person and still enjoy eating Greek food while watching Oprah wearing your red shoes, that's fine.  Enjoying any of the above does not automatically make you stupid.  However if the above listed are the zenith of your cultural experiences or the primary source of your intellectual pursuits then you are quite obviously a dumbass, and should stay the hell away from me.

      My poor poor malingering co-worker!  Will her suffering ever end?  Yesterday morning, as I was making the first pot of office coffee the Baroness confided in me after our morning greeting that she would be better if she would just get her period.  Now, this is the 5th or 6th time she's had a pregnancy "scare" since she started working here in March.   Yesterday afternoon she was complaining that her scent of grass allergy was acting up.  This young lady claims she has no reaction when she walks on grass, she can sit on grass, but the smell of cut grass is enough to stop her entire respiratory system...or at least make her constantly gesture about her face with her hands.  Luckily no, corn dust, wheat dust or pollen were in the air yesterday, or she surely would have died right there in her cubicle.  Again this morning I was brewing the first pot of office coffee. "How are you today Baroness?"  "Oh fine, except Chauncey (the BF) HAD to sleep with the windows open, and it rained all night so my allergies are acting up."  It turns out the smell of rain is much like that of the smell of cut grass...absolutely LETHAL!  Allergic to rain? Hmmm.   Just for my own sake, I am going to review this.  The Baroness:  Perhaps pregnant (again), gets sinus infections from invisible sunburns, suffers from constant migranes, mysterious back problems, allergic to the smell of cut grass, wheat dust, corn dust (but not corn nuts) and the smell of rain.  By her own account everything she is allergic to is dead in the fall so, hopefully by September, the pregnancy is all we'll have to worry about.  Thank God!

      I've spent a decent amount of space on this blog trying to get  LARRY PAGE  to go out with my good buddy JACQUETTA, These efforts will not cease until Mr.  LARRY PAGE  at the very least personally contacts my dear friend to tell her why he has been so coy. Get with it  LARRY  use your brainternet, contact Quetta, go have a cup of coffee and let all of us get on with our lives!  Now my friend JAMEE has started reaching out to NASACAR hottie  KASEY KAHNE , in hopes of getting his attention. Kasey, if you are out there, googling yourself and come across my blog, let me tell you that Jamee is a great great lady, and she has a smokin' hot bod that you must see for yourself.  Vroom vroom! Kasey, don't be a fool like Larry, get with the program...get with Jamee!  Just in case anyone was concerned that my emotional needs were not being met, because I have so dedicated myself to the job of getting LARRY PAGE and just recently KASEY KAHNE to take my girl friends out...FEAR NOT!  I am betrothed to a lovely gentleman named Jason.  He is just great, sweet, funny and very kind.  BUT, there is always room for improvment.  By improvement I mean, an upgrade.  An upgrade to perhaps....  HUGH JACKMAN  .  Certainly the universe will find it necessary to put   HUGH JACKMAN   in my path after all the nice things I do for others.  Hey universe, remember that time 2 weeks ago that I let that lady take my spot in line at the grocery store cuz' she had less stuff?  Yeah...start turning Hugh my way.  So girls, good luck with your Googlebots and blogs, I'm gonna work on Karma!

The day following vacation is ALWAYS bad.  I should have  been more prepared!  Anyway....I'm obsessed with this show called "Blow Out" on Bravo, and I am very upset to find that the season finale is already next week!!!!  If you're not familiar "Blow Out" is like the NASCAR 360 (nice Bucket Jameelyn)of the hair salon world.  It stars  urlLink Jonathan Antin  as he (in true Rocco Dispirito form) tries to open a second salon in Beverly Hills (with a little help from Open by American Express, Lens Crafters and Revlon).  Jonathan is the gayest straight man ever! He brings metrosexual to a whole new advanced level.   Most of the time he is gay, but just when you have figured out if he is a top or a bottom, he drops these very piggish lines about wanting to do hot ladies (and I'm not talkin' hair).  Oopps not ladies "bunnies" or "foxes"  The show is just great, lots of major drama about little things (like scisors), clashing personalities (Jonathan vs. Brandon) and of course it takes place on Rodeo Drive, so there are lots of plastic ladies filling the chairs.  I only wish we heard more of the gossip coming out of the customers, b/c really, I don't care if Kimberly thinks she can give a good clipper cut, I want the dirt!

      Nothing puts me into a gun toting mood more than scores of irrational, idiotic, obsessive fuck-sticks calling me all day long.  If I have to explain the fee agreement to another client I am going to scream. Listen folks, when you hire an attorney, you have to pay them.    I don't care if you can't pay for cable and you will miss your daughter's appearance on Maury.  I don't care if you don't have enough money to bail your dog out of the pound.  I don't care if you owe some guy 1/2 down on a new pair of "rims."  And I don't believe for one minute that you can rack up $2,000.00 worth of late fees on your trailer rental and utilities in one month.  No more lame excuses! You sign a fee agreement, we're takin' a fucking fee.  STOP CALLING!!!  I'm sure our new veepidential candidate Mr. Edwards understands as only a plaintiff's attorney could!

      Work Sucks!  I suck at work!  I am sick of my job, I am sick of having 2 attorneys on my butt day in and day out, not to mention the irrational, rude, obsessive clients who call constantly everyday.  "I hate to bother you, but when is my case going to be done?"  "Mr. X, we just opened your case last week, you were injured at the end of June, I wouldn't be expecting a settlment offer for at least, nine months."  Grr, I'm behind on just about everything, and I'm not quite sure how that happened.  Somehow all my work motivation is gone. I would take a vacation to clear my head, but I have no where to go and no money to get me there.  Grr... I'm sick of being an adult!  Law School here I come!  Please leave me a comment if you have any ideas (short of gunning people down)to help me get my ass motivated before one of my attorneys comes down on me.  Fucking lousy job!

      I saw an interesting (and by interesting, I mean funny in a gross way) feature on the Today show this morning.  Apparently  public pools, lakes, hot tubs and rivers are dirty!  Dirty and they harbor gross bacteria. Shocker! Did the  urlLink CDC  really have to spent millions of dollars to figure out that pools and hot tubs are full of bacteria?    Further findings from this report also strongly recommend that people who have diaheria stay out of the pool, as diarheria quickly spreads bacteria through the water. What kind of person swims with diahreia?  I can barley walk when I've got the squirts, let alone swim.    It always baffled me that you weren't supposed to swim for at least 30 min after you ate, yet all pools sell food.  Now that we aren't supposed to swim with diarheia are snack bars going to start serving cabbage egg and cheese sandwiches with beer?   To me, this whole report sounds like the brilliant plan of some 26 year old CDC researcher who wanted to spend the summer at the pool.  What next, a CDC report on the correlation between smoking weed and weight gain?

      All of today's blogging efforts are dedicated to my friend Jamee who was so ruthlessly conned into laundering money for some Nigerian A-holes posing as flute enthusists.  Today is your day Jamee!!  Oh and Larry, with all the money of yours perhaps you could investigate some of these  urlLink scamming A-holes , so innocent people like Jamee don't get taken.

      Huh...what?  Oh...sorry dozed off there. Perhaps I stayed out too late last night with my BF playing Golden Tee and watching controversial documentary films.  Or perhaps it is the fact that MY JOB IS BORING!!!  Grogginess and sitting in front of a computer in a cubicle all day is a bad BAD combination.  If I were at home, I would do some laundry and take a 3 hour nap on the couch with a soft blanket and my cat and then go ride my pony, come home and take another nap. Sadly however, I am going to be in the office all day, and 3 hour naps are frowned upon here.  Napping should be allowed at work.  Maybe not everyday, and definitly not for 3 hours, but light naps.  On days like today my productivity shoots way down. I'm certain if I could just take an invigorating 30 min nap I would turn into super assistant, and maybe even have a good attitude.  But for now, I'll just go on about my day, with the enthusiasm of a sloth on a hot summer day.

      I really hate rudeness, in all forms, but especially from people I know...Especially from people who should know better.  Let me be clear to all of you, if I send you an email, especially a personal email asking you a question, or inquiring about the status of your life at this moment I expect a reply. I am a firm believer in returning phone calls and returning emails. I'm excellent with the replies, I probably go into too much detail. Let it not be said that friends of Margo (FOM) don't know what is going on in my life...after all they have this wonderful blog to read!  So FOM and FFOMs(Future friends of Margo) consider yourself warned that I will not tolerate rudeness among my friends. And if you are too busy and too important to reply back to a simple email then perhaps you are too important to be my pal. Any normal human being with any computer skill at all can knock out a simple life update in about 2 min. I wouldn't ask if I didn't want to know. And if it is really that bad then reply back and tell me to Fuck off!

      Thank you Jamee! Thank you for introducing me to the sick pleasures of Nip/Tuck! I fucking love that show, totally gross, utterly heavy handed, but I love it.  How lucky was that hooker tonight? I'd pay a great quantity of my good money (I'm talkin' 3 or 4 paychecks) to be stuck between Christian and Sean all night long in a dorm room. Meeeoooowww!!!!  definitely going to buy season one this week. I smell a Nip/Tuck-a-thon brewing!!!

      I would like to air a grievance! I'm  thisclose  to giving out grammar lessons to my co-workers Dumb and Dumber. These would be the 2 girls I work with who, using their combined intelligence, are unable to complete the People magazine crossword puzzle without outside assistance. Let the record show that the now famous Baroness is a part of this brain trust.  And now my grievance:  FOR THE LOVE OF GOD STOP SAYING "FOR REALS." Especially in reference to the discovery that someone is on the phone for you "Yeah, Dumber, John Malkovich is on the phone for you." "For reals!?!" Real is an adjective, a descriptive word. Even if you were at the threshold the StarGate, or living in some kind of parallel universe, you would be dealing with 2 different realities. Not reals. In lieu of "For reals" you might want to try "Oh really, that's odd" or "are you serious" even "no shit!?"  And while I'm at it, ladies, stop saying "Yo" as a greeting. You're both white farm girls who are too young to have ever appreciated "YO!" MTV Raps. We work in a law firm, not the marines. "Yo" like "For Reals" does not sound cool. It is stupid and annoying. Almost as annoying as men who answer the phone "Waaaazzzzuuuuuuppppp." Not cool.  Thank you...this concludes today's broadcast of my grievances.

      It is the little things in life that make me happy. My new shampoo for example, it smells like maple and brown sugar instant oatmeal. Coincidentally, my favorite flavor of oatmeal, and the current colour of my hair. I LOVE the smell of my hair right now.  I love the first week of a new shampoo, before my nose gets used to the odor. I love knowing for certain that I smell great! There are few things in life greater than a person (especially a man) who smells wonderful. I don't know why more people don't notice these things... maybe I'm strange but I really revel in wonderful smells that surround me. Like new hay, men's cologne, a coffee house (especially my smoky coffee house), clean laundry, pot roast in the oven or a clove cigarette.  My advice to everyone is this: stop to smell. Not just the roses, but the world around you.

      I have two cats: Tuxedo, and Jackson Pollack . My parents have two cats: Tommy and Mija. My current living situation is filled with cats, it's becoming a problem. My older cat, Tux , has decided that she is the Queen of this new house. She chases my folks ancient Siamese around the house. She eats any and all food, including cat food, dog food and stray people food in the house.  As I write this, Tux is howling in Tommy's face, he is growling and howling back at her. I can' t tell if he is in love with her, of if he wants to bite her ears off. This "singing" has become a daily occurrence at about 5:30am. If you've ever heard cats fight, I'm sure you know their songs are far from soothing. This whole cat chorus problem goes way beyond anything the squirt bottle can fix...I think Tux may need some kitty counseling. Or I need ear plugs.

      Whoa nelly did I have an exciting weekend!! I got my hair done (a post break-up requirement for all women), went shopping(in the normal body section!!!!), scoped out an apartment, rode my horse a bunch, read a bunch, watched some Olympic coverage, did: my nails, my laundry, my horse's laundry, cleaned my loft, worked out and played with my kitties.  This is a lot more than I've done in one weekend for a very long time. While I was in my relationship, I didn't have the cash to go shopping or get my hair done. I was in this sort of depressive rut of riding my horse, and coming home to my couch. I've become a lot more active since the demise of my relationship, perhaps as a distraction.   I think it is more likely that I'm not waiting around for someone anymore. Not waiting for Jason to get home from work, thinking I need to be there when he gets home (which, as it turns out, was one of the only things I did right in our relationship) . Blah blah blah. I truly can do whatever I want without any expectation of a clean house, a cooked dinner or a paid bill. I can read all afternoon wearing new shoes and not feel guilty. Nice!  My mother commented the other day that I looked relieved to be away from Jason. Maybe in some sense I am. Since we broke-up a rash I'd been struggling with (on my arm) has gone away. I don't really miss him anymore. I really like my new more active lifestyle. I'm very happy to be away from someone who demanded so much of my time and effort with no noticeable appreciation. The only person I need to make happy now is me, and I'm really good at making me happy!

      We represent a lot of Hispanic clients at our law firm. Like everywhere else in America, they do the shit labor jobs that no one else wants to do, and thus get injured and need lawyers. Oft times, when a Hispanic client gets a big settlement, (or around the holidays) they send their lawyer, our interpreter and the legal assistant working on the case bottles of Tequila. The Tequila is ALWAYS from Mexico, and is almost always some brand that none of us have ever heard of nor seen.  I think it is wonderful that our clients send us liquor, on some level they must understand the stress we are under. My only problem with this practice, is that I don't like Tequila. I'm a gin and whiskey girl. I need to find a pocket of immigrants from the UK here in Nebraska, or a some truckers working for Beefeater's who need a good lawyer. The likelihood of me finding this magic population is small. And even if I did my Brits would probably just give me some friggin' jam. Bloody bastards!  Wait....I've got some clients in Canada...That's practically England right? Hmmmmm....time to star talking gin with these folk!

      Why oh why did it have to be a man!  Just when I thought I was done defending my beloved Bill Clinton to people who can't understand anything outside of sex and terroism...this happens. With all the talk about gay marriage, why does the  urlLink Gov of New Friggin' Jersey  have to cheat on his wife WITH A MAN!!  This kind of stupid controversy is exactly what the Democratic party doesn't need this year.  We need all the idiot fuck swing voters we can get.  I fear an unfaithful, homosexual governor may be more than most of these ignorant one-issue a-holes can forgive.  For the record I am fully supportive of men fucking other men.  Even public officials...just not in a tight election year...and not if you are married to a woman who has given him children...   Bill Maher was right, the only moral standing the Repelicans have is that they fuck their own wives.  Just look at that Republican Perv in IL...he wanted to have sex w/other ladies...and his wife...he wanted to watch women have sex-with his wife.  Damn those family values!

      Working in an office building is boring. I sit in taupe cubicle and stare at a computer all day. Despite all the pictures of super heroes, and me with my horse, my cube is still far from stimulating. These pictures and post cards are more reminders of the outside world, than decoration or comfort.  This morning I was in the copy room, scanning my morning mail into the computer (we're high tech!) and when I looked out the window at the grey day outside I saw the most beautiful rainbow. I've not seen such a nice rainbow since the last time I was up in the Mountains. At any rate, this rainbow was HUGE and bright and all the colors were there. As with any other news, the rainbow rumor spread quickly and soon enough all of the support staffers were outside, crammed onto the side entry stairs, gazing at the rainbow in awe.  For a couple minutes nobody was worried about interrogatories, or exhibit lists. The phones didn't ring and we weren't getting any "ASAP" emails. We all stood there and thought of the good things to come. It was nice. Nice in those moments to have a little peace out of our hectic day. And it was especially nice to fully appreciate nature in all her glory.

      Men.  Let me tell you a little something.  I'm not a fucking leper.   I'm not looking for easy sex. I'm not looking for a new boyfriend to dig my claws into. I'm not looking for someone to latch onto so they can"heal my broken heart." I'm not even really interested in any of you, beyond gazing at the super attractive specimens as a form of weight loss motivation.  So stop treating me like I'm a totally unstable super needy woman.  I am not.  I am actually strong enough to handle this without a man there to act as a hero.   I'm not going to call you an asshole, or punish you for whatever guilty feelings you men have about the things your sex does to women.  I frankly, don't care.  However, I am in a general sense, feeling a bit lonely, and want to hang out with my friends.  Including single male friends.  So suck it up guys, I'm not going to bite..or cry...or bitch. I'm just me. So stop walking on egg shells around me, I can handle you...trust me.

      5 phone calls, and 3 faxes later, I've spoken w/the Sub(ro)-Human that sent me the stupid letter.  When she answered the phone she seemed surprised it was me, and acted like she didn't know what I wanted.  "Oh.. the John Doe file...what was it you  needed ?"  As expected, she fed me a line of utter bullshit about her company just getting the file blah blah...all charges not entered. She's gonna fax me when the summary of ben paid is ready...right, I've heard it all before from the 10 other asshole adjusters I've spoken to about this fucking file.  Too bad I've got her name and number.  I'm gonna ride this bitch's ass like a trick pony until I get what I want.

      I've been working on a set of Lump Sum Settlment documents on a Work Comp case for the last 3 months. All I need to do is get an itemization of bills paid by this client's health insurance carrier. All they have to do is print out THE FUCKING SUMMARY OF BENEFITS PAID!!!!! So I can include their total payments in the settlment agreement, so our client can sign the fucking papers and get his goddamn money!  I don't know if anyone else has ever had to call an insurance company, if you have, I'm sure you completely underdstand my frustration. When you call and insurance company, one of two (or both) things happen. First of all you get an automated system of like 47 options: "if you are calling b/c your house is on fire, and you need to check your policy please hang up and dial 9-11 or dial 0 for the operator.." There is never a calling-from-an-attorney's-office-for-a-summary-of-benefits-paid-so-we-can-pay-you-assholes option.  Once I've navigated through the automated minefield, I usually end up talking to someone who has no clue what the hell I need, but knows they don't want to talk to anyone from an Attorney's office. I get transferred to "legal"...where (2) I get voice mail because the assholes are never by their phones.  So after an entire summer sitting on these LSS papers, and making calls, talking to robots and tape recorders I get a letter(presumably from some United Healthcare Cyborg) . A letter from the insurance company I've called at least 60 times...they've hired a subrogation service. Fuckers. In bold face the letter reads " Please contact us prior to settlement to obtain the total amount of paid bills. "  I lost it! WHAT DO THEY THINK I'VE BEEN CALLING FOR ALL SUMMER YOU STUPID CORPORATE COLD HEARTED REPUBLICAN ZOMBIE FUCKS!!!! I call the subro lady..and of course she was away from her desk. I'm going to leave this lady a message every 15 min today until I get a call back and a fucking fax.  Round and round we go...

      It is amazing how quickly one can recover from heartbreak, if you really work at it. For the last week or so I've been utterly consumed with this break-up and with Jason. That has all changed for me now. Yesterday, there was a reckoning, I let him know exactly how I feel, and exactly what he had done to me, and now I feel much better. Now that I've vented on him and he on me I am 100% certain we will be able to develop a lasting friendship.  I know there will be times ahead when I have bad moments, especially lonely moments. I'm confident I can make it through. Ask anyone who knows me, and they will tell you I've been through a lot of heavy shit in my life. This is definitely sucks, but is not the worst thing ever.  So gents, get ready... a brighter, bolder, better Margo is about to emerge from the shadows of a relationship. By November, I doubt any of you out there will be able to resist my charms!

      I need to say thanks to all of my wonderful friends for helping me in these dark times. I appreciate all the emails, and phone calls. Thanks to Sarah for listening to me as I ride the break-up roller coaster. Thanks to Jenny and Quetta for listening during my mood swing phone calls. Thanks to Jamee for listening to every detail, and trying to dissect Jason's brain with your Scientific mind. Thanks also for hanging out with my sorry ass. Thanks in advance to Tom for helping me move my bed this Saturday. I'll need your arms for strength and support as I leave 5211 Pioneers Blvd in the dust. And a special thanks to President Bill Clinton for his exceedingly detailed and rather boring memoir. Numbing my mind with the history of Hot Springs, AK really helps clear my mind before bed.  I know that I've been obsessive, and all the focus on this break-up is driving me up the wall, I can't imagine how annoying it must be for y'all. Soon enough this will all be over and I'll be a new improved, extra-strength Margo. If ever any of you need me for ANYTHING please call me and I will be there.

      I'm a free woman now.  I no longer need to worry about making a house payment, or how I am going to pay for bills and groceries.  I'm free, I can do whatever I want, whenever I want for how ever long I choose and with whomever I like (which actually isn't much of a change from my relationship). Except that I live with my mother...and she has opinions.   I'm looking at getting an apartment.  I've even got a couple picked out, and I'm waiting  until October to move so I can get my odd little debts and credit cards paid off.  I want to live on my own and make my own way.  Naturally my mother has other ideas.  At first she wanted me to live at home with her for a year...so I could find myself.   Then when I told her that wasn't happening, she started looking at a duplex.  A duplex for my brother and I (one on each side).  I love my brother, I have no problem living near him.  HOWEVER!  I want to live on my own and come and go as I please without any of my familiy breathing down my neck.   I understand that my mother is just trying to help, but I think it is time for her to back off.  Getting over the faded romance between Jason and I is going to be nothing compared to the struggle I'm going to have shaking off my overbearing (albeit, well meaning) mother.

      This break-up is one helluva ride.  I go from being incredibly hurt, feeling the full force of his rejection, to really pissed...and then I'm fine, even excited about the future...and then back to crying.  Right now, I feel okay.  Right now, I seem to have accepted the fact that Jason and I were just too different to last.  He's car shows and theme parks, I'm art galleries and historical sites.  We loved each other, and both found the differences facinating.  However, the facination wore off, and like impractical furniture, or beautifully painful shoes, the cost benefits don't add up.   Neither one of us did anything wrong, we helped each other through some tough places, we had a lot of good times, but it is time to separate.  I hope someday we can be friends.  I am excited to talk to him about what he will be up to.  I wish it would have worked out, I'm sorry if I made him feel like he had to change, but I changed too. This will be the best for both of us, just painful right now.  I hope this mood lasts.  I hope I can stick with this feeling and just let the pain fade away.  I'll find a new routine.  I'll make myself a new life.

      My boyfriend, Jason, of four years broke up with me Friday night.  I've stopped crying now, but it still hurts to be alive.  It hurts to think about him, it hurts to try to curl up in bed, only to find an empty space.  I can't sleep, I can't eat, and I can't sit still for more than about 15 min at a time.  And when I think about him, I wonder, is he miserable too?  Why, when I was so happy, and we were talking about marriage, did he suddenly break it off?  I may never know.   Now I have to move, right now I'm living with my parents, in the house they moved into last year.  It certainly isn't my home.  Soon though, I'll get another apartment and start really moving.  Moving on with my life, without him.  Asshole.
