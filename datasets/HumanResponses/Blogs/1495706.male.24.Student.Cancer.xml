      With all the excitement over discovering this new way to pass time and purge unnecessary thoughts I forgot to share an important lesson I learned this past week.  Simply put: Canadians have awesome powers.    And I know this is known to those who travel abroad, as it's just good sense to pretend you're from Canada, but it also has wonderful uses right here in the US.    So, I somehow ended up on this search committee for a new faculty member and one of the candidates is from Canada.  She was boring and condescending, her theory was not nearly as revolutionary as she believed it to be, and her educational background didn't qualify her for the position.  Despite all this she was the undergrad's candidate of choice, and all of them cited her Canadian background as the quality that set her apart from and above the other candidates.  Sure one of them already has a deal to publish her dissertation and the other has actually been teaching at the school for 5 years.  This one's from Canada (ok, the other major selling point was her stay in Thailand of unspecified length, an experience so horrific she sought refuge in grad school).  In reflecting on her boring lecture about the useless theory she stole I realized something else: the two moments of levity and joy in the room were connected to her Canadian-ness.  First the lady introducing her misspoke and told us all she was a specialist in Canadian bacon (she thought she'd said "banking", then she thought she'd said "baking").  Then about halfway through her talk she "accidentally" let out an "eh" at the end of the sentence.   I believe it was these two incidents that overwhelmed the undergrads.  Bringing me to a point, which I usually have.  Try to be more Canadian.  If the bitchy waitress from the bar the other night was Canadian I might not have hated her (I'm not immune to their powers).  If this theory-stealing boring woman was not Canadian she wouldn't have this job locked-in.  Heck, if she were Mexican we'd totally boot her ass back south seeing as she's about to take away one of our jobs.   This brings me to a suggestion, which I always have.  I think it might be a good idea to give Canadians darker skin.  That way their whole economy will collapse and nobody will help them.  With a collapsed economy they'll start spreading all over the place, pissing everyone off, and they'll lose this magical quality they currently possess.  And they really are magical beings because it didn't work when we tried to blame a couple mad cows on Canadian farms.  I'm also pretty sure there's a town in Wisconsin (Michigan?) that wants to join them and we can't be giving up territory like that.    It's up to you, scientists.  Prove your worth by taking out the Canadians.  Before it's too late.

      Could it be I've discovered something that will help me slaughter time, avoid doing anything constructive, and fill my need to ramble in random emails (formerly massmails (tm) which were retired about a year ago)?  Neat!  What would be good to rant about today...  Today I defended Bush.  I didn't want to do it, I don't feel good about having done it, but there it is- I defended Bush.  There was a discussion about the intelligence surrounding 9/11 and I suggested that it would've happened no matter what because it was such an implausible scenario.  So maybe he shouldn't get flak for it and we should just move forward with the process of learning from the mistake of allowing him to have power.  Y'know, like we learned from Nixon.  And Hitler.  Really, what would the lesson be from this if there was an intelligence lapse?  It would be that we should get hyper-vigilant every time anybody overheard anything that might be a threat, and we do that already (in theory- nothing rallies support like a good scare!) so it seems a bit...redundant to have more justification.  I also think it's time to rant about the FCC, because nobody seems to get the irony of fighting a war in the name of freedom while encouraging censorship because of Janet Jackson's all-powerful nipple and I'm a little peeved.  And I wish someone would enlighten me, cause I don't get it- how does the TV have such power?  I would think the easiest way to not be offended is to turn the television off.  Or you could, y'know, not own a tv set.    I'd like to suggest that if people aren't smart or capable enough to regulate their own viewing (or regulate for their children, God forbid parents actually pay attention to the Ritalin-filled little monsters) then we should give up this whole democracy thing.  See, that was sort of based on this notion that people weren't complete morons who needed the love and support of an authoritarian ruler chosen by God or, y'know, having killed the last authoritarian ruler.  But that was before anyone knew how it would function and now that we have some evidence maybe we should revise the concept.  Besides, you know that as long as people can get all the stuff they want they don't care what else is going on.    Or maybe we can introduce some kind of limit factor so not everyone has a chance to vote.  Like, we could setup fake voting where people think they're actually making a choice but the winner could be predetermined.  Oh wait we have that.  It's that electronic voting thing co-sponsored by friends of Bush, I believe.  Whatever, I'm in grad school.  Which means I don't have to come up with anything practical, I can just bullshit about the theories using big words (instantiate!) and complicated sentences.  Here's a fun contradiction:  Homegirl the professor raved about the beauty of nuanced arguments.  She ended the class explaining why a nuanced argument was meaningless and therefore the concept it supported should be dismissed.  I love contradictions!  Back to the rant: So maybe we could just stop voting entirely.  That money could be used to pay for something useful.  Like universal healthcare.  Or my student loans.    Damn that killed lots of time.  I'm pleased.  Maybe I'll start using this thing.

      Huh.  It could be from lack of sleep, but I just slid into a comfortable, stress-free happy zone.  The paper that's kicking my ass?  The paper I haven't started?  The job I've yet to find?  Not so much a concern anymore, and I credit 5-7pm Wednesday.    Nice moment 1-  Weird moment in the park.   I was wondering if I'd run into someone I knew and thinking how nice it was that I don't know very many people (since I was planning to study, or pretend to) so I wouldn't be interrupted.  And up walk two people I know.  Although one of them made a snide remark about this blog (apparently not knowing how much better it is that I expel a few of the thoughts from my head) it was one of those good random moments that make you wonder if you're a little psychic (I thought about them, there they were).  And one of the two people spotted a famous guy, and it's always nice to see celebrities even if they are lead singers from really irritating bands.  Odd, the first time I listened to an entire song by this band was at a bar with these same two people.  Good times.  Nice moment 2- The Prof. So after the random encounter I went to a scheduled one with a prof.  I expected the meeting to be him explaining to me what I wasn't understanding about the class, since he suggested we "talk," but it was actually kinda nice.  It's always fun to hear a professor talk trash about other students in the class, at least until you realize they'll do the same about you at some point in time.   But the meeting went well, despite my brain's steadfast refusal to function, and the best part was he offered, to be my thesis advisor.  About 20 minutes ago I realized how helpful that potentially is, since it means I don't have to worry about finding someone willing to do extra work for very little pay.  I think my faith in NYU is fully restored.  Even if it's bullshit, even if it never pans out, that's one person who's been helpful without prodding or extra financial incentives, and I'm beyond grateful.  It's also encouraged my brain to start refining potential thesis topics, and damned if that isn't exactly what I needed my brain to start doing.  And in a month, gods willing, I'll be in Spain.  So thanks, 5-7pm Wednesday!  And I think I should thank 6am Thursday, too, since that's when all the good things flowed together in my mind.

      Dreams...  My prof and I were in a car driving around somewhere,  my hometown but not, and we pulled into a parking space under a tree.  Then he asked "did you see that" and we were backing up and I noticed he ran over a squirrel, but the squirrel was ok.  And then it was in the car, and it jumped on me and got blood on my favorite shirt.  And it was clinging to me and I couldn't get it off to put it out of the car.    Then I had to wash my shirt to try and get the blood out, and my dad kept giving me advice how to do it but I told him I'd figure it out.  And I rinsed the shirt  and then washed it and my hands with dial handsoap.   Then at the end of the dream I was waking up in bed in my old room at home cause my cat was rubbing against me.  So I pet it and then got up, and I noticed our other cat was at the edge of my bed.  So I pet that cat and my cat, and then there was a third cat that jumped up and rubbed against the other two.  And I was surprised that the cats all got along because my cat hisses at the older cat.  I think maybe he did in the dream but I'm not sure.  And then it was weird because I was half-asleep, I think, dreaming/thinking of going online to search to see what the dream could've meant.  And there's a site I have bookmarked for that, but it wasn't my computer so I had to search for it.  And Yahoo! searches weren't the same, and I remembered that google wasn't providing Yahoo with searches anymore so I searched through google.com.  Then the site wasn't up anymore, but there were 5 options.  First was shutting it down and just chatting online with really, really close friends.  Then there was discussing one-on-one- analyzing one person's dream.  And there was taking the site down.   What else...Oh.  They could apply for a site of their own.  And then there was something about taking donations to help the site...it was all weird.  And I never remember dreams, when I'm able to sleep, so this is odd.  As an odd thing it must be preserved, hence preservation.

      It's early in the week but I'm finding several things a bit...obnoxious.  First, what's with Bush's press conference interfering with "American Idol"?  If he were going to, say, be honest, or answer questions that weren't pre-submitted by a select group of reporters then I might be interested in what he has to say.  Well, in theory.  In practice I would tune out because he makes me ill.  Although I did love the comment at his last press conference:  "The great thing about being president is that millions of people pray for me."  That's not made up, y'all.  It was a response to a hard-hitting question about Bush's religious faith and how it helps guide him (the media really should be embarrassed about that).  But, dammit, I need to know what Quentin Tarantino is going to say if the singing on AI sucks.  I need to see if that redheaded kid won't suck the energy out of the room.  I want to hear Jennifer Hudson yell at me.  In short, it's an important part of my week and for a man who has already fucked up my future to fuck this up is irritating.  (umm...to be on the safe side: I love Bush.  Bush is God.  All who oppose Bush are evil.)  Second, on the subject of the news media- if they don't stop revealing scandals now they're going to hand the election to Bush.  People will get sick of hearing the bad news and it wil make it seem like he's getting attacked.  Wait 'til August, reporters, to get over your guilt at being (mostly) ridiculously lazy for the past 3 years.  Third, if a singer is American why should her cd not be released here first?  Last night I stumbled onto a website where I watched Anastacia's new video.  You probably don't know who she is because she doesn't sell well in the States, but if you do and you enjoy her then I love you.   So the song was good.  And more importantly it's stuck in my head, which means I should listen to it to help purge it.  And that means ordering an import from some website and waiting a month, unless by chance I can find it at Tower in the village.   But it shouldn't be a question of "if";  it should just be there.    Heck, being an American in the Age of Bush should at least give me the advantage of having the damn cd I want available when I want it.  What else is the "War on Terror" if not the "War to get Americans Stuff as Cheaply as Possible by Opening Markets in and Gaining the Labor of Muslim Countries"?    Also, if you haven't heard Nellie McKay's album, "Get Away From Me" you should.  It kicks ass.    On the bright side for the first time in years I know where the Vice President is (China.  And, coincidentally, a bunch of Chinese in Iraq were kidnapped a few days ago).  Which means I have to find a new $5 question....

      Dear President Bush,  Why are you mad at Spain for pulling troops out of Iraq?  It's not like they don't have shit of their own to deal with, what with EU expansion and the challenges to its constitution by Basque and Catalan nationalists.  Plus they're still participating in your little War on Everybody- in Afghanistan.  Remember Afghanistan?  Probably not.  They didn't elect you.  Technically, nobody did.  So fuck you for thinking you have the right to dictate or criticize the choices of the Spanish people.  I try to rationalize your lies, to have fun with your obviously Hitlerian behavior (forcing countries to bow to his will was the start of something really messy- read a history book, ass).  But this is my limit.    I don't like you.  I hope you lose the election, though I know you won't because you have several important media ploys up your sleeve (troops back from Iraq, finding Osama, dropping gas prices because of your deal with Saudi Arabia) that stupid people will believe makes you great.    You're not.  Sincerely, A disgruntled voter who, coincidentally, UPS-ed a ballot from Spain in order to participate in the 2000 elections.  (Just in case- I love Bush.  Bush is God.)

      It's almost 2am on a Saturday night.  Or Sunday morning, if it works that way for you.  And rather than sitting in a bar with a nice buzz, or drifting through a nice dream while curled up in bed I'm here.  Awake.  Willing my brain to come up with something profound and revelatory so that this paper I have to write is, well, profound and revelatory.  And that's not happening, though with the amount of time I've spent on education I should have the profound flowing like wine.  Or whatever the appropriate phrase would be.  My paper and I even came to the conclusion that just finishing would be acceptable, and yet my brain still won't put out.  Shameful.

      Simple pleasures are nice.  And simple.  Which, I suppose, is why one would call them 'simple pleasures'.  I recently discovered a shop that sells Fanta.  And it's conveniently located next to the liquor store (hell, everything is conveniently located next to a liquor store around here), so I'm happily sipping on Vodka with Fanta orange.  It's like a screwdriver in theory, with the practical assistance of a Vodka-redbull (which I used to love, but lately...not so much).  Sugar and carbonation kick up the alcohol an extra notch, which is a faster path to happiness!  And I'm listening to music through nice, new headphones, since the old ones were just...fading.  They served me well, though, so I can't complain; only mourn their passing.    Which means...I have Vodka and (good, in my opinion) Music.  Because I'm in my room, I can bust out with some dancing.  And that, good friends, is my personal formula for drunkenness: Vodka, Music, Dancing.  And I'm a happy drunk, so I'm in quite a pleasant mood.  I felt like sharing that.

      Again, I must protest that my American empire brings me nothing.  And, again, it's a CD that I would like to own.  So, again, I humbly request that we work on importing the music I'd like to own and listen to.  It's only fair that we get the "exotic," is it not?  I discovered this music because my parents kick ass and sent me to Spain for a week.  Ah, Spain.  I love you.  I love "Pasapalabra," Magnum ice cream bars (Empire should bring that home, too), tinto verano...damn, I love everything.  And the place I went- outside Malaga- had a chiringuito with my name on it, literally.  Could there be a clearer sign from God that I ought to be there than to see my name all in blue neon with the word "Bar" in front of it?  I think not.    Nonetheless I'm back in New York.  New York, where the cabbie almost killed me on the way back from the airport by nearly hitting (narrowly missing?) the median on the freeway.  I think the damn city gave me allergies, too, since my first week back I was all sniffly upon exiting the house, which never happened before.  But really, I'm not down with NY right now because it's where I'm obligated to be.  I have to finish this stupid program, get my degree, and run away.  To earn money and pay back my loans.  And all that other stuff that connotes "adulthood" that I'm not totally enthused with at the moment.  Oh- politics.  I almost forgot the politics.  Now there's a "credible" threat for a summer attack in the US.  What bullshit.  Bush is in trouble because our mercenaries (sorry..."Halliburton" and other "corporations" helping us fight wars) are beating the crap out of prisoners, and now there's suddenly a "credible" threat?  Not to mention the uproar over gas prices, and the "American Idol" voting controversies (our priorities are amazing, are they not?- lest you think I think I'm better than you, I'm watching the AI finale right now, not that I like either of the finalists) and it's the PERFECT time for a "credible" threat as a distraction.  Fuck that- I don't believe you, American government.  Especially not you, Democrats.  Y'all always go along with this shit (except Byrd, I wish more politicians were like him...but then, most have careers and futures to think about, and he...he's guarding a legacy)- Republicans almost overthrew Clinton for a blow-job and you've done jack with war for profit.  Just in case- I love Bush, yay Bush.  You're my hero and when I grow up I want to be you (only, y'know, I'll work the empire better than you have- which is your only flaw, don't get me wrong I love you).

      Lesson of the Week: Order one CD from Germany and get a shitload of spam.  In German.  Other Lesson of the Week: With legal defintions of torture in continual flux, it must be an awesome time to be a psychopath.  Like a Renaissance of sorts, since you could come up with totally off-the-wall, evil stuff and it might not be degrading enough to actually count as evil stuff.    Other Other Lesson of the Week: Even with serious political scandals involving outting CIA operatives and violating international treaties- scandals emerging during an election year, no less- the media choose to focus on Bill Clinton and his penis.  Where did his penis really go?  What happened when he told his wife what his penis did?  It's all so important... maybe the NY Times ought to run a front-page review of his memoirs.  Oh wait, they totally did even after apologizing for being weak-minded, lazy schmucks before the Iraq war.  I guess our priorities are in order.  Just not an order where we, like, put the critical issues at the top.    And that's really my problem here.  It's cool if we collectively decide that it's ok to torture; or that's it's ok to lie and manipulate language even though you promised to be an honest, plain-talkin' President (example: contacts between Iraq and al-Qaeda no longer mean actual contacts; just meetings).  But we haven't made those decisions yet because we haven't really talked about them.  We're still stuck on Clinton's penis.    Also irritating: we spent a week flying a corpse from coast to coast, worshipping it as though a god had died.  Let's get some perspective here.  Reagan supported the Taliban because it was fighting the Soviets, and he supported Saddam Hussein because Iraq was battling Iran.  He sure as hell didn't do anything to stop either of them when they were in their incipient, easier-to-defeat forms.  So basically the major problems we're currently facing- the ones with armies and deaths and bombs, at any rate- were caused by a man we just spend millions of dollars to bury.  I can't be the only one bothered by that.  And I can't be the only one who wishes the media would have picked up on that.  And I can't help but wonder if Bill Clinton and his penis will get the same treatment some day down the line.  That'll be the ultimate test of American ideals, won't it?  We can forgive/forget Iran-Contra, breaking unions, firing air traffic controllers.  If we can't forgive/forget what Clinton and his penis did...that'd be sad.

      A month ago while I was in Spain I had the pleasure of discovering a German girl band named Vanilla Ninja.  Now, after much waiting, I have their cd.  And I'm in love.    First off, the name of the group is "Vanilla Ninja."  Which, seriously, is the most kick-ass name for a group I've heard of in a long, long time.    Secondly, they play instruments.  Guitars, drums- and they do it well.  Third, they sound like they're straight out the 1980s.  Sort of like The Go Gos, sort of like The Bangles, but sort of not.  It's awesome.    Ok, so there are a couple lame songs on the album but that's to be expected as all albums have at least one crappy track.  But mostly they're fun and good.  One could say they're good fun.    Vanilla Ninja- try it out!

      Dear President Bush,  One of the most basic definitions of "sovereignty" is a monopoly on the legitimate use of force within a given territory.  So, for example, Germany can't legitimately send troops to patrol Los Angeles, because Los Angeles is part of the United States, a sovereign country.  Which is to say, when you argue that you've transferred "sovereignty" to Iraq even though American troops can still do whatever the fuck they want to, you're wrong.  And it's not even like you were almost right about this.  Just full-on, no-holds-barred wrong.  Sad thing is, people might actually believe something meaningful has happened in Iraq and the war, officially over months ago, is no even more officially completed.    Sincerely, An Irritated Citizen.  PS- Just kidding!  If you want to redefine "sovereignty" to mean, well, whatever exactly it means in Iraq, that's cool.  You rock and I love you, so go right ahead.  Plus, you've already brought freedom and democracy to Iraq by constructing and establishing a government that was not elected, so I guess the actual definition of words (democracy; sovereignty) is a moot point.

      Today's a good day.  I woke up and my friend left a text message wishing me a happy birthday.  I check my voicemail, and my Grandma sang me "Happy Birthday" like she's done every year as far back as I can remember.  Then, I go online to this message board I post at and people are wishing me a good day there, too.  People I don't know in person, whose real names and identities are shrouded in mystery.    I feel so loved!  It's awesome!  Also, they opened a smoothie place nearby as part of that evil thing called "gentrification."  So I get to have a real smoothie for the first time in months.  How much ass does that kick?

      Oh, politics!  Why hast thou foresaken me?      I've been thinking about this whole Bush vs. Kerry thing.   See, once upon a time I thought I would always vote ideologically, finding the candidate who best represented my perspective on the world around me.  But with this election...I guess I wasn't cynical enough to expect this particularly bad situation (what with the wars and homophobia and all), which is sad because I've always had a healthy cynical outlook.      I could never vote for Bush.  Ever.  And I'm quickly losing respect for people who plan to do so, considering that many of them were morally outraged by Clinton's lies but seem ok with the ones told by Bush.  I'm also confused as to why people are forgetting Bush's self-description as a "uniter" and his pledge to bring civility and class back to the White House.  Which his people have totally done.  I mean, Cheney telling a political opponent to "go fuck himself" is damn classy, as is Rumsfeld's obvious contempt for Congress.      And Kerry...Kerry was in Vietnam, which I suppose I have to respect.  I do respect it, but I don't get why it makes him better.  Maybe this week at the Convention he'll lay out a clear plan, explaining why he'd be better at fighting the "War on Terror."  And the war in Iraq.  And Afghanistan.  And I'd love to hear him explain why we shouldn't send troops to Sudan, seeing as those people are suffering at least as much as Iraqis did under Saddam (cause we fought there to bring freedom, right?).    Kerry's wife scares me, too, since on that "60 Minutes" interview she explained switching parties as a response to Republican disrespect for one man.  That implies that she's still ideologically Republican, which would be cool if she were a Laura Bush robotic/invisible kind of woman.  But she's not, and I don't know what kind of crap she'll pimp as First Lady.  Heck, I don't know what kind of crap her husband's going to pimp.      Which leads me to a thought: let's ditch the whole President thing.  The real power lies with the Cabinet, anyway, and the President just signs things.  That's the impression I get from Bush, at any rate, who hasn't taken responsibility for a damn thing, unless it's positive.  So let's directly elect Cabinet members.      Yes, it would mean very messy elections, unless we stagger them correctly so as to minimize the number of concurrent campaigns while not creating non-stop elections.   But the benefit would be that we could have a mixed government, which seems more democratic given the ideological split of the nation.  It would also mean parties would have to more clearly explain their positions in very specific policy areas, and everything would be broken down into easily-digestible pieces for voters.      In my fantasy world we'd even get a wider variety of perspectives expressed in government.  We'd end this centrist bullshit currently spewed by the only two viable political parties because candidates would have to articulate something.  They would have to have an actual idea instead of hovering around the middle position of nothing because gaining power would be predicated on differentiating yourself from other candidates by expressing an actual idea.  You'd have to be for or against something, voters would have to make choices and set priorities...God, it'd be Heaven.    Would it really?  Would voting for cabinet members directly even create functional government?  I don't care.  All I want is to vote without invoking the "lesser of two evils" clause, or the even worse "Anybody But Bush" phrase.  Is that so wrong?    Eh.  Random 3:30am thoughts.  Gotta love 'em!
