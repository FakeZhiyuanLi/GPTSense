      Yeah, I know, silly title. But hey, it feels good to finally get the plasters off. I haven't seen 4 parts of my knees (2 on each) in ages. The doctor just got some tweasers, and without saying anything, just ripped them off. He was just silent. I was writhing in pain, and he just continued! I had one stitch on each on the four holes that were made for the op. He used the tweasers to pull it up, then cut it off. Wasn't as painful as the plasters, but still hurt. The holes that were made were pretty small. They look like crosses, since the skin hasn't closed up yet, and it kinda seems as if I've gone and sliced it with a knife. No sport till I next seem him: 26 September. So that'll be a few weeks of school without having to do PE or Games...yay!!

      I know I haven't posted anything for the last few days, so this may be a bit long.  Received PC Format today. They gave Doom 3 90%, which surprised me since I thought it would have got at least 95%. From the small amount I've played, it was incredible, and probably the most terrifying game I have ever experienced. I lost count of the number of times I jumped with the first hour of playing! The review said, to kinda round it off: "Doom is as Doom does. Gorgeous and horrifying but also dumb and repetitive." I can almost guarantee that they'll give Half-Life 2 a higher rating and better review. Not that I think that's wrong, because I don't know if it will be, but they absolutely love Half-Life (1) and can't seem to get over it, so the review might be unprofessional bias.  Whilst I'm here, I thought I might advertise a few things.  Firstly, most people I know use MSN Messenger. And we all want to be able to use it at school. However, there can be many obstacles. For example, your school may not let you download it and/or install it. Or even if they let you install it, it won't work. Well, now there's an official answer. Ok, granted there are already some web-based messengers around,  urlLink e-messenger  and  urlLink Piglet-IM  to name two, but these, to be honest, and pretty crap. e-messenger's the better out of the two, but very insecure and buggy. Piglet-IM barely ever works. But may I introduce to use  urlLink MSN WEB MESSENGER . Now this is excellent. You can use messenger without installing ANYTHING (like the other 2), but it looks practically the same as the normal messenger. It's attractive and does the job nicely. Still only in beta stages, it limits the number of people who can use it. The Final version is supposed to be out later this year, but even at beta it seems to work nicely.  In other "news", my knees are doing ok. The right knee became extremely swollen last week, so I went to see my doctor. He said I had suffered some internal bleeding where it had gone very black (you could see this dark patch on my skin). It seems to have got better, with the swelling going down. On the other hand, the left knee looks like it has bled internally, so it's basically going through the same stuff the right knee did. Fortunately (or unfortunately) it's supposed to get better within a few weeks, i.e. before school starts.

      Haven't done much today. Just been trying to bring my PC up to scratch after the install of XP on my new hard drive. I've now installed XP Home Edition 7 times on 5 different hardware specs, and it's activated successfully everytime! Very unusual, but hey, who's complaining?!  Sven's staying. Er...well, duh! He costs way too much to get rid of over some personal problems. Instead of worrying about how he sucks with women, why not analyse how he sucks with footy?? I mean, don't get me wrong, he is a good manager and all, but if his personal life is not actually effecting how he manages his team, then what's the problem. What the really should do is give him an ultimatum. "England must successfully qualify for World Cup 2006, or your out Sven!" Of course, they could be harsher...

      Finally, both operations are complete, so no more visitin the hospital! I spoke to my doctor about the extreme pain in my right-knee (the first one I did), and he said it was absolutely normal to feel pain after the bandage had been removed. It was good to here this, because it meant nothing else was wrong. Once again, the anaesthetic kicked in very fast. I was expected it, so as soon as they injected it into me, I said "see you later" to my dad, and that's the last thing I remember. I woke up with it complete. There was also a bandage on my right-knee, which has really helped to reduce the pain. I'm finding it very tiring to walk, since neither of my knees can take much weight. I have to use my arms to carry all my weight when using the crutches: not pleasant!  I'm glad it's over now. Going to the toilet is the hardest part!  I feel I'm recovering pretty well, and my doctor agrees (well, I agree with him).  Just for general knowledge, the operation was called a  knee arthroscopy .  In other "news", I received my new Micro$oft 5-button mouse, DVDR discs and 80GB hard drive (I'm giving my current 60GB hard drive and Micro$oft 3-button mouse to my brothers, Neil &amp; Nikhil). I also received the next 4 issues, issues 16-19, of Nitro Racer: the fuel-power remote control car I am building. For more info on this, check out their (crappy)  urlLink website.   Well, thanks for reading.

      Well this is the first entry of a hopefully well-updated blog. Before I say anything else, please realise I can't be too revealing (with family members possible reading this!).  The blog could disappear or stop being updated at any time, so be warned! (Although it shouldn't affect your normal lifestyle too much)  Tomorrow's my second op. This time on the left knee. My right knee still pretty painful, a badly swollen, but apparently the swelling is 3 times as bad for some. I can't really walk properly, so I'm gonna have real problems tomorrow! Hopefully the crutches will be good enough.  This is me signing out for the first time.
