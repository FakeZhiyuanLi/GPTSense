      I really feel like I'm pushing the barrier of sanity. I've been ultra vunerable to just about everything. Not to mention hightly reclusive and overwhelmingly fearful of even the simplest things. I really need a space where I can just write and not have to worry about which "friends" are going to see this and what drama this might bring on. But at the same time, I don't want write all this out if no one is going to read it. It's the internet equivalent of sitting in a dark, closed off room and talking to yourself. When people walk the streets of downtown and mumble random jargon to themselves, other people still hear it, even if it isn't being directed at them.  This weekend was supposed to be my trip of a lifetime. Except, not quite so profound.  I am supposed to be going to San Francisco with Vanessa, her mother and David. I am seventeen and I have never really been outside of San Diego County. Sure, I've been to Disneyland, Universal Studios and Six Flags, but I don't consider that to be 'getting out.' The amusement park would be no different if it had been built in my own backyard. I really want to just go. To wander, observe, and see something else. But it doesn't look like this is going to be the summer. No, I'm too busy working. My intern at Scripps is just so important to everything in my life. If I were to take 4 days off, every college and future employer would be sure to make note of it and never think twice about accepting me. Clearly!  At the same time, I'm not sure that I really want to go with Vanessa and David anyway. Like I've told a few people already, they're good people; they just don't interest me. Maybe it's better that I wait until I have the freedom to go with whomever I choose, to stay how ever long and truely enjoy it with people I truely enjoy being with. I feel horrible typing out the last 10 or so words of the last sentence, but it's true. I just want to leave on a good note.

      Karl leaves tomorrow morning. He stopped by the house last night to say bye. He was here for serioiusly about 2 minutes, and my parents flipped out. I remember my dad saying "Don't ask me to do that" when I asked him if I could go to the park with him and some other people. I don't exactly know what "that" means. Is he talking about drugs? or does he think we were going to have sex?? I really don't know. But it kills me to think that my parents are so judgemental of me. I feel like they know me, but they don't care to understand me.  I hate the way he always comments on my weight. He KNOWS it upsets me. I've shown it, physically and verbally, many times and yet he keeps doing it. I've even tried to go and throw up my dinners. I've skipped meals, and felt fat and nasty after I do eat. He says that "being a big girl is a good thing and that I should just find a wimpy skinny man that I can push around." UHHHH...SORRY. That's not quite my idea of a healthy relationship. Or a relationship at all. Right now, a relationship is the last thing I want. I'd feel bad dedicating myself and expecting someone else to dedicate themself to me. I'm only in it for the chase. I'll take my guys like I take my drugs. Once in a while and only for the thrill and be glad when it's gone the next morning.  [Retarded feeling about guys...I really hope no one reads this.] Karl - I always used to get mad at him. Once, I told him he was over rated. I meant it in the sense that everyone would quote him and just thought he was an extrodinary guy. He was, in a sense. I was just made jealous one to many times by him or something he did. I remember being in a car with Michelle and she was saying that she kind of liked Karl. I told her "Yeah, he's a pretty cool guy, that I understood where she was coming from." She went on to talk about a time she had gone to a party-ish thing and fell asleep in Karl's arms as they talked about how neither really wanted a relationship. Boy! Did that shut me up on the subject. There was another time when her and Sarai were talking about how Karl kept trying to flirt with them/instigate things and how they hated it. I would have given anything for Karl to try and pull something like that with me. I couldn't understand why he didn't like me. It was just me being jealous, but I'd get mad at him. Steve - So, my parents thought it was a little odd that I'd be going to a show with my 'best friends' ex boyfriend. Understandable. I don't really know when it started. I remember liking Steve (sorta) a lonnnnng time ago. Before him and Laura went out. I remember talking to Laura and telling her how "yeah, I like him, you like him...a lot of people do. Don't go out with him, it's for the best." And then..they ended up going out, so I forgot all about it. I'd talk to Steve all the time, online, in class, at school. We'd always joke around. When they finally broke up, I was so glad. When I checked my voicemail that one morning, and heard him saying "I'm having a little party tonight" I got really excited. Then, when I called him back and heard that girl on his voicemail, I thought to myself, "who the hell was that??? I don't want to call him back anymore..." (I still don't know who it is...) Steve drove me home from his shindig and I remember feeling good, talking, driving in his car late at night. So I brought up going to the show. He said he wanted to. We went, we joked around, I had a lot of fun, he said he did too. But after that night, I just thought "I don't like Steve. We're friends, I appriciate his friendship a lot." And then, I didn't want to talk to Brendan either, because I thought I'd feel the same way. Last week, I was sitting at work playing computer games, and I thought about how I went to his house instead of standing in the physical line, and how Emma called and Steve goes "yeah, we're real busy right now." What if we were busy? The idea of being scandelous and doing something that everyone else would look down upon felt so good. I imagined that me and Steve were hanging out at a football game during the beautiful fall season, and we just left. I imagined that I kissed him, and it sent that feeling of pure ecstasy throughout my whole body. When I thought about it later, I felt nothing.  I look at myself as being taller (and I guess skinnier) than I actually am. I always wonder why guys aren't attracted to me as anything more than a friend. Is it because of they way I look? I never thought of myself as fat or ugly...but maybe I have the opposite of bulimia. I know I used to (maybe still do) have what they called tenchillamania. That's completely not what it is. But it's basically where you pull out your hair for the tension relief sensation. It's classified as obsesive-compulsive. Somewhat of a self mutilation. A less dangerous form of cutting, I suppose. It says it should be treated by a psychologist or pshciartist...but I haven't gone, and I don't think I intent to.  Joe called yesterday, probably when I was playing piano and not answering my phone. I would check my email everyday so see if he had replied yet...but he was out of town. In PA (whatever that is.) I think I have a problem where I have trouble showing emotion. Joe casually says "love you" at the end of his phone calls, and "send my love to Mom and Laura" in email. But I never do. Today when we were leaving from visiting the "ancestors," I stood near the door and said good-bye. My aunt Judy (who doesn't walk around much because she had polio when she was younger and it affected her leg) stood up and said " Juli " with a slight tinge of...I don't know. And then she said "come here!" and she had a smile, so I came over, and gave her a hug. If it were up to me, I probably would have remained where I stood, said bye, give a scanty wave and walk away with my head down.  Well, I feel a lot better now that I've got that all jotted down. I feel like, I really want to show this to someone. I really really really want just a good friend. One that's like me. That makes plans and follows through with them, or at least gives you a decent reason as to why they're not. Someone who likes being spontaneous and isn't judgemental. Who will do things that wouldn't be accepted by most. Who can appriciate a secret for what it is. Who would read this and understand without brining it up and wanting to talk about it. I regret telling Vanessa what I told her on the beach that one night. I know she won't tell anyone else, but still. I feel like I'm growing more and more distant from her all the time. Sitting in the car with her family made me realize the kind of person she is. Uptight. She's a good person, fun (usually) but just not the kind of person I want to spend ALL my time with. I  think  I understand what was going through Alex's head last year. I think it's kinda of like with James. Sometimes, I joke around and have fun...other times, he just annoys me. The things he says, the way he acts, his lack of definition and utter carelessness at times. I avoid him for no reason, but then get upset when he doesn't come around. Now that I  think  I understand what Alex was thinking, I can appriciate him a little more. So much for a conclusion
