      I have packed my suitcase already which is good, now I am just trying to remember everything else I need to do before I go.  Glad to hear Liz will be coming out next Saturday to visit, otherwise I would be bored as hell, as I am not the type to go out and explore on my own. And hanging out with coworkers who I have had to work and live with this next week, is not my idea of a fantastic time.  I definitely need me time.  I have discovered why I actually enjoy my work is because I am alone a lot and I like that.  It's when I have to deal with people too much that I start to get annoyed.    So on my quest for happiness, (I find this an interesting concept as most goth's I have run into like the sad and dark side of life more) I need to start appreciating what I have.  I am an individual who always keeps thinking of getting to the next step or the next day or the next whatever and not enjoying or appreciating what I have right now.  I did this a lot in my 20's and I can't really remember what it was I was searching for back then.  However I did meet Satan in my 20's which was unexpected as I didn't plan on meeting my future husband on vacation the way I did, however, that worked out well, and I wasn't searching for him.  So that could be the answer to my quest, stop searching and start enjoying what I have.    This is how I will be looking at the next week, stop wishing it to be over already and enjoy and learn from the experience, as if this is the career path I want to do, I might as well enjoy the journey.  So as my blog says I am on that Bridge to Nowhere and when I cross it, will I be happy that I got there or will the journey across it be the most interesting part of it.  Ok I think I woke up this morning being too much in my head........

      So my plans today have changed.  I had one of my appointments cancel on me, which I don't mind as I didn't want to drive all the way to the city today for a half hour appt. But now I am so unmotivated to do anything.  This is so my problem.  I could sit and watch TV all day, but what a waste of a day. Especially when I have so much crap I need to do before I leave on Sunday for training.  So I am going climbing today with Satan, unless he calls and says he doesn't feel like it and is coming home early.  It would just be my luck.  As I need to get some climbing in, as I won't be able to climb while I  am at training.    Well I did put a load of laundry in, so at least my clothes will be clean before I leave. I did walk the dogs today too.   And Satan told me I coddle my youngest dog too much, and now she is a wuss.  Can't help it, she is just so damn cute and needs hugs, and she likes hugs.  But she follows me around all the time now, which I don't mind, but I think Satan may feel like the dog is not paying enough attention to him.  As she used to follow him everywhere when she was a puppy.  But I am sure the roles will reverse when I leave on Sunday, and when I am back in a week and 1/2, she will give me the cold shoulder.    So I am obsessing over the dogs while I will be away.  Not Satan, I know he can take care of himself, its just my darling girls I will miss.  I keep telling Satan he needs to talk to them and do stupid things with them like I do while I am gone so they won't feel abandoned.  He said anarchy will happen while I am gone, and they will all be living the life...  Most amusing.  So anyway, back to my original rambling,,, I get side tracked a lot, its pre alsheimers, I just know it.... Anyway I am canceling the other meeting I had today which is the one for the school. Again, don't want to drive all that way for that, and I can reschedule, so when I call to cancel I will rebook for when I am back, as not to pass this opportunity by.  As when I spoke to Satan about it last night he thought it was a good idea to check into it as well.  Ok, must get motivated to do something.......

      So I am finally going to get my esthetics license.  How long has it taken me to figure out what I want to do when I grow up.   I went to talk to a school today and will probably enroll in the next couple of weeks.  As they do parttime classes which would work for me, as I still have to work full time to pay for it.  But it will nice to finally be free of a "boss"  and have just me to deal with.  Although, dealing with myself can be quite trying sometimes.    I find that I obsess about getting older, and to think that I am looking down  the road at the big 4...0 in the next couple of years has me wondering what there is to my life, and what have I done with it that I have been happy with.    I remember when I turned 30 I just obsessed that I was 30, but now that 40 is on it's way I am looking back to see what I have done with my life and where do I want to go with it??      So this will be an adventure in finding out what I am all about I guess, as that vampire didn't come along at 25 to give me eternal youth, that I was really hoping on, but now I will have to find it on my own.   I think I am on a quest for eternal youth and eternal happiness.  It has to be out there.....And I will find it DAMN IT!!

      So here I sit and ponder the first blog.  I am no longer a blog virgin.  but will there be anyone out there to experience the joy of it??  So nothing to report,  my first blog and I am already boring myself..this is pretty sad.  So how did I get here, and where am I supposed to go??  That is my never ending question..  What am I supposed to do with this life?  And how many of these lifetimes have I already lived?   So many questions.....Ok my brain hurts so I think it is off to do something extraordinary....like sleep.

      Ok, so now I am packed, suitcase is in car, and now my mind is racing a mile o minute thinking I have forgotten something, and then thinking, should I bring two cases instead of one, as the one is full and rather heavy.  Will I be getting more crap to bring back with me, and then am I going to need another bag to bring back with me.  Will this obsessesive compulsive behavior ever stop??  AAAHHHHHH!!!  Ok, just breathe, it will be fine, and if I have forgotten something it isn't like I am going to another planet (although LA is out there), where I wouldn't be able to find the same crap as I have here at home.  OK, I am fine now, these panic attacks are at least getting shorter.  Well hopefully I will come back fully enlightened on this new career path I have chosen and full of enthusiasm to get out there and actually do something.....we shall see.....

      Today was a total me girl day.  I went and got my hair colored, way to many grey hairs showing too mention, then off to get my manicure.  It was great.  Too bad work gets in the way as I have a conference call at 4pm today.  Why I ask you on a Friday, don't they know I have my own stuff to do.....  Nothing else to blog about, but I am so ready for the weekend, I think I may just sleep starting right after the conference call, but more likely, I will be sleeping before I get off the call as they are usually so boring and other people decide to rant way to long on these things, don't they know we don't want to hear about their problems, so why don't they just call our manager for some one on one time, and don't drag us into their problems.  What the fuck it's 4 fuckin o'clock on Friday, do we really care?????????????????????????????????

      I can't believe I am finally back from my 10 training in LA.  That was the longest fuckin 10 days of my life.  Thank god Liz came down for the weekend or I think I would have gone mad.  However this past week and a half felt like a real world episode, as the 5 other people I had to be with for the full trip were so completely different from each other. And of course I was singled out as the "weird" Goth chick.  I was definitely the "Frankie" of this group.  There was the "normal" one of the bunch who was a mom from Reno (although she had some Reno mall hair happening), then we had the over 40 divorced single mom ( who looked like the chick who was the mom on who's the boss) who was "sweet and innocent" on the outside. But there was a raving party girl in there once she had a couple of drinks, then there was the southern bell who was the prima donna of the group, as this was her trip, and we were mere servants to wait on her hand and foot.  Then we had the anorexic who we never saw eat as she would disappear at lunch time and never came out with us for dinner.  However the two times she did come out with us and she ate, she then spent about 20 minutes in the bathroom right after the meal, and she was always cold and wore a coat (even when the air conditioning was out and we were all feeling like we were in a sauna). Then last but not least we had "I want One" girl, who came for the last week of training, and everything I had she had to make sure she got one too.  Even down to the flipping welcome bag that was just for us new hires ( she wasn't one she was there for retraining), and she was like living with a nervous rodent.  So needless to say, I am so glad to be back in the realms of my own psychoness.  However the training I got was really good, and made me really want to pursue this new career path I have chosen.  So knowing that, I was able to survive my real world cast for the last 10 days.  However, I know if it was a "real world" series I would have been the one to go mental on someone.  Probably either the southern bell, as I was getting sick of her shit, or it would have been the "I want one" rodent girl, as she was just a freak.

      I am having a slow start to Saturday, but since the last couple of days have been slow starts I guess I just need to role with it. Thanks again Liz for helping me out with my links last night, I am very low tech (unlike Jen, she is high tech, baby) with computers, sometimes I need help trying to figure out how to turn it on!  Anyway, so far I have checked my $$ in my checking account, so now I am staling to pay the bills. It is nice to see the amount in my checking, so why make me sad by writing bills now..... As the mortgage is due on this cycle o' bills.    Oh and I  gave myself a mini facial this morning which was quite nice.  I do need to find a good facialist here in the bay area, as I think flying to LA once a month to get one is going to be a bit hard on the check book, and one expensive facial in the long run.    Well, it sounds like the girls are getting restless and need to have their ball thrown for them, as Satan is still asleep....but not for long as I am going to go wake his ass up, which should not be a pretty sight, as waking up Satan is usually not a good thing.........but what the hell, I am up for a good laugh!!!!!!!!!Wish me luck!!!

      I knew my good day yesterday (see previous blog) would only be for one day.  Today I awoke to monster cramps!  And they are still here, 3 hours later!! I have taken the exceeded amount of ibuprofin and I have a heating pad on as we blog and alas they are still here, if there is anyone out there that has a remedy for mondo cramps, do tell!! Also from the fab climbing I did yesterday, my left arm is now sore and I can't lift it more than boob height.    However I did wake this morning in a spoon sandwich!  Satan was angelicly sleeping (he only looks this way when he sleeps) spooning me, and I was spooning my littlest pup ( she was on top of the covers, sorry no beastiality here).  If only the cramps weren't around, I could have enjoyed it more.    It looks as though today is going to be another late start, but hey, at least it's Friday!!

      I actually had a pretty good day today, they actually do come along once in awhile so here are some  highlights:  1. I actually got carded at beverages and more!!  Not a big deal to some, but since I haven't gotten carded in ages this was a major happy moment!!  2. This woman at one of the accounts I went to today said I looked like the chick from Evanecense (don't know how to spell it).  Not a bad comparison, as she is probably 16 years younger than me and she has really cool hair!  3. I went to the climbing gym today and had a ton of energy and climbed really well!!  I actually made it up all the climbs I attempted!!  4. I was late getting to work, but then realized I don't have a boss watching over me, so no one knew I was late!!  5. On the way home I realized it's Friday tomorrow and its pay day!!  so lets all hope that tomorrow isn't pay back for an actual pretty good day!  But how could it, it's Friday tomorrow after all.....................

      I was going to write this blog last night, however Satan decided to interrupt my blogging as he needed help. Men.  Don't they understand about surfing the blog sites??  Anyway,,,yesterday I went to an education class at work where salons can also attend.  I was looking forward to the class as it was going to be a good business coarse for me to help get my business up and running,  well, it was going pretty well until this old bitch of a woman decides to become the heckler of the class and start questioning everything the instructor is trying to tell us,, and then in the middle of the class the old bitch says to the instructor," I have been in this business for 20 years, how long have you been in this business because I could tell you a thing or two!"  Alright psycho bitch if you have been in this business for 20 years, what the fuck are you doing in a basic business coarse??  Obviously you haven't been very successful or you would be the one running this class!!  So of course because of her bitching and complaining the whole way through the class gets out late, and then she had the nerve to leave early because she had an appointment she couldn't miss, well bitch if you had kept your trap shut we all would have been able to leave early, but because of you we are all late!!  So I will probably take the class again as the last part was so rushed to get us out of the class as close to on time as the instructor could, but that is just fucked up.  We all had to suffer because of psycho bitch hating her life.    Why do people do that??  I just don't understand why other people love to squash others with their own horrid miserable life and experiences.   They can't be happy at all for anyone.   She reminded me of some of the old hags I used to work with on the makeup counters.  And I vowed to get out before I ever turned into one of them.  And thank god I did!!   As the Black Eyed Peas say, Where is the love??

      My dogs are nut cases.  But I love my little nut cases.  Ghost loves puppies,   our next door neighbor has two new lab puppies, and so she went hysterical over them.  High pitch howling ( she is part husky part wolf) at them all wagging her tail, well, did they think she was running over to say hi? No, they go running off all scared as this looney tunes dog comes running at them.  Oh ghostie, nobody understands you are too over the top when it comes to puppies.  She followed little willow around ( the youngest girl) like she was the best thing ever when we first  got her until she got out of her cute puppy stage.  Now she looks at her, and then looks at me longingly like she is saying, "can we please trade her in for a new puppy"??  Ghost has yet to see the new puppies down the road as there are about 7 of them, if she did I don't think I could ever get her home from our walk, she would have her head plastered at the fence just looking at them all day.   However my poor Ghostie is just misunderstood as everyone we pass by thinks she is scary.  Which is good when you are on a walk with her and there is a creepy guy near by.   But nobody understands how sweet she really is. Until she becomes the stealth bird murderer......

      So I should be working, and I have been trying to, however, the I.T. Department at my work are not very friendly or helpful, so as I can't view my work email, here I am to blog away...  The summer solstice is here, so I have tried to celebrate it today, I lit my solstice incense this morning, and nearly smoked out my house.  So hopefully in doing so I have also cleansed any bad energy that has been hanging out in the house from spring.  My sister called yesterday to say happy summer solstice and when I said it is tomorrow, she nearly bit my head off, (which I know is hard to do over the phone, but you don't know my sister as she is capable of this)  so I don't know if she was in the right "happy solstice" mood that she thought she was.  I know that it started at sundown, but she was so about being the all knowing one of the festivities that she threw into a rage.   So note to self when someone calls to wish a happy anything I will just be courteous and say thanks.    So to celebrate today, I thought I would do a "light" work day and put work in where it fits today.  AS I tried with the I.T. guy, ( I don't think he was having a nice solstice day either.) so I did take my dogs on a nice walk this morning and I actually came home and exercised too!!!  I then called my boss for our 30 min. Monday call, and then I called the I.T. guy, which I should have taken a break before calling the guy, as the "light" work day should of had a break between the boss and I.T.  Now I understand this, so I am taking a longer break now to make up for the one I didn't take earlier.  I am now going to be working for about 20 minutes each hour which should be just about right.  And if I need to shorten that, so be it.  How to Celebrate the Solstice: Now looking at my Wiccan recipes, ritual and lore book, it says to banish all sorrows it says to place my woes into a small bag of lavender.  Hmm, will they all fit into a small bag is what I am wondering.  Other traditions it says is to dry herbs, blueprint leaves, leave out food for the faeries who prevail throughout the season ( but will the evil squirrels pillage the faerie food before they get to it), search for a walking stick (oh, I did that one), and weave a God's eye.....hmm, this may take more time than I thought, maybe work will just have to go away today.  Ok, this seems like today is going to be an Official VampyreGirl holiday, so I better start the celebrating now and  cancel work.....

      It's Saturday morning, no alarm clocks to wake me up, I can sleep in as long as I want  so I am sleeping zzzzzz...zzzzz...Then all of a sudden I have this searing pain ripping through my right nipple like it is being torn off, no its not Satan feeling horny, but my youngest dog standing with full force on my nipple...and she just stands there wagging her tail, wondering what I am shrieking about,, Satan rolls over and wants to know why I am screaming, as I am in so much pain I can't even get the dog off of me, and I can barely say the words,, dog,,,standing....on....nipple,,,,help...me....!!!!  So finally he gets the dog off of me, and I think if I look down there will be this deflated breast, but no it is fine, just red, but fine...  So off to sleep I go again, this time I roll on to my stomach to make sure I am not stepped on again.  My face is facing my dresser drawers, and off I go to the sleep zone again,,,,,,zzzzzzz.zzzzz....zzzzz....ok, what was that, did I just get kicked in the mouth?  I must be dreaming,,,, wait there it is again, and this time I feel like it has drawn blood, what the fuck,,, my dog has jumped back up on the bed, this time she is sound asleep but her back end is facing me and she is having a dream, and her back foot is hitting me square in the mouth...what is it with this dog?  Did I forget to feed her?  Did I not play with her enough??  Where is this coming from?  So now I am wide awake with a boob that feels like the size of a watermelon, and my mouth feels like I was just punched by a prize fighter.  Only I can have a morning like this, especially on a Saturday at 8 in the morning.    However, I have recovered since this mornings attack.  My boob is much better, and my mouth didn't swell up as I was expecting it, but will this little incident keep me from having my dog on the bed with me.  Probably not.  Why because I am a sucker for her cute little face when she looks up at me wanting a snuggle on the bed.

      Big HUGE fabulous Cosmic Love.    It has a nice ring to it.  I heard someone say that yesterday as they were talking about finding the type of love they want.  So I started to think how much we obsess about love.  Websters Dictionary describes love as: an intense affectionate concern for another person, an intense sexual desire for another person, a strong fondness or enthusiasm for something, a beloved person, often used as a term of endearment.  We also tend to take love for granted, and don't realize how much we are loved, until it disappears, then we are on that obsessive cycle again looking for it, longing for it, then we find it again, and then try and measure it like its not the love we were looking for, but its love, but then its not good enough love, we wanted something more than this love, but its still love.  And then we take it for granted and the cycle starts again.  I myself over the last year have not been taking love for granted anymore.  The most precious love you can have is with your mother, and my mother passed away last year, and the loss of that love was devastating.  That love I will never find again.  However it got me to seeing all the love that there is around me and how I need to appreciate it, and value it, because I will never know when it will leave again.  So yesterday when I heard big huge fabulous cosmic love, I straight away thought of my husband, and I am thankful he is in my life, and though we are not the over the top mushy couple, I know this is how he feels about me as well.  We don't have to say it to each other, its just a feeling, a look, a smile, a laugh, and even a tear that lets us know that the big huge fabulous cosmic love is here with us.  But love does come in many forms, the unconditional love that my dogs have towards me and I towards them, the love I have for my sisters,  the love I have for my friends, or just the shear fact of loving that it is Friday.  So if anyone is reading this, think of someone you love today, and don't for one second take them for granted, as one day that love will be gone, so make sure to create memories you will want to cherish, as those are the memories that will get you through the days when you need them the most.  I miss my mother everyday, but it is the memories of her love that keep me going.  She would be 69 years old this month, so happy birthday to you mum where ever your soul is flying free, I still love you and hope where you are you are surrounded by all the love you gave while you were here on this earthly plane.  As that definitely will be mega huge galaxy love!

      So happy it is friday tomorrow!!  So happy I don't have to get up early for another meeting tomorrow!!  Luckily management has taken pitty on us slaves to the grind that our conference call is at 9am tomorrow and not 4pm, so at least I can still be in bed for this one....   Went Sephora crazy today, went up and down every isle and tried nearly everything...there was this cute "boy" that was working there that kept asking if I needed any help, I say "boy", as if he was 18 and a day I would be amazed.  And he was wearing the makeup too, so it made him look more cherub like.  I was in there so long, I think cherub boy was about to start asking me about the products!!  So after my Sephora shopping spree ($120),  I then procceed to buy yet more makeup at Cosmoprof (this is a wholesale store for cosmotologists).  I couldn't help it.  Sebastian's Trucco has there  new fall colors out, and they have a really cool purple eyeshadow and a new liquid liner.    So in between my shopping festivities, I really did work.  I had two meetings today with two of my accounts which went well.  And to end today, I also went climbing with Satan.  He was late getting to the gym tonight, so we climbed fast for an hour, as we needed to get home to feed the girls, as they are so upset if we are late getting home and their dinner is late.  Ghost (the husky/wolf) can be heard from the drive way howling!!

      Ok, note to self, I need to stop scheduling early morning meetings, as I am getting tired of getting up early!! I have another 10am meeting tomorrow!!  Why oh why do I do this to myself??  I think because I can then have an early day and go home early, but right now, I think I would opt for the later schedule...  I was late today anyway by 1/2 hour....But my boss was cool with it and we met at 10;30 am instead.  Our meetings went well, although I was much depressed as I didn't get to go to Sephora as I so hoped, but then on my way home pouting about the non Sephora day, I realized I can go tomorrow!!   There is a new Sephora in Novato, so on my way to the climbing gym, I can swing over to Sephora and have loads of makeup fun!!!!  Yeah!!!!   So in other news my poor precious girl ( my oldest dog) has run out of her incontinence pills...And I could have sworn the vet said that it was just the one lot of pills she needed to take, but as she has run out, she again is starting to pee at unexpected times after dinner.  The vet said it is because of when she was spayed as a young dog, and now her syphincter (have no idea how to spell that)is loose.  And the pills help to tighten her syphincter.  So at some point tomorrow, I need to get her more syphincter pills....My poor precious girl, at the moment she looks so sad, and everytime she feels movement in her lower extremities she gets up and runs away from herself.  Like to say "that wasn't me, I didn't do that!!"     And in the last bit of news worthy happenings today, my boss asks me, "why do you wear so much black", and I replied, "  why is there a problem with me wearing black?"  to which she says, "Oh no, you just look like one of those gothic people...."    Now I find when people ask me this question, it is a bit baffling as I never ask someone that wears a lot pastels, or bright bright colors, why they wear so much color....., however  I get this question a lot, just like when people find out I have been married for so long and I don't have children.  Well why don't you have children??  Can you not have them???  Now if I couldn't, wouldn't you think this would be very upsetting to me??  So I find the best way to handle this question re: children, is the reason I don't have children is because I don't like them.....  They either laugh at this or look so horrified.  Is there a problem with being honest, you were nosing around in my business wanting to know why I don't have them.  And then I usually get, well you don't really mean that,,,,, why not, some people don't like dogs or cats, and they choose not to have them, I don't like children, so I chose not to have them.  Simple.   I am just the gothic black clothes wearing non breeder.

      Today went pretty well, met with my client and helped her unpack products, set up the tester units, and set up follow up meetings to get her business rolling..   Then I played hookie the rest of the day and met up with Satan at the gym to do some birthday climbing!!  I had two good falls, the first one, I clawed the wall half way down, it sounded like I was falling down a chalk board, it was pretty funny, as it was basically me and Satan, and two other climbing couples in the gym so when I took the fall, it echoed around the gym.  The second fall wasn't as dramatic, but it still sounded loud.  Satan also took some falls, and when he falls, it lifts me up off the floor, which is always amusing.  We climbed for at least two hours.  Tomorrow is another early start as I actually have to meet up with my boss at 10:00am.  So I will have to have my boss in my car all day.  Luckily she is pretty cool, and if we are by a Sephora I can always get her to do some shopping!!  And yes, we will be by a Sephora tomorrow as there is one on Union St, and our 2pm appt. Is across the street from Sephora, so that should be a good shopping day then!!    But being I have to get out of here early tomorrow,  if I want to get some exercising in tomorrow, , if I really feel like being in an exercise mode, I need to get up early and exercise. Hmm, seems good now, but tomorrow morning at 5am will be another story,, to sleep a little longer or to exercise...Especially if my insomnia is still with me tonight.....

      So this is to be a quickie as I am trying to be on time today, as I have to meet a client at 10:30, to help her set up her store and help her merchandise everything.  I am actually looking forward to this as I enjoy setting up displays and shit, it is the most creative part of my job.  I then need to schedule a time to work with her on working on her business plan as she is starting a new business.  That will probably be next week, as today needs to be just getting everything unpacked.   It is also Satan's birthday so I have a date with him to go climbing in the afternoon.  He is taking the day off. Which he only informed me over the weekend, when I had already made plans for today, and I can't reschedule.  He never takes his birthday off, but I guess turning 33 today is a celebration.  Well, good for him, as he usually is a workaholic, so it is nice to see he actually takes days off.  I had insomnia last night, I had a feeling I was going to.  And usually when I get insomnia it stays for about 3 days, so I have two more nights of this.  I think maybe it has something to do with the moon.  I usually have trouble sleeping around a full moon, and seeing that it is on Friday, that would make sense.  Maybe I am part werewolf.  Hmmm.  Not hairy enough to be one.    Ok, best go sing happy birthday to  Satan, then off to work, so  unfortunately, there will be no blogging for me until I get home this evening!!  Damn work, it gets in the way of everything!!

      No it doesn't!!  As at this moment, there is a huge thunder storm going over head, and no rain in sight.  Just ugly black clouds and lightening.  And poor Ghost is very upset about the thunder storm. She is hiding under my desk whining.   OH, that's why I have a headache and my back is hurting,  its the storm,,,,duh!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Sometimes I can be so clueless.    Well, I made Satan his birthday cake, and I must say it looks pretty sad.  I ran out of icing to inscribe a happy birthday slogan, so instead I spelled it out in chocolate chips, however you can't really read it...Oh well, it's the thought that counts!!     Ok, feeling like I am a lightening bolt target, as all of the metal in my teeth are on edge, so I think I will be signing off now, and going into the crypt for safety!!  Let me just make sure I have some cheese in there with me.......

      Why am I addicted to this movie??  It is not even that good.  However, whenever it is on, I find myself watching it. And at 7:20 in the morning it comes on, so I have been sitting there for an hour immersed in this movie.  Luckily for me I am in my home office today, or it would be yet another late start!!  I also sat and watched Salem's Lot the mini series on TNT this weekend...Twice....The first time was on Friday when it first aired, then Satan came home and said that he wanted to watch it, so we found that it was playing again on Saturday afternoon, so we marked it to watch, and what did I end up doing for 4hours on Saturday, but watching the same movie I had just watched not even 24 hours prior....The mini series was ok, but was most disappointed at the end when they started making the vampires walk around like zombies, so Rob Lowe and kid could get out of town in a hurry.   So very disappointed in that, as earlier in the movie the vampires were flying around..And suddenly they are roaming and moaning like zombies  WTF?  I did manage to clean the house this weekend, in between movies that is... So at least the house is clean.  And today at some point I have to bake a birthday cake for Satan, as his birthday is tomorrow.  I usually just go and buy a cake, but something twisted in me decided to be domestic and bake him one.  What was I thinking...Oh well, least there will be chocolate frosting from a can for me to consume today.....Not that I need it, but because it is there, and as I never buy frosting from a can, it is more tempting than ever to eat it!  Oh shit, I have a conference call with my manager that's going to be starting in a few moments, I forgot about that, so now I need to hurriedly get some bullshit together to talk to her about!!

      I just love that song, I purchased The Sisters of Mercy greatest hits volume one yesterday.  Even though I do have all their CD's, just had to get a greatest hits because it was something I didn't have.  Anyway, I have the house to myself today and tonight!!!!  Satan has gone down to our friends house tonight, so I get to do whatever I want!!!!  Hee Hee.  So I will probably be doing Spa night tonight, and get out the pedicure spa and also  do a complete facial with all the professional treatment stuff I have!!!  So hopefully I don't fall asleep with a chemical peel on my face or tomorrow I could wake up to find my face lying next to me on the pillow. That wouldn't be to much fun.  So I also purchased this book called Sacred Contracts.  It is rather a trip as it is a book to help you find your divine potential in life.  So there is this wheel (similar to a astrological chart) that you align your archetypes up to the 12 different houses ( like the zodiac houses in the astrological wheel),   So I am figuring out which Archetypes I am, and where they fall into these "houses" .Anyway, one of my Archetypes just so happens to be the vampire.  I kid you not. Anyway the vampire isn't what it is all cracked up to be, however, in speaking with Satan, regarding this, I find out I am a true vampire as I am pretty needy and he did say that I am quite exhausting with how much I am in need  of affection all the time ( I am quite a hugging type person)  But it is bizarre that it fell into my first house which is the ego and personality house.  And I didn't pick it to be there. It was how it aligned up.  So I thought that was a trip.    The other trippy thing that happened was yesterday, I was driving in San Francisco and I suddenly had a flash of an old friend of mine that I haven't seen in 5 years.  So anyway, I get to my appointment where I am meeting one of my clients, and I am at the front desk asking to see my client so I am waiting while the receptionist rings my client, and I look around, and who do I see, but my friend that I haven't seen in 5 years!!!  She was there dropping off her kids at the day care they have their at the facility ( it is like a gym/spa/community center).   So anyway we were both so excited to see each other and when I told her about my vision of her, she said that was so cool, and she loved it when that happens!!  So I have a lunch date with her next week to catch up on all the gossip.  It was really good to see her though, as she is such a great person and has such good energy, I was bummed that we had lost contact with each other, and she said the same thing!  Trippy man, trippy.

      Didn't have much to blog about yesterday, and I had another early meeting yesterday (why, don't ask), went climbing with Satan, and I got my ass up a 5.9!  To those of you who don't climb, this will mean nothing, but if you are a climber, you understand,  anyway was really happy since I am trying to get to  climbing 5.10's by the end of the year.  So I am getting there. Got home made dinner, watched the Giants LOSE AGAIN!!, and then watched the Amazing Race, and then went to bed. Exciting yes, hence why I didn't blog.  Anyway, I actually purchased this month's Oprah magazine.  And I was actually surprised that on her favorite things page (called the O list) she actually had affordable items this time.  When I have purchased the magazine before, her list usually includes such outrageous priced stuff, that she seems to say, ha ha, look at me, I am that rich and fabulous that I can buy all this crap and still have money left!!!  So I decided to come up with my own "O" list, however, I am calling it the "V" list, to what I think are truly good stuff, and if there is anyone out there who would like to share there stuff they have found that is great, do tell!!   Ok, so here are this week's top five picks:   1. Kenra Straightening Serum for Curly Hair, (found in beauty supply or salon)- this is fab stuff, if you have curly/wavy hair of course, it straightens your hair with blow dryer and brush and leaves your hair more straight than if you used a flat iron!  2. Too-Faced Liquif-Eye (found on my recent Sephora shopping spree) this will turn any and I mean any eyeshadow into a liquid eye liner!  So this is great if you like liquid eyeliners and can't find any colors you like,now you can create your own!! And it doesn't smudge or run!  3. for low carb junkies, and thank you Liz for telling me about these, the Keebler low carb cookies (found in Safeway), they come individually wrapped in the box, and the chocolate chocolate chip ones are divine when you need that chocolate fix  4. for those of us needing help in the stomach area, Billy Blanks' Ultimate Abs, its an hour long video (DVD if you prefer) of just ab workouts.  It is like a compilation from his different videos of his best ab routines, it will kick your ass, not to mention your stomach.  5. If you are looking for a good Vampire Book, Anne Rice's Blackwood Farm is the one.  She wrote it like how she used to write her vampire books ( Interview, Lestat, Queen) I couldn't put this one down.  It probably is in paperback now too!  She combined her vampires with the Mayfair witches, even more than in Merrick.   Tune in next week for another selection of the V list!        3.

      The three day weekend is nearly over.  What did I do, where did I go??  Well, being that stupid people really annoy me I stayed home this weekend.  So I caught up on sleep, I started reading a new book (Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire), I spent time outside in my garden, and watched the Giants lose three baseball games in a row.  However, I did make it out of my house into the outside world twice.  I went and got groceries on Saturday, and today I went and got more plants for the garden as well as stopping by the local jeweler to get my ring repaired.  And the time I did spend doing these things I realized something.  There are a lot of women out there that should not be wearing Britney Spears inspired clothing  when they are 30 plus years, and have an ass the size of a house! Where do these people come from, do they only show up on long holiday weekends from the bad fashion sense town, and they decide to go on holiday to show off their bad fashions??  It is truly a frightening sight.  I said to Satan as we were at one of our stops today, you know, I need to have more self esteem, as I look a lot better than most of these people, and I am covered up!!  He agreed.  Which he either felt obligated to do, or he does agree.  That is the extent of my weekend, not that exciting, or amusing, just eye opening on how many people need to start watching What Not To Wear,  the best one to catch is the show on BBC America, not the one on TLC.

       Tomorrow is up early off to get my hair colored day!!!&nbsp; Yipeee!!!!&nbsp;&nbsp;   I remember when I first started coloring my hair.&nbsp; It was back in the 80's,&nbsp;&nbsp; when I began my life as a Vampyre.&nbsp;&nbsp; Back then it was because I just wanted my hair colored, unlike today where it is a necessity for the grey that is coming in.&nbsp;   I remember the video that got me on the quest for the look that I needed to have, it was Dead or Alive's "Something In My House" video.&nbsp; It is black and white, Pete Burns is running around an old house.&nbsp; And I thought he looked gorgeous.&nbsp; Gorgeous like a girl gorgeous, not gorgeous man, would you call him a man?&nbsp; Anyway, I wanted to look like that.&nbsp; Only of course the female version, but again, is Pete Burns really a man??&nbsp;&nbsp; So I got the hair, the clothes,&nbsp; and I got my eyebrows tweezed just like that,&nbsp; I thought he was fabulous.&nbsp;   Although have you seen him now a days??&nbsp; He has had so much plastic surgery he looks like a duck.&nbsp; Pretty sad, as he was such a gorgeous man/she,&nbsp; now he looks like Joan Rivers with a duck bill.&nbsp; Why Pete why did you do that to yourself???&nbsp; It saddens my 80's girl heart....  So unlike most goths out&nbsp;there who fashioned themselves&nbsp;after Robert Smith or Ms. Banshee herself, no I had to go for the disco diva Pete Burns goth..&nbsp; but oh was he beautiful.&nbsp;&nbsp; That doesn't make me gay does it, as he is a man after all, isn't he??????????&nbsp; I just like my men a little on the pretty side I guess...&nbsp; as when I first met Satan he was wearing makeup.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he was more of that Guns n Roses type o' guy, would you call them pretty??&nbsp;&nbsp; Axel was kind of pretty in their first video, with his big hair.......but that is another story all together.......  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;

      I can't believe how exhausted I feel right now.  It has been one long ass tiring day.  It started this morning in San Francisco as I walked god knows how many miles up and down Union Square, up the hills, and then I was too impatient to wait for the elevator that I walked up 10 flights of stairs..Yes, 10 flights of stairs...What was I thinking, then I went climbing tonight as well, and did some real tiring climbs.  It is amazing that I can actually move my fingers over this keyboard.....  Anyway some bazaar thing happened today,,,, I think I am haunting myself, is this possible??  Anyway, I had a message on my cell phone and when I went to retrieve the message, it was my outgoing message on my cell phone.....Ok....Then I am driving down Lombard and I get a text message on my phone,  what? No one ever texts me, so I am a stop light and I am checking the text,,,,,and the message reads,,please call me  and it gives my cell phone number!!!!!  What the Fuck???????????????????????????????????????????????????  So a little paranoid I am at this point...  And then the only other comment of the evening is why oh why do people not exfoliate their elbows??   I find this rather gross to see skanky ass dry rot elbows!!!  Now, I know if you are one of those people out there with psoriasis  that you cannot help this, however for everyone else,  wash and exfoliate those elbows people!!!  I don't know how many gross dry rot elbows I have seen today hanging out of car windows.  I feel like tossing them exfoliators as I drive by their cars.  It doesn't take a degree  on how to wash your elbows,Just scrub away when you are in the shower with a loofa or a good exfoliator, you can pick them up at your local grocery store, and did any of you heard of moisturizer???  Ok, that is my soap box moment for this evening....Good night!

      Today my mum would be 69.  Happy Birthday mum!!  Just couldn't grasp the feeling of today.  It is now a year and a half since my mum died of Alsheimers.  And this is the second birthday without her.  Last year we (my sisters and I) had a memorial for her on her birthday. It was really nice.  A lot of her friends turned up to remember her, and share special memories they had with her.  So I tried to go to work today, but I had no real energy and no real purpose of going.  I did come home early, and the strange thing was I turned on the TV over to Oprah (which I  don't usually do) and she had a program today about people with alsheimers.  It was really sad.  There was this guy who had it at the age of 36.  That is so scary, as that is how old I am. But the one story that brought me to tears was to see the story of a mother who had it when she was 51, she died when she was 58.  Her daughter had put together a documentary on her life with alsheimers.  It was just seeing this lady and the look on her face that really brought back all those hard memories of my mum.  Her documentary will be on this weekend on msnbc.    Before the end of the day, I want to make sure I do some of the things my mum loved doing, gardening, playing with the dogs, reading a favorite book, laughing, singing, and of course eating ice cream!  I think if mum could have she would have eaten ice cream 24/7!     --Mothers hold their children's hands for awhile, their hearts forever---

      I have come to the conclusion that I must love being on a diet.  Why?  I have no clue.  But why would I spend most of my life on one if I didn't enjoy it?? I get to a certain weight, and I start to cheat.  Which I am doing right now.  I have the last 10 pounds to go, and what do I do?  Start eating bad stuff.  I am exercising like a fool still, but before I went to England in April, I was on a roll, extra pounds were flying off, I was eating really healthy ( real low fat and low carb)  I was 4 pounds away from my ideal weight.  But since coming back from England, my healthy eating habits have been hit and miss.  And the pounds are slowly creeping back...  I have good intentions when I start the day, but by the end, I have eaten crap.  And it isn't bread, or chips, but chocolate.  I am so addicted to it that I can't help myself.  I have been trying to be good and buy healthy food to eat, but as my husband can eat chocolate by the gallon, and not gain an ounce, there is always chocolate in this house, and on a day like today when I am in my home office, I find myself sneaking it.   Hello I am a chocolate addict.  I haven't had chocolate since 2 hours ago..However, the night is not over yet.  So I thought maybe if I blogged about it, it would make me stop this insane compulsive chocolate disorder I have.  Maybe, maybe not, but I thought it would be at least a good try to put it out there. And for the world to see that I am a cheater when it comes to dieting.  Does anyone else have this problem, as I feel like I have no self control when it comes to chocolate.  I am out of control..    I feel like Miranda from Sex and the City when she was eating cake out of her garbage can...I haven't gotten to that stage yet, but if I keep going, I know it's just around the corner.

      This weekend we had a surprise party for Satan.  Even though his birthday was two weeks ago, our friends (including Liz) thought it would be cool to have a surprise party for him.  So the deal was to take Satan climbing while the party goers arrive, and Hil can get everything set up for the party.  So Satan, Chris, and I go climbing and we are supposed to be back at the house for 2pm.  No problem, yeah right.  So after climbing, Satan wants to go to the English shop for English things (of course), so we go there and Chris suddenly feels sick, and I am taking it like he is "playing" sick so we can get back in time for the surprise.    Well, no, he has allergies which he has never had before, so he feels extra bad, anyway, so now after the English shop, Satan now wants to go to REI and Best Buy, ok its 1:45 we have 15 minutes to be back at this party, and we are 30 minutes away.  And now Chris wants me to go to Albertsons so he can get some allergy medicine.  So while he is in there at the store, I am thinking, ok, Chris is no help, he has no clue that we are supposed to be back now at his house, and I can't say anything in front of him, as Satan is in the back seat, so I decide to pick a fight with Satan.....And I say, you know, Chris isn't feeling well, we should really get him back to his house, we can always go to REI and Best Buy up buy our house.  Satan:" Well, I wanted to get Chris a birthday present at REI" Me:" Well, I just gave him that Tshirt for his birthday, he has something from us, why do you need to get him something else, lets just go back to their house."  Satan: evil, evil glare...  Me:" ok, so we will go to REI up by us."    At this point, Satan has turned his back on me, (I am in the drivers seat, he is in the back seat and is now like a dog looking out the window with his back to me.) and I am thinking, ok I could really go off right now, but I am doing this for him, so just bite the old tongue and everything will be ok in a bit.  So Chris gets back in the car, and I say to him, well as you are not feeling well Chris, why don't we just go back to your house.  (Wink Wink, Nudge, Nudge), and Chris says, "oh no I will be fine, we can go to Best Buy and REI"........WHAT THE FUCK??????????????????????  I am thinking ok, I just picked a fight with Satan, and you are not even playing along here (by the way it is now 2:05), whatever, so now we go over to best buy, and Satan won't get out of the car.  He looks at me and says, I thought we were going to the one by us, fine,so I say, as we are driving by REI do you want me to pull in here (WTF we are late now anyway) and Satan says all grumbly, I just want some chalk.    So he goes in to get his chalk, and probably to get Chris another present, Chris and I stay in the car, and I am like what the fuck dude, we are supposed to be at your house right now, there is like a house load of people waiting back at your house for us, did you forget?????  And he looks at me, OH, well I better call Hil, and let her know we will be there in 30 minutes.......  So Satan finally comes out with his climbing chalk, and we head back to the house.  Satan is still pissed off, not speaking to me, and Chris is trying to do small talk, like that is going to make it any better.  So now we are pulling up the street to the house, the windows are rolled up as the air conditioning is on, and suddenly Chris says, eewwwhh, that smells like diapers,,, and from the back seat this aroma of the worst smelling fart you can think of is now taking over the car.  I am just at this point trying to park the car, however the smell of the fart is so mind numbing that all communication and functioning thoughts have left me.  I am trying to roll the window down, but the smell of this fart is up my nose, in my eyes, in my mouth and I am about to start hacking, when I hear Chris and Satan, yell, Look out for Liz' car, don't you know how to drive????     At this point I am so over this surprise party that I start yelling,"Get Out, Get out, Both of you Get Out of My car!!!!!"  And Chris then says, are you sure, we will wait for you???  GET OUT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!   So he and Satan High tail it out of my car and go into the house.  I can hear shouts of Surprise as I finish parking the car.  But the smell of the fart was so Toxic all I can do is slump over the wheel of my car with the vision I had of when I first smelled the thing,which was the evil grin on Satans face in the rearview mirror as the fumes of his mind numbing fart start to engulf the car.

      Nothing to report............................the cold I have is getting worse,&nbsp; it is now invaded my throat and chest and I sound like I have been possessed by Stevie Nicks.&nbsp;   So here I sit, sweating to death due to this heat wave we are having,&nbsp; feeling weak from lack of food, as I still have no appetite.&nbsp;   This could be my last known blog,&nbsp; as I think I am dying.&nbsp; Goodbye cruel world.  At least let me be found wearing something pretty, and not my laundry day clothes.  What am I talking about, me wearing something pretty, fuck I must be sick if I want to wear something pretty.&nbsp; Ok, let me rephrase that, let me be found in anything but my laundry day fashions...............................and all that can be heard is the sound of my head hitting the keyboard...............................................

      As I am home today sick, I have done the following things to avoid actually working from home:   sat on the couch and watched Crossing Over with John Edward ( I wasn't on the couch with him, he was on the TV)  tried the new deodorant I purchased, and it actually makes my armpits   smell worse.    had a few ingrown hairs in the bikini area, so tried  urlLink Liz 's plucking thing, ok that hurts Liz, you are a serious pain freak!  checking blogs on the hour  looking in the fridge to see what I can eat that won't make me hurl, or feel like I am going to hurl.  So I have eaten so far, my low carb cereal, low carb yogurt, and a low carb bar.&nbsp; And they have all made me feel like hacking.  Talked on the phone with my coworker who was also home doing nothing.  packed up my sister's birthday present to send her.  sitting down and watching mtv everytime I walk through the living room  watered the garden  Looked at different CDs to play  made silly noises and faces at my dogs, and watch them jump around all excited. filled up the hummingbird feeders  And how do I justify my lack of working,&nbsp; I have called 15 accounts, which is more than I would see in one day, if I was actually out and about working.&nbsp;  See how the sick mind works.&nbsp;&nbsp; Hmm, maybe its time now for a nap.

      Alright, so if getting this weird summer cold wasn't bad enough, I now have the wonderful monthly cramps to go along with it.&nbsp; How lovely.&nbsp;&nbsp; And I feel like puking.&nbsp; This should be a good day.   Update on Voodoo man in Arizona,&nbsp;&nbsp; (see previous something wicked blog) he has struck again.&nbsp; My sister called me last&nbsp;night to tell me that her husband got into a car accident, and&nbsp;their jeep is thrashed.&nbsp; My brother in law is ok, thank god, but he does have whip lash pretty&nbsp;badly.&nbsp; So as my sister was on her way to go&nbsp;get her hubby the voodoo man called her work, and&nbsp;demanded to know where&nbsp;she was.&nbsp; The receptionist said she had to leave as it was an emergency, then asked voodoo man&nbsp;why he was "panting",&nbsp; she was kind of worried as he is old thinking he was having a heart attack or something.&nbsp;&nbsp; He says," oh I've just been&nbsp;pacing back and forth for a while.......&nbsp;"&nbsp;&nbsp; so it sounds like he is trying to do voodoo shit to my brother in law now, as he finds him a threat.&nbsp; Also while at work that day, my brother in law also came across another scorpion.  My sister said it&nbsp;is time for stronger banishings, as she didn't want to stir up any bad shit, but obviously she didn't banish him well enough....Will update further with any other news....   Ok, just had to clean up big candle wax drip explosion.&nbsp; I just heard this pop fizzle sound behind me, I turn around and my candle that I had lit on top of the TV is now dripping candlewax down the front of the TV and is now dribbling onto the wood floor.&nbsp; Nice.&nbsp; Nothing that a little razor blade action won't clean up.&nbsp;   Not going to baseball game today. Bummer.&nbsp; As Chris didn't get the tickets in time.&nbsp; He was doing way to much research on the tickets.  I am taking another home office day today as driving around feeling nauseous is not my idea of fun.&nbsp; My main&nbsp;thing to do&nbsp;&nbsp;today anyway is to invite salons and spas to a class we are doing, so I can phone them just as well , in between my bouts of puking that is.&nbsp; And no I am not pregnant.&nbsp;&nbsp; As I am having a heavy flow day anyway.&nbsp; Either that, or I am having a miscarriage as I blog.&nbsp; Great.&nbsp;   &nbsp;

      My sister is a massage therapist in Arizona, and one of her clients is a freak.&nbsp; Well, I am sure she has more than just one, but this one&nbsp;I know for sure is a freak.&nbsp; He has put some weird voodoo curse on her, or is trying to.&nbsp; He first started going to her a couple of months ago I think,&nbsp; anyway,&nbsp; lately he has been acting weird.&nbsp;&nbsp; But then looking back on the whole time she has had him as a client he has been weird.&nbsp; He is 74 years old, yeah that's weird from the start anyway, he started to ask her all these strange questions both sexual and nonsexual,and &nbsp;my sister would then give him a snide remark and try and ignore him.  &nbsp;  However, lately when he asks her a question (while he is getting his massage) she will answer him, but then he won't respond, like he is in a trance or something.&nbsp;&nbsp; He then told her the other day, to stop "fighting him" and just let it happen, to which she had no clue to what he was talking about.&nbsp; So then one day he comes in and says wow, did you feel the cosmic dreams we were having last night??&nbsp; She then says, what are you talking about?&nbsp; And he says last night in our dreams we were having this really deep conversation.&nbsp; So now she is thinking ok freak, what ever, but then he started doing odd behavior like putting his arm around her and doing some&nbsp;weird pressure point type thing, or pressing his hand into her back like putting some sort of spell on her.&nbsp; I asked her if he had something of hers to make him do a spell on her, and she said that when she makes another appt. For him she writes it down on her business card and gives it to him, so that is probably what he is channeling her though.&nbsp; And one day he told her that he always gets what he is after, and to stop fighting him on that too.  &nbsp; At first she thought he was this strange old hippy dude, but now he has turned into a psycho.&nbsp; So the other day she is at home dozing on the couch and she has this dream that she has a scorpion in her hand, but the face of the scorpion is this freaky old man!&nbsp; So she jumps up out of her sleep, and is trying to get the scorpion off of her.&nbsp; So this totally freaks her out even more.&nbsp; Turns out this freaky old man is in to some ancient form of Asian voodoo stuff, and he is trying to turn it on to my sister.&nbsp;&nbsp; She cancelled her&nbsp; last massage appointment with him and had him call her clinic to reschedule,&nbsp; and about the time of the original appointment, my sister gets home, and finds a scorpion in her house!&nbsp; The receptionist at the clinic told her that when she called to cancel on the freak, he was strange on the phone and kept asking why was she canceling, was it something he did??&nbsp;  &nbsp;  There have been other weird shit that has happened surrounding this freak, but anyway, over the weekend,&nbsp; my sister and I were putting together some banishing spells to keep him away from her, as he was saying he had all these powers over her.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But so far, I haven't heard from her today, so I am rather anxious to find out what happened as she was going to confront him today and tell him to stay away from her.&nbsp;&nbsp; Hopefully all is well, and the 74 year old freak has left the building for good!

      Why are weekends so damn short??&nbsp; I feel I never have enough time to do, well, nothing.....My biggest excitement this weekend was washing our three dogs...Yes let the excitement begin.&nbsp; Although it wasn't as bad as expected, as it was so hot, being hosed down in 100 degree heat was rather refreshing,&nbsp; oh yes, I was washing the dogs wasn't I??  &nbsp;  Anyway, it took a good two hours to wash all three, being our husky, Ghost, was the most dramatic about the whole experience, she doesn't' stand there and take it like a dog, no, she howls like there is no tomorrow.&nbsp; You would think being it so hot, she would love being in the water.&nbsp; No you would think we were setting her on fire by the way she howls.&nbsp; Needless to say she was the last one to be bathed.  &nbsp;  Our youngest girl thought getting a bath was the best thing ever, and looked at us when we finished like she was ready for her second bath.&nbsp; And Precious girl went first, as she is so good she just stands there and lets you do whatever to her.  &nbsp;  So yeah,&nbsp; as you can see my weekend rocked.&nbsp; But it was still better than a work day.&nbsp; However this week I will be playing hookie from work to go and catch an &nbsp;afternoon baseball game!&nbsp; So that will be at least the highlight of the week to look forward to.  &nbsp;  Oh yes,&nbsp; and I did buy Cure tickets today, as they are coming to SF in August.&nbsp; And the lovely  urlLink Liz  did tell me she would go with me, as when I asked Satan, he just curled his nose up and said the Cure?&nbsp; I don't think so....&nbsp;&nbsp; well, he will be the one all pouty when Liz and I have the best time ever, I am sure of it!!  &nbsp;  Well, as you can see I am overwhelmed by how exciting my weekend has been, best go and take another nap to try and calm myself down!

      Went to the school yesterday with coworker to help her out to do a training.&nbsp; Can't believe how many brain dead people go to school, I think the students were all sharing one brain cell.&nbsp; Either that or I have found the school where the zombies go.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But it was most amusing,&nbsp; as it was a very diverse lot, there was the usual beauty school girls all makeup, glitter and every hair color you can imagine in their hair, their was the beauty school drop out sleeping in the corner chair, and then there was the odd ones that just made you wonder, why are you here?&nbsp; This question mainly went to this one guy who looked to be about 24 who may have been lost as he looked like he should have been at a school to learn carpentry instead of how to give someone a facial.&nbsp; Very strange as he was wearing a jacket with his hood pulled up so you could barely see his face, maybe he was embarrassed that he was in beauty school??   Anyway, after class we went to Starbucks.&nbsp; We get our coffee and sit down, and&nbsp; more people are coming in and sitting down, and what to my horrors do I realize that I am sitting in the middle of baby central!!&nbsp; AAAAHHHHHHH!!!!!   There is this one woman to my left who thinks that she can leave her toddler sitting in the chair while she can go off and get coffee, thinking I am going to look after her kid, uh, you may have read Hil Clinton's book, it takes a village, but you have entered my village lady and this village ain't looking after your kid.&nbsp; So of course the kid goes wandering off around Starbucks and when the lady comes back to the seat and her child isn't there she gives me a filthy look&nbsp; and starts yelling for her kid.&nbsp; I just looked at her with a stare like, just say something please, but of course, she just looked away and went after her kid.   Then, two friends come in wielding baby buggies and want to sit in the handy cap chairs that are to my right and so they bump into my seat with their buggies, not even and excuse me, just a shove, like I should of had eyes in the back of my head and should have known the baby buggy patrol was on its way, again, I just did my lethal glare at them, and they quickly wielded their buggies around my table.&nbsp; So the one leaves her &nbsp;buggy no less than 3 inches from my leg with the child still aboard it.&nbsp; And its starting to make noises.&nbsp; The other woman has positioned her buggy next to the window so her child is getting all the death rays from the sun on it.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am now giving my lethal glare to the buggy and child next to my leg, and the mother must sense the lasers from my eyes penetrating her precious child and she quickly takes it from the buggy and plonks it on her lap, and then her and her friend&nbsp;start talking loudly about how lovely&nbsp;their&nbsp;children are and blah blah blah how wonderful it is to be mothers...   Did I come to Starbucks to be educated on the wonderful lives of mothers and babies??&nbsp; NO, I just wanted a friggin cup of coffee!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!   So to make baby hell complete, there looks like a newborn two seats away with mother and father.&nbsp; And what does newborn decide to do, let out one of those god&nbsp;awful&nbsp;ear piercing&nbsp;"I'm gonna fuck&nbsp;with all of you&nbsp;non breeder" screams!&nbsp; Now,&nbsp;one would think if you have a screaming child in a coffee shop the polite thing to do would be to either A. Put pillow over child's head and muffle screams, or B. Take the screaming child outside so it can whale to the world.&nbsp; But no,&nbsp;they instead look around with that fuckin' I have a fabulous&nbsp;child look on their face&nbsp;and do nothing more than cluck at the child, thinking that is going to do anything.&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, at this time, it is when my coworker looks at me, and says, oh my god, I forgot you don't like children do you?&nbsp; As she is a mom herself and I have at this point realized she is the baby magnet here, as when these people came through the door she was smiling at them and giving that I have children too &nbsp;vibe off.&nbsp;&nbsp;She then says, do you want to leave,&nbsp; and I just looked at her and said, what do you think?&nbsp;&nbsp;   My conclusion of my Starbucks moment is this, isn't really the child I dislike so much, or is it the smug yuppy parents who make me wanna turn into rage mode, the real problem?&nbsp; The only thing I can think of is note to self, never ever go into the Starbuck's in the center of Yuppy town again!

      Wow, can't believe how long I was illin...........That was the longest cold I think I have had in awhile, but enough about that as I know I am over it!!   Had a two day meeting at work that was well, kind of boring.&nbsp; But aren't all meetings.&nbsp; I think the first day would have been fine, going for two was &nbsp;just the downward spiral into boredomville.&nbsp;   Tomorrow I will be going to the school I am interested in enrolling in.&nbsp; I am going with my coworker as she has this school as one of her accounts and she will actually be having a meeting with the head people, so&nbsp; I can really get to see if this is the school for me to go back to.&nbsp; Which after the meetings I was just in, made me more wanting to get my license and get the fuck on with my life!!!!!!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   I was so tempted to stop on my way home today at Nordstrom as their Anniversary sale is coming to an end this week. But I actually controlled myself, don't know how that happened.&nbsp; As I saw these really cute boots in their catalog, and some really cool jewelry too,&nbsp; but I just couldn't pull my dragula off the freeway, I was in the speed zone and all I&nbsp; could see was my house way way off in the distance.&nbsp; I do that when I am really hungry too and should stop, but I&nbsp; just get into this zone of wanting to get home so bad, I put up with the hunger pains.&nbsp; The only time I cannot do this is when I need to take a wizz really bad.&nbsp; That's when I have to enter into the public bathroom phobia that I have.&nbsp;&nbsp; But I really try to take a leek at the last place I am before I get into my car, as the last public bathroom I was at put me over the edge&nbsp; and can't go back there anytime soon&nbsp; as the memories of the horror of it all is just to fresh in my mind.

      Still sick....Still sweaty......Still hacking up flem balls......But now I have one nostril that is plugged up...Could life be any better??   I stepped on the scale today, and since I got this sickness, I have lost 5 pounds!&nbsp;&nbsp; So if anything good comes out of it, I hope that is it, and maybe I can lose 10 by the time it is finished!!&nbsp;   I woke up this morning so grossed out by my b.o.&nbsp; that I nearly spewed.&nbsp; In my sickness daze I got up and went and took a shower.&nbsp; Then I got more cramps, ok what the fuck, I have been on my period for the last 4 days, so why would I be cramping again??&nbsp; But hey they were so bad that&nbsp; it made me forget that I was sick.&nbsp;   The most exciting thing I could muster up to do today was wash my car.&nbsp; I then had to come in and take a nap as that was so exhausting.&nbsp;   I still have to find the energy to pack as I have a 2 day meeting I will be going to tomorrow, and won't be back till Tuesday evening.&nbsp;&nbsp;   One day when I am healthy again, if that day ever comes,&nbsp; I will reread these blogs and try and understand them, as I am sure I am just a blithering idiot at this point in time.   So this will hopefully be my last sickness blog, until Tuesday evening,   Back to the coffin I go.......

      So, here I am at my desk working ( or not working) away and what pungent odor comes wafting up from underneath my desk....eau de dog fart!   Dog spelled backwards is God. I saw a bumper sticker yesterday that said "Real Men love Jesus." Jesus spelled backwards is Susej(this could mean sausage if you say susej real fast)  so that would mean that Dogs are really god, and everyone knows dogs love snausages, so Jesus is really a sausage but in dog language it is susej...and don't most women say that men are dogs....which brings me back to the Real Men love Jesus bumpersticker..........................  ok, I think the dog fart has done something with my brainage............

      Everyone needs to go to the  urlLink Mangey Cur  blog and say hello to my sister. She just started her blog yesterday!  My 3 month review that I had on Wednesday went alright. There were three categories: Needs Improvement, Meets Standards, Exceeds Standards. Well, I met all standards, which is fine, as I don't need to exceed in this job, as I am not looking to become a workaholic manager. So just keep me at meeting standards, and I will be a happy vampyre. But my boss is still freaking out, she left all of us in our region this email saying it was unacceptable that no one was making there quota this week. But the tone of her email was like someone about to have a nervous breakdown........hmmmmmm, she is taking today off, could she be penciling in a nervous breakdown day??  Satan purchased a digital camera yesterday with all of his gift cards from best buy that he received on his bday. It was most amusing watching him walking around looking for things to take pictures of. It was like watching a little kid on Christmas with their new toy. He took two of me which were SOOOOO unflattering ( I was stuffing my face with chips), that I immediately made him figure out the delete function on the camera, and made note to self, do not eat in front of people with digital cameras. Anyway, his next subjects were of course the dogs, who were happy to pose for him. He has left on his camping trip, so I am sure there will be loads of pictures of Chris and nick climbing to view when he comes back. Boys and there toys.....  Our dog Ghost (she is the one wearing the hat) has a new phobia. She seems to think that our kitchen floor is a bottomless pit and is afraid to walk any farther into the kitchen than where her food bowl is. She stands to the side of the dog bowls and howls, and does her tippy toe dance.....When you try and get her farther into the kitchen over by the dishwasher, she runs in circles and high tales it out of the kitchen, through the living room, and runs into the bedroom and runs under the bed. So we were thinking, maybe her toenails need clipping, and that is why she is freaking out about walking on the tile. We then bribed her out from under the bed, and proceeded to clip her toenails. This of course is another long process as, just like having a bath, she hates having her toenails clipped. Satan had to end up sitting on her as I quickly clipped her toenails, the labradors had to be banished to the other room with the door closed while this mayhem happened in the living room, as one traumatized dog is all we can handle in a day, as Willow, our chocolate lab is terrified of toe nail clippers.... Of any kind. Just touching your feet will send her into a panic attack of wheezing and hyper ventilating...Oh the joys of having freaky children!

      I think I have become a crazy bird lady. Every morning I go out and put out food on the bird table for the birds, and fill up the hummingbird feeders. Well, now the crazy birds have become codependent on me. I was late getting out to feeding them this morning, and the birds who eat at the bird table were lined up along the fence freaking out that their food wasn't there. I have ravens that come down to eat as well, and they were up in the oak tree just bitching me out today as I was late feeding them.  Now for my hummingbirds. Most people get a hummingbird coming to feed, well last year was the first year I put out a feeder, and one came down, then another showed up, then another,,,,, and now I have 5 feeders up gallon sized and there must be over 100 hummingbirds flying around feeding. My neighbor asked yesterday if we were feeding them speed or something... I have created sugar addicts. I don't put the red dye in the mix as I know that is not really good for them, so I don't know if that is the difference, as we have asked our neighbors how many hummingbirds do they get, and they have maybe 3 at the most., and they do put in the red dye. So I guess my house is the hook up for the hummingbird feeder juice!  Oh yes, and last night Satan and I went and sat out on our deck to watch the bats come out. Yes, we also have bats. We do have a bat box, however we haven't found the right place to hang it from, as it needs to be up high. But we do believe they live in the trees out back, as that is where they were flying out of last night. I think we saw about 20 bats, all different sizes, they were all heading south when they came out of the trees, so we are wondering where they were off to. A bat party? A rave? Although we didn't see them wearing any funky looking hats, so maybe not a rave, but they were all headed somewhere.  And lastly we also have two red tail hawks that come down and sit in our Walnut trees. They are beautiful. They used to nest in one of the old old trees we had at the bottom of our garden, but last winter we had really bad rains, and the old tree came a crashing down, which was sad, as the hawks have now had to find another nesting spot, but they still come and hang out in our garden.

      Well, I know I should be working, but blogging is just way more fun. My boss was a little bitchy yesterday on our conference call, and in speaking with my coworker, she was bitchy with her too. So I do believe yesterday was official boss bitch day. Also known as Monday. But Tuesday should be better, but I haven't really done any work, and tomorrow I am with my boss, so I can have a face to face bitch session, as I get my 3 month review. Oh Yah, can't wait for that!  But speaking with my sister this morning, who will be blogging soon as she will be getting a computer soon (yay!), she also had a bitch fest with her boss on Friday...What is going on? Did all the bosses of the world get together and decide that this is international bitch out your employee month?? Oooo can't wait for tomorrow, as I am helping out the cause by not working!! This should bring in big scores to my boss' bitch fest!  On a lighter note, glad that the photos of my girls made it on to this page, and they were well received! They enjoyed being guinea pigs for my little photo experiment. However, I think Satan is getting jealous now too, as I think he wants to be seen by the masses, so I will have to find a photo of him suitable for the blog zone...So watch for Satan coming soon to a blog near you!

      I actually exercised this morning! Yipee! As I have been sick for the last few weeks, I have slagged off the workouts, but it was really good this morning to feel healthy again. Tomorrow we are even going to try and go climbing again, which should be amusing, as I haven't been in so long it will be a challenge to get my ass up the wall!  I am supposed to be working right now, but needed to catch up on blogs first as I didn't check them all day yesterday. And do you think I was doing anything exciting....uh no, unless you count grocery shopping and cleaning the house exciting!  I purchased a new lipstick the other day from this awesome beauty store called Beauty Expo in San Rafael, it has every thing you can imagine, it is kind of like a Sephora for the lesser known products. They also have stationary and stuff, it was quite impressive, I think I spent 90 minutes in there just looking at everything, they have  tons and tons of hair products, but the makeup area was pretty impressive as it wasn't name brands like what Sephora has. But they had Sebastian Trucco, Tigi, some stuff I never heard of, Jane Irdale, Bare Essentials... And the list goes on and on. They also had this interesting body wash/scrub that was like ice cream, and they ( the staff) scoop it out of these huge tubs with ice cream cones. Probably just a gimmick, but of course, me and gimmicks, gotta love um, I bought the Vanilla snowcone flavor, it is a body scrub, and it smells just like cake batter! The scrub wasn't too bad, but the smell lasted awhile so it was most impressive as usually you don't get the scent lasting after you shower.  Watched 50 First Dates this weekend, it was quite funny. Still don't think that is really Drew's real hair. It has to be extensions, as everyone seems to be doing the extension thing. Paris Hilton's looked really bad the other day, I saw her and her sis on Oprah. What is this thing I have with watching Oprah lately? I think I am having too much time on my hands, hopefully that is it, and I am not turning into a middle aged house wife. HA! Ok that was funny, I think I will wake from that nightmare now!

      I realized this evening, I really am evil...And I am not too upset about it.  Watching one of Satan's TiVo selections (extreme makeover, home edition) and was ready to punch the TV. Sickly sweet people wanna make me vomit. The family they chose for this weeks episode were oh so wonderful, looking way to smarmy for words. I just wanted to beat them. And the design team on that show made me wanna blow chunks as well. Why do they have to come across as fucking dorks? They just seem way to fake as if they are saying "Look, America is falling for our crappy goody goody act". I wanna see them help someone out who really deserves it. Go into Oakland for gods sake and help out any number of individuals that have to live in crack alley, not by choice but because they can't afford to live anywhere else.. Or go to a trailer park and redo someone's trailer......Don't give me this lets film Joe "I think my family is wonderful" fuckhead, and Mrs. Joe "I'm pregnant with triplets" fuckhead, who live in a nice house in suburbia USA..... It makes me ill.....And the worst part is the end when the design team do their fake crocodile tears on how the families lives will be so much better now!  And why do you ask does Satan tape this crappy show, well being that he is into constructing things, he likes to see how they can rebuild a house in a week. Yeah that is the interesting part, and the houses they do rebuild are amazing, however I can do with out the sappiness of it all.  Reading this blog, you would think I was angry, no just evil. Plane and simple.  What would I rather watch....Let me see....Give me Eddie Izzard any day with his Babies On Spikes (ererererer- sounds of babies going on spikes) comedy special on HBO...It is actually called Dressed to Kill and it is fucking hilarious!

      I think the alcohol from Saturday's drinking fest, has killed off some brain cells that I definitely needed. I feel stupider than usual today. I can't spell, well I never am good at that, but today it's even worse! And the conference call I had this morning with our region and our manager I was just out of it. I didn't have much to say, didn't feel like contributing to the usual "yay this month is going to be great, we can make the numbers" bullshit that everyone else was partaking in. Oh well. WTF, I am just here doing time until I can get my own business up and running.  urlLink Mangey cur  seems to be having the same problemos with work too. Hope her day is better today.  So I think today, I need to redo my home office, as I think the energy in this room is stagnate and is not moving around, hence why I feel the way I do. So I will try some fung shui (Yeah, I know I spelled that wrong), today and see what happens! Wish me luck.. I would like to paint this office of mine too, as renter's white is just not doing it for me, especially as we bought this house three years ago.  I think Satan was a little jealous of the fun and mayhem  urlLink Liz  I got into this weekend. Last night he asks me, so did you miss me? And of course I said yes, but it was rather cute, as usually he doesn't ask, because usually when he goes away for his climbing weekends with his buds, I am just doing boring mundane stuff at home, like cleaning the house, grocery shopping, catching up on my magazine reading, etc... But this time as Liz was here, he felt like he missed out on something.. I think he too wanted to do the drunk photo session , as he loves having his picture taken. As Mangeycur would know, she used to be a photographer, and he loved being her model! Oh well, Satan, there is always a next time!
