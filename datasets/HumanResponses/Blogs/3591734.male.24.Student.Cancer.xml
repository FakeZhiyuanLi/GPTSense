      Yes... those dreaded things known as exams are finally through and done with. Now only those fucked up things known as results await. The last I heard from myself, I was rambling on about Absinthe. Well, that plan never came to fruition, but now, with over a month left to drink and smoke myself silly, I'm sure it will manage to find a way to sneak back into my list of "how to drink and smoke yourself silly."  Yesterday was the bomb though. Had my little birthday party, unbeknownst to most, 2 days in advance. Vesbar's 10 drinks for 20 bucks cards were on that night, so you can sure that yours truly made the most of it. Surprisingly, no hangover present. Arrghhh... but my legs really hurt today though.  Warning: Two girls sitting in your lap may seem like fun at the time.  This calls to mind a transcendental Zen quote by my good friend Arun. I can't remember the exact quote, but it went something like "If you piss in front of a tiger, be prepared to face the consequences."

      *Groan* Exam... early in the morning... 9 p.m. Luckily, it was an easy one, and I only had to use half a brain cell to ace it. Decided to bounce on over to the Vesbar to commend my grey matter for such effortless work by dousing it with some grey-cell exterminant: alcohol. My immensely talented brain however, knew that this was the exact course that I would take after each and every exam, so it decided to lower my immune system just a tad bit, so that a very sneaky cold could sneak in, and immediately get to work. Thus, thwarting my celebratory plans of a chilled vodka cranberry. What it didn't anticipate was Plan B... cough medicine.  Cough medicine? At a bar? Sure, codeine is a great trip and all, but what kinda bar sells that shit for real? Nopes, my concept of cough medicine consists of a huge dose of brandy, some hot water and a slice of slightly squeezed lemon. The brandy warms you up instantly. The hot water is exactly the opposite of cold water. And the lemon slice contains a fair amount of Vitamin C. Also, if there happens to be any around, some honey... the sweet stuff in jars, not chicks, although they would be greatly appreciated too. But I dare not ask the bar staff, as I fear they would not extend their gracious services unto me anymore.  Speaking of Absinthe, was watching Nine Inch Nails' "Perfect Drug" video for the nth time today. Finally decided to do a little research and reading on the history of Absinthe. Like weed, there's a bit of paraphernalia and preparation methods involved. Also like weed, the stuff is supposed to spark some real creative shit off. And even more like weed... it's green. Most surprisingly, a glass of Absinthe (just recently legalised in Switzerland, home of the best Absinthe) can be purchased at the Vesbar. So, that's now my post-exam agenda for Thursday... brain-permitting of course.

      Was listening to Rage Against The Machine after a really long while today. They're still one of my favourite bands, but I don't listen to them as much as I used to. Anyone who's been in contact with me since the last 5 months, knows that I'm currently in "A Perfectly Circular" state of mind. Back to Rage Against The Machine though. You must be wondering where Limp Bizkit fits into all of this... they're right dead centre of it all. RATM broke up because of Limp Bizkit, and that's a fuckin' fact.  *It's time for Flashback Sequence music and wavey moving pictures*  The date is September the 7th, in the year 2000. It's the MTV VMAs on... the stars are out, the lights are bright, the carpet is red. RATM and Limp Bizkit were nominated in the same category that night... what a disgrace to Rage... they even played with the Bizkit on the same day back in Woodstock '97. As legend would have it, Limp Bizkit won for whatever piece of shit song they got nominated for. At the same time, Tim C. of RATM decides to make like a monkey and climb a stage prop. That other simian in a baseball cap, Fred Durst, instead of trying to talk this motherfucker down, says something along the lines of "this guy's our biggest fan."  What a fuckin' asshole huh? If not for that drunk dumbass Tim C. and the rest of Rage Against The Machine, your cheesy band wouldn't even be around making music, let alone accepting awards. I'm no big fan of music award shows. I mean, who the hell are a bunch of people to hand out awards for best song, or best album? What is all this based on, besides manipulated stuff like radio airplay and charts and sales? The bottom line however is, if RATM had won in that category that night, they would have probably still been around today...

      Just got back from a uncharacteristically sober Thursday night at the Vesbar... I left my wallet at home (Stupid decision 1). Watched old 10 pixels-per-inch episodes of Saturday Night Live at Evans' place - eyes hurting now (Stupid decision 2). Cue to dinnertime at the nearest McDeez... close-up of greasy freckle-faced kid taking order - Hi, and welcome to McDonalds, how may I swindle you? Ryan - I'll have a Big Mac and a McChicken... bag it up please (Stupid decision 3). I better go to sleep before I do more dumb stuff... although I doubt that it can get lamer than takeaway from McDonalds. 1 billion burgers sold? More like one billion souls buggered...

      Well not the TV as such... still have to get me one of those. I had some leftover donuts from last night so I decided to include them in my next day's lunch. I went downstairs to the bakery opposite to get myself a coffee to keep the donuts company... first time I'm getting a coffee from this place. Now when I say "flat white coffee," I understand it to be a coffee with some milk added and no... I repeat NO Fuckin' Froth! It turns out that my "flat white" is approximately 46.2% froth... and I paid 3 whole dollars for this barista's abomination. Back in Bombay, I've had better (and more) coffee for 1/10th the price. I miss Bombay. Aww dammit... my coffee's gone cold...

      I know there's not many Fridays in the recent past that I can safely say have been necessarily good ones. But goddamn... last Friday... was the fuckin' A-Bomb! Decided to go for the  urlLink Erotica Expo 2004  at the last possible minute. I can safely say that there was more T&A than an issue of Playboy, Penthouse and Hustler combined.  The evening held store for many more delights to come. After blabbering on about Absinthe I finally decided to take the plunge into the alluring waters of La FÃ©e Verte. This was aided by the $30 bar tab I'd won at last week's pub quiz. Kim, to my suspicion, has little to no bartending training. After taking a good eternity to find the bottle, she was quite unsure on how to prepare it. Luckily, Kelly saved the day. And that's the story of how I had my first glass of Absinthe. After much research on it, I was still taken aback by the strong licorice taste. The two cubes of sugar drowned out some of the bitterness... it's probably an acquired taste. But I'm still quite intrigued and I will make it a mission to sample the good stuff next time.  Moving on to the Che Fu gig. Since I was already inside the bar a good two hours before the gig had started, I didn't have to pay the $5 cover charge. Everyone else did, and I walked around with a smirk unlike but not quite entirely the one George "Dubya" Bush wears when he's jerking off to footage of smart bombs landing in civilian areas of Baghdad.  The icing on the cake... or should I say the topping on the pizza was when I decided to bounce home early and get some dinner from Pizza Guy near my place. Got a free upgrade from a 9" pizza to a 12". I gotta get that dude some weed next time. Only a stoner would have given someone a $6 discount...

      Or so the Deftones had us believe. Finally, after what seemed to be an eternity, college is starting tomorrow, and I'm actually happy about it. One month of sitting around doing absolutely nothing... didn't quite turn out as I had planned. By the time the last week came around, I was completing Stephen King's 'The Shining' and I could feel the last vestiges of my sanity gradually slipping away, in time with the mental decline of Jack/John Torrance in the book...   And if that weren't bad enough, someone failed to inform me that it was "Let's Fuck With Ryan's Head Week." Roussel and Evans started the festivities by informing me over MSN that Evans had met a chick on the bus, who worked at Poppa Jacks. It started to sound mildly plausible until... lemme see... if I can remember correctly, she's a hot rock chick travelling on a public bus, is of half Icelandic-half Turkish origin, has a lesbian mother and step-mother, works in a heavy metal bar, was wearing an APC t-shirt and is also bi-sexual. That's not a real girl... that's a cream dream. Emphasis on dream...   Headed over to Anupam and Nandita's place later on. Apparently, she had some great news to tell me. And the great news was... that she's pregnant. Now, this wonderful piece of news would have worked if it weren't for a few small details. Like how she's so sucky at acting. And how while talking to Sarina, she totally failed to elaborate more on this. And how she supposedly found out about a week back, but still waited until I came over to actually tell me about it. And Anupam being all calm about it.  Ha. Ha. You really got me with that one.  Anyways, the real good news was that she got a new job at ASB Bank. By which time, I had wasted my initial enthusiasm at the pregnant news. Joke's on you...   And so, there are four people going about their daily routines, with the mistaken notion that they've managed to pull the wool over my eyes. I think I'll let it be that way, cause I know what it's like to have the bubble burst...

      I can't believe I'm saying this... but I seriously can't wait until college starts up again. There is only so much eating, drinking and sleeping one person can handle. Great BBQ at Denise's place this past Monday. Reluctantly took part in a couple of rounds of Singstar... the PS2 karaoke game. Then I decided... what the hell... it might actually be a little fun to further mangle an already bad song. But, there's no way I'm singing some loser pop song. Those things have a way of catching up with you later on. And so I browse... until... the most perfect choice comes up. It's a rock song alright, but it's also cheesy enough for me to dislike it.  I'm talking about the one and only "I Believe In A Thing Called Love" by The Darkness. It's the stuff that karaoke nightmares are made of. And so the song begins... dust off the once-flashy one-piece leotard catsuit... rehearse Pete Townshend's windmill technique and break out the Freddie Mercury falsettos. I'm not proud to say that I actually pulled it off quite well... at least I beat Roussel by 1500 points.  Wednesday was supposed to be Paintball day. Plans fell apart 2 minutes to midnight... quite literally. I did get the msg from Evans around that time. So, in the end, the highlights of that day turned out to be KFC, bowling, pool, air hockey, shooting arcade hoops and a very colourful display of thong. Imagine if you will, the colours magenta, violet and rouge all on a tiny piece of cloth... you'll get the picture.  Quite eventful, all in all. At least when compared relatively to my standard 24 hours of time on this revolving mass that we call Earth.

      this Bangladeshi asshole who moved next door to me out here. For reasons none other than a super-sized dose of paranoia caused by the inhalation of smoke made by combusting a certain green herb, I shall call him Jizza. It's 4 a.m. in the morning and I'm just about ready to call it a day. I decide to call it Thursday, cause it has a nice ring to it.  This motherfucker who moved in next door outta nowhere is playing the most shitty club music on his 1000W JVC system. It's naturally interfering with the mellow, yet hauntingly beautiful sounds of A Perfect Circle piped from my speakers. If anyone knows me by now, one thing I can't stand is shyte techno music. But now, there's one thing I can't stand even more than that... shyte techno music from another room overlapping my music...  At 4 a.m. in the morning... when all is quiet outside. The moon is at its brightest. There's a soft, gentle breeze wafting in through the window. The shadows in the room are subtle. And there's a paper-thin film of yellow light filtering in under the door. The song "Vanishing" begins...  "Disappear... Disappear. Higher... Higher. Into the air... slowly disappear. No... no longer here."  Yeah, someone's gonna disappear in a real hurry if they ever play their fucked up music into my room again at 4 a.m. in the goddamn morning.
