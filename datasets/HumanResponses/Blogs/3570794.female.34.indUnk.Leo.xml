       Moms, ya gotta love em and you gotta have one, but geesh! This is going overboard! My mom's lost her mind...figuratively, ofcourse. She's buying a new house...well, another house...can't for the life of me figure out why, the old house was just fine..by "just fine", I mean nobody has to do anything to it. Well, anyway, she bought another one....that must be 100 million years old!!!! Luckily, my brother is a plasterer, my husband is a painter, my youngest brother in a jack of all trades and I'm a interior designer. Lucky for her. :O)  She should have had one more kid and he could have been a carpet installer or hard wood floor refinisher. She's got all of us fixing up this house and not being very generous on the time frame..we have to finish the palstering, the painting, find a carpet installer (and the carpet), install all the bathroom fixtures, hand blinds and curtains, tile the kitchen and bathroom floors, change the kitchen cabinet arrangement and build a dog run for her 3 dogs (now that's another story all in itself!) And we have to have all this done and move her stuff in by THIS SATURDAY!!!!  I'm rolling on the floor laughing and she's looking at me so seriously its almost scarey. My family is extremely good at getting things done right and fast, but this is just a little more pressure than I'm used to. I can't wait until its over...maybe by sunday?  I can only hope...  See Ya ~ Kelli

        Is there anyone other than myself trying to market a new website? If there is, I'd love to swap suggestions and comments! In the meatime, I will remain having a conversation with myself....    Today was an eventful day. I went shopping. :O)  Ya just gotta shop every now and then!  My mom is buying a house and my husband and 2 brothers are very busy getting the house ready for her to move into next weekend..and what a chore it is! I can't wait until its done! Whew. :O)   Welp, I'll see myself later...sigh

         Today the nation buried one its most gracious Presidents. Although I was a teenager throughout most of his Presidency, I do remember his love of our country and of the people whom he served. I had always admired his strength and the love he had for his wife, Nancy.  My heart goes out to her and the family he has temporarily left behind. He will be missed........

      Whew! Well, we've managed to escaped the tornadoes this evening. Just got some heavy rain, we'll live. :O)     Speaking of living...the update on the fish situation...we have one tough little angel fish and the "sucker" fish left. Looks like a trip to the pet store is on tap for the weekend.    By the way, I've been doing what I can to promote the website. I will tell you one thing, don't EVER spend the $39.95 for Gorilla WebSite Marketing (located at gorillawebsitemarketing.com) they convince you (well, me anyway) to buy information to help get traffic to your site. If you're trying to promote your online business, don't do business with a gorilla...lol..just ask and I'll tell you what I paid nearly 40 bucks to know. :O)  ~ Kelli

      Ok, today was quite interesting...the day was going fine until all of sudden my 15 month old knocked over the torch lamp which fell into the side of the fish tank causing it to crack. Yup, you guessed it, we had a fish emergency. My 8 year old helped me bail out the water down under the crack(s). All 7 survivors were still surviving until I switched them to another tank....we have 3 fish left..for now. Its a sad day here, we've had multiple deaths.     I guess now wouldn't be a good time to put "Finding Nemo" in the dvd player...    By the way, Thanks! to whoever stopped by our website! Please say hello. :O)
