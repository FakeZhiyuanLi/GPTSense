      I've made many mistakes in my life. Most you learn from and forget but purposely setting yourself up for blackmail just because you find smearing lipstick all over your face, except for your lips, hilarious. I love acting crazy and putting on things and going all out and being someone else.  Yet in the mess of all that fun, you  must  be careful.  A simple pose, such as my Courtney Love (messed up lipstick, cheap dress with a guitar in the air, and a leg up showing the bruises you painted on) can turn from fun to the hidden camera's film posted all over the office.  Ah, so tell me, what happened to the sanctity of goofing around with out the fear of those "Linda Tripp's" out there. hehe.  Like the alliteration? That's the shared thought of the night.

         I recently went with a school group...pretty much a mix of friends I've known from different years in the past. Which made it better. In a matter of 4 days we saw everything, probably more than the average rushed New Yorker has noticed.            I'll have to admit the Broadway shows we're amazing and even more awe-inspiring than the hometown plays I grew up gazing at and dreaming(obviously).Ground Zero was ...unexplainable. I realize that I, of all people, shouldn't feel as deeply swelled with the sadness and hurt as any New Yorker but as most know it's much more than that. Other aspects were awesome, Lady Liberty, Wall Street, even the NBC Studios in which we toured the SNL set and the Conan O'Brien (oh yeah, Macy's...Times Square...many Starbucks, in which we went into as many as we could, that was great).      All in all, the zenith (rarely used word, but hey I just learned what it meant like a week ago and in order to successfully place it in ones vocabulary, one must practice) of my whole NYC experience was summed up on our last day there.  The United Nations. I never realized I would be one to go into international relations and so forth...but something so great on a young persons mind is just unstoppable.  I don't know what caught my eye so much about the UN. Maybe it was the simpleness of "We are the peacekeepers" when it was said by our guide. A place where all cultures are accepted and a place where fair and not unrulyness of politics can take over. No bribes of money, oil, land can change much of anyones ways...it seems so fair.     Along with all that running around the city, we had some odd things happen,too.  We left a lady ,in our tour group, at one of the sites for 2 hours without even noticing she wasn't on the bus or with us..ha! Man..we felt so bad though. We saw a guy get busted by the cops, I wanted to film it, but my battery was dead!

      Today is Sunday, at our church it was the Lord's Supper day.  Awesome day at church like normal. Well, I don't know if your church does this, but on The Lord's Supper you of course have your little tiny cracker/chicklet sized peices of ..something...and then after you partake in that yumminess you drink your gloriously small..as in tiny like babies having babies tiny cup of the blood of the Lord..well in other more simpler words...It's Welches Grape Juice.  So here is my statement for tonights blog, My Savior is great, He is perfect..and so you would figure that the little crackers that represent him would taste better. They should taste amazing, not that nasty cottonmouth "just got back from a Wailers concert" feeling. They could even mass produce them and use that money for missions and such, like "Christ Crisps" or something. Good flavors like cheese, tabasco, maybe even cheesy tabasco! Then again, what would be sacred about the Lord's Supper.  Much like the rest of the world today, nothing is tranquil anymore, everything is a mass produced/over publicised/stressed out mess. Simple is no longer simple.
