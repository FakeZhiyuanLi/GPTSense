      Hmm...so I decided to start my own blog... I used to hate blogs... but then I thought, why not? I know no one would read this, why would they? but I'll write it anyway, since I don't have anything else better to do... I'll try to write this whenever I have the time... until I get bored of it-ofcourse.  So, what should I write about today? hmm... lets see... Why don't I start by telling about what's been happening to me recently...? ok... first, I recently got dumped by my boyfriend. It hurt a lot! I can still feel the pain, but I'm going to be okay... (i hope) I did love that guy...i think. but then I thought, if he loves me he won't hurt me, and he did... and I don't want to be wasting my time for a guy like that. hey, I'll continue writing this later coz i really got to go....  to be continued.....

      Woohoo..!! my test is over... ! yipee. hahaha. I'm so glad it's over. I couldn't sleep last night thinking about this test...and finally, it's over! I am so relieved! Now that my nightmare is over, I can sleep well tonight.heehee.  I woke up like...5.30 am today... I had a dream that I couldn't do the test because it was too hard...but I'm glad it was only a dream...it wasn't so bad actually, I'm confident that I got 4 questions correct out of 5. That's not so bad right? I'm so happy right now... :)  So anyway, I had an extra class today...until 2.30. Went home with a cab... I was so hungry and there was nothing to eat so I fried some chips...and then watched as told by ginger, (my fav cartoon ever) tomorrow's going to be the last episode of As told by ginger! I can't wait...I've been waiting for this for so long... :) after that I watched "Stuck on you", I saw the dvd on the cofee table and since I had nothing to do, I decided to watch it. The movie is hilarious. hehe.. and then after that I watched 'the simpsons' and after the simpsons I watched my fav new soap opera...Mi Gorda Bella, aka my sweet valentina. Whoaa....I didn't realise I spent the whole day watching TV!  So here I am writing about what I did today... I guess that's all.... write more soon.  :)

      Hey...this is a song from my fav cartoon series, As Told By Ginger. I don't know the real lyrics for this song, but I think it goes like this...  It's kind of sad really, Guess I'm the sort who'll linger, When the credits roll, I still can't leave a picture, The picture I hold... In my heart...  It makes me mad really, Wish I could blame a twister, Or a hurricane, Or my pesky sister, Wish I could blame away this feeling, In my heart...  There's a road that's left to travel, There are bridges left to burn, There's song I haven't written, Lessons left to learn... There are reasons left to fight, There's you to kiss goodnight, So hold on...Hold on tight...  It makes me mad really, Wish I could blame a twister, Or a hurricane, Or my pesky sister, Wish I could blame away this feeling, In my heart...  It's not bad really, It's just a tiny splinter, Like a stubborn leaf, In the dead of winter, A tiny splinter, In my heart...  Hey if anyone knows the real lyrics to this song, please send it to me... Would really appreciate that!

      It looks like it's going to rain today...ahh...I'm so bored right now. I wish there was something interesting for me to do... I'm sick of studying... I want to do something fun and exciting... anyway, I don't think I'll be writing much today, and I won't be continuing my story on my recent breakup... writing about it makes me feel worse. What's done is done right? I just want to forget about everything and start a new life.  Yesterday the whole family sat down together and watched Akademi Fantasia like we always do... yeah, Saturday nights-8.30 pm. :) Linda was voted out yesterday, it's so sad coz she really does have a great voice... If she stays, there is a chance she could win the competition... but I want Zahid to win coz I love Zahid!! haha... If the good ones are voted out, the chances for Zahid to win is pretty high-not that he's not good. Zahid could win even if there's a great competition... coz he's one of the talented ones. He's funny too... Love him, love him.  Okay okay, enough about Akademi Fantasia.... I have a test tomorrow... haven't studied that much...hope I do well!  I guess that's all for today... I'll write more soon... :)
