      ok, so I was trying to figure out when and where the years have gone. I go out to the bar with friends and am completely bored. Sure talking and finding out what's going on in everyone's lives are great to hear, but not only do I not have the money to spend on alcohol (very overpriced, by the way! but I'm not drinking, cause I'm driving), I now start watching other people at the bar, and wonder; do they know that they are acting so dum, then I feel really old, like a mom. Don't get me wrong I enjoy getting a good buzz, but would rather be at someone's home (spending less and able to crash if needed). So now I feel old. yes it's good to be and act responsible, but what happened to the carefree years? did I even have them? hmm... anonymous - Thanks for your comments. I hear EXACTLY what you mean. believe me I have said the same things to myself. (moving on) sometimes I wish I had a magic drug that could erase memories / feelings / hate. just to forget it all, cause right now all I think of is the bad and feel that all guys will be the same, that there is no hope for the future. and did I mention that I'm getting (feeling) old (almost 27! eww)!? ugh! well we will see how tonight goes, I'm going out (some friends have flown in), I may even drink! maybe even dance?! ugh (can I shave off a million pounds first?) Wish me luck! :)

      Come on that's not excitement, that is just "hammerhead" (name fits him) being a little child. I don't think some boys ever grow up. They just keep lying and cheating and believing in their own make believe world. I live in the real world, where you get an education to start a career, find a mate, get married and together make children. If you want to be childish with name calling, fine I can be just as mean: some of your life plans weren't put into that typical order now were they? you know, get married THEN.. (or at least with your girlfriend, you supposedly only love). keep on living it up. are you having fun yet? You push me, what, did you expect me to sit back cry and let you say what you want? I told you before that this was my page and my voice, I didn't use your name or start calling you little names. Or did I use anything too personal, to hurt you. If you don't like what you see, don't look. How many times have you lied and cheated and then cried to me that you were so wrong, I'm the only one you love.. blah blah.. then oh look there you are again, sticking it to another new chicky and lying to me all over again. I wasn't planning on getting mad or acting like a bitch, but you pushed me a lil too far. Some day when someone does everything to you that you have done to me, then you will know what it was like and how much I just sat back and attempted to believe you, as you lied right to my face. yep that's love. HA. and so I felt perfectly fine with what I wrote about my mom, (I have the right to feel anyway about her) but, YOU constantly complained: I needed to vent, so I did. if it helps make you more of a man to "cut me" or call me names, oh well, that just reassures me of you. Anyway it really didn't make any since or have anything to do with the topic, but I guess that makes you feel better about yourself.

      I just wanted to give a little info.  Mom is back in the hospital (eww, HATE hospitals!) so she has a "procedure" to go through this afternoon, and was thinking it would be really cool if everyone / anyone would just think in some positive way (or wish, or pray - if you do that.)I just don't want the outcome to be bad. And to those out there, you know who you are, it was nice of you to pretend to care for the moment. I know you have your attitude prob and think that everyone is below you, just because people are fat, or don't take care of themselves. well how does that involve you? it doesn't. If its a smell issue then don't breathe, if its a sight issue, then don't look. OUR parents, are OUR parents. A person can say anything they want of feel anyway about their  OWN  parents, its their right, but if anyone else has an issue; too fat, smelly, etc. then thats your probelm and I nor anyone else wants to hear it. Its just rude. If you can look in the mirror a find no problem or flaw then, maybe then, you can have your opinion, otherwise keep it to yourself.  have another one.

      ok eft- well that was Sunday, I think I was watching Law an Order Criminal Intent!! woo hoo! I love Goren (I think his named is spelled that way) he is just so wacky and intelligent (I know there is no such man like that but, he would be my dream man!)awwww..(know anyone?? hee hee) So, I am now taking Trimspa (from Walmart) and I LOVE the energy, it feels like I am the energizer bunny rabbit!!! I did all my homework (online stuff)within 6 hours (it was alot of stuff too!) normally I would have done it last min and complained, but I have the power or trimspa!! I will lose the fat! I wanna go to the zoo, who wants to go with me? ok, well I write more later gotta take a shower before I go out! being sinky is only fun when your alone.

      Ok so I'm am so excited. I am gonna do a blog and talk about dum, stuff (if I knew cool stuff it would be cool, but I don't so I'm gonna talk about dum stuff). I know everyone will enjoy everything I have to say!! So to start, why is it that the News only cuts in to "inform" us with useless stuff ONLY when your favorite show is on? not during the 20 minutes of commercials?? of course it was during a very intense interesting part too. anyway, I just got an opportunity to do some work for a friend of professor! I'm excited it has been such a long time since I had seen money. And I may also have a GREAT chance of getting a really good job too (I don't want to jinx it, so that is all about that, for now!) I am taking summer classes, Microsoft is cool. I am terrified for the other one (theology), it doesn't start till June 7. Religion classes and teachers scare me! Help! Why do people (boys) cheat? I am really starting to believe it is a disease of some sort, or maybe even an heredity thing.? I don't know, but it sucks. oh well, talk later. :)

      I love to always put things off till last minute.. I hate it, it must stop. Ok, right after I finish this post.. hee hee. So I was able to put off turning in my paper / presentation till NEXT wednesday! but still haven't really started it... The topic is kinda interesting, but not something I would like to write a paper on (ordained catholic women). I will do it, last min of course. I don't like summer classes. Hey KZ and Bitr when are you guys ever free?? we need to go out, get away, just relax, no hubby, kids, or anyone that needs you. Just sit back and breathe. oh, and no painful shoes. Ugly ones are ok. Have a good night, and take a chance K, I have, with no regrets. :)  Loveya :x

      The world looks anew. I can see sun shine and hear laughter, and it is mine that I hear. I had been in a cold dark place for so long, hiding from the sun and what the world could offer me. Thank you for letting me go and allowing me to see that there is a bigger and better world out there for me.   urlLink Bitter  - I can't wait!! are you free this saturday? We can start then, since I'm going out already for H's b-day.  I haven't felt this good in a LONG time! Love. I have so much to give to someone deserving. I can't wait. :)

      I know everyone can say I told you so, but I felt that it was right for us to be together and I thought we were meant to be. Guess I was wrong. Well HH and Diablo6 are together now as they both had wished. All I can do is wish them luck and say goodbye, for my heart cannot take anymore pain or sorrow. Eights years gone. She does write some beautiful loving riddles for him read here: HH's  urlLink Halloween  posting.

      When the sun stops shining and There's only me left, alone in the dark No one can see me cry, for there isn't any Love left for me From his heart for  Him and I to grow upon. It's always been known the ending will come, but only Time is what we had. For I will be forgotten, as he has given up on Me and the sun. All there is left To do is feel my heart Stop hurting inside and become numb.

      So as some of you may know, that saga continues. Long story, don't roll your eyes. It just feels meant to be for me. anyway... I wanted everyone to know that I gave HH a proposition.. no not that you sickos!! many of you also know that both of us have not so healthy life styles so.. I proposed that if I lose 50 pounds (greatly needed to do), HH will have to quit smoking  COMPLETELY . Tell me that isn't a win win situation?! I am going to write up the proposal and everything will be documentated. When I had brought it up to HH, he was more than willing to participate. So I will be accepting any help with dieting you have, also auditioning to be my personal cheerleader, to cheer me on!!!   D uck isn't the only bad four letter word!

      Life is never explained to you when your growing up needing answers. Then all of a sudden everyone wants to give you their views.. But then you think isn't it only  your  life? The truth is, it's not your life, but all the lives of those that surround you that can influence you to grow or can disenegrate and kill you.  The choice  is  yours to make.

      What happened to time heals all wounds?  I don't believe it, cause anything that has happened to you never feels better or changes with time. Even little things; I caught a cold, and it has been a few days do I feel any better, heck no! I have re-started working out (since the hurt back stuff last year), and does it feel any better, NO! I turned my back on a VERY long relationship, do I feel any better, NO. The pain is still there, the anger, the emotions; sadness, weakness, madness... all in one bundle growing inside. And yet I think were did  I  go wrong? what did I ever do in life to hurt like this?          How much time does it take to heal?

       Hello all, I will be off again; working / house / pet sitting for the rest of the week, so no posts from me, I know, I know you are all upset, don't worry I'll be back soon and all will be well! Hee hee!    Eft and Teflon, I hope you are having a great time, and I hope to see you soon.    My vacation is coming up soon!!! I can't wait! I miss planes :(    Well I'm gonna go watch a movie and then go to work.. yea... soon even better!!! (I just filled out all the paper-work today!!!! Next comes uniform fitting!!!!!!!!!!!!)    Gimme a call if ya wanna chat, otherwise I'll see ya later!    by the way, ** Movie review **      Cold Mountain  - it was a bit long, but interesting. I do think it was more of a chick flick even with the civil war involved. I'd give it a 3 an 1/2 * out of 5.     Butterfly Effect  - WAS AWESOME! I loved it, I don't really care much for Ashton, but the movie was great. You have to watch both endings, completely different!! 5*     Last samurai  - was actually pretty good, there were some parts that dragged, or seemed dum, but overall was watchable. I don't like Tom but he did ok (always acts the same in every movie).  T hey&nbsp;needed more effect fighting, rather then anticipating the big fight.&nbsp;3 1/2*    That's all for now, Cya all later! Love ya! :)

Seems like a good age to stay at for awhile!! Don't you think so?! My saying of the day: Happiness is in a cup of tea on a cool summer morn, as the sun rises and  brings forth life. Look at the world you see now, its filled with so much hope and love for those deserving of it. :)

      Ok. HH you need to stop any type of contact with me. You made the decision to move on and date someone else, so go do it. Stop calling and texting me or asking my friends what I am up to or who are my new friends. It is no longer any of your business. You made your choice, now live with it. I feel really bad for your girlfriend, I hope she reads this and sees that you will always be a liar, cheat and will keep hurting people. You enjoy trying to bring up emotions in people, the problem is you have HURT me so much that, yes, I do hate you. Stop calling, stop trying to tell me that you love me and always will.. its bullshit. You had a VERY odd way of ever showing it, having sex with other people, while being in a relationship with me and lying to me, was that how you show you love someone? You do not know what the word is, and probably never will, nor do I care anymore. No I am not writing this with hopes to get back together, I am DONE, FINISHED. You have killed any chances. A friend had asked me, if I had the chance to tell your next girlfriend what KZ SHOULD'VE told me 8 years ago, I would tell her to " run, as fast and far as possible and don't look back." Regarding you car, I am not some little adolescent that needs to get back at you, I have moved on and have more important things to do in my life then to do something so immature, take a look at who else you have screwed over, it wasn't me, my family or friends. You really need some therapy, you are really messed up inside and will keep hurting other people, including your new girlfriend. I wonder how she would feel knowing what you were texting me with last night and that you wanted me to "save your soul," which is impossible for anyone to do. So move on, forget me, like you have before, and stop trying to hurt me more. GOOD BYE.

      I love people that lie and are fake. Those are who I surround myself with. Well I'm done, it's sad, but no more will I tolerate from these so called "friends." Wonder if they even know what the word means. Have a nice time, thanks for faking and pretending, enjoy. I almost believed some of the things you have said to me, and what you wound do or never do.

      Did you ever get that feeling when you wished there was more time in a day to do something, or have something last longer, but at the SAME time, think "dam this day is just dragging on." I really hate it when it seems that it is only REALLY nice beautiful weather outside, when you have to go to work or when you have the day off, but no one else is free! whats with that!!! It's crazy I tell ya!  I think this is gonna be a great month thats what I feel! Anyone that I won't see (KZ and fam, EFT & Teflon (mom too), BITR) have a great fourth of July, if you crave any of my famous jello come on by! Be safe and have fun! Love ya!! Wish me luck! :)

      I'm at a loss for the words that I would like to say, but I will try. I am finally moving on with my life. I have finally had some good things happen to me emotionally, physically and financially. I have lost some good friends in the process of    your    choice and continue to lose them because of so, and I must also move on from that too. But yet   you   must keep drudging up everything by texting, calling, emailing or instant messaging me? I now know that   you   like to bring misery into peoples lives by what   you   keep currently doing to me.   You   made the choice to cheat and screw around,   you   made the choice to tell me to my face that all I was to   you   was a fu*k,   you   made the choice to be with someone else. So I am not in anyway of   your   life. I am not calling, texting or emailing   you  .   You   wanted to move on, so LET ME. All   you   are proving by texting, emailing, calling me is that   you   have no feelings nor care for ANYONE, not only for what it does to me, but what about   your   girlfriend?! I am single and it is perfectly ok for me to be signed on to American Singles or any other online singles profile, but that does not mean it is ok for   you   to be emailing me or instant messaging me thru them. I don't (nor I necessarily care) think   your   girlfriend would like to see   you   online there searching for singles, or even to see what   your   profile says   you   are looking for, disgusting. All I ask is once again, STOP, leave me alone, this is what   you   wanted, so live it.
