            Like in - what is there to be ashamed of?       I have been reading in 2 Timothy today - a small but significant letter - the last one of the Apostle Paul - languishing in a prison dungeon      Verse 8: So do not be ashamed to testify about our Lord, or ashamed of me His prisoner.&nbsp; But join with me in suffering for the Gospel by the power of God      Lord, make me bold for Your Name's sake - the world takes pride in such shameful acts - why should I not take pride in the most wonderful Person in the universe?&nbsp; Can I thank you enough for all Your love      What a relationship!

       urlLink    Wife and babysitter tag team to tackle the man of the house.  Let me see...a few things I can comment on here. Here is my lovely with our friend Sarah (Sarwilly.blogspot.com). Just after the hockey game - (just wanting to see who the Flames are going to pound into the ground) So, they were making fun of me - they are actually preparing for Sunday school (what love I must admit) in making little booklets for 10 kids... I think Kim is trying to publish a novel (always over the top) and Sarahwah needs some help gluing paper (she puts the paper on top of the glue stick instead of turnig the paper upside down and gluing)  Anyhow, they were making fun and I decided to threaten them with a blog entry - being true to my word (And trusting the Lord He will bless their efforts in the meantime)  Sarah - I changed the spelling!

      This is great  After some amazing negotiating tactics and moral support from my buddy Jim, we are off to war with the permission of my 'lovely' (what a wonderful wife I have!)  Paint ball at Marshall's - time to take some frustration out on those generation I boyz - who think the world is nothing but a big video game...  What to wear...

      Interesting how I stumbled across this page - I was on the BBC News site (I am an international news buff) and of course, the technology section (my home page) had a very interesting blip.  Front and centre in all his glory was Bill Gates stating blogging and business was an ok mix.  I couldn't resist - out I went to check it out (what the heck is blogging?). http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/3734981.stm  After a few searches on who was hosting, and little time to spend (since I was at work) I decided with Google cause they are big and innovative and at present, the underdog.  I figure you can't go wrong.  So here goes - I am hoping it will catch   Enjoy!
