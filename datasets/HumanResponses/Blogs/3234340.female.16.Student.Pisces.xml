      AHHH!! Ok... somedays I wonder why i even have a drivers licence seeing as  i never get to drive anywhere besides school and mat's house when its clear outside.  The drama party is tonight and I want to drive myself there. It's at mat's dad's shop and its not like i've never been there before. I've just never driven there before.  not to mention, i have a freaking map!! BUT as i said i've never driven there before and its wet outside so the rents dont wanna let me drive myself. This is sooooo STUPID!!!!! I have a licence. LET ME USE IT!!!! if they dont let me drive now they're never gunna! that pisses me off so bad!

      I'm so tired today, and I really don't know why. I just want to go to bed, but I promised Caryn I would come to her spring concert tonight.*sigh* I'm not sure Mom's going to let me go though. I think she's kinda worried about the weather, which is understandable. The weather is pretty bad and I don't like driving in the rain..so yeah.. I understand. I still really hope she lets me go though. I really wanna see mat tonight too. I like barely see him at school. I hate the end of the school year. Everything is so chaotic. With graduation and everything, i don't know how we ever get everything done. Not the mention, at the end of the year the food at school sucks, because they don't restock anyhtign after they run out of it... but anyways.. I love Mat so much. I can't believe we've been goin out for almost 10 months. That's a REALLY long time for me.. Other people don't think its that big of a deal, but I think its huge. I just really hope we stay together for a really really long time and stay all happy and stuff...

      Ya know what? sometimes i really hate having a boyfriend. I feel so cut off from the world... but i guess its partially my fault. My friends never invite me anywhere bc they automatically assume im out with mat. If they were to invite me somewhere i'd most likely go, and maybe i'd even bring mat along... but i guess they just figure we already have plans.. which is usually far from the truth. We're so indecisive we usually dont know what we're gunna do until last minute and we usually end up goin to eat and to a movie or i end up goin over to his house.. how fun and interesting huh? I dunno i guess i just see all my friends goin out and havin fun and they assume i cant bc im most likely doin somethin with mat. I wish they would just ask every once in a while. i mean they know how ppl can get when theyre datin someone. *sigh*

      I slept for a really long time today, but that could be due to staying up until like 5 this mornin...i stayed online until 330 talkin to Corey Carter, which was kinda weird seeing as me and him don't even get along half the time.. but it was pretty kool. It was a weird convo, but we won't go there.. Yet again let me express how much I miss Mat..I don't know if I'm gunna hold up until sunday, bc right now that seems soooooooooooooo far away! But, this trip has made me realise how much he really does mean to me, so i guess it hasnt been all that bad.. but i wish i could be there with him. when i talked to him yesterday I could hear in his voice how much he really missed me. It was soooo sweet,but i hate hearin him like that.

      Mat called me again today, but today it was international.. that is like REALLY expensive! I think that's the last time I'll hear from him until Saturday, bc he'll be at sea for the next 2 days. I miss him so much! It made me soo happy to talk to him yesterday, but it just kinda depressed me to talk to him today, because its still gunna be soo long until i get to see him, or at least soo long in my world. Gah, I must sound crazy, or obsessed, or something, but I'm just in love..hmm...i unno. This week has just been dragging by...at least tom me and ashley are gunna go do something... that'll at least get me outta the house besides babysitting, which i might add, i am dreading friday! i like them right after they wake up and after lunch, thats when they're easiest to deal with, but its not like i can just quit because i dont like it.. i agreed to do it and at least i get paid for it...

      This week is gunna be the longest week ever!!! I miss Mat soooooooo much!! He called me today! YAY!!!! we talked for a little while. In the past 5 days I think I've talked to him for about 45 minutes, and its killing me!!!! I know I sound pitiful, but I really love Mat and I don't know what to do with myself when he's not here. But, I guess I'm gunna have to learn, because he's goin off to college after this year...

      Ok, I change my mind.. I love having a boyfriend...or at least I love having Mat as my boyfriend.I really don't know what I would do without him.  Thursday I really realised how much he means to me, and how much we're really supposed to be together. He left on his cruise friday. He's going to be gone for 9 days. That doesn't seem like that long when you say it, but I hate having to spend even 1 day without him. It took us like 15 minutes to say goodbye thursday, not to mention I started to cry because I miss him so much. I'm soo pitiful. I hope we never breakup, and at this point in the relationship those chances are extremely slim to none. We've been together for about 10 and a half months. That's a record by far for me. This is going to be a REALLY long week, but at least Ashley is home so me and her can go do stuff....
