      Hey guys! You can go here to find out how I am doing especially when you haven't talked to me in a while. I intend to leave a little about how I am doing in with my useless blogs I would like you to comment on. Here is the first useless blog I want comments on. It is a topic that I would like a little help with: I will most likely be asking this really cool girl that I know pretty well now to be my girlfriend. Here is the problem: As Christians, since we will not be doing anything inappropriate, or sexual, if you will, is there any other reason to date in the first place as teenagers except by name only (girlfriend/boyfriend)? Topic: Teen dating, right or wrong; teen dating, useless or full of meaning? Please comment, and have a great day!  God bless!  -Mike

      Well guys, this is the first entry into my new and progressing blogger thanks to my very very good friend Steve Bergey. I just got back from an extended day of work at Wendy's. You all know I'm working at Wendy's until college, right? I am so tired in mental anguish from all of the hard decisions made, and physical anguish from all of the hard bathrooms cleaned. Unfortunately, they make me clean all of the bathrooms because I do so well... seriously. I was on register today, which is a high step up. It's pretty cool. Well now it is everyone's chance to respond. Hit the little link to make a comment. I will be back AT LEAST once a day to see what is written. Peace!

      Well, I finally figured out how to use my new blogger. Sorry Guys! Um, nothing much happening today. Since my last message on my former blog page, I have been going out with this really cool girl named Brittany, also a Christian. I see her tomorrow actually. Anyway, leave a message. The next blog I should have something cool to respond to and try to cause conversations! I should post at least once daily. See you all later! E-mail me: OriolesFan2001@hotmail.com

      My question about the Dixie Chicks was supposed to include a quote from Martie saying that they believed they were "not supported by the genre," but I didn't include the "not." Imagine it is there. Thanks!  In Christ, Mike

      Everybody may know that Monday (Oct. 20th) is the happy birthday to me day. Well, my girlfriend Brittany had a huge surprise for me she has been planning for a while, with a romantic dinner she cooked just the two of us, presents, dancing, and all kinds of things. It was so sweet. She and her aunt picked me up at 3:00, and I got home about midnight. It was so cool.   Anyway, here is what I have to ask everyone: The Dixie Chicks left country music because they are "supported by the genre," in the words of Martie, the steel guitarist/banjo player. Now why on earth would the "F.U.T.K." girls think that? Did they think nobody saw the "Without Me" video and the Entertainment Weekly cover? What do you think? Country music is supposed to be more wholesome.  In Christ, Mike  "Wait for the Lord; be strong and take heart and wait for the Lord." - Psalm 27:14 NIV

      Okay, I want everyone to comment on my not so normal day. I go to Edgewood High School. After first period in school today I was walking down the hall and I stopped to pick up some trash. Well, I never had trash say "Open Immediately." The curiosity in me made me open it. What I saw when I opened it was a bomb threat to the school. It read, "There is a bomb in the school. It will go off at 11:30. It will be funny to watch you die." After I read it, and went through two periods, I turned it in. The principal, Mr. Schmitz, called me to his office to ask me questions about it. He evacuated the school entirely for almost an hour, from 11:05-11:45 to make sure there was no bomb. It was in fact, a prank, as I knew the whole time. To make sure I was right in the situation, I turned it in anyway. A letter was sent to all the parents of all the students detailing the situation, including all the measures they went through to protect the students and to draw leads as to who wrote the note, and the drastic punishments to the perpetrators. It was kind of embarrassing, but I am glad I did the right thing. What a day, huh? I promise to start writing more.  In Christ, Mike  "Then He said to them all, 'If anyone would come after me, he must deny himself and take up his cross daily and follow me. '" -Luke 9:23 NIV

      I still need to get used to blogging everyday and checking this thing. Colin, as soon as I am done here, I will look at your page. Any friend of Steve's (AKA Mark lol) is a friend of mine. Keep coming back I guess. Okay, I have a question, friends. If I got into an argument with my girlfriend's friend about how she treats my girlfriend, and I am right, and was totally honest but yet nicer than most people would be, and yet her friend keeps twisting my words and trying to get me in trouble with Brittany, though it doesn't work,  should I apologize to her anyway? Her friend thinks I should, but Brittany thinks I shouldn't, and nobody cares if the friend (left unnamed in respect) and I do not get along. Should I apologize if I am right? What do you all think? More tomorrow. Probably about a different subject.  In Christ, Mike  But the LORD said to Samuel, "Do not consider his appearance or his height, for I have rejected him. The LORD does not look at the things man looks at. Man looks at the outward appearance, but the LORD looks at the heart." - 1 Samuel 16:7 NIV

      I finally learned how to work everything. You'd think I was 800 years old, huh, Mark? Well now all systems are go! My next post will be something going on in my life that creates a nice topic of discussion for the day. I will also have a Bible passage of the day under my signature everyday. Please be respectful to others, be brief if possible, and please remember it is not a chat room. Otherwise, have fun. This is as much for my friends as it is for me. I will be back several times a day to respond to what I see. Please comment! Anyway, talk to you all later! Tell your friends this is where I am!

      :( No one's commenting. Me sad. Anyway, um, how was everyone's Thanksgiving? Mine was w00t'd as usual! We had all kinds of family over, and more food than anyone will ever eat. We also had a new treat- sparkling apple cider. Now that's the stuff! (No, not Hostess!!!) Anyway, I have had trouble finding really good time to blog all the time. I am starting to budget my time a lot better and I should have the time.  Anyway, talk to you all soon! Blog ya later! Please comment!   In Christ, Mike

      Nothing to blog about today except the fact that Mark has a new page that we should share. On his old page, www.stephenbergey.com, he has a new chat forum everyone should become a member of. I will spend a lot of time there because I am the moderator of most of the topics. If there is a thread or post I deem offensive, bye bye. I can also talk Mark into suspending your registration. But I am lenient, so have fun! Just don't offend the viewers badly! Insults are okay, just watch it! Anyway, blog ya later!

      Sorry it's been a while since I blogged last! My time has been limited... as in none. Between homework, a girlfriend I talk on the phone with a lot, and All-County Chorus practices, time has been limited. Homework has cut down a lot, and now All-County Chorus is over. It just finished today. Tonight was the performance. I just got back from it. There are pictures. I will have them for you soon. I am also going to put on a song or two (maybe all six) from our performance when the CD comes in. I don't know how many people know how it is to sing in front of a thousand people (even with 84 other people). I know Mark does, because he sings with his family in front of many church groups.  Anyway, in commenting, mention something you've done in front  of a group of people and how many people were possibly there, where and when. Blog ya later! I promise to do better!

      I don't have long to blog because I am looking into the anonymous guy on  urlLink FCG  and  urlLink Brit's page  and my own that is offending our religion. Please check out the Christian fish and flag on my frame to the right and hold your mouse over it for my favorite quote that goes with it. The flag should wave if you see it right. The Christian fish is almost identical to my pure silver ring I got from my girlfriend Brittany with the fish on it.   Anyway, about the quote, I'm sure you are all wondering! I learned the quote from Mr. Naegeli. He learned it in Africa in the peace corps. "Wisdom is like the baobab tree.  No one can embrace it all. " That's the end of the quote: No one can embrace it all. It basically means: As the baobab tree is way too big to embrace, so is wisdom, but stretch to do so anyway.  Blog ya later!

      I am glad you enjoy my blog. I am also glad Shaun Groves is your favorite singer. I love his CD Invitation to Eavesdrop. Mark is good too though... ha ha.... Anyway, let me know some things about you. My contact info is on the side frame if you want to chat sometime too. Come back soon and comment again.  In Christ, Mike  P.S.: Can anyone finish the quote? Comment to this if you know the end of the quote: "Wisdom is like the Baobab tree..."

      First and foremost, to the person who cowardly did not sign their comment, there was no "In Christ" because I was in a hurry. That does not change the intensity of my faith and my passionate love for God. By the way, please do not be a coward and not sign your comment. That makes what you have to say really unimportant, because obviously you don't have the guts to stand behind your comment, thus making it so invalid you don't understand.  Let me, like Mark, politely ask: Who the heck are you man? Why can you not believe in the divinity of Christ? How can you disprove it? We live by faith, not by sight. (2 Corinthians 5:7 NIV) Frankly, man, you seem really psycho the way you are going about this.  Second, please comment.... I got one comment. A comment would be so nice sometimes. Maybe I need to find some ways to publicize my page. Any ideas? Let me know. Blog ya later!   In Christ,  Mike  "We live by faith, not by sight. " -2 Corinthians 5:7 NIV  Today's Quote:  Welcome Home by Shaun Groves from Invitation to Eavesdrop  Take, me, make me All You want me to be That's all I'm asking, all I'm asking  Welcome to this heart of mine I've buried under prideful vines Grown to hide the mess I've made  Inside of me Come decorate, Lord  Open up the creaking door And walk upon the dusty floor Scrape away the guilty stains Until no sin or shame remain  Spread Your love upon the walls And occupy the empty halls Until the man I am has faded No more doors are barricaded  Chorus: Come inside this heart of mine It's not my own Make it home Come and take this heart and make it All Your own Welcome home  Take a seat, pull up a chair Forgive me for the disrepair And the souvenirs from floor to ceiling Gathered on my search for meaning  Every closet's filled with clutter Messes yet to be discovered I'm overwhelmed, I understand I can't make this place all that You can  repeat chorus  I took the space that You placed in me Redecorated in shades of greed And I made sure every door stayed locked Every window blocked, and still You knocked  repeat chorus

      Well, a little has happened since I last blogged. I went over Brittany's house and we hung out for a long time on Saturday. She gave me two cards and a sterling silver ring with a Christian fish on it, from His Way, a Christian store. It's a really cool looking ring, and obviously not the cheap plastic kind. She also gave me a Veggie Tales plaque to hang up on my wall. These were all for our three month anniversary. We alway know exactly what to get each other because we know each other so well.   Here's a question: What was the best present you ever traded with someone else? Gotten? Received? Why?  Blog ya later!

      Well, I guess blogging every other day is good. I had no time on my hands yesterday because I had All-County Chorus practice for hours. It went pretty well. The tenor group, which I am part of, sounds really good. I think I do pretty well.   Tell me: What talents do you all have? Do you sing, do you dance? Do you stand on your head and chant while spitting nickels? Whatever you can do, tell me about it! Blog ya later!

      Well, I remembered to blog today. Maybe I'll get better with doing this thing. Someday I'll write everyday!   Anyway, I am so nervous because I have my first practice for All-County Chorus tomorrow. In case you don't know, I made All-County Chorus as a tenor, which puts the best singers of all the Harford County high schoolers together for a concert, which must mean I'm good. At the auditions, I was even more nervous, but now it's bad too. I have to sing two songs in different languages, one in German, one in Russian. The rest are in English. The only song I am familiar with is "Sing Praise to God With One Accord," the audition song.   Anyway, here's something to talk about: What kind of television interests everyone the most? I find that mysteries and sitcoms are the best. I used to like more stuff on The WB, but now all I like are 7th Heaven, Everwood, Smallville, Gilmore Girls, and an occasional Reba episode. What do you all watch? Tell me a little about yourselves in the process too. Visitors are definately welcome to comment. Make yourselves right at home. Have fun, blog you later!

      Well, your "responsible" friend is back to blog. In case I don't blog again, Merry Christmas, Happy New Year, Happy Year 2050, you know... lol... Anyway, what did I miss since last time? I am officially 17 years of old... lol... and it feels pretty good. I had a party at my house with just family and a couple close friends. My two best friends Vernon and Steve (aka Mark) and my girlfriend Brittany and our good friend Britney were all invited. Only "Mark" and Brittany could make it. It was fun. There are lots of pictures Mark took. Most are of Brittany and I, and a little of Mark. Maybe I'll try to find a way to link to some. Anyway, comment on these two things: NFL championships this year: Who's your pick? Also, MLB champs next year, tell us who and why. See you everyday from now on!

      I have two movies I just saw. I got that DVD player, so I spent some time watching a couple movies. I love scary movies and thrillers.  Final Destination , The Game  and  The Omega Code  are awesome thrillers. Has anyone seen  28 Days Later  and  Abandon ?   Frankly,  28 Days Later  is the dumbest thing I have ever seen in my life. It wasn't scary, tried to seriously defy biology, and was so full of cussing that I couldn't stand it. I bought it from Hollywood Video (yes, BOUGHT not RENTED), but threw it away it was so stupid and annoying. It makes no sense, by the time you get the hang of the idea, you're too far into the storyline, and at the end, it leaves so many questions unanswered and doesn't make sense. It's also not scary! I hated it.    Abandon  was actually pretty good and worth keeping. Overall, one of my favorite actresses is Katie Holmes, who stars in this thriller. (I wasn't happy about hearing that she had a topless scene in  The Gift , but what can you do? I can't change what she'll do for money!) At first, the movie kind of seems like it's a WB show, you know, just a show with a storyline, but at the end it gets really good and shows you how the main character is more than meets the eye: a crazy psychopathic freak. You may be disappointed in the movie at first, but it gets good eventually. There was too much sexuality, but I am able to tune that out and focus on the movie most often, so it was okay. If you can handle the sexuality and not let it change you during the movie, I recommend it. Although I've seen more sexuality in the hallways of my old school, a   Christian   school, so it's not too bad. Overall, good movie.   Now to my question: What are good thrillers and scary movies that you all have seen? I am always coming up short and not getting the best ones. Keep in mind that movies with milder sexuality and less cussing are so much more appreciated. I almost always read a lot of reviews to make sure what I am about to watch is "doctrinally acceptable," but for some reason for these last two movies I just watched them with no regard to what kind of themes they portrayed. I do recommend  Abandon . Whatever you do, do NOT watch  28 Days Later . It's so dumb and the themes are so unethical. I have seriously learned a lesson, and I will be keeping tabs on what I watch a  lot  harder. God has taught me a valuable lesson this time around.  (Also, my other favorite kind of movie is comedy.  Master of Disguise  was awesome. So basically you either need to scare me poopless or make me bust a gut laughing. Sorry to put that so picturesque!)  Anyway, let me know what you think. Comment me!

      I know it's been a while since I posted. I hope everyone is having a merry Christmas holiday season. My season has consisted of nothing but working and homework. It'll be a lot better! How has yours been?   I sang the coolest song in chorus a couple days ago. It's a parody off of The Twelve Days of Christmas. It's not in the original tune of the song at all. When I find a recording of the song, I will post that too. Here, read:  ------------------------------------------------------------ The first day after Christmas  My true love and I had a fight  And so I chopped the pear tree down  And burnt it, just for spite   Then with a single cartridge  I shot that blasted partridge   My true love, my true love, my true love gave to me.    The second day after Christmas   I pulled on the old rubber gloves  And very gently wrung the necks  Of both the turtle doves  My true love, my true love, my true love gave to me.    On the third day after Christmas  My mother caught the croup  I had to use the three French hens  To make some chicken soup    The four calling birds were a big mistake  For their language was obscene  The five golden rings were completely fake   and turned my fingers green.    The sixth day after Christmas  The six laying geese wouldn't lay  So I sent the whole darn gaggle to the A.S.P.C.A.    On the seventh day, what a mess I found  The seven swans-a-swimming all had drowned   The eighth day after Christmas  Before they could suspect  I bundled up the  Eight maids-a-milking  Nine ladies dancing  Ten lords-a-leaping  Eleven pipers piping  Twelve drummers drumming - well, actually I kept one of the ladies... And sent them back collect    I wrote my true love  "We are through, love!"  And I said in so many words  "Furthermore your Christmas gifts were for the  (Soprano part only) Birds!"    (Everyone else in the original tune) Four calling birds,   Three french hens,  Two turtle doves  And a partridge in a pear tree. -------------------------------------------------------------------------  Isn't that funny? We were all laughing hysterically. Anyway, let me know what you have to say. I have to shut up now so I can leave. Blog ya later!  In Christ, Mike <>

      I thought I would tell everybody about my day yesterday. I went shopping with my girlfriend Brittany at Columbia Mall, and we had a time limit, so it was really stressful for her. We got some cool stuff for the loved ones in our lives. Somehow, I was able to get two things for Brittany WITH HER THERE! Amazing, huh? I know, you're asking, "How did you do it?" All I can say is, "I am very very sneaky, sir." (From the butler on  Mr. Deeds ) During lunch I bought one and was able to hide it and she didn't find out what it was, and the other I bought when she was away from me for even 20 seconds. (Think Britt, think!) I have so much fun being very very sneaky! Oh well. I got her four things (or technically three the way you look at it). DUDE! I'm good! I'm not being egotistical! I just know how to be honest! Comment me: How is your Christmas shopping coming? Please comment! Blog ya later!  In Christ, Mike <>   urlLink Hear this song!  "It's the time to show the world we're strong, we won't be terrorized. Evil's not allowed to win when you've got Heaven on your side. It's for the ones we've lost that we stand up strong today, 'cause the flag still stands for freedom, and they won't take that away.  And we're standing strong as Americans, where at least we know we're free, And we won't forget the ones who died on that Tuesday morning. And we're going to stand up and see it through and defend her still today. Cause we'll never fall when we all stand. God bless the USA!" -Lee Greenwood's Sept. 1th version of  "God Bless The USA"

      I am sure you all know that we caught Saddam Hussein early this morning THAT IS  w00t'd !!!! I am suddenly seeing the long-term benefits of invading Iraq! Toby Keith's song "Courtesy of the Red White and Blue" has never meant so much! I blared it at 7:00 this morning!

      This is not a terrible virus, but it is quite annoying. If on AIM you see "I found [your screen name]'s picture HERE [Link to www.buddypicture.net]! HAHAHA" Please DO NOT click the link! Buddy Picture is one of the two pages that distributes the RealPHX trojan horse virus to computers through the website (the other is www.talkstocks.net) which puts the same message on your profile for others to fall for. The only way to get rid of it is to go to:  urlLink http://www.rsaisp.com/software.asp  and follow the directions carefully if in fact you do have/get it. The message with the virus also varies to the message: "Whoa..... look what I found!" or something like it. Thanks for reading this. Be careful!

      It's obvious to you all by now that I have my learner's permit. However, when I get my license, I wanna be able to drive around all willy nilly listening to music. That will only be in four months. I want a celebration CD when I finally drive around on my own to listen to for a couple weeks. I am looking to burn a compilation CD of my favorite "Driving songs." I have several that are great driving songs, but I want more so I can eventually have too many and cut some. Give me some ideas. When I finally have my finished roster, I'll blog it. I had a lot of ideas I can't remember. If you remind me of one of those or match one with one on my list, I might just give you a little prize thing. Comment with suggestions! I like all kinds of music, even rap, unless it is vulgar, a terrible beat, or both. Anyway, blog ya later!   In Christ, Mike <>  "A miracle starts with the beat of a heart." - SCC

      Mark: I went to the MVA in Bel Air, Harford County, not the one in Glen Burnie. There are tons of MVA's in Maryland.   Well, I have a prayer request for all the Christians out there, but it needs to be unspoken for now. It's a thing at school that's testing my faith. The song I use for encouragement and direction is SCC's "Bring It On." The chorus is inspiring! I have the lyrics and a link to hear it after the signature.  Oh, and in Spanish, there was a nasty old casserole with onions and stuff in the back of the room but we couldn't smell it because it was air-tight. The class decided to open it in the hallway. It smelled! So they put it in ther trash can out in the hallway. It smelled so nasty! Mr. Medley was laughing away: "Ba-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!" as loud as can be. When school was dismissed, everyone smelled it, and moaned and covered their mouths with their shirts... It was sooo funny!!!  Anyway, blog ya later!  In Christ, Mike <>    Bring It On  :  urlLink Hear this song!   I didn't come lookin' for trouble And I don't want to fight needlessly But I'm not gonna hide in a bubble If trouble comes for me I can feel my heart beating faster I can tell something's coming down But if it's gonna make me grow stronger  Then bring it on! Let the lightning flash, let the thunder roll, let the storm winds blow Bring it on! Let the trouble come, let the hard rain fall, let it make me strong Bring it on!  Now, maybe you're thinkin' I'm crazy And maybe I need to explain some things 'Cause I know I've got an enemy waiting Who wants to bring me pain But what he never seems to remember What he means for evil God works for good So I will not retreat or surrender  Now, I don't want to sound like some hero 'Cause it's God alone that my hope is in But I'm not gonna run from the very things That would drive me closer to Him So bring it on!  Bring it on! Let the lightning flash, let the thunder roll, let the storm winds blow Bring it on! Let the trouble come, let it make me fall on the One who's strong Bring it on! Let the lightning flash, let the thunder roll, let the storm winds blow Bring it on! Let me be made weak so I'll know the strength of the One who's strong Bring it on!

      Sorry, guys... I wanted you all to read at least the first part of that song, and it was irresistable to use the format of the song to act like I was making an announcement. I do have an announcement to make however: I went to the MVA today, and... I GOT MY LEARNER'S PERMIT TODAY! I ALSO REGISTERED TO VOTE! I am officially a registered Republican. I think I'm about as conservative as they come without being part of the Christian Coalition, ML! I took the computer test at the MVA and passed the learner's test well! I get to take driver's ed and then my license in 4 months! I'm psyched! Anyway, that's all. So what's going on in your lives? Blog ya later!  In Christ, Mike  "Jesus is Life!" -SCC

      Thanks to Laura and  urlLink Colin   for answering my question. Now the reason I asked the question about gays: I am doing an article for Journalism class about Maryland wanting to allow gay marriages and I wanted to know how people felt. Colin, can I quote you? You have a common opinion among Christians and I agree with you.... so i want to quote you. Can I do so?   I even interviewed a known gay in my school for it. He has totally opposite views from Colin.   Yesterday during English, first period, we had a freewriting assignment. I just wrote stupid stuff about people in my class, for instance, "My bald monkey dances wildly down the corridors of Greg's soul." (Greg Colburn is a fellow Christian, goes to Mountain Christian not too far from Edgewood, also the church my English teacher Mr. Bancells goes to.) I wrote something about Justin, a friend in that class, and then I thought it was funny so I wrote it really big and handed it to him. It says, " Justin steals melons in order to feed lab rats that built an advanced civilization up Mr. Fisher's left nostril!!!" Today he showed it to Greg and Sarah McMillen (also a Mountain Christian goer), and they thought it was so funny they showed it to Mr. Bancells, and he thought it was so funny he put it on his bulletin board.  So now my weirdest writing is exposed for the world to see.  Anyway, blog ya later!  In Christ, Mike

      Oh joy! I just woke up for another "invigorating day of school." ML! ("Mindlessly Laughing"... for those who are not used to Colin-isms). Mr. Frey used to say that. For those who don't know he is a teacher at my old school  urlLink Baltimore Lutheran School.  He is a funny guy to say the least. Anyway, when you all wake up/get home, tell me about your days (except for Eh Steve, because most likely Steve, being home schooled, did absolutely nothing on this invigorating Monday except woke up late and went on to  urlLink Conglomerate Speech , his new cool forum site that you all should join). Also, it is to be voted on in coming weeks, and I want to see how you all feel: Gay marriages in Maryland? Massachusetts already did it and while the gays feel they have won a victory,  the church believes this is the end to the institution of marriage, and many bishops have been quoted to have said this is a "national tragedy." Comment me! Also read the lyrics below my signature, and if you can, listen to that song. It's a great one! Download it if you have to. I recommend it highly. Anyway, blog ya later!   In Christ, Mike  "For it is by grace you have been saved, through faith--and this not from yourselves, it is the gift of God-- not by works, so that no one can boast. For we are God's workmanship, created in Christ Jesus to do good works, which God prepared in advance for us to do." -Ephesians 2:8-10 NIV    "Everything to Me"  - By Avalon  I grew up in sunday school I memorized the Golden rule And how Jesus came to set the sinner free I know the story inside out I can tell you all about The path that led Him up to Calvary But ask me why He loves me And I don't know what to say But i'll never be the same Because he changed my life when He became...  Everything to me He's more than a story more than words on a page of history He's the air that I breath The water I thirst for And the ground beneath my feet He's everything, everything  to me  We're living in uncertain times And more and more I find that i'm aware Of just how fragile life can be I want to tell the world I found  A love that turned my life around They need to know that they can taste and see Now everyday I'm praying  Just to give my heart away I want live for Jesus So that someone else might see that he is...  Everything to me He's more than a story more than words on a page of history He's the air that I breath The water I thirst for And the ground beneath my feet He's everything And looking back over my life at the end I'll go to meet you saying you've been...  You're everything to me You're more than a story More than words on a page of history You're everything to me You're more than a story More than words on a page of history You're the air that I breath The water I thirst for And the ground beneath my feet You're everything to me Lord, you're everything to me

      I have heard the best songs lately! My girlfriend Brittany got me into Jimmy Wayne, a Christian country singer. Though the whole CD is great, he has three awesome songs, two of which are: "I Love You This Much," and "You're The One I'm Talkin' To." They are both awesome.   (Everything in quotes from this point is from the song. "I Love You This Much" is about a little boy whose father didn't love him, but that didn't stop him from loving his dad. He never even saw him but once a year. He stood "stretching his arms out as far as they'd go, whispering, "Daddy, I want you to know: I love you this much. And I'm waiting for you to make up your mind. Do you love me too? However long it takes, I'm never giving up. No matter what, I love you this much." His father dies in the song too. "And he said, 'Damn you Daddy,' the day that he died. The man didn't blink, but the little boy cried, "I love you this much. And I'm waiting for you to make up your mind. Do you love me too? However long it takes, I'm never giving up. No matter what, I love you this much." The funeral service: "Half way through the service, while the choir sang a hymn, he looked up at the preacher, and sat and stared at him. He said, 'Forgive me Father,' when he realized that he hadn't been unloved or alone all his life. For his arms were stretched out, as far as they'd go, nailed to the cross, for the whole world to know: I love you this much. And I'm waiting for you to make up your mind. Do you love me too? However long it takes, I'm never giving up. No matter what, I love you this much." He realizes that Jesus loved him so much He died for him.  "You're The One I'm Talkin' To" is an awesome song. The chorus explains the whole idea well: "I don't think the world's all bad, That life is cheap and love don't last. In fact I think it's just a few who'd like us to believe that's true. I think most are sick and tired of all the hip and uninspired saying cool is in and good is out. I bet I've got your attention now. Oh and if I don't then you're the one I'm talkin' to. You're the one I'm talkin' to."   Here are the full lyrics:    I Love You This Much   He can't remember the times that he thought Does my daddy love me? Probably not But that didn't stop him from wishing that he did Didn't keep from wanting or worshiping him  He guesses he saw him about once a year He could still feel the way he felt Standing in tears Stretching his arms out as far as they'd go Wispering daddy, I wan't you to know  I love you this much and I'm waiting on you To make up your mind, do you love me to? However long it takes I'm never giving up No matter what, I love you this much  He grew to hate him for what he had done 'Cause what kind of a father, could do that to his son He said 'damn you daddy', the day that he died The man didn't blink, but the little boy cried  I love you this much and I'm waiting on you To make up your mind, do you love me to? However long it takes I'm never giving up No matter what, I love you this much  Half way through the service While the choir sand a hymn He looked up above the preacher And he sat and stared at him  He said "Forgive me father" When he realized That he been unloved or alone all his life His arms were stretched out as far as they'd go Nailed to the cross, for the whole world to know  I love you this much and I'm waiting on you To make up your mind, do you love me to? However long it takes I'm never giving up No matter what, I love you this much    You're The One I'm Talkin' To   I ain't the best, I ain't the worst Won't be the last, sure ain't the first Man who ever had a dream the finally got a break So don't take this wrong, I know I'm blessed But what you see is what you get My own interpretation of what's missing most these days Identity, a real point of view A little honesty, things all could use  I don't think the world's all bad  That life is cheap and love don't last In fact I think it's just a few who'd like us to believe that's true I think most are sick and tired of all the hip and uninspired Saying cool is in and good is out I bet I've go tyour attention now oh and if I don't then You're the one I'm talkin' to You're the one I'm talkin' to  I'm tired of seeing youthful eyes Growing up desensitized By what thy're seeing on TV, believing that's reality That sex is love and life's a game Where all the winners look the same Designer jeans, expensive shoes, imported cars and attitudes What happened to individuality The right to choose your own destiny?  I don't believe the world's all bad That life is cheap and love don't last That cool is in and good is out  Have I got your attention now? 'Cause if I don't then You're the one I'm talkin' to You're the one I'm talkin' to  Anyway, comment me!  (Remember, me sad?) What songs have the best meanings to you? Some of my others are "Everything to Me" by Avalon, "Courtesy of the Red White and Blue" by Toby Keith, "Welcome Home" by Shaun Groves, "Fly Away," by FFH, "You Found Me" by FFH, "Lord Move, or Move Me," by FFH, and more...

      Here we go again, not blogging for three days. I took a look at Karen's car (Karen Bertsche, my very very good friend, my penpal from Summit Grove Camp) that she told me she had, and it's not too bad. It's a white Oldsmobile Achieva SL. I imagine it's similar to  urlLink this . It's pretty cool, actually. If I found a good deal on one, I'd buy it. Just not white. I hate white on a car.  Who has their own car? If you have a car, what kind is it? If possible, go to  urlLink Auto Trader  and find a similar type with a picture. Otherwise, what is your dream car? You can go to  urlLink Auto Trader  and find a link for that too. By the way, so the comment is smaller, if you insert a link, insert it this way:  [PLACE TEXT YOU WANT AS A HYPERLINK FOR YOUR LINK HERE] . Take out the + signs in between the carrot signs. I only put them there so they would show up on my blog. When the + signs are out, it is HTML language. Sorry to be such a pain, but a lot of people hate long comments, so it makes it look more neat and concise. If you have trouble, post the regular URL and I will go behind you on my comments (I can edit my comments) and make it the way it should be. So don't stress over it. Just make a note at the end to alter it for you. Also, sorry about the consistant car thing, but until I definately have my own car, that is all I can think about. You know how it is. If you have trouble putting up with it, comment and tell me to write about something different. (Also, I am still taking suggestions for driving songs... see the December 5th blog for more info about that.)   Anyway, blog ya later! Comment me! (Remember... me sad!)  In Christ, Mike <>

      Again, sorry I haven't blogged much. I haven't really been online. I've been so busy! I finished midterm exams, and believe that I passed them very well.   I was in the bathroom in the Giant across the street from Wendy's, and on the wall was written, "Here I sit broken hearted; Tried to poop but only farted." Is that dumb or what?  Also, I was watching the commercials for the new season of  American Idol , and that mean dude is meaner than ever. Last year, he said things like, "If you sang like that two thousand years ago they would've stoned you!" Now if someone sings a line that says, "I surrender," he raises his hand and says, "So do we!" Someone also sang the song that says, "I'm all by myself," and he said, "If you keep singing like that, you will be!" He is so funny!  So when do you all have midterm exams? I miss the exam schedule at BLS. It was so much better. The one at Edgewood was just gay. At Baltimore Lutheran, the schedule goes over four days and the schedule goes: Tuesday- Pds. 1&5, Wednesday- Pds. 2&6, Thursday- Pds. 3&7, Friday- Pds. 4&8. At Edgewood, it was:      -Tuesday: Go to Pd. 1 for announcements and attendance.                      Go to Pd. 2 for extended period for exam; skip Pd. 4                      Go to Pd. 3 and follow complete Rotation C schedule.     -Wednesday: Arrive at school by 10:00; late bell by 10:10.                           Go to extended Pd. 1 for announcements, attendance and exam.                           Go to extended Pd. 3 for exam                           Lunch is determined by Pd. 3 teacher's lunch.     -Thursday: Arrive at school by 10:00; late bell by 10:10.                       Go to Pd. 1 for announcements and attendance.                       Go to extended Pd. 4 for exam.                       Go to extended Pd. 6 for exam.                       Lunch is determined by Pd. 6 teacher's lunch.     -Friday: Arrive at school by 10:00; late bell by 10:10.                  Go to Pd. 1 for announcements and attendance.                  Go to extended Pd. 7 for exam.                  Go to extended Pd. 5 for exam.                  Go to your normal lunch.  However, I have off Saturday (yesterday), Sunday (today), Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday. I'm going to try to relax some too!   Anyway, blog ya later! I gotta go! Comment me! (Remember? Me sad?)

      Wow, I can't believe I've waited eight days since blogging last! Sorry to those who actually read my page! I have waited so long to blog because everything is piling up... 7-8 hours at school everyday, 7-8 hours at work four times a week, church, and everything all at once. School started up again and I have finals next week. I will be able to blog, however, because I go to school at 9:45 to be there and in class by 10:10 during finals week. I have a lot of time in the morning I can find to blog. It will be fun! So anyway, I have to go. Tell me about something though, just for curiosity: Most likely I will be getting my grandmother's car when i graduate because she can no longer drive. Her car is a gray/silver Mercury Mystique, made by Ford. Its exterior is identical to  urlLink this . What do you think? I intend to get my own, nicer car when money lets me get a good one. In the meantime, my first car will be my grandmother's car which I will fix up a little, get professionally cleaned, some small things fixed, and put a CD player in (all of which my grandmother didn't want to do or wouldn't do). It'll be pretty nice for now. What do you all think about it honestly? Anyway, blog ya later!  In Christ, Mike <>

      This is not spam, it is not crap, it is actually really good. Try  urlLink Crush Calculator  as soon as possible! It's a great tool for compatibility. It is a proven fact that a name given to a person has a correlation with who they are, and it gives how compatible your name seems with your crush's name. It's actually really good and has proven true! Please try it out for your own sake!  In Christ, Mike <>

      Hey, it's been a couple days since I blogged. I needed those couple of days. I feel a lot better. Frankly, I'm happy. Still heartbroken, obviously, but happy. Annie once said, "The sun will come out... tomorrow..." Mike once said, "Shut the f[arm] up!" Well, she's right. When your life and heart are full of darkness, just wait, and the sun will come out tomorrow and brighten it. Don't live with regret. My Journalism friend Heidi says that regret will eat you. She's right. Don't let it eat you. Forgive yourself and try to make it up to yourself and that person.   Part of what made these last couple days great were talking to Kari on the phone a lot, that song  My Will  by D.C. Talk. Part of it was DC Talk's  song Consume Me , but all of it was God speaking to me about everything. Then, when I got to church, we read passages of Scripture (Isaish 43:1-3;41:10; Jeremiah 29:12-13) that really hit the spot that needed a touch from the Master's hand.   Isaiah 43:1-3:  1 But now, this is what the LORD says-  he who created you, O Jacob,  he who formed you, O Israel:  "Fear not, for I have redeemed you;  I have summoned you by name; you are mine.  2 When you pass through the waters,  I will be with you;  and when you pass through the rivers,  they will not sweep over you.  When you walk through the fire,  you will not be burned;  the flames will not set you ablaze.  3 For I am the LORD , your God,  the Holy One of Israel, your Savior;  I give Egypt for your ransom,  Cush and Seba in your stead.   Isaiah 41:10: So do not fear, for I am with you;  do not be dismayed, for I am your God.  I will strengthen you and help you;  I will uphold you with my righteous right hand.   Jeremiah 29:12-13: 12 Then you will call upon me and come and pray to me, and I will listen to you. 13 You will seek me and find me when you seek me with all your heart.   Then, what Pastor Blight, in his sermon, attacked about me next was my mindset that I just told Kendra about two days ago. He said that some people live as pessimists so that they expect the bad so that when it happens  they won't be disspointed. He said, "Isn't that a sad way to live?" Unfortunately, it is. Benjamin Franklin was a wise man, but he was wrong about that one. Brittany agreed with Pastor on the phone just now. So I went up to the alter and gave that mindset up to Him. I gave my life to Him. I gave my will to Him to conform to His will. Whatever happens in my life, He reigns and whatever He wants is best.   Bottom line, feeling happy and doing good. Keep praying. Hard days ahead, I'm sure. Satan tries to kill the good stuff.   So, I am going to see   urlLink The Passion of the Christ    on Tuesday. What did everyone who saw it think of it? I hear it's great and that I should go see it. Anyway, I'll find out.  Anyway, blog you later! Love and prayers for all of you! As many as I can individually everyday! If I have kept in touch with you even through this page or IM or E-mail in the last two months, be sure you're in my prayers. Everyone else, you probably are if I know who you are. I may not keep in touch well, but you're in my prayers!  In Christ, Mike <>

      Yeah, so anyway, it's been a while since Brittany and I broke up. "Face," Brit's boyfriend Steven, says I must put on my pimp face. Look at my unkymoods. That is as pimp as I'm getting, sorry Face. I just have one question: Why can't I turn back time and do it right? I wish I could have made Brittany happy, but she is happier without me... finally laughing and stuff. I can't be selfish. At least one of us is happy.  Here are the lyrics to the song that has been helping me all day, DC Talk's  My Will :   I'm setting the stage for the things I love  And I'm now the man I once couldn't be  Nothing on earth could now ever move me  I now have the will and the strength a man needs   It's my will, and I'm not moving  Cause if it's Your will, then nothing can shake me It's my will, to bow and praise You I now have the will to praise my God   Complexity haunts me for I am two men Entrenched in a battle that I'll never win My discipline fails me, my knowledge it fools me But You are my shelter, all the strength that I need  It's my will, and I'm not moving  Cause if it's Your will, then nothing can shake me It's my will, to bow and praise You I now have the will to praise my God   I'm learning to give up the rights to myself The bits and the pieces I've gathered as wealth  Could never compare to the joy that You bring me  The peace that You show me is the strength that I need   It's my will, and I'm not moving  Cause if it's Your will, then nothing can shake me It's my will, to bow and praise You I now have the will to praise my God   We've got to be children of peace  Don't you know we've got to be children of peace   Anyway, I have to go to work. Pray for me! Blog ya later!  In Christ, Mike <>

      Well for a new edition of Mike's news, I finally talked to Brittany today. We talked on the phone when I broke down so bad I had to call her. We decided to just be very good friends. We will always be close. If anything happens between us again, it happens on its own. (Although I hope it does!!!) But I have to say it just might not. I will be jealous of anyone she dates from now on. I hate this, but oh well. Everything will work out for the best. We might both find people better for us, or we might come to the realization that we belong together. Or I might come to the realization that because I hurt every girl that comes in my way so what I really need to do is just be single for the rest of my life. Jerks like me deserve to be alone for the rest of eternity. Ask, and I might tell you why I was so terrible to her and why now I have so much to regret and so much to never forgive myself for. I miss her so much. I might not actually be over her. But still, I have ben such a jerk to her. The Backstreet Boys have annoyed me before, but I actually understand them now. My favorite line of theirs is from "Back to Your Heart" from Millenium. It says, "If I wasn't such a fool, right now I'd be holding you." Not only did we rush it too fast between us, but I was such a jerk that I think I hurt her, though she says I didn't. There was all kinds of stuff since early August I could have done to make it work, including not rushing it. I could have asked her out in September or October and we might have been fine. Well, no regrets, right? Yeah right... I regret being alive right now... Please pray for me! Blog ya tomorrow!  In Christ, Mike <> In Christ, Mike <>

      Well um now I'm doing everyday. Isn't that w00t'd? (Like anybody reads this thing anyway!) Well, I am still missing Brittany. Sorry but she's most of what you'll hear about for the next couple of of weeks, or until we are done the break and decided what we're doing. I miss her so much. I never realized how important she was and how much I loved her until now. I know it's hard to believe, but I was the biggest jerk to Brittany on Friday. If I could, I would spend the rest of my life making it up to her.  Brittany if you are reading this, I love you so much, and I can't stand being without you. I am sorry about what a jerk I have been to you. If I could, I would spend the rest of my life making it up to you. Please forgive me. I hope we can give our relationship another try. (Sorry for the Backstreet Boys quote, but it's perfect for how I feel):  "It's not that I can't live without you, it's not that I don't even want to try. Every night I dream about you, ever since the day we said goodbye. If I wasn't such a fool, right now I'd be holding you. There's nothing that I wouldn't do, Baby, if I only knew... The words to say, the road to take, to find a way back to your heart. What can I do to get to you? To find a way back to your heart.  I don't know how it got so crazy, but I'll do anything to set things right. Cause your love is so amazing. Baby, you're the best thing in my life. Let me prove my love is real, and make you feel the way I feel. I promise I would give the world, if only you would tell me, Girl... The words to say, the road to take, to find a way back to your heart. What can I do to get to you? To find a way back to your heart. Give me one more chance to give my love to you. Cause no one on this earth loves you like I do. Tell me the words to say, the road to take, to find a way back to your heart. What can I do to get to you? To find a way back to your heart. I'd turn back time to make you mine and find a way back to your heart. I'd beg and plead, fall to my knees, to find a way back to your heart."  I know it's sad, but I have been listening to nothing but sappy music, because it makes me feel better. I don't know why. Lately, I have even been a Backstreet Boys mood., and they used to annoy me. I guess I empathize with the songs? I know it's sad. My cousins April and Nicole used to listen to Backstreet Boys all the time, and I used to hang out with them a lot, so I know all of their songs by heart, even the old ones. It's so weird. But either way, I know it's sad, but I miss her so much. At least the songs I am listening to are for a good cause. Look at my away messages and you can see the kind of messages I am trying to portray to her. Every away message is a message to her in some way or another. Look closely sometime.   Anyway, on to another subject, so there is some variety here. Yesterday our bus broke down so we were late to school because the bus was late picking us up. Today we had a new bus and our bus driver had a substitute (not our normal bus driver), so Greg, a Christian on my bus, and I were joking that yesterday our bus broke and today our driver broke. I guess you'd have to be there.   I have to change my unkymood. I will do that tonight. It says, "Fired up," but I need to find something like sad, broken hearted, or depressed, so you can see how I really feel. I'm sure they have all of them. I'll pick the best one to how I feel. Either way, I am some version of melancholy because of how bad I have made my life recently. The only person who can make it better now is God. I am praying that His will is done and then whatever happens He will make me happy with it, and that He would do what would make me happiest, though more and more I think that is getting Brittany back. I would in turn make her happier than she has ever been.... like it used to be until about two months ago.   Sorry, I said I would change the subject, but she is all I can think about. She told me to just relax and stop worrying because everything would be okay and we will always be close, but if I can't be with her, it won't be okay. I'll always know I blew a great thing, and hate myself. Even if we can work it out, I will have a hard time forgiving myself for Friday. I know I can trust her, and I knew I was making a mistake, but I was the biggest jerk anyway, and I knew I would regret it. And I do. I wish I could turn back time, as impossible as it may seem.   Either way, I know that my life will turn out okay. It depends on whose hands it is in. Like I heard it said:        A basketball in my hands is worth about $19. A basketball in Michael Jordan's hands is worth about $33 million. It depends whose hands it's in.         A baseball in my hands is worth about $6. A baseball in Mark McGuire's hands is worth $19 million. It depends on whose hands it's in.         A tennis racket is useless in my hands. A tennis racket in Venus Williams' hands is a championship winning. It depends whose hands it's in.         A rod in my hands will keep away a wild animal. A rod in Moses' hands will part the mighty sea. It depends whose hands it's in.         A sling shot in my hands is a kid's toy A sling shot in David's hand is a mighty weapon. It depends whose hands it's in.        Two fish and five loaves of bread in my hands is a couple of fish sandwiches. Two fish and five loaves of bread in God's hands will feed thousands. It depends whose hands it's in.         Nails in my hands might produce a birdhouse. Nails in Jesus Christ's hands will  produce salvation for the entire world. It depends whose hands it's in.         As you see now it depends whose hands it's in. So I put my concerns, worries,  fears, hopes, dreams, family and relationships in God's hands because... It depends whose hands it's in.                                         And that is so true!!!!!                                       (Look Kari, no 1's!!!!)  Okay, now I can explain that. Kari, my penpal and one of my best friends, always puts excitement online by putting an infinite amount of exclamation points after what she said, like when she greets me on AIM, "MIKE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!" When she does that, sometimes she lifts up off of SHIFT too early and it's left like this: "MIKE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1" and that's what i see on the IM when she is rushing. It's sort of an inside joke to Kari, Dan Mott, Kendra, me, and some other people.   Anyway, I'm getting bored and there is too much heartache inside me right now, so I am going to go. If you care about me, please give me a call if you know the number. If you don't know it, IM me and find it out. I really would enjoy a call from my friends right now. You all know if you were feeling bad, I would do the same thing. I need to keep in touch with you all better anyway. Blog you later!  In Christ, Mike <>

      Been two days, not a bad frequency. If I blog every other day, that should be fine.  I am still really depressed and really upset. I came to find out that most breaks teen couples take end in break-ups. I couldn't handle that. I have been crying all the time since Saturday night. I am totally depressed. The only hope I have is that she might even E-mail me soon. I have hope that all we have meant to each other since we met will not just be thrown away. I know that either we will get back together or we will be really good friends because we still like and care about each other a lot. I just hope we can still be together after all this. I can't handle losing her. I would be so jealous of anyone else she ever dated or whoever she married, because they have the greatest girl in the world and I once did and blew it bad. I was such a jerk to her sometimes, especially this past Friday. I just hope I can have one more chance to prove to her how much I love her, and how much I am sorry for being that jerky, and one more chance to prove that I believe with all my heart that we belong together. I can say all that and not be embarrassed because nobody reads my blog anyway.   If anyone wants to see how amazingly cute Brittany and I were together, look at the best picture we have ever taken by clicking  urlLink here . (If you get an error message, go to  www.geocities.com/ripkenfan86  and click on "Picture 1.") I know we could still be that happy if she decided to try it again.  These last two days (since Sunday) have felt like three weeks. They have drawn on so long and I see no "light at the end of the tunnel." But I am staying optimistic and holding on to my hope, because everything will be okay and I know she won't throw away everything we meant to each other.  Brittany, if you're reading this, I know you've heard these words before, from other places, and from a song I gave you a copy of, but, "Wherever you go, whatever you do, I will be right here waiting for you. Whatever it takes, or how my heart breaks, I will be right here waiting for you." I will wait as long as I need to, but since you promised it wouldn't be too long, if I graduate and still have not heard from you, I will probably give you a call. My heart can only take so much before I hit the emotional breaking point, go insane, and require answers.  Anyway, pray for me, and blog you later!  In Christ, Mike <>

      I know you want to know what the heck I am talking about, don't you? Well since you asked, I'll tell you. I am the victim of heartache today. However, I caused it myself. So doesn't that mean I'm not a victim? Oh well.  Either way, my girlfriend Brittany decided last night to temporarily (with an option of permanent) take a break from each other because we have been quarrelling too much in the past several weeks and all kinds of small problems. I have caused the majority of this. So though we will be keeping in touch over E-mail a little, we will lose contact until she is ready to call me again, which shouldn't be too long, since she will need more of a break than I will. I am optimistic that she and I will come to the decision together that we do belong together, but in the meantime, that optimistic outlook just makes it worse. If we do NOT get back together, we will always be very close as good friends and just understand that we have others out there better for us.  Brittany, if you're reading this right now, I can't think of anybody on earth better for me than you and I love you so much. Wherever you go, whatever you do, I will be right here waiting for you. I'm waiting for this nightmare to end. You know the number. But whatever you choose will be okay. I love you, and I'm praying you make the best decision despite my very opinionated hope. I have no doubt in my mind that you and I belong together, at least for now, if not forever. But whatever you decide is great. I love you so much!  Anyway, that's all for now! Leave me something until tomorrow's blog. Blog you later!

      Okay, I have to go into old history because of an altercation yesterday on my comments. Apparantly, someone ("Jane"... also known as "~" and "~Jesus Christ~") got onto our blog chain (Mark, Yugug, Brits and me) and started commenting disgusting things against our beliefs. We were successful at avoiding him for a while. He is why I changed my blog URL from mikespeaks.blogspot.com anyway. Lately, he has been back and worse than ever, commenting nasty things on  urlLink Four Cool Guys  and  urlLink The Brit Pit . We know from analyzing his IP address that he lives in California, only two miles or less away from Yugug, AKA Colin, a good friend of mine in our blog chain.  "Jane" is an athiest against our religion. This idiot also likes to act like other people commenting forging my name, SWolf, Laura, Yugug (NOT "YugYug" like idiot thought), and many more. And what is worse is that some people started joining in with him last night when he made a rampage on my comments.  The conversation looks like this:   (Forged as "Mike")  This is to my girlfriend Brittany Mills I have somthing to tell you that i just couldnt tell you any ...   02.20.04 - 3:52 am IP: 24.4.4.192   (Laura)  AWW CRAYUP MY TURNIP EXPLODED *SQUINTS FACE* ...   02.20.04 - 3:24 am IP: 152.163.253.38   (Laura)  WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON ? IF YOU GUYS CAN ALL OF A SUDDEN CUSS, SO I CAN I. FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK. W ...    (Forged as SWolf)  FUCK ME MIKE FUCK ME ...   02.20.04 - 12:18 am IP: 24.4.4.192   (Forged as Mike)  moan ...   02.20.04 - 12:17 am IP: 24.4.4.192   (Forged as Mike)  im sorry laura i love you soooo sooo much and i love blink too yay ...   02.20.04 - 12:16 am IP: 24.4.4.192   (Forged as SWolf)  well fuck you too and its spelled ALMOST you fucking idiot ...   02.20.04 - 12:15 am IP: 24.4.4.192   (Forged as Mike)  yes of course i will because i love you aslmost as much as the big JC but then he is a loser so yeah ...   02.20.04 - 12:14 am IP: 24.4.4.192   (Forged as SWolf)  i love you mike will you go out whit me ...   02.20.04 - 12:13 am IP: 24.4.4.192   (Forged as Yugug, but spelled it "YugYug")  I HATE JESUS ...   02.20.04 - 12:12 am IP: 24.4.4.192   ("Jane")  YER A FUCKING LOSER ...   02.19.04 - 9:04 pm IP: 24.4.4.192  My IP is: 69.139.224.6. So it wasn't me that did any of the posts he did as me...   SWolf asked who "Jane" was... Jane is a stalker and a random dummy who has nothing better to do but annoy people because he has no life. I actually feel sorry for him. I blocked him off my page... for now. Otherwise, please ignore posts like that until I get rid of them when they happen again... and they will because he is persistant. And no, Laura, you are not allowed to just cuss. Please keep following the rules while I fix this crisis. I'm sorry for this idiot, and I will do everything I can to ensure this won't happen again.  Until I blog again, God bless.  In Christ, Mike <>

      Well again I lost track of when I blogged last. I need to designate time everyday to get online. Right now I am taking advantage of the time in Journalism that I can't find anything to do with and blog instead. I am the Sports Writer for the Edgewood High School Newspaper in Journalism class this semester, and right now we are between seasons, so I have nothing to do as of yet. I will have at least one article in the newspaper. When my first article ever is published, I'll blog it.   Thanks for the really awesome music discussions on my comments. I am glad everyone is able to have a civil conversation on my page. Apparantly some people were not aware that I set down rules before. Sometime I need to find a way to put this on my comment page through my template: 1. Be respectful especially when you disagree. 2. Comment!!!  Well, how was Valentine's Day for everyone? Brittany and I had a really good Valentine's Day. She and her aunt picked me up around 9:00 and I went to her house where we hung out for a little bit. We then went to see  urlLink  50 First Dates   at AMC Movie Theater, and then went to  urlLink Olive Garden  for dinner. After that we went back to her house to hang out a while. I gave her a dozen red roses, a chocolate rose (because she hates the assorted kind that comes in the heart boxes that I wanted to get her), a larger sized red teddy bear with a heart pillow that says "Happy Valentine's Day" and a really big card. She got me a big box of assorted chocolate,  a small teddy bear with a frame, two votive (spelling?) candles for my cross candle holder from  urlLink Britney  for Christmas. She also got me sleep pants from Old Navy with "love dice" on them. It was a great night.   Well, about  urlLink  50 First Dates  , it was pretty good. Drew Barrymore was great in it. Adam Sandler was just good old Adam Sandler and did absolutely fantastic. Sean Astin, who also played the hobbit Sam on  urlLink  LoTR movies   did very well as the steroid-enhanced older brother Doug. Drew's character's father was played by one of my favorite actors, Blake Clark. Clark played Chet Hunter (Shawn's father) on   urlLink Boy Meets World  . Rob Schneider, from   urlLink The Hot Chick   was Adam's character's dumb Hawaiian buddy.  Now for the editorial: The casting director gets a "two-thumbs-up" rating, and five stars, but the writer of the movie gets kudos for the dumbest movie in the history of the world. I won't ruin the ending for those who want to watch it, but Adam's character is on a boat ride and gets stranded on a different part of Hawaii than where he lives. He meets Drew's character in a run-down quaint diner building her waffles into houses. They hit it off and she invites him to breakfast at the same place the next morning. He accepts. The next morning he gets there to find that she does not know who he is. The waitress tells him she has short-term memory loss from a blow to the head she suffered in a car accident. He meets the father and brother who live their lives continuing to make her believe she is reliving the same day because she still thinks it's October 17th of 2003 and not April of 2004. Her father and brother, teamed up with Adam's character, come up with a way to refresh her memory every morning and hope with everything that they have that it works. The end is surprising. I like the fact that it is a happy ending, but it's not that great a movie. Going to the movies is fun, but don't waste your time or money. Go see   urlLink Lord of the Rings: Return of the King   or something instead. Rent this one. It's good, but not that good.   Has anyone seen   urlLink Barbershop 2  ? Is it as good as the first? Anything with  urlLink Cedric the Entertainer  is hilarious. (For instance,  urlLink The Steve Harvey Show .) What was also great was mixing  urlLink Martin Lawrence  with Cedric in  urlLink  Big Momma's House  . Anything with Martin Lawrence is the funniest!  Also, I have one music review:  urlLink Randy Travis , country music singer, has a great worship album,   urlLink Randy Travis: Worship & Faith  . It mixes country and worship in a way even better than   urlLink Rise and Shine  . Although   urlLink Three Wooden Crosses   is one of the best songs I have heard in a while. I am just overall a Country music fan, especially if it is about God or patriotism. I love all kinds of music unless it is Laura or SWolf's kind, nothing against them.  Anyway, I gotta go, so blog ya later!  In Christ, Mike <>

      Once again I have had no time to do anything. I have barely been online. Frankly, I am tired of work, homework, and school. That takes up my time. When is the summer coming??? Graduation is only four months away! What the heck??? Why can't it just be June 3rd? I'll graduate, get my car, and get the heck out of here!!!!!   Here's the funniest thing I've seen in a while:   The winners of the David Letterman Top 10 Contest:  Top Ten Signs You're Eating Too Much McDonald's...    10. You accuse your wife of cheating when you see her coming out of Burger King Ray H., Newark, DE   9. You develop a bad case of "apple pie lung" Tim S., Council Bluffs, IA   8. Your blood type is "extra fancy" Erik L., Seattle, WA   7. Meals at other restaurants are never "happy" enough for you Steve S., Vancouver, BC   6. You volunteer for Mayor McCheese's re-election campaign Denver C., Annandale   5. You attempt to make a citizen's arrest of the Hamburglar Jim S., Raleigh, NC   4. You're unable to make a decision without first asking yourself, "What would Grimace do?" Ben S., Spring Hill, FL   3. The McDonald's sign in your town says "Over 8 billion sold to Al" Chad S., Coralville, IA   2. You think that Janet Jackson's starburst nipple shield should be a "Happy Meal" toy Lisa R., Hanover, PA   1. Swollen McNuggets Lou G., St. Louis, MO    Well, I eat at  urlLink Wendy's  all the time, So I would never know about that. I work there, so I eat there. They have the best food. The best burgers, the best fries, the best chili, the only potatoes. It's great!  Anyway, what's going on? What music have you been listening to? I have been listening to the Randy Travis Worship and Faith album. All those who like his country music, you would be blown away by his country worship!!!  Anyway, I have to go. I am in the Computer lab right now for Contemporary Issues class right now, and the substitute keeps yelling at me for slacking off (I am just tired of school work!!!) and I guess I have to go. I will blog tomorrow afternoon. All my friends, especially those at BLS, I miss you all! E-mail me soon!  In Christ, Mike <>  Also visit:  urlLink Four Cool Guys

      Okay, I don't have a lot of time to blog (but I will find more time more often), but I wanted to blog after work to tell you what's wrong with me. Becky, the assistant manager at Wendy's (the cool manager) found a way to keep me there longer. I was trying to become a crew chief. They found incentive for temporary dedication (until maybe the end of the summer) by showing their intent in making me a crew chief when they ordered my gold plated name tags! They look so nice! I want to wear them! I also want the raises for crew chief and evaluation. I'll be at $7.60/hr by the summer! I think I'm probably going to stay and leave after the summer, which means I'll be there a year and three months! That's too long! I never meant to be there past December!  Anyway, gotta go! Blog ya later!  In Christ, Mike <>    You Found Me , by FFH  (Read these lyrics. I'm posting the full song soon! I've got nowhere to turn,  I've got nowhere to hide,  And I've got no alibi, You've been following me,  You know my history,  And no matter how hard I try, I can't explain away The way I feel today There's only one thing I can say:  (Chorus) You, You found me. You found me and You called me from the wilderness, From my cave of emptiness, Yeah, You, You found me. You found me in the places of my lonliness You told me there was more than this, You captured me with tenderness, Yeah, You found me.  There was so many days,  Trying to figure out ways,  To explain what I feel inside, I tried to fill up my soul without loosing control,  This desire never did subside, I'm ready to give in I know I'll never win The hide and seek that I've been in  (Chorus) You, You found me. You found me and You called me from the wilderness, From my cave of emptiness, Yeah, You, You found me. You found me in the places of my lonliness You told me there was more than this, You captured me with tenderness, Yeah, You found me.  In the pit of despair, I was all alone there. I wasn't looking for You, but You found me anyway. You put Your hand on my face, then you changed my ways. Nothing can separate me from...  (Chorus) You, Cause You found me. You found me and You called me from the wilderness, From my cave of emptiness, Yeah, You, You found me. You found me in the places of my lonliness You told me there was more than this, You captured me with tenderness, Yeah, You found me.

      Well, Elaine hasn't been back to comment from what I can tell...  Anyway, I wanted to blog today because it's been a while and the subject of lesbian sex is scaring me a little.  Thursday I got my class ring from  urlLink Baltimore Lutheran  in the mail... FINALLY! We kept trying to decide if I should buy the ring or get one from Edgewood High and tell Balfour I didn't want the Baltimore Lutheran ring after all. I don't like that idea. Baltimore Lutheran was where I went for three years, plus eight years in their feeder school, Bethlehem Christian, and even though I am "graduating" from Edgewood High, Baltimore Lutheran is where my heart is and where all my friends are (even though two are mad at me because I didn't have a lot of time to really keep in touch... who agrees there's more behind it than that?).   Anyway, I heard about something else that's mentionable. In Baltimore, where I grew up, in an area not too far away from where I grew up, a girl had a party with some friends over. They were playing truth or dare, and a friend of the girl who threw the party was dared to kiss the boyfriend of the girl who threw the party. She did. The mother of the girl who threw the party told her daughter to "take care of business," and so both the woman and her daughter started beating up the friend. Another grown woman and two girls jumped in and started beating her up too. This went on for several minutes until the girl's sister came to pick her up and saw it happening. She saw blood coming from just about every part of her sister's face. She called the police. The girl went into the hospital unconscious, but is now conscious. Arrests were made. Isn't that the kind of thing that makes you want to go down there and slam the heads of the two grown women into walls and see how THEY like it?  Anyway, I have to go. I'll talk to you all later! Blog ya later! Maybe tomorrow!  In Christ, Mike <>

      Today's blog will be an interesting blog. I am commenting to a comment from the last blog by a girl/woman who calls herself Elaine. I found her comment important enough to blog about. Her comment said:  Would love to get your comment on Lynne Cheney's novel of steamy lesbian sex, "Sisters" published by Signet. Our V.P.'s very religious wife has her main character watching two women in each other's arms and thinking that their "passionate, loving intimacy was forever closed to her. How strong it made them. What comfort it gave."   Hey Elaine. I know an Elaine at my school. I want to get to know who you are. Who are you? Where did you find my page? I saw your IP address when going over my comments, and it seems like you are in the area by relating your IP address to another person's. Are you anywhere in the Maryland area?   By the way, it's curious that the professor who even got this book popular's name was also Elaine... Dr. Elaine Showalter. Any coincedence? Maybe this name "Elaine," being a not so average name anymore is really a cover name, or "stage" name, as it were.  About your question, I cannot give a good comment right now until I really look into it, but I will look it up and dediate another day's blog to it when I have formed an opinion. Let me ask you this: Why do you find that lesbian sex is quite so necessary? I find that the most comforting and strengthened relationship is that which is glorifying to God: a heterosexual (1 man and 1 woman) relationship.   So what type of books do you like and why? Your taste as of yet is reminding me of an ex-girlfriend, Arianna. (EVIL, EVIL, EVIL... Don't get me started.) She loved Anne Rice books, the vampirish smut that is filling the minds of teenagers everywhere with filth of sex with vampires and vampire on vampire homosexual sex.   About  Sisters , Lynne Cheney, should I stand corrected, is the wife of our Vice President Dick Cheney. I can't say that I think she is necessarily wrong yet, but what I have heard concerns me. The review I found so far says this: The book, entitled "Sisters," was printed in 1981 only in a Signet Canadian paperback, Dr. Showalter said, and is now extremely hard to find.  In the typically hyperbolic language of romance novels, the book's jacket promises the tale of Sophie Dymond, a beautiful, strong-willed widow who leaves New York to investigate her sister's death in Wyoming, and finds herself in a world "where wives were led to despise the marriage act and prostitutes pandered to husbands' hungers . . . where the relationship between women and men became a kind of guerrilla warfare in which women were forced to band together for the strength they needed and at times for the love they wanted." The review also stated the full quote you gave part of. The whole quote reads: "She saw that the women in the cart had a passionate, loving intimacy forever closed to her. How strong it made them. What comfort it gave."  I'm scared after that. I really am. I am a slight homophobe, so yeah. I'm scared.  But yeah, my full comment is that I think the book, from what I am hearing so far, is that it helps to take the things that God meant for good (romantic relationships), perverts them, twists them into what disgusting women would like them to become, and take them to the extremes unintended by God. And the Apostle Paul would like to have a turn backing me up in Romans 1: 24-27, 32:   24Therefore God gave them over in the sinful desires of their hearts to sexual impurity for the degrading of their bodies with one another. 25They exchanged the truth of God for a lie, and worshiped and served created things rather than the Creator--who is forever praised. Amen.  26Because of this, God gave them over to shameful lusts. Even their women exchanged natural relations for unnatural ones. 27In the same way the men also abandoned natural relations with women and were inflamed with lust for one another. Men committed indecent acts with other men, and received in themselves the due penalty for their perversion. 32Although they know God's righteous decree that those who do such things deserve death, they not only continue to do these very things but also approve of those who practice them.   I will comment better when I have better insight on the book. Check back for more in about a week I guess.  Anyway, thanks for visiting my page. I hope I answered your question for a comment in the way you intended and/or expected. Comment again sometime.

      Well I just officially saw my new FAVORITE movie of all time on Saturday. I saw  urlLink The Passion of the Christ  on Saturday before work. It was so good! It was right along with Scripture, gives the human/God aspects of Christ, and gives honor and glory to Him. Mel Gibson was SO good with this movie. My favorite actor, I guarantee, will be Jim Caviezel, the man who played Jesus. He was so good. We didn't see him, but instead saw Jesus Christ. He is also a Christian. I quickly started looking up to that man. It is a movie that, if you see it, will renew your senses of God, give new understanding to the suffering and death of my Lord, and revive your Christianity in a new and wonderful way. If you have never seen it, I urge you to see it. Treat it like a church worship service and prepare your heart. God will bless you.   Anyway, I gotta go get ready for driver's ed now... blog ya later! Probably tomorrow. A lot more coming tomorrow.  In Christ, Mike <>

      Okay, I take back everything I said on the 29th. The sun has come out. It took until March 2nd, though. Brittany, her friend Mindy, and I were talking on the phone, and a lot of revelations came to me, including the fact that I was not even sure who the real Brittany was because I kept unintentionally trying to "change" her. I'm not going into all that went wrong because of the privacy of the other two involved, but Brittany and I are okay, and just fine with being friends. I am finally laughing and smiling, and actually innocently flirting with some of my friends that are girls... ML (Mindlessly Laughing.. the Colinism replacement of LOL... I guess the sugarfree version- for the non-hyper) not with guys I hope!!!   Anyway, I'm going to change my  urlLink Unkymoods  now because I am no longer heart-broken. My heart is prepared to move on, and it's finally okay. It will always have a large place that belongs to Brittany, but it's a friend sized portion indefinately, and we're actually okay. I'm finally happy and finally doing good.  Here are the song's lyrics that have been helping me with everything, giving me a way back to the great realtionship God and I used to have and how to get parts of them on MP3 (Also,  Willing to Be Weak  and  To Know Him , also by  urlLink Charles Billingsley  have been good too):     Settle Me Now , Charles Billingsley :  urlLink MP3   I find myself so far ahead of you My minds racing When I think about all I could do for you Anticipating What's beyond the door that leads to tomorrow Oh my heart is weary, and I feel so uneasy  CHORUS Settle me now - Don't let me miss this moment You've got so much to show me And I know, I know I need you Settle me now - Oh Lord please draw me closer Let me feel your presence Reach beyond my doubt and fear somehow Oh, settle me now  So here I am longing to know your will And I keep praying I know you know it's hard to be still But my heart keeps waiting You'd think by now I would've learned to just trust you Oh, but I've been so busy, that's why I'm so uneasy  REPEAT CHORUS  BRIDGE So many times I have appeared to be the strong one When deep inside I wanted to run and hide And Lord I've always looked to you for all the answers But it seems today I've got a fragile faith  REPEAT CHORUS   Anyway, please comment me! Blog ya later! Keep praying! Thanks for all your words of encouragement and love! God bless!  In Christ, Mike <>

      Well, I did it. I finally did what I wanted to do for six months! I quit my job at Wendy's. I worked at the Wendy's in Edgewood, Harford County, Maryland, since June 14, 2003, and just quit yesterday, April 23, 2004. Background information to know before I tell the story is that Brian, Patrick, and Dave, a manager and two workers, are all prejudice against white people, believe it or not, and they all work on Friday nights, Dave sometimes does not, though.   Now to tell you what happened: My friend Randy and I both quit because the newest manager, Brian, the one on duty last night, would not work with us and sat in the back all night talking on his cell phone with his girlfriend and whoever else,  and would not give Randy and I breaks when we were supposed to get them because he didn't want to actually work. The managers are supposed to work anyway, so that's not right. Then, Brian kept saying he was going to let me off on time for a change, and that he had a "plan" that included getting me off drive-thru register at 9:30 last night to have me do dishes and be finished them by 10:15 and maybe be able to let me off at 10:30.  Then Patrick (a worker that gets along with Brian really well and), who wasn't working much as well, and Dave (a worker who was just there to hang out with Brian and Patrick, not to be on clock and work) went over and talked to Brian for a while outside by the electric box. By 10:20 I was still on register. I asked Brian what was going on, and he told me to wait it out and he'd get there. Dave started cussing me out and everything, and saying that I was a pansy and a "porkchop" and all kinds of other crap. He said he can't get in trouble for it because he was off the clock. Since I was on the clock I couldn't say anything back. Brian wouldn't let me anyway and would say he wouldn't let me, because obviously he favors Dave. I went back inside to go back to my register, and Randy and I looked out the drive-thru window to see Brian, Patrick, and Dave all walk out by the dumpsters and do something. Randy, after taking a closer look believed they were smoking pot. I seriously believe that too. So we now have three workers that will not work, two of which are on clock, one of the two on clock being a manager, and they are hitting up some pot while they should be working and Brian should be going by his word, and not verbally abusing me. Randy hated his job too. He looked over at me and said, "We should just walk out." I said, "You mean quit?" He said, "Yeah. Let's do it. I'll ask him for my break now, and if he refuses to give me my break, I'm out. If you come too, I'll drive you home. My truck's outside." I agreed, and he asked Brian for his break. He refused the break. Randy said, "Okay, I quit." Brian said, "So you're just going to walk out of the shift?" Randy said, "Yeah. I'm out." Brian said, "Go clock out then and leave." He did and looked at me. I took off my drive-thru headset and said, "I'm out too." Brian said, "So you're quitting too? That means for good. You're not coming back if you do this." I said, "Yeah. I know. I'm out. I quit." I clocked out, walked outside, and hopped in the passenger's side of an already running old Ford F-150 with Randy in the driver's side, and we left. I got home and told my parents the story. They agreed that I had a good reason, and though when I did quit they wanted it to be respectfully with a two-week notice, they understood and agreed that I did the right thing by walking out.   Anyway, I gotta go. Comment me with your thoughts on this and maybe some recommendations on where to go for a new job. Blog ya later!  In Christ, Mike <>

      Again with the not blogging! Happy belated Easter everybody! I have to tell you guys something. To those who have already heard it, I'm sorry, bear with me.   I am an usher at church (there are four of us), and of course the main jobs of ushers are to take up the offering and usher late people to a seat quickly as to not cause a distraction. On Easter, we have one other job, and that is to hand out chocolate easter eggs from Moore's Candy's in Hamilton, Baltimore City as an Easter present from the church. We counted a whopping 260 people at the Easter service on the 11th. The problem is that we only planned 210 easter eggs, which meant if everyone wanted one, the choir, the pastors, ushers, and 20 other people would not get any.   Now recall the story of the feeding of the 5,000. Jesus took the only food he could find, five loaves of barley and two small fish to feed 5,000 men not counting the women and the children (so it was more like 15,000 assuming everyone had a wife and one kid). His disciples fed all of those people and when they were all so full they couldn't eat any more, there were still twelve basketfuls of broken pieces left over. (For the whole story, see the middle of Luke 9.)  I felt like a disciple at that meeting on Easter last week, because in the heat of the moment, when we realized there was not going to be enough, God had a better plan. We handed them out anyway, of course. Of course it was only chocolate, and everyone had tons at home, so it didn't make much difference. Yet, somehow, there was enough to go all the way through the congregation, the choir all got one, the pastors got one, the ushers all got one, and somehow there was enough for some people, Mrs. Shelva Blight (Pastor's wife), and me to all get seconds when everyone else left.   I don't know who else agrees, and don't care, but I have to say I believe God did the "bread and fishes" miracle this Easter on the chocolate. We counted each one and there was exactly 210. There was no way it should have gone through 260. God is good!  Two cool things: 1. I am closer to my driver's license because I am getting more comfortable on the road. By May I will have my license, I promise. Then I can come and see all of you that I haven't seen in 65 years. I might stop by  urlLink Baltimore Lutheran  if I can find a car to drive down there before I get mine in June. 2. I am getting a cell phone really soon. However, I'm going to be really picky on who gets it, and to save minutes, when I am home, I'm turning it off with a message to call me at home. And really soon I'll be getting my own room phone- needed when you're 18 and in college so your parents can't spy as much.   Also, I decided because it doesn't feel right not graduating at Baltimore Lutheran, provided I pass the year (looks good so far), I still will not be participating in the ceremony. It just isn't the same. I'm not even going to my prom because it just isn't the same. I was looking forward to the prom at BLS.   Anyway, I gotta go. Enjoy this for a couple days before I blog again (maybe Wed or Thurs). Blog ya later!  In Christ, Mike <>

      Okay, well today has been a very happy day so far. I woke up to find out the Orioles won the game I fell asleep watching about 10 minutes after I fell asleep. I have been doing a lot of work reorganizing my room, hopefully for good, including putting everything pertaining to Brittany into a big box for storage, thank God, listening to  Stay Gone  by Jimmy Wayne, one of my favorite Country artists. The song is identical to the story of Brittany and I told by my point of view. The lyrics are at the bottom. READ THEM!   I found out on Monday that there is no way my parents will let me go to prom in New Jersey. For those of you who did not know, I was trying to have my parents let me go to Jessica Aubry's prom in New Jersey. Jess is a good friend I met at camp when I met Kari, but Jess and I are not as close as Kari and I are. She asked me in early March if I could take her to her prom. I want to go to see her so bad, and would love to go to prom with her seeing that it doesn't feel right going to my prom at my new school since I know nobody but like 10-20 seniors and lots of sophomores. But yeah, my parents think it's irresponsible of them to let me go somewhere they have never been with people they barely know, so whatever. Jess knows that since I will be 18 in October if she wants to take me to her senior prom I'm there like swimwear. Well, I guess swimwear won't really be there, will it?  Anyway, I have to go soon. I have to call Jessica at 2:00 and go to work at 4:00. Thanks to all of the people who read this thing and are patient when I don't blog for a week. I am jealous of your prayers. Blog ya later!  In Christ, Mike <>  "I don't know half of you half as well as I should like, and I like half of you less than half as well as you deserve." -Bilbo Baggins from LOTR "The Fellowship of the Ring     Stay Gone : Jimmy Wayne    I found piece of mind I'm feeling good again I'm on the other side Back among the living Ain't a cloud in the sky All my tears have been cried And I can finally say   Chorus:  So baby, baby stay Stay right where you are I like it this way It's good for my heart I haven't felt like this In God knows how long I know everything's gonna be okay If you just stay gone  I still love you and I will forever We can't hide the truth We know each other better When we try to make it work We both end up hurt And it ain't supposed to be that way   Chorus   When you try to make it work We both end up hurt Love ain't supposed to be this way   Chorus   I know everything's gonna be okay If you just stay gone

      Well it's been about 85 years since I last blogged. Okay, okay. Shut up. Maybe it's only been a week and a half. Either way, it's been too long. Sorry guys!  Anyway, I have some news that is both good and bad: Brittany and I are no longer on speaking terms. Without going into painful details and trying to sit there and dish out blame, we were both at fault and hurt each other way too much, and now we can't do anything but argue. Those of you who know either of us know the situation and you know who is at blame for what.   Very good news: my buddy Greg from school got me to get a  urlLink Deviant Art  page. I know you're asking now, "What is a Deviant Art page?" Well, the answer is simple. Deviant Art is a page similar to a blog page where you post anything artistic that you, yourself, have created. I have posted only one piece of art so far, and it is a sonnet I wrote in English class that is pretty good I guess. As I go along, I will post more of the stuff I have written. Anyway, the link to my Deviant Art page is:  urlLink http://ripkenfan86.deviantart.com . It will also be on the frame on the right very soon.   Anyway, blog ya later with more! God bless!

      Well, I haven't blogged in three days. I've done worse! Recently! Glad to see everyone commented on how I was feeling and cared! :(   Finals start tomorrow. I do my Psychology final tomorrow, my Spanish 4(hehe failed that one already)and Contemporary Issues finals on Wednesday, my Journalism and Tech finals on Thursday, and my English and Concert Chorus finals on Friday. FUN!   On Sunday, I gave a small "sermonette", I guess you could call it, and I got a great approval rating from it. The only person who frequents this site at all that heard the sermonette is Ruth Fox. (Hmm, I wonder what she thought of it...) I used some of my own personal testimony to back up my point, and used some of  urlLink Newsboys  front man Peter Furler's testimony too. I see him on the Trinity Broadcasting Network (TBN) on ATF TV done by  urlLink Acquire The Fire (ATF)  and Ron Luce, head of Teen Mania Ministries, sponsor of Acquire The Fire (ATF).   The service yesterday (Sunday) was our graduation service, and my sermonette was on taking God with you with you wherever you go, to live for Him, and to have the strong relationship with Him that He wants to have with you. When Peter gives his testimony, it comes from the heart because he made a lot of mistakes that he doesn't want any other Christian teenager to have to make. Those who know me well know that I made me own small mistakes before that I am not proud of. That was part of my personal testimony. I told the church about how I used to be into pornography two and three years ago, and though the temptation is still there, I hold strong against it. I also told them about how I used to smoke, for a short time, and recently quit.   I'm not proud of my past, and I'm actually pretty ashamed of it, but God was speaking and told me to use it to further my point. Not only were they glad to hear an honest testimony (which in Christian circles, is still hard to come by), but glad to hear a strong challenge for all ages, to live the way God would have you to live, and have that strong relationship with Him. It was a lot of fun, spiritually uplifting for everyone, and the church (full of people I've known all my life and have grown very close with) got to learn more about the me they never saw. It was great, and I would gladly do it again.  Also, Colin, if you read this, E-mail me or IM me sometime and remind me: I have a somewhat large online project (that is fun) I would like to endeavor that I might need your help on if you're willing and have some time on your hands. It may be more than I can handle in a short time.  Well, that's all for now! Blog ya later! Comment me!  In Christ, Mike <>

      Well, I'm feeling better, but because I am still not "up to par" (as cliché as possible), I am leaving the Unkymood as "sick." Because of the violent nature of the sickness that I endured, I have a lot of muscle pains from the waist up to the top of my head. (Wow, that wasn't as picturesque as I thought maybe it might be!) The muscles in my chest, back, shoulders, and neck hurt when I breathe.   Anyway, I wanted to let you all know the URL to my commentary on  urlLink  Today's Bible   in case you'd want to read it or at least see that I am starting to make my mark a little bit at a time. It can be found at:  urlLink http://todaysbible.lifewithchrist.org/permalink/3950 .   Well, until I get better, that's all for now!  In Christ, Mike <>

      Well, this weekend was awesome. I was barely ever home. I spent the weekend with one of the most awesome girls I have ever met (Kari, Kendra, and Karen (wow, all K's) not included in that statement, cause they're awesome too). Her name is Jessica Aubry, and I met her two years ago at Summit Grove Camp. I haven't seen her since. We've just kep in touch.  I met her mom and step-dad Friday and we went out bowling. It was fun. Dave (step-dad) is wicked awesome at bowling. I was good, but not nearly as good as I used to be. Guess who is going more often to work up his game! :) After that, Dave, Val, and Jess met my parents. Dave, Val, and the parentals talked for an hour while Jess and I hung out more.  Saturday, Dave, Val (Jess' mom), Jess, and I went to the  urlLink National Aquarium in Baltimore . It was fun. After that, we went back to her hotel to go swimming in the pool-like wading pool they call a pool. It was fun. That whole day Jess and I had tickle fights. After swimming, we hung out in her room playing games (Backgammon and stuff) until I went home, and Dave and Val talked to the parentals again for about an hour.   Sunday, Jess hung out here, and we played card games and then went for a walk around my neighborhood. After we came back, Dave, Val, Jess, the parentals, my sister Laura, and I all went out to Golden Corral for lunch and then they left. I went to church that night and didn't get home until late. I had a great time, but it left no time for other friends or the bloggie. Hope you understand. It really was worth it.   I am not saying that Jess and I will get together or anything, but I really do like her... and I have evidence including some off-side comments she has said to prove she really likes me as well. Keep an eye on this one. You'll hear more about Jess in the months to come.  Notable: I forgot to mention that the Edgewood High School newspaper has been put on the web, and if you so choose, you can read my articles on the page. It is at: urlLink ehsnews.blogspot.com .  Also notable, while I was on leave of absense, if you want to call it that, a very nice girl/lady named Nancy came across my blog, added it to her Christian blog listing at  urlLink http://journals.aol.com/sftrail/SheepBlog/ , and asked me to do a guest commentary on some bible passages for  urlLink http://todaysbible.lifewithchrist.org . I will post links to my commentaries when they are published.  Anyway, don't have long. More to catch up on. Next stop,  urlLink Twice Double Forums  and then surprising Kari with a phone call. Blog ya later! God bless!  In Christ, Mike <>  "What is past is prologue."- What is Past is Prologue statue in Washington D.C. (Basically means, "You ain't seen nothing yet!")

      Well, I totally revamped my page, and redid my entire template. How do you like it? Should I do a different one? I originally decided to use the new Blogger comments, but I don't like the way they do them. It's like the Live Journal and Got Diary comments. So I am keeping Haloscan, and all my comments are sticking around. Yay!  In Christ, Mike <>

      Well, I just took off that Crush Calculator prank junk, not because I was asked to, but it was a choice. It became kind of frightening, and frankly, with people's secrets, comes responsiblity I would rather them give to me and not take upon myself. Maybe I'm maturing, or maybe I'm just bipolar and half insane. You make the call. Blog more later! Talent show coming up tomorrow, need my sleep. Blog tomorrow or Sunday to let you know how it went! Laterness!  In Christ, Mike <>

      Okay, well I feel really dumb. My good friend Kari (from PA, the one that comments on here on occasion) and her best friend Kendra, also a good friend, played a prank on me saying they weren't friends anymore and hated each other. It started on Wednesday when they actually had a legitimate small fight, but easily reconciled. Instead, they told me that they were not friends anymore, and where I found out was Kendra's online diary ( urlLink see it to read how she has been doing that her last two entries ). And then I asked them what happened. My only hint to that it was a prank was when I called Kendra and she told me that the fights were over "stuff" and couldn't give me specifics. However, they were so good at it, that I found out when they called me today (Kari's birthday party) and Kari told me to talk to one of her guests. The guest was Kendra, and she explained how the whole thing was a prank.   Now the dumb part... I feel so dumb, because I am the master at pranks, and nobody has ever been able to do something like that to me, because I always figure these things out. I am so proud of them though, because they put so much work into it, so much time spent making sure they aligned their stories just right so there were no holes in their stories, and so much more... including Kari even making fun of her on an e-mail, and saying that she is glad Kendra will no longer get in her way. I even thought that maybe it was all a hoax, but I dismissed that theory saying, "No, Kari and Kendra aren't that mean."  Well they are!  I tried some feeble attempts to get back at them while we were still on the phone, and they worked, but they're not nearly as good as what they did.  So no, Kari and Kendra, I'm not mad. In fact, I'm proud. But do it again, and face my wrath! AHHH! BE AFRAID, BE VERY AFRAID!  Blog ya later!  In Christ, Mike <>

      Well, I guess it's about time I posted.   First, I want to announce that  urlLink CTI , my new online christian teen support site, is up and running. "CTI" stands for " C hristian  T een  I ssues". Hopefully we will turn into a forum in time, and it won't just be us four (Me, Colin, Steve (AKA Mark) and Kari).   Well, um, I get my license soon. I've now hit highway driving. I went up to about 65 mph, and drove on Rt. 40 (Pulaski Hwy.), Rt. 152 (Mountain Rd.), Rt. 24 (Vietnam Vets Mem. Hwy.), and Edgewood Rd. I'm getting good.   Also, the new Wendy's at which I work just had the Grand Opening on Saturday. Billy Ripken (Cal Ripken Jr.'s brother) was there, Tom Davis (national sportscaster), and our councilman Dion Guthrie. It was fun.   Well that's all that's really going on. Read the lyrics to the song down below. A lot of the same aspects discussed in it are things I learned from Brittany, and now I feel okay to release the first of the two country songs that have gotten me over Brittany and taught me a lot. The second comes tomorrow.  In Christ, Mike <>   urlLink Hear this song now!     Back of the Bottom Drawer  by Chely Wright   In the back of the bottom drawer  Of the dresser by our bed  Is a box of odds and ends that I have always kept  But the man who sleeps beside me  Doesn't know it's even there  Little pieces of my past  That I shouldn't have to share   A napkin that is stained with time  Has a poem on it that didn't quite rhyme, but it made me cry  In a 'Dear Jane' letter from a different guy  He broke up with me and he told me I'm not always right  And a stolen key from an old hotel room door  In the back of the bottom drawer   I don't keep these things 'cause I'm longing to go back  I keep them because I want to stay right where I'm at  I'm reminded of my rights and wrongs  I don't want to mess this up  But I wouldn't know where I belong  Without this box of stuff   A birthday card from my first boyfriend  He signed it 'I love you' so I gave in  Yeah, we went too far in his daddy's car  And those Mardi Gras beads from '98  We danced all night, stayed out so late  We thought we were stars, closing down the bars  That champagne was cheap but still I've got that cork  In the back of the bottom drawer   I'm not trying to hide these things from the man I love today  But I'm a better woman for him, thanks to my yesterdays   So now I try to give more than I take  And I bite my tongue, fight the urge to say it's my way  Or no way at all  And now I cherish love a whole lot more  'Cause of what's  In the back of the bottom drawer

      I found out from  urlLink Brits  last week that there was a massive senior prank at my old school,  urlLink Baltimore Lutheran . The senior prank consisted of having dead animals planted in different spots all over campus, including a dead deer hanging from the flag pole in the front of the school. Apparantly, the five seniors involved were Titus Bickel (son of Pastor Bickel, the religion teacher), Dan Szumla, Gordy Griffin, Tim Watts, and Mark Kammerer, all students I went to school with. In fact, Mark was a friend of mine then, and teammate on my freshman baseball team. I knew him well. From what people tell me, and what was said on the news, my other former classmates are angry that they get to graduate with them and that there is no punishment. I guess I would be too!  About MY graduation, it was really cool. When I went across the stage and got my diploma, I had to flip my tassle. When I flipped it, it fell off. I had to put it on off the stage before I sat down. It was embarrassing. Some other people had tassle problems too, like it wouldn't flip, or they forgot to flip it. Either way, it was really funny. It's kind of depressing, because several people I got to know well and like, and not long after, I leave and I may talk to some of them through the summer, but realistically, I will probably never see or hear from any of them afterward. The same thing happened at BLS. I talk to very few people that I went to school with. Well, "that's the way the cookie crumbles" I guess.  Well, I'll blog you later! That's all from the newly graduated Mike!   In Christ, Mike <>

      That post yesterday was a really cool thing. Now, if I can't get in touch with Blogger.com, I can E-mail a post to an e-mail address I chose to have through Blogger, the subject of the E-mail being the subject of my post, and the body as the post. It's so cool. I also have  urlLink Audioblogger . When I'm away I have 85 ways to post still! Woo hoo!   I graduate tomorrow! Woo freaking hoo! It feels weird because it's not BLS. I hate to admit it, but I kind of miss the place. I miss Laura, I miss SWolf, Henn Jr. (Danny Gobble), Tyler, Waggle (Miranda Weigel), etc. It's weird. I never thought I'd miss anything. I guess you never know what you have until it's gone. As the song says, "You don't know what you got 'til it's gone." (Counting Crows,  Big Yellow Taxi )  Whelp, I gotta go! Problems to take care of! Laterness!  In Christ, Mike <>

      Hey guys! It's been about three weeks since I blogged. You need to hear about camp. Also, intertwined, you will hear about everything with my camp "ladies". Then, you need to hear about how my life is going overall. Also,&nbsp;some pictures from camp will be on my webspace, and I will link you to them in my next blog.&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First off, Steve didn't get to go to camp.&nbsp;When I got there, my counselor seemed kind of corny, because he was trying to do a "get to know you" time, while I was trying to find Kari, Jess, Michelle,&nbsp;Dave Smith&nbsp;and more. So I compromised and found a way to get all of both in when I first got there. The first person I saw was Jess, the one I saw two months ago to begin with. She was in the line registering when we were. Next, I saw  urlLink Karen  and  urlLink Jenn  Bertsche (sisters- Karen is older). Karen&nbsp;ran at me full force&nbsp;in order to hug&nbsp;me (practically glomping me- "glomp" is Drea Davis' word for what Karen did), while Jenn just shook my hand.&nbsp; Next, I saw Kari. I saw her register and then I ran in order to see her with her mom and "sis" Erika.&nbsp; When I yelled "Hi" as I ran, Kari turned around, and "attacked" me when hugging me. Then, I was sitting in the gazebo by the youth tabernacle with Kari and Jenn, and Michelle walked out of it with several of her friends. I yelled "Hello" and Michelle, like the rest, ran at me full force and glomped me with all she had. Then she sat on my lap so the other side of&nbsp;the gazebo&nbsp;would not stain her clothes&nbsp;(green mildew or mold on the back of the seat).&nbsp; My roomates were Steve and Ty (cousins) also from Middlebury Center PA where Karen and Jenn are from, Eric Ruby (AKA Ruby), and my counselor Dave Barber (AKA Barbie), from  urlLink Lancaster Bible College  (who can be found in the picture  urlLink here  of Proof, the LBC group that counselled this year&nbsp;- Dave is the guy with the curly black hair in the gray shirt in the middle).  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As soon as I got to camp God spoke stronger than ever. He convicted me of all the things I was putting before Him. He wrapped His arms around me and basically said, "I know why you're here this year. I know what you expect to get out of camp. So I'll give it to you right now. I love you. I know why you've replaced me, and I know what you have replaced me with, but I forgive you. You're my son and I love you."  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The&nbsp;next things I will mention are my injuries. Monday morning heading to breakfast, I got lazy, so instead of getting on the porch by the ramp, I jumped on it like I always used to do, but this time banged right onto the porch on my shins. The scabs from that just now left my legs. Monday night right before everyone began playing the treasure hunt thing, I busted up my arm falling off of A-Tel-1's steps. It had a huge gash and lots of big bruises and swelling to the point that it didn't look like an elbow anymore. It was ridiculous. When I got my arm bandaged up and got a sling to help bring down the swelling, and sat in my A-Tel for a couple minutes alone, Satan found my weakest moment and attacked. He gave me a weird fear and told me that if I didn't leave camp that day, I'd leave camp in a body bag, but yet in my despair, I confused it with a message from God.&nbsp;I told Penny Espenshade, a counselor I have known for years,&nbsp;about it, and she told me to go see Paris, the head of the counselors. Paris got Dave to sit with us, and the three of us talked about it. Dave had me discern the difference between the two feelings of God speaking during the sessions, and the fear I had in the A-Tel. &nbsp;Easily, the difference was that God's was a warm feeling that I was His and He loved me and wrapped His loving arms around me in my time of need. The other was a fear unlike any fear I've ever had, and it felt evil. Dave said he once had the same trouble and confused an attack from Satan with a warning from God before. I decided to battle Satan and stay. It was the best decision I ever made.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My team was team number 4, God's Archangels.&nbsp;We eventually came up with a&nbsp;cheer that ripped off the song "Na Na Hey Hey Hey Goodbye" that said, "Archangels! God's Archangels! Mess with us and you will die! Archangels, God's Archangels! We send Satan to Hell!" Our team was first place, second was&nbsp;"God's Gostoppo", the team of the only other high school graduate this year, Dave Smith, known as the boy with the weird patch of back hair. Kari, Jenn,&nbsp;and Michelle were part of the team that came in last. My team members were my roommates&nbsp;Steve and Ty, 6 girls, most of which were related, and "Grandpa" Dave and "Grandma" Shelly Samaria who is part of the  urlLink Roberts Wesleyan University &nbsp;Youth Ministry Team. Grandma and Grandpa were the affectionate nicknames they had because Mister and Miss felt weird.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We played carpet pool, a weird ghetto game that Tim, the camp director created, and all kinds of stuff. Most memorable of games was "Gross Factor", spinoff of "Fear Factor"&nbsp;including a mixture of water and a couple dozen containers of cheese balls, making a nasty mixture when the cheese mixed with the water and the cheese balls were all soggy, and we had to dunk our heads in to get fireball candies from the bottom with our mouths. It was so nasty. Our team won that one. I was surprised with the girls we had. It freaked them out, but they were awesome, and handled it so well. I was so proud of them! Also, we did a water balloon target game, where you must use your body to block your target and one of our balloons ended up crushing a girl's hand to the point that she needed treatment.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now, I must bust open the relationship issues. Michelle and my roomate Ruby once dated, and were going to again, but Ruby had to break off the idea saying that he was not going to get into a relationship to have to break it off when his schedule filled up too much in a couple months. Frankly, Michelle is awesome and&nbsp;deserves the best, so she should be careful, and also I am sort of glad Ruby could realize that and be sure that he knew what he was getting himself into. Also, I was intending to ask Jess out soon, but I could tell that wasn't where I was supposed to be. The more I hung out with her, the more I felt God saying, "No no. No no." (That was also something Laura Hetke always said so obnoxiously to everyone! "No no. No no. No no.")  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now to talk about all the great talks we had in our group devos.&nbsp; In morning group devos, "Grandpa" Dave and "Grandma" Shelly led all kinds of relationships discussions and everything, and taught us the basics of a good Christian walk with God, how to live that way, knowing God's will, and choosing the perfect partner. They did well. In our guys-only devos at night, we had great talks that included treating ladies like godly men, and lots of thought provoking, mind blowing topics. When I was talking about how far I wander from God sometimes, "Grandma" Shelly especially told me about a Petra song that states, "Though you've walked a thousand miles, He's just a step behind."  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dave Smith was the only other graduate. Because of that, we got closer during the week. He used to just scare me because of that weird patch of back hair, but now we got to talking, espcially Thursday night when we took our "last walk" of the camp late that night and ended up playing some small pranks on the camp including putting the picnic tables up in pyramids and flipping&nbsp;some over.&nbsp;We messed withe every picnic table and every chair on the campgrounds except those in&nbsp;the guys' and girls' areas, so they wouldn't have any clue who was the culprit.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dave and I were both in the talent show. Dave sang with Brenda Bittner and then Brenda dedicated a song to him that she wrote for her graduating class at her school. Michelle, Kari, Jenn, Mrs. Carolyn and Miss Kim sang "The Storm is Passing Over" with Michelle on piano. That was awesome. I played guitar and sang, performing Sonicflood's song "Lord Over All" completely acoustic. I've been told I was really good, so I trust everyone. Dave then ended the talent show singing "A Whole New World" like he did two years ago, a duet he did on his own. It's so weird it's awesome. I can get a hold of a small video of part of it if I beg Kari enough to send it to me from her digital camera.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I made several new friends, including Mary (AKA Kess&nbsp;Shanks/Longshanks), Becca (AKA Ber), Emily,&nbsp;Nate, Jon (AKA Bob, a name given to him by his counselor the year before that caught on to everyone else)&nbsp;and Michelle's friend Amanda.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The last day and also the time after the talent show were hard for some of us. Dave and I both cried, and Kari ran over to Dave and hugged him, in tears,&nbsp;then came to me, hugged me and cried harder, and then went back to Dave and then came back to me. The last day she just hugged us both. And of course you can't forget Michelle, whose total hugs with me that week came to about 762.3. (Kidding. Probably about 20 really!)  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We had a great time, and I'm sure how long this is, you were bored poopless reading this thing. Well, Kari is probably having a great time reading this, laughing a bit at some of the things she remembers from this. And of course I am glad I get to archive this for as long as my page exists because I want to keep this entry to remember everything.   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Anyway, as for life, I am getting a little irritated with my job, and I am considering leaving. I am definately looking for another job once I turn 18, but I am considering not waiting and getting a carry-over job and when I turn 18, getting an even better job that requires you to be 18. I still have no idea what I am doing, where I am going, or if I am even to have a future. I keep telling everyone that if I don't figure it out soon, I'll be living in a cardboard box. Once people yell at me, I say, "Hey, well at least moving will be easy!" Nah, I'm not afraid, "for I know who holds the future and I know who holds my hand." (from "Because He Lives" by Bill and Gloria Gaither)   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Well that is all for now! (Finally!) Anyway, blog ya later and more often!   In Christ,  Mike  <>

      Now that it's been almost a month, I'll blog again. I am busy working at Wendy's again, the new one in Abingdon. It's pretty cool.   Steve and I have  urlLink camp  in exactly a week. I get to see Kari again after 2 years, and Jess after two months. I am so excited to see Kari! It's been so long!!!! We've been so close so long, and now we can finally see each other again.   Anyway, not much is really going on. It's getting sort of ridiculous that nothing is going on.    I am about 2-3 weeks from my license. I've gotten a lot of driving time in (including taking my car for a ride without my parents- shh! Don't tell anyone I broke the law, okay?), and I'm almost there.   Also, I don't want to spill the beans, so I won't give it away yet, but something new and exciting should happen in my life soon, if God so wills. It's not that spectacular or anything, nothing that hasn't happened before, but you know...  Anyway, that's all for now. Comment about stuff. I promise I'll get back to blogging!  In Christ, Mike <>
