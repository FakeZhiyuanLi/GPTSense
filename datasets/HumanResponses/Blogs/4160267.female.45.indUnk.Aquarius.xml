       The question in my profile requested me to write lyrics to a new national anthem using an animal sound more than once.  Well, there was barely any room to write a thought.  Here it is      Sound:   OINK, use your imagination to figure out who in your life this may apply to.      Lyrics:   (okay, probably won't fit to music, but it is deep)                   What happened to our glory?                We were settled by people looking for freedom of belief, why are we settling for narrow-minded, intolerant, hatriotic, war mongering leadership?      Over the past few years I've had a growing embarassment of being an American. I feel I should become more politically aware/active, but when I try I am so overwhelmed by all the double-speak.  After 9/11, with all the blind patriotism, turning into hatriotism, it's gotten worse.  People grumbling that Kerry is so much like Bush, we don't really have a choice, but since when hasn't the election been about the lesser of two evils?  By the time a politician has gotten far enough to be at that level he's gotten pretty good at deal making (double) and lost alot of ethics along the way.        Leaving politics out of it (if we can) just look at our education system, healthcare, lack of compassion or consideration for one another, selfishness, disrespect for our elderly and our planet.  I wish I knew what I could do.  I've tried to make a difference, working in nursing homes for 8 years  (horror stories),  volunteering ( can't stand the grandstanding) .  What a world!

       This is my first blog.  Now that I've done it I'm not sure what to say.  I just got turned on to this phenomenon yesterday while searching for a laptop sleeve for my new teeny tiny Sony Vaio.  Anyway, got sent to a girl's post about her search for a similar bag.  What's this? I said.  I know that my daughter and her friends are into on-line jounaling, but this was cooler.  She had pictures and stuff.  I read one girl's blog today, who does most of her entries as haiku-like poems.  I am not that gifted.  I will probably keep 2 blogs.... this one for spewing (there will be positive commentary and REALITY BITES commentary), and another where I can post notes and photos for my mom and aunties who live back east.        This is the link to a band CD that my daughter gave me that really enrgizes me.   urlLink http://www.pinkpanther.com/music/   ( something positive )
