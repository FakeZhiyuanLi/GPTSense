      Currently Listening: Mix Mob I don't give a fuck about you, you don't give a fuck about me.  &nbsp;  We don't need a new president. We don't need the old one either. We need a true leader. Someone who speaks for us as humans sharing a planet with many breeds of the same. When a true leader walks our land we will know, we will listen, and we will follow effortlessly. There won't be any campaigns and there will be no marketing. This leaders presence, words, values, integrity and heart will be desired by all of the world. the power of faith this man will obtain, not only from people in america, but everyone around the world, will be the reason our governments will feel threatened and take actions to remove this person from our quest for humanity. This leader will speak from his heart and be adored by all walks of life. This leader will become so powerful that our constitutions will be over ridden and rewritten to reflect a society once dreamed of and now forgotten in our corrupt universe. People like JFK and Martin Luther King were these types of leaders. If they were left in peace to continue their journey through life we may have seen such a thing, but they were removed from existance because they were too powerful and considered a threat to the people behind the government. These people do not want this leader to exist. They want us to choose our president from their shady "he's better than the other two guys" roster. Out of all the people in the world we are left with two or three human beings to settle with as our savior? Of course. this is the way it works for them. so weigh out the pros and cons and make your decision. This is pathetic.&nbsp;I love america.&nbsp;I love the whole fucking world.&nbsp;I love the idea of world peace. This leader will walk amongst us very soon. It will be undeniable. People will follow. People will talk.&nbsp;A following will rapidly build into a voice like we have never heard before. This leader will not have chosen to be the one and will not be trying to convince anyone of his heart and intentions. We will know when that time has come. The more our technology can cause awareness, the more it will be too complicated for our government to erase this leader. Everything happens for a reason. we have become victims of a corrupt government that is thriving on the ignorance they insist we are made of. We have to get perspective and look at the big picture. We are the playing pieces for a game of control and power played by the people who see humanity as something disposable. As for the presidents, i will always have hope in the chance of that leader actualy being one of the candidates. If it is so then let it be and i will know in my heart that it is the one. This leader will not need to be re-elected because he will rewrite the book on how we govern our societies and remian our leader until he is no longer a leader. Maybe i think too much. maybe i don't think enough.&nbsp;I have never been so concerned about our well being as a world as i have become today.&nbsp;I am a dreamer and have hope. That's a good start for me.&nbsp;I think i am making no sense sometimes when my mind is in utopia. It's time to be aware. Think about your decisions. Go with your heart. Things can only get better, right? Let's go vote.

       Currently Listening&nbsp;&nbsp;    John Frusciante - Will 2 Death    &nbsp;  The next three releases after "The Will To Death" will be:   Ataxia: "Automatic Writing"- Release Date: 10th August 2004   Frusciante: "The DC EP"- Release Date: 14th September 2004    Tracklisting:   1.Dissolve   2.Goals   3.A Corner   4.Repeating    &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;  there is a place inside of me that i want to go whenever i possibly can, but when i go there i feel so sad in a happy way that i get lost inside the feeling and want everything i do to feel like this. it is not a sadness. it is more like my sense memory taking me to a place of comfort in some space and time that i cannot quite put my finger on. it is definitely a place in my past. somewhere when i was first embracing my sensitive side and feeling all alone in the world for the first time. i remember thinking that i would never be understood by anyone. i had no connection to my parents except for the fact the they had raised me and i was obligated to have a connection with them. my friends weren't really friends except for a few lone dogs who had the same situation going on in their lives. i would sneak out of my house in the middle of the night and walk for miles at a time. i wasn't scared of anything because all i knew of being scared was left back at home and i was free for the time being. the music i saturated myself in was all that looped in my head. &nbsp;it was all stored inside my mind. the words, the tones, the lack of structure that my music gave me let me be who i really was. it let me find the courage to face my fears and push them aside with no regards to ever letting them back in my way. i was free. i was innocent. i was living. now i yearn to find those feelings again. they come in spurts and are too slippery to keep a hold of most of the time. when they escape me and my mind i put on a song that channels me directly into that world and i wallow in my frustration. all i can feel is in this moment. everything. all senses maxed out. the song looping right now takes me to that place. i don't know why and i don't care to know as long as the song exists and delivers on this level. those moments we hold on to in our souls are the very fuel we will use to continue to replace for the rest of our lives. this i know because i am living it. i am really living it. the more it loops the more i become a prisoner of this feeling. i only want it to last forever. is that too much to ask? is it?!!!!!!! fucking is it?!!!!!!!! my answer is absolutely not. we are individuals living as best&nbsp;as&nbsp;we can, the individual, has figured out how. there is no guide book to our particular lives. no one has written our book specifically. we write our own as we go and no one will ever write the same. you are one. no one will equal to your one. no one. no one is equal. everyone is superior to everyone. you are existing in a life that has never existed. and you will leave a life that will never be again. this is your contribution to you. when you feel complete you will have no reason to ever do anything again until you feel incomplete. live your life for you without fear of affecting anyone else's life. your ability to give will only be enhanced if you are truly a giver. go with your instincts. trust yourself. understand yourself. the rest is natural. sorry for going on and on here. i am feeling very sensitive right now. it is 2:50 am in hell (aka peru). what am i doing up? why am i on my computer and not with the girl of my dreams? good question that has an answer. figure it out.

      currently listening---> RHCP Live @ Hyde Park (import)    - hurt. i wonder what it would feel like to actually have the desire to want to hurt someone today. would i feel like the same person and just think it was normal or would i know something was wrong with it and still continue to have the desire because something was a little unbalanced upstairs? sometimes i think people try to hurt people because they are hurting inside. this makes it easiest to forgive those who hurt me. forgiving someone is much harder and more powerful than hurting someone could ever be. i feel fortunate to know in my mind that i never deliberately want to hurt anyone for any reason at any time. there were blind moments in early days as a teenager when i knew no better and just thought it was cool to do anything against the grain, even if it called for hurting someone else. at some point i just grew up a little bit and made it past that stage because i realized i was only hurting myself. thank God for that. if you are being hurt or have been hurt by someone deliberately taking a stab at you i suggest that you sigh in relief and know that the person hurting you just doesn't know any better and is probably too insecure for their own good right now. hurt. sometimes it doesn't hurt so much. sometimes it hurts terribly bad. we're all victims in one way or another. take it like a grain of salt.

      Currently Listening Too: 311 the omaha sessions  live it learn it    Anyway, finding myself with no computer, no AIM, no LOLs, and lots of free time, I enrolled in an independent study of film. Which really is just a codeword for the embarrassing amount of movies I have been watching lately. Though even with the limited knowledge gained from my sordid fake film class, I have still managed identify an absurd summer movie trend becoming more ubiquitous: the Hollywood cash crop known as the villain versus villain crapfest (i.e. last summer’s Freddy versus Jason, this summer’s upcoming Alien versus Predator).  Like a child with two black eyes, Hollywood just does not learn. Sure, for scriptwriters these movies are probably easy. Take two already established characters and pair them against each other. That’s easier than an insecure freshmen girl trying to “make friends”. But like that coquettish freshmen it also does a ton of sucking. These films are never good. Not even when Jesus took on The Cross in The Passion.  Getting back to this summer’s big face off, Alien versus Predator, it is going to be absurd. Predator is going to own those crappy aliens like the aforementioned black-eyed kid is completely owned by his abusive father. Come on, his name is Predator implying he predates people/aliens/retarded babies. Also he looks like Little John giving him plenty of street credit.  In any case here are some of my crappy suggestions for possible Hollywood face-offs...Michael Moore versus the Atkins diet– As Michael Moore looks to take down the Bush administration, he’s inadvertently also taken down a few thousand cheeseburgers. For this documentary lets hold the politics, along with the extra cheese. There will be no right wing, no left wing, no buffalo wings; just Moore’s mammoth ass in excruciating carb-less agony.  I-Robot versus Zack Morris’ cell phone– For starters, Will Smith can eat a fart. The guy stinks. For this movie, instead of a superlative “I,” there’ll be a Y. As in Y-is Fresh Prince alive, let along making movies? I’ll ruin the ending to this one and tell you that Zack’s phone is actually Optimums Prime. Also, Vin Diesel’s gay. That has nothing to do with this movie, just thought I’d let you know.  Bill Cosby versus the Black Community– Big Bill made a bold step from Jello commercials to social commentary. What was this dude thinking? The only brotha I can see having Bill’s back is Uncle Tom, and Uncle Tom’s a pussy. The key to this movie is it would have to contain the essentials of a good rap video, which are “fly-ass bitches,” 40s and/or marijuana cigarettes, and a bunch of random black guys. This movie would culminate with Bill’s epiphany symbolized by “brushing his shoulder off.”  That Dancing guy from the Six Flag Commercials versus Megan’s Law– Ok, I don’t know if anyone else noticed, but that dancing old guy is a COMPLETE pedophile. He’s got all the credentials of a kid toucher; those credentials being: a.) he’s old b.) he drives a huge suspicious van c.) he picks up random kids. On the one hand I respect the guys work. I mean, the old coot can cut a mean rug and it’s great to see him incorporating pop culture into the molestation of children. But on the other hand I hate that Vegaboys song he dances to. Get’em Megan’s Law!  So with all that said and done i am goin to play this new guitar and put out some juicy beats.
