      Hello to anyone who's reading this. I've been on vacation since Saturday, Dec. 21 and haven't been able to go online since then. It's so hard to find internet connection in the boondoks. Anyway, I've been to Negros Occidental and stayed in a place called Kabankalan and it's really, really... ummm... oriental... no... make that, really, really so far from civilization. Am I making any sense? Whatever. Anyway, that's where I've been and right now I'm in Antipolo although just last night, I was in a ship and was feeling drunk from all the wavering of the ship from the waves. Wooohhh... At least I was still able to top the Karaoke with Puff the Magic Dragon. And I didn't vomit or anything like that even with all the food I ate. :p

      Today is Sunday. It's actually tonight now and in just a few more minute ( 16 minutes to be exact) it's going to be Monday. I hate Mondays. When I was in High School, I would dread Mondays for after the decadence of two days sleeping till the sun is already half past the sky, I'd have to drag myself from bed, tossing and turning and groaning. Wanting to go back to sleep and yet can't. I would think to myself, I swear I won't get a morning class when I'm in college. I won't. I won't! I WON'T!!! And then what happens? Even though my classes are already afternoon ones, I still find myself dragging myself from bed, tossing and turning and groaning. *sigh* I guess I'm just a lazy bum, after all.  Rox ^_^

      Why is life like this? Karl is moving to another country and I won't be having any contact with him for a month. What am I going to do without him? I won't be able to get anything at all about him.I'll be severed. I'll be nothing. Ok, I'm overreacting but still... I'll miss him. *loud wail* To those who don't know who Karl is... never mind.

      Ayaw mo talaga ako tantanan tungkol d'yan ah. *_* According to Oxford Paperback Dictionary Fourth Edition, reliogion   noun     1   belief in and worship of a superhuman controlling power, especially a God or gods.   2   a particular system of faith and worship;   the Christian religion.     3   a controlling influence on a person's life;   football is his religion     4   life under monastic vows. According to Webster Dictionary of the English Language, it actually comes from the LAtin words religio and onis.  From the Grolier Encyclopedia: Religion is a complex phenomenon, defying definition or summary. Almost as many definitions and theories of religion exist as there are authors on the subject. In the broadest terms, three approaches are generally taken to the scholarly study of religion: the historical, the phenomenological, and the behavioral or social-scientific. SCHOLARLY APPROACHES The historical approach deals, of necessity, with texts, whether these be the doctrinal, devotional, or ritual texts that stem from the religious community per se or secular documents such as statistics through which the historian attempts to reconstruct the religious life of a community. The historians may weave both types of documents together to create a rich sense of the role of religion in the life of a people as a whole. A particularly fine recent example of this approach is Le Roy Ladurie's Montaillou (1975; Eng. trans., 1978), in which the social and economic life of a small medieval French village is seen against the backdrop of religious heterodoxy. The phenomenological study of religion, although often starting with the results of the historian, is directed toward discovering the nature of religion--the fundamental characteristics that lie behind its historical manifestations. In this particular field the classic treatment remains Gerardus van der Leeuw's Religion in Essence and Manifestation: A Study in Phenomenology (1933; Eng. trans., 1938). Many scholars of comparative religion, such as Mircea Eliade, may also be said to fall into this category, although their relations to the historical traditions are often complex. The phenomenological tradition has been criticized, both by the historians and the social scientists, for losing sight of the details of particular religions in overly general comparison and speculation, but contemporary scholars are attempting to overcome these problems by dissolving the artificial boundaries between the disciplines. A clear example of this tendency may be seen in the rise of social scientific studies of religion in the last hundred years. Psychology, sociology, and especially anthropology have contributed great depth to the understanding of religious phenomena. In the psychology of religion, the two most important figures remain William James and Sigmund Freud. James's Varieties of Religious Experience (1902) established a set of topics and approaches to those topics that set the overall tone for much later work in the field. While James dealt primarily with conscious expressions of religious experience, Freud and the psychoanalytic tradition stemming from him attempted to fit the various forms of religious experience into the framework of a general theory of the unconscious. C. G. Jung in particular has been influential among interpreters of religion, in part, no doubt, as the best-developed alternative to Freud himself. One problem usually associated with the psychological approach is the difficulty of moving from the individual's experience to the structure and experience of the religious community. This problem has been confronted by the sociological and the anthropological traditions since the last third of the 19th century. William Robertson Smith, Emile Durkheim, and Max Weber were the leading figures in creating a sociological tradition in the analysis of religion. The year 1922 is sometimes taken as marking the beginning of modern anthropology and with it the complex studies of existing cultures and their religions that have done much to illuminate contemporary thought about religion. In that year Bronislaw Malinowski and A. R. Radcliffe-Brown published studies based on in-depth field work in foreign cultures. Their functionalist approach to the analysis of religion became a school, from which a steady flow of detailed studies of religion in cultural context continues unabated. Perhaps the most eminent figure in this tradition was Sir Edward Evans-Pritchard, whose influential works continue to serve as points of departure for analysts of religion. Meanwhile, a French tradition was developing out of the school of Durkheim that was in some ways analogous with and in others opposed to the British school. In this context structure has played a role akin to that of function. Claude Levi-Strauss has developed a complex theory of the way in which religious symbol and myth are transformed in the articulation by a culture of the cosmos in which it finds itself. This brief treatment cannot do justice to the variety of approaches to the study of religion, but one thing should be made clear. Any approach taken in isolation from the others will lead to distortion and bias. The attempt to integrate a number of theories stemming from a wealth of traditions is necessary to grasp the character of the religions of the world. CHARACTERISTICS OF RELIGION Keeping in mind the dangers of general characterizations, what are the distinctive features of religion? Several concepts may be isolated that, even though not necessary or sufficient conditions if taken separately, may jointly be considered "symptomatic" of religions.    The Holy Religious belief or experience is usually expressed in terms of the holy or the sacred. The holy is usually in opposition to the everyday and profane and carries with it a sense of supreme value and ultimate reality. The holy may be understood as a personal God, as a whole realm of gods and spirits, as a diffuse power, as an impersonal order, or in some other way. Although the holy may ultimately be nothing but the social order, a projection of the human mind, or some sort of illusion, it is nevertheless experienced in religion as an initiating power, coming to human life and touching it from beyond itself. Religions frequently claim to have their origin in revelations, that is, in distinctive experiences of the holy coming into human life. Such revelations may take the form of visions (Moses in the desert), inner voices (Muhammad outside Mecca), or events (Israel's exodus from Egypt; the divine wind, or kamikaze, which destroyed the invading Mongol fleet off Japan; the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ). Revelations may be similar to ordinary religious experience, but they have a creative originating power from which can flow an entire religious tradition.    Response Response to the holy may take the form of participation in and acquiescence to the customs and rituals of a religious community or of a commitment of faith. Faith is not merely belief but an attitude of persons in which they commit themselves to the holy and acknowledge its claim upon them. In a deeply religious person, faith commitment tends to shape all of that person's life and character.    Beliefs As religious traditions develop, they generate systems of belief with respect to both practice and doctrine. These systems serve to situate the members of the religious tradition in the world around them and to make intelligible this world in relation to the holy. In early or primitive traditions this practice and doctrine usually find expression in bodies of myth (see mythology) or in ritual law. In those traditions which develop an extensive literate class, theology often comes to supplant myth as the vehicle for refining and elaborating belief. The more this happens, the more the belief system has to be evaluated. The importance attached to right belief ("orthodoxy") has varied from religion to religion and from period to period. It has loomed large in Christianity, as for example in the great Christological and Trinitarian controversies from the 3d century onward.    Rituals and Liturgy Religious traditions almost invariably involve ritual and liturgical forms as well as systems of belief. These may take the form of sacrifice or sacrament, passage rites, or invocations of God or the gods. The most important cultic acts are in most cases those performed by the entire community or a significant portion of it, although in many traditions private devotional forms such as prayer, fasting, and pilgrimage are also practiced. A distinction is often made between religion and magic in this context. In magic, attempts are made to manipulate divine forces through human acts. In truly cultic acts such as prayer and sacrifice, the prevailing attitude is one of awe, worship, and thanksgiving. Participation in communal rituals marks a person as a member of the community, as being inside and integral to the community that is articulated in the system of beliefs. That in many traditions the disfavor of the community is expressed in its barring a person from the important cultic acts is not surprising because these acts insure the proper standing of the individual and community in relation to the holy.    Ethical Codes Connected with beliefs is yet another aspect of religion, the possession of an ethical code incumbent upon the members of the community. This is particularly evident in highly structured societies such as India, where the caste system is an integral part of traditional Hinduism. Marduk in ancient Babylon and Yahweh in ancient Israel were believed to be the authors of the laws of those nations, thus giving these laws the weight and prestige of holiness. The prophets of Israel were social critics who claimed that righteous acts rather than cultic acts are the true expression of religion. As religions develop, they come to place increasing stress on the ethical, and sometimes religion is almost totally absorbed into morality, with only a sense of the holiness of moral demands and a profound respect for them remaining.    Community Although religious solitaries exist, most religion has a social aspect that leads its adherents to form a community, which may be more or less tightly organized. In earlier times the religious community could scarcely be distinguished from the community at large; all professed the same faith, and the ruler was both a political and a religious leader. In the course of time, however, religious and civil societies have become distinct and may even come into conflict. In modern secular states--India and the United States, for example--a plurality of religious communities coexist peacefully within a single political entity. Each religious community, whether in a pluralistic or homogeneous society, has its own organized structure. A common though by no means universal feature of these religious organizations is a priesthood (see priest) charged with teaching and transmitting the faith and performing liturgical acts. FORMS OF RELIGIOUS EXPERIENCE The complex phenomenon described above constitutes what may be called the religious experience of humankind. In different religions and in different individuals, one or more of the characteristics mentioned may predominate, whereas others may be weak or almost nonexistent. This difference explains why religion is best treated as a polymorphous concept and why it is better to see religions as linked by variable family likenesses than by some constant but elusive essence.    Basic Forms Even though many varieties of religious experience exist, they seem to occur in two basic forms. In the first, the sense of the holy is conjoined markedly with an awareness of human finitude. This conjunction is expressed by the characterization of religion by Friedrich Schleiermacher as a "feeling of absolute dependence"; it might be called the negative approach to religious experience. The awareness of the holy is set against the foil of finitude, sinfulness, and meaninglessness. At an earlier stage in his career, however, Schleiermacher defined religion differently--as the "sense and taste for the Infinite." Here the awareness of the holy is conjoined with the human experience of transcendence, of going beyond every state of existence to a fuller existence that lures on the human being. This method may be called the affirmative approach. Although one approach or another may dominate, both belong to the full range of religious experience. Both find their place in Rudolf Otto's classic, The Idea of the Holy (1917; Eng. trans., 1923), as a person's encounter with the mysterium tremendum et fascinans. Mysterium points to the otherness of the holy; tremendum to its overwhelmingness in relation to human finitude; and fascinans to the lure that draws individuals out of and beyond themselves. Otto's work has been regarded as a masterly achievement in the phenomenology of religious experience.    Validity of Religious Experience The question about the validity of religious experience must also be raised. Do religious people or worshiping communities encounter a holy reality that is outside of themselves and other than anything purely natural? Schleiermacher believed that the capacity for religious experience is universal in human beings. He therefore claimed that it could be accepted as self-authenticating and could take the place of the traditional proofs offered for the existence of God. Few people today would concede Schleiermacher's claim. Not only might they deny having the kinds of experiences he described; they might also suggest quite different interpretations for them. Many traditional revelations, which seemed to be miracles in a prescientific age, might now be judged as natural events or coincidences. Inner voices and private visions might be explained psychologically as subconscious mental processes. From Ludwig Feuerbach to Freud, belief in God has been explained as a projection of the human mind; Karl Marx and other social analysts have seen religious belief as the product of socioeconomic forces. Each of these naturalistic explanations of religious belief has drawn attention to some element that enters into the religious complex, but it may be questioned whether such theories account exhaustively for the phenomenon of religion. The question about the validity of religious experience must ultimately be dealt with by returning to rational arguments for and against theism or, more broadly, for and against the existence of some holy reality, despite Schleiermacher's arguments to the contrary.    A Typology Any typology that attempts an ordering of religions is the product of a particular tradition in which others are seen relatively to its own centrality. For instance, starting from the perspective of the Christian experience of the holy as both transcendent and immanent makes possible the construction of a series in which the various traditions are related more or less closely to Christianity insofar as they emphasize one or the other. That is, Christian tradition strongly asserts the transcendence of God as an essential element in its Judaic heritage, but it just as strongly insists upon the immanence of God in the incarnation and in the sacraments. Roughly speaking, Judaism and Islam fall on the transcendent side of the series, whereas Hinduism and Buddhism fall more on the immanent. A detailed analysis along these lines, taking into account the variety of traditions within Christianity, reveals illuminating affinities, as for example between Calvinism and Islam and among the various mystical traditions. Thus the construction of a typology, despite the limitations of any given perspective, draws attention to both the unity and diversity of religions.    Conclusion In a world where the status and future of religion is in so many ways uncertain, understanding of religious concepts is not likely to be reached with extreme views, whether this extremism takes the form of a dogmatic and isolationist claim to the superiority of an individual's own faith or a vague blurring of the genuine differences among the traditions. A middle ground must be established by those who accept the need for patient dialogue to uncover and explore both the agreements and disagreements among the religions. This third way aims at deepening the commitment and understanding of religious groups in their own traditions while at the same time making them more open to and ready to learn from other traditions.  If you think about it, the words in the modern English language which may be based on the ancient language of Greek, Latin and others, may not necessarily have the same meanings as the words from which they originate. For example, thw word morph which comes from the Greek word morphe which means form and yet it is used to mean change. Words change as well as their meanings. It's only up to you on how you define it.  I won't go on about paganism anymore but try being more open-minded about some things, please.

      Religion originated from a greek word (i'm not sure if i'm correct) "religio" (there were two words actually) which means reconcilliation with God. "Reconcillation" means reconciling, coming back from something, bringing back the trust & faith... Now, if paganism is a religion, who are they trying to reconcile with? The god of evil or another god that i haven't heard about? No offense, anyways... ^_^  Now you understand why i can't be and shouldn't be in your puzz?

      Uh huh. Sure. If you don't consider paganism a type of religion, then obviously you haven't checked your dictionary on its meaning.   Don't think that I'm annoyed, ganyan lang talaga ako. If I were in front of you at that moment you think I'm annoyed. After I yell at you, I'd smile and giggle annoyingly. You have to understand, I have a neurologist (for real) and she says I have this psycotic or was that neurotic disorder. Anyway, that.  Don't say sorry about what you believe in. Say sorry if you've offended someone. I don't think you have offended me. Not yet, so far, anyway...

      I've finally understood the problem in posting dito. Actually, ok lang maglagay ng pic pero dapat ang source ay ok rin. For example, the pic Rai posted ay nakikita n'yo dahil sa ito ay may ayos na source. The first one with the black and white Raiha in it doesn't dahil bawal sa source. Sa second one, mahirap lang talagang i-steal dhail mahirap i-load dahil baka malayo ang source n'ya from the server of this blog or something like that. I'm not exactly sure what I'm talking about. Same goes pati sa website design.

      Would you like to post a pic or change the font of what you're writing? You only have to use html format or something like that. So now I've made this one   red and big!   Anyway, just saying. And if you want to put a pic, don't bother coz you won't be allowed to do it. Free lang kasi etong blog eh. I wonder if there's a way around that.

      hi fellows!it's been a while since i gave this blog a click. good thing i remembered my username and password! ryan,just a hint:many people kill because they're high on drugs.(..if the subject of the matter is still "psychedelic") i read lately that you have been smoking cigarettes.well,i'm not an actual smoker but in my opinion,you can smoke as you want to...anyway,i know you'll realize a lot of things sooner...everything will fall into its' place somehow.  looking forward for your thoughts on this,so keep posting.

      The more greater loss is when you take your own life... especially with "not-so-deep" reasons. People make it as an "escape goat" for problems that they think can't be solved. Or they could've been tired of living. I really don't know... that i don't want to do for my self-research. But its proven, taking another person's life makes you feel... different, but your conscience will hunt you if it's still strong. Many people kill others willingly without hesitation, and without any good reasons to kill.  So it was written...

       There are so many lost souls. So many people dead... Others because of natural disasters. Some of diseases. And others by accidents so unexpected that they still leave us thinking, how could this be happening? But the greatest loss is when one man takes the life of another. The world is at the brink of war. A war that will put countries againsts each other, one religion and another, different beliefs trying to push it's way to the top. It's so sad and so senseless. Everyone cares but the disaster comes closer and closer until everone gets consumed. Forethought will be too late.

      Err... i think i get his point. Sorry 'bout that...  Well, maybe for you it won't be a critical status to be "psychedelic", but when you're in there knowing nothing about what's going to happen next, then "kabloosh..." =P   But the reason i smoke? I really don't know. But now all i know is that i have this one "judgement stick" left in my W-Lights' case. If i take that one, i won't smoke again... darn.

      Well, just want to tell you what happened to me yesterday...  I wanted to see her badly. Even if she doesn't see me, i just want to see her. I went in front of St. Paul College, Cubao to wait for her outside. I came 2:40pm. I smoked 2 sticks of "Winston Lights" (sponsor, naks!) while waiting for her to come out. It was already 3:00, my sticks were all gone, and still no signs of her. I decided to wait 'till 3:30. I stood behind the shadows of the school's wall because the sunlight's pretty hot. It was on the opposite side where she goes out.   And i saw her walking alone, holding a book. I tried to follow her with a 4-meter distance (i think). I was thinking if i should talk to her or not, but i decided not to show myself to her (because she said she'll get mad at me if i go there without her permission). I was trembling, and my heart was pounding fast. She looked back, as if she knows someone's following her... and i looked back as well, where she won't see my face (good thing i wore bonnet and shades). Then she went to the other side of the road, and i stopped from following her... but i stayed at my current position and watched her leave. Watching her face, there seems to be anger... i don't know if it's from the school or if it's from somebody's trying to follow her.  Darn... then i went to SM Centerpoint to loose some tension and played DDR (Dancerev) and Percussion Freaks. But i just can't remove it from my mind... (sorry 'bout this, just posted a blog)

      Maybe "yes"... maybe "no"... i really don't know. But from the looks of it, currently, America seems to be the most powerful nation. Using its currency as the worldwide forex, playing with death against countries... spying on other countries without noticing... e hightek na cla eh! (but compared to Japan? I don't know...)  What do you think?  P.S. George Bush is a protestant.  Yun lang!

      How do you know what's the strongest nation. America may seem very strong but there are still a lot of loopholes and weaknesses inside it. If one thinks about it, China seems like a strong nation to me and Russia may seem divided but they still wear a mask to cover themselves from the world and we don't know what is behind that mask. Hmmm... Lot's of other strong nations and calling one the strongest may be true at one point but can be untrue in others.

Ala na ko magagawa, desision mo yan eh. Ika ko nga sa mga kasama ko: "Wag mo pilitin ang ayaw, pag pinilit mo, magdudugo..." which is true.  Keep ur mind opened, not too much, but opened. Open-minded ka naman eh... i can see that, dami ka pa kc dapat malaman. ^_^  Oh, well... so much for the puzzle. I may be similar to one of your missing pieces but i came from a different design. Even though it fits, it's mismatched. See? Hehehe... sensia na.   (Basta wag ka masiado magalit sa mga lalake... di naman lahat ng lalake gaya ng iniisip mo. Pansin ko lang... ^_^; )

Bwah, it's General Psychology anyway, and it is not really difficult.  But imagine getting higher grades than Dacasin....  HAHAHAHA!!!!   And, for the first time, I had a line of nine in HISTORY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!   Well, kasi naman midterm pa lang.  Check the finals and we'll see why I am distressed all the time.  I HATE DOUBTING MYSELF!!!  I have doubted everything: God, the world, sciences, all claims, all that was said, all left unsaid...  EVERYTHING EXCEPT EXISTENCE!  And that's only MY existence!!!  Why am I now doubting my superior capacity????    Wala, mayabang na.

I was trying to formalize it so a denomination with "0" at the end must do.  I could've done 20 or even 100 things I learned, but, bloody Hell, that's too much.  I'm just a small man.  With a hypoprocessed brain.  Now, this virginity thing is getting on my nerves.  Why is it that the people around me make me think they are NOT virgins?  I can almost believe, except I doubt it.  I mean just look at you people!   Well, unless you are not...and that means I'm totally mislead!!!!!!  Like what I said to Mando before, "Am I the only remaining virgin in the world??!!!"  Just to be saved here, I'm not saying he's not a V.  I just told him that to joke.  He didn't tell me anything.  Besides, if he did tell me, I'm sure I'm not the first to hear it.  But by God, he's so ... active.... in pursuits, ain't he?    And, my God Mark...you could've been influenced by your band mates!  You know, the Sex Drugs Rock 'n Roll thing?  Oh my GOD!!!!  wait, I don't have a God...  I AM the only V in the world!!!!!!  Children excluded.

Nah, la lang ako magawa. ^^,  And i'm currently typing some paperworks, actually... final report namin sa Physics Lab. Kala ko mag-grandslam kami na puro kami ang highest... kaso sa Experiment 3 namin, 2nd lang kami sa highest... :( Pero babawiin ko sa Final Report para sa groupmates ko. ^^,  (Aba, nag-aaral!

      I don't think critically-acclaimed is the right word considering how you're probably the only person in the whole wide world to have critiqued it.   These are my comments to that by number:  1. Karma supposedly returnes when the time is right so maybe if she had waited just a little longer, she would have gotten what's for her. 2. Look at it from his point of view, she's there. She feels as inadequate as she. Why wouldn't he? And it made it more tragic. I like writing sad endings. I don't know why. 3. I was actually going to make her pregnant with his child or *gasp* another guy's child but then, the leader nixed the idea because she said that Anna didn't seem like the type to have sex in such a short relationship (3 months, I think) with the guy. (Hah! As if the character was patterned on her behavior) But if one thinks about it, she's just such a wanna-be-perfect girlfriend that she probably would have agreed because of her need to give the guy everything she can and make him so happy. (In her point of view) Considering the patterns of today's youth, she would do the nasty with him.  But with your observation, I'd have to disagree, relationship with sex is much more bound to fail because sex puts a haze in a relationship that makes it seem so great. Other considerations are put in the back-burner, especially with the young but when sex starts to cool down, they suddenly see each other in another light and sometimes, they find out they don't really like each other at all. 4. I agree. 5. People who are considered good by others but consider themselves bad want to die young.  6. Look at it like this, 99-100 is 1.0 97-98 is 1.25 96 is already 1.5 which makes you ineligible for a scholarship.  7. I don't understand the 7th one so if you'd care to explain. 8. That's why my diary is online and very few people know the url. 9. Don't really know. Doesn't happen to my barkada. Happens in the orgs, though. 10. True.  11. Why 10 comments?

      I'll make the changes tomorrow or some other day. Tinatamad ako ngayong month, eh, pero with all the compliments you've thrown my way, (as if maniniwala ako) I'll make an effort on your part. I'll do the *bleep*-ing with your cuss words but I don't really think they're all that bad and baka maapektohan ang quality na gawa mo. Ikaw rin.

      Ok, parang antagal akong nawala kahit na 5 araw lang naman akong hindi nakakapag-log-in. And so I reply... (I think I'll reply by days)  Hmmm... for someone who has an inferiority complex and who considers himself having a poor vocabulary, you've been using some very deep words the last few days. What else can I say? Write!!! Who cares if no one else understands the first draft. That's what editors are for.

      Things I learned from Roxanne's critically-acclaimed play, "Nasaan si Anna?":  1. Your kindness doesn't karmically return to you in the same amount. 2. Discontented lovers always go to their girlfriends' best friends. 3. Relationships without sex, no matter how young, are bound to fail. 4. The nicest people are usually insane. 5. Good people don't just die young--good people  want  to die young. 6. 96 is a low and abominable grade. 7. Faggots are actually accepted in the family.  Furthermore, fathers accept gay sons if a pretty young girl talks to them. 8. No matter how much you don't want people to see your private life, privacy is dead when you are dead.  Even if you have an embarrassing story (or a funny story), people cry over your diary. 9. In a typical barkada, the only real guy is probably the suitor of the most gorgeous of the pack.   10. Teachers love to gossip about their students.  Okay, so maybe reality is sarcastic, but the story revolves around realistic characters that deserve a body in a real world.  How your classmates couldn't memorize the lines, I don't know, but the lines are perfectly natural without losing the retoric value of theatre.  For this play, I'll give you a candy  and balloon.

      I talk and I talk.  This is great.  I really feel like a journalist.  I am unopposed on paper (at least not aloud).  Why am I the only one posting at this place?  Where's the fun when there's no argument?

      Kick me!  That's what a candy advertisement on a comic book says.  The Post It is conveniently placed on the tongue.  That's how I feel.  Kick me.  In the tongue.  I don't know why.  I just feel like getting my little lengua the heck.  It's something ridiculous and maybe painful.  But I really like getting my mouth bleeding bad.  Anyway, I was only being sadomasochistic.  I'm really happy today; sorta'.  I am getting good *bleep* performance at school.  Um, okay, not that good.  I'm going to have my first midterm tomorrow (Saturday) on PE 4.  It's Badminton.  I also have a delayed project for that subject.  I don't know if it will still be accepted.  Then, there are two other computer-related projects.  One about Computer Generations and the other about Modern hardware and software.  Plus bio of Bill *bleep*ing Gates.  Who wants to know that guy's history?  Anyway, I need em both on Monday.  And I haven't found anything useful.  Dear beautiful and lovely Rox, I really, really implore you to change the earlier lines on my work from "fourth grade" to second grade.  And I think I learned to say *bleep* than say (*bleep*) so may I suggest you change my cuss words to that *bleep* thing.  It's far more...moral.  And also, you can bother to place my name to the Anonymous thingamajig.  I don't care.  It's either I'm ready to face criticism, and I would rather tell the truth.  This is me.  Know me.  Please judge me for drying out loud.  Tell the world who I am!!!  Or maybe I'm totally losing it and I'm ready to face the gun barrels of the fathers of the girls I mentioned.  Bring it on.  I didn't say anything immoral.  I have nothing to be embarrassed about.    And, boys, when I say "fantasy" I'm not talking about the ones where you get your jollies, okay?  It's literal.  Like unicorns and faeries fantasies?  I'm the kinda guy who thinks like a child but processes like a senile and ridiculously old sage.    Ha, there.  I've said every living trash in my nervous system.  I guess I can probably reboot now.  -------------------

      This new editting area is colorful.  Funky.  Anyway, as I am in here na, I'll tell you about my plan.  The plan to dominate all secret societies that exist around the world.  I have already taken over the Freemasons, the Skulls and I have converted the former Illuminati to a multinational corporation that produces the Meteor Garden flick.  So, you see, I don't hate F4.  I earn money from them.  Nuff boutta BS.  The truth is, college is so sick, I love to hate it (which is all pure irony considering I don't really hate it.  Uh, never mind).  Anyway, I'm going to have a helluva week next week, all midterms.  Sick-o.  Plus, I'm suffering from inferiority complex, not to mention awe (there I mentioned it) after reading Jessica Zafra's "Twisted 1".  You know, that fat journalist in TODAY's backside?  So, I read it, and wonder, I could do what she writes, except that I have poor vocabulary.  She's so powerful with all her words!!!  I can't read a page that doesn't make me check Mr. Webster from time to time!  And even if I tire taking up that hard lexicon, I can't stop reading!!!!!  Oh my Gollllllly!!!!  So awesome!  I need to do something like that.  You know, through my website.  And yes, I am planning to put up the website that's gathering mold at angelfire.   OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOLLLLLLLLAAAAAAHH!

Well if it does... what the heck does this mean??! I CAN POST SMILIES AGAIN!!!  Unfortunately, our forums were reset (actually, the whole site broke down because of the server's maintenance, the files were accidentally corrupted). All disappeared and i'm back to square one. My smilies were gone and i have to re-upload it...  Well, it's nice to be back OnLine. Darn, we have a new number... again?!!!

      I downloaded the java script. It's very long. Had to edit with wordpad but I'll use it somewhere, I think.   As for my liking you, I think I liked you because you were different. It's just basically nothing more than that. Actually, I've gotten over you way before you've gone over the more than mad side. I think. Who knows... I don't know. It just wasn't there no more one day.  I talk about myself a lot. Does that make me egotistical too? Never mind! Don't answer that!

It's so fun it's stupid already.  Anyway, what I mean't was, why him?  What's so special about him?  And I hope you're not getting violent over having that person.  So, you liked me.  Big deal.  Everyone likes me until they actually try getting along and that's when most people find me a freak.  Or vice versa.  I guess these people can tolerate my madness.  But, like you said everyone is a little mad.  How Lewis Caroll of you!  Yeah, well anyone has the right to be gay, or empathic, or delirious, or book wormy.  I then have the right to be delusional on believing that the world isn't what it seems and work around that in life.  Come on people, some believe in Santa Clause eh?    Well, I'm not actually fictitiously delusional, I'm classifiable as philosophically paranoid.  Is there even such a term?  I don't care, I'll call myself that and that's it.  You see, I am paranoid about all posibilities: Secret Societies, Advanced Genetic programs, the Bible being true, and of course, The Matrix.  God knows, if there is such a being, whatever truths hide behind mortal perception, what actually is and if it is adverse or not.  We are all slaves of our own senses.  We all know only what we can receive as stimuli and yet believe anything we want.  "What you don't know won't hurt you" is the stupidest thing I've ever heard but it is my constant underlying phobia.  What if knowing the "truth" will only bring despair?    I love it when I talk about myself.  But what can I do?  It's the only valid thing I know: me.     urlLink http://www.phmguild.com/DROWLANG.htm  is the elf language translator.  Am I egotistical?

Not saying that I don't think you're attractive because you probably are but I view you with hazy glasses that I just can't seem to clear up. You're the man in the moon in my life who's views of the world are foreign to mine and yet, I can get along with. I think.      Wala na rin nga akong load.He he he...    Ang sinasabi kong bagong crush ay si Kevin Hugo. I know that it's a wierd name but I've checked it out in his ID at iyon talaga pangalan niya.      Crushes go past like ships in the sea. Friends stay forever, specially in our hearts...

      Personal blog lang para updated ung mga tao about sa webmaster ng SuspenDead, sapa la na ko magawa... habang naghahanap ako ng host, cguro i'll keep that blog updated. Pero after i got my host again, i'll be deleting my blog at sa website na ulit ako magpopost ng news (hindi personal news).  Jere, naman toh. Nde lang ako nag-brinkster ayaw mo na ren? Ayaw ko lang kc hindi sha FTP-upload. Which means, it doesn't use FTP to upload your files. Mabagal pag HTML/Webpage ang file uploader. Ayoko ng ganun, kakatamad. Para san pa ung FTP program ko? Dami ko lang hindi matutupad na pangarap sa Brinkster...   Pero dahil sabi mo, sige. BUKAS NA BUKAS DIN, gagawa ako ng *.html version ng "SuspenDead - The Website" na naka-based sa PHP. Ang forums e sa "http://www.invisionfree.com/forums/suspendead" na lang mareredirect. Mawawala sa website ang Hit Counter, Quotations, "Excecution Time" Script, lahat ng naka-base sa PHP na pinaghirapan ko karnehin sa iba't ibang scripts na na-download ko... pati na rin yung pagkaganda-gandang "Shoutbox" at ang original kong Polls na hindi ko maintindihan kung bakit wala gaanong bumoboto. ^^,  But i will decide kung gagamitin kong layout is ung LUMANG VERSION o talagang uulitin ko ang VERSION 2.0 BETA mula sa umpisa para maging HTML compatible. O ayan, mag-Brinkster ka na.   *Message Intercepted due to Foul language.

Sa tingin ko, nakasama ang kaka-yell ko sa bleachers this week. Intrams kasi. Andaya kasi ng ibang teams eh.  I'll post your work pero baka later this week na dahil may ginagawa akong bagong site about Sailormoon. Pero kung online pa rin ako mamaya at kagatin na naman ng busy bug, baka mamaya. Malay ko. Baka kasi mag-off na naman bigla itong comp ko, eh.  Rai,  Ba't ka gawa blog rin? Just askin'.

Kung gaano kawala ang urge mo mag internet, ganun kawala ang urge ko mag celpone times 44 googleplexes!  Ayaw ko na bumili ng load, ayoko na magtext.  Ayoko na lahat ng tungkol sa celpone!  Lumalabas na pagka-infuriate ko sa trend gadgets such as that.  At compensated naman dahil madalas ako online.  Pero tamad pa rin ako gumawa ng webpage.  At dahil hindi ka pala brinkster, Mark, duda na ko magbrinkster din.  Thanks to you.  Mamya magcollapse yan, dale ako.  Ayoko naman gumawa pa ng mirror.  Siguro geocities/angelfire na lang.  At least magkapareho yung mirror.  Tapos, hahanap na lang ako ng Poll services at Guest Book services.    Ayoko na makontakt sa celpone.  Ok, maybe I do.  Pero tamad talaga ko bumili ng load.  Kawawa naman mga nagtetext sa kin.  Pwe!  Ayoko na talaga mag cel!!!!   Hinde, tamad lang talaga ako.  Sobra.  Over.    At dahil wala ako site,  magpapapost uli ako ng work.  Kagagawa ko lang tong syort istory  para sa Filipino 1.  Ni hindi man lang ako tinulungan nung mga kamember ko.  But that's the way I like it!  Iemail ko na lang sayo, Rox, kung buhay ka pa.  Speaking of death, kumusta goiter mo?  A, oo, encoded na the way I want it to look.  Kung me pic, isesend ko na along.  Kaso, bwiset kasi ginawa ko parang stereotype ng superman at x-men.  At nung binasa ko sa harap, maganda daw.  LOKO!  Hindi ninyo naman ata naiintindihan e!  Me pagka freak yung sanggol, hindi sa itsura.  Freak as in MUTANT!!!  Asus, hindi yata nila nagets na pag hinawakan ka ng sanggol, para kang pinapatay e.  Ewan.  Ambot sa imo.  Hindi na ko   nag-iisa sa pagiging  Virgin!!!

Oh well... at least ganyan siguro talaga ang buhay.  Oo nga pala, I'm not sure but I may be going to Manila this sem break. The Commerce Dept. is going on a week-long tour of Northern Luzon and we'll be stopping in Manila for a day, I think. If ever I do go with it, I'll tell you about it.  We're all a little insane. If you're too sane for words, you know that you're the most insane.

      You must not revert to the "devolution" of man, instead be driven to your worst, for that's when the �bermensch shall be made.  Anyway, salamat sa bati.  Ayan, nakaposte na ko.    Pfrt.  Nababaliw lang ako.  Hindi ako masaya kasi gumastos nanaman ako.  Nag-iipon ako ng para pambili ng board game from uber-games.com (actually, directly, not online).  Ewan.  Basta, frustrated ako na masaya.  Bakit ba?  Hay naku.  Me assignment pa naman ako sa Sociology at English 2 at Inprola at CAS 1 at Filipino 2... sheeeeeeet.  HaRGH.

      Jer,   According to the post you've posted   sa guestbook ko, last April 8th 2003, kailangan kong humanda dahil sa gagawa ka ng bagong site. Ano ba? Kailan ba ako maghahanda? After a front page, what? Oo nga pala, dahil sa sem break kami rito at wala akong magawa sa buhay ko, I'm gonna make a lot of changes in  urlLink Midnght Delusions . I've already started with changing the pics in  urlLink About M3k    To the previous topic, no, it wasn't you, mon ami. It was the guy I told you I thought I was falling in love with. Remember him? The one we've used elven language to talk about? Or maybe I was simply the one who used the elven language. Regardless, it was him and now, I feel that I have done myself a great wrong. Whatever. It boggles my mind. I think. If my mind is still working, that is. I'll simply think about it, first.  On another point, I don't think love can be defined. It's way too broad a word. It's a noun and a verb and sometimes, a different part of speech altogether. I'd like to think that I do feel love in its different forms. I love immaterial and material things. I love to eat, for one. I love to dance. I love my collection of whatnots. I love people too. I love my mother and my father and a whole lot of others who have wormed themselves into my heart. Have I ever told you that I love you? Well, consider it said. Not that I love you in the romantic sense but I'd like to think that I care too much for you as a person to simply call it caring. Nevertheless, don't be alarmed by it as people seem wont to be, myself included. Just consider it caring in a deeper sense.   As for the phrase "falling in love." I don't think it's falling at all. To take the words of the character in "How to Deal," Why do people call it falling? Why don't they simply call it crashing because it is what it is. Considering the fact that I suck at exact quotes, that is not exactly what's been said but it is close or at least the meaning behind it is the same.   Yes, I foung the word, "yuck."  yuck   interjection  (also  yuk ) ( slang ) an expression of extreme dislike, disgust, etc. The Oxford Paperback Dictionary

      yuck?  At no time did I say I'm falling in love with you, nor did I tried saying something that might impress such notion.  So... upon further thinking, I don't think you were talking about me.  Maybe, this is the point where he's feeling, "I liked you, and I think I still like you, but the former feeling of 'I LIKE YOU' or similarly, 'I LOVE YOU' seemed to have diminished in time."  Maybe it is the feeling of "I thought I loved you, but I'm not sure I know exactly how to love you, nor how to treat you for that matter."  It could also mean "I know love.  It means I can spend time with you whenever I LIKE, and if I'm really lucky (not that all men are the same, because I cannot know for sure) I can get laid.  Now that is love."  I don't really understand.  LOVE is such a stupid word.  It is the word that can be defined but cannot be understood.  "Falling in love" is much worse, because someone actually used a word most of us barely understand.  Love is a question I encountered earlier in the Filipino class.  "What is love?" is a broad and personal question.  Not knowing love is embarrassing, but that is truth for me.  I admit, I don't know a thing about love.  Probably it is the fear to commit, but I have no experience, nor do I intend to experience such "love".    Maybe "yuch" is similar.  Did you find "yuck"?

      I've gone through all the dictionaries in the house and has even checked the ones in school and I wasn't able to find the definition of Yuch. For the life od me, I really don't understand it. It looks to me like it could have been a mispelled word or something but no. Anyway, can you answer this for me? How can a guy go from saying he thinks he's falling in love with me to suddenly ignoring me even when I'm already in front of his face?

      Sure.  I got sick.  Which made me avoid my three school days.  Great.  I had no assignments nor reports ready anyway.  Then, on Saturday, Bush came and went and I'm still in bed.  Now, I'm awake, a little energetic, fever's gone for a while, but maybe not for long.  My typing is too slow for me.  I find no energy, really, to do certain actions.  I forced myself out of bed, the only time I had forced myself, because probably I WAS TOO WEAK to resist myself.  Pitiful.  I would have enjoyed the bed if...   I could have written or read, but the headache made it all go blurry and stupid.  Go to hell, Satan!  I send you back to your friggin hell!  Stop sending me those plagues out of your contempt for humanity!  Waittaminute.  Wasn't it God who used to send plagues?        ...

      Hmmm... I don't know if I wanna buy some fetishes then. Considering how I don't particularly need anything else for ritualistic practice other than a candle and some pretty everyday oils and stuff and my hormones are already hyper as they are, I don't need them.

      Fetish: either I can define it as an object for ritualistic practices, or it could be another sexual instrument that Filipinos love to buy and sell.  Either way, it has the same ritualistic purpose, except sexual fetishes are usually limited to, well, sex rituals.  Anyway, it isn't the type of fetish that anyone probably uses to harbor real cash, because that would be so powerful that it may be more important than any other anting-antings found in Banahaw or whereever.  It usually has a greenish color, signifying nature, moss, or rot which adds to its exotic look.  These green things ARE NOT used for sex practices and may not be used for it in anyway for it would be... detrimental.  Anyway, DO NOT buy sexual fetishes found in urban areas.  A person who requires mystical assistance to get his thing up would probably need to try Obando or somewhere in a rural area.  As for rural fetishes not used for sex rituals, you may find those at these places: Siquijor, Banahaw, Quiapo, Cebu, an other notorius places.  You may also find some in Quezon city but unfortunately, you won't find anything useful because the spirits found inside these materials are already killed by air pollution -- I can't be sure if those sold in Quiapo are any better.  Anyway, for better understanding of these fetishes, you may subscribe to your local Shaman and you may also participate in fora concerning anything that can be utilized magically and can miraculously cure mortality as if it is better than God.      After all these shenanigans, there is no requirement for these.  All I need to say is, whatever fetish is to you is my definition of fetish, for I have no reason to believe in magic anyway.

      Question:  Didn't I told you NOT to text me anymore?  Have I failed to notify you that my celfone is incapacitated?  Well, maybe that's not completely true, because I received a message from you.  Still, please don't waste YOUR time texting anymore because I'm not reading anything on that cursed contraption again.  It's a load of wasted integrated circuits.    If you ask if I'm doing that coniotic "Friendster" social hooligan, of course I'd say no.  But the painful truth is, I do.

      You sleep with a dog or something?  What scars?  Is that like a gruesome way to say "pimple"?  Anyway, I have lost interest in making a site (all honesty) and I have a crude, quaint, but relatively healthier substitute.  I write newsletters.  It started as a project in school, but then I am advancing it for real.  You may receive the November copy soon.  Gimme your address.  If you already have given me your address in full and without acronym, ignore this message.    I hope when you receive the newsletter type anthology, youll be delighted to write for it.  It is just so bootleg and rogue that writing a newsletter reminds me of La Solidaridad.  I wish to be a young, modern propagandist.  But, unlike  welgistas  who just rant without intelligence and are usually driven by mob crowding, I am probably going to be a lone revolutionary for things people don't really care about.

      Ah, well.  We define such a word differently too.  Maybe it is just a way to define something we don't understand, like "psychic", "ghosts", "soul", and others.  Maybe it is meant to be open-ended because we have no real definition.  People can use it carnally, romantically, or platonically.  That's just the worst word in the dictionary.  But if we remove it for its ambiguous definition, we must remove a lot of other words as well.  What to do?  Define it first before using.  But that quite suck.  "Hi, love for me is (please enter personal definition here).  Now, I want to tell you that I love you."    Then, it all returns to that stupid guy there.

      It's too hard to define. Maybe people should delete it from the vocabulary altogether. But the thing is, every culture has a word for it. How come a word that is universally understood is so hard to define?

Anyway, dance for all I care, I do not dance.  I'll just step on other people and kill their nails.  Well, I'll be doing the society a favor and not dance anymore.  I'm the Appolyon of dance.

I've checked out most of the site and they have a Ladies' Night on Wednesdays so I guess it's not a gay bar after all.  I say ano and it's bad. It's bad. It's embarrassing in front of an audience.

Okay, I'm not saying real things.  But, hey I'm no social person.  I've heard people bar hopping.  It's just a nutty game of search and destroy.  You search for a bar, then you unleash your thousands of pesoses, then either you get drunk, get laid, gain a drunken enemy, get a drunken friend-turned-enemy, make fun of people while drunk and maybe get killed, burn inside the bar.... the destructions are limitless!!!!  It's an exciting experience.  Hehehehe...  I say "Hehehehe" when I can't think of anything to say.

      Probably not. Don't go postal about it. There's something so great about being single.  Freedom!!!  Just think of always telling someone where you're going or find yourself in a position of guilt and not knowing why.  Anyway, I just joined a new group in yahoo called  urlLink Goto Bed . It's not a really good group but I'm thinking if I ever wanna go barhopping, I'd at least have one destination in mind. Lookit thru. It's so like a website rather than a group. Just thought you might wanna do some editing in the group if you see how they made it.

      Wow.  Like  Wow .  Like a relationship with a married man?  Wow.  Can't say a goddamn thing about that.  Yup.  I think you underestimated yourself thinking that you are overly cautious.  You are, but that's a good thing.  Well, can't say the same here.  Still single, still a virgin, still bothered with mental difficulties.  Still mad inside and silent outside.  And I can go for married people, although that would make me a thief and maybe I'll get killed in the process.  Maybe you should be silent on this one.  And  don't get a new boyfriend just because you want to forget that experience.  You might get into other troubles.

      I don't think staying alive is a purpose, per se. A purpose is an end result, right? And staying alive is already something they do at the present without having done anything. As for fate or simply serendipity, I have not lived long enough to judge.

      Well, that's their solution, I think.  Since life has no inherent purpose, that is THEIR purpose.  They achieve things, so what?  Isn't staying alive an achievement too?  And, besides, what are goals but desires we set to achieve.  Ourselves!  Is it anything of a major purpose to affect the universe or something?  Do we have a purpose, say feed those entities outside our world, or become an impending army for a greater faction?  Not that we know of.

      Wow, thank you for believing I  have  any purpose at all.  You know, I don't think life is purposeful, if it has any purpose at all.  We have these reasons for living, for keeping ourselves alive, but then, I don't really blah, blah,blah,blah,blah...  I know you don't want to hear all that  "Philosophical Bullcrap"  (as one of our friends in Soul Sanctum puts it).  Anyway, the point is, what if life has no purpose other than pure existence.  You know, like the appendix.  Hey, great news for highschool students!!! FEU - FERN College, located at Sampaguita Avenue, Mapayapa Village, Quezon city will soon become the first wireless college in the Philippines!!!  I think.  Or maybe in Quezon city?  Whatever.  The point is, just slap that PCMCIA thing that works like a radio and connects to the network hub of the school, and you get free net!!!   What is that thing called again?  I only remembered it being named as "radio".  stupid short term memory.  Anyway, stuff will be modernized there so fast, you might see the school of tomorrow standing on that lot before you can say "Charles Babbage!".   Hehe.  So much for plugging.

I'm getting confused with all the links pero it's good. I'm in deep envy pero I'm sunk so deep in school and laziness kaya I'll just stay the same old me and same old pages. Cute rin naman. Bahala na!   Oo nga pala, na-try mo na ba ang  urlLink Dairyland ? Well, I know. It's kinda cutesy pero I think I'll try it. Not for my site. I'll go cheap and make websites and give them to my friends. Personal and yet, not at all useless, right?   Ano nga ba talaga ang kalokohan sa friendster?

        The Game of Twenty Questions!    Let's start with an easy one, but, to remove all that first question you WILL ask anyway, here's the first clue:  It is a Vegetable.  Please write down the question number you are asking.

      Okay, enough about America and Mother Philippines.    Rules for twenty questions:           * Rule #1: Questioner may only ask questions that can be answered with a yes or a no.                      * Rule #2: Answerer may only respond with a yes or a no, whichever will be more helpful to A.  Rule #2 above is a good one -- the official one, but it's impossible to follow all the time.  Here are two exceptional acceptable answers that A (and Q) should keep in mind:      --"I DON'T KNOW."  Sometimes A simply will not know the answer, even though if he knew it he could answer yes or no.   In such cases A may respond with "I don't know."  As an example, consider that A has chosen the Rock of Gibraltar as the target and Q asks, "Is it closer to London than is Svalbard?"  If A doesn't know then he should not merely guess, because Q might know, and if A guesses wrong he will certainly mislead Q, which is a more serious violation of Rule #2.  So, A should say he doesn't know and let Q take it from there.      --"I CAN'T ANSWER."  Sometimes A will properly determine that he's unable to answer a particular question with a definitive yes or a no, even though he is not ignorant of any facts as in the example above.  In such cases he may respond with the generic phrase "I can't answer."  An example will clarify the intent of this guideline:  If the target is a golf ball and the question is "Is it bigger than a golf ball?" then A will almost certainly mislead Q whether he answers yes or he answers no, which is a more serious violation of Rule #2.  Therefore he may simply state that he can't answer.  It's then up to Q to figure out what that means.  (Also note that if A had been a real stickler he may have legitimately answered No to that question, because a golf ball is not, strictly speaking, I suppose, bigger than a golf ball, the implication being that Q should have asked, "Is it bigger than or equal to the size of a golf ball?")  At first it might seem that any question that leads to either of these answers must be worthless, but the opposite might be true.  Whenever A says he doesn't know or can't answer, Q should examine the exact way he phrased the question to determine whether a subtle change in that phrasing will elicit a Yes or No response, which might reveal a lot about the target.   Traditionally, Q's first question (the only one Q may ask that does not allow for a Yes or No answer) is always the same: "Is it animal, vegetable or mineral?"  Indeed, in certain parts of the world this game is known as "Animal, Vegetable, Mineral."  The two important points above are that      * all legitimate targets will fall into one of these three categories or a combination thereof, and     * A must choose a legitimate target.  One kind of illegitimate target is an object whose very existence is in question, such as Martians or the Loch Ness monster, because A will be forced to answer Q's yes-or-no questions based on mere belief rather than factual knowledge that can certainly be shared.  Another example of an illegitimate target is something that has no physical existence such as patriotism or haste.  It's sometimes difficult for A to decide whether to respond with "animal," "vegetable," or "mineral," so here are some examples and other thoughts that might provide some help to both A and Q.  To begin with, anything that's never been alive is mineral, and everything else must therefore be either animal or vegetable (unless you count microscopic entities such as bacteria and viruses, which you should).  Here are three examples:      * If you've chosen as your target the clock inside London's Big Ben, you should answer, "Mineral," because the clock parts are made of steel and brass and copper and so on, which are minerals.     * If you've chosen as your target the wool sweater you're wearing, you should say, "Animal," because it's made of wool, which comes from sheep, which am animals.     * And if you've chosen the T-shirt that your date is wearing, you should say, "Vegetable," because it's made of cotton, which is a plant.  TARGETS MADE OF PLASTIC.  Targets made of plastic (floppy disks and trash bags) and other such petroleum-based products (nylon and gasoline) are impossible to classify as animal or vegetable because it is still uncertain in the scientific community whether petroleum comes from dead animals or dead plants (although the most recent evidence I know of, circa 1990, suggests it's both).   Therefore, by arbitrary convention, if your target is made from petroleum products you should say, "Vegetable," and as long as Q is aware of this convention, it is then his responsibility to think of asking, "Is it made of plastic?" or some such question.  For that matter, even if Q doesn't know this convention, it's still up to him to pursue the "plastic" question.  TARGETS MADE OF MORE THAN ONE SUBSTANCE.  Often A will choose a target that's made of, say, both vegetable and mineral -- for example, a pencil, which is made of wood and an eraser and paint (vegetables) as well as graphite and a metal ferrule (minerals).  In this case, A might say "Vegetable" because a pencil is more vegetable than mineral, although if he said, "I can't answer" that would be OK too.  As another example, if A's target is a floppy disk, then he should probably say "Vegetable," (plastic) despite the fact that a minuscule but fundamental portion of the total mass of the target is actually iron oxide (rust), a mineral.  In any case, A may declare only one of the three possible substances, so no matter what A declares it's up to Q, if he wants to, to determine more precisely what substance A's target is made of.  For the novice who didn't read all the paragraphs above, it's important to understand that when A says, say, "Vegetable," that doesn't necessarily mean that the target is a vegetable such as a carrot.  Similarly, the answer "Animal" doesn't necessarily mean that the target is an animal such as a platypus.  And, of course, the answer "Mineral" doesn't necessarily mean that the target is a lump of iron.  The question "Animal, vegetable or mineral?," as seasoned 20 Questions players know, asks about the primary substance of which the target is made, and every legitimate target, i.e., every possible object or substance in the universe, will be made entirely of animal, vegetable or mineral or any of the four combinations thereof.

      Heheheh, you're right about the morality issues concerning  the way America is livin'. But what I was trying to say is that America is just good as what it has in its extrinsicity. They may look financially stable & such (a decent way of living) --- but 3/4ths of America is morally rotting. THey have become so complacent that they have forgotten how important it is to be what makes us different from humans & animals. Respect, Love, Courtesy, & other basic values have been decimated to an "I don't care about you--- you mind your own business" attitude. From my workplace alone, there is no sense of humanity than just thinking of how to make money. Not that I was looking for tsismis, but there was something lacking. Working robots. I say, working robots. That is why  if I had the right amount of time, knowledge & capital, I will not hesitate to move back to our country and start a small business there. It's not about cultural bias but how we most Filipinos, even though we're always suffering from hardships and all kinds of turmoil, know that there is more to life than just material things (Not to say that Americans are--- but most of them do). That's what most of us battle-scarred Filipinos make a rare breed of moral & stable integrity.

      Monetary Value? Akala ko mas mahal diyan ang mga bilihin? Decent way of living? Paano naman yung morality issues and such? Cleaner environment? Yeah, but at the expense of others. Saner Gov't and Politics? Si Bush!?! Babes? Bakit, wala ba ritong mga sanggol?  *sigh* I'm really in an insane mood tonight. Ang hirap mag-isip ng good thoughts.  Anyway, Debb, I salute your love for the Philippines kahit na I cannot understand it myself. I'm not saying that I love US or any other country more pero with all this, love your country and such, I don't really know where to place myself. I'm thinking kasi that with all that, we're more or less promoting bias because we're putting ourselves above others. We're saying we're better or stonger or more this or more that. So we're belittling other cultures and thinking we're above them na. We're all simply human, aren't we? Just a thought. It probably has nothing to do with what you mean.  Puwedeng 200 question lang? Pero mas madali kung 20 questions lang. Honga pala, who will start it? Si Jer na lang kasi siya naman nag-suggest, eh!

      Ang hirap makapasok online kapag free ang internet. Kainis! It's already 3 am. So anyway, Hollywood has it's good side and it's bad side. It's all a matter of just how far you'd go for what you want, I think. I'd say it has more of a sordid side than anything else but there's still the people who try to hang on to their morality and such. Anyway, I wouldn't believe everything I read or see. They're all hazes and cut-ups and people all seem to look alike. I'll believe it when it's right in front of my eyes and even then, I'll doubt it. Why? Because truth is not everything as we perceive it. Truth is relative and a matter of opinion. It all depends on you.

      Hiya! Me? Liking this piece of land called America? Except maybe for the monetary value, a little decent way of living, cleaner environment, saner gov't & politics, some babes here & there, and most of my immediate families are here, but other than that, what's there to like America? I might really sound stupidly sarcastic but whatever happens & whatever it is, my heart & soul belongs to Mother Philippines (& ofcourse Whoever it is "up" there). Now only if the CIA-NBI won't intercept this message & suspect me as a fanatic madman (which I don't know if I am  *gulp).   About the 20,000 question game --- I'm always game as long as I'm cyber(ly) kickin'.   :)

      Anyone up for some games of twenty questions?   Twenty questions is a two-person or multi-person guessing game. It is also known as Animal, vegetable or mineral?  One person thinks of an object, and says whether it is "animal" (including humans), vegetable, or mineral. The guesser or guessers must determine what this object is, by sequentially asking 20 yes-or-no questions about the object, which are answered either "yes" or "no". For example: "is it a person?", "is it someone I know?" ... If the guessers manages to work out what the object is after twenty questions, then they win. Otherwise, the person who thought of the object wins, and reveals what the object was.    Hehehehehe!

      Inspector Gadget... little Penny grows up and transforms into a whore...  God, if you saw what I saw...  I have a theory: Hollywood is a great, marvelous whorehouse, a pimpmobile, a Moulin Rouge.  Every woman and man is a prostitute and every child actor is a whore waiting for them to "come of age".  I hate America.  I can't believe Jed likes it there.  But then, Filipinos have their own whores.  I remember my dreams usually, but I don't get to record them.  I'm not reporting any dreams of mature or sexual content.  I do keep them in my computer.    You should read my notebook(s).  I'll post some of them here.

Oops! Sorry, commerce talk. There's just one other thing we never really did and we can't help but say 'what if?' Pero parte pa rin iyon ng buhay and if we did change that part of out life, we would be so much more different than we are now and would you really have wanted to change yourself?

      Of course it is your grandmothers "last" 79th bday.  When will she celbrate it again?  Whether it is an issue of love, I don't know.  Weird thing about the alchemy of thoughts: I concocted a dream that mixes all love tragedies I've seen in reality.  I am practically reliving one of the professors in FERN who got expelled out of the school for failure in quality.  But other students think of it as something else (this doesnt get out or Dacasin will shoot me right between the eyes).  I don't know why this should be hidden, taboo, or anything, but I guess people are just narrowminded, superstitious cowardly lots.  He had an issue with a student.    My dream is about the same thing.  I was such a teacher, and everywhere, this "taboo" of mine was becoming open, though in tabloid rumors and stuff.  I don't know, but I really sometimes hate being against the society, though I am already radical and stuff.   You can say I'm still afraid of them.  I would rather disappear than be thrown stones at.  But c'mon, is it really that bad?  The dream made me question, did the professor expelled really deserve receiving such?

      "I think Jed agrees with the great catch thing. I know you like me Jed, don't hide it." -----------------Ermmm, pwede ba friends lang muna tayo?    :P   You know what, Lemme' share you an experience that I had while I was in high school. For those who hate mushiness, I advice you to cease reading unless you like puking. Anyways,  I had the same predicament as Jeremiah about relationships before. I was the same teenager with the same "good" hormones as I am now, hehehe. I dunno if I was cautious or sumthin' but I just refused entertaining thoughts on relationships even if it is in the basket already.   I can't say that I was a homo (I'm not implying anything) because I had once a deep admiration for this girl who was fortunately my classmate. At that time, I didn't knew if she liked me or not. Then a cool morning on Valentines Day 99' arrived. It was in school in the middle of a class break, there I was sitting in a bench alone (what in tarnation was I doing there?), I took a glance near the school shop near the entrance when  I swear I see that girl getting prettier by the moment (at least that was 5 yrs. ago). She was buying sumthin' from the school shop. Then the bell rang, signalling the time to go back to class. Knowing that it was Valentine's Day, our class adviser, Ms. Torres arranged a "special" program in which a certain person will give sumthin' to another person he/she likes. For the program,  I managed to buy some scrappy flowers from outside d skul to give to my "girl" friends whom I had the same benefaction of receiving valentine appurtenances as well. Anyway, just as the class was already over, when there "she" came from out of the blue and greeted me a Happy Valentine's day, instantaneously giving me a heart shaped crimson red balloon. What that it made me feel something that I have never ever felt before. I can feel her sweet, caring aura enveloping around my unsteady body, with no malice intended. Now I can confirm that she really likes me after all. It's not love. It is almost there, but not yet. Anyways, I in turn thanked her very much for the trouble... Sheepishly she asked me if I was going home, and since I know how gentleman I am (at that time only lolz), I offered to go with her coz I was going in the same route as well ------ The events unfolding was an excellent concoction for a good relationship about to happen...  When all of that, I just gave up all. After that fateful day, I still did not talk to her. I tried not to look in her eyes. She knew that I was setting us apart. I didn't think that I was that picky. I was just afraid of being rejected in the long run. I was afraid of being hurt. I was afraid of the unknown future. I was cautious. In the end, I was afraid of something that never really happened, in which I didn't even try. Looking back, laughing at myself of the "things" that I had done, made me wanna' do the right choices if given a chance, and it's not just about love life for that matter, but for the most part of my life and what's remaining of it.  What I therefore think & conclude about us folks being cautious about relationships (for whatever reasons), though natural initially, should not interfere the course of any part of our life, especially our social & love life...... Oh, & pardon my blabbing. It's just my way of releasing tension from work & studies.  Ahhhhhh, now I can sleep well, dami kong nasulat... Tomorrow will be grandma's 79th b-day (and her last one as she says to me). Gotta sleep early for her. Eniweys, Catchall'l8er!     *yawn

I think Jed agrees with the great catch thing.  I know you like me Jed, don't hide it.  Do I feel cautious?  Yes.  Do I feel a relationship is necessary?  Less so.  Do I find myself thinking about wimmenz?  Yes.  Am I sleepless?  No.  Narcoleptic?  Yes.  Do I think I want a relationship, of any type?  No.  I don't.  Newton died a virgin.  I don't wanna die having an anarch childe outside my jurisdiction.  If I fail in relationships, married, casual or otherwise, I don't think I would die willingly.  Wait, wattamaysaying?  What I want to imply is whether any relationship, test/analysis I enter would be worth it even if I don't take it seriously (not saying laughing my heart out at her expense).  I mean if it would be worth if I don't pursue further and if anyone would morally accept it as such later.  Well?

      I think Jere is the cautious type. Among all of us, siya yung may pinakatakot magkarelasyon pero kapag nagkaroon man eh he'll probably make it for life or die trying. At least iyan ang pagkakakilala ko sa personality niya. It's all or nothing, I think.   Ang kaso, he's still human. Ano nga ba ang gusto mo, Jere, sa buhay mo? Or at least the part na 'love' life mo? You want a girlfriend pero hindi ka naman nanliligaw. You can't exactly say na walang may gusto sa iyo kasi you're basically a great catch naman, eh! I'm a girl, I know that. What's the main point?

      Me? Bisexual? Nah. Not my forte.   Now now, about your dilemma (Si Marianne Maligat ba yun?)------ idaan mo lang sa ligo yan, pare! Joke, joke. Pero pare, hayskul pa yun. nakaraan na yun. But I can't blame you. The question is --- Do you always see her on your mind as if it was just yesterday? Are there times that you seem sleepless thinkin' of somethin related to the opposite sex??? If the answer is a resounding yes, then you got to have GIRLFRIEND, a.s.a.p.!!! Defense mechanism natin yang mga lalake na nagsasabing kailangan na nating makihalubilo sa opposite sex. Not necessarily for lust or sex, but for the wonderful experience that we will miss lest we be a wood to chuck by a woodchuck... What I mean is the puppy love, true love, happiness, arguments, jealousy, opinions, blah blah that we will miss in our lifetime... I say, go get a girl you fancy. Date her. Analyze her (Not that kind, sicko). Check her background and her attitude in life. And if you like her, good. If she likes you as well, then you have made the first important base. And the rest is all up to you. Be good to her, but not damn too good that you are being a wussy and a puppy on leash. Have your own identity. Be damn funny, be a little cocky (not too much), be smart, be confident, be kalogz, do smell good and have clean nails, and the best of all, be human (a nice human that is). Now about them girls, don't take advantage or get taken advantaged by them . don't expect too much from them (especially from our generation, you know what I mean). Be prepared to love. Be prepared to get hurt. All of these, we have to start from something, you know...... Oh and do watch out for players (aka "playa's"). Get away from them as soon as you can see a hint and some proof of it. They'll just waste your time. You know them once you can feel and see skeletons in their closets...Now go get 'em!   Catchall'l8ter.

      You are.  My golly, you want me to believe that you are bisexual, aren't you?  Okay, that is acceptable, just don't *bump* on me.  Man, you of all people... Ewww.    Eniweys, I have a new dilemma.  I suppose we talk about me not knowing what love is, but then, I always think it be the only appropriate term EVERY SINGLE TIME I remember that girl I was obsessed with at high school BUT NEVER got the sh@t to even be friends.  Well, this anti-social thing is getting obsolete.  Not that I don't choose my "friends" anymore.  It is just not very useful, especially if you want to argue things or desire to know various forms of knowledge.  Hep.  That's enough vanity for the moment.  Marianne... I'm beginning to hate/love that name.  I had the notion that favor of female counterparts is about sexual desires.  I could be wrong.  Well, I may have g@dam# problems in making that f^!king webpage.  The hump of precision-crafted metals and plastic known as my PC is getting outta hand.  I can't access disks that I can access in this public computer, while I can't access here the disk which I use at home.  Friggin aye.  Help.  Ryan, I know that printer port network musta work.  Please?  I have a nice header and footer for my page, only I cannot upload it!!!

      Hey! You just vaguely insulted me by vaguely insinuating I'm vainly displaying my so-called art! I should sue!  Good luck on your priorities. Whatever happened to that subject we were talking about noon?  I've already watched Kill Bill Volume 1. I like the sword scenes. They aren't as gory as Kenshin's movies so I didn't puke or anything.   My sister probably knows more about violence and pornography than me. She lives in the wordly metro.  Soul Assembly? You just love to put souls in your titles, don'cha? Why when you don't accept souls to exist without any proof?  Don't consider drugs. Consider this, if it makes you better at what you do, you will doubt yourself and what you would have been capable without it. If it makes you worse, it makes you worse.  Ok.

      I can't say that I know myself better than other people does. I have only a one-sided view of myself. Anyway, I think that it's probably more commercialized nowadays but there were times past that there was actually something into it. Dream interpretation, I mean. Malay ko kay Bojac. Siya tanungin mo.

       Well, probably introspection. It's like asking people to judge you.   The above statement is ambiguous.  It should be noted that they  are separated in meaning.  The former is a reply to  how to interpret dreams .  The latter is to  getting your dreams interpreted through psychology sh*t and other people with templates .  I have plans for this new year:            To make a REAL website for Epoche, which is a personal site, like Rox's.  Yes, I'm full of shit, but this time, I will obligate myself. Otherwise, how could I vainly display my art?  Heheher.            To make more stories.  I had enough of autobiographies.              Save money for the rainy day.  No, actually for my new hobby (Vampire:the Eternal Struggle trading card game) which has gotten me hooked.  I would be attending a few tournaments (locally).  Hopefully.            Study Harder.  Lost my partial scholarship by .02 points on my current GWA.  I want to be scholarized to fund my vices.            Make poems and draw more.  Make a storybook version of "The Meadow of Lore" (Oh, you'll see what it is).  Even your sister could read it.  Well, that is, if Cinderella and Snow White were ever pornographic and violent.  But wait, your sister is already old enough to read so much violence.  I suggest watching "Kill Bill".  Haven't seen it, but the raves are powerful.              Write comic scripts for my brother to draw, and write more stories for the currently wishful thinking "Soul Assembly".  When I consider drugs, I think I can make a better story.              I will fulfill at least two of these this year.  Or you can kill me.  No really.  I'm not suicidal  but I do keep promises.  Not like some people out there (I'm not talking about anyone INSIDE this Blog).

       Rox said:   As for Dream Interpretation, how do you propose to find out what your dream really means?   And I reply:   Well, probably introspection.  It's like asking people to judge you.  C'mon, you would know yourself better (don't dare deny).  Or probably it has no innate meaning.  It actually means nothing as it is.  It is like an unconscious fantasy, is all.  However, it needs a foundation to come into being.  This foundation would be our experienced memories, and innate generic reactions.  Thus, a dream becomes meaningful because, by recollecting the source of such a dream, which is our unconscious or conscious memory, we get to know ourselves (which is better if we are unaccustomed to paying attention to ourselves).  Does that explain some or what?  Hey, I thought Bojac joined to talk here?  Well, where is he?!!!

      Errr... you never know where you're going to find money from. Anyway, I just thought of a website. I'll entitle it 'What is Love?' and I'll survey about a hundred or so people and let them answer the question as short or as long as they want and them let visitors comment on the main question or the answers or even the comments. What do you think? A moneymaker or moniker?  As for Dream Interpretation, how do you propose to find out what your dream really means?

      Awww... that's too bad.  Well, I've already detained "alone" and through the game group of Vampire the Eternal struggle (a card game, like Magic), I've become more inclined to the social.  Somewhat.  I don't know about you people, but the only way to feel less alone is get other nearby friends and abuse them.  Oh,  hahaha.  By the way, I just had a bad dream.  Fergit about those demons and monsters.  My dream is a conspiracy.  Well, I don't understand it exactly.  And two guy blow jobbing a man while others ignore them, as if it is more natural than water.  I don't understand it exactly, but they are on to me!!!

It's going to be a while bago na naman iyan mag-post rito. Nagpapayaman na kasi iyan as early as now while we normal people plan on asking him for a loan in the future.

Heheh, hirap nga makapag-concentrate sa pag-aaral while taking a 30 hr/wk part-time job (nag-quit na ako sa previous kong job), kaya nga paminsan-minsan hindi magkamayaw ang mga pinagsasabi ko sa mga e-mails-and-blogs (buti naman hindi pinagpapansin masyado nila). Anyway and at least, ang bait ng boss ko, ina-adjust ang sched to give way for some of my campus curriculum. Hey, after some time in the future, I'll take a vacation to the Phils. and iimbitahin ko kayong lahat and we'll rent a car and drive to the beach and cool places, oh di ba?! Oy, ano na balita Mando? Huli kong balita sayo ay yung masamang balita, Ehem, I don't wanna break the jinx. Nagtuturo pa rin ba si Ate Connie dyan sa Fatima? Teka lang, sa Fatima ka pa rin ba nag-aaral or nag transfer ka? And last but not the least, kumusta na luvlyf ni Mr. boy wonder namin?! lolz    To all: --- Teka bago ko makalimutan, e-mail nyo ko d2 sa bago kong e-mail kc puno na yung x_omacra@yahoo ko eh ---> reachdebb@yahoo.com   20 q & a game: -Hintayin kong humabol si Rox (and maybe si Mando, kung sasali cya) sa mga questions para hindi naman maging confusing ang mga clues.

Actually it depends on the people.  Honestly, your questions are not specific enough.  As for me, good and bad is relative.

      #4.) Is your target object a  two, three, or four  (EX: carrot >2 3 4 SYLLABLED  word and  NOT  a   five or MORE  syllabled word? By the way, I am not asking if its one syllabled.  Rox: --- I'm sorry I have not sent my submissions yet. I'm just checkin' & re-checking my notes at baka love poems & love letters ang maipadala ko.    Miah: --- NOW to a lighter note, (and this is not a question for the game ok?) What does she look like, that my ol' friend is getting killed just by her (heheh) looks?  Come on man, I don't know any Jeremiah who is a chicken. Redeem yourself and try to stay as calm as possible and learn from our past experience(s). I know it's easy for me to say, but remember when I was with 'ya guyz when  Elena appeared on that fateful day? Actually 'twas my birthday if you remember it clearly, something that can't be forgotten.  Ano ba hitsura niyang Marianne na yan? Is she maputi? Matangkad ba or what.  I now she is Chinita as what you've said in the "other" mail group, but so is my white dog in QC, remember him?   :)

      IF I say I dont know, or I cant tell, or stuff like that, you just lost one question.  But that should serve as a clue, also.    Rox's #2: Ask a YES or No Question.  Please.  And I haven't found her in the real world again... but people who just look UTTERLY like her is KILLING ME!!!  And also, I had seen her once (while Jed's still in the country), and I chickened out, finding her with someone I dont know.  A guy.

Di pa nga tapos. Anrami ko na palang tambak rito. Anyway, may mga tambak rin akong other peep's works kaya I'm going to work on that, too. Urm.... yun lang naman. So anyway, to the game.  1 or 2.)

      Hmmm... you still haven't found a connection or you simply don't know her e-mail address. There's more to connecting than friendster. Maybe you can try chikka or myspace.com. Or somewhere else other than the cyber realm? Like the real world?

      3.) does your target object have   TWO or MORE  words and not a  ONE  word?  (ex. ice cream, fried ice cream //or more words\\ , not just cream or ice)   --- Hehehe, I just want to make a clue profile so that it would be a lot easier for us to base our inference in it.

<post>

     
      Yes, mailing list as in yahoo groups (either DPS or Sanctum).  You know I could answer only Yes or No, so if you are asking length, you have to specify compared to what or is it this or that inches.  Okay, so you're asking if it is "configurative" long.  I can't answer because I don't know.  It's relatively complex than that.

      Jer, long as in picture an object and tell me if the length is long, meaning about 4 times or longer in proportion to its width. Gets?  We weren't yelling. According to internet etiquette that I've read. Yelling is when people print it ALL IN CAPITAL LETTERS. I think printing it in size 7 font is simply saying something out loud. At least that's what I mean.  How'd you do in the game?

      Mr. Jed, sure, I'd love to accept your submissions. It sure needs some new things in it and it would be great if you submit it and even better if you'd already tell me the html design you would prefer. I'm not picky. Whatever! Anyway, don't sweat the insaneness of your work. Why do you think I call the site Midnight Delusions?   What song lyric?

      Rox's #1:  Please specify "long".  I'm not going to ask why that's your first question.  Besides, if we are talking about the word's length, our concept of long maybe different. Jed's #2:  Each of you has a set of twenty questions, not just 20 for everything, right?  I can't read the rules.  Anyway, Yes to consonant. Non-game question: If I don't answer the question, I'm cheating and the game should end. *Yahtzi is not a yes or no question.  Nor does it have a number.  Yahtzee is a game with dice and players roll it in cups.  Stop yelling! .  Thank you.  Well, I am back.  I played Saturday and Monday vampire so I wasn't online.  I was hoping I could supply my online dope through school, because it is prepaid(in tuition).  Then again, it is always full.  I'm mostly online Wednesday, Thursday or Friday, hopefully.  If noone fills up the computer in school.

      Hey Ms. Roxanne, while I was waiting for our beleaguered game host to at least get the "game" started, I happened to stroll by your cute website. I would like to submit piece(s) of prose/poetry (or whatever you may call it) written in my dusty notebook from  years past. I figured I could transfer at the very least, productively, some of my insane thoughts & ideas before I could lose this notebook of mine.  Anyways--- I have no clue why I posted that song lyric in this blog when what I only did was cut & paste it on my html based lyrics collection. *tsk *tsk . Weird.

      The problem is, we're like so far away from Jeremiah that a simple phone call costs the world. If only his cellphone his working so at least a text message that would only cost me a peso or a text message sent from one of the various sms sites in the net would do to at least ask him,    "Where the hell are you!?! Are you even still alive and breathing in the normal human sense?"    Oh well... That's why we're doing this internet thing, right? To keep connected. *sigh*

You do realize that according to the rules, this being a vegetable doesn't necessarily mean it IS a vegetable?  It can be any plant or plant-product.

      PReSeNt! I'm still here, though not much had any endomorphines for the past weeks, so I just had to settle for my eyes to do most of the work in the computer. Now, I've been invited to be in friendster for almost a year now and I'd thought it was a dating service. Heck I see 'alot of Dilimanians roaming around as if it was a reunion web. That's why Mando hasn't been paying much attention to other groups, ehehehe. Eniweyz I'm in!    Pablo: - Do you wanna join the soulsanctum, yahoo groups? Its a soulgathering group of heathens, including me, headed by the Daemon himself. Topics or no topics, you'll mostly get to know most of their mood swingz just by the messages they make. So how 'bout it?   T'all: --- Friendster accounts pls! It's Invite or get invited! The more the merrier!

      Yeah, and I also eat chicken.  How's that for a bird?  Face or no face, it's not really a person with a name, so you could actually allay your disgusts and pity on it.  Yeah, well, okay, enough bird talk.  I do not eat that thing, that egg.    Pablo's #3: Oh, jesus, No.  NOT that it cannot be found here, but it isn't exactly "native".    Could Debb tally the Q&A again?  And can you please post at Soul Sanctum time and again?

      Well I just don't like the thought of eating somethings face. Even a little baby brid, still just doesn't sound quite right. And thats probably because I have never had it. Its not part of my culture, I guess I have been living is the U.S. for too long or something. Anyway, I don't mean to insult anyone that does eat it.   #3. Is it native to the Philippine region?

Everybody else can pass through their whole college life with 3.0 grades while we have to have a grade limit that's as high as Law students. Seesh! And we're the first batch with this. We started off about a hundred and fifty or so and now we're 30 or so and dropping out of the running fast with the damned terror teachers. Ack!

      Rox's stupid school:  That would make our school stupid as well.  Or just plain correct.  Hadn't they forced you to maintain grades, would you actually KNOW what you KNOW now?     Rox's egg:  Yes, balot is good.  When I was a kid and taste was still oblivious.  Now, I don't eat balot so I cannot confirm.  Why, Pabs?  You believe you see on TV that Filipinos eat that disgusting duck egg already in its maturation?  Well, other Pinoys do (as I said, I have no nationality, tee hee).  It is not disgusting.  Maybe it is "Exotic" for you.  I do eat Chicharon Bulaklak (Pig's Large Intestines), and it tastes cool.  I also eat Ice cream.  DIRTY ice cream (and they dubbed it that just because it is sold on the road, like in other countries.  Stupid nomer).

Yes, that's Philippine time (so you take the Manila time conversion, plus one hour.   Always add one hour when converting Philippine time!!!).    Pab's #2: No, not a vine.

      Pablo,  Yes, they have Starbucks o'er here. How do I know? Well, Starbucks is just a 3 stores away from the place I work. The thing is, there are alot of Flipz (slang for Filipinos like me), albeit asians as a whole, in our area. And coffee starts off our social morning. Now about Tullys, the only Tullys I know of is a merchandising/wholesale store just like Walmart.   Rox,  I know of a way of downloading mp3's without downloading those Ad-infested/virus infested  I- Mesh or Kazaa Mp3 players/dls. The problem is, it isn't a website, but a program. but still, both the program & mp3 are free (at least I think it is). You can even download animes such as Dragonball & Ranma if you're really diligent... Generally, a song has 3-6 megabytes to fill ur disk drive, so u better have decided if downloading songs is what u really want though. But I think you already have your own mp3 collection. I tell ya, I got addicted in downloading mp3's up to this day. Though anyway, wouldn't it be cool if you a bought a portable mp3 player to fit in ur pocket (u can transfer mp3's from comp. to the player). So much for piracy, hahahaha. They can't stop me, Mwahahahaha!!! Dammit', I'm so rowdy.   Miah,  When are you supposedly be online? I wanna talk to mi amigo sometime.

      Rox's #8: Nope.  I don't add x to my name.  I add zero...  it is much more... clazzic.   I am Jeremiah, but Daem0n or Faust is more common nowadays, although my nicknames range from "Iah" (pronounced, a'ya), to Jerry, to Jem, to Je, to Jere, to Ian, to Mai, and other.  I'm Filipino by blood, but I have no nationality, just because I don't carry any of their traditions.  Please, if you want to join 20 questions, don't hesitate.  You have 20 questions to ask yourself, so try to catch up.  They're at their eighth.

I'm actually a friend of a friend of a friend which makes my friend's friend my friend also, that's if they want me to be their friend, get it?   Thats it... STARBUCKS!!!

I'm sure he'll be more active.  Will someone check out  urlLink Freaky Dreams ? I was reading it in a newspaper somewhere but I don't have to time to check it out. I'm rushing.  Pablo,  Just wing it! We change topic from time to time. It depends on what's happening in our lives. Days of our Lives... Hah ha! They used to air that in a local channel and no one understood it. I wonder if anyone actually watched.  Jer, How can it be a scrabble game if it's not a scrabble game? It's not logical.  Jed,   Lay off the coffee or you'll find yourself older than you should be. Oh? That was you? I thought it was someone else. Why do you guys keep adding x to your usernames? Now I'm interchanging you and I'm not entirely sure who I'm talking to. Sorry for being a snob. I would have said hello and talked to you if I realized it was you. I thought it was Mark. You guys don't know him except he owns one of those 'swinging' yahoo groups that leaves me cold.

You know what I mean? Are u scared?   Shoot, I need to get more of those strong coffee in my bloodstream. ASAP. Its just one of those lanky days. *yawn    Rox,  I will refrain from replying a  "You didn't answer me when I was greeting u at messenger a few days ago. Have you received it? Just checkin' why u were screwed"  message.  heheh.

       [ Sat Feb 28, 03:14:20 AM | Roxanne San Buenaventura | edit ]  actually, Jere answered the question # 2 with another uncertain. Anyway, my question is, is it used for a specific purpose?  Rox's #7: My god, no.  Got the clue there?

      Rox's #6: I can't believe you just asked something really difficult.  If you speak of edible as in I take it up in my mouth, chew it, swallow it then digest, then it is NOT.  Debb's #6: Yes, plantae.  The site is against me because it isnt sending my word immediately when it suppose to.,

      Ummm... I guess that's my cue.  We've found ourselves a little lost on what to talk about when our lives are as boring as they are and we do find ourselves a little slow with our quips a time or two and so, we've started a 20-questions game. Faust is the one who's making us guess. It's supposed to be a vegetable. Plantae.  We've got a new member of this blog, Pablo, who I sometimes refer to as P-chan. He's from Washington.  We're trying to ascertain what is happening to Debb.  Faust now has his own personal blog, too. Meadow of Lore, right?  Nothing with me.

      Ok. I've gone back to the past posts and that was my 10th, Debb should be at his 9th and P-chan is going to be on his 8th. At least, if I'm correct.  I hate numbers because I have to work with it everyday. I'm not yet an accountant. I don't have the CPA board passing to be an accountant.   P-chan is like so busy with his trying to get a job. I barely even talk to him anymore.   Rai, weebee as they say in the chatrooms.  Debb, where the heck are you?

      Rox's Whatever that number is question: No, it ain't no pillow, kid.  For an accountant, you hate numbers?  That's just nuts. I thought you were the real accountant, at least in this group you are. If you think it is bad (gmail) I won't go there then. Iterative is like repetitive, right?  Whatever.   Where's Pablo.  I want him to talk in soul sanctum.  Hi Rai.  Missed you too.  Please post something useful na rin.  Hehe.

Because I hate numbers. 7. Yes. Isn't it obvious? 8. What is iterative? 9. Please what? 10. Bad bad bad bad bad but if you want space, there you have it! 11. Depends on you.  There.

      The questions I'm going to ask are:     Who is asking?  What is the recent question number of everyone playing?  Where is Jed when you need someone to account for the questions?  Can't the real accountant do the accounting of the questions?  Why am I passing the responsibility anyway?  Why don't you ask with your numbered questions anyway?  Have you visited my site?  www.geocities.com/daem0n_faust  Am I being ridiculously iterative?  Please?  Is it a good server (gmail)?  Should I get one?   Okay, I am happy now.

      Jer,  I think that the format for the template is fairly easy coz I've used a little like that format in my website. But anyway, if you're looking to add a little comment or something for all, look for this inside a tag. !-- This is an optional footer. If you want text here, place it inside these tags, and remove this comment. -- You can generally put anything inside it.

      Has anyone seen that Josie and the Pussycats movie? I know! It was really stupid a bit immature but it made me laugh and I liked the songs. I can totally relate to "You Don't See Me." P-chan, just a thought but listen to it sometime and tell me what you think of the song.   I'm getting a tad scared of the oncoming week. I'll be 20!!! Gadz! The dreaded time when I will be leaving the teenage years behind. Yes, it's totally senseless to worry about a change in years but this means that it's my last year in college and then I'll have to live on my own and cook for myself. I think that's the worst part. Having to cook for myself. Yes, I can cook but then, I'd have to actually be the one to budget just how much of my money will go to food and that's where my quandary is. I spend a lot of money on food!!!   And the jobs!!! I'd have to say yes to someone telling me what to do all the time. As much as I'd like to be my own boss, I don't really have any capital or profitable money-making ideas from my marketable skills other than my doubtful skills of shopping and being able to get a lot of people to do as I want them to with them thinking it's their idea.

      I like (VERY MUCH!) Pablo's sentiments about the  unimportant reflection  between good grades and good jobs.  But I would like to comment as violently as possible (which I usually do).   There is no  good job .   Whoa!  How about high-paying jobs?  Cool, adventurous jobs which allows someone to do EXACTLY what he wants at the office, or field?  How about those jobs which help me get a better social, emotional life?  Those jobs which  defines my life ?    I saw this add on Television with the actor-running-president Fernando Poe trying (as hard as he could) to convincingly deliver his platform if he wins precidency.  I was laughing inside, when he promised the viewers  trabahong dekalidad  (meaning, quality jobs).  I thought immediately, what the HECK is he saying?  There is no  quality job .  There can only be quality workers, which may be what we do not have.  Because quality workers (unless any of you would go against) provide quality work-places.  One cannot adopt a JOB to suit the professional -- quite the reverse.  I suppose you may think I'm not qualified to think of this, but I am about to face a reality where jobs are hard to take, and income from regular 8-hourers are a bitch.  My brother is about to resign from his designing job.  He's going to computer-design school, and learn graphic stuff, since one of his friends took a graphic arts job which provides a minimum monthly of 20,000 pesos.  Nice?  But, as one Jap-American guy I've read said, more money doesn't solve the problem.  It doesn't need a genius to figure out that after college, your work doesn't always pay you what you want.  But what is it that one wants?  One million a month for your measly services?  I don't think that is priced fairly.  Of course, there are many ways to get income, like sidelines and investments.  These are actually  the  sources of money, not your dayjob.  College wasn't about learning stuff for your future job, well, until the Industrial Age.  According to Adam Smith's "Wealth of Nations", it would be better if each workforce would focus on a task to take in the whole of the industry.  Probably the reason for for college-to-work knowledge is to learn the "specifics" and take a "role" in the company you will enter.  This much is true.  Today.  But unfortunately, there are a  LOT  that a student is missing out if his focus on "getting good grades" is to get a job.  In this way, he/she will fail.  There are a lot to face in the workplace that he hadn't accounted for in college. Getting good grades is a good thing, but not the  smart thing , at least not entirely.  Just because one gets high, doesn't mean he can fly!  The point is, college is so much more than the foundation of your work.  You are suppose to learn much more than that.  Take the technically irrelevant courses offered at school.  Please, you don't need that at work.  But that's because you're thinking about work.  Not what you can learn.  To me, college and work are two different realms, tangent to a few points only.    Harassing aside (if one feels harassed by so much words), I want to tell you guys that college HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH YOUR JOB!!!  In fact, you could start a business, with business knowledge without taking that course, and take a different college course altogether. What you get here is, knowledge on a CAREER from college, which you take as a JOB TO ENJOY BECAUSE IT IS YOUR VOCATIONAL EXPERTISE, and earn from a business, sideline, or stock investment(?), because that's the better source of revenue. Jobs, well, they just provide you something to do at day.  Otherwise, one could completely focus on his businesses and just get more and more money.  If money is the only thing in your heart's desire...    College?  Who said college life is peachy?  College is so much more than nerds.  College is an experience. However, one doesn't have to stick to college to learn.  There's alotta learn out there while you work and play along your hard streets.  Insanity it may seem to dismiss college as prologue to work, but it isn't.

      School, college, university, whatever you want to call it. It is just a giant waste of time and money. Because what are you going to get out of it? Some dead end job, life in a cage that's it. So it really doesn't matter if you go to school or not you will all end up the same. How rich is a dead man? It doesn't matter no matter what subject you major or what job you get, it is all the same in the end. But as for me I have a 4.0 (that's a good thing) and that by doing all the same things I did in high school; in which I graduated with a 1.5 (that's a bad thing). So whatever good grades or bad grades I am still the same. I don't no....What was the question again?

      Me and grades are somehow made for each other, except I'm either  torpe  or just bad with commitment.  I get very good grades (average of 3.25, where 4=100%) in FEU FERN, and didn't do so bad at TUP,  T he  U ltimate  P akshiet!  Well, somehow, I get myself in to too much slacking, after all the imminent "4"s that I will be receiving this trimester.  Okay, let's see... in Literature, I don't think I have more than four correct answers on the final exam, which is 50% of the final grade.  And if my professor wants it, she could get me suspended for working on my classmate's final project in a programming subject.  Shite.  What can you do, if you are a natural slacker but also a natural student?  What?  Well, of course, be both!  Look where it's going to bring me...  Hell, I suppose.  So anyway, as a student, the important thing is, you study well, and you study what you want.  That's the point of choosing what course you're going into, so you would be willing to get into the groove... baby.  C'mon, if one likes what he/she's learning, how could you not allow to put the challenge of examinations and projects in your way?  How, I say?  If you love something, and you feel the ease of it, why not get inside it more?  Wait... that sounded perverse.  My point is, education is cool, and despite the fact that it is not a competition of grades, taking (and perfecting) exams should not be a chore, but a simple challenge or game, on your favorite  sport .  Cheers!  If I sounded  mahangin  about my grades, I'm just too damn proud of it.  Because, it is kinda weird.  When you don't put much effort and you get good, it's like you have too much luck. And, the paranormal thing about it is that, where did that too much good luck came from?  And when does it get pawned from me?  *shivers*

      Ummm... I like the old one better. I'm glad you're all here. It's your turns to ask the question. Kukulitin ko na lang mamaya si P-chan. Anyway, what else would you guys like to discuss?  How do you view grades? Personally, I used to really want high marks. I had a lot of experiences during my freshman year in college wherein I've cried my eyes out for what I would consider a low mark. But as of now, I don't particularly care as long as I pass. It's a bit blase in terms of attitude but I'd like to think that I'm a better student now in spite of somewhat average grades than I was before. I can even interact with my classmates better. I know I'm not doing bad in school because I still top the exams and contests but in terms of grades, I am merely average. It all depends on what exactly is your point in going to college, right? I merely want to learn.

Ummm... in continuation, staying up late online so people would stop calling me so late on the landline... *mutter*darned stupid people*mutter* and getting me in trouble for talking to people I shouldn't talk to and studying div layering and iframes. Nakuha ko na rin how basic div layering works. I used it in the JPIA site. I don't get it. How come when it's a site for someone else, Making a layout takes so little time but when it's my personal site, I hit a brick wall. Maybe it's the money.   I'm supposed to go to a screening for image modeling for the brochure in our school tomorrow afternoon but I rather doubt I'll get it coz my eyebags are so dark by now. Ha ha!

      You wanna see real bias?  Check this out! http://www.chick.com/reading/tracts/0046/0046_01.asp contains "Christian" comics against Role-playing games such as Dungeons and Dragons (and like Slayer of Goodness, too!).    During the HOT years of Role-playing games (the 70s baby!) there were two significant deaths -- suicides -- that were both blamed to role-playing, specifically Dungeons & Dragons.  On August 1979, James Dallas Egbert III of Michigan State University left a kind of suicide note which contained misinterpreted messages that lead to investigators' beliefs of him telling them that D&D was what forces him to do so.  Big deal.  But what was more disturbing is the suicide of Irving "Bink" Pulling, June 1982.  His mother, Patricia, started BADD (Bothered About Dungeons and Dragons) and actively tried to incorporate D&D with crimes and suicides, even though courts dismissed her groups' claims.  This is REAL bias.  The most difficult part was, even though there are a great number of D&D players and makers that can attest that the game is, well, let's just call it "God-friendly" for laughs, the market of RPGs took a toll, and shops started pulling them out in reaction to wuss mothers who were so short sighted.  Okay, that was a biased info.  Anyway, that's what happened in America, and that's probably why the Philippines doesn't get that many players of D&D or RPGs for that matter.  At least, not those fantasy table-top types.  The best info here are from http://ptgptb.org/0004/hist4.html so check it out!

Our landline is (6354)4753054. I doubt you'll be able to reach me there, though. I'm either asleep, out, or doing something else, especially with school starting next week. *sigh* I don't wanna go to school yet! If you forget, search for Midnight Delusions in yahoo and you'll get to my site wherein you can find my profile with my number. Yes, it's stupid to do such a thing as post my number in my website as well as my address but I'm not rich and famous yet so I'm sure nothing bad will happen. At least I hope so. Hope springs eternal, right?  Pablo is busy with getting a new computer, printer/scanner/copier/whatever and his own laptop. Busy busy busy that guy is.

Too kind, in fact, that if someone tells him that "dirty money" is more practical in this time and age, he would accept investments on it!  Nah, Aside from his kindness, he carries these moral values that I really don't understand.  Actually I don't understand most moral values, especially traditional ones.    Although I am totally disturbed when people think I have no moral values, or my moral values are completely out of control.  Hell, what am I, Satan?  Spawn?  Wolverine?  I am not the fictitious anti-hero people think agnostics and athiests are.  Actually I want to be out of agnosticism and relive my Christian life.  However, when I pray more, the more I lose my faith.  And when I start to have faith in "The Guy", there's this daemon at the back of my mind taunting the back the skepticisms I bear.  Not that he's really a demon (afterall, daemon and demon are different), but then, would someone deny the inner desire (godlike or pleasure-wise) of someone that is wholly against "His" will a devil within?    Whatever.  I am out of context.  I may also need accountants.  I have a lot of accountacy friends and some of them are not actually dependable at some point.  I have doubts of their dependability in the work place......  And I hate people who unconditionally hate employment and love MLM, and vice-versa.  Wala lang.  IT is so like religion.  Excuse me.

      Hmmm... I've worked it all out. After I graduate, I'm going to review in QC for half a year. After I pass, hoping I pass, I'm going to take a one-year course as a computer technician. Trip ko rin naman magbutingting ng computer. I know it's not exactly the kind of course that will last a lifetime but I'll take it anyway. I'll add in a few programming courses. Afterwards, I'm going to get my masteral and doctorate degree. Maybe get a minor in psychology just so I can finally understand what exactly is behind what I do at times. Ayun!

      Depends on how better your life is to you.  Did you see some improvement?  Do you think that as you do better, you will practically be good afterwards, or is it just since your expectation was waaay below under?  You could always shift CS because the option will stick around there.  Whether you would, is a question only you can answer.  Just take in consideration the number of options you'll find when you stay or shift, not how much you gain or lose.

      Ha ha! *sarcasm evident* Not! Do you think it's ok if I shift to a CS course on my last year of BS-Accountancy when it looks as if I'm actually doing better than expected in this course?

      It's a school thing. They didn't even say anything about us getting paid. Isn't that, like, unfair! I need money! Ok, I'm being a tad materialistic but still... Picture the new uniform of UNC. White blouse. Light grey skirt. Blood red tie. Everytime we see the uniform, we cringe at the sight. Actually, it's a joke in the university that UNC doesn't have a uniform. It's got a multi-form. We have the old one with the grey tie. The new one with the red-checkered skirt and pants. *We look like we're wearing table cloths, in that one* And the new and improved red tie with grey pants or skirt. They keep changing the design to keep up with the times except they don't come close. Bleh!  Yep! I've been busy. I don't really understand it but there are days when I just find myself shoulder-deep in assignments. How unfair is it when two different teachers give you reports for the same day? The day when you have a long assignment for another class. While you have to study pages of Law and Tax. Ok, I'm complaining. Not good of me. Basta! I'm swamped. Feeling the need to study. Nagi-guilty kasi ako sa chika ng kaklase ko. May sinabi kasi ang Dean. Di ko na isulat rito at baka kung  may makabasa pa. Masobrang obvious na chismosa ako.

      Well, can I help it if I like serenading you people?  BTW, here's another, if you don't mind.  From HEART, These Dreams:  Spare a little candle Save some light for me figures up ahead Moving in the trees White skin in linen Perfume on my wrist And the full moon that hangs over these dreams in the mist Darkness on the edge Shadows where I stand I search for the time On a watch with no hands I want to see you clearly Come closer than this But all I remember Are the dreams in the mist These dreams go on when I close my eyes Every second of the night I live another life These dreams that sleep when it's cold outside Every moment I'm awake the further I'm away  Is it cloak 'n dagger Could it be spring or fall I walk without a cut Through a stained glass wall Weaker in my eyesight The candle in my grip And words that have no form Are falling from my lips  These dreams go on when I close my eyes Every second of the night I live another life These dreams that sleep when it's cold outside Every moment I'm awake the further I'm away  There's something out there I can't resist I need to hide away from the pain There's something out there I can't resist The sweetest song is silence That I've ever heard Funny how your feet In dreams never touch the earth In a wood full of princes Freedom is a kiss But the prince hides his face From dreams in the mist  These dreams go on when I close my eyes Every second of the night I live another life These dreams that sleep when it's cold outside Every moment I'm awake the further I'm away  These dreams go on when I close my eyes Every second of the night I live another life These dreams that sleep when it's cold outside Every moment I'm awake the further I'm away  Thank you, thank you!  I love you all.

       VOX  Sarah Mclachlan  In the desert of my dreams I saw you there And I'm walking towards the water steaming body cold and bare But your words cut loose the fire and you left my soul to bleed And the pain that's in your truth's decieving me, has got me scared  Oh Why?  Through your eyes the strains of battle like a brooding storm You're up and down these pristine velvet walls like focus never forms My walls are getting wider and my eyes are drawn astray I see you now a vague deception of a dying day  Oh Why?  I fall into the water and once more I turn to you And the crowds were standing, staring, faceless, cutting off my view to you They start to limply flail their bodies in a twisted mime And I'm lost inside this tangled web in which I've lain entwined You're gone and I'm lost inside this tangled web in which I've lain entwined  Oh Why?
