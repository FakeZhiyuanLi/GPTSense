      Well here's my random thought of the day.  Colette a few days ago asked me if on the first day of school last year I wore green pants and a purple velvety shirt. She really believes that. No. No. And no way I would wear that, even with the poor dress sense I had back then (and it was poor: I looked a lot like my sister. Sweatpants and sweaters with ugly sweatervests over the top...) But that just got me thinking about how much what I wear affects what people think of me. I have "homeschooler clothes" that people don't care for if I try to wear them.  Like the other day. I wore this smithsodian tshirt from when I was like eight... It has a space suit with all the names of the space suit parts written on it. No one liked that shirt, but I don't see what's so different from wearing a power rangers or strawberry shortcake shirt from when you were little. I just read books instead of watching TV.  I'm lucky I ended up with the group of friends I have (and yes, this is pertinatant) because people really judge you for what your wearing the first week or so. I could have ended up with some bad people... and then I most likely wouldn't have come back this year.  And if I hadn't come back this year, I would have given up and been homeschooled for the rest of my high school career. So really, what I wore (purple and green if you want to believe it) the first day of school affected my education for life.  I just got lucky.

      Well, school kind of cheered me up. I'm no longer depressed! YAY! I think I caught up with my homework..... or at least I hope I caught up. We'll see. And it's MEA!!!!!!!!!!! I'm so excited about it being a long weekend, you don't even know. I got up at 11:15 today.  I feel homeschooled again... ::sigh::  Speaking of that, I wrote my essay for Communications today. Mr Cleary gave me an extention on my essay, but I had to (wait for it) email it to him today. So yeah, that's what I did this morning/afternoon.  I wrote about going to school.... and it's really really long. But I thought I'd put it in my blog, so here ya go.   Most people can't remember their first day of school. It was just too long ago for their memory to stretch. But I vividly remember that day, perhaps because it was only last year. Before that day I'd been homeschooled and therefore it was a big change to start going to a public school. 	If you're not familiar with it, homeschooling is an educational philosophy where you learn at home. There is a large spectrum as far as where, when, and what you learn. Everyone's different.  	My particular homeschooling experience was fairly relaxed. I didn't just sit and learn all day everyday, studying textbooks and listening to lectures from my mom. That approach, while working for some people, just wasn't for me. I needed the freedom to choose what I learned. 	 So that's exactly what I did. I worked on projects and went to classes. I could wake up in the morning (or, if I'd stayed up late the night before, the afternoon) and decide what I wanted to do that day. Mostly, I wanted to read novels. One summer (in fifth grade I believe) I kept track of all the books I read. It totaled more than 100.  	If I got bored with reading, or, more likely, ran out of books, I'd look for something to do. One year I built a radio, another, a telephone. If I thought of something I wanted to learn, I would look it up in the encyclopedia, go online and do research, go to the library, etc. Once I knew all there was to know about the subject, I moved on. I spent months preparing for history day at the university libraries, translating books from Middle English to the commonly used English of today.  The point of all this it that I loved to take the initiative and LEARN, really figure stuff out for myself.  	So back to the story. I was cruising along, having fun, avoiding my math, and just generally living the high life. But it wasn't enough. Having friends who went to school, and having read a bunch of books about it, I decided it was worth a try. It would prepare me for college, and save me from having to write a transcript for myself (It would have turned out something like this "Ninth grade: I read lots of books and built a computer. Read the history article in the encyclopedia. Didn't do any math") Plus there would be lot of people to talk to there. 	I wasn't sure how it'd go, because I wasn't too good at making friends, having had little or no opportunity to do that for the last few years. We'd see if I could play the popularity game I'd heard so much about. It would also be interesting to see if my knowledge matched up with that of school kids.  	So I told my parents about this plan of mine. They were a little skeptical about it, but they were wiling to try. They'd always told me it was my decision. So we looked at high schools. I really wanted to go to my local high school, but they had one AP class (English), no honor's program, and no IB classes. My parents pushed me to look for a school that would fit me.  	The one I found was in Saint Louis Park, a half hour drive from my house. I showed up for freshman orientation, knowing no one but the sophomore who'd shown me around the previous spring. I went to my classes and watched everyone catch up with one another. I talked to a few people when it was required during classes, and sat with myself during lunch at what I now know are the upper-classmen tables. I was having a terrible time 	But I'd promised myself I'd stay for at least three months, so I had a ways to go. And it did get better. I found a group of girls to eat lunch with, and once that happened they introduced me to people everywhere. I got to know the people I sat near in classes, the honors kids in my gym class, and all the percussionists in band. I tried out for the winter one-act plays, and got in. Soon upperclassmen thespians were waving to me in the halls. My circle of friends kept growing, and by the end of the year I knew almost everyone in the school by face, and most of the freshman class by name. That is, I knew their name. A lot of people have yet to learn mine, but that's ok with me.  	I was thrown into honors classes, and got exempted from taking science because of a class I'd taken the previous year. That left an open hour, but I ended up taking two math classes (algebra and honors geometry) so it wasn't that great. 	For the first month I felt overwhelmed by everything. I didn't think I was ready for Spanish II, and geometry seemed like it would be impossible. But I stuck with it. By the end of my three months, I felt ok about all my classes, was getting an A in Spanish, and had a 100% in algebra. I ended up getting a B average the first semester, and pulled all my grades up to As by the end of the year.  	So, I decided that school was the thing for me. Sure, I missed my homeschooled friends, who'd never quite forgiven me for leaving them and most likely never will, but I kind of liked the structured approach to learning that school is so big on. It forced me to do something every day, like it or not.  Conversely, the thing I missed the most was choosing what I wanted to learn. In school, everyone does their homework because they want to get a good grade, not because it's something they want to do. No one is passionate about learning. As the months went past, I felt some of that old desire to KNOW things seeping out of me. It happened slowly, so I don't know exactly when I started doing my schoolwork because I had to, rather than because I wanted to learn it. It's still somewhat there, and it shows up enough that I get grief for being a nerd, but I don't care. I hope it never really leaves me.

      Well, here I am, back from Icaghowan 2003. I thought I'd get back and not want to go back to school because I'd had so much fun but that's not at all the case... quite the opposite actually. I had such a crap time there. No one talked to me and I felt unloved.  Even unrequited love didn't cheer me up. Usually it's so cool and fun like "ooh who was that who just hugged me?" but this year it was like "get me out of here, why does everyone hate me?" Plus I got no sleep. When I don't get sleep I end up "neutral" in Alex's words. I stop talking and sound depressed. But that brings me to my next subject. I've been soooo depressed for the last like month and a half. Since before school at least. I don't know why.... I never get depressed, but my life right now sucks. School is so hard this year and I have no free time. Plus I'm growing apart from my homeschooled buds who have always been there for me when my "school people" aren't. I love homeschoolers....  But I don't have time to talk to them so I kind of have to face the fact that school is what I have now. These are the people I have to deal with for the next three years. I don't know if can take that. Because, don't get me wrong, I love everyone at school, but it's so hard to do anything but take care of yourself. It feels like no one has time for other people. And since I've been sad I've been telling people that I'm not having a good day when they ask how I am. And no one seems to care. "Oh, that's too bad," is about the top response I get.  Even after I ended up going to counciling on thursday and skipping hours 4-7 no one seemed to notice. And I don't know if I can handle knowing that I'm exclusively in charge of cheering myself up.  And I can't even finish this blog because one, it's depressing, and two, I have AP Euro homework. Maybe I'll write more later.

      Hi y'all, I hope you're ready for some big fun, because you're about to enter the realm of my mind. Please keep all hands and feet inside the ride until it has come to a full and complete stop.  I know I am  copying  Alex and various other people by making this blog, but I got sick of the amount of room I had to write in in my profile. So here you are.

      Uuuugh. ::Amelia drags herself to a sitting position in front of the computer:: Wow yesterday was great. Burning guy fawkes, going to journalism and math (my two funniest classes. See my last blog for examples), and then the potluck, play and cast party.  So much stuff in one little day. But Mr. Cleary is leaving us!!! Nooooo! He's so cute and gay...  I'm so happy about the play! It went pretty darn well last night. Even if I did mess up and forget to sing... lol I'm like a three-year-old.  And the cast party was fun. I now know exactly what NOT to say to Spencer and Dan if I'm in  a car with them. "I actually don't mind being licked." Wow they slobbered all over my shoulders... icky.  And then the whole thing with trying to pants David... we'll get him yet.  Ooh Sasha's dog is so cute! It's this little miniture poodle and it'll jump through a hula hoop if you hold food on the other side. It's like a circus dog.  I got home at midnight (I had to leave early) and was sooo unbelievably tired I went almost straight to bed.  But first I took off all my makeup, managing to get cold cream in my eye in the process. Have you ever felt like you were going to die? Well smear some cold cream in your eye and you'll know what's like.  And then I woke up at seven today. Why? I don't know. My life sucks, I have to go do homework right now to get it all done. Crap.

      I love journalism... even if i did get a 73 on the test... but who cares about grades? I got tons of good quotes. And here you go.   "I once grew up on a farm."~Alex Byers  Talking about groups you should form, "People you haven't worked with yet before."~Keekley  (Colette makes waving hand motions in front of her mouth) "What am i?" "Corn harvester?"~Chinh  We were all sitting around remembering the good quotes we already had said, and laughing really hard... Ms. Keekley was giving us weird looks because Jessica was crying with laughter.  "And there's even someone over there in the corner crying"~Keekley  Then Colette starts waving around this plasic thing "and what are you doing over there? Hitting each other with rulers?"~Keekley  Someone was talking about idk what... Lions i think, and Jenny perks right up. "Lynes! That's my last name!"  "princesses AND small bald men?"~Chinh  "Afterschool hats"~Colette    And then math. Always good for laughs, especailly during "Transition time"   (Talking about cheating out of the back of the book in math) "Good thing there's a back [of the book] on the test"~Johnson "Really?!!!"~Solly  Becca has been obsessing over sending her kids to jew school so they'll be smart. We don't know how this is going to work. Will they let goys in? We asked Becca if she was going to be jewish. "They're not going to be.... Well they might be jewish. I don't know who I'm going to marry."  Glotter was being stupid, and singing this peanut butter and jelly song during math. He got upset because I wasn't singing the other part of the song. "Haven't you ever heard this song?" he asks "I've only heard one person singing it by themself." "Me?!" says glotter  Anyway, you sort of had to be there for all of these, but it was funny while it lasted. I put this all in my blog so one day when I get depressed I can read them all and remember. Hahahahahahahaha like I get depressed.   COME TO THE PLAY!

      Hi everyone! I'm hateful of AP Euro right now.... too much homework. But i did find a great book while i was researching. It's called "The man who could grow hair" and it's from the  60s i think. LOL it's a great book. Nothing to do with my topic but still.  My room is sort of like a pile of garbage. Well, it is a pile of garbage.  Oh well. Before halloween (the day before, to be precise) i went through all my clothes to find something cool to wear, so now anything interesting that i own is on the floor or the bed.

      after that refreshingly long quote that was friday, here's a refreshingly large peak into my (frustrated and highly angered) world.  i have been trying to convince my parents that i need mac OS X. my padre was convinced, but my mother was another matter.  so i got it for christmas. let me interrupt myself for a moment and express my adoration of christmas.  now, i am not christian, and therefore you wouldn't expect me to celebrate such an obviously christian holiday, if it weren't for the fact that unitarians have no winter holidays (or, for that matter, any holidays at all). we merely hang on to the coat-tails of seemingly innocent holidays, as it were.  myself, i am not a believer in god, which makes it hard for me to think of jesus as god's son, but i am happy for his birth, whoever he was, because it gives lots of people the opportunity to give me gifts. ah, free stuff.  anyway, i received the operating system i wanted, as well as some basic programs to get me started. "ah," you say. she must be happy now.  well, yes... and no.  i thought i'd back up all my documents and such on disk (meaning cd. imacs don't have floppy drives. and oh, but the world would be a better place if they did.). i placed a black cd into the disk drive and waited for it to show up on the desktop as it was supposed to. nothing. the imac spat my disk back out at me. i tried again, this time saying "come on, you can do it" to the computer as i did. same result.  christmas is the time for giving, and my father decided that he'd buy me an external cd drive, one that burns disks.  it arrived in the mail yesterday evening, and i unwrapped it as fast as i could. this is a very nice cd drive.... designed by porsche, it says on the box. i followed the instructions in the (tastefully designed) owners manual, and got the software mostly installed.  i say mostly, because to finish the job your computer must be running mac OS 9.1 or above. i am currently running 9.0.4. "ah." i said, and went to  urlLink apple.com  to find the download. there were two i could get. one was the 9.1 i was looking for, the other was 9.2.2. thinking quickly (i'm quite good at that) i decided that i'd opt for 9.2.2, because that would be a step above, and it would obviously result it good to go above the minimum.  it turns out that to use 9.2.2, you must be running 9.2.1. i think i already said i'm running 9.0.4. so, back to apple, to get the 9.1 ::sigh:: this was at 9:30 and i was getting tired of downloads.  9.1, it was finally on my desktop, beaming happily at me. i started the process that is updating your system, and found i needed to restart my computer on the disk that came with the computer. i found that the little post-it note program that is on my comp. ("stickies") prevents me from restarting on the disk.  i know. i tried more than seven times. i finally found something that let me override the post-its and start off the disk. that made me happy for about three minutes. that's the amount of time it took for the boot to finish and me to click on the little 9.1 icon. that's when i got this message that told me that there was an "installation tome" error/problem/thing.  i rebooted normally again so i could re-download the [expletive deleted] thing.  note: it takes exactly 50 minutes to download OS 9.1.  once it was downloaded i rebooted on the disk, and tried again. same error. [expletive deleted]! i gave up and went to bed. today, renewed by all that lovely sleep and a tortuous skiing expedition that i will not speak about, i tried "just one more time" to download the program. same error.  note: at this point all other programs on my computer are now running poorly, and IM refuses to open. i started perusing mac forums and such to try and find out something to do.  i discovered several answers that pleased me because they were simple enough to execute with my small amount of computer skill. so i flashed my PRAM, turned off "mount disk images" in my stuffit expander, and re-downloaded.  (this was my fourth try, if you count my little 9.2.2 thing). same [expletive] error message! and so, deeply dissatisfied with my life and angry at the world i gave up.

      "I can believe things that are true and I can believe things that aren't true and I can believe things where nobody knows if they're true or not. I can believe in Santa Claus and the Easter Bunny and Marilyn Monroe and the Beatles and Elvis and Mister Ed. Listen---I believe that people are perfectible, that knowledge is infinite, that the world is run by secret banking cartels and is visited by aliens on a regular basis, nice ones that look like wrinkledy lemurs and bad ones who mutilate cattle and want our water and our women. I believe that the future sucks and I believe that future rocks and I believe that one day White Buffalo Woman is going to come back and kick everyone's ass. I believe that all men are just overgrown boys with deep problems communicating and that the decline in good sex in America is coincident with the decline in drive-in movie theaters from state to state. I believe that all politicians are unprincipled crooks and I still believe that they are better than the alternative. I believe that California is going to sink into the sea when the big one comes, while Florida is going to dissolve into madness and alligators and toxic waste. I believe that antibacterial soap is destroying our resistance to dirt and disease so that one day we'll all be wiped out by the common cold like the Martians in War of the Worlds. I believe that the greatest poets of the last century were Edith Sitwell and Don Marquis, that jade is dried dragon sperm, and that thousands of years ago in a former life I was a one-armed Siberian shaman. I believe that mankind's destiny lies in the stars. I believe that candy really did taste better when I was a kid, that it's aerodynamically impossible for a bumblebee to fly, that light is a wave and a particle, that there's a cat in a box somewhere who's alive and dead at the same time (although if they don't ever open the box to feed it it'll eventually just be two different kinds of dead), and that there are stars in the universe billions of years older than the universe itself. I believe in a personal god who cares about me and worries and oversees everything I do. I believe in an impersonal god who set the universe in motion and went off to hang with her girlfriends and doesn't even know that I'm alive. I believe in an empty and godless universe of casual chaos, background noise, and sheer blind luck. I believe that anyone who says that sex is overrated just hasn't done it properly. I believe that anyone claims to know what's going on will lie about the little things too. I believe in absolute honesty and sensible social lies. I believe in a woman's right to choose, a baby's right to live, that while all human life is sacred there's nothing wrong with the death penalty if you can trust the legal system implicitly, and that no one but a moron would ever trust the legal system. I believe life is a game, that life is a cruel joke, and that life is what happens when you're alive and that you might as well lie back and enjoy it."  ~Neil Gaiman, American Gods, copyright 2001, page 394. There we go. To all you people who asked what UUs believe, that sums it up. We believe whatever we want, Everything and Nothing.

      here it is. the 22nd of december, three days before christmas, several days into hanukkah, and a day after the solstice. and i feel absolutely no holiday spirit. bah humbug.  i went christmas shopping with my dad, and then with colette.  so far i have purchased  can of octopus, and several presents for my sister. the octopus is for my second cousin, a fourteen year old boy whose name is austin. he wanted canned fish. i hope he's not too sad it's not fish.  i don't think my parents deserve gifts this year.  in other news, i changed the title of my blog. i thought that 'singing in the rain' was a little too happy and bouncy for me. so now welcome to 'shadow on the sky,' title curtsey of aaron baum, who said the aforementioned phrase on friday night.

I passed where a couple of them were group hugging and they randomly included me in their hug. It made my day. Have I blogged about boys in eyeliner yet? Well I will. I think all  boys should wear eyeliner all of the time. No exceptions. Everyone looks better with eyeliner, especially guys. Yum.

      school is majorly depressing, you know that?  i have a really distinct memory of a couple of years ago filling out one of those surveys your friends forward to you... it might even be somewhere in my  urlLink site  but i'm not sure.  anyway, i have this memory of it saying "what makes you happy?" and me writing that life makes me happy because i was never sad.  i don't know what made me sad all the time, with certain things that make me happy, rather than happy all the time with certain things that made me sad.  now it might be my parents, or it might be my life, or it might be the fact that jurewitcz sucked the soul from my body before she became nice, but i think those just add to it. i think it's school. with it's bell and it's desks and it's rigid meals and locked doors, school is making me sick. if i had any say in the matter at this point, i'd go back to homeschooling in an instant. but i made my choice so i'm stuck in this institution until i graduate.

      first day of second semester! yeah! i made it through half the year (though we do have all the fun of AP exams and such this semester)...  and they were kind and didn't give me piles of homework.  speaking of kind people, ms. jurewicz had some sort of revelation and decided over the long weekend that she was going to (and i quote) stop critisizing us, be nicer, realise that she didn't have all the answers, and that we were sometimes right, and it was good to have fun.  it was scary how different she was today.  my guess: she is really sick at home and sent her sister (the other ms. jurewicz) in to school in her place. or she's on drugs. one or the other.  but she says she's going to stay like this. we'll see....

      haven't blogged in a couple days, so here ya go.  i've become addicted to caffeine. i think that's bad and it makes me get this terrible headache if i don't have any. i bought some pepsi yesterday after third hour so that was good. and it gave me back a 1987 quarter... i thought it was new because it was still shiny, but no. it's older than i am.  think about it: in 15 years i learned to walk, cognate, speak english, speak some spanish and really hate school. what has my quarter learned? not much, i'll say that.  in other news, i went to the one acts last night. everyone was surprised because i really didn't care for either of the plays... the marriage of bett and boo was just depressing. i'd prefer not to have to watch an hour and a half of marital problems, i see enough of that at home. matt and aaron were the best parts... acting like bacon and sticking their face in the cake, respectively. jon richardson was good too, but he was still a little depressing. actually, i think it was just the plot i didn't like, the people were fine.  that freshman boy i accidentally waved at the other day (loong story) was there and waited for me to sit down so he could sit near me. ugh. i really don't need a little freshman boy following me around. i don't even know his name... but he's in freshman band and i think he's in my pepband which is going to make things awkward. i figured out last night that i'm really short. i don't think i'd ever noticed that before. sure, people call me "little amelia" and "baby amelia" (wait... that's not people, that's alex, lol) but i had a mental block about how short i am. i was helping chinh get to his locker, and we were going down the stairs and i saw in the window that he's a head and shoulders taller than me...  but i figured out how i kept this from myself. it's my "metal height." that's what i call how tall i think i am. i guess i focus my eyes a lot higher than the top of my head, which tricks me into thinking about 5'7", which i'm not at all. this is going to take some getting used to.

      Woohoo I'm done with the week. What a relief. History day is over! Ben C. got punched in the face! By Brett! ::Dances:: Quick recap of good highlights: History day- I ran around and ate everyone's McDonalds. Then I got judged and didn't win. Poo on Andrea Buchard. Ben wrecks Brett's project and gets what he's had coming forever. Too bad Brett didn't hit him harder, no visible bruises.  Library with Chinh- Yay for Chinh who goes to the library all the time with me. We saw an honest-to-god girl fight... Complete with slapping, hairpulling and lots of "Bitch! You ain't gonna get on top of MY man!" "Bitch! He's not yours!" the police came. How exciting. Chinh- "See, this is how African Americans get all those bad stereotypes..." Oh, and one last note? These were junior high kids, maybe my little sister's age. How sad is that? Christoph's song- Well, he gets credit for playing me a song, but I'm going to get another, just you wait and see. Euro- I really should read the chapters. Soon. They've only been due for a few weeks.  Chem- Miss Lane is THE sweetest person ever, but giving us more homework isn't going to take our focus off of euro. Sorry Miss Lane, but everything comes second to euro. Those flaming clouds were cool though.  Exposure- Wow that was a good show. I wish it was running next weekend because I want to go see it again. And not only was it good, it had Andy McLaughlin in it. Hadn't seen him for a few years... (Read= four to five years) I think I scared him by knowing his name, he didn't seem to remember me, but that's ok.  I missed the Nutcracker this year, so I was glad to see him.  I usually go to see how my friends are doing, who dropped out, who's anorexic, etc. Kinda sad and creepy of me, I know.  Euro hangs in a cloud of doom over my head, and I need to know it, because "someday, in the great big pickle bowl of life," I'm going to end up there, according to Jurewicz.

      Blogger hates me.... for the life of me I can't delete those last two posts.  Don't worry, I'm not crazy (yet) and i don't need a place to live (thanks Colette).  I was having a really bad day... if you didn't guess already, lol.  I'm better now that I'm back at school where everyone loves me.  Yay.  History day is going well, I might even get done on time.  Euro homework is going... not so well, but you know, I don't really care.   Journalism sucks monkeys.  That project makes me sad, and the feature for tomorrow does too. This whole Adam/Chinh thing is bad.... I hope that neither of them hate me.  I'm off to do some work, maybe. Or something.

      yesterday was one looong day. i got up and left the house around 7 (morning time!), ate breakfast at  urlLink al's  , which is THE best place to eat breakfast, especially if you're really hungry. then i went to my dad's work and sat on one of those chairs i love and did math homework.  at about 11:30 we went out to have lunch at the downtown keys cafe, and (ok, i'll admit it) went to big brain comics before going back to the world of math. i know, i'm doomed to be a fangirl. i bought the first issue of 1602, which i didn't know had started yet.  sorry! i know none of you have a clue what i'm talking about.  anyway, i did math again until about 7:30 when i went home and ate more. then from like nine to 11 my dad and i watched emperor's club, which is a really good movie, if slightly depressing.  all in all, other than doing about 12 hours of math and only getting two assignments done (johnson is the devil), i had a good day.  today, i have the same plan (-ish). i got up at 9:30, read the ny times and the comics from the strib, then did my terms for euro. at noon (9 minutes, by my clock) i start math again.

      man... school sucks. really, i don't know why i keep going. i was in pain yesterday, and instead of just sitting around and doing nothing, as i would have liked, i had to work on my euro project until 11 (which is late for me!). then this morning, instead of sleeping in, i got up early, took a shower that hurt my face, and worked more on my project. you'd think with all the time i put into it it'd look nice, but no. it's a piece of trash, and jurewicz is going to eat me for it. but blake was true to his word and did the handout, yay.  today was the first readthrough of the play, and if there's anything more depressing than sitting for two hours and watching the people who got in have a great time and read over the script they get to work with, i don't know what it is. and i can tell that this is going to be an uber-exclusive cast. you can tell it's going to be a cast vs. crew kinda deal. i don't know why people DO that. the plays i was in, i tried to talk to the crew and not make them feel like they were somehow insuperior just because they weren't up on stage during the show. that wouldn't make sense. but whatever, i guess they can do what they want. they each beat out 6.25 people to get their part, so they have the right to be self-centered. the crew only had to have more experience, or be better liked, than one person to get their spot.  i have so much homework. math is one of the worst subjects i know of. remember when i liked math? i do. but now it reminds me of a moving train. you get sick, you fall off the train. if you want to get back on you have to use one of those old cart things that you have to manually pump along the tracks to get where you're going. don't know what i'm talking about? well, look  urlLink here . so i'm on one of those carts, and i'm trying to watch the train so i know which tracks to take, but i'm also trying to pump myself along.  i feel about the same way in euro. but in euro i started out on the cart, and every know and then i get close enough to touch the train, so i reach out and try and grab on. most of the time i think i caught on to something, but then i realize that i didn't and fall onto the tracks and get run over by my own cart.  and i have the WORST luck ever. my surgery is going to have to be postponed yet again because of my fat lip. i was going to miss my math test for it, which would have given me a couple extra days to study. that would have been god, but no, it has to be postponed. lets see, math, euro, the play, my mouth, what else can i bitch about? i'm in a bad mood and i really don't feel like doing my notecards for english at all. fifteen for tomorrow, and i have no more sources. it's gonna suck. i need to get some interviews or something. maybe i'll get to talk to neil gaiman! that'd be fun. i'm kind of upset at cristoph and claxton and hambro, because after last week they don't make fun of me at all. if they do, and i make even the slightest face they're like "i didn't mean it, i'm sorry." would someone slap some sense into them please? i just got upset because they were succumbing to the stereotypes that everyone has set into their heads, and they wouldn't even listen to me if i tried to tell them what it was really like.  i've been thinking about the ib program, and i don't know if i really want to do it. i don't even know if i want to go to school next year. i know that might totally ruin my chances of going to design school in europe, if anywhere, but i don't know how much more of this i can take. sure, the people are great, for the most part, but there are lots of people i could live without. and lots of classes and stress i could live without. if only homeschooling didn't mean i had to be around my parents all the time. then it'd be perfect.

       People SUCK, you know that?  really, they do. i hate everyone. absolutely everyone. well, i don't hate solly. i guess i hate everyone except solly.  really, how hard is it to listen?  also, i hate school. my ideal plan for this weekend would be: take a "magically make you all better in one second" pill, eat a lot of food, and stay in one chair for as long as i possibly could, doing nothing. the real weekend i'm going to have? not as much fun.... i'm still sick, and i don't have any magic pills, so i'm going to stay that way. hopefully i'll still get to eat a lot, but idk. and i'm going to have a lot of stuff to do... communications, euro, math and spanish are sucking it up right now. poo. why can't all my classes be like band? do nothing and get an A, i like it.   I love Solly I hate school

      school has become not very fun. i'm not sure how or when i noticed that i hate it... but yeah, i really do. only a couple more years and i can get away though. leave it all behind and live in europe. that'll be so nice. no worrys or thoughts about people i want to forget. and away from all this crazy bush stuff. he really needs to lose this election, but we all know hes going to win. stupid republicans.  today was crap. i was having a bad day to begin with and then my glasses got stepped on and bent all out of shape. it really wasn't my fault either, but it made me feel worse than i had before.  now it's time for the torture that is homework.

      blerg. i'm sick. stay-home-from-school sick. weird-fever-dreams sick. i spent yesterday at the library doing stuff for school. probably i shouldn't have gone... i got home, feverish and dizzy, ate dinner and went straight to bed (at 7:30). woke up this morning at 10:30, very unhappy. missing school is nice, but you have this dread in the back of your mind saying "amelia! you need to be doing homework absolutely every second of this day in order to not fall even more behind in school!" which is true, but depressing.  so i'm researching analgesics on google.  because logic is the first thing to go when you get a virus, i keep entering weird search terms like "strong analgesics high school chemistry -cancer" which gives me nothing because people in high school chemistry don't get to play with strong analgesics.  but other than being disgustingly sick, i'm fine. a couple of things that are making me mad:   urlLink deaf kids can't watch all the crap on tv that the rest of us can, thanks to george bush   and  urlLink  because of george bush (again) i might have to join the army against my will to fight "terrorism"

      you know when something totally illogical happens? well i just had something like that. i was looking through profiles of people on AIM, because i'm creepy like that, and i saw something that made me really sad. and it wasn't ANYTHING. it was so weird.... today was apparently the day that everyone gives valentines at school... but i didn't give anyone anything. haha. instead, i wrote "I [heart] U, amame" (for those of you that don't speak spanish, amame is the command "love me" and it can mean two things ::wink::) oh, and i had my  urlLink anti-valentine  on.  ok, a question. why is it that the freshman boys at our school are so cool? the girls, excepting a few of them, are whores, but the guys (at least that i know) are great. a list of my favorites: adam s., gabe s., dylan d. (!!!!!), solly k.(of course) and tommy m. solly has the honor of being the only non-drummer of the bunch, and tommy is the only non-jewish one.  some memories: adam: "well, someone might pose that question to me, if they were unfamiliar with time travel" "i just thought i'd need a 9-volt battery today" "have you ever thought that maybe one snowflake is just staying in one place and the whole world is just moving around it?"  gabe: good times at percussion ensemble! i remember when he visited the school from tcjms and came to my civics class and we were having debates and he joined right in. yay gabe.  dylan: "do you think people will think my nipple is glowing?" "lets make up our own version of shuffleboard with construction materials!" "here, i'll be a revolving door and you run through me!"  grrr... cowbell fights  solly: "appearently, it was in dutch." aime "is that you signing with your mouth?" me "no, that's solly, signing with his hand." ms. johnson "because all the pi's got..." solly "eaten!" solly has got to be the greatest guy ever.   tommy: tommy is a riot. he's always sort of hitting on me but it's ok because he's funny doing it. i remember at pepband he thought he'd hit me with his drumstick and he got soooo upset. he apologized over and over.  today he was drumming on me, which i can only tolerate in small SMALL amounts so i turned around and he goes "sorry, i was just patting you. a little 'happy valentines day' love pat" LOL. he kept doing it, too. i moved over near jourdan and he followed me so he could keep it up.  grrr...bassdrum fights  i was looking through my quote book for quotes from all these people, and i found a couple that i don't think i've posted before that need to be seen.  "i love the green grapes... i mean olives" aime  "we talk same!" colette "no, i just had a spasm" jesse from math. appearently he just finished a calculator program and jumped (literally) out of his seat. he kind of scares me... "when am i ever going to use this in the real world? have you ever heard someone say 'i work at inverse functions, it's very interesting'?" chinh "i lost my numbers" suzy "is there a vertizontal?" deep. he's so stupid. and inappropriately named. the other day in science he kept saying that you can get ecstasy prescribed from a doctor.  ooh but i did feel bad for him when that pharmacy guy was like "you guys are so lucky, if you got hit in the face with a softball and your teeth got messed up you'd have the money to get it fixed." i think deep was asleep for that part of the talk though. at least i i hope he was....

      ok... update on my life! i didn't have to run the mile becuase of my little pass-out-when-i-run problem. the doctor thinks i probably have asthma, but there's some strange condition that makes you drop dead randomly when you run. the only people who ever have that problem are people who have heart murmurs. guess what i have? that's right, i was born with a heart murmur, it went away when i was 2-ish and it seems to have come back. crap. so no running in gym for a while, at least until i get that checked out. i'm calling this my "awkward year," because i got braces, glasses, oral surgery and possibly asthma already. and i might drop dead. adolescence sucks.  hmm... school sucks. a whole lot. i keep getting Cs on tests, which i hate. not bad enough to redo the test, but not good enough that you want to tell any of your friends (or deep, lol). so far i got a C on: two ap euro tests, a whole bunch of chem tests, and i think one spanish test, which doesn't really count becuase she's curving it and i'll get an A.  we've been listening to a different popular song in spanish every week, and it's cool becuase you really learn the lyrics and what they're saying in them. i downloaded fotographia becuase i liked it a lot, and i can really sing along with it. that makes me happy. a little plug for macs: i got a virus in my email the other day. did it do anything? nope. and unlike all your vastly inferior computers, my mac was intuitively designed. and i have iTunes... and it works. yeah, i know i'm cool. for those of you in euro, you may appreciate  urlLink this . i know we didn't learn about him, he was before chapter 10, but really, who can pass up an exploding corpse? where do i get links like this, you might ask. well, it's simple. i steal them from  urlLink neil gaiman.  he's got something new almost every day. on the subject of gaiman (!!), i don't think i mentioned that i'm writing my literature-based paper for comm. on graphic novels. it may not go over too well, but i bet ms. wilfahrt will remember me for it.   um... i'd best go avoid homework in another part of my house so my parents don't start to suspect.

      lalala. i think i adjusted to glasses. they make me feel smart. yay!   and i'm happy cause i have coloured pens now! everything i write is pretty and happy. even homework. so if you didn't guess, i'm having a good day. some moments: colette trys to grab my arm, grabs the button of my shirt and rips it off, along with some of the fabric. people tell me i'm breaking dress code (midriff!) adam tells me that some people are born without muscles and walks away. what a freak.  ms johnson is talking about the homework and says "all the pi's got..." and solly interrupts with "eaten!" yay i love solly. chinh pours his coke onto the table and we freak out. well, i do. alex stays calm.  alex talks to chinh, alex c, andy j, ezra and christoph about my not having cleavage.  then they throw me around the circle.  christoph and chinh have to save me from andy and the alex's squared who like to hit me. what violent children.

      ok... glasses confuse me. i SWEAR the walls bend away when i put on these stupid things... but i'll admit i can see better with them.  chinh and i broke our promise not to go to mcdonalds today. i think we lasted two days. but we ate "healthy" food. meaning very few fries. and we were going to get salads. i swear.  did you know it costs less money to buy medium fries then small fries? and salads cost two times as much money as sandwiches. why is that? oh, i know. they want to make us fat. stupid mcdonalds, no wonder america is obese.

      ::sigh of contentment:: i'm feeling sooo much better now. yay for break.  yesterday i just chilled with my dad and sister all day. we ate thai food. yum.  today i got up waaay too early (ok, it was nine o'clock), went to the y and swam laps (which is the best stress reliever i have at my fingertips as of now), worked on my history day project (yeah, that's right), and watched the matrix. the real one. the last time i saw it was on tv, where they edited out "inappropriate" parts, including the whole "there is no spoon" scene. needless to say, when all the scenes were there i understood it one hundred times better. i'm going to eat dinner soon. but first, a shameless plug for me. against my better judgement, and most likely jurewitz's too, i'm going on to  urlLink regional history day  on thursday. if you come, there'll be people from slp, plus annie and sarah (my homeschooled buddies) and i don't know who all else.  be there or be square!

      "I love deadlines - I love the whooshing noise they make as they go by"        - Douglas Adams  Luckily for me, this deadline whooshed past, and I was ready for it. Communications paper equals done. Other than that I had a horrible day. Absolutely ghastly ("you mean you won't even tell us the title?" "that WAS the title, absolutely ghastly").  Yesterday, after not making the Echo (which meant a lot more to me than any of you will likely ever find out), and getting Butzen on my back for not going to crew often enough, I went home, avoided euro and worked on my paper until midnight. At midnight I was done, it looked good and I was ready to print it. Stupid Ms. Wilfahrt had added some requirements on the font, and, like always, my computer didn't have what I needed. Picture me, the last one up in my house, sneaking out into our living room to turn on my sister's computer in the dark. Approximately ten minutes later, I'm dead tired, and I realize that the font New York isn't a PC font, and it should be on my Mac. After looking for it again on mine, I give up and go to bed.  I woke up at six to print my paper. But first I had to download the font. Luckily my computer is brilliant and did all the installation itself. But when I switched all my text to New York, it messed up the formatting and my nice page numbers. By seven I was ready to print. I finished printing at eight-something, and rushed out of the door. I got to school five minutes before first hour ended. So my paper was on time. Yay.  Going on in the day, euro sucked because I failed that WWI test. Glurg. Spanish test I didn't know about. Sigh. Being unhappy and waaay to hot in band. "What's wrong with the heating in this school?" Going to counseling to get my schedule for next year changed so it doesn't include Echo. Painful. Going to gym late and getting an unexcused absence. Argh. Getting to math... Ah, getting to math. I definitely have not been on my "math train" for a couple of weeks, and didn't really understand stuff I knew was going to be on the test. Just imagine my dismay when my systems of equations test turned out to have conics review problems on it. I left maybe five out of twenty questions blank, a through c, most of them. So I failed it. No two ways about it. I might have done better, had I been able to utilize the five to ten extra minutes she gives us after the bell if I didn't have to run to an orthodontic appointment.  Ortho appointment was supposed to last about 45 minutes. It definitely broke the hour and a half mark. The dental assistant people were laughing at me. I think someone's shift ended while they were working on my mouth, because the hands changed a couple of times. They did four painful things: 1.  They attached the chain to my braces, starting to pull down my tooth. 2.  They skipped a couple of wire sizes and put a new wire on my bottom teeth. 3.  They skipped one wire size and put a new wire on my top teeth.  4.  They re-cemented a bracket that fell off during steps one to three. Needless to say, I wasn't in the best of moods by the end. After that, I got to go BACK to school for crew. I was only there for about 20 minutes, and then it was over. But Donny was wearing my pants. I was angry. After THAT I got to go with my dad to meet one of his friends at a coffee shop somewhere. I fell asleep on the table. Then I got to go to my dad's work.  See what a fun life I have? Don't you wish you had it? Oh yeah... And History Day, on Thursday, I think. I need to totally redo my whole project between now and then. And read chapters 28-29 in the euro book. And do catch-up. And start reviewing for the exam. Everyone who's not in euro: rejoice, for thou hath the mercy of God on your side.

      well... i got on im again today ::looks ashamed:: and it really wasn't all that fun. i had a nice conversation with brendan, but that was about it.  today i feel sick-ish and i don't know why. it might be that i got too much sleep last night, as it was more than 12 hours. or it might be becuase i choose to eat strange things... today i've had: coffee, a bunch of pretzels, and a yogurt.  the people from duluth east think that our school has a problem... dylan and i weren't really acting like normal people last night. between dylan throwing his pop bottle (full) up into the air and hitting someone from their school on the head, us convincing their percussion section that dylan was eight and a half, and dylan yelling "lets play the relvolving door game" rather loudly at me, they thought we were nuts. i guess it wasn't really my fault though, i was only partially involved in any of those activities.  the other percussionist last night was mark patterson, who also thinks that dylan and i have problems. no one really appritiates the revolving door game except for us. and one time we played shuffleboard with some construction materials we found, people thought we were pretty strange too.  ANYWAY the computers at school are against me... i swear, it's a conspiracy. they repeatedly have deleted saved work of mine  "uh oh, what did jesus tell us?" ~stupid person reviewing dawn of the dead on moviefone.com

      i tried to go to school today, i really did. and i made it through the first hour ok... and half of second! but then i was feeling all icky and woozy, maybe becuase i've had about three times the normal doseage of aleve in the last couple of days... blergh. so i'm working on english. and you have my word i'm never going to take anything like heroin--- ever. codene that i had two days ago is enough for me forever.

      surgery! not so fun, but whatever, it's over with.  i learned a couple of things though: laughing gas makes me paranoid, and local anesthesia would make the ultimate date-rape drug.  now i have: this little chain attached to my braces, but not very tight (yet. that's next week); a slightly woozey feeling from the stuff they put me to sleep with/codine/novecain/laughing gas/stuff i have to rinse my mouth with; a hole in my mouth filled up with cotton; disolving stiches; and one GROSS baby tooth with huge roots. also some drugs, over the counter and otherwise.  my mouth bled while i was asleep, and now my pillow is really disgusting... hoepfully that won't happen again tonight.  needless to say i'm not the happiest camper, but as of yet i'm subsiding on aleve, and haven't broken into the 'stonger stuff.' i'm getting lonely without my im... email me! call me!

      so last night i went to a jazz concert with colette (fun). she kept calling the kid in front of us "weird hair" and she thought he couldn't hear her, but then he did... it was awkward. anyway, then i slept over at her house and we watched jurassic park III, which was a bad, bad movie. but colette was commenting on it in this russian (i think) accent, so it was funny. then we didn't sleep. for a looong time. [i love colette] this morning i did... actually not sure. some percentage of it was spent in uptown, i remember that. shoe shopping maybe? now i'm doing my homework and listening to a cd that i managed to burn using my superior technology skills! it's all the songs i've bought on iTunes, plus a couple others. i know you're all just burning to know what i listen to, so here you go, lol.  i fought the law--greenday blue (da ba dee)--eiffel 65 video killed the radio star--the buggles substitute--the who tiny dancer--ben folds fotografia--juanes til i hear it from you--gin blossoms a praise chorus--jimmy eat world your flag decal won't get you into heaven anymore--john prine bleed american--jimmy eat world would you...?--touch and go white flag--dido a thousand miles--vanessa carlton you belong to me--jason wade naked--avril lavigne i want you to want me--cheap trick it's my life--no doubt  i do understand that this is THE most random compilation of songs ever, but you know, i like them. if you haven't heard "your flag decal [...]" you should. it's an anti-vietman war song, but i think it applies now, too.

      it was a not so very good today. oh, it had potential for being good, being a snowday and all, but it wasn't good.  if i lived in slp or anywhere around there my life would be so much better. i got all the way to school before i figured out that it was closed, and by then it was too late to drive me home. because of distance issues, i ended up at my dad's work waiting for my mother. my mother came and drove me to her work. i sat there and read a book for a couple of hours. then i got to walk across the u of m campus to my mother's chem class. with my whole f-ing backpack. i was sooo sore. then my mom and i went shopping.  if shopping for clothes isn't the most depressing thing in the world, i don't know what is. i can never find clothes that are in anything resembling my size that's not incredibly ugly, so then i get all upset. then the man from pacsun was hitting on me, which would have raised my spirits if he wasn't at least ten years older than me and unattractive. ugh.  i got home and started reading 'my blogs' (mostly of people i don't know that i just like, don't ask) because i don't have im to divert me this month (as a quasi-joke i gave it up for lent. please note that i'm not christian, so it's not really lent for me, but i decided it was as good an excuse as any to rid myself of the time-wasting habit).  reading blogs always puts something on my mind, and today it's relationships, so that's what i'm going to write about (in other words, most of you can stop reading here and skip down to the bottom if you'd like)  i'm always kind of depressed because, sure, i've got great friends, but i've never had a 'relationship' (ie boyfriend/girlfriend) and it seems like everyone i know has. maybe it was just from like forth grade when you told people you were 'going out' with that kid in the corner or whatever, but i never had that experience. homeschoolers are so standoffish when it comes to dating. i feel like i'm behind in the evolutionary relationship machine that everyone has to go through. i want to be able to say 'i'm going out with so and so.' it's as simple as that.  and it isn't, because i know that once i get over that stage i'll be in the longer-term relationship phase. you know, dating for months, lol.  someone who seems like they 'like me.' i guess that'd make me happy too. i mean, i can always pretend that whoever i have a crush on likes me back because of little things they do, but i'm sure that for the most part that comes from my imagination. i'm stuck in this 'i like him [point]. over there'  kinda thing. that's as far as anything goes. ever. and that depresses me.  you know those ads on the sides of buses that say 'finally understood sappy songs'? that's what i want. to be able to relate to all the relationship based things in our culture.  people (this was especially true last year) ask me 'what kind of music do you listen to?' and i never have an answer. lyrics of songs never have to do with my life. there are no 'school sucks/everything sucks/my parents need a divorce' songs out there.  i listen to music by turning it down really low so i don't really hear it, it just blocks everything else out. i like dance music and crappy pop songs that don't have meaningful lyrics. or songs that have lyrics that i don't understand.  so you all need to find me a guy, ok? that's your job. it'd be great if i liked them too... but it's not really necessary. and i'm not talking about people like the man at pacsun, or that freshman kid from band that still stares at me in the halls. i want someone to talk to. tall order, i know but i bet you can do it. [i wasn't going to post this, i was just going to vent. so feel lucky i let you into my head]

      yay for spring, it's starting! i was soo happy today! ::dances:: maybe i'll always be happy now. i think i finally caught up to the 'math train' and i may have grabbed hold of the 'euro train.' right now i'm wearing my green pants and humming this song. it's the song from (the original) parent trap, where they're marching out to the seclusion cabin (which, by the way, is really creepy... imagine, miles from anywhere with the one person you hate most). anyway, they're marching, and alllll the campers are following and whistling this song that i have stuck in my head. yay.

      now for a fun rant about amelia's biggest pet peeve! i hate (drumroll please) people who put lyrics in their blog! AAAAAAAH it makes me want to die.  why, you ask? well, because i don't care about lyrics. i like music, but reading lyrics is only fun if you know the song and want to make sure you understand it or something.  also, so what if the song relates to your life? or you listened to it today? just write "i like the song X, by band Y" and leave it at that. or, if you need to put lyrics in, take a key phrase or quote. even a whole verse is fine. but you don't need to put the whole [expletive deleted] song in! it's not like everyone who reads it is going to be like "oh, that's sooo deep! my life is changed forever!"  plus, i don't believe that anyone actually READS the lyrics. mostly, they look at the title and the artist and scroll past the song. i think mosty people put lyrics in to make their blog look longer. haha good trick! everyone's fooled!   i'm going to end with a song that i like. it's called "don't put lyrics in your blog", by the band "me" "oh i hate lyrics in blogs  yeah yeah, yeah yeah blogs (blogs) songs (songs) i hate.... i hate....  LYRICS IN BLOGS  keys on brass boy i hate that sound keys on brass lets dance around everyone likes to keep in touch (keep in touch) feathers in the air  they fall on my face... and i sing keys on brass i hate lyrics  yeah yeah, yeah yeah blogs (blogs) songs (songs) i hate... i hate... LYRICS IN BLOGS  maybe you think you're cool well let me tell you you're not!  if i went fishing, i'd leave you home 'cause you're not cool!  fish are cool they have gills on the side of their face you have lungs, so i hate you  yeah yeah, yeah yeah blogs (blogs) songs (songs) i hate... i hate... LYRICS IN BLOGS  my brain is going to burst flying fish! falling from the sky that's cool, not like you (boo!) i have a mouse, just like you except i use mine for good unlike you evil monster what kind of torture... is a blog... with lyrics?   yeah yeah, yeah yeah blogs (blogs) songs (songs) i hate... i hate... LYRICS IN BLOGS  sometimes lyrics make me want to cut my eyes out with sissors other times i just scream! (scream!) self mutilation is a bitter path but it's better than reading your... reading you... BLOG WITH LYRICS!"  i hope that moved you as much as it moved me

      "Please understand my reasons for not speaking today. I am participating in the Day of Silence, a national youth movement protesting the silence faced by lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people and their allies. My deliberate silence echoes that silence, which is caused by harassment, prejudice, and discrimination. I believe that ending the silence is the first step toward fighting these injustices. Think about the voices you are not hearing today. What are you going to do to end the silence?"  ~The card I carried today to explain to my teachers why I couldn't answer questions in class.   This was such a weird experience, not talking for a whole day. It felt really isolated, as I guess it should. A lot of people didn't talk to me because I couldn't answer. People accepted it though, and I invented some "sign language" so I could be understood. I wrote lots of notes, especially to teachers.  But it was so hard. Talking is just my nature. If I can't talk I get bored. I had a couple of slip-ups in classes where I always talk.  For example, I got lost in the music we're playing in band so I turned to John and said "where...?" before I realized my mistake.  Gym class was the biggy... I talked at least three times during that class. For some reason swimming makes me need to talk.  When the fire alarm went off before I had changed out of my suit I swore. A couple times, pretty loud. But other than that I was good.  I'm definitely doing it again next year.

      since i know everyone has excess time on their hands, i thought i'd make some lists of must-dos for all.  must reads: the hitchhiker's guide to the galaxy trilogy (all five, please) the sandman graphic novel series (at least the doll's house and brief lives) books by neil gaiman (neverwhere is a good place to start) last chance to see (non-fiction! broaden your horizons!) norton I, emperor of the united states, a biography (again, non-fiction) this book will change your life ( urlLink website ) rats saw god (i was hallucinating last time i read this, it may or may not be good) how to deal (yes, it's a "girl book," but it's a heck of a lot better than the movie looks.) the adventures of blue avenger (the worst book in the history of mankind)  must sees: amelie (subtitles!) hard day's night (where do you think music videos came from?) the gods must be crazy (it's been years, and i watched it when i was sick. be warned) empire records (....) school of rock (wooo!) an american in paris (you will want to shoot yourself, but at least it's classic. no plot, too much tap dancing, but classic)  must hear: would you...? (this is a quality song)  there'll be more later

      i went to this poetry reading thing at FAIR today, and it was pretty cool. the kid who won (stupid idea, having prizes) did this cute poem about love being like a roller coaster and the different types of roller coasters (aka relationships). some paraphrased quotes: rollercoasters can surprise you. one day you think the loop comes before the corkscrew, and the next day they come at the same time.  just stuff like that, but it was cute because he was really young.  so anyway, he finishes and people get to ask questions. this teacher raises her hand and asks "how many roller coasters have you been on?" and he starts talking about how he used to live in orlando so he went on them almost every weekend. he went to disneyland or some such, and when he was there, he "discovered the hulk." he had no idea what she was really trying to ask him. i was dying of laughter, because here's this really innocent little kid telling everyone (unknowingly to him) that he's had like ten million weird relationships. it was great. i hope he didn't see me. i was literally crying from laughter. i guess you had to be there though.  anyway, it made me happy.

      A couple of things I love: I love  urlLink this  song. Wait for it to load, it's incredibly worth it. Incredibly funny.  I love this boy I saw yesterday. He was maybe 7th grade and he was the best flute player I think I've ever heard. Amazing. He had this whole piece memorized, and he was looking really happy as he played. It made my day. But to add to that, he was wearing pinstriped wool pants. Wool pants, and he looked happy. Wow. To add to THAT his name in the program was Iz Pollak. My sister told me later you say eye-zee, but I still wanted his name. What if my name were Iz? Like "is." And his last name was Pollak. Like the painter. AND (this is my miracle child, I swear) he had his hair in 4-inch spikes all over his head.  So here are the things he has going for him: he's a male flute player (majorly cool), he's GOOD at the thing, he can memorize music, he can look happy while playing it, he can look happy while playing it and wearing wool pants, he has the coolest name in the world, and he has awesome hair.  In case he ever finds this site (which he might, how many Izaac Pollaks are there?) I want to ask him this: Will you marry me? Please?

      i could talk about what a horrible day i had. i could talk about giving away horst's remains in euro. i could talk about going to the orthodontist. i could even talk about my hatred for rubber bands. but i'm not going to. instead, today's blog will be a short glimpse into just one of the small psychological problems i gave myself when i was younger. (background: i wanted to have psychological problems when i was about 7, so i basically just convinced myself i had them. it does lead to complexes when you get older, so i guess if i was still 7 i'd be very happy) today's problem is my compulsive need to apologize for everything. and i mean everything. lately this has been bothering me, but i can't stop myself. so i've been trying to hide it with passing it off as a joke. listen to me for a while and you'll see what i mean. i don't know if this was a problem i wanted when i was younger, or one that i just got because of the way my parents brought me up. i'm pretty sure it was how i was brought up. i was the most polite little kid you'd ever meet. i held doors for people, picked up money that strangers dropped (even if it was just a penny) and give it back to them. i always said please and thank you. and if i did something wrong, i'd apologize.  but while being apologetic is something a lot of people are, my little issue is a little bigger. if i'm at home, for example, and i remember something i did/said/etc. that might have hurt/embarrassed/disappointed/confused anyone in any way, i'll apologize. right there. as many times as i have to until i feel better. this may be one time, it may be 50, you never know. in addition to this i'll apologize in person the next day, if possible. i even apologize if i think i may not have been acting normal that day. if i'm extra happy or sad, and someone comments, i'm as likely to say "i'm sorry, i'll try to fix that" as anything.  so anyway, (just stopped myself from saying sorry) that's my thought of the day.

      i hate ms. foresberg. there are no words for this hatred. i don't hate her as a person, but as a teacher.  i don't know why people are happy to have her instead of johnson. johnson was a much better teacher. maybe we didn't have as much time at the end of class to goof off, but who cares? at least we knew what we were doing. i can almost hear everyone yelling "no! i understand this unit better than anything ms. johnson ever taught us!" but did you ever think that the reason for that might be this is the easiest unit ever?  she doesn't have to be a good teacher for us to understand mean median mode. there's no thinking involved in that.  conics? maybe we didn't understand them, but that's not because johnson is a bad teacher, it's because conics suck.  i think the main problem with foresberg is that she's used to regular math students. the kids that have a third grade reading level and smoke pot. they don't question teachers. they just sit and wait for the class to end. therefore, she has become good at teaching to that captive audience. when she was thrown our class, she thought we'd do the same, but instead we do what honors kids live to do: ask questions.  that's why you always (always) give formulas and basic rules before you start to teach. it prevents piles of questions like "why are you doing this?" if you start with an example, make it a simple one, that everyone understands.  do not, for example, say "and now we have to divide everything by 9.5, you'll learn why later."  also, examples should be just that, examples. they should not stand in for teaching. for example, you cannot say "here are four examples to show you how this works. figure them out and you understand the unit." this just confuses people, and makes them hate you.  last year, when i was in regular algebra (i took honors geometry at the same time! don't laugh!) our teacher, ms. moore, would give examples to show how to do something. as a result of this, when test days came up and we made our notecards, most students would write example problems onto theirs, and try and do the test exclusively by plugging new numbers into the example problems.  using this meathod gets you to about a 50% understanding level, because you can do the exact sort of problems done in class, but not variations on them. that is where rules come in. if you know the rules, you can figure out any problems placed in front of you. so. that is ms. foresberg's first problem. examples instead of teaching. her second problem is much larger and more gruesome. she uses inpractical examples and problems. at the begining of this unit i am fairly certain she thought this exact thought:  "hmmm... we have nothing to learn right now, what can i do? oh, i know, mean median mode. but the honors book does not contain those sorts of problems. what will i do? i know, i'll use regular math's worksheets. the kids will never know the difference."  well, sorry, but i noticed. these problems ask you to make up your own data. let me repeat that: make up your own data.  lets think about the future for a moment, shall we? i'm some person, working somewhere that needs math. not mcdonalds, lets assume for right now. so i'm sitting there. maybe i do standard deviation, maybe not. but is that data i work with ever completely fabricated? no (i don't work at enron). so that's a bad problem to make us do.  the rest of the problems involve people, with names like bill and julie. bill thinks you should find the standard deviation by taking the square root of each number in your data set, adding them up and dividing by twelve. julie thinks the standard deviation is just the average. they ask us: using this data, figure out the standard deviation as they would, and put them in order from smallest to largest.  does no one see the error in this problem? i do! they use the wrong formulas! what does this teach us? what does this accomplish? we know how to do the problems wrong, i guess. but what use is that? it's just going to confuse you more! so, as you might have guessed by the length of this post, i'm angry. at math. and foresberg. and the kids in my class who believe she's a good teacher. ::grrrr::

      :dances, runs around in circles, does jumping jacks and sits down:: i have so much energy!!!! wooooooooo!!!! i love rugby, it is the sport of the day/month/year/life. it's one sport that everyone sucks about equally at, so i'm not at a huge disadvantage by being dumb and uncoordinated.  in other news, i have some very attractive neighbors. i may have to start moving the lawn more or something, so i can see them. one of them is my age and his dad is friends with my dad... i used to see him at church and stuff when we were little. but i hadn't seen him in at least six years, and he's gotten really nice since then... mmmm. the other one i'm not quite sure he's attractive, but without my glasses (which aren't that strong) he looked exactly like orlando bloom. i may live outside this summer. yep, i love my life.

      new layout! thanks, blogger! if only i knew css, the world would be a better place. but it seems like most stuff will still take html, so i'm ok for now.  in other news: i'm happy! why? two reasons: first, i have a mac. mwahahaha, everyone who has been infected with this new virus, i pity you for not having a mac. second: i'm really excited for rugby! so... yeah... i'm happy!

       WOW.  euro is over. the class, i mean. the ap test is still on friday, but we finished the final. ::shocked pause:: i don't know what i'm going to do with myself now. so much free time! but i need to study for that exam. i love the word exam, by the way. at least i like it when it refers to something big like the ap euro test. it's got a lot of wieght to it, so you can feel the months of sleep-deprived days and evenings of studying. "yeah, i've got an exam to study for." and even though i hate lyrics, here's a short (short) quote from my new favorite song.   "Ella mueve su cintura al ritmo del tan tan y el se va divorciando del Tio Sam el se refugia en su piel, la quiere para el y ella se va olvidando de Fidel que sabian Lenin y Lincoln del amor que saben Fidel y Clinton del amor"

(weasel 39! weasel 39!) study group at mcdonalds. darren's dance moves at emily's. i'm ready for this test ::snicker::  theatre: "running the sound board" (sounds a lot more impressive than it really is) and the broken cd player slash fixing the cd player(s) using finger oil and our powers of good thought. my secret pal who writes me poems. crews with no work ethic.  parents: my mother going to a drag party. yeah... our house is awkward right now.  um... i love you all!  and after may 7th i'll figure out what you've been doing for the past six to nine months

      last night i went to see dodgeball with the gang, as my father calls my friends, and it ended up not being as horrible as i thought it would be.  basically it follows a common plot line. (if you haven't seen the movie and are usually surprised by plot twists, skip this paragraph). there's the big guy and the little (average joe) guy. there's a girl. there's a guy with a strange character flaw. there's an unpopular kid. the big guy and the little guy come into conflict, there's a face off. the little guy does well for a long time. then the little guy loses confidence for some reason. suddenly (gasp) it looks like the big guy just won everything. but wait! in a strange twist of fate and loyalty, everyone is back together! the little guys pull ahead! the character flaw guy gets more normal, the unpopular kid makes some friends, etc. then everyone couples off, and lives happily ever after.  right. so that was the movie. it was fine, but i wouldn't have gone if everyone else wasn't really excited about it.  everyone in our (enormous) group managed to stay semi-quiet during the movie. it was actually other people in the theatre making noise this time. in general, i don't mind if people talk a little during movies (i know i tend to) but danny got kind of upset... i thought he was going to slap them.  then i stayed over at alex's house with colette. we all were in one little bed, so we had to sleep on our sides. but i slept ok, if not for long. we went to bed at approximately 1:30. that's late for me. and we got up at 9. ew. so i drank some nice coffee and woke up. and now i'm blogging.  i've also started reading  urlLink roderick at random , a very funny sci-fi satire. it's just the sort of book i've been looking for. it's strange i never bothered to read anything of john sladek's before, because my parents were friends with him, but i wasn't very old when he died.  his memorial service, as i recall, was rather long, and for twelve year old me, boring. i guess i knew he wrote sci-fi, but i thought it wouldn't be to my tastes. it is. extraordinarily so.

      well, this is an overdue post, but may i draw your attention to my new online user counter and total user counters? aren't they spiffy?  tonight i'm going to see dodgeball, which will hopefully exceed my low expectations of it. i didn't want to go, but i do need to say goodbye to everyone. ::sniff:: i think my month at camp will mostly flash by, but you can never tell.   i need to start sleeping, or something. i've been having trouble with words.  a few examples: using "with" instead of "will," "talk" instead of "take," or, the ultimate example, "not," instead of "for."  wtf? these are words with different spellings and different meanings. what causes my brain to mess them up?  as another note, i touch type. so what is that is breaking all the conections in my head that tell me what to type? sleep deprivation is all i can think.  i know this post is the second in a row with a perfectionist word oriented theme, but it's really bothering/confusing me.

      i began watching "neverwhere" today. and it's perfect. ::sighs:: perfect. the bbc apparently make it a few years ago, and now it's out on dvd. i'd been waiting since the end of first semester to get it, and it finally came in at the library.   and now, for something completely different!  words i'm trying not to overuse: "yeah" (also, variations such as: "yah," "yeh," yeap," and "yea") "like" (in a "she was like, no way!" sense) "lol" (especially when i'm not laughing) "..." (not a word, but still, i use it a lot. yay for ellipsis) look for the new improved amelia 4.2, without word repetition coming to a place near you soon!

      went to the orthodontist today. afterwards i was in so much pain i got really faint, and then i was nauseous for about an hour.  my mood was considerably dampened by that. luckily i have analgesics and spanish pop music to make me happy.  so that's all. i'm still in pain, even if it's kinda masked, so i really have nothing to say

      summer is officially my favourite! i had an awesome weekend jam-packed with tons of stuff. and boy, was it nice not to do any homework.  a quick recap: i saw west side story (FINALLY) and it was good, if kinda fifties-esque.  i saw pirates of penzance. it was marvelous. take the show we did at school, paint it candy colors, add queen victoria, a trap door, a thrust stage and acrobatic pirates. that's the guthrie show. i was droolingly jealous. i spent some nice hours in spanish mercados, looking for books and music i can take to camp with me (no english allowed!). mostly, i failed. i saw saved, which was good, if religious. macaulay culkin took some getting used to as the handicapped kid, as did jena malone as a... well, see the movie. i also recommend the dangerous lives of alter boys, where i like her part better.  i started reading  urlLink deprivers , which is a good book so far. i recommend it.

      ok... i'm sad it had to come to this, but i'm harboring some resentment for the mac right now.  not that it isn't a great computer. it is. marvelous. but it's having this issue where it hates pcs. microsoft is an evil corporation, but that doesn't mean my computer has to drop me out of chats on IM with pc users, does it? i mean, maybe i don't like abercrombie, but do i run away from conversations with people who wear af stuff? no. well, not for the most part.  i suppose i should stop using AIM and switch permanently to iChat, but i really like having a profile.

Callaway, MN 56521  so far, (today) i've listened to music, talked on IM, and started re-reading the lovely bones. i can't decide if i like it or hate it, so i'm reading it. sexy, huh?

      i just finished putting my english "visual vocab" up on my wall. oblivion. i quite like it, and well i should, i spent enough time working on it. it's a nice word, and i'm always going to have that picture in my head when i say it.  it's also my wish for the day, coincidentally. being able to forget things i don't want to remember. wouldn't that be nice?  i went to see 50 first dates when it came out (a chick flick, i know) and i keep thinking that maybe it wouldn't be so bad not to have a memory of the previous day. just a few golden moments in your head to keep you going.  the problem is, not everyone has a adam sandler to wake them up every day and help them get used to the world again.  what would be ideal relates to eternal sunshine of the spotless mind (obviously this whole memory thing is a  urlLink meme ). i don't think i'd erase people. but there are events i could do without, certainly.

      today was an awesome day. it also happened to be the last day of design camp, so that was sad but not really. we got to do our final presentations and i got to wear my fairy dress (aka a three dollar ragstock nightgown...). i also had fairy wings. yay. this little girl was scared of me though... i think she believed i was a fairy. so that was fun & cute. my teacher, luke told me i made an awesome fairy, and my other teacher, danny told me i was gorgeous. lol he speaks very little english.  then i got to use public transportation to get home! yeah! while i was waiting for the bus (still wearing the whole dress etc.) i got to watch people's reactions to me dressed up a couple of months early for halloween. i got a lot of double takes. so that was fun.  i like costumes. and i've been dared to wear the dress to homecoming. with the wings. we'll see.  in a not so fun note, i'm going to ask everyone to please sign up for an id through blogger. i really am not a fan of the anonymous comments, so please, do it for me. thanks.

      what a trying day. i got up oh so early in the morning (7:15!!!!) and had to shower and eat and everything really fast, like i was going to school. but i wasn't going to school, i was going to DESIGN CAMP!!!!! [heavy metal music plays in background]  a series of unfortunate events followed, most of which i will not go into. in fact, i don't think i will go into any of them. just know that i will spend the rest of the week designing my identity as a sprite. (as in a small magical personage, not a lemon lime soft drink) my review of fahrenheit 911 is up, although it's posted a couple of days ago. not sure how that happened. sorry.

      some uncollected thoughts from the day. i'm still ill and therefore feel like crap. alex's party was last night, and that was fun but oh so loud. before the party started suzy and i got lost and alex's mom got worried because we just dissapeared. (sorry!) um... the words kat, xu and nu exist, the word xo doesn't, and neither does pim. (sorry brendan, i guess i'm a cheater) today, i had the unique experience of recieveing a snail mail answer to my email. strange... but cool.  i saw fahrenheit 911. yay for michael moore. it was good, in a scary way. i'm writing a review, to be posted tomorrow. excited, aren't you?

      so. my review of fahrenheit 911: i loved the subject. it was awesome that michael morre had the guts to stand up and say what he believed in, even with all the people it was likely to upset. unlike the dixie chicks, moore didn't back down after denouncing bush. way to go. i liked the links he used, visually and... i don't know the word but... audioally.  like when government officials (don't remember exactly who) were talking about how acurately and 'humanely' they aimed the bombs, and moore coupled that with pictures of bombs hitting homes of innocent people and them screaming at running around bleeding. i liked that war carnage was shown in a tactful manner, not just blood and guts to make you vomit. yes, we got to see many dead and dying people, from both "sides" of the war on iraq (not with, on. remember that.) but the injuries that were shown were added to the movie to prove something or illustrate a point. people die in wars.  but i wasn't fond of the way moore made some of his points. did reading the patriot act out of an ice cream truck change any policy? did any senate members decide that the act was wrongfully passed? i think not.  when asked if they would send their sons or daughters to iraq, did any representatives think twice about the war in iraq and it's consequences? not likely.  it was stunts like that which downgraded a great movie to a 'good' one. i doubt this will happen, but just think what the gop could do with footage like that. it could be used to portray the democrats in a very negative light.  what if a radical right director makes a movie like this? obviously there is nothing like a phony reason for a huge war haunting the democrats, but some people make mistakes that a movie could be based on ::cough clinton cough:: moore would become just another point in that movie.  the one thing i think the movie taught me was that we definitely need to get someone OTHER than bush into office this time around. sadly, the "other" is going to have to be kerry, who isn't awesome but is oh so much better than bush. so 'rock the vote', everyone who can, k? promise? no acidentally voting green or anything. next election, sure, but no messing around with third parties when we need to get that goon out of office.  that's all.

      today was a nice lazy day. haven't had one of those for a while, and boy did it feel nice.  i watched lots of nice daytime tv & finally saw cops. appearently everyone in the world has seen cops, even if they don't own a television set or know what one is. so that milestone is out of the way.  i also spent lots of time on the internet reading blogs and taking random purity tests. my favorite is the  urlLink virgin purity test , cuz i got a 37%.  haha i feel dirty. i also spent lots of time on the phone with alex and danny. maybe colette, but i think that was yesterday. a thorough waste of a good day!!

      well, i'm back from a month of spanish camp and i love english so much. love love love. ::dances:: i love english. i kind of hated camp too... so that makes being home even better. reasons why camp sucked: lots of learning, bad food, horrible dean, lack of english, sick people and people in general.  reasons why camp rocked: this kid (gollum) wore a raincoat for like a week instead of a shirt. i love you gollum!!!!  my roomates/hallmates (girls in the next room) rocked. my councilors rocked. my teacher rocked. learning all 16 tenses in spanish was awesome. i'm having an issue trying to think of other things that rocked but maybe later. a short episode to illistrate what camp was like:  [background: we've just been served a bowl of ground "meat" floating in grease, some uncooked bread, a bowl of refried beans, and a plate of sliced cheese. i'm not eating. i decide i want some chips, as does the rest of my table. i go to kitchen.] me: could i have some chips and maybe some salsa, please? woman: that's not what we're eating tonight. head cook man: why? me: because i'm not eating and i'd like some. hcm: why aren't you eating? me: i don't like the food, and i'd eat the beans if there was something to go with them. hcm: you should put some on bread, maybe with some cheese. me: a bread-cheese-bean sandwich. hcm: yes, it's very good, you need to try it. [pause] me: i can't eat cheese. hcm: well i can't eat chips. [we stare at each other for a few seconds, then he silently walks away and gets me some chips.]  i think it was only awesome cuz i was there, but after that i was friends with the head cook man.  BTW: this is my 100th post. woot!

      today was an accomplish-a-lot day. i started off the morning cleaning my room. i have now donated (::sniff::) the remains of my pen-pal bin. i must explain.  when i was 8 or 9 i really wanted friends. here i was, a crazy extroverted homeschooler trapped in a world where i couldn't meet people (don't worry, as i got older i got into all the cool homeschooler groups and stuff, that's where i know all my homeschool buddies from. but at this point i knew nothing of such groups).  homeschool magazines know what kids want, and so they would typically have a pseudo personal-ad page where you could send an ad. someday i'll dig up one of mine and we'll see what it sounds like. anyway, you'd write that you liked horses and christian rock music, that you were 8 and wanted pen-pals between 7 and 15 (yeah right). a couple weeks later, your mailbox would be full with letters from people who thought you sounded keen.  mostly, i hated the people that wrote to me. either they were dumb, or they liked god a little too much or something. but there were a couple that i'd reply to and we'd correspond for a few months. i always got bored of writing letters about my life (which was sad) and my pets (of which i had none) so i'd stop writing, and eventually my "friend" would stop too.  but this bin. because of the volume of mail you got right after the ad, you needed supplies to correctly reply to everyone (it was polite to send a letter to everyone who sent you one, dictated my mother). so i put together this box. it had stamps, and return address stickers (sent to me by the american lung society) and stationary, and matching envelopes, and my infamous sticker collection.  i don't know how long i collected stickers for, but it was a while. when i sent a letter, it would be sealed closed with a sticker (a few if i really liked the person) that related to what i'd written about. i had stickers for all the months, for birthdays, for holidays, for hobbies, and a huge volume of lisa frank merchandise that i tried to use in copious amounts to get rid of. it never worked. up until today i had a 12 by 6 by 2 inch box full (and i mean full) of the stuff. i swear it multiplies asexually.  when i got bored of the whole pen-pal scene, or when i got some real friends, one of the two, i stuck this box into the corner of my room. when i needed a bedside table, i put a piece of cloth over the top of it, and it became my bedside table. yesterday, i went through the whole box, recycled my records of where everyone lived and what their birthday was, and donated the rest of the stuff. i hope someone else likes it.... so that was an accomplishment in itself.  my next accomplishment was that i started reading "the crucible" by arthur miller. woot summer homework. i may finish yet.  then i surfed the web. by chance, i went back to  urlLink audioscrobbler  and they're open for signing up! go! now! download the plugin! be happy!  my last "accomplishment" of the day was that i went to see the movie riding giants at the lagoon. it was awesome. there are no word for watching people surf 70 foot waves. seven stories high. omg.  (in case you don't know, i'm a surfer fanatic. fanatic.)  my dad somehow got tickets to the preview of the movie. every now and then he gets these tickets and we go to some random, usually art-like film. the last one was i capture the castle. (did it slip under your radar screen when it was in theaters? rent it.)   so that was my day. sorry it's so long, i guess i just had a lot to say.
