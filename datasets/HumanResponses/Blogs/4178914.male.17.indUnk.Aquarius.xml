       Alrighty, i think i have this bitch worked out, i think that if i use it in a fairly dumbed down state, i can get away with dealing with the signing in bullshit only like once or twice.  Anyway, i am gonna go for a trial run on this site, i have another journal thing going on over at a site called AnimeOnline.net under the screen name Jabroni, for those interested go ahead and go there and read some of the shit i write on that site, most of it is quite long... i get bored like that.  I am thinking i might go into long ones like that over here.  Well right now i am currently listening to some Zakk Wylde, this guy is an awesome musician, he used to be in Ozzy Osbourne's band, not Black Sabbath, but his other band.   But now he went off on his own and did a solo album called "Book of Shadows" and started another band called Black Lable Society, which is also an awesome band.  He's one of my favorite artists, he's quite talented.   Today has been fairly boring, not much to do but sit on my ass alone and watch TV, Movies, and/or my Computer Screen...  I guess it's nice to take a load off everynow and then, but i think i'd much rather be chillin with my friends, laughing it up.  I even found myself not enjoying Video Games recently, i would play Computer Games in a second, if my comp didn't shit out on me every now and then.   I have such a good peice of shit computer.  By that i mean it's hardly shit Hardware-wise, but it can't play games for shit due to some (i'm guessing) software problem.  I guess there also might be some problem with my Motherboard, some PIO shit and how it switches to that mode randomly.  Well  fuck you  motherboard, i just know it better not be my harddrive, because if it is i am gonna be pissed.  I fucking hate computers, they are the bane of human existance, and i also believe it will be the downfall of human civilization.   Stupid machines, we rely on them too much and they break down all the time,  ooh how i hate them.  It's getting late, and i still have some net surfing to do, gotta look at some new computer cases for the new computer i am about to build...

       Well this entry is a test more then anything else, so far this system has systematically fucked me over so i will be amazed if this even gets posted without the bitchy system trying to get me to sign in again... which i would have to do over and over again.  Oh don't get me wrong, i'll be able to post it'll just take me for ever to re-write what i write because the cookie system on this site is fucked more then a high school Prom Queen
