      Well, I started a blog on my new MySpace.com site, and now I'm starting a REAL blog.  With a real blog address and everything.  I don't have a cell phone, or an iPod, or even my own computer.  But that's no reason why I can't frolick in the mainstream and join the blog revolution.  

That and I'm bored.  And I wanted to post a comment on Stone Soup's blog (www.stonesoupkitchen.blogspot.com) but I couldn't do it without creating an account.....

Anyway, the Stone Soup post about the UnConvention Gala last night really did sum it up, and it inspired me!  We ARE always the life of the party.  Though I have to say, I was feeling a little less than cool about the party last night as I left.  Sure some people showed up, we made a little money, and everyone had a good time.  But MORE people could have showed up.  And, as usual it seems, no one I invited (none of MY friends) made it.  That made me feel kind of awful.....Leigh and I actually had a long conversation about this at the party - but I always make an effort to go to see friends' shows, or go to friends' benefits for various things.  And if I can't go, it's usually for a really good reason - like, I'm in a SHOW that night.  But the favor never seems to be returned.  I mean for goodness' sake, people can't "have other plans" ALL the time!

Phew!  There.  I vented, AND I started a blog.  All in a day's work.

      SATURDAY

- hung out with Charles and his Mom, Teresa in the city.  Tried to get free tix to Much Ado at the Delacorte and failed.  Had breakfast at Jackson Hole.  Went to the Empire State Building and even endured the "Skyride" portion of the experience....

- met up with Merle at her mother's house, where she gave me her old computer!  I FINALLY HAVE A COMPUTER OF MY VERY OWN! It's not hooked up yet, but it will be soon...

- Trial of God rehearsal...worked on the end of the play.  Harrowing moments.  Crying all around at Hannah in the next to last scene...

- met up with Charles and Teresa again at Central Park to try for waiting list tickets for Much Ado.  No dice.  Took them to Ground Zero.  Walked in the Village.  Had dinner at Panchito's.  Charles told me he was gay when Teresa went to the bathroom.  And while he'd been very quiet and to himself all day that day, from the moment we had a secret together, he was much more chatty and cheerful.  :)

- my dad had called, called him back when I got home.  After a short conversation, he brought up Charles and said "he seems a little....a little..."  He couldn't even bring himself to say the word "gay."  I let him struggle with it, though I knew what he was getting at, because I wanted to force him to say the friggin' word.  Finally, he did, and he proceeded to go on and on about how Charles didn't help him with the mini-fridge we're giving him, but let his mother do it, and that was probably why, etc, etc.  My dad pisses me off sometimes!  I will never understand his view of gay people.  What pisses me off most is that my dad has a really good heart, and I know how caring he can be - then he'll say some ignorant crap like someone not helping to lift heavy objects because they're gay, and I'll go off on him!  Argh!

SUNDAY

- sang my last masses as leader of song at St. Boniface! :(  The end of an era...(I'd been singing there since I was about 12, but can't do it anymore because the commute from Astoria was killing me!)  I missed the 10 o'clock mass entirely, because of the subway - but I sang the 11:30 and the 1PM.  

- raced back into Manhattan for another Trial of God rehearsal....finally blocked the end of the play!  Have a great moment with Ben as Sam for my big monologue!  I'm very excited about it!  

- actually got home in time to watch Six Feet Under....they should have called this one "The Homosexual Episode" as it was all about David's being psycho and promiscuous now...while Claire was exploring her non-existant lesbian side with Mena Suvari - the whole Fisher family is just SAD at the moment.  Not to mention friggin' Frederico!  Sheesh!  I WISH Vanessa would've kicked that bitch's ass...!

Anyway, that's all for now....Later.

      Today signalled the beginning of great things to come as far as the "Fashion Your Future" Kerry Village event! I'm so excited now! A. met these two women last night who were at a volunteer gathering at the Kerry Campaign headquarters. Both work (or have worked) for Calvin Klein, and one of them, Anna, has ALL these contacts in the fashion industry....Three of which she gave me to e-mail today - the VP of Marketing at CK, the head of NEXT Models, and this Italian countess who knows practically every designer all over the world, and can pull favors from people. By next week, this event will really be taking off! AND, we got a donated t-shirt from Donna Murphy today. We're having celebrities donate autographed t-shirts to give to people who donate $250 for a VIP ticket.


Merle decided that we should close early today - and thank God! I'd forgotten how boring this job can be. Especially in the summer! But I wouldn't work anywhere else. Merle has been too cool to me, and the situation is too cushy to give up. Anyway, so I'm typing this in the office with no one else here...


I was so happy about yesterday's "Trial of God" rehearsal! And it was one in which my character has to do the LEAST...I play Maria, and we rehearsed the section of the play where the characters decide to put God on trial, search for a defense attorney for God, find one, and start their "opening arguments." Maria pretty much just has to sit there....but I was trying to stay focused and react from where I was sitting, and I was really happy when our director, Nadine, commented that she noticed that I was engaged the whole time. It was one of those moments that really makes me feel like an "Actor." Also, I was so bowled over by my castmate, Marsha, who's playing Hannah. I had worked with her in "Just the Front" previously, and since those characters were NOT as taxing as the ones in this play, I never saw her REALLY act....but when she worked on the scene last night, she blew me away! She went up in my estimation about a billion points! The whole CAST is ridiculously talented, and I just feel so lucky that I have yet to work with people who are either awful to be around or talentless. This "Trial of God" cast is golden.


We have to be OFF-BOOK by Monday....not sure how I'm going to pull THAT off, but I'm going to have to....

      Got information about a screenplay contest that Bravo is having through the fabulous Tisch Alumni listserve...the only thing that really makes the money I spent on NYU worth it.

It's for a reality show they're doing called "Situation: Comedy" - and Sean Hayes is a producer!  They're looking for a 1/2 hr sitcom pilot.  Everyone from semi-finalist on up will be documented in a 10 part reality series chronicling the ins and outs of writing for a TV show.  The author of the winning script gets $25,000 and one-year representation with CAA.  AND you get to pitch the show to several networks....


I think I'm going to enter!  I've had an idea for a show called "By the Book" in my head for a long time now, and I've started several versions of a pilot, but never finished it.  Now I have my excuse.  I think it would be a perfect HBO-type show....but we'll see.   I'll let you know how that progresses....

      Today is just all about rockin' the Democratic support....not only am I going to a series of "Unconventional Readings" going on at Cooper Union tonight (being put on by the PEN/Faulkner people) which will be rife with political pronouncements, but I'm wearing my newly-acquired, Che inspired "Start A Revolution" John Kerry shirt, too.  Not to mention the fact that I just got my copy of "The Future Dictionary of America" - a dictionary edited by Jonathan Safran Foer, Nicole Krauss, and Dave Eggers (it's actually more than a dictionary as it includes artwork and essays) - proceeds of which go to progressive organizations who are working toward getting Kerry elected this year. 



Last night's Leadership meeting went better than expected.  My only concern is that A. is really jittery about my not being further along with the Fashion event...I tried explaining to him that everyone responds with yeas or nays on participation at the last minute, and that seemed to appease him for a while, but...I don't know.  Also felt a bit strange walking to the train with him afterward....we left L. and proceeded to the N train.   He was really tired, and he said "I was looking at your shoulder and thinking how soft and comfortable it looks, and I'd love to just lean on it."  Which is really an innocent comment, but weirded me out slightly, because I was wearing a tank top...oh, I don't know!  But we're going ahead with Kerry Village merchandising, we've got SO many volunteers coming to us every day....things are looking up!


If we don't win this election, I'm going to cry.  Then move to Dublin.



And on another note - I miss Jean-Luc.  He's out of town for a few weeks....e-mailed him today about something I read that made me smile.  Wonder if it will make him smile...

      Believe it or not, there ARE other things going on in my life that have nothing to DO with my feelings about Jean-Luc! (Though none make me feel as alive....but I digress)

I'm still in the office (at Merle's) as I write this, but I'm off to a Kerry Village leadership meeting at 7PM. I'm dreading it...as you may or may not know, I'm the "Fundraising Director" of Kerry Village, and I've taken it upon myself to organize several fundraising events for the Kerry/Edwards Victory Fund in September - namely, a Fashion Show at Crobar, and a Drama event, possibly at the Flea Theater. As of right now, only two designers (Halston, Kenneth Cole) have agreed to donate outfits to the show. As for the drama event, we only have 2 out of a possible 4 playwrights confirmed. Meanwhile, I'm starting to get lethargic about all this political work. I just don't feel like it anymore - I blew my wad about a month ago....but now I'm responsible for so much that I CAN'T back out. Too many people are counting on me to make things happen - and all I want to do is go to sleep! So I'm dreading this meeting, because I'm waiting for A, the KV leader, and L, head of the Swing States subcommittee, to call me on what an incompetent, underqualified fraud I am....

Things on the acting front are going much better. Trial of God rehearsals are going VERY well. I love working with these people! We have to be off book by next week, though, and that has me a little nervous. But I'll make it happen. I'm so excited for The Unconvention! ( urlLink www.theunconvention.org ) I also got a callback for a 3-act one-woman play called "Becoming Adele" (aka: Weight on the Roof). I auditioned for this last week, and after I did my monologue and read the sides I was given, the playwright, who was running the audition (and the playwright should NEVER be allowed to run the audition unless it's Neil LaBute, and he's also directing) says. "Thank you! Here are the sides for the callback...you should be hearing from me in a few weeks...I like you a lot. You didn't blow me away, but I like you."  WHAT?!!!! (So apparently, I have to "blow him away" at the callback. Anyone got a Glock? Anyone?) Anyway, the callback is on Thursday, the 5th. Wish me luck!  Well, I have to head out to that meeting. More tomorrow...

      I like to think of myself as a strong woman - someone who is confident and comfortable with who she is, who knows where she wants to go in life, who most CERTAINLY doesn't need a boyfriend to be a complete human being....

It's amazing how all of that goes right out the window when you're interested in someone.  I was watching Def Poetry Jam last week, and one of the poets (Nikki - something....I forget her name) wrote a poem that captured EXACTLY what I'm feeling right now - it went something like (and I'm completely paraphrasing): "The angry feminist inside is getting all mad at me/'cause I wanna be his GIRL/I wanna be called his GIRL/I want him to say 'That's my GIRL'/'Nah, I can't hang tonight, I'm hangin' with my GIRL..."

So....I want to be a certain person's girl.  A certain person whose name I won't mention, because in this age of Advanced Google Searches, no one is safe.  But he's all I can think about - to the point that a majority of my days recently have been spent Advanced Googling him....didn't I say no one was safe? :)  He's incredibly smart, sweet, insightful, interesting, and insanely attractive.  I love talking with him, I love being around him...

I'm in severe crush mode, and I don't know what to do about it.  I'm not exactly the "mamasita" my Puerto Rican heritage would have you believe me to be.  I'm awful at flirting, and terrible around men I find attractive.  Well, not terrible.  For example, this certain guy and I (let's call him "Jean-Luc") talk all the time, and he seems to enjoy spending time with me.  Slowly but surely, though, I feel myself falling into the "friend zone."  I'm awful about "taking it to the next level."  The thing of it is, Jean-Luc's really shy too.  Between the two of us, we won't be hooking up until retirement!  Eileen and Joanna gave me all sorts of ideas  on how to plant the idea that I'm interested into his head, but it's hard for me to implement them.....

It's the "fat" thing.  There's no two ways about it.  And I've had both guy and girl friends tell me not to worry about it - that I'm not that big, that I'm big in all the right places, that I'm still sexy, etc, etc.  But I can't believe it - not deep down.  And if I don't believe it, how can I get Jean-Luc to believe it. 

There's one thing I'm hanging my hopes on....we actually had a conversation once, where he said that guys don't really care when a girl wears makeup or jewelry, or what have you.  That they would much rather a girl be herself.  I hope that's true.  Jean-Luc seems like the kind of person who would find a myriad of things beautiful for different reasons.  I hope I'm one of them.  I hope that he sees beyond my body AND my insecurity - because both are in my way right now, and I think I need him to reach over the wall and pull me out.
