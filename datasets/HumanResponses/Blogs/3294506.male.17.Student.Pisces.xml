      I wish I could be the person who is favored by all.  The one that people go to when they need something.  But staying "neutral" is hard to do, I need to find the secret to this mystery.  I'm type A, will I ever be satisfied?

      When will it stop?  Why can't things just go the way I wish they could.  I'm bitching and moaning again like a fucktard and just need to either choose to be consumed by this bullshit or just move the fuck on.  I blame myself for everything, there is no one else to blame.  Freewill fucks me up.

       Welcome to my first rant on this blog, enjoy.  Don't worry, I'll try to keep this one somewhat clean.   There are two things that irritate me me about school.  One being the  urlLink lack of motivated teachers  and two being the lack of discipline in the classroom.  Let's focus on my second irritation; the lack of discipline in the classroom.   urlLink CNN.com  published a very relevant article today exploring the results of a survey took of teachers and parents to find the root cause of  the uncontrollable classroom .   Most teachers in middle and high schools say misbehavior by a handful of children is such a disruptive, pervasive force that a majority of students suffer for it, a study released Tuesday said.  urlLink  CNN.com article    Extremely true.  All a classroom needs is one student who is unmotivated to begin cracking side jokes to his buddies or throwing paper air planes around.  Kids will be kids, and as one starts to have fun, others will join in.  Almost a mob mentality...   More than three in four teachers said they could do their job more effectively if not for discipline problems...  urlLink  CNN.com article    This I find comical.  There are some teachers who without a doubt can control a classroom.  Their reputation and interactions with the students can earn them respect, which students will show in the classroom.  An implied intimidation can be easily cast by how the teacher presents themselves.  However, new teachers (not always the case, but usually) are more likely to let these trouble makers continue as a result of bogus law suits being filed.     The challenge, the study said, is otherwise complicated: education colleges don't prepare teachers to deal with rowdy students; children in special education are treated too lightly even when their misbehavior has nothing to do with their disabilities; schools back down from discipline when  parents threaten lawsuits .  urlLink  CNN.com article    Wasn't it only about twenty years ago when it was still okay for teachers to hit kids in class as punishment?  If I'm not mistaken, most parents agreed with this type of authoritative action.  Where did we loose this effective punishment?  The loss of granting teachers to use physical action to keep kids in control is (in my opinion of course) the main cause of the increase of disruption in the classroom and loss of respect for the authority that teachers hold.  The appeasement method schools are trying to use now, is only hurting the education of the students.  The solution to the problem... restore the right to let teachers use physical control on their disruptive students and bring back parents who support this use of action.   Yes this leads into a bigger issue of society's morals, values, and code of conduct, yet if there isn't a more authoritative approach used quickly in our Nations' classrooms, then I'd like to be the first to say that generations to come will respect authority less.
