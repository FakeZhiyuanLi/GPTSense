      well..whats had gotten into me?..for no reason i was quite frustrated by the surrounding atmosphere...some of the chinese  O level`s answer was revealed...and i could only get 25/35..perphap i was frustrated over this matter...because my aim was to get a2 or a1 and i putted in a lot of effort and my expectation for this paper was high...and yet 25/35 pull down my moral..sigh....everything could onli depend on my listening comprehension and oral examination....                      frustrated today!!!!
