      Bits and pieces today.  First, Helly, this is for you.  The New Yorker likes to put humorous misprints from other publications at the ends of articles, like little verbal cartoons.  Here's one:  WE DON'T WANT TO HEAR ABOUT IT DEPT.   From the West Hartford (Conn.) Life.    Volleyball games at Solair attract many campers and nudists who mingle courtside when not playing.  Women have the option of wearing sports bras while playing so as to avoid potential eye injuries.   Lachele, here's a tidbit from the Lewis Thomas book:   There was, by all the evidence, a common language spoken by the Celts throughout Britain and Ireland, using words and grammar similar to those spoken in Iran and India, and many of these resemble toa startling degree the elements of today's perfect English.  Indeed, Eire and Iran, for all their different populations, are cognate names, taken from the same ancestral tongue, along with Aryan.   There's been a lot on the news about  urlLink Ms. Kathy Cox's proposal  to omit the controversial word evolution from Georgia textbooks.  My immediate reaction is to cringe with embarrassment, just like my hero  urlLink Jimmy Carter .  It pains me that my state's school board chooses to pander to its most conservative element, who have an association with the word evolution that even  urlLink Darwin rejected  - that is, the development of  lower  life forms into  higher  ones.  (My spouse pointed out that bit to me.) It made me think of a recent visit with some cousins.  I was riding in a car with an 8-year-old kin who said to me, "I know what I  don't  want to be when I grow up and that's a scientist.  That's because scientists believe in fiction.  They believe in evolution."  Eight years old.  On the other hand, as I understand the proposal, it's only to change the word (to  biological changes over time ), not omit the science itself.  In that case, I'm not sure there's anything really to fear from the proposal - it might have a similar effect to the change in usage from  Negro  to  African American  - changing times need changing words.

      I just spent an exhausting hour at the girl gym.  I ended up getting an extra cardio workout because Extreme Makeover was on one of the televisions and I just had to know how they turned out.  One of the women had a look very similar to  urlLink Ileana Douglas , a charming and attractive, if not model-style pretty actress.  But she felt so badly about herself that it was almost a handicap. She got cheek implants, a chin implant, eye surgery, a nose job, and the de rigeur breast augmentation.  I'm not a regular viewer of this show by any means, but on the rare occasions I've seen it, all the women, always, get boob jobs.  The other woman was sad because she looked older than her husband, who was in fact, 10 years her junior.  So she got a face lift, a nose job, and, of course, breast implants.  Looking in the mirror as I was sweatily lifting my 8 pound bar bells, I couldn't help but imagine myself as a candidate for a makeover and mentally listed all the parts of me that I'd like to redesign.  I succumb to the fantasy, every now and then, of that unattainable level of beauty.  But rather than squander my retirement savings on a plastic surgeon out of the pages of Creative Loafing, I just took a moment to bask in a sense of gratitude to my spouse, my family, and my friends, who seem to like me well enough despite my cosmetic flaws.  Thanks, guys.  Unlike my friends and family, though, I am extremely shallow and care only about the physical appearance of others, so here is my top ten unordered list of beautiful faces that I could find, just now, on the internet:   urlLink Janine Turner   urlLink Oded Fehr    urlLink Michelle Yeoh    urlLink Moira Kelly    urlLink Jason Scott Lee   urlLink Keanu Reeves  - I know, I know.  urlLink Geena Davis    urlLink Audrey Hepburn     urlLink Matthew McConaughey   urlLink Ralph Fiennes

      My friend Helly, formerly known here as conservative republican H, has initiated her blog - see the link to the right.  I'm sure it will be very entertaining, as she has a flair for humor.  Check it out dear readers, all three of you.  In Rachel Reichl's book, I found a whole chapter about one of my very favorite movie stars ever,  urlLink Danny Kaye .  Not only a talented actor and musician, he was also an excellent gourmet chef whose kitchen was known to some as the best restaurant in Los Angeles.  She described his elaborate kitchen as a theatre with a dining table set so that everone eating faced the kitchen.  He barked commands at his guests, like "Sit down!" and "Eat this now!"  He created dishes and served, but rarely ate.  He didn't seem quite as gentle as his characters usually were.  But quite the Renaissance man.  Okay, answers to yesterday's quiz:  Cola is from West African Temne  kola , a genus of tree. Mammoth is from Russian  mammot' , that real big extinct animal. Monsoon is from Dutch  monssoen , trade wind of the Indian Ocean. Yogurt is from Turkish  yogurt  with a silent g. Sofa is from Arabic  suffah , bench. Loaf as a verb is purported to be from German  Landlaufer ,or land loper, but the OED finds the etymology improbable.  Verdict is from Old French  voirdire  to say the truth. Typhoon is from Chinese  tai fung , a great wind. Tycoon is from Japanese  tai kun , great lord or prince Boondocks is from Philippino Tagalog  bundok , mountains.   I have to add: in browsing the "recenlty published blogs" on blogger's homepage, I'm surprised by how many have a  urlLink Christian  theme and how many are in  urlLink Portuguese .  Every time I reload, honestly, another Portuguese language site pops up.  The web is crawing with them.

      My section of the building has been without heat now for three and a half weeks.  The motor needed a part, it had to be ordered.  I know these things take time, but it was in the 20s this morning!  Not only are my students and I scrounging for space every morning, and I'm carrying all my stuff in a box, I have no place to sit down, write complainy emails to friends, or play ten or eleven games of free cell in a row.  How am I supposed to get any work done?  While my students were reading their novels in class today, I went in to the next teacher's room to borrow reading material for myself.  I grabbed  urlLink The Reading Teacher's Book of Lists .  That was a surprisingly fun read!  Can you match the following words to their geographic area or language of origin (the list wasn't consistent)?  I knew none of these.  Words: cola, mammoth, monsoon, yogurt, sofa, loaf, verdict, typhoon, tycoon, boondocks  Origins: Africa, Arabic, French, German, Russian, Turkish, Chinese, Philippino, Japanese, Dutch  Answers in tomorrow's post.  I was going to increase my participation in  urlLink Blogger Idol  by listing my top five blogs of other participants, but I just haven't had time to read through enough of them.  But of the ones I read, there were a couple that I liked:  urlLink  What in Tarnation  seems to be written by a teacher.  I liked his/her? observations of how we disguise from children their total lack of freedom.  I also liked this girl's  urlLink extremely personal  blog.

       Freedom. . .   First of all, I wanna play  urlLink Blogger Idol !  It's not a game, it's just a thing people are doing, making blog entries on a set topic each week, and linking them for others to read.  Why not?  The topic this week is  urlLink freedom .  Lewis Thomas, whom I vaguely recall from college as the biologist who wrote  urlLink Lives of a Cell , also wrote an even better book about words,  urlLink Et Cetera Et Cetera .  He begins one chapter with the Sanskrit word  priyate , meaning to love someone, and the related form  priya , which meant dear or beloved.  This root in Old English became  freond , ancestor of  friend  and  freo , ancestor of  free .   urlLink The Concise Oxford Dictionary of English Etymology  gives the following as the first definition of free: "not in bondage or subject to control from outside."  It also gives the Old English verb  freogan  with two definitions: to love and to set free.  (The  -dom  of freedom is an Old English noun suffix that means simply "the state of being  adj ."  The embedding of love in the concept of freedom is deep and rather subtle.  A love  for  freedom seems to be part of the U.S. national identity, symbolized for many by  urlLink this document .  I suspect the word "love" doesn't appear there even once.  Freedom as an act of love is better represented by that poster that was on the wall of my third grade classroom, the one that said, "If you love something, set it free.  If it comes back to you, it's yours, and if it doesn't, then it never was."  The Bible, too, notes in the oft-quoted-at-weddings  urlLink Corinthians 13  that "love is not jealous."  So, not only is the meaning of  love  embedded in the word  free , the meaning of  freedom  is, by association, embedded in the word love (which has such etymological kith as  leave  and  believe , but that's another story.)  The two words are joined in the phrase " urlLink free love ," hailed by such great minds as Bertrand Russell as the ultimate and logical flowering of those etymological seeds.  Some  urlLink polyamorists  would no doubt agree.  And even if you don't, it seems that the great moral lesson of this etymology is that freedom, however we define it, is what we give to those we love.  There.  On a personal note, I came across an  urlLink abacus ,and I'm learning to use it!

      Yesterday my old tennis shoes made a tiny blister on my instep when I was on the treadmill, so today, I splurged on new tennis shoes - okay, I think they're called cross trainers - and now, after a treadmill session at the girl gym, I have a blister the size of a quarter on each heel.  I wonder if the store will take them back, after I walked through rain and mud to get to my car?  When I got back home, the power was out and the house was lit with candles.  As I ate a cold dinner by candlelight, I noticed how quiet the house was, how much noise electricity contributes - like the hum of the refrigerator, the drone of the fan, and of course, the perpetual noise of the tv.  It was so quiet that I could hear the baby sucking on his pacifier in the next room - it was the only sound.  I'm reading a wonderful book that one of my coworkers shoved into my hands when we were at the library on Friday.  It's called  urlLink Comfort Me With Apples  by Rachel Reichl.  She's a food critic and the book is a memoir that reads like a novel, with recipes thrown in.  At the beginning, it's 1978, and she's living in a communal house in Berkeley with her husband and a handful of other people who subsist on brown rice and tofu and  urlLink eschew  (etymologically related to both  scare  and  shy ) materialism.  When she gets her first job as a food critic for a magazine, every single person she knows disapproves.  It seems so exhausting and joyless to be that politically correct.

      I went to the girl gym today and got on a treadmill in the room with the tvs.  One of the tvs was showing horseracing, which struck me as an odd choice for a girl gym.  The other tv was more predictably on Lifetime.  Then I thought maybe the galloping hooves of the horses were meant to encourage my own lazy feet.  I tried to think of  urlLink Seabiscuit  as I hung in there for the last fifteen minutes.  I spent the earlier part of the afternoon looking for the perfect dining room chairs to replace the scary almost-broken ones we're sitting in now.  I may have found them at a little antique store.  They're all I want in a dining chair - they're small and unassuming, yet well-made, straight-backed, cushioned just enough.  They're English chairs from maybe the 1920s, the guy said.  Their unique feature that I suppose places them in their historical context is that the two back legs are straight and the two front legs are carved ornately.  urlLink This  isn't the chair, but the legs are similar.   On Friday, my class went to the library, and I indulged myself in an armload of books that I won't have time to read.  But it feels so good to have them, just all the possibility they represent.  Not long ago I heard a report on the problem of  urlLink hoarding  among the elderly.  There was an example given of a woman who could never pass a newstand without buying a magazine or paper, nor could she ever throw one away.  She said she would look at the array of reading material and feel sure that somewhere in all of that was the piece of information that would change her life.  I could sympathize with her.

      How smart am I? Well, I'm not going to gloat by telling you my scores because you'll probably just email me with better scores than mine.  I was the smartest on  urlLink this test , pretty damn smart on  urlLink this test , but probably not even eligible for the death penalty on  urlLink this test .  That's because it was timed, and I spent about five out of my ten minutes trying to fold a cube in my head.  And then look at it from different angles.  I need a Tylenol.  But I'm not letting that last one get me down because I subscribe to a more comprehensive  urlLink theory of intelligence .  Rather than a grueling timed test, I can take  urlLink a simple quiz  which reveals to me that, in my own opinion, I excel in verbal/linguistic intelligence and suck at spacial intelligence.  And that's  urlLink OKAY .  As a language teacher, I sometimes work with students who don't have particularly high verbal intelligence.  Or who have not been able to develop that intelligence to its fullest.  And sometimes, they're the most interesting ones to teach.  This morning I was working with a Korean student whose English vocabulary far exceeds her literacy.  I had her reading out loud for me so I could help her with the novel we're studying.  For the most part, she was decoding phonetically, laboriously sounding out words.  But every now and then she would get to a word that was clearly stored by meaning and she would say a synonym.  For instance, she got to the word  tell  and read  say .  For  looked  she read  saw .  I spent our computer lab time perusing the internet for someone else's observation of mixed decoding strategies, and I didn't find what I wanted, but I did find  urlLink this really great website  devoted to learning and brain science.  Click on Library for all the articles.

      We'd been planning the baby shower for weeks and the present was in the trunk of my car, thank god, but I was at my desk, typing away at 7:30, when it suddenly dawned on me, Baby Shower!! I had to rush to Kroger to get food, paper products, and a gift bag - what a great trend in gift-giving the gift bag is.  I was back with minutes to spare.  The shower was a success - it started with silly  urlLink games , continued with excellent food which other people had actually cooked, including  urlLink pozole  and gorditas and, mmmmm,  urlLink flan , and finished up nicely with gifts and an interesting advice session for the mom-to-be.  There were about five blankets among the gifts, each of them applauded.  For a Hispanic mom, a baby just can't be too warm!  The uniquely Hispanic custom of draping a baby head to toe, face covered, with a blanket, still triggers my claustrophobia. I decided today that I really love the custom of showers, even though I haven't always been enthusiastic about attending them in the past.  But it is such a great way for a group to give significant help to one of its members.  And even though I don't normally consider myself a joiner, I am fond of the groups I'm a member of.  Oh, the advice. . . the only one that wasn't obvious to me was a suggestion to wear a girdle for a few weeks after the birth to flatten the belly.  Could there be anything to it?  And would it work now??? Because that sounds way easier than diet and exercise.  Etymological tidbit for the day:  urlLink Walnut ,  urlLink Welsh , and  urlLink Walloon .  They all start with a form of  wealh , meaning foreign - to English/Germanic speakers.  So, foreign nuts and foreign Celts.

      The more I think about Big Fish, especially the ending, the more I like it.  It has a lot to say about the value of story in our lives, as a means of making sense of things.  I had a quiet lunch hour at Zaxby's (I can't eat enough chicken wings right now) and I managed to read an entire article in the New Yorker, about  urlLink cryogenics,  or rather about the architect who is working on a design for fortress that would hold a cryogenics company and all of its frozen clients intact for at least a hundred years - which presents an interesting challenge.

      There's something special about the number ten - I guess because we have a base ten number system, it feels whole and complete.  So, if you make a top ten list, you've really said all you need to say.  Of course,  urlLink David Letterman  popularized the format way back in the 80s, when I could always stay up late enough to watch his show.  But other folks make lists on all kinds of topics, and they especially turn up at the end of a year.  For instance, there's the top ten  urlLink conspiracy theories  of 2002, the top ten  urlLink words  of 2003, the ten  urlLink best movies  of 2003, and even a list of top ten  urlLink earthquakes .  The theme of my own top ten list (you knew it was coming) was swiped completely from Emily Colas's funny and delightful book about about OCD, called  urlLink Just Checking .  Her list was "Things I Learned From My Husband."  And here is mine:  The Top 10 Things I've Learned From My Husband.  10.  You don't have to eat vegetables to stay alive. 9. You can't dissolve sugar in iced tea - you have to dissolve it in warm water first. 8. Dogs will love you more if you're strict with them. 7. Park a stick shift in gear. 6. Married men don't have to do any Christmas shopping. 5. You get what you pay for. 4. Sometimes it's better not to talk about your feelings. 3. The Pixies were a good band. 2. Other people are thinking more about themselves than about me. 1. Lefty-loosey, righty-tighty.  We saw  urlLink Big Fish  today, and it was a happy surprise.  I think it's the most entertaining Tim Burton movie I've seen since Beetlejuice.

      I admire people who have a well-articulated politcal position.  I'm continuously working on mine - the articulation part, at least.  (As an  urlLink INFJ , I always know exactly where I stand emotionally!) Talking with my intelligent friends, like libertarians S. and L., and conservative republican H - you initials know who you are - is a good exercise.  And fortunately, there are quizzes on the internet to help me out as well.    For instance, according to  urlLink Neil Boortz's quiz , I'm not a  urlLink Libertarian , but rather a  urlLink Left Liberal .  Actually, I'm only 90% Left Liberal, so I am slightly to the right of Al Franken.  urlLink  The Political Compass  rated me to the left on the economic scale and also more anarchist than fascist.  I landed in the same grid as Gandhi, actually.  My political stereotype is Democrat, according to  urlLink quizilla's quiz .  If I lived in  urlLink Politopia , Jesse Jackson, Ralph Nader, and Hillary Clinton would be my neighbors. I wonder if Hillary would invite me over for tea and cookies.  I haven't had much time for reading or movie-watching lately, although I just opened a really fascinating book on the culture of Paleolithic people, called  urlLink The Lost Civilizations of the Stone Age  by Richard Rudgley.  The writer offers some evidence that Stone Age folks had developed a language ( urlLink Proto-Nostratic ) and a writing system.  More on that later.  And tomorrow we're going to see Big Fish, even though I still haven't forgiven Tim Burton for  urlLink The Nightmare Before Christmas .    With a few exceptions, I really dislike a musical.

      One of the neat things I've found about learning a foreign language is that words become souvenirs of people and experiences.  So many of my everyday words in Spanish are tied to the person or context where I learned them.  For instance, if I hear the word  urlLink  albanil  , I think of my friend L's father telling me the story of the time he took a job as a carpenter in another city and the girl he got involved with there.  The word  urlLink  cerro   recalls my visit to the basilica of the Virgin of Guadalupe, and a really tranquil cemetery at the top of a hill.   urlLink  Dano   makes me think of my first experience translating at the battered women's shelter.  I had to look that word up in the dictionary, but I heard it so many times after that, I knew it ever since.  And I remember the girl who was talking and her story. . . So many words evoke a flash of memory.  Of course, it doesn't happen much in English.  I learned my everyday vocabulary way too long ago in too short a time span. (And how amazing is  urlLink that ?) The words I acquire as an adult usually occur too infrequently for me to remember an association.  But recently J. taught me the word  urlLink contrail .  We have an airport here, so planes fly around a lot.  On a clear day I usually look up at the sky at least once, and say "Contrail." And think of J.  And I'll think of K. whenever I watch Buffy the Vampire Slayer, since she watched it with us for most of seven seasons.  We sadly bid her farewell tonight as she moves to a colder climate and starts a job search.

      My roasted veggies tonight were enhanced with a smoky flavor when the oven caught fire.  It was so much less trouble than setting up the grill, too.  Although my spouse went to a good deal of trouble putting out the fire and scraping out the char while I lay on the couch getting drooled on by the baby.  I keep watching for signs that the baby might be  urlLink an Indigo child . One  characteristic is:  They come into the world with a feeling of royalty (and often act like it).   Yes, my five-month-old expects me to wait on him hand and foot, as if he's entitled to the service.  Also:  They simply will not do certain things; for example, waiting in line is difficult for them.  I can already see the signs of impatience in him, when his bottle isn't ready or he's been ignored for more than five minutes.  He may grow up really different from normal children, who happily wait in lines for hours at a time.  These  urlLink new children  are really special - some of them even refuse to do homework.    I'll have to buy a book, to see what discipline methods work with such a child.  I don't believe in spanking, except between two consenting adults.  On to today's fun with etymology. Guess which of these three words are etymologically related:  urlLink galaxy ,  urlLink lactate , and  urlLink lettuce .  Give up?  All three of them!  They come from the Greek, Latin and Old French words for  milk .  So,  the Milky Way galaxy  is kind of redundant.  The newest descendent, according to  urlLink Wordspy  is  lactivist , a person who strongly advocates breastfeeding.  Breastfeeding an infant can be a wonderful experience, but a lactivist can be tiresome.

      I spent all day counting to myself because I just had to know if I take   urlLink as many steps a day as an Amish person.    And I don't!  I estimated 2600 between 7:30 and 3:30 today, and honestly, I'm not planning to add a whole lot more.  Guess I can't eat all the potatoes and cake I want after all.  It must be  urlLink nice to be Amish !  My favorite documentary to date may be   urlLink Devil's Playground , about the  Rumspringa  - when Amish kids turn sixteen and get their first taste of the English world.  Apparently,  it tastes like Jack Daniels with a beer back.  And puke.  But even though the DVD box made it look like an "Amish Girls Gone Wild on Spring Break" sort of thing, it's really a respectful, funny, and absolutely fascinating film.

      I've been reading a lot of Mother Goose lately - what an eclectic assortment of rhymes! Some are  urlLink epic,  some  urlLink romantic,  some  urlLink inscrutable,  and some amusingly  urlLink gay .   urlLink My favorite , though not in the original edition, cashes in a surprising fifty cent word.  What a great thing to be familiar with the word "erroneously" before entering the first grade.  One of the magazine people came to the door tonight.  He was good - it was like a private show.  He'd been off drugs for seven years, his gold teeth were in the car because they'd been scaring people, he knew I wanted an opportunity to make a difference in a child's life.  Etc.  Recalling  urlLink Office Space , I couldn't help but wonder if he was an unemployed computer programmer, but I didn't ask.  I was actually willing to buy a magazine, but when I asked about Utne Reader or maybe Harper's, he steered me toward Cosmopolitan instead, since that one was on his list.  I figure I've already taken enough  urlLink sex quizzes  in my lifetime that I really don't need that magazine.  So then, I thought, maybe something fitness-related, but he got impatient because he had to go, and suggested that he could take a $10 donation.  So I gave him $10.  To help poor inner city children learn to ride horses, or something like that.  Even if it just goes in his pocket, he has my sympathy for having one of the worst jobs I can think of.

      I was out walking tonight and kept stumbling over stuff because I couldn't take my eyes off  urlLink the night sky .  The stars were so bright and big, it seemed like they were falling on us, very fast, but from very, very far away.  Maybe it was my imagination, but Betelgeuse looked kind of yellow.  Or  urlLink maybe not .   More fun with etymology:  Before the holidays I had my students reading a bit of  urlLink The Best Christmas Pageant Ever  and I asked them if they knew what the manger was.  They didn't and I was about to tell them it meant the barn or stable - that's what I always thought it meant - but some deeper force sent me to the dictionary instead.  And turns out it's a trough, the thing the horses eat out of.  And of course, that was a big "duh!" moment for me because I majored in French, back in the day, and  manger  is the French word for eat.  An interesting thing is that the word  urlLink mange , the skin disease, or an eating (itching) at the skin, is also related to that Old French ancestor  mangier .

      Most of the evening I've been involved in food, chopping vegetables into bite size pieces for a soup.  It's a very meditative act.  Someone should really write  urlLink a song about it .  While I was cooking, Smallville was on tv.  I haven't seen it before so maybe I'm missing some information that would keep this from being funny.  Anyway, the young Lex Luther was talking to some guy about some conflict he had with another guy "a long time ago, back in Metropolis."  And I'm thinking, aren't you like 18 years old?  So, a long time ago, weren't you a very small child?   My happiest moment of the day, aside from all the moments that I received smiles from my little son, was finding the Chocolate Mocha Crunch flavored Atkins bars at Kroger again.  The South Beach diet is the new thing, and Dr. Phil's book, but as far as I can tell, they're all just slightly different versions  urlLink low-carbing .    My favorite recent neologism of the day:  shouting head  n. A loud and aggressive person, particularly one who is a television pundit or commentator. —adj.  Thanks,  urlLink Wordspy !

      I took the baby to visit L's family today. It's a much happier household without her husband, who has finally gone back to Mexico and is living in the house I visited. When she told me that, I realized sadly that I'll never visit that house again.  Her kids are so good with the baby.  I talked to the oldest, who graduates high school this year, about her plans for college.  She and her counsellor are trying to find a place that will accept her despite her undocumented status.  Then they'll have to look for money.  She's an intelligent, hardworking young woman with the potential to do a lot of good with her life.  If her education stops here,  urlLink it's not just her loss .  When people around me comment that illegal immigrants shouldn't be served by a government-funded program (like the one I work for) because they don't pay taxes, I'm usually too tongue-tied to remind them, "Of course, they pay taxes!"  It amazes me the image people have of the "illegal alien."  For one thing, if they're working with fake papers, like most of the people I know, they get the same deductions from their paychecks that I do.  And on top of that, there's sales tax.  They buy cars and gas and groceries and CDs and stuff - if I should doubt it, I would only have to spend five minutes in Walmart, looking around at my fellow consumers.  Ted Conover wrote one of my favorite non-fiction books called  urlLink Coyote .  He's a journalist who crossed the Mexican/U.S. border several times in the company of men who were seeking labor, and he worked with some of them in an orchard, picking oranges.  One of the most touching comments he made was about the contrast between the two contexts of the men's lives.  At home, in Mexico, they were fathers, husbands, and heros to the young boys.  In the U.S., they were anonymous, unwelcome, and without value.

      Insult to injury - not only are we without heat for a couple of weeks, today's rain revealed a leaking roof that dripped on to my computer all day while we were elsewhere.  A maintenance guy came by to see it and commented that a lot of schools in the district have leaking roofs.  Schools are getting grants for technology in education and such, but  urlLink first we need shelter .  At least I come home to a warm, dry house, unlike people who live in abandonned subway tunnels.  We watched a documentary last night called  urlLink Dark Days . Apparently, if you're homeless, tunnel-dwelling is one of your safer and more comfortable options.  Except for the lack of running water and a preponderance of rats.  The  stories were sad and in some cases shocking.  It certainly showed the homeless as a much less homogeneous group than other representations.  They didn't all have drug addictions, for instance.  Speaking of which, should I be saving up now for my son's rehab?  Nothing quiets him but spinning around and around in the desk chair, really fast.  He just smiles and smiles.  And he can also stare intently at his hand or foot for a long time, and the only people I've known to do that were stoners.

      Fun with etymology: the Spanish word  embarazada  (meaning "pregnant") and the English word  embarrassed  really are  urlLink cognates .  Thinking of bars and barriers, you can extrapolate both meanings with a little imagination.  In general, pregnancy wasn't too much of a barrier for me - maybe when it came to squeezing between parked cars or doing anything for more than fifteen minutes without going to the restroom.  Anyway, that had been bothering me - I'm so glad I finally looked it up.    Why does my classroom have no heat, now that it's 20 degrees?  Why will it take two weeks to get the heat repaired?      I like my local *bucks because they're so friendly.  I think some people would just as soon not be smiled at and called by name so early in the morning, but I appreciate it.  However, they are less likely than other coffee shops to have free reading material, like other people's newspapers, lying around - I guess they promote neatness as well as friendliness.  So today, empty-handed, I went to Espresso Royale instead and enjoyed a  urlLink Flagpole .  Those who cling to the belief that we have a liberal media can find evidence of it here, at least.

      I determined to devote myself to cooking this morning.  I put a chicken in the crockpot to stew and decided to make a broccoli soup with the liquid.  Then, at the coffee shop, I was paging through this week's New Yorker, and found a short story called Broccoli, about broccoli.  Or, about a woman's fresh vegetable fantasies, contrasting with her bad marriage and Russian despair.  It was written by Lara Vapnyar, who has a story I can link to  urlLink here .  There was also an extremely depressing article about journalism in Saudi Arabia, where the obscenely wealthy and corrupt rulers look benevolent and wise compared with the scary religious police.  The article made reference to  urlLink this sad event .  Saudi reporters made it news, but apparently justice was never done.  On the bright side, we had a Mardi Gras party at work today.  A co-worker from Louisiana brought kings' cakes and beads (or "throws," we learned they're really called by those who should know.)  Los Mexicanos recognized the cake  as  urlLink  la rosca de los reyes  .  But nobody found the baby inside - it remains a mystery.

      I've been avoiding fiction because I don't want to find a story that makes even the vaguest reference to the death of a child, but of course, non-fiction is just as bad.  I was reading  urlLink Lost World  by Tom Koppel and he talked about a paleolithic skeleton that belonged to a small child - and even that choked me up!  It's really terrifying, this parental love.  It helps to remind myself that in the U.S.,  urlLink 993 babies out of 1000  make it to the age of one, and a higher percentage of those to the age of four.   Aside from the child bones, Tom's book is a surprisingly entertaining read about scientific investigation into the Bering Strait theory - the idea that Asian people walked across a land bridge into Alaska and down a corridor between glaciers to populate the rest of the Americas.  There's actually very little evidence for that.  Tom hangs around with archeologists who explore caves on the northwest coast for evidence that people actually came by boat and settled the coast - long, long before the  urlLink Vikings.   His descriptions of crawling uphill through narrow, lightless tunnels make me shudder.  Spelunkers!  Today I took some baby stuff over to C's apartment.  She's getting more stuff than she can actually use, but fortunately a couple of relatives are each pregnant with twins.  Her pregnancy has taken away her sleep, and she looked exhausted, but lovely nonetheless.  She looks very Asian, a descendant of those paleolithic migrants.

      After two weeks of vacation, hanging out with my spouse and my little son, tomorrow I go back to the world of other people.  Actually I've been quite involved in other people's lives through reading.  I'm off fiction for the moment and just finished the next best thing, an oral history of women in the Vietnam War called  urlLink In The Combat Zone .  I was moved by the stories of these women who did so much for so little credit.  Most of them chose to go from a spirit of adventure that I could really identify with, and they committed themselves to supporting the soldiers, if not the war itself.  It seemed that all of them found themselves in the role of caretaker, regardless of their job title, and it seemed sad that no one was really taking care of them.  As non-combatants, they often didn't find much support from  veteran's organizations when they came home either.  Remember  urlLink China Beach , the homecoming episode, when she tried to go to a veteran's support group and they thought she was a wife?  I miss that show.  I have to get up at 6:00 in the morning to drop the baby (who is wisely sound asleep) off at Grandma's before I go to work.  I hope my palm pilot alarm wakes me up in the morning.

      My fondness for coffee shops was born in 1988 at Espresso Roma on  urlLink 13th Street  in Eugene, Oregon.  I can still smell the heady mix of bitter coffee and cigarette smoke that wafted on to the street from the open door.  The closest thing my suburban hometown had to such a place was the 24 hour Dunkin Donuts.  And I'm sure there wasn't an espresso machine anywhere near the town of Statesboro during my college years.  They probably have a Starbucks now, just like everywhere else.  But in the late '80s, the coffee shop was a delightful novelty to me and represented a degree of sophistication my lifestyle had previously lacked.  So I spent hours and hours in Espresso Roma, drinking cappuccinos and reading Charles Bukowski and Henry Miller, and feeling worldly.  My current lifestyle as a working parent who goes to bed by 10:00 even on weekends is surely the nadir of sophistication.  Nonetheless, I spend at least 20 minutes in a coffee shop every morning before I get to work - and I would be late to work rather than miss even one of those minutes.  My reading material is usually some form of local news, presented in small pieces, demanding a minimum of concentration, so my brain can work out my lesson plans in a partly subconscious sort of way.    When I first moved to Athens, there was just one coffee shop, Figaro's, but thirteen years later, there are many - eleven, in fact, that I can think of offhand, and that's probably not all.  I love the fact that I live in a small town with locally owned businesses, and there's a real pleasure in walking into a place knowing that I'm having a unique experience, that the store doesn't have clones of itself on city blocks all over the world.  So I support my local coffee shops with my business, but not exclusively.    I didn't plan on patronizing Starbuck's when they moved in right next door to a locally owned establishment, but in the end, I'm too self-indulgent to deny myself much, so I gave it a try.  I've kept going back for three reasons: the excessive friendliness of the staff, which I actually enjoy; the fact that my cappuccino never, ever tastes funny; and the light.  I know plenty of people who are happy to live like vampires, constantly adjusting their sunglasses, reading in a dark corner, through half-shut eyes.  Crazy.  And some of my local coffeeshops favor this clientele with dark walls and tiny, low-wattage lights that hang over a table here and there.  But in Starbuck's, I never get eyestrain.    But as I said, I vary my custom.  Other coffee shops play more interesting music.  In other coffeeshops, orders aren't likely to be quite as  urlLink fussy .  Other coffee shops have a wider variety of customer, whereas the Starbuck's crowd, when I go, seems fairly consistently frattish and businessy.  Other coffee shops might have dogs in them.  Most importantly, other coffee shops have other people's newspapers waiting for me in heaps and piles.  I don't know why Starbuck's seems to discourage that friendly and generous practice.  This network isn't running very well, so I'll add links tomorrow. urlLink

      Two different people told me interesting things about words.  My Spanish coworker, who also reads his etymological dictionary for entertainment, told me about the word  asesina , or  urlLink  assassin   in English.  Like many Spanish words, it's a borrowing from Arabic, in this case "hashishi" (hashish-takers).  My friend's dictionary suggested that murderers were given hashish in order to help them commit their crimes dispassionately and without fear.  Webster's Word Histories tells a story of a "murderous Ismaili sect in Syria, a sect that was part of the Shiite branch of Islam."  Stories claim members were held in thrall by drug-induced visions of Paradise, but Webster doubts the validity and does not know the reason this sect became known as hashish-takers.    Earlier that same day, I was talking with Starbucks Dan, who is moving up the corporate ladder.  He talked a little about business-speak.  "Allignment" is a buzzword now, edging "synergy" out of the limelight, I guess.  But when Dan attains a position of "real power" - his eyes gleamed - he plans to introduce the word  urlLink "syzygy"  and spread it like a virus throughout corporate culture.  And what an excellent word it is - from Greek "suzugia," meaning "conjunction" (and related to the word "yoke" as well), it now means an allignment of celestial bodies.  I think it will make a handy metaphor, yielding other tongue-twisting forms, such as "syzygistic," or "unsyzygistically".  Thank goodness it's already a noun, thus no chance of forming the rather distasteful possibility "syzygism."    Since I complained about it so much, I'd better mention that as of last week, my heat was fixed, so I've been back in my classroom after months of wandering.

      I've never been a big fan of reality tv, but I saw one the other night called  urlLink The Littlest Groom , which I thought would finally prove interesting and original.  It featured a dwarf, or little person, as the chooser, and he chose among a bunch of women, most of whom were also dwarves.  Or little people.  I guess the big drama at the end was whether he would select a tall chick or a dwarf chick as his girlfriend, and he went with the dwarf.  But to my disappointment, they were just as uninteresting as the people on all the other reality tv shows, once I got over their  urlLink intriguing stature . (Scroll down a bit for my favorite X-Files quote.)  Without the talent of a visionary documentarist and really exceptional subjects, tv programs should feature exclusively made up people, in my opinion.  Although it took three days of starting over and falling asleep, I made it through  urlLink Live From Baghdad  on the weekend.  I was a bit disappointed because I was hoping for an updated version of  urlLink The Killing Fields , or my all time favorite,  urlLink The Year of Living Dangerously , but it fell far short of those examples of foreign correspondant drama.  It had neither political commentary nor conscience.  But, for what it was, it was pretty entertaining.

      In a small effort to put my money where I mouth is, I've spent the baby's nap time searching for human rights organizations that target abuses against women.  I chose the  urlLink Afghan Women's Mission  because I'd read about them recently, and because their  urlLink donations page  gave me the feeling that my money would go to good use. (I chose the hospital, though it was a tough choice.)  Next month when I do this, though, I'll start closer to home, with  urlLink Project Safe  or my own school.  Naptime has rather suddenly transitioned into bottletime, which will be followed by a pleasant post-prandial constitutional.

       Oh, the things I know!   The mnemonic device for the seven deadly sins is  waspleg :  Wrath Avarice Sloth Pride Lust Envy Gluttony  The racial slur "gook" probably came from Korean "Hanguk," meaning "Korean."  The cry for help "May Day" is French "M'aidez" which means, "Help me."  Japanese people read Gone With The Wind and find it reasonable enough that Ashley would marry a cousin, especially back in the day.  Koreans read it and find that fact a gross perversion of nature.  In Korea, people who can be proven to share an ancestor many generations back can't get married.  Korean and Mexican women have in common that they don't take their husband's last name after marriage.  Still today, some Koreans eat dog meat.  However, I've been assured that the animals raised and slaughtered for this meat are both ugly and stupid.  Cute dogs, like the  urlLink Chindo Gae , are kept as pets.

      There seems to be a trend among certain white males of sexually idealizing the Asian female.  So, guys, next time you're in a bar and want to come on to a hot Asian babe, be careful with your pickup lines.  What you say might not be what she hears, according to the   urlLink babelfish  trick that Helly mentioned in her blog.  The trick is back translation: take a phrase in English, translate it into another language, and translate the translation back into English.  For instance,  If you say to a Japanese chick, "Hey baby, come here often?" she might understand instead, "Does the just a little baby come here frequently?"  If you try Joe Dirt's witty favorite, "If I said you have a beautiful body, would you hold it against me?" with a Chinese girl, she may give you a puzzled look, having heard, "If I said you have a happy body, you can take it to oppose me?"  If you try a direct approach to a Korean babe, asking, "Wanna come back to my place for a drink?" she might be dumbfounded by the abstract opacity of, "The beverage it comes to, hazard my place Sip u ten:00 bedspreads?"  However, if that same girl says to you, "Me so horny, love you all night long," don't get your hopes up.  What she really means is, "B like this hard love your nighttime atlas."

      Three months ago the heating unit at my end of the building broke down and, although the ordered parts finally arrived a couple of weeks ago, they  still  haven't been installed.  And it's 35 degrees this morning.  Fahrenheit. My boss and uber-boss have been very kind about expressing concern and sympathy.  However, I'm beginning to think that that concern might be better expressed with an  urlLink expensive gift .  Just yesterday, I was rhetorically asking my colleagues, where are the liberal Christians?  The only ones with a public voice seem to be the  urlLink really conservative kind .  One of my colleagues offered up the  urlLink Unitarians .  And Unitarians are as liberal as anyone could ask for, but they're not Christians.  In fact, the ones I know at least are better defined by their punchline, "atheists with kids."  This morning in Flagpole I read an  urlLink interview  with an interesting and intellectual Christian, AI professor Michael Covington.  I don't know how he votes, but I bet he's not a  urlLink ditto-head , at least.  The whole political liberal/conservative thing muddies the waters of organized religion a bit for me.  Fortunately, there's a website that can point me in the right direction with a handy  urlLink Belief-O-Matic quiz !

      Yesterday I watched the movie  urlLink Real Women Have Curves .  There's a scene in it where this handful of women who work in a clothing factory strip down to show off their cellulite and stretch marks and celebrate the beauty of female fat.  It was a nice scene and I liked the message that one's sense of self-worth should not be dictated by trend or fashion in appearance.  Maybe the superthin supermodel image is beginning to die out, as an ideal anyway.  I couldn't help but notice in my last two classes (kickboxing and bellydancing) at the girl gym, the instructors had generous rolls of fat between their sports bras and spandex shorts.  Of course, I applauded them for being proud of their bodies, which were in truly excellent condition.  But I felt discouraged realizing that my only purpose in taking the classes was to get rid of similar roll of fat on self.  Actually, I like classes of any kind because I like learning.  As a teacher of adults, I like being an  urlLink adult learner  as well, to prove it's possible, that the brain doesn't fossilize at 19 or 25 or after you have kids or. . . ever!  I started learning Spanish at 33, and do all right with it now.  Maybe ten years ago, I learned to ride a bike with gears and rode it all over my city for a long time.   I learned how to play a pretty simple electric bass when I was in a band awhile back.  I learned the rudiments of taekwondo a couple of years ago, which made the kickboxing class pretty easy.   I learned how to add, subtract, and multiply on an abacus quite recently.  I've taken classes in yoga, tai chi chih, creative writing, and various computer programs.  Now I'm learning, daily, how to be a parent.  Here's some things I'd like to learn or study in the future:  Sewing on a machine. Knitting. Aikido. How to swim really well, with lower risk of drowning. Counselling/psychology/social work. Another musical instrument, like the violin, or more than simple chords on the guitar. Painting. Meditation.  urlLink The Chinese language.   This week's New Yorker had a fascinating article about Chinese.  The writer, Peter Hessler, tried to track down the story of Chen Mengjia, a specialist on  urlLink oracle bones , which hold the earliest record of written language in East Asia.  He published several books, but he spoke out against Chairman Mao's plan to replace the Chinese characters with an alphabet, and lost his life for that.  Apparently, the conflict is an old one and the written language is in a constant state of reformation.  But I hope the old language survives, as it preserves so much history.  When the oracle bones, dating from maybe 1300 BC, were found, scholars were able to start translating them immediately because the written language hadn't changed all that much!  Also, it's such a delight to see my Chinese, Japanese, and Korean students communicate with each other by writing down a Chinese character or two.

      Happy Valentine's Day.  My gift was time to read and I managed to finish an entire book, an increasingly rare achievement these days.  It was called  urlLink Honor Lost: Love and Death in Modern Day Jordan, by Norma Khouri .  I've read too many books now about women in the Middle East that all tell the same depressing story of women who have no control over their own lives.  This one was the true story of an "honor crime" - a father killed his daughter because she had brought shame upon his house by being seen in the company of a non-Muslim man.  He wasn't punished.  The writer was the murder victim's best friend, and she recounted many, many such crimes that were never brought to trial or reported in the news.  Other depressing books about Middle Eastern women that I've read include the  urlLink Princess  trilogy, by Jean Sasson,  urlLink The Price of Honor  by Jan Goodwin,  urlLink Not Without My Daughter  by Betty Mahmoody, and, perhaps the most depressing of all because it dealt with child abuse and rape,  urlLink The Hidden Face of Eve , by Nawal Sa'dawi.  The attitudes against women seem so foreign and insane.  And yet, I've heard preachers here (like  urlLink this guy , whom I saw back in the late 80s at college!) talk about women leading men into sin.  That was the message that made my mom flee the Baptist Church of her childhood - she was tired of feeling evil all the time.  Random etymological amusement:  Did you know that the word  bowel  comes from Latin  botellus , meaning "little sausage"?  The meaning "intestine" came during the medieval Latin period "presumably because of the physical similarity between the two" ( urlLink Webster's Word Histories ).  But I would have thought intestines =  sausage casings. . . Anyway, a disease associated with badly preserved sausage became known as  botulism .  Last but not least, have you ever wondered why white people can't dance, why black people talk in movies, and whether size really matters?  You can find out everything you've ever wanted to know but were afraid to ask at this  urlLink politically incorrect website , which I ran across at  urlLink memepool , the best time-waster I know.

      I enjoy Sandy's movie lists so much, I have to make one of my own.  Here are ten of my favorite movies of all time.  I've probably forgotten something really great and obvious.  I'll do imdb links this time.  Where do these score on the Guy - Chick continuum, I wonder?  10.   urlLink The Fisher King  - a fable of love and loyalty with Jeff Bridges, a less-annoying-than-usual Robin Williams, the lovely Mercedes Rhuel, and a pre-Honey Bunny Amanda Plummer.  Bridges plays a famous radio personality who unintentionally provokes a mass murder in a downtown restaurant.  Unable to bear the guilt, he loses everything - job, apartment, classy girlfriend - and sinks into depression.  He meets a delusional homeless man with whom he has an unlikely and poignant connection.  The friendship between them leads to his redemption.    9.   urlLink Sweet and Lowdown  - it was a toss-up between this one and Radio Days, Woody Allen's other music movie.  But this one has Sean Penn, Samantha Morton, a rocking Django Rheinhardt soundtrack, and a perfect ending.  I love this movie.  8.   urlLink Back To School  - okay, there are better comedies, like Airplane and The Blues Brothers, but this silly Rodney Dangerfield venue makes me laugh every single time I see it, and I've seen it about 20 times.`  7.   urlLink Shall We Dance  - a delicate Japanese comedy with one of the funniest supporting characters in the little toupee-ed would-be Latin dancer.  It's cool and sweet and shows something lovely about Japanese culture.  6.  urlLink Raiders of the Lost Ark  - this movie just rules.  I've never seen anything so completely fun and exciting from beginning to end.  5.   urlLink Goodfellas  - does Ray Liotta wear eyeliner?? I love this movie, especially the scene of the fellas in jail making their gourmet Italian meal.  This movie, like Godfather, did a great job of portraying a culture that was about more than crime.  4.   urlLink God Said, Ha!  - Julia, please stop playing moms in teen movies - you're so much better than that!  In this movie Julia Sweeney is funny, charming, poignant, and very intelligent.    3.   urlLink Syd and Nancy  - my favorite romance, even though I don't usually like movies where I know somebody dies before the end. But the movie captured the fleeting, unstable beauty of their self-destructive love.  It was a great part for Chloe Webb, and my favorite role for Gary Oldman.  2.  urlLink Casablanca  - how could anyone not love a movie with so many quotable lines?  Among my favorites:   -Where were you last night? -I can't remember; it was too long ago.  -Will I see you tonight?? -I never make plans that far in advance.   How cool is that?    1.  urlLink The Year of Living Dangerously  - absolutely my favorite movie of all time.  It features my favorite fictional character, the tragic hero Billy Kwan (brilliantly portrayed by Linda Hunt), whose idealism finally destroys him.  The lesser protagonists were played by Mel Gibson and Sigourney Weaver at the peak of their attractiveness.  A theme of the story is the question of responsibility - for ourselves, our loved ones, and those in our path who suffer.  Some honorable mentions: Quiz Show, Rhustler's Rhapsody, The English Patient, Heavenly Creatures, The Lord of the Rings, The Blues Brothers, Airplane, Sixteen Candles, Hellraiser (only the first one), Aliens, The Abyss, The Marriage of Maria Braun, Trekkies, The Princess Bride. . . okay, I'm tired of thinking.

      I had really been looking forward to the Scottish movie  urlLink Sweet Sixteen , which Netflix described as a "heart-warming coming of age film."  Now I wonder if that reviewer actually saw the movie.  Because it's really about a boy whose life starts out awful and gets progressively worse until it's pretty much permanently ruined at the end, the day he turns 16.  Although I can't say I enjoyed the movie, it was a treat listening to the Scottish version of English.  It was almost completely unintelligible, except for the obscenities, but there were subtitles to clarify.  A couple of words stood out:  urlLink  wee  , which was used constantly, as in "wee man" or "you're a wee stupid cow" and  urlLink  wean  , the word for a small child.   According to the Concise Oxford Dictionary of English Etymology, the word  wee  originally meant "amount of," as in the phrase "a little wee thing" and is etymologically related to the word  weigh .   Wean , on the other hand, is an Old English word meaning "accustom," as in accustom to not having mother's milk, and is etymologically related to the word  wont , which may have already passed out of the spoken American vocabulary.  Does anyone say, "He put cream in his coffee, as he was wont to do"?  I don't think so.  So,  wean  for a small child must just be a Scottish analogy.  On that same page in the online dictionary, you can find entries for  weenie  and the 18th century neologism:  wegotism .  It means the excessive use of "we" in writing.

      Thanks to Blogger Idol, I've been enjoying a few other blogs, like  urlLink this one , from an apparently young woman who's raising seven kids, with a sense of humor.  The youngest, a baby, is named Echo.  What a great name.  If I had any sick days left (since maternity leave used them all up) I'd take a day off work and just cook.  I go in phases with cooking.  Sometimes I'm happy to come home and eat a bowl of cereal or hotdogs and cheese, and at other times, it seems worth the effort to prepare real food.  I have an obligation to make two pans of lasagne for a class party on Thursday, and I also have ingredients for a cauliflower soup (from Rachel Ray's  urlLink 30 Minute Meals ) and a shrimp curry.  If only my spouse  ("if it's green it's trouble, if it's fried, make it double") would eat a vegetable, I would enjoy sharing my cooking.  Fortunately, I can always share with my mom, who thinks I'm a great cook.  For which I'm grateful.  Last night, 60 minutes had a thing on Evangelical religion and its infiltration of politics.  The reporter identified George W. Bush as one of "theirs."  And they flashed back to a debate back during the 2000 Republican primaries, where W. was asked which political philosopher had influenced him the most.  He answered "Jesus Christ" because accepting Jesus Christ had "changed his heart."  I think what bothered me most was his refusal or inability to take an intellectual stab at the answer.  There's a lot to be  urlLink said  or  urlLink speculated  about Jesus's political philosophy, but all he did was make a statement of his religious belief, which drew wild applause from the crowd.  Making me think it was simply intended to do so.  I realize that was four years ago, but that's about how far behind I am on the news.  In an attempt to hurriedly catch up, I read the following  urlLink comparison of the Democratic candidates , which sways me to vote for Senator Edwards.   urlLink Isn't he cute?

      These evenings at the girl gym really give me a chance to catch up on popular television.  This evening, another girl and I watched Cops from the elliptical machines.  I don't think I'd ever seen more of this show than the theme song, but it's much more interesting than I thought it would be.  For instance, in one segment, a young officer who'd gotten his foot shot off in a hunting accident chased this guy (with two feet) for several blocks and caught him.  Isn't that impressive?  Also, there were two episodes that involved prostitutes, which were also impressive in a sad sort of way.  Since I'm more familiar with movie prostitutes, like Julia Roberts, than real ones, I just assumed that that profession might require a certain attention to appearance, such as maintaining a youthful skin tone and a full set of teeth, and bathing regularly.   But the ones on Cops weren't  urlLink that kind of prostitute .  I felt sorry for the hard life they seemed to have and didn't like to see the Cops bothering them so much.  On a lighter note, here's an unordered list of the funniest people in print, that I can think of offhand.   urlLink David Sedaris  - esp. Naked  urlLink Al Franken  - esp. Rush Limbaugh Is A Big Fat Idiot  urlLink Florence King  - esp. Confessions of a Failed Southern Lady  urlLink Fran Lebowitz  - esp. Metropolitan Life  urlLink Andisheh Nouraee  - two great columns in Creative Loafing  urlLink Helly Braxton-Hayes  - see her blog  urlLink Dave Barry  - esp. one column he wrote about traffic where he described a car as being "approximately one electron away from the car in front of him."

      I liked the green, but thought I'd try an easier to read look for awhile.  Recycled:  I made urlLink  a few Listmania lists  at amazon.com, but they never turn up when I search for one of my list items.I figure no one ever sees the one that I thought was kind of funny, so I'll post it here instead - minus the CD titles.

      I was reading an article in the New Yorker today about the food supplement industry, which the public has bought into so heavily despite its total lack of regulation and blatantly false advertising claims.  The article started off with the example of Zantrex-3, a diet pill popular among  urlLink pop idols  and GNC consumers alike.  And it was interesting to observe that one part of my brain was nodding in approval with the writer's criticisms, while another part was urging me, "Go to GNC now and buy that diet pill!"  I guess that was the same part of the brain that tells SUV drivers that tall and comfy cars must be  urlLink safe .  And legal uppers would be  so much easier and way more fun than diet and exercise.   But I had to laugh when the article mentioned another diet pill "cynically named"  urlLink Anorex !  Isn't that kind of like naming an erectile dysfunction medication Flasidex or Limpricol?  Anyway,  since I didn't feel like getting in my  urlLink safe and silver  Saturn and driving anywhere, I ignored the urgings of my  urlLink cerebral cortex  and had another low-carb yogurt instead.

      I lay beside the bassinett until the little person in it finally stopped thrashing about and settled into sleep.  When I sat up to look at him, he had thrown the back of his hand across his eyes, like a swooning lady in an old movie.    I had time in the computer lab with my class today, so while they worked among the links on  urlLink the blog I made for them , I killed time with online tests.    I started with  urlLink the gender test , which I'd taken some years before, and sure enough, to the surprise of my spouse and my ob-gyn, I'm (still) really a guy.    I went on to play with some good tests at  urlLink this site  - I liked the music one best.  My tastes are "reflective and complex," it told me.  There are quizzes to measure morality, the "big five" personality traits, one's degree of uniqueness . . . minutes and minutes of self-absorptive fun.    And just because I can, I'll type a line in violet.

       A DAY IN THE LIFE. . .   I hate to leave home, but I dearly love to travel.  You can see how I've resolved the dilemma thus far on the maps below.  I found the website, linked below, on  urlLink this guy's blog  while I was browsing the entries for  urlLink Blogger Idol Week Three .  So first, allow me to post my Blogger Idol Entry:  A day in the life of . . . a Greyhound passenger.  The jarring of your head against the window wakes you from your last thirty minutes of sleep.  Light tells you it's daytime, but it could be any time of day.  Interstate signs give you place names, too, but except for those, you could be anywhere in generic America.  What regional uniqueness remains in this country is not found on its interstates or highways lined with Barnes & Nobles and Appleby's. Your seatmate is asleep, which is just as well, you think, because now that youknow all the details of his drug addiction and failed marriages, you're not sure what else there is to talk about.  The fellow across the aisle, though, who's been drinking out of a paper bag since he boarded the bus some states ago, has plenty to say.  He has a book called "Meditations for Women of Color," which he considers the most brilliant book ever written.  He hands it to you, over your sleeping seat mate, insisting that you read it and give comments.  You curse yourself, again, for not investing in a Walkman before this trip.  You flip through the pages and hand it back politely.  Soon, his attention is drawn away - the woman in front of him is telling him to shut up and a loud argument ensues.  You close your eyes and hope for sleep, mentally humming, and for the first time understanding, The Ramone's classic "I Wanna Be Sedated."  Eventually, time passes and the bus pulls into a gas station/Taco Bell combo.  You disembark with the rest of the herd, jammed between bodies and shoved forward, but once you're out of the bus you're suddenly and rather surprisingly separate.  People go in different directions - to the bathrooms, to the restaurant, off to one side to smoke.  You walk away from them all and sit on a curb.  You look up and realize it's a beautiful day.  You're in a flat place of the world, so the sky above you is vast, open, bigger than you've ever seen a sky.  For a moment, you feel tiny and alone, cut adrift and floating in this anonymous place, where no one who knows your name could place you.  It's not a bad feeling, just an interesting one.  And it doesn't last because the driver returns, shooing everyone back on the bus.  You follow the smokers, the last one in.  You're happy to note that the man with the brown paper bag has not reboarded as the bus pulls away.  Your seatmate is now stretched out across the aisle, sleeping more seriously.  Another gentleman asks to take the place beside you.  He is a horse-trainer from Spain and he has stories.  They will pass the time.  These are states I've been in, mostly on a Greyhound bus if they're out of the southeast:      urlLink create your own visited states map   or  urlLink check out these Google Hacks.

      After years in hiatus, my music partner and I are playing music again.  We have a new bass player who is both very good and very cool.  We have a fifteen minute set at the next Hoot, a folk music shindig, on April 12, but most of our songs aren't very folky.  It's an all original set, too.  It was great to play some of the old songs again that I'd once gotten tired of.  I'd forgotten how good they were!  As much as I love music, I have trouble listening to it.  I miss the time of my life when listening to music was an activity to do all by itself, maybe accompanied only by the careful scrutiny of album liner notes.  I remember sitting in my bedroom for hours and playing records, nothing else.  Singing along, pondering the significance of the lyrics to my personal suffering, maybe.  But now music seems to take a background role in my life, unless I'm making it or it's in my head.  I can listen to music in the car, but the radio is a problem because I'm constantly changing channels to avoid music I don't like, and CDs require some dexterity and frequent changes as well.    Some songs that have been in my head recently:   urlLink Drink  by Jazz Butcher.  It's one of my favorite songs ever, and I thank my husband for it.  urlLink Oops, I Did It Again  a la Britney Spears.  Okay, not one of my favorite songs, but ever since I realized it swiped the melody from Barbara Streisands "A Woman In Love," I haven't been able to get it out of my head.  And, just like the original, it's kinda catchy.  urlLink Dime Que No  by Ricardo Arjona.  I was humming this one all afternoon at work.  I wonder if I heard it subconsciously because it's been some months since I heard it consciously.  I wish I could link to the music itself.    urlLink Dream Weaver  by Gary Wright.  This would be Helly's fault.  urlLink Black Dog  by Led Zeppelin.  I've had that in my head since about 1977.

      I just participated in a panel discussion on ESL education across age groups and institutions.  I learned some things.  Like a new abbreviation: ELL.  English Language Learner.  It's perfectly useful, but it just sounds strange since they weren't using it back in the 90s when I was more immersed in the jargon.  (Turn your back on a field for just a little while, and the acronyms crop up like mushrooms.)    And I learned about NCLB.  Two high school teachers were on the panel and their observations of the  urlLink effects of No Child Left Behind  on ELLs  horrified me.  I thought the whole Republican thing was about small government, but this legislation introduces a ponderous new layer of bureaucracy.  Also, it relies way too heavily on mass quantitative data on things like student performance and teaching quality.  How is teaching quality measured?  By level of education, type of certification, and performance on a content area test.  Not that those things aren't good, but they've already been proven not to correllate with teacher effectiveness measured by student performance.  And doesn't that just seem true at an intuitive level, that all the credentials in the world  don't  necessarily make someone a good teacher?  And there's no provision for English learners newly arrived in the country.  How can they get the desired scores on the standardized tests in only a few months time?  And why should schools - and students - be punished if they don't?  Kids have to pass a whole new slew of tests now just to graduate.  All  I  had to do was make more than a 65 in most of my classes.    I also learned what a  urlLink rubric  is.  It's a teacher's explicit criteria for student evaluation.  The word is from the Old French,  rubrique  (red ochre) because it meant "directions in religious services," which were usually written in red ink.  It's related to the word  ruby  , but not to  urlLink  Rubik's Cube   or  urlLink  Rubicon  .  The panel discussion was fun and I got to answer a lot of questions, although listening to some of the other panel members made me wish I were more articulate and confident-sounding.  Jackie, who organized it, said something I already knew but hadn't heard put into words, and it's pretty interesting.  It's about a cultural difference between Mexicans and Americans (meaning "middle class Americans").  Mexican parents see it as their job to prepare their child for school in terms of his behavior, but they have no responsibility for educating the child.  Schools are in charge of that and neither expect nor welcome parent involvement.  In fact, if you say a person is "bien educado" or lacks "educacion," you're talking about his politeness, not his schooling.  And politeness, in Mexico, involves not questioning authority.  So, they often miss the expectation here that parents will be involved with their children's schools and teach them at home.

      I'm thinking about candy today.  In fact, I just had a Cadbury Creme Egg (see #3 below).  I can't get away from candy - in stores, at work, in grimy little hands. . .  10.   urlLink Fruit Slices  9.  urlLink Raisinettes  8.  urlLink Milk Duds  7.  urlLink Caramel Squares  6.  urlLink Chocolate Raspberry Ice Cream  5.  urlLink Dulce de Leche  4.  urlLink Fudge  3.  urlLink Cadbury Creme Egg  2.  urlLink Berger Cookies  1.  urlLink Birthday Cake   An  urlLink ode to candy  from Flagpole, Halloween 2001.  Lemme quote that guy:  "Whatever amount of candy you normally buy for Halloween, double it. What's that going to set you back, 20 bucks tops? That won't send you spiraling into Chapter 11, and if we all do it, suddenly the retailers aren't lying awake at night bathed in cold sweat, choking on bile marinated in panic. Everybody skates into the crucial holiday gift buying season feeling jake."  If that ain't good writing.

      A nervous taxpayer was unhappily conversing with the IRS Tax auditor who had come to review his records. At one point the auditor exclaimed, "Mr. Carr, we feel it is a great privilege to be allowed to live and work in the USA. As a citizen you have an obligation to pay taxes, and we expect you to eagerly pay them with a smile."  "Thank goodness," returned Mr. Carr, with a giant grin on his face from ear to ear. "I thought you were going to want me to pay with cash."  Joke courtesy of  urlLink this page , for your IRS humor needs.  If I ever get a chance to vote for a national sales tax to replace the unwieldy and expensive  urlLink IRS , I'll do it, I swear.  Especially with fair and realistic rebates for low income families and senior citizens,  urlLink those most likely to lose  under the system.  Okay, I say that now, in the heat of the moment, as lots of people probably would in March and April.  But honestly, if I really were paying a higher percentage of my income in taxes than somebody making more than $200,000, I would probably be pretty unhappy about that, too.  Every year I marvel that normal people with average intelligence and organizational skills are expected to accurately fill out the 1040.  And now, thanks to Etrade and Vanguard and such, normal people who can't afford accountants and tax lawyers on retainer all by themselves do Schedule D.  I did a rough draft today for my spouse to check over.  I can't catch his mistakes, but he can catch mine.  Immediately upon looking at it, he caught an obvious one - I didn't put in the state taxes on Schedule A.  But I think no matter what, we'll get a sizeable refund this year, thanks to the baby - already earning his keep as a handy  urlLink tax credit .    Clark Howard has lots of  urlLink tax information   and  urlLink tips  at his site, along with the disturbing saga of  urlLink Justin , whose identity was stolen.

"I need every garbage can in the building right here, with liners." 7. "A chihuahua costs more than one thousand dollars!" 6. "I was going to major in journalism, but I wasn't aggressive enough." 5. "I have five sisters and six brothers." 4. "In Spain, they don't embalm people; they wrap them up like a mummy." 3. "My cousin's planning to have another baby and she's 45." 2. "Ooooooooooooooooooh oooooooooooooooooooooh"  and  1. "My husband had the mushrooms on his feet - no, I mean fungus."

       Bad Mood   Why do nursing homes have to smell that way?  It was a semi-traumatic experience visiting my cousin in a "long term care facility" this afternoon.  He was supposed to go to a rehab center, which sounds like a clean and vigorous sort of place, but I guess they didn't find a room for him in one of those.  The place he ended up was full of people sitting in wheelchairs in the hallway in varying stages of undress and catatonia.  The few people who spoke to me on my way in didn't make any sense.  One lady with her head down peered up at me and said, in a scolding tone, "What are you doing with that thing?"  I'm afraid of nursing homes.  When I was a child we used to visit my grandmother in one.  I would shrink away from all the hands that would reach out, fumbling, wanting to touch me.  Even today, I was sort of holding myself in.  I worry that my cousin won't get the rehab he needs and he won't be able to live alone again.  I worry that someday I'll have a bed in one of those hot, odorous institutions, that I'll be cared for by undereducated and underpaid nursing aides who will shout at me in a sing-song voice to be still while they change my diaper.   My boss, who is an angel, who is the perfect boss for me, announced the other day that she's most likely taking another, better job next year.  I saw it coming.  She's a gifted administrator with excellent people skills, a rare treasure, and a principal-ship only makes sense for her.  Still, I barely held back from prostrating myself at her feet and wailing, "Please don't leave me!!!!"  She's a big part of my job satisfaction.  Who else will be so good at making me feel valued and appreciated?  Rumor whispered the name of a semi-coworker who might be given the job.  This person currently runs an adjacent program.  When one of her employees calls in sick, she calls that person at home, to make sure they're REALLY sick.  When she gets mad, she yells.  If this person takes my boss's job, I will be revisiting an old ambition to work fulltime at a Dunkin Donuts or cofffee shop.  Too bad Starbucks Dan has moved too far up the corporate ladder to hire me.  I'm worried about other things, too, like  urlLink global warming , and  urlLink the proposed ban on gay marriage , and the squatters in  urlLink Sao Paolo  who may lose their homes, and  urlLink Tammy Faye Messner's lung cancer , just to name a few.

      I forgot to carry my Atkins bar for breakfast this morning, so I had no choice but to eat a chocolate croissant at Espresso Royale instead.  I found myself in line behind a person I often see in the mornings - a square-faced dark-haired man with a long ponytail.  I noticed today that he speaks with a vayree Frensh accent.  He is like me and goes from one place to another.  However, there are some people I only see in that coffee shop, such as the very elderly woman clad in leather and a cap who pores through large, heavy books.  I see her and think, that's me in 40 years.  If I'm lucky.  And I mean, lucky enough to afford leather!  With my double cappuccino and excellent chocolate croissant dripping with fat and oozing sugar, I enjoyed some light reading.  News of the Weird in  urlLink Creative Loafing  reported a  urlLink Case Western study on aging in cockroaches .  Apparently, as they age they lose, among other things, their escape response.  However, that response returns when their head is cut off.  But at that point, you have to wonder, what is the point of escaping?    And speaking of Creative Loafing, I bought  urlLink Hollis Gillespie's book  today.  I enjoy her writing a lot and I hope she makes lots of money from it.  It's a collection of columns, which are a great length for a reading assignment, but so far, I haven't found one that doesn't have lots of cussing and sex in it.  And while I generally enjoy both of those elements in my reading material, I don't enjoy trying to explain things like  urlLink ratty-assed and butt-blowout and what it might mean to have one's dick in a sling  to a roomful of serious adults who have just come off the third shift.  I don't use a lot of profanity myself - well, more than my mother does, but less than any of the South Park characters.  But I find it interesting that mere words have such power to offend and people such vulnerability to offense.  And as  urlLink this article  points out, those are two completely interdependent elements.  I like to think that I'm not part of that equation, that I'm completely linguistically detached when it comes to profanity, but then I catch myself awkwardly referring to the "n" word, like most any post-P.C. middle class white person and my detachment goes out the window.    Profanity, though, is pretty much a necessary raw material for most comedians.  And I'm thinking of becoming a comedian myself.  But since my range of profanity is, by habit, rather limited, I think I'm going to carve out a niche for myself as a comedian for babies.  Being pre-verbal, they won't really miss the blue language.  My son is giving me a lot of encouragement in this area.  For instance, today, I managed to come up with two really hilarious bits.  Are you ready?  Picture this: I shake my head back and forth really hard so my ponytail flips from side to side. Again and again and again.  And then, it gets better, I act like I'm saying "Woowoowoowoowoo," but I don't say anything - I just move my lips!  Let me tell you, I killed.  He laughed non-stop for a good five minutes.  And he hadn't even had a single cocktail!

      I've been working on another column for the bilingual newspaper, but this is much too long and probably not entertaining enough for publication.  Still,on the off chance that one of my blog readers would enjoy the results of my time with the  urlLink Online Etymological Dictionary  and a  urlLink History of English  website, I will publish them here.  And one explanatory note: all pronunciation is written as if it were Spanish.   Why English Is Hard   As a teacher of English, I’ve heard many complaints about English spelling over the years.  Why is English so hard to read?  Why don’t letters sound the same?  Native speakers often have similar complaints.  American teachers struggle to teach young children the rules of spelling and pronunciation.  One popular approach is to teach phonics - that is, how the sounds of letters combine to form words.  Unfortunately, less than 50% of English obey those sound-spelling rules!   In fact, I remember a joke I learned as a kid:  Do you know that in English, you can spell "fish" as "ghoti"?  Sure, because gh="f" in the word "rough," o="i" in the word "women," and ti="sh" in the word "nation." I laughed at the cleverness of the joke, but it makes my students cry.  Sadly, I have no tricks to make English spelling any easier to learn.  However, I can try to answer the question of why it’s so hard.  In a nutshell:    Pronunciation has changed over time, while spelling has remained the same.     And pronunciation has changed for two reasons:   1) Gradual historical change  2) Borrowing of words from other languages.   The English language was born about 500 A.D. when some German speakers moved from the European continent to the British Isles.  Their particular dialect of German became what we now call Old English.  Old English is a completely foreign language to modern speakers - both the vocabulary and pronunciation of English have changed drastically in the past 1500 years.   A little bit of that original Germanic vocabulary has survived in English, and one of the spelling quirks it has brought with it is the combination "gh," which is usually silent, but occasionally sounded as “f” at the end of a word.  Consider:   right  daughter  laugh  rough   A long time ago, the "gh" in those words was pronounced like the Spanish "j" ( a little stronger than the English "h.")  In some words, that sound disappeared completely, as in "right" and "daughter."  In other words, the sound changed to "f," as in "laugh and "rough."  In Modern German, all those words have retained the pronunciation "j:"   right = richtig  daughter=Tochter  laugh=lachen  rough=roh or rauh   Also, the original vowel sounds of English were the same as Spanish vowels. However, in the 1400s, all the "long" vowels of English changed their place of articulation.  This linguistic event is called The Great Vowel Shift.  Here are some examples of the change in pronunciation of modern words.   Before The Great Vowel Shift:   "meet" sounded like "met"  "my" sounded like "mi"  "boot" sounded like "bout"  "house" sounded like "jus"  "name" sounded like "nam"   This change was gradual and inconsistent and incomplete, accounting for different accents among English speakers today, and different pronunciations of a single spelling. For example, the spelling "ea" once had the sound "ae" (which is the vowel sound in "cat" or "hand.")  Then it changed to "e" and later to "i."  We can see that not all words made the change by comparing these:   bread = "bred"  break = "breik"  speak = "spik"   So, historical change along with conservative spelling is the large part of the answer to that question, why is English so hard?  But another source of difficulty comes from words borrowed from other languages.  English has borrowed close to 90% of its vocabulary and consequently has one of the largest vocabularies of any language in the world.  The borrowing started very early in its history when the conquering Germanic tribes took words from the native Celtic languages.  Soon, Scandinavians invaded England and left many Scandinavian words in the vocabulary.  English was further enriched by Latin when the Christian religion took hold in the British Isles in the 700s.  Another large influx of Latin-based vocabulary came when the French conquered England after the war of 1066.  Greek words came into the vocabulary during the Renaissance, and later, in the Industrial Revolution of the 1800s, Greek and Latin roots became the source of neologisms to describe new inventions.  Those are some of the major periods of borrowing, but English has borrowed from every language it’s been in contact with, keeping souvenirs from Arabic, Hindi, Japanese, Polynesian, Fulani, Yiddish, Persian, Turkish, etc.     If the original word was written in the Roman alphabet, we generally borrowed its spelling and either changed or imitated the original sound. Here’s where the spelling inconsistencies come up:  For example, we pronounce the word “fiancé” as the French do, rather than as a rhyme for “alliance.”   And the Greek “hyperbole” (hai per bo li) doesn’t sound like a football game (get it, Rose Bowl, Hyper Bowl. . .)   And the Australian “koala” doesn’t sound like a soft drink of any kind.  As irritating as all of these irregularities are for the learner of English, they do offer something nice – they offer stories.  Our words remain attached to their origins just enough that we can get a glimpse of other places and times.

       Redneck Humor   Q: What do you have when you've got 32 people from Alabama in a room together? A: A full set of teeth.  Q: What do a tornado and an Alabama divorce have in coomon? A: In either case, somebody loses a trailer.  Jokes courtesy of my cousin's respiratory therapist, who is from Alabama.   Redneck Paraphernalia   If I'd ever wondered where to fulfill my  urlLink redneck bumper sticker  needs, now I know the place - the Army/Navy Surplus store in Normaltown.  I wandered in the other day with the baby, who expressed entirely too much interest in camouflage clothing.  But you can buy some interesting things there, like Army manuals on survival and interrogation, handwarmers and face masks, many, many varieties of flag, and of course, the  urlLink P-38  - who can live without one?   On a personal note   Our dog was just diagnosed with nasal tumors, which are malignant and rapidly invasive.  She might have three months to a year, a  little more if we put her through extremely expensive radiation therapy.   She still looks like a healthy, happy dog, except for the violent sneezing, which started it all.

      I decided at the last minute to take half a day off yesterday to relieve my mom, who caught the baby's cold.  But when I called to say I was on my way over, she told me my cousin (my very elderly cousin) had fallen and broken his hip.  She was going to the hospital as soon as I could get there.  And as soon as my spouse was available, I went to the hospital as well.  The trip down the corridors past the waiting rooms gave me a flashback to my dad's brain surgery and waiting all day for the results.  That was some years ago in another place entirely, but all hospitals look pretty much the same.  My first hospital stay ever was when I had the baby, and I was so worried about it.  I'd asked the doctor repeatedly did I really have to stay overnight?  Couldn't I just have the baby and go home?  Of course the c-section ruled out any foreshortened stay.  But I ended up really grateful for that time of being cared for while we learned to care for our son.  On the third day, the doctor came by and said I could go home that afternoon, and I said, "Do I have to?" And I got another night there.  But sadly, my cousin has nothing as happy as a baby to look forward to.  He's in surgery at this moment and my mother is there and I'm home with the baby, waiting to hear.  My companion has just gotten tired of shredding the New Yorker, so we need to find another form of entertainment.

       Some humorous moments in the classroom.   Once, I asked my students at a university ESL program to learn a joke and tell it in the next class.  One guy came back the next day looking frustrated.  He learned a joke from his roommate, he said, but he didn't know why it was funny.  So I asked him to tell us the joke, and he said, "What do you call a blonde with a dollar bill on top of her head?  All you can eat for under a dollar."  No one else laughed, so I thought a minute, chickened out, and said, "I don't know why it's funny either.  Who's next?"    A friend of mine was using novels in her advanced class, and based on her love of the movie, she chose  urlLink Damage , somehow forgetting the highly charged sexual content.  A very straight-laced Presbyterian minister was in her class.  He approached her very earnestly with some vocabulary questions after class.  She went through several with him until he got to the last one, "Teacher, what means this: fell-ah-ti-o?"  She explained and he listened, both with straight faces.  He thanked her and had no more questions the rest of the term.  Usually, I have encouraged my students NOT to Americanize their names, but I made an exception in the case of Suk Dik.  A Japanese girl was staying with an American host family over the holidays.  She wrote to me about her experience.  "They hugged me but I was uncomfortable because they were all so big, like trees."   In the news   This week's New Yorker mentioned the Baylor University student newspaper  urlLink editorial  in support of gay marriage.  Robert Sloan, president of the Baptist school, was upset about it, and reprimanded the paper.  But the New Yorker described it as a battle of generations in which the future is sure to beat the past.  Young people, even conservative ones, just don't find homosexuality scary or threatening.

       Interesting things other people have said about religion.   Lachele commented that the Faith & Values section of the AJC had an article on Hindus.  I hope it was a good one.  That seems quite daring for the AJC.    When my spouse and I lived in a smaller Southern town, some miles outside of this hub of sophisitication and learning, all my neighbors met me for the first time with two questions, "Which church do you all attend?" and "What does your husband do?"    In that same town, we received an occasional visit from some ladies from the Baptist church.  One day, I sat with them on my front porch and one of them talked to me quite frankly about her religious beliefs.  She said that there were angels all around us at that very moment, and she was as sure of it as she was sure we were sitting there.  In middle school, I had a friend whose family attended a particularly strict fundamentalist church.  She couldn't see movies or shave her legs or wash her hair more than once a week.  Once, I was talking to her about my plans for after high school, and I asked about hers, and she answered, "I'm sure we'll be caught up in the rapture by then, so I can't make any plans."  At a Teens Encounter Christ weekend, a guy was giving a motivational speech about the positive difference Jesus had made in his life.  He said, "I used to be really messed up on drugs. . . but now. . . I'm really messed up on Jesus!"  A friend from Mexico has a sister-in-law who is a witch.  No, not a gentle Wiccan, but the bad kind of witch who wants to do harm.  My friend's brother got very sick and didn't get better.  A strange doll was found among the sister-in-law's things - a voodoo doll representing the brother with pins stuck in it.  When they destroyed the doll, he got better.   On a personal note. . .   The baby is having his first cold.  Snot rattles in his nose all night and keeps him semi-wakeful.  But if I try to suck it out with that squeezy bulb thing, he gets really waked up and furious.    I spent a lovely day with Helly on Saturday and have a new pink bracelet to commemorate the occasion.    I cleaned my house all day today anticipating a visit from a realtor.  I got a list of things to do to the house.  It was very helpful and free, although of course, when we do eventually put the house on the market, I'll feel a moral obligation to ask her to sell it.  No links.  No reading comments.  No movies.

      The baby, like a spider, puts out an invisible thread that attaches to me and extends about eight feet.  If I break that thread by going to the bathroom or answering the phone, or by pulling it in the opposite direction, out of his range of vision, he cries in a very heartbroken way.  Yesterday, we struggled with this new rule, but today, I was more obedient, and we got along wonderfully.  I gave him his first toothbrush and he loved it. He chewed on it for a long time.    During this week off, I've mainly associated with him and my mother during the day, so the range of my interactions has been unusually limited.  Nonetheless, I had a couple of brief ones that I enjoyed.  Earlier in the week, we went to K-Mart, the baby and I.  He's able to sit in a shopping cart now, which makes shopping so much easier, since I never used one of those baby carriers.  We were ambling along the aisles in an unhurried way, near the pharmacy section, when an older lady stopped me to ask if the Serenity pads she was holding were the absorbent kind.  That kind of surprised me since I think I was clearly neither an employee nor in the age range of typical consumers of that product.  She told me more about her bladder control issues, and I read the package out loud, pointing out the not-obvious fact that the size "Ultra" was only in the middle of a range from "Super" to "Ultra Extra Plus"  (or something like that, really.)  Then I offered what I knew about  urlLink Kegel exercises .  She seemed really pleased and left me with several lavish compliments for the baby.    Another day, I left the baby with Grandma and went to the coffee shop to read.  Instead of the usual music, there was a voice on the speakers that I couldn't quite make out.  I was giving my order to the cash register guy while obviously listening, catching a word here and there, like "Gollum" and "evil."  The guy explained it was his personal treasured recording of J.R.R. Tolkein himself reading from The Lord of The Rings.  You could hear his rocking chair creak and his wife in the background.  The guy had taken a course on Tolkein in college and was currently studying Elvish, and offered to talk about it with me any time.  How nice!  I like  urlLink geeks  so much.  I've lamented the fact that I'm not one myself - the only thing I know a lot of is words, but I'm not able to remember a lot of data about anything.  For instance, I read the Lord of the Rings half a dozen times and loved it, but I couldn't tell you a single difference between the book and the movie, except that Legolas in the movie was even prettier than I'd imagined in the book.      I added another link to my short list of links,  urlLink Kristal's blog .  It's my favorite blog of people that I don't know personally.

      I have an idea now of writing a column for a local bilingual magazine about cognates or idioms, something like that.  I have no idea if such a column would be welcome, but I plan to submit the following:  There's an old joke about a missionary's wife.  She and her husband had recently arrived at their new church in a South American country.  The congregation had a dinner to welcome them, and the local pastor invited each of them to speak.  The wife was reluctant because her Spanish was rudimentary, but after much encouragement from the group, she went up to the podium and began apologetically, "Estoy muy embarazada, y el" (indicating the local pastor) "tiene la culpa."  Instead of friendly laughter, she was met with stunned silence because, of course, what the congregation had understood was, "I am very pregnant, and it's his fault."   Embarrassed  and  embarazada  are examples of "false friends" between Spanish and English, that is, words in two different languages that look or sound like they  should  mean the same thing, but really don't.  As a student of Spanish and teacher of English, I've run across some interesting false friends which have caused some pretty amusing mistakes.  The following examples are real cases of confusion that I've had with students and friends.  The definitions of the Spanish words represent the particular usage that I learned in each case.     1.  Spanish  molestar  (bother, annoy) and English  molest  (abusar sexualmente).  Imagine my shock when a student told me, "I no finish my homework because my brother molest me."  2.  Spanish  constipado  (congested) and English  constipated  (estrinido).  I once really confused a Hispanic friend when I urged her to eat prunes to cure a stuffy nose.  3.  Spanish  coraje  (anger) and English  courage  (valor).  My class looked worried when I bragged I had "coraje" after I killed a spider.  4.  Spanish  Tengo frio.  (I'm cold) and English  I have a cold.  (Tengo catarro.)  I told some students I'd missed class the other day because "tuve frio," and they looked at me like, "You big baby, it's 65 degrees."  5.  Spanish  papa  (potato) and English  Papa  (papa').  I thought my Mexican friend was bringing her father over for dinner, so I was puzzled, but nonetheless pleased, when she gave me a dish of mashed potatoes instead.  6.  Spanish  sopa  (soup) and English  soap  (jabon).  I still make the mistake of asking the Hispanic children I sometimes work with to please wash their hands with soup.    7.  Spanish  sensible  (sensitive) and English  sensible  (razonable).  My class watched a movie together and several of us were quite misty-eyed by the end of it.  I was really pleased when one of the Hispanic students praised us for being "sensible."  8. Spanish  carrera  (major subject in school) and English  career  (profesion, trabajo).  When my 18-year-old Colombian student told me about his career in busness, I was amazed that he'd gotten such an early start.  Fortunately for language students, Spanish and English really are very friendly languages and most words that sound the same really do have similar meanings.  These false friends are exceptions, but it comes in handy to know them.  Hmmm.  I may leave off 7 and 8 because they're the least amusing.  I should write something more at the end.

      My spouse and I went to see Starsky and Hutch on the weekend.  I had been a big fan of the show as a kid, due to a profound crush on Paul Michael Glaser.  But I don't remember Starsky as the tight-ass and Hutch as the free spirit as they were characterized in the movie.  The movie was less like watching the original Starsky and Hutch than like watching Zoolander II - Retro Cops.  However, it was really a treat when the original actors appeared in a cameo at the end and I could see that Paul Michael Glaser, at age 60, is  urlLink stiil the cute one !

      I had lunch at the new Schlotsky's today - it's a couple of minutes from my job and has a nice chai latte in addition to an immaculate ladies' room.  I finished my sandwich with a good twenty minutes to spare, so I sat myself in front of one of the cool-looking desk-lamp style Macs lined up at a bar.  The network was down, so instead of doing this, I played a pretty game called JewelToy.  It's like a simple, tic tac toe version of Tetris, with pretty colored shiny jewels to look at.  After awhile I realized that I had companions at the bar and they were all small children, playing games.  One of them offered me one of those great "I know I'm in the South," moments.  Her daddy came up to her and said, "What you drinking, sport?" and she asked "Well, what can I have?"  He listed, "Juice, tea, water, or coke."  She asked for coke.  He said, "Okay," then followed up with, "You want a regular Coke or a Sprite or something?"  I didn't hear the answer because I was giggling too loudly in my head.  My favorite of those moments was back in college, in the language lab, there was a sign at each cubicle that said, "Mash the red button to record."  I don't have a Southern accent, and I blame my sixth grade teacher, but that's a long story.  Still, my dialect (see the quiz on Helly's blog) reflects my heritage, at least occasionally.  For instance, I've been told by non-Southerners that these lovely sentences are either grammatically offensive, or mysterious.  He used to could climb trees really well, but these days, he might ought to use a ladder instead.  I can't wear that sweater anymore because it drew up in the wash.  Yesterday I got home late because I had to pick up my cousin and carry him to his eye doctor appointment.

      Poor Aristide.  The  urlLink news today  was different from what I first heard on the radio.  Although  urlLink the U.S. denies it , now it seems more likely that he was forcibly removed from office and taken away.  To what intended good, I wonder.  I like to try to believe there is some element of good intention in my government's actions.    In that spirit of optimism I left work to vote today.  It pained me to have to drive all the way across town during lunch traffic when my workplace serves as a polling place.  I asked really nicely to some of the poll workers who were right outside my classroom door, but they weren't going to bend the rules just for me.  After a lengthy drive, though, I was in and out in a few minutes, and voting with the touch-screen was very easy.  Still, the idea of a paper receipt makes a lot of sense, and I wish Georgia were giving that a try.  I couldn't help but laugh when I looked at the  urlLink state flag pictures , recalling Helly's IHOP placemat quip. Personally, I would happily have voted to abolish the flag, but there was no write-in option.   It's kind of interesting that the etymological dictionary suggests a relationship between  flag  (v. - hang loosely, become limp) and  fag  (v. - flag or decline).  Both are cited as origin unknown.  Hmm.

      Poor Haiti.   urlLink President Aristide  has left country of his own free will either because of or not because of pressure from the U.S. government.  He has held the office of President of the Republic of Haiti three times, so who's to say he won't be back after a sunny vacation abroad.  He is such a good man - a priest, a writer, a revolutionary, a man who cares about the people - but he didn't fulfill his promise, and his people remain desperately poor.  I was in Haiti for 8 days in the summer of  urlLink 1987 , just months after the last Duvalier was exiled.  I travelled with a group called Medical Missions because one of their volunteers, a dentist, came to speak at a seminar I was taking on Carribean history.  Haiti was famous at that time as the poorest country in the Western Hemisphere.  When we arrived in the hot, overcrowded airport in Port-au-Prince, standing there huddled around our duffle bags and jostled on all sides by rushing travellers, it seemed that we were the only white people in the building.  But then we saw a pretty, blond young man with shorts and a head band, holding up a sign.  He approached us hopefully, shouting, "Club Med?" over the din.  Later, I tried to picture the people who had planned that particular Club Med vacation.  -"Honey, where do you want to go this year?" -"How about Haiti?  It's the poorest country in the Western Hemisphere!"  "Okay, as long as I don't have to settle for less than four stars!"  I met people there that I never forgot: Remy Mesilus, Jean Dimanche, and Nala Duvillaume, the three people I was able to communicate with.  The first two were translators, intelligent and handsome young men and I had about a four-day crush on each of them.  Nala was an older man who spoke French and helped me translate to Creole.  They were kind to me, and I have wondered if they survived these past 17 years.   I didn't hit it off well with the spiritual leader of the group.   He was too much like the popular bullies I remembered from high school, and his attitude toward Haitians struck me as patronizing and unenlightened at best.  Worse, he harrassed me every evening at "sharing time" when I never had anything to share. But he had an unhappy fate - an accident left him with total amnesia, I heard.  I don't know if he ever recovered.  He taught us some essential Creole before we left:  if a Haitian said anything to us, we should respond, "Benny swallowed a nail."  He translated it as "Praise Jesus," but later I saw it written on a bus: "Beni soit l'eternel."  Blessed be the Eternal.  A hauntingly beautiful phrase if you listen to it.   Benny swallowed a nail , though, that was pretty good.

       Blogs   Alan just sent me a fascinating blog that I'm going to post here for my own convenience:   urlLink The Religious Policeman   It is the blog of a Saudi man who is critical of his government and society and writes in perfect English.  He reminds me of his Iraqi counterpart at   urlLink Dear Raed .   TV   I've gotten a lot more entertainment out of tv series on dvd than movies in the past couple of years.  With a tv series, the nice thing is that if I like it, it offers hours and hours and hours of entertainment.   Here's a top 8 list of tv series I've enjoyed recently either on video or in reruns (The West Wing only).  I tried the Sopranos, but I couldn't get interested.  I didn't like any of the characters.  8. Sex and the City  7. Oz (violent!) 6. Upstairs, Downstairs 5. Six Feet Under 4. Queer As Folk 3. 24 2. The West Wing  1. Buffy the Vampire Slayer  My Top 10 tv series of all time:  10. Starsky and Hutch (big crush on  urlLink Paul Michael Glaser ) 9. Lou Grant (big crush on  urlLink Robert Walden ) 8. The Twilight Zone 7. The X-Files (but only before  urlLink Mulder  left) 6. Family Ties (try the  urlLink quiz ) 5. Cheers (" urlLink Hey, Norm , what's shakin'?" - "All four cheeks and a couple of chins.") 4. M*A*S*H* 3. Angel 2. The West Wing 1. Buffy The Vampire Slayer (complete with its own  urlLink metaphysics )

       More Baby   He started revealing his powers very early, when he was just a couple of months old.  He was quite immobile at the time.  No rolling over or sitting up or any of that. He would lie where I put him.  One morning he lay in the bed by the night stand as I was getting dressed.  He was either asleep or in his cozy pre-sleep zone where he would stare vacantly while being really still.  I turned my back to get socks out of a drawer, and when I turned around, his empty bottle, which had been on the nightstand, was beside him on the bed.  He lay there looking completely innocent, not touching the bottle.  Had it fallen there by itself?  Hmmm.  I turned my back again, maybe to put on shoes.  And when I looked at him a second time, the clock radio was beside him on the bed.  Sandy thinks he's a Jedi.  That would explain some things.  But not his affection for the remote control.  I don't know if it's nurture or nature, but he's just like his daddy, eager to take it out of my hands the minute I capture it.  Last night, I lay on the floor by the coffee table while he played with a remote control.  It's interesting that such a small, lightweight thing can cause  SO MUCH PAIN  when dropped from a few inches above onto a face.     A Few Things I've Learned From The Baby     Babies can have secrets.   Sometimes it's hard to be a baby.   Telephone cords are excellent things.   The noises of dogs are very funny.   Baby food simply can't be as bad as it looks.   Magazines are for tearing.   Hair is for pulling.   Skin is for pinching or biting.   A baby's kiss is very, very, very wet, but infinitely sweet.    The most interesting thing I've learned from the baby is that I am now not only the protagonist and star of my own life story, but a peripheral, yet significant, character in his.  The mother.  The one he blames for future failed relationships with women.  Or the one to whom he attributes his love of books or his tendency to worry or his poor eyesight.  Who knows what my role will be?  Yet how odd it is to become that character in someone else's life.

       The Cinema   I've been wanting to see a movie in a theater for ages, and I finally went to one on Saturday.  I chose  urlLink Connie and Carla  because I was in the mood for light-hearted entertainment.  I ended up  enjoying it, but I wasn't expecting such broad, slapstick comedy (think  urlLink Laverne and Shirley ).  But it was cute, there were some good laughs, and I enjoyed the basic premise because those two actresses both made pretty believable drag queens.    On video, I watched  urlLink Groundhog Day  after reading an article about Harold Ramis, who has writing credits on  urlLink Animal House ,  urlLink Caddyshack ,  urlLink Stripes ,  urlLink Meatballs , and  urlLink Back To School , all movies I thought were hilarious.  Groundhog Day had bored me to sleep the first time around, so I thought I'd give it another chance.  I had two cups of coffee to fortify me, and I stayed awake till the end, but I can't say I liked it any better.  The only really funny moment was when he punched the eminently punchable  urlLink Stephen Tobolowsky .   Words I've Had To Look Up Recently    exegesis : Critical explanation or analysis, especially of a text.  The New Yorker writers love this word.  It comes from the Greek "exegeisthai" meaning  interpret , from "ex-" ( out ) + "hegeisthai" ( to lead ).   apogee : The farthest or highest point, apex.  Also originally from Greek "apo-" ( far from ) + "gaia" ( the earth ).    Thanks, New Yorker.  I'm ready to take the GRE again now.   For Sandy   You have to hear this in the voice of Syd Vicious.   And now, the end is near; And so I face the final curtain. My friend, I’ll say it clear, I’ll state my case, of which I’m certain.  I’ve lived a life that’s full. I’ve traveled each and ev’ry highway; And more, much more than this, I did it my way.  Regrets, I’ve had a few; But then again, too few to mention. I did what I had to do And saw it through without exemption.  I planned each charted course; Each careful step along the byway, But more, much more than this, I did it my way.  Yes, there were times, I’m sure you knew When I bit off more than I could chew. But through it all, when there was doubt, I ate it up and spit it out. I faced it all and I stood tall; And did it my way.  I’ve loved, I’ve laughed and cried. I’ve had my fill; my share of losing. And now, as tears subside, I find it all so amusing.  To think I did all that; And may I say - not in a shy way, No, oh no not me, I did it my way.  For what is a man, what has he got? If not himself, then he has naught. To say the things he truly feels; And not the words of one who kneels. The record shows I took the blows - And did it my way!

       Baby   Guns, pools, houseplants, pesticides, water, air - everything is dangerous.  How do adults survive having little children?  The worry is enough to kill me.  The child himself knows none of these dangers.  He is becoming very mysterious - he is developing abilities, but prefers to operate from a black box.  For instance, I have yet to see him crawl.  However, he was sitting on the floor one day, and I put one of his large puzzle pieces in front of him, but well out of his reach.  He stared at it, reached for it, whined at me, but otherwise made no attempt to get.  I went in the kitchen to wash some dishes and checked on him a minute or two later.  He was sitting in the same position, but the puzzle piece was  behind  him.    And the other day at Grandma's, he was sleeping, or almost asleep, in his carrier on the floor, and mom stepped into the bathroom.  From the bathroom, she heard noises from his activity table, which was well out of reach of the carrier.  When she came back into the room, he was in the process of toppling out of the carrier - but she couldn't see any way he could reach the toy.  Spooky.    One more thing, I know he can stand up in his crib, but he won't let me see him walk around it.  The crib is in our bedroom.  I'll stand him in it, facing the bed and walk into the bathroom to brush my teeth.  When I come out, invariably, he has walked around to the other side of the crib, by the bathroom door, and he's smiling at me.  But when I go around and sit on the bed and ask him to come over, he looks over his shoulder like, "What?  You know I can't walk yet!"  And he won't move.

       Guns   There is a full page color ad today for a special edition commemorative shotgun decorated with gold plating and the words Clarke County.  One of my coworkers was so distraught over it that at first glance, I thought it was commemorating the Clarke Country  School District , but that wasn't the case.  My boss's boss is a gun aficionado and was speculating how much they might cost.    I'll probably never have a gun in my house.  I don't plan to take up hunting, so I wouldn't have need for a shotgun or a rifle.  Target shooting is out of the question as well since I have really terrible aim.  And since " urlLink a gun in the home is far more likely to to kill a family member than an intruder ," I'll never have a handgun in the house - especially as long as my son is living in it.  (I hope all my gun-toting friends will not take this personally.)  My mom influenced my attitude about guns, and she has a really good story about one.  When she was a child, her dad kept a gun under the mattress.  He would put one bullet in it every night and take it out every morning.  Except one morning he forgot to unload it, so he reminded his wife as she and the twins (Mom and her brother) were all in the car taking him to work.  When they got back to the house, Mom's mother forgot all about the gun, but her brother remembered.  They were four years old.  They went in their parents' bedroom to play and they lifted the mattress enough to pull the gun out.  My uncle said to my mom, "Go stand over there by the wall, and I'll shoot you."  That sounded like fun, so Mom did as she was told.  My uncle fired the gun from a few feet away, but fortunately for them both, four year olds have pretty lousy aim.  The bullet went into a chest of drawers just inches away.

       On The Town   I went to a rockin' good bass recital last night, performed by Helly's little brother Bo.  A couple of the selections were really beautiful.  I could tell I would like them just by reading the dates under the composers' names.  Something from the 18th century - excellent!  Melodic, precise, deftly woven lines of music.  Something from the 19th century - even better!  Pretty, romantic, emotional music.  I think after the 19th century, composers became significantly less interested in entertaining the listener.  And I really do appreciate music's effort to please me, even if it falls short.  However, as a musician, I can imagine taking a real enjoyment from the modern, atonal, amelodic sorts of things, and even listening to them, I had to admire the performer's artistry and the composer's creativity.  All in all, it was a good show and a pleasant evening out with Helly's charming family.

       Would You Like Freedom Fries With That?   I majored in French without the slightest intention of becoming a French teacher, translator, or interpreter.  So what on earth was I thinking?  That's what a lot of people asked me at the time, especially folks who were pursuing far more practical degrees in business or computers, who were doing job interviews before their senior year, and who, in fact, had just one senior year before they graduated.  And that was the same question my friends and I would ask ourselves as the beer ran out and the smoke cleared - English/Anthropology/French/Philosophy/(not to mention French Philosophy), what were we thinking?  Sure, there was graduate school, but in our moments of clarity, we could picture the charm of the "eternal student" lifestyle wearing thin some years down the road.  We knew even then that it's one thing to live in a basement, subsist on ramen noodles, and call yourself an existentialist when you're like 22, and a far less attractive thing altogether when you're in your 30s.  But in spite of a gnawing anxiety that we should perhaps be more practical, changing majors after three or four years is actually a highly impractical undertaking.  So, like most of my friends on graduation day, I went home with the date that brung me to the party: a B.A. in French.  And the thing is now, 15 years later, I’m sure that French was the best of all possible majors for me - and not just because I got to read that ever optimistic Candide.  One thing it did for me was to show me an aspect of my personality that I’d lost all confidence in - the ability to speak to a room full of people.  In my other classes, even the smallest seminars, I was a silent participant, too afraid of messing up my words and sounding stupid to take the risk of speaking up, let alone making an argument.  But in French class, the first time I opened my mouth, I realized I didn’t have to be perfect because I was speaking a  foreign language .  How liberating!  Nobody in French 101 sounded all that smart or articulate, asking each other the time of day or if they’ve seen Michel or  Francoise.  And in fact, adults never learn a foreign language perfectly; it’s just not possible except for maybe 0.03 percent of the population, and those are all, I think, living in Belgium.  So, released from the burden of perfection, I felt quite free to speak up in class.  Now I speak to a class every day; I tell them it’s okay not to be perfect, and I relax in the knowledge that they’re also not picking apart my words to judge them.  If I make them understand me, then I’ve spoken very well.  The study of French not only opened my mouth, it opened my mind as well, awakening a profound interest in other cultures that I hadn’t really been able to pursue in my hometown (where the only non-white members of my graduating class of 400 were a Korean and a Vietnamese - the valedictorian and salutatorian, respectively, I believe).  The study of French gave me an opportunity to live in another country for a little while (see yesterday’s post) and for the first time understand that I am really an American.  It’s amazing how little meaning such a concept can have until you’ve tested it.  I mean, every time the cars crowded two per lane on the freeway, I would cringe against the passenger door and think, "I’m an American."  And every time the teenagers I was hanging out with extended their impassioned political argument into its third hour, I would yawn and say to myself, "I’m really an American."  And when I was both shocked and fascinated to see naked breasts on tv commercials for things like shoes and furniture polish, I had to realize, "It’s because I’m an American that I have this disconcerting feeling."  So, through those and similar experiences, I really began to understand the word American as a description of me - but not as a limitation, I would say to myself later, snail butter dribbling down my chin.  Even though it wasn't in a direct line, my French major led me to my current career as an English teacher.  And although I'm never going to be earning the impressive salary of a well-placed systems engineer, for instance, I pay my bills.  And more importantly, I'm doing something I like that I think I'm pretty good at.  All because I majored in something I liked and was good at.  So, twenty years or so from now, when my son announces that he's majoring in art history or comparative religion, I promise to bite my tongue before asking, "What kind of job do you think you're going to get with a degree in  THAT ?"

       Parlez-Vous Francais?   I was a French major in college, and I tell you that now only because I'm not running for office.  John Kerry, who is fluent in French, is no longer allowed to answer questions from the French press in that language, nor is he allowed to chat amicably with those reporters if cameras might be around.  Because even his own party (which would be, um,  my  party) doesn't want him to come across as too, you know, French.  That's what the New Yorker said this morning, anyway.  Personally, I'm crazy about the French.   I was in their lovely country twice in my life, and I've had several good friends who boast that nationality.  Back in the eighties, I spent two months in the Loire Valley, possibly the most beautiful place on earth.  Every time I blinked, I opened my eyes to a jigsaw puzzle-worthy view - fields of heavy-headed sunflowers, castles on hilltops, villages of white walls and red rooftops climbing the banks of a clean, meandering river.  It was there that I learned both the concept and practice of a six hour meal, and it was there that I was presented with my first chocolate sandwich.  I forgot more details about wine in those two months than I've ever learned about any subject since.  And the people were kind!  Sure, they talked all at once at mealtimes, but that was only irritating because my language skills were too weak for me to participate.  And sure, twelve-year-old children would articulately critique U.S. foreign policy to me, but that was only irritating because I'm like ten times more politically aware now than I was then, and I still couldn't win an argument with a French 12-year-old.  But that's just me.  And regardless of their opinions of my government, which I figure they were allowed to have, they treated me with unfailing gracious hospitality, offering the best of their country and of themselves to their woefully ignorant and immature foreign visitor.  How could I not be grateful?  And did I mention the chocolate sandwich?   Le Bebe   Mon cher bebe pleurait y pleurait parcequ'il ne voulait pas dormir tout seul.  Le pauvre!

       Songs   I heard two of my favorite songs ever today on NPR.  I don't know what the show was because I just caught these two songs back to back:  urlLink Cheek To Cheek  and  urlLink Let's Call The Whole Thing Off .  The former has one of my favorite lyrics: ". . .And the cares that hung around me through the week seem to vanish like a gambler's lucky streak when we're out together dancing cheek to cheek."  Isn't that great?  May it be in your head now, too.     Scones   I went to a coffee shop for breakfast with a friend of mine.  We had to wait for it to open, and then they didn't have much food there.  I was hungry enough to go ahead and eat a day old apple danish, but my friend optimistically waited for  urlLink Big City Bread  to deliver her chocolate chip scone.  When it finally came, I went in to make the purchase.  The cash register guy noted it was still nice and warm, nearly compelling me to buy one for myself as well.  I admitted my temptation and he said, "I couldn't let myself do that - not for 900 calories."  900 calories???  That sounded implausible until I came across  urlLink this recipe .  The 2655 calorie count horrified me, until I read the serving size - it's the entire recipe.  Anyway, I didn't get that scone.

       Baby   The baby slept in his crib last night for the first time - till about 4:00 a.m. or so, which was pretty good.  On Thursday I happened to read the tag inside his bassinett that warned against using it for a baby more than 3 months old or 15 pounds.  He is over 8 months old and more than 20 pounds.  And when I was reading the tag, he was lying with his head wedged in a corner and one leg hanging over the side.  So, I guess it was really time for a change.  He seems to like the crib well enough.  He can stand up in it and walk around, holding on to the sides.

      I went to see Hollis Gillespie at Barnes & Noble this evening - I only stayed for a little while as I already had other plans, but still, it was entertaining.  She read, or told stories from, her book,  urlLink Bleachy-Haired Honky Bitch: Tales From a Bad Neighborhood .  The AJC, at first, wouldn't print the title in its Peach Buzz column because it had "two words they weren't allowed to say."  But after she went on Jay Leno, they were okay with the title.  My favorite story that she told, and I'm not going to do it justice, was about her childhood crush on Satan.  Her mother was an atheist and her father didn't want to be bothered taking kids to church, so he gave them a children's illustrated bible, saying, "You got all the God you need, right here."  And the illustration of Satan was pretty hot - the dark hair, the snazzy goatee, the sun-burnt complexion.  So one day she announced to her mother, "Guess what?  When I grow up, I'm gonna marry Satan!"  Her mother looked at her and took the cigarette out of her mouth long enough to say, "Kid, whatever you do, don't get married."  Believe me, it was funny when she said it.  I enjoyed her story-telling style, although her spoken voice was different from the voice I imagine when I read her  urlLink columns .    PPrevious to that, I was sitting in a coffee shop while my keys were locked in the car, listening to a group of women plan a very expensive sounding wedding.  My companion was more interesting, telling me new things like, "Da da dat da" and "Dzzhh dzzhh," and  "Boof."  He's told me that last one before, but it's a good story, and I always like hearing it again.

       Music   Just got back from playing our 15 minute set at The Hoot.  We don't really do folk music, and a lot of people in the audience were there to see a couple of blue grass bands.  When we started playing, it seemed that the room began to empty out!  But that could have been because it was pretty late and we were the last ones to play, too.  But thanks to some dedicated friends and family members, and my music partner's students, we had a few people to clap for us when we were done.  I like blue grass, especially tight vocal harmonies.  One group played very traditional blue grass, and did a few ballads.  The other group was like a blue grass jam band.  There's nothing trippier than a ten minute mandolin solo.  Before those two bands were several different folk groups.  One of them sang a song about her beloved childhood dog, and how she cried in her Daddy's arms when the dog died.  That song has already been written too many times, and it needs to never be written again.  Not only is it a trite and hackneyed theme, it always makes me cry.    Peeves   I really enjoyed Sandy's list of her grammatical pet peeves.  I was thinking of doing a similar one until I realized that, maybe because I'm confronted with truly bizarre, cryptic, convoluted syntax and vocabulary every day, nothing really bothers me.  Okay, a few things bother me.  Chick-Fil-A's literacy-challenged cows really bother me.  If they're smart enough to spell and write their little signs, they're smart enough to do it correctly.  And any intentional misspelling is irritating - like Kuntry Kitchen Kafe.  Although The Meat Shoppe in Gray, Georgia, is more funny than irritating.  "I could care less" - that expression troubles me.  It doesn't make sense.  "I couldn't care less" makes sense.  But they can't be interchangeable; it's just not right.  This one doesn't bother me, but it always catches my attention.  Note the use of "which":   I borrowed my brother's car, which if I'd known he was coming back from vacation early, I wouldn't have done it.   "Which" should be replacing that "it" at the end of the sentence, but it doesn't.  This use of "which" just as a clause marker seems really common in speech.

       The CD/MP3 player     My mother gave me a walkman-style CD/MP3 player for Christmas.  It was something I'd really wanted and was just elated to have.  But I could never get it to work right.  It would cut off sporadically whenever I was walking, which was very disconcerting.  If I sat still with it, it played okay, but since I wanted it for an exercise aid, I had to give up on it after a couple of weeks.  I sent it back to the place it was ordered from in exchange for a new one.  A month later it arrived and I could not for the life of me even get it to come on.  I took the batteries out and put them in several times.  I tried different batteries.  So I sent that one back in disgust, requesting a refund.  Yesterday, my mom was at K-Mart and she bought me yet another one.  I took it out for a test drive this morning.  I tucked it into the waist band of my jeans to have my hands free, but, unknown to me, it was working its way out.  Finally, like a renegade fish, it slipped out of my last minute grasp and flopped onto the pavement.  Now it won't close unless it's wrapped tightly with a rubber band.  Which it is right now.  And I think that's okay.

       All about my job . . .   My students often confuse the words "hungry" and "angry" because of their similar pronunciation - especially for Spanish speakers, who aren't used to pronouncing the letter "h." But, for me, those words have a strong semantic relationship as well because when I get hungry - really hungry - I get kind of angry, too. The Congressman's visit was scheduled for 11:00, my usual lunchtime, but he didn't get to my classroom till about 12:20. We were all getting pretty fidgety by that time. When he finally arrived, with a small entourage, I made an effort to give him a friendly welcome, but all I could think was, "You've stolen my lunch hour, damn it." Consequently, I found myself irritated rather than respectful while he speechified, telling my class, in what I thought was a rather patronizing manner, that they were good for coming to school, that they needed to help their children, that it was important for them to help their kids be successful in school. They already know that; that's why they were there. I wanted him to listen more to them. His final speechification was praise for our wonderful program. He urged them all to keep coming to school. Just as he tapered off, I asked my question, "Can you tell us, does this program have your support?" First he joked a bit, "Well, why do you think I'm here?" grabbing my uber-boss's hand. Then he hedged around, saying he would have to get more information to understand what the administration's reasoning about the budget is. So, that was kind of discouraging - but mostly because I was so hungry. One of my co-workers said "Way to put him on the spot!" But I hadn't felt daring about it, just . . . hungry. When he left, I had just enough time to eat an apple before the afternoon group arrived.  I want my program to exist apart from wanting to keep my job. I've never been so proud of a place I've worked for. It's name is  urlLink Even Start , which expresses its purpose, to give the children of parents with a low income and level of education an even start in school with all the middle class kids. In general, middle class parenting customs are good for the development of children's minds: interacting a lot with babies and young children and reading with them. For instance, on average, middle class children have spent over 1,000 hours reading books with a family member before they enter kindergarten. For lower class kids, the average is about 25 hours. Middle class children are typically exposed to thousands of different words before they start school. Kids from the lower socio-economic rung have heard about 500 - mostly imperatives. And a parents' level of education correlates highly with the level of education their children are likely to attain. I learned those numbers, which I don't remember exactly, from one of my co-workers. Maybe later, I can find links to add. Anyway, the large majority of adults in our program did not finish high school. The majority of people in my classes did not have the opportunity for schooling after the 8th grade - that's the end of free, public educationion in Mexico. If you ever hear a Mexican referred to as "an 8th grade dropout" (as I did recently) don't assume he was bored or a poor learner. He was probably just poor. And many people couldn't afford even that much schooling because apart from tuition, there are books and uniforms and bus fare to pay for. So, the people who come to my class don't have the literacy skills themselves to pass them on effectively to their children. But after a couple of years, or sometimes more, they do!   For instance.   (All names are fake, but stories are true.)  Youngha is from Korea. When she was young, her parents divorced and her father, as is the custom, retained custody of all the children. But they were poor. She only went to school for a couple of years. She remembers being very young and watching other kids eat their boxed lunches at school, and feeling sad because she had nothing to eat. She was living alone at age 14. Many years later, she met an American G.I stationed in her hometown. They fell in love, got married, and came to the states. Her mother-in-law brought her to school with her infant son. She spoke almost no English and did not recognize any letters of the alphabet. She was completely dependent on her husband or mother-in-law for transportation and advocacy. Now, nearly six years later, she has a driver's license and drives everywhere - in fact, she offers rides to her car-less classmates. She goes to her son's teacher conferences. She speaks very fluently. She still struggles with literacy, but she knows many, many words by sight now and can often correctly sound out what she doesn't know. She brings me books for her son to read and I help her with them or tape record them. She is thinking about looking for a job now.  Adriana came to my class almost five years ago. She was court-ordered to take English classes as part of her probation. She had been shopping at a grocery store with her two boys and two infant daughters. She rang her up groceries and left, but a security guard stopped her in the parking lot. Soon the police arrived and handcuffed her, in front of her children. She was taken to jail. The store manager had seen her older son collecting items and putting them in the babies' stroller. When asked what he was doing, the child answered, "My mommy told me to do it!" The items were worth a little over $14. When the police tried to question her, she couldn't say anything in her defense. She had a bad lawyer who let her get sentenced to a year's probation. Five years later, she just finished reading her first novel in English, a children's book. She is an active participant in all of her children's school activities. A gifted musician, she brings a guitar to her daughter's school once a week and sings songs in both English and Spanish for their class.  Leonora came to my class four years ago. She was with me for most of that year, and she impressed me with her studiousness and quick learning. For one of my parenting classes, I invited a speaker from the local battered women's shelter to talk about domestic violence. When Leonora disappeared from my class sometime after that, I went to see her. She admitted that she was experiencing domestic violence and had decided to leave her husband. With the phone number she got in class, she contacted the shelter and took her family there. Now, she lives independently with her three kids and she has a good job where she is valued highly. Her oldest is about to graduate high school with a very high GPA.  Eliana and Martha are very young, just in their early twenties. They both came to the U.S. from Central America as teenagers, 14 and 15 years old. I asked if they went to high school, but in both cases their parents didn't permit it. In Martha's case, her father believed that education was wasted on girls. It was more important for her to work. In Eliana's case, her mother was afraid she would be teased or harrassed by non-Hispanic classmates. In Even Start, they had the chance to be students again. Eliana is progressing well with her English and is planning to get a driver's license. She reads books with her two young sons every day. Martha had advanced more than any other student in that class, but she left the program to get a job. She plans for her own children, however, to graduate high school no matter what.  Those are the sorts of stories I wanted the Congressman to hear, but he didn't have time to listen, and they weren't my stories to tell him, anyway.

      I'm not, thank heavens, prone to insomnia, but I've definitely gotten a feel for the toll it must take on the mind and body from the occasional sleep deprivation my son requires of me.  Last night, for instance, he had a major wardrobe malfunction.  He woke up fussy around 4:00 a.m. and he was soaking wet - his clothes, his bedding, himself.  So, after stripping him, replacing the faulty diaper, and wiping him down, I brought him in bed with me.  It's pretty sweet to lie in bed next to a person you love and adore, but it's hard to sleep when that person is wide awake, grabbing your nose and trying to pry your mouth open.  I was still awake when my alarm went off at 5:30, but after that I settled into a nice, sound sleep that made me panic when I woke up later, almost late for work.  Fortunately, we're starting classes an hour late today because we're anticipating a visit from  urlLink Congressman Max Burns  at what would normally be our lunch hour.  The visit is the result of a letter writing campaign our students engaged in recently.  Our program is scheduled to be cut from the federal budget, so we're soliciting our legislators' support.   urlLink Senator Saxby Chambliss  scheduled a visit earlier, but he just sent a guy from his office.

       Great news yesterday  - my boss isn't leaving after all!  I couldn't believe anyone else wouldn't hire her, but apparently, she didn't have enough or the right experience for the job.  But, yay for me!    The reasons she's an excellent boss, from my point of view, are pretty much the following:  She has  urlLink people skills . She doesn't micromanage - she hires people she trusts, and then  urlLink trusts  them. She's in  urlLink a good mood  way, way more often than not. She's receptive to  urlLink feedback . She backs up her staff in any conflict. She supports the program so much that she hires graduates to fill positions whenever possible. She frequently  urlLink rewards  me with praise for my teaching!    For all that she's earned my loyalty and devotion.  I just have to figure out how to keep working for her until I retire. . .   Some etymological meandering:   The word " urlLink boss " comes from Dutch  baas , or master, and was first picked up in English in its usage as captain of a ship.    "Bossy," as a cow name, comes Latin  bos , which means cow.   Latin  bos  became Spanish  vaca , yielding also  vaquero , or cowboy.  The word " urlLink buckaroo " is an Americanized version of  vaquero .  (In Mexican Spanish, all v's are pronounced as "b.")  The word " urlLink banzai " is of Japanese origin and it is identified as a war cry.  It means, "May you live ten thousand years." I think that's a much nicer war cry than, say, "Die you commie bastards!"

      Recently, at a party, someone told me the story of  urlLink the suicide song .  We found an internet site that would play several versions, but she got nervous after awhile and told us to stop.  It reminded my friend of  urlLink the "Bloody Mary" legend  - how many times could you say it in front of a mirror?  I never got past twelve.  Of course, that's because a neighbor of a cousin of a girl in my fourth grade class died that way.    I've been reading essays from a book called  urlLink Computerization and Controversy , including  urlLink this one  about a disabled woman named Joan who was actually a male psychiatrist named Alex, and  urlLink this one  about the virtual crimes of the evil Mr. Bungle and his voodoo doll.  It seems like it could be very interesting to create a character and give it both life and relationships in some sort of on-line forum, but I've never done anything like that.  I went to a yahoo chat room once, just to see what it was like, and it was very boring.  Of course, I could have probably made some new friends with a little effort, like  urlLink Cartman did on South Park .

      In lieu of going to see Mel Gibson's ultra-violent movie, I'm reading the book  urlLink Jesus: A Revolutionary Biography  by John Dominic Crossan.  (I'm with Sandy - if i'm going to see an ultra-violent movie, there'd better be a flesh-eating zombie in it.) It's a very interesting book, and I've learned all kinds of things that I somehow missed in Sunday school.  Unfortunately, I don't have the book beside me to accurately quote it, but some of the little linguistic or cultural details stood out in my mind. For instance:  The titular phrase The Son of Man is a translation of a word that simply meant "mankind," or "human beings," rather than a singular entity.  The word translated as "leprosy" did not at the time refer to  urlLink Hansen's disease  but rather to any sort of visible skin disease, like psoriasis.  Jesus was infamous for dining with "tax collectors and prostitutes" - those words referred to any people of an unacceptable social class.  "Prostitute" specifically referred to any woman alone, outside of a man's control.  "Suffer the little children to come unto me." Maybe for the modern reader "little children" connotates innocence or helplessness.  But Crossan suggests that, according to the culture of the time, children were worthless, were not people, and could be killed or cast aside by their fathers (as often happened to baby girls).  So rather than calling for the young and the innocent, he was calling for those deemed worthless by society.  If only President Bush had read this book before the 2000 Republican debates, he could have come up with a more intelligent  urlLink response  about his favorite political philosopher.

      On Video  My face is still tear-streaked from a recent viewing of  urlLink Finding Nemo  with my class.  Fortunately, every time I thought I was going to lose it, Ellen Degeneres (memory-impaired Dory) would say something hilarious, and I would have to laugh instead.  But why do so many kids' movies have dead parents in them?? Bambi, The Lion King, Nemo come to mind.  Also, I recently watched the first four episodes of  urlLink 24, Season One .  Some months ago, I was at a party, chatting with some strangers, and the topic of tv came up.  And this one guy said he'd gotten hooked on 24, and actually sat up all night one night trying to finish Season One on video.  I'm not big on complicated political thrillers, but sure enough, I had the same reaction.  I meant to watch just one, but I was glued to the tv for four episodes straight.  I've just ordered the rest on Netflix, but I'm going to have to wait awhile.

       Puzzle   My husband found me  urlLink this fun-with-words site  which reminded me to post the only puzzle I've ever made.  A prize of some sort to anyone who solves it:  What do these ten words have in common?  apt them throb whale height formal element paisley ornament Malaysia  Here are some clues (with extra words):  them and they and than, not thin height and eight and sleight, not weight whale and shale, not stale formal and Furman, not format  Any guesses?  If not, I'll list more words and clues tomorrow.   Baby's Big Day   The baby was baptised in the Lutheran church this morning, a decision I agonized over and my husband acquiesced to.  Now that it's done, I'm so glad we did it.  The happiness in my mother's eyes, for one thing, made it worthwhile.  And in following the ritual, the baby was recognized publicly as an individual person and welcomed into a community.  He's guaranteed even more people in his life who will, if nothing else, be kind to him. That was one thing I always appreciated about church when I was a kid: the social barriers between adolescents were considerably loosened there and I don't remember any kid ever getting picked on or bullied.  Even the most socially graceless among us were tolerated better by churchmates than by classmates.  I don't know if that experience was typical.  But church always seemed like a pretty safe environment for me. And I learned to read music and sing harmonies there. It's not my church's or my parents' fault that I grew up without faith.  And that's the hard part about promising, in the baptism service, to bring up the baby in the church and teach him the Bible and all that.  I'm thinking about how - or if - we can keep that promise in a non-hypocritical way. Anyway, the baby did us proud, looking entirely adorable in his little white satin suit.  He didn't cry at any moment during the ceremony, although he made some comments.  At one point, Grandma held a candle that accompanied the words "Let your light so shine before others. . ." and it was funny to see the baby's immediate enthusiasm over a new dangerous thing.  Pretty fire!!  Here, let me grab that flame, please.  His other grandparents drove up from Gray to join us, and that made it a doubly special day.   More 24   Like the excellent parents we are, we completely ignored the baby for the whole afternoon while we watched four more episodes of 24!  TV just doesn't get any better.  Season 2 is following Season 1's plot formula: introduce a couple of crises in the first hour and resolve them by mid-season, when an Even Bigger Crisis emerges. Some of the performances (especially Palmer's and Lady Mac's) are starting to feel a little monotonous, though. I hope they change facial expression and tone of voice at least once before the end of season 2.

      At last to blog again. . .   Baby   The baby is sleeping peacefully.  Our current solution is to hold him down till he falls asleep.  As long as he's able to stand up, he won't stay down voluntarily.  He complains, but in the end, he complies.  Yesterday was my first full day with my nine-month-old.  It was very different from the months of maternity leave when he slept most of the time.  Now he only sleeps when compelled to and spends the day in motion.  I tempt him with his colorful, musical, educational toys, and he shows far more interest in bits of dried leaves and snarls of dog hair he picks off the carpet. His favorite toy that I've given him to play with is a large black slotted spoon.  And nothing, nothing is more attractive than a telephone cord!  If you were sitting on my living room floor right now, you might think, wow, what a clean, uncluttered space.  But if you stood up, you would notice a huge mess at eye level:  shoes on top of the tv set, newspapers and skeins of yarn piled on the mantel, and the double cords of the blinds draped and hanging like old, torn spider webs.  It doesn't look so good.  But it is a delight watching the baby explore and learn stuff.  Today, he discovered record albums propped between the wall and the stereo.  It was a good opportunity to introduce him to James Taylor and  urlLink Eye to Eye .    NPR   I'd like to say a public thank you to  urlLink National Public Radio  for showering me with gifts!  I recently succumbed to a pledge drive and offered what I thought was a very modest pledge of $15 a month.  They were advertising some gifts "at the $75 level," so I figured that didn't include me.  But the lady on the phone asked if I wanted the Jazz CD or the Classical CD.  I gleefully requested the Jazz CD after making sure she really thought I deserved something.  Some weeks later, I got a small package with a note that the gift I requested was out of stock, so please accept this replacement gift until the CDs are reordered.  And it was an FM radio you wear in your ear - a really useful, wonderful little thing.  I thought I'd been thanked sufficiently, but another package arrived in the mail.  A bright blue NPR umbrella.  And they didn't stop there.  A few days ago I finally got my 2 CD jazz collection.  I feel like I should send more money. Thanks, NPR.   More 24   It took me a few episodes to get sucked in to season 2.  It wasn't the instant love affair I had with season 1.  And yet, this may be a more mature and enduring love, fostered in part by the hilarious, side-splitting commentary of  urlLink Gustave  (also known as  urlLink Matthew P. Erlich ). Without giving away any spoilers for Sandy, I'll limit myself to commenting on  urlLink Daniel Dae Kim , formerly an evil lawyer at Wolfram & Hart, now a CTU agent.  Hi, Daniel.  It's good to see those cheekbones working again.   Food   I usurped my husband's place in front of the grill tonight and grilled us some "Tandoori Chicken."  I'd lost Sandy's recipe and instead combined a couple I found on the internet.  I used boneless chicken breasts, slashed them, and marinated them in lemon juice for a couple of hours.  Then I mixed: a cup of plain yogurt, a teaspoon each of powdered ginger, cinnamom, cumin, cardamom, turmeric, paprika, salt, ground black peppercorns, and cayenne pepper, and a dash of nutmeg. Added that to the chicken and lemon juice. I would have used garlic but my spouse almost doesn't eat it. I left it in the fridge for a few hours, then cooked the chicken on the grill for about 20 minutes. It was SO good.  I also roasted some veggies (yellow pepper, eggplant, asparagus, squash, red onion) with olive oil, lemon juice, salt and pepper.  Wound up with a great big bowl of nutrition.  I'm starting today another low-carb diet to undo some of the damage I've done over the past months.

      8:45 p.m. and the battle begins.  The baby who used to sleep soundlessly for at least 8 hours at a stretch can now stand up in his crib. Last night, I went to bed at 11:00 and he was up and crying at midnight.  I put him in bed with me till he dropped off to sleep, then put him back in the crib.  That lasted till 3:00 a.m.  I did the same thing, except he didn't go back to sleep for at least an hour.  Instead he was writhing and squirming and flailing about.  We both got to sleep sometime after 4:00.  So, I decided this just isn't working anymore.  He's standing up in his crib now, crying his heart out.  I'll give him five minutes, then I'll try again to settle him down.  I got him to settle down briefly with the pacifier (contrary to wisdom of book) but already he's crying again.  This time, he can go for seven minutes.    So, this blog has been inactive of late because last Wednesday, I decided to crochet a blanket for my cousin's baby shower on Sunday.  I wasn't actually sure it was possible, and I worked on it every spare moment and in fact finished it as we were parking the car outside the host's house on Sunday afternoon. The baby is a girl and the blanket is blue and white.  My cousin read a story about the use of blue for boys:  at a time of high infant mortality, mothers would wrap their baby boys in blue, the color of heaven, so that God would see them and protect them.  Rejecting the traditional sexist model of color-coding, my cousin wished to wrap her own baby in a blanket the color of the sky.  I was really happy that upon opening my gift, she exclaimed, "A blue sky with clouds."  I had been a little worried that she might have told that story to a lot of people, thus eliciting many varieties of blue blanket, but mine was the only one.  I feel like a heartless bastard.  The poor little guy doesn't know why he's been abandonned.  In the short run, I feel selfish, protecting my own sleep at his expense.  But in the long run, a person needs to know how to go to sleep by him or herself.  Anyway, that blanket project ended on Sunday, so why no blog till now?  I got sick.  And the baby got sick.  And the baby radically changed his attitude toward sleep.    I got him down again at seven minutes, but damn, there he goes again.  This is a nightmare.  His daddy is going in there now to offer some comfort.  I'm going to walk the dog while my husband listens to the heartbroken sobs and frantic screams.  He says he's more cold hearted than I am.  Maybe he'll be sound asleep when I get back, fingers crossed.  I need to update my blog profile because as of Sunday, I'm now officially 38 years old.

       More 24   Yesterday, I was watching the first two episodes of 24, Season 2 while the sleepish baby fussed and my husband operated power tools in the kitchen.  Consequently, halfway through the second episode I realized I didn't have a clue what was going on.  Instead of giving up and watching it all over again, I checked out the  urlLink recaps  at  urlLink Television Without Pity , my new favorite website.  I'd been there before, but this was my first time to read  urlLink Gustave , who belongs on my list of funniest writers ever.  The only thing about TWoP is that it takes almost as much time to read the recap as it does to watch the show - they're exceedingly thorough.  But funny as hell.  Which makes a refreshing take on a show that has no intentional humor in it whatsoever.

       Malign   I  urlLink maligned  hotmail in my last post.  Sorry, hotmail.  My problem was local, not with you at all.    I love the word malign, just for the way it sounds.  I never knew its etymology before looking it up just now.  It contains the obvious piece "mal-" meaning bad (malicious, malevolent, malady, etc.) and the surprising bit "gn-" of the root "genus," meaning birth or kind.  That root (Indo-European "*gen-") has sent forth tons of words including the following:      benign    gender    genteel    genre      gene    general    gentile    gentle      generate    generic    homogeneous    heterogeneous      generous    genesis    kin    kind      genitals    genitive    kindred    king      nitrogen    oxygen    progeny    ontogeny

       You Get What You Pay For   I haven't been able to access hotmail since last Thursday. Since I went out of town, I didn't worry about it all weekend, but now I'm worried about it.  I'm worried that tomorrow my account will be maxed out with  urlLink foreign spam .   Birthday   So, since I can't send an email, I'll take this opportunity to reiterate a happy birthday wish for Sandy, who will be 40 years old really, really soon (but I forgot the date.)  Her party on Friday occasioned a trip to Hartselle, Alabama, which is a pretty place and, at least on that Friday, full of loud and happy sky-divers.  When grounded, they will dive into swimming pools and (metaphorically) bottles of beer.  It was a great party, mainly because I got to spend time with Sandy and see her family, whom I've known for many years now.  And the cat, Vasquez, who is the friendliest cat I've ever met.   Books   I've had two of the three  urlLink George R. R. Martin books  in a drawer for several years, ever since my cousin passed them along to me.  I finally started reading them after other people (Sandy and Helly) mentioned them.  I'm into the second book now and planning to filch the third from my cousin's bookshelf.  I'm totally hooked by the characters - I like that it's written with enough ambiguity that I find myself rooting for (or sometimes condemning) both sides at once.     Baby   The baby is sleeping now with his little hands thrown over his face.  I just had to take the stuffed leopard off his face where he was clutching it.  He likes to burrow his face into something soft, like my armpit or his leopard, when he goes to sleep. I ask him if he's worried about suffocating himself, but he just pushes his face against the soft thing a little more emphatically.  So I guess that means no.

       Horror     I just had to call Mom to hear that my little son is safe and sound.  A friend came by earlier to ask for my help.  She and her husband were having problems and separated.  They made arrangements for him to have their 18-month-old daughter on certain days.  He called her a week ago, while he had the daughter, and asked her to get back together with him.  When she turned him down, he said, "I'm leaving and taking the baby."  And she hasn't seen him or her daughter now for a week.  He could be in California, where he has a brother, he could be hanging around here some place, he could have gone back to Mexico.  She has no idea.  And the police can't help her because he was entirely within in his rights.  At first, she couldn't do anything.  She couldn't eat or sleep or do anything but sit in the dark and cry.  Today, she and her sister decided that it was time to take some action.  I contacted a lawyer and I'm waiting to hear from her about an appointment.  At least she can apply for custody and have a basis for getting the police involved.  In Mexico, if someone says that someone else lacks education ("falta educacion"), they mean home training.  They mean, "He doesn't act right."  My friend's whole family lacks scholastic education except for the youngest, above, who graduated high school.  But they all have excellent home training, the sisters and the brothers as well.  The two brothers are fine men, kind and trustworthy and have never been cruel to anyone.  But the women didn't choose husbands like their brothers.  Of the six sisters, at least five of them married macho bastards who have tormented them in various ways.  Why???

       Mystery Revealed!    Last night, we watched the baby scoot himself across the room to his daddy's outstretched arms, thus revealing the secret of his mobility.  And along with mobility comes increasing independence - I don't know if I'm ready for it. Already he's wanting to choose his own  urlLink t-shirt logos .     Mean Girls    I saw  urlLink Mean Girls  last weekend, not because I was longing for a teen movie, but because  urlLink Tina Fey  wrote the screenplay, and I counted on it to be intelligent and funny.  And parts of it were, but overall, well - it took itself seriously enough that you had to criticize it for not being very credible.  But the point it was making about the cruelty of "girl-on-girl crime" was on target, as I remember it.  I preferred Margaret Atwood's novel on that subject,  urlLink Cat's Eye .    Pernicious Words    Sandy's blog gave us pernicious, which craftly embodies the root "necis" (violent death), as she pointed out.  Related roots are "necare" (to kill), "nocere" (to hurt or harm), and "noxa" (harm or injury).  Thus we have . . .    necromancy -  divination by communication with the dead    necrophilia - the dictionary doesn't define it, just sites its reference in  Psychopathis Sexualis !   necrosis -  death of bodily tissue    nectar -  drink of the gods  (from "nec" - death, and "tar" - overcoming)   nectarine -  nectar-like peach    noxious -  harmful, causing injury    obnoxious -  offensive and hateful, although originally, subject to harm.   (I think a very obnoxious person, still today, is probably subject to harm.)

       Lingo & Jargon   I was looking for more references on the web to sundown syndrome, and found  urlLink ENW's Emergi-Lexicon:  A Compendium of those pithy phrases of Emergency Jargon and regional variations of terminology!   I enjoyed learning expressions like the following:    Fascinoma: (noun) An obscure, curious, or medically exciting condition which incites a great deal of attention, often from many doctors ("hey, look at this"), to the process rather than to the human concern for the patient afflicted with the problem. Also known as a "Great Case."   "Tape Boogers": (noun) Remnants upon the skin of old adhesive residue from tape or monitoring electrodes. May sometimes be of nearly archeological age.   Zebras: (noun) Rare diagnoses, as in the classic aphorism to consider consider common diseases most probable: "If you hear thundering hoofbeats behind you, it's more likely to be horses than zebras!"     Update   My cousin is now living in the Grandview Nursing Home.  The doctor who released him from the hospital gave us an exhaustive list of his ailments and no hope whatsoever of a recovery.  He mentioned all of these things, and I've probably forgotten some: severely limited circulation (there is apparently no circulation in his legs, and he is "not a candidate for surgery), impaired kidney function, emphysema and chronic bronchitis (he's been a heavy smoker for about 50 years), low blood pressure, and malnourishment - that last one, at least, may be changing now that he's getting three meals a day.  The doctor gave us a grim prognosis, but I doubt his prediction has much validity, since he's not looking at a single disease with a predictable process.  Last night, my cousin was having that sundown syndrome again, and called my mother to bust him out of the place, speaking in a hushed voice, "Listen very carefully.  You have to come here now and get me out of here.  If I stay here, they are going to starve me to death.  They're going to kill me."  My mom and my brave husband answered the summons and helped him understand that there was really no place else for him to go. He was angry and miserable last night, but merely grumpy when I saw him this morning, and even sort of happy in the afternoon when Mom visited and he was informed that the cafeteria was serving Hamburger Helper sandwiches for dinner.  I hope that he will still find some moments of pleasure in his life.     A Happier Note   I spent a very pleasant afternoon with Lachele talking about stuff related to her work and my work and also her friend, the Conservative Catholic Gun-Lover.  It reminded me of an old  urlLink SNL  sketch, with Phil Hartman, about the Gay Communist Gun Club.  Phil Hartman did many funny things, but did you know he inspired the  urlLink Hartmanizer ?   Baby Stuff   The baby is getting more mobile by the minute - today he moved from the coffee table to the chair to the coffee table to the couch.  It was only a few feet, but he had to let go of one support before grabbing onto another.  I was so proud of him!   And tomorrow is Mother's Day - my very first one to celebrate as a mom!  I'm so excited, even though I'm not expecting a big present or anything.  I mean, we haven't even started giving him an allowance yet, so unless he tries to sell off some of his toys. . .  But I'm kind of hoping that his daddy will come up with a little something this time around.

       Sad News   My cousin, who was hospitalized with a broken hip awhile back, is not doing well at all.  After being released from the hospital, he was back in about a week later with unbearable pain in his legs.  They found that his electrolytes were very low, and verified that he has almost no circulation in his legs at all.  The circulation issue has been worsening gradually for years, but we don't understand why only at this time, it's become a crisis.  He has pressure wounds on the back of his feet that may never heal.  Last night and tonight, he started exhibiting  urlLink sundown syndrome .  Tonight he was Alexander the Great, he was living in Mexico, he was looking for some long lost brothers, and he asked my mother (his aunt) to marry him.  She turned him down, but fortunately, he didn't get too upset about it.

       24  I finished Season One of 24 last night - my husband had already fast-forwarded through the last dvd, so he kept inventing spurious endings for the characters, pretending to spoil it for me.  What a great series, though!  I would like to give it a prize.  Sandy, don't read the spoilers - you'll ruin some really good surprises.  I just ordered Season 2 from  urlLink Netflix  and prioritized it.  I can't wait.   Sluts and Frigid Cows  A friend of mine posted her results from The Slut Test at  urlLink The Spark.Com  on her blog, and the topic just reawakened my resentment that this family of words from whore to slut to tease to prude to frigid bitch are all words about women's sexuality.  We make a basic assumption about the male sex drive and leave it at that.  To call a man a slut sounds funny or cute.  To call a woman a slut is generally offensive.  But the opposite extreme sounds equally uncomplimentary.  Is it worse to be a slut or a prude?  To paraphrase a  urlLink movie  quote, with whom and how often a person has sex is nobody's business but his or her own!  Maybe I've been reading too much  urlLink Ms. Magazine  lately, but it bothers me.     Porn  I shouldn't read that magazine because it just depresses me, but for some reason I picked one up the last time I was at Border's.  There was an article about pornography that surprised me.  I've never been a big consumer of porn.  In fact, I've only seen one adult movie in my whole life (not counting scrambled Playboy Channel on somebody else's cable) and that movie was called Phone Sex Girls Part 2.  Fortunately, it wasn't necessary to have already seen Part 1 in order to follow the story.  The plot involved a balding, mustachiod guy having phone sex at the office, and the sex scenes were all the fantasies in his head from the conversation.  It was all bright lights and thudding disco music and the girls were very sparkly in their makeup and costumes.  The sex was all pretty standard stuff, just different positions, varying degrees of close-ups on the genitalia, and a little chick-on-chick action.  Everyone seemed to be having a pretty nice time.  But that was back in the 80s.  According to the Ms. article, the porn industry has had to really push the envelope, seeking the edge that people will pay for.  In your average adult film now, you can expect a lot of anal and double penetration, gag-inducing oral sex, and expressions of pain on the women's faces.  The pain may be acted, but it's part of what people are paying for.  And that was the most troubling part of it.

       Ads   I'm jealous and perplexed - Sandy got an ad for Hebrew Verb Tables on her blog!  Not only do they have conjugation tables for every verb in the Hebrew language, they offer talking faces -  urlLink the talking menorah  is somehow the spookiest of all.  Maybe this post will attract the ad to my page, fingers crossed.   If Wishes Were Horses   my ass would be really sore, and I'd be sneezing up a storm.  Aside from all the things I want for myself and my own, like a house to accomodate my mother and a nice preschool for the center of my universe and complete set of the  urlLink OED  with shelves to put them on, and, while I'm at it, the best possible Mac and its accoutrements for my beloved spouse, I really wish I could put my friend's daughter through college.  I met her when she was fourteen, and she's about to graduate high school with an excellent GPA.  She was voted Outstanding Student of her high school and given an award by the Optimist's Club.  When I met her, she spoke just a little English, and now, aside from a lilting accent, you'd think she'd lived here her whole life. She has worked so hard and overcome such obstacles as poverty, domestic violence, and illegal status in this country.  Most likely, she's going to be accepted by Armstrong College - it's one of the schools that doesn't require a social security number or a visa.  But the hurdle is paying the tuition.  She won't be eligible for the HOPE scholarship or any kind of federal financial aid.  She and her counsellor are working on it.  I hope they come up with something.   Par-Tay!   The baby attended his first birthday party on Saturday to celebrate Alan's niece Eliza turning 2.  I learned from Alan and his sister to get a cover for the sandbox if we ever buy him a sandbox; otherwise it'll just be "everybody's outdoor litterbox."  Thanks for that tip!

       Damn.   This morning, when I got on the new scales, which are less friendly than the old scales, I weighed a whopping hundred and something five pounds.  I'm starting a new diet today.   Work, Work, Work   I've been thinking about work and jobs.  I don't really expect my job to survive the 2005 budget, and even if it does, we'll have to write a new grant with a new administration, and the adult ed component could well be reduced or cut.  Lachele pointed out, optimistically, that not many people get to know a whole year in advance that they're losing their job.  It's a real advantage.  So, I've been thinking about what other jobs I could possibly do, and what are the important criteria for a job.  I've come up with these:  1. The job should involve skills at which I am competent.  There's nothing that makes me more miserable than a feeling of incompetence.  I'm grateful that I have a job I do well, and where other people treat me with respect for my skills.  When I had a job at K-Mart, my supervisor put on my evaluation that I was friendly to customers, but "a slow learner."  Very humiliating.  I cringe to this day.  I was also NOT very competent in the food service industry, nor very happy there.  And last summer, I confirmed that I'm not very good at all at keeping discipline in a middle school classroom.  2. The job should involve regular positive interactions with other people.  I've only wished to work in solitude when I didn't care for the people I worked with. The job should also not be frought with conflict!  There should be a minimum of negative interactions.   3. The job should allow for some creativity and autonomy because I'm not very very good at following directions.  4. The job should offer a salary that allows me to maintain or at least not drastically reduce our current lifestyle.  5. The job should allow me summers off and should end early in the day so that I can spend as much time with my son as possible!  6. Oh, yeah, and the job must be in or very near Athens, Georgia.  I really can't think of any job besides the job I already have that meets all those criteria.

      Last night I enabled the "comments" feature on my blog because I learned that it existed.     Sedaris   I took the car for its maiden voyage tonight, to see David Sedaris at the Border's in Buckhead.  My friend Kathy from Athens went with me, and we met Lachele and Alan and Helly, so it was quite the social event.  I had dinner with Kathy and Lachele at the Tavern at Phipps Plaza, and it was a perfect dinner that will stand out in my memory.  It sounds simple or maybe even trite: nachos with cheese, onions, peppers and cubes of chicken in a sweet barbecue sauce, but it food of the gods to me.  I have to go back.  Phipps Plaza is a very high class sort of mall.  It was austere.  Everything about it looks expensive.  And there were no children, no Hispanics, and no black people.  Except a family who were sitting outside, so they didn't count.  I was in high school the last time I was there, and I remember looking in a boutique that had lots of sale racks.  The rack was full of very small t-shirts, and I figured they might be cheap.  The sign on the sale rack advertised: $100 and UP.  The reading was very entertaining despite the overcrowding.  I laughed out loud many times.  He read some pages from his diary as well, so it was nice to hear some new material that I wouldn't have heard otherwise.  He talked about his habit of journal-keeping and commented that he is good at doing exactly the same thing at exactly the same time every day.  I wonder if touring is hard for him, disrupting his routine so much.  Sometimes I can get into a routine of something I want to do, like exercising or writing, and as long as I follow it, it really works for me.  But if I let go of it for just one day, I can't seem to get it back.  I was going to get him to sign my book, but the line was too long, and I couldn't handle the press of people - they weren't allowing me my little bubble of personal space.  The last time I saw him read, I got all my other books signed.  I had prepared in my mind what I would say to him for days - something witty that would make him pay attention to me and see that I really get him.  But of course, when I got up to the table, I was completely tongue-tied and muttered something inane about how nice it must be to live in France.  Gaaaah.   Book Recommendations   David Sedaris recommended  urlLink Random Family , and there was even a pile of them he was encouraging us to pick up on the way to get his book signed.  If I'd stood in line, I would probably have succumbed.  He made it sound fascinating.  Kathy recommended  urlLink Anil's Ghost  - a story about the civil was in Sri Lanka.  She also mentioned wanting to read  urlLink Reading Lolita in Tehran: A Memoir in Books.    Baby Stuff   We got the baby a push toy the other day - a thing he walks with by pushing it in front of him.  After his daddy put it together, he was presented with it, and he seemed to know exactly what to do.  He walked behind the toy until it hit the wall.  Then he dropped down to his knees and crawled away, in search of another amusement.  Things he likes: cords, especially phone cords and blinds cords; the cell phone; chewing paper; biting me; pulling things off a shelf; and the dog.  He has a big unrequited love for the dog. He smiles at her, he shows delight at her every sound and movement, and he tries to follow her around.  She, in return, avoids him, or turns and barks in his face.  He doesn't understand, and his little face seems puzzled after being barked at.  Things he dislikes: finger food, diaper changes, 5:30 in the morning,

       Car Wars   Well, not really.  Just a long, trying day car shopping with no actual car at the end of it.  We bought a car, but at the last minute, it was discovered the radio didn't work and couldn't be replaced till Monday.  He explained that I could easily drive back Monday morning (it's an hour and a half!) But after I whined about it, he actually offered to drive it to Athens for me.  I'm happy with the choice of car.  We got a  urlLink Saturn Ion 2 in gold , automatic transmission, with these extras: ABS and a CD player.  I was tempted by keyless entry, but that was bundled with a rather expensive power package, and I didn't care about any of the rest of it.  The price was okay because they gave us a GM loyalty discount of $3000 plus a $500 incentive plus, I think, additional money off for the 790 miles it already had on it as a demo car. We understood we were getting that *and* 0% financing until we went into the money guy's office.  Then it turned out it was one or the other. I'm sure when they send me the survey, I'll give the salesguy good marks because he did his job and most of my complaints had to do with me being tired and stressed out.  But let me vent here for a moment.    First of all, okay, I was with my husband, but I made it a point to introduce myself as the owner of the deceased Saturn and the primary shopper for a new Saturn.  But at first it seemed that the salesguy addressed my husband exclusively, looking to his eyes when answering my questions!  My husband didn't notice this, so maybe I'm paranoid, but that's not my tendency.  I griped about it when salesguy was, I think, out of earshot, but after that, he seemed to address a bit more of his talk to me, so maybe he heard.  It also annoyed me that when it was time to do the paperwork, salesguy automatically put my husband's name first (I want him as co-owner in case I die or something, and because we share all financial things, but in practice, it is MY car.)  The same thing happened with the previous Saturn, so all communication from Saturn came to my husband's name, the registration was in his name, etc.  I commented I think three times that I wanted my name to be first before he said, "Oh, I can have that changed if you want."  Hey, that would be great!  Later, in the money guy's office, as he was explaining their policy, I realized I'd abandonned the checkbook at the salesguy's desk.  I excused myself to fetch it, and he kept on explaining, so I had to ask, "Could you wait, please?"  *Sigh*  I was really REALLY tired by this time.  Part of it was disappointment that I wasn't going to get my old car back, and that's what I really wanted.  But even in the best circumstances, it bugs me when I feel like I'm being treated like a girl in a professional situation.  I told my mom about it, and she sympathized with the communication part - when the man gets the answers to the woman's  questions.  But the name on the paperwork part she thought was a trivial complaint.  She said that's just the custom, putting the man's name first, like saying Mr. and Mrs. instead of Mrs. and Mr.  So, from now on, I would like any mail to the two of us addressed "Ms. and Mr. Nancy Heiges."  Thanks.  I should add that the day was broken by a really pleasant interlude when we had lunch with Alan and Lachele at Doc Chey's, and met up with my pregnant cousin and her partner to give them the bassinett.  They were happy with it, and we have two more feet of space in the house.  Woo-hoo!

       Baby Words   Sometimes he gets  sleepish,  and you can tell because that's when he's most  crysome.    Nappish  and  cryful  are alternatives.   Slam!   The New Yorker had a scathing review of  urlLink Eats, Shoots & Leaves , pointing out all the punctuation mistakes and inconsistencies in the author's own writing.  Now I'll have to go back and reread it with a red pen.     Feeling Spendy?   On NPR the other day, I heard about  urlLink Women For Women International , a relief organization designed to help women survive things like rape, torture, and war in general.  It sounds like they do good work.

       Word of the Day   Chronotype, cited at  urlLink Word Spy : "The set of circadian factors that determine whether someone is a morning person or an evening person."  I've always considered myself a morning person, but according to  urlLink this test , I'm but a "moderate lark."  The citation referenced an article claiming that night owls drink more alchohol and coffee and smoke more cigarettes than morning people.  Just like  urlLink the French .   Movie   I recently rented and watched  urlLink The Station Agent , a movie starring  urlLink Peter Dinklage , who played "the angry elf" in the Will Farrell movie  urlLink Elf .  The Station Agent was a quiet little movie, a story of unexpected friendship among three dissimilar people.  Dinklage played an introverted train geek who inherits an abandonned depot in a small town in New Jersey and moves there.  Another one of the characters is a woman who is grieving for her young son who died, and that made it really hard for me to watch.  Apart from that, I enjoyed the movie, particularly Dinklage's portrayal of "a simple, boring person," who has suffered a lot from being a dwarf.   Walkabout   Kristal did a  urlLink Monday Walkabout , visiting and reviewing other blogs, so I'll give it a try as well, using the recently updated blogs listed on blogger.   urlLink Listology . This is a blog for Sandy.  It's all about movies and stuff, and anyone can submit their own list to the site.  urlLink  One Of A Kind Project , by someone named Beeworks.  I checked two posts and they both had recipes.  But I think it's about art.  I'm confused.   urlLink The Left-Handed Leftist .  I guess nobody who reads my blog is going to enjoy this one very much.  I don't mind its totally liberal slant, but I do mind sentences like this: ". . .their jazzabilly surfstrumentals are bite-size twangfests."  I looked at others, but they were not good.

       Shoot!   I spent an interesting day in the mountains on Saturday learning to shoot guns.  It's not an activity I would have sought out, but for the second time, I accepted an invitation.  The first time I went shooting, I was with Helly and her friend Cheryl, and we were firing pistols at an indoor range.  We were halfway done before I had gotten used to the noise (even with ear protection), and my shooting really sucked.  I enjoyed the company, but I admit I left thinking, this sport isn't for me. So, I was anticipating the Women On Target course that Lachele invited me to with a little trepidation.  It was going to be a whole day's worth of being outdoors in the heat (bad enough), shooting at targets again.  But this second experience was better than the first.  This time, I had a professional instructor, Bob, teaching me how to hold the gun and how to use the sights to aim, and the lesson paid off.  I fired at a picture of a pig a short distance in front of me, and I hit the picture every time.  And it was much smaller than an actual pig!  I also got to fire a rifle and a shotgun.  The rifle had a telescopic sight and I fired it sitting down at a table.  The shotgun was more fun. I held it standing up and shot at a flying orange disc, like a bright little UFO.  I didn't hit it even once, but firing that gun made me feel like I'd really done something.  Oh, yeah, and the weather up in the mountains was actually pleasant.    Interestly, the organizer of the course was a woman, but all the instructors were men.  The men and the women sat on opposite ends of the classroom space and had different roles, so there was this unexpected segregation.  Except for one very young woman, possibly college age or younger, most of the students were older than me.  Or at least looked older than me.  Of course, I often meet women my age who I would guess to be much older because of the triad of matronliness: about 30 extra pounds, short (possibly permed) hair, and a style of clothing that says emphatically, "I'm done with both fashion and sex appeal." All my friends in my general age range, like Lachele, Helly, Sandy, and Nadine have avoided that trap and look very young and attractive. All the people at the course were white, which was no big surprise.  I didn't get a chance to talk with anyone else because I wasn't in a sufficiently extraverted mood and was content just to talk to Lachele.  It would have been interesting to hear other people's reasons for being there and their interest in guns.  During the lesson part of the course, Carol emphasized that we were there to learn about sport shooting and not self-defense.  I found that comforting.  I like guns a lot less when I'm reminded that their primary function is to kill people.  Or animals.  But they're not so threatening when they take on the role of an expensive toy.  And the shooting was fun!  But I missed my husband and the baby who were home without me.  That was the only downside of the day, being two hours away from my little family, and out of reach of cellular service.

       "!;??/!"   You remember how when  urlLink Vizzini  said, "Inconceivable!"   urlLink Inigo Montoya  said, "I no think that word means what you think it means"?    That's how I feel whenever I hear someone say that the city was decimated by the attack. Because I think they mean destroyed or devastated or demolished, confusing that negative prefix "de-" (meaning all kinds of stuff like down, away from, undoing, etc.) with the prefix "decim-" (from  decimus , meaning "tenth.")  Lynne Truss, who wrote  urlLink Eats, Shoots, & Leaves , described one of her favorite cartoons:  "[The cartoon] shows a row of ten Roman soldiers, one of them prone on the ground, with the cheerful caption (from a survivor of the cull), "Hey, this decimation isn't as bad as they say it is!"  I got this book for my birthday, and I'm just getting around to reading it.  I'm finding it really interesting and charmingly written.  She encourages the reader to identify with their inner stickler.  For sticklers and freewheelers alike, the book is full of interesting little tidbits like the following:    The O' in Irish names (like O'Malley) isn't a contraction of "of," (like bucket o' chicken).  It's "an anglicization of  ua , meaning grandson."  Isn't that good to know?   And the word apostrophe is from the Greek "turning away," and originally was used only for an omission of letters.  That got started in the 16th century, and then it started separating out the possessive -s in the 17th century.      I usually ignore my inner stickler, favoring a more descriptive than prescriptive approach to the way other people use language.  (When my students complain about Southern accents or slang their coworkers use or worry that they're not learning "correct English," I tell them, "Try to talk  like  who you want to talk  with .") Because there's just so many variations that really work in different contexts.  I intentionally do lots of stuff that I once learned was wrong.  Like write in fragments.  Or start a sentence with a conjunction.  Or use "there's" as a plural, instead of "there are," or the sort of drunk sounding "there're."  However, I have to admit that although I happily bend and break the grammatical rules to suit myself, I do sometimes react to other people's mistakes.  Sometimes, I react with a stickler's cringe, but more often, I just enjoy a fleeting sense of superiority.      However, that last fleeting moment over the word  urlLink decimate  already fled because when I looked it up at dictionary.com, the first meaning given was "To destroy or kill a large part of a group." A stickler really has to keep up with the times.   Baby Stuff   The baby put a piece of bread in his mouth for the first time today!  Woo-hoo!  I've been giving him crust after crust of bread which just end up mashed in his fingers and dropped on the floor.  He's very particular about what he will try to ingest.  It pretty much has to be a familiar beverage, baby food out of a jar, or any piece of trash he can scavenge off the floor or behind the furniture.    Apparently he's already a Monty Python fan.  His daddy called him  urlLink a knight who says "ne."   It's one of his favorite syllables, along with "da" and "muh." I'm a little jealous that friends' babies of a similar age are already saying words.  I can hardly wait to hear what he will say to me.  Probably a lot of "no" for awhile.  But if he comes up with anything half as cute as  urlLink All My Happy , I'll be overjoyed.

       Fans   So, a couple people wrote and mentioned being fans themselves, and I didn't mean to be criticizing fans in writing about the German DiStiple.  I've had my share of celebrity crushes.  I just don't confuse them with reality.  Case in point, I wrote a fan letter recently to my favorite TWoP recapper, Gustave.  But it's not like I'm going to move to New York and stalk him.  I mean, if I went to New York, it would be simply because cool people like Gustave live there, so it's an interesting place to hang out.  And if I rented a room within sight of his apartment building, which I'm sure any decent private investigator could point out, it would be because that's the coolest possible neighborhood to find a room in.  And if I actually met him, by standing outside his door day and night till he comes home, with a bottle of wine and original poetry and - and one of those designer chairs he likes so much, it wouldn't be some sick fantasy of trying to "cure" a gay man.  It would be about real connection, about kindred souls, about not putting people in your stupid little boxes, okay?   Go, Gwen!   Seriously, I bought an AJC today to read a front page story about former ACC mayor and DFACS director Gwen O'Looney.  She was recently  urlLink fired  from her position at DFACS for reasons unspecified, but it did come out that on two occasions, she ordered someone to flush marijuana down the toilet rather than call the cops on a fifteen-year-old girl she was working with.  She suspects that those incidents had to do with her firing.  The law says that DFACS workers are supposed to report any suspected case of drug use or possession, and an offending teen might get sentenced to home probation and counselling, drug rehab, or juvenile detention.  Gwen said, "My job is to save children, not jail them."  She said that she might think twice if faced with a similar situation in the future, but concluded adamantly, "I still believe I did the right thing."  Good for you, Gwen!    The police, of course, believe that reporting is in a child's best interest, in that they can be put into counselling or rehab.  I really take issue with the notion that mere possession of any quantity of a drug implies a problem needing treatment.  If you raided my house today, you'd find at least three bottles of alcoholic beverage - more than the pot they found in the girl's house.  But no one has ever suggested that I should check myself into Charter, or even attend a meeting!  I'm not as drug-positive as some people I know - I've only tried marijuana, and it never did anything for me that I actually enjoyed.  And it doesn't seem to me like a benefit to society to in any way encourage or facilitate the use of, say, heroine or crack.  But still, if I were King of America, I'd never put anybody in jail for having or using drugs.  I'd treat drugs like alcohol and cigarettes - keep them out of the hands of minors as much as possible, and do lots of "this stuff is bad for your health" public service announcements. I'll have to make an "if I ruled the world" list like Sandy's.  Hers was really good.     24   I finally finished Season 2, and now have to wait for Season 3 to come out on dvd. Season 2 was a different experience.  The first time around, I was enthralled, on the edge of my seat, watching episode after episode, unable to leave my couch until I'd exhausted my supply of story.  Season 2 just didn't have as good a plot, but in some respects it was even more entertaining because I started laughing at it.  The first time around, it didn't even register that it was like the most serious, humorless fiction I'd ever watched.  The second time around, guided by the wit of Gustave, I couldn't help but make fun of the characters in my head constantly.  Season 2 ended with a cliffhanger, so I hope they are merciful with a quick release of Season 3.

       Are You Being Saved?   You know how you can talk with a person and for the longest time, they seem perfectly normal?  And then they say something that just totally changes that perception?  Back in the late nineties, I was in The Globe one evening and ran into a guy I knew who introduced me to the girl he was sitting with.  She was a tourist from Germany who had travelled on her own to Athens because she liked the music scene here.  She'd found a cheap room in a motel and walked downtown every night.  I was impressed with her independence, and we talked for the longest time.  And then, Michael Stipe entered the conversation.  Wow.  It turned out that, although she had never met him, she was in love with Michael Stipe, had come here only to be close to him, and planned to stay in Athens as long as possible to try to bask in the glow of his aura.  She recited in meticulous detail every Stipe-sighting she'd ever had and became near-orgasmic in the recollection of a brief exchange they once had there in that very bar.  It was Michael Stipe this and Michael Stipe that for the rest of the evening, and it was interesting how my perception of her changed throughout the conversation from "interesting person" to "interesting anthropological subject" to "person I'd like to stop talking with."  It wasn't the first time I'd heard the name Michael Stipe spoken with religious awe, just the most repetition of it in a single conversation.  In the movie "Saved," produced by Michael Stipe, religious fervor is a subject for humor.  I'd heard about the movie on one of the Conservative News Networks; the topic was whether the movie was offensive to Christians.  I don't know what the final answer was, but it was enough to make me want to see the movie.  And it was really good!  It definitely poked fun at a certain type of Evangelical Christian for whom the religion seems as much a fashion statement and speech habit as anything else, and two of the sympathetic characters were not Christians.  Still, though, it wasn't a mean-spirited movie at heart.  The sympathetic characters were good people who were trying to be moral, just not in the narrow framework espoused by American Eagle Christian School.  Macauley Culkin had the best lines in the movie.  At one point, he and his Jewish girlfriend were sitting in a cafe, and they saw the protagonist (who got knocked up trying to save her gay boyfriend from sin) coming out of Planned Parenthood.  Jewish girlfriend commented, "There's only one reason nice Christian girls go there," with a smirk.  Macauley said, "She's planting a pipe bomb??"  I like him better as a sarcastic teenager than a cute kid.  In the movie, a group of popular Christian girls devoted themselves to saving others.  I remember that really vividly from school.  Actually, there's a family story.  My maternal grandmother didn't go to church.  When she was a teenager, she went to a revival with some friends and when it came time for the invitation - the moment when the preacher asks the unsaved to come down front and accept Jesus into their hearts - her friends started pushing her forward, drawing attention to her and asking why she didn't want to accept Jesus.  The story is, she turned and ran out the door and never set foot in a church again for many, many years.  My mother, however, was taken to church as a child, and for her own reasons, found it to be a pretty traumatic experience.  She would leave church feeling pretty sure that she was going to hell, just because she was female, because women and their short skirts and makeup lead men into sin.  When I was about seven, my parents joined the Lutheran Church, a bit of an anomoly in the South.  It wasn't an evangelical style of religion, and no one ever talked about getting saved.  There was no invitation in the book of worship.  But I learned about all of that from my Baptist and Methodist peers.  It was no uncommon thing to see a sobbing girl surrounded by a ring of other girls at lunch or recess.  That sight would always be followed up by the news, "Guess who just got saved???"  A good friend of mine got religious in our junior year of high school, and our friendship actually started after that because he was much nicer to me after he got saved.  He was friends with a fairly popular circle of Christians.  One time, he invited me to a youth revival at this huge church everyone seemed to go to.  I agreed to go, and for the rest of the day, I was showered with attention from these more-popular-than-me girls who had never spoken to me before.  "Oh my gosh, I am SO excited that you're coming tonight!  That is so GREAT!  You can ride with US if you want!  Oh, I can't wait!!"  Etc.  Wow, I had new friends!  It was so easy.  But when I asked my parents, they didn't let me go.  First, it was a school night, and besides that, they were suspicious of youth revivals.  The next day, instead expressing disappointment over my absence, my brand new friends had totally forgotten I existed.  The friend who invited me, though, remains a friend to this day.  For awhile he was going to be a missionary, but now he's a gay architect.

       What I Read This Morning   After a mostly sleepless night filled with angry screams and piteous cries, I finally feel rejuvenated after a double cappuccino and an hour of New Yorker time.  I promised myself I would only read until I found a word I didn't know, but since that happened pretty much immediately, I decided to finish a full-length article instead.  The word was  urlLink augury : the practice of divination.  Here's the whole entry from the Online Etymology Dictionary, which is better than what my paperback etymology dictionary has to say:  augur - c.1374 (implied in augury), from L. augur, a religious official in ancient Rome who foretold events by interpreting omens, perhaps originally meaning "an increase in crops enacted in ritual," in which case it probably is from Old L. *augos (gen. *augeris) "increase," and is related to augere "increase" (see augment). The more popular theory is that it is from L. avis "bird," since flights, singing, and feeding of birds or entrails from bird sacrifices were an important part of divination (cf. auspicious). The second element would be from garrire "to talk." The verb is 1549, from the noun.   The article was about  urlLink Ken Kesey , written by his friend  urlLink Robert Stone . Stone talked about Kesey's cabin in La Honda, California where marijuana grew out of the carpet (from discarded seeds) and morning glory (a hallucenogenic) crept along bookshelves.  He described a party where Kesey's neighbors took sledge hammers to each other's houses in a gleeful and literal act of deconstructionism.  He wrote about the famous bus trip from California to the New York State Fair, when Kesey and his companions became known as "the merry pranksters."  The party wound down when they moved to Mexico, after Kesey was busted for possession.  They lived on the beach, near Manzanillo, Kesey and his family and his companions, but eventually the Mexican police started to harrass them as well, and their time in history was over.  It was a fascinating story of a larger-than-life character whose  urlLink writing  I have admired.  Just one questioned nagged at me while I was reading about Kesey and his wife dropping acid and taking peyote all over North America.  They had three kids.  Who was taking care of them?  I'd love to read the story of one of those kids, and what growing up in the Kesey family was like.  Stone described One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest as a Libertarian fable.  In Lachele's blog, she wrote about a personality type workshop at the Libertarian conference she attended recently, and pointed out that the large majority of Libertarians are NTs.   Which didn't surprise me, since all the Libertarians I know are NTs.  But I'm more curious than ever now about the correlation between personality and politics.  It makes sense to me that in the U.S., NTs gravitate toward the Libertarian party, SJs to the Republican party, and NFs to the Democratic party and SPs. . . I don't know about SPs.  The SPs I know are liberals, but I'm not sure I see that as a function of that personality type.  So, anyway, if you know your personality type, how do you identify yourself politically?   In another New Yorker article, an American Democrat in Iraq said that there's an assumption that if you're in the military, you vote Republican.  But among the soldiers in Iraq, he's met a lot of RINOs (=Republicans In Name Only).

       Quinceanera   The car accident was such a distraction that I never got around to writing about the  urlLink Quinceanera  that I went to last Saturday. It was for Laura's daughter, Maricela, whom I met in 2000, when she was just a kid.    The festivities began with a mass at a Catholic Church in Winder, Georgia at 10:00 a.m.  It was conducted in Spanish, but pretty easy to follow if you've ever been to a liturgical church.  I remembered the last time we were there, for her older sister's quinceanera mass.  It was all quiet and solemn in the church when someone's cell phone started ringing.  My husband and I looked at each other, thinking, who would be so rude as to have their cell phone on in a church? And then guess who had to interrupt the service to take a call?  The priest! It was so funny, but it didn't happen this time around.  The mass was like a wedding with the obligatory videotaping and photos afterward.  I think everyone in the church got summoned to take at least one picture with the princess of the day.  She was wearing a pink strapless Cinderella-shaped dress that reminded me of what girls used to wear to proms before prom-wear got so sexed-up.  She was absolutely beautiful.  The party began at 1:00, but we didn't get there till around 4:00 (recalling the previous experience of sitting at a table for three hours listening to deafening music and waiting for something to happen).  The party was in a great big empty building that is rented out for such events, about the size of my middle school gym, or a little smaller. There were tables with white tablecloths and plenty of pink and white balloons to liven the place up. We got there about an hour before the dancing started, so it was only about one hour of sitting at a table, listening to taped mariachi music at a deafening volume while a live band was tuning up and checking their sound! The baby stayed outside with his daddy for quite awhile, but I had a good time seeing and shouting at Laura's family inside.  I know so much about each one of them, and it was good to see them all looking beautiful and happy.    Laura was escorted by her favorite brother because her husband is, finally, gone to parts unknown.  When I first met her, he was having problems with drugs and alcohol and threatening to kill them both. But now she's free and doing better on her own, even financially, since neither she nor her kids tend to lose a lot of money in poker games. Jenny, Maricela's older sister, was stunning in her white dress and poise.  She emceed the event.  She's waiting to hear if she's been accepted by the college she applied to.  When I first met her, she didn't have a tenth of the self-confidence she has now. Adriana, Laura's younger sister, whose husband took their two-year-old daughter and disappeared, was elegant in a black gown, and dancing the salsa expertly with her brother.  When she smiled, she looked radiant, and I wondered if she could really be that happy. There were other people and other stories, but those are the ones I've mentioned here before.  The dancing was quite a performance.  Maricela had eight chambelanes, decked out in faux-military garb, with swords at their sides.  They looked pretty sharp, despite their teenage hair and piercing fashions.  They performed two dances to American pop songs, one was that ubiquitous Celine Dion thing from Titanic.  After the two formal numers, they all changed costumes and did a little piece of theatre which involved cigarettes, cards, beer, a gun, and the tango.    Then, a couple of rituals:  she was presented with her last doll, a big, fancy porcelain one, to mark the end of her childhood. I think her little brother presented the doll. And then she was crowned with a tiara by her older sister.  Then, all the "padrinos" - that is, people who made some financial contribution to the party - were honored, and were called up to dance with either Maricela or a chambelane.  I was a padrino, but I asked that my name not be called.  I met Laura when she was my student, and I became much more involved in her life and her family than I can possibly be with my other students.  She's not in my class any more, but still, I'm a little uncomfortable to advertise the extent of our relationship where other students might be present.  Well, the computer here at the library gives me only 60 minutes and I have 9 remaining, so I'll read this over and post.

       Updates   No word yet on the car, but I'm anticipating the worst . . . as I had done with regards to my cousin's current health crisis, but I was wrong about that!  He left the ICU for a private room today and seems much stronger.  He still has pneumonia and other unidentified lung problems, and no one yet offers any hope that he'll be able to go back home.  But at least he'll probably be able to leave the hospital.   Sedaris   My favorite humorist, David Sedaris, will be reading at the Peachtree Rd. (Buckhead) Border's on June 28th at 7:30 p.m. I'll be there, Lachele is coming, too.  Anybody else?  Helly?  Alan?

       Crash! Pow! Blam!   I had bragged about my silver Saturn, and how silver cars are involved in fewer accidents than cars of other colors, but it was no protection on Sunday, when I was car #2 in a four car collision.  What a bizarre and totally disruptive experience.  I was hit from behind into the car in front of me (which had unaccountably stopped in the middle of the freeway) and spun sideways.  I was completely unharmed - I think - and mainly grateful that the baby wasn't in the car.  The woman who hit me, and was judged at fault, had two children in her car and was also pregnant.  Thank goodness no one was hurt, but she was taken to the hospital in an ambulance for an ultrasound.  An event like that really brings to mind the fact that one's whole life can change - or end - in a matter of seconds.    I was on my way to Helly's and ended up still going there with my mother's car. And once I was there, I ruined what would have been a perfectly salvageable day by making myself sick with wine.  It wasn't so much wine - I don't think - but I rarely drink anymore, so my tolerance was a lot lower than I thought.  I eventually got myself home to find my mother's house empty.  I soon found out that she was at the hospital, having gotten a ride from a neighbor, because my cousin Bob was taken to the emergency room.  I went to fetch her and we ended up staying at the hospital till 11:30, when Bob was moved to an intensive care room. He has pneumonia, again.  His news today is very grim.  The nurse doesn't think he'll leave the hospital.  Ever since he broke his hip, he's been in this downward spiral - or his brother Frank described it as a bouncing ball, never returning to quite the height where it started the previous bounce.  No one expected this to be happening, least of all him.  It's hard to believe he may be dying because his mind is still so alive.  They talked to him about the possibility of going on life support and he said, sure, give it a try.  Anything is better than dying.

       YMCA   At lunch on Sunday, the baby's grandparents were discussing an old custom of the YMCA, that men were forbidden to wear bathing suits in the pool.  This was back in the day, maybe pre-1960s.  There was much speculation about a possible reason for that rule, and it hurt me not to jump in with: "Because the YMCA is totally gay!  Don't you remember The Village People???"  However, it has plagued me ever since not to know the actual reason.  I googled on "YMCA no bathing suits pool" and "YMCA nude pool."  I found a couple of putative explanations and quite a bit of homoerotic narrative.  (Do your own google, okay?)  The explanations were:    Lint from bathing suits would clog the filtration system.   Naked people were less likely to pee in the pool.     If I Only Had A . . . Frontal Lobe   One of the joys of being at home all day is daytime tv.

Animal Testing: For medical purposes, should be controlled to prevent abuses.   Death Penalty: No.     Downloading Music/Movies: Unless it's mine. . . Actually, I prefer to pay at i-tunes.     Drug Decriminalization: Yes.    Factory Farming: Does that mean keeping veals in little cages their whole lives?  Absolutely not.   Free Trade: Seems to do more harm than good - we lose jobs, foreign wages/conditions remain poor.    Funding of Arts: Yes.   Gay Marriage: Of course.   Gun Control: Licensing, like for cars, would be a good idea, including a written and practical test on safety.   Immigration: Give me your tired, your poor. . .  Open those borders!

Miltary Draft: No.   Minimum Wage: Should be at least 2/3 more than average rent in a city - and should be local rather than national.   Prostitution: Legalize it, supervise it so that workers have recourse in cases of abuse.   School Vouchers: Would rather see that money go to decreasing class sizes in public schools.   Taxes: If there were measures in place to protect the poor, a national sales tax would simplify things.   United Nations: We should work with them.   Universal Health Care: Yes.   War on Terrorism: If it is a war, it is impossible to win.   Welfare: There is no easy answer, especially in this amount of space.    urlLink   Take The Ultimate Politics Survey    Get more cool things for your blog at  urlLink  Blogthings

      I'd like to say a belated THANK YOU to Helly's mom for the news about product labelling.  That is very good news and very comforting.  We had an appointment with the allergist yesterday to talk about the baby's blood tests.  He definitely has an allergy to peanuts.  He also had a slightly elevated antibody response to eggs (both whites and yolks), but he's eaten eggs many times and never seemed to react, so peanuts are the big deal.    In other personal news, my cousin was sent home from the nursing home today, long before he was ready.  His feet have permanent pressure sores and he can barely walk.  He can't even get in bed, let alone prepare meals for himself.  Mom and I took shifts spending time with him today, keeping company and making sure he ate.  But I go back to work next week and so does Mom, since she is my personal day care service.  I think the ideal situation for him would be assisted living, but he believes it is too expensive.  We haven't priced anything yet, though.

      I'm such a sucker for a  urlLink quiz , but I feel really let down by the results on this one.  I am NOT Pauly Shore, not now, not EVER!  They say that the best part of a vacation is coming home.  In my opinion, the best part of a vacation is drinking a pina colada in a swimming pool.  But it was good to get back home to my husband and house yesterday,even though the house was a dismal mess, pretty much as I had left it.  I devoted most of the day to cleaning and decided to really brighten the place up by doing a chore that I'd been putting off for a long time.  The overhead light in the living room has been burned out for about a year because it's at the peak of a vaulted ceiling and you need the scary, wobbly 14+ foot ladder to get to it.  I put the baby in the swing, hauled that ladder in from the garage, and went to work.  Moments later, there was light in the living room for the first time in ages.  I was so proud of myself.  Later that evening, when I got home from the grocery store, I asked my husband if he noticed anything when he came inside.  He looked at me blankly.  Then I demonstrated by turning on the light switch and illuminating the room.  He looked at me blankly again.  I said, "There's a new lightbulb!"  And he said, "I know. I changed it on Saturday."   Some highlights from the Baltimore visit:  We were there in time to see the remnants of the  urlLink 17-year cicadas . Their little brown shells were stuck to pretty much every leaf we passed.  I wished that the baby were old enough to think that was cool.  We strolled through a Saturday morning market with a friendly, hippy vibe that brought back fond memories of the  urlLink Saturday Market  in Eugene. We bought some grilled portabello mushroom sandwiches in pita bread that were incredibly delicious and ate them while listening to a oddly youthful band playing such geriatric hits as "I Shot The Sheriff" and "Take A Load Off Annie."  It was great.  The baby was introduced to a great toy that we have to aquire somehow, called Marbleworks.  It consistes of interlocking pieces that form towers and slides so you can build a pinball-like maze for marbles to run through.  I loved building the towers, and the baby loved taking the pieces and putting them places.  Until recently, he could only take and not put.  But now, he can put things in boxes, on shelves, on tables, etc.   The baby spends more time being mad and frustrated than he used to.  I feel for him, but I can't do much about it.  Now, he's aware that his desires exceed his abilities.  His little ambitions are so often thwarted, either by me, because I can't let him climb up the bookshelf or chew on the electrical cord, or by his own limitations, when he wants to fit puzzle pieces together or brush his own hair. He gets mad quickly and screams a lot and bangs things around.  I wonder if it's a basic personality trait, that he'll always be impatient when things don't come easily to him (rather like his mom) or if that's just typical of his age and development.  My cousin's wife, the internist, told me that the baby's peanut allergy happened because I keep my house too clean and don't put him in daycare.  She has never been in my house.  I actually excused my own slovenly tendencies and would watch the baby put a fur-covered pacifier in his mouth, thinking, "at least he probably won't get allergies."z

      We got on the train last Thursday night to go to Baltimore: me, Mom, and the baby. I love travelling so much, but separation causes me a lot of anxiety.  On top of that, I had a sleepy, fussy baby, more luggage than I could manage (a suitcase, a carseat, a stroller, and a baby), and the sleeper car was far, far smaller than I could possibly have imagined.  We had to wait a couple of hours to get our beds made because the porter had to eat, so we went down to the dining car for a second dinner as well.  I wasn't hungry enough to enjoy the food, and it was exhausting fighting with the baby, who writhed and flailed and screamed, attempting to escape my hold the whole time we were there.  There are no high chairs on a dining car!  By the time I finally made it to my top bunk, I was sobbing.   After five or six minutes of sleep, morning came, and the trip brightened from then on.  I was delighted to see my cousins in Baltimore.  I really love that family, and I also enjoy seeing how the other 20% lives.  My direct cousin is a department head, teacher, and researcher at the University of Maryland School of Medicine, and his wife has her own private practice as an internist.  Their (three-story Tudor-style) house is in the original suburb of Baltimore.  It was built by the first urologist in America for his British wife, to remind her of home.  It's a beautiful neighborhood interlaced with pedestrian lanes and paths that intersect the main streets. All three of their daughters are into sports - the oldest has a field hockey scholarship to college, and the younger two ride ponies in competition.  We went to a horse show on Saturday where both girls competed in equitation events.  It looked to me like a sport that involved too much work - washing and combing the ponies, washing and polishing and shining several pairs of boots, many other little details to attend to.  But they seemed to really enjoy it.  I'll write more about the visit later - it's past my bedtime.

       Why Do You Hate Foreigners SO Much?   I'm now deleting a rather lengthy post of this title, which is a shout-out to my favorite  urlLink Tom Tomorrow comic strip .  But in rereading the post this morning, it really didn't offer much new on the subject of why my particular job of teaching English to adult immigrants (who have children growing up in this country) regardless of their immigration status is a fundamentally Good Thing for you to be spending your tax dollars on - and by the way, thanks for the money!  At one point in my post, I asked the Republicans, why do you hate children so much?? But it occurs to me now that that sounds rather incendiary.  And wrong.  Republicans don't hate children any more than the rest of us do.  So, instead, let me give you my top ten reasons Why I Love America.  10. Free public education with free lunches. 9. The power of the lawsuit - abused at times, but overall a potentially great equalizing force.   8. Innovation of all kinds. 7. Diversity of landscape and especially the Pacific Northwest coast. 6. Growing diversity in the population. 5. Freedom of expression. 4. John Waters and Al Franken.(see #5) 3. Comedy Central and Bravo. Hollywood. 2. American accents. 1. America has been very, very good to me, personally.

       My Civic Duty - A Confession   I joined many of my fellow-citizens at the polls yesterday, doing my civic duty and earning complaining rights.  I'd made a small effort to read up on the candidates, but when I saw the ballot, I was surprised by how unprepared I truly was.  I'd read enough to choose among the four Democrats running for the District 12 U.S. House seat (Caine Corellino from Savannah), but when it came to the list of like 30 or so in the U.S. Senate race, I realized that I couldn't attach a single fact to the majority of the names.  I voted for Denise Majette solely on the basis of her appearance (that is, I could remember what she looked like, plus a smart black female Democrat could only be a boon to the Senate, I would think)and the fact that I vaguely remembered liking something she'd said in an interview.  Is that enough on which to base a sound political judgment??  And then all that other stuff on the ballot I hadn't paid any attention to, like all those judges running unopposed.  Should I vote for them?  Not vote?  It's not as if I knew a name to write in. And then there were the state representatives to vote for, and the public service commissioner (what does he or she even do?) and the coroner.  I really don't know what qualities make a good coroner! I went to the polls feeling proud of myself for having a somewhat informed vote for the House race, and left feeling rather ignorant and downcast.  And I couldn't help but wonder, how many voters went to the polls knowing a whole lot more than me?  Well, lots of them, I hope.  There was a table with coffee and donuts behind the voting booths, but the only people I saw partaking were the poll workers, so I thought maybe it was just for them.  They had a long day of sitting at their tables, so they probably needed the energy.  Even though I didn't vote for  urlLink John Barrow , I was pleased nonetheless that he won the primary.  He's a nice guy, a fellow Athenian, and will be a good candidate.

       Evil Peanuts   The baby has an appointment tomorrow morning with the pediatrician. I hope she'll have some experience with peanut allergy, or PA as it's referred to all over the web. Man, the stories I've been reading just scare the crap out of me. I feel pretty confident about the stuff I can control, like keeping peanut butter and peanut products out of the house, even along with all the foods labelled "may contain peanuts" (or the "may contains"). It's the uncontrollable stuff, when he's out of my sight, playing with kids who have peanut butter smeared on their hands and faces. Too many foods, liked baked goods, ice cream, don't show peanuts on the label, but are "cross-contaminated" - that is, those foods touched a machine that once touched a peanut. This will affect his whole life. The only slightly positive thing I've learned is that it is becoming more and more common, so at least he won't be alone and hopefully more people will have an understanding of it.  Also, even though it's the most life-threatening allergy, people don't really die of it all that often.

       Hair     Spent most of the day trying NOT to think about peanuts, but I can't say I was very successful.  Took a few minutes out from worrying to color my hair.  It came out very nicely, for once - when I do it myself I usually find chunks of hair that I somehow missed with the color.  And the color is a beautiful shade of reddish brown!  No one has noticed or at least commented favorably, though.  My husband, when prompted, said, "It looks nice" in a rather small voice.  I like it, though, so I've been complimenting myself.   I hadn't colored my hair in a couple of years.  I'd rather have it done, but it's so expensive - especially since if I had someone else do it, I'd get highlights.  I have a wonderful hair dresser, Ruth, who is from Guatemala.  The atmosphere of her salon is so relaxed and comforting.  But she is also my student, so she undercharges me and I'm only slightly less uncomfortable paying too little than she is taking my money at all.  And even with the "teacher discount," highlights are pricey.     Sears     Sears is strange.  I was there the other day to buy vacuum cleaner bags (woo-hoo).  When I walked in through the main entrance, I found myself among men's clothes.  That's a strange place to be in a mall if you're not shopping for men's clothes.  To the left were the appliances and to the right were - more men's clothes!  I was kind of thinking of a pair of pants for myself, so after I'd secured the vacuum bags, I wandered through the tools and televisions until finally I came upon a small area of women's clothes.  All the racks seemed to be marked CLEARANCE, so that was a good omen.  I carried several pairs of pants  to the fitting room along with a couple of tops and hung them up on the single hook very high up on the wall.  Shouldn't a dressing room have at least two places to put things?  There was no other shelf or bench, so I dropped my stuff on the floor and put on a pair of pants.  Then I noticed something was missing - the mirror!  No , wait - there it is behind all the pants.  Isn't that bizarre to have the clothes hanger exactly over the mirror?  I had to just drop everything on the floor, which was awkward and distressing, but I did choose a comfortable pair of pants that will be good for work.  Of course, they came from the only rack in the store NOT marked clearance.       Happy     Two of my friends recently started dating, and I'm so happy for them!

       Scary Stuff     Something new to worry about: it seems that the baby has an allergy to peanuts. We went to a birthday party today and I gave him a triangle of pb&amp;j. It was his first sandwich, and I was proud of him for eating a more grownup food. The party was about an hour away from home. He was already showing symptoms as we were getting in the car, coughing and gagging a little bit, but I thought he had swallowed his last drink of water wrong. I sat in the backseat with him and watched the allergic reaction develop: eyerubbing soon led to very red and swollen eyes, coughing led to gagging, spitting, and sneezing huge quantities of amber-colored snot. And of course, he cried and cried. Soon he could barely open his eyes. We were a good thirty minutes away from Athens when I noticed a growing rash and swelling. We drove at truly frightening speed straight to the hospital - I think we made the whole trip in about 40 minutes. I ran into the emergency area, breathless, and was told by a nurse to please have a seat. I explained that the baby was having an allergic reaction and that it might be an emergency. She said, from behind her window, "Turn him around so I can see him. Is he breathing?" Then she told me again, more firmly, to have a seat. About three hours later we were dismissed with a prescription for an oral steroid and, of course, Benadryl. Home now, the baby is sleeping peacefully (thanks, Benadryl), and I'm exhausted. The doc said subsequent allergic reactions are likely to be worse, so we will have to be vigilant about peanuts in food for a long time.    Last night, I also had a scary experience, though not very scary now, compared with today. I was walking in the adjacent neighborhood after dark, around 9:00 p.m., and a car drove slowly by, almost stopping beside me. A man leaned his head out the window and said, "Hey, what are you doing?" I should add, it was pitch dark because that neighborhood doesn't believe in streetlights. I stammered, "I'm walking . . . home!" And then I took off running toward a house with lights on. The car was going the opposite direction and the man drove on. I waited near that house for awhile, imagining the car parked up ahead, waiting for me to walk by again. Finally, I decided that the man seemed more like an opportunist than a predator, and I walked home, really fast, noting every house I passed with lit windows. I wondered how he expected me to answer his question. Maybe, "I'm looking for a party" would have made him happy.

       Blah   Although I'm continuing to follow the diet faithfully, my weightloss plateaued quickly and I've been hovering around 1Y8 for days now.  Maybe I should stop checking.  I've even tried incorporating more exercise in the form of early morning walks, before the thermostat hits 90 degrees.  Maybe I'm just not drinking enough red wine.   Movie   I just went to see the movie  urlLink Dodgeball .  It's hard to think of anything to say about it after reading Sandy's in-depth post on the movie Warriors.  There was nowhere near so much going on in Dodgeball!  In fact, there's nothing I could tell you about the plot that you couldn't easily guess after watching a 30 second ad.  I liked what one reviewer said about it - it was nice to see Vince Vaughn in a role that wasn't smarmy.  Even though he plays smarmy so well!  I was happy to see  urlLink Jason Bateman   badly  reprising  urlLink Fred Willard 's co-announcer role from  urlLink Best In Show .  I was happy just because I like him so much, having developed a minor crush on his character in Arrested Development.   Words That Confuse Me   I was thinking the other day of innocent words that have unfortunate homonymous associations that confuse me. For instance, the word  limpid , as in "limpid light."   urlLink Limpid  simply means clear, but my brain also hears the word  limp , making me think "weak light" rather than "clear light."  Another one is the word  intrepid , like maybe "the intrepid warrior."   urlLink Intrepid  means fearless, but my brain is distracted by the almost-embedded  urlLink  tepid  , making me imagine a "lukewarm or unenthusiastic warrior."    urlLink Sanguine  is another one that throws me.  Originally one of the four humors, it now usually describes a cheerful, optimistic personality.  But my brain also catches a near rhyme to  urlLink languid , threatening to turn a cheerful person into a weak and listless one.

       Ewwwww   Why is my banner ad about "Colon Cleansing" today?  What did I do to deserve that?   Wildlife   I saw a hummingbird at the kitchen window today flying to the window and back, to the window and back.  It was just for a few seconds, but he really reminded me of Phil Lamarr's character, The UBS Guy, on MadTV.  Every day for about week now there have been between one and three daddy longlegs on the azalea plant nearest my front door.  I'm mesmerized by them and I can't pass the bush without stopping for several minutes to gaze in horror and fascination.  They are less frightening to me on a plant than on (or god forbid *in*) my house.  One of the three has noticeably thicker legs and he is much more frightening to me than the others.  I have the least intense reaction to the one with the smallest body and the thinnest legs.  One of my worst fears now is that my son will someday throw one at me.  My husband says, "Not if you teach him to be really, really afraid."   Me & Pat Buchanan   In the New Yorker today, I read that Pat Buchanan is  urlLink against both Bush and the war in Iraq .  Since I don't really follow Pat Buchanan in the news, it came as a surprise to learn that he and I have something in common.  I did some googling to find out if we have anything else in common.  All the information comes from  urlLink this site :  1. Pat's father was "a government accountant and then managing partner of Councilor, Buchanan & Mitchell, one of the largest accounting firms in the Washington D.C. area."  My dad was a book keeper for Southeastern Railroads' Associated Bureaus.  2.  He worked for a newspaper in St. Louis.  I was on my high school newspaper staff.  I was in St. Louis once in 1989.  3.  He owns at least $15,000 in stock in AT&T and General Motors.  I had AT&T long distance service until recently, and I've owned 2 GM cars!  3.  He denies ever having been diagnosed with  urlLink chlamydia .  So do I.  4.  He's accused of " urlLink flirting with fascism ."  I flirted with a fascist once, in college.

       Four Eyes    I got my first pair of glasses in the fourth grade, and I still remember the magic of seeing clearly for the first time.  I've had contacts since high school, and it seems that most of the people I know have corrective lenses of some sort.  I'm always kind of impressed to discover that someone has perfect vision.  Some friends of mine were speculating about how we've survived as a species if poor vision is really so common among us.   urlLink This article  suggests that environmental factors rather than genetics may be to blame.   Decision   I ordered train tickets today after agonizing over it for nearly 24 hours.  Now I'm preoccupied with luggage - how to carry the carseat, whether to pack food or buy it there - and baby details, such as where and if he will sleep in a strange place.  Some people don't find much to worry about in life.  I admire and envy them.

       Dilemma   Exiciting news: my mom and I are planning a trip to Baltimore to introduce the baby to some beloved relatives there.  The hard part is making the decision about how to travel.  Every time I've ever expressed any anxiety about flying, some practical person has kindly reminded me that I'm WAY more likely to die in a car accident.  All those people have no idea how much they ruined car travel for me!  Especially having had a recent crash, I would be very reluctant to take the baby on a 12 hour drive.  Plus, that's a whole day (2 days, in fact) pretty much wasted for him.  The other two options are high-anxiety air travel for $160 and a laid-back train trip for $450!  If it weren't for the money, I'd happily choose train.  But I'm trying to weigh the disadvantages of all three right now.

       Stuff I Saw Around the Chickenaries   My cousin is in a nursing home in an industrial area of town, not far from the two big "polleras" or "chickenaries" - Goldkist and whatever ConAgra is currently calling itself.  The three of us went to visit him tonight to take him his new ibook, but there was no place to sit down, so I took the baby back to the car while my spouse took time getting my cousin oriented.  It was too hot to sit, so we drove around awhile with the air-conditioning full blast.  It was interesting to explore the area.  I saw several things I'd never seen before.  For instance, on a little road that cuts through an industrial complex I passed a Mexican nightclub in a trailer and an Evisceration Plant.  Although I would really enjoy telling people, "I work at the Evisceration Plant," I don't think that I would actually enjoy working there.  I also saw the alcoholics hanging out at the back of the AA club looking like some kind of great big mixed race family reunion. They were having so much fun, I couldn't help but wish I were an alcoholic, too.  And I saw a whole flock of geese standing by the side of the road as if waiting to cross.   We All Scream   for  urlLink chicken ice cream ??    Got Soy?   So, do babies really need to drink cow's milk?  The baby has been on a soy formula up to now.  The lactation consultant recommended it, and I don't mind the way it smells.  (The Enfamil we were given at the hospital just smells foul to me.) The pediatrician recommended we start giving him whole cow's milk.  He's not too enthusiastic about it.  Maybe it tastes kind of weird to him, like soy milk would taste if you're expecting regular milk.  So, he doesn't drink much.  The other day I got him to drink about half a cup and some of it dribbled down on to his shirt.  I wiped him up, but an hour or two later, I held him close to me and nearly gagged.  I had to go wash him and change his shirt.  And I remembered years ago her friend had handed me her baby and I was afraid to get him close to me because he smelled so bad - and it was the exact same smell.  He's been so happy and healthy and sweet-smelling with his soy formula. Is there any reason not to give him soy milk, I wonder?  What is the ingredient of cow's milk that is so important for children?  I've never been too fond of milk as a beverage, as you might guess, although I like it with cereal and in a capuccino.   Blog   This is a funny blog, if you happen to  urlLink work with fools .

       Weight Loss and Words   I'm really pleased with the progress of my diet so far.  These are my daily weights since starting a semi-strict Atkins diet on June 29th: 1X5, 1X2, 1X0, 1Y8.8, 1Y8.6, 1Y7.8, 1Y7.2.  Why am I using X and Y to replace my tens digit?  While I want to share my overall progress, I intend to maintain a strict policy of measurement ambiguity.  (Y=X-10)  This morning on NPR I learned that Israel has a policy of  urlLink nuclear ambiguity .  I thought that was a funny way of saying "keeping it secret."    Jason Kottke found a really funny use of the expression  urlLink "I have a policy."

       Happy 4th   Oh, yeah, Happy Independence Day.  We did nothing whatsoever to celebrate it, although I had grilled burgers on Saturday and ate one (the traditional meal?) on Sunday.  My neighbors are setting off their leftover fireworks tonight.  Last night was very loud and the dogs were scared.  This morning at Starbucks some customers were debating with the baristas whether or not fireworks are legal in the state of Georgia.  The customers assumed they must be because there were so many of them last night.  (If anyone outside the state of Georgia reads this blog, fireworks are illegal.  I wonder why since we have relatively lax gun laws. . .)   Science Humor   I got a great answer to my question at Ask Miss Science.  I had to read it a few times to get comfortable with the formulas, but I walked away from it feeling that yes, I could understand that math.  And moreover that I did learn something in high school after all.    Somehow I was reminded of one of my very favorite urban legends,  urlLink the Barometer story .    In searching for that link, I ran across a discussion of college entrance exam urban legends, usually about daring essays for Harvard or Princeton.  Here's a few:   The question was: What is the bravest thing you've ever done?  One student wrote, "This is."  Another drew a big X across the page.  Another wrote, "Fuck you."   At one school there was an option to write your own essay question.  One student wrote, "Do you play the tuba?" and answered, "No."   There were other stories of a student whose entire essay consisted of three words: "I am terse." or "I am concise."

       Ask Miss Science!   Go  urlLink here  now and ask a question to your new Science Guru.   I'm a Manx, You Minx!   I was helping my mom do some online geneological research today and we turned up the name of my greatgrandfather, John Lacy Christian, on  urlLink this  delightfully clickable site made by and for the Stafford family. I clicked each name all the way back till there were no more ancestors listed and the Christian line persisted all the way back to Daniel McCristyn who was born about 1550 in Baldroma, Isle of Man.  Now I want to learn all about those  urlLink Manxes !  What I've learned so far is that the island is in the Irish Sea and it's  urlLink government  is independent of the UK as well as the European Union. The have a native Celtic language called  urlLink Manx Gaelic , or just Manx. When I decide to learn a Gaelic language I'm going to start with Manx because the spelling should be easier, according to the  urlLink WorldIQ Encyclopedia entry :    The spelling of Manx, unlike that of Irish and Scottish Gaelic, does not represent the Goidelic etymology, and more closely resembles an English speaker's attempt to write Gaelic. This is because Manx developed without a written literature, and when attempts were made to introduce a standardised orthography for the language, the choice was made to spell the words in an English manner. For example, 'Isle of Man' in Irish would be written as Oileann Mhannain or in Scottish Gaelic as Eileann Mhannain, whereas in Manx it is written as Ellan Vannin.      Completely Dead, Or Just Mostly Dead?   I'm fascinated by the idea of language revival.  Even though the last native speaker of Manx died in 1974, there are people on the island who have learned Manx from text and recordings and are teaching it to their children. Lots of languages have undergone or are undergoing a successful revival.    urlLink Hebrew , for instance, had died out as a spoken language.   urlLink Eliezer Ben-Yehuda , among others, is credited with reviving it.   urlLink  The Cornish Language , distant cousin to Manx, has an interesting revival story.  And then there's  urlLink the whistling language  of La Gomera, Spain.    Funny Google   I only just discovered this: you can set your preference "to display google tips and messages" in many different languages, including Elmer Fudd and, my favorite,  urlLink Bork, Bork, Bork !

       I'm Walking, Yes Indeed   The baby took his first step yesterday, from the coffee table to his grandma's arms, and repeated the feat later that morning at home. Yay, baby!!   Coincidence?   First, yesterday I was reading this book,  urlLink Anil's Ghost , which takes place in Sri Lanka and mentions the city of Colombo.  A little later, I read a story in the New Yorker about the effects of outsourcing service jobs in the Indian city of Chennai, and there was mention of Colombo again.  And this morning I was on the way to Earth Fare, the organic food grocery store, when NPR featured a story on a similar chain called Whole Foods (commonly nicknamed "Whole Paycheck").    Hmmmm!  What does it all mean?   My Newest Words    urlLink fungible : interchangeable.  From that story about India:    [The employees of Office Tiger] often wondered why, after five years, [founder] Joe still lived in a hotel.  But he, better than they, understood that conceptual attachments are necessarily  fungible  ones - able, when provoked, to move elsewhere.     urlLink plangent : Loud and resounding or expressing sadness.  From an article on Dylan Thomas, after quoting some poetic words of mourning for the poet who died at age 39:   The death of an old singer - a Yeats or a Frost - offers less scope for  plangency .

       In The News   This morning on NPR, there was a good story about the  urlLink tanda , a means of saving or borrowing money, depending on how you look at it.  Once, I saw money changing hands amongst my students, and one of them explained to me that they were in a tanda.  A group of friends get together and contribute a set amount of money each month, and each month one person keeps all the money.  It's like borrowing if you get the full payment early in the tanda, and like saving if you get it at the end.  The NPR reporter emphasized that it's as much about creating and maintaining strong relationships as about saving money and avoiding banks.  Cool.

       The Downward Spiral   Back in March, when my 65-year-old cousin Bob broke his hip, I had a strong feeling that it might be the beginning of the end - or the beginning of a long series of bad things.  And so it was.  When he broke his hip and spent some weeks lying flat in bed, he developed pressure wounds on his heels.  It seemed a minor thing compared with the broken bone, but those wounds have emerged as a life-threatening problem.  Because he has no circulation in his legs (a condition that's been worsening for years) the wounds can't heal.  Not only that, but both of his feet and lower legs have become infected.  The left foot is so severely infected that it threatens to poison his body and kill him.  So, the surgeon is planning to amputate that leg above the knee, one day next week, I guess.  They will do a test tomorrow to see if they can do a bypass operation to improve the right leg, but that is doubtful.

       Movie Review   Last night I saw the documentary  urlLink Control Room , about Al-Jazeera and its coverage of the beginning of the war in Iraq.  The director followed three main characters: Hassan Ibrahim, a Sudanese journalist with Al-Jazeera; Samir Khader, a producer for Al-Jazeera; and Capt. Josh Rushing, the press officer whose job was as liaison between the U.S. military and the Arab press.  These characters  were intelligent, thoughtful people who were not limited to the absolutist perspectives of government propaganda from either side.  There were shameful clips of Donald Rumsfeld accusing Al Jazeera of rounding up women and children to film them at bomb sites, just to evoke misplaced sympathy for victims.  But there was no doubt in the filmmaker's (or this viewer's) mind that plenty of women, men, and children were killed and maimed by the bombs. That didn't need to be faked. The U.S. administration also blasted Al-Jazeera for showing footage of American POWs, some injured or dead.  One of my favorite parts of the moving was Capt. Rushing's confession that while he, too, was horrified and outraged by the footage of the POWs, he had watched newsclips of Iraqi dead and wounded the night before, thought to himself, "That's sad, that's really gross," and then gone out to eat some dinner.  The contrast made him understand what his Arab colleagues must have felt at the sight of the Iraqi bomb victims. The U.S. administration as well as some journalists dared to accuse Al-Jazeera of Arab nationalist bias (and much worse).  Their answer was, of course we are biased, just like the Fox news network.  I suspect that this could be a more effective film than Fahrenheit 9/11 (which I haven't seen yet) since it is not as angry, and not at all driven by a political mission.  The  urlLink filmmaker  wanted to approach the story as a journalist, to understand and show how the news was created during that time of war.   Altruist   In the New Yorker this morning, I read about philanthropist  urlLink Zell Kravinsky .  He made millions in real estate, gave away most of it, then donated a kidney to a stranger. He would really like to donate the other one, too, but realizes his family would never forgive him. He's been criticized more than praised.  His story reminded me a lot of Tolstoy, who became so obsessed with his moral obligation to the poor that he impoverished his wife and eleven children. In his  urlLink biography by Henri Troyat , he didn't come across as a very likeable person, and his altruism seemed more an act of will than of love. Both characters interest me because they attempted to live up to ideals that many people give lip service to.  Both men were criticized for failing to put their children first, although Kravinsky set up trust funds for his children's education.  Still, he said, why are my children's lives worth more than anyone else's?  There's the line I would have to draw, if I ever made millions.  I'd happily give lots of it away and save my son the burden of being too wealthy for his own good.  But I would never jeopardize my health or his, and his life is much more important to me than anyone else's.  Forget the greater good; he is my son.

       Other Lives   I was originally going to call this blog Other People's Lives because I thought that's what I would write about, since that's what interests me so much  - but I was seriously underestimating my own self-involvement.  However, I want to briefly recommend two excellent non-fiction books that I just finished that told fascinating stories of other people's lives:   urlLink Random Family : Love, Drugs, Trouble and Coming of Age in the Bronx by Adrian Nicole LeBlanc. The author spent eleven years involved with a loosely connected group of Latinos in the Bronx and chronicled their lives through love affairs, pregnancies, babies, drug addictions, arrests, prison time, homelessness, public housing, etc.  For me, it was a really educational look at how poverty and culture affect the choices people make and the lives they lead.  Often it pointed out glaring misunderstandings between social service workers and people who were attempting to benefit from their care.  It read like a novel, and I could hardly put it down. I heard about this book, actually, when David Sedaris was promoting it at his reading last month.   urlLink Bringing Down the House : The Inside Story of Six M.I.T. Students Who Took Vegas For Millions by Ben Mezrich.  I heard about this book on NPR when the author was interviewed.  This was a great rise and fall tale where the heroes were really, really smart Asian guys - kind of like Revenge of the Nerds without the comedy and with a lot more strippers and showgirls.  The main character profiled started out as an ambitious, middle-class kid whose life was on a particular trajectory - school, a degree, a good job, a 401(k) - and then it went off course in the most unimaginable direction.  The system they used to beat dealers was really interesting to learn, and not illegal at all.   Serious Baby   So, when I brought the baby home yesterday, he was doing his usual taking and putting with his toys, so I went to the kitchen and found some party toothpicks - big ones with little tassles on the ends - and a narrow bud vase.  I demonstrated putting the toothpicks in the vase, and he was like, "Okay, let me take it from here."  He was so serious and absorbed in the task even though he couldn't do it at all when he started.  But he practiced for a long time (for a baby) and was eventually getting in more than he was dropping on the floor.  By the time he wandered off to the kitchen to check out the pots and pans, he had pretty well mastered that task.  I was so proud!

       Back To Work   I returned to work this morning with mixed feelings.  I'm glad to come back to the job that I love so much, but I'll miss spending my days with the baby and watching him learn all his new little things every day.  I'll still have a few hours with him in the evenings at least.  He actually cried this morning when I left him at mom's, and that was very sad because he's never done that before.    I'm cleaning out my desk right now and the contents of my desk are now piled on top of my desk, what didn't go in the trash.  We started the day with a three-and-a-half-hour meeting and that sapped some of my enthusiasm.  But. . . back to work.
