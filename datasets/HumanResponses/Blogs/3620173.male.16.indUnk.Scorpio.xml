      So, Monday, heheh, it was such a great day... So, like Always I got my wake up call from my Sweetie, I love that girl Honestly, I think I was born to meet her... Or something like that. We talked and stuff, I cleaned my room while talking to her, it looks so freaking clean it's not even funny hehe. I just Love how clean it is, but enough of that. So yeah, I talked to her and we had decided the day before that it was going to be a day to take pictures of us together but things change. So anyway, so she went and cleaned the kitcken and stuff. It's great... Then she is baking cookies... So she called me again and tells me that she is going to shower and straigten her hair, which is long so it took forever.  So, while she was preparing her hair, I was watching TV and stuff, I finally learned 100% how to do the Karate Kick the guy from Story of the year does in the "Anthem of Our dying day" video, it's cool. I'm good at that, but I use a bass intead of guitar. So yeah, then my friend Brett Called me telling me that he needed a ride to Salt Lake City because there is this contest at the Radio Station that you submitted a song and you might play with The Used so it's cool cool, hehehe. So yeah, I didn't know if Tiffy could go so I waited for her call. Then she called and I told her that and it was cool. So I went to Brett's House who wasn't done Mixing the damn song so it took like 30 minutes to do that. It was great. So we left his house onto Tiffy's House.  So, I drove like a Maniac to get there, so I ran out of my ran and hugged her and introduced Brett to Tiffy and stuff. Then we set off, we put some gas in my Car then we went to Smith and bought some flower for Danno, whom turned 16, how sweet is that? Well she did, so then I drove to her house and Tiff Gave her the flower and then kissed her... (WTF!?! I don't mind hehe) then off to Salt Lake, so I found out that having Tiff riding shotgun and me driving will be lethal hehe, I swerved so much! It's a mircale I'm here not in jail... BUt it was great, so we got to SLC and we drove to the Radio Station we got down put some money in the parking meter and then Brett Called the guy so he would come out and take the CD... I hope he wins so he can play with The Used... Then we went to Starbucks cause I've been craving a Coffee for soooo long! I chose a Caramel Frapuccino and they are SOOO good it's not even funny! Then went to BK cause Tiffy wanted a drink, I got some fries and stuff then off to home! So yeah it was fun...  It was great, kissing while driving and stuff, interesting! So I dropped Tiffy off and she asked her mom & dad if I could watch a movie and stuff and I could so I went and dropped brett off, he liked Tiff... YAY! hehehe, yeah and then I went home peed and then went to Tiffy's house we watched I am Sam, and we made out a lot... She said she doesn' tlike the way I kiss but loves me to kiss her... weird! Hehe, then I left around 11:30something and got home... Then she called we talked and she fell asleep on the phone... I just held it for like 20-30 minutes in silecne she woke up we said good bye and that was my day... well then I showered did my hair and it's currently 5:24am... GREAT!   Lovely Picture from back in the day

So, I got a wake up call by my Tiffy, she is soooo lovely, I love that girl so much I don't know why. Hehehe, she is grand, to think I fell for her with a Phone Call, well that call was what I wanted for a long time. Full of love and stuff, we can talk on the phone for hours, it's pretty interesting. She is just so amazing, we are totally different but I feel so attracted to her.    She is sooo pretty!  Hehe, link of the day...   FUNNY PICTURE!

      So, yeah... Yesterday was such a good day in a way... I believe it really was. So, at Zumiez I'm on call this week because I need to start working so I had to buy a cell phone because I'm never home. Right now I'm not making sense because it's 11:02am(at the moment no the end of the blog) and I went to bed at like 5-6am... I got a Wake up call from my sweetie... I LOVE HER! Okay well... Saturday, so I woke up around 1pm, because I got a wake up call yes... From her... Then we talked for like couple of minutes and she had to do something and hung up. Blah.  Saturday I wanted to be lazy and just drift around my house and then Tiffy Called, she was going to the Mall and wanted to see me because she wouldn't today(Sunday) because it's Dad's day hehehe. So yeah, then she went and Saw Dodgeball, I wanted to go and like see her the moment she got out but I didn't... Then she called after the movie and I went to the mall was with her for like 10-20 minutes and that's all I saw of her Saturday I was sad. Went to Dane's house cause she said she would be there but she never went there... *sigh*...  Then, around 12:05am, or something(entering Sunday) she called me... She always call me hehehe, so she did and she was like "We need to talk, I don't know if this is too sudden and if was the right decision" I'm like  Oh man she is going to break up with me  and she is like "I talked to the guy from jersey about us and we were crying and stuff"(see she had a long distance relationship with a guy from Jersey and they like love each other)... So I was about to cry when she said that then she is like "Well I told him I would stay with you and see how things go and stuff" and I'm like crying by then I was soo happy she decided to stay with me, argh! Anyway... So that's the scariest thing ever man! I'm happy she diddn't break up with me... I would've cried and bad!

      So kiddos, Yesterday was such an awesome day! I mean it was just wonderful so much, to tell not really, it's just that some stuff happened and blah! It's great! Here are some highlights of my life... Well the day... Blah I don't know waht to say... I'm gonna try, here are the top things that ahppened today... So, I got hired at Zumiez, had dinner with Family and Got an awesome phone call.  So, Tuesday, I went to the mall to apply at some places so that I could get a job it was great, I went to Zumiez and like always joked around with the manager that he sould hire me. So he told me to go to a 'group interview' today so if I could get the job or what not. So, I thought about it, so I decided to not go, but then I slept and stuff and I woke up around 2pm(the interview started at 3) and I'm like, man I'm gonna be bored so I decided to go, It started at like 3:15pm or something and it went all the way until like 6 pm, it was great. We had to do lots of activities... Well only three but they were soo much fun! So, the first one was :   Introduction  We had to introduce ourselves to the group... So, the catch was that we didn't introduce ourselves, we were split into a group and we had to introduce other people. My group had like 3 other guys, they all could do little raps and stuff, I can't rap AT ALL! so I did a hardcore/air guitar/ ballet thing and it was so much fun, Really, it was great, had fun, but it was REALLY hot outside, Yes they did take us outside.   Mechanical Man  This one was fun too, we were divided into groups again and it was fun, we had to sell something to the manager using Q&A(Question and Answer) it was fun. The person infront had to hold a skateboard, the second one had to grab the skateboard and move it, and the last one had to be the salesmas, I was stuck with a NERDY kid that was psycho and knew nothing about skateboarding, I don't feel bad at all he didn't get hired. So it was fun... Yes!   Reseach  This one was the weirdest one, We went to the Food court. We had to talk to total strangers and like ask them their name and know some stuff about them. That as quite interesting man, hehe some guy freaked out on me I was like," Well screw you too man". But oh well, it was lots of fun, I really enjoyed that.   After that we went back to the store they had a one-on-one with everybody in my group and slowly discharged people, I was quite amazed that I got the job, I was so happy! I REALLY was, so I can't work until next week because I have to fill out some paper work and get a bank account tomorrow(well it's today), so it's gonna be great and lots of fun, I hope I can help out the company by selling stuff at the same time myself in gaining self steem.  Yes then I went to my aunt's party whom is leaving for Colombia tomorrow... Yes, then I got a phone call from this amazing girl we talked for like 3 hours... It was great, I'm beginning to like her and a  lot.

      So, not much to write just what I wrote in my xanga but extended version. Hehe, you do realize You can comment in my blogger with out being a member? Just state your damn name hehehe. So, the day starts like this :  I woke up and I had plans of Job Hunting with Brett and Chris(whom I'm pissed at the moment) so I just wanted to hang out really hehe but whatever. So I woke up, got on the computer, then I don't know. Got ready for the day, that means I showered, then did my hair, got dressed, put some deodorant got clothing on and ready to go. So, I called Brett and he wasn't ready so I waited for like 5 minutes then drove to his house and stuff. Picked him up and we went on a search to find 'Wester Wats' Which is a phone Survey company. Well, the two closest ones are closed so I was kind of sad, it really is an easy job. So I decided to go to the orem one, but we couldn't find it so we went to this other Survey place applied there with Brett and Chris, we'll get a phone call next week I guess and see if we get hired... hopefully we will.  Then we went to the Mall and stuff. So we went to FYE and applied there, but we wont get hired cause only people with big boobies and a Vagina do get hired... so whatever, and the stack is LIKE HUGE! So, hopefully I'll get hired there... Then went to Subway, Spencers, and other places. It was great fun, I really liked applying for jobs with Brett it's better than going all alone. But honestly, I just want a job so I can get like $1300 for a new bass. Then I can quit, cause I just want the bass for the band. Hehe, it's great! I like the bass it's awesome.   Tomorrow, tomorrow, so much stuff that will go on, I guess not? I also don't know if I'm 100% sure of what I'm going to do, hopefully what I kinda of had in mind will go as planned. Anyway, so I'll meet up with Tiffany who seems to be a really cool girl so hopefully we'll be in good terms, she seems really awesome. Then I'll go to my aunts house and celebrate her birth day for like 10 minutes since I'll be with Tifanny screw my family hehehe. I'll drop them off a cake I baked since my dad told me to do it, I didn't really want to but whatever. It didn't cook the way I wanted it to cook. Oh yeah! Before all that I have an Interview at Zumiez, that's gonna be SO AWESOME! really awesome so I want to do that go to the intervew hang out with Tifanny and get to know her... hehe *wink wink*... Well, Not much to say so I believe I'm gone now....  So, hold on to your diaper kids.

      Hehe, even though no one I know reads this it's okay I'm still gonna write in it. My coheed Layout rocks... Or so I think, hehehe. I like it a lot... So, lately I've been feeling like crap or something.... I just figured I'm kind of sick with everything around me. Some stuff that makes me extremely SICK! YUCKY! I just want to kill someone... But today is what I needed so that I could feel better... WAY better... Here goes my day...  So like Saturday Brett and I decided to go to Guitar Center, which is heaven for musicians, everything under one building... It's great! So he called me and we decided to go. We took Josh and Trenton, and we headed to a pawn shop where I got like $15, for my Nintendo 64 and other stuff. CHEAP! I swear we could've gotten more... Oh well, Brett did the transaction, he is 18 I'm not... Who cares! Then went to another pawn shop and traded my bass for ghetto one that they had... Hey I gotta try quality, this one is better than the bass I had but it needs new strings... So... The Trip Starts!  Hehe, So, first we stopped at Little Caesars and bought some lunch I guess. Two pizzas, 5 pieces each... Yummy, then went to the gas station and got some gas for the journey. So, we get in the Freeway, What I've learned so far is that Utah is always working on the freeway and it's annoying... but Who cares! Also my car needs better speed attack... So, I start driving and Josh(whom is cool but annoys the living crap out of me) was goofing off with Trenton and Brett, Annoying but I love those guys, seriously... So, they were starting to piss me off but whatever I got over it, I just don't like it when people litter from my car cause I might get pulled over and I don't want to... I should be pulled over every day I drive... I'm a crazy driver! Hehe... REALLY crazy!  So, we then merge onto I-215 and I drove past this car so closely my friend could stretch his car and touch the guy driving... Hehe, then I exited through Exit 15 and took a left(confusion of Salt Lake and directions) hoping to find the place... No such luck! Hehe, I drove like forever and nothing yet... So I kinda was confused then we asked this guy to tell us where it was and it was lke 40 blocks the opposite way(DUH TO US) So then I kinda managed to drive to the airport(which is FAR away)... We found the place and it was cool! I played Drums(electric AHHAHA PLASTIC!)Then a Gibson, it was pretty, then I played the basses, *orgasm* I'm in love with the basses, so I played the bass I WANT REALLY bad it's amazing I love it, Played every brand of bass and it was great I'm in love with basses! HEHEHE I SO WANT THAT BASS, that's the only reason the trip was for so I could try it out before I got it...(40 mile drive for a test) hehe...  Drove back and hung out with the guys,then went home showered and got some phone calls... Coolios then I went and hung out with my g/f and stuff got good! Hehehe, that's all I'm gonna say and later days kiddos...

      So, it's about time, I finally have the blogger thing almost down, no where near close but Hey! what can ya do? So, this is my first layout thing and I still don't think anyone ever reads this! But whatever, this is going to be for my future website so in the meantime I still have to learn how to use it.  Things I've learned so far...  This is way harder to work with than Xanga, xanga is easier to start with... Maybe I'll get used to this one. More freedoms than Xanga, yes it's true but what can you do? Whatever.. hehe, I still don't know what i'm going to do now that I kinda have this thing down...  Well enjoy the night kids.

      What do you know, I'm back again with just more nonsense that isn't Supposed to exsist. I wonder if I can type in more than 600 words in this entry. I should try it out. Because it would be cool to reach out up to four thousand words in my entries. It will be hard but if I do not shorten my words then I might just reach the goal, yes the goal that I want to reach which is to have up to four thousand words in this thing. I wonder if this thing combines words from my other blog thing, which is my other blog thing because I need two, not just one, but two of them because I just do. Talking like that is pretty much a lot of fun, I do no know why but it sounds like computer-ish like and I like that. Well what can I say, I am a freak of nature and I just come up with the dumbest things ever. But you should not know about that yet... Perhaps later. I believe using big words makes you sound smart... Yet if you use them in the wrong syntax then you are a comple dumbass, so I should say by then. Welcome to my world, I am a dumbass. I enjoy being a dumbass.... and I will die being a dumbass... All because I enjoy it too much. Not a single care in the world if you just do not care about whatever you are trying to say. Which I am not tying to say a thing because hell, I do not.  Well enough of that Mumbo Jumbo non-sense. So, My pants stink, I think my feet stink and my hair of course stinks, all about me stinks, why? I do not know, well I washed my hair yesterday, I have to do my laundry... My feet? Well, they are just there, I wonder how much cooler a body would be with out feet but paws or something like that... Yes that would be totally awesome, but it will not happen any time soon. I got a hair cut, I kinda like it when it looks the way I originally cut it to. But my hair is soo stupid it wont take the shape I want it to take whenever I want it to take it. That made no sense, I just wish that my hair was naturally straight. Really, I see these girls Curling their hair, why would they do that? It is just not fair that they get partially straight hair, I get a fully one hundred percent curly hair patch on my head and I hate it! I hate my hair! Do I sound gay? Well I am not, I just happen to hate my hair because the life Style I have chosen needs damn straight hair so I can cut my hair according to the fashion guidelines we have to follow which I quite enjoy actually but oh well. One day I will be able to change my DNA and become a superhuman person that will have Straight hair, and then... Only then I will be happy and a superhuman with powers that will annihilate curles... No curles in my world while I am a superhuman with a cool EMO hair style.  So, I guess these blog things are good when you can actually write at a moderate speed, well so I got a new camera, I must say, I love it! I just take picture after picture after picture. I enjoy that shiznit, hehe... The bad thing is that the batteries die pretty fast. But oh well, hopefully I'll get those cool batteries that last around fifty times more than the ones I got. Then I will buy the Charger and I will have lots of pictures and battery power, I love batteries they are awesome. Drool is what I do when I think of it hehe. So I got pictures, do you want to see them? They are just random things about me... I decided to get cute and I enjoy my pictures.                               Yes, I am a master of cool, I believe I generated that word we call "Cool" or something like that... or I'm just so lame I think I'm cool I go for the fact that I created cool... You better agree with me on that one. because I rule, I shall become the emperor of this world... i'm bored... I don't want to go on with this endless blog of stupidty... so here is to the choya... hehe I made that word up.

      Heh, I like the title for this one, I don't know, it's just quite interesting I must say. So, I haven't updated in my blogger for a long time, so I felt like I should do it right now. What to write about though... Should I just copy and paste my xanga into here? Maybe not, so what to write, it's been a long week. It really has. So I've been into deep thought lately, actually I have given it no thought at all. There is one thing I really know, I love Alyssa...Really, I'm not even kidding when I say that, she is just so amazing and makes me happy in some way I don't know how to explain, but hey that's life for us so we don't know about that certain things. I visited Alyssa Friday and it was one of the best days ever. Lots of things happened, we almost die, I got a ticket for speeding actually I have to go to court. I bought the Senses Fail CD which is amazing. I got another Caramel Frappuccino which is amazing. But honestly Alyssa, she is sooo amazing! AH! I can't explain it.  I really like this layout for my Blogger, I need another one because this isn't mine and I don't feel comfortable with out my costumizing my stuff you know? So, I have to learn all the things that make a blogger what it is and yeah. Well, hehehe. I love Alyssa, I'm still with Tiffie and I dont know, life is confusing, I hope I can figure out my situtation before something really weird happens or I end up losing them both. But I promised Tiffie that if we break up we will be friends because she is awesome. So she still loves her Manny person, to me he seems like a dick and he is Puerto Rican? whatever I don't give a shit so I don't like him, I mean if I can't call you "dude" what am I gonna do? Dude is like the best word out there. You can stick it in anywhere, I call everybody dude, Teachers, cops, girls, ancient people, and more. So yeah, it's great...  I realized that McCall is a pretty girl, yeah. She is a cute gal man, some lucky bastard will have her but that's cool. She deserves a nice guy... Crazy Girl... Everybody I know is Crazy, man Rise Against is a good band... I love their music, same with Senses Fail... Whooo, Mesa Boogie has powerful amps man, really, can't exaplin it but the amp I tried was a meanie... REALLY! WHOOO...  Guitar Center is a cool place, I mean you can just play any instrument you want. Great times...  Here are the pictures from my xanga. I love those girls they are rad!                                                          See I told you there were pretty, So McCall is the blonde one, Alyssa is the one with Dark Hair, and Chelsey is the one with Light brown hair or something hehe. Crazy girls but hey! What can I say they are amazing, I love them all hehehe. Love such a strong word and over used. I've been babbling about nothing so I think I'll stop this entry right now... Peace out hommies.

      Yeah, I kinda needed a new blog because I don't know I haven't updated in a while. I think it's time to do so. So, currently my life is going through so much shit. Where can I start? Well here we go, first off, Financial problems...  I need $300, fucking sucks, tomorrow(wednesday) I gotta go to traffic school and pay $140 cause of a speeding ticket it wont be fun. So today I'm going to go sell my bass and amp with Brett That'll give me some money then I'm gonna borrow money from my brother hopefully. Yup, I got two jobs but non of them give me money. I love one of my jobs, Zumiez haven't worked a single hour but I just love the idea of how that job is. Selling clothing in a competetive manner. It funny that when you look at jobs even if they are at the mall they are serious things. Businesses selling stuff to get money. It's great, then Wendy's I honestly don't want to work there at all! Fuck Wendy's!  Well, then stuff happens, school. Well, I feel happy that I will finally be able to get out of school. So here is the deal, I'm taking a college class, it's called Chef Prep, it's awesome because I'll get to learn how to cook and get a certificate that say I can handle food. Can't wait! It'll be so much fun, the bad thing will be the drive too get there, it's like 15 minues away on the freeway, that means 10 miles or something, hehe Counting traffic and stuff. It'll suck all the gas I'm going to consume I hope my dad loosens so he gives me money to get there. Then after the collge class I'll go to highscool. It's going to be allright. So yeah, I'm graduating early because I want to work and get money. So after I graduate I'll have like 6 months before starting College to make shitloads of money. This time I think I'll be able to work at Convergys, nothing better than inbound telemarketing just what I'm good at. $8/hour... then My Zumiez job, yup... it's gonna be so much fun! I'm not being sarcastic. Maybe I'll even leave college off for a year and work for couple months I'll have lots of money and be able to get some shit.  So, school... That's the one I'm almost out, I'm kinda scared because it means the real world and be determined to fucking make decicions. I don't want to. But oh well, life that's how it goes. I'll have my own house, family, life, it's going to be great, can't wait for it to happen yet scared to see it.  Well, now to love life... Man everything is soo complicated and I really haven't had a chance to let people know about my feelings and how they really are and my situation with Tiffany, so here it goes.   So, Tiffany and I, we are a really strange couple, we never were friends, The first day we met she made me kiss her on the lips, I was scared to make out, she wanted that. Second day we made out. But yeah, we are attracked to each other. We really don't have much in common, we don't like the same things in life. We have different point of views in life. The only thing we got in common is that we both have developed love for each other. That's what keeps us together. To be honest I want to break up with her, but the thing is that I don't want to at the same time becuase I enjoy being with her and I enjoy her presence... What I know is that once we break up we will have nothing in common and we wont be able to be friends so that's why I haven't broken up with her. I don't want to hurt her. I love her but I'm not in love with her and I have a strong belief in music... I don't know why... like the whole scene I'm a punker/emo/skater dude so I should date a female of that kid. not a girl that listen to hip-hop and shit... It's just weird... god! Then we have Alyssa, got I love that girl she makes me soo happy! i'm in love with her... That's it I want to spend the rest of my life with her... yup... Anyway...  I don't know what else to write so when I need to i'll write again.
