       So as the title reads, I'm pretty much new to this blog thing. Well, I just got back from watching  Harold and Kumar Go to White Castle . The promos looked promising and I have to say that the film turned out to be pretty entertaining. A little ridiculous at times but overall very funny. The trip to and fro the movie theatre was a mess. It was pouring cats and dogs and it made for some hazardous driving sitches. I was relieved to get back home in one piece.  Before heading out I managed to complete an AP/AR image and I uploaded it to the  AgeMagic  Yahoo! Group. For those not familiar with AP or AR, AP stands for  Age Progression  and AR stands for  Age Regression . I have a talent for doctoring photos with my trusty computer and Photoshop. Not just any doctoring - in Age Progression, I take a picture of a young person in their 20's or 30's and I'm able, through the help of my imagination and my knowledge of anatomy, to age that person several years... be it 10, 20, 30 or even 40 or 50 years. In Age Regression, which I'm just beginning to experiment with, I'm able to take a picture of an older person and make them appear younger in it. I find AR a little more difficult than AP but that could just be because I'm not comfortable with it yet.  My most recent AP/AR image is of actress  Keira Knightley  and her mother. One of the members of the Agemagic group had posted a candid picture of Keira and her mother walking side by side. In it Keira's mother looks old and haggard but she's wearing youthful clothing: sneakers, blue jeans and a spaghetti-strap top; quite a stark, visual contrast. The member who posted it suggested that it kind of looked like someone had deliberately AP'ed the mom from young to old. That got me thinking... what if Keira and her mom swapped ages? I liked the idea of the challenge of age-regressing her mom since I had tried age-regressing a person's picture only once before. To see a sample of what I came up with  urlLink click here .  So why did I post the image to the AgeMagic group? AgeMagic is a female AP club. I've been a member of it for about a year now. It's a place for the posting of pictures and stories whose primary plot is that of female age progression. This could be young girls to adult women or older, young women to old women, or female children to adults. I prefer stories and images of the young or adult women to old women. I've created and posted quite a few images that feature AP'ed versions of female celebrities. The other members get a kick out of that. Although, I take it too far for some of them. I have a tendency to age women into their 70's or 80's. Those members wish that I had stopped aound 50. In any case, I'm just fascinated by the process of ageing. Always have been. Well, at least since the age of 5 and I don't really know why. If there's a psychology major out there who might be able to shed some light on this, I'd be greatly appreciative. I think young women are gorgeous. I find older women beautiful. And I find the aging process, the transformation from young to old, fascinating.  Well, I guess I'll end my 2nd post here.
