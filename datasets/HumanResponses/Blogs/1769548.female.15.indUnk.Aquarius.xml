        Hey dad look at me  Think back and talk to me  Did I grow up according to plan?  Do you think I'm wasting my time doing things I wanna do?  but it hurts when you disapprove all along   And now I try hard to make it  I just want to make you proud  I'm never gonna be good enough for you  I can't pretend that  I'm alright  And you can't change me   'Cuz we lost it all  Nothing lasts forever  I'm sorry  I can't be perfect  Now it's just too late and  We can't go back  I'm sorry  I can't be perfect     I try not to think  About the pain I feel inside   Did you know you used to be my hero?   All the days you spend with me  Now seem so far away  And it feels like you don't care anymore    And now I try hard to make it  I just want to make you proud  I'm never gonna be good enough for you  I can't stand another fight  And nothing's alright      Nothing's gonna change the things that you said       Nothing's gonna make this right again  Please don't turn your back  I can't believe it's hard  Just to talk to you  But you don't understand     -sImPlE pLaN-   gah..ive been hearin this song forever but i nvr really listened to it...and i swear this is soooo how i feel about me n my "dads" relationship..i swear..music plays such a great deal in my life..i really odnt kno if i would be here if it wasnt fro music..it took me out of suicidal moods..it puts me in good moods...it just is soo important to me...ok...this post is prolly gay but i just had to write this for sum odd reason...                       -lauren-

       Hey yaw!! gah iono what was wrong w/ me yesterday but i was in the worst mood.. im soooo sorry if i was rude to anybody!! i felt horrible after i got out of my real bad mood...i hate it when ppl are mad at me or anything...but yaw i was lookin thru poems yesterday and i found this real sad one..here it is:  Misty    My name is Misty I am but three  My eyes are swolleen I cannot see  I must not be loved for I am punished by cigarette burns  I must do right I can't do wrong or else I'm locked up all day long  When I wake up I'm all alone the house is dark  my folks aren't home  Im really just an expensive joke no more no less then speed or coke  Be quiet now! I hear the car my dad is back from Charlie's Bar  I hear him curse my name he calls I squeeze myself against the wall  on my bed its too late his face is twisted into hate  I feel the pain again and again  Oh dear God please let it end  My name is Misty I am but three last night my father murdered me....  OMG! isnt that the saddest thing ever?!? but then i found this other poem the other day that really makes me feel like ppl need to hear it..its about drinkin and drivin..i HATE alcohol...it has ruined lots of things in my life..so heres the poem:  *Near to the door* *he paused to stand* *as he took his class ring*  *off her hand* *all who were watching*  *did not speak* *as a silent tear* *ran down his cheek*  *and through his mind* *the memories ran* *of the moments they walked* *and ran in the sand hand and hand*  *but now her eyes were so terrible cold* *for he would never again* *have her to hold* *they watched in silence* *as he bent near*  *and whispered the words..* *"I LOVE YOU" in her ear*  *he touched her face and started to cry*  *as he put on his ring and wanted to die* *and just then the wind began to blow*  *as they lowered her casket* *into the snow....* *this is what happens*  *to man alive.....*  *when friends let friends....* *drink and drive.*   i think i'll leave with that..i hope you all kno the consequences of your actions...

       Let's go back Back to the beginning Back to when the earth, the sun, the stars all aligned  'Cause perfect didn't feel so perfect Trying to fit a square into a circle Was no life I defy  CHORUS: Let the rain fall down And wake my dreams Let it wash away My sanity 'Cause I wanna feel the thunder I wanna scream Let the rain fall down I'm coming clean, I'm coming clean  I'm shedding Shedding every color Trying to find a pigment of truth Beneath my skin  'Cause different Doesn't feel so different And going out is better Than always staying in Feel the wind  Chorus  I'm coming clean Let the rain fall Let the rain fall I'm coming clean  Chorus  Let's go back Back to the beginning  -HiLaRy DuFf-  y'all i LOVE music! i relaly do...ive noticed i almost always put a song on here..hah..but this song i just heard the other day and i loved it..ive been listenin to it for the past couple of days...i love it..haha...i love music..im a CHOIR FREAK!!

       I don't know what it is tonight, Your smile, Your eyes. Yeah...  Even in the candle light, You shine, So bright. You are so beautiful, More beautiful, Than you've ever been. I catch my breath, And fall in love again.  I can't imagine where I'd be Without you with me. I need you more everyday, More than words can say.  I want you in my life, For all my life. This night will never end. You'll take my hand, And I'll fall in love again.  And nothing short of a miracle Could have brought you here to me. When I'm with you, Heaven's all I see (All I see)  Caught up in every touch, I feel the rush, Of this moment that we're in. Each time we kiss, I fall in love again.  I can't resist, I fall in love again. ::.NiCk LaChEy.:: omg..y'all i thought that was the SWEETEST song..sorry i just wanted to put this on here..oh yeh and i wanted to tell Kc: even if i dont get to see you as much as i want to i will always love you! i love you soo mcuh babie..you are everything to me..i dont kno what i would do without you..honestly..you help me soo much babie..im so in love with you...

       Watching every motion i my foolish lover's game On this endless ocean finally lovers know no shame Turning and returning to some secret place inside Watching in slow motion as you turn around and say...my love  Take my breath away Take my breath away  Watching I keep waiting still anticipating love Never hesitating so become the fated ones...oh yeah Turning and returning to some secret place to find Watching in slow motion as you turn to me and say....my love  Take my breath away Take my breath away  Through the hourglass I saw you In time you slipped away When the mirror crashed I called you And turned to hear you say If only for today I am unafraid  Take my breath away Take my breath away  You take my breath You take my breath You take my breath.....away  You take my breath away You take my breath away You take my breath away ((JeSsIcA sImPsOn))  yall..i LOVEEE that song..its soo pretty and its soo freakin sweet!!!

       I could live a thousand years,  if i could be alone with you, you. and every second of my life,  i would never play the fool,  never turn my back to you. i was the one who saw you first, a grain in the sands of the universe, i never knew what was ahead me. now im out of the eyes of the wintertime, and here in the sun   chorus: ill stay inside your shades of love, makes one day forever. and when july has come and gone, this day will last forever.   when i see the way you look, the way you look my way, through the rain, and the water crashing down washes both of us away away  i was the one who saw you first, a grain in the sands of the universe, i never knew what was ahead of me. now im out of the eyes of the wintertime and heres in the sun..   chorus   i could live a thousand years, if i could be alone with you. and here in the sun ill stay inside your shades of love makes one day forever. and when july has come and gone, this day will last forever. im here inside your shades of love  makes one day forever one day forever one day forever one day forever   (( eMpTy TrAsH ))  i LOVE that song..i was watchin "HoLiDaY iN tHe SuN" today..haha..a MaRy-KaTe AnD aShLeY movie i kno! haha..but i love that movie! this song made me really think about *Kc*..i love him soo much and i really wish there was more i could say to really show it..i mean i just cant put it in words..im inlove with him..i kno in my heart of hearts that i am..i kno that i want to be with this person for as long as GoD will let me..i kno that i would do ANYTHiNG for him..I LOVE HIM! i just hope i never lose him...

       -Fall in love again-  I don't know what it is tonight, Your smile, Your eyes. Yeah...  Even in the candle light, You shine, So bright. You are so beautiful, More beautiful, Than you've ever been. I catch my breath, And fall in love again.  I can't imagine where I'd be Without you with me. I need you more everyday, More than words can say.  I want you in my life, For all my life. This night will never end. You'll take my hand, And I'll fall in love again.  And nothing short of a miracle Could have brought you here to me. When I'm with you, Heaven's all I see (All I see)  Caught up in every touch, I feel the rush, Of this moment that we're in. Each time we kiss, I fall in love again.  I can't resist, I fall in love again.  ((NiCk LaChEy))   aww..you guys that song is soo freakin sweet! gosh..*Kc* is in aLaBaMa rite now..and i cant talk to him for 5 days...i MiSS MY BABiE!!! i love you soo much Kc!!! you mean soo much to me i cant even begin to put into words how special you are to me..i never ever want to lose you!!!!!!! no one will EVER be able to take your place!

       Never Alone  I waited for you today But you didn't show No no. I needed you today So where did you go? You told me to call Said you'd be there And though I haven't seen you  Are you still there?   Chorus I cried out with no reply And I can't feel you by my side So I'll hold tight to what I know You're here and I'm never alone   And though I cannot see you And I can't explain why Such a deep reassurance  You've placed in my life. We cannot separate 'Cause you're part of me. And though you're invisible I'll trust the unseen.   Chorus   -bArLoWgIrL-  im lovin this song guys..me and the gYrLS recorded this song..haha..its an amazing song..i can TOTALLY relate to it..i just feel like God isnt always there..and i had been feeling like that for a while until i heard this song and then it reminded me that God is ALWAYS there even when we dont feel him..like the song says we are NEVER ALONE..this song is truly amazing..i love it.. well..ive noticed i never really write in this thing unless its to put a song up or sumthin..hah..im such a LoSeR! haha..well im gone!

       ..this song is soo awesome..   Average Girl   So what I'm not your average girl I don't meet the standards of this world Chasing after boys is not my thing See I'm waiting for a wedding ring    Chorus No more dating I'm just waiting Like sleeping beauty  My prince will come for me No more dating  I'm just waiting 'Cause God is writing my love story   Boys are bad; that's certainly not true 'Cause God's preparing one for you If you get tired waiting till he comes God's arms are the perfect place to run   Chorus   Bridge  Sleep - that's the only thing for me 'Cause when I sleep   God's preparing one for me   Chorus
