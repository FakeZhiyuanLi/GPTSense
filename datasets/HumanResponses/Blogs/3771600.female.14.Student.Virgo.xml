      I know that there's a biblical reason for fornication and all the complications like STDs and how condoms don't give you the 100% protection. Pre-marital sex has all these and more I know, but the question that I asked was why does it have to be such a taboo? Why does it have to be such a taboo until you cannot talk about it openly? What happened to proper sex education? Let people do what they want about their lives-whether or not they want to unwrap that special present is their business not ours.  About homosexuality, I think that they are just people confused about their sexuality, but that does not give us a right to ostracise them, does it? They probably just need more time to really find out bout themselves but we, instead of giving them advice or a helping hand, treat them like sub-humans. I don't want to give you guys the wrong impressoion about my parents-they don't encourage pre-marital sex nor do they oppose it either. They strongly oppose sleeping around and one-night stands- believe me, they do.

      I was talking to somebody yesterday about the cultural differences between Western culture and Eastern culture. Firstly, about pre-marital sex..My parents have been pretty open about this topic, so I knew about it when I was quite young- around 7 maybe. I've been given free rein to do whatever I want with my life but anything that I do, I must accept the consequences- good or bad. In eastern culture, it is normal to be a virgin or lose your virginity only when you're married. I was brought up differently, you can have pre-marital sex BUT you must know what you are getting into and what the possible consequences are..Why does the eastern culture regard sex as a taboo?? That I don't understand. There was one columnist in the STAR newspaper who said that her child thought that if you kiss the opposite sex, you can get a baby. How ridiculous is that? I mean, I'm fine with the "don't have sex till u're married" thing but why does it have to be such a taboo until kids don't get their proper sex education? I acknowledge the fact that pre-marital sex can lead to unplanned pregnancies and other messy situations.. But why make it such a taboo? Now, about homosexuality. I have a couple of homosexual friends who tell me their problems- our society's view of them, their family's views and acceptance. They are just normal human beings who breathe, eat, and drink but they just are attracted to members of their gender. I don't see why it's so hard for people to accept them. They are just humans. And yet we treat them like outcasts. With all that said, I've got to go now..bye! p.s.: I'd really appreciate feedback! Thanks!
