       I seem to have a blog. Whether or not this will prove an interesting addition to my (and your) lifestyle remains to be seen. For now, this post is just a  test  to see if I can arrange this blog to suit my fancy. I'll write more soon, of course. That is, after all, the point. :)

       Well, here I am again.  I've spent some time fiddling with the look of this page until I am temporarily satisfied with the results. What remains to be found now is a topic...something interesting and preferably not too serious. Life is too serious most of the time. I don't feel like contributing to that at the moment.  Here's something not too serious (which people take seriously): football. Well, actually, in this case I'm talking about what we Americans call  soccer . Officially, the Euro 2004 championship football games.   Now, I happen to live with Portuguese people, and their team is one of the two finalists (along with Greece). They're not even diehard sports fans. I rarely seem them watch any other sorts of games throughout the year. But Euro 2004 is an all-pervasive infectious aura of enthusiasm, anxiety, and general fanaticism. So these normally rather non-sports-oriented people are presently glued to the Euro 2004 reports and occasionally to the games themselves (when they can endure the stress).   When they were watching a game in which Portugal was involved, I felt inclined to hide myself in another portion of the house and avoid all the jumping up and down, yelling things and manly exclamations of encouragement and athletic superiority. The championship game should be a riot. :)  And I mean that literally. I live in Brussels, the capital of the EU, so every country has representives to send into the street for a massive party or expression of grave dissappointment at every conceivable opportunity.   But, anyway, what it comes to is...I don't get it. I can admire the skill of the athletes, sure. Some of them are incredible. But I just don't feel even remotely as intensely passionate about every moment. Maybe it would be different if I was born in Europe and had a team to feel passionately about. I don't know.  I do feel passionately about some other things, like the online game I run, or cats, or about the greatness of my fiancé. But I don't dress up like someone from my game (you should see the soccer fans in their flags and war paint), nor do I wear T-shirts that say "I   Cats", nor do I jump up and down yelling with empassioned joy when my fiancé comes home from work. So this sports phenomenon has to be somehow different.  I love seeing people so happy, really. It's really inspirational to see Portuguese news broadcasting the massive crowds of people lining the roads on the work day just to cheer their team on for the bus ride between the hotel and stadium. And the players themselves look nearly as majestic as their fans worship to be, crossing themselves as they enter the field and standing proudly as their national anthem is played.  My father once explained to me that modern day sports have taken the place of the wars of old. We cheer for our army (team) as our favorite and most skilled warriors (players) step onto another battlefield (stadium) to fight for honor and glory (that much is the same). Only here there is no intentional bloodshed. There are rules and regulations to make sure everyone has a safe and wholesome experience.  Sure, sometimes some of the fans get out of hand, but it's not nearly as destructive as actual warfare. And everyone ends up feeling closer with their fellows (either in victory or defeat) and has something interesting to discuss for weeks to come. It seems like a healthy enough outlet don't you think?  I've played sports before, myself, (yes, really!) and I remember what it was like to be on a team, with the fans shouting from the side and the exhileration of working together as a whole unit to accomplish the singular two objectives of putting the ball in the other team's net and preventing them from putting it in ours. (This was field hockey, mind you. Not soccer.)   But even though I played, and found that immensely enjoyable, I was never an outsider fan of any sport at all. I never collected baseball cards. I resented when I wasn't able to make a sound about the house because my father was eating all the pretzels and staring at the (American) football game on Sunday. I got out my embroidery or a book whenever I was visiting someone who was terribly into watching the latest golf/bowling/tennis match. I think baseball is more fun to watch than anything, but perhaps that's due to fond memories of going to see the Phillies with my Dad (and Mom and sister and Grandma) as a kid.  So while I don't actually feel a part of the sports fan club in general, I can appreciate why people are very enthusiastic. Considering that this passtime is nonharmful (unless you drink too much and break things with your exuberance), healthy (if you play it yourself), enhances a sense of comradery among fans of the same team, and helps a lot of people to better enjoy their life, I can clearly and elegantly dub sports a good thing. :)
