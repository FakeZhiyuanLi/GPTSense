      I couldn't keep my promise of updating this 3 times a day. Oh well! Here's to trying again. I was taking hostage by an addiction called billiards, more specifically online 8-ball. And wasn't let go until I couldn't take my bad odor and proceeded to shower. Eww! (I know) but after all that loss of sleep it took a big hit on me this morning and I missed going to school for the 3rd time. I got to tell ya, 8-ball along with chatting to the other player at the same time is really cool and then the fear of losing your credits adds to the addictiveness (I got $2.00 remaining from the $5.00)

      Anyways even though I did skip a day today's the one that matters since 17 years ago I was born in a city known as McAllen.  And hopefully I'll get a new digital camera for a present. Anyways yesterday I was on the computer all day trying to make a website and learning how to animate in Flash MX and finished a measly 2 second animation that said a clip "the world is a vampire", from Despite All My Rage by Smashing Pumpkins. Well if you want to see the sorry excuse of a (Chobits)website I made then just click   urlLink HERE  I also working on another website made entirely of one picture via layers and slices in Photoshop. Well from now on I'm gonna try to update my thingy here 3 times a day. Here hoping I can!    "Computers are useless. They can only give you answers."  Pablo Picasso.

      Well I was gone battling a virus, an annoying piece of shat that had burrowed itself into my computer after I used a fake crack for a ____ program. ^_^ I'm not saying what I was trying to hack, but I will say this...It certainly taught me a lesson and I ain't gettin' near another one of those "cracks". I was able to get rid of it after first going to an online virus "sweeper" that destroys everything that looks like virus and had put itself in every folder that contained the word "share". I think it was trying to spread whenever I shared something with other people.  Anyways...It couldn't delete a process that was running in the background "explored.exe"   Okay that's it...Oh yeah!...Finally I'm gonna download ep 89 of Naruto from [Anbu-AonE] today as soon as I finish downloading this giant .torrent dowload of 5157.0 MB!  5 #$@*&#%! gig's!  Ohhh, the power of bittorrent!    I also made some funny animated gifs that I ripped straight from videogames: Mario running      (Mario 1) Mario running      (Mario Advance) Mario walking away (Mario & Luigi: Superstar Saga) Mario running      (Mario 3) Link running       (Zelda:Link to the Past)

      Hey it's Friday!  No Summer school today and I got up around 4:46 I was checking if the (translated version) Anbu-AonE_Naruto 89 episode had been released since the raw(not translated) one was cool to have but, all I really want is to understand whats going on.  I did get a version of episode 89 translated by some no-name group called SG that just used the dialogue from the manga and put it on the episode.  Well hope it comes out soon.  Okay...what else...Oh yeah more funny Flash movies I want to link:   urlLink History of Fuck   urlLink Free your Mind  (it's a funny Matrix parody with a...squirrel...thingy. Maybe a chipmunk?)  Well enough of this. Loading...    All computers are designed to be a perfect machine without mistake, until the first person touches them.

      It's hard...and plus I gotta sleep to make up for all the late hours I stay up. Sometimes I don't even sleep and stay awake through the night like today for example, and the very reason that I'm writing this.  Did I mention I'm 16........Anyway I am, and My B-day is June 29 (5 days from now).  So that means I still go to school and there's this punishment called "Summer school" that you receive for not doing your work in class.  And guess who's the lucky person that gets that beautiful prize?  You guessed it. It's almost over and that means I get to have my head glued to computer monitor all day.^_^  And now for that Naruto. If you haven't heard of this anime before  Anyway it's over for now see you later!         ^_^ anime rules!   urlLink narutofan.com      urlLink narutochaos.com        the bigger the cushion, the better the pushing -fat clown from "House of a Thousand Corpses"

      Well it seems I forgot that I have a blog and haven't posted. But that's all right cause chances are that nobody saw this. Anyway I was too busy posting stuff at  urlLink [adult swim]   and I guess I enjoyed it too much wasn't productive at all. Wait a minute....yes it was! I found a link to some funny flash animations all about Mario and they are hilarious some are sad and epic.    funny ones   (some guys humming the song with drums...rocking!)  urlLink http://www.albinoblacksheep.com/flash/mario.php    Mario dying  (it's pretty much Mario dying)  urlLink http://www.geocities.com/Funny_Blast/mariodeath.html    Sad Ones   Part 1  urlLink Part 2   urlLink Part 3    urlLink Part 4    Well that's pretty much it.

      Well right now it's 12:47 and I'm just about ready to go to sleep.  Today when they picked me up it was Sargeant Farias who came in my recruiter's car.  We go a little lost when looking for another guy cause Farias doesn't know the area that well.  While looking for the guy we asked someone for directions and ended up giving the guy a ride(I think he was an illegal) anyways we found him then went to the office and waited and finally left to PT.     We stretched then did some exercises and alternated between that and pull-ups(starting from one to 6 then down) .  After that we ran, and as always I got tired and was left behind.  When we finished we left to the office again, got weighed, then waited while Master Gunnery yelled at the Sargeants.  After a while we left and Sargeant Mojica took me and Hernandez home, I asked a lot of questions and found out that once I go to San Antonio to enlist I can wear a Marines t-shirt and he would hook me up with the ones at the office.  I got home ate  chicken and showered and eventually found myself to the computer to write this.    And about this weekend, I went both Saturday and Sunday to PT.  On Saturday alot of people went including a new guy which threw-up after running(I was just left behind) and on Sunday only me and Veltran went to PT with Sargeant Mojica(my recruiter).  I had to wear a white, plastic, trash-bag under my clothes to help me sweat and after a while I just took it off cause it was killing me.  He treated us with a Gatorade "Thirst Buster" from Circle-K and we went back to the office and got weighed.    I didn't sleep that Sunday until today at 11:00 am..........as a matter of fact I think I'll go to sleep now since it's 1:18 am....NIGHT

      Okay right now it's 4:47 and I'm about to leave to go to PT(Physical Training, Marines) I think the guys that pick me up will be here any minute so I writing this in a hurry and drinking as much water as I can so I won't get dehydrated so fast.  And today in the morning my internet was down(as alwaysj, damn you Time Warner!) so I just slept since 11:00 till 4:30 and I hadn't slept at all I stayed up  until 11:00 am  and finally couldn't anymore okay so I'll leave this and go get ready.

      Well Monday I did go to training and I actually lasted longer in the running, since my parents had to sign some papers to let me in the Marines all I did was stay after they left and later I found out that one of the Sargeants(a chick, really hot) that was there while the Major talked to my parents was going to come to the PT.  So all the guys were like, "Whoa she's got hot legs(she had really short shorts)" And as always I wasn't able to make all the laps around the track.  The hot Sargeant was pulling me and I stilll couldn't make it, and when it was almost over the two other chicks  were pulling me(enjoyed it, but embarassing)    After the guys dropped me off I decided that I was going to cut off all my "beautiful" hair off.  So when I got home I woke up my sleeping Mom and asked her to cut the hair off(she was surprised *gasp*).  It turned out the machine didn't work so she tried as much as she could with scissors and the next day we went to the hair place.      And on Tuesday I went again which was kinda good because this time I felt almost no soreness  first of all, the dude that gives me a ride saw the hair-do and was all saying, "Slick!"  Anyways went to get Hernandez(very hot  chick)  And when she saw me she said,  "Wow, almost didn't recognize you"     So we proceeded to pick this apparently lazy guy that doesn't like to go to PT(Physical Training)  so I did the training and this time it was different cause we had to run then stop and do the exercises(it sucked ass)  I was stared by tons of people since I was so far behind the other people.  Oh well, so we went to a store "Circle K" and we got a free drink (a whole 44oz of it) .  Then we went to the recruiting office and waited then I got weighed and found out I was now 202 lb. thats around 3lb of lost weight.  Also my recruiter saw me and was amazed and chuckling at my new hair-do.      Finally I left with the rest of the guys and got home and ate food and got some *hush*   free porn on the internet via "backdoors"    I then slept at around 8:00 am until 5:00 pm the next day(today)        Okay that's pretty much what happened those others days.  And today all I did was sleep all day and eat.

      Well as I said it's Monday and I have to finally go training again and now I have to go early because my parents have to sign papers to give me permission to be in the Marine since I'm 17. And also on a different note, I was going around the net and looking around "naughty" sites (not porn) but serial, patch related sites and I said yes to one of those windows that pops up. Guess what happened? Facking spyware that's what happened!     Oh the pain! Internet Explorer sucks! So now I'm using Mozilla. And I still can't get rid of the fecking spyware.

      Well today I got up and was surprised to find out that I'm not in so much pain anymore and maybe I'll go to the Marine training today.&nbsp; But I doubt I'll be able to take all the exercise.&nbsp;  &nbsp; And for a while this stupid blog broke and it wouldn't show the stuff on the right, I later found out it was the code that Flickr uses when I sent a picture to the blog.&nbsp; Oh well.&nbsp; I'll surf more net.

      Well after I wrote the update on Thursday I went at 6:00 pm to train for the first time, and boy&nbsp;was it hard and very tough.&nbsp; I have to admit that I'm not in the best shape weighing in 205lb. at 5ft. 7.5 in.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Today&nbsp;which I still consider Friday (it's 3:59am right now) I was supposed to be picked up by the other soon-to-be Marines but got lucky and never was.&nbsp; It doesn't matter anyway, because I don't think I would be able to handle it since today I'm  VERY SORE.   &nbsp;  Well I guess today ( technically Saturday) I'll do better.

      Well lot's has happened since my internet was gone. On Tuesday I was called by a Marine recruiting guy and was told about the Marines and If I wanted to sign up, I said yes and I didn't sleep at all, around 8:30am the next day I went over to Wal-Mart and took a little hiring test thing at the store in one of their little machines that they have, and when I came back I went straight to the toilet...then the bed and slept until 2:47? The recruiter was going to come to my house at 3:00 so I got ready, I took a test to see if I could be elegible to just sign up as a Marine.   Well I passed and then for the rest of the day I just was on the internet looking around and downloading playstation iso's, but this time I was going to go to sleep because I had to wake up the next day(today) at 11:00 to got to the office they had and give me a presentation about the Marines and such well I got back home at around 2:30 and then just munched on some Funyuns and found out the internet was back so I first put the CD I got from the Marine stuff and then this.  [a little note: I broke my keyboard while writing and now it's 4:10 I posted on____...well look on the time posted]    "Pain is just weakness escaping the body", The Marines

      Well I checked everywhere and haven't found a trace of them releasing it.  Well from now on I hate them!  I didn't update yesterday cause I was busy "upgrading" to Microsoft Office 2003.     urlLink Now some great music (some guys humming Mario song with drums)     If it weren't for electricity we'd all be watching television by candlelight

      Even though I have already seen episode 90 of Naruto, I'm still eager to see the Anbu-AonE sub.  So I've been paciently waiting since and I also already saw the DBZ episodes and getting ready to see the brand new batch consisting of: DBZ eps 41-50 that finished downloading this morning.  I don't think I'm gonna download anymore until I can buy some CDs to empty my poor "bloated" hardrive. Oh! If only you knew how many things are in that thing.  Anyways I'm off to watch those nice classic nostalgia inducing episodes.      Don't you wish there were a knob on the TV to turn up the intelligence? There's one marked 'Brightness,' but it doesn't work. Gallagher

      After I downloaded Naruto 90 RAW yesterday I found out that it had over writed another episode I had, which was really weird.  Well I just got it again and I haven't seen it since then.   Today I woke up around 12 in the afternoon and started watching the brand new episode I had been downloading yesterday (eps 21-30).  Half-way through watching them I remembered about the new episode 90 and by then someone had to have already subbed(translated)it, and for sure after going to  urlLink Narutofan.com  there was a quick sub by the group sganime.    While it downloaded I watched more of the classic DBZ episodes and then after 26 minutes it was done and immediately started watching it (it was great).  I proceeded with the great DBZ episodes but a feeling came over me after watching Naruto and that was the urge to watch more!...more!  Anyways I was a good peer and shared the episode 90 until my sharing rate was more than 1.0 :-) [i use BitTornado] Then around 4:00 I started downloading eps 31-40 and still downloading right now (8:34 pm)   Oh well I'll just "surf the net" now.    Computers are useless, they just give you answers

      Well it's Wednesday July 7th and that means that Naruto 90 is finally going to be out soon. I already have the RAW(un-translated) version but I really want that [Anbu-AonE) release.   My little brother was mostly the one that celebrated the 4th of July, because I was inside enjoying spider-man 2...*hush* *hush*.  Then Monday I finally started going to school again but I got there late.   And Tuesday which was the most important days of the whole summer, I overslept and missed the final test!    So today, even though I knew I had no chance of taking it again, I went to school and found out I have to wait until November.  So that was it, and my mom had left already. So I first went to the restroom then walked around and ended up outside in the front of the school. It was around 8:00 and the morning was very hot and humid and there was very little shade. But I waited until 9:00 and finally gave up and called my mom to pick me up. Cause I was not about to wait until the usual time she picked me up i.e. 10:00.  Anyways a very  funky  feeling started coming up around my stomach...yes it was the diarrhea. So now it wasn't just waiting in the hot sun, but a race to go to the toilet. [i think it was the orange i drank in the morning]  Okay that was alot of info, maybe even too much. But that was my morning. In the afternoon I started watching the 10 episodes of DBZ I downloaded off a torrent eps. 11-20. Then after I finished I started downloading 21-30 which I'm still downloading right now. Which technically is already Thursday, well until next update. I think I'll check for that episode 90 of Naruto now.

      I found out the hard way that you're not allowed to link pictures from your geocities account. So I had to take it off instead of seeing that little red thing on the corner when something's not loaded (you know what I'm talking about? Oh well!)  But forget that, something even scarier than that happened yesterday. Yesterday at 6:00pm my  cable went out so that means my internet connection goes, "Bye Bye!" Until Today at around 3:00pm! it came back so I'm happy now and immediately went to play some online 8-ball :h)  Well that's All I got to tell myself in case I ever forget what happened this day......wait......what!?

      Well Sunday I left to San Antonio to enlist in the Marines.  It was really hot in the shuttle and I was in the back and really packed........but next to a chick!  We lasted 5 hours in that van and finally got in to the hotel I find out that I wasn't in the list and had to wait and finally was given the card to go to my room.  I left my stuff in the room and me and the other guy that wasn't in the list looked around the hotel for all the rest of the people but couldn't find them.  I finally saw my roomate and he told me where the place to eat was.  I ate porkchops with mashed potatoes.  I then went to my room and changed so I could go to the excercise room and did the bicycle thing then the treadmill thing for an hour.  While in their I met a couple of guys and one guy helped me with the running thing.
