         Well, this week has been hectic.  I have a corps member who has decided to go home (for good).  It's someone I like in particular and it's made things a little bit crazy.  In this case in particular I truly feel like a "mother hen" and that is weird for me.     The rest of the TL's came back from spike today.  It's great seeing everyone again, but it's also a lot of chaos.  My last day of work is today, their having a dinner party for us.  Then tomorrow starts "legacy weekend" which is a celebration of the 10th year anniversary for NCCC.  Over 700 alumni should be present.  Interesting.     So this is officially the last day of second round.  I will be saying goodbye to my current team after this weekend and then hello to my "shuffle" team.  There is also some talk to a trip to South Dakota over memorial day weekend as we have Monday and Tuesday off.  I'm still as busy as I was after first round, but at least I can see what's in front of me now.

         Well, I am now a year older (and wiser??)  Wyoming was beautiful...but really there are not words to describe it.  I saw "Old Faithful"  but it was rainy and cold.  When we left there was a snow storm.  The area that I visited is close to where I will be in Montana, so I now have an idea of what is in store for me (weather wise) for the next 10 weeks.     This is the last week until transition week, spike teams are now beginning to come home and then we will all prepare to leave again...onto round 3

        Well, I had my first conference call with the sponsor today - oddly enough his name is Rich (all my sponsors so far have been named Rich).  We have compiled the new teams and I will meet with them for the first time the beginning of June.  From the looks of it, the new team is going to be interesting...but I figure I've done this before with less information and less experience...so how bad could it be?????     The good news is that Montana is supposed to be beautiful the time of year we will be there and there is a chance that there will be some horseback riding and hiking in the mountains on the agenda - plus a three day weekend every week.     I'll post whenever there is something new in the mix.

        Plans they are a'changin'.  I am now no longer taking a road trip to Idaho solo, I have decided to meet up with a fellow team leader in Montana and take a road trip with her.  She is staying on a Crow Indian reservation and they are having a pow-wow over July 4th weekend so the festivities will begin there.  After that we are heading to South Dakota to see the Black Hills, Mt. Rushmore, and the Badlands.  Then onto North Dakota to see the Theordore Roosevelt National Forest.  After that we will hopefully make it to Glacier National Part in Montana and if we make it there we will probably make it to Idaho for a quick scenic drive.  Needless to say I am very excited!      The team has decided (democratically) on what the new assignments will be once we get back from vacation.  I will be working with the archeologist working on some excavation - imagine that!  A real live anthropologist!  Actually including myself there are three anthroplogy majors on the team - which is weird because one does not commonly find anthropology majors growing out of the woodwork.  More proof that I live in the twilight zone.

        I am definatly off to Idaho on the 2nd of July.  I am renting a car and staying near the Salmon Forest.  I am going to try to get to Washington and/or Oregon along the way, but it depends on how much I feel like driving and how much money I have.     The weather has now warmed, and we've been told that it will only get hotter.  It's been in the mid-eighties all week.  The "fire hazard" has also went up to "moderate" instead of low.  There are signs on the road that show you what the risk is.  It's supposed to stay around 90-100 for the rest of the summer. Luckily, humidity is really low so at night or in the shade, it cools quite a bit.     My team continues to be great.  I still can't beleive I live in such a beautiful place.  I will get some pictures back tomorrow and I am excited to see us in the victorian fashion show.     did i tell you that there is no "open container" law in Montana?  Basically you're allowed to drink and drive.  and pubilc intoxication is not a nuissance.

         well computer access gets easier and easier to come by these days.  It is the first day of summer, and thus the "longest day of the year" which means that it will be even harder to fall asleep because it's always so light out.  Waking up at 6am is tough stuff sometimes!   did i tell you that I two-stepped with a cowboy the other night.  I know, it's weird. it was extra funny because he was about 6'5.  Good times for sure.  I also slept outside the other night.  There is one  guy on my team who religiously sleeps in the hammock and I thought it would be fun to sleep outside too. I took mycot onto my roof and slept under the stars...well actually I slept huddled in my sleeping bag because it was so friggin' cold outside - then a bug somehow flew into my sleeping bag and I had to get it out.  having to go to the bathroom (twice) was no picnic either.   So i've decided that I will be sleeping outside often, but i think i will wait until the weather warms a bit and it's not such a pain to get in and out of the  sleeping bag.  the stars are beautiful, though. you can easily see the milky way.

        It is now Friday and things continue to be well in Virginia City.  It is nice to have a day off. Last night we all went down to the bar and met some of the "Virginia City Players" who are a theatre troup here for the summer. They were really cool and we are supposed to hang out at some time in the future.     I think I am going to take a road trip for the July break.  It will be a bit expensive, but I think I'm going to take off to Idaho and explore a bit more of Montana.  Then I will come home and relax because no one will be here by then.     So I do have internet access.  Only on Fridays though, so if anyone cannot pull themselves together to write via snail mail, don't let that deter you from sending a quick email.     So I think I am losing my Michigan accent and adopting a slightly less nasal one. I noticed it the other day when I said something was on the table, I said "on" weird.  I am also learning how to slow everything down.  I am noticing more and more about myself and my "culture" the farther I am removed from it.  For instance, I did not realize how truly I am from the "east"  I talk fast, walk fast, and have some trouble taking frequent breaks because it makes me feel lazy...this is not the way it is here.  "on time" is a relative term, and it's always a good idea to rest a bit more than you thought was possible.  To "smell the roses" if you will.    I'm happy here.

         Well, with limited internet access this one's going to be short (well that depends on how long this lady talks on the phone before she can help me figure out what's wrong with the computer!!)     Montana is excellent. So far it's everything (and more) that I could have hoped it to be.  It's so nice here I don't even mind nore being able to use the phone.  We do have a phone, but I live with 8 other people, 6 of them girls and you have to fight tooth and nail to get even a small conversation in...I prefer not to participate. I should be able to update these every week or so though.  Depends on what's going on Fridays. We work 4 11 hour days and then have a three day weekend.  Sounds good to me!       The team is great.  Everyone's enjoying their work. We work in teams of two or three and for the past week I have been working with Josh, from West Virginia, doing landscaping, which is a fancy term for weed wacking... or weed eating, which is what he calls it. some others are participating in an archeological dig, doing minor carpentry or cataloging and cleaning antiques.  This weekend we are all participating in a victorian fashion show.  There is a lot of "living history" that we will be volunteering for on the weekends.  Okay well times up...in a nutshell...House is big and great...Sponsor is wonderful....Adjusting to the concept of "frontier time"...weather is chilly, but beautiful...house rests in the hills and the mountains are all around...good times...

        Dun dun dun dun.....The time for my departure is quickly approaching.  Last night it was incredibly hard to get to sleep... For the first time I began to be nervous about leaving.  I have decided not to go to San Fransisco for lack of funds.  Or rather, not because I don't have the funds, but that there is much I want to do in the future that requires funds.    So far I am 97% packed, my room walls are missing some things and my closet is a little sparse.  It's hard to decide what your really going to need for the next 2 1/2 months of your life.  It helps that I have done this before...I am a professional. :)      I will be making a few calls to mom and possibly some friends tonight, but by 8am tomorrow morning I will be off.  We are staying overnight in Seridan, Wyoming and then on to Virginia City, Montana. The stars on the map continue to increase.  I've loaded some good books and am depending on my corps members to load some to.  Plus I've got my trusty journal, which as of late has become my closest friend.      Because I will be there so long and packages are fun to get, the address to send packages to is 303 Wyatt, Virginia City, MT 57955.   All other letter mail can go to the Denver address (746 Boston St, Denver CO 80230) unless I have personally told you otherwise.     I hope all is well in Michigan, for the first time lately I have begun to think of "home" fondly (meaning I'm not depressed about eventually having to go back) :)

      OHMYGODITSJUNE!!!!  Times are crazy around here!!  I just met with my new "shuffle" team and they are awesome!  Everyone is super excited about the round and it seems like we've really got it made up there in Montana.   The team that just returned showed us pictures of the house and it is really nice (and spacious!!)  There's not much by way of furniture, but a girl on my team is bringing her TV/VCR so we will be able to watch movies.     Really I feel that I could leave tomorrow.  I am so excited and only a little bit nervous this time.  I really think the time is going to fly by...and once I get back I will only have one more round to go!     For my July break I am thinking of going to San Fransisco.  I met a team leader from last year at the 10 year celebration and he lives there and is willing to let me crash for the week.     It's so interesting to have a new team.  They all have the last 10 weeks of previous experiences with other TL's and so sometimes I feel like their comparing.  Today when we had our first meeting I got a little freaked out because I really felt like I was starting all over again.  Telling them my standards and how I do things - I hate doing that stuff!  But hopefully they won't try to test the waters too much.     I hope everyone is doing well and enjoying this little site.  Sometimes I feel like I am just rambling on...more to come later....

        Well, we have about 3 1/2 weeks left here in majestic Montana.  The smoke from forest fires in Oregon and Idaho sifts through the Montana atmosphere.  I thought it was just hazy -but then I learned the truth.  No fires in Montana yet.  They mainly happen in August.  Exciting.  But the smoke does get to you - in your eyes and such.    I just found out that I will be "spiking" 4th round but I won't find out until the 9th of August where I will be for that final round.  I think my team is going to Texas or New Mexico - but we'll see what happens.  The team is a bit overwhelmed by the fact that we are almost done with this round.  Everyone is enjoying Montana quite a bit and I don't think anyone really wants to leave (unless they get to go home!)     I'm trying to stay current on the news that's happening - but there is not a national newspaper to be found anywhere where we can go!  NPR is sketchy, coming in and out irradically, and we have no television or other media source.  For the most part I think this is a good thing.  But it's kind of funny when you hear news so long after it happened.  I'm secluded in this little piece of heaven they call Montana.   I am now finished working with the archeologist and next week will begin working with the curators for the duration of the round.  I don't expect that work to be very exciting or interesting - but all the people we work with here are great so I know it won't be bad.

       &nbsp;  So much has occured in the last couple weeks it exhausts me to write about it.&nbsp; But I shall try.&nbsp; My trip through the West-North was amazing.&nbsp; I saw so many things.&nbsp; It began in Lame Deer, MT.&nbsp; There I picked up Kate, my companion and we went to the Pow-Wow on the reservation.&nbsp; That was interesting, much different than the ones at UofM.&nbsp; (Lame Deer is a Cheyenne Indian Reservation)&nbsp; From there we travelled to SD to the badlands, Mt. Rushmore, the Crazy Horse Monument, a petrified forest, and my first cave.&nbsp; The following day we travelled through ND- which is, to me, pretty uninteresting.&nbsp; We were going to stay the night but after a killer game of bowling, we decided to go strait through to MT.&nbsp; Travelling across East-Northern MT is much like travelling through ND, which is much like travelling through KS.&nbsp; So...on we went.&nbsp; To Glacier National Park, where we saw a bear!&nbsp; Oh my!&nbsp; Just a little baby black bear.&nbsp; We went hiking in the rain to a huge waterfall, and another hike to a "hidden" lake.&nbsp; We spent two days camping there, which was nice since we had been sleeping in the car.&nbsp; From there we were off to ID, where we were going to spend the night, but then it was only about 126 miles from Spokane, WA, so we went there instead.&nbsp; In WA we came to a river and went swimming....or wading.&nbsp; It was amazing.&nbsp; But it was then that I got the call from my dad that my grandfather passed away.&nbsp;     &nbsp; Now, Kate and I had been talking about our amazing good luck and how the atmosphere of our trip was much like the twilight zone, and it was here that really came true.&nbsp; Within 48 hours I was sitting in MI in my mom's living room with my head spinning.&nbsp; So, yes I was in MI last weekend, but I did not call anyone.&nbsp; I was not home for good and I had no intention before this of coming home at all so I thought it best I not get settled.&nbsp; And I have to say, MI does not have mountains and majestic streams.&nbsp; It's crowded and noisy and smelly....but it is home.&nbsp; And now I look forward to coming back in November.&nbsp;    &nbsp; But for now I am enjoying my amazing life in MT.&nbsp; The mountains and the rivers and the green, green hills.&nbsp; The people and the team and the work.&nbsp; I'm working on an archeological dig this month and I'm learning a lot.    &nbsp; So, now you see how I am exhausted.&nbsp; But I'm happy.   &nbsp;

           Don't know much about history.... I am now working with the curatorial center and it is a monotonous and uninteresting task.   Sometimes I think the idea of "artifacts" is absurd.  Why keep so much stuff?? Needless to say, as much as this spike has offered, it has been lacking in the "important to the world" catagory.  At least in my opinion.      Projects came out yesturday and the corps members are busy ranking them.  There are 20 spike projects to "choose" from and it is a task I will leave entirely up to my corps members.  There is a chance I will end up in Michigan, as there are three Michigan projects - but I don't think my CM's will rank them very high.  There is one in Missoula, MT which I think they may want.  It involves a lot of camping.  Actaully, many of the projects involve the environment - that means killing things and deciding what has a right to live in a certain place at a certain time; because it's obvious that just the ability to grow does not merit the right to do so wherever one pleases.  And here you might say that I sound just a bit cynical.  And, you would be right.     The truth is that I am becomming increasingly dissolusioned with the work that I am doing.  With the exception of the Boys and Girls Club, I havn't really felt that the work itself completed here was necessarily....uh....pressing.  But hopefully we will get a good project next round (which begins September 15th).  That's all for now....
