      DRIVERS ED IS FINALLY OVER!!! YESS! i have no idea if i passed or not... o well i wont worry about it right now. i swear that is the most boring thing i have ever done. im so tired now, from getting up really early every morning for that. me and chelly agreed that our teacher looked like a giant hooker mexican sasuage. lol.  hmmm well anyways... this week was pretty uneventful other than drivers ed. i went to the mall with jenny and preston, and that was interesting. me and jenny made preston go into all the stores he didnt wanna go in like victorias secret. then we were sitting on this bench and these ghetto guys came over and talked to us. they left jenny alone (mostly) since preston was right there, but one of them tried to get me into the bathroom to show me his dick so i was like "NO IM LESBIAN!!" so he gave me his friend Strawberrys number. it was the greatest thing ever.  im going to camp kanata on sunday... IM SO EXCITED!! i get to see britney again and we get to act stupid. we had so much fun last year... peeing in the lake, eating shaving cream, our counselors running outside naked... it was so fun.  im tired of typing so im gunna go..... lataaaa

      so the weekend was a lotta fun for the most part. jenny and i went to the mountains!! its amazing how much can be crammed into 2 days...  we were supposed to leave friday around noon... but then i slept till 11:30, and my mom got a slow start too. so then we decided to leave at 2pm. we got delayed again, and didnt leave till 5. that wasnt a really good idea.... my mom isnt too great of a driver at night. me and jenny had fun in the car on the way though. stone and george werent there, so that made it a million times better than it would have been. jenny and i watched movies on the way up, and made up a really cute poem for george, which he really didnt appreciate. lol o well. my mom got lost in the mountains... it was like 11 at night and she didnt know where she was going. we finally stopped at a gas station to ask for directions. so we got there around 11:30pm.  jenny and i stayed up till like 3 just talking about stuff, then my lovely brother wake us up at like 10:30. we went to this rly cool waterfall and went swimming in it. it was pretty cold water. then we went to this pond down the street from the house. george (my moms bf) decided to go skinny dipping... IT WAS SOOOO NASTY!!!!!!!!! i always made fun of my mom for having a bf with a tiny dick, but i never knew for sure. now i unfortunately know... so does jenny. so jenny and i ended up swimming in the pond too, (with our bathing suits on) and IT WAS SOOOOOOOOO FUCKING COLD! we had a "party" at the house that night with a bunch of uptight old people who didnt want to have any fun. georges mom said that me and jenny werent considerate of other peoples feelings, and that we werent beautiful (she can go fuck herself). this girl named alicia slept in me and jennys room that night (georges niece i think...) jenny and i thought she was this goody high school girl, but then she started telling us about all her problems with sex, drugs, alcohol, etc. that was interesting to hear about.  on the car ride home, jenny and i made up two lists. one was "reasons for my mom to dump george" and we came up with 223 reasons. then my mom requested for jenny to make a list of ways for her mom and my mom to get to coach dickens... that was uhh interesting.   oh yeah, george is threating to put my cat to sleep. i wish he wud mind his own business...... o well life aint perfect.  im tired of typing, so laterzz

      well it is thursday night at 11:30. this week has been awesome, mostly cuz theres no school. i wont go into details of this week, but basically its been just sleepin till noon, working on my tan by the pool, hanging with friends, eating... thats what i call LIFE. i havent been home in like a week, so its nice to sleep in my own bed, and do whatever i want to do. it really sucks that summer is only like two months, but i cant wait for high school. my friend was tellin me about all the high school parties and stuff, and im like MAN I CANT WAIT!   all my friends r getting pools these days!! cassidy just got one, annie might be getting one, preston is getting one. im gunna have a lotsa places to swim!!!  i got these x-rays back from my dentist. i definitley have to get my wisdom teeth pulled at some point!  they r coming in like crooked at a weird angle. but its ok, annie might have to get hers out too. we can get them pulled together :).   i dont have a life, so i have nothing else to say...... later for now

      well i lost my password to my other blog thingy... and the user name... o well. anyway, school is out!!! yay! im finally done with middle school. its really weird, i was crying on the last day of school, and i thought id be sad all summer. hate to admit it, but im not. i couldnt be happier right now. im staying in touch with all my friends in some way or another, so there's really not much to miss. 8th grade was a really awesome year though. 7th grade was good too. i made some of the best friends in the whole world. so the middle school chapter in life is done- now its time for high school! st marys... mixed feelings about that... i really dont have much of a choice on that, my moms making me go there. but idk i guess ive kinda accepted it, and im ok with it now.    so the summer is going good so far. i havent really done anything, except hanging with annie and just chilling and going swimming and to the beach. that has been sooo nice. its great to know theres no test ro study for, no homework to do, and best of all, knowing i can stay up as late as i want without having to worry about waking up at 6am. im not doing anything next week either. nice feeling. oh yeah, i completely forgot... I NEVER HAVE TO SEE MRS DOVE EVER AGAIN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! i hate that bitch. (drama was still awesome though). That nazi gave me below average in conduct.   im really bored right now, so im taking up some time with this... being bored is ok right now though, cuz my mom is making sure i have a packed summer. ive got drivers ed (yay!), dads house for a week, camp kanata for a week, camp seafarer for a month, then this internship thingy at my doctors office... so much to do! i wish summer was a lot longer. i mean the school year is 9 months long, and we forget everything we learn anyway. i swear i pretty much had to go burn a forest for all the paper i needed for notes in social studies this year. notes that i never looked over, and cudnt read anyway. 3 pages of notes per day, 180 days.. talk about a waste of paper! sad to say social studies was my favorite class... lol.   k well i dont have a life, so i have nothing else to say... later for now
