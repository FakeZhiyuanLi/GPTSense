      Well, I finished the website, or most of it for ERO. I still haven't gotten word from Schism or Mitosis on my Story....  Damn it! I want that thing back! Anyways, I made this thing, which I seem to be explaning for some stupid reason, to do just this, to bounce ideas off of myself.   Yeah....well..yeah....

      Schism, or hunter, just deleted the old ERO forums, and now Schism set up the new crappy ones on a free fragism server, or was it Unbreakable.....ah hell, who knows?  I'm waiting for him to get back so I can get my damned story back.

      I forgot to mention that I saw Troy a few days ago.  Besides getting dangerously close to seeing Brad Pitt's.... I won't even start; The movie was really really good, part of it must have been because I liked the story I guess, but Paris was a little wussy. So that pissed me off.

      So yesterday I was supposed to have a match with some of my friends against another team on JKA, but a few hours before it, I started feeling sick and fell asleep, and lo and behold I missed it! Afterwards, we went to the store to pick up Xbox  live  which totally kicks all ass and I played it for about hours yesterday after having to wait for the damn credit card so the account could be approved. Oh well, all's cool now so I'm really happy.

      I've finaly been able to sum up why I like games as much as I do. It's because of what they represent, an art form, a way for people to share their immaginations work with others. This cannot be represented in any other different way, but a game, because it's the only art form that allows you to put your immagination into motion while letting someone else run it. Paintings, or animation can give you only half of that and in a different way.  Another reason would be because it allows you to slip away from reality for a while to become, do, and experience things that in real life you can't because of boundries that remain to be broken. That's why I want to become a video game desginer, to let others experiences the stories, adventures, and characters I have in my head.   Now, onto the three major players in todays industry. Every one of them is doing very well in non-competative terms, but once pitted against each other, it's a whole different story.   In the U.S.A.:  The Sony Playstation 2 dominates the market, home console wise, with over 100 million of it's systmems sold. That means that about half of the population of the U.S.A. owns a Playstation 2.  Mircosofts Xbox is in second place currently, but has been strugling along with Nintendo's Gamecube for the postion, and the two consoles battle and reclaim the spot of second place every other week.  In Japan, and other parts of Asia:   Sony is once again number one, with not as impressive sales as seen in the U.S. it still beats Nintendo and Microsoft.  Speaking of Mircosoft, it's doing horribly in Japan, with about only 50,000 unitsof the Xbox sold, while the Nintendo Gamecube has sold about 10 million.  In Europe:  Sony is slightly ahead of Nintendo and Microsoft, but not by much, and once again Microsoft gains the rank of third, while Nintendo fights it for second.  The Gameboy Advance, developed by Nintendo, has no real competition, unless you want to count the N-Gage from Nokia which sold about 500 units of it's phone/handheld gaming system. It's sold well over 70 million units, but because it had no competion it's success can't be compared to that of the Playstation 2.  After an impressive showing of new and current projects at the Electronic Entertainment Expo 2004(E3)from all three of the gaming giants, I have a few things to say about each.  Nintendo - Gamecube is doing poorly in the third party section(Third party developers of games are those who make games for every console, like Spider-Man, the game.), but of course it is still king in it's own games with new version of mario, zelda, and metroid prime, to name a few coming out for both the Gamecube, Gameboy Advance, and the newly revealed DS. If you want further information on the DS, visit www.ign.com  Playstation 2 - Ok, think gamecube, but the exact opposite, great third party support, but god awful self developed games. Sony's policy is simple: We make crap, and we sell crap, and we do it by the dozens of new games. For some reason, it works.  Xbox - Fable, Halo 2, Half-Life 2, Doom III, to name a few of both First, Second and Third Party  games coming to the system, plus with the Xbox Live internet conectivity feature to play with friends online, Xbox has a bright year ahed of itself.  I'm really eager to play some of the recently announced games, and can't wait to get my hands on others, such as Halo 2. This was a short run down and my honest opinion of the Viedo Game Industry as of July 2004. The sales figures may be slightly off, but they are fairly accurate. I hope the above at least gives you some basic information on something that's dear to my heart. Video Games.   P.S. I'll probably write more topics like this about certain games and such.

      I haven't been able to sleep in like 2 weeks now. I don't know why, but I find myself staying up until about 4 in the morning, and getting a drink or some food out of boredom.   Well, at least it gives me time to expand my music library....

      BLAH!  It's already mid-july and i've accomplished close to nothing in terms of that anime website. I did and redid the layout 3 times. I've finally got it almost done, besides a few small complications. I'm going to need to find some people to work with me on it...  I also saw King Arthur, the movie, a few days ago, and I must say it was basically like Troy, it had a few parts I didn't like, a lot of parts I did like, and a few characters from the movie were pretty cool. The actor who played Arthur is very good, while the guy who played Lancelot...is...well mediocre. Still go see the movie and be educated....about... a half-myth....well, yeah.  I need to keep working on that damned website, and I need to remember to post more stuff here. So...farewell until I get bored enough to write more.
