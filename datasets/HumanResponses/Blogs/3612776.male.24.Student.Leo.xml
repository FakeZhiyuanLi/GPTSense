      Hi Y'all:  I'm home in Albany, so of course I have a bit of time on my hands to type anything I want!  Sure, I should be downstairs in my bed with my laptop typing away...I have a paper that's due on Monday for PLE.  Ah, I'll start that tomorrow night after I get back to Rochy! :-P  Home...I came home for Father's Day and mom's birthday (it'll be on Tues.)  Found out that we were invited to a high school graduation party...so of course, being the nice family, we went--UP IN THE MOUNTAINS WHERE THE MOQUITOS ARE.  I sat there, swatting my legs and smiling at everyone--no clue what they were saying! My brother, the idiot he is, FINALLY showed up from MA at 5 pm, just when we were about to leave to meet Granny for dinner.  So behold it, we didn't leave until 5:45 pm, and knowing how Granny is...eek, we speeded to dinner.  It was lovely, at the Freehold Inn...quite nice and expensive!  Now, we're home...Andrew's back to MA, of course.    Home...it used to be "home sweet home" and I couldn't wait to get there.  Now, it's "ehh, home".  Things have changed a lot over the past 3 years...mostly becuz of the relationship I'm in...but ah, my parents have to accept that I'm HAPPY and it's the guy I'm going to marry.  My parents are not marrying him...so be it!  Whatever.  Now I dread coming home since I know mom'll say something (or should I say some thingS) negative and I just have to nod and ingore it.  Me tired..me going to bed now.  YAWN!  Good night! Ta-Ta Brooke

      Hi Y'all: Yeah, I'm lousy with this blog thingy...no time! :-P  Every day, I come up with things to say, but absolutely no time to sit down and type my thoughts and comments up, but definitely do have time to read others' blogs and LJs.   Hmm, my thought for the day--can cats have separation anxiety like children do?  I think Kezia is going through that...I came back from VA in May to an angry cat (Lucky showed her emotions--she missed me and was affectionate).  But as for Kezia..she was mad at me for a couple of days...then I had to leave AGAIN for Albany to see Andrew's college graduation (that's my brother, mind you).  I stayed with the parents for 10 days, and came back to...you guessed it, an angry cat.  Then, she became her usual affectionate self and wouldn't leave me alone.  I definitely do not mind my baby crawling all over me...I yearn for that, and I love our times together.  NOW, she's starting the separation anxiety thingy...every time I walk out of the door to go out to work, school, errands--who follows me?  My lovely cat...meowing the whole way to the outside door and looking back at me like, "Mama, I wanna go with you."  That's strange cuz she hates car rides, hmm.  I gotta show her extra attention--but woe me and woe Kezia..I'm going home this weekend for my Daddy's day and my mom's birthday.  Poor Kezia.   Other than Kez...Lucky's doing quite well, and she finally is showing me her nice side, coming up to me to be petted, sleeping next to me (literally), and just being a nice cat.  I guess she ages well. :-)  Caleria and Hoberta--bless their souls.  They are 6 years old now, and ferrets only live up til 7-9 years...I am going to miss them dearly when they leave us.  We let them out of their cage more often now, and watch them play until they fall asleep next to each other as usual.  They ARE good animals...yes, yes, I was terrified by them for a long time when Eric and I started dating, but I became attached to them, despite the feet biting fetish they have.  I come home and look at them in their cage, sleeping peacefully...and my heart just melts.  I do cherish my time with them.    Hmm, other than our pets...I was reading the comments my friends left me.  Rachel--I can't bear to stay for one extra quarter like you suggested...if I do that, I won't be able to start a teaching job til the following year, yuck!  I am going to graduate in May of 2005--pack up the apartment and our pets--move wherever I get a job--and start our lives there, and planning the wedding!  That's my general goal, and I plan to stick with it!  About those dreadful English courses and evil Mr. Bateman, I'll just figure it out as I go along.  Right now, I'm leaning toward to dropping History of Theater this Fall, and just stick with the regular MSSE 16 credits along with assistantship (that reminds me, I gotta find one), and studying for certification exams.    That's all for now...I'm sure that I'll have plenty of time on my hands when I'm in Albany this weekend--perhaps I can post more blogs for my dear readers?  Ta-ta for now, Brooke

      Hi Y'all:  Thinking about Rachel and her bridal shower today...wishing I was there, but had no carpool buddy! :(  At least she's in my thoughts! :-D  I definitely can't wait til her famous wedding next month!  My gosh, it's only a month away!!!  So exciting!  Take a peek at www.raeandmick.com and be sure to comment on how creative the website is!    A lot of things has been going on in my life...where shall I begin?  Hmm, I'll post one thing per day....instead of one BIG and LONG blog!    Summer school is such a drag!  I have been taking summer classes for the past 2-3 summers, and lemme tell ya something, it ain't no fun!  This summer, I'm enlightening myself by taking Political Legal Environment which is a MSSE requirement, and Shakespeare: History and Comedy which is an English requirement.  If you picked English as your content area, we gotta take 46 quarter hours of English classes.  So far, I've got 36 credits if you count Shakespeare.  36 credits!!!  I've got 10 more to go....and I'm dreading it.    Here's my dilemma:  This Fall is supposed and probably will be the toughest quarter we MSSEers will suffer.  We are required to take 16 credits of classes: Assessment, Foundations, Eng. Language Development, and Ed./Cultural Diversity.  Since I still have 10 credits of English to go, Mr. Evil Bateman says that Drama/Theater at NTID will count...so I'm taking History of Theater this Fall...that adds 3 credits to my load.  19 credits this Fall...isn't a very wise choice, I admit it...because we ALSO have to have a Graduate Assistantship as usual AND the smart students will be starting their Thesis, which includes me!  ALSO, I've gotta register for the LAST/ATS-W exams this fall, and gotta STUDY for them.  This Fall sounds pretty heavy, doesn't it?  SO...I wanna drop History of Theater.    BUT, that would mean...THREE English courses to take in the Spring PLUS our Thesis class (8 credits) AND Teaching Secondary Disabilities (4 credits).  Hmm...that would take me to 21 or so credits in the Spring--my LAST quarter, mind you!  So...that is my D I L E M M A !!!  I have absolutely NO CLUE what to do here.  I WANTED to take another MSSE class this summer (Independent Study)..but noooo, Evil Bateman said no, he was too "overwhelmed, because I already have 10 students and most of them aren't even supposed to take Indep. Study, but oops, I allowed them."  My ass!    So...I'm in a bind, and that's not good for my "illness".  GRRR, double GRRR!    Anyway, that's my post for the day!   Ta-Ta for now, Brooke

      Hi Y'all: Rachel has been begging me to post something in here, so here I am!  Behold Rachel! :)  I'm doing good, despite some things that has been going on around here.  Let's see, and let's back up...I arrived back to Rochester on June 20th to find our friend, Garwin, who had come and stay for a few days.  Well, a few days became a week, two weeks, three weeks, and now it's the 4th week and I'm beside myself in wits!  I wish he would find another place to crash....I'm losing my sense of privacy, my sense of MY APT., and my sense of MY CAT!  Once company comes, my cat loves their attention and tend to ingore me.  Knowing myself, I can't deal with that.  I can't even walk around buck naked..gotta have my robe on to walk to the bedroom from the shower.  It's a PITA!    School is ok.  I finally finished PLE class for the summer...think I'll get an A.  It was a fun class, but waste of my time! :)  Now, I have Shakespeare left to focus on.  My paper's due tomorrow at 6 pm, and I'm only on the 2nd page as I'm typing this post.  I can't wait for that class to get over with!  It's too complicated for my little pretty brain.  Work--ah, let's not go there.    Other than that, I'm puttering around and getting by during the days.  I can't wait til this weekend...Eric and I are going to CT this Friday for Rachel and Mick's wedding...Saturday will be our mini trip to Mystic Seaport and Aquarium (anyone going to the wedding is welcome to join us).  Sunday, we'll check out of the hotel and go up to Albany to have dinner with my parents.  Yes, my parents and Eric will actually sit down and try to be civil with one another.  I'm praying that it'll go successfully because it will be the time to announce our wedding date to my parents and get started from there.  Really, I can't think of much more to say here...and Lucky is staring at me waiting to be petted, so Lucky shall have my attention while I'm waiting for dinner to be cooked for my little tummy.  ta-ta for now, Brooke
