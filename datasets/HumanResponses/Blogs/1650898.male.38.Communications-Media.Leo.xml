       THE GRAY HOUSE...  Yesterday, I was watching CNN when Prime Minister Ariel Sharon and President Bush gave a joint press conference following their closed door meetings.  After listening to Sharon read what amounted to a heaping of praise on Bush (while losing his place in the written speech several times), I stopped what I was doing and just listened with my mouth open.  I swear if I hadn't known better, I would have thought a White House scribe wrote it.  In between all the kudos, Sharon did mention that Israel would continue to build the "security fence" (which already wraps around parts of contentious West Bank area in concrete and wire).  While the Israelis contend it is to keep out suicide bombers and protect its people, it at the same time cuts through territories and communities that the Palestinians call their own.  It is unfortunate that while there is a tenuous cease fire, the Israelis and Palestinians are caught in a never ending loop of "you must do this first, before we...".  It is also unfortunate to see President Bush--who the previous week in meetings with Prime Minister Mahmoud Abbas said the fence was "a problem"--step away from that position.  This week, it's become a "a sensitive issue" and President Bush has claimed and "unshakeable" committment toward Israeli security.  It seems that peace will never be attainable if the U.S. continues to try and walk such a fine and narrow line of shifting policies.  More importantly, where in the murk can the real seeds of peace grow?     BOY MEETS.....NO SIGNAL  I had looked forward  to watching  Bravo's "Boy Meets Boy", after the rousing success of "Queer Eye On The Straight Guy".  Unfortunately, my cable company had "technical difficulties" and I could not tune in to either airing of the show.  I'm supposed to have a technician out today to reset my receiver today.  I hope I get to see the rebroadcast on Friday.   LIKE A FINE WHINE...  As July draws to a near, I'm reminded that I'll soon be turning 38 (August 12).  For the first time since turning 30, I'm feeling a bit distressed about my age.  Usually, it doesn't bother me.  But this year, I feel my nesting instinct kicking in big time.  Maybe it's still being single at 38.   Don't get me wrong.  I'm very happy with my Life and what I've accomplished thus far.  But, it seems more than ever that I'm ready to share my life with someone on a long-term basis.  It's funny because so many times I tell friends and family that I don't feel "grown-up".  By all measures society uses to define "grown-up", I am and should be.  But, I think I feel there is a part of me that will always be a "little kid".  I don't think that's a bad thing either.  I've had two serious romantic relationships that ended badly--and probably made me enjoy being single longer than I should have.  Now, I just think I'm really missing the companionship and having someone to share life with.  At the same time, I think sometimes the gay community places such a premium on youth.  Then I wonder if I somehow missed the boat?  Or maybe it's just been delayed?  Okay, it's official.  I need a boyfriend..........

       MISCELLANEA VOL. I, NO. 1  1.  I am totally bouncing on the new jam from Danish duo  urlLink JUNIOR | SENIOR  called "Move Your Feet".  Their U.S. debut album " D-D-Don't Stop The Beat " drops on August 5 on Atlantic Records.  Already a European hit, their video clip has hit MTV2.  The duo in itself is a bunch of contradictions: one gay, one straight; one tall, one short, etc.  It's hard to put a genre label on their music--it's all over the place--and great.  I dare you to listen to it and not move.  2.  DVDs recently purchased: " The Pianist ", " The Hours ", " Beautiful Thing ", " Oxygen ", " Hairspray ", " How To Lose A Guy In 10 Days " and " The Bourne Identity ".  3.  Glad to see   urlLink Coldplay's " The Scientist " clip get some recognition from  urlLink MTV's 2003 VMAs .  Up for three moon men (Best Group Video, Breakthrough Video, and Best Direction), the re-wind clip by Director Jamie Thraves is brilliant.  4.  Cadbury "Flakes" and "Snowflakes" are chocolate lover's heroin.  Only one problem, they're only sold in the U.K. (rumor has it, a favorite of the Queen).  Thank goodness for import stores.  5.  Did anyone see  urlLink Ryan Seacrest's  piece on "The X-Games Experience" on Jay Leno Friday night?  Do we  really  have to ask after that performance?  6.  It amazes me that months after a relationship has ended, there are days that are blue.  Days that are filled with memories that seep into every minute of an hour.  Maybe the head moves on, but the heart always seems to reserve a small place for the people you have loved.  It's a beautiful agony.  Blood red torture and cool blue justification.  The canvas of what has been--but can be no more.  You shouldn't look...but you can't help it.  It's been one of "those" days.  Not really sad....maybe melancholy?  Sometimes, I really do miss you.

       QUEER EYE ON THE QUEER EYE   urlLink Bravo's  first experiment in queer-ality television was a huge success on many levels--though not without its detractors.  Owned by NBC, Bravo has boldly gone where the Big Four tread lightly.  On Tuesday, the new series  urlLink "Queer Eye for the Straight Guy"  made its impressive debut.  With a rogue band of five (can you imagine, five??) tried-and-true homosexual males, the show centers on the annointed  Fab 5  (who drive around in an SUV with similarly monikered vanity plates) searching out the poor, clueless straight male who is in dire need of help for his "lifestyle".  The five who make up the team and their areas of expertise are:  Kyan Douglas  (Grooming Guru),  Ted Allen  (Food & Wine Connoisseur),  Carson Kressley  (Fashion Savant),  Jai Rodriguez  (Culture Vulture) and  Thom Filicia  (Design Doctor).  The make-up of this team could NOT be better.  Seemingly a group of forever friends, the Fab 5 are at once likeable, humorous and oh-so-talented.  While many will argue that this show breaks no new ground (which in part is true as it is a combination of about five current TLC shows), I believe it makes a strong statement.  First, when is the last time you saw five openly gay men have their own series, albeit cable series?  Secondly, the interaction between the straight "victim" and the team shows a lot about the level of social interaction accepted today among straight and gay men.  Yes, there are many laughs, superb double-entendres, and a major queer factor--but above all else, the show is entertaining and wickedly smart and funny.  The show has definitely rewarded Bravo and NBC for their daring.  The premiere episode set about smashing several records for the cable television network.  According to Nielsen data, the show broke records for Bravo in total viewership, households, audiences aged 18-49, audience 25-54, and attracted a total of 1.64 million viewers during its Tuesday 10 p.m. EST debut.  Even more importantly for the networks, the show made the channel the 2nd most advertising-supported cable network during the hour.  Bravo's highest showing in this time period previously was 38th place.  In a statement from Bravo, they declared that the ratings for "Queer Eye On The Straight Guy" were nine times better than last season's averages among viewers 25-54 and more than seven times better than the calendar year average to date.  Aside from the impressive numbers, the show was not without criticism.  The  Washington Post's  resident Television and Style Critic, Tom Shales, questioned whether the show was too patronizing. "Forced to choose between scorn and condescension, gay people could hardly be blamed for preferring the latter--and thus might not object to the stereotypes on parade in the series, which each week dispatches five New York gay men to rescue some poor, style-starved straight person at a crossroads in his life," he said in his column ( urlLink  "Bravo's 'Queer Eye' Heads Straight for the Stereotypes"   ).  In an interesting aside, I watched the premiere with a mix of straight and gay friends.  Every single person found the show engaging, funny and groundbreaking.  Never once was the word stereotype ever used in anyone's review.  Shales' point is probably most exemplified in the personality of Carson Kressley.  The most flamboyant of the bunch, Kressley is also the most hilarious with his sharp wit and scathing sexual innuendo.  Is he a stereotypical Queen?  Perhaps he shares traits with gay males who are dismissed to that category, but to dismiss him as such would be a great injustice not only to Kressley, but the show as well.  As a gay man, I find the show refreshing, witty, funny and engaging.  It dares to go places typical gay fare (e.g.  "Will & Grace" ) are not allowed by the constraints of their networks and advertisers.  It also stays away from the "in the bedroom" sexuality of a show like  "Queer As Folk" .  It is a logical broadening of the horizons of both heterosexual and homosexual persons.  Some will make fun of it and its stars.  Other's will be exposed to an entirely new perspective.  I for one, highly recommend the show to anyone of any sexual persuasion.  Up next for Bravo, the July 29th premiere of it's gay take on the dating genre,  "Boy Meets Boy" .  On a totally unrelated and salacious note, can I just say........ urlLink Kyan Douglas .........Hubba Hubba..........

       THE AFRICAN BUSH...  While President Bush tried to sell his carefully pitched "Aid for AIDS" program (compassionate conservatism) last week in Africa,  he faced another African crisis back on the homefront.  His claim in The State Of The Union Address earlier this year that Iraq sought to purchase significant amounts of uranium from Niger, significantly obscured his Campaign 2004 trek through the jungle.  The White House scrambled with the damage assessment team.  It was frankly sad to see people who I admire like Secretary Colin Powell and National Security Advisor Condoleezza Rice try to float excuses like lead balloons.  The British, meanwhile, are roasting Prime Minister Blair.  By the end of the week, a carefully timed mea culpa from CIA Director George Tenet hit the media.  Now, every talking head and pundit is filling the airwaves pointing fingers and wondering if the war in Iraq was indeed adviseable.  Sort of late if you ask me.  There seems to be a pattern here that is oblivious to anyone inside the Beltway.  Afghanistan, Iraq, soon Liberia, the freedom wagon roles on.  Yet no one knows where Bin Laden or Hussein are.  Charles Taylor continues to toy with the U.S. and the opressed peoples of Liberia.   Soldiers continue to die in Iraq on a near daily basis.  The budget for the war that is over has doubled.  Troop deployment is now projected at four to five years.  Meanwhile, President Bush is promising financial aid to combat HIV/AIDS to the African Continent.  Now I have no problem with the idea.  I do question his motives.  Why is this crisis of conscience coming on the heels of his re-election campaign?  The HIV/AIDS crisis has been well-documented for year in Africa.  Every International humanitarian and aid group has pointed this out time and time again.  Now, Bush promises programs that the Congress is unwilling to fund at the necessary levels.  It all really too sad.  So many projects, so many wars.....all started but never finished.  I find it rather insulting that such an important issue  (HIV/AIDS prevention and education) is being bastardized into a campaign flash point.  When the Bush Administration has not taken an interest in funding programs here in the U.S. and has continued a pattern of contempt for gay, lesbian and transgendered issues (among many others), it seems rather disingenuous to believe their efforts now.  Even more ghastly is the use of the ravaged African countries and their peoples as public relations fodder.  I hope that the people of Africa do get the access to the medications, treatments, and care they have been promised.  Anyone who faces the scourge of HIV/AIDS deserves compassion and caring--something we do not give to those afflicted in our own country.  Time will tell--and hopefully prove me wrong.

       REALITY TV...  By now, any television viewer in America has realized that this Summer re-run season is chock full of so-called "Reality TV" programming.  It seems to divide people into two groups:  those who love it and those who hate it.  But the fact remains that someboy is watching it.  I think I'm a reality tv junkie.  Sure it can be trashy and outrageous.  You always have to wonder how "real" reality is.  While associate producers and casting agents abound, you really have to wonder what would possess someone to subject themselves to what usually turns out to be humiliation and embarrassment.  Finally, you put hours and invest interest in programming that never ends like you'd like it to--or even how the show is supposed to.  Pop culture is now flooded with reality TV "stars" and wannabes.  For every semi-successful story, there are many who never find their place or their fifteen minutes.  Nonetheless, I'm still addicted.  I voted for "American Idol"  urlLink Kelly Clarkson .  I've watched Big Brother I, II, & III...and  urlLink "Big Brother IV" .  I'm fascinated by CBS's  urlLink "Amazing Race 4 .  Fox's new experiment in the hook-up,  urlLink "Paradise Hotel" , takes an old formula and makes it truly wicked.  The object of the game?  You must hook-up or leave the hotel.  But the producers have brought a cast of interesting characters and mean-spirited 'surprises' that watching people squirm this much has never been so fun.  Favorite players:  The Fish-Cold Charla and Hunky Beau.  That whole 'can't turn away from a car crash' reflexiveness seems to hold true.  Then again, I know enough people who do not watch reality programming or *gasp* hate it (at least publically), to have my doubts.  I think the trick with reality television programming is too not spend more time watching stranger's lives than you spend living your own.  There's nothing quite like waking up in your own bed and remembering all the things you have to deal with today and don't want to, to give one a unique perspective on reality.

       IT BEGINS...  Welcome to this place...this space.  A cursory glance often leads us to look at things in a narrow field of vision.  We are too readily satisfied to accept anything at face value.  We live in a World of three dimensions and usually see things in two.  Obscuring our judgement is the lack of angles.  We live in a place where it is too easy to see the black and white of an object, but never the greyscale.  The greyscales that defy the logic of our labels.  We are attracted to the the polar ends of any spectrum, where the labels are easy to define--and the small print is never read.  Everything and everyone must have a safe cubby hole in our "perfect" Universe.  Sorting people and things--ideas and opinions--into well-defined cubbyholes is safe.  It's comfortable and familiar.  But, square pegs never fit in round holes.  We all have our own unique angles.  We don't fit into the same holes.  If we did, what a lackluster World we would live in.  I'm always searching and exploring my angles.  I hope you do as well.

       JERRY GARCIA & PORN   urlLink Rufus Wainwright  will release his third album, entitled "Want One", on Septemeber 23.  In Sunday's ' New York Times '  Arts & Leisure cover story ( urlLink "Rufus Wainwright Journeys to 'Gay Hell' and Back" ), Wainwright discusses his addiction to crystal meth and other substances.  A fan of both "Rufus Wainwright" and "Poses", I look forward to the new release--which will actually be released on two separate discs, "Want One" & "Want Two".  In the article, Wainright discusses his addiction to crystal meth and anonymous sex that eventually led to the caption above and a stay at Hazeldon.  He has some very interesting things to say about being gay, the nature of gay sex and his personal demons.   He conjectures that gay men are particulary susceptible to the lure of crystal meth.  He says , "Years of sexual insecurity, the low-grade discrimination you suffer, the need to belong — speed takes care of all that in one second."  He goes on to describe some of his personal experiences with the drug--and others.  While I'm sure there will be those who decry his speaking publically as nothing more than a publicity stunt for the new album--I would have to disagree.  I think the following passage more than illustrates his startling candor:   "For years, and I mean thousands of years, the gay man's mind has been treated as perverted, clandestine and dirty," he went on, "and speed reinforces and glamorizes that as an ideal. And with drugs, what's more dangerous is more sexually exciting. On that drug I had really horrible thoughts that turned me on. I had a few of those real gay lost weekends, where everything goes out the window, where you want to make pornos or you want to have sex with children. I mean, your mind is just completely ravaged."         FRESHMAN DIARIES  Showtime's ten part documentary/reality series, " urlLink Freshman Diaries " begins its run tonight.  The documentary chronicles the first year of twelve students entering the University of Texas at Austin.  The opener prominently features Neil, an avowed homosexual who questions his sexuality when he realizes he's attracted to a girlfriend.  So far reviews have been very positive regarding the series, which garnered an "A-" for "Entertainment Weekly".  TV Guide cutely writes,  "...smarter than MTV's Sorority Life and scarier than the real world."  I'm such an addict that I'm sure I'll at least check out the opener.

       VMAs 2003  First, I have to admit that I am a true blue Madonna fan.  That said, the opening number teaming Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera, Missy Elliott and Madonna was the highlight of the show.  The veils, the wedding dresses, the giant cake--it was all so over the top and oh, so much fun.  Madonna looked sleek in black (and wore the pointiest toe shoes I've ever seen).  The "Like A Virgin/Hollywood" number showed that twenty years later, Madonna still knows how to steal the show and set tongues wagging. Meanwhile,  MTV cameras were falling all over one another to get 'reaction' shots of Britney's ex, Justin Timberlake.   I imagine water coolers across America are abuzz with tales of 'the kisses'.  Every press account I've read goes out of their way to mention that the  urlLink busses   between the girls were 'open-mouthed'. I imagine that this picture of Madge and Brit will be plastered all over the place.      As for the rest of the show, a few notes and queries:  *Coldplay gave an impressive performance and deservedly won the three awards they were up for.  *Beyonce came close to giving a great perfromance.  But with all the hip gyrating and booty shaking, she appeared to be lipsynching.   *Chris Rock was generally sarcastic and rude to everyone who graced the stage.   *Who the hell thought it was a good idea to pair up Jimmy Fallon with the Queer Eye guys?   *The only presenter who didn't look or act like they were drunk and/or stoned was Kelly Clarkson.   *The Duran Duran "Lifetime Achievement" segment was a disaster. *Who knew that breasts would be the accessory du jour? *Rumors of Michael Jackson's financial woes were apparently confirmed when Jack Black shopped at his yard sale. *By the time Metallica closed doing garage band covers, the show had fizzled to the point I nearly fell asleep. *Missy Elliott deserved to win "Video Of The Year" for her visually stimulating "Work It" clip. *Do Jessica Simpson & Nick Lachey live at MTV? *Funniest Line:  Chris Rock pointing out that R. Kelly had to be seated in the balcony because the Olsen twins were in attendance. *Do Eminem and 50 Cent go to the bathroom together? *Snoop Dogg arrived with two women on leashes.  Apparently with that perm, it was the only way he could get them there. *When the puppets are more interesting than the presenters, you know you have a problem. *When do you become too old to watch MTV anymore? *Outkast arrived on a flatbed truck with a stripper pole installed.  Did they have a permit? *When did aspiring to be a pimp become so fashionable?  Did I miss the alert in 'Vogue'?  Does Anna Wintour know?   REMIX OF THE WEEK  The "djosos krost remix" of Junior Senior's "Move Your Feet" is a must have.  It takes chunks of Pet Shop Boy's "West End Girls" and fuses them with the already danceable Junior Senior track.  Very cool stuff...

       WOULDN'T EUCLID BE PROUD?  The College Board announced yesterday that the Class of 2003  urlLink scored  a 36-year high (519) on the mathematics portion of the SAT Exam.  While this is probably not noteworthy to most, it makes me very happy.  Not only does this signal that our schools are finally putting the proper emphasis on integratiing the necessary math skills in graduates, but it's affecting on a more personal level.  I graduated from college with degrees in Mathematics and Economics.    I still remember the quizzical looks I received from fellow high school classmates when we would discuss our college plans.  You what?  You actually want to take math classes of your own free will?  I guess I grew fascinated with numbers and math around the fifth grade.  From that point on, I took every math class that was available to me.  My high school was not a large one--so the math curriculum was somewhat lacking.  But, one woman--who was my teacher for four years in high school--would have a lasting impact on me.  Mrs. Trujillo sparked my curiosity and encouraged me to go beyond what was taught in class.  She made me fall in love with math all over again.  My absolute favorites would turn out to be Algebra and Geometry.  Five years of Calculus in college was challenging to say the least, but I even grew to like it.   Number theory gives me a headache.  But, math can give you interesting insights into problem solving and every day life.  It's amazing how many things around us have mathematical links or are directly influenced and driven by numbers.    Congratulations Class of 2003!   MONTGOMERY & MOSES  I've about had enough of the whole Ten Commmandments  urlLink circus   .  There hasn't been this much drama since Charlton Heston carried those styrofoam tablets in Cecil B. DeMille's opus.  Of course, most media outlets have fifteen minute updates on the 'situation' and film of the demonstrators flaying themselves upon the ground.  While, I generally am loathe to discuss religion--as it is one of those issues that seems to polarize people--I'm going to anyway.    The general uproar created by Alabama Chief Justice Roy Moore is inexcusable.  How he ever got that 2.6 ton granite rock into a government building three years ago amazes me.   The little doctrine of the separation of church and state should have rang a bell in someone's mind.  Moore has said, "It's not about a monument.  It's not about religion. It's about the acknowledgment of almighty God."   But aye, there's the rub.  Justice Moore's God is not my God--or countless others I'd imagine.  This is where there is a fundamental conflict with religion and the judicial system in this country.  Just like every other issue (school prayer, the Pledge Of Allegience, the Oath of Office, etc.), there is an undeniable link to the tenets of Judeo-Christian religion.  So in one instance, you can possibly understand where Justice Moore and his supporters are coming from.  The solution?  Well, that's quite the problem isn't it?  In over 228 years as a country, we still struggle with this issue as a nation.  I guess in the end religion for me has been an interesting journey.  I come from a family that has its roots in Roman Catholicism for as long as anyone can remember.  I would characterize the core of my family as devout Catholics.  Having been baptized, confirmed and taught catechism lessons, I attended church services until I entered high school.  At that point--with the burgeoning realization of my sexuality and the lessons I had been taught by the Church--I felt a conflict so great that I made the conscious decision to stop attending organized services.  It was not a popular move on my part, but one that I needed to start a journey of finding my spiritual center.  Sparing a lot of detail that perhaps I will revisit one day, I came to a place where I found my God and my religion.  In the end, the organized Church had little to do with that.  I still consider myself to be a Catholic (even if the Church does not).  I do believe in a God.  Yet, I truly believe that each of us has to find our own place with issues of religion, a God and our own set of beliefs.  No matter what someone's faith is--or isn't, I try to honor that.  The important thing is that in this Country you have that freedom and right.  But, you also have an equivalent right to protect others who may not believe as you do.  You cannot force a relgious doctrine on a people.  Examples around the World have shown us the consequences when religion is spoonfed or persecuted.  In the end, Judge Moore's antics seem to be more about publicity than religion.  His indignation and refusal to surrender to the decisions of the courts shows his contempt for the very justice system he insists is  built upon the Ten Commandments and acknowledgement of one 'almighty God'.   FRANKLY FRANKEN  I happened to catch Al Franken on CNN's 'Newsnight With Aaron Brown' last evening.  He contines to amuse and delight me.  His word association answer on Ann Coulter was a chuckle.   The whole dust-up with Fox's Bill O'Reilly is rather humorous.  The ridiculous lawsuit that Fox tried to pursue against Franken over his use of the phrase "fair and balanced" was not.  In the end, Franken wins and his book,  urlLink ' Lies and the Lying Liars Who Tell Them: A Fair and Balanced Look at the Right'   sits atop Amazon.com Bestseller's List.   BOY MEETS THE FIRE DEPARTMENT  James final "intimate one-on-one" dates are now over.  If they would have let those candles burn a bit longer, James wouldn't have to make a choice next week.  As it stands, I'm totally confused.  I have no idea who's straight or gay.  My damn gaydar is apparently in need of its 50,000 mile overhaul.  James seems to have the most chemistry with Wes--and yet there is a part of me that feels it is forced on Wes's part.  Brian is too nervous.  Franklin is an enigma.  My gut still says that Wes is the closeted straight boy (which at the same time seems totally improbable).  One thing I do know is that I felt for Andra when she heard the 'twist'.   QUEER EYE ON THE THE STRAIGHT GUY  Three words:  FUNNY AS HELL.   WORD OF THE DAY   urlLink aplustre

       U.K. DREAMING  I must have been feeling nostalgic this weekend.  For some reason, I pulled out M People's " Bizarre Fruit " and Skunk Anansie's " Stoosh ".  Both albums are some of my all-time favorites, but they failed to attract much attention here in the U.S.  Both groups are fronted by some incredibly powerhouse vocals.  M People's " Bizarre Fruit " was released in 1995  and showcases the vocal talents of  urlLink Heather Small .  Songs like "Sight For Sore Eyes" and "Search For The Hero" still sound great today.  As for Skunk Anansie, I own the three albums they recorded before they split up in 2001.  Their mix of political commentary, rock and beauty was very unique.  Their frontwoman,  urlLink Skin , has got a voice that can shatter glass in one instant and move you to tears in the next.  " Stoosh " (1997) is probably in my top ten favorite albums of all time.  With cuts like "Infidelity (Only You)", "Hedonism (Just Because You Feel Good)",  "We Love Your Apathy", "Yes It's Fucking Political" and "Glorious Pop Song", the album is a sonic adventure.  Something for the mind, heart and soul.  I'd highly recommend you check it out if you haven't.  The track "Brazen (Weep)" is worth the price of the album.  Both women have released solo projects--" Proud " for Heather Small and " Flesh Wounds " for Skin, but you can only get them via import.        CHICAGO  Watched '  urlLink Chicago  ' for the second time on DVD.  I think I enjoyed it more the second go round--and I already loved it.  It's great that they've included the Catherine Zeta-Jones/Queen Latifah duet "Class" on the DVD.  I think it should have been left in the movie, but I can see why they cut it in terms of pacing.  Rob Marshall is pure genius and Bill Condon could not have written a better screenplay if he tried.   LIKE THE VIRGINS  There's a lot of buzz in the gossip columns about a supposed luncheon between  urlLink Madonna, Britney Spears and J. Lo  over the weekend.  Word has it that something could be up between the three for the opening of next week's MTV  urlLink Vmas .  The guess is that they will all perfrom "Like A Virgin".  Stop laughing.  Wonder what happened to Missy?   THE BROKEN  If you are a fan of techtv's "Call For Help" or "The Screen Savers", you should check out the first episode of " urlLink thebroken ".  It's a videozine by Kevin Rose and Dan Huard on the underground culture of hacking.  It's interesting and hilarious.  Their experiment in social engineering is unique to say the least.  Make sure to watch the outtakes at the end.

       DON'T ASK, DON'T TELL  Who knew reality television was....well.....so real?    When Michael Jason Tiner appeared as a contestant on Bravo's 'Boy Meets Boy' using his middle name  urlLink Jason , he knew he had already sealed his fate.  After eight years of service in the U.S. Navy, Tiner was  urlLink discharged  from service under the existing and laughable "Don't Ask, Don't Tell" policy.  A combat systems instructor, Tiner was out to his family and friends.  The twenty-six year old was recognized in a promotional commercial for the show by a fellow service member and thus begain his discharge process.  The fact that our government is willing to have men and women put their lives on the line to voluntarily train, teach and fight--as long as they keep a part of who they are secret--is beyond disgusting.  Yet during the recent war in Iraq, it was obvious the policy was not enforced as stringently as it had been in peacetime conditions.  Yes, Ladies and Gentlemen, you can serve your Country.  You can die for your Country.  But, don't you even consider being 'one of those' homosexuals.  While Tiner knew that the consequences were inevitable and that he was personally ready to be out to everyone, the simple fact that he was discharged (albeit "honorably") is so wrong on so many levels.  No matter how many gay people or characters are on television currently, it does not even come close to making up for the gross injustice that gays and lesbians face in the military on a daily basis.  This piece from the Servicemember's Legal Defense Network (SLDN) on the  urlLink DADTDPDH  policy raises some interesting points and I would urge you to read it.   In a related matter,  urlLink Reichen Lehmkuhl , one half of the winning duo on 'The Amazing Race 4' has signed on with the SLDN to work on a documentary about the "Don't Ask, Don't Tell" policy directed by Jonathan Baker.  According to Lehmkuhl, “The Pentagon is firing three people every day simply because of their sexual orientation.  If the same thing were happening in corporate America, most citizens would be rightfully outraged. The fact that our nation’s largest employer discriminates against gay Americans under the sanction of federal law is equally appalling.”  Some days.  Aaargh!

       REICHEN & CHIP  After four continents, twenty-four cities and over 44,000 miles,  urlLink Reichen & Chip  were the victors on CBS's "The Amazing Race 4".  The married gay couple surprisingly took the lead from David & Jeff (who had lead the last two legs of the race and ultimately finished in 3rd place).  Something tells me that Reichen will NEVER let Chip drive again.  As for Jon's naked underwater romp, I say next season it should be mandatory to perform all Road Blocks in the nude.  All kidding aside, I love this show and I hope that CBS continues it.   P.T.C vs. C.S.I.   The watchdog Parent's Televison Council has voted  urlLink 'CSI'  as the least family-friendly show on television.  The group  cites episodes that contained cannibalism, S & M sex clubs and snuff films among its blacklist.  Who are these parents and where do they live?  Do they watch the evening news?  There's a lot worse happening out here in the real world.  Of course, if you look at the list of the top five shows according to the PTC, 'Touched By An Angel' was the best show this past season.  Unfortunately for them, it was also cancelled.  Further, I refuse to watch any show on the PAX channel--especially shows starring Billy Ray Cyrus.   THE FAB 5  'Queer Eye On The Straight Guy' continues to break records.  Tuesday's episode was the highest rated show thus far, with 2.9 million viewers.  The Five appear on the cover of "  urlLink " The Advocate "  " (08.19.03) and trade quips in a group interview.  One of my favorite exchanges:   The Fab 5 on straights in society:   The Advocate:  Before you’d done the show, had you ever—I mean, obviously you had met straight people, but perhaps you didn’t know they were straight. Had you ever really met any straight people?  Carson:  I’d never actually spoken to a straight person before.  Kyan:  Actually, my mother and father were straight.  Ted:  It’s a shocking discovery for a lot of us, but there is a world outside of Chelsea. Some of my best friends are straight. And there’s nothing wrong with them.  Carson:  As long as they act gay in public, I’m fine with it.  Ted:  As long as they don’t talk about it and shove it in my face, I really don’t mind.    COFFEE TABLE BOOK OF THE WEEK  I recently picked up  urlLink " Pierre Et Gilles: The Complete Works"   and I'd highly recommend it to fans of great photography.  The French duo of Pierre et Gilles has had a great impact on the photography of the human form and pop culture in general.  This book chronicles their work from the late 70's to date.  It is also a beautifully put-together book with a quilted dustjacket.  Pierre et Gilles on Nina Hagen:

       BOY MEETS....  As much as I try to justify liking  urlLink "Boy Meets Boy" , there's this underlying uneasiness in my trying to form a perspective on the show overall.  Last night's show winnowed the field to three potential mates for the handsome  urlLink James .  As the episode drew to a close, host  urlLink Dani Behr  dropped the other shoe.  She informed James that one of the three remaining mates was straight.  The show closed with this "deer in the headlights" gaze that froze over the Leading Man's face.  I believe his only words were........"great.....".  Up until that point, I thought the show was making some interesting points about the traits and characteristics that are commonly accepted to identify a gay male.  When the reveals were done at the end of each episode, for the last two shows--I must admit to being extremely surprised about a couple of the "closeted straights".  I think the show made some salient points about gay/straight interaction and how looks and opinions can be deceiving.  Even the holy grail of gaydar seemed to not function for many of my gay friends.  Most of my straight friends were simply floored by the reveals.  To that extent, I think the show had something very positive to offer.  Looking beyond the simple fact that any show that deals with homosexuality--and is not necessarily produced for a gay audience--is a good thing, the show presented a very likeable Leading Man in James and a special friendship with Andra.  Their interaction was very honest--as was both their interaction with the mates.  But as James began to become emotionally invested in the dwindling cast of mates, the show seemed to step over some kind of boundary.  Maybe the intended lesson became less focused and more demeaning?  I think the preview clip of Andra's reaction to the news next week says it all.  Yes, they were all told it was a game.  But at some point, the game went from fun and interesting to cringe-inducing and uncomfortable.  Of the three mates remaining, I think James has the most invested in the relationships with   urlLink Franklin  and  urlLink Wes .  For some time, I wondered if Franklin might not be straight.  But as the show progressed, I've changed my opinion and now believe that Wes is perhaps the red herring.  I don't think the show's creators and producers ever intended to purposely hurt anyone, but somehow the sense of uneasiness grew with each successive episode.  An interesting side note, on CNN's segment " 90 Second Pop ", one of the panelists, B.J. Sigesmund (Enteratainment Reporter for  Newsweek ), mentioned that he had spoken with James after the filming of the show and claimed that he was very upset and felt betrayed by the twist in the show.  The reporter   urlLink  said  that James told him he cried on the show.  It will be interesting to see how much of this reaction makes it off the cutting room floor.   ONE SMALL STEP FOR MAN...  As of yesterday afternoon I have murdered my 56K dial-up modem.  My cable company  finally  got with the program and began offering broadband access.  My laptop has been ready with an Ethernet card and now one Motorola SurfBoard Modem later, I'm seeing what I've been missing.  I guess after several years of dial-up access you get used to delays and slow downloads.  But, I am amazed at the difference.  This could be better than sex.  Wait.  Who am I kidding?  It's been so long since I've had sex, I wouldn't know.   THE O.C  The premiere episode of Fox's  urlLink "The O.C."  was a little shaky for me.  Granted they had a lot of exposition to get done in a short period.  By the second episode, the show has found a rhythm and the characters are more fleshed out.  It's an interesting show as it builds a multi-generational story and uses its cast to great effectiveness.  There are great performances from Tate Donovan, Peter Gallagher, and Mischa Barton.  The revelation of the show, in my opinion,  is Benjamin McKenzie, who portrays the troubled Ryan Atwood.  Now I think I understand the term "man-child".  There's something about him and his features that at times seems so adult--and yet there is this vulnerability that makes him childlike.  He's an interesting enigma.

       THE AMAZING RACE  CBS's around-the-globe reality program,  urlLink The Amazing Race 4 , has reached its last leg.  I've been a fan of this show since the first edition.  Not only are the people fascinating, but the show has a great infusion of World culture and geography.  The final three teams this year include two all-male teams ( urlLink David & Jeff ,  urlLink Reichen & Chip ) and one engaged co-ed team ( urlLink Kelly & Jon ).  Each team stumbled a bit on the way to their penultimate pitstop at Ellis Beach, Australia.  But, the competition remains fierce and very close.  Jeff and David (who had a bit of a problem with a pile of sheep's wool) retain the lead and continue to show great teamwork.  Reichen & Chip doggedly pursue the lead team, but their relationship shows some signs of wear (Chip accidentally ran over Reichen's foot with their vehicle).  Kelly & Jon are a mess.  Kelly is overbearing and constantly berates Jon.  They had numerous problems in this leg of the race--but one incident really made me laugh despite it being a potentially dangerous accident.  One of the Road Blocks was an off-road dune buggy course that had to be completed by one of the team members.  Jon's enthusiasm to do it was written all over his face.  Half way through the course, he turned sharply and the buggy rolled over.  Needless to say, Kelly was a bit distressed.  Her screams gave way to two comments that were just too telling.  Instead of worrying about Jon's safety, she comes up with these winners: "Now I won't get my fancy schmantzy wedding!" and "Jon be careful!  I need you....to win the million dollars."  While Jon was unhurt and giddy, maybe he should reconsider the engagement?   QUEER EYE GUYS  There's a great cover story in the August 8th issue of  urlLink  Entertainment Weekly   on the " Queer Eye On The Straight Guy " phenomenon.   The article entitled "They're Here! They're Queer! And They Don't Like Your End Tables!" contains a lot of behind-the-scenes information on the show and cast.  It was interesting to note that the shows are filmed over a four-day period.  There is also an accompanying article ("Super Queer") discussing the gay television boom.  On the issue of stereotypes, I found this quote by Kyan Douglas very interesting:  " If gay people decide that they can't be flamboyant and funny because straight people aren't going to like it, then what's the point?  Either way, we're not allowed to be ourselves.  I want to be gay on my own terms. "       GEEKTIQUE  Do you hate spam and run Windows OS?  Try out this great Freeware program:  urlLink SpamPal for Windows .  It's easy to install and works very effectively.  Also, if you haven't added your  urlLink Google Toolbar 2.0 .....what are you waiting for?

       THE MORNING AFTER...  Yesterday I turned 38.  All in all, it was a great day capped by a wonderful dinner with family and friends.  I still feel the same and nothing's fallen off (*knock wood*), so I guess I can cope.  One of my favorite things that I received as a gift was the new Gamecube game  urlLink Mario Golf: Toadstool Tour .  I am total sucker for Mario--which I suppose is further proof that the inner-child still thrives.  I also received an awesome  urlLink Diptyque  " Menthe Verte " (Garden Mint) candle.  Can I just say these handpoured candles are sinful.  You may not want to throw the box away as it smells as good as the candle.  If you are a candle connoisseur, Diptyque is your valhalla.  After a great dinner of chicken quesadillas,  we overindulged in cherry crepes with fresh whipped creme. Yum!   NEW JERSEY ( DEAD ) GIRL?  So let's regroup.  Mirimax's has a new strategy at trying to wash the bad taste out of the twelve moviegoer's mouths who braved the disaster flick " Gigli ".  Their strategy apparently is to promote the fact that one half of the Bennifers will die shortly after the movie begins.  ( urlLink " After 'Gigli,' Less of J. Lo Is Seen as a Good Thing " ).  Hmmm...so much for plot points.  I guess their deadly chemistry in " Gigli " was enough to start the PR machine going for a film that is not even scheduled to unspool until March 2004.  Where are Jay & Silent Bob when you need them?   THE "COCOA GODDESS"  Just finally got around to watching " urlLink " Bringing Down The House " " on DVD.  I'm am really impressed with Queen Latifah's comedic chops.   She and Steve Martin are the perfect foils for one another.  I certainly hope a sequel is in the offing.  The movie is superbly cast with standout turns by Eugene Levy, Joan Plowright and Betty White.  If you feel like laughing, check it out if you haven't.....or watch it again.  Can't wait to get my " Chicago " DVD and another Latifah fix next week.   "AMC PROJECT: GAY HOLLYWOOD"  AMC's  urlLink " The AMC Project: Gay Hollywood "  following five gay men as they pursue careers in Hollywood was an interesting attempt at viewing the challenges faced by openly gay men trying to work in onscreen and behind the scenes roles.  I'm not sure that it was totally successful--mainly due to time constraints.  It is very interesting to read the feedback of AMC's viewers on their site.  Beyond the standard "you're going to hell" remarks, it seems that some of the gay audience was divided as well.  In a point made several times by one of the film's subjects--Lance Dustin Black--it was claimed that the men chosen to be chronicled were "too gay".  I'm always puzzled by this phrase.  When does being gay cross some invisible boundary on the masculinity scale to become "too gay"?  How do you know if you are "too gay"?  I wasn't aware that there was some calcuable sliding scale of gayness.  Is 6.5 on the gay meter "too gay"?  The concept of "too gay" and "straight acting" seem to arouse strong opinions in the gay men I've discussed this issue with.  I've always wondered if there's not a bit of internalized homophobia in these descriptors.

       WHO WANTS TO BE GOVERNOR?  The California effort to recall Governor Gray Davis and the subsequent election to replace him is turning into quite the circus.  The list of candidates is getting downright strange.  When Larry Flynt, Gary Coleman, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Angelyne, Gallagher, Arianna Huffington, and Lt. Governor Cruz Bustamante all want the same job--frankly I'm scared.  Kudos to Mr. Schwarzenegger's only-in-Hollywood stunt of announcing his candidacy on the " Tonight Show ".  It's quite a feat to show your ass on the Big Screen and the Little Screen in the same calendar year.  Jay Leno better forget that  urlLink makeover  via the "Queer Eye" guys and get 50 Cent to give him the "P.I.M.P." crash course.  How funny is it that this whole recall effort started because of the failing economy and supposed mismanagement of California's state budget by Governor Davis?  Do they think this whole recall fiasco is really going to save the state money?  To vote for Arnold, please dial 1-866-IDOLS-01; To vote for Arianna, please dial 1-866-IDOLS-02; etc.   NEW JERSEY GIGLI-o?  First, the Bennifers are showing off their happy homemaker vibe on NBC's "Dateline" and trying to rustle up business for that little movie " urlLink  Gigli  ".  The story goes that the night said display airs,  Ben is on location in a  urlLink Vancouver  strip club inspecting the merchandise.  Suddenly, the  urlLink  The National Enquirer   is giving free polygraph tests; Jen's on the radio discussing Ben's tipping habits.  Oh, the horror of it all.  To think America still has " Jersey Girl " to look forward to???  You know, I liked Ben a lot more when he was gay and in love with Matt.     ONE TOO MANY...  Lately, I've been listening to a certain CD quite a bit.  I think it's quite good. *ducking for the flying fruit*  Check out  urlLink " One Too Many: Live From New York"   by joe mac & eman.   No.  Seriously.  Released on indie Bacouris Records, the live acoustic set by former NKOTB Joey McIntyre and frequent collaborator Emanuel Kiriakou is a lot of fun.  Granted, it won't be for everyone.  But if you like good old Pop music give it a spin.  Recorded at Joe's Pub (NYC), the set features their own stuff and some interesting covers (Van Morrison's "Wild Night", Cyndi Lauper's "Time After Time", U2's "One" and "With Or Without You".  Gay Boys:  check out tracks 16 (" Falling ") and  17 (" What If I Was Gay? ").

       MONDAY MUNDANE  1.  Maureen Dowd's take on Bush and the issue of homosexuality in Sunday's  New York Times  ( urlLink  "Butch, Butch Bush!"  ) is pretty funny and spot on.  2.  I love the new Madonna/Missy Elliott commercial for  urlLink Gap .  Not only is the pairing of the two Divas unexpected, but the "Into The Hollywood Groove" remix (a reworking of Madonna's "Get Into The Groove" and "Hollywood" with a Missy rap) is awesome. (p.s. There's a remix of "Hollywood" on the limited edition Gap CD)  3.  I am such a fragrance slut.  New recommendations: Dolce & Gabbana "Pour Homme", Gucci "Rush" and Montblanc "Presence".  4.  I finally broke down and bought the  urlLink Yoshitomo Nara Flip Clock  that I've been coveting.  I purchased the blue one and absolutely love it.  I came across some of Nara's prints recently and have surprisingly become a fan.   His work is a combination of Pop Art and traditional Japanese comic book art called  urlLink manga .  Most of his subjects are either children or animals.  There something about his juxtaposition of innocence with evil that is quite affecting.  He has a new exhibition coming to several U.S. cities later this Fall.  5.  Francois Ozon's  urlLink  "Swimming Pool"    is definitely a head trip.   urlLink Charlotte Rampling  gives a tour de force performance in her role as Sarah Morton.

       I'M A SINNER!  During his press conference on July 30, President Bush had the following to say when a reporter asked what his views on homosexuality were:  " I am mindful that we're all sinners.  And I caution those who may try to take the speck out of their neighbor's eye when they got a log in their own. I think it's very important for our society to respect each individual, to welcome those with good hearts, to be a welcoming country.  On the other hand, that does not mean that somebody like me needs to compromise on issues such as marriage. And that's really where the issue is headed here in Washington, and that is the definition of marriage. I believe marriage is between a man and a woman, and I believe we ought to codify that one way or the other and we have lawyers looking at the best way to do that. "  In spite of the obvious pronoun problems and the reference to Jesus' Sermon On The Mount, I was left scratching my head by his answer to reporter's query.  The first thing I wondered about is whether we are to infer from his comment that homosexuality=sin?  It would seem to be the case.  Further, while we may have good hearts and live in a welcoming country--if you are homosexual, don't even think of getting married.  So much for the respect part.  I've never really had a strong personal opinion on the issue of gay marriage--one way or the other.  I do, however, believe that if marrriage is something two people in love want to do--they should be able to regardless of their gender.  What I can't figure out is how marriage between a man and a woman is not a sin, but between two men or women it is?  Further, if two men or women marry, would it lead to the utter collapse of society as we know it?  Highly doubtful.  However, the Supreme Court's recent ruling regarding sodomy laws has apparently mortified Conservatives.  What is truly puzzling from a legal standpoint are President Bush's assertion that the definition of marriage should be codified.  In 1996, Democratic President Bill Clinton signed the "Defense of Marriage Act" into law.  Two of the major provisions of that law prohibited any federal recognition of gay marriage (at the same time disallowing benefits like those given under Social Security or to Veterans) and relieves states of any obligation to recognize gay marriages performed in other states where they might be legal.  Seems to cover all of the bases.  So why would Bush want any further codification?   Whether the word is "marriage" or "civil union" or "committment", the most egregious part of this whole issue is the failure of the Federal Government to provide certain basic rights and privileges to same sex couples that it bequeaths to opposite sex couples.  Sin or not.

       FOR THE RIDE HOME  If you haven't checked out the major label debut of singer/songwriter  urlLink Josh Kelley  yet, you owe it to yourself to give his music a listen.  With his album, 'For The Ride Home', the twenty-two year old native Georgian proves to be quite a talent.  His music often veers into territory considered rootsy--but cannot be pinned down into one genre.  Don't hold that against him--it's one of the things that makes this collection of songs so endearing.  The songwriting is honest and heartfelt.  Stylistically, it would be easy to lump Kelley into the vein of up and coming talent like John Mayer and Jason Mraz or stalwarts like Dave Matthews--but that would be selling him short.  There is such a rich deepness to his vocals and an urgency to his lyrics that sets him apart.  Among my favorite cuts: "Amazing", "Home To Me", "Angeles", "Everybody Wants You", and the simply brilliant "Faces".  ' urlLink For The Ride Home ' will definitely be one of my top five albums of 2003.   TANGLED WEBS  As if the Bush White House didn't have enough to deal with on their plates, now comes allegations of the  urlLink outing  of a CIA operative in a twisted political payback. The wife of former Ambassador to Niger, Joseph C. Wilson IV, has been publically named in at least two printed media outlets effectively ending her career as an undercover operative dealing with weapons of mass destruction.  I'm so glad that Bush's campaign promise to bring back dignity and honesty to the White House has been such a rousing success.   USELESS, BUT OH SO FUN, PRODUCT OF THE WEEK   urlLink Airzooka Air Gun    AMAZING RENEWAL  Coming off a surprise win in the reality category at the Emmys, CBS has finally  urlLink announced  that the series will indeed be back for a fifth season.  Always a critical darling, the show struggled to generate ratings in the reality overrun Summer season.  Many had predicted it would get the axe, but apparently its new found recognition granted it a repreive.  The Jerry Bruckheimer produced series is now  urlLink taking applications  for teams to compete and season five will air during Summer 2004.   HAND WASH, TUMBLE DRY (An Op-Ed)  Labels.  They are everywhere--on our clothes, on our food, on our lives.  A direction here.  A warning there.  It's all about the labels.  It is an unfortunate fact of life that labels are easy to tag on people as well.  From the externally evident: male, female, black, white, brown, yellow.  To the more obtuse labels worn on the inside: catholic, jew, buddhist, aethiest, republican, democrat, independent, heterosexual, homosexual, bisexual, middle-class, homeless, racists, communists, socialists, jocks, freaks, et. al.   I'm not naive enough to think that all of the aforementioned "labels" do not exist. Fact of life, they do. We are a society and world that finds order in the ability to sort people, label them, and fence them into various cubbyholes. Until individuals refuse to acknowledge the labels for what they are and afford treatment to one another as human beings instead of labels, we shall be doomed to the entrapment of vicious cycles....history repeating. That's where you and I in our own small way have the power to influence a microcosm of this world. By learning, acclimating ourselves and by attempting to stop reinforcing our own biases and predjudices, then perhaps we can spare one more person of a label.  Personally, one of the scariest notions to me is that as a people, a collective whole, we've become disillusioned, complacent, weary, burned-out, accepting, caving--so bitterly overdosed on the reality of status quo that we don't EXPECT anything but. This to me is a tragedy of unbearable proportion.  Yet, Life goes on. Ignorance is bliss. Hear no evil, speak no evil. Trite.  It seems just like fashion and music, retro is in. Maybe if we believe it hard enough the Seventies will come back.....or the Eighties. Peace and Love. The Me Decade....aah, the good ol' daze. Maybe then, we can forget the insurrgence of hatred seeping in. We can remember times when sex didn't kill. The times when the excuse for everything was, "shit happens". Oblivion deliver us from reality. The fact is, we can go back to an extent, think back, and romance times gone by. Bottom Line: The future is now. So what are you going to do about it?  What am I going to do? I guess therein lies our future. Or if not ours, then the next generation of boys and girls who shall hopefully have the privelege and opportunity to become men and women. Maybe even well-adjusted and socially accepted gay men and women (if that be their Life). But as I think about it, maybe before homosexuals, gays, lesbians, queers, whatever your term du jour be, can gain societal acceptance, we have to learn an even more important lesson amongst our own community. That is, how to accept one another--each of us for who and what we are. Begin from the beginning.  The beginning. It sounds like such a simple concept. When you read a book, you start at the beginning; But life is not as simple as a "how-to" manual. In practicality, factions are still arguing over the fact of when life even begins. So how does a community of men and women who are so diverse among themselves and so unaccepted socially begin? Where does it begin? Of course there is the historical perspective that teaches of Stonewall and the "gay liberation movement". While these events are historically significant, and I in no way mean disrespect to the men and women that have come before me in these courageous endeavors, the truth of the matter is whatever progress has been made has at the same time had some critically negative 'costs' to gay men and women. Yes, perhaps we are now able to be more open, have some 'rights', and live lives that men and women one hundred years ago only dreamed of.  But is this progress or merely a state of affairs deserved from the very beginning?. If one looks at the what being gay entails as we approach the year 2004, we still find the need for closets, discrimination, rancor, and a general sense of not belonging in a conformist society.  Perhaps more critically, the gay community itself has become splintered as groups and factions try to come to grips with all of the situations unique to their lives. We all claim "pride"-- and yet each group bashes the other for pursuing their own set of objectives. Even something as base as "safe sex" has become a hotbed political issue which gay men and women argue over--not a life and death issue. No one is any longer content to be fighting for a gay cause, and moreover, what is a gay "cause"? Today one must be a militant dyke, or a flaming queen, or a transvestite, or a bisexual, or an ACT UP member, or a White Party boy toy, or a Sex Panic! disciple, or a Log Cabin Republican lawyer, or a right-handed, blue-eyed, bear biker from the Midwest with militia ties.  I think you get my point. We have lost the point. In what may be the cruelest of ironies, we have become a lot like those closed-minded, homophobic haters against whom we gathered to overcome. Brother and sister are now enemy.  Now that may sound extreme, and perhaps it is somewhat overstated. But if you think about it for a minute, it's not that far-fetched of a concept. I think at the heart of it all lies the fact that living in today's world is a struggle for anyone.....for any mere human. Everyone has their metaphoric and symbolic crosses to bear. No matter what is at the root of any person's sexuality, it is but a single part of the whole that makes the person. So maybe a straight man does not understand what makes a woman lesbian--or why he finds the idea so arousing. Maybe a gay man does not understand how a close friend can label himself as bisexual. Maybe a heterosexual female does not grasp the concept or the sexuality of a drag queen. Maybe neither the homosexual or heterosexual male or female understand the internal struggles of a transgendered individual. They are all in their own special ways riddles...enigmas. And the easiest thing to do when we do not understand something is to malign it, ridicule it, spite it. But ask yourself--Who wears those shoes?  There in lies the double-edged sword we find ourselves precariously balanced on. All the times that as a collective whole men and women have fought for--that simple ability to  be  gay and lesbian people without having to live up to another group's imposed standards--have become one bitter and vicious circle...the proverbial snake eating its own tail. But why? The author Camille Paglia has advanced the notion that the lesbian and gay community will not be able to advance until will learn how to stop thinking in the broadest terms of "gay" or "straight"--and perhaps her thought is right on target. But maybe, the scope of her thesis can be enlarged even further. Maybe gay men and lesbian women--not too mention their heterosexual counterparts--need to stop worrying so much about the delineation between what is gay and straight, male and female, man or woman.  Of course, this delineation has existed even in the heterosexual world from time immemorial. Women have struggled to gain the right to vote, the right to serve in the military, the right to control their own reproductive systems, the right to demand equal pay for equal work, and yet any progress attained has not come without its price. Words such as "progressive", "feminist", "radical", "militant" and the like have become perjoratives used to battle women who want to stray from the male-dominated, male-defined world she lives in. Peeling back the layers further, one quickly realizes that gays and lesbians face many of the same struggles. A woman cannot or should not serve in the military, so the story goes....because she's too emotional, not capable of fighting or killing, not strong enough. Yet a gay man or a lesbian should not serve because of their overriding libidos and the fact that they will be in close quarters with the objects of their desire--we just can't control ourselves. Not to mention our mere presence would destroy troop morale. Foolish. right? Yet, sadly people believe and proliferate these arguments. Pride, dedication, service to one's country, and the protection of freedom suddenly become fractured by nothing more than one's genitalia and sexual identity--and this but only one of many issues that are splintered on such fallacious reasoning.  Just as we follow the care instructions on the labels of our favorite clothing, labels do indeed serve a specific purpose.  They can tell us things, teach us things, give us guidance.  But the label can never become the object that it is attached to.  We can sort them into as many piles as we wish, but that will never change what--or who--they are.

       THE LITTLE THINGS  This morning I awoke early ready to start a day filled with all those projects one puts off until the weekend.  I fixed myself a big cup of tea and put on Josh Kelley's "For The Ride Home" and sat in the overstuffed chair in front of the large picture window looking out on the unfolding day.  Holding the cup up to my face, smelling the crispness of the tea and feeling the heat graze my face.  It is in these quiet, contemplative moments that you are gently reminded of the little things.  Watching the leaves fluttering in a gentle breeze.  Watching my cat, Pokey, arch his back and they flop back down on the throw rug.  Hearing the nest of birds that live under the eaves of my roof chirp for breakfast.  Quiet.  Simplicity. The color of the sky grows more vivid as the sun starts its rise over the mountain.  I stretch.  One of those stretches that sends waves down your body and curls the ends of your toes.  I reach over and light a tubereuse candle.  Inhale deeply.  Exhale slowly.  Hearing my heartbeat mysteriously echoed in my head in the quiet morning.  Suddenly the projects don't seem that pressing.  Maybe they can wait.  Jason Mraz starts singing in the background.  The tea tastes better than usual.  The bright streamers of sunlight are hitting the porch through the open door.  The smells of the coming Autumn start wafting in as the morning heat begins to percolate.  I pull my robe a little closer fighting off the slight edge of chill on the morning breeze.  I catch myself smiling.  Here in this solitude, all of the problems and irritations of the week finally start to surrender.  There are so many things and feelings I want.  There are so many things to do and places to be.  There are problems and projects to be tackled.  But for just a couple of hours everything is nearly perfect--and satiating.  It's the little things that help fill up the soul tank when it starts running dangerously low.  Today, I am full.

       DEJA VU?  Oh, the irony of it all.  While Dubya chews down his "freedom fries", the French have perhaps had the last laugh.  Radical Frechman Thierry Meyssan has come up with his own   urlLink card deck  displaying the 52 most dangerous U.S. officials.  Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld was named the Ace Of Spades, Osama bin Laden labeled the Joker, and President Bush is the King Of Diamonds.  Bush's card carries a portrait with the following description: " Head of a baseball club and director of Salem bin Laden's oil company (brother of Osama). Designated President of the United States by friends of his father at the Supreme Court before the vote count showed that he lost the elections. "  Ouch!      TABLOID COUPLES  I've seen some true and untrue odd-pairings in gossip columns before.  I thought Nicole Kidman and Lenny Kravitz was a bit strange.  But, Fred Durst and Halle Berry?  Tongues are wagging after the two shared a  urlLink kiss  for a Limp Bizkit video.  Now, tabloids and gossip columnists abound with tails of Durst, Berry, & Benet.  Hmmm....who knows?  Apparently, Madonna will  urlLink appear  in the first clip from Britney Spears's new disc.  Guy Ritchie better watch out.     ER STAT  It was wonderful to see the beautiful and talented  urlLink Parminder Nagra  ("Bend It Like Beckham") make her debut on NBC's "ER".  She possesses this ethereal quality about her that is so enchanting.  Her scenes in the season premiere had such a quiet soulfulness to them.  She is utterly bewitching.    OO1 REBEL  While perusing Corky's most excellent  urlLink weblog , I linked over to Tom Of Finland's website to view the 'unveiling' of their new anatomically correct 'action figure'.  When I read the description, I wasn't sure if 13" referred to the Rebel's height or his penis.  I am so getting one of  urlLink those .

       DEBATABLE  I watched the California gubernatorial debate sponsored by the California Broadcasters Association on  urlLink CNN  last night.  (For a moment, we'll forget what that says about my social calendar.)  I'm honestly starting to think that Arnold Schwarzenegger thinks he is in some kind of movie--his own personal "Truman Show" gone horribly wrong.  How can anyone take him seriously when he refers to himself as the 'terminator'? When the moderator Stan Statham said, "Ladies and gentlemen, this is not Comedy Central. I swear.", I thought it was the line of the entire debate.  Mr. Statham was exasperated more than once trying to keep the debate on point and on time.  Honestly, if I lived in California and was a Republican, I would be waiting at the door of Senator Tom McClintock's campaign headquarters this morning to do anything possible to help his campaign.  He is obviously the most well-versed and sensible candidate.  If I was a  Democrat (which I am), I'd honestly vote for Arianna Huffington.  Trust me, I never thought I would say that.   BIG SISTER JUN  After all that drama, the "Big Brother 4" season drew to an icy cool conclusion last night.  Evil bitches, sluts, buzzard crotch, immigrants and all regathered in the house to make  urlLink Jun Song  the big winner by a vote of 6-1.  The fact that idiotic Nathan still voted for Alison after she used and dumped him (not to mention questioning his sexuality in the diary room) is mindnumbing.  Even more numbing was the reception that Alison and Jun received from their evicted houseguests.  After Jun was announced the winner, everyone just sat in complete silence. (Julie Chen query: "What just happened in there?")  CBS did its best job of editing the houseguest's comments to make it look like they were leaning in favor of Alison.  But, Alison's sneaky (read: bitchy) ways ultimately betrayed her.  All those kisses, two-timing alliances and bedhopping never did pay off.  I have to admit, I didn't want Alison to win.  I found Jun to be entertaining and despite her self-proclaimed status as an "evil bitch"--I liked her.  Maybe it came down to the lesser of two evils.  In the end, evil bitches do make for entertaining Summer viewing.    FAB FIVE ALA FRIENDS  Taking a page from the playbook of the "Friends"cast, it appears that the Fab Five are now negotiating with NBC for larger salaries.  Much has been written of late regarding the original $3,000 per episode salary contract the Five signed.  The breakout hit has now given the boys a deserved leveraging tool.  According to a piece in  urlLink The Philadelphia Inquirer , the cast is negotiating en masse for pay increases via their representation.  The show has also been given a pick-up for more episodes and a larger budget.  The interview with Ted Allen is interesting.  I really admire his candor:   " They got us cheap.  I don't resent it. I went into this with my eyes wide open. I was grateful for the chance. I was a nobody who didn't have leverage to demand a lot of money. "   BOOK OF THE WEEK  Jonathan Lethem's  urlLink "The Fortress of Solitude" .  Amazing!   DIANA  I finally gave in and purchased the deluxe edition of the newly remastered Diana Ross album, " urlLink diana ".  With a list price of $29.98, it pays to shop around.  But honestly, it's worth it.  The first disc presents the eight tracks from the original release of "Diana".  The real surprise is a repeat of the album's tracks with the original Nile Rodgers and Bernard Edwards production.  Using much of what became trademark Chic layered productions, the album takes on an entirely different feel with the original production tweaking and mixes.  The second disc is filled with remixes and 12" recordings that have all been digitally remastered.  There's some great stuff in this package and it sounds amazing.   WORD OF THE DAY     urlLink fusuma    "NEVER COME DOWN"  the memory of skin the fingerprint of touch the voice of limbs the whisper of intimacy the comfort of breath the hunger of flesh the evaporation of world the combustion of desire the stripping of souls the savagery of wantoness the satiation of men the nakedness of love

       INTOLERANT BIGOTS?  Let's start with one of those 'feel good' kind of stories.  Republican National Committee Chairman, Ed Gillespie, made it clear that the Republican Party plans to take on the issue of gay marriage as part of the party's platform for the upcoming election cycle.  Making some fairly inflammatory remarks on Tuesday in an interview with  urlLink  The Washington Times   reporter Ralph Z. Hallow, Gillespie accused gay activists of being intolerant and bigoted.  Gillespie made the following statement:   "I think when people say, 'Well, no, that's not enough that you accept me for who I am, you have to agree with — and condone — my choice,' that to me is religious bigotry, and I believe that's intolerant. I think they are the ones who are crossing a line here."    Hmmm?  I suppose one should aspire to be fine upstanding heterosexual folk such as Mr. Gillespie? Not.    XTINA 'DIRRTY'?  In a September 22nd blind item in Billy Masters's  urlLink "Filth!"  gossip column, he pointedly suggests that Christina Aguilera indulges in sapphic tendencies.  While, I didn't find the revelation all that shocking, it was amusing to see it so obviously couched.  But, forget the blind item!  The truth of the matter comes straight from the horse's mouth (so to speak).  In a  urlLink Gay.com UK  article (dated the same date), they quote Ms. Aguilera from an interview with a German newspaper,  NetZeitung , as saying the following    "I love experimenting with my sexuality. I want to try out as much as possible. It would be wrong of me to hide this side of my personality...I find it hornier looking at women than men."   It's rather refreshing to see someone who is a 'pop icon' be so open and honest.    ARMPIT HAIR?  While paging through my  Entertainment Weekly , I happened upon an article about the upcoming season of "The Bachelor" reality television program.  The show will feature rejected suitor from last season,  urlLink Bob Guiney , who is wildly popular with women and Oprah .  What was interesting was a picture of him in a swimming pool with his arms raised.  Even  EW  made a comment in the caption about the suspicious lack of hair in his armpits.  Now, not to dwell on armpits or anything, but I happened to read an article in the September 29 issue of  New York Magazine  regarding the  urlLink proclivity  of straight men (in particular athletes) to consider going hairless in vogue.  Now, I know that the issue of shaving is well known and oft discussed amongst gay men.  Many gay men I know seem to have an obsession of shaving some part (or parts) of their bodies--if not going the full monty. (p.s.  it does not look bigger!)  This fascination with 'smooth' boys is a matter of taste I suppose.  Personally, I like my men on the hirsute side.  Now, I don't necessarily mean hairy to the point of being an extra on 'Planet Of The Apes'.  But give me some hairy pectorals and a treasure trail and I'm a happy man.  (Back hair is another subject all together.)    It may be a case of wanting what you haven't got, as genetics has made me relatively lacking in that department--hair, that is.  Nonetheless, I was perhaps under the mistaken impression that hair was "in" again.  Now, those silly straight men are mucking up the waters.  Not to belabor the point, but I must say that I find a hairless armpit rather alarming.  Now I could go on about the subject--but to do so would probably end up with me sharing too much information, embarrassing myself and others and invading space where few tread publically.  Let's just say, there is a lot to be said for a hairy armpit.   RANDOM THOUGHTS...  * As much as I like Bill Hemmer, I have a crush on Anderson Cooper.  * I watch entirely too much CNN. * The Emmy Awards were tragically boring.   * I was glad to see Debra Messing, Edie Falco and "The Amazing Race" rewarded.   * The multi-no-host-comedians thing had a few laugh out loud moments, but mostly fell flat. * Am I the only one who does not 'get' "The West Wing" or "Everybody Loves Raymond"? * Why do Martin Sheen and Ray Romano irritate me so much?  * Those new Ritz Chips are yummy. * Melissa Etheridge 2, Liza Minelli 1/2, me 0. * Saw a tape of Esteban Cortezar's NYC Fashion Week show.  Mark my words, this 18 year-old is going to be a star. * The new Miss America 2004, Ericka Dunlap, is hot.  By the way, she's the first African-American Miss Florida delegate in pageant history. * Is purple the 'new' black? * R.E.M.'s new video clip is a sensory overload masterpiece. * Contrast & compare:  Howard Dean vs. Wesley Clark? * Why does the word 'bastard' seem to be invading my vocabulary of late?   ADDICTION OF THE WEEK  I cannot stop playing  urlLink Wario Ware, Inc.:Mega Micrograme$  on my Game Boy Advance SP.  I highly recommend this wacky game that requires extreme hand/eye coordination, short attention spans and the pursuit of fun. It's a bunch of mini-games involving puzzles, sports, tricked out cartoon characters and five-second timed events.  It's even more fun, when I should be working.

       SECTION 28 EIGHTY-SIXED  The controversial so-called 'Section 28' law in the U.K. will be  urlLink repealed  on November 18th of this year.  This strange little piece of legislation essentially  banned councils and schools in England and Wales from 'intentionally promoting homosexuality'.  Law since the late 1980's, it was never used to prosecute anyone.  However, it deeply divided human rights campaigners and British gay advocacy groups.  Several attempts were made to repeal the legislation, but had failed until now.   CHURCH OF ENGLAND PONDERS HOMOSEXUALITY  In the wake of the controversial election of Gene Robinson as Bishop of New Hampshire, the Church of England (which has the largest Anglican church membership in the world at approximately 26 million) has begun the  urlLink process  of coming to a decision on how the church will address the issue of sexuality.  Already having had the largest gathering of evangelical Anglicans in over fifteen years, the church is heading toward a showdown that will take place on October 15-16 at a meeting of the worldwide Anglican church leaders.  Many Anglicans are of the belief that the practice of homosexuality is sinful and was so ordained by God in the Bible.   SOUNDBYTE OF THE WEEK  Senator Ted Kennedy regarding the Bush policy in Iraq (appearing on CNN's "Judy Woodruff's Inside Politics"): "This is a failed, flawed, bankrupt policy.

In an effort to out search Google, Microsoft has   urlLink announced  that it will begin investing money and technology into developing it own web search engine.  Of course, plans are to eventually build said engine into the Windows OS. (A side note: Microsoft is already developing the replacement for XP, which is codenamed "Longhorn".)  I think they should first worry about fixing all of the gaping security holes in the code of most of their products first.  Is it any wonder I'm seriously considering a Mac?   BOOTY NO MORE  This just in from the National Desk, Ms. Beyonce Knowles would like you to please just get over her ass.  Seems she's tired of the whole  urlLink bootyliciousness  of it all.  Hmmm.  Maybe if she stop shaking her rumpoid in every video and performance until her thighbone is nearly dislocated, no one would talk about her booty....er, um, ass.

       ABOVE THE FRUITED PLAINS...  (The Totally Ridiculous Homosexual History Of The United States Of America)  1492: From the very beginning gay men are quite active in searching for new worlds. In fact, when Columbus returns from his first voyage, several gay men protest, "Oh, he didn't discover America! We were there last weekend. It's not that great."  1621: The Pilgrims land first on the site of what is now Provincetown, Massachusetts. They see a few topless lesbians on Herring Cove and get right back on the boat.  1650: Puritanical Cotton Mather tries to supress homosexuality. Meanwhile, his gay cousin 100% Cotton Mather invents the stocks (for recreational purposes). The following year straight people decide to use it as a form of punishment.  1692: The Salem witch trials put a real damper on Halloween parties. Gays are targeted. In a shocking development, a drag queen is thrown into prison for dressing up as Elizabeth Montgomery and uttering those famous lines, "Mother, you take that spell off Darren right this instant." Her accuser is her nosy next-door neighbor, Hester Kravitz.  1765: The British institute the infamous Stamp Act, in which gay and lesbian bar patrons must now pay a cover at bars and taverns and have their hands stamped.  1776: Betsy Ross sews the first American flag. Ms. Ross is helped by her two backup sewers, Florence Ballard and Mary Wilson, who are later pushed aside when Betsy claws her way to the top.  1814: Francis Scott Key writes our national anthem, which is first sung publicly by that perenially troubled singer, Connie Francis Scott Key.  1825: The Marily Monroe Doctorine states that foreign powers should keep their female impersonators out of the Western Hemisphere.  1862: Civil War! In one of the bloodiest battles of the war, General Stonewall Jackson leads his troops of cross-dressing rebels in handbag to handbag combat.  1871: Gay men move West looking for real estate bargains.  1876: Alexander Graham Bell invents the telephone. His first words to Mr. Watson are, "What are you wearing?"

       'DEAD RINGERS'  Last night, I had all intentions of watching ' urlLink The Good Girl ' on DVD.  However, I ended up pulling out  urlLink David Cronenberg's  masterpiece 'Dead Ringers' instead.  It's probably been three years or so since I last watched the film. The movie is still as terrifying, twisted, and psychologically unnerving as ever.  It truly is a marvel on so many different layers.  From the production values to Cronenberg's mind games with the audience, it was like watching it for the first time.  Jeremy Irons (long a favorite) gives a tour de force performance in the dual role of twin brothers/gynecologists Beverly & Elliot Mantle.  The 1988 film was made long before the technological advances of computer aided imagery.  Filmed using the old-fashioned split screen technique, the movie's editing and continuity is flawless.  Watching Irons play the brothers who share so much--and yet are so different--is transforming.  Cronenberg's morality parable shows us that the twins--who liken themselves to Siamese twins--are separate entities inextricably entwined.  Moreover, the film suggests that this duality exists in all of us.  The good and evil.  The masculine and feminine.  The sane and insane.  Through the drugs, sex and slide into madness, the film carefully walks the line of becoming maudlin and instead is glaringly truthful.  The fact that they are gynecologists is central to the impetus of the movie.  When love, jealousy and loathing take over with the inclusion of Genevieve Bujold's character in the brother's lives, the film is so uncomfortable and fascinating. (Beverly's scene in the operating room with his tools for 'mutants' is sheer genius.) You want to stop watching and looking, but it is impossible to do so.   Anyone with an interest in psychology and sexuality will find fodder for days in this film.  If you have not seen it, you must.  If you have, do yourself a favor and watch it again.  You may also want to check out a book called " urlLink Twins: Dead Ringers " by Bari Woods and Jack Geasland.  It elaborates a bit more on the psychology of Elliot and Beverly.   BENNIFER BLAH-BLAH  Speaking of becoming psychologically unhinged...    When  urlLink CNN  is quoting "well-placed sources" giving his 'n' hers reasons for the "Break-Up", you know it's time to barf.  You can't look at a newstand, flip past a channel, or watch 'Entertainment Tonight' (which has now set up a bureau on both coasts to report the Ben/Jen buzz), with out hearing this story ad nauseum.    I'm just nauseated.  Enough already.  As I've said before, I liked Ben a lot more when he was gay.   GAVIN DeGRAW  Check out  urlLink Gavin DeGraw's  new album "Chariot".  The 26 year-old delivers one of those breakout debut albums that deserves attention.  Singer/songwriter/musician, DeGraw''s talents are impressive.  The writing on " urlLink Chariot " is some of the best of the year thus far.   LATEST ACQUISITION  Picked up this great piece by artist Rick Esping.  It's hand sculpted from naturally tanned leather on a limestone base.  Now I just have to find the perfect place to display it.

       CARNIVALE  HBO has done it again.  They've taken a off-beat setting with off-beat characters (a la 'Six Feet Under') and created something very interesting.  The planned twelve episodes of ' urlLink Carnivale ' began with a mind warping premiere episode last night.  Creating an astonishing mood and feel from the get go with its fade in/fade out tarot card titles, the period piece is exquisitely crafted and brilliantly filmed.  Recreating the Depression era in startling detail (not to mention buckets of dust), the series has a cast of characters never before seen in episodic television.  It's spooky, magical, mystical, religious, odd, engaging, and terrifying all at once.  Yet, it's left many questions asked and unanswered.  But one can sense a showdown of the forces of good and evil looming in many places and characters.   urlLink Clancy Brown ,   urlLink Tim Dekay  and  urlLink Nick Stahl  are immediate standouts.  I am completely mesmerized by the lovely and talented  urlLink Clea Duvall .  It is evident that there is much more than meets the eye to these characters and story.  It's a pastiche of elements from wonderfully wicked classics like 'Twin Peaks', 'Blue Velvet'--and yet, with a good heap of originality and provocativeness.  As the credits began to roll, I was dumbfounded.  Completely engaged in the world of the carnival, 'freaks' and religion and left wanting to know what comes next.  If you missed the premiere, I'd highly recommend you catch the rebroadcast and check out this startling program.   DON'T TELL ROBIN  So, the long in casting Batman movie has finally found its lead actor in the from of  urlLink Christian Bale .  Beating out a host of other suitors including Jake Gyllenhall, Billy Crudup, Joshua Jackson, Eion Bailey and Cillian Murphy--all who screentested for the part--Bale will become the seventh Batman in the franchise's history.  An intriguing choice, as Bale will bring a dark and brooding edge to the character.  After floundering for quite some time, writer/director of the brilliant 'Memento', Christopher Nolan, is said to have made the final casting call.  With all the creativity and talent involved, one can only hope the result is better than Batman's last outing.   CONAN COOL  Conan O'Brien celebrated his tenth anniversary with a ninety minute primetime special on Sunday.  Such a consistantly funny and brilliant comedic mind, the clipfest highlighted many of the reasons why Mr. O'Brien truly rules the late night talk game.  From Jack Black's Meatloaf-esque musical tribute to Andy Richter's arrival as Thor, the special was filled with some of the show's greatest gags and tons of laughs.  Where else would you see John Tesh, Abe Vigoda, and William Shatner on a bicycle for three?  Or a demonstration of the chin dildo? A masturbating bear?  Or Triumph humping the wrong end of a Pomeranian?  Here's hoping Conan has many more hilarious years...   GEEKTIQUE 01.02  For those of you who may have something to hide from the RIAA, this piece of freeware should come in handy.  From MethLabs,  urlLink Peer Guardian v1.99b  is basically a firewall of sorts.   Each time you launch PeerGuardian, it downloads the latest list of known RIAA informants and blocks them from connecting to your computer. The list contains hundreds of known IP-address ranges the RIAA has used to catch file swappers and is continually updated and managed.  I know 'several unnamed sources' who give it two thumbs up.   I'M AN ADDICT  I have to admit something.  I'm addicted to lip balm.  Of course, in my defense, I do live in a hot, dry climate that plays hell on all of your skin--not just the lips.  But, if truth in reporting is still a virtue, I am also obsessed with my lips.  Apparently, I never surrendered my Freudian oral fixation. Hmmm.  I now realize that I own more lip products than any one man or woman has the right to.  It's such a dirty little secret and I have a drawer full of product research to prove it.  I guess wanting to have soft, kissable lips isn't that bad (rationalization).  After the eyes, the place my line of vision goes when scoping someone out is the lips.  But, I digress.  I've tried them all: organic, scented, flavored, high-end, low-end and everywhere in between.  For any of you closeted lip lickers out there, I'd highly recommend:  urlLink Kiehl's Lip Balm #1 , Philosophy's  urlLink kiss me  , Burt's Bees  urlLink Beeswax Lip Balm  and if you're secure in your manhood, Joey New York  urlLink Delipcious in Margarita .  Further refrences available upon request.  Kisses, as well.   WORD OF THE DAY   urlLink catafalque    "YOU NEVER LOOKED UP"  you never looked up when you gazed the mirror never saw behind you no tears when the well runs dry never forced to face the music the notes sour and quickly fade  you never looked up wouldn't let the truth set you free the shell of a man in a hell of a world you wore your crime like the red badge of courage  you never looked up anchored to expectations don't ask, don't tell you good little prodigal son what if you lied guilty of the sign  you never looked up to realize the beauty in your shadows I see free your trojan horse unfetter the blinders and look up...

       MONTANA MADNESS  The conservative  urlLink Montana Family Coalition  is setting their sights on any companies who advertise during Bravo's 'Queer Eye On The Straight Guy'.  While such boycott and letter writing campaigns have been used by many conservative groups, this group is especially venomous.  Executive Director, Julie Millam is  urlLink quoted  as saying,  "To me, that's not a reality show about gay people.  A really good reality show for gay people would be five gay men dying of AIDS."  With compassion like that, I'm sure their campaign will get far.   TAB TELLS  In a recent press release announcing his forthcoming memoirs, actor  urlLink Tab Hunter  says acknowledges his homosexuality.  I was actually surprised because I didn't realize this was a secret. The golden boy of Hollywood's halcyon days first graced the screen in 1952 (at age 19) starring opposite leading lady Linda Darnell in 'Island Of Desire'.  He went on to make two movies with Divine ('Lust In The Dust' and 'Polyester') and the infamous 'Grease 2'.  His romantic relationship with Anthony Perkins was well known in industry circles.  Kind of strange how all these Hollywood heartthrobs are coming out of the closet.  First, Richard Chamberlain and now Hunter.  Who's next?   WHILE HE WAS IN  Fans of TLC's ' urlLink While You Were Out ' will know that there's a new hunky host--Evan Farmer.  Farmer is also pursuing a music career and has done film and television work.  His  urlLink website  features some pretty va-va-voom photos.

       'NO GOING BACK'  (WARNING: Here he goes on another political rant...) On Sunday night, President Bush addressed the Nation under increasing political pressure from his own party.  The crux of his address was to casually drop the fact that he will be requesting $87 BILLION in additional funding from Congress for the contnuing war in Afghanistan and Iraq.  His speechwriters used this cute circular argument based on the theme of "no going back" to couch his argument.  However, just a little thought shows how this is yet another bold face lie.  President Bush now says,  "I recognize that not all of our friends agreed with our decision to enforce the Security Council resolutions and remove Saddam Hussein from power.  Yet we cannot let past differences interfere with present duties."  Further, ""Europe, Japan and states in the Middle East will benefit from the success of freedom in these two countries, and they should contribute to that success."    Can we say backtrack?  In the beginning the U.S. decided it did not need U.N. sanction to enter into the war in Iraq.  However, now that more soldiers have died post-war than during the war itself, all the countries of the U.N. should have a moral and financial obligation to help rebuild and establish peace in ravished Iraq?  This premise is simply laughable.  How he can even say that with a straight face just makes my blood boil.    Why did President Bush and his Administration not level with the citizens of the U.S. and World from the get go?  Why were there never firm estimates on the costs (monetary and human) to conduct this so-called "war on terrorism" (which if anyone in the White House would notice is failing miserably) until now? Where is the $87 billion coming from when people in our own country cannot find jobs?   Do you know how many soldiers have been injured to date (since the Department of Defense is tightlipped on these figures)?  President Bush now announces his war has three major objectives:  "Our strategy in Iraq has three objectives -- destroying terrorists -- enlisting the support of other nations for a free Iraq -- and helping Iraqis assume responsibility for their own defense and their own future."  First, I believe the objectives should have been obvious at the outset of any war.  Secondly, why at this point--when major conflict has been declared over--have none of these objectives even begun to be met?  Terrorists continue to bomb and kill.  Other nations that the U.S. belittled (France anyone?) are now being asked to support a free Iraq.  Perhaps most egregiously, the Iraqis have no more responsibility over their manifest destiny than they did under Hussein.    WRAP HIM UP  At last, a man who will heed your every request:  urlLink Clinger    MORE HOURS  I re-watched Stephen Daldry's  urlLink 'The Hours'  again last night on DVD.  The DVD has a mind boggling four hours plus of extras and  are all suprisingly "must see".  I must say that I appreciated Nicole Kidman's understated work even more the second time.  I think the first time, most people get thrown by the nose and miss the delicate nuances.  The second time, I have to admit that by mid-picture I had totally forgotten that it was Nicole Kidman I was watching--which I think is the ultimate praise for an actress in this type of role.  Meryl Streep was as always brilliant.  I think, in retrospect, Julianne Moore's role is somewhat dimished by the similar and far superior performance she gave in 'Far From Heaven'.   Have loved Michael Cunningham's book, I have to say that the film works on so many levels.  But perhaps,  the best of these is the fact that the movie never answers all of the questions in the viewer's mind and allows you to draw your own message.

       BERTOLUCCI's NC-17 DREAM?  Bernardo Bertolucci's latest film , 'The Dreamers',  urlLink unspooled  at the Venice Film Festival on Monday to generally critical praise.  However, the film faces a uncertain future when it comes to a U.S. release due to a ratings controversy.  'The Dreamers' tells the story of an American student (Michael Pitt) abroad in 1968 and how his life intersects with Parisian twins,  Theo (Louis Garrel) and Isabel (Eva Green).  The distributor, Fox Searchlight, has balked at releasing Bertolucci's film with a NC-17 rating that it is assured to receive and have demanded the auteur make cuts.  The main controversy centers on several explicit sex scenes (including one in which Pitt's character is compelled to have sex with Theo's virginal sister while he watches) and shots of full-frontal male nudity.  It seems almost obscene that a filmmaker of Bertolucci's stature (helmer of 1986's nine-time Academy Award winning 'The Last Emperor') is being threatened by what amounts to censorship.  Why the rating of NC-17 even exists when no major motion picture studio will release or promote a film that receives said rating is a mystery.  The fact that Motion Picture Association of America's ratings board still plays to the religious right in eschewing films that contain strong sexual content is a crime.  As for why male frontal nudity is still considered taboo and chainsawing a person in half is not, well.....don't get me started.  Sex and nudity being considered profane in the world we live in at this moment is simply unfathomable when you consider what one is exposed to watching the evening news or reading a newspaper.   For his part, Bertolucci says that the film will likely be "amputated" and "mutilated" for its American release.   He further adds, "Some people obviously think the American public is immature." As for the film's star (Pitt) reaction to the question of whether he thought American audiences would be offended by the film's sex and nudity, said: "I fear they will not have the opportunity to be offended - which I'm ashamed of. I think what they [the studio] are afraid of is that the youth will accept the film, given the opportunity."    'The Dreamers' : Michael Pitt, Bernardo Bertolucci, Eva Green, & Louis Garrel in Venice    KISS ON HER LIST  In a surreal turn, CNN "Crossfire" co-anchor Tucker Carlson  urlLink interviewed  Britney Spears regaring the infamous MTV 'open-mouthed' kiss.  The fact that Carlson even asked the questions is laughable.  Unfortunately, Ms. Spears's answers do little to acquit the charge that she is a blonde of questionable mental acuity.  Among the gems in the interview are the fact that Madonna was her first female kiss (uh....yeah) and she wouldn't ever consider doing it again....oh wait, unless maybe it was Madonna.   The best response comes when Ms. Spears is asked about how she thinks her once squeaky-clean image has changed.  Spears replied, "I think I'm still clean living. I mean I don't go home and have orgies or anything like that."  The World will rest easier tonight.   BOY MEATS...  So to summarize:  Franklin is straight.  Wes is gay.  Brian is gay.  James picked Wes.  Franklin is sorry.  Brian wants Dan.  Dan thinks he straight.  James and Andra think Darren is straight.  Andra disappeared.  I still have no idea if I even liked the show.    WORD OF THE DAY   urlLink boswellize    'SCRUTINY'  He unnerves me That 'me' looking to see Glare of introspection Sense of imperfection The man in the mirror Those seeking eyes Staring back at reflection Scanning for truth Peering for rejection No chance of deflection No voice for objection Irises of brown Furrows of frown Judgement by perception Critical from inception

       COME IN PLEASE...  Now that the Labor Day holiday has wrapped up and 'normal' people have returned from trips, barbeques, debauchery, etc., I will sheepishly admit that I spent my holiday weekend around the house doing those odds and ends projects that had been buliding up on my TO DO list.  While tackling my office space, I found some notes that I'd taken about three years ago for a magazine piece I was writing.  Upon re-reading them and revisiting the issue, I thought some of it was pretty interesting and enlightening.  Maybe I found that to be the case because it was about me and very personal.  Nonetheless, I thought I'd post a couple of items from it in hopes that someone else would find it interesting as well. * * * *    Time has taught me that my judgement of how he handled his particular situation was unjust and hypocritical. For you see, we each travel along this path of self-discovery called "coming out" at different paces, on different feet. I'm just now beginning to realize (note: I'm now 35), that "coming out" is much more complex than just a process--or a single decision. Perhaps, it is best described as an evolution. Even more curious, I now wonder if it is a finite "thing". That is: Does "coming out" ever really end?   * * * *   As I've grown and matured--settling relatively secure in my own skin--I've realized that inner-acceptance is truly the key. Know thy Self. Accept thy Self. For the acceptance of others--friends, family, society--comes in varying degrees, with different comfort levels, and all too often at sacrificial prices. For example, I told my mother that I was gay. She knows that I'm gay and accepts it and me. She still loves me just as much as ever. Yet, her knowing and accepting, comes with some degrees of sacrifice. I realize that there are certain issues and areas of my life as a gay man that I either choose not to share and discuss with her--or that I realize she would not be comfortable discussing or confronting. But either way, this realization makes me very sad. It is the realization--that once you come out--there is still this subversive censorship of yourself that goes on.  * * * *  I will return to the issue of subversive censorship a bit later in our tale. However, this seems like a natural place for me to discuss another discovery I've made along the path of my "coming out". In the years since I was 29 and first "came out" and through my recent 35th birthday, I was finally able to verbalize an idea that had been long in the brewing to someone who was facing similar challenges and struggles in dealing with the implications of his sexuality. Now perhaps, someone somewhere has already reached this same realization--and though I've read voluminous amounts of research, data, and material on the issue of "coming out" and its implications--I think I've reached a strangely obtuse, seemingly simpleminded conclusion. The phrase "coming out" is somewhat of a misnomer.  Yes, in a sense gay men and women do come "out" of their "closets" when they choose to share their identities and sexual orientations with those around them. But it ocurred to me in the midst of a very intense, very emotional rant--that in reality we each are undergoing a process where we are in its purest essence "coming in". "Coming In". Let me explain further.  While we leap, crawl, get shoved, pushed out, or get dragged screaming and shouting from our closets, we are each stepping into the person we are meant to be. We are each looking for the proverbial emperor's new clothes. We want to find that new skin our body, our hearts, our minds demand that we occupy. The ultimate goal is to be comfortable in being who we are and integrating that person and persona into our everyday world. For each of us, once we get that skin and determine our unique individual comfort level with it, we then began the process of going into the circles that create our world. The circles that comprise our private lives, our family lives, our career lives, and finally, the entire world around us. Think of us as planets on elliptical orbits. We leave the center, our closet, and travel forth unto the brave new world. And with our new skin, our brilliant armor, we venture forth to slay dragons and claim our domain. Most of us will eventually make the first circle--our private domain which includes the people we love, the people we have sex with (which may or may not be included in the first category), and our closest personal friends. And even in this part of "coming in", we will each have unique comfort levels with each group orbiting our newfound gay self. The journey outward to the second circle is a trip that may be made by less travelers. All the while conscious of the fact that while we are moving OUT of our closet, we are moving INTO our lives. The next orbit involves our parents, our step-parents, our siblings, and our extended familial relations. And once again, the comfort level with each of these relationships will fluctuate on a wave--up and down, no steady amplitude, alternating frequencies. The next orbit involves our careers/professions and the need for or the willingness to divulge our personal selves to peers, co-workers, and compatriots. Finally, beyond that lies the boundless space of many orbits, the world around us. Each of us make choices and effect decisions that will make some us more politically inclined than others. Some of us will have a burning need or desire to proclaim our sexuality to all--to demand that it be recognized. Others of us, will be happy to have made it so far in the new skin--a comfortable fit--and feel no need to make any statement of politics (sexual or otherwise) or take any stance of activism. We are at last comfortable being who we are. We have come into our own existence. We have synthesized the many parts and facets of our lives that have now been filtered through the cognizance in and embracing of our sexual orientation.  Now bear with me for a few minutes here. I know that my solar system metaphor and tales of "new skins" require a creative leap of faith to the fact that I have not lost my mind or gone spastic on you. I've just tried to grasp some kind of model to compare and contrast an intangible ideal ("coming out/in") with another model most of us would be familiar with and have a grasp of ("the solar system/planet orbits). Yeah, it's a bit hokey. But I think if you'll re-read it and give it a chance, you'll see there are some valid points amongst the extravagant imagery. I think it is most important to remember that whether a gay man or woman looks from a perspective of "coming out" or "coming in" (or even perhaps a hybrid of both), in the end we all strive for the same thing--inner peace. Balance. Acceptance. Internal acclimation to our surroundings. Courage--the overwhelming desire to be who we are.

WHEN HE SAYS:   I think we should see other people.   WHAT HE MEANS:   I'm already seing other people, so if you tramp around too, I won't feel like such a slut.

       ARIZONA v. GOVERNOR  In an interesting turn of events, the Arizona Supreme Court has  urlLink refused  to hear a July challenge to Governor Janet Napolitano's executive order barring job discrimination based on sexual orientation in some state agencies.  The executive order was being challenged on the grounds that Napolitano overstepped her authority by setting employment policy and is legislating through executive order.  However, Napolitano's order was very careful in that it instituted a policy that prohibited agencies from hiring, firing, promoting or disciplining state employees based on the individual's sexual orientation  only  in those agencies in the Executive branch of government under her direct control.  The Supreme Court in its refusal to hear the case gave no specific reason for its stance, but the move is seen as a clear victory for GLBT and human rights activists.   DON'T SHOOT--OR WE'LL HAVE TO WORK  The U.S. House Of Representatives was pushed into a 40 minute recess after a  urlLink suspected  .38 revolver was detected in an x-ray machine after two staffers were allowed to pass through a security checkpoint by a distracted security officer at the House Cannon Office Building.   The image was noticed only after the two carrying a backpack of halloween costumes and props had already left the entrance.  This triggered a lock down and room-to-room searches until the error was discovered. It turns out the revolver was a toy gun.   THE CURSE OF MADDEN  This is pretty strange.  Seems that the lucky   urlLink coverboys  of EA Sports popular football video game title "Madden 2000" through "Madden 2004"  have all found their promising careers derailed after appearing on the cover of this game title.  The latest victim is 2004 coverboy Michael Vick, quarterback for the Atlanta Falcons.  Prior to the cover, Vick had 24 touchdowns, almost 3,000 yards passing and more than 700 yards rushing.  After the cover appearance, Vick broke his leg in pre-season and has yet to play.

       THE MORE THINGS CHANGE, THE MORE THEY STAY THE SAME  Julius Carter is a freshman at the University of Iowa.  He is attending the university on a full tuition scholarship named after Matthew Shephard, who was a gay college student murdered in a senseless hate-crime in 1988.  Carter has been touched by hate more than once in his life.  His high school graduation ceremonies were interrrupted by followers of the Rev. Fred Phelps who were protesting homosexuality.  Now, Carter's college experience is being marred by the same kind of bigotry.  Carter and his roommate  urlLink found  more than fifty homophobic epithets scribbled on their dorm room door on Tuesday.  The campus police are investigating the incident as a a hate-crime.   ADOPTION & QUEER PARENTS  A new study by the  urlLink Evan B. Donaldson Adoption Institute  finds that nearly 60 percent of the nation's adoption agencies now accept applications from gays and lesbians on a regular basis.  The report notes, however, that resistance is still found in agencies with church-affiliated agencies.  The Donaldson Institute  urlLink surveyed   307 adoption agencies -- 277 private and 30 public -- regarding their policies.  In addition to showing increased rates of application acceptance, the surveyes showed that approximately 40 percent of the agencies have placed children with gay and lesbian parents.   JUST IN CASE YOU WERE WORRIED  Britney Spears  urlLink says  she is not a lesbian.   QUOTE OF THE WEEK  " I can't fathom George Bush's America. I mean, you just don't know. "---Jane Campion, director of "In The Cut"   MISSION ACCOMPLISHED  In yesterdays improptu Rose Garden press conference, President Bush once again put his foot in his mouth.  Pressed about his photo-op appearance on a U.S. aircraft carrier sporting the backdrop banner "Mission Accomplished" and announcing the end of active campaign hostilities, Bush said, " I know it was attributed somehow to some ingenious advance man from my staff -- they weren't that ingenious, by the way. ".  But later in the day, while the White House continued to claim the sign had been an idea from the U.S. Navy, they were  urlLink forced  to admit they did indeed produce the sign.  Big surprise.     A CODE OF MANY COLORS  I was thinking about crayons.  Remember when you were a little kid, you always wanted a bigger box of crayons.  If you had 64, you coveted the 128 count box.  One green was just not enough.  Forest green, seaweed green, lime--the more the better.  I think sometimes a child's view is such an unclouded, beautiful thing.  They only see the possibility of things.  I wonder where on the road to adulthood we lose this lust for more color?  Do we become so jaded that our rainbows lose their colors?  Suddenly, we no longer want or expect more. The shades and gradations of color blur into just a few  acceptable  colors.  Sure, I'm using crayons as a methaphor.  You color in your own blank.

       QUEER ON COLLEGES  The October 2003 issue of  Instinct  takes a look at  urlLink colleges and universities  that rank as the most gay-friendly in several categories.  To wit, a few of their choices:  * BEST QUEER STUDIES PROGRAM:  Duke University * CRUSIEST CAMPUS:  Kenyon College * MOST FABULOUS SCHOOL: University of California at Los Angeles * MOST BI BOYS:  University of Washington * BEST FAG HAGS: Parsons School Of Design, NYC * GAYEST SCHOOL IN THE MIDWEST:  Grinnell College * BEST SHOPPING & NIGHTLIFE: New York University * BEST TANS/HOTTEST JOCK PARTY BOYS: Arizona State University   DICK & DAVID  On Monday, U.S. Representative and Democratic presidential candidate Richard Gephardt  urlLink announced  that David Mixner would be appointed co-chair of his campaign.  Mixner is a well-known public policy scholar and political activist who was also a senior campaign adviser for Bill Clinton in 1992.  Mixner famously protested outside the White House when President Clinton backpedaled on a promise to allows gays and lesbians to serve openly in the armed forces.  Mixner also penned an passionate and candid memoir,  urlLink "Stranger Among Friends"  that is quite a terrific read.    For Gephardt, whose daughter came out as a lesbian publically earlier in the year, the appointment is seen as a shrewd move to try and court the disenfranchised GLBT voting block that is one of the targeted sectors for a Democratic return to the White House.   U.K. POP IDOLS & BOOBIES  As the second competition of the U.K. phenomenon "Pop Idol" (which spawned "American Idol" and a version in nearly every other country in the World) nears it conclusion, it seems to be stirring up another gay controversy.  Idol's premiere season champion, Will Young, became tabloid fodder when he publically declared his homosexuality after the competition's conclusion.  This year's competition takes on a lesbian spin, as one of the axed competitors, Kirsty Crawford  urlLink claims  that she fancied a fellow female competator and the two shared a bed.  She created a furor by being quoted in press reports as saying that the two "have a kiss boobies kind of thing....We don’t actually do anything, we just bounce boobs."  A kiss boobies kind of thing??  I'm gobsmacked!  Those crazy British folk.   SPEAKING OF WILL YOUNG...  On Sunday evening, Will Young was presented the Best Album Award at the National Music Awards.  His debut release  urlLink "From Now On"  was never saw the light of day in the U.S., despite his appearances on "American Idol".  I purchased the import and was very impressed with Mr. Young's song selection and his silky voice.  He's preparing to release the first single from his follow-up album, "Friday's Child".  The single "Leave Right Now" will be released in the U.K. on November 24th, with the full album expected at year's end.  I highly recommend "From Now On" if you haven't given it a go.

       DEATH THREATS  A while back when addressing the issue of the consecration of Reverend Gene Robinson to Archbishop of New Hampshire in the Episcopal Church, I made mention that his personal safety should be a concern.  Well, it now looks like that is a forgone conclusion.  On Monday came  urlLink word  that the Reverend is now under 24-hour FBI protection.  He has also confirmed that he has received "several" death threats from  Christian fundamentalists and radicals.  He has also received volumes of hate mail, calling him among other things a "fornicating lecherous pig".  I figured that it would only be a matter of time before some religious zealot would claim that their god told them to kill Robinson because his homosexuality would corrupt their church.  So much for love thy neighbor, understanding and acceptance.  It's really saddening to see that Reverend Robinson will always have to look over his shoulder while serving his church just because he is a gay man.   CALIFORNIA WILDFIRES  Watching the pictures of flames on the ground and smoke plumes from space of the raging  urlLink wildfires  menacing California is at once fascinating and horrifying.  I've spoken to a couple of friends who are now having to get ready to evacuate their homes.  Hopefully, the expected shift in the Santa Ana Winds will allow firefighters to make more progress.

       SUNDAY MORNING, ONE HOUR EARLIER  This morning I awoke to a stinging chill in the air.  For the first time, it feels like Fall has officially arrived.  I grabbed a heavier blanket to cover my cold feet.  The crispness of air is amazing as it filters through your lungs.  The warmth in your body and the invading cold seem to slam into one another sending your nerves into sensory overload.  It's a good morning.  I'm glad that Summer is finally--and hopefully--winding down.  It's been a fairly hot year overall in New Mexico.  Every year, there seems to be less and less of a demarcation between the seasons.  It's as if Summer had kidnapped her rivals, Spring and Winter, and locked them away in the deep recesses of memory.  This new feeling has given me a burst of energy.  The new smell for some reason forbodes change.  Today seems like the start of a new day.

       THE SCIENCE OF BEING GAY  There's an interesting piece in today's  New York Times  Editorials/Op-Ed section.  Entitled  urlLink "Gay at Birth?" , columnist Nicholas D. Kristof examines some of empirical data from various studies trying to ascertain a genetic level link to homosexuality.  While it refers to the infamous "blinking" study published in  Behavioral Neuroscience , there are some interesting studies cited in the piece.  Among the statistics I found intriguing:  --An identical twin of a gay person is about twice as likely to be gay as a fraternal twin would be. --Gays are 39 percent more likely to be left-handed than straight people. --A male is more likely to be gay if he has older brothers.  For each older brother a male is about 33 percent more likely to be gay. --Lesbians have finger-length ratios that are more like those of men than of women.   WHEN LIGHTNING STRIKES  With all the uproar that Mel Gibson's "The Passion Of Christ" has generated, I couldn't help but laugh at reading that Jim Caviezel, who plays Jesus, was  urlLink struck  by lightning during filming.  Now, I'm not laughing that Mr. Caviezel was hit, but about the inherent irony.  Apparently uninjured, a producer on the set said he could see smoke coming out the actor's ear.  Perhaps, Mr. Caviezel should consider rethinking his career--or at the very least calling his agent.   FURTHER TALES OF THE APOCALYPSE  Yesterday while surfing channels, I happened upon MTV's "Wade Robson Project".  (You didn't really think there'd be a video did you?)  It was apparently a rebroadcast of the finale of this dance competition whatever.  There aglitter in silver mesh and gyrating was J.C. Chasez singing "All Day I Dream About Sex" a/k/a "A.D.I.D.A.S".  There's no turning back...

       THE SUN'LL COME OUT TOMORROW  Scientists at the Space Environment Center in Boulder, Colorado  urlLink detected  a coronal mass ejection (CME) from the sun on Wednesday at 3 a.m. EDT.  The electromagnetic radiation that is released by this solar flare can interfere with satellites, pagers, cellphones, electrical grids and other systems.  The ejection is predicted to reach Earth at around 3 p.m. EDT today.  The effects of a CME can be 12 to 18 hours in duration.  It may turn out to be a freaky Friday afterall.   VIRTUAL KEYBOARD  The San Jose, California firm of Canesta has debuted a new technology called "Perception Chipset" at the DEMOmobile trade show which creates the world's first projection keyboard capable of being fully integrated by OEMs into smart phones, cell phones, PDAs, and other mobile or wireless devices.  Using a laser, an image of a full-sized keyboard can be projected onto a convenient flat surface between the device and the user, such as a tabletop or the side of a briefcase. The user can then type on this image and the user's finger movements are converted into ordinary serial keystroke data.  There's a nifty little clip of a device in action on Canesta's  urlLink website .  If this techology proves to be effective, watch for virtual keyboard mania.    DEATH ROW SCHOLARSHIP  Who can forget the bizarre "Windshield Murder Trial", in which Chante Mallard was convicted of killing Gregory Biggs by impaling him in her car windshield and leaving him there to die.  To make a strange story stranger, the son of victim was  urlLink awarded  a $10,000 scholarship raised by Texas death row inmates.  Who writes this stuff?   YOU NEVER LOOKED UP  you never looked up when you gazed the mirror never saw behind you no tears when the well runs dry never forced to face the music the notes sour and quickly fade  you never looked up wouldn't let the truth set you free the shell of a man in a hell of a world you wore your crime like a red badge of courage  you never looked up anchored in expectations don't ask, don't tell you good little prodigal son what if you lied guilty of the sign  you never looked up to realize the beauty in your shadows I see free your trojan horse unfetter the blinders and look up...

       TRACKING YOU  Strike another one up for the Department of Homeland Security--and look over your shoulder.  The U.S. government  urlLink announced  on Wednesday that it plans to charge foreign students a $100 fee to pay for a "tracking system" created to prevent possible terrorists from using student visas to enter the country.  Of course government officials are attempting to put the best spin possible on the fee saying that it should generate more than $30 million annually for the Student and Exchange Visa Information Service.  I imagine that is a nice way of saying, "look you foreigners, we don't trust you and we're watching".  For a country that once was proud of its immigrant tradition and the fact that America was a melting pot of cultures and people, it now seems that the so-called "war on terror" and the delicious "Patriot Act" now fear the immigrant.  I find this fee and the idea of it insulting.  If you look beyond the fact that college tuitions are skyrocketing and this adds more burden for foreign students, this program amounts to hunting animals in the wild and tagging their ears with electronic tracking devices to trace their migration.  First it will be foreign students--then all students--as conventional wisdom is they are a subversive group that won't swallow the "national agenda" hook, line and sinker.  We need to watch those kids.  Don't think people.  It's bad for you.  It causes cancer--like the one in Washington D.C.     WHEN YOU REASSIGN, SIZE DOES MATTER  Apparently, there are 121 species of animal on Earth that can spontaneously change their gender.  Granted, most of them are worms, fish, shrimp and mollusks.  A study published in the journal  Nature  by a British researcher  urlLink claims  that all of these creatures share a commonality--the sex change occurs when the animal has reached 72% of its maximum body size. (Insert joke here.) Approximately one-half of the sea creatures will change from male to female and the other half female to male.  After the change, the animal will still be able to reproduce as the different sex.  Mother Nature definitely has a sense of humor.      ANDERSON 360  First, the disclaimer:  I love Anderson Cooper.  He's witty, funny, handsome and ever-so charming.  But, enough about him.  I wanted to shamelessly plug his new CNN program  urlLink "Anderson Cooper 360"  which airs weekdays at 7-8 pm EST.  Finally, the suits at CNN have given Mr. Cooper the format he richly deserves.  It's a fascinating show covering current events, news, and people, but with a huge dose of personality, a sly wink and nod.  With great regular segments like "Reset", "UpLink", "The Nth Degree",  "Buzz", and "Overload", the show makes for a swift-moving, provocative look at the news of the day.  Along with the hard news, you get Mr. Cooper's two-cents on issues and people.  The candor is refreshing and very welcome from the de riguer news magazine format.  For your enjoyment, Mr. Cooper's take on the brainy Jessica Simpson:   Later this evening, a TV classic goes off the air. The Simpsons. No, I'm not talking about Homer. I'm talking about the other Simpson, the seemingly simpler Simpson. That's right, Jessica. The reality show "Newlyweds" on MTV has become something of a cultural phenomenon. Cameras capture the comings and shortcomings of one-time teen singing sensation Jessica Simpson and her husband, one-time teen singing sensation Nick something or other. The show is devoid of drama, pathos or anything resembling a plot. Why do millions watch it? Because the couple are pretty, ridiculously rich and comprehensively clueless.   Watching the famous flounder is oddly fascinating. Jessica Simpson was clueless about why tuna is called chicken of the sea, unaware that buffaloes do not have wings and surprised that rigor mortis is not a person. The Simpsons is documentary as it is mockumentary. Why, then has Jessica Simpson already signed up for a second season? Because she knows in today's pop culture, it doesn't matter why you're famous, just that you are. Today, in fact, it was reported chicken of the sea may actually pay Simpson to become a spokesperson. And she is going to go to Harvard to give a speech. Viewers may be laughing at Jessica Simpson, but if she understands irony, she know doubt is laughing all the way to bank. That wraps up our program tonight."     QUICK TAKES  01.  It was great to see Donna Summer looking radiant on "Good Morning America".  Expect to see a lot of her as she promotes her new autobiography, " urlLink "Ordinary Girl: The Journey" . 02.  Clay Aiken was given a double platinum citation by Clive Davis on the same program  for two million units shipped.  His album will   urlLink debut   atop the new BillBoard 200 Thursday with 613,000 units sold.  After repeated listenings, I have to agree with Billboard's  urlLink review  calling it the best pop album of 2003.  Among my favorite cuts: "I Survived You", "No More Sad Song", "The Way" and "Shine".  03.   urlLink Frangelico  and cream is pretty nifty. 04.  I am so sick of all the ads and pop-ups for AOL's v9.0.  I hate that little yellow icon.  05.  Why am I suddenly attracted to  urlLink Tyler Florence ? 06.  I'm loving Dido's  urlLink "Life for Rent" .  There's nothing better than listening to it at the end of a tiring day.

       GEST, YOU JEST?  Add another page to the sordid saga of the myth that is the Liza Minnelli/David Gest marriage.  Mr. Gest is now  urlLink suing  his estranged wife for $10 million dollars.  The reason:  Ms. Minnelli allegedly flew into drunken rages, insulted her husband and was physically abusive.  No, I am not making that up.  Mr. Gest now claims that as a result of those attacks, he suffers from neurological damage and frequent headaches--apparently $10 million dollars worth of pain.  Poor Mr. Gest is now in a "rehabilitation hospital" in Hawaii.  I guess Fire Island was booked?  Who knew Liza with a "ZZZZZZZ" meant zeroes?  Oh, the agony of it all!   ROE v. WADE  In what can only be a stepping stone to the ultimate goal of overturning a woman's right to control her own reproductive system, the U.S. Senate  urlLink passed  legislation banning the so-called "partial birth abortion".  Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist called partial birth abortion "barbaric and offensive to our moral sensibilities".  What is offensive to me--beyond the overriding zeal the Bush Administration has to repeal Roe v. Wade--is the fact that a woman's health and life can now be put at jeopardy to save the life of an unborn child.  It takes away a fundamental decision of a woman (and man) to choose medical care options.  Just as the government should stay out of a person's bedroom, they should likewise stay out of a woman's hospital room.   BLOW FINGERS RICE  In one of those less-savory  New York Post  "Page Six" offerings, National Security Advisor Condoleezza Rice's sexual  urlLink orientation  is gist for the rumor mill.  I really could care less if she's straight or a lesbian--and it really shouldn't matter who the hell she chooses to sleep with.  I'm pretty sure she doesn't consult her bed partners for security advice.  What I find really irritating about this bit is the sweeping generalization to peg Rice as a lesbian simply because "[she] is single and comes across as a little frosty".  What?  So if a woman is single and "frosty", she must be a lesbian?  Only in a straight man's world.   SENSELESS  You can recall the fire of breath as it travels down your neck.  The brush of lips with a slight moistness.  The heat that stings your fingers as you touch warmed flesh.  The ache of desire quickens the heartbeat.  Muscles move and react to foreign touches.  The enveloping silence being broken by slight gasps of air escaping through pursed lips.  The flourish of fingerprints leaving tell-tale whispers of conquest.  Kisses leaving secrets never to be told aloud.  The intensity of concentration making you want.  Leaving you defenseless on a battlefield of lust.  The merging of skin and the thrill of hypersensation.  The exquisite trainwreck of needs and wants.  The look into eyes that mirror your hunger.  Sounds you no longer control.  Fingertips searing into sweated flesh.  The anticipation of the penultimate moment when bodies become one in this dance.  When colors fly.  When bodies float.  When an aching thirst is vanquished.  When sensory overload catapults you across waves.  Drowning.

       THE FAB 5 & PEPSI?  Reports in the New York  Daily News ,  Ad Age  and other  urlLink publications  are reporting that the Fab 5 from "Queer Eye For The Straight Guy" are in negotiations with PepsiCo. on a multi-level deal that would include print and media advertising, as well as product placements on the show.  What I find mildly amusing (if the reports prove to be true) is that Pepsi is infamous for hiring controversial spokespeople and then shelving campaigns.  Who could forget Michael Jackson en flambe?  Or the lavish Madonna "Like A Prayer" commercial that never saw the light of day?  Or Ludacris being hired and fired?  It's kind of interesting that Pepsi is willing to 'go gay'.  Somebody better tell Bill O'Reilly.   IT'S IN YOUR GENES  The findings of an interesting study conducted by researchers at UCLA was   urlLink published  in the journal  Molecular Brain Research .  The gist of the study(involving mice) challenges the conventional wisdom that hormones (testosterone and estrogen) are the determining factor of forming sexual identity in the brain.  The study discovered 54 genes that appear to be causal factors for differences in the functionality and anatomy of the male and female brain.  Their study concludes that sexuality--that is what makes a person feel male or female--is hardwired at a genetic level.  This study may provide insight to are the gender assignments made by physicians in births where sexual organs are ambiguous.  It also may be useful in studying the issue of trangendered individuals.   SKIN  After sitting through weeks of endless promos for the much-hyped Fox televsion series " urlLink Skin ", I watched the debut last night.  Jerry Bruckheimer's television credits continue to grow--and this series obviously has some of his flourishes (those flying keys).  Stylishly photographed, fast-paced, and yet another take on the Romeo & Juliet story--the premiere episode served it's purpose well.  It introduced interesting characters, loads of plot fodder and was overall entertaining.  Long a fan of the work of both Ron Silver and Kevin Anderson, their respective characters will give both actors the opportunity to chew scenery left and right.  The chemistry between newcomers D.J. Catrona and Olivia Wilde (who are both extremely attractive) is definitely there.  The show also sports a great supporting cast in D.W. Moffett, Rachel Ticotin and Gabriel Casseus.  I think I may watch.    RANDOM THOUGHTS  01.  The 'next' Joe Millionaire,  urlLink David Smith  , is a real cutie.  It's obvious his Mama taught his some manners.  As for the Euro Girls, what a bunch of drunk, trashy women. 02.  Masturbation is healthy and all.......but, damn, do I need a man. 03.  Item #2 was probably uncalled for and TMI. 04.  I'm really enjoying  urlLink Tribe.net  thus far.  Never did Friendster, but it appears a lot of users have migrated. 05.  I still haven't decided on Clark vs. Dean.  Though, I'm leaning toward Clark. 06.  Super Mario rules.

       WOMEN + VIOLENCE = EMPOWERMENT?  In Sunday's  New York Times , John Leland writes an interesting piece entitled, " urlLink Everything a Man Can Do, Decapitation Included " looking at a building phenomenon of strong, kick-ass women hitting the big and little screens.  He builds his case on the success of movies like "Kill Bill, Volume I" and "Charlie's Angels" and televison characters such as Sydney Bristow and the Powderpuff Girls.  The argument he builds posits the fact that women are no longer portrayed as victims, but in many cases the aggresors.  By watching such 'role models', then young girls and women are empowered to take control of situations in their own lives.  While I agree with his premise that Hollywood is finally seeing women as more than sexual objects or helpless victims, I'm not sure that he doesn't approach his argument from too simplistic a view.  One of the problems I have is this notion that somehow physical agression and/or violence is a measuring stick of empowerment.  If that is the case, then we have prisons filled with empowered men and women.  At the same time, I think portraying a woman as a strong and independent being who will not put up with a man's bullshit is a very positive thing.  For too long, our society has pounded this idea into the female psyche that she 'needs' a man to be complete--that some how her role should be subserviant in any relationship whether it be in the romantic, sexual or business realm.  One of the most interesting points in Mr. Leland's piece is the fact that female character can be empowered on screen, but cannot cross the final taboo of sexuality.  To wit, the sexual act is a 'giving in' to male dominance and somehow comprimises the strength of strong female character.  Overall, it's an intesting look into the sociology of gender roles in modern society.   THE LADDER SEEN AROUND THE WORLD  A few weeks back, I happened to see a video clip at  urlLink cyberkenny.com  of an on-air demonstration of a telescoping ladder on the QVC home shopping channel.  Apparently I'm an evil person because I laughed my ass off at the poor guy who took a tumble during a product testimonial.  The clip is just too funny--and host Lisa Robertson is a riot trying to recover from the demo.  Well, now there's a piece in the  New York Times  about how this clip has made the  urlLink rounds  on radio talk shows, bulletin boards, and websites around the world.  That poor guy!   TELEVISION TIDBITS  01.  I'm still hooked on  urlLink "Carnivale" .  It's the most visually arresting and mind-confounding series I've seen in quite a while.  The character studies are wonderful.  The storylines are at once compelling and mystifying.  Each episode seems to bring up more questions.  I can't wait to see how everything ties together (or at least I hope it does). 02.  J.J. Abrams is a genius.  His major plotline of losing two years of Sydney Bristow's life on " urlLink Alias " is paying off in spades.  It's given a lot of great characters renewed life and some dynamite acting bits.  Is it just me, or is Jennifer Garner the hottest woman alive? 03.  This past week, I finally saw an episode of the much maligned " urlLink It's All Relative ".  While there is a lot to polarize viewers, I have to admit that I laughed...quite a bit.  Yes, it's very stereotypical and over the top.  I honestly find his family (the straight couple) to be grating and much more of a stereotype than her family (the gay couple).  It's not groundbreaking television by any means--but it had it's moments.  I've always dug John Benjamin Hickey.  I'm not sure I'd go out of my way to watch it, but I think it's been unfairly given a bad rap.  (Of course, that based on viewing one episode.)   WORD OF THE DAY   urlLink apophysis

       Hmmm?  If you mixed vodka with orange juice and milk of magnesia...would you get a Phillip's Screwdriver?  Why do we say something is out of whack? What is whack?  Do infants enjoy infancy as much as adults enjoy adultery?  If a pig loses its voice...is it then disgruntled?  Why do women wear evening gowns to nightclubs? Shouldn't they be wearing nightgowns?  If love is blind...why is lingerie so popular?  When someone asks you, "A penny for your thoughts?", and you put in your two cents...what happens to the other penny?  Why is the man or woman that invests all of your money called a "broker"?  Why do croutons come in airtight packages? Aren't they just stale bread to begin with?  When cheese gets its picture taken...what does it say?  Why is a person who plays the piano called a pianist, but a person who drives a race care is not called a racist?  Why are a wise man and a wise guy opposites?  Why do overlook and oversee mean opposite things?  If horrific means having the power to horrify, does terrific mean having the power to terrify?  Why isn't 11 pronounced "onety-one"?  "I am" is reportedly the shortest sentence in the English language...Could it be that "I do" is the longest sentence?  If lawyers are disbarred and clergymen defrocked, doesn't it follow that electricians should be delighted, musicians denoted, cowboys deranged, models deposed, tree surgeons debarked, and dry cleaners depressed?  Do Roman paramedics refer to IV's as "4's"?  Why is it that if someone tells you that there are one billion stars in the universe, you will believe them...but if they tell you a wall has wet paint, you will have to touch it to be sure?  If you take an Oriental person and spin him around several times...does he become disoriented?  If people from Poland are called "Poles"...why aren't people from Holland called "Holes"?  If a person with multiple personalities threatens suicide, is that considered a hostage situation?  If a cow laughed, would milk come out her nose?  What ever happened to Preparations A through G?  If olive oil comes from olives, where does baby oil come from?  Why don't they just make mouse-flavored cat food?  Do they have reserved parking for non-handicapped people at the Special Olympics?  Is it true that cannibals don't eat clowns because they taste funny?  Why is when a man talks dirty to a woman, it's sexual harassment; When a woman talks dirty to a man, it's $4.95 per minute?  If it's tourist season, why can't we shoot them?  Is Disney World a people trap operated by a mouse?  Whose cruel idea was it for the word "lisp" to have an "s" in it?  Since light travels faster than sound, isn't that why some people appear bright until you hear them speak?  If it's zero degrees outside today and it's supposed to be twice as cold tomorrow, how cold is it going to be?  Why do people press harder on a remote control when they know the battery is dead?

       IT'S REIGNING MEN  On Friday night, I got together with a few friends from my college days that I had not seen in some time.  We had dinner and drinks and spent time catching up on one another's lives.   After all the sharing, we did our next favorite thing--debating.  We are all a pretty loud crew and rather opinionated.  So we ran through a check list of hot topics: Democratic Presidential candidates, Bush follies, the Anglican Church, Angelina Jolie, etc.  In the end, the most animated discussion came about on the issue of masculinity.  The group I was with was largely gay--and the discussion was very interesting.  The conversation ended up focusing on how masculinity is seen in the gay community as a whole.  While I don't think anyone solved the woes of mankind--or even gaykind--it was lively.  I came home and sat for a good half-hour thinking about the conversation and trying to put my thoughts in perspective.  I belive that issue of masculinity and gay males is an interesting paradox.  The intense pressure to identify and be typified by certain traits or characteristics comes not only from those outside the group, but from those within as well. After all, what signals or denotes a man as being gay? Is it the way he looks? His percentage of body fat? His gym and exercise regimen? His love of show tunes? His use of drugs? The degree of "kink" that presents itself in his sexual expression or repression? His wardrobe? His like or dislike of certain sports? His fondness of dance? His preference for active or passive sexual roles?  While it is true that any one of the aforementioned could be a defining characteristic of a specific individual--taken as a whole, they say very little about the homosexual male in general. Yet, not only are each used by heterosexuals, we unfortunately use them amongst ourselves and in the most over-broad fashion. Perhaps the oddest expression of this is found in the phrase "straight-acting". The mere fact that the root of the phrase is the word "acting" should be enough discussion of that subject, and yet it seems that gay males are entranced and entrenched in the absurdity of such a divining/dividing line.  "Straight-acting". The desire to be straight--or at least play the role? The desire to emulate our heterosexual counterparts? Straight-acting.....as opposed to what? Gay- acting? When is being gay too gay? Why is "too gay" too bad? It all seems to be a mismatched attempt to struggle with a sense of the masculine ideal. By virtue of our birth as males, certain things seem to be true.  Whether an individual male is identified as heterosexual or homosexual, we are by definition of the masculine gender. To paraphrase, a penis is a penis is a penis. Aah, but what you do with it...there's the rub.  To me it seems that along with a penis, most of us are born into a world/society/culture/family that begins at the outset of birth to "teach" us our gender role, identity, and the traits or characteristics that we should aspire to. Now granting that this overly simplistic view does not take into account how much of this gender role or identity is already intact at the time of birth, the larger error is the egocentric view of the world/society/culture/family that you happen to be born into and the "correctness" of their set of morays, standards, ideals, and values as they apply to you as an individual. In other words, we are learning what it is to be a man, i.e. masculine, from birth. But along with each of our own individual genetic codings, we must come to assimilate our personality with a culturally, socially acceptable role as a male in a small microcosm of a large world. One only has to look at the plethora of scientific research and data on cultural diversity and male/female hierarchies in other cultures and societies to see that there is more than one "traditional" male role.  While it is not my intent to take off on a tangent of obtuse anthropological sociology, the reason I raise these issues is to point out that the role a male assumes is determined by many factors. As young boys, some of us are told that "boys do not play with dolls" or "big boys don't cry" and it is impossible to believe that such reinforcement does not influence a boy's sense of what is a masculine ideal, but also how he can attain respect and affection from his parents and/or peers when he can sense internally that those ideals do not fit who he is or wants to be.  So here we are. A group of men--male by anatomical definition, homosexual by sexual distinction--completely lost in a community of conflicting ideals of what it is to be masculine. The folly may be that the answer lies in the eyes of the beholder. One final, and perhaps, cruel irony begs the question: where does this notion of homosexuality as a sliding scale of masculinity vs. femininity come from in the first place?

       SURVIVING...  Last night's episode of  urlLink "Survivor: Pearl Islands"  made several things clear:  01.  Jon Dalton is without a doubt the biggest asshole to ever play this game.  Even Jeff Probst, can barely contain his disdain for this idiot.  That "Johnny Playfair" thing was simply too sad. 02.  Rupert totally deserves to win the title of Survivor.  It's amazing what his little visit to Morgan did for their morale.  You can't help but love the big lug.  Now the question remains, will his dominance eventually lead the others to realize he is too big a threat and vote him out? 03.  My respect for Ryan O. and Andrew S. have increased ten fold--especially for Ryan O. 04.  I had just finished dinner prior to the reward challenge blender-o-rama.  Never again. 05.  Osten continues to prove that big, muscular guys can have an inner-sissy.   HUH?  Ben Geza Affleck's speech on  urlLink accepting  a Spirit of Liberty award from People For The American Way Foundation:   "I only accept it in the hopes that the absurd amounts of publicity that I received lately, that as far as I can tell is chiefly because I have a pretty girlfriend, that's what I did, I am a champion of the American way with a pretty girlfriend -- bring it on, paparazzi, news at 11 -- in the hopes that some of that publicity might be pointed at something more significant, something more positive, productive and meaningful."   Of course, the media is now frothing at the mouth that he referred to J.Lo as his "girlfriend" as opposed to the "F" word.  I could care less.  I just don't understand a single word he said.  Since Matt recently broke his engagement, maybe Ben will just go back to being gay.  He was much more erudite then.   ANGLICAN CHURCH ISSUES PRESSURE  In what can hardly be a surprise, the primates of thirty-seven Anglican churches issued a  urlLink statement  at the close of a meeting in England laying down the groundwork for a schism in the church.  At question is the consecration of Reverend Gene Robinson as the Bishop of New Hampshire.  In part, the directive (aimed at the U.S. Episcopal Church) states that if Robinson is indeed consecrated:    "The future of the communion itself will be put in jeopardy.  This will tear at the fabric of our communion at its deepest level." .   One had to wonder about the immense pressure that has been put upon the shoulders of Reverend Robinson.  He is set for installation on November 2nd.   IT'S ALWAYS SATAN'S FAULT  From the "Why Am I Not Surprised" file,  Lt. Gen William G. Boykin (a Deputy Undersecretary Of Defense) has couched the U.S. effort in Iraq in terms of religion--with support from his boss Donald Rumsfeld.  In a report by the  Los Angeles Times , Boykin is quoted as saying that Islamic extremists hate the United States "because we're a Christian nation, because our foundation and our roots are Judeo-Christians. ... And the enemy is a guy named Satan."  Well, now it's all finally clear--or not.  It is staggering to think that this Administration can't grasp why there is so much hatred towards this country in the International community.  To quote a famous American, "D'Oh!"   BOYS LIKE US #01   "PBS made me gay. Yes, here we have every right-wing nut's three a.m. nightmare come true. They broadcast that homo beam right into my family's suburban living room in the mid-seventies and saved my life. It was that Theater in America production about Oscar Wilde. Thank you, KCET! From you, Public Television, I received my first dose of queer images and a sense of historical place and lineage. (I got a mug and a tote bag, too, but that's another story.) Well, maybe I can't give PBS all of the credit. It could also have been the Los Angeles Civic Light Opera. Its revival of A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum, perhaps? That hopeful utopian downbeat of the tuba in "Comedy Tonight" may have been that magic wand to make me queer. That showstopper, mixed with the cute chorus boy queens in their tunics, of course. Or, while we're indulging in a Greco-Roman mood, maybe it was those delicious Mary Renault novels with all the buffed Athenian ephebes going for Truth and Beauty? A little dab'll do ya! No, wait, I know. It had to have been George Frideric Handel. His music helped tell me who I was and sent me zooming out of the closet accompanied by those tacky sparklers he wrote music about. Yes, there is absolutely no question: Handel's Messiah made me into a faggot! ---Tim Miller

       CALIFORNICATION  Hmmm.  So Dubya is on his way to  urlLink meet  with the new Governor of Kalee-four-nya, er California.  Seems a rat can smell cheese from miles away.  Bush and Co. are now salivating profusely over California's electoral votes. At one time, the thought of California becoming a Republican stronghold seemed laughable.  After the bang-up job said electorate did in the recall saga, I now have no hope left for modern civilization.  Okay, so I'm feeling dramatic.  Shoot me.  Please.   OPEN YER WINDOWS  This just in...grab yourselves and hold on to something.  Microsoft  urlLink announced  yesterday that they have discovered four (more) critical flaws in its Windows XP and 2000 operating systems.  Wonder when their headquarters is moving to California?   WAITING FOR YOUR DOWNLOAD?  The European Organisation For Nuclear Research (CERN)  urlLink announced  that it has set a new speed record for internet data transmission.  The organization acknowledged that on October 1st, it sent 1.1 Terabytes of data at 5.44 gigabits a second (Gbps) to a lab at the California Institute of Technology.  So, how fast is that?  The new speed record is more than 20,000 times faster than a typical home broadband connection--the equivalent to transferring a 60-minute compact disc within one second.  I'm changing my ISP.   32 CANDLES  One of John Hughes's teen-angst classics is getting a sequel--sixteen years later.  A television  urlLink project  from the USA Network, the film is supposed to pick up right before Samantha Baker's 32nd birthday.  I just can't picture it if they don't sign Molly Ringwald.  Then again,  I'm not sure I want to picture it at all.  Sometimes Hollywood just needs to learn to leave well-enough alone.  Whatever happened to Michael Schoeffling anyhow?    AVAIL  I keep replaying I keep resaying I try repraying To no avail  Nothing to do Nothing to explain No hope I'll stay No avail  It's all about freedom Overcoming egos Slaying platitudes ...and mostly it's about me  What I can do to be free How I can learn to love me Avail

       MORE SIGNS OF THE APOCALYPSE  Billy Ray Cyrus and his "achy breaky heart" are coming back to record stores near you.  Back October 28th with the release of  urlLink "The Other Side" , Cyrus has traded in the mullet for a revelation from God that he should record an "inspirational" album testifying to his "deep Christian faith".  I'm pretty sure the Anti-Christ lives on Pennsylvania Avenue.  I'm just waiting for my Dasani to turn to blood.   FURTHER SIGNS OF THE APOCALYPSE  The Catholic Church now asserts that HIV-infected individuals should not use  urlLink condoms  as they do not protect against the disease or its transmission.  Who knew there was a branch of the Centers For Disease Control in Vatican City?  Is it a wonder I don't go to church any longer.   HOW TO WIN FRIENDS AND INFLUENCE PEOPLE  Late Tuesday, the United States  urlLink vetoed  an Arab backed U.N. resolution denouncing Israel's building of a "security fence" on Palestinian territories in the disputed West Bank.  The U.S. said the failure to denounce acts of terrorism and the groups responsible made the resolution "unbalanced".  There were four countries (Great Britain, Cameroon, Germany and Bulgaria) who abstained from voting.  With the U.S. continuing to shield Israel from any fault in the ongoing unrest in the Middle East--instead of trying to constructively work with the parties involved.  While Palestinians shoulder their share of the blame, Israel's failure to recognize the established "Green Line" partitions serves to further aggrevate the situation.    KIDMAN BROKE NO LAW  The lovely Nicole Kidman reigned  urlLink victorious  in her legal action against the British tabloid,  The Sun .  The paper had claimed that Kidman had an affair with the lovely Jude Law on the set of their upcoming Winter flick "Cold Mountain".  Further, the paper claimed said affair led to the break-up of Law's marriage to Sadie Frost.  Ms. Kidman gained a formal apology and an undisclosed (but rumored five-figure) settlement.  Ms. Kidman is no homewrecker.  Truth be told, I had an affair with Mr. Law.  I did.  Really.  Ms. Frost no longer speaks to me.   THE GOOD GIRL  Last night I watched Miguel Arteta's  urlLink "The Good Girl"  on DVD.  While the films pacing and editing are a bit choppy, one can't help but be won over by the winning performances of Jennifer Aniston, Jake Gyllenhaal, Tim Blake Nelson and John C. Reilly.  Disarmingly funny and ultimately tinged with a dollop of fatalism, the DVD features a bevy of goodies.  Along with commentary from Arteta and Aniston, the film's writer Mike White adds to the insights.  There are nine deleted scenes and an alternate ending.  Aniston reveals that she has acting chops beyond "Friends".  How much do I love "Retail Rodeo" and the brilliant Zooey Deschanel as the quirky Cheryl?  Two Thumbs way up.

       THE GREAT SNAKE OIL TOUR  The White House is intent on shoring up support for their Iraq policy.  In recent days, speeches aimed at spotlightling the Bush Administration's "progress in Iraq" have come from  Bush, Cheney, Rice, Rumsfeld, and Powell.   What amounts to a glorified publicity campaign is drawing  urlLink criticism  from Democrats and Republicans alike.  Particularly infurating are Cheney's remarks in a speech given to the conservative Heritage Foundation.  Cheney once again asserted that Saddam Hussein did indeed possess weapons of mass destruction and was an eminent threat to the United States and other countries.  He also again made claims that Hussein had direct links to Al Qaeda.  Perhaps most distressing was Cheney's assertion that the United States had the right to defend itself against any perceived threat -- with or without unanimous international support.   Personally, I'm reminded of the tale of the boy who cried wolf one time too many.   DEAR EDITOR  So, did you hear the one about the heartwarming letter from a soldier in Iraq extolling the great work the U.S. is doing and how grateful the Iraqi children are?  Apparently, at least eleven U.S. newspapers  urlLink received  similar letters from different soldiers.  There is even at least one claim of a forged signature.  I'm sure no one in  our  government was responsible for this campaign *cough*.     THE FLU & YOU  I had my influenza  urlLink vaccination  yesterday.  I'm always a bit hesitant to get it, but it seems to be highly advisable in this post-SARS year.   PRODUCT OF THE WEEK   urlLink L'Occitane Hand Cream

WEEKEND WORK  I spent the entire weekend moving in new furniture and rearranging my bedroom.  It really opened up a lot of under-utilized space and I'm really liking it.  I never realized how big a king-size bed was until I had to move one.  My aching back.  It's a real sense of accomplishment to put in all the work and end up liking the result.  Of course, today I'm tired.  With a capital T.

       THE LEGACY OF DANIEL PEARL  Today is the 2nd annual  urlLink Daniel Pearl Music Day  .  Today would have also been Daniel Pearl's 40th birthday.  An astute journalist for the  Wall Street Journal , Pearl was kidnapped in January 2002 by Islamic extremists while working in Pakistan.  His death was confirmed on February 21, 2002.  Besides his obvious journalistic talents, Daniel Pearl loved music.  His family and friends saw music as a way to honor his memory and their love for him.  One only has to read any of the collective writings of Mr. Pearl to see that he was a man of uncommon principle and a terrific writer.  Many of his writings have been collected in an amazing volume titled  urlLink "At Home in the World: Collected Writings from the Wall Street Journal" .  I would highly recommend it to gain insight into the man that was Daniel Pearl.   Daniel sincerely believed in the power of music.  He also believed in telling the stories of those who did not have a voice.  A man who believed the power of humanity and lived his life espousing those beliefs.  His song ended too abruptly.   KOBE BRYANT CIRCUS  After much speculation from legal analysts that Kobe Bryant's defense team would waive the preliminary hearing, they were  urlLink swiftly   proven wrong.  In my opinion, the amount of media coverage this case has received is ridiculous--and at the same time all too predictable.  Not having been a Bryant fan or knowing anything of the nineteen year-old woman at the center of this case, I really found myself having no particular thoughts on this case--until today.  While I imagine very few people know exactly what happened in that hotel room in Edwards, Colorado, it certainly has not stopped a groundswell of strong opinions and emotions on this case.  Against a backdrop of media speculation and death threats, a few of the factual details were made public in the course of the hearing on Thursday.  What I have heard and read of Kobe Bryant's defense team--in particular Pamela Mackey--is simply the most vile of court antics and strategy.  I have no idea who is guilty or innocent in this case.  But, I do know that rape shield laws exsist for a reason.  Ms. Mackey's contention that she "accidentally" named the accuser six times in open court proceedings is beyond ludicrous.  But, that was only the beginning of Ms. Mackey's contempt of courtroom etiquette.  The hearing came to a screeching halt during Ms. Mackey's cross-examination of a sheriff's detective. Asking if the accuser's injuries would be consistent with someone who had had sex with three different men in three days, Ms. Mackey stepped way over the line of decency.  The implication there in being that the victim's bruising and vaginal tearing were prior injuries occuring before consensual sex with her client--and that the accuser was a promiscuous woman.  Beyond how offensive and vile I find Ms. Mackey's courtroom antics, the reality of this line of defense is all too common.  If a woman claims rape, she's obbviously either a slut or a liar.  Even if it were the case that the alleged victim engaged in sex with 80 men in one day, that does little to address the allegations brought against Mr. Bryant.  It all comes back to that  simple--but seemingly cryptic issue--of when "no" means "no".  If the woman was forced to have sexual intercourse against her will (even while acknowledging flirting, kissing and/or groping with the defendant), she should not be made to look like the town whore or a mentally unstable nutcase.  It is interesting to note that police said that the alleged victim's blood was found on a shirt belonging to Mr. Bryant.  It is also evident that there are some questions to be asked about the alleged victim's statement.  Not presuming the guilt or innocence of anyone, the actions of the defense portend that this trial will be fought in the gutter.   DRAKE SNAKE  How totally misguided was the Drake tribe's decision to "throw" the immunity challenge on last night's  urlLink "Survivor: Pearl Islands" ?  Losing the challenge not only lost them one of the strongest links of their team--Rupert--but eventually led to the ouster of Burton.  Even more ghastly was the spectacle of a drunken Jon who gleefully betrayed his alliance and generally acted like a true ass.  The look on Jeff Probst's face when he asked Jon "Are you loaded?" was priceless.  Meanwhile, it was a bit hard not to feel  for the Morgan tribe as their morale boosting win was no more than a hollow victory.    VERONICA GUERIN  I caught a screening of Joel Schumacher's  urlLink "Veronica Guerin"  starring the beautiful Cate Blanchett.  While the true life story of journalist Veronica Guerin has been made into at least one other movie and a documentary, this incarnation is gripping.  Guerin was a crime beat reporter who went after notorious drug lords in Dublin, Ireland in the mid-1990's.  She was brutally murdered in 1996.  Cate Blanchett gives one of those transcendental performances where you forget you are watching an actor and feel like you are peeking into the life of a real person--not just a character in a film.  Strong, heady, emotionally wrenching, Blanchett gives one of the best performances by an actress in film this year.  While the movie is not likely to become a box-office hit, don't deprive yourself of checking out an exquisite performance.

       A BEAUTIFUL LIFE  Kevyn Aucoin lived a colorful life.  Albeit, his story ended way too abruptly.  Now a new autobiography serves as a fitting tribute to a man who touched many lives.    urlLink "Kevyn Aucoin: A Beautiful Life"  by Kerry Diamond hit bookstores on September 23rd.  The book wonderfully contrasts Kevyn's childhood filled with struggles with that of the one he would lead as a king of high glamour.  The book frankly tackles the homophobia that Aucoin faced in a small Southern town.  It also celebrates the life of a man who new that beauty was truly in the eye of the beholder.  He found beauty in everyone.  The fact that he was so beloved by many of his star and high fashion clients is a testament to the man.  In this wonderfully written tribute, many share their personal experiences with Mr. Aucoin.  Among those sharing stories are: Barbra Streisand, Julia Roberts, Shirley MacLaine, Tina Turner, Hillary Swank, Christy Turlington and Janet Jackson.  Beyond the famous faces he used as a canvas, he became indispensable and a cherished friend to many others.  The book also does a nice job at cataloging some of Aucoin's techniques and secrets and features some superb photography.  One of the most interesting parts of the book are Polaroid photos that Aucoin kept in his datebook from various photo shoots he worked on.  Endearing, funny, and poignant, they showcase just how much Kevyn Aucoin loved what he did and the fact that he was just as starstruck by his clients as the general population is.  Surely, there are a few more angels on that catwalk blessed by Aucoin's talent and love of life.   TOUT BEAU  An idea brewing since 1984, Jean Paul Gaultier is getting ready to introduce U.S. men to cosmetics in a big way.  Already unveiled in Europe and Japan, the Jean Paul Gaultier "Le Male Tout Beau" collection will start hitting store shelves in January 2004.  The collection of eight items has been formulated with not only Gaultier's niche gay audience--but all men--in mind.  Very sleek in design and packaging (in all black), the line will include bronzing powder, muted skin-tone lip colors, eye pencil and concealer.  Gaultier continues his quirky packaging and design, by introducing products like a combo eye pencil/concealer that resembles a Flair pen for a touch up that is only a breast pocket away.  Always known for his gender-bending men's fashion, he hopes that men are finally ready to  urlLink embrace   their vanity.  A large publicity campaign is slated for fashion magazines later this year.     IN DA HOOD  Ghettopoly, the game, is causing a stink in some neighborhoods.  A parody of the traditional board game Monopoly, Ghettopoly has  urlLink sparked  the ire of some Black leaders and clergy.  The game features "playas" acting as pimps and collecting cards that read among other things "You got yo whole neighborhood addicted to crack. Collect $50". Perhaps the thing that has upset most critics is the use of character names intentionally mispelled such as "Malcum X" and "Martin Luthor King Jr. Created by David Chang, Ghettopoly will soon be   urlLink joined  by such fare as HipHopoply and Redneckopoly.  But, I actually think the criticism is a bit disingenuous.  One only need to look at fashion and music to see the "pimp" lifestyle being coveted by both black and white youth.  With role models like Snoop Dogg and 50 Cent, what do people expect?  Maybe I'm just being particularly politically incorrect, but I can see the humor in the game--and I certainly do not consider myself a racist in any form or fashion.  The typical protest among novelty items such as this game usually only serve to swell the popularity of said item.  Trying to form boycotts against Urban Outfitters for selling the game is at best misguided.  These games merely reflect popular culture.  No, it's not you grandparent.s parlour game--but it never portended to be one.  We can--and should--all laugh at ourselves now and again.   THE PATRIOT ACT?  Does anyone want to lay odds that the FBI  urlLink bugging  of the office of Philadelphia's mayor, John Street, will not be an isolated instance?  Though the exact reasons for the covert eavesdropping have not been made public, one has to wonder how much easier it is for the Federal Government to gain entre into offices across the country in the name of national security.    THE MUCH MALIGNED "POP" STAR   Time  magazine's Josh Tyrangiel writes an interesting  urlLink piece  on the state of pop music and a case study of the success (or failure) of the marketing of Clay Aiken.  The article points out how many at Aiken's own label find pop music to be laughable.  Many industry insiders make the case that pop music is a dying breed being overtaken by urban hip-hop and rock.  If you read between the lines, the contempt that record companies have for the average consumer is rather alarming.  Aiken acquits himself nicely in the article:    "There are many people at the record label who are afraid of me.  They don't understand the reasons that someone as uncool as me is here. In a way--and this is a horrible word to say, and once I say it you're going to print it--it's a revolution."   It will be interesting to see if Aiken can pull off a successful--and sustainable--debut despite the label's naysaying and his aversion to songs rife with sexual innuendo and double entendres.   ANAGRAMATICS  * David Letterman = nerd amid late tv * Salman Rushdie = read shun islam * the earthquakes = that queer shake * software = swear oft * New York Times = monkeys write * Statue Of Liberty = built to stay free   EXIT : LEFT  sometimes the obvious takes its sweet time we knew the suspects, but not the crime then it hit me like a ton of bricks i kept my promises, while you picked out tricks the vows we made, i kept them near my heart all the while, you shredded them apart yes, i was naive believing in picket fences feeling with my heart and not my senses but, you made a promise--true blue and i had the deepest faith in you so now i've learned you can't give devotion to a man of mixed emotion i must confess, time has hurt me but he also made me see i don't want to be your lover when there's another but were we not the rage before you exited the stage?

       THE MORNING AFTER  It's kind of like Elvis Costello writing in the liner notes of "Goodbye Cruel World", "Congratulations! You have just bought our worst album!".  Yeah, like that.   THE SUN WILL COME OUT TOMORROW  You must check out the Cyndi Lauper clip on  urlLink young bradford's  site yesterday.  A promo clip for her upcoming album, "At Last", it's brilliant.  Her album of classic covers like "At Last", "Walk On By", "Unchained Melody", "Stay", and "'Til You Come Back To Me" will be released on November 18th.

       GEORGE DUBYA: PRESIDENT, POET, PROPHET, PUTZ  I was a good boy.  I didn't make one untoward comment about Mr. Bush's poetic ode to the First Lady (nevermind the fact he likened her to a lump in the bed--how romantic!).  I so wanted to write something catty and sarcastic.  But, he has been a recurring theme (like a nightmare) in many of my rants.  One might get the impression I despise the man--and that would be a pretty good impression.  In the end, I figured I'd skip his Shakespearean effort as I was sure he'd do something else stupid soon enough.  Well, time's up.  Endorsing the fine work of groups like the Christian Coalition, the American Family Association and the Southern Baptist Convention, President Bush has signed a proclamation  urlLink declaring  October 12th-18th "Marriage Protection Week".  No, they are not handing out condoms to married heterosexuals.  Instead, the President offers another heaping dose of his contemptuous disdain for the GLBT community.  Among his choice remarks were the following:   "Marriage is a sacred institution, and its protection is essential to the continued strength of our society. Marriage Protection Week provides an opportunity to focus our efforts on preserving the sanctity of marriage and on building strong and healthy marriages in America.  Marriage is a union between a man and a woman, and my administration is working to support the institution of marriage by helping couples build successful marriages and be good parents."     Regardless of what my personal opinion or stance on the issue of gay marriage, I cannot help but be truly offended at his backhanded insult that parents can be nothing other than heterosexual.  Such a narrow view from such a narrow mind.  If the Democratic Party doesn't get its act together soon and find a consensus candidate, I'm going to...  I have no idea what I'm going to do.  I just know that this Texas Good Ol' Boy must be removed from the White House and sent back to killing possums on his farm.  It's getting to the point where I can  almost  understand the general apathy that seems to grip the whole of the electorate.  Politics is indeed an ugly business--and frankly, neither of the major political parties has had much to offer a constituency hungering for something more than war, scandals, and business as usual.  Let's be frank.  I despise the man.  I admire the system.  However, when you look at the circus atmosphere of an election like the one taking place in California today and listen to the words of the man elected to lead our country, you really have to worry.  Or at least, I do.   INDIANAPOLIS COLTS  While I'm not big on the NFL as I once was, I still carry the torch for the Colts.  I've been a fan of  urlLink Peyton Manning  since his storied days at the University Of Tennessee.  I think he's not only a remarkable athlete, but a truly good human being.   I have quite a collection of Colts and Manning memorabilia.  Okay, I admit I have always had this schoolgirl crush on him. I'm not really sure why, but he just does it for me--and apparently his wife.  On Monday night, the Colts went to Tampa to play the reigning Super Bowl champion Tampa Bay Buccaneers.  With Tony Dungy at the helm (who the Buccaneers had fired in 2002), the Colts took a sterling 4-0 season with them into the game--and started playing dismally soon falling behind 21-0.  But if you stuck through the game, you were handsomely rewarded.  With less than four minutes left in regulation play, the Colts were down by 21 points and  urlLink rallied  to an OT victory over the Buc's with a final score of 38-35.  Simply mind boggling.  The Colts stampede continues forward 5-0.   BIOLOGICS R' US  From the D'Oh! file:  A draft report from the General Accounting Office says the U.S. Department Of Defense was  urlLink selling  equipment that could be used to make biological warfare agents to the general public on the internet.  Gee, terrorists are no longer limited to just shopping on eBay.

       FROGS FROM HEAVEN  One of the most jarring scenes in Paul Thomas Anderson's brilliant film 'Magnolia' is the infamous "frog rain".   More times than not, people remember this film for that scene instead of its brilliant character studies.    The recent storm that was Hurricane Isabel proves once again that life is often stranger than fiction.  A Connecticut man heard what he thought was hail  urlLink pelting  his roof as the remenants of the storm passed over.  Much to his surprise, it turns out that they were gelatinous frog eggs.  Scientists are hypothesizing that the eggs originated in North Carolina and were carried by the storm.   CREMATING FOR DOLLARS  This story is so wrong on so many levels, but I now am rethinking my stance on  urlLink cremation .  Word to the squeamish: Don't.    REICHEN  LEHMKUHL  In an interesting interview with  urlLink  Metro Weekly  , Reichen discusses his Air Force Academy experience, the fact that he and Chip Arndt are now officially no longer together (which had been a topic of much speculation), and the infamous "Don't Ask, Don't Tell" military policy.    HANGING CHADS?  With 135 candidates on tomorrow's California election ballot, why do I have the sinking feeling that the circus that will follow will make Florida look civil.  Also, if Californians actually do put the Terminator in office--how much time before there's another recall election?  So much for that state budget crisis.   SONG LYRIC OF THE DAY  I like your pants around your feet I like the dirt that's on your knees And I like the way you still say please While you're looking up at me You're like my favourite damn disease --"Figured You Out" by Nickelback

       NIP/TUCK  Hollywood's fascination with plastic surgery has always been its dirty little secret.  That secret that no one ever admits to, but every one talks about behind their back.  As with most anything, I guess that if it's something you want to do and you can afford it--more power to you.  I don't think it's something I'd ever consider (vain Leo that I am).  Joan Rivers is someone who's never made a secret of her "work".  I love Joan.  I think she's hilarious and I've long admired her.  But, I often wonder if things get pulled up one more time will her eyes end up on her forehead?  Now, I have seen some Hollywood types have work done that looks natural (as natural as plastic can be).  I personally know a couple of people who've had a breast augmentation here, a nose job there and a tummy tuck or two.  In most cases, it's something that really seems to help the person with self-esteem issues.  So, I would have to say there are benefits to having things "done".  So this weekend while I was busy doing nothing, I decided I'd better attack my ever-growing pile of magazines.  Laying on the bed, I thumbed through issues of "W", "Time", "Genre", "Flaunt" and all the other 700 magazines I subscribe to.  One of my absolute favorites is "Entertainment Weekly" or "EW" as it is lovingly referred to.  For the most part, their magazine is a fun read and has some great photography.  The covers are usually very keen.  As I reached over to pull the magazine with the pink background off the stack, I thought to myself, "who the hell is that?".  Now, I am supposed to wear my glasses when I read (and most of the time I do).  I didn't have them on in this instance and it was perhaps a blessing in disguise.  With the October 3rd issue in front of me, I shuddered in horror.  There was Uma Thurman's puss bigger than life.  She's obviously had a little something-something done recently.  Okay, she's had  A LOT  something done.  They've pulled this women back so tight that if she crosses her legs her mouth is liable to snap open.  What happened?  Maybe "EW" should have pulled the camera back a bit....like to another state.  Later that day, I saw a trailer for Tarantino's new movie, "Kill Bill, Volume I", starring Ms. Thurman.  I looked at the screen and then back at the cover.  It's not the same woman.  Has she called her lawyers yet?  Ms. Thurman is not alone in her jarring 'makeover'.  I recently saw some pictures of Meg Ryan that were...um....interesting.  The more I think about it, I'll just take the wrinkles and age gracefully. (I'm just kidding God.)   MEASURE OF A MAN  If you are a fan of Clay Aiken, there's a great interview with Fred Bronson up over at Billboard.com discussing the tracks on his debut album,  urlLink "Measure Of A Man" .  The first single, "Invisible" is starting to get airplay.       JOSS STONE  Check out this sixteen-year old British sensation as she makes a slated appearance on Monday's "Good Morning America".  Her album " urlLink The Soul Sessions " is a revelation.  She covers everything from Betty Wright to The White Stripes.

       THE MUSIC BEGINS...  Recently, I was having a discussion with a group of friends about music--and in particular about how certain songs remind you important events or people from your past when you hear them. I firmly believe (being a music junkie) that music is truly a "soundtrack" to one's life. The reason this discussion came about is that someone had mentioned the year 1979. Of course, this was arguably the height of the Disco Era. It was also in the Spring of 1979 that I was a freshman in high school--which in itself is a traumatic enough ordeal. But, one seemingly innocuous moment from that time remains with me in crystal clarity.   While I personally believe that I was born gay--when you 'come out' many people inevitably arrive at this question: "When did you know you were gay?". It was in 1979 in a freshman physical education class that the answer was written for me. If I had not already subconsciously arrived at that conclusion, it was most definitely the moment when and where I confronted myself and my sexuality.  It was on a particularly beautiful Spring day in 1979, my gym class was on a practice field playing soccer. For a reason that now escapes my memory, myself and a classmate were called out of class early (I believe it was for a student council related activity) and sent to the lockerroom to shower and change and be on our way to said activity. As I sat on a bench undressing, I found myself intently watching my classmate undress. It was the first time in my life that I can recall being completely amazed by the beauty of the naked male form. Now in hindsight, it is easy to recall that he was a total hunk to begin with. What was startling to me (and I don't think I mean this in a sexual way necessarily) is being in awe of the beauty of his naked body. For the first time, I wanted to possess this beauty....touch this beauty. It felt so natural and so right. Of course, it goes without saying that I was a scared little gay boy and nothing ever happened (beyond gaining a multitude of fodder for my own self-gratification). But it was at that precise moment, on that very day, that I knew without a shred of doubt, that I was a 100% homosexual. I think this event marks the beginning of my struggle in the 'coming-out' process...and a long and arduous one it would be.

       THE ANNE HECHE SYNDROME?  Poor  urlLink Courtney Love .  She appears to have taken one of those astral projections that Ms. Heche was on.  Ms. Love was arrested early Thursday morning apparently 'under the influence' of a narcotic while breaking windows to gain access to a home in Los Angeles.  Apparently, door bells are not the rage on the West Coast.  After being arrested and released, it is reported that Ms. Love overdosed later the same day and was taken by ambulance to a hospital.   ROBBIE & LINDA  Taking a page from Pink's book,  urlLink Robbie Williams  is said to be in the studio with producer Linda Perry (ex-lead singer for 4 Non Blondes) working on new material.  Williams recently had a less than amicable split with former writing partner Guy Chambers.  The move is being reported in the U.K. press as a return to an edgier, harder rock sound.  (Coincidentally, Ms. Perry had been working with Ms. Love on her solo outing, "America's Sweetheart", which was supposed to bow at the end of the year.)    Look America, I just don't understand what you have against Mr. Williams?  Take That was not his fault.  Actually, I liked Take That.  But that's a topic for another day.  The fact that Mr. Williams has not had any much deserved success in the U.S. is truly a crime.  He's tried with great songs like "Millennium", "Rock DJ", and "Feel".  But, radio programming directors and pop music fans seemed to take little notice.  I have been a fan since I received my U.K. import copy of " urlLink Life Thru a Lens ".  Every album since has been a revelatory look at a talented singer/songwriter.  I purchased both the U.K. and U.S release of his last--and perhaps most underrated work--" urlLink Escapology ".  His songs are more clever than half of the dreck that hits the upper echelon of the pop music charts these days.  I just don't get it.  Then again, I was probably one of five U.S. residents who bought and loved Gary Barlow's " urlLink Open Road ".     Okay, I feel better.

He's sorry though. 04.   urlLink Survivor: Pearl Islands --That poor Morgan Tribe cannot catch a break. 05.   urlLink Ig Nobel Prize --Homosexuality & necrophilia in ducks?

       THE BOY FROM OZ  Later this month, Hugh Jackman bows in his Broadway debut playing the legendary Peter Allen in  urlLink 'The Boy From Oz' .  While Jackman is probably best known in the U.S. for his turn as Wolverine in the 'X-Men' franchise, he does have a stage background.  He played the role of Curly in a U.K. production of 'Oklahoma' to rave reviews.  He's also appeared in his native Australia in the companies of 'Beauty & The Beast' and 'Sunset Boulevard'.  Early word from previews is that Jackman is masterful in the role of song and dance man Allen (who was discovered by Judy Garland and later married daughter Liza).  His voice is said to be strong and commanding--a revelation that is sure to surprise many.  Also in the cast as Allen's partner (Greg) is the wonderfully talented and Tony winning actor,  urlLink Jarrod Emick , who will get to kiss Jackman nightly.  'The Boy From Oz' opens at the Imperial Theatre on October 16.   BERRY REDUX  Back on the 26th of September, I mentioned that gossip was brewing about one of the strangest celebrity pairings I've seen in a while--Halle Berry & Fred Durst.  A recent  urlLink announcement  from Berry will surely add fuel to the fire.  She released a statement on Wednesday saying that she has indeed separated from her husband of nearly three year, singer Eric Benet.  Marital problems were given as the cause.  Damn, maybe he did do it all for the nookie?   INTERNATIONAL TERRORIST?  A Dearborn, Michigan high school student, Bretton Barber, has  urlLink won  a legal battle against the Dearborn School District.  Barber wore a t-shirt to school emblazoned with George W. Bush's portrait and the tagline "International Terrorist".  He was ordered to either cover the shirt or go home, which he did.  In a ruling released by the ACLU (who sued on Barber's behalf), U.S. District Court Judge Patrick J. Duggan ruled in part that,   "There is no evidence that the T-shirt created any disturbance or disruption."   Interestingly enough, the Detroit high school in question has a large Arab-American population.  It was one of the reasons given by school officials for the action against Barber, as they feared it would "inflame passions" among the student body.  Ironically, Barber ordered the t-shirt on the Internet.   QUEER HISTORIANS  Here's an interesting piece written by Scott McLemme and published in  The Chronicle Of Higher Education :  urlLink "A Queer Notion of History: Research On Gay And Lesbian Life Makes Its Mark" .  I suppose moving to Oklahoma is out of the question?   SCENE FROM AN ELLIPTICAL CONVERSATION  A small snippet of an interesting conversation I had with a first-time reader of this weblog.  I shall refer to him as "X".  "X" is heterosexual.  "X" is a casual acquaintance who I met researching a project.  X: "You sure do have a lot of queer stuff on your site." 0: "I'm curious to know why you said 'queer stuff'?" X: "That is what you all prefer to be called these days?  I thought.....Did I offend you?" 0: "First, I'm not sure which "you all" you are referring to.  Secondly, it did not offend me.  I was just curious as to why you chose that word." X: "Well, I've really never thought about it when talking to you.  I mean....it's not really an issue we talk....I mean I know you are gay." 0: "Yep, I would be gay or queer or whatever word you feel comfortable using.  It doesn't bother me.  Trust me, I've been called worse...." X: "I just figured "queer" was more acceptable these days.  Like that television show." 0: "Oh, Um....okay, I understand why you said queer.  But why 'queer stuff'?" X: "I just meant that there were a lot of entries dealing with issues about homosexuality...."  0: "That would probably be because it's my perspective.  It's about issues and ideas I care about.  But, I think to say it's just 'queer stuff' is a bit unfair..." X: "I certainly didn't mean to offend you.  I guess I stuck my foot in my mouth?" 0: "No.  You gave your opinion.  That's valid.  I asked you what you thought.  The only thing I thought was strange is that I don't think I've ever heard you say the word 'queer' in any conversations we've had...." X: "I'm sorry......I...." 0: "You certainly don't have anything to apologize for.  There is a lot of 'queer stuff' on my weblog.  I'm queer.  I guess it's like a filter that I view things through.  But, I hope you realize that what I write is not meant to be just for a gay audience.  It certainly is colored by my opinions..." X: "Well, I apologize for saying 'you all'.  That made me sound like I was looking down....or being negative.  I guess I wasn't comfortable--or didn't know how to address the gay content on your site. 0: "Look, there's no need for apologies or for feeling uncomfortable.  I knew what you meant.  I guess I was just curious why you said 'queer stuff' as opposed to 'gay stuff' or 'homosexual stuff'.  It was not meant to be a judgement of you.  You can use whatever word you feel comfortable with." X: "Okay.  So like I said.  There's a lot of queer stuff on your site."

       A MUST READ  On Tuesday,  Boston Herald  sports columnist, Ed Gray, freely  urlLink outed  himself in a wonderfully written column.  Not surprisingly, Gray notes that the arena of male dominated sports is one in which homophobia is rampant.  Identifying himself as a gay athlete and gay sportswriter, Gray writes:   "I'm out because I no longer, in good conscience, choose to ignore the unabashed homophobia that is so cavalierly tolerated within the world of sports. I'm out, because the silence of a closeted gay man only serves to give his implicit approval to bigotry. I'm out, because I refuse to continue hiding from the truth that an openly gay man has as much right as a straight man to play sports or report on them.   Gray goes on to make the case that the "locker room" mentality of sports perpetuates the environment of homophobia and keeps gay athletes in the closet.    Mr. Gray, I admire your courage and honesty.   THE FIGHT CLUB  In complete contrast, author  urlLink Chuck Palahniuk , claims that he outed himself due to threat of an  Entertainment Weekly  piece that was going to.  A very angry audioblog entry  detailing the betrayal of the  EW  reporter writing the piece was left on Palahniuk's website and then was quickly yanked.  (To be fair, it should be noted that personal details of the life of the writer in question were left in the audio entry during Palahniuk's understandable rant.)   The published transcripts of his  urlLink audioblogs  have also not captured this entry.  The following reference remains in the transcript of a September 23 audioblog:   " I would like to ask, in the meantime I'm gonna try and relax and I would like to ask everybody else to relax and back off a little bit from Entertainment Weekly, Um, Yeah, that's all I can ask.  I'm gonna try and relax about this and if you all would try and relax as well, I would appreciate that. I'm just taking it one day at a time, trying to get through this and got three events in London this week so maybe I'll see ya'. But, let's just back off, relax and not kill anybody and call it good.  I'll talk to you later, Bye."   Palahniuk also stated that he had literally been blackmailed in the past by writers wanting cash not to reveal the fact that he was gay and had a partner.  Whatever Mr. Palahniuk's reasons were for maintaining the privacy of his personal life, they should have been respected by anyone calling themselves a journalist.  The fact that his wishes were apparently not heeded  is just another reminder how the outing of public figures is still considered a sport.  Sensationalistic fodder for writers that pander to the tabloid trash side of journalism.  Any public figure--whether celebrity or politician--should have the right to decide what facets of their private lives they wish to keep private or public.  Someone's bedroom should not be considered public domain simply because they have a modicum of noteriety.  After a backlash from Palahniuk's fans and supporters, it now appears that the  EW  piece will never see the light of day.  However, I suppose the damage has already been done.  Interestingly enough, there is actually a building criticism in some corners that Mr. Palahniuk outed himself and should blame no one else for it.   WONDERLAND  Lion's Gate will release  urlLink 'Wonderland'  on October 3rd in New York and Los Angeles (opening wide October 17th).  It will be curious to see how this movie is received.  They couldn't have put together a more wonderful cast in Val Kilmer, Lisa Kudrow, Josh Lucas, Dylan McDermott, Tim Blake Nelson, Kate Bosworth, Jeneane Garofalo and Eric Bogosian among others.  While the obvious draw will be Kilmer's portrayal of porn legend John Holmes, the story revolves around the infamous quadruple murders that occured on Wonderland Avenue in 1981.  Early buzz has Kilmer and Kudrow giving powerhouse performances.  The official website features downloadable production notes via PDF.  It's a great read.   QUOTE OF THE DAY    "Arnold Schwarzenegger is a charming man. He's a nice man. But really, he has no idea how to run a state, and he's going to be run by the very forces that basically have destroyed so much of California." ---Arianna Huffington on CNN's 'Larry King Live' (announcing her withdrawal from the California gubernatorial race)    PUT YOUR FOOT (AMONG OTHER THINGS) IN YOUR MOUTH   "I don't think he's been that good from the get-go.  I think what we've had here is a little social concern in the NFL. The media has been very desirous that a black quarterback do well. There is a little hope invested in McNabb, and he got a lot of credit for the performance of this team that he didn't deserve. The defense carried this team." ---Rush Limbaugh, on an ESPN pre-game commentary  To quote Al Franken, "Rush Limbaugh Is A Big Fat Idiot".

       MELT  like that spike of ice dangling from the eaves  crystalline and moist like tears on my sleeves  it's so fleeting and not long for this place  soon to be crashing on earth sans grace   it melts like my heart did when I met you  it's a mystery with glorious glints of blue  it sparkles like your eyes when we locked  when my heart's want could not be blocked   glassy smooth, with a forming drop at its tip  wet like my kiss upon your trembling lip  gravity pulls the delicate drop into its lair  like we pulled each others body into a pair   the sun glances to see the ice melt  heating like the warmth our faces felt  shards of diamonds tumble to the ground  glimmering like stones of love all around   the icicles have gone, waiting for the freeze  love has come swirling on the brisk breeze  we watched it patiently drop away  two hearts fueled by liquid spray

       SILENT ALL THESE YEARS  My parents were divorced by the time I was five years old.  My mother raised me and my sister on her own.  In the end, it was probably the best for everyone involved.  My father had two dirty little secrets that threatened any attempt at being a family.  He was an alcoholic.  He also was an angry drunk who became physically abusive toward my mother.  We're not talking a shove and a slap abusive.  Before my mother made the decision to leave him, she spent nearly a month in the hospital--most of the time in a coma.  When I was old enough to understand the concept of divorce and what had transpired between my parents, it certainly colored my relationships with each parent.  I adore my mother and admire her courage in doing something that was not favorably looked upon at the time.  Her concern for her children's safety and her own, led her on the road to becoming a single parent with two small children. While there were times that this path was difficult, she always made sure that my sister and I had everything we needed.  With her support and help, I was able to become the first person in my extended family to graduate from college.  In her 30s, my mother made the decision to pursue her Bachelor of Science degree in Nursing.  She is my role model, my inspiration and she loves me unconditionally.  My father and I, on the other hand, have had an uneasy and torturous relationship.  He was rarely in our lives as children.  When he was, it was usually a quick visit to ply us with gifts.  When I was about 12, he took my sister and me to Disneyland.  I think for my sister, her relationship with my father was completely different as she was too young to remember any of the turbulent past.  I could never forget it.  When he called to speak to us, I always felt uncomfortable.  By the time I was 17, I made the decision to sever all ties with my father.  It was my decision alone and not influenced by any other person.  I will probably never forget the exact instant it happened.  Midstream a telephone conversation, I remember saying 'I don't want to talk to you any more.  Please don't call me.'    It was an emotional experience for me.  I think I understood the word catharsis in one fell swoop.  Yet, it was a strangely liberating experience.  To this day, I've not spoken to or seen him.  One thing I made sure of was that my decision in no way impacted my sister's relationship with our father.  She continues to have a relationship with him.  He visits her and her two children and they all seem to have a fairly good connection.  To his credit, after many years he began to deal with his alcoholism.  But, it has taken a toll on his body and recovery appears to be a road filled with relapses.  I think Christmas always brings some memories of him--mostly bad ones.  I've never regretted the decision I made.  Yet, in many ways throughout my life, there have been unmistakeable imprints of my father in my life.  Even before I realized I was gay, I just knew that I never wanted to be married.  I also told myself that I never wanted to have children.  In college, I was always weary of overindulging in alcohol.  I'm not sure if I thought because he was an alcoholic that there was a chance I could be.  I don't feel the same way about these things now necessarily--but the fact that they had some impact on my life is undeniable.    When I finally came to terms with my homosexuality, of course I went through all questioning.  Was I gay because I lacked a father figure?  Was I gay to spite my father?  Was I gay because I was a mama's boy?  The questions were unending.  All of this now seems so silly.  I know that I am who I am because that was the way it was meant to be.  But the fact, that my father directly or indirectly made me question all of these things about myself just seemed to fuel a hatred.  It's not an easy thing to say that you hate a parent.  Yet, there are sins of a father that are unforgiveable.  Running around doing Christmas shopping, decorating my tree, and preparing for a great holiday, I was reminded of all of these things in the back of my mind.  In spite of all of them, I love Christmas.  With all the negative things that I associate with my father, I think in some strange way he made me appreciate the wonderful simplicities in life.  I love my life.  I love my family and friends.  I'm a better person in spite of the anger I save for my father.  Forgiveness doesn't seem practical--as I can never forget.  But, the silence has taught me so many more things than forgiveness ever could.   WHY YOU SHOULD NEVER SHOP WALMART  A Florida woman who went to an early bird sale to purchase a DVD player for her mother was  urlLink knocked unconscious  and trampled by crazed shoppers.

And that's no choice at all. "  ---Mr. Nathaniel Frank, in his Op-Ed piece for  The New York Times  (11.28) entitled "Why We Need Gays In The Military"

       THE POST-GAME  Why is it that cornbread dressing tastes so much better the day after?  Yes, I just polished off another plate of Thanksgiving leftovers.  I spent the day with my mother, sister and her family.  It was a nice day filled with the customary overindulgence and warmth.  After everyone had their fill of turkey and ham, we spent hours laughing and screaming over ancient video games.  We played PacMan, Rally X and Bosconian.  Even though these precursors are simplistic when compared to the modern-day overloaded graphic eye candy that are video games today--these excercises in hand-eye coordination are no less fun.  Then it was on to ice skating short programs(Cup Of China) on ESPN2.  After everyone left, I settled down to the Trading Spaces marathon on TLC--with pumpkin pie and fresh whipped creme of course.  Sometimes, simplicity is such a good thing.   A BUSH IN IRAQ  If only it were burning.  Between the ghastly amounts spent on security for President Bush's sojourn to Great Britain--and now a 'surprise'  urlLink visit  on Thanksgiving to Iraq, the photo-op happy President proves once again that he and his machine can't pass up another opportunity for material for his next campaign commercial.  Have I mentioned I don't like the President lately?

       WORLD AIDS DAY 2003  December 1st will mark the 16th annual World AIDS Day.  The day will have different significance to different individuals, but a common thread will be the rememberance of 22 million individuals worldwide who have lost their lives to HIV/AIDS.  It's also a day to educate, motivate and mobilize people to be aware of the impact and devastation of AIDS not only one those who have lost their lives--but to those left behind without a loved one.  The Centers For Disease Control (CDC) has estimated that over 42 million people worldwide are infected with HIV, and millions more will be infected by the end of the decade. Approximately 900,000 Americans are living with HIV/AIDS (some of whom don't even know they are infected). In addition, some 40,000 are newly infected with HIV in the United States alone each year.   The statistics are staggering and mind-numbing.  Yet, it is only by continual information, awareness and education that each of us can make our own small difference.  The Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation (with funding from the CDC) has looked at HIV/AIDS infection rates by many different criteria.  One of the most interesting tools they have devised is a state by state  urlLink comparison  of the reporting of AIDS cases.  Their data is complete through December 2001.  As an individual one of the most important and proactive things you can do is have yourself tested for the HIV antibodies.  A recent  urlLink study  by the firm Witeck-Combs Communications/Harris Interactive for the CDC found that most gay men and lesbians have been tested for HIV antibodies.  However, 35% of their sample of gay men and lesbians were unaware of their HIV serostatus.  Conversely, nearly 60% of heterosexuals haven't been tested.   I've made it a practice to have a test done each year when I have my routine physical and blood workup by my physician.  It's not so much that I feel I have put myself in a high-risk situation, but more for my own knowledge and to protect anyone I may have sexual contact with.  It's a duty and responsiblity that I don't take lightly.   QUEER EYE SOUNDTRACK  The theme song to the hit show "Queer Eye For The Straight Guy" has been released commercially for radio and clubplay.  The single "All Things (Just Keep Getting Better)" by Widelife has been remixed by several high-profile DJs.  A video clip shot on the Brooklyn Bridge by director Wayne Isham will soon go to video outlets.  Now comes word that the first  urlLink soundtrack  album to be spawned from the television show will hit store shelves on February 10, 2004.  Entitled "What's That Sound", the album will feature tracks by Elton John, Basement Jaxx, Jamelia, Fischerspooner, Billy Squier, Liz Phair, In-grid and a Chemical Brothers remix of Kylie Minogue's "Slow".  The album, released by Capitol Records,  is the first in a planned series of albums.   HOT LIST  01.

       THE RULES  This weekend I ended up re-watching Roger Avary's " urlLink The Rules of Attraction "--not once, but twice.  I hadn't seen it since the movie was released.  Despite the critical drubbing the film took, I found the film essentially disturbing, affecting and I liked it.  It's now safe to say, that I love the film.  Though Roger Avary's screenplay is a fairly faithful interpretation of Bret Easton Ellis's 1987 book, the film is unique in that it plays within no actual time constraints or the rigidness of sequencing.  The film's characters could exist in the 80s, 90's or present day.  You're not sure if your watching a day, a week, a month.   The characters themselves are shallow and two-dimensional at first glance.  But, upon repeated viewings, you pick up on many non-verbal cues and plot devices woven into Avery's flawless direction.  These little nuances are left for you to find and interpret.  The dynamic at work is want.  Whatever these characters may have in their lives (be it money, people, sex), they are all wanting something else.  It is the yearning in the characters and their circuitous paths toward trying to find satiation of this want that creates a complex dynamic in the film.  Suddenly, the voice-overs and time reversals take on more significance when you know where the characters will ultimately succeed or fail.  The troika of James Van Der Beek, Shannyn Sossamon and Ian Somerhalder are brilliant in their subtle (and often disturbing) portrayals of people who want--and more importantly need.  Though they try alcohol, drugs, and self-affliction, they are never able to find satisfaction.  The movie also never finds a storybook ending for its non-apologetic characters.  By allowing the viewer to draw their own judgements of the characters, Roger Avary has crafted a visually stunning and hauntingly effective film.  If you haven't seen it--or its been awhile since you've seen it--check it out.  Additionally, you can find a complete free downloadable  urlLink screenplay  at Roger Avary's website.  It is quite interesting in the voluminous production shooting notes that are included in the script.  It's available as an Adobe .pdf and well worth viewing.   MISCELLANEOUS NOTES ON THE JACKSON MEDIA FRENZY  01.  Last Thursday when the whole Michael Jackson booking saga took place, I was watching CNN when Jermaine Jackson called in and berated anchor Kyra Phillips.  While Phillips held her own against Jackson's anger, his claims that the actions against his brother were "a modern-day lynching" seem nothing more than inflammatory.  Jackson further went on to say, "my brother is not eccentric" and "I'm sick and fucking tired of people speaking on my brother's behalf and my family's behalf who do not know us".  That his brother is not eccentric is simply laughable.  The fact that most of the Jackson family have put their lives and follies in the public eye leaves them open to the media scrutiny.  By Friday, Jermaine Jackson was being interviewed by Barbara Walters.  Jermaine's protests come off as nothing more than a second-rate singer looking for free publicity.  02.  It's laughable that the Santa Barbara District Attorney sealed the complaint and warrant.  Within two days, the name of the alleged victim, details of the alleged crimes, love notes and other sordid information was plastered all over the internet and most media outlets.  03.  The ridiculous sight of news helicopters trying desperately to catch shots of Michael Jackson's plane, arrival and booking was pathetic.  How this is deemed newsworthy and demanded hours of continuous news coverage is a mystery to me.  Even sadder, is the fact that helicopters followed Jackson's vehicle down the Las Vegas strip upon his return.  I suddenly had flashbacks of O.J. Simpson's white Bronco.  04.  This morning, there if an "official" statement on Mr. Jackson's  urlLink website  claiming that the charges are "predicated on a big lie".  05.  Someone needs to tell Gloria Allred to get a life.  First, she hooks up with Amber Frey.  Now, she's leading a crusade to have Jackson's children removed from his custody.  Here I thought Mark Geragos was a first-class media whore.  It seems he has competition.  06.  That mugshot.  That scary resemblance to Joan Crawford.  That horrific make-up.  This is a movie right?  07.  CBS has once again proved they have no backbone.  Weaseling out of airing their Michael Jackson special (after cancelling the airing of "The Reagans") is a sad statement on the intertwining of the network's entertainment and news divisions.  Further, it appears CBS nor Ms. Allred have heard of the phrase "innocent until proven guilty"?   FAVORITE RECENT CD REVIEW  " All the while, Ms. Spears works hard to prove that she's hot-blooded, although she sounds colder than ever. The album is almost perversely devoid of personality -- a final act of rebellion, perhaps, against the music industry. Ms. Spears will cobble together an album, if she absolutely has to, but don't think she's going to get all personal. That's what television specials are for. "---Kalefa Sanneh, Arts/Culture Desk Reviewer  The New York Times    SIMON COWELL  As part of the publicity blitz for his new book, " urlLink I Don't Mean to Be Rude, But... " (in stores December 2nd), Simon Cowell gave an  urlLink interview  to  Billboard's  Carla Hay.  Cowell has some interesting comments on the state of music and the "American Idol" phenomenon.  Among his assertions is that Madonna is "over" and "desperate", Britney Spears was "never sexy", Beyonce and J.Lo have "the X-Factor" and Clay Aiken "is the best thing to happen to 'American Idol'".  That cheeky Simon.   BABYSITTING 101  I spent most of my weekend babysitting my niece and nephew.  At ages 11 and 8, to say they left me exhausted and ragged would be an understatement--though I love them dearly.  I also learned more about  urlLink Yu-Gi-Oh!  than any gay man should EVER know.

       GIFTS....FOR ME  I usually like to try and get all of my holiday shopping done early to avoid the madness of the last-minute mall mobs.  In the past several years, I've found myself shopping on-line for a lot of my gifts.  While there are certain perks to in-store shopping, there's a lot to be said for staying in bed and shopping in your underwear.  Alas, there are some items that just don't lend themselves to shopping at home.  Yesterday, I made my first mall crawl and started ticking people off my list.  The truth be told, I love to shop.  There's a certain unexplicable chemical reaction that happens in my body.  A strange cocktail of adrenaline and serotonin that fuels a rush to spend money.  If someone could figure a way to bottle that energy, there would be addicts across the globe.  Shopping is good for you.  Especially when you can't help but pick up a few things for yourself.  Afterall, the spirit of giving should apply to purchaser as well.  Or at least, that's what I tell myself.  While trolling for gifts, I  had  to stop and pick up some new music.  Among my purchases:  -- urlLink "Afterglow" --Sarah McLachlan -- urlLink "At Last" --Cyndi Lauper -- urlLink "Tales of a Librarian: A Tori Amos Collection" --Tori Amos -- urlLink "Motown" --Michael McDonald  I also purchased the new concert DVDs by Coldplay (" urlLink Coldplay - Live 2003 ") and Linkin Park (" urlLink Live in Texas "), a very colorful sweater and a funky pendant lamp.   PAGING DR. ROMANO  (*spoiler alert*)  I'll be the first one to admit that I love to hate Dr. Romano (played by Paul McCrane) on " urlLink ER ".  But, I don't think I could have imagined the cruel irony that would await the character in last night's episode entitled "Freefall".  Romano, who lost his arm last season in a freak accident with a helicopter tail rotor, apparently was not meant to be near helicopters.  In a wonderfully tense and well-written episode, a helicopter crashed on take-off from the hospital's helipad and tumbled off the side of the building and exploded in the emergency room entrance bay.  Oh, did I mention it apparently fell on top of Dr. Romano? Yikes!

       LA LEWINSKY  I'm not sure which is more disturbing:  the fact that Ms. Lewinsky can still  urlLink garner  major press or the descriptions of her social life.  In a December  GQ  interview, Ms. Lewinsky makes the shocking revelation that her White House liaison is a liability on the dating scene. No! Really?  Ms. Lewinsky bemoans the fact that while she dates occasionally--her romantic relationships have been short-lived.  Maybe her beaus are afraid she'll save another piece of clothing?  Linda, are you writing this all down?   THE KING OF ?  Speaking of  Les Liaisons Dangereuses , looks like Wacko Jacko is up to his eyeliner in  urlLink trouble  and tabloid press.  After Martin Bashir's pseudo-documentary detailing Michael Jackson's peculiar sleeping habits, is it really that much of surprise that he finds himself confronted with child molestation charges?  Whether Jackson is guilty or innocent, he really only has himself (and his bizarre behavior) for painting a target on his back.  I did find the press conference yesterday to be quite a stunning show of ego on the part of Santa Barbara District Attorney Tom Sneddon.  This is going to be off the bizarre meter.   BUSH & THE AARP  Am I the only one that finds it incredible that the  urlLink AARP  is actually supporting the Bush Administration's pathetic attempt at a Medicare prescription drug bill?  They are already running commercials showing their support--while at the same time claiming "it isn't perfect, but...".  By pushing reform that encourages private companies to create new preferred provider organizations,  the Republicans hope that seniors would select them over the traditional system under Medicare.  Meanwhile, the very purpose of Medicare--a standard benefit at a uniform price--is totally thrown in jeopardy.  With the proposed reform, more seniors will end up either not having adequate medical services or not be able to afford them.    QUICKTAKES  01.  No Doubt's video clip for their cover of Talk Talk's " urlLink It's My Life " is awash in color and tongue-in-cheek humor.  Directed by the brilliant David LaChapelle, the circa 1930's clip worships Gwen Stefani's Harlowesque beauty. 02.  Mark Geragos.  Legal Eagle or Whore? Discuss. 03.  I'm fascinated by the WTC Memorial submission by the team of Gisela Baurmann, Jonas Coursmeier and Sawad Brooks entitled " urlLink Passages of Light: Memorial Cloud ".  It's such a unique and mesmerizing idea.

       MASSACHUSETTS & MARRIAGE  The Supreme Court of Massachusetts set in motion a number of probabilities with their 4-3  urlLink decision  Tuesday on the issue of gay marriage.  At first glance, it would seem to be a resounding victory for the seven same-sex couples who sued for the right to marry under Massachusetts state law--and it is.  But, it is in the ripple effects that this ruling will have in the debate between factions for and against gay marriage--and the bigger issue of acceptance of homosexuality as a country--that the greater victories are to be had.  In their decision, the Justice's majority opinion states the following:  01.  " The question before us is whether, consistent with the Massachusetts Constitution, the commonwealth may deny the protections, benefits, and obligations conferred by civil marriage to two individuals of the same sex who wish to marry," according to the majority opinion. "We conclude that it may not. "    02.  " [Denying gay couples the right to marry] is incompatible with the constitutional principles of respect for individual autonomy and equality under law. "    03.  " Whether and whom to marry, how to express sexual intimacy, and whether and how to establish a family -- these are among the most basic of every individual's liberty and due process rights--and central to personal freedom and security is the assurance that the laws will apply equally to persons in similar situations.  "  04.  " Barred access to the protections, benefits and obligations of civil marriage, a person who enters into an intimate, exclusive union with another of the same sex is arbitrarily deprived of membership in one of our community's most rewarding and cherished institutions. "  While the governor and many political leaders have decried the outcome, the court's ruling does impact Massachusetts in several ways.  The state legislature  is given six months to rewrite the state's marriage laws for the benefit of gay couples.  While it is very likely that a constitutional ammendment will be sought to overturn the ruling, such an effort could not be voted upon by Massachusetts citizens until 2006.  Therefore, the legistaure could write law legalizing same-sex marriage or it could do nothing and let the court's ruling go into effect.  Outside of Massachusetts there is the likelihood of a Supreme Court challenge to the ruling, as well as continued pressure by President Bush and Congress to limit the definition of marriage to a man and woman.  Particularly intersting about the wording of the Massachusetts ruling is the fact that some legal scholars believe the ruling applies strictly to marriage and that creating a separate class of domestic union--such as civil unions--would not be acceptable.  This, of course, would differentiate the ruling from the Vermont case that resulted in the adoption of civil unions.   MARRIAGE & ME  While I've never had a particularly strong opinion one way or the other on the issue of gay marriage, I have always maintained that two people who wish to commit to marriage should have the right to do so.  Unfortunately, many times the issue of marriage is so deeply rooted with religious beliefs that it is hard to separate the legal definition--and the rights that come with it--from the idea of the religious definition.    I've never understood the argument that same-sex marriage would "undermine" the institution of marriage.  As each marriage is a separate entity unto itself, I'm not sure I see the logic.  If heterosexual couples choose to have an open marriage, commit adultery or divorce--are they undermining the institution and religious law of marriage.  If they are, why is no one outraged by this?  The fact is that in today's society, the act of sex is separate from the act of marriage.  You can no longer fairly argue that marriage is sacrosanct to having children.   Whether a person or government chooses to recognize the committment of two loving individuals, you have to make a case that is fair and just for that union to not receive the benefits and protections offered to every other union of heterosexual individuals.  In the end, it becomes a question of fairness, dignity and justice.  While it is my desire to find a relationship based on a long-term committment, I'm not sure that I personally would ever need the validation of using the word marriage to describe my love and union.  Yet, I do see all of the practical issues that same-sex marriage advocates fight for:  the right to make medical decisions, the right to military benefits, the right to beneficiary of insurances and retirements, et.al.  So many rights that are given simply by virture of engaging in heterosexual union and finding recognition in law.  In that respect, the rights of marriage should be afforded to persons of any sexual orientation.  Make no doubt that a fight has been won.  But, the battle is far from over.   ISN'T IT IRONIC?  01.  Michael Jackson.  Allegations of child molestation.  Release date of greatest hits album. 02.  George W. Bush in England.  Still making speeches that the war in Iraq is "necessary" and "justified". 03.  Paris Hilton.  Socialite.  Sex video scandal. Fox television show premiere. 04.  George Michael.  Accuses Sony Music of slavery. Goes to court and loses.  Signs new contract--with Sony Music.

       THE MAYOR'S MOUTHFUL  The Mayor of London, Ken Livingstone, has a few  urlLink words  to say about President Bush's upcoming visit.  Livingstone, who visited the United States earlier this year,  aroused the ire of many conservatives by calling the current administration " the most corrupt and racist American administration in over 80 years ".  Amid the ridiculous scope of security precautions being taken for Bush's visit, Livingstone is one of the highest-ranking officials to level blazing criticism at the U.S. President.  On the eve of the Bush visit, Livingstone has been quoted in the U.K. press as saying, " Some U.S. journalist came up to me and said: 'How can you say this about President Bush?'  Well, I think what I said then was quite mild. I actually think that Bush is the greatest threat to life on this planet that we've most probably ever seen. The policies he is initiating will doom us to extinction. "   In response to the visit, Mr. Livingstone is organizing a "peace party" at London's City Hall.  Of the protest, Livingstone says, " I don't formally recognise George Bush because he was not officially elected. So we are organising an alternative reception for everybody who is not George Bush. "  Bravo,  Mr. Livingstone! Bravo!   GEST v. MINNELLI, ROUND 2  On the heels of David Gest's $10 million dollar lawsuit--in which he claims among other things that Minnelli beat him--comes a response from the Minnelli camp in the form of a  urlLink countersuit .  Asking for $2 million dollars, Liza's lawyers have detailed charges accusing him of stealing money from her, insulting her publicly and trying to fire members of her staff who questioned his practices.  Part of the suit claims Gest began displaying diva-esque traits, "holding himself out as the 'star.'"   Diva-esque?  Me thinks the problem is more like "Homo-esque".   APPLES & ORANGES  While supposedly working yesterday morning, I was wasting my time participating in that ever-popular sport of channel surfing.  In the spirit of scientific experimentation, I was going back and forth between CNN, MSNBC, and FOX news channels.  While the breaking news on CNN and MSNBC was the verdict of the John Allen Muhammad trial and its dissection, FOX treated its viewers to live coverage of Rush Limbaugh's return to radio after a quickie stint in rehab.  I'm sure that this proves some significiant hypothesis of human nature.  However, I was too busy watching Jerry Springer to figure out the ramifications.   SOLE INFATUATION  I'm not a boot person.  However, hoping to contribute to an upturn in the economy, I've succumbed to these "Tricky Thick" boots from Kenneth Cole.  Next stop, the pursuit of hedonism.

       MAJOR COMBAT OPERATIONS OVER?  Since that infamous speech aboard the aircraft carrier, I think it's safe to assume that announcement was premature--if nothing else.  In recent days, U.S. military forces have carried out major offensives with ominous code names such as "Operation Iron Hammer" and " urlLink Operation Ivy Cyclone ".  With the escalating death toll of soldiers in the month of November and an Associated Press  report that estimates that 3,240 civilian Iraqis have died between March 20 and April 20 (a figure based on data from only  half  of Iraq's hospitals), one can infer that things are not as positive as the White House would like us to believe.  The collison of two Army Black Hawk helicopters over the weekend killed 17 soldiers near Mosul.  The deaths brought to 420 the number of American troops killed in the Iraq war, 281 of them since Bush declared the end of major combat operations.   As this bloody backdrop plays on, the White House has now put its political muscle behind a proposal to form a provisional government in Iraq by June 2004. The transfer of power would provide President Bush a strategy to pull out U.S. troops as guerrilla warfare escalates.  The timing of this new strategy seems a bit alarming and precarious.  Meanwhile, President Bush during an  urlLink interview  with David Frost on the PBS/BBC program "Breakfast With David Frost" made the following dubious statement:  " We did the Iraqi people a great favor by removing him, and so I wouldn't be surprised that any kind of violence is promoted by him, but I don't know. "  Wow, I feel bettter.   BUSH, PART DEUX  After I finished reading this, I wasn't sure whether to laugh or cry:  urlLink Just So You Know    THE COLOR OF MONEY  This weekend I happened to catch a television commercial "promoting" the new $20 bill.  I immediately thought, "I can't believe the government has nothing better to spend its twenty dollar bills on".  Later that same day, I came across a two page spread in a magazine entitled "How To Read The New $20 Bill".  There's even a  urlLink website  devoted to the "new" $20 bill.  I would make some smart comment about the government wasting money, but apparently I'm too dumb to understand the intricacies of the new improved money.   THE BLOG KING  There's an impressive  urlLink piece  in today's  The New York Times  profiling the president of Gawker Media, Nick Denton.  The piece not only mentions  urlLink Gawker , but the newly launched and wildly popular  urlLink Fleshbot .  It also details Mr. Denton's next incarnation--Kinja.

       A NEW DAY IN LOUISIANA  Lt. Governor Kathleen Babineaux Blanco  urlLink becomes  the first woman in Louisiana to assume the top helm in a hotly-contested gubernatorial run-off election.  Blanco, who had trailed in most polls, pulled 52% of the vote to 48% by her opposition Bobby Jindal.  In a spate of recent loses for the Democratic party in the South, Blanco's win was an important one.  Though Jindal picked up the endorsement of New Orleans Mayor Ray Nagin (who is a Democrat), the move apparently failed to help Jindal.  Blanco picked up the majority vote in her native Acadiana, as well as carrying New Orleans.  In recent weeks, Nagin's endorsement of Jindal had created quite a stir within the vibrant GLBT community in New Orleans.  Shortly after Nagin's announcement, all seven members of the governor's Advisory Committee on Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual and Transgender Issues  urlLink resigned  in protest.  The mayor's endorsement of the conservative Jindal was called "unconscionable and incomprehensible" by committee members.   CAREER ACHIEVEMENT  On Friday night, actress Nicole Kidman was  urlLink presented  with the Career Achievement Award at the 18th Annual American Cinematheque Award.  The 36 year-old actress was honored for her contributions to film.  Coming off last year's Best Actress Oscar for "The Hours", Kidman looks poised to be in the running once again with a troika of brilliant performances in " urlLink The Human Stain " and the upcoming " urlLink Cold Mountain " and " urlLink Dogville ".    FEFE DOBSON  I had a chance to preview a few tracks from 18 year-old Canadian  urlLink Fefe Dobson's  upcoming debut album this weekend.  The first single "Take Me Away" is receiving heavy rotation video play and is starting to break at radio.  She an intriguing combination of rocker chick with soul, pop, and dance influences.  I'm curious to see how her music is received in the States.  Her eponymous debut drops December 9th on Island Records.  Meanwhile, you can hear two tracks on her website.

       THE SKY IS FALLING  It's been an interesting couple of days in New Mexico.  The northern part of the state has been blanketed in snow.  I live in the southern part of the state and we've had a drizzling rain.  It's been months since we've had any appreciable amount of moisture.  The temperatures have finally begun sliding down the thermometer.  There is a brisk chill on the morning's arrival.   I've always loved dark, grey, overcast days.  Most people hate them and think I'm weird for liking this kind of weather.  There's something very appealing to the writer in me about the brooding mysteriousness of overcast days.  They seem to inspire me and get my creative juices flowing.  I even get a little kick of extra energy from the vibe.  Maybe it is strange--but I love days like this.    Sitting in front of a picture window watching clouds roll by, hearing thunder rumble and watching rain droplets intermittently splat against the glass, I seem to be dwarfed by the massiveness of Mother Nature.  The sights and smells are so invading and refreshing.  I am warm on the inside.

       CASUALTIES OF WAR  As of November 13, 2003, there have been 471 troop casualties in coalition forces fighting in Iraq.  The breakdown:  401 Americans, 53 British, 16 Italians and one Polish.  CNN has posted a  urlLink roster  that is continually updated upon family notifications.  It's heartbreaking to see all those faces and read about the situations in which they were killed.  Note that this figure does not include the fatalities of opposition forces, innocent civilians and citizens.  Nor does it reflect injuries.   SENATE THEATRICS--TAPE AT 6:02  From the much ado about nothing department is the continuing 'debate' in the U.S. Senate regarding President Bush's proposed judicial appointments.  The three-ring circus included rolling beds, boisterous pontificating and a senator carrying a "I'll be home watching 'The Bachelor'" placard.    In a show of great contempt for the political process, a  urlLink memo  from Elizabeth Keys, a senior communications advisor for the Senate Republican Conference was circulated, which in part read:  " It is important to double efforts to get your boss to S-230 on time ... Fox News Channel is really excited about this marathon and Brit Hume at 6 would love to open with all our 51 senators walking onto the floor -- the producer wants to know will we walk in exactly at 6:02 when the show starts so they get it live to open Brit Hume's show? Or if not, can we give them an exact time for the walk-in start? "  How pathetic is it that Fox News is now choreographing the "news".  Even more astounding is the Republican leadership's decision to allow a supposed "show of unity" to become a photo op.  The need for Americans to exercise their right to vote is more urgent than ever before.   PICTURE THIS  On Thursday, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts & Sciences  urlLink unveiled  the poster for the 76th Academy Awards.  The wonderfully vibrant image by pop artist Burton Morris has a decidely retro feel and comic book look.  It's very different than the traditional Academy fare.  Great Stuff!   WORLD IDOL    urlLink Broadcasting & Cable   is reporting that Idols from countries around the world--including original U.S. winner Kelly Clarkson--will compete in a two-part competition for the title of "World Idol".  The competition is set to begin on Christmas Day and conclude on New Year's Day 2004.

       CATHOLICISM & THE GAY MAN  I was raised in a devout Roman Catholc family.  As a child, I was never sure what "devout" actually meant in the context of religion.  As an adult, I'm still not really sure if I do.  I do know that as a child, my family would attend church services weekly.  I was baptized and confirmed in the Catholic Church.  I attended catechism classes and went through a communion ceremony.  I detested the act of confession, but participated rather frequently.  I guess in some ways you could say that I was taught to believe in God.  I've always wondered how much of any organized religion is based on indoctrination.  Further, I think I've reached a conclusion that spirituality and organized religion are not the same thing.  Just like growing up, I look at my own spirituality as a journey--perhaps a never-ending one.  But, my relationship with the organized Roman Catholic Church came to an end when I was a freshman in high school.  To say I caused a scandal in my extended family would be an understatement.  It just was not acceptable.  Of course, my problems with the Catholic Church began about the same time I began to face my sexual identity.  But, to say that was the only issue that drove me away from the church would not be a fair characterization either.  As I began maturing as a person, I began to see what I perceived as faulty logic in the teachings of the Church.  I began to question a religion that told me I was unacceptable as a homosexual. I didn't agree with the Church's stand on abortion, birth control, divorce, confession and a host of other issues.  In college that gap just grew further.  I took a course entitled "The New Testament As Literature".  It opened my eyes to a whole new world of interpretation and questioning.  In the end I was left with two undeniable truths defining my own spirituality.  I did--and do--believe in a God.  I further kept one tenet of my religious education close to my heart:  God is all-knowing. God is all-loving. God is all-forgiving.  If God was indeed all-knowing, then why did I have to confess my sins to another human?  If God was all-loving, how could he hate me for being homosexual?  If God is all-forgiving, then how could so many things be considered sins?  Now, I realize this is an over-simplistic model and I could probably write a dissertation on the reasons I came to these conclusions and how they affected/defined my spirituality.  But, it does serve as a tangible reference point to some of the questions that led me away from the Church.   In the end, I realized what a powerful force guilt was--and how effectively it was used as a tool by the Church to keep it's faithful in line.  I also realized that (as some have argued) that if I am guilty of selectivity when it comes to my religion and my beliefs--it is no different than how any organized religion uses its texts and figures to interpret a single meaning of a religion.  I tried attending services in several other faiths looking for a place to "fit in".  Nothing ever seemed comfortable.  In my mind, it became a question of faith in the literal sense.  Even though I am not a practicing Catholic, I do consider myself one.  That my so-called Church will not accept me is an interesting and troubling paradox.  Yet, religion and spirituality are concepts that are boundless and do not need be confined to one house of worship.  I may have lost my Church, but I did not lose my religion. ------------------------------------  When I went to do today's entry, religion was not going to be the topic.  However, two interesting and thought-provoking articles sort of coaxed me there.  I know that religion is a very private matter and and issue of great controversy.  I actually never thought it would be a topic addressed in this forum.  But, these are my personal viewpoints. I was also not my intent to offend anyone.  My thoughts after reading these two articles shaped this entry.

       THEY'RE NOT LOVIN' IT  The corporate bigwigs at McDonalds were less than McLoving the fact that the word "McJob"  urlLink appears  in the Eleventh Edition of "Merriam-Webster Dictionary".  McJob is defined as "a low-paying job that requires little skill and provides little opportunity for advancement."  McDonald's CEO, Jim Cantalupo, sent an open letter to Merriam-Webster (via e-mail to media outlets) saying among other things that the term is "an inaccurate description of restaurant employment" and "a slap in the face to the 12 million men and women [who work in the restaurant industry]."  On Tuesday, the dictionary publisher said that it "stands by the accuracy and appropriateness" of its definition.  The company also cited references that show "McJob" being used in a variety of publications over a seventeen year period, including  The New York Times  and  Rolling Stone .    MONEY & MURDER  I happened to be watching CNN when they went to live coverage of the  urlLink verdict  reading in the trial of accused murderer Robert Durst.  Watching Mr. Durst's obvious relief when the "not guilty" verdict was read was an exercise in disgust.  Mr. Durst admitted in open court that he had shot his neighbor (he's not sure if it was an accident or in self-defense), panicked, dismembered his body and disposed of it in the Galveston Bay.  Not guilty?  In some of the remarkable comments that jurors made to the media, they claimed the fact that Mr. Durst had dismembered Mr. Black's body was "irrelevant".   Another juror made the follwing assertions:  "I could understand Durst's panic.  I can understand his drug-induced state. I can understand his life."  Too bad, they apparently didn't understand Mr. Black's death or Mr. Durst's strange and twisted past.  It's amazing and revolting that in this day and age, money can still purchase justice.   BOMBS OVER BAGHDAD  Is it my imagination--or has each day seen more and more aggression from the "opposition forces" in Iraq.  There have been so many explosions in recent days, that I have lost count.  Watching "News Night With Aaron Brown" becomes painful when they run their traditional service obituaries each night. It is truly a sad state of affairs.  In a related matter, there is an amazing  urlLink video clip  floating around the internet produced by the mysterious blogger "Salam Pax".  In addition to giving a personal face to "Pax", the nearly twelve-minute piece is thought-provoking and an interesting look at the current state of affairs in Iraq through the eyes of a citizen.

       A WORK IN PROGRESS  " I don't want my life to begin and end with being gay. "  This marvelous line comes from an Australian film entitled " urlLink The Sum of Us ". That screenplay, and the original stage play upon which it was based, were written by David Stevens. The thing about this line is that it didn't hit me until my fourth or fifth viewing of the film. But then suddenly, I was witnessing my spiritual twin (the character of Jeff) on the screen uttering that line to his father in response to queries about what he wanted out his life. He'd just finished telling his father that falling in love wasn't easy and that he didn't want being a gay man to just be about sexual experiences. He enjoyed the company of children, elderly people, women....and wanted them all in his life. It's not all about walking through life with your penis in your hand.  For me, the discovery I was a gay man--.from the very outset--was always more than just a sexual identification or experience. Yes, it served as a frame of reference that would come to color the way the world and other people look at me. It also served as a lightning rod for my own expectations of what I wanted to accomplish with my life.  What I needed--and selfishly, what I wanted. I am now proud to say that I am a gay man.  Sadly, this was not always the case. In a world that is so filled with diversity and change, society at large still cherishes "sameness" and lives with conformity and status quo as comfort measures. I wonder if being "different", or being gay, will ever be easier? It is my sincere hope that for generations yet to come it will be.  In fairness, my lifetime is much easier than those that came before me. But we live in times where people still frown on the color of skin, fear the threat of the unknown or uncomfortable. We plot our lives over fields laced with ethnocentricity, predjudice, hate, war, and fear...and yet somehow, mankind continues forth. At times learning from our mistakes and in others settling to repeat them.  So, my life is not about being gay. Being gay is a part of my life. It is something that defines part of who I am and what I want. It wasn't a choice--just merely who I am. I intend to live my life as such. Again, this is the viewpoint that my experiences have brought me to. Some will agree and others will not. But for me, this is the essence of who I am.  The man I want to be. Yes, being gay can (and should be) an 'issue' to be politicized. But, just like any other minority group (be it of racial, sexual, political, or religious orientation), I have no more or no less right than any other to expect certain basic human rights. Unfortunately, our society is not there yet.   However,  I must live my life as my conscience, heart, and free will dictate. Every man, woman and child should have the same precious gift.  So do I consider myself an activist? Aah...there's a loaded word. Truthfully, I'm not sure. What I do know is that the experiences I went through--the lack of support, and the lack of an outlet to know what I felt and desired were okay--changed my life forever. Okay--a damned simple word. Okay. I am okay. You are okay. Gay is okay. Simple sentences based on concepts.  Concepts that societal programming, family, morality, religion, mental health, and the uneducated voices will have us believe are the exact opposite of the unequivocal truth.   So I'm not sure it is so much activism that pushes and drives an inner purpose in me. Mainly, it is the fact that I want to lead by example. To teach others who will walk in my shoes.  With equal respect, to be an example of a proud gay man for those who will trample on these worn shoes each step of the way. Instead of repeating disabling cycles that eventually claim the human soul, history should teach us the good and bad. It should also enable us to grow. In the end, it should teach us human acceptance and dignity. Human hope and tolerance. After all, what is this world but the sum of its parts.....the sum of us.  As I re-read the last paragraph, I thought to myself 'nice words....but...'. Maybe there is just a bit of innocence in those words? Maybe a tad too much faith in humankind? Maybe a bit too much self-righteous morality? In the end, I always reach the same conclusion when searching for the meaning in those words. Is that such a bad thing to believe that those words can be true? I believe that we live in a world that has proven time and again that we are a product of our own making. We certainly are influenced by others and forces around us. Perhaps we've come to rely on these influences as an excuse for our behavior? If we were to live our lives by heartfelt convictions and similar actions, then we lead by example instead of mimicry. Maybe then we have lived for a reason.  It is my belief that no man or woman is perfect. Life and living are about growth and expansion.  Fueled by knowledge gathered by our collective experience. I still find myself plagued at times by doubt and misinformed predjudices. It would be much easier for me to take that baggage with me to my grave than to try and find the folly of my ways. To err is human.  To accept error and take corrective action is not always humane. Until my last breath, I shall always be a work in progres.   THESE SOUNDS FALL INTO MY MIND  01.

I'M JUST SAYING  Amercian Heritage Dictionary's secondary definition of the word prostitution is " The act or an instance of offering or devoting one's talent to an unworthy use or cause ".

       EPISODE 7: PRELUDE  How totally kick-ass was last night's  urlLink "ALIAS" ?  Wow!  This season the show has really hit its stride. The acting is top-notch and the writing is engaging.  That opening scene with Sydney pulling the plastic tubing out from the mysterious scar on her abdomen was a shock--and terrifically done.  I know I've said it before, but I loves me some Jennifer Garner.  Now, Ms. Lauren Reed (Melissa George)--how much do I hate her?  It was a brilliant plot device to marry off Vaughn, but damn is this chick a witch or what?  Now to have to wait two weeks for the next episode...   BI-LINE: PRINCE CHARLES  So after issuing a stern denial through his press secretary to something that could not be spoken of in public, Prince Charles became fodder for internet junkies everywhere over the weekend.  Soon after the denial was issued, it was a media frenzy.  By the weekend, at least two Italian newspapers printed details of the allegations and named names.  The big  urlLink secret ?  An ex-royal servant claims he was raped by the prince's personal secretary (who is a male).  Further, he claims that he interrupted said rapist and the Prince in bed together.  Now, gossip whores are clamoring that Prince Charles could be bisexual.  Imagine that? Who'd have guessed? Yeah, right.    Things are going to get ugly.   A NEW PIECE  Here are a couple of shots of a new mixed-media collage that I completed this weekend.  The piece is triple coat decoupage with an acrylic overlay.  It is entitled "Cravings".           QUOTE OF THE DAY  " It makes no more sense to launch an assault on our civil liberties as the best way to get at terrorists than it did to launch an invasion of Iraq as the best way to get at Osama bin Laden. "---former Vice-President Al Gore   AVAIL  I keep replaying I keep resaying I try repraying To no avail  Nothing to do Nothing to explain No hope I'll stay No avail  It's all about freedom Overcoming egos Slaying platitudes ...and mostly it's about me What I can do to be free How I can learn to love me Avail

       GIRL FIGHT!  Seems like there was a bit of backstage drama at the recent European MTV Awards which were hosted by Ms. Christina Aguilera.  Seems that singer Pink and Aguilera are having a war of words in the British tabloids.  Pink, who closed the show with her new single "Trouble", is said to have  urlLink threatened  not to perform on the show if Christina dared to introduce her.  In the end, the record label was forced to hire a separate radio DJ to introduce Miss Pink.  It seems Ms. Aguilera has accused Ms. Pink of "copying" her look and style.  Meanwhile, Ms. Pink has been quoted as saying, " If that bitch mentions my name once I’m not going on stage—and I’m not kidding. ” *MEOW*  My money is on Xtina by knockout in the 3rd round.   SOME SLOW KYLIE  Take a gander at the new videoclip for Kylie Minogue's  urlLink "Slow" .  The opening shot is breathtaking.  This video has enough scantily clad beef to have a barbeque for days.  The song is a nice, slow percolating ode to take-your-time sex. Yummy!

       CONTINUING SIGNS OF THE APOCALYPSE--CHAPTER 9  Who's dumb now?  After Jessica Simpson became a national symbol of the stereotypical "dumb blonde" in her MTV series "Newlyweds", the tuna queen has now  urlLink landed  a sitcom development deal with ABC.  Can you imagine?  What could be funnier than her "real-life" ponderances on MTV?  Someone better call the Nielsen people now--because there's gonna be a  HIT  coming to primetime.   IT'S A GOOD THING  First, full disclosure:  I like Martha Stewart.  That being said, her hour-long  urlLink sitdown  with Barbara Walters was a compelling interview.  You have to give Ms. Walters credit for not lobbing a bunch of softballs at the doyenne of good living.  She asked the hard--at times nearly bordering on rude--questions.  I thought Ms. Stewart handled herself brilliantly.  It's still amazing to me, that the Secruties & Exchange Commission and the Federal Government have nothing better to do than chase around Martha for a $40,000 stock deal.  I mean the woman  was  a Billionaire!  I'm not really sure why--as Barbara asked her--so many people hate her.  I think she's a pretty cool chick.   SAVING JESSICA LYNCH  I have no plans to watch this docudrama.  But, I have to smirk when I read press reports of Ms. Lynch  urlLink saying  the U.S. military played up her rescue too much.  Questioned about her dramatic (filmed) nighttime rescue, Lynch is quoted as saying, " Yeah, I don't think it happened quite like that. "  You've got figure that's chapping someone's ass.  Curiously enough, an unnamed (aren't they all?) senior military official is on record to CNN basically saying that it was not their fault.  Said unnamed source denied that the military ever exaggerated the rescue. Inaccuracies in reports of Lynch's ordeal were the fault of the media, which reported the story with incomplete information.  Uh-Hummm....   VANITY FAIR-Y  I love   urlLink Vanity Fair   magazine.  In addition to great writing, they always have some spectacular photography.  The December 2003 issue has a cover story entitled "TV's Gay Heat Wave!".  The photographs of cast members of "Will & Grace", "Queer As Folk", "Queer Eye For The Straight Guy", "Boy Meets Boy" and "The L Word" are truly provacative and beautiful.  It's definitely a collector's keeper.   QUOTE OF THE WEEK  " "That's why I want to make it entirely clear, even though I can't refer to the specifics of the allegation, that it is totally untrue and without a shred of substance. "---Sir Michael Peat, Prince Charles's private secretary denying that scandal no one can talk about.   SWISS FAMILY ROBINSON  Last night, the Hallmark Channel showed that Disney chestnut "Swiss Family Robinson".  It's been years since I've seen the film--and it was great, cheesy fun.  Those pirates crack me up!

       THE COLOR OF GREEN  I'm finally at the point where I am actually looking forward to redecorating my bedroom.  To say my bedroom is large would be an understatement.  It seems I spend a lot of my time in that part of the house.  It's become a place where sleep is a secondary issue.  I watch television, listen to music and work there.  It's definitely a comfort thing.  Part of the problem in beginning this project is that I just have too much "stuff".  Nonetheless, I finally decided to tackle the project head-on.   The first order of business was to pick a new wall color.  My walls are textured stucco and have been a light golden sand color for much too long.  I've decided to rip out a closet, change the flooring, and add new shelving--but the one thing that was holding everything up was my indecision in picking a new color.  Who knew there were 50,000 paint manufacturers who produce 750,000 shades or variations on a color.  I kid you not, I've spent hours with palettes and swatches going through colors.  I decided I wanted a radical change.  So the light walls, dark floors and black furniture have got to go.  From the get go, I wanted a dark wall color.  I may regret it when it's all said and done, but I'm going with it.  I've chosen a color called "pinetop green", which is a very deep, dark green.  The ceiling will be done in a color called "mint julep".   The colors look very complimentary--at least on paper.  In between all the trips to home improvement stores, I've been looking at furniture.  I'm keeping the platform king-size bed and a custom-made ceramic tile desk I have now.  But, I'm leaning toward cherry as a wood choice for new furnishings.  Actually, "leaning toward" would be the wrong phrase as I've already purchased a beautiful ten drawer taboret in cherry wood with some great art deco antiqued brass hardware.  I saw it and had to have it.  Yeah, I'm weak like that.

       THE ALPHABET SOUP OF SEX   "... Boys lean out the windows of pickup trucks yelling 'Dyke!' or 'Queer!' ... But instead of being frightened, I simply say, 'Thanks!"---Stacy Harbaugh, program coordinator for the Indiana Youth Group   There is an interesting piece written for the Associated Press entitled  urlLink "The Evolution Of 'Queer'"  that is being picked up by many media outlets.  The basic premise of the article is that the word "queer" has been been transformed from an anti-gay slur into a mainstream and hip term to refer to any sexual orientation beyond straight.  The article also delves into the issue of why the use of the word is still 'uncomfortable' in gay-straight conversation.  It's interesting that the spectrum of sexuality has been filtered so widely to include terms like "queer-eyed straight guys", "heteroflexible",  "omnisexual" and  "pansexual".    LIKE A SIEVE  It's time for another  urlLink scandal  in the hallowed halls of Congress.  On Wednesday, a Democratic staff memo vowing to expose what it said were the Bush administration's "misleading, if not flagrantly dishonest, methods and motives" in making the case for war in Iraq was leaked to the media.   The leak started the requisite finger-pointing between political parties.  I'm not sure why people are so shocked that such a memo would exist?  One thing I am sure of is that between the White House and Congress, there are more leaks in Washington than in a urinal.  Wait, I may be on to something here...   ROCK THE VOTE  I watched the "America Rocks The Vote" candidate forum twice.  While the questions ranged from insipid to redundant, there were several exchanges that led to some interesting dialog.  It was not a stellar night for Howard Dean.  Lieberman and Kerry seem to continue to come off stodgy and old-school.  Sharpton and Mosley-Braun had some great lines, but I think fall short on substance.  Edwards is interesting and likeable, but probably lacking the requisite experience.  Wesley Clark came across very well.  He gave impassioned answers, but avoid the bluster of some candidates.  He seems keen on showcasing the differences between himself and the others (right down to wardrobe choice).  I think he continues to be the front-runner.  I must say that I rather like Kucinich.  If I had to pick a "winner" of the "debate", he would probably be the one.  He surprised me with his steadfast views and obvious passion.  I just don't think he's a viable candidate to go against Bush.   THUMBS DOWN  01.  I love Madonna.  But, what the hell is that writhing she's doing on the floor in Ms. Spears latest video "Me Against The Music"? Ewww.  Oh and p.s., I hate the song. 02.  Fox's decision to cancel "Skin" was a bit surprising.  I actually liked the show.  Canning it after three episodes seems a bit hasty--especially when you consider their keeping "The Next Joe Millionaire". 03.  Enough media exposure for Jessica Lynch and Elizabeth Smart.  Please. 04.  I'm actually looking forward to Barbara Walter's interview with Martha Stewart.  But, ABC ill-advised publicity stunt of sending out a pre-show press release with the line "Martha Stewart says, 'I'm innocent.'" is just plain cheesy.

       ROUND TRIPP TICKET  On Monday, the federal government quietly  urlLink announced  that it was paying the infamous Linda Tripp (she of the Clinton/Lewinsky imbroglio) $595,000 to settle allegations that the Department of Defense   violated her privacy rights   when confidential information about her was disclosed during the Monica Lewinsky scandal.  Additionally, Ms. Tripp will receive three retroactive "outstanding" performance evaluations for her work in the Department Of Defense.  The evaluations will raise the amount of retirement benefits Ms. Tripp will be eligible for.  Talk about the pot calling the kettle black! The woman singlehandedly led the charge (with her surreptitious tape recording) to start of the impeachment proceedings against a sitting president.  We won't even go into how much the whole Ken Starr investigation and subsequent congressional hearings cost the American taxpayer.  Now, the hag gets to benefit even further for being a slithering snake.  Who ever said justice was blind (and apparently ugly) wasn't kidding.   THE REAGANS  Irregardless of what your opinion is or was of Ronald and Nancy Reagan (which in my case is not much), the cowardice that CBS is  urlLink showing  in the face of critics of its possibly upcoming movie project "The Reagans" is truly saddening.  Republicans and Conservatives are claiming that the telefilm portrays the Reagan's in a negative light and is filled with innaccuracies.  In response, CBS first demanded edits to the film which lead director Robert Allan Ackerman to leave the project.  Now, CBS Chairman Les Moonves is said to be considering either scrapping the project all together or moving it to pay cable channel Showtime (which is also a ViaCom owned venture.  Personally, I would not have watched the film to begin with.  But, I do find CBS's virtual lack of intestinal fortitude disarming.  As if every made-for-televsion movie ever presents a fair and balanced picture of its subject.  The fruition of any film project is obviously shaded by the writer, director and actors in the ensemble.  CBS's bowing to political pressure only shows its impudence for its viewers and their lack of trust in the intelligence of an audience to interpret a film and draw their own conclusions without it being spoonfed to them.   HUMAN HIV VACCINE TRIAL BEGINS  Twenty-four human volunteers in South Africa will begin a trial study for a potential HIV  urlLink vaccine .  The vaccination is derived from parts of a weakened strain of Venezuelan equine encephalitis and a harmless gene from a South African HIV strain.  It is hoped that this combination by entering human cells can stimulate the production of antibodies to fight off the AIDS infection.  A byproduct that is hoped to be realized is the creation of specialized cells dubbed "killer T-cells" that will identify and irradicate infected cells.  Roughly 11 percent of the population of South Africa--some 4.7 million people--are infected with HIV. An estimated 600 to 1,000 South Africans die every day from AIDS-related complications.   THE CONDOM SUSPENSION  A sixteen-year old Florida girl was  urlLink suspended  from her high school for wearing a Halloween costume that included a t-shirt covered in condoms.  The girl was given a three-day suspension (which was later reduced to one day) for "disrupting" class by handing out condoms to classmates.  The girl and her mother claimed she was promoting safe sex awareness.  Apparently, school officials did not agree.   AMERICA ROCKS THE VOTE  Tonight CNN and the Rock The Vote organization combine forces to bring the Democratic presidential candidates face-to-face with younger voters for " urlLink America Rocks The Vote " from 7:00-8:30 p.m. EST.  The event, broadcast live from Boston, will incorporate in-house and on-line questions from younger voters in the hope of encouraging young men and women to become more politically aware and active participants in the political process.

       YES I AM  I spent much of this weekend with a dear friend.  I hadn't seen Michael in about a year.  It was so much fun catching up and getting reacquainted.  I adore Michael.  Truth be told, I had a major crush on him when I first met him in college.  Of course, at the time I would have never copped to it.  After we became very close friends, we spent a lot of time with a group of about ten others that formed our circle of friends.  We partied together.  Went to movies and dinners together.  About a year after meeting Michael, I found out he was gay. He'd just come out to his parents and was now telling his friends.  I was dumbstruck.  Here I was pining over a guy who I thought was straight--and all of that time, we were on the same team.  Needless to say, to this day, we laugh ourselves silly about this 'misunderstanding'.    In many ways, it was Michael's revelation that he was gay that finally set me on my own course to finding my sexual identity.  I finally knew someone who was openly gay--and the world still kept on its axis.  I guess I took his example to heart.  By the time of his revelation, we were such great friends that I don't think there was ever a possibility of having a romantic relationship.  Instead, what we had was more valuable to me.  He played a huge part in my learning to accept my sexuality and showing me that I didn't have to keep it a secret any longer.  I didn't have to be afraid to be who I was.  Somewhere between my sophmore and junior year, I can remember heading to an all night study session with friends.  Five of us loaded into my roommate's car and headed to a Village Inn pancake house that was our hangout.  I think there ended up being about four more carloads of people going along.  I was in a car with Michael and three other guys.  It would end up being a night that changed me forever.    When our car pulled into the parking lot, we stopped in front of one of the huge plate glass windows.  I remember looking in and seeing my roommate and a bunch of other friends already inside pushing tables together in preparation.  When the car engine stopped, another friend who was driving let out a laugh and said, "I just realized that everyone in this car is a homo."  In the back seat, Michael looked at me and he said aloud, " Well, we don't know if  everyone  is."  Of course, I knew immediately the only person in the car that there was any question about was me.  I don't remember who, but someone just flat out asked.  I'm sure I was stunned for a second.  "Yes, I am gay.", I replied after a silence that seemed to go on forever.  Then everyone started piling out picking up backpacks and books like nothing had ever happened.  A hell of a lot more happened that night for me than most of those guys will ever now.  Michael knew.  For the first time, I had admitted publically to the "thing" that had scared me for years.  It wasn't a secret any longer.  Of course, I know realize that it probably wasn't that big of a secret to most of the guys in that car--or anyone else for that matter.  In fact, that admission was more about overcoming my own fear.  After that night, Michael and I flirted shamelessly with one another.  We thought nothing of openly sharing affection for one another.  We met each others parents.  In the end, his friendship meant more to me than any sexual relationship could ever have.  We laughed about my unrequited crush then--and now.   Today, I'm just glad he's in my life.  I love you Michael xox.   BISHOP GENE ROBINSON  Sunday, Reverend Gene Robinson was  urlLink consecrated  as the Bishop of New Hampshire in the Episcopal Church.  Robinson becomes the first openly gay Bishop in the Anglican church worldwide.  During the ceremony, Robinson received his bishop's mitre from partner Mark Andrew.  The ceremony was  witnessed by a crowd of about 4,000 on the campus of the University of New Hampshire.    During the ceremony, three people came forward to make official protests.  I was most struck by the comments made by Rev. Earle Fox from the Pittsburgh Diocese.  Among his comments was the following claim:  " Whatever else homosexual may be, it is a behavior. We are forbidden to judge persons but are allowed to judge behavior. "   SKIRTING THE ISSUE  Michael Brick writes a humorous piece in Sunday's  New York Times  regarding his  urlLink experience  of wearing a Jean Paul Gaultier men's skirt around New York City. His piece was written in response to a new special exhibit opening at the Metropolitan Museum Of Art on Tuesday.  " urlLink Bravehearts: Men in Skirts " examines the adoption of woman's fashion into men's wear.  While it is relatively common to see elements of a man's wardrobe in any woman's style arsenal, the reverse is a less common occurence.  The exhibit, which runs through February 2004,  at The Costume Institute looks at the taboo subject of men and skirts.    WORD OF THE DAY   urlLink botryoidal

       THE WITCHING HOUR  Last night, Pokey (my cat) and I sat with the door open waiting for the ghouls and goblins to arrive.  With a large bowl of candy at wait, we had a handful of trick or treaters visit us.  My favorite costume this year was a young girl wearing a big, poofy pink ballgown.  The hoop skirt was cool, but the very best part of her attire was the hair.  She had a pile of cotton candy pink hair that must have gone three feet in the air.  It was all very Marie Antoinette "let them eat cake".  Anyhow, I snapped this picture of Pokey as he tried to sneak up on the bowl to paw candy bars to the floor.  I swear I didn't touch his eyes.  But, I am starting to wonder if he's not possessed.        QUOTE OF THE DAY  " I have never had any difficulty with people who are gay doing things that they do in any walk of life that people who are not gay do. "-- British Prime Minister Tony Blair   BOY GEORGE DID IT!  In what can only be termed a unique strategy, the German magazine publisher Gruner + Jahr  urlLink claimed  in its suit against Rosie O'Donnell, that the problems began when Ms. O'Donnell fell under the spell of none other than Boy George.  In their breach of contract suit, G + J claim that they were appalled by some of O'Donnell's suggested topics for profile stories and cover photographs which included boxer Mike Tyson, Cher, Madonna and Boy George. (Oh! that crazy lesbian, what  was  she thinking?)  G + J further claims that Boy George allegedly urged her to shed the image of nice talk-show queen for that of a caustic comedian and high-profile lesbian.

       "TRUE FAITH"   "I feel so extraordinary Something's got a hold on me I get this feeling I'm in motion A sudden sense of liberty I don't care 'cause I'm not there And I don't care if I'm here tomorrow Again and again I've taken too much Of the things that cost you too much I used to think that the day would never come I'd see delight in the shade of the morning sun My morning sun is the drug that brings me near To the childhood I lost, replaced by fear I used to think that the day would never come That my life would depend on the morning sun...  When I was a very small boy, Very small boys talked to me Now that we've grown up together They're afraid of what they see That's the price that we all pay Our valued destiny comes to nothing I can't tell you where we're going I guess there was just no way of knowing I used to think that the day would never come I'd see delight in the shade of the morning sun My morning sun is the drug that brings me near To the childhood I lost, replaced by fear I used to think that the day would never come That my life would depend on the morning sun..."   --from the album "Substance" by New Order  As 2003 lurches to its last hurrah, I suppose it's only natural to reflect upon the world around you and your place in it.  This year has been one filled with change for me.  For the most part, changes that have only brought good things and made me a better person.  After ten years of twelve-hour-plus days, I finally left a career with the federal government.  When I left college it certainly was not where I thought my path would lead, but it was satisfying and rewarding experience on its own merits.  This year, I took stock of my life and realized that there were other things I wanted to pursue.  So I've slowed down to devote more time to writing and other artistic pursuits that just didn't fit into my hectic past life.  I've also decided I want to continue my education and resume my graduate work in economics.  Learning and the pursuit of knowledge has and always will be an important piece of who I am.  Sometimes I am frustrated that time does not allow all the things I wish to take on to coexist peacefully.  I'm happy where I'm at and I look forward to new experiences and projects.  While time is a finite thing, I hope that I use all of mine to the fullest.  As corny as it sounds, I found out that broken hearts do mend.  I don't think the wounds ever go away--and perhaps they serve a greater purpose.  But, the pain definitely subsides.  After taking most of the year to rebound from a four year relationship, I finally feel ready to proceed.  I've learned more about myself and what I need.  The biggest lesson I've learned is that while love is definitely a delicate dance of give and take--knowing when you've given enough and rightfully expecting a return does not make you a bad person. Love is such a funny thing.  It's so wonderful and yet so complicated.  I'm ready to share my life with the right person.  Not just a few weeks or months, but the rest of it.  Maybe I'm gullible to believe that true, lasting love exists.  But, I do believe it's possible (even for a gay man).  It's the time spent sharing all the things in your life you've worked for that make the rewards that much richer.  At 38, I've never quite felt "grown up" and I'm coming to the belief that this is a good thing.  To stop growing is to leave too much undone and unsaid.  As the morning sun comes up, I'm ready to move on.

       BLACK OR WHITE?  In a marketing ploy reminiscent of Willy Wonka's famed golden tickets, M&Ms will  urlLink lose  their color beginning in 2004.  In place of the usual rainbow of colors, M&Ms will only be colored black and white.  Set to be launched on Dick Clark's New Year's Eve shindig, the candy will appear in the monochromatic shades for a period of four to six months.  At some point, M&M's will release six special bags that will contain M&M's of the same color - one each for red, yellow, green, blue, brown and orange.  The owners of said bags are promised a grand prize (that has not as yet been announced).  While the contest is an obvious market ploy to raise sales of M&Ms in a flat chocolate market, there is also word that once the bags have been found a new palette of colors will be introduced by the company.  One can only assume the new color scheme will be more akin to the United Nations.   HILLARY & DUBYA  A joint CNN/USA Today/Gallup  urlLink poll  asked Americans which woman and man they most admired in 2003.  The open-ended poll question brought President George W. Bush 29% of the vote to win as the man most admired by Americans.  He beat out the likes of Secretary of State Colin Powell, Pope John Paul II and former President Bill Clinton.  However,  it was not a complete wash for the Clinton household.  Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton was the most admired woman with 16% of the vote.  Runner-ups included Oprah Winfrey, First Lady Laura Bush and Condoleezza Rice.  One assumes that Mr. Bush and Ms. Clinton will not be appearing on the same political ticket any time soon.   NEW HAMPSHIRE & ABORTION  The subject of abortion has become a political hotbed  urlLink issue  in the state of New Hampshire.  This spring the New Hampshire Legislature grappled with new legislation in regards to a minor's right to have an abortion.  At issue was whether parents of a minor had a right to be notified prior to an abortion being performed.  The anti-abortion lobby couched its argument as a question of a "parental right to know" while many saw this is as another attempt to chip away at Roe v. Wade.  The resultant legislation which required a notice two days prior to any procedure would have gone into effect on Wednesday.  However, yesterday a federal court judge struck down the law as unconstitutional.  Supporters say they will appeal the decision.  This decision comes on the heels of similarly struck down legislation in Florida and Colorado.   "THE KEEPERS OF THE HOUSE"  In a recent discussion/argurment regarding the hipocrisy of the reticent revelation of Senator J. Strom Thurmond's family acknowledging an illegitimate black daughter, I was reminded of Shirley Ann Grau's 1964 novel " urlLink The Keepers of the House ".  At the time of its publication, Grau's work was met with  urlLink controversy  as the book detailed the story of a wealthy white man's 30-year love affair with a black housekeeper in rural Alabama.  The tale of an interracial love story met with threats from the Ku Klux Klan and outrage that a white woman would write about black characters.  Ms. Grau's book received the Pulitzer Prize in 1965.  While there are many parallels in this work of fiction with the Thurmond legacy, the story of William Howland takes the issue a step further.  In the book, Howland falls in love with and marries the black housekeeper.  However, he keeps the marriage a secret and passes off his light-skinned children as white.  It becomes a tale of racisim and familial relations and what secrets can do to a family.  Filled with a true morality play and seething rage,  Ms. Grau's novel has recently been re-released and should be a must-read.

       BOYS DO CRY  On New Year's Eve, it will have been  urlLink ten years  since Brandon Teena was brutally raped and murdered.  Lisa Lambert and Philip Divine, who witnessed the acts against Teena were also murdered.  John Lotter and Marvin Nissen were both convicted of the crimes.  Lotter sits on Nebraska's death row and Nissen was given a life sentence.  Brandon Teena was murdered after the two men discovered that he was actually born a woman (Teena Brandon) and had been dating a mutal friend.  The events in Humboldt, Nebraska were dramatized in the 1999 film by Kimberly Peirce entitled " urlLink Boys Don't Cry ".  The film was a powerhouse of emotion graced with dynamic performances by Hillary Swank, Chloe Sevigny and Peter Sarsgaard.  Ms. Swank would go on to win the Academy Award for Best Actress in a Motion Picture for her portrayal of Brandon Teena.  More importantly, the word transgendered suddenly found its way into vocabularies of people across the country.  If America was aware of transgenderism, they certainly did not fully understand the implications the word carried.  Ten years later, it could still be argued that being transgendered is no less difficult and no more understood.  While the past several years have seen culture and society dealing with the issues of homosexuality and bisexuality with mixed results, the plight of transgendered or intersexed individuals is a road that still leads to roadblocks, questions and misunderstanding.  In the years since Mr. Teena's death, progress has been made--but at the same time slowly.   According to  urlLink The Transgender Law and Policy Institute , hate crime laws in states and municipalities that specifically include transgendered people have increased from nine to an underwhelming 65, This year, California became the fourth state to adopt a law.  When one considers the number of states and municipalities that have not addressed the issue, the progress is somewhat muted and the need for change highlighted.    Gender discrimnation policies that include the transgendered are finding their way into large corporations like Hewlett-Packard and Nike.  In Congress, 145 congressional offices have adopted similar policies.  Slowly but surely, gender is becoming a civil rights issue.  People are finally realizing that sexual orientation and sexual identity are indeed two separate entities.  Perhaps people are ready to see two women or two men kiss or sleep in the same bed, but ask them to try and understand someone who is a cross-dresser, intersexual, or transgender and they're not sure what to do with that information.  Being a homosexual male, I've faced my share of homophobia and discrimination based soley on the fact of who I love or sleep with.  Yet, in the realm of the big picture, I have to know that what I've faced or dealt with only begins to open doors full of questions for the transgendered.  In fact, the homosexual/bisexual community is at times as non-forgiving as their heterosexual counterparts.     urlLink Paisley Currah , who is the executive director of the Center for Lesbian and Gay Studies at Brooklyn College perhaps puts it best when she says, "For a long time the gay movement was like, 'Well, that's an interesting problem, but it's not our problem. You folks are too weird. We don't want to talk to you.'"  The cringeworthy brutality of the Brandon Teena story and the inept way law enforcement dealt with his case brought many a new awareness of transgenderism.  When you stop and consider that police reports related to the rape and death of Teena referred to him as "it" and that his mother was originally awarded a sum total of $ 17,360 (later upped to $98,223 by intervention of the Nebraska Supreme Court) for damages because Teena was held partly responsible for his own death, your stomach cannot help but turn.  Nebraska for its part passed hate crimes legislation in 1997.  However, that legislation was found unconstitutional in 2000 based on a New Jersey case appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court.  Sadly the law that was passed and then repealed made no mention of the transgendered.  This weekend, I pulled out my copy of "Boys Don't Cry" and watched it again.  It had been several years since I'd seen it and the experience was as moving and upsetting as it was the first time I watched it.  Sometimes it is so difficult to imagine the ugliness and hate that festers inside individuals.  It's repulsive to know that loving someone can get you killed.  It's sad that law enforcement is still of the mindset that a rape victim in some way "asked for it" (regardless of the sex or sexual orientation of the victim).  Watching the horror unfold in a film that I want to believe could not happen in "real life" today, I realize that prejudice and hate against the transgendered have not died in ten years.  For all of the awareness and progress we have made as GLBT community, the journey is far from over.  The journey for those outside the GLBT community is even longer.  For every Brandon Teena, there are faceless, nameless individuals who are harrassed, beaten and killed for nothing more than who they are.  This year a total of 18 transgendered individuals were killed in bias or hate related crimes according to the on-line group  urlLink Remembering Our Dead .    As 2003 draws to a close, I still cried for Brandon Teena.  But along with the tears came a sense of urgency, a dose of anger, and a renewed committment.  I don't pretend to understand the obstacles the intersexed and transgendered face.  Yet, I can relate to the struggle.  It is a struggle that binds us all together.  Human decency and human sexuality share more than mere humanity.  It's okay to cry.  It's good to not forget.  Then, it's time to do something.

       WORDS OF THE YEAR 2003  Accordng to a report published yesterday by  urlLink yourDictionary.com , the number one word of 2003 was "embedded" (as in reporters doing the Iraq War).  It beat out the word "blog" for the top spot.  The full list of their Top Ten Words of 2003 is as follows:  01.  embedded 02.  blog 03.  SARS 04.  Spam 05.  taikonaut 06.  Bushism 07.  allision 08.  recall 09.  Middangeard 10.  celibacy  I'm not sure what that says about us that Tolkien, Bush, a disease and abstaining from sex are all in the top ten.  In the category of Top Ten Personal Names, Saddam Hussein takes the prize.  He beats out his nemesis W. (Dubya) at #2.  It's somewhat fitting and humorous that more people searched for Dubya than George W. Bush.  Unfortunately fame is such a fleeting thing.  Who is going to tell Paris Hilton that she came in at #8 behind the likes of Rush Limbaugh, Martha Stewart, the Pope and the governor of California (distressingly referred to as "Ahh-nold").  The horrors!  The top phrase of the year was the infamous "Shock-and-Awe".  My two personal favorites were #5 ("16 Words" referring to Bush's State of The Union faux pas regarding the purchase of uranium) and #10 ("Halliburton Energy Services").  The top Youth Speak words included "What Up!", "Stog" and "SNAG (Sensitive New-Age Guy)".  The most spoken word in the World remains the ever popular "OK".  Finally for your viewing pleasure, the top five mispronunciations by the President of the United States (I'm sure they were not want for material.):  01. a-MERR-ca  (America)  02. NEW-cue-ler  (nuclear)  03. JU-ler-ee  (jewelry)  04. Anzar  (Spanish Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar)  05. Ne-VAH-duh  (Nevada)

"Up Against All Odds"--Tarralyn Ramsey  Singles Artist Female 2003:   urlLink Christina Aguilera  Singles Artist Male 2003:   urlLink Robbie Williams    COLD MOUNTAIN  As much as I loved "House Of Sand And Fog", the odds on favorite for Oscar has to be " urlLink Cold Mountain ".  Meticulously and seductively directed and written by Anthony Minghella (and based on the Charles Frazier book), the film is a visually arresting Civil War period piece.  The story of journeys made by the film's characters is beautifully photographed by John Seale.  Stellar perfomances from the troika of Law (Inman), Kidman (Ada), and Zellweger (Ruby) highlight a film filled with wonderful supporting perfomances from the likes of Natalie Portman, Brendan Gleeson, Phillip Seymour Hoffman, Giovanni Ribisi and Kathy Baker.  From the beautiful scenery of Romania (subbing for western North Carolina) to the beautiful score by Gabriel Yared, "Cold Mountain" is an epic story of war and relationships.  It's brutal.  It's beautiful.  It's just the kind of film Oscar loves.   THE CHRISTMAS STORY  I had a wonderful Christmas with my family.  One of the gifts my niece received was a karaoke machine.  We must have sang ourselves silly for hours and laughed up a storm.  It deteriorated into a public access radio show that was too funny for words. (Our traffic reporter, Nerd Roberts, was killed in a tragic helicopter accident--so very Dr. Romano).  We ate turkey, ham and all the trimmings.  Of course, we had no snow--but it was a wonderful Christmas nonetheless.  I received some great additions to my DVD collection: "Strangers With Candy", "Coupling", "24 (Season 2)".  I was also gifted a gorgeous globe, a fax machine, Armania Mania and a couple of GameCube titles among other things.  But I think if I had to pick my favorite gift this year, it would have to be this:  urlLink 6-in-1 Kameleon Touch-Screen Remote .  This has to be one of the neatest pieces of technology to come along in a while.  I was overrun with a literal pile of remote controls.  Now, one sleek beautiful remote controls my television, satellite receiver, VCR, DVD, home theater system and stereo.  It looks fabulous too!   TOM SNEDDON: D.A. OR MEDIA WHORE?  Santa Barbara County District Attorney Tom Sneddon's gleeful abandon in pursuing Michael Jackson has sunk to new  urlLink lows  in its zealousness.  Whatever your opinion of Michael Jackson or the charges leveled against him, you cannot help but notice the unusual way his case is being handled.  Sneddon's original press conference was a textbook example of gloating.  Having media crews following the clerk filing charges against Jackson was pandering in its lowest form.  Rumors that Sneddon has hired a public relations group (The Firm) to orchestrate press appearances are troubling.  Now comes word that Sneddon has set up a website dedicated solely to the Michael Jackson affair.  Along with showcasing all relevant documents, the site has a FAQ section that has to be seen to believed.  Now many legal scholars are wondering if Sneddon has finally gone too far and compromised Jackson's right to a fair trial.  One can only speculate that Sneddon is looking forward to a time when he will be making the press circuit promoting his new book about the case.   ALBUM OF THE WEEK  Meeting great resistance at radio with its first single, Nelly Furtado's " urlLink Folklore " is a gem of an album that has been overlooked by many.  "Powerless (Say What You Want)" is one of those songs that takes repeated listenings to appreciate.  But once you surrender to its magic, you've got an inkling of the wonders that await on the album.  Furtado infuses her music with new sounds and her Brazilian cultural influences.  More musical and experimental than her hit debut"Whoa, Nelly!", "Folklore" is a soundscape of beautifully cohesive and superbly written songs.  Among the stand-out tracks: "Build You Up", "Explode", "Picture Perfect", "Childhood Dreams" and "Island Of Wonder".  "Folklore" also sports an impressive supporting cast with guest appearances by world music greats Kronos Quartet, Bela Fleck, Jarvis Church, Michael Einziger and Caetano Veloso.  This is not so much an album as it is a beautiful journey.  Simply gorgeous.  Don't miss it.   WORLD IDOL  As an avowed "American Idol" fan, I was curious to watch Fox's Christmas special " urlLink World Idol " (which concludes on New Year's Day).  It was interesting to see how the competition was viewed elsewhere in the world.  The singers ranged from bad to interesting.  The judges were far more amusing.  I don't think the Polish judge will ever be invited to any competition again.  Aside from the strong U.S. entry of Kelly Clarkson, I'd have to say that the only two who have a comparative chance at winning the title are the contestants from Norway and South Africa.  I also have to be upfront and admit that I have a new schoolgirl crush on 25 year-old  urlLink Heinz Winckler  of South Africa.  Those eyes.

       REST YE MERRY GENTLEPEOPLE  I just wanted to take a moment and wish you and yours a wonderful holiday season.  Whether you celebrate Hanukkah, Kwanzaa, Christmas or none of the above,  may you be surrounded by love, warmth and the people you love.  I will be spending Christmas with my mom and my sister's family.  I am blessed to have a wonderful niece (who is 11) and nephew (who is 9) who add so much light to my life.  Experiencing Christmas through their eyes is a magical thing.  There is also a part of me that will forever be a little boy who believes in Santa.  While I love receiving gifts as much as the next person, there is something about the joy I receive from giving that is simply priceless.  I also have to say thank you to a wonderful blogging community.  One of the best gifts I received this year is the opportunity to cross paths with a brilliant, funny, diverse group of people.  Aside from the inspiration and encouragement I've received as I jumped into this phenomenon that is weblogs, I've been fortunate enough to make treasured acquaintances and true friends.  The power of words is only eclipsed by the soul of the people who write them.

       ANOTHER MADE-FOR-TV WAR MOMENT?  After days of U.S. media outlets showing footage of the infamous spiderhole that was alleged to be Saddam Hussein's hiding place and portraying him as a cowering rat, a new  urlLink take  on Hussein's capture is slowly finding its way into media reports.  Contradicting the claims that U.S. and British Intelligence led to the capture, a report Sunday in a British newspaper claims that Saddam Hussein was captured by an element of the Kurdish Patriotic Front, drugged and later abandoned for U.S. soldiers to find.  Hussein is said to have been betrayed by a member of the al-Jabour tribe in retaliation for a rape committed against his daughter by Hussein son Uday.  The newspaper quotes an unnamed British Intelligence officer as saying the report "exposes the version peddled by American spin doctors as incomplete".  The paper further claims that Hussein had been held a hostage for some time by the Kurdish group who was negotiating for power in the region.  It will be interesting to see what the U.S. official response will be to these reports.  Did they not learn anything after the Jessica Lynch fiasco?   ANGELS IN AMERICA  This weekend I watched all six hours of HBO's adaption of Tony Kushner's " urlLink Angels in America " for a second time.  It was as stunning and moving the second time through--if not more so.  Mike Nichols's lyrical portrait of Kushner's searing words is as relevant today as it was when it debuted on Broadway.  The names and years may have changed, but much of the history and story is sadly the same.  While every cast member was extraordinary in their roles, I was completely mesmerized with Jeffrey Wright's turn as Belize.  Wright is a blazing tour-de-force worthy of award recogniton.  Scathing, bitchy, brilliant, compassionate, he takes a role he played on Broadway to an entirely new and nuanced level.  Mary-Louise Parker's Harper Pitt is a brilliant portrait of disintegration and rise as a phoenix of unfettered proportion.  Justin Kirk and Patrick Wilson are superb in their difficult roles.  I am so looking forward to the DVD presentation of the film.  Truly a movie--and experience--for the ages.    BEST REMASTERED RECORDING OF 2003      Make no doubt about it.  This is one album that  MUST  be in your collection.  This exquisitely remastered, repackaged set is one of the most exciting recordings of the past twenty-odd years.  Disc One provides a remastered version of the album as it first appeared.  Then all eight tracks are repeated in the original productions as helmed by Nile Rodgers and Bernard Edwards (of Chic fame).  Forget, that you get a second disc of extended, remixed material.  The original session recordings are worth every penny of the $29.98 this set that lists for.  Turn it up really loud and bask in the glow that is some of Diana Ross' finest work.

       TWO STEPS FORWARD, THREE STEPS BACK  The opening paragraph from a  urlLink piece  written by Katharine Q. Seelye and Janet Elder for today's  The New York Times  pretty much says it all:  " The latest New York Times/CBS News poll has found widespread support for an amendment to the United States Constitution to ban gay marriage. It also found unease about homosexual relations in general, making the issue a potentially divisive one for the Democrats and an opportunity for the Republicans in the 2004 election. "  Regardless of where your opinion falls on the spectrum of arguments for and against gay marriage, I don't think the recent poll data is that surprising.  In light of the recent Supreme Court decision striking down anti-sodomy laws and the Massachusetts Supreme Court ruling that same-sex marriages were permissible under the state constitution, a reasonable negative backlash should be expected.  Change of the status quo will always illicit uncomfort in many quarters.  However, the most insiduous blowback comes as this issue is seen as a political weapon by the Repulican Party.  In paragraph eight of  The New York Times  piece comes something more distressing than 71% oppostion to gay marriage from a religion perspective in any poll:  " The statement signals the White House's increasing confidence that it can exploit the matter in the presidential campaign, both to energize its evangelical supporters and to discredit the eventual Democratic nominee. "  The truly offensive marriage lies between the current White House and its evangelical supporters.  By exploiting  a largely uneducated and unaware populace, they hope to strike fear in Middle America.  By making homosexuality and a 'homosexual agenda' into campaign points, the Republican Party will use fear as a platform in their brand of compassionate conservatism.  While GLBT issues have made inroads in societal acceptance, the Republicans look to use homosexuality and marriage as a dividing force.    One can only hope that Americans are smarter than their government gives them credit for.

       THE TRUTH ABOUT SUPERMAN  He was   the   classic superhero, and his story was very relevant to the young gay reader. First of all, he came from another planet. Secondly, he was raised by some hick couple who were well-meaning--but basically clueless. Then, like many gay men, he left his hometown of Smallville and traveled to a large city, where he got a low-paying job in a creative field. Then, while working at the newspaper, a co-worker got a crush on him, and he had to lie constantly about where he'd been and what exploits he'd encountered. Finally, there was some nerdy younger man tagging around after him, desperately trying to be his pal.  Unfortunately, there were many elements of this comic that struck us as highly implausible. First of all, we never believed that merely by putting on a pair of glasses, Superman would turn into a dork. His spectacles were actually quite stylish, and many gay men today would wear those frames even if their eyesight was 20/20. Also, there must have been at least one gay man working at the  Daily Planet  who would have recognized Superman's body, no matter how boxy Clark Kent wore his suits (which is probably why we never met the paper's drama critic, who undoubtedly would have immediately spilled the beans to Lois: "Darling. Just look at Clark's shoulders...")

       HOUSE OF SAND AND FOG  Vadim Perelman's breathtaking directorial debut " urlLink House Of Sand And Fog " opens today in New York and Los Angeles and will bow nationwide on December 26th.  I saw a preview of the movie about two weeks ago.  It just floored me.  So much so that after the credits had rolled, I was still firmly planted in my seat trying to wrap my mind around what I had just witnessed.  First, and foremost, Sir Ben Kingsley gives the finest performance of his career.  Yes, it's a performance that tops his masterful work in "Ghandi" and "Sexy Beast" in my opinion.  I dare you to take your eyes off the screen for a second when his portrayal of Massoud Amir Behrani--an exhiled Iranian military office--graces it.  The talented Jennifer Connelly (Kathy Nicolo) gives a heartbreaking performance as a woman fighting to escape years of addiction and a failed marriage.   A brilliant supporting cast in Shohreh Aghdashloo, Ron Eldard, Frances Fisher and Jonathon Ahdout complete the ensemble.  Based on the 1999 book of the same title by  urlLink Andre Dubus III , the story explores what the mythical American Dream means to people of seemingly unrelated backgrounds.  At the center of the story is ownership of a house--a house that Behrani and Nicolo have desperate reasons to claim ownership over.   The house is a small run-down bungalow, but the value it has to the lives of the two principles fighting for it unmeasurable.  The unwitting spiral that the characters fall into leads to a devastating  and heartbreaking zenith.  The film explores a clash of cultures, human needs, hope, despair and the ultimate tenet that more often then not the things that divide us are simply things we all share.  I would expect to see Academy Award nominations for Kingsley and Connelly, as well as a nod for the film in Best Picture.  If the Academy overlooks Aghdashloo it would be a crime.   Don't miss this film.  Compelling, uncomfortable, and tragic--it's truly one of the best of the year.   NOTES FROM HOLLYWOOD  01.  The long gestating "A Confederacy Of Dunces" is starting principal photography with Will Ferrell in the lead. 02.  Matt Damon has expressed interest in seeing a draft of the script for Ang Lee's "Brokeback Mountain". 03.  Augusten Burrough's "Running With Scissors" screenplay is being crafted specifically for Julianne Moore.  Early word is "brilliant". 04.  M. Night Shyamalan will helm "Life Of Pi" once he completes work on "The Village". 05.  Akiva Goldsman is working on a second draft of the screenplay to Dan Brown's "The DaVinci Code". 06.  After ten screenplay drafts, "The Amazing Adventures Of Kavalier & Clay" is greenlighted with Stephen Daldry directing. 07.  "A Home At The End Of The World" is in post-production.  Word from the set is that this is Colin Farrell's finest work to date. 08.  Word is David Hare has completed a screenplay for Jonathan Franzen's "The Corrections". 09.  Warner Bros. is said to be mulling a sequel to 1985's "The Goonies".  The success of "Pirates of the Caribbean" seems to be the impetus. 10.  Rob Marshall's next film will definitely be "Memoirs Of A Geisha".

       HYPOTHETICAL AXIOMS  Say you're a 38 year-old gay man.  Say you've been in love twice in your lifetime thus far.  We're talking the truly, madly, deeply kind of love.  For the moment, discount the first time you fell in love with a man.  The second time you fell in love it was with a man who was eight days younger than you.  You fell in love with his personality first, the person second.  In the back of your mind, you let yourself believe that this is 'the one'.  This is the man that you will spend the rest of your life with--the picket fence and all the trimmings.  You have a great relationship for over four years.  At least, you thought it was a great relationship.  RULE #1:  You can never know what lurks in the heart or mind of man--especially when he doesn't share it with you.  So after four plus years, you discover that for the last two months he's been cheating with another man.  He doesn't have the decency or trust to tell you.  You find out by complete accident.  You suddenly question everything and everyone in your life for the last few years.  You're not sure what a broken heart is, but you know what it feels like.  The pain is excruciating.  The next few months are filled with arguments and hopeless attempts to right a wrong.  You both say you want to salvage what you once had.  In the end, you realize forgiveness is possible.  But, forgetting is improbable.  RULE #2:  Love can be mistreated.  Lovers can hurt one another.  Love isn't as forgiving as you are.  After the break-up, you make an ill-advised effort to continue contact.  You attempt being friends.  How the hell do you define friendship after you've had an intimate relationship with someone?  He's moved on with the person he cheated with.  You're bitter.  Yet, some self-destructive seed buries itself in your mind that you need this person in your life.  RULE #3: Sometimes love does cost a thing.  So why is any of this important?  Why is any of this relevant to you now.  It's been over a year since you've spoken to him.  You've finally moved on.  You've nursed your wounds and become a stonger person in spite of them.  You look forward to finding the person you're meant to be with.  You have many expectations--but none that are unreasonable.  Most importantly, you realize that you have a right to those expectations.  To settle for less is to lessen your worth.  RULE #4:  Despite the odds, love is possible and a goal to strive for.  You deserve as much love as you have to give.  Yesterday, you hit the button on the answering machine.  After a couple of non-descript messages, there's his voice.  He's "been thinking about you".  He "misses you".  He'd like to talk and leaves his new cell phone number.  You listen to message about five times.  Suddenly, you're nearly drowning in a flood of memories.  It's a test isn't it?  You write the number down on a scrap of colored paper.  You stare at it.  You erase the message.  You stare at the paper.  After what seems hours, you open a drawer in the desk and throw the paper back into a corner.  Despite your initial impulse, you don't call.  Surprisingly, you don't want to call.  With a note of sadness and a bounty of relief, you realize you will probably never call.  RULE #5:  Sometimes, it is about me.   NOTES ON 2004 GOLDEN GLOBE NOMINATIONS  01.  Not surprisingly, "Cold Mountain" receives a lion share.  Kidman, Law and Zellweger get much deserved nods. 02.  Actress in a Drama:  Surprising (and deserved) nominations for Cate Blanchett ("Veronica Guerin") and Evan Rachel Wood ("Thirteen") 03.  Actor in a Drama:  No surprises.  Ben Kingsley's turn in "House Of Sand and Fog" is the performance to beat. 04.  Actress in a Supporting Role: Clarkson ("Pieces Of April") and Bello ("The Cooler") are surprises. 05.  Actor in a Supporting Role: Thrilled for Peter Sarsgaard ("Shattered Glass").  Hopefully Academy voters will take note.  Complete  urlLink list  of 2004 nominations.

       HISTORY IS A CRUEL BITCH  On the 100th  urlLink anniversary  of Orville & Wilbur Wright's historic flight on Kill Devil Hills near Kittyhawk, North Carolina, an ill-advised re-enactment fell right out of the sky.  A meticulously rendered copy of the 1903 Wright Flyer stumbled down a narrow track and unceremoniously came to a halt in a mud puddle.  It could not get airborne. Despite a cheering crowd, the 12-second, 120-foot flight could not be replicated.  History, much like Mother Nature, does not like to be messed with.    IVY BLIZZARD?  On Wednesday, the U.S. forces in Iraq  urlLink launched  an operation codename: Ivy Blizzard.  The mission was launced to root out anti-coalition insurgents in the city of Samarra.  The raid netted 30 arrests of suspected terrorists.  Samarra, which is near Tikrit, has proved to be a thorn in the side of coalition forces.  While there is nothing spectaculary newsworthy about this operation, I felt duty bound to comment on it if for no other reason than its colorful name.  Operation Ivy Blizzard?  Who says their are no high ranking gays in the military? Please.   HERE'S A REAL COFFEE TABLE BOOK  Coming it at 133 lbs and measuring a mere 5 feet by 7 feet,  urlLink "Bhutan: A Visual Odyssey Across the Last Himalayan Kingdom"  is not only the world's largest book--but a photographic essay of one of the world's smallest countries.  Bhutan is the last intact Himalayan kingdom. The country is roughly the size of Switzerland, but has a population of nearly 700,000 people, Bhutan is often referred to as "the last Shangri-la" on Earth.  Hoping to document that pristine environment, scientists from MIT and Friendly Planet in four separate treks took over 400,000 individual photographs of the land and its people.  You can own a copy of "Bhutan" for a mere $10,000.00 (a fully tax-deductible charitable donation).  The real problem, however, is where you'll store it.   THE TRUTH CAN BE AN UGLY THING  During my morning sweep of the weblogs I read daily, I was struck by an insightful political commentary written by Mr. Geoffrey Saunders Schramm over at  urlLink Fit to be Tied .  Entitled "The Voice Of Reason", his essay makes a clear case for an ugly truth.  That hard-to-swallow fact being that recent geopolitical events and a highly unorganized Democratic Party favor a return of President Bush to the White House for a second term.  While the thought of this literally makes my skin crawl, the complacency of a disillusioned electorate and the seeping influence of conservatism may indeed sweep Bush back into power.  As Mr. Schramm points out, it is only by advocacy and each of us participating in the democratic process that change may have a fighting chance.  Unfortunately, many take that process for granted--or frankly don't care about their right to vote.  While I was torn for a short while between supporting the Clark or Dean campaigns, I feel that the most likely and effective nominee will be Governor Howard Dean.  I, too, will be working to make sure a Bush repeat does not come to fruition.

       THERE ARE MANY WAYS TO COME OUT OF THE CLOSET...  Yesterday in a  urlLink statement  issued throught the family's lawyer, the Thurmond family acknowledged that the late South Carolinian Senator J. Strom Thurmond  had sired an illegitimate child with the 16 year-old daughter of an African-American maid in the Thurmond household when he was 22 years old.  After withholding her story (despite rampant rumors) from the press until after Senator Thurmond's death at the age of 100,  Essie Mae Washington-Williams said at the urging of her children, she wanted to be acknowledged by the Thurmond family.  She said that she had kept her secret for so long out of respect for the Thurmond's family and career.  After an interview over the weekend with  The Washington Post , Ms. Washington-Williams had planned to hold a press conference later this week to ask the family to acknowledge her birthright.  Cutting her off at the pass, the Thurmond family released the following statement to the press:  " As J. Strom Thurmond has passed away and cannot speak for himself, the Thurmond family acknowledges Ms. Essie Mae Washington-Williams' claim to her heritage.  We hope this acknowledgment will bring closure for Ms. Williams. "  To say this is a revolting act by the family is an understatement.  Isn't that nice?  After 78 years, they hope to bring Ms Williams closure?  The fact that Thurmond was one of the strongest segregationists in the United States Congress and had sired a black child is the utter height of hypocrisy.  That Ms. Washington-Williams kept the Thurmond dirty little secret until after his passing out of a respect she clearly did not owe the man, speaks volumes about her character and integrity.  On the other hand, the family's callous statement is egregious in so many ways.   ...BUT, DON'T DO IT IN THE NFL  Former NFL player, commentator and current president of the Detroit Lions Matt Millen is making more fans.  Millen issued an  urlLink apology  on Monday for using a derogatory term for gays in a heated exchange with Kansas City receiver Johnnie Morton. According to the  Kansas City Star , Millen and Morton had a hostile post-game exchange outside Kansas City's locker room Sunday.  Millen was overheard by at least two witnesses yelling:   " You faggot! Yeah, you heard me. You faggot! "  Nice.  People actually wonder why gay professional athletes aren't lining up to come out of the closet?  Millen said in his apology, " He made an inappropriate remark, and I reacted inappropriately.  I said something I shouldn't have, which was wrong, and I apologize for that. And I apologize to anybody that I offended with that remark. "   Gee thanks, Mr. Millen.  For his part, Morton is quoted in press reports as saying, " What he said is demeaning and bigoted.  Jeremy Shockey got in trouble for saying it about a coach [Bill Parcells], and now we have a president of a team making statements like that. It's totally unacceptable. I have gay friends, and I don't even joke around with them like that.

       WONDER IF SHE'LL GET AN INVITATION NEXT YEAR?  It's probably a safe bet that singer Lauryn Hill will never be invited to the Vatican again.  Hill was one of the invited  urlLink performers  to the 11th Annual Vatican Christmas Concert.  In front of an audience of 7,500, including many senior church officials, Ms. Hill used a part of her stage time to read from a prepared statement.  Among the choice remarks:  " I'm not here to celebrate, like you, the birth of Christ, but to ask you why you are not in mourning for his death in this place?  Holy God has witnessed the corruption of your leadership, of the exploitation and abuses which are the minimum that can be said for the clergy. "  The gala concert is usually run on Italian television on Christmas Eve.  It is thought that Ms. Hill's commentary will be excised from the telecast.   ARCHIMEDES & THE STOMACHION  In a story that could only appeal to a mathematician (like me), comes the solution to an age-old dilemma.  Archimedes was an important Greek mathematician who 2,200 years ago wrote a treatise entitled " urlLink Stomachion ".  Long forgotten and dismissed as unimportant, the theories in the document seemed lost to obscurity.    Now comes word that a math historian at Stanford, Dr. Reviel Netz, came across the Stomachion text in an ancient parchment which had been overwritten by monks and was damaged by mold.  The Stomachion reveals an insight into the relatively new filed of combinatorics.  Combinatorics is the study of how many ways a given problem can be solved.  The Stomachion specifically dealt with a problem of fourteen irregular shapes of paper that were to be pieced together to form a square (a wonderful  urlLink graphic  illustration of the problem).  After six weeks or intensive research, Dr. Netz and his team were able to solve Archimedes' lost problem.  The answer: 17, 152 combinations.  This discovery is significant in that fact that the original text of Archimedes treatise was found in an ancient palimpsest in a monestary in Constantinople and passed through at least three different owners before Netz's discovery. It also confirms that Archimedes was a true mathematics pioneer doing work on the theory of combinatorics long before the field was established in the age of computer science.  Great stuff!   GREAT FILMS NOT ON DVD  There's a great piece in today's  The New York Times  by Fred Kaplan  urlLink bemoaning  the fact that many important and classic films have not found their way to the DVD format.  In Kaplan's discussion of a "most wanted" list, he notes that not a single film of the revered Marx Brothers or Astaire-Rogers catalog is available on DVD.  Among the list of great films on Kaplan's list: "White Heat", "The Magnificent Ambersons", "Ninotchka", "La Dolce Vita", "Gaslight", "The African Queen", and a long brewing remaster and revision of "Blade Runner".   HOW TO LOSE A MILLION DOLLARS  The seventh season of " urlLink Survivor " came to a close last night with the crowning of 29 year-old Washingtonian Sandra Diaz-Twine.  She was picked by runner-up Lillian Morris to face the jury in the final voting.  First, I have to say I'm thrilled that the idiot that was "Johnny Fairplay" didn't make the final two.  Secondly, I've never seen a person hand over the prize as convincingly as Lillian did.  Many will argue her first mistake was to pick Sandra over Jon after winning the final immunity.  However, I think she would have lost either way after her irratating and sanctimonious appearance before the jury.  By the time the vote happened, I wanted Liliian to shut up.  She completely imploded any chance she had.  I think she alienated practically everyone with her self-serving comments.  If she mentioned the Boy Scouts one more time, I was hoping someone would pick up a torch and hit her with it.  I think the 6-1 vote says it all.   THE HOT LIST  01.

       INFORMATION SOCIETY  The first World Summit on the Information Society  urlLink closed  Friday in Geneva, Switzerland.  The three-day event was organized and sponsored by the United Nations.   Delegates from 168 nations around the world met to draft a declaration of principles and 29-point action plan to address the needs of extending the ever-burgeoning electronic information society to help address the needs of underdeveloped countries and stimulate and boost economic growth.  The conference focused on implementing communication and information flow via such emerging technologies as the World Wide Web, broadcasting multimedia and cellular telephones.    It is mind-boggling to note that  approximately 90 percent of the world population is not connected to the Internet .  This staggering figure only demonstrates the width of the so-called 'digital divide' between rich and poor countries.  One proposed solution is the implementation of a "Solidarity Fund" to help developing nations pay for the implementation of technology.  Of course, this was a great bone of contention between delegates that eventually lead to no formal declaration of such a fund.  Going into the summit, some of the richer developed countries (most notably Japan and the European Nation) sent lower profile delegates as a means to protest the formation of such a fund.  Underveloped countries (most notably African delegates) lobbied strenuously for the financial assistance.  The issue was skirted--though noted to be under discussion--until the second phase conference convenes in Tunis in 2005.  You can find a lot of interesting material and background on the official  urlLink World Summit on the Information Society  website.  There are also many business and non-profit projects working toward similar goals.  An interesting example of this is  urlLink The Hello World Project .

       ROSIE, GRUNER + JAHR & GAY MARRIAGE  In an interview that will be broadcast today on Sirius OutQ (the gay and lesbian talk channel on Sirius Satellite Radio), Rosie O'Donnell  urlLink tells  Michelangelo Signorile that her position on the issue of gay marriage has done an about face.  Interviewed for the "The Michelangelo Signorile Show', O'Donnell says that the recent legal scuffle with the publishers of her now-defunct magazine made her reconsider her personal stance on gay marriage.  Specifically O'Donnell says:  " I have a partner, a wife, which is strange word for me to use. I never really used it until I got sued. And you want to know why? If you are a heterosexual talk show host and you're sued by a major corporation, anything you have said to your husband is privileged information. But if you are a homosexual talk show host and you're sued by a corporation, anything you have ever said and/or written to your spouse, partner, or wife is allowed to be entered into the record. It is totally unfair. And never in my wildest dreams -- if you said to me you're going to become an advocate for gay marriage, I'd say you're on crack. "  The interview is scheduled to run between 1-4 p.m. EST today.   BUSH & BLACKMAIL  One can only try to imagine the imbeciles that are  urlLink propagating  the Administration's "new" policy in "post-war" Iraq.  The true folly of the recent--seemingly incongruent--announcements by the Pentagon and the White House is nearly mindnumbing.  Don't these people communicate with one another?  One day after the Pentagon published a directive that excludes countries who did not support the U.S. war effort in Iraq from bidding on $18 billion in American-financed Iraqi reconstruction projects, the President turns around and asks the same countries (France, Russia, Canada, Germany, et.al.)  to forgive and forgo millions of dollars of debt owed them by Iraq.   Even more embarrassing is the fact that the Pentagon published the new directives on its website only hours before Mr. Bush was scheduled to ask world leaders to receive James A. Baker III [sidebar: One can only imagine that phone call: "Daddy....Help!"] who is heading up the effort to resuscitate Iraq's flailing economy and wipe out massive debts.  The White House is on record as saying they were 'surprised' at the timing and blunt wording of the Pentagon's directive.  Which leads one to wonder who exactly is in charge here?   Of course, the Administration has informed protesting countries that they would be eligible for bidding on rebuilding contracts if they would only kindly offer political or military support in Iraq.    I'm so disgusted I don't have the energy to rant over the fact that the United States government is paying the Halliburton Company an average of $2.64 a gallon to import gasoline and other fuel to Iraq from Kuwait--more than twice what others are paying to truck in Kuwaiti fuel.  Talk about your friends in low places...   MEMO TO CBS  Dear Mr. Moonves:  On Wednesday, the National Archives  urlLink released  240 hours of tape recordings from the Nixon Administration.  Among the chesnuts included is the following scintillating conversation between President Nixon and H.R. Haldeman:  " Reagan is not one that wears well, " Nixon said.  " I know ," Haldeman agreed.  " On a personal basis, Rockefeller is a pretty nice guy, " Nixon said. " Reagan on a personal basis, is terrible. He just isn't pleasant to be around. "  " No, he isn't ," Haldeman said.  " Maybe he's different with others, " Nixon said.  " No, " Haldeman said.  " No, he's just an uncomfortable man to be around, " Nixon said, " strange. "   When CBS begins filming its highly-anticipated sequel to "The Reagans", please consider adding this colorful insight to your teleplay.

       THE ABERCROMBIE COVER-UP  On December 2nd, A&F Spokesman Hampton Carney  urlLink announced  that the retailer would pull copies of the  Abercrombie & Fitch Quarterly: Christmas Field Guide 2003  from store shelves to allegedly make room for the introduction of a new fragrance called NOW.  Meanwhile, conservative watchdog groups such as the Cincinnati-based  National Coalition for the Protection of Children & Families claimed victory as having run massive grassroots campaigns threatening the boycott of the retailer if the popular  Quarterly  publication was not pulled from stores.  At the time of these conflicting statements, Carney went to great pains to stress the corporation's official stance:  " All the models are 18 and over and customers have to be 18 and over in order to purchase the issues.  Our spring quarterly will be back in stores mid-January and everyone will see that there's no change in our editorial policy. We will still have butts and partial nudity. "  With over 200,000 copies of each  Quarterly  in circulation (with over half of that figure coming from in-store sales), it's no wonder A&F's 650 outlets prized the publication.  The wonderfully photographed magalog is known for its gratuitous use of nudity and sex, blatant homoeroticism and celebrity profiles. Many argued the latest edition crossed the line of good taste with an article devoted to oral sex.  Whatever the case, it's amazing how Abercrombie & Fitch's tune has changed in a span of a few short days.  On Tuesday, A&F released a public   urlLink statement  announcing the demise of the  A&F Quarterly  altogether and the halting of publication of the apparently offensive holiday issue.  In the carefully worded statement, A&F now says:  " While it has enjoyed success with the Quarterly over the years, the company believes it is time for new thinking and looks forward to unveiling an innovative and exciting campaign in the spring. "   With the recent hoopla over "The Reagans" biopic and CBS's submitting to conservative groups in not airing the program, A&F's decision continues to mark an alarming trend of media and consumer outlets surrendering to pressures from a conservative minority.  As if A&F really had to worry about major revenue loss from a group like the National Coalition for the Protection of Children & Families?  If those parents were so concerned, they wouldn't let their kids wear the clothing to begin with.  What's next?  The demise of Lane Bryant catalogs because plus-size models are offensive to skinny Victoria's Secret models?  A&F knew from the start that the sexuality of their advertising drew their target audiences in.  What they have now done amounts to shooting themselves in the ass--a big, naked ass.   SHIRIN EBADI  The winner of the 2003 Nobel Peace Prize,  urlLink Shirin Ebadi , gave a wonderfully poignant and impassioned speech at the formal acceptance ceremony in Stockholm, Sweeden.  Ms. Ebadi, who is of Iranian descent and becomes the first Muslim woman to ever win the prestigious prize, was careful not to directly name the United States in her remarks.  But, I think they brilliantly and scathingly speak for themselves:  " In the past two years, some states have violated the universal principles and laws of human rights by using the events of September 11 and the war on international terrorism as a pretext.  Regulations restricting human rights and basic freedoms ... have been justified and given legitimacy under the cloak of the war on terrorism. "   " Why is it that in the past 35 years, dozens of U.N. resolutions concerning the occupation of the Palestinian territories by the state of Israel have not been implemented properly?  Yet, in the past 12 years, the state and people of Iraq, once on the recommendation of the Security Council, and the second time in spite of U.N. Security Council opposition, were subjected to attack, military assault, economic sanctions, and ultimately, military occupation? "    THE RULES OF GOTHAM?  A couple of days ago a post on the  urlLink Gothamist  weblog raised eyebrows around the blogging community.  Entitled "Gothamist Notes 1: What Not to Do When You Blog", the post details the 'rules' of blogging.  I'm not sure if it was meant to be taken at face value or with tongue-in-cheek.  What I do know is that I have apparently violated most of the rules in the short few months I've been writing Obliquity.  As with accounting, it appears there is now a "Generally Accepted Blogging Principles" (GABP) manual.  It also appears that I fucking don't care.

       THE SCOOP  According to knowledgeable sources, the first actor to show interest in Ang Lee's next film "Brokeback Mountain" (based on the award-winning E. Annie Proulx short story of the same name) is very close to signing on to the project.  The highly anticipated film tells the story of a love affair between a ranch hand and rodeo star.  The same-sex love story was thought to face a huge stumbling block when it came to casting A-List talent. Obliquity has learned that none other than Joaquin Phoenix is in talks with the Lee as he scouts locations.  The exact role he would play has not been determined.   ROSA PARKS  On Monday, the U.S. Supreme Court  urlLink refused  to hear the case of LaFace Records v. Parks, 03-504.  The silent refusal sends the case back to a Federal Court judge and allows Ms. Parks, the 90 year-old civil rights activist to persue legal action against the R&B/Hip-Hop group Outkast.  Ms. Parks has claimed that a 1988 track entitled "Rosa Parks" violates her rights of publicity and trademark--and further defames her.  The track which appears on Outkast's album " urlLink Aquemini " does not mention Ms. Parks by name in the lyrics but does contain the line "Ah-ha, hush that fuss. Everybody move to the back of the bus."--an obvious reference to Ms. Parks famed act of civil disobedience by refusing to give up her seat on a bus in Montgomery, Alabama in 1955.  Ms. Parks wishes to have all references to her removed from future pressings of the album.  Outkast and LaFace Records claim that song does not violate Ms. Parks rights and is protected by freedom of speech.  The fact that it has long been known that "Rosa Parks" was a song written about the entertainment industry and it's alleged treatment of black artists does seem to lend credence to Ms. Parks claims.  The fact that entertainment artists, who regardless of skin color, make millions of dollars hardly seems a comprable experience that endured by Ms. Parks.  This will be an interesting case to follow.   A WAR OF NUMBERS  Two U.S. bases were  urlLink targeted  by suicide bombers in Northern Iraq Tuesday morning.  At least 43 soldiers suffered injuries from glass and shrapnel.  The continued escalation of rebel forces throughout Iraq should be extremely troubling to the Bush Administration.  Once claiming that major resistance was contained to the Sunni Triangle area, recent days and events have proved otherwise.  The rise of the dead and wounded counts seems to be spiraling upwards.  The discontent of a confused Iraqi citizenry should hardly come as a surprise to the coalition forces.  For each day that occupation continues, that discontent will breed and mutate like a virus.  Unfortunately, the infection rate will be exponential.     While the Administration has signaled a new found desire to leave Iraq as soon as possible, it belies the facts that it faces on the ground.  While they have detested the press use of the word quagmire, it has become just that.  It would be inhumane to pull out quickly.  It becomes intolerable to stay put.  Millions of families will be without loved ones this holiday season.  The future remains murky and by all accounts less than hopeful.   OZZY'S TROUBLES CONTINUE  Coming on the heels of recent admissions that he was molested as a child and that he was indeed addicted to prescription drugs through much of the filming of the MTV show chronicling the misadventures of the Osbourne clan, Ozzy has now been  urlLink injured  in a serious ATV accident on the grounds of his British estate.  Suffering a broken collarbone, several ribs and vertebrae, Osbourne had emergency surgery to repair blood vessel damage caused by the broken bones.    QUICKTAKES  01.

       THAT PESKY BUG  Starting Thursday evening, I could tell something was not quite right.  I was excessively tired and cranky.  By Friday morning, I had a low-grade fever and joint achiness.  Even though I had my influenza vaccination earlier in the season, I apparently had a minor case of the flu--or at least flu-like symptoms.  So I spent most of the weekend in bed.  After a multitude of pills and extended sleep, I'm finally starting to feel like my old self again.  It appears that Texas, New Mexico and Colorado have been hard hit with the influenza virus.  Though predictions are that this could be one of the worst flu seasons across the country in many years.  If you haven't already had a vaccine, you may want to consider getting one.  I used to be one of those who refused to take it.  But after seeing the positive effect it can have on warding off or at least lessing symptoms, I subject myself to the annual poke.   COLTS CORRAL AFC-SOUTH LEAD  The  urlLink Indianapolis Colts  stood their ground in a hard fought victory over the Tennessee Titans on Sunday.  It was an extremely physical game and despite a great push by Steve McNair in the fourth quarter, the Titans fell to the Colts by a score of 29-27.  For the Colts, who are now 10-3 and have what amounts to a two-game lead over the Titans (by virture of winning both of their showdowns), it was a great display of teamwork and gritty effort.  I don't think I've seen a game with more players down with injuries from the hard-hitting play.   urlLink Peyton Manning  was in great form.  Marvin Harrison made an unbelieve one-handed 42 yard catch in the 3rd Quarter.  Mike Vanderjagt kicked five field goals making him 37-for-37 on the season, and three kicks from tying a NFL record.  Meanwhile, the Titans chances soured with four turnovers (three on special teams play).    JOHN MAYER  I've really been listening to  urlLink John Mayer's  "Heavier Things" a lot of late.  Though I have thoroughy enjoyed his prior releases ("Inside Wants Out", "Room For Squares" and "Any Given Thursday"), I think " urlLink Heavier Things " raises Mayer's stature to one of the best musician/writers out there at present.  Engineered by Jack Puig, the album is a tight package of ten quality tracks that drill right into your head.  Among the standouts: "Something's Missing", "New Deep", "Come Back To Bed and "Wheel".  Mayer's Winter Tour will hit New Mexico on February 25th with Maroon5 as the opening act.  I've been a fan of "Songs For Jane" since it's release, so I'm looking forward to both acts and what should be a great show.   COLLATERAL DAMAGE?  The  urlLink deaths  of nine innocent children aged 8 to 12 by U.S. rockets fired from an A-10 in the Ghanzi Province of Afghanistan is going to do little to sell the rhetoric that U.S. and coalition forces are there in the best interest of the Iraqi people and its neighbors.  It also once again brings into question the veracity of intelligence and sources used for these raids that are said to be targeting Al Qaeda operatives and Taliban forces.  The news just never seems to get better.  The U.S. and coalition casualities continue to climb--and who knows how many innocent victims have been claimed in the name of freedom.    ALIAS  * spoiler alert * Bradley Cooper returned last evening to his role of Will Tippin on ABC's  urlLink Alias  in an episode entitled "Remnants".  Sporting a new sleek, beefed up look, Will has been in a witness protection program and now known as Jonah.  Syd seeks out Will when she realizes Will has information she needs to continue piecing together her lost memories.  Bringing back Will was interesting on several counts.  He was given the chance to get the ultimate revenge on Allison (Merrin Dungey).  He and Syd had a sexual interlude (!).  The mysterious St. Aiden is revealed to be none other than Lazarey--the man Sydney supposedly murdered as Julia Thorne.  The evil Sark (David Anders) tracked down Brezzel (David Cronenberg) leaving him to overdose on morphine.  Sark tracks down Lazarey (who is his father) and tortures him to find out where Syd and Will are headed.  Along the way, Lindsey is killed in a double cross engineered by Sloane and a container of human tissue etched with the name Milo Rimbaldi is unearthed. Whew!

       BRIGHT YOUNG THINGS  Out British actor Stephen Fry will unspool his directorial debut in the United States in early 2004 at the Sundance Film Festival.  The film " urlLink Bright Young Things " was adapted by Fry from the Evelyn Waugh novel " urlLink Vile Bodies ".  Featuring a rich cast including Emily Mortimer,  Stephen Campbell Moore, Dan Ackroyd, Jim Broadbent, Simon Callow, Stockard Channing, Richard E Grant and Peter O'Toole, the film is a brim-filled, fast-moving social satire that has been deftly envisioned by Fry.  While the film is set in 1930's Great Britain, it breaks the mold of staid period pieces with dashes of intrigue and laugh out loud humor.  Never have gossip, scandal, cocaine and sex looked so delicious or outrageous.  It's a wonderfully executed film by Fry and I hope that U.S. audiences will have the chance to experience "Bright Young Things".  Sundance runs January 15th through the 25th in Park City, Utah.   QUEER EYE FOR THE BUSINESS GUY  The second week of January will see the roll out of a new magazine entitled " urlLink Echelon ".  The new business magazine intends to profile gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgendered business professionals, as well as relevant business news.  It will debut as a bi-monthly publication with a cover price of $3.99 and will first be distributed in ten key markets.  Publisher Michael Lamb was quoted in a Reuters interview as saying, "We want to be recognized for something other than our political advocacy, our partying and our entertainment.  We do work every day, we do own businesses and we do pay taxes."   THE SIMPLE LIFE  The debut of Fox's latest reality-based program, " urlLink The Simple Life ",  urlLink finished  a strong second in its timeslot according to the network.  The premiere scored an estimated 8.1 rating, which roughly equates to 13 million viewers.  It was runner-up to the second half hour of "JAG".  It's no surprise that the show chronicaling Paris Hilton's and Nicole Richie's travails on an Arkansas farm did garner wins in the key advertising demograhic brackets--winning the highly coveted 12 to 17, 18- to 34-year-old and 18- to 49-year-old age groups.   KRZYZEWSKI RULES  Major props to Coach K. and the   urlLink Duke Blue Devils  for their convincing  urlLink win  over Michigan State, 72-50.   WORD OF THE DAY   urlLink syzygy

He has written extensively on the issues of genetic and biological research in regards to homosexuality--as well as cultural perspectives on such issues as gay marriage.  In today's "Editorial/Op-Ed" section, he writes another fascinating piece entitled  urlLink "Lovers Under the Skin" .  He concludes his thoughtful piece with the following paragraph:  " No force is more divine than love, and if some people are encoded to love others of the same sex, how can that be unholy? To me, the blasphemy is not in those who want to share their lives with others of the same sex, but rather in anyone presumptuous enough to vilify that love.

       TOM CRUISE &  THOSE  RUMORS  In the December 2003 issue of   urlLink Details  , Tom Cruise is the coverstory in an article entitled "Tom Cruise Sets The Record Straight".  Clearly, the interview was given in anticipation of his new film, " urlLink The Last Samurai ".  Offhandedly, the article refers to Mr. Cruise's penchant for lawsuits and those continual rumors of his sexual orientation.  The following passage from that article was intersting to me for several reasons:  " By now, with both lawsuits having been resolved in his favor, Cruise says the questions about whether he is gay should finally fall away.  'Am I? No. Of course I'm not.  If I was, how am I going to win the lawsuit?  If it's the truth, it's the truth. Who cares? If it's true, it's true, but it's not. "  Now, I could frankly care less if Mr. Cruise is or isn't.  However, the faulty logic in his statement is rather glaring.  Obviously, of course he's not.   Whatever.   DO THESE PANTS MAKE MY ASS LOOK BIG?  Someone has created a monster.  An army of poseurs clinging to the label of 'metrosexual'.  Men who are suddenly jamming gaydar signals around the world.  They must be stopped.  They must be killed.  Of course, I'm just kidding.  I think.  But, this weekend I had my fill of metrosexuality.  I attended a function with several colleagues whom I used to work with in the field of risk management (which seems like another lifetime ago).  It was nice to catch up with old acquaintances.  It was, however, something of surreal experience.  Being gay in that field of work was not something that was looked upon very favorably.  For the most part, very few people that I worked with knew that I was gay--and there were very few gays or lesbians in our division.  My colleagues and circle of friends were a mixed group.  Everyone knew who was what and was fine with it.  Most of the time, we kiddingly harrassed one another with off-color sexual innuendo.  For instance, one of my female co-workers knew I had a crush on her husband.  We teased each other mercilessly about my having an affair with him.  My straight male colleagues were (to use a sweeping generalization) your typical 'guys'.  Beer, women with large breasts, sports, and cigars and most of them were happy campers.  By the middle of the 1990's you could sense a shift of sexual politics in the air.  I remember one instance where I took a rash of shit for having had a manicure.  Several months later, a couple of the guys asked where I went to have it done.  Soon the men that could have cared less about their appearance five years earlier were now discussing the merits of Prada versus Gucci--gay and straight alike.  Everyone also had flawless manicures.  While I can only assume that most of the wives were thrilled with the turning tide, most of the homosexuals were mystified.  What exactly was happening here?  Flash forward to this weekend.  After a great dinner and few drinks, the subject of metrosexuals comes up among the group I was seated with (all avowed heterosexuals).  At a table in this college-town pub, the men in the group start comparing shoes.  Secretly, I wanted to laugh out loud.  After listening to several rants about how men in designer shoes are secure in their manhood and a few salacious comments about a waitress, the conversation turned to the pros and cons of eye creme.  That was it.  I could not contain myself any longer.  I cracked up and told the table of guys that they had officially become homosexuals.  After much laughter and some chiding, I decided to push the issue a bit more.  I turned to the guy sitting at my left and said loudly enough for everyone to hear, 'If you are so secure in your manhood, kiss me."  Of course, I was baiting him and the liquor was helping.  Every conversation suddenly stopped and all eyes at the table focused in our direction.  Before I could get the words out to let him off the hook, he reached over grabbed my chin and planted one on me.  Now, it wasn't much of a kiss.  But the fact that he had actually done it, just blew me away.  Needless to say, our new found 'relationship' became the subject of jokes the entire night.  When I was leaving, I pulled him aside and said, "It was okay....but I'd never date you."  We laughed, hugged and said our goodbyes.  Later as I lay in bed, I couldn't get the fact that I'd been kissed by a father of four out of my head.  What' this world coming to?  Damn you, you metrosexuals!

       urlLink     I implore you to take a few minutes out of your busy day to try and wrap your mind around the following figures.  In the calendar year of 2002, AIDS took the lives of 3 million people.  That's 3 million mothers, fathers, children, brothers, sisters, cousins, aunts, uncles, friends, lovers, and partners  that are no longer with us or the ones who loved them.  Taking it a step further, over 8,000 people die from AIDS or HIV/AIDS complications every day. Perhaps even more astounding is the fact that nearly 14,000 new cases of HIV infections occured every single day last year.  The numbers are nearly incomprehensible--and yet they are fact.  Today while you go about your life, take a few minutes to reflect on these mindnumbing statistics.  Consider wearing a red ribbon today to show your support and concern for the 42 million people around the World that are living with and facing a disease with no cure.  Consider lending your time or financial support to a local or national HIV/AIDS organization or charity.  Take time out of your day to make a small gesture in your workplace or home to educate people about HIV/AIDS.  Fight HIV/AIDS discrimination. Whatever you do, just do something.  To that end, this day I use my weblog to offer links to important information, educational issues, facts, useful organizations, and perhaps most importantly, the human face of HIV/AIDS.

       "MAN'S CIVIL WAR"   "Need craves consent of soul to sense,  Yet divers bents breed civil fray; Hard hap where halves must disagree, Or truce halves the whole betray!  O cruel fight! where fighting friend With love doth kill a favoring foe,  Where peace with sense is war with God, And self-delight the seed of woe!  Dame Pleasure's drugs are steeped in sin Their sugared taste doth breed annoy;  O fickle sense! beware her gin, Sell not thy soul to brittle joy!"   ---Robert Southwell

       CASTING COUCH  --Another Phillip Roth book is headed for the big screen.  Director Phillip Noyce ("The Quiet American") will helm an adaptation of Roth's "American Pastoral".  Noyce is currently courting the husband and wife team of Paul Bettany and Jennifer Connelly to take the leads.  Their daughter would be played by Evan Rachel Wood ("Thirteen").  The story of a man and woman living the American dream with a perfect family life unravels as they discover their daughter is a revolutionary terrorist.  If the principals are signed, Noyce is eyeing an early spring start date.  Lakeshore Entertainment (which produced another Roth adaptation, "The Human Stain") is set to produce.  Connelly is currently filming "Dark Water" in Toronto.    --Douglas Adam's cult novel "A Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy" is also making the transition to film.  Mos Def, Zooey Deschanel and Martin Freeman ("The Office") have all signed on to the project directed by Garth Jennings.  The movie is being produced by Disney/Spyglass Entertainment and will begin shooting in London in April.   Deschanel will next be seen in "Eulogy" which screened at Sundance.  --Mike Judge, the man behind "Office Space" and "King Of The Hill" has written a script entitled "3001".  Luke Wilson has signed on in the lead role as a man who participates in a sleep hibernation study only to wake up 1,000 years in the future.  The 20th Century Fox project is also slated for a mid-April shooting launch.    COOKING UP A WAR?  In an interesting piece in  Editor & Publisher , Greg Mitchell  urlLink points out  that a survey of the top twenty newspapers by circulation in the U.S. showed a rather revealing trend and suspicious editorialists.    Editor & Publisher  found that as of Wednesday, thirteen of the twenty newspaper had run editorials on David Kay's resignation as chief U.S. weapons inspector in Iraq and his statement that no WMDs exist in Iraq--and likely did not exist in Iraq during the U.S. run-up to war.    While nearly every paper called for a full probe as to the cause of miscalculations and intelligence failures, eight of the thirteen took it a step further.   While most of the newspapers surveyed had supported the war effort, they raised the issue of White House deceit and its possibly blind pursuit of intelligence that fit its plan for war.  With such a large scale inference of possible deception, it will be interesting to see how the White House and intelligence agencies respond to such charges.   CANDIDATE CAROUSEL  It seems that a series of missteps and gaffs have left the campaigns of General Wesley Clark and Governor Howard Dean with major problems.  Of the two, Dean seems to face more dire circumstances.  Yesterday's  urlLink departure  of campaign manager Joe Trippi is sure to have some negative fall-out and cause a demoralization of his staffers.  Combine the staffing changes with money problems and Dean is left with some major decisions.  At the beginning of the political season, I was eyeing Dean or Clark as my candidate of choice.  Needless to say, I will support whomever eventually gets the Democratic nomination.  Right now, Senator John Kerry seems to have resounding momentum.  Senator John Edwards may have some strength left in southern states.  There is also rumblings of a potential Kerry/Edwards ticket.  It seems that it is time for Kucinich, Sharpton and Lieberman to make a swift exit.  Next Tuesday's primaries and caucuses should be interesting to say the least.

       SOMEBODY'S WATCHING ME  In today's  The Washington Post , there's a bizarre article entitled  urlLink "'Queer Eye' for Big Brother" (pg. A21) .  At first read, it seems to be a bit farfetched to say the least.  As I read it again, I thought it raised some interesting points.  The main thesis of the article is that America's fascination with the current glut of reality television programming--and the desire to participate in such programming--is undermining a fundamental right to privacy.  While I'm not sure I can make the entire leap Susan Murray makes, I do find her thoughts interesting and troubling at the same time.  She also brooches the subject of weblogs and webcams as a sign of our willingness to share so much personal information with perfect strangers.  On one hand, her article definitely identifies a cultural and media phenomenon.  However, the underlying message that we are too willing to let privacy and personal freedoms be corrupted for entertainment purposes--and that such laxity could lead a government agency to use that willingness to encroach upon personal rights--is certainly interesting food for thought.

       HARVEY WEINSTEIN HAS A STROKE  The nominations for the 76th Academy Awards were  urlLink announced  this morning.  The screaming you heard was from the House of Miramax.  The much touted "Cold Mountain" was given a very big cold shoulder.  Despite a massive media campaign spearheaded by Weinstein, "Cold Mountain" failed to capture nominations in the Best Picture, Best Actress and Best Director categories.  While the film did pick up seven total nominations, Weinstein and company are not happy campers today.  The Academy was much more accomodating to Peter Jackson's "The Lord Of The Rings: The Return of the King" giving it a field best eleven nominations.  It appears to be the film with the most momentum and an odds-on favorite to win its share of gold.  A film that had seemingly lost its early buzz--"Master and Commander: The Far Side Of The World"--racked up ten nominations.  Interestingly, neither "Rings" nor "Master" picked up a single acting nomination.  The Academy did an intriguing job of mixing nominations among large budget pictures and smaller fare.  Among the biggest surprises was the nomination of thirteen year-old Keisha Castle-Hughes in the Lead Actress category for her work in "Whale Rider".  Brazilian director Fernando Meirelles was included in the Best Director race for the powerful, but little seen "City Of God".    My sentimental favorites among the nominations: Charlize Theron ("Monster"), Ben Kingsley ("House of Sand and Fog"), Djimon Hounsou ("In America"), Shohreh Aghdashloo ("House of Sand and Fog"), Renee Zellweger ("Cold Mountain").  Among the intersting snubs: Nicole Kidman ("Cold Mountain"), Tom Cruise ("The Last Samurai"), Jennifer Connelly ("House of Sand and Fog") and Russell Crowe ("Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World").

       NOTES ON THE GLOBES  In a usual mix of predictability and surprise, the Hollywood Foreign Press proved once again, you can have an awards show without the ridiculous song and dance numbers.  It was great to see Mike Nichols' "Angels In America" justly rewarded.  Along with winning the best mini-series prize, it won individual acting awards for Al Pacino, Meryl Streep, Mary-Louise Parker, and Jeffrey Wright.  On the television side, the most pleasant surprise was the win of "24" in the best drama category.  On the film side, I was thrilled that Charlize Theron was recognized for her work in "Monster".  Overall, the movie awards were kind of all over the place.  It will be interesting to see what develops when the Academy Award nominations are announced tomorrow morning.   "D" IS FOR DEFECIT  Next Monday, President Bush is expected to send a  $2.3 TRILLION  budget to Congress.  Today, the Congressional Budget Office released a  urlLink report  saying that the federal deficit will hit a record $477 billion this year and get worse if lawmakers cut taxes or increase spending.  This defecit would be the largest ever in the history of the United States.  While President Bush's new spending initiatives outlined in the State of the Union address are indeed modest by historical reference, they certainly do not seem fiscally sound in light of the impending defecit.  Asking Congress to not increase spending or a re-elected Bush to not cut taxes are fantasies at best.  More proof that the elections of 2004 are more important than ever.   WHO DO YOU SLEEP WITH?  I had an invitation to a very enjoyable dinner party on Saturday.  It was a nice mix of friends and strangers who quickly became new acquaintances.  After a superb dinner and several glasses of wine, several varied conversations broke out.  One of the most interesting and vocal crowds was discussing everybody's favorite subject: sex.  I listened for a bit before jumping into the fray.  A conversation that had begun discussing the concept of "metrosexuality" had eventual lead to a discussion of whether it was out of the bounds of reality for an indentified 'straight' man to consider having some kind of sexual relations with another man.  Of course, the main argument was that if a heterosexual male fantasized or partook in a sex act with another man--then he was no longer heterosexual.  This invariably lead to the is-bisexuality-a-real-thing or a cop-out debate.  I have to say, it was rather interesting to listen to a bunch of males and females (most of whom I assume were heterosexuals) have this discussion.  I soon was knee-deep as the only professed homosexual in the bunch.  While the discussion never went out of bounds, it was thoroughly refreshing to see the spectrum of opinions and how they varied by sex.  One of the things that kept running through my head was how interesting it was that there were so many variations on how the terms "sexual orientation" and "sexual identity" were defined.  There were as many opinions as there were intelligent, educated individuals.  When I got home, I was compelled to go searching for some notes I had done researching an article to e-mail to a couple of friends that were at the party.  Some of the most interesting research and thought in the areas of development of sexuality and homosexuality (in my opinion) has been done by the team of Mr. John P. De Cecco and Mr. Michael G. Shively.  One of their tenets defines sexual identity in males and females as having four distinct parts.  They call the first "biological sex" which is the genetic material encoded in chromosomes.  They then identify a "gender identity" which is a psychological sense of being male or female.  After the determination of biological sex and gender identity,  Shively and De Cecco identify a "social sex role" which encompasses an adherence to the culturally created behaviors and attitudes within a sub-group that are deemed 'appropriate' for males or females.  Finally, they see "sexual orientation" as the erotic and/or affectional disposition to the same and/or opposite sex.   After several e-mails back and forth, I think we're set for the next dinner party.

       SINGULARLY SPEAKING  * The second single from the Basement Jaxx's "Kish Kash" going to radio is "Plug It In" featuring J.C. Chasez on vocals.  Simon Ratcliffe and Felix Buxton continue to push the boundaries of tradional electronica.  Fusing pop, modern rock, and dance sensibilities in their music, they then have a knack of picking just the right vocalist to compliment the sound.  On first listen of "Plug It In", one would never guess that the vocals are Chasez.  The beats in this track are killer.  Radio should jump on this one.  But, of late it seems electronica is only embraced by advertising agencies for television commercial soundtracks.  * Club duo of the week:  Pepper Mashay and Colton Ford (Yes, THAT Colton Ford).  Their cover of the Stevie Wonder standard "Signed, Sealed, Delivered" is out on a HS Productions promo.  Somehow Mashay's diva wails combine seamlessly with Ford's agreeable blue-eyed soul vocals.  It really is a suprising mix that should play big in dance clubs.  Already remixed by the likes of Mac Quayle, Ralphi Rosario and Solar City, I wouldn't be surprised to see this single get action on the R&B tracks chart.  * In a short four weeks, the debut album from Darkness "Permission To Land" has bounded from 198-39.  Their first single "I Believe In A Thing Called Love" is getting heavy play on MTV, MTV2, VH1, and FUSE.  Set to impact on February 3rd at radio, this one should be huge.  * Second runner-up on last year's "American Idol" to Ruben Studdard and Clay Aiken, Kimberley Locke is picking up a lot of adds for her Curb Records debut single "8th World Wonder".  The track is a great showcase for her smoky vocals and should raise interest in her debut album.  * Maroon 5 releases the very catchy "This Love" as the follow-up to the single-that-wouldn't die "Room To Breathe".  The more straight-ahead pop sound of "This Love" should continue to drive sales of the long soldiering album "Songs About Jane".

       GENERAL WESLEY CLARK ADVOCATES   urlLink General Wesley Clark  appears on the cover of the February 3, 2004 issue of  The Advocate .  The retired four-star general gives an insightful interview with issues ranging from gay marriage to the military's "don't ask don't tell" policy.  Clark's campaign has been making a strident effort to reach out to younger voters and to show that at 59, Clark is more atuned to social issues than his fellow candidates.  I find his honesty and straightforwardness to be quite refreshing.  Among General Clark's comments:  -- On gays in the military:  " The armed forces are the last institution in America that discriminates against people. It ought to be the first that doesn’t. They ought to have the right to be who they are. They shouldn’t have to conceal their identities. You know, there are different models [that allow for gay people to serve openly]—the British have a model—and there is no impact on combat readiness. It’s a bogus issue. "  -- On gay marriage:  " But whether you call it marriage or not is up to the church or the synagogue or the mosque. And it’s up to the state legislatures. I think marriage is a term of art. It’s a term of usage. But the legal side of it is not: It’s not negotiable. "  -- On state's legislation of gay unions:  " If the state of Massachusetts says we’re going to form a civil union but we’re going to call it marriage, then as far as I’m concerned, that’s marriage.  "  -- On Republican reaction to his views on gay unions:  " Well, they’ll love it. This is exactly what they’re looking for. Newt Gingrich and Tom DeLay and all those guys are looking for a real hand grenade to throw into the Democratic Party. It’s an absurd issue, and it’s one of the reasons I’m running. No one can accuse me of being soft on defense, and no one can accuse me of not knowing about what the armed forces are about. And when I say, “It’s OK,” then it’s OK, period. But elections aren’t always about common sense. And I think [Republicans] would love to frighten people. "        BUZZ ON THE BIZ  --The  urlLink Oxygen  network has signed a deal with the production team of Carsey-Werner-Mandabach for its first foray into a scripted television comedy series.  The show will be entitled "My Best Friend Is a Big Fat Slut".  The series which chronicals the travails of two twentysomething Minnesota transplants to Los Angeles who are pursuing the glamorous Hollywood life was given an eight episode pick-up.  The series will star Joy Gohring and Bree Turner.  -- urlLink Gael Garcia Bernal  has signed on to "The King" co-starring Sam Shepard.  The film set to begin shooting in early March was co-written by Milo Addica ("Monster's Ball").  Bernal will play a dysfunctional young man who returns home after being discharged from the Navy to seek out his estranged father (Shepard), a pastor living in Corpus Christi, Texas with his new family.   Bernal will next be seen in tne new Pedro Almodovar film " urlLink Bad Education ".  --The latest casting news from the set of  HBO's " urlLink Six Feet Under " is that  urlLink Peter Facinelli  will join the cast for a multi-episode arc.  This news comes on the heels of Mena Suvari's casting.  Word has it he will play an art student who will be romantically involved with Lauren Ambrose (Claire Fisher).  --From the set of Fox's " urlLink The O.C. " comes word that Rachel Bilson (Summer Roberts) and Melinda Clarke (Julie Cooper) have been upped from recurring status to regular roles.  --Actor Robin Thomas ("The Banger Sisters", "Clockstoppers") gets a multi-episode run on Showtime's " urlLink Queer As Folk ".  Word has it he will play a potential new love interest for Peter Paige (Emmett).  --The second episode of Fox's "American Idol" brought in 21.2 million viewers and an 11.9 rating/31 share in the adults 18-49 demographic from 8-9 p.m., according to preliminary estimates from Nielsen Media Research. While this mark is down by about 7 million viewers from Monday's premiere, it was still far and away the most-watched program of the night.

       STATE OF DIS-UNION  As much as it pained me, I sat through President Bush's State of the Union address last night.  Words I would use to describe it: bleak, scary, disingenuous, enraging.  The obvious divide in Congress was even more apparent watching the gallery.  While Bush retains high public approval ratings, most of his domestic programs and the continuing conflict in Iraq draw less than favorable numbers.  There in lies the enigma that is George W. Bush.   Between the applause and the gratuitous smirks of satisfaction, I found the following areas of interest:  01.  " We have faced serious challenges together and now we face a choice. We can go forward with confidence and resolve or we can turn back to the dangerous illusion that terrorists are not plotting and outlaw regimes are no threat to us. We can press on with economic growth, and reforms in education and Medicare or we can turn back to the old policies and old divisions. "  The opening salvo and a clear call to political arms.  America does have a choice.  Americans have a choice.  But, will they exercise that choice?  As for going forward with confidence, I can only say that I feel less confident about our country today than I ever have in my lifetime.  It's truly not about having a Republican (or a man I despise) as President.  It's about feeling that our government is making the wrong choices, taking the wrong stands and fighting the wrong battles.  I suppose there is always uncertainty looming in the future.  However, an uncertainty that once was a harbinger or hope for better times and better circumstances for America's citizens and our world neighbors seems to be overcast by doubt and gloom.  Mr. President, most states and some members of your own party do not support your education reforms.  Who's going to get left behind?  While you tout economic growth, where are the jobs for those Americans desperately trying to find work?  You proclaim we are winning the war on terror.  There has not been (nor will there ever be) a victor when it comes to terrorism.  Beyond loved ones and personal freedoms, what else more do we have to give to a fight you started on misinformation?  02.  " Inside the United States, where the war began, we must continue to give homeland security and law enforcement personnel every tool they need to defend us. And one of those essential tools is the Patriot Act, which allows federal law enforcement to better share information, to track terrorists, to disrupt their cells, and to seize their assets. For years, we have used similar provisions to catch embezzlers and drug traffickers. If these methods are good for hunting criminals, they are even more important for hunting terrorists. Key provisions of the Patriot Act are set to expire next year. The terrorist threat will not expire on that schedule. Our law enforcement needs this vital legislation to protect our citizens you need to renew the Patriot Act.  "  All the freedoms that were earned by true patriots are being systematically stripped away.  The provisions of the Patriot Act are hardly akin to provisons for embezzlement and drug trafficking.  You cannot sugar coat a bitter pill Mr. President.  If we as citizens must give up so many of our freedoms to feel safe from terror, should we not fear the overreaching power of the government that was once for and by the people?  03.  " There is a difference, however, between leading a coalition of many nations, and submitting to the objections of a few. America will never seek a permission slip to defend the security of our people.  "  In your list of nations that form this coalition Mr. President, where are major countries like France, Germany, Russia, Mexico, Canada and others?  Why did you not need the authorization or advice of the United Nations prior to declaring war--and now your return like a dog with its tail between its legs for assistance in Iraq?  Why do you insist on blackmailing countries to support your efforts in Iraq with the lure of multi-million dollar contracts?  Characterizing the objections as "few" seems to be at the very least overly optimistic.  Actually, Mr. President, you do need a permission slip from the people of this country.  I guess we'll see if it gets signed in November.  In the end, Mr. President, I could continue listing my objections to your political platform:  from your so-called Medicare reform, to your misguided tax cuts, to your continued contempt of gays and lesbians of our "compassionate" country.  However, the only voice you will ever understand from those that do not agree with your agenda will arise from a ballot box.  Therefore, it is my resolve to do everything 'one vote' can do to make sure you get the biggest pink slip of all.

       DES MOINES DUST-UP  As is usually the case, the Iowa  urlLink caucuses  proved that nothing in politics is a given.  Howard Dean who was at one time was running 20 points ahead of his competitors in Iowa finished a very distant third.  Pundits had predicted surges by the Kerry and Edwards campaigns, but I have to think even the most versed political commentator was taken aback at how much momentum the candidates gained.  With 98% of the precincts reporting, Senator John Kerry won 38% of the vote to Governor John Edwards 32%.   Dean finished with 18% and Gephardt with 11%.  Gephardt appears to be on the verge of pulling out as Iowa was considered a must-have to his campain.  Despite the heavy endorsement of labor, his showing was surprisingly weak.  An argument can be made that the biggest loser Monday night was Governor Howard Dean.  Not only did his massive ground campaign not work, he finished with less than half of Kerry's numbers.   Of course, many assume that he will have a much better showing in New Hampshire (where he currently leads in polling).  However, he will have been forced to take Kerry and Edwards as legitimate competition--as well as General Wesley Clark who bypassed Iowa for New Hampshire.  It is my hope that with Gephardt withdrawing, the others who have no viable chance drop out leaving a strong four candidate field.  After the New Hampshire primaries, one would expect that a two-man race may become more focused.  Whatever happens, it is clear that voters are listening to the candidates.  They seem to be looking for an honest-to-goodness electable candidate.  I think it's fair to say that Edwards is the most articulate of the bunch.  However, he has some areas of weakness when it comes to experience.  Clark & Kerry will likely have an edge in foreign policy and poll well with older voters.  Dean continues to have the financial machine and seems to have tapped into the younger voter.  Can Edwards nice guy campaign continue to work?  Will Dean become his own worst enemy?  Does the seemingly well-rounded Kerry have a flaw to be exploited?  Where will Clark come out with other three going after New Hampshire?  There are seemingly a lot of questions yet to be answered.  However, one thing is certain.  No one is a clear front-runner at this point.   AI3  Add "scat girl" to the canon of all-time worst--and funniest--auditions in " urlLink American Idol " history.

       IOWA SHOWDOWN  One hopes that after Iowa's  urlLink caucus  process begins today, some things will be clearer.  But more importantly, one hopes that endless list of candidates for the Democratic nomination for President will begin to pare down.  If polling data is to be believed, Iowa should come down to a very close race between four candidates.  The perfect outcome would find two front-runners distancing themselves from the pack and heading into New Hampshire to get a good sense of who the ultimate nominee will be.  Unfortunately, it appears that the percentage difference in the top four will be minimal.  This will allow the candidates who finish at the top to claim at least a partial victory.  The top four finishers should be Dean, Gephardt, Kerry and Edwards.  Iowa has shown that Dean is not the forgone nominee as was once thought.  Edwards (mostly) non-negative campaigning and surge in the polls shows that people are indeed tired of the infighting.   Right now, the biggest threat to a strong Democratic contender leaping from the fray is the candidates themselves.  Instead of sniping about one another, there needs to be a focus on issues and what changes a Democratic President would bring to America.  It's time to stop shooting the messenger and let the message resonate with the electorate.  Only by showing a clear differentiation with and a viable alternative to President Bush's policies will a Democratic nominee be able to mount a realistic challenge to the re-election of Bush.   RAY STARK  Legendary movie producer, talent agent and Hollywood deal broker  urlLink Ray Stark  passed away at the age of 88 on Sunday.  Stark who crediting with discovering Barbra Streisand performing in a New York nightclub and convinced a reticent Columbia Pictures to cast her in her Academy Award winning role in "Funny Girl". (Incidentally, Fanny Brice was Stark's mother-in-law.)  Stark was notable for helping to bring at least eleven productions with Neil Simon to the big screen including "The Sunshine Boys", "The Goodbye Girl" and "California Suite".  Stark's famed production company, Rastar, was also responsible for box-office hits like "Steel Magnolias", "Peggy Sue Got Married", "Smokey and the Bandit" and "The Electric Horseman".   Surprisingly with all his success, Stark never was awarded an Oscar.  He was, however, given the Irving G. Thalberg Memorial Award for a lifetime of achievement in film by the Academy in 1980.  Stark also won an Emmy for his production of "Barbarians At The Gate".     TEN GREATEST GAY MOVIES  In the February issue of  Out , the magazine's staff assembles a list of the films they deem as the ten greatest gay movies of all time.  Their choices:  01.  "Beautiful Thing" (1996; Director: Hettie MacDonald) 02.  "The Wedding Banquet"  (1993; Director: Ang Lee) 03.  "Boys Don't Cry"   (1999; Director: Kimberly Peirce) 04.  "The Adventures Of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert"  (1994; Director: Stephen Elliott) 05.  "My Beautiful Laundrette"  (1986; Director: Stephen Frears) 06.  "Parting Glances"  (1986; Director: Bill Sherwood) 07.  "Heavenly Creatures"  (1994; Director: Peter Jackson) 08.  "About My Mother"  (1999; Director: Pedro Almodovar) 09.  "Desert Hearts"  (1986; Director: Donna Deitch) 10.  "Sunday Bloody Sunday"  (1971; Director: John Schlesinger)  After perusing their list and thinking about it for a while, I cannot fault them on their top five picks.  Number one and two would be my picks in that order.  Personally, I would probably swap "My Beautiful Laundrette" and "The Adventures Of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert".  As for the other five picks, I think there is room for argument.  "Sunday Bloody Sunday" would probably rank higher on my tally.  There are also several glaring omissions in my opinion.  Films that I would consider putting in my top ten include "Gods & Monsters", "Strawberry & Chocolate", "Kiss Of The Spiderwoman", "Better Than Chocolate", "Bound", "Die Bitteren Tranen der Petra von Kant", "Boys In The Band", "Hedwig & The Angry Inch", "Bent", "Angels In America", "Go Fish", "Law Of Desire", "Ma Vie En Rose", "Before Night Falls"--to name a few.    QUICKTAKES  01.  The Indianapolis Colts crumbled under the strong New England defense.  It was not a fun game to watch. 02.  Does Matt Drudge pick the MOST unflattering pictures of subjects who grace his propaganda report? 03.  Picked up Seasons 1 & 2 of "Alias" on  DVD.  Loves me some Jennifer Garner (and the guys aren't bad either). 04.  Latest movie recommendations:  "In America", "The Fog Of War", "The Station Agent". 05.

       HOLDING BACK THE YEARS  Two years out of high school, I remember hearing Mick Hucknall's unique voice for the very first time.  In short order, I purchased their debut album "Picture Book".  I remember endlessly listening to the album and finding a strange comfort in the fusion of great music and sorrowful songs.  Hucknall's voice became instantly unforgettable.  Though, the success of the band waned rather quickly in the U.S., they continued to record solid albums and have success around the world.  Last August, their latest album,  urlLink "Home"  was released to minimal fanfare in the U.S.  The record label tried to float two tracks--the title track and "Sunrise"--to radio with minimal results.  However, their luck may be about to change.  As he did with a cover of Howard Melvin & The Blue Notes' "If You Don't Know Me By Now", Hucknall wraps his soulful voice around another gem--The Stylistics' "You Make Me Feel Brand New".  The track is being released as the next single.  It's a perfect showcase for Mick Hucknall's voice.  The original recording is found on "Home".  However, there is a great maxi-CD to seek out.  It contains the single edit of the track and video.  It also features two super remixes of the song:  "Antillas Vocal Edit" and "Love To Infinity Radio Mix".  If radio gives this single a chance, I think it might deservedly spark sales of "Home" and renew interest in Simply Red.  Check it out if you can.

       PEACE AND BREAD IN TIME OF WAR  Jane Addams was a remarkable woman for many reasons.  Born in the 1860 to a promininent Cedarville, Illinois family, Ms. Addams lead a life quite different from her upbringing.  By the time of her death in 1935, she was a noted social reformer, feminist, peace activist and writer.  Ms. Addams left her original field of study in medicine and traveled extensively in Europe with her partner, Ellen Gates Starr, in the early 1880's.  While in England, the duo discovered settlement houses--homes located in city slums where social workers "settled" to provide services to the surrounding community. In 1889, Addams and Starr founded the renowned  urlLink Hull-House  in Chicago. By 1900, Hull House was a hub of political, educational, and social activity, drawing over two thousand visitors a week. Its success brought Addams widespread acclaim and launched a nationwide settlement house movement.   Over the course of her life, Addams wrote four major books.  She concerned herself with the ethical and sociological effects of the burgeoning industrialization on immigrants and the working poor.  She used her fame to champion the causes of poverty, adverse working conditions, and poor urban women who were forced into prostitution.  She opposed U.S. involvement in World War I.  Her organization--American Union Against Militarism--would become the precusor to our modern day American Civil Liberties Union.  Ms. Addams was awarded a Nobel Peace Prize in 1931.  Throughout her life, Ms. Addams found purpose in referring to herself as a "Tolstoyan anarchist".   The reason for the improptu history lesson is that I recently re-read Ms. Addams' book " urlLink Peace and Bread in Time of War ".  It was her eighth book overall, and its strong call for pacifism was extremely controversial upon its publication in 1922 at the height of the so-called "Red Scare".  She was villified by politicians, patriots and citizens alike.  Yet, her look at the roles of memory and myth in women's lives at the time gives a wonderful historical and social  perspective.  The book also details attacks by the press and develops passionate defenses of her political idealogy.  Eighty-two years later, there is a lot of Ms. Addams' discourse that still seems relevant and intriguing.    While I was reading "Peace and Bread in Time of War", I started to do a little more research on Jane Addams' life and work.  Concurrently, it seems that politics and thoughts of war have been prevelant in my head (and perhaps in this weblog) of late.  Going through texts of some of the speeches that Ms. Addams gave, I ran across one that was presented at a Chicago Liberty Meeting on April 30, 1899.  The speech was entitled "Democracy or Militarism".  I found her words in the opening of this speech to be oddly striking.  She said:  " None of us who has been reared and nurtured in America can be wholly without the democratic instinct. It is not a question with any of us of having it or not having it; it is merely a question of trusting it or not trusting it. For good or ill we suddenly find ourselves bound to an international situation. The question practically reduces itself to this: Do we mean to democratize the situation? Are we going to trust our democracy, or are we going to weakly imitate the policy of other governments, which have never claimed a democratic basis?  The political code, as well as the moral law, has no meaning and becomes absolutely emptied of its contents if we take out of it all relation to the world and concrete cases, and it is exactly in such a time as this that we discover what we really believe. We may make a mistake in politics as well as in morals by forgetting that new conditions are ever demanding the evolution of a new morality, along old lines but in larger measure. Unless the present situation extends our nationalism into internationalism, unless it has thrust forward our patriotism into humanitarianism we cannot meet it.  We must also remember that peace has come to mean a larger thing. It is no longer merely absence of war, but the unfolding of life processes which are making for a common development. Peace is not merely something to hold congresses about and to discuss as an abstract dogma. It has come to be a rising tide of moral feeling, which is slowly engulfing all pride of conquest and making war impossible.  Under this new conception of peace it is perhaps natural that the first men to formulate it and give it international meaning should have been workingmen, who have always realized, however feebly and vaguely they may have expressed it, that it is they who in all ages have borne the heaviest burden of privation and suffering imposed on the world by the military spirit. "  In her words, I find a sense that at times our country gets lost in the minutia of partisan politics.  When I look at the world around me today, I'm frustrated and disheartened--as I suspect many are.  But the tragedy of this is that too many of us take our democratic duty too lightly.  At a base level, it's not about being Republican or Democrat--or any other political affiliation.  It's about what you want this country to be like.  It's about how you envision this country interacting with our neighbors.  It's about deciding whether you are pleased with the status quo or that you must demand change.  But most importantly, it's about thinking that one vote, one voice can still make a difference.  It is through the words and actions of people like Ms. Jane Addams that a sense of hope and the wonder of possibility still exist.  The power of our government still ultimately resides with and in the people.  Register to vote.  Take stock and look at choices.  Do something.

       GOING TO THE CHAPEL  Rumors had been surfacing that high-level staffers in the Bush Administration had been holding 'strategy' meetings with conservative and religion-based groups to formulate an election year campaign  urlLink in defense  of the sacred institution of marriage. (Insert Britney Spears joke here.)  Sit down and hold yourselves you heathen GLBT people.  The federal government is planning to spend  $1.5 BILLION  dollars to make sure you freaky homos don't try and slip one over on the hallowed sanctity of marriage.  What will taxpayers get for their dollar?  A plan to implement training to help couples (read: heterosexual) develop interpersonal skills that sustain "healthy marriages".  Yes boys and girls, you may not have a right in this great country to marry--but you'll be picking up the tab for some much needed marriage counseling.  Oh, but we're just starting.  Conservatives are pushing the Bush Administration to add language to next week's State of the Union address calling for a constitutional ammendment prohibiting the horror of same-sex marriages.  What's even scarier is the fact that the White House is seriously considering it.  But, I suppose it's not only GLBT people who are being belittled.  A presidential staffer had the gall to state that much of the $1.5 billion dollars would be earmarked specifically for "low-income couples".  Apparently high-income heterosexual couples have no marital problems.  I've never been a fan of President George W. Bush or his Administration.  But, I now find them both to have sunk to a level so reprehensible that I am actually ashamed to live in a country governed by these people.  I'm sure the homophobes will send me letters telling me to leave the country if I don't like it.  Ooh, yeah! Good one.    The real problem here is that my country left me.   THE HOT LIST  01.

       EASIER SAID THAN DONE  The original goal of the U.S Administration of handing over blanket authority to an interim Iraqi government by a  urlLink June 30, 2004  deadline is looking highly questionable.   The main stumbling block is as it has always been--exactly what the compostiion of this interim democratic government would look like.  In a crushing blow to the Bush Administration, the revered Shiite Muslim cleric Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani rejected a proposed plan of using complex caucuses around the country to select an interim legislature and executive in a newly self-governing Iraq.  The ayatollah is demanding that any Iraqi representatives that deal with the U.S. government and the withdrawal be openly and directly elected by all Iraqis.  One can infer that this demand comes as sixty percent of the Iraqi population is Shiite Muslim.  The ayatollah and his followers fear that any caucus system would not fairly represent the true balance of Iraq's population.  Add to this situation the fact that relations between L. Paul Bremer III and Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani are said to be cooling by the second.  Further, to hold a truly democratic election census rolls, voter registration records or other means to certify a democratic vote would first have to be established with U.S. assistance.  All of the above also discounts the fact that Kurdish leaders are calling for an independent territory.  There in lies the major problem with the U.S. military intervention in Iraq.  What was done to liberate a people and country from a tyrannical leader was done under the guise of establishing a burgeoning democratic state for the peoples of Iraq.  Yet, the U.S. political realization is that the majority of the citizens of this country want the U.S. to withdraw as quickly as possible.  With the violence of insurgents still plaguing U.S. forces in Iraq, the Administration's hurry to turn over the power to interim government seems self-serving at best.  Ironically, the major justification for going into the war in the first place is the exact reason why the U.S. cannot pull out quickly--or turn the power over to Iraq's people without their being at least the appearance of any such transfer being done in an equitable and representational fashion.    Iraqis rightfully want an open and transparent method of establishing a new government.  The differences harbored--justly or not--by Shiites, Muslims, Kurds and others will not be easily overcome.  The U.S. wants out as soon as possible to avoid further casualties, the sprialing price tag of the war, and perhaps most sadly, because it is politically expedient in an election year.  Yet, any attempt at a fledgling democratic government that is set up without support of a majority of its people will collapse under its own weight the moment the U.S. transfers power.  So with the June 30 deadline looming, a critical juncture quickly approaches.   CAPPS 2 = MORE CRAPP TOO  The latest  urlLink innovation  from the Department of Homeland Security--the cutely acronymed CAPPS 2 (Computer Assisted Passenger Prescreening System)--is yet a further assualt on personal freedom in the name of national security.  Soon every person who boards an airplane in the United States will have a computer generated file with identification information (i.e. "everything the government always wanted to know but was none of their damn business").  Tracking such tidbits as where you are going, whether you paid cash for a ticket, how often you fly, if you fly alone and whether you have a criminal record, the most heinous aspect of the new system is a color coded ranking given to you based on this information.  Yes Americans, you will either be designated a red, yellow, or green flight risk.  Of course, the government spin is that this will help the consumer by speeding up the security process at the airport.  Just don't ask how they determined your ranking and what is done with that information.  Is anybody out there listening and watching this crap?  Are you not outraged?  Are you not frightened?   Look, I'm all for fledgling democracy in Iraq--but what the hell is happening to our own?   FROM THE POLITICAL NOTEBOOK  01.  If one more pundit says that Howard Dean's anger is a political liability, I'm going to explode.  Look around people, there is a lot to be angry about. 02.  There are just too many candidates for the Democratic Presidential nomination.  If after Iowa, a majority of them don't bow out gracefully there will be major problems for the Democrats. 03.  It's the economy stupid.  Oh and that little war you started.  But I'm sure going to the moon is the right thing to do right now Mr. President.   "LIFE FOR RENT"  " but if my life is for rent and I don't learn to buy well I deserve nothing more than I get cos nothing I have is truly mine " ---Dido Armstrong   CASEY STRATTON  On January 20th, Casey Stratton's debut album "Standing On The Edge" is released on the Odyssey/Sony Classical label.  The 25 year-old Stratton has an angelic voice and is a classically trained pianist, violinist and cellist.  His voice has an ethereal beauty that is often mistaken for a female voice.  You can hear clips of the 12 track album at his  urlLink website .  The gorgeous "For Reasons Unexplained" looks to be the first cut to AC radio.  Not everyone's cup of tea, but it's truly an amazing debut.

       I HEART MICHELLE KWAN  Saturday night in Philips Arena in downtown Atlanta, the exquisite Michelle Kwan  urlLink won  her eighth U.S. Figure Skating Championship--her seventh in a row.  After a slight bobble on a double axel in the short program, Kwan was in second place going into the free skate.  Both Dick Button and Peggy Fleming picked Sasha Cohen to win at the outset of the evening much to my chagrin.  With a look of passionate determination and swathed in a spectacular coral braided Vera Wang costume, Michelle Kwan struck her opening pose as the gorgeously sorrowful strains of Giacomo Puccini's "Tosca" began.  In what may have been the most moving, exquisite program I have ever seen her skate--and one that should go down in history as one of the defining moments of the storied U.S. Championships--Ms. Kwan was radiant and mesmerizing.       After her last triple toe jump was securely landed, she sped down the middle of the ice in an inspired straight line footwork sequence that sent shivers down the spine and set the crowd into a frenzy.  As she sat in the kiss and cry area with her new coach Rafael Arutunian, you knew something special was about to happen.  As her technical merit scores lit up the boards with a row of 5.9s and 5.8s, there was little doubt she would retain her crown.  When the presentation marks flashed seven perfect scores of 6.0, even Dick Button could not contain himself.  Michelle Kwan had just received her 35th perfect score of 6.0 in the U.S. Championships.  To realize the breadth of her excellence, the person in second place with the most perfect marks is Brian Boitano with 9.  I've since watched the performance about twelve times and it does not fail to excite and enchant me each time.  The beauty, grace, athleticism and inner fire that Ms. Kwan possesses is simply breathtaking.  I love you Michelle Kwan--and I'm not afraid to admit it.

       AN OPEN LETTER FROM MADONNA  The text of an open letter published on  urlLink Madonna.com  yesterday:   "I've never done this before. But life is about taking risks is it not?   I know that people seem to pay attention to everything I do. Big or Small. Ridiculous or Sublime. So I am hoping they pay attention to this:   I am supporting General Wesley Clark for President.   Not only as a "celebrity" but as an American citizen and as a mother. I want my children to grow up with the same opportunities that I had--to know and understand what's going on in the world and to travel that world safely and with pride.   Now I'm asking you to join me.   I am writing to you because the future I wish for my children is at risk.   Our greatest risk is not terrorism and it's not Iraq or the "Axis of Evil." Our greatest risk is a lack of leadership, a lack of honesty and a complete lack of consciousness. Unfortunately our current government cannot see the big picture. They think too small. They suffer from the "what's in it for me?" syndrome. The simple truth is that the current administration has squandered incredible opportunities to bring the world together, to promote peace in regions that have only known war, to encourage health in places that are ravaged with disease, to make us more secure by living up to our principles at home and abroad. The simple truth is that the policies of our current administration do not reflect what is great about America.   Thankfully, there is now a candidate running for President who is committed to ensuring that our country lives up to its promise and its people. He is a decorated soldier and a respected diplomatic leader, who has already given 34 years to his country. He is smart and he is good. He has worked hard to get where he is and he is a national hero.   A perfect example of the American Dream.   I've never aligned myself with a presidential candidate during the primary season. But this time, the stakes are too high, we have too much to lose and there is so much work to be done.   I'm supporting General Wesley Clark in 2004 and have committed to do all that I can to help his campaign in the coming months. I ask you to visit his website today to learn about his candidacy, his vision for our nation and the many ways you can get involved.   I've looked at all the Democratic candidates. I respect them all for their dedication and patriotism. But I'm supporting Wes Clark because in him I see the qualifications, character and vision that we so desperately need.   We are a country with incredible promise. As Americans we enjoy opportunities like no other. Unfortunately we take these opportunities for granted. You may not agree with everything I say or do, but whether you're rich or poor, young or old, black or white, gay or straight, I know you share my concern and recognize the need for change.   Even if you've never been involved with politics before, please consider joining with me. If you can give, give generously. If you can volunteer time, get involved now. And if you can vote, this time... make sure you do.   Wesley Clark has asked for my support and now I'm asking for yours   Madonna   PS: Please spread this message to everyone you know.

       A NEW YEAR...RESOLVED  Back in December, remember when I found your voice on my answering machine?  You felt like talking....after all this time.  I listened to your message a few times.  The voice was inviting--like that favorite cashmere sweater.  I just want to wrap myself in its luxurious softness.  But sooner or later, you have to take it off.    I did not return your call.  I did write the number you left on a slip of colored paper and threw it in the back of a desk drawer.  I'm not sure why.  Nostalgia?  Self-flagellation? Stupidity?  Yesterday, I cleaned out my desk.  It was time to file all of my workpapers from last year.  Reorganize the research I need to work on.  Update pending projects.  A fresh start for the New Year.  I threw away that piece of colored paper.  No regrets.    THE HOT LIST  01.  Andy Towle of  urlLink TOWLEROAD .  The beauty on the oustside is eclipsed only by the soul inside.  I love his photography. 02.  The January 18th premier of Showtime's " urlLink The L Word ".  Jennifer Beals has never been hotter. 03.  Louis Crompton's  urlLink "Homosexuality and Civilization" .  Don't let the 623 pages scare you.  It is time well spent. 04.  The Crystal Method's " urlLink Legion of Boom ".  I received an advanced copy this weekend and it's a sonic tapestry.  Awesome guitar work from Jon Brion and Wes Borland. Vocals from Milla Jovovich, Rahzel, and John Garcia (featured vocal on the lead single "Born Too Slow").  Look for the Erick Morillo remixes.

       THE MYTH OF FIRE PRINTS  An article in yesterday's  The New York Times  entitled " urlLink A Firehouse Culture Where Taunts and Teasing Flourish " bothered me immensely when I first read it in the morning.  A day later, it still bothers me.  The story itself it troublesome enough.  Until an investigation is completed and any charges filed, the exact sequence of events will remain cloaked in a tenuous brotherhood of silence.  The case involves two NYC fireman.  One taunted the other about his sexual orientation.  The other made charges of misuse of seniority and power.  What happened after that results in two sides to the story.  What is not in question is the fact that one of those firefighters is in the hospital on a respirator having had facial bones shattered and his nose partially severed by a metal chair.  The other firefighter is in jail and his fifteen year career in a Staten Island firehouse is in question.  The article points out several instances where an environment of verbal sparring and youthful immortality help define a culture that fosters camaraderie.  Yet, the microscosm that is the firehouse points out a larger truth of males sharing close space.  Whether it be in a firehouse, a fraternity, a workplace or a prison, there is no escaping the roles gender and sexual orientation play in an inherent pecking order established by nothing more than chromosomes and testosterone.  One of the striking quotes in Michelle O'Donnell's piece is by a retired deputy fire chief, Vincent Dunn:  " "Everybody verbally abuses young firefighters.  Nobody wants physical violence--that's a no-no. But there's a lot of verbal abuse. It's like society. "  It's like society.  Even if you can at some base level tolerate the fact that verbal abuse is acceptable, you still have to get around the problem of why a question of one's sexuality--especially that of a male--is the easiest target for abuse.  If you do happen to be a male who is self-identified as anything but heterosexual, the verbal abuse is used to belittle and lessen your worth as a man.  You are somehow less of what it means to be male in the group you are identified with.  If you are heterosexual and someone questions that fact, you are being embarrassed and your manhood is questioned.  You are somehow a lesser man than those taunting you.  Though very different instances, the net effect is comprable.  The easiest place to hit is below the belt.    By virtue of a penis (and where you put it), you've been characterized or defined as a stereotype.   If your muscles aren't big enough, you might be gay.  If your muscles are too big, you might be gay.  If you don't play along with the verbal abuse, you might be gay.  If you don't respond to the verbal abuse, you might be gay.  If you get angry at the verbal abuse, you might be gay.  But if you don't get angry enough...  Challenging someone's masculinity based on their place on the sexual spectrum is a game of folly at best.  Yet, it is the easiest and surest way to elicit a response.  Trying to use sexuality as a measure of a man's worth is mythical at best.   OBLIQUITY'S TOP TEN FILMS OF 2003  01.  Cold Mountain 02.  House Of Sand And Fog 03.  21 Grams 04.

       IT'S A FREE COUNTRY...UNLESS  There was a great  urlLink article   in yesterday's  San Francisco Chronicle  regarding freedom of speech and the Bush Administration.  It seems that wherever President Bush travels and is going to speak, there is an advance team of Secret Service agents who visit the location ahead of any speaking engagement.  Their mission is to coordinate with local law enforcement to create "free speech zones" or "protest zones".  These zones amount to a quarantined area where people opposed to Bush policies (and even at times sign-carrying supporters) are quarantined. The objective is to keep protesters out of presidential sight--and more importantly, outside the view of media covering the event.   The article details many disturbing incidents where people's rights to protest and the freedom of speech are clearly stretched to their limits.  It's amazing to me that as the Bush Administration continues to push itself as the purveyors of democracy on an international front, it continues to uproot so many long-standing rights within our country.  It seems the notion of national security is being confused with political security.  When did speaking out against the administration's policies and activities become a threat to national security?  The ACLU, along with several other organizations, is suing the Secret Service for what it charges is a pattern and practice of suppressing protesters at Bush events in Arizona, California, Connecticut, Michigan, New Jersey, New Mexico, and Texas (among others).   Once again, I am left dumbfounded and deeply disturbed by the continuing pattern of oppression dictated by the current administration.  When are people going to wake up?   WHY ONE SHOULD NEVER DRINK IN LAS VEGAS  It seems that everyone's favorite "Ms. I'm-Not-So-Innocent" has  urlLink done  it again.  Oops!  Never one to pass up a great public relations orgy, it seems Britney Spears has beaten the Bennifers to the punch.   At 5:20 a.m. on Saturday morning, Ms. Spears visited the Little White Wedding Chapel in Las Vegas and proceeded to get married to a Louisiana hometown boy.  While Ms. Spears' flack was quick to point out that she was NOT drunk and was having a "good time" (no doubt in the zone), by Saturday afternoon reports that an annulment was in the offing began to swirl.  Good times, indeed.   NATIONAL SOCIETY OF FILM CRITICS WINNERS  As the race for the all-important Academy Award nominations heats up, the National Society of Film Critics had their  urlLink say  Saturday night.  Their pick for Best Picture was the critically lauded " urlLink American Splendor ", which took the prize besting "Mystic River" and "Lost In Translation".  Though his film finished as runner-up, the Best Director award was given to Clint Eastwood for his helming of "Mystic River".  In the acting categories, Bill Murray ("Lost In Translation") and Charlize Theron ("Monster") were victorious.  In supporting roles, the awards were given to Patricia Clarkson ("Pieces Of April", "The Station Agent") and Peter Sarsgaard ("Shattered Glass").  Shari Springer Berman and Robert Pulcini won the screenplay award for "American Splendor", which tells about the comics and life of Harvey Pekar.  The success of "American Splendor" throws a new curve into the pre-awards leading up to Oscar.  Theron, Clarkson and Sarsgaard were my early picks in this year's derby.   US-VISIT  In another questionable move by the Department of Homeland Security, starting  urlLink today  any visitor to the United States with a visa will be asked to provide fingerprints and photographs.  Failure to do so will result in a denial of entrance to the United States.  The goal of the United States Visitor and Immigrant Status Indicator Technology (US-VISIT) is being touted as an effort to combat terrorism. The program has been appropriated $380 million. It will require an estimated 24 million visitors to submit two finger scans and have a photograph taken upon entering any of 115 airports or 14 seaports.  One has to wonder what the U.S. plans to do with all of this information--much less keep track of it all.  But more importantly if the U.S. does not know a foreign visitor is a terrorist prior to entering the country, what good with having their information on file do?    GOSFORD PARK  I re-watched Robert Altman's delicious  urlLink "Gosford Park"  this weekend.  While the movie purports to be a murder mystery, it is much more about the interplay of its characters and the division of classes.  Altman's use of the upstairs/downstairs plot device to propel the story is at once hilarious and fascinating.  With a slew of wonderfully talented actors, it's a great ensemble piece.  I'd highly recommend the Collector's Edition of the DVD which is filled with some great commentaries and deleted scenes.  Gorgeously filmed and punctuated with Ivor Novello's music, it's a great movie to curl up with on a gusty Sunday.   A PRICKLY TALE  A major Hollywood entertainment publication has a story it's sitting on.  It seems that during the filming of one of this year's major Oscar hopefuls, a romance bloomed on set between the star and a supporting cast member.  While this is hardly news in Hollywood, it's the who in this story that is proving to be a potential drama.  I'm sure the fact that it's a same-sex romance has nothing to do with it.  Tabloid Alert.......Word.   INDY  Despite all of critics who had ruled the Indianapolis Colts out in their  urlLink rematch  with the Denver Broncos, I knew that they would come back with some new tricks after their humiliating loss two weeks prior.  In pre-game, Peyton Manning admitted he stayed home on New Year's Eve watching tape.  In a nearly perfectly played rout, the Colts dominated 41-10.  Peyton Manning (co-MVP of the League) was flawless throwing for touchdowns on each of the Colts' first four possessions. He finished 22-of-26 for 377 yards and five TDs.  When he left the field in the fourth quarter, Manning had a perfect passer rating of 158.3 for the second time this season.  Next week, they're on the road to Kansas City.

       I FEEL THE EARTH MOVE  In 1972, the " urlLink leap second " came into the lexicon of scientists and astronomers around the world.  To deal with the phenomemon of Earth slowing in its orbit around the sun, it became necessary to add an extra second at the end of each calendar year so that the world's official time would agree with where the Earth is actually in space.  For 28 years, the procedure was followed.  Then in 1999, the curious discovery was made that the Earth was exactly where it was supposed to be--it was right on time.  As 2004 dawned, scientists confirmed that the pattern has repeated itself for the fifth straight year.  While the exact cause of this phenomenon is fodder for debate, there has been speculation that a reason could lie in tidal patterns , weather anomalies or changes at the Earth's geophysical core.  Of course, the issue of millenia makes for great human interest.  Just another of Earth's little mysteries.   COUPLING  One of the gifts I received for Christmas was the DVD set of the BBC comedy series " urlLink Coupling ".  Of course, this is the same series that NBC had banked would be the heir to the "Friends" throne.   But somewhere in the Americanization, things went horribly wrong.  I think I watched most of the first episode when it debuted on "Must See TV" Thursday and found it humorless and cloying.  On New Year's Day, I decided to sit and watch the original with some trepidation.  A few hours later, I came to the conclusion that sometimes the U.S. entertainment industry needs to leave well enough alone.  The original six epidsodes of the 2000 U.K. series were absolutely hilarious.  The characters were all memorable and endearing in their own right.  The writing is pitch perfect and I've instantly become a great fan of the show.  In retrospect, I think NBC's first mistake was trying to "convert" British humor.  So much of the wit and spice of the series was definitely lost in translation.  Secondly, the casting for the U.S. series was horrible.  The ensemble of Jack Davenport, Sarah Alexander, Ben Miles, Kate Isitt, Richard Coyle and Gina Bellman is sheer perfection.  Like some rare delicacy, I'm rationing series two--afraid to finish it before the third series is released in the U.S.  I'm pleased to see that their will be a fourth series (set to start filmining in January 2004) of six episodes in the future.  Along with that news, comes word that terrrific Richard Coyle has left the cast at the end of season three.  'Jeff Murdock' will surely be missed.  I'd highly recommend the U.K. series, if you haven't had a look.  (Miscellanea:  As I watched I couldn't help shake the feeling that I'd seen Jack Davenport before.  It wasn't until around episode four that I remembered his turn in "The Talented Mr. Ripley".  I believe he's also in "The Pirates Of The Caribbean: The Curse Of The Black Pearl" which I have yet to see.)   WORLD IDOL  Kurt Nilsen of Norway was  urlLink crowned  "World Idol" of Fox's Christmas Day competition of winning idols from countries around the world.  Nilsen carried the vote in nine of the eleven countries participating (including the U.S.) on the strength of his uncanny cover of U2's "Beautiful Day".  Each country was prohibited for voting for their own entrant.  Strangely enough, the 25 year-old former plumber was told he looked 'like a Hobbit' by one of the panel of judges.  Original U.S. idol Kelly Clarkson was the runner-up.  The results show also featured performances by Victoria Beckham and Elton John.  Season three of " urlLink American Idol " bows January 19th.   GTV  According to statistics  urlLink released  by the Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation (GLAAD),  from a total of 674 leading or supporting actors on current prime-time broadcast sitcoms and dramas, eleven are gay characters.  These statistics are slightly lower than the previous television season.  More interesting than the numbers are Scott Seomin's (Entertainment Media Director for GLAAD) remarks regarding gays and stereotypes.  The gist of Seomin's comments is that while many television portrayals are indeed stereotypes associated with GLBT people, the exposure of the characters to mainstream America is more important than any detriment from stereotyping.   Seomin makes the point that gay characters have gone from being laughed at to being the ones doing the laughing.  Seomin on the "Queer Eye For The Straight Guy" phenomenon:  " "Carson (of the Fab Five) is a real guy. This is who he is. He is not acting for the cameras. I wouldn't want him to be anything but Carson, which happens to be fabulously flamboyant. Stereotypes are based in truth and humor. "  Another issue raised in the article is the fact that gay characters on broadcast television usually fit into the same demographic of being white, male, celibate and affluent.  GLAAD argues that lesbians are victims of a glass ceiling phenomenon whereby the the abundance of male, white writers works against a truthful portrayal of a lesbian on television and highlights the need for more lesbian writers.

       THE CONSTITUTION OF A MAN       Something changed in my own constitution today.  For the longest time whenever the subject came up, I always claimed that I did not have a strong opinion one way or the other on the issue of same-sex marriage.  I've always said that if two same-sexed individuals wanted to marry, they should have the right to do so.  I've always believed that same-sex couples should be entitled to the legal and economic privileges held by heterosexual couples by virtue of marriage.  But, until today, it really never struck me on an emotional level.  Being single--and perhaps a bit jaded when it comes to love--the issue of marriage never really impacted my present day life.  A strange thing happened this weekend.  I was fortunate enough to cross paths with a wonderfully loving lesbian couple who'd been given a marriage license by the clerk of Bernalillo County.  Being a fellow New Mexican and a writer, their story interested me.  They graciously gave of their time to answer my questions and be interviewed for a writing project.  Listening to their story and seeing pictures of their wedding, as well as their two children, touched me in ways that words could probably never convey.  They love one another.  They love their two children.  They have a happy, healthy family.  They were so proud of that single sheet of paper.  Today as I watched President Bush make his remarks on the subject of gay marriage, I thought of L. & C.  I thought of the radiant joy they had as they recounted details of their wedding.  I watched our President say words that filled me with a profound sadness.   I was angry.  I was repulsed.    I kept seeing their wedding photos flip through my memory.  Yesterday, President Bush urged Congress to begin the process of enacting an amendment to the Constitution of the United States to prohibit same-sex marriage.  Yesterday, President Bush spat on L. & C.'s marriage license.  Yesterday, President Bush made anyone who is not of heterosexual orientation a lesser class of people.  President Bush said:   "After more than two centuries of American jurisprudence and millennia of human experience, a few judges and local authorities are presuming to change the most fundamental institution of civilization."   (A full transcript of Mr. Bush's remarks may be found  urlLink here .  I urge you to read them in their entirety.)  I've always thought and believed that the fundamental institution of civilization was a government.  The Constitution was written as the fundamental law of the United States.  Since 1787, that document has driven our form of government--democracy.  A government by the people, exercised directly or through elected representatives.  A government that is both a political and social unit.  A government built on the principles of social equality and respect for the individual within a community.  The Constitution abolished slavery.  The Constitution gave women the right to vote.  The Constitution gave us protection from unlawful search and seizure.  The Constitution is an amazing document.  Now, the sitting President wants that document to be amended for the sole purpose of taking away rights and privileges from anyone that does not adhere to a heterosexual union.  Politically motivated, entwined in hate and bigotry, the President of the United States wants to trample the tenet of "equal protection under the law".  To dismiss this action as merely a "gay" issue would be a tragic mistake.  It should alarm every individual who believes in our system of government.  The issue is more than a religious interpretation of marriage.  It's about saying to a class of people, "I'm sorry, but you don't deserve equal protection under law because of who and what you are".  Meanwhile, advocates of banning same-sex marriages toss phrases like "sanctity of marriage", "institution of marriage", "protection of families" to disguise a called for legislated discrimination.  The phrases and rhetoric make for great soundbites.  But, what does the "sanctity of marriage" really mean?  At the end of the day whether you are for or against gay marriage, you must ask yourself if this issue rises to a level of concern warranting a constitutional amendment.  Do you believe love can only occur between people of opposite gender?  Do you think a gay family is a danger to society?  Is a gay family a danger to your family?  If gays are allowed to marry, will our government fall?  All I can tell you is that I believe--more than ever--in L. & C.'s right to love one another and demand equal protection for one another and their children.  I refuse to become a second-class citizen.  I refuse to sit by idly while a President continues to misuse his power and office.    I have to believe that my fellow citizens are smarter than what their current government gives them credit for.  I have to believe that people want change.  I have to believe that GLBT individuals and those who love them will show up in voting booths in record numbers.  I have to believe that President George W. Bush will not be allowed to serve another term.  I have to believe that my constitution is your Constitution.   A THOUGHT   "Change has considerable psychological impact on the human mind. To the fearful it is threatening because it means that things may get worse. To the hopeful it is encouraging because things may get better. To the confident it is inspiring because the challenge exists to make things better.

       INTELLIGENTLY SPEAKING  In today's  The New York Times  there is a startling  urlLink piece  written by James Risen and Eric Lichtblau which alleges that the CIA was given crucial information regarding one of the 9/11 hijackers as much as much as two and half years prior to the terrorist attacks.  German intelligence officials are said to have supplied the first name and telephone number for Marwan al-Shehhi (who would later pilot Flight 175 into the South Tower of The World Trade Center) to CIA operatives.  German officials became aware of al-Shehhi and his connection to a Queda terrorist cell that was based in Hamburg during a telephone wire tap.  After turning over the information, the Germans say they never heard from the CIA again until after September 11.  It also appears that the U.S. failed to follow-up on the supplied information.  If the information on al-Shehhi had been pursued, the CIA would have learned that his roommate was none other than Mohammed Atta.  While it would have obviously taken a bit of work, the first name and phone number should have led covert agents right into the heart of a major Queda terrorist cell.  According to sworn testimony in a German criminal case related to the September 11 attacks, Mr. Shehhi was one of only four members of the Hamburg cell who knew about the attacks beforehand.  Obviously, what nearly everyone had suspected may indeed turn out to be the truth.  There was a major failure of communication on the part of U.S. intelligence agencies and a failure to share information.   Sadly, the question remains--what if?   SCENE FROM A NIGHTSTAND        WEB DIVERSION OF THE WEEK  That sounds hauntingly familiar... urlLink Let Them Sing It For You    RANDOM THOUGHTS  01.  Free Martha Stewart! 02.

       NADER NADIR  Like the good media whore he is, Ralph Nader took to NBC's "Meet The Press" on Sunday to  urlLink announce  that he would run as an Independent candidate for the U.S. presidency.  Mr. Nader (with a straight face) said:   "After careful thought and my desire to retire our supremely elected president.  I've decided to run as an independent candidate for president.  The liberal intelligentsia has allowed its party to become a captive of corporate interests."   If Mr. Nader wanted us to believe for one second that it was his desire to "retire" President Bush--he would have never announced his candidacy.  His presence only serves to muddy waters and dilute the message of the Democratic Party.  I have to wonder if the RNC didn't pay him to run.  After turning off the Green Party, Nader is reduced to running as an Independent.  One can only hope that the lack of a functional party system proves to be detrimental to Nader's egotistical delusions.    Nader continued to drop phrases such as "corporate-occupied territory" and "two party duopoly" at each chance he was given.  Unfortunately, Mr. Nader, I do not believe your intentions as are noble as you would have us believe.  If your past record is any indication, you crave the media attention and "exposure" to push your beliefs and causes that are unsavory to both major political parties.  Challenging the status quo is not a bad thing.  Screwing up a presidential election (as many have claimed with the results in Florida and New Hampshire in the last election) should not be a vanity project.  I can only hope that undecided and uncommitted voters are not as gullible as you would have us believe.    THE IDIOCY JUST KEEPS COMING...  I still catch myself having this curious mix of disgust and wonder every time I see or hear of the governor of California.  What were you people thinking?  If the man could fit any more movie metaphors into any speech he gives, I'd swear the capitol is a movie set.  Governor Schwarzenegger's latest  urlLink appearances  on the Sunday talk circuit were quite amusing.  In Mr. Schwarzenegger's highly-polished political opinion, he believes that he and other foreign-born citizens should be eligible to run for the White House.  The thought of a foreign-born citizen being president doesn't scare me.  The thought of a President Schwarzenegger scares the holy crap out of me.  The man's been a governor for what three months and he's ready to be president?   Governor Schwarzenegger also made claim that President Bush can carry California in November if he does more to help the state.  Nothing like offering a quid pro quo on national television over breakfast.  President Bush is probably on the telephone to Sacramento as we speak.

However, I think they speak for themselves.  President George W. Bush's  urlLink comments  on gay marriage at a press conference:   "I have watched carefully what's happening in San Francisco, where licenses were being issued, even though the law states otherwise.  I have consistently stated that I'll support law to protect marriage between a man and a woman. Obviously these events are influencing my decision."    "I am watching very carefully, but I am troubled by what I've seen."    "I strongly believe marriage should be defined as between a man and a woman. I am troubled by activist judges who are defining marriage."    "People need to be involved in this decision.  Marriage ought to be defined by the people not by the courts. And I'm watching it carefully."    HBO CONTINUES TRAILBLAZING  HBO has greenlighted an adaptation of the OBIE winning play " urlLink Lackawanna Blues " by Ruben Santiago-Hudson.  The project will star Jeffrey Wright (who was brilliant in HBO's "Angels In America"), Rosie Perez, Liev Schrieber and Halle Berry (an executive producer on the project).  The film adaptation will be helmed by George C. Wolfe.  "Lackawanna Blues" was originally performed as a one-man show by Santiago-Hudson.  He played more than 20 eccentric characters in a vivid recollection of growing up in a boarding house outside Buffalo, New York.   NOCTURNAL  Last night by happenstance, I found myself in a hotel bar.  Not that liquor establishments are foreign to me, but I am not a barfly by habit.  What was different is that I was alone.  Usually when I'm in a bar, it's as part of group of friends.  But being stag in a bar is an interesting experience.  You start to view its inhabitants and the goings-on in a different light.  After a long day of presenting at a workshop, it seemed like the right thing to do.  Regardless of its downside, liquor does have a way of relieving that gnawing tension that resides between your shoulder blades.  After a couple of drinks at the bar, I chatted with the cute bartender.  I talked to a few familiar faces from the workshop.  Exchanged a few hellos with complete strangers.  The muscles began to relax.  I think it's safe to say that there is some kind of correlation between the loss of that tension and a loss of overall inhibition.  After a bit, I found myself playing that strange game of eye contact with a guy sitting diagonally from me.  We looked.  We smiled. We glanced.  Eventually he brought his drink and body to the seat next to mine.  We introduced ourselves, made small talk and eventually started some overt flirting.  He was very attractive. I was very interested.  I swear for about thirty seconds, I wanted to throw my better judgment aside and just ask the guy to leave the bar then and there.  But, that momentary jolt you get from throwing caution to the wind quickly fades.  I am so not a one-night stand kind of guy.  I sometimes think I wish I was.  After all, it would be much simpler than being a guy who wants a connection on something more than a physical or sexual level.  Even under the influence of alcohol--and obvious interest on his part--I knew it would not be my thing.  We talked a bit longer and then I went up to my room--alone.  I don't think it was about some big moral victory.  It was more about the fact that I can't betray who I am.  At the same time, it was about acknowledging that I miss the affection from and crave the touch of another man.  As enjoyable as it might have been surrendering to a mixture of alcohol and lust, the consequences of doing so would far outweigh any sensory satiation.  I went to bed with a sad truth:  I'm not a slut.  I just play one on television.

       SOCIAL LABORATORIES  The editorial page of today's  The New York Times  takes on the issue of gay marriage in a piece entitled " urlLink Gay Marriage in the States ".  The piece concisely summarizes the issues and makes the argument that a national discussion on gay marriage is underway in earnest.  They compare recent actions in Massachusetts and California to an experiment done in a social laboratory.  Drawing on a quote by Supreme Court Justice Louis Brandeis in which he said he believed that the states should serve as social laboratories for the nation,  The New York Times  makes the case that change is occurring and ordinary citizens are beginning to accept that their fears are unfounded.  Perhaps, the editorial staff's stance is a bit optimistic, but one cannot deny the power of their proclamation:   "This page fully supports the right of gay men and lesbians to marry, and we believe that in time they will have this right across the nation."    THE QUESTION IS WILL HE KEEP HIS JOB?  Of all the global and national issues facing everyday Americans, perhaps none has a bigger direct impact than that of unemployment.  No matter what else is going on in the economy or on Wall Street, the fact remains that a lack of jobs directly impacts the wallets and lives of Mr. & Mrs. Joe Q. Public.  To that end, the economy--and more specifically jobs--have become a huge issue in the upcoming election.  According to an annual economic report by the White House Council of Economic Advisers released last week, the projection was made that 2.6 million new jobs would be created by the end of the calendar year.  President Bush was quick to pick up this number and run with it--touting the figure at public appearances across the country.  While most private sector analysts are of the opinion that the forecasts in this report are far too rosy, the report quickly became campaign fodder.  However, it now appears that maybe the administration was not of such a united front.  On Tuesday speaking in Oregon and Washington, both Treasury Secretary John W. Snow and Commerce Secretary Donald L. Evans  urlLink distanced  themselves from that report.  Both men tactfully declined to endorse the White House projections.  Instead, they seemed to urge a note of caution that such projections were made with models based on many assumptions and included the potential for a wide margin of error.   While both men agreed that there should be an upswing in job numbers, they refused to give concrete numbers.  Their hesitation should certainly be seen as a measure of skepticism for the report and President Bush's assertion.  Regardless of what transpires, by the end of the year expect job creation and unemployment numbers to be a major stumping point for at least one of the major political parties.

       NICHOLAS & ALEXANDRA  I was excited to see that Santa Fe, New Mexico will be one of only three U.S. cities to host a traveling exhibit entitled " urlLink Nicholas and Alexandra: At Home With the Last Tsar and His Family ".  The exhibit is set to feature more than 200 pieces of art and decorative items from the Alexander Palace.  The exhibit will also visit Newark, New Jersey and Cincinnati, Ohio.  It will be in my state from May 29th through September 5th.  I've long been a student and great fan of Russian history--predominantly Czarist Russia.  I have quite an extensive collection of books and objects related to the Romanovs and Peter Carl Faberge.  I'm looking forward to seeing this exhibit.   THE HOT LIST  01.  Air's " urlLink Talkie Walkie ".  After the disappointment of their last album, "10,000hz Legend", JB Dunckel and Nicolas Godin return to form.  The ambient soundscapes that were found on "Moon Safari" permeate this album.  However, I dare say this album is more sophisticated and accomplished.  It's one of those rare albums that can make you forget everything around you for a little while.  Standout tracks include: "Venus", "Cherry Blossom Girl", "Biological" and "Alone In Kyoto".  There is a limited edition version that includes a 35-minute film of interwoven footage and performances of Air on tour.  A live version of "La Femme d'Argent" makes it a must have.    02.  Barry Harris' mash-up track "Everybody Wants You To Emerge" on the " urlLink Queer Eye for the Straight Guy: What's That Sound? " soundtrack album.  A delicious merging of Billy Squier's "Everybody Wants You" and Fischerspooner's "Emerge", it's hard to imagine the track working at first thought.  But, it does--and it's great.  03.  Teresa Heinz-Kerry.  Aside from the fact that she may one day be First Lady, Ms. Heinz-Kerry is a woman after my own heart.  Her combination of intelligence, tell-it-like-it-is honesty and dry sense of humor make for engaging interviews.  04.  Rory Cochrane & Adam Rodriguez of CBS's " urlLink CSI: Miami ".  Look, it's not my fault I keep having that recurring dream about Tim Speedle and Eric Delko--and the handcuffs.   05.   urlLink Altoids Tangerine Sours .  Addiction, pure and simple.   THE NOT LIST  01.  Mel Gibson: Crying with Diane Sawyer will not make "The Passion of the Christ" any more pallatable.  Keep your moral crises to yourself.  02.  Matt Drudge:  His fervor to find skeletons in John Kerry's closet is laughable.  Drudge needs to have sex and stop worrying about finding the next Lewinsky.  03.  NASCAR:  I just don't get it.  Bush gets it.  I rest my case.  04.  Dr. Phil McGraw:  I fear he's taking over television--one channel at a time.  Get that pate off my television screen. Now!  05.  Fox Network:  They've taken reality telivision programming to some real lows, but "The Littlest Groom"? C'mon.

       MEDIA QUICKTAKES  01.   urlLink Steven DeLuca  has been named the new publisher of  Rolling Stone  magazine.  He moves from associate publisher of  Vanity Fair  to his new post on February 17th.  DeLuca replaces Rob Gregory who left for a post at  Maxim .  Rumor has it DeLuca was Jann Wenner's second choice for the post.  Wenner actively tried to lure William Wackermann of  Details  to no avail.  02.   The American Prospect  has an interesting  urlLink on-line piece  regarding the outing of CIA operative Valerie Plame.  In it two anonymous government officials claim that they have told the FBI that conservative columnist Robert Novak was asked specifically not to publish the name of undercover CIA operative Valerie Plame in his now-famous July 14 newspaper column. The two officials claim that they warned Novak that by naming Plame he might potentially jeopardize her ability to engage in covert work, stymie ongoing intelligence operations, and jeopardize sensitive overseas sources.  For his part, Novak stated in a September edition of CNN's "Crossfire":  " Nobody in the Bush administration called me to leak this.  In July, I was interviewing a senior administration official on Ambassador [Joseph] Wilson's report when he told me the trip was inspired by his wife, a CIA employee working on weapons of mass destruction. Another senior official told me the same thing.  When I called the CIA in July, they confirmed Mrs. Wilson's involvement in a mission for her husband on a secondary basis ... they asked me not to use her name, but never indicated it would endanger her or anybody else. "  03.   Slate  has a scathing  urlLink critique  of Judith Miller and her reporting for  The New York Times  on the issue of weapons of mass destruction.    A MUST-HAVE      I have mentioned the debut album from  urlLink Casey Stratton  previously.  "Standing At The Edge" has not left my CD player since its release.  It is a beautifully written and constructed album from a very unusual singer/songwriter.   First, the voice is a strange--but haunting--concoction of Tori Amos, Sarah McLachlan and Darren Hayes of Savage Garden.  The album was masterfully produced by Patrick Leonard.  The twelve tracks on  urlLink "Standing at the Edge"  were all written by Stratton and form one of the most cohesive, beautiful musical tapestries I've heard in quite some time.  Leonard is at his best crafting drum tracks and layers of sound over Stratton's gorgeous piano tracks and dulcet voice.  The emotional honesty of Casey Stratton's lyrics is moving.  The first single shipped to radio is "For Reasons Unexplained".  The song is a gorgeous lament of a relationship and a man that have lost their way.  Most of the album is comprised of ballads and mid-tempo pop tracks.  Among the standout cuts are : "House of Jupiter", "Contagious", and masterful "Blood".  However, my favorite cut on the album has to be "Hollow".  I have to sheepishly admit this song literally moved me to tears with its message and beauty.  You can hear snippets of the entire album on his website.  Give it a listen.  It's one of the first truly great albums of 2004.

       DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE SEEKS AN ABORTION  The  urlLink consequences  of the  urlLink Partial Birth Abortion Ban Act of 2003  are starting to rear their heads in very ugly ways.  Supposedly enacted to stop a type of late-term abortion, many opponents saw the intent as a tool to chip away at a woman's fundamental right to choose.  I have always believed that reproductive choices must ultimately belong to a woman.  No man, nor any government, should have the right to legislate whether (or in what conditions) a woman may or may not have an abortion.  It is not a question of legality, morality or religion.  It is simply the fundamental right to control one's own body.  Now, it is apparent that the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act is being used for more sinister purposes than preventing a woman's right to choose.  The Department of Justice has demanded of at least six hospitals in several states to have access to the medical records of hundreds of women who have had abortions in that facility.  Of course, the Department of Justice has said it wants only "certain" records--but is typically unclear as to what those are.  It states that it must have this information to "defend" the new law.  The ramifications of this action are an affront to the rights of women everywhere in this country.  The Department of Justice wants to examine the medical histories of dozens of the doctors' patients in the last three years.  Lawyers claim the access is necessary to determine whether the procedure of intact dilation and extraction (as it is medically referred to) were in fact medically necessary in those cases.  How can the government actually expect to search retroactively through the personal medical histories of women who may not even know their records are being analyzed?  When did the Department of Justice gain the medical expertise necessary to evaluate late-term abortions to deem them as being necessary?  What exactly would they need this information for--and perhaps more frightening, what would they do with said records.  The sweeping conservative tide that has been ushered by the Bush Administration is slowly, but surely, undermining every right to privacy that our government is sworn to protect.  While this issue is still being wrangled in district courts, the fact is that it amounts to an intrusion of doctor/patient confidentiality.  It invades a woman's personal medical information, interactions with her physician, and her decision to have an abortion.   Even more disturbing is the line of reasoning that the Department of Justice is using to gain access to these records.  Their claim is essentially that there is no federal common law protecting physician-patient privilege.  Further, they claim that modern medical practice and the growth of third-party insurers means that "individuals no longer possess a reasonable expectation that their histories will remain completely confidential."  My disgust is perhaps best summarized by this comment from Mr. David Seldin, spokesman for  urlLink NARAL Pro-Choice America , an abortion rights organization:  " This notion of John Ashcroft poring over medical records in a fairly unprecedented type of fishing expedition is exactly the type of privacy invasion that worries people.  The government just shouldn't be involving itself in private medical decisions and second-guessing doctors' ability to advise their patients properly. "  It is most definitely a time for change.

       SIX FEET UNDER  Previously announced cast additions to HBO's " urlLink Six Feet Under " have included Mena Suvari (who will play a fellow art student who befriends Claire Fisher) and Peter Facinelli (as a potential love interest for Claire).  Both actors signed on for multi-episode arcs.  The series which has been filming it's fourth season under creator and executive producer Allan Ball is set to begin airing this summer on HBO.  Though a firm date has not been set, look for the show to return in early July.  Now comes word of another cast addition--James Waterston ("Live From Baghdad").  The son of "Law & Order" veteran Sam Waterston, James will play the son of George Sibley (James Cromwell) who was married to matriarch Ruth Fisher last season.  Again, Waterston's role is a multi-episode arc.  Word has it father and son have a rocky relationship.  Finally, for those of you that mourned the passing of Lili Taylor's Lisa, word has it that the actress will appear in several of the upcoming episodes--and not in a way you might first expect.   POLITICAL NOTEBOOK  With wins in Tennessee and Virginia, Senator John Kerry seems to have unstoppable  urlLink momentum .  The Democrats hope that Kerry's strong showing in southern states will at the very least make Republicans work harder for states that are usually tradtional strongholds.  General Wesley Clark is slated to announce that he is exiting the race today in Little Rock.  That leaves hold-outs Kucinich and Sharpton (who should by any stretch of the imagination be gone) and Senator Edwards and Governor Dean straggling along.  While it's obvious that Edwards still has momentum under his belt, the rumors of a proposed Kerry/Edwards ticket continue to get stronger and will probably limit the rhetoric of both campaigns aimed at one another.  Governor Dean  has nearly fizzled out.  After announcing he would drop out after Wisconsin without a win, he now claims he will forge ahead with a groundswell of internet support.  The problem for Dean is that support is not translating into voting booths.  Several political pundits have again murmured about the possibility of Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton as a possible Kerry running mate.  While I think that would add an interesting dimension to the race, I don't think Clinton would accept if she ever got the offer.  I do believe she is eyeing 2008 as a possible White House run.    Finally, the chairman of the 2004 Democratic national convention, Governor Bill Richardson,  has issued a statement calling for the troops to start closing the ranks:  " The time has come to rally around Senator Kerry.  He has won in every region of the country, and we should unite behind him. "  Next up, Nevada and District of Columbia caucuses on Saturday.    THE NEW MATH  01.  A "family values" psychiatrist recently started a communal home for gay men who wanted to be turned straight. The men all shared the household chores. What is the amount of time (in microseconds) it took for one of these clients to begin hallucinating that he was Liza Minnelli taking out the garbage at the Betty Ford Clinic?  02.

On my dance card:  "Bang On"--Purple Kitty f/Latanza Waters (Hex Hector Vocal Mix) "Free Your Elefants"--Celeda vs. Friburn & Urik "Real Love"--Deborah Cooper (Rosabel's Fireball Anthem Mix)  "Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger"--daft punk  (Neptunes Remix)   DEADLINE FOR MY MEMORIES  " good times were too good to be true and the times we've had were the times we've had we tried, to find the game to be cruel and try we did and cry we did, yeah and when I cried baby, I cried rivers over you  so stay with me, don't fade on me I thought I need this vision there's a body on the floor that looks like me - no words to say, no faith to praise no hope, no good intentions I've been sitting like a toy staring restlessly oh that's why  that is the reason that's why our time is over this is the deadline for my memories that is the reason why we can't see each other the view is fading with our eyes too blind for tears " ---Billie Ray Martin

       RANDOM NOTES FROM THE GRAMMYS  01.  I'm still trying to figure out what the concept for the stage design was.  The lighting director should have been fired. 02.  The overwhelming "retro-ness" of the evening was  rather bizarre.  I was waiting for someone to bust out Bing Crosby. 03.  Prince's opening the show with Beyonce was decent.  Certainly not sublime, as Prince can be. 04.  Whoever paired up presenters and performers was obviously under the influence of narcotics. 05.  "Speakerboxxx/The Love Below" was deservedly crowned Album of the Year. 06.  The whole Beatles on "The Ed Sullivan Show" was a protracted affair that was never really given any history. 07.  Maybe it's just me, but Sting, Dave Matthews, Vince Gill and Pharrell Williams doing the Beatles? Together? Uh, no. 08.  I'm 108% sure that Beck was on crack. 09.  The Church Of Funk. Yikes!  Samuel L. Jackson as a minister scared the hell out of me. 10.  EWF, OutKast, Robert Randolph, George Clinton, Parliament, et.al. was overkill and painful on the eyes. 11.  Does anyone under the age of 21 even know what funk is? 12.  The Luther Vandross tribute was uneven.  Girl Patti LaBelle was trying too hard.  Alicia Keys was okay; Celine's audio snafu regrettable. 13.  Did Mary J. Blige steal that outfit from Big Bird? 14.  Biggest Surprise of the Night: Coldplay's "Clocks" being named Record of the Year. 15.  It's interesting the most political moment of the night was Chris Martin's reference to John Kerry. 16.  Justin Timberlake's win for "Cry Me A River" was deserved.  His performance of "Senorita" with Arturo Sandoval was not deserved. 17.  The best performance of the evening: Beyonce's living picture performance of "Dangerously In Love". 18.  Ms. Beyonce's five Grammys tie her with Alicia Keys, Norah Jones and Lauryn Hill for most wins by a female. 19.  Best New Artist winners Evanescence was somewhat of a surprise (thought at least they are new). 20.  50 Cent's improptu stage romp during Evanescence's acceptance speech was just tacky. 21.  Jason Alexander & Snoop Dogg? Please.  Would all the P.I.M.P.S. please leave their stemware at home. 22.  Weirdest combo to actually work:  The Foo Fighters and Chick Corea 23.  Christina Aguilera's performance of "Beautiful" was wonderful.  Though what was she wearing? 24.  I'm pretty sure Jack White of the White Stripes needs some Xanax badly. 25.  The whole five-minute delay thing was stupid--and unnecessary. 26.  Janet Jackson mentions: 2  (Christina Aguilera; Patti LaBelle) 27.  Pathetic Moment of the Night: Justin Timberlake's apology during his acceptance speech. 28.  At 3:30, the show was too long. 29.  With no disrespect intended to the dead, why is it Grammy continues recognize individuals after they are dead--and not before? 30.  What was up with Quentin Tarrantino?  What a moron. 31.  Most Self-Serving Intro of the Night: Madonna (introducting Sting & Sean Paul for a bizarre performance of "Roxanne") 32.  The They-Almost-Stole-The-Show Award: The Black-Eyed Peas performing "Where Is The Love?"  33.  Overall, the show just left me sort of numb.   MEET THE BUSH  For those that missed President Bush's appearance on "Meet The Press",  urlLink here  is a transcript of the show.  Considering that the show was not taped live (as is the norm) and not held in the studio, I thought Bush had a less than stellar appearance.  I should note that the transcript actually comes off better than his actual appearance.  Now perhaps I have a healthy bias, but answers like "Yeah" and "You know I don't testify" came off as rather dumb.  His lack of eloquence was rather startling.    Perhaps Peggy Noonan's piece for  "The Wall Street Journal"  summarizes it  urlLink best :  " The president seemed tired, unsure and often bumbling. His answers were repetitive, and when he tried to clarify them he tended to make them worse. He did not seem prepared. He seemed in some way disconnected from the event. When he was thrown the semisoftball question on his National Guard experience--he's been thrown this question for 10 years now--he spoke in a way that seemed detached. "It's politics." Well yes, we know that. Tell us more.  "   THAT OL' FEELING  Recently, several of the bloggers I read on a daily basis have discussed that interminable question: "To partner or not to partner".  This weekend I had my own reoccuring bout of "lack-of-partner blues".  Though I imagine no matter what your sexual orientation is, finding the mythical "one" is not always an easy endeavor.  Yet, I somehow think that it becomes even more difficult if you are a homosexual.  Having had two serious relationships in my life (that both ended with cheating), I know that I carry some war wounds to the heart.  However, as painful as those experiences were, it makes my heart long no less for someone to share my life with.  I think I'm at that point in my life that age seemingly becomes a ticking clock that is slowly unwinding.  Whether it is fair or not, I can't help but think that I'm going to fall victim to a law of diminishing returns.  That I'm getting too old to find Mr. Right.  Yet, I convince myself that Mr. Right is the only piece of my puzzle that is still missing.  It's a strange thing to me because many a time a friend will remark that we shouldn't aspire to reflect heterosexual relationships.  I suppose I can see some merit in that argument.  At the same time, what I want and desire does somewhat mimic my straight counterparts.  Is it so wrong to want to have a relationship based on monogamy?  To want to share your home and life with a soul mate?  To grow old with a person who makes you a better man?  In the end, I say it has very little to do with wanting to be like anyone else.  It's about wanting to be me and finding what I want.  At my center, I can safely say that I am a true romantic.  That after heartache and heartbreak, I still long for and believe in love.  Is that unrealistic?  I'm not sure.  Does it give me hope? Yes.  Having been alone for a while now, I can't say that I've not enjoyed the solitude.  Sometimes we all need space and time alone and away from our heart.  I don't think you can commit to a relationship of any kind until you are ready for it.  But, simply wanting it--and finding it are two separate beasts.  This weekend was one of those times.  The time when the weather out is chilly and the winds are howling.  The time when you're curled up on the couch and you realize more than anything you want someone to hold on to, to snuggle with.  One of those times when your bed seems especially large--and empty.  One of those times where you long for touch.  When your fingers yearn to touch skin.  When your soul feels partly empty.  When something or someone is missing.  It's in these times that I realize how much I miss having a partner.  As many times as I've told myself that I'm okay alone being alone (and I believe it to be fact),  it somehow rings hollow in times when you crave the flesh and soul of another.  Tomorrow is another day.

       THE "M" WORDS  Massachusetts and marriage.    In the Massachusetts Supreme Court Opinion  urlLink #SJC-09163 , one particular paragraph stands out for me:  " The bill's absolute prohibition of the use of the word "marriage" by "spouses" who are the same sex is more than semantic. The dissimilitude between the terms "civil marriage" and "civil union" is not innocuous; it is a considered choice of language that reflects a demonstrable assigning of same-sex, largely homosexual, couples to second-class status. The denomination of this difference by the separate opinion of Justice Sosman (separate opinion) as merely a "squabble over the name to be used" so clearly misses the point that further discussion appears to be useless.[4] Post at . If, as the separate opinion posits, the proponents of the bill believe that no message is conveyed by eschewing the word "marriage" and replacing it with "civil union" for same-sex "spouses," we doubt that the attempt to circumvent the court's decision in Goodridge would be so purposeful. For no rational reason the marriage laws of the Commonwealth discriminate against a defined class; no amount of tinkering with language will eradicate that stain. The bill would have the effect of maintaining and fostering a stigma of exclusion that the Constitution prohibits. It would deny to same-sex "spouses" only a status that is specially recognized in society and has significant social and other advantages. The Massachusetts Constitution, as was explained in the Goodridge opinion, does not permit such invidious discrimination, no matter how well intentioned. "  Someone's finally had the intestinal fortitude to say it.  The issue of gay and lesbian marriage is much more than a semantic choice between "marriage" and "union".  The Massachusetts Supreme Court has clearly stated that a mere choice of words would give gays and lesbians a "second-class status".  Their carefully worded opinion tackles nearly any conceivable challenge that opponents of gay marriage have predicated on defining nuances between marriage and union.  It goes so far as to point out the folly of the dissenting opinion that if there really is no difference between marriage and civil union, why would they try to go around the court's decision by solely tinkering with language.  It truly is a bold statement and certainly a moral victory for proponents of gay marriage.  Of course, it goes without saying that President Bush and conservative groups are now gearing up to challenge this ruling.  An official  urlLink statement  was released by the President after the ruling.  His response:  " Today's ruling of the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court is deeply troubling. Marriage is a sacred institution between a man and a woman. If activist judges insist on re-defining marriage by court order, the only alternative will be the constitutional process. We must do what is legally necessary to defend the sanctity of marriage. "  Even more outlandish are statements by conservative talking heads.  In today's   urlLink The New York Times  , the president of the Family Research Council, Mr. Tony Perkins had the following to say:  " This case will determine the future of marriage throughout America.  If same-sex couples `marry' in Massachusetts and move to other states, the Defense of Marriage Act will be left vulnerable to the same federal courts that have banned the Pledge of Allegiance and sanctioned partial-birth abortion. "  Nothing like bringing the totally unrelated issues of the Pledge of Allegiance and partial-birth abortion into the fray.  I suppose homosexuals are responsible for those actions as well?  A women I find utterly repulsive, Ms. Sandy Rios of Concerned Women for America, takes it one outrageous step further:  " If the court is allowed to get away with these decisions with no accountability, it is the beginning of the crumbling of our democracy. "  Who knew?  A couple of gay men and lesbians get married and our government will begin to implode until it ceases to exist.  Just because you homos want to pledge your love in a civily recognized ceremony just like heterosexuals.  Further, I wish someone would please define the phrase "sanctity of marriage" for me.  Because I'm apparently missing something.  In any case, one has to imagine that the legal wrangling over this issue has just begun.   THE HOT LIST  01.  urlLink [information leafblower] : the man is a walking sports encyclopedia; always a great read 02.   urlLink Lots of Co. : a recent discovery; I have a soft spot for teachers--and he's funny as well. 03.

       2 + 2 = 22  In today's  The New York Times , there is a terrific op-ed piece by Nicholas D. Kristof entitled  urlLink "Sex, Lies and Bush on Tape" .  I urge you to read it in its entirety.  I think it's one of the best 'simple' explanations of how politics is not always a question of right or wrong--but about varying degrees of honesty and what you are willing to accept from your elected officials.  I think the following paragraph in Mr. Kristof's piece summarizes it nicely:  " Compared with Mr. Bush, John Kerry and most other Democratic presidential candidates are paragons of responsibility — but only compared with Mr. Bush. The reality is that promises by Democrats like Mr. Kerry to start new health care programs, keep some of the tax cuts and restore black ink are nonsense. But it's less nonsense to say 2 + 2 = 5 (Mr. Kerry) than to say 2 + 2 = 22 (Mr. Bush). "   DELEGATE SCORECARD  After Tuesday's round of primaries and caucuses, the picture starts to get a bit clearer--and some candidates are about to breathe their last gasp.  Senator John Kerry continues to prove that his message plays well in varied geographical and social climates.  Senator John Edwards continues to show promise and gain favorable reviews.  General Wesley Clark may still have a slight momentum.  Senator Joe Liberman has called it quits.  The fate of Governor Howard Dean is up in the air--but generally does not look promising.  Sharpton & Kucinich seem hellbent on staying in as long as financially possible.  Right now of the 2,161 delegates it takes to earn the Democratic nomination, the candidates stack up as follows:  Kerry 244 Dean 121 Edwards 102 Clark 79 Lieberman 25 Sharpton 5 Kucinich 2  There is still a long road ahead, but there is no denying that patterns are starting to develop.  There is much talk by political strategists that the best bet for the Democratic Party would be a Kerry/Edwards ticket.  Whether that happens--or if the two others can make a move--remains to be seen.   THOSE JACKSON KIDS CANNOT STAY OUT THE NEWS  According to  urlLink Lycos , Janet Jackson's right breast has made internet history.  Apparently, her mammary mishap has become the most-searched event in the history of the Internet.  While I'm not sure how they arrived at this claim, Lycos says that Miss Jackson received more than 60 times the number of searches made for the Paris Hilton sex tape.  Poor Miss Hilton.   DUBIOUS QUOTES OF THE DAY  " Part of it is the label.  Being single, being the quarterback of the San Francisco 49ers, speaking properly, having a sense of style. A combination of those things gets you categorized as being gay. "  " I don't know if it's how I speak or what it is about me that presents that sort of label, but I don't know how many times I have to be out in public with a girlfriend to stop that from being said.

       LAY ON MY COUCH  " The critical ontology of ourselves has to be considered not, certainly, as a theory, a doctrine, nor even as a permanent body of knowledge that is accumulating; it has to be conceived as an attitude, an ethos, a philosophical life in which the critique of what we are is at one and the same time the historical analysis of the limits that are imposed on us and an experiment with the possibility of going beyond them. "---Michel Foucalt  A series of completely unrelated events over the past couple of days has left me in one of 'those' moods.  You know the kind where you wonder if you'll ever really know what  IT  is all about?  As for what my specific  IT  is--or yours for that matter--that's beside the point.  It's all about a journey.  A fantastical trip to places unknown and without a road guide.  Whether it be a trajectory of self-love, purpose, self-hate, being, or ultimately an end, we are all on a similar journey.  The one constant is always trying to find our boundaries on that path--and then learn how to carve new arteries and find new detours to explore.  I've said this before.  At age 38, I sometimes stop and look around me.  Whether that gaze is my loved ones, friends around me, or even strangers circling in outside orbits around me, the realization remains the same.  When do I become an adult?  When do I feel grown-up?  It's such a stupid question to ask out loud.  I am a mature, fairly intelligent individual who's had a fairly decent life to this point.  I interact with the world around me in a grown-up fashion.  I am an adult to onlookers.  Yet, I'm partly a fraud.  Inside, I always feel a streak of childlike fascination and wonder.  It is rather like being perched at the edge of a precarious cliff and trying not fall.  For every life lesson I learn, sixteen more questions present themselves.  For every person who I befriend and grow to love, there are those I never will.  Swirling throughout this process of being and wondering is an uncertainty.  It is an uncertainty that fuels me to move forward and scares the hell out me when I linger.   In the end, no matter how methodical and planned out you lead your life--the unexpected will always come calling.  Good people die.  Bad people succeed. Some days are filled with accomplishments--others frustrations.  It is precisely a game of chance.  A game to find your limits and move on--grow.  So, my preliminary conclusion is that I may never find that place where I feel grown-up.  But, more importantly, I'm learning to be okay with that.  I am not a theory or doctrine.   I am not an accumulation of knowledge and experiences.   I am influenced and affected by people and ideas around me--both positively and negatively.  I am finding my limits.  I am pushing beyond them.  I am growing forward--not up.

       SUPER BREAST XXXVIII  Tom who?  Carolina what?  Let's face it.  The one moment of the entire Super Bowl XXXVIII that will be discussed on radio, television, print, internet and watercoolers around the world is Janet Jackson's right breast.  [Before we begin, what the hell was Jessica Simpson doing in the halftime show?]  So let's review.  The surprise guest at halftime extravaganza was Mr. Justin Timberlake.  Ms. Janet Jackson was the featured performer.  She looked hot and danced her ass off.  In the closing minutes of a show produced by MTV and sponsored by AOL, Timberlake appeared on stage with Jackson to sing a snippet of his "Rock Your Body".  While they playfully sang lines to one another, Mr. Timberlake's crotch was magnetically drawn to Ms. Jackson's booty.  In the final pose, Timberlake reaches over and pulls the snap leather covering off of Jackson's S&M-inspired couture.  For a brief moment, viewers around the world got a peek of Ms. Jackson's (if your nasty) breast and her star-shaped nipple shield.       But, here's where the story gets interesting.  Now, MTV, CBS, the NFL, and even Justin Timberlake are tripping all over themselves to come up with a believable story for what was obviously a well-planned publicity stunt.  MTV was on board first, releasing a  urlLink press wire  which states:   " The tearing of Janet Jackson's costume was unrehearsed, unplanned, completely unintentional and was inconsistent with assurances we had about the content of the performance.  MTV regrets this incident occurred and we apologize to anyone who was offended by it."   Next, CBS  urlLink stepped up  with an apology and a claim that :   "There was no indication any such thing would happen. The moment did not conform to CBS' broadcast standards and we would like to apologize to anyone who was offended."   Then, the NFL chimed in via Executive Vice-President  Joe Browne, who stated:   "We were extremely disappointed by elements of the MTV-produced halftime show.  They were totally inconsistent with assurances our office was given about the content of the show.  It's unlikely that MTV will produce another Super Bowl halftime."    Finally, and perhaps most dubiously, Justin Timberlake  urlLink claims :   ""I am sorry that anyone was offended by the wardrobe malfunction during the halftime performance of the Super Bowl.  It was not intentional and is regrettable."   Wardrobe malfunction?  Uhm, I think that's exactly why those snaps are there in the first place.  Take a look at the faces in that picture and the costume part in Justin's hand.  A malfunction?  I think not.  In the end, Janet and Justin just giftwrapped themselves more publicity than money could ever buy.  Sorry Britney, but your wedding stunt looks silly now.  As Ms. Jackson preps her next album, "Damita Jo", for a March 30 launch, she's now abreast of the buzz.        INSPIRED CASTING  Lee Daniels will be making his directorial debut with an independent film entitled "Shadowboxer".  The script for "Shadowboxer" was penned by Will Rokos (who co-scribed "Monster's Ball").  The film tells the intriguing story of a mother and step-son duo who are contract killers.  They also happen to be romantically involved with one another.  It certainly is daring work for the lead actors.  The mother/step-son duo will be played by the magnificent Helen Mirren and Ryan Phillippe.  Shooting is set to begin on April 1 in Philadelphia.  Actor Wes Bentley is also signed on to the project.  Fashion doyenne Vivienne Westwood will make her film debut as the project's stylist.  This one should be quite interesting.   AMERICA VOTES 2004  On Tuesday, Missouri, Oklahoma, Arizona, Delaware and South Carolina will hold primaries.  New Mexico and North Dakota will hold caucuses.  If you live in one of these states and you believe this country needs a change, please take time out of your day to go to your polling places.  It's a privelege we can't afford to take for granted.   SURVIVOR: ALL-STARS  Maybe it was just me--or perhaps all the hype.  I thought the launch of CBS's venerable reality hit should have been more aptly titled "Survivor: All-zzzzz".  I'm surprised Mark Burnett could find an island big enough to house all of those raging egos on.  As for the show, it's the same people doing the same stunts.  The first tribal council was not much a surprise (in fact, I picked this first victim before the half-hour).  I do have to say I think Rupert was a bonehead for listening to Jenna L.  One hopes the show will pick up the interest factor quickly.

       STOP ME, IF YOU'VE HEARD THIS ONE BEFORE...  President Bush actually kept a straight face as he delivered the following line to the press:  " I've ordered this level of cooperation because I consider it necessary to gaining a complete picture of the months and years that preceded the murder of our fellow citizens on September 11. "  If this were a scene in a movie, he might actually win some sort of award.  Unfortunately, it is only the latest about-face in a long string of caving to political pressure.  From the very beginning, the Bush Administration tried to ward off the formation of an independent 9/11 commission.  They felt that Congress was more than capable of handling any investigation necessary.  The families of those who perished in the World Trade Center and Pentagon rightfully pressed for a less political intervention.  Soon public opinion swung and the White House had no other option than to give in.    The members of the 9/11 Commission (who were appointed by the President) asked for a time extension in filing their final report.  The White House was dead set against the notion.   Curiously enough, Speaker of the House Dennis Hastert said he would rally against any extension.  Public opinion again turned and suddenly President Bush was asking that the extension be granted.  The commission repeatedly requested testimony from high level White House staff, specifically that of National Security Advisor Condoleezza Rice.  The White House strenuously objected.  Then Richard Clarke and his book came along.  The public began to wonder if there was something their government was trying to hide.  An ill-attempted publicity blitz and character assassination of Clarke was to stem the tide and stop the bleeding.  Clarke in the press would not go away.  Opinion polls started suggesting public concern.  The result of which is President George W. Bush's official order of "cooperation" today.  While none of this surprises me in the slightest, I am intrigued by two passages contained in a letter from Alberto Gonzales, Counsel for the President to the 9/11 commission:  " The necessary conditions are as follows. First, the Commission must agree in writing that Dr. Rice's testimony before the Commission does not set any precedent for future Commission requests, or requests in any other context, for testimony by a National Security Advisor or any other White House official. "   " Second, the Commission must agree in writing that it will not request additional public testimony from any White House official, including Dr. Rice. The National Security Advisor is uniquely situated to provide the Commission with information necessary to fulfill its statutory mandate. Indeed, it is for this reason that Dr. Rice privately met with the Commission for more than four hours on February 7, fully answered every question posed to her, and offered additional private meetings as necessary. Despite the fact that the Commission will therefore have access to all information of which Dr. Rice is aware, the Commission has nevertheless urged that public confidence in the work of the Commission would be enhanced by Dr. Rice appearing publicly before the Commission. Other White House officials with information relevant to the Commission's inquiry do not come within the scope of the Commission's rationale for seeking public testimony from Dr. Rice. These officials will continue to provide the Commission with information through private meetings, briefings, and documents, consistent with our previous practice. "  Full disclosure and cooperation have never come with so many strings.  But, remember, they have nothing to hide and Richard Clarke lies.   BUZZ FROM THE BIZ  01.  More additions to the cast of Gus Van Sant's adaptation of E. Annie Proulx's "Brokeback Mountain".  Joining the announced principals Jake Gyllenhaal, Heath Ledger and Michelle Williams will be Randy Quaid and Anne Hathaway.  02.  Clint Eastwood's post-"Mystic River" project has been selected.  He will produce, direct and star in "Million Dollar Baby".  The shooting script is based on two short stories from F.X. Toole's "Rope Burn".  Mr. Eastwood's leading lady will be Oscar winner Hillary Swank.  The script is by Paul Haggis.  03.  Richard LaGravenese is penning the first draft of a proposed remake of "The Secret Life of Walter Mitty".  Jim Carrey has a first-look option based on the resulting screenplay.  04.  Rikki Lake is shooting a comedy pilot for CBS fueling the rumors that her talk gig will be up at the end of its current season.  Ex-Pier 1 spokesperson Kirstie Alley is in negotiations to co-star as Lake's mother.   LARS VON TRIER  The first film in Lars von Trier's latest trilogy "USA: land of opportunities" is now playing in New York and Los Angeles after a slew of film festival appearances.   urlLink "Dogville"  will open in more U.S. cities in April.  To say it's a difficult film to watch would be an understatement.  From a Depression-era Colorado township that exists as a map on a soundstage where walls are chalk lines and set decoration is minimal, to characters that border on the bizarre--there is no doubt that it will be a film you either like or hate.  There's very little chance your opinion will fall somewhere in the middle.  I found myself thinking about Grace and Tom (Nicole Kidman and Paul Bettany) long after the film was over.  Inspired by the song "Pirate Jenny" from Bertolt Brecht and Kurt Weill's "The Threepenny Opera", the tale of seeking revenge and human cruelty is a strange mix of Thorton Wilder's "Our Town", Brecht and Kafka.  It's disturbing, violent and intriguing.  Kidman once again proves she may be the best actress of our time in a role that is neither heroic nor easy to swallow.  There are superb supporting performances from the likes of Patricia Clarkson, Zeljko Ivanec, Phillip Baker Hall, Lauren Bacall, Stellan Skarsgard and Jeremy Davis.  At a running time of 2h 58min, the film takes an investment in more ways than one.  If you are a fan of Mr. von Trier's earlier works, it's well-worth your time.   LARS VON TRIER II  Mr. von Trier has long been accused of making films that submit their female characters to persecution and martyrdom.  I found his defense in this quote to be rather odd:  " I know that some people think that I don't like women but obviously that's not true--it's men I have problems with.  It's like the problem you have if you're a deer.  The old buck with the long antlers has all the females gathered around him and he has a hell of a job keeping the youngsters away.  They all try to piss up against him, just a little bit, you know, to make their mark.  For some reason, in my little environment, everyone is allowed to piss on me.  Which is fine, of course, but it's tiring...I'm looking around all the time, saying, 'Okay, who did that!' as another youngster comes to piss on my back.  And that's my problem with men.  The women don't do that.  Then again, if you can handle the constant pissing, you can have wonderful relationships with other males. "

       PETER USTINOV & ALISTAIR COOKE  On the heels of the recent passing of  urlLink Peter Ustinov  comes the news that the quintessential British gentleman  urlLink Alistair Cooke  has died.    Peter Ustinov was a fascinating man of many talents.  Aside from Oscar winning roles in "Spartacus" and "Tokapi", he was an author, producer and humanitarian. He shall forever be remembered in my mind in the guise of famed Belgian detective Hercule Poirot.  In high school, I discovered the works of Agatha Christie and became entranced with the follies of Monsieur Poirot.  One of my all-time favorite books and screen adaptations is "Death On The Nile".  Peter Ustinov was utterly divine in the role.  Alistair Cooke also played a role in my formative years.  Who can forget his regal presence during the intros and outros to PBS's "Masterpiece Theater"?  Watching "Brideshead Revisited" and "The Mayor of Casterbridge" would never have been the same without him.    QUOTE OF THE DAY   " I've been watching all the elements fall into place for two possible political catastrophes, one that will take the air out of the Bush-Cheney balloon and the other, far more disquieting, that will take the air out of democracy.

       TEST YOURSELF       When I started to write this particular entry, I had meant to focus on a new rapid oral HIV-test that recently won FDA approval.  However, in doing a bit a background research,  I stumbled across a few statistics that I thought were nothing short of shocking.  The most recent data that The Centers For Disease Control and Prevention has on HIV and AIDS infection rates is complete only through December 2001.  The breakdown shown above shows the age at which HIV infection is diagnosed and the respective percentage.  The next numbers for AIDS diagnoses.  Obviously, any numbers are disheartening.  But, the following statistics just made my mind reel:   ***  The CDC estimates that approximately one-fourth of about 900,000 HIV-infected people in the United States do not know they are infected.  ***   Further, the CDC estimates that about 31 percent who get tested and are positive never receive their results.   I think at times it's very easy to be overwhelmed by facts and figures.  Being a mathematician, statistics have always been interesting to me. However, I know people for whom ignorance is bliss. While it is obvious that outreach and education have indeed made inroads, the fact of the matter is that the battle is far from over.  The stigma once attached to HIV and AIDS as just a concern for homosexuals seems to have given way to the fact that it is an equal-opportunity virus.  Yet, as much as HIV and AIDS have affected the gay community, I'm still amazed when I hear people nearly bragging that they don't know their serostatus and that they don't care.  That people actually seek out unprotected sex as some twisted game of Russian roulette is incomprehensible.  A 2003 study headed by Dr. Daniel H. Ciccarone for the American Public Health Association found that in a blind study of 1,421 HIV-positive men and women (with up to five recent partners),  42% of the gay or bisexual men, 19% of the heterosexual men, and 17% of all the women reported any sex without disclosure, predominately within nonexclusive partnerships. Across all groups, 13% of serodiscordant partnerships involved unprotected anal or vaginal sex without disclosure, with no significant difference between groups.  Complacency and lack of knowledge can indeed kill you.  Though I don't think that I've ever knowingly engaged in "at-risk" sexual behavior, I have been routinely screened for HIV antibodies during my normal yearly blood work-ups.  The first time was in all honesty a bit scary.  Not the test itself, but the time that you wait to get your results.  It's like a surreal review of snapshots of all the people you've had sex with run on some carousel of slides through your memory.  When the results are in, the relief is palpable.  Yet, I don't ever let my guard down.  It's not only a matter of my own health, but protecting those who I love as well.  I learned a long time ago that it was not my place to judge anyone's sexual proclivities.  How many partners and what types of sexual activities you indulge in is your business.  Being aware, being tested, being educated--that is our duty to one another.    PAGING DR. RICE  The actions (and lack thereof) of National Security Advisor Dr. Condoleezza Rice have really irked me of late.  First, came the White House's  urlLink dirty move  of outing Richard Clark as the source of confidential press briefings during his tenure with the Administration.  Then, Rice and other White House officials have appeared on every news outlet possible attacking Clarke's reputation.  I find it curious that Dr. Rice cannot testify in public for the 9/11 Commission, yet she can 'testify' to every news reporter who will ask.  For someone who claims that she has  urlLink nothing to hide , her actions certainly say otherwise.  Ask yourself, would the White House be so vehement in its attacks against Richard Clarke if there were no truth to his allegations?   urlLink MoveOn.org  has spearheaded an effort to contact senators and representatives to urge that Dr. Rice testifies in a public session.  Members of the 9/11 Commission have also made repeated requests for the same.  If you are so inclined, please call  202-456-1112  and state your opinion.  Moveon.org has also identified the following background on some of Dr. Rice's assertions:  The  urlLink Center for American Progress  has compiled an excellent list of Rice's contradicted claims.  Here are some excerpts:  * RICE CLAIM: "I don't think anybody could have predicted that they would try to use an airplane as a missile, a hijacked airplane as a missile." National Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice, 5/16/02 * FACT: On August 6, 2001, the President personally "received a one-and-a-half page briefing advising him that Osama bin Laden was capable of a major strike against the US, and that the plot could include the hijacking of an American airplane." In July 2001, the Administration was also told that terrorists had explored using airplanes as missiles. [Source: NBC, 9/10/02; LA Times, 9/27/01]  * RICE CLAIM: In May 2002, Rice held a press conference to defend the Administration from new revelations that the President had been explicitly warned about an al Qaeda threat to airlines in August 2001. She "suggested that Bush had requested the briefing because of his keen concern about elevated terrorist threat levels that summer." [Source: Washington Post, 3/25/04] * FACT: According to the CIA, the briefing "was not requested by President Bush." As commissioner Richard Ben-Veniste disclosed, "the CIA informed the panel that the author of the briefing does not recall such a request from Bush and that the idea to compile the briefing came from within the CIA." [Source: Washington Post, 3/25/04]      * RICE CLAIM: "In June and July when the threat spikes were so high, we were at battle stations."  National Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice, 3/22/04 * FACT: "Documents indicate that before Sept. 11, Ashcroft did not give terrorism top billing in his strategic plans for the Justice Department, which includes the FBI. A draft of Ashcroft's 'Strategic Plan' from Aug. 9, 2001, does not put fighting terrorism as one of the department's seven goals, ranking it as a sub-goal beneath gun violence and drugs. By contrast, in April 2000, Ashcroft's predecessor, Janet Reno, called terrorism 'the most challenging threat in the criminal justice area.'" Meanwhile, the Bush Administration decided to terminate "a highly classified program to monitor Al Qaeda suspects in the United States." [Source: Washington Post, 3/22/04; Newsweek, 3/21/04]      * RICE CLAIM: "The fact of the matter is [that] the administration focused on this before 9/11." National Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice, 3/22/04 * FACT: President Bush and Vice President Cheney's counterterrorism task force, which was created in May, never convened one single meeting. The President himself admitted that "I didn't feel the sense of urgency" about terrorism before 9/11. [Source: Washington Post, 1/20/02; Bob Woodward's "Bush at War"]      * RICE CLAIM: "Our [pre-9/11 NSPD] plan called for military options to attack al Qaeda and Taliban leadership, ground forces and other targets -- taking the fight to the enemy where he lived."  National Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice, 3/22/04 * FACT:  9/11 Commissioner Gorelick: "There is nothing in the NSPD that came out that we could find that had an invasion plan, a military plan." Deputy Secretary of State Richard Armitage: "Right." Gorelick: "Is it true, as Dr. Rice said, 'Our plan called for military options to attack Al Qaida and Taliban leadership'?" Armitage: "No, I think that was amended after the horror of 9/11." [Source: 9/11 Commission testimony, 3/24/04]   WORDS  I met a traveller from an antique land   Who said: Two vast and trunkless legs of stone   Stand in the desert. Near them on the sand   Half sunk, a shatter’d visage lies, whose frown   And wrinkled lip and sneer of cold command      Tell that its sculptor well those passions read   Which yet survive, stamp’d on these lifeless things,   The hand that mock’d them and the heart that fed;   And on the pedestal these words appear:   ‘My name is Ozymandias, king of kings:         Look on my works, ye Mighty, and despair!’   Nothing beside remains. Round the decay   Of that colossal wreck, boundless and bare,   The lone and level sands stretch far away.   --"Ozymandias of Egypt" by Percy Bysshe Shelley

       SONDRE LERCHE      In 2002,  Rolling Stone  named  urlLink Sondre Lerche's  debut album "Faces Down" as one of the top 50 albums of the year.  The 21 year-old native of Bergen, Norway is back with his follow-up " urlLink Two Way Monologue " which takes all of the things that made his debut memorable and adds a new found maturity and cohesiveness to his music.  The music veers from fragile acoustics to crescendos of near symphonic grandeur.  Lyrically, the album is certainly more refined and fleshed out than "Faces Down".  Lerche sites Cole Porter, Burt Bacharach, Jeff Buckley, High Llamas, Elvis Costello, Steely Dan and Beck as musical influences--and that influence was evident on "Faces Down".  This time around, Lerche's music takes on a more distinctive personality.  "Two Way Monologue" seems to take its inspiration from the works of Nick Drake and Rufus Wainwright.  The album begins with the instrumental track "Love You", which is remarkable for its lush string arrangement and unusual chord progression.  This brief interlude sets up a preview of the album sonically.  On the eleven songs to come, Lerche's voice covers territory from raspy, intimate whispers to a stunning falsetto.  The standout cut is the albums first single and title track, "Two Way Monologue".  It begins as a lilting acoustic ballad, but blossoms into a sweet concoction of acoustic and electric guitars, saxophone and a killer synth loop.  It's a flat-out great pop tune.  Then half way through, the song loops back around and as each new sound was slowly added, it's carefully taken away.  Other standout tracks include "Stupid Memory" (with a great pedal steel accompaniment), "Counter Spark", and the bongo laden "Days That Are Over".  "Two Way Monologue" is one of those albums that demands repeated listens to fully appreciate the intricacies of the muscial and lyrical content.   Every detail, from the Alfred Hitchcock inspired album artwork to the track sequencing seems to have been paid meticulous attention to.  It's an album that will not likely garner widespread attention or reel in sales, but it is a fine album that deserves a wider audience.  Lerche, who toured last year with Jason Mraz and Liz Phair will be doing solo dates in the U.S. beginning in May.   CASTING COUCH  01.  Holly Hunter has joined on to the cast of "The Big White" starring Robin Williams, Giovanni Ribisi and James Woods.  The dark comedy revolving around the discovery of a frozen body in a dumpster starts filming April 12 in Winnipeg, Manitoba.  Hunter is said to be playing a "deranged housewife".  The indie is directed by Mark Myloid.  02.  The inimitable "Pink Panther" is returning to the big screen in a prequel starring Steve Martin (as Inspector Clouseau), Kevin Kline, Beyonce Knowles and Jean Reno.  Word has it that David Beckham desperately wants a cameo role in the film and will appear if scheduling conflicts can be worked out.  The filming is slated to begin in May with the film due in theaters in July 2005.   THE SMALL SCREEN  01.  ABC's Family Channel has purchased the rights to rebroadcast the WB's "Smallville" and "JKX: The Jamie Kennedy Experiment" beginning in Fall 2004.  The channel has rights to 66 episodes of each program, both of which will make a fourth season appearance on the WB.  02.  ( *SPOILER ALERT* )  Mia Maestro ("Frida", "The Motorcycle Diaries") will join the cast of ABC's "Alias" during the last three episodes of the current season.  The actress will play Sydney Bristow's (Jennifer Garner) sister.  Word has it Maestro will become a regular doing the shows fourth season.  03.  William Shatner began a four episode story arc on ABC's "The Practice" this past week.  Plans are now in the works for Shatner to join James Spader and Rhona Mitra in David E. Kelley's spin-off series.   OFFENSIVE  President George W. Bush's 'performance' at 60th Radio and Television Correspondents Dinner was par for the course.  Bush's  urlLink slide show  of himself looking for WMD's under Oval Office furniture, I'm sure was hilarious for the families who have lost children in Iraq looking for said weapons.  May I suggest that he need not look further than his own mirror to find a true weapon of mass destruction.

The script was written by Nolan and David Goyer.  The film will explore the origins of the Batman legend and the Dark Knight's emergence as a force for good in Gotham.  After Iceland, the cast will film in London and Chicago.  The film is targeted for a June 2005 release.   THE HOT LIST  01.  Richard A.

Even though geometry proves that it is, my soul begs to differ.  Sometimes space and time are concepts that just do not work in my universe.  There are times when a sigh can speak louder than any words ever could.  Desire at times will not play by the rules of the game.  Call it infatuation.  Call it lust.  Call it whatever your head justifies.  There is a specific chill that wraps itself around your spine.  Its wispy tendrils playfully poke at your heart. It's the kind of chill that no blanket can warm.  It's a chill that can make bluish crystals form on the outer rind of your heart.  Fear not the freeze.  It's only meant to push my blood with a renewed vigor.  It's only meant to recall the look of his eyes.  It's a shiver that blows like a cloud of frozen breath.  The words that float on the air encapsulated in invisible skins kissed by those very crystals.  It's like a thousand photographs of that smile formed from lips seared into the flesh of my memory.  With apologies to Euclid.  The planes we exist on do indeed intersect.  But, the line from point A to point B swerves out of control.  I start pulling on my end of the imaginary string that leads to you.  The question is: will you get the vibration?  Can you understand the cryptic methods of my madness?  Or should I spell it out mathematically?

       BOYS LIKE US 1.03  " I went to college in a quaint, damp, green Virginia town, where I spent four years falling in love with men and going to bed with women. There were many men--usually a new one each semester--and only a few women. I already suspected I was homosexual, but in a detached, oblivious sort of way. Falling in love with anyone was such a relief for a boy who feared he was cold and heartless that the skew of my affection didn't panic me. I told nobody and worried only over what to do with my nervous elation. Sex seemed a good idea, except I was physically attracted only to men I fell in love with, and love made me too respectful to propose anything so rude. There was no terror of being odd, no hunger for normalcy, no conscious guilt--nothing worse than the fear of scaring off the other person. Yet that was enough to freeze me solid. "---Mr. Christopher Bram   PERSONAL QUICKTAKES  01.  It's oh so nerdy, but I've been completely fascinated with the televised hearings of the 9/11 Commission.  Hollywood could not write such intrigue.  02.  I'm ready for basketball again.  I'm sure the surprises will keep rolling in.  03.  I've been raving about Casey Stratton's debut album " urlLink Standing at the Edge ".  It's one of my early candidates for album of the year.  But, it was a wonderful surprise to receive a thank you note from Mr. Stratton for the comments in my weblog.  Not only is the man's voice gorgeous, he's a class-act all the way.    04.  I'm listless of late.  I have projects to attack, but lack of impetus.  Spring has definitely arrived (though honestly, here it's already like Summer).  But, I seem to be moving in slow-motion at the moment.  I think I'm being distracted by fancy and whimsy.  As Spring is considered a period of rebirth and rebloom, my person seems to be crying out for change.  Then again, I may just be punch-drunk with longings for love.  Perhaps, the flowers have it right.  It's all about pollination.

       PETER BART v. MEL GIBSON  In an open letter to "The Passion of The Christ" director/producer Mel Gibson,  Variety  editor Peter Bart takes the filmmaker  urlLink to task  for profiting from his own interpretation of the Gospels in the Bible.  Further, Bart alleges that the supporting cast and crew were treated less than favorably during the filming and paid on an extremely low scale.  Bart wrote the letter for his "Backlot" column in ghost for the cast and crew in Italy.   WE BRING YOU GOOD THINGS  A Trustee's Report from the Social Security Trust Fund leaked to the media says that the fund for the Medicare benefit of Social Security will go  urlLink bankrupt  by 2019 without significant changes to the program.  Ironically, it is the Medicare reform package heralded by President Bush that has caused trustees to move the breaking point forward seven years from previous estimates.  Republicans rallied for the overhaul of Medicare last year to give private insurance companies a piece of the action.  Their rationale was said to be that this new competition would lead to control of long-term costs.  However, the government's own projections are that private managed care plans will cost taxpayers more than traditional Medicare for the foreseeable future.   ...AND NOTHING BUT THE TRUTH  I thought this  urlLink editorial  in the  The City Paper  of Nashville by Ms. Catherine Mayhew was refreshingly honest.  In it, Ms. Mayhew posits to her readers--and the news industry, in general--the timely tenet: " If readers cannot believe what they read in a newspaper or see on a television news broadcast, then our business is done.

       MONDAY MORNING QUICK TAKES  01.  The  urlLink killing  of Hamas founder Sheikh Ahmed Yassin will certainly prompt a new level of violence between Israelis and Palestinians.  While the fact that Yassin had been a major target was a poorly kept secret, one has to question the timing of the decision to attack.  02.  Richard Clarke's new book,  urlLink "Against All Enemies : Inside the White House's War on Terror"  and his interview with CBS's "60 Minutes" has left the Bush Administration on the  urlLink defensive .  Among Clarke's comments:   " Frankly, I find it outrageous that the president is running for re-election on the grounds that he's done such great things about terrorism.  He ignored it. He ignored terrorism for months, when maybe we could have done something to stop 9/11. Maybe. We'll never know. ".    Of course, the White House claims Clarke is politically motivated in his attacks.  However, one must consider that Clarke served successfully both the Bush, Sr. and Clinton Administrations.  03.  Stand By Her Man:  National Security Advisor Dr. Condoleezza Rice adamantly  urlLink defends  her boss and his response to the 9/11 terrorist attacks.  Considering the White House is still trying to justify its actions nearly two years later, I think is a telling sign.  Oh, and Condy, Tammy Wynette already sang that song--and with much more conviction.  04.  Saving "Angel":  Fans of the WB series "Angel" starring David Boreanaz are nothing if not devoted.  In a  urlLink campaign  to save the series from cancellation, fans have hired a $700-a-day billboard truck to drive around Los Angeles and park in strategic locations.  05.  Et tu?  Stanford.

       FEEL THE LOVE  I figured sooner or later the backlash to the subject of gay marriage would take a very nasty tone.  Apparently, it's sooner.  The county commissioners of Rhea County in the state of Tennessee have passed a measure asking legislators to amend state law so that the county will have legal grounds to charge homosexuals with " urlLink crimes against nature ".  Astonishingly, the measure passed by a vote of 8-0.  In the discussion of passing that measure, one of the commissioners, Mr. J.C. Fugate, asked the county lawyer to research an ordinance which would ban homosexuals from residing in Rhea County.  Now, I understand that some people are conservative.  I understand that some people have strong conviction in their religious beliefs (or lack thereof).  I understand that it is a person's right to not understand or accept my homosexuality.  But, I simply cannot understand the logic in their line of thinking.  Beyond the sheer stupidity of their actions, these eight individuals embody only one thing--hate.  While a part of me is angry to realize in the year 2004 such things and people exist, there is also a part of me that can't help but laugh at the profusion of their ignorance.  To think that a group of people would be so afraid and disgusted by the thought of me moving in next door is sadly funny.    Yes, I'll admit it now.  I have a secret plan to move to Tennessee (Rhea County, specifically) with the objective of recruiting and corrupting heterosexual males with the addictive powers of my homosexuality.  I'll lower property values.  I'll drive up the divorce rate.  I'll make the high school football team all queer.  I'll corrupt your children.  Livestock and poultry will never be the same.  My fairy dust will contaminate every molecule you breathe.  First Tennessee, then world domination. [insert theatrical, maniacal--and obviously gay--cackling here]  In the end, Rhea County, just remember you have no one to blame but yourselves.  After all, who could resist the charm of your brand of Southern hospitality?   64 BECOME 32  That magical time known as the Men's NCAA Tournament is about to begin unfurling like--dare I say it--a fairy tale.  Of course, I speak of basketball and the 64 teams who begin a journey to a national championship in San Antonio, TX in early April.  Who will be this year's Cinderella team?  Who will be the break-out stars?  I, for one, cannot wait to find out.  My picks for the 32 teams to advance to the Second Round:  Atlanta: Duke, Seton Hall, Illinois, Cincinnati, Air Force, Texas, Xavier and Mississippi State  Phoenix:  Stanford, Southern Illinois, Syracuse, Maryland, Western Michigan, North Carolina State, DePaul and Connecticut  St. Louis:  Kentucky, Washington, Providence, Kansas, Boston College, Georgia Tech, Michigan State and Gonzaga  East Rutherford:  St. Joseph's, Texas Tech, Manhattan, Wake Forest, Wisconsin, Pittsburgh, South Carolina and Oklahoma State    BUZZ FROM THE BIZ  01.  Reports are that Kevin Smith is  very  close to hand-picking Mr. Jake Gyllenhaal to star in his adaptation of "The Green Hornet".  02.  Gary Sinise has finally signed to head the cast of CBS's "C.S.I. New York".  The show will be spun-off from "C.S.I. Miami" in May and debut in the Fall.  03.  Showtime's adaptation of the Off-Broadway musical production "Reefer Madness" begins shooting in April in Vancouver, B.C.  It is tentatively scheduled to air in February 2005.  The original playwrights Kevin Murphy and Dan Studney have reunited with director Andy Fickman to helm the production.  The cast includes: Alan Cumming, Neve Campbell, Steven Weber, Ana Gasteyer and Christian Campbell.    WORDS  " Abandoned by my family, I already felt it was natural to aggravate this condition by a preference for boys, and this preference by theft, and theft by crime or a complacent attitude in regard to crime. I thus resolutely rejected a world which had rejected me.

       GAY MARRIAGE UPDATE  * A second county in the state of Oregon has  urlLink decided  to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples.  Following the lead of Multnomah County, the commissioners of Benton County have decided to proceed and authorize the issuance of licenses beginning March 24 despite an opinion of the attorney general of Oregon that a county may be found to be in violation of state law.   With the May 17 deadline quickly approaching in Massachusetts, Multnomah and Benton join Sandoval County (NM), San Francisco (CA), New Paltz (NY), Asbury Park (NJ) on the growing list of local governments opting to recognize same-sex marriages.  * In an interesting analysis piece in today's  The New York Times , Mr. Adam Liptak  urlLink makes  the case that the current uproar over gay marriage at a federal level is akin to constitutional law that once banned interracial heterosexual unions.  It's somewhat amazing to realize that it was not until 1967, that the U.S. Supreme Court finally overturned all bans on interracial marriage.  The piece also points out the flawed logic of President Bush's invocation of the "full faith and credit" clause of the U.S. Constitution to urge the need for a constitutional amendment prohibiting same-sex marriage.  Bush's argument claims that the "full faith and credit" clause would supersede individual state's rights to recognize a same-sex marriage.  However, many constitutional and legal scholars have disagreed with Bush's premise.  As quoted in Liptak's piece, Andrew Koppelman, a law professor at Northwestern University, begs to differ:  " No state has ever been required by the full faith and credit clause to recognize any marriage they didn't want to. "   MORE CASTING COUCH...  01.  The sequel to the Sandra Bullock vehicle "Miss Congeniality" begins shooting in April in Los Angeles, New York and Las Vegas.  Directed by John Pasquin ("The Santa Clause"), Regina King, William Shatner and Heather Burns had previously been announced as cast members.  After looking at several well-known leading men to play Bullock's love interest, the producers have chosen a small-screen star, Enrique Murciano ( from CBS's "Without A Trace" and MTV's "Spyder Games") to fill the role of a Las Vegas FBI liaison officer.  02.  Actor/director John Turturro has begun principal photography in NYC on "Romance & Cigarettes", which he also wrote the script to.  The film is said to be a musical comedy and has a varied cast of actors including: Christopher Walken, Mary-Louise Parker, Susan Sarandon, James Gandolfini, Kate Winslett and Mandy Moore.  The catch to the "musical" part will be that the actors will lip-synch to songs by other artists.  Tentatively included in the movie soundtrack are songs by Irving Berlin, Connie Francis, Engelbert Humperdinck, Tom Jones, Dusty Springfield, Bruce Springsteen  and Nick Cave.   U.S. PATENT #6,704,116  For some odd reason, I was fascinated by this  urlLink profile  of a Baruch College professor who has earned a U.S. patent for a standardized Arabic alphabet called "Arabetics".  His goal was to invent a more standardized form of transcription for many Arabic-based languages in written and computer documents.  Interestingly,  Arabic is written right to left and each letter can take one of four forms. Arabic is also printed and written only in flowing script, never as individual letters.   WORD OF THE DAY   urlLink sedulous    SIGNIFICANT OTHERS  While waiting to catch last night's "Queer Eye for the Straight Guy", I watched an episode of the new Bravo comedy  urlLink "Significant Others" .  Two things stuck in my brain.  First, during a discussion of female anatomy, one of the male cast likened the vagina to "a melted candle with hair on it".  Second, a pregnant woman who's husband was afraid to have sex in her condition pleasured herself with a Crest Spin Brush Pro.  One only hopes no one from the FCC was watching.

       HOUSTON, WE HAVE A PROBLEM  It appears the  Queen of the Night  is soon to become  Queen of Rehab .  Beleaguered chanteuse Whitney Houston has finally checked herself into a  urlLink rehabilitation facility .  As if we didn't all know what she was carrying around in that little black bag?  Ms. Houston's publicist, Nancy Seltzer, says that Houston  "thanks everyone for their support and prayers".  Uh-huh.  Now, normally, I wouldn't make fun of someone's drug addiction--but please.  Whitney Houston and Bobby Brown have each consumed enough illicit drugs to account for the gross national product of three mid-size South American countries.  Seriously, she tried to snort the River Jordan.  She stole her Aunt Dionne's weed.  She wasn't doing all that sweating because she was hitting those diva notes.  You'd sweat too, if you had just muled in 37 balloons of smack.  Hopefully, Nippy will have better success in rehab than Ms. Love did.   CASTING COUCH  01.  All ready signed on to Steven Soderbergh's adaptation of "A Confederacy of Dunces", Drew Barrymore is now in final negotiations to star in a remake of the 1968 cult-classic "Barbarella".  02.  In addition to narrating "Lemony Snicket's A Series Of Unfortunate Events" and starring in "Closer" this December, Jude Law has signed on to play a serial killer in William Friedkin's thriller "Serpentine".  03.  George Clooney will star in Stephen Gaghan's "Syriana" about the inner-workings of the CIA.  The film is based on the book "See No Evil" and adapted by Gaghan.  04.  Matt Stone and Trey Parker are currently working on "Team America".  The film spoofs the action film genre using wooden puppets.   QUOTE OF THE DAY  " Polls suggest that a reputation for being tough on terror is just about the only remaining political strength George Bush has. Yet this reputation is based on image, not reality. The truth is that Mr. Bush, while eager to invoke 9/11 on behalf of an unrelated war, has shown consistent reluctance to focus on the terrorists who actually attacked America, or their backers in Saudi Arabia and Pakistan. "---Mr. Paul Krugman, in his editorial " urlLink Weak on Terror " in today's  The New York Times    WHERE ARE YOUR POLITICS?

       MEDICARE AND THE "MEDIA"?  As if the American public needed yet another example of the Bush Administration's continual efforts to push the boundaries of its credibility, a new set of television commercials timed to trumpet changes in Medicare laws for those receiving Social Security benefits are coming under closer  urlLink scrutiny . The commercials--which come on the heels of a mass mailing by Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Tommy Thompson--are part of a carefully coordinated media campaign to sell President Bush's Medicare overhaul package to voters.  But, it seems there's more than meets the eye behind a series of commercials crafted to run in local markets during news programming.  The commercials which include several images of President Bush receiving a standing ovation from cheering crowds during the bill signing, appear to have television news reporters delivering "news" of the changes to Medicare laws and the new drug benefits program (including one featuring a Spanish-speaking reporter).  Another spot features a pharmacist discussing the changes with his clients saying the new law help them better afford their prescription medications and that it's a "very good idea".  The problem?  The people in the commercials are not real news reporters.  The pharmacist is not a real pharmacist.  They are all actors hired by Home Front Communications who produced the spots.   While a spokesperson for the Department of Health and Human Services called the advertisements "story packages" and that it is their duty to inform the public of changes made to the Social Security program, apparently lawyers in the General Accounting Office seem less than pleased with the media material.  Raising concerns about misleading the public concerning the origin of the video segments and well as a law which prohibits the use of federal funds for "publicity or propaganda purposes", the GAO indicated that further investigation may be possible.  Does this Administration tell the truth about anything?  I know this completely out there, but has anyone in his cadre of advisors thought that maybe the truth would be the best way to sell President Bush's ill-advised programs?   THIS MESSAGE IS BROUGHT TO YOU WITH A FIFTEEN-SECOND TAPED DELAY  I thought the whole Janet Jackson BoobGate was blown completely out of proportion.  I'm sure Ms. Jackson will sell a couple more million albums due to her "wardrobe malfunction".  (Which, ironically, she appears sans clothing on the cover of.)  But, then the FCC went crazy.  Clear Channel demonstrated they have no backbone.  The Oscars were tape delayed.  Network television programs were suddenly cutting shots of 80 year-old breasts (which I'm sure were highly pornographic).  MTV was pushing Britney Spears and Maroon 5 videos to "after hours" (which lasted all of ten days).  But now, the whole ridiculousness may have reached new heights.  Reports are that CBS will  urlLink institute  a 10-second delay during the NCAA Basketball Tournament.  Yes, you read correctly. A live sporting event will be aired with a tape delay in case something unforeseen or inappropriate should happen.  What are they expecting?  Someone's uniform is going to spontaneously unravel exposing a jock strap to impressionable minds?  A referee is going to flash some flabby breast? Please. File this one under stupidity.   POP ART  I finally got around to giving my import copy of the Pet Shop Boys boxed set " urlLink Pop Art " a few spins this weekend.  Can I just say, it is so worth the price of admission.  With forty-five tracks that have all been digitally remastered (and sound terrific), it's like a stroll down memory lane.  The set includes many of their biggest hits--and songs that should have been hits.  Having long been a fan of Neil Tennant's and Chris Lowe's work, this collection puts the previous "Discography" collection to shame.  You definitely want to look for the limited pressing three-CD set which includes a bonus disc entitled "Mix" along with "Pop" and "Art" discs.  There are some terrific reworkings of ten of PSBs best dance cuts including "Miserablism (Moby Electro Mix)", "Young Offender (Jam and Spoon Trip-o-Matic Fairy Tale Mix)", "West End Girls (Sasha Remix)" and "Love Comes Quickly (Blank and Jones Mix)".    Nostalgia has never sounded this good.  My heart starts missing a beat...everytime...   NEWSWORTHY  01.  Congratulations to the Maryland Terrapins on  urlLink winning   the ACC Tourney.  It was excruciating to watch Duke's sixth straight title slip away, but Maryland never gave up. 02.  On the heels of terrorism, Spain's Socialist Party  urlLink swept  elections on Sunday. 03.  Vladamir Putin  urlLink easily  wins a second term as President of Russia amidst claims of unfairly limiting media coverage to his challengers.

       CRACKING ME UP  With two episodes, Fox has snagged me with its hilarious new sitcom " urlLink Cracking Up ".  Conceived, written and directed by Mike White ("Chuck and Buck", "The School of Rock"), the Shackleton family may be America's most dysfunctional television family.  Ever.     I've always been a fan of Molly Shannon--and her work here as a bi-polar alcoholic is some of the best she's done.  Jason Schwartzman, playing a psychology graduate student, is the perfect foil for a really talented supporting cast. A philandering husband, a cheerleader daughter with a webcam, an obsessive-compulsive teen son with homosexual tendencies and a put-upon, supposedly maladjusted child make for endless (and hilarious) outrageousness.  The show even has it's own companion weblog:  urlLink Cracking Up Online .    This mid-season comedy truly deserves an audience and I highly recommend it.   QUICKTAKES  01.  Sex may cause cancer.  Okay, not sex...just microwave  urlLink popcorn . 02.  Great story. Exquisite cinematography.  In the mood for a movie?  Check out:  urlLink "Touching the Void" . 03.  Check out  urlLink Choire Sicha's  excellent piece in  The New York Observer :  urlLink "Mr. Anderson Cooper, Superstar" . 04.  David E. Kelley's "The Practice" will  urlLink shut down  for good. 05.  Is Thom Filicia channeling Carson in those Pier 1  urlLink commercials ?   REMIX OF THE DAY  "Harder Better Faster Stronger (Jess & Crabbe Remix)"--daft punk  Beginning with a repeated mantra of "work is never over", six-minutes of driving electronic beats assault your brain with jagged start-stops and whacked-out vocals. It's smack for your ears.  MUST-HAVE.

       THE HEART OF THE MATTER  I watch him from the very moment he enters the room.  I engage his eyes in that knowing glance that is answered with a slight smile.  An upturn of the corner of his lip and a slight dimple distract me--disorient me. A sudden sensation of warmth radiates through my arms.  It was something in recognition.  Some neural response that triggers a physical reaction that slams me.  A slight nervousness.  A case of dry mouth.  A desire to look again--yet knowing, it would be too familiar.  He talks with his hands.  I watch his arms as they conduct words in soundwaves.  I see the tension in his bicep as he gesticulates.  I see his torso move underneath a black t-shirt.  I'm drowning in a sea of familiarity. I watch him laugh.  That familiar chuckle drives a stake through my heart. The sea, she is going to engulf me. I watch his back, as his head tilts to drink.  I suddenly wish I could see his lips part.  Though I'm sinking in waves, I take a drink to avoid choking on parched memories floating in her treacherous waters.  I return to my space--my distant island--and concentrate on the repousse on the napkin.  At this very moment, I want to count each fiber in the paper making up the napkin I'm running my fingers across.  He laughs again.  For an instant, I can recall my head against his shoulder as he giggled in bed.  The sound punctuated by the movement of flesh.  It's one of those mental blips that should make you happy, but almost never does.  I decide recollection can be a heinous crime.  I gulp down the rest of my club soda, turning for one last sideways glance. I always loved that neck. I loved to stand behind him and press my lips to that spot on his neck. I draw a deep breath, look away and exhale as slow as humanly possible.  The corner of the napkin is in my fingers apparently torn away from the other fibers I'm sure it misses.  I pick my heart up off the bar.  I don't have time to make sure it's properly packaged.  I just move toward the exit sign.  Outside in the parking lot, the cool air sears my lungs.  I don't care that it's cold.  I'm just glad it's air without him.  I pull out my cell phone and call the friends I was waiting to meet.  I'm afraid I can't make it.  My head aches.  I have to go home and put my heart back in my chest.  I'm sorry.  Maybe next time.  Next time, when it doesn't hurt like hell.

       BLAIRING THE LINES  In many respects,  urlLink Jayson Blair  is at the root of what is wrong with America.  The downfall and infamy of the 27 year-old ex-national correspondent for  The New York Times  is a troubling story to swallow--much less believe.  A rising star at one of the most admired newspapers in the country by all accounts, Blair's career was derailed when a Texas newspaper questioned facts reported in a piece he wrote about a Texas family's ordeal with a missing son in Iraq.  On May 1, 2003, Jayson Blair resigned from his post.  A subsequent probe by the newspaper found examples of fraud, plagiarism, and inaccuracies in over 36 of 73 articles published with Blair's by-line.  Beyond questions of journalistic integrity and proper management, Jayson Blair brought a stain upon the reputation of  The New York Times  and derailed the careers of the top two editors of the paper--Executive Editor Howell Raines and Managing Editor Gerald Boyd.  Now, Mr. Blair would like you to purchase his new "journalistic" work, "Burning Down My Master's House: My Life at The New York Times" (link omitted purposely) by way of apology and explanation.  The astonishing depth of Mr. Blair's hubris in writing such a book is only eclipsed by the froth dripping from media booker's mouths clamoring for a piece of Blair.  Katie Couric, Larry King, editors of every news and entertainment magazine are all tripping over themselves for an interview with Blair--which coincidentally will please the publishers of his new tell-all memoir.  The question is:  Will the American public buy the hype and the book?  Everything about Mr. Blair bothers me and says volumes about our societal values.    The implications of his book title are enough to engender disgust on my part.  As if referring to  The New York Times  as his "master" somehow alleviates his blame.  To use his ethnicity and an ill-conceived metaphor as a means to assuage his guilt is the zenith of opprobrium.  The fact is Mr. Blair, you are a liar.  Katie Couric and Larry King are helping to sell your lies.  Scandal and sensationalism are helping bring them precious ratings points.  Tit for tat--and Ms. Jackson is no where to be found.  So, what exactly is Mr. Blair's defense for his deception?  He blames drugs.  He blames alcohol abuse.  He blames being an undiagnosed manic-depressive.  He blames the pressure of being a young, black reporter.  He blames working for a competitive newspaper.  He blames everything and everyone except for the ultimate culprit.  Alas, we are left with the following mea culpa: " I am immensely contrite. And I'm sorry for the damage I've done. "  I, for one, have no interest in reading Mr. Blair's book or hearing his "truth".  The sad fact of the matter is that Mr. Blair will probably make more money with his brand of journalism the second time around.   QUICK TAKES  01.  Proof-positive that  urlLink stupidity  doesn't buy--but still sells. 02.   urlLink "Girls Gone Wild"  is not porn.  Which makes me wonder where the boys are. 03.  William Safire on  urlLink privacy . 04.  Jennifer Lopez signs production deal with Fox TV. 05.  Michael Pitt ("The Dreamers") will star in Gus Van Sant's "Last Days", which chronicles Seattle's grunge music scene.   WORDS  " strong as you are you cannot hold back your sight your silence means much more than all of your movements softly whispering my name without a window laugh again and breathe me far away you were safer when i knew you as today " ---"Ocean" by Casey Stratton   E-MALE     Mr. Blake Harper

       APPLICATIONS NOW BEING ACCEPTED  Through a link via  urlLink Chrisafer's  groovy sheep farm, I took the  urlLink Match.com Physical Attraction Test .  Touted as the product of over fifteen years of multi-million dollar research, I figured what the heck.  Perhaps, I've had it wrong all along--barking up the wrong trees looking for the mythical Mr. Right.  So I followed the proctor's directions to the letter and learned the following information about the boundaries of my physical attractions:  According to the exam, the man I'm looking for bears a striking resemblance to this gentleman-- my type :         I must say I approve.    [I also must say that if the gentleman in the picture is single and gay, please contact me  immediately .]    With that out of the way, the test also opined the following items:  01.  My physical type is between the ages of 25-45 years old. 02.  I am pre-disposed to so-called "Ecto-Mesomorphs," with narrow chins and nicely angular faces. 03.  Apparently I'm drawn to dark brown hair--either curly or straight--but definitely short. 04.  I am drawn to hairy chests. 05.  I prefer a soft smile or grin as compared to a "toothy smile". 06.  I like my men to have a clean-shaven face.   07.  Descriptors used to describe men I am attracted to:  "pretty boys", "handsome hunks" and "the outdoorsman look".  Unique traits to my physical attraction:  01.  More unique than "mainstream appeal". 02.  Glasses and the sophisticated and smart look that goes with them. 03.  Bald or shaved heads on a sexy guy.  Features I am not physically attracted to:  01.  Thin lips. 02.  Wide, round chins. 03.  Long and narrow, rectangular faces.   In summary, the report narrows my favorite "look" as follows:  You are open to seeing a variety of men as handsome. Sure, men with "movie star" good looks catch your eye, but you are often equally wowed by more normal "cute" guys. You're not one to judge people based on their looks. In fact, you're genuinely drawn to men that others might dismiss. Maybe it's because you don't buy into society's checklist for "mainstream" attractiveness. Instead, you notice unique features like a strong nose, beautiful eyes, or a cute butt, that make some men special in your eyes. For you, attraction is about the total package.    You have a more open and accepting view of what makes a man handsome than a lot of other guys your age. In the test, you didn't pick the most "popular" men, but instead seemed to focus on your own personal tastes. This doesn't necessarily mean that looks are less important to you than to other men. You simply have a unique set of criteria and keep your eyes open for special qualities that make a man, who may seem ordinary to most, extraordinary to you.   A subgroup of men you picked can only be described as "Hunks." They have a clean-cut, "All-American" look. They're very handsome, without being either "pretty" or overly "rugged." Their face shape and jawline are typically very masculine and strong, while the "inner face" brings more delicate features like a small to medium nose, beautiful eyes, and full lips. It's a balance between the masculine and the feminine that make these guys so irresistible. In fact, these guys have been chased after all their lives, by 1 in 3 men (35%).  There's something about "Outdoorsmen" that also appeals to you. These guys have a tanned, weathered look, along with ruggedly handsome features. You don't need them to be "pretty" or even "very handsome," but you are drawn by the masculinity and free-spirit they convey. These are not your "button down," "don't get your hands dirty" sort of men. About 1 in 4 men (24%) are drawn to these qualities as well.  Faces known scientifically as "Ecto-Mesomorph" repeatedly caught your eye. Men express this type in two ways. One version has a rectangular face shape that is long and narrow. The other type's face shape is often compared to a diamond, because it is wide at the cheeks and then has a sharply angled jaw. All Ecto-Mesomorph men have striking chins that are prominent and squared-off with a crisp line at the base. This is one of the most idealized male face types and can be found on most movie and music idols. It can hold either bold masculine features or more delicate handsome features, or some sexy combination of both. These men also tend to have lean and muscular builds when they're young. About 57% of other men especially prefer men with this face type.    Now, that I have scientific data to rely upon, I am henceforth commencing an open call for gentleman meeting said qualifications. They should be interested in the scientific pursuit of satiating my every desire--or at least be willing to pursue the appropriate measurable scientific data to ascertain the validity of stated experiment hypothesis (clothing optional).  All laboratory subjects will be receive a handsome benefits package and stock options.  Results will be published in a prestigious medical journal or  Men  magazine.   You have to love science.

       THE WAY WE LIVE  In Sunday's  The New York Times Magazine , Jonathan Rauch  urlLink presents  a thoughtful argument against President Bush's call for a constitutional amendment in response to the issue of gay marriage.  A Fellow of the Brookings Institute, Mr. Rauch will publish a book next month entitled '' Gay Marriage: Why It Is Good for Gays, Good for Straights and Good for America ''.  In his essay, Mr. Rauch offers counterpoint to Bush's rally cry.  Further, he develops the construct that the argument should not be whether to redefine marriage--but how to do so.  In his opinion, marriage can become an exclusive "club" to which only heterosexuals are given entre or become "the noblest promise two people can make" (regardless of gender and sexual orientation).  Mr. Rauch writes, using a portion of the President's own speech:  "The union of a man and woman is the most enduring human institution . . . honored and encouraged in all cultures and by every religious faith.   Correct. Marriage is indeed the bedrock of civilization. But why would the establishment of gay matrimony erode it? Would millions of straight spouses flock to divorce court if they knew that gay couples, too, could wed? Today, a third of all American children are born out of wedlock, with no help from homosexual weddings; would the example gays set by marrying make those children's parents less likely to tie the knot? "    A GAY BACKLASH?  The other side of the coin is examined in another piece from  The New York Times .  Bob Morris tackles the notion that some gays and lesbians feel the push to claim marriage is too conformist and actually harms the gay rights cause.  In a piece entitled " urlLink  Gay Marriage? How Straight  ", Morris talks to some gays and lesbians who feel annoyed and betrayed by the push for marital recognition of their relationships.    To be fair, I actually know several gays and lesbians who echo similar sentiments.  A part of me also understands their reticence to embrace the concept of gay marriage.  I guess in many ways it becomes like most things in life:  are you willing to give up something to gain something? In the end, I see it as a very personal choice--but one that anyone should have as an option.   Morris' article includes these quotes from playwright Paul Rudnick and gossip columnist Michael Musto:  " Being gay and single is the new smoking.  It won't be socially acceptable anymore, and you will have to go outside. "---Mr. Paul Rudnick  " It used to be that the whole point of coming out of the closet was to get people to stop asking you when you are going to get married and have children. "---Mr. Michael Musto   KERRY AND GAY MARRIAGE  Stumping over the weekend in Tougaloo, Mississippi, Senator John Kerry  urlLink seemed  to be adding a more thoughtful nuance to his stance on gay marriage.  While the general opinion is that Democrats would rather not talk about the issue, the fact is that it will be an inescapable question on the campaign trail.  Facing a rather perturbed woman who was upset about the comparison of gay rights to the civil rights movement, Kerry seemed to be leaving himself more wiggle room than he has in the past.  Kerry responded:  " I believe that marriage is between a man and a woman.  But--but--but: I believe it's important in the United States of America that we recognize that we have a Constitution which has an equal protection clause. "  Kerry also seemed to disagree with the sentiment of the African-American woman who questioned him in trying to point out the ties that racism and gay hate crimes share:  " Let me tell you something, when Matthew Shepard gets crucified on a fence in Wyoming only because he was gay, when Mr. King gets dragged behind of a truck down in Texas by chains and his body is mutilated only because he's gay--I think that's a matter of rights in the United States of America. "   WEEKEND WRAP-UP  My weekend ended up being a family affair.  On Friday, we got together to celebrate my niece's 12th birthday.  It seems like just yesterday, I held her in my arms on the day she was born.  Now, she's on the cusp of teenagedom.  We had a great dinner, key lime pie (her choice), and lots of fun with presents.  On Saturday, I finally met with a contractor about some renovation I've decided to do in my bedroom.  Now, while I can handle painting and miscellaneous handiwork around the house, I'm by no stretch of the imagination a carpenter.  I've decided to tear out a closet, take out a window, and install new shelving.  So, I thought it best to let a professional handle that bit.  Otherwise, it seems my long delayed bedroom makeover will shortly be underway in full-force.  Saturday evening, I watched "The Pianist" on DVD.  I had seen the movie in a theatre when it was released, but hadn't revisited it since.  I'm not sure if it was my mood or just the environment, but I must say that the movie had a much more powerful effect on me the second-time around.  I found my eyes welling up with tears at several points during the film.  Roman Polanski directed a true masterpiece and Adrian Brody is mesmerizing.  Hauntingly brilliant, hate and hope have never existed more entwined.  Sunday of course was television night, with the return (finally!) of HBO's "The Sopranos and ABC's "Alias" and "The Practice".

"---Bertrand Russell    BOYS LIKE US 1.03  " People recognize the direction of their erotic interests at different times in their lives. I've met men who say they didn't know they were gay until their fifties, and while that seems a long time to remain in the dark, I have no reason to doubt their honesty. I, however, have always known I was gay. When I was five or six, I simply understood this as being different from other boys. But soon this grew into a desire for closeness to other males--more than friendship; a closeness with a forbidden romantic quality. I matured before all the other boys in my class (yet another example of my freakishness) and would rifle through my parents' copy of 'Psychopathia Sexualis'. By the fifth grade I could put a name to my desires: I was a homosexual. Having come so early to this understanding, by the time I was in college I was all the more horrified by how long it was taking me to act upon that knowledge. I was writing my senior thesis on W.H. Auden--itself an act of sublimation and liberation--and his remark that virginity was the only perversity echoed in my head. I saw myself as twisted, my innocence an illness only carnal knowledge of another man's body could cure. "---Mr. David Bergman   BROKEBACK CASTING UPDATE  Joining Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal in Ang Lee's film "Brokeback Mountain" will be Michelle Williams ("The Station Agent", "Dawson's Creek").  Ang Lee personally pursued Ms. Williams to sign on to his production in the role of Alma (wife to Heath Ledger's character).  "Brokeback Mountain" is an adaptation of E. Annie Proulx's short story.  The film will be released by Focus Features and is produced by James Schamus, Michael Costigan, Diana Ossana and Larry McMurtry.

This was during my senior year at Haverford College, outside Philadelphia, in the mid-1970's. Jeff was not only my friend and roommate, he was my soulmate. We'd secured our souls' status earlier that year by dropping acid together, but even before that we'd watched Howard Hawks movies and adopted his ethos: Choose your friends carefully and say only what matters. Cary Grant in Only Angels Have Wings, John Wayne in Rio Bravo, Montgomery Clift in Red River--they knew how. With Jeff and me the talk was often about movies--Hawks, Hitchcock, Ford, Wilder. We also discussed drugs, philosophy, food, the Rolling Stones; knew things other people couldn't fathom; laughed at jokes we alone found funny. We opened our hearts and minds to each other, and to no one else. We talked about our futures. He was heading to Princeton in chemistry. I confirmed at last, to myself as well as to Jeff, that I was going to film school, not law school. I told Jeff everything I cared about. Sort of.  I didn't tell Jeff that LSD had pried open a particular passageway in my brain, one I had painstakingly nailed shut as a child. The moment was suitably bizarre. Several hours after doing some blotter, amazed at how a tiny stain on a slip of paper could produce such a wild effect in our heads, Jeff and I sat watching John Huston's The Bible on a substandard black-and-white TV. The image was only mildly enhanced by the acid, but the story took on broad transcendental overtones. In one central scene, the Israelites celebrate Isaac's growth with a primitive weaning feast. George C. Scott makes a better-than-Sunday-school Abraham, a psychological patriarch with ancient stature and modern nerves. But Abraham was not the cause of my anxiety. It was Ishmael, Abraham's chestnut-shaded prepubescent bastard, lurking on the periphery, causing trouble for the Jews--especially me.  Huston's symbolism is anything but subtle. The centerpiece of the festival is a phallic statuette, which Ishamel steals in a playful attempt to reclaim his birthright--a successful act of male aggression and authority at baby Isaac's expense. Flying on acid, I was back in my local theater in a jolt, nine years old again, watching The Bible with my parents, wanting the statuette but terrified of it, seeing myself as Isaac, robbed and wronged. And wanting Ishmael. Transfixed in a child's lust and horror, I shoved the whole dreadful matter into a mental storage cubicle; twelve years later, thanks to LSD, the door broke open.  It was a dramatic moment of high mental comedy. For the first time in my conscious adult life I half acknowledged myself sexually, and good God, it was all about penises. LSD also taught me a simple lesson that reverberated throughout that night with Jeff and well into the following weeks and months. There were no magical acid visions, no brain-frying colors, only a slapping recognition that I was my life's own author and so far I had been writing someone else's story.  This observation may seem foolish to people who have enjoyed their lives. But since I hadn't (an understatement so vast that it requires reinforcement), it was a revelation as clear and profound as any I have ever experienced. While tripping, I saw what might be meant by the term "well-being": It was what I didn't have. Some other boy had taken it. And it had something to do with sex. I'd spent my life running away from anything physical, grown used to feeling robbed, desexed, detached from my own body. Idiotic as it may seem, watching The Bible on a lousy TV during an acid trip with my best friend reconnected me. Beginning that night, I started to put my own pieces back together in a new and (I realized even then) healthier fashion. It was the first step in coming out." ---Mr. Ed Sikov

       BUZZ FROM THE BIZ  01.  Bryan Singer ("X-Men") is currently in negotiations to develop and direct a remake of the cult classic "Logan's Run".  The 1976 original was based on a book by  William F. Nolan and George Clayton Johnson and starred Michael York.  Word has it that Singer's version will remain true to the book.  The script was written by Paul Todisco and Ethan Gross.  Singer is expected to film this project before starting on the third installment of the "X-Men" franchise.  02.  On Thursday, "Martha Stewart Living" received six nominations for the Daytime Emmy Awards.  03.  Milos Foreman will be given the Film Society Award for Lifetime Achievement in Directing at the 47th San Francisco International Film Festival, scheduled for April 15-29.  04.

       THE SELLING OF A BURNING BUSH  The media blitz to re-elect President George W. Bush has  urlLink begun .  To the tune of $4.5 million, new television advertisements rolled out today trumpeting Bush's "leadership in times of change".  Even to my biased eyes and ears, the strategy being used to market the President is a new low in taste and credibility.  The claim seems to be that Bush should somehow be given a pass on his performance because he was a victim of circumstances.  The current state of the nation is not his fault because he inherited an economy in recession, a stock market in decline, the end of the dot-com boom and the September 11 attacks--or so seems to be the claim.  Ask yourself--is our country is in any better stead today?  Yet, the tag on the ad makes the following claim: " Today, America is turning the corner. Rising to the challenge.  Safer, stronger. President Bush. Steady leadership in times of change. "  Leadership in times of change?  Are we safer?  Are we stronger?    Even more disturbing is a second  urlLink series  of ads that uses images of the September 11th terrorist attacks and the U.S. flag.  To trade on a horrific tragedy to invoke patriotism seems to be tasteless at the very least.  Moreover, scenes of twisted metal wreckage and firefighters is insulting to anyone who lost a loved one on that excruciating day.  To try and use a disaster as a campaign talking point is simply disgusting.  Adding insult to injury, on today's " American Morning " on CNN, was Bush advisor Karen Hughes.  According to Hughes, "  It's a reminder of our shared experience as a nation.  I mean September 11 is not just some distant tragedy from the past, it really defined our future. "  Our shared experience as a nation?  We should re-elect President Bush because of terrorist attack and a foolish claim that it was a "shared experience"?  Shame on you President Bush.  Shame on you.   GBV-C & HIV  In an interesting study published in  urlLink  The New England Journal of Medicine  , scientists have concluded that a secondary infection that exists in some HIV+ individuals may actually delay or prevent the onset of full-blown AIDS.  The virus, GBvirusC, was initially suspected to cause liver disease.  It's genetic composition is similar to that of the Hepatitis-C virus.  But, studies of thousands of patients failed to find a definitive link since its discovery ten years ago.  At that point, research on GBV-C diminished in the medical community.  Only HIV researchers continued to pursue the link of co-infection in HIV patients.    Originally, researchers believed the virus could only worsen HIV infection and disease. But soon a strange phenomenon started to appear--in some patients, GBV-C seemed to protect patients from disease.  However, there having been no proven precedent for one virus thwarting another in human medicine, the early results were held in high skepticism. So, Dr. Jack Stapleton and his colleagues turned to the Multicenter AIDS Cohort to continue their study--the results of which are published in the  NEJM .  These early study results, as well as the new research that will ensue, will hopefully lead scientists to better understand the progression of the HIV virus and provide new treatments to fight--or perhaps prevent--HIV infection and prolong and improve the lives of those infected.

       AND THAT'S THE WAY IT IS  In yesterday's  San Francisco Chronicle , there was a terrific  urlLink piece  profiling master journalist Walter Cronkite.  From his hilarious musings on Janet Jackson's breast to reflections on presidents past and present, Mr. Cronkite's wit is still razor sharp.  His candor and integrity are most admirable.  When asked about the longevity of his marriage to his wife Betsy, Cronkite answered as only he could:   "I do think one of the factors was we were of different sexes.  That doesn't mean I wouldn't have been happy to be married to several friends I had of the same sex.  It just never came up in our particular relations."    OP-ED ROUND UP  **   urlLink Nicholas D. Kristof  in today's  The New York Times  continues his defense of gay marriage by comparing President Bush's call for a constitutional amendment to a call in 1912 for an amendment  prohibiting marriage between "persons of color" and caucasians.  **   urlLink Stephen Gillers , also in  The New York Times , makes the case for an unlikely runningmate for Senator John Kerry--President Bill Clinton.

       OSCAR POST-MORTEM  When nearly thirty minutes had elapsed and the only one award had been bestowed, you knew the trouble had begun.  Once the Billy Crystal Revue closed, the show never seemed to gather steam.  By the time the "big three" awards rolled into view, I was yelling at the television to just give the awards to "The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King".  Going eleven for eleven and tying the Oscar haul of "Ben-Hur" and "Titanic", I suppose the sweep is impressive.  However, I must confess that I just don't get the Hobbits.  After forty-five minutes of the first one, I was done with my Peter Jackson experience.  So perhaps if it was a picture I was cheering for, the show may have held more interest.  Then again, I think not.  The highlight of the show for me was Charlize Theron receiving the Best Actress nod for her multi-layered work in "Monster".  While I was happy that Renee Zellweger won for the woefully overlooked "Cold Mountain", I have to say that I was rooting for the stunning Shohreh Aghdashloo ("House of Sand and Fog") who perhaps gave the performance of the year.  It was also nice to see Sean Penn win and receive a standing ovation.  Beyond that, the continuous refrain of "The Lord Of The Rings" and subdued presenters made for dull viewing.  In the area of fashion, gowns with trains ruled the red carpet.  Charlize Theron was a golden goddess in her Tom Ford for Gucci.  Other standouts were Shohreh Aghdashloo in Simin, Jennifer Garner in vintage Valentino, Renee Zellweger in Carolina Herrera and Angelina Jolie in Marc Bouwer.  Fashion don'ts included Uma Thurman, Diane Lane, Samantha Morton, Susan Sarandon, Peter Jackson, Liv Tyler and Annie Hall.  As the race begins anew, three films you should see if you haven't  are "House of Sand and Fog", "Monster", and "City of God".   FURTHER SIGNS OF THE APOCALYPSE  October will see Bill O'Reilly enter the realm of children's literature with "The O'Reilly Factor For Kids: A Survival Guide"--a sure recipe for a kinder, gentler nation.

       FAIRY TALES: LESSONS TO BE LEARNED?   Beauty & The Beast ---If we look at it through the eyes of the heroine, it's an inspiring tale about the tranformative power of love. From the point of view of the Beast, though, the story seems to warn that you're not going to find a life partner until you lose some bulk, get rid of your facial hair, and go blonde.    Little Red Riding Hood ---A cautionary tale of a little girl who meets a wolf when she wanders off the straight and narrow path. Gay men will more likely understand this as a sad story of an unsuccessful drag queen who tried to impersonate a little old lady; But, who couldn't pull off the illusion because his facial features were too big, fuzzy, and ugly.    Hansel & Gretel ---Gay men often find themselves identifying with supposed villains of the story, preferring the evil sourpusses to the goody two-shoes. Consider that poor old lady who got shoved into an oven by those brats Hansel & Gretel. Sure, she may have been a little grumpy, but didn't she deserve a little credit for building a country home out of gingerbread?    Snow White ---Didn't we feel just a little sorry for Snow White's evil stepmother? When your own mirror starts insulting you, it's time to get a new look. As for Snow White herself:  a complete whimp. Her one redeeming quality was her ability to divvy up housework with a bunch of trolls, she'd just met--a skill highly regarded by anyone who's ever shared a house on Fire Island.    Three Little Pigs ---What gay kid didn't feel sorry for two of those three little pigs? They got gobbled up merely because they tried to build their houses of something a little more exotic than cinderblock. When did wicker become a crime?    Rapunzel ---One bad hair day, and the engagement was off.    Sleeping Beauty ---Overly impulsive? She married the first Prince Charming who kissed her after napping for a hundred years. Who could make a decision like that first thing in the morning? Wouldn't you think she'd have a cup of coffee before committing herself for life? Maybe she figured it had to be true love because this guy didn't seem to mind here morning breath after her not brushing her teeth for a century? After a hundred years of plaque, we're surprised that the Prince's head simply didn't burst into flames upon contact.    Cinderella ---OK. She married some guy from a one-night stand whose one redeeming quality was that he returned her shoe. In retrospect, though, this may be an admirable trait. In most gay trysts, if you leave an article of clothing behind you may as well kiss it goodbye, unless you spot it by accident.    The Ugly Duckling ---The fairy tale that made perfect sense to all homosexuals. The gay resonance of this tale is so obvious that it's hardly worth mentioning. An odd duck is hatched into a family of birds, which makes fun of him for being different. As time goes by this little misfit is revealed to have been a breed apart and evolves into a handsome swan who goes sailing off into the sunset with his equally gorgeous feathered friends. Nine out of ten gay men consider themselves heroes of exactly the same story.

       YOUNG ADAM      Brandished with a questionable NC-17 rating from the MPAA, Mr. David Mackenzie's adaptation of Alexander Trocchi's  urlLink  Young Adam   is a film of great depth and artistry.  With his performance as Joe, Ewan McGregor undoubtedly lays claim to being the most accomplished and diverse actor of his generation.  Tilda Swinton continues to break your heart with her portrayal of  characters of so delicate a skin you can almost see through them.  Her work as Ella is mesmerizing.  Make no mistake, the acting of the principals--as well as the supporting cast--alone make  urlLink 'Young Adam'  a must-see and worthy of a wider audience than it is going to receive.  Mackenzie's script and direction are sublime.  From the title credits, the mood and colors of the film are cast.  When the body of a young woman is pulled from the River Clyde between Edinburgh and Glasgow by Joe and Les (Peter Mullan) on to the deck of a coal barge, the event sets in motion a chain of action that will affect the lives of the principals in very different ways.  The story of this woman's body--the circumstances that lead to her death--all provide the impetus for this brooding thriller.  It becomes clear that the movie is a tale of immorality.  Joe has been having an affair with Les' wife.  But, Joe has secrets and dalliances with numerous women.  Yes, there is sex and nudity.  But unlike much Hollywood fare, the sex is not glamorous or titillating.  It's a bizarre mix of eroticism, literal dirtiness and a macabre anger that permeates the sex.  The trust of the actors to allow for unvarnished close-ups and unflattering shots only add to legitimize the actions of their characters. (I should note that there is a brutal and uncomfortable scene involving condiments and sex that will stay with you long after the film is over.)  It's very hard to keep from disliking Joe.  He is a man hounded by many demons and has little chance of redemption.  He's a man drowning in stagnation and despite his sexual conquests--a man who is being choked by loneliness.  Yet, McGregor keeps you with him and makes you want to know what drives him.  In the end, there is no trite redemption or resolution for the character of Joe.  Sometimes, there are just means to an end.  Mackenzie's artful use of flashbacks helps to put the pieces together of who this man Joe is.  He uses nearly claustrophobic camera shots and grimly lit sets to create a palpable urgency.  He also adds poetic flourishes to the film's narrative.  Without giving away too much, Mackenzie uses a seemingly disconnected string of objects--a corpse, a typewriter, a burned photograph and an inscribed mirror--to tell his story and the fate of his characters. Filled with gloomy cinematography capturing the beauty of Scotland circa 1950's and a haunting score by David Byrne, Mackenzie uses all the tools available to him to cast an intoxicating spell in a mere 99 minutes.     'Young Adam' is a thoughtful, adult movie.  I highly recommend it.  FURTHER READING: More on  urlLink Alexander Trocchi (1925-1984)    QUICKTAKES  01.

       BOYS LIKE US 1.06   "She leaned against the kitchen counter in a blue turtleneck and black slacks, her auburn hair curled and sprayed like she was going somewhere, drinking Diet Coke out of a tall glass. The dishwasher hummed and churned and sloshed. My father was presumably napping with the television on in their bedroom.  'I've come over to tell you why I've been so scarce lately,' I said.  'You left a message on the recorder about Don being in the hospital?'  'Don's on a respirator. He has the worst case of pneumonia his doctor has ever seen. He could hardly sing midnight Mass. He couldn't breathe. Garold, our friend, took him to the Southern Baptist the day after Christmas, when I was at work.'  Be blunt, I told myself. Get it out so that you have room to breathe.  'He has AIDS. He's not going to live. I loved him. But he wasn't my lover. Paul is. What am I trying to say? I'm gay.'  'I knew,' she said." ---Mr. William Sterling Walker   SCENE FROM A WHITE HOUSE DAILY BRIEFING: 04.27.04  Q: Why is Fallujah and Najaf under siege? Why are they -- and is the President willing to see them go into a Waco or Guernica?  MR. McCLELLAN: I'm sorry, where are you getting that from, Helen?  Q: That if they are under siege, and we decide to go in, and there is that kind of resistance, there will be tremendous bloodshed.  MR. McCLELLAN: Helen, that is a highly speculative characterization that you are making there.  Q: Well, we do have them under siege, both towns, don't we?  MR. McCLELLAN: And I would not describe it that way. First of all, we have been working very closely with Iraqi officials in those areas to bring about a peaceful resolution to the situation. The coalition has been working to partner with Iraqi security forces to improve the security situation. There are a lot of developments going on, on the ground. Certainly, if coalition forces are fired upon, namely our Marines, in the case of Fallujah, they will defend themselves.  Now there are some thugs and terrorists that continue to exist in areas of Fallujah.  Q: -- maybe they're just Iraqis.  MR. McCLELLAN: Helen, all you have to have to do is look at the types of attacks that they carried out on innocent Americans recently to know that these are thugs and terrorists. They have no regard for human life.  Q: Are we doing the same thing?  MR. McCLELLAN: We will not let them prevail. However, as I said, we are working to improve the security situation there. We're working with Iraqi leaders. You're seeing a partnering with Iraqi security forces to begin patrols in Fallujah and to bring about a peaceful resolution to the situation. They've been working with civilian leaders there. But there is a difference between civilian leaders and thugs and terrorists who seek to derail the transition to democracy for the Iraqi people. And they have no place in Iraq.  Q: Maybe they're defending their own country against an occupation.  MR. McCLELLAN: Helen, we have liberated the Iraqi people, and we're moving forward to transfer sovereignty back to the Iraqi people, so that they can realize a free and peaceful future. As I said, this is critical to winning the war on terrorism. There are thugs and terrorists who are trying to carry out innocent attacks on innocent men, women and children. Look at what they've done, look at the attacks they've carried out that have led to the deaths of school children. Look at the attacks that they have carried out that have led to the deaths of their fellow Iraqi citizens.  Q: And we haven't we killed any civilians? Have we killed any civilians?  MR. McCLELLAN: The United States military and coalition forces go out of their way to make sure that civilians are not targeted and not killed.  Q: Have we killed any?  MR. McCLELLAN: We target those who seek to carry out their evil acts and seek to return to the oppressive regime of the past -- and that's not going to happen.

       BARE: A POP OPERA       After a successful and extended run in Los Angeles,   urlLink BARE: A Pop Opera   moved to New York City on March 25, 2004.  With the help of Dodger Productions, it opened in previews at the American Theatre Of Actors (where  Urinetown  had its beginnings before moving to Broadway).  The production has since played to full houses and become a hot ticket.  Recently, the musical had its Off-Broadway run extended through May 27.     BARE , written by Jon Hartmere Jr. and Damon Intrabartolo, is one of those rare contemporary musicals akin to  RENT  where everything gels perfectly.  A great score and a gifted cast, make for a wonderful theater experience.   BARE  is a coming-of-age story of five high school seniors in a co-ed Catholic boarding school.  Each character has questions about their lives that they must confront.  From confessionals, to a rave, to intimate dorm room settings, each character experiences revelation and growth.    One of the major plot lines in  BARE  is a love story between Peter (Michael Arden) and  Jason (the delectable  urlLink John Hill ) that is marvelously fleshed out.  Arden, who recently workshopped  The Vampire Lestat  and starred in  Big River , is a revelation in his portrayal of Peter's struggle coming to terms with his faith and sexuality.  Hill, who understudied for Hugh Jackman in  The Boy From Oz  and starred in  Hairspray , is nothing short of spectacular as Jason.  Toss in Romelda T. Benjamin (Sister Chantelle), a wonderful score, and dynamic scenic design from David Gallo and expert direction from Kristen Hanggi and  BARE: A Pop Opera  is an uplifting must-see.  With the extension, the musical may move to the new DodgerStages this Fall to continue an Off-Broadway run.  Tickets to  BARE  are $40.00 (Telecharge: 212-239-6200).  The American Theatre Of Actors is located  at 314 West 54th Street between Eighth and Ninth Avenues. Showtimes are Monday at 8 PM, Wednesday through Friday at 8 PM, Saturday at 2 and 8 PM and Sunday at 2 and 7 PM.

       HOW FREE IS FREEDOM?  In ten weeks, the so-called "transfer of sovereignty" in Iraq is scheduled to take place.  Those three words have been bandied about in every newscast, newspaper and Beltway soundbite since that fateful day that President Bush stood on the deck of an aircraft carrier with the banner "Mission Accomplished" patriotically displayed over his right shoulder.  But, those three words have never really had a cogent meaning.  They are whispered like the secret code to gain access to the neighborhood treehouse.  Sadly for the people of Iraq, those three words portend nothing more than a murky and tenuous future.  In ten weeks, the U.S. is slated to transfer sovereign power to Iraq.  Just don't ask who that power will be transferred to--or exactly what that power will entail.  In today's  The New York Times , a  urlLink piece  written by Steven R. Weisman starts with the following paragraph:   "The Bush administration's plans for a new caretaker government in Iraq would place severe limits on its sovereignty, including only partial command over its armed forces and no authority to enact new laws, administration officials said Thursday."   Unfortunately, this revised stance by the Bush Administration only provides more questions than it does answers.  Behind the scenes, United Nations envoy Lakhdar Brahimi has been desperately negotiating with all parties involved to come up with an acceptable compromise that could be touted as the return of self-government to Iraq.  What has evolved is a plan that in no sense of the word can be referred to as 'self-government'.  With the Administration's continuing mantra that the June 30th deadline must be met as a 'symbolic' promise to the peoples of Iraq, one has to question exactly where the pay-off of a 'symbolic' promise lies.  Does the U.S. really believe it is bringing freedom and democracy to Iraq?  Or does President Bush's re-election campaign need the 'symbolic' promise to help stem the tide of criticism of the continuing occupation of a country mired in something less than liberation?

       HOT SUN IN THE FUMMERTIME  I'm officially declaring the start of Summer in New Mexico.  In all likelihood, it probably began long before my declaration.  We seem to forget two of the seasons here--Spring and Winter.  It's Summer most of the year and when Fall makes its brief appearance, it soon swallowed by a burgeoning Summer.  The days now are filled with bright sun and light winds.  Fluffy clouds dance by; Trees and flowers bloom; The sun keeps shining.  It's amazing to go outside and lift your face to the sky and feel an immediate sense of warmth and light bathe your skin.  It's wonderful right now because its not excrutiatingly hot yet.  Once you step outside, the sounds of nature fill what--just a month ago--was an eerie silence.  In short, it's nearly perfection.  There in lies the problem.  Try as you might, it is virtually impossible to keep your mind focused on tasks at hand.  You just want to go find the nearest park and sit under a tree watching as the world go by.  A gaggle of guys throw a frisbee.  Seeing their sinewy musculature moving stealthily under a blanket of cinnamon colored skin.  A film of glistening perspiration shows like jewels under the noonday sun.  Flowers leave a sweet trace of their breath in the moving air.  Dogs and people walk or run by.  The mirth of children playing at a nearby swing set.  Blades of grass reaching skyward yearning for the sun's kiss.  My heart sings with the birds.    Most definitely, hot fun in the summertime.

       HITLER & HOMOSEXUALITY  Tonight on HBO's sister-channel Cinemax, Fenton Bailey and Randy Barbato's documentary " urlLink The Hidden Fuhrer: Debating The Enigma Of Hitler's Sexuality " has its premiere.  The documentary uses German historian Lothar Machtan's controversial 2001 book  urlLink "The Hidden Hitler"  as the basis of its source material.  At the publication of his book, Machtan was pummeled with criticism, especially from the homosexual community. for his assertion that Hitler was gay.  Much of that criticism was based on the fear that an uneducated public would immediately associate link between homosexuality and the 20th century's most despicable crimes.  Part of this fear was deserved, in that the book was poorly marketed and it was easy fodder for the religious right.  However, there is little denying the vast amount of research and data accumulated by Machtan to prove his hypothesis.   In fact, much of what Machtan writes has been echoed by many scholars and writers but was never taken to its logical conclusions.  Among Machtan's sources are respected biographies by Joachim Fest and Alan Bullock.  Machtan was criticized for being defensive in supporting his claims.  However, the simple fact that most of the people in Hitler's life that could have served to support his arguments were either exterminated, disappeared or committed suicide.  Machtan's most striking evidence came in the form of the so-called "Mend Protocol".  The Mend Protocol was the testimony of Hans Mend, a dispatch rider, who served with Hitler in World War I.  Mend was supposed to have given this written information to an opponent of the Nazi regime in 1939.  Included in the written documentation were such inflammatory passages, as the following:  " In 1915 we were billeted in the Le Febre brewery at Fournes. We slept in the hay. Hitler was bedded down at night with 'Schmidl,' his male whore. We heard a rustling in the hay. Then someone switched on his electric flashlight and growled, 'Take a look a those two nancy boys.' I myself took no further interest in the matter. "  Mend, himself, would have credibility and criminal issues to.  However, by piecing together anecdotal recollections with the little information that was able gleaned from Hitler's youth, Machtan wrote an intriguing argument.  Among supporting arguments, Machtan focuses on Hitler's desperate attempts to cover up his youthful sexual history and shield himself from blackmailers. Among them, the liquidation of Ernst Rohm's Storm Troopers in 1934, the destruction of Magnus Hirschfeld's fledgling gay rights movement, and the roundup and murder of thousands of German gays in the camps.  In the end "The Hidden Hitler" was dismissed for its implication that the 20th century's greatest villain was somehow evil because he was gay.  Bailey and Barbato take on the arguments made by Machtan and supplement them with recently uncovered archival documents, photographs and interviews with other scholars.  Among those included in the 90-minute documentary debating Machtan's thesis are Michael Bronski, Laurence Mass, Frederic Spotts, Geoffrey Giles and Michaelangelo Signoreli.  The thoughtful and controversial program debuts tonight at 7:00 pm EST/PST on Cinemax and runs throughout April and May.

       SOMETIMES DEEP THROAT IS NOT NECESSARY FOR SATISFACTION  Another day, another book and a whole lot of spin.  With today's release of Bob Woodward's " urlLink Plan of Attack ", another book lands on the White House doorsteps that is sure to be just as unwelcome as Richard Clarke's tome.  Of course, the White House may have a bit tougher time trying to discredit Mr. Woodward.  His direct access to people like President Bush and Secretary of State Colin Powell, only serves to connect the dots between claims made in Clarke's and Paul O'Neill's books.  Among the more interesting points raised by Woodward:  --Making his decision to launch war against Iraq, President Bush did not consult Vice President Dick Cheney, Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld or Secretary of State Colin Powell until after the fact.  --Bush is quoted as saying regarding the lack of consultation: " "I didn't need to ask them their opinion about Saddam Hussein. If you were sitting where I sit, you could be pretty clear. I think we've got an environment where people feel free to express themselves. "  However, he did feel it necessary to consult National Security Advisor Dr. Condoleezza Rice.   --In the case of Secretary of State Powell, his notification was only done after plans were reviewed with Saudi Ambassador Prince Bandar bin Sultan.  --In the summer of 2002, at least $700 million dollars was diverted from a congressionally approved appropriation (perhaps illegally) for the war in Afghanistan for the specific purpose of developing a war plan for Iraq.  --Vice-President Dick Cheney is described as the "steamrolling force" in the push for war.  The book also details a very unsteady relationship between Cheney and Powell.  --Saudi officials were allowed to review top-secret war plans in an effort to enlist the country's support for the invasion.  Cheney allegedly told Saudi Ambassador Prince Bandar bin Sultan during this meeting that once the war started, Saddam would be "toast".  --In meetings in the run-up to war, FBI Director George Tenet is quoted as telling President Bush that "it's a slam dunk case" that Saddam had weapons of mass destruction.  --When Secretary Powell is finally brought in to the loop he is quoted as warning President Bush " You know you're going to be owning this place? " cautioning him that the United States would be assuming the responsibility for the postwar situation.  --According to Woodward's interviews with over 75 principals, shortly after New Year's Day 2003, Bush -- frustrated with unproductive U.N. weapons inspections -- made up his mind to go to war after consulting with Rice.  Yet, the White House publicly states that the decision for war was not made until March 2003.  --President Bush asked Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld on Nov. 21, 2001, to start a war plan for Iraq.  Such planning was to be done in secret because a leak could trigger "enormous international angst and domestic speculation".

       TRANSAMERICA  In 2001, Jour de Fete Films released a short film compilation entitled " urlLink Boys to Men ".  One of the four films included--"The Mountain King"--was directed by Duncan Tucker.  Now, Tucker will start work on his first full-length feature with the ambitious and intriguing "Transamerica".  Set to begin filming May 20 in New York City, the independent film will star the very talented Felicity Huffman.  "Transamerica" (based on a script by Tucker) will tell the story of Bree (Huffman), a conservative male-to-female transexual.  Bree will discover that while she was a man, she unknowingly fathered a son.  Kevin Zegers ("Dawn of the Dead") has been cast as the son who is a teenage runaway and hustler.  The film will detail the duo's unusual relationship as they become part of one another's lives.   Fionnula Flanagan ("The Others") has been cast as Huffman's mother.   QUICKTAKES  01.

I hadn't prepared myself. It was November 1983, and I'd arrived at a friend's election party in skinny tie, scarlet pants, bowling shoes--'punk', as yokels in my miniscule Kansas town termed it. Inside, twelve females and males huddled unchaperoned around a TV. The hostess had strategically placed vodka and scotch amid the card table's bowls of popcorn, cashews, cinnamon bears, and ice cubes molded into tiny donkey and elephant heads. Since no one cared about the election results, between updates we'd press the Play button on the absent parents' VCR. There it was, porn, scenes from a videotape a sandy-haired boy had rented. After a few minutes, most of the males present had centered pillows in their laps or swiveled to lie on the carpet.  That porn film became the room's volcano. We were stunned and burned by it, but helplessly immobile. Everyone fell silent, or, rather, the occasional laugh or crass opinion went unheard. I couldn't help but focus on one actor's penis. It seemed massive, unreal. The actress, Marilyn Chambers, stretched out on a pool table, leaned her head over its edge and planted the cock in her mouth. 'Damn,' someone said, 'you can see it in her throat.' The girls oohed and yucked, but I pressed my pillow closer. I felt I'd been punched between the eyes, over and over and over. Would anyone notice I was aiming my attention on the actor instead of Ms. Chambers? After he came on her face, someone's finger stabbed the Stop button. We saw the latest precinct figures for Rice County, and I knew I'd returned to reality, to small-town Midwest teenage life, where tangible flesh-to-flesh contact didn't exist.

TV  to be offered on a revenue-share basis with satellite providers adding the channel to their platform as a pay-per-view service, in four-hour programming blocks or on a monthly subscription basis.    A BUSH IN THE MOUTH  A sampling of some of the more 'eloquent' exchanges during President Bush's Q&A session with reporters last evening:  --on comparing Iraq to Vietnam: " Yeah, I think the analogy is false. I also happen to think that analogy is--sends the wrong message to our troops and sends the wrong message to the enemy. "  --on his best prediction on the length of troop deployment: " In terms of how long we'll be there, as long as necessary, and not one day more. The Iraqi people need us there to help with security. They need us there to fight off these, you know, violent few who are doing everything they can to resist the advance of freedom. "  --on the Administration's claims of WMD: " Well, let me step back and review my thinking prior to going into Iraq. First, the lesson of Sept. 11 is when this nation sees a threat, a gathering threat, we've got to deal with it. We can no longer hope that oceans protect us from harm. "  " I went to the U.N. as you might recall and said, Either you take care of him or we will. Anytime an American president says, If you don't, we will, we better be prepared to. And I was prepared to. "  --on why President Bush must be accompanied by the Vice-President in front of the 9/11 Commission and turning over Iraqi governance: Q. " Mr. President, Why are you and the vice president insisting on appearing together before the 9/11 commission? And Mr. President, who will you be handing the Iraqi government over to on June 30? " A. " We'll find that out soon. That's what Mr. Brahimi is doing. He's figuring out the nature of the entity we'll be handing sovereignty over. And secondly, because the the 9/11 commission wants to ask us questions. That's why we're meeting, and I look forward to meeting with them and answering their questions. " Q. " Mr. President, I was asking why you're appearing together rather than separately, which was their request. " A. " Because it's a good chance for both of us to answer questions that the 9/11 commission is looking forward to asking us, and I'm looking forward to answering them.  Let's see. Hold on for a minute. Oh--I've got some must calls, I'm sorry. "  --on a sense of personal responsibility for 9/11: " I feel incredibly grieved when I meet with family members. And I do quite frequently. I grieve for, you know, the incredible loss of life that they feel, the emptiness they feel. "  --on criticism that the Administration did not do enough to prevent 9/11 from happening: " Well, I think, as I mentioned, you know, it's the country wasn't on war footing. And yet we're at war. And that's just a reality. I mean that was the situation that existed prior to 9/11. Because the truth of the matter is, most of the country never felt that we'd be vulnerable to an attack such as the one that Osama bin Laden unleashed on us. We knew he had designs on us. We knew he hated us. But there was nobody in our government at least--and I don't think the prior government--could envision flying airplanes into buildings on such a massive scale. "  --on whether Americans deserve an apology from the President: " Hmmm. Look, I can understand why people in my administration are anguished over the fact that people lost their life. I feel the same way. I mean I'm sick when I think about the death that took place on that day. And as I mentioned, I met with a lot of family members and I do the best to console them about the loss of their loved one. As I mentioned, I oftentimes think about what I could have done differently. I can assure the American people that had we had any inkling that this was going to happen, we would have done everything in our power to stop the attack. "  --on whether Iraq could cost the President his job: " I don't plan on losing my job. I plan on telling the American people that I've got a plan to win the war on terror. And I believe they'll stay with me. They understand the stakes. Look, nobody likes to see dead people on their television screens. I don't. It's a tough time for the American people to see that. It's gut-wrenching. "  --on President Bush's biggest mistake after 9/11: " Hmmm. I wish you'd have given me this written question ahead of time so I could plan for it. I'm sure historians will look back and say, Gosh, he could have done it better this way or that way. You know, I just--I'm sure something will pop into my head here in the midst of this press conference with all the pressure of trying to come up with an answer, but it hadn't yet "...." You know, I hope I don't want to sound like I've made no mistakes. I'm confident I have. I just haven't — you just put me under the spot here and maybe I'm not quick, as quick on my feet as I should be in coming up with one.

       HOLLYWOOD NOTES  01. WARNING: Britney Spears wants her own reality television show!  Ms. Spears is said to be shopping a series entitled "On Tourage" which would follow the lives of Spears and her fellow dancers on the upcoming European leg of the Onyx Hotel Tour.  It has been described as a cross between MTV's "The Real World" and Madonna's "Truth or Dare".  I'm suddenly wishing the reality television genre would fizzle--posthaste.  02.  Nick & Jessica:  To stop their bid for world domination, I can only think of one solution.  D-I-V-O-R-C-E.  03.  The struggling ABC has announced early renewals on the following series: "Hope & Faith", "Extreme Makeover", "Extreme Makeover: Home Edition", "According To Jim", "My Wife & Kids", "George Lopez" and "America's Funniest Home Videos".  Mmm-hmm.  04.  President Bush's decision to hold a primetime news conference to try and address the fallout of the 9/11 Commission has sent network schedules scrambling.  Fox will move its "American Idol" to Wednesday/Thursday and ship "24" to Sunday.  NBC's season finale of "Happy Family" has been delayed a week.  ABC and CBS will revert to previously aired episodes of its schedule.  05.  Jon Abrahams has signed on to Warner Bros. remake of the 1953 horror flick "House Of Wax".  The film will be directed by Jaume Collet-Serra.  06.  Wal-Mart is selling the world's first DVD player that can seamlessly skip over violence, swearing, nudity and other potentially offensive movie content. The $79 unit features technology by ClearPlay and is manufactured by Thomson Inc. under its RCA brand.   I say, why bother with the movie in the first place?   JOHN VARVATOS      I've long been an admirer of the work of  urlLink John Varvatos .  His keen eye for deconstructing men's high-fashion into a more wearable, more practical style has never been off-mark since his signature collection made its debut in Fall 2000.  He's mixed vintage suaveness with a modern perspective.  Whether it's a more tailored look or more casual, his clothes and footwear always seem to have a unique ability to work together.  Many may not realize that Varvatos was responsible for the creation of Calvin Klein's  cK Line  and Ralph Lauren's  Polo Jeans Company .   Now, Mr. Varvatos has launched a signature fragrance and will be launching a skin care line later in 2004.    urlLink john varvatos    may be the sexiest fragrance in the world.  Developed with Quest International (which produces Zirh and Shiseido products), the fragrance may be the best interpretation of masculinity in a bottle ever developed.  Using several perfumery ingredients that have never graced another men's fragrance,  john varvatos  is bold and sophisticated--but never overpowering.  It is perhaps best characterized as a woody oriental (but honestly, that is too simple of representation).  The top notes include West Indian tamarind tree leaves, Medjool date fruit and a mixture of Mediterranean herbs.  The middle notes are coriander seed templar, clary sage flower and Indian ajowan.  The base notes include auramber, vanilla CO2, balsam, eaglewood, vanilla and leather.  (West Indian tamarind tree leaves, Medjool date, auramber and eaglewood have never been used in perfumery before.)  Packaged in a smoked glass flask with a leather wrap, it is the embodiment of Varvatos style.  The fragrance was launched in March 2003 at Saks 5th Avenue and Varvatos boutiques in NYC and L.A.  The worldwide launch is set for June 2004 at Holt Renfrew in Canada.   Launched in 125ml and 75ml sizes along with a deodorant, hair and body shampoo and after-shave gel, the line will be joined by a full skin care regimen (developed with Shiseido).  Along with the usual essentials:  facial cleanser, toner, eye cream and shave products; the line will include a multi-vitamin serum, balancing face mask, hydrating facial gel, pore refining mattifier and concealer.  The products will range from $22.00 to $59.00.  As a self-confessed fragrance whore, I can only say: Smell it.   Try it.   Live it.   COVER OF THE WEEK  I learned of a cover version of Outkast's "Hey Ya" by Will Young from  Max  over at  urlLink Lots of Co. .  Ever since I've downloaded it, I can't stop listening to it.  It was originally performed live by the U.K. Pop Idol winner on BBC radio I believe. It won't be everyone's cup of tea, but try imaging the song redone as a torchy ballad.  No, seriously.   SHOUT-OUT FOR J.GO  " I am what I am I am my own special creation So come take a look Give me the hook or the ovation It's my world that I want to have a little pride in My world, and it's not a place I have to hide in Life's not worth a damn 'til you can say 'Hey world, I am what I am!'

       CONFESSION IS GOOD FOR THE SOUL  I was raised in a devout Roman Catholic home.  I was baptized, confirmed and attended catechism classes.  We were expected to attend church services at least once a week.  At the time I began the process of self-discovery--which included my homosexuality--I had already become disenchanted by some of the church's official teachings and stances.  I was a freshman in high school and could not understand the church's positions on issues such as contraception, divorce, abortion--and a whole host of other dogma.  Of course, the major stumbling block in my faith came when I knew that in my church's eyes I was a sinner and not welcome because of my homosexuality.  At the time, I was the only person who knew about my questioning and dilemma.  Soon, the soul-searching and questions led to my ultimate decision to stop attending church.  To say that it was not a popular decision with my family would be an understatement.  I think my grandmother was the most disappointed, as I was her oldest and first grandchild.  While I had lost faith in my church, I still had a yearning to explore my spirituality.  I went to services--from Baptist, to Lutheran, to non-denominational churches--looking for "something".  I even attended a Jehovah's Witness prayer meeting (which is a strange story for another time).  Not finding what I was looking for, I explored other less-traditional outlets for channeling my spiritual side.  In college, I took an honors course entitled "The New Testament As Literature".  It opened my eyes and mind to looking at religion in a completely different way.  Though I never went back to the church, it's hard to not try and identify with the label that is Catholicism.  These days the label that fits best is Agnostic.  I still have a spiritual side and don't foresee a time when I would embrace Atheism.  But, I suppose one never knows.  The reason I bring up the whole issue of my religious upbringing is that part of my weekend was spent with a family friend who happens to be a priest.  We had lunch and discussed a variety of issues.  He's one of those people that you can throw anything at and it doesn't phase him.  He represents a younger generation of clergy in the Catholic Church and a more progressive teaching.  It was a fascinating conversation.  He'd known for years that I was a homosexual--and it was not an issue as far as he was concerned.  I told him of my dismay of a church that tries to use guilt to keep its masses in tow.  We discussed my objections to the sacrament of confession--and all the stances I had problems with.  He listened thoughtfully and added from his own perspective.  He was candid and non-judgmental.  We discussed other religions and our individual definitions of what spirituality entailed.  Hours later, I recalled parts of our conversation and it brought back a flood of memories from my younger years.  In the end, I think spirituality is a process--perhaps a journey.  In my own case, I'm not sure where that journey heads.  But, I know that it is there.   QUICKTAKES  01.  In today's  The New York Times :   urlLink 'The Silent President'  02.

       RICE-A-BALONEY: A D.C. TREAT  For the most part, I thought Dr. Condoleezza Rice's performance in front of the 9/11 Commission was admirable.  She was determined and well-spoken.  She certainly cannot be accused of not standing by her man.  As for standing by her story, there were several moments when Dr. Rice truly seemed uncomfortable and somewhat flustered.  To be fair, several of the commissioners were quite aggressive with her (as it is their duty to be).  Some of her repetitiveness was odd.  She certainly made it a point to drop the fact that the Bush Administration had been sitting for only 233 days prior to the 9/11 terrorist attacks.  I kept wondering if that was somehow meant to excuse the Administration's policy--or lack thereof.  As if 400 days would have made a crucial difference?    There were times when Dr. Rice's persistence and repetitive answers did come off as disingenuous.  Her unwavering defense of President Bush and the Administration's actions served to add a note of arrogance to her testimony.  Would it be that incredible for anyone in the White House to say that perhaps there were mistakes made?   For me, the oddest--and perhaps most damning--exchange took place during Commissioner Ben-Veniste's questioning.  Regarding the infamous August 6, 2001 presidential daily briefing (PDB), Ben-Veniste had to talk over Rice to get her to answer his question as to the title of the PDB.  Dr. Rice responded:  "  I believe the title was 'Bin Laden Determined to Attack Inside the United States'.  "  Then astonishingly, she followed a few moments later with this statement:  "  It did not warn of attacks inside the United States.  It was historical information based on old reporting.  "  The phrase 'Bin Laden Determined To Attack' is not a warning?  Even if you take the fantastic leap required to believe Dr. Rice's interpretation of that PDB, her stance was certainly further weakened when Commissioner Kerry pointed out that the PDB included a statement that the FBI was indicating patterns of suspicious activity in the United States consistent with preparations for hijacking.  Suddenly, Richard Clarke's allegations don't sound so farfetched.  The other moment that was awkward and telling was when Ben-Veniste asked point-blank if she [Dr. Rice] had relayed warnings from Richard Clarke to the President that al Qaeda cells were operating in the United States.  Dr. Rice's indicated that she could not recall if she had talked to President Bush about Clarke's warnings.  Even more curious was her assertion:  "  I don't remember the al Qaeda cells being something that we were told we needed to do something about.  "  In the end, Dr. Rice's statement about there not being a "silver bullet" that could have prevented 9/11 may or may not be true--no one will ever know.  There is, however, no getting around the fact that planes were used as bombs and innocent lives were lost.  Now, bullets and bombs are being used in Iraq (wrongly in my opinion) and innocent lives are being lost.    The biggest weapon of mass destruction may turn out to be the no one wants to assume responsibility for their actions and the consequences of those actions.   REQUIRED RICE READING  01.  You can read a complete transcript of Dr. Rice's testimony  urlLink here . 02.  Perhaps the best observations I've read regarding Dr. Rice's testimony:  urlLink Mr. Howard Fineman    BY THE NUMBERS  Using data from the 2000 U.S. Census, the Urban Institute and Human Rights Campaign developed the following facts and statistics in the on-going debate over same-sex marriage.  I thought some of them were rather surprising.  01. Same-sex couples live in 99.3 percent of all counties nationwide. 02. There are an estimated 3.1 million people living together in same-sex relationships in the United States. 03. Fifteen percent of these same-sex couples live in rural settings. 04. One out of three lesbian couples is raising children. One out of five gay male couples is raising children. 05. Between 1 million and 9 million children are being raised by gay, lesbian and bisexual parents in the United States today. 06. At least one same-sex couple is raising children in 96 percent of all counties nationwide. 07. The highest percentages of same-sex couples raising children live in the South. 08. Nearly one in four same-sex couples includes a partner 55 years old or older, and nearly one in five same-sex couples is composed of two people 55 or older. 09. More than one in 10 same-sex couples include a partner 65 years old or older, and nearly one in 10 same-sex couples is composed of two people 65 or older. 10. The states with the highest numbers of same-sex senior couples are also the most popular for heterosexual senior couples: California, New York and Florida.   BOYS LIKE US 1.04  " The passage of time since then seems unreal, as did those rolling days of fun underscored by a knowledge indelible as a visceral twinge that I was bound for something different from most of the guys I knew. At the end of that year, I started a twenty-four-month relationship with a girl. We would go on dates and French-kiss, hold hands, cuddle in my father's Pinto wagon, even discuss getting married. She knew about my sexual preference (a friend had told her) and assured me she understood; we could work out a special clause before the wedding. It never occured to us, in those days just before AIDS, that jealousy or lack of monogamy could be the end of us. I loved her, I liked to hold her. But I wasn't drawn to her physically. I hadn't started out to be a homosexual, to enjoy the bodies of other men, to forsake the acceptance of society for mere pleasure. And if I had, arrogance is the crib death of decision. Since I left home, I have tried and fought in vain for two relationships that didn't work out and I've resolved never to put myself above other gay men. What I work toward these days is survival in love, knowing the limits of any new design. "---Mr. Michael T.

       THE TRUTH SHALL SET YOU FREE  In yet another example of "selective editing", it now appears that an EPA study conducted to study the toxic effects of mercury on our environment was less than forthcoming.  A major initiative of the Bush Administration has been a strident effort to relax regulations on emissions from coal-fired power plants in the U.S.  It now appears that the information that was released to Congress was carefully parsed.  So much so, that scientists and toxicologists that served on the National Academy of Sciences panel that formulated the report are concerned about the released information.  According to a  urlLink report  published in today's  The New York Times , the White House played down the toxic effects of mercury in hundreds of pages of documents and e-mail messages.  According to Alan Stern, a New Jersey toxicologist who served on the committee:  " What they are saying is not scientifically invalid on its face.  Partially they edited for clarity and relevance from a scientific standpoint. But there appears to be an emphasis on wordsmithing that is not necessarily dictated by the science. "  The upshot of all of this is that last Thursday attorneys general from 10 states and 45 senators asked the EPA to scrap the proposed rules on the grounds they were not strict enough.  While this issue will most likely not receive the publicity and exposure it deserves, there are scheduled hearing and opportunities for public input is set to end in April.  An extension has been requested prior to a December 2004 deadline for new regulations to be instituted.  Whether it will be granted or not is still not clear.   THE BITCH IS BACK  Ms. Jill Sieracki is now the managing editor of  Playgirl  magazine.  She was an editorial assistant for the Hearst Publishing Corporation.  Two years ago she sent an anonymous musing to  mediabistro's  now-defunct "Bitchbox" column.  In her rant, Ms. Sieracki wrote among other things:   " Hey editors! Get off your fuckin' high horses and come down and smell your trash.  We are your editorial assistants—not your maids, your mothers, or your personal assistants. "  The anonymous missive spread like wildfire on the Internet, culminating in a  Page Six  item.  Soon, Hearst had an internal investigation going.  In less than a week Ms. Sieracki was terminated for violating the email policy of using the company system for personal email.  Now Ms. Sieracki writes a highly entertaining  urlLink piece  for  mediabistro  about the entire ordeal.

       RANDOM THOUGHTS  01.  I officially made the weekend four days long.  As the pre-convicted Martha would say, that is a very good thing. 02.  Spent time with friends, shopped entirely too much, and had a manicure (I don't care if its metrosexual, I highly recommend all men have them.) 03.  As much as I tried to avoid newspapers, I couldn't help but see Condoleezza's mug everywhere.  Ms. Rice, it's called a smile.  Try it. 04.  The Tony/Adriana flirtation on "The Sopranos" was interesting.  It was also the best written episode of the season thus far. 05.  The two best situation comedies that your aren't watching (and surprise, they're on Fox): "Arrested Development" and "Cracking Up". 06.  Austin, TX is a very cool city. 07.  Duke lost. UConn won. Whatever.  I'm not bitter. (Bastards.) 08.  Albums you should listen to: "Little Things"--Toby Lightman and "Get Away From Me"--Nellie McKay. 09.  Heard an advance copy of Kimberley Locke's debut disc (set to street May 4).  It's a superb pop album. 10.  The team of Josh Gabriel and Dave Dresden have remixed stuff for the like of Britney Spears, Jewel, Paul Oakenfold, Duncan Sheik, Medicine8 and Way Out West.  Working with vocalist Jes Brieden under the moniker Motorcycle, the trio is responsible for the trance orgy that is "As The Rush Comes".  Now comes word that Motorcycle will release a full length album EMI/Positiva later this year.  Can't wait. 11.  I loved "House Of Sand and Fog" in the theater.  It loses none of its power on DVD.  The DVD is worth the price of admission simply for the included screen test from the heartbreaking Shohreh Aghdashloo. 12.  I'll be seeing Madonna's "RE-invention Tour" at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas, NV.  I'll be selling a kidney for the tickets.

       CURIOUSER AND CURIOUSER  There's an interesting piece in today's  The New York Times  by Philip Shenon and David E. Sanger regarding the Bush Administration's  urlLink refusal  to turn over documents from the Clinton Administration to the 9/11 Commission.  Now, this move strikes me as odd for two reasons:   First, earlier this week, President Bush made the point of announcing to the press that he " ordered this level of cooperation because I consider it necessary to gaining a complete picture of the months and years that preceded the murder of our fellow citizens on September 11. "  Two days later, it appears the cooperation has ended.  Secondly, you would think the Bush Administration would fall all over itself rushing to turn over any and all documents from the Clinton Administration since they claim all along that Clinton had no policy to deal with terrorism and his foreign relations policy was lacking.  Isn't it curious that White House Spokesman Scott McClellan said the documents were "duplicative" or "unrelated"?  He further claimed others were withheld because they were "highly sensitive" and the information in them could be relayed to the commission in "other" ways.   Oh, sure.  Let's let the administration that's being investigated (to see if 9/11 could have been prevented or if the response was mishandled) pick and choose which documents are "related" and  "un-sensitive enough" for the commission's eyes.  I feel safer already.   ACCEPT  There are days when you read something that is concise, well-written and it catches your attention.  So much so, that you have to read it again for fear you missed something the first time.  Simple. Elegant. Truth. :   urlLink "Gay Soldiers and Teachers"    QUOTE OF THE DAY  " The Bush Administration has treated New York City like a battered wife who still gets displayed for photo-ops and state dinners. George Bush and the Republicans who control both houses of Congress have starved New York for three years with fiscal policies that alternate between abuse and neglect. But now Bush will stage his renomination convention in the city he has used and abused--sticking his finger in our eye and exploiting our bereavement. This August, Karl Rove, the kitschy guru of political theater, will try to convert the crematorium of Ground Zero into a re-election billboard.   One of Bush's first TV ads of the season was another example of his exploitation of New York. It contained footage of New York firefighters carrying the remains of a dead co-worker on a gurney draped with an American flag. The image was an icon of the carnage. Scores of 9/11 widows and firefighters condemned the ad's poor taste and hypocrisy. As Jimmy Breslin wrote in Newsday, "In his first campaign commercial, George Bush reached down and molested the dead."   There are many ways in which the Bush Administration has attempted to strangle New York. The most telling has to do with its treatment of the city after the September 11 attacks. But there are others that show the extent of Bush's contempt not just for New York but, by implication, all of urban America. "  ---Mr. Jack Newfield, from his piece " urlLink "Bush To City: Drop Dead"  in  The Nation.    GUEST BLOG ENTRY  I've recently had a few unkind things to say of Mr. Jayson Blair and his book "Burning Down My Masters' House: My Life At The New York Times".  While I won't rehash my problems with the book, I will say that I continue to find Mr. Blair's attempts at a defense for his actions baffling and contemptuous.  I recently received a piece written by  Mr. Daniel Forbes  detailing his interview with Blair after a recent book signing.  I think it offers an interesting look into a side of Blair that is only hinted at in the book.  I would like to publicly thank Mr. Forbes for the permission to publish his article in my weblog.  Mr. Forbes is well-known for his writing on contemporary social issues and he has testified before both the House and Senate regarding his journalistic efforts. **********   BLAIR TALKS TURKEY   by Daniel Forbes (March 16, 2004)    By the way, the sex for drugs was with men. Or - saying he was revealing details he'd told no one else - so Jayson Blair told me Friday night, the two of us alone on a Harlem sidewalk following his first public reading. The drugs were primarily cocaine, sometimes crack and "a little heroin" to come down on. But cocaine was his decided favorite. Blair said he was "born a decade too late" - that is, after coke's peak. Regarding the sex-for-drugs, I asked only the gender involved and whether any New York Times staffers participated. With yet another of his grating, ingratiating giggles, Blair said no about any Timesmen, "but that would've made a good story, hunh?"   He told me his attitude about sex - and indeed perhaps sex itself - was "really sordid" and "twisted" and "fucked up." He declared himself rife with inhibitions and said there were sexual issues "I need to sort out." He added, "Drugs are a way to make myself comfortable with sex."   And no, I'm not outing Jayson Blair in any fashion. He invited such questions in his widely trashed new memoir, Burning Down My Masters' House: My Life at The New York Times, published by New Millennium Press. (The house bears the twin distinctions of having recently filed for bankruptcy and publishing Blair.) As first revealed by, I believe, Paul D. Colford of The New York Daily News, the book made cryptic reference to " ... other less memorable moments where I performed, or received, a sexual favor for drugs. When I was on the performing end, it was usually implicit that it was for drugs." I always thought it was a bit of a continuum, but where one person's "performing end" ends and another's receiving end begins is, as they say, beyond the scope of this article.  In any event, Blair certainly could have told me to get lost rather than answer my questions as I stood there pen and paper in hand. And that would have been that. To his credit, this interview came after I'd maneuvered up front during the last, emptier stages of his crowded book signing. I shielded us so no one could hear and mentioned his vague sex-for-drugs reference.  This was up at the Hue-Man Bookstore & Cafe on Frederick Douglass Blvd. just south of 125th Street. Without blinking an eye, Blair indicated a straggler or two among the very supportive, predominantly African-American book-buyers and asked me to wait. Proceedings dragged, though the maybe ten photographers stayed busy. I was starting to figure Blair was stalling and would plead another engagement and bolt. But he grabbed some cigarettes and we headed to the sidewalk, Blair glad of the smoke. He'd been working hard.   As to the sex abuse as a child he'd suffered - one in an endless litany of reasons for why he'd deep-sixed his career and mauled his employer - Blair told me it was at the hands of both a male and a female, neither one an "immediate relative." It started when he was five, the woman soon caught. But the man's abuse continued for five years, until he was ten. Or so Blair said, one feels compelled to reiterate.  But hold. It's a new Jayson Blair, possessed of the frankness of someone flogging a book, someone who declared himself now done with lying. He made no promises about self-serving exculpation or craven self-absorption though. And that's good, for he's full of both judging by the ultimately pretty boring book and Friday night's polished performance before enthusiastic fans and a meek press.  Oddly enough, silence greeted his stated advice to young journalists: "Put integrity ahead of careerism." His fans nodded and reporters gaped, hoping their silence would spur more of the same. He offered to "be like Moses if you want me to be," when an audience member encouraged him to continue speaking out on racial issues. Self-serving and frank - and however mendacious - Blair also discussed substance abuse and mental illness. Threatening to emulate Al Sharpton's sheer relentlessness, he said he might speak in every bookstore in the country until people begged him to stop.   There was little mention of his transgressions beyond such generic verbs as "lie" and "sin." There were no pointed questions. Joking a couple of times that he'd only answer questions from photographers, he also told one white questioner, we "can't let the media guy ask questions - you guys ain't allowed to speak." A couple of other remarks were also geared to get the reporters present to go easy, including a jocular requests or two to his fans in attendance to, in effect, send a vibe to cow the press.  I counted some 45 people there; perhaps a third were white, and they were mostly reporters and photographers. Of the perhaps thirty true fans, most were black.  Basking in his fans' support, Blair proved a clever and charming performer. Seated behind a desk, he's adroit, good-looking. Elsewhere, he's alarmingly short. His frequent and annoying giggle and occasional drift for a phrase or three into a posh English accent were both remarkable. On the rare occasions the questions got at all pointed, he'd deftly interrupt. Blair his own master of ceremonies, he was joined at the front table by Jamal E. Watson of the Amsterdam News who opened and closed proceedings and pointed to the next questioner.  On Friday night, Watson gave Blair mostly kid-glove treatment. It echoed his positive print review of a couple of days before. Watson led his article identifying Blair as "the self-professed fabricator and plagiarist." But on the plus side, Watson wrote that "an apologetic Blair comes clean...." And he termed the book, a "well-written memoir," one that offers "powerful testimony." He asserted that, "While reading the page-turning memoir, it becomes immediately clear that he can write, and he can write well."  When summing up the evening, Watson called for "some sense of forgiveness." He added that, "We can learn from what Jayson provided us here, but that doesn't mean we let him off the hook." Watson would no doubt enjoy a spirited exchange with the many reviewers who have condemned Burning as a shoddy, self-serving affair - and a lousy read to boot. But no one disputed the praise Watson voiced on Friday.  The Hue-Man is a class operation, with both Bill Cosby and Henry Louis Gates Jr. having recently appeared. Co-owner Clara Villarosa said Blair's Beverly Hills-based publisher had initiated the reading. She declared it obviously to Blair's advantage to appear first at an African-American bookstore. There was no apparent security and none needed. Blair did have both a publicist and an assistant present. Lurking close towards the end of the signing to stake my claim to a private interview, I heard many a lush expression of support from book-buyers. Blair took his time speaking with each and wrote a couple of sentences in each copy.   Racial issues dominated the evening, including both the later questions and answers and Blair's opening reading about the Times' allegedly racist under-coverage of the murder of black and brown. (Curiously enough, the passage he read concerned the downgrading of coverage regarding a murdered white woman once it was learned she was homeless.) He said he once complained to an editor about what he viewed as other racially skewed editorial decisions and "got in trouble for it."   Blair asserted that a "curmudgeonly" Times copyeditor who, not realizing Blair was within hearing, complained, " 'Why can't any of these black reporters write?' " Yes, Blair brands the Times a racist institution. However he might quantify the paper's alleged racism - and Blair made no firebrand statements on that - it was more racist, he said, than either The New York Daily News or The Washington Post. The latter benefits from needing to appeal to D.C.'s many middle- and upper-class blacks in its coverage, he said. But the Times is written, Blair indicated, for the people who live in the editors' neighborhoods on the Upper East and West Sides.  He said affirmative action was necessary to "level the playing field," and that it now was suffering white backlash. More than once he denounced the "white, upper crust, male Ivy League" editors of the Times who hire unqualified whites from the likes of Harvard, Amherst and Yale. Meanwhile, a "white Irish guy from Queens can't get in."  Complaining that the editors only knew people who looked like themselves to hire, he expressed a desire to "stick it" to the old-boy network. Nonetheless, fellow African-American, Gerald M. Boyd, the Times number two who lost his job at Blair's hands as did top editor Howell Raines, was the only person criticized by name. There was no mention of then metropolitan editor Jonathan Landman who, as became famous after the fact, worked hard a year before it hit the fan to try to get the Times to stop publishing Blair. As to the Times itself, Blair said the book's title is "sort of" an attempt to bring it down.  Blair admitted the possibility that he was an affirmative action hire. But he didn't feel his race "helped me once I got in the door." He certainly was prolific if nothing else. He said that helped explain why he hit "burnout" faster at the Times as a result. He spoke of doing 200 stories a year each of his first two years on the paper and asserted that most reporters do fifty to seventy articles a year. That he worked like hell is corroborated in a scathing denunciation of his "ongoing con" in Sunday's Times' Book Review written by Slate's Jack Shafer. The Book Review refers to Blair's four years as a reporter and his "more than 600 articles at The Times."  Starting in college, Blair said he put pressure on himself to exert "double, triple, quadruple" the effort of anyone else. Now he knows it was fueled in part by the manic element of the bipolar disorder that was diagnosed when he quit the Times just ahead of getting fired when a reporter from Texas called him on his latest plagiarism. Having made a suicidal gesture, he checked himself voluntarily into a hospital for a week and got diagnosed with the manic-depression that first surfaced in high school, he said. But he also said his parents, who he spoke warmly of, raised him to work twice or three times as hard as whites.  Though the Times hired him at a remarkably young age, Blair said, "I'd already run six miles before I got in the door." And yes he did have prior formal stints while an undergraduate at The Boston Globe, The Washington Post and then the Times itself. Ultimately, he admitted - his scale presumably a football field's 100 yards - "I have perhaps set back the cause of African-American journalists ten or twenty yards." And only the best routinely overcome that kind of third and long.   He lost his sure performer's touch only once - not that he received many pitches that weren't fat, slow and over the plate. Adopting his questioner's phrase, he gave the obvious reply that he was a "House Negro" rather than a "Field Negro." A moment later, Blair said, "I can't believe I just called myself a 'House Negro.' " Whether he was rueful over his diction or the concept itself, the half-pregnant, P.C. phrase sounded leaden in these white ears.   Remarkably enough, Blair allowed that he's not angry at either Raines or Boyd - a great relief, no doubt, to both men and their families. As the question period was closing, he expressed regret about Raines' firing.   I managed two public questions: I wondered whether Blair felt any remorse over helping to move the Times to the right by being responsible for Raines' ouster and replacement by the decidedly more middle-of-the-road Bill Keller.   And I asked him about the "powerful drugs" that, according to the bookstore's website advertising the event, "allow him to function again."  He sketched through his current legal medications. Worried I might botch it, I subsequently queried him by e-mail. In a gracious reply, Blair wrote that he is currently on: "Depakote, which is an anti-convulsant used to also treat bipolar mania; Zyprexa, an anti-psychotic used to treat schizophrenia and severe bipolar mania; and Paxil, an anti-depressant." He also wrote that he is on Ambien, a sleeping pill and Klonpin, a tranquilizer. Yes, the man is delving into his mental illness, a topic he and others declare shunned by the black community.  He ducked my question about Raines, but he'd already stated his preference for "conservative racists" who are more "blunt" about their feelings than are "liberal racists." He added his view that the Times is not only liberal, "it's anti-conservative."  All in all, a high-energy and slippery performance - just like the book. Not incidentally, the book's credibility is harmed by the ubiquitous direct quotes going back years in situations where Blair would be unlikely to have had a notebook out. Editor and Publisher thought to ask him about the "lengthy verbatim quotes...." Embracing the lax, modern standard, Blair told E & P, "We made the determination that we would rely on my journals when we could and when we couldn't we would rely on my best recollections. It's the standard for this form of nonfiction."  Well, I say it's spinach and I say the hell with it, especially relying on the recollections - "best" or not - of someone who writes of waking up on the floor and not remembering how he got there. Used to be something inside quote marks was actually said by someone.   Furthermore, a gentleman never tells. I haven't yet found the passage where Blair admits plugging a PR woman's client in the pages of the Times in exchange for sex, but I don't imagine he mentioned her name. So why does he feel the need to mention the first name and employer of a working class woman (a waitress) who he planned to spend the night with until she proved too drunk to direct the cabbie to her own address? Blair's self-respect long since snorted up his nose, the tawdriness of going home with someone liquored up like that apparently didn't register. Failing to dump her back at the bar, which had closed, she was so far gone, he and a hotel concierge had to get her up to a room in a wheelchair.   Maybe if he'd rewritten the book about three times, it might've turned out O.K. Over that stretch of time, anyway, he just might have grown up a bit and maybe even reflected that in his book. As is, it's a largely tedious read leavened by the train-wreck spectacle of wretched excess. ---

       STARBUCKS & POLITICS  Just when you think it couldn't get any stranger...it does.  Did you hear the one about the Department of Defense employee who left his handwritten  urlLink notes  from a Pentagon briefing session at a Starbucks in Dupont Circle?  Seems the notes were taken during an early Sunday morning briefing with Secretary Donald Rumsfeld prior to appearing on the Sunday talk circuit.  A customer of the Starbucks in question then turned the notes over to the  urlLink Center for American Progress .

This thing will go away soon and what will keep it alive will be one of us going over the line. "  * " POSSIBLE Q's FOR SUNDAY TALK SHOWS --Why didn't DoD respond to the attack on the USS Cole? --Why was the Administration focused on going after Iraq? --Why did it take so long to develop a plan to fight Al Queda? --Why did the Administration think it had 7 months to develop policy? --You say the Administration was developing a tougher policy.  Absent 9/11, why do you think it would have been more successful? --Ben-Veniste said a long string of reports on the use of airplanes as missiles was available.  Did you ever see them?"   " For many years our strategy in dealing with terrorism was defense and law enforcement.  We did some things like working on force protection, etc, but when Kobar Towers, USS Cole, East Africa Embassies were hit, we would send out FBI and look for people we extradite, arrest and prosecute.  After 9/11, the president said this was war.   That was a seminal, strategic insight and decision, the brilliance of which is reflected in the fact that it looks so obvious .  In fact it was not obvious because of our posture the many years before that, in which nobody said it was war.  In fact, us officials avoided the term war and took particular care of addressing it as a law enforcement matter.  We acted as if terrorism were fundamentally a law enforcement problem.  But we recognized as a military problem and we were treating it as war.  This had a lot of consequences.  1) If we're at war, we are fighting terrorists in their state and non state sponsors (law enforcement, you're looking for an individual or individuals).  In a war, the enemy is a collective--this collective was unusual as it wasn't an army or nation state it was a network of terrorists with state and non-state sponsors.  We went about developing a strategy to fight a non-state network: domestic/international intel; financial, military, diplomatic "    MARCH FOR WOMEN'S LIVES  On April 25, 2004,  more than 1,000 women's rights, civil rights, and health care organizations will be participating in the " urlLink March for Women's Lives " in Washington, DC.  It is expected to be one of the largest marches in over a decade.  The seven major sponsors of the event include: American Civil Liberties Union, Black Women's Health Imperative, Feminist Majority Foundation, NARAL Pro-Choice America, National Latina Institute for Reproductive Health, National Organization for Women and Planned Parenthood Federation of America.  According to the march website:  " The time is right for a public demonstration of historic size in support of reproductive freedom and justice for all women. Threats to these rights have never been so systematic and coordinated, and the lives and health of women have never faced such peril. On April 25th, in our Nation's Capitol we march to uphold--Choice, Justice, Access, Health, Abortion, Global and Family Planning. "   QUICKTAKES  01.  Now this is hilarious!

       BOYS LIKE US 1.08  " At ten, I had two posters on my bedroom wall. Erik Estrada, shirtless and sweaty, flexing his muscles for the camera in front of his police motorcycle, a seductive grin on his face, and the Village People, arrayed in feathers and leathers around a large yellow bulldozer parked eccentrically in the middle of an outdoor cafe in Key West. I didn't have a clue that little boys weren't supposed to enjoy looking at pictures of a TV hero's naked torso; nor did I know what the faux macho musical group were, or what their songs 'YMCA' and 'In The Navy' were really about--or even what the word gay meant.  I'm not trying to turn my childhood into a case study; I wouldn't presume to say that everyone who is gay is biologically so, or even that my own homosexuality is wholly determined by genetics. I don't believe that the higher mathematics of human sexuality, full of variables and imaginary numbers, can be reduced to such simple arithmetic. Nor should it be. I am trying to give you an idea of how deeply, how primordially, my sexual orientation is rooted in my personality, and how many problems it caused me before I finally accepted the facts. From the time I was capable of conscious thought, I wanted what I was not supposed to want, and I punished myself for wanting it. "---Mr. Dennis Hunter   FRIDAY MUST-READS  01.

       USHERED IN  As  urlLink 'Confessions'  spends its eighth week atop the Billboard 200 albums chart,  urlLink Usher Raymond  enters the record books on the Hot 100 singles chart.  Usher becomes only the third artist of the modern rock era to have three simultaneous top ten singles.  He becomes the first to earn that distinction since the Bee Gees did it in 1978.  The Beatles previously accomplished the feat in 1964.  Selling 214,000 copies, "Confessions" now parks three tracks in the top ten:  "Burn" at number one, "Yeah!" at number four and "Confessions, Part II" at number nine.   GORE ON BUSH: THE STORY REMAINS THE SAME  " Here is the pattern that I see: the President's mishandling of and selective use of the best evidence available on the threat posed by Iraq is pretty much the same as the way he intentionally distorted the best available evidence on climate change, and rejected the best available evidence on the threat posed to America's economy by his tax and budget proposals.   In each case, the President seems to have been pursuing policies chosen in advance of the facts -- policies designed to benefit friends and supporters -- and has used tactics that deprived the American people of any opportunity to effectively subject his arguments to the kind of informed scrutiny that is essential in our system of checks and balances.   The administration has developed a highly effective propaganda machine to imbed in the public mind mythologies that grow out of the one central doctrine that all of the special interests agree on, which -- in its purest form -- is that government is very bad and should be done away with as much as possible -- except the parts of it that redirect money through big contracts to industries that have won their way into the inner circle.   For the same reasons they push the impression that government is bad, they also promote the myth that there really is no such thing as the public interest. What's important to them is private interests. And what they really mean is that those who have a lot of wealth should be left alone, rather than be called upon to reinvest in society through taxes.   Perhaps the biggest false impression of all lies in the hidden social objectives of this Administration that are advertised with the phrase "compassionate conservatism" -- which they claim is a new departure with substantive meaning. But in reality, to be compassionate is meaningless, if compassion is limited to the mere awareness of the suffering of others. The test of compassion is action. What the administration offers with one hand is the rhetoric of compassion; what it takes away with the other hand are the financial resources necessary to make compassion something more than an empty and fading impression.

       IT'S ALL ABOUT FANTASIA      As Fantasia Barrino hit the last few notes of her final performance on "American Idol", the crowd was already on its feet.  Her performance of "I Believe" (written by AI fist season alumnus Tamyra Gray) was simply breathtaking.  She SANG that song!  As her eyes teared up and two of the judges were on their feet, she bowed gracefully and acknowledged the crowd.  In that moment, no one had a single doubt who the new "American Idol" was going to be.  Ms. Barrino's performance (after a mangled "Don't Cry Out Loud" from competitor Diana Degarmo) was one of those moments in a live performance where everything comes together and is nothing short of magic.  The chills ran down my spine and I was reduced to an emotional puddle.  As a confessed AI addict, those are the moments that take the show from the realm of oddity to the reality of a bonafide star.  It happened with Kelly Clarkson and Clay Aiken.  Fantasia announced her reign with a glorious performance of "Summertime".  Now, it is Fantasia Barrino's turn to rule.   QUICK LINKS  01.

       PLANETS OF THE UNIVERSE  A few years ago, I crossed paths with a gentleman in his early thirties.  He had been married for ten years and had a seven-year old daughter.  He had recently separated from his wife after telling her that he was gay.  He was in the process of discovering what gay was.  I really knew little about him.  He was a friend of a friend.  Yet, for some unknown reason, he reached out to me in his search for guidance and answers to questions that had perplexed him for years.  It's so odd that at times we can find more comfort talking to a relative stranger, than in a loved one or close friend.  I certainly did not have the answers to his questions.  All I could do was share my experience and offer support.  One day after talking on the phone for several hours, I rummaged through an old journal and found some entries from the time in my life where I faced many of the same questions he was tackling now.  I made a copy of a page and faxed it to him.  It had the following written on it:  " I am coming in.  At turns, I leap.  I crawl.  I get shoved.  I am pushed out.  I am dragged from my closet. I am stepping into the person I was meant to be. I am finding the new skin that my body, my heart, and my mind demands that I occupy. I am becoming comfortable with who I am and integrating that person and persona into my everyday world. I am realizing that as I get acclimated to my new skin, the process of going from a mental closet to the orbits that create my world is fully underway. From the circles that comprise my private life, my family life, my career life--the entire world around me is falling into place. I am a planet on an elliptical orbit waiting to crash into other objects. I am leaving my center--my closet--and traveling forth into a real world. With this new skin--a brilliant armor--I am venturing forth to slay dragons and claim my domain.   I am comfortable being who I am. I am validating my own existence. The many parts of my life are now being filtered through the cognizance and embrace of my sexual orientation.  Whether I look from a perspective of coming out or coming in--or perhaps a hybrid of both--I am achieving inner peace. Balance. Acceptance. Courage.  The overwhelming desire to be who I am. '  Happy Birthday D.  May your universe always be as beautiful as you are.

       SWORN STATEMENT      In today's   urlLink The Washington Post  , there are more horrific photographs of prison detainee abuse at the hands of U.S. soldiers in the Abu Ghraib prison.  Beyond the stomach-churning images, they have also obtained copies of some sworn detainee statements translated into English.  The following is a piece of the sworn testimony by Nori Samir Gunbar Al-Yasseri given on January 17, 2004:  " I, Nori Samir Gunbar AL-YASSERI, want to make the following Statement under oath:  One day in Ramadan, I don't know the exact date, we were involved in a fight in Compound 2, so they transferred us to the hardsite.  As soon as we arrived, they put sandbags over our heads and they kept beating us and called us bad names.  After they removed the sandbags they stripped us naked as a newborn baby.  Then they ordered us to hold our penises and stroke it and this was only during the night.  They started to take photographs as if it was a porn movie.  And they treated us like animals not humans.  They kept doing this for a long time.  No one showed us mercy.  Nothing but cursing and beating.  Then they started to write words on our buttocks, which we didn't know what it means.  After that they left us for the next two days naked with no clothes, with no mattresses, as if we were dogs.  And every single night this military guy comes over and beat us and handcuffed us until the end of his shift at 0400.  This was for three days and he didn't serve us dinner except for bread and tea.  If we had chicken, he would throw it away.  The first night when they stripped us naked they made us get on our hands and knees and they started to pile us one on top of the other.  They started to take pictures from the front to the back.  And if anyone want to know the details of this, take the negative from the night guard  and you will find everything I said was true.  The next day the day shift gave us clothes and when the night shift started, the same guard who tortured us the night before came and took the clothes and left us naked and handcuffed to the bed.  At the end of his shift he uncuffed us and then he punch us in the stomach and hit us on the head and face.  Then he goes home.  I kept thinking what is he going to do to us the next night, this white man with the white glasses.  When I see him I'm scared to death.  Again, watch the pictures in his belongings.  He and the two short female soldiers and the black soldier during this dark night.  When we were naked he ordered us to stroke, acting like we're masturbating and when we start to do that he would bring another inmate and sit him down on his knees in front of the penis and take photos which looked like this inmate was putting the penis in his mouth.  Before that, I felt that someone was playing with my penis with a pen.  After this they make Hashim (NFI) stand in front of me and they forced me to slap him on the face, but I refused cause he is my friend.  After this they asked Hashim to hit me, so he punched my stomach.  I asked him to do that, so they don't beat him like they had beaten me when I refused to hit Hashim.  Nori Samir, Hussein, Hiadar, Hathem, Mustafa Hadi Saleh, Hashim, Ahmed Sabri, those are the names of the people who were there at this night which we felt like 1000 nights.

       JASON CAMERON MAKES ANYTHING   BETTER   TOLERABLE  This morning I was going to rail about Deputy Secretary of Defense Paul Wolfowitz's moronic testimony yesterday at a Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing.  The man who is widely known as the "intellectual architect" of the war plan in Iraq actually said the following: " I would say of all the things that were underestimated, the one that almost no one that I know of predicted---was to properly estimate the resilience of the regime that had abused this country for 35 years. ".   To quote Homer Simpson, " D'Oh! ".  There is just too much bad news clogging my cerebral cortex.

       FALL-A-PALOOZA  This is the week that most of the major television networks announce their 2004-2005 line-ups.   NBC  presented its slate Monday.  ABC  and  The WB  are at bat today, followed by  CBS  and  FOX  on Thursday.  Among the highlights (and lowlights):  -- NBC  unspooled the complete pilot episode of the much-touted "Joey" to media buyers Monday.  Apparently, the buzz was much better than many had expected.   NBC  certainly has invested much on the success of the "Friends" successor.  It ordered 24 episodes (as opposed to the 18 of "Friends").  "Joey" will be sandwiched by the returning "Will & Grace" and "er".  -- NBC  returns "Fear Factor" and "Las Vegas" to Mondays and adds the Blair Underwood/Heather Locklear drama "LAX".  -- NBC  has given a two season pick-up to "Scrubs", three seasons to Carson Daly's late night show and seven mid-season pilots.  Donald Trump's "The Apprentice" will return on Saturdays.  "Average Joe" will continue as well.  -- ABC  will announce Elizabeth Vargas to fill the departing Barbara Walter's chair on "20/20" with co-host John Stossel.  -- ABC  will be cutting down on its comedies and many returning shows will be shuffled.  "NYPD Blue" which returns for its final season will see the next Steven Bochco drama "Blind Justice" take its place.  Reality programming will increase on  ABC , which has high hopes for "Wife Swap" (a clone of a British show) in which two mothers swap households.  -- ABC  will launch "Desperate Housewives", starring Felicity Huffman on Sunday as a companion to "Alias".  -- The WB  launches new comedies from Jeff Foxworthy and Drew Carey.  The also add the drama "The Mountain" from the producers of  FOX's  "The OC".  -- CBS  will add five new shows, including "Clubhouse" starring Mare Winningham and Dean Cain.  Rob Lowe and Joe Pantoliano will front "Dr. Vegas".  John Goodman headlines the comedy "Center of the Universe".  -- CBS's  best bet for a runaway hit:  "CSI: NY" starring Gary Sinise and Melina Kanakaredes.  -- FOX  will bring back "Tru Calling" and "Arrested Development" (both of which were feared to be on the chopping block).

       SERIOUSLY, DUDE, I'M GAY  Apparently, the  FOX  channel cannot get enough 'reality' television programming.  What's more, they apparently cannot get enough of gay men--faux or otherwise.  Despite the dismal failure of their last effort "Playing It Straight" (which never even aired to its conclusion), they're now touting a new summer series that sinks to new lows.  Two heterosexual males will compete by trying to convince various individuals that they are homosexuals.  The  FOX  press release describes their premise using such questionable phrases as: the contestants "immersing themselves in the gay lifestyle" and "turning gay overnight" as being "a heterosexual male's worst nightmare".   In its attempt to create entertainment by relying on and reinforcing stereotypes of how a gay man is supposedly defined,  FOX  has finally sunk itself into the basement of extremely vulgar taste. Singing 'Idols' and plastic surgery overload is one thing.  Continuing to use gay men (real or imaginary) to create titillating television is neither funny,nor entertaining.

       DAYS LIKE THESE  There are days when frustration and anger boil up.  You can feel it in the pit of your throat and the tightness of your musculature.  It's not one particular thing or person.  It's some strange amalgamate of recent days gone by.  The net effect of which is a dire need to release some of that pent up energy.  Yet, feeling this sticky malaise enveloping you like a cocoon.  Mama said there'd be days like these...   BOYS LIKE US 1.07  " The passage of time since then seems unreal, as did those rolling days of fun underscored by a knowledge indelible as a visceral twinge that I was bound for something different from most of the guys I knew. At the end of that year, I started a twenty-four-month relationship with a girl. We would go on dates and French-kiss, hold hands, cuddle in my father's Pinto wagon, even discuss getting married. She knew about my sexual preference (a friend had told her) and assured me she understood; we could work out a special clause before the wedding. It never occurred to us, in those days just before AIDS, that jealousy or lack of monogamy could be the end of us. I loved her, I liked to hold her. But I wasn't drawn to her physically. I hadn't started out to be a homosexual, to enjoy the bodies of other men, to forsake the acceptance of society for mere pleasure. And if I had, arrogance is the crib death of decision. Since I left home, I have tried and fought in vain for two relationships that didn't work out and I've resolved never to put myself above other gay men. What I work toward these days is survival in love, knowing the limits of any new design. " --- Mr. Michael T. Carroll   BAR STRATEGIES: PLACEMENT AND POSTURE  01.  THE STUD: Head back, tilted slightly to the side. Leaning against a wall under a flattering spotlight (carefully selected). Arms crossed. Most importantly, a look of aloof self-satisfaction on the face. You know everyone wants you; no, wishes he were you. Very attractive look to some people; repels others. Works best in a town where people don't know you.  02.  THE BROKEN-WINGED BIRD: Hunched over near a wall, or in a corner, a look of thinly veiled sadness on your face, but showing courage through it all. Your lover just dumped you, and you really need someone to talk to. You're vulnerable. An emotional sitting duck. This look attracts users, so extra caution is advised when meeting people this way. Also, do you really want people's first impression to be one of pity?  03.  THE DANCING QUEEN: Bouncing, swaying, and singing along to the music in the midst of conversation, hips in perpetual motion. Drink in one hand, maybe a cigarette in the other. Stands near the dance floor, or creates one if none exists. Knows everyone's first name; no one's last. This is someone who likes to have a good time and has the energy for it. Great on the dance floor, though may incorporate gymnastics or modern dance into his routine. If you love to dance, like to have a good time, this is your man. Don't expect much depth, though. And whatever you do, don't crowd his spotlight.  04.  READY, WILLING, AND ABLE: No, it's not the Three Faces of Eve. All three are there for the taking in one slinky package, strategically placed just outside the men's room door or near the exit. Knees are slightly spread (a preview of things to come?), one hand on hip, the other in the back pocket or maybe on someone's shoulder or chest. This guy can have sex ten times a day, and often does. He's into quantity, not quality. No need for lengthy courtships with this one. The look is guaranteed to get results, but it doesn't always attract the kind of guy you'd like to take home to Mom. Or just take home, for that matter.  05.  FRIEND OF BILL W: Erect posture, clean-cut, but with eyes that have seen a lot. He's spotless now, but there was a time when he was a mess. Not into booze, drugs, or cigarettes, but addicted to coffee. Stands well clear of the bar. Looking for clean-cut jock types, maybe just out of the closet. Heavy drinkers and druggies need not apply. Always able to carry on a lucid conversation, though may tire early by gay standards (by 1:00 a.m.). Attracts nice, straight-laced guys, some nerds. More established guys, too. Generally not recommended for big dance clubs or circuit parties.  06.  THE SHY GUY: Head down, eyes focused on shoes or drink. Alone, or maybe with one shy friend. Hangs out at the end of the bar with other quiet types. Doesn't have much to say. Modest to a fault. But looks are deceiving and still waters run deep. This one's been around; that's the real reason he keeps his eyes trained down. Too many ex's. Don't be fooled. This type's shyness is a disguise. The look will attract guys looking to settle down--poor fools. He's had a million of them.  07.  BETTY FORD DROPOUT: Slouched against the bar or the cigarette machine, a drink in one hand, another standing by, cigarette hanging our of his mouth while he speaks. The Xanax he took before leaving the house is reacting with the double martinis, and his speech is beginning to slur. An easy mark for unscrupulous types with low standards. Good sense of humor, when you can understand him. Usually travels alone, or with a small, dysfunctional group. Repels most, but attracts drug pushers and lowlifes looking for someone who won't remember them in the morning. Not pretty.  08.  THURSTON HOWELL WANNABE: Rigid posture, starched everything, including boxer shorts. Hair short and conservative. Stands far away from the crowd, viewing the world down his nose, with a hint of disapproval. Apparently not having a good time, except in commenting on the hoi polloi around him to his cloned friend. Looking for guys with money. Willing to overlook other flaws (alcohol abuse, fitness neglect) if there's plenty of money (or at least the appearance of it). Can't dance, and wouldn't anyway. Lousy in bed (too uptight). Attracts a lot of fakes. May turn away many decent people, including some with money. Not much fun at parties.

       TAMARA DE LEMPICKA      'Auto-Portrait (Tamara in the Green Bugatti)'  (c.1925)  Born in Poland in 1898, Tamara Gurwick-Gorska would become one of the most renowned artists of the Art Deco period.  Better known as Tamara de Lempicka, her life was as colorful as the paintings she is best known for.  She has long been one of my favorite artists and now her work is being given a new opportunity for the exposure it so richly deserves.  Starting May 15, London's Royal Academy mounts an exhibition of 58 de Lempicka's works at Burlington House in Picadilly.  The exhibit is scheduled to run until August 30.  The exhibit is then scheduled to move to Vienna, Austria at Kunstforum der Bank Austria for display from September 15 through January 2, 2005.  In 1917, de Lempicka fled with her first husband, Tadeus Lempicki, to Paris escaping the Russian Revolution.  There she studied at Academe de la Grand Chaumiere under the private tutelage of Maurice Denis.  However, it was Andre Lhote--painter, decorator, critic, art-teacher, theoretician--who would have lasting impact on de Lempicka's work and style.  Lhote is credited for a revisionist take on the period known as cubism.  Lhote's style was dubbed 'synthetic cubism'.  It took a 'safe' approach to the cubist style and used 'bourgeois' colors.  Tamara de Lempicka's works are widely regarded as being guided by a 'plastic metaphor'.  Her use of voluptuous lines and bright colors are the hallmarks of her portraiture.  In the decadence of 1920's Paris, de Lempicka's works were as controversial as they were celebrated.  In her private life, de Lempicka had a voracious sexual appetite.  A well-known bisexual, her stint in Paris saw her move in social circles of Natalie Barney, James Joyce, Jean Cocteau, André Gide, Isadora Duncan, Colette and the like.  Many critics have associated the unapologetic expression of female powerfulness and erotic self-confidence in her work with her sexuality.  After a string of affairs with women and men alike, Tamara de Lempicka eventually divorced Tadeuz and later married Baron Raoul Huffner.  In 1939, de Lempicka and Huffner moved to Hollywood.  Initially, Hollywood and New York embraced de Lempicka's work.  However, her flagrantly decadent style quickly fell out of style.  Her work became decidedly darker in hue and content.  In 1962, her second husband died and Tamara de Lempicka's career was over for all intents and purposes.  She moved to Mexico where she died in 1980.  Her daughter, Kizette (a subject of many de Lempicka works), scattered her ashes from a helicopter over Mexico.  The London show is the first new exhibition of Tamara de Lempicka's work in nearly thirty years (and twenty-four years after her death).     More of Tamara de Lempicka's work can be seen  urlLink here    ANDERSON COOPER  Regular readers know that I make no secret of my crush on journalist Anderson Cooper.  Beyond his physical good looks, I've always admired his thoughtful and provocative work.  I find the infusion of his personality and humor into his work very appealing.  However, it his work as a brilliant field reporter that stand Mr. Cooper a cut above.   Media Bistro  has a nice little Q&A with Mr. Cooper:   urlLink "So What Do You Do, Anderson Cooper?"

       JACKASSES OF THE WEEK  Yeah, I know it's only Monday.  But, there's never a lack of assitude in this fine country of ours.  01.  DONALD RUMSFELD:   " If there's a failure, it's me. It's my failure for not understanding and knowing that there were hundreds or however many there are of these things that could eventually end up in the public and do the damage they've done. But I certainly never gave the president the - a briefing with the impact that one would have, had you'd seen the photographs or the videos.  I mean, let there be no doubt about that. He was just as blindsided as the Congress and me and everyone else... "  02.  DICK CHENEY: " People ought to let him do his job. "  03.  WILLIAM SAFIRE: " This secretary of defense, who has the strong support of the president, is both effective and symbolic. If he were to quit under political fire, pressure would mount for America to quit under insurgent fire. Hang in there, Rummy! You have a duty to serve in our 'long, hard slog'. "  (*BONUS ASSITUDE*) " Torture is both unlawful and morally abhorrent. But what about gathering intelligence from suspected or proven terrorists by codified, regulated, manipulative interrogation? Information thus acquired can save thousands of lives. Will we now allow the pendulum to swing back to 'name, rank, serial number,' as if suspected terrorists planning the bombing of civilians were uniformed prisoners of war obeying the rules of war? "   And The Ass Of The Week:  04.  RUSH LIMBAUGH:   " This is no different than what happens at the Skull and Bones initiation, and we're going to ruin people's lives over it, and we're going to hamper our military effort, and then we are going to really hammer them because they had a good time? You know, these people are being fired at every day. I'm talking about people having a good time, these people, you ever heard of emotional release? You [ever] heard of need to blow some steam off? "    QUICKTAKES  01.  Former First Lady Nancy Reagan  urlLink endorses human embryo research .   02.  John Zogby says:  urlLink "The Election Is Kerry’s To Lose" .    BLOOD MERIDIAN  Cormac McCarthy's stunning " urlLink Blood Meridian : Or the Evening Redness in the West " has been churning in development hell since the early 1990s waiting to be brought to the big screen.    McCarthy's book is a personal favorite even though I've never been a real fan of the "Western" genre.  However in McCarthy's striking words, there is a majesty and complexity that manages to convey a stark sense of realism and an unvarnished look at true evil and brutality.  Set in the 1840's near the Texas/Mexico border, McCarthy's tale of ruthless bounty hunters out for Indian scalps is seen through the eyes of a 14 year-old Tennesseean named Kid.  In the late nineties, the biggest push for the novel to be adapted was made by actor Tommy Lee Jones (who also wanted to direct).  Jones was to rewrite a initial script by Steve Tesich and develop the film for Columbia Pictures.  At the time Scott Rudin was set to produce, but the film never got off the ground.  Now, Scott Rudin is reviving the project for Paramount.  Rudin is said to be close to signing William Monahan to tackle the script.  Monahan's writing partner just happens to be director Ridley Scott--who Rudin would like to direct the film adaptation. No word on casting at this point, but I hope this time they finally get it to theaters.

       FAILURE #948,655 OF THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION  While President George W. Bush drives around in his cute little red and blue bus asking the American public to renew his contract for four more years, another scandal of stupefying proportions is about to get spin control from the White House.  When word finally leaked that CBS had obtained photographs depicting the assault, humiliation and torture of Iraqi detainees and was planning on airing them, the horror of those images was just the beginning of a story that demands public attention.  CBS has already acknowledged that it sat on its story for an unspecified period of time at the behest of the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs General Richard Myers.  While the government position was that due to the failing negotiations and unrest on the ground, the release of the photos would be detrimental--the real knowledge of how widespread the problems with treatment of prisoners was already well-known in high-level military circles.  Yesterday, General George W. Casey, Jr.  urlLink revealed  to the press that in the course of 16 months, the Army had conducted more than 30 criminal investigations into misconduct by American captors in Iraq and Afghanistan.  Included in these investigations were 10 cases of suspicious death, 10 cases of abuse and two deaths determined to have been criminal homicides.  The fact that the Pentagon felt this was newsworthy only after the disclosure of photographs speaks volumes.  Incredibly, a fifty-three page report completed in February detailed the scope of the problems in startling detail.  Written by Major General Antonio M. Taguba, the report included such passages as the following:   "Breaking chemical lights and pouring the phosphoric liquid on detainees; pouring cold water on naked detainees; beating detainees with a broom handle and a chair; threatening male detainees with rape; allowing a military police guard to stitch the wound of a detainee who was injured after being slammed against the wall in his cell; sodomizing a detainee with a chemical light and perhaps a broom stick, and using military working dogs to frighten and intimidate detainees with threats of attack, and in one instance actually biting a detainee.   [To read more about the Taguba report, check out this piece in   urlLink  The New Yorker  .]  After the obvious lack of information flow that was uncovered during the 9/11 Commission testimony, it appears that the problem was not only chronic in the intelligence community--but in all of the branches of the Bush government.   IS HE OR ISN'T HE?  There's a fascinating profile of Secretary of State Colin Powell in the June 2004 issue of  urlLink  GQ  .  Written by Wil S. Hylton, "Casualty Of War" takes a look at Powell's place in the Bush Administration and his future in that post.  While stories continue to circulate about Powell's fractured relationship with Bush's inner-sanctum, Hylton looks not only to Powell, but his friends and advisors for insight.   POLITICS AND THE HOUSE OF MOUSE  The Walt Disney Company is  urlLink refusing  to distribute Miramax's "Fahrenheit 911".  The film is the newest documentary by Michael Moore, who has been highly critical of the Bush Administration and its policies.  "Fahrenheit 911" is said to include a scathing rebuke of President Bush's actions prior to--and after--9/11.  The film also draws out relationships between Bush and prominent Saudis, including the family of Osama bin Laden.  Word has it that Disney is afraid of gaining the ire of the Bush family and their political cronies.  It seems Disney enjoys massive tax relief in its sizeable properties and ventures in the state of Florida--where coincidentally, Jeb Bush is Governor.  Of course, I'm sure this is all covered in an obscure subsection of The Patriot Act.  Who knew censorship wore a pair of black   mouse   rat ears?

       HOLLYWOOD NOTES  01.  Earlier this year, NBC's licensing agreement with Universal Television for it's highly-rated  urlLink "Law & Order: Special Victims Unit"  expired.  That event set off several heated rounds of negotiations between the network and Universal to keep all of Dick Wolf's "Law & Order" stable at NBC.  As usual money was at the crux, but it now appears that a deal acceptable to each side has been negotiated.  While neither NBC nor Universal have officially announced their agreement, sources say the pressure was on to make a deal prior to NBC's announcement of their fall schedule on May 17.   The renewal calls for a commitment of at least four more seasons (with renewal options) of each "Law & Order", "Law & Order: Special Victims Unit" and "Law & Order: Criminal Intent".  Additionally, NBC will acquire the rights to a new series, "Law & Order 4: Trial By Jury".  The fourth L&O franchise is currently slated as a mid-season replacement for NBC.  In casting news, Dennis Farina will be joining the cast of the original "Law & Order".  Negotiations are currently underway to have Jerry Orbach (Dt. Lennie Briscoe) transition to "Law & Order 4: Trial By Jury".  02.  FX has picked up its highly acclaimed detective series  urlLink "The Shield"  for a fourth season.  The fifteen episode order is slated to begin airing in January 2005.  The current season of "The Shield" wraps June 15.  03.  David Duchovny's directorial film debut "House Of D" had its world-premiere recently at the NYC's Tribeca Film Festival.  The film starring Robin Williams, Tea Leoni, and Duchovny, is a coming-of-age story.  The film will hit theaters this fall under a distribution deal with Lion's Gate Films.  04.  Previews begin Off-Broadway on Thursday for the highly anticipated musical  urlLink "Here Lies Jenny" .  Starring Bebe Neuwirth and directed by Roger Rees, "Here Lies Jenny" was choreographed by Ann Reinking and features the music of Kurt Weill.  "Jenny" opens May 27 at the Zipper Theatre on West 37th for 36 performances.  05.  Roman Polanski's next film will be a reworking of "Oliver Twist" set to begin production in Prague in July.  Sir Ben Kingsley has signed on in the role of Fagin in this adaptation of Charles Dickens' novel.  Sony Pictures has acquired the rights to distribute the film in North and South America.  06.  The casting for Robert Luketic's "Monster-In-Law" is now complete with the addition of Adam Cooper ("Torque") to play Jennifer Lopez's sidekick.  The film also stars Jane Fonda and Michael Vartan.  07.  Rosie O'Donnell's first post- Rosie  gig will be executive producing and starring in "Riding The Bus With My Sister" for CBS.  O'Donnell will play a mentally retarded woman who fills her days by riding city buses.  The screenplay is based on the 2002 book by Rachel Simon.   DYING AND LIVING  I tried one last time.  I basically pleaded without shame.  There was one last chance--or so I thought.  Her voice was cold and brusque.  I kept expecting the phone to be slammed down in my ear.  But, she listened.  Or maybe, she didn't.  Twelve year earlier, they had kicked their only son out of their home.  He was seventeen.  His crime was being gay.  They said their actions were dictated by their religious beliefs.  I could never understand a religion that would have your abandon your own flesh.  D.'s life was not an easy one.  By the time I'd met him, he'd been in rehab and sold himself for drug money.  It would be so easy to dismiss him--and many did.  Yet, I saw in him what many did not.  A man who was creative, artistic and trying.  Trying to wrestle the demons and deal with the emotional baggage he carried.    We were never close friends, I suppose.  I'd lose track of him for a year or two and then he'd show up again.  I always accepted all his late night calls.  I think more than anything, D. was in search of someone who would listen to him.  One day the phone rings.  The voice on the other end tells me that D. is dying of AIDS and is in hospice care.  After that call, I had to sit down--and so many memories flooded with the tears.  It would have been so much nicer to stay with the 'good' memories.  So much easier to let him leave this earth with the mental pictures I had of him filed away in the scrapbooks of my mind.  But, I couldn't do it.  For some reason, I knew I had to see him before he died.  He asked me to call his mother.  He wanted one last chance to get something from her that he'd never had in his entire life.  She listened to my words.  There were silences.  I waited for some kind of emotion--some acknowledgement of what I had just relayed to her.  He wants to see you.  He needs you.  The words just seemed to amplify in my head.  She said thank you.  Then, she asked me to never call her again.  Two weeks later, D. died  This past Saturday would have been his birthday.  In the end, we all make choices and must live with the repercussions of those choices.  Some are easy to gloss over--and others will never leave your soul.  Even in death.

       THE OPPOSITE SEX      Tonight the Showtime cable network airs the first half of a two film documentary project by Academy Award-nominated filmmaker Josh Aronson ("Sound and Fury", "Playing For Real").  The first film,  urlLink "The Opposite Sex: Rene's Story" , explores the journey of Renee--a 31 year-old genetic female from Anaheim, California.   From age 3, Rene told her mother that she was a boy and that God had made a mistake.  Rene's tumultuous teen years were spent taping down her breasts and dating girls.  Hounded by rumors and innuendo, Rene fought to be what she knew in her heart she was meant to be.  At the age of 22, Rene (with the aid of an altered ID) married an 18 year-old heterosexual woman named Wona.  Rene's life-long path to becoming a man and the painful consequences of his final transition and surgery has on his marriage form the heart of "The Opposite Sex: Rene's Story".   In one single act of betrayal,  a disgruntled relative basically outs Rene and Wona to their church congregation and starts a path of self-discovery for each of them.  Aronson picks up the story of Rene and Wona after that watershed moment.  What ensues is a cross-country trip seeking out a surgeon to complete Rene's transformation and glimpses of how family members on each side deal with the news of who Rene is.  It is also a journey that will test Rene and Wona's relationship.  In other hands, this considerate and engaging documentary could have easily been rendered as exploitive.  Instead, Aronson is intent to explore issues of gender and transexuality through his subjects with a profound respect.  The film is challenging and raises many difficult questions.  The film does include some footage of Rene's gender reassignment surgery.  However, the obvious focus of the film is Rene and Wona.  It's a story of flawed people who bare their lives for Aronson's camera.  The pure honesty of their words is compelling and unique.  "The Opposite Of Sex: Rene's Story" will run throughout May.  In June, Showtime will unveil the companion documentary "The Opposite Sex: Jamie's Story".  This film chronicles a 47 year-old male-to-female gender reassignment candidate.  While both films have made the film festival circuit, they lose none of their power on the small screen.  The films together challenge preconceived notions many hold regarding trangenderism and may leave you with new insight and understanding of the issues facing transgendered individuals.

       BOYS LIKE US 1.09  " Sexual interests, concerns, and observations form a broad and pervasive field within every personality, as broad in me as it is in you, as broad in the straight man as it is in the gay woman. When we speak of burgeoning sexuality, that's the internal field we speak of--not the social field defined by what percentage of us are gay or straight. The discourse behind that same rhetoric of singularity is, of course, the discourse which believes that a single homosexual event can make an otherwise straight person turn gay--or that the single proper heterosexual experience can 'cure' someone gay and turn him or her straight.

       THE MYTH OF SOVEREIGNTY  President Bush's fabled transfer of power to the free people of Iraq has happened.  Curiously, it happened two days earlier than planned and was obscured by a veil of secrecy.  While I hope for the sake of the Iraqi people that they are able to bring some semblance of order to their shattered country, I can't help but think the Bush Administration wants to wash its hands clean of the whole mess--as quickly as possible.    The brief ceremony held to celebrate the transfer was virtually free of U.S. media.  The networks that had sent their anchors to cover the June 30th event were left scrambling.  Only two major networks  urlLink managed  to get people into the actual ceremony.   CNN's  Christiane Amanpour and  ABC's  Peter Jennings were witness to the ceremony.  Yet, their cell phones were confiscated prior to the ceremony to prevent any press leak. Of course, the argument to be made is that the secrecy was necessary to prevent any subversion of the handover.  But the cynic in me, can't help but wonder if it was not a carefully orchestrated plan on the part of the Bush Administration.  Hold a cut-and-run ceremony, shuttle a tearful Paul Bremer away before it was over--and most importantly--make sure that most citizens of the U.S. were fast asleep and the media was stifled.  Cold and calculated and seemingly executed according to the modus operandi of the Bush Administration of late.  It was obvious to everyone (except the Bush Administration) that the political machinery that the U.S. had set up in Iraq was not viable to the people of Iraq. Against a backdrop of escalating violence as they headed to the June 30th deadline, the quick fix was to leave as soon as possible.  Yet, while the politicos may be gone, the men and women of the U.S. Armed Forces are left on the ground with an ill-defined purpose.  Interestingly, the Pentagon  urlLink announced  Tuesday that it would be calling up as many as 6,500 reserve soldiers from a rarely tapped pool for service in Iraq and Afghanistan.   Whatever you call what happened Monday, it is clear that uncertainty is still the word for the future of Iraq and the lives of thousands of members of coalition forces.   IT'S GETTING HARRY  I have a confession to make.  I've not read one volume of J.K. Rowling's ubiquitous Harry Potter series.  Further, I've not seen one of the films made of her works.  I do own the books, but I just can't get myself to read them.  Of course, I also walked out of 'The Lord Of The Rings' because I couldn't get 'into' the movie.  I'm weird like that.  For those of you Potter fans, the title of the sixth volume in the series has just been  urlLink announced .  It will be entitled 'Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince'.  No release date has been scheduled as of yet.

       AT WHAT TEMPERATURE DOES FREEDOM BURN?      Like nearly three million other people across the country this weekend, I endured long lines and sold-out signs to get my tickets to see Michael Moore's  urlLink 'Fahrenheit 9/11' .  For just under two hours, I sat with a packed house in near darkness and cycled through a bevy of emotions.  From laughter to anger, outrage to tears, there was an electricity that zapped around the theatre and charged the crowd with a shared magnetic connection.  It was impossible to avoid talking heads and media discussion prior to seeing the film, as they deconstructed whether or not 'Fahrenheit 9/11' was being fairly called a documentary.  Make no mistake, Mr. Moore is certainly not trying to present a fair and balanced picture of the Bush Administration.  For that, we can only rely on  FOX News  (yeah, right).  But to accuse Mr. Moore of simply creating a Bush polemic is unfair at the very least.  As the group I saw it with discussed afterwards, how many documentaries don't have a slant or viewpoint.  Is Mr. Moore's slant heavy? No doubt.  But it is with an artfully wielded set of documentarian's tools that Mr. Moore builds his case and presents it to his audience for their rumination.  Whether you are a Republican, Democrat or somewhere else on the political spectrum, you owe it to yourself to see this film.  What you take away from it may be completely unique to you.  But believe me, you  WILL  take something away when you step out of that theatre.  There are moments that are truly squirm-inducing.  There are glimpses of President Bush and cronies like Paul Wolfowitz that are nauseatingly disturbing.  Watching Bush sit in that classroom and pander on a golf course was enough to make my stomach turn.  If Americans really need any further proof that we must change the leadership of this country, then please see 'Fahrenheit 9/11'.  To go into the film at any more detail would ruin the impact and experience.  However, it has to be said whether you like Michael Moore or not, you cannot take away the fact that he has crafted a well-made film. ------------------------ If box office projections hold, 'Fahrenheit 9/11' will finish the weekend as the #1 movie (ahead of 'White Chicks', 'Dodge Ball' and 'The Notebook').  The film's projected $21.8 million dollar box office is even more impressive when one considers that it opened at only 868 screens.  In comparison, 'White Chicks' opened on 2,726 screens with a gross of $19.6 million.  'Fahrenheit 9/11' had the third largest opening of any film this year with an impressive $25,115 per screen average.  It also set a slew of house records across the country, and interestingly enough, in states that are considered Republican leaning.  'Fahrenheit 9/11' also becomes the first documentary in history to land in a weekend top five--let alone in the top slot.  According to  Editor & Publisher , the film is also being reviewed well by U.S. daily newspapers.   An  E&P   urlLink survey  of 63 daily papers that ran reviews found that 56 gave the film a positive nod, with only 7 abstaining, an almost 90% favorable rating. The seven newspapers in the "anti" camp were:  Detroit Free Press ,  Denver Rocky Mountain News ,  San Jose Mercury-News ,  New York Post ,  South Florida Sun-Sentinel ,  Philadelphia Daily News  and the  Charlotte Observer .  Among the "pro" crowd were reviewers from moderate to conservative papers such as the  Boston Herald ,  Los Angeles Daily News ,  San Diego Union-Tribune  and  Las Vegas Review-Journal .

Fans of the exquisitely done 'Masterpiece Theatre' adaptation have long clamored for a big screen treatment. The film will be directed by David Yates and scripted by Andrew Davies.    The most intriguing leak at the moment is the cast Yates wants (and is likely to get).  The film would star Jennifer Connelly, Paul Bettany and Jude Law.  Connelly and Law would play brother and sister Julia and Sebastian Flyte.  Bettany would helm the role of Charles Ryder.  Currently in development,  Warner Independent Pictures  will distribute.

Yes, Jack Ryan, your constituents don't take  urlLink kindly  to men who want their wife to have sex with strangers in a cage.  Crazy, I know.  03. I really like Donna Brazile.  She says it like it is.  Read her new book  urlLink 'Cooking With Grease: Stirring the Pots in American Politics'   04.  urlLink 'The Graham Norton Effect  premiered on  Comedy Central  last night with guests Sandra Bernhard and Marlon Wayans.  The show was at turns bawdy, brilliant and always funny.  A mix of audience participation, sex toys, and outrageous guests and stunts makes for originality and entertainment.  05.  For your weekend to-do list:  see Michael Moore's provocative  urlLink 'Fahrenheit 9/11'   06.  Watch for Lara Fabian's 'The Last Goodbye' to tear up dance floors across the world.

       QUICKTAKES  01.   The New York Times  takes the White House to task on its recent release of documents regarding treatment of prisoner detainees.  In  urlLink 'The White House Papers' , the editorial staff writes:  " We're still being denied the full picture because the documents on planning for the treatment of prisoners were selected by the White House, which has for months ignored the Senate Armed Services Committee's demand for the whole record. These hundreds of pages, which the administration has kept classified for so long, pose no possible security danger. About the only thing in them worth keeping secret was the degree to which the administration had decided to exempt itself from the Geneva Conventions and then spent months debating whether there was a legalistic way to justify what ordinary people would consider the torture of prisoners. "  02.  A second look at Bill Clinton's  urlLink 'My Life'  for  The New York Times  courtesty of author Larry McMurtry:   urlLink 'Confessions of a Policy Wonk' .  " William Jefferson Clinton's 'My Life' is, by a generous measure, the richest American presidential autobiography--no other book tells us as vividly or fully what it is like to be president of the United States for eight years.   03.   Technology Marketing Corporation (TMC)   urlLink rates  on-line news media websites for reliability and speed.  04.   CNNmoney  reports that AOL has  urlLink purchased  Advertising.com for $435 million dollars in a cash-only transaction.  The move leaves AOL to expand its on-line advertising imprint.  05.  The latest reality-TV brainchild of Mark Burnett has found a home at  CBS  after an intense bidding war.  Burnett, creator of the ever-popular 'Survivor' series, has sold the network a series tentatively titled  urlLink 'Rock Star' .  Described as a cross between 'American Idol' and 'Survivor', the winner of the series will become the lead singer of '80's rock band INXS.  The series is currently slated for two one-hour episodes for 13 weeks.

Is it any coincidence that the Republican-controlled Senate voted to affirm the Bush Administration's policy on banning media coverage of returning military war dead?  Would the Bush policy be any different if it weren't for that little thing in November called an election?  02.  When are politicos going to learn that their sex lives are going to come under scrutiny when then run for political office?  Face it, your position on public sex in cages is going to appeal to your electorate far more than your position on the issues.  03.  As June 30th looms near, am I the only one who thinks that the current violence and hostage killings is a mere prelude of the horror to come?  04.  Poor, poor Secretary of State Colin Powell.  How many times can one man shoulder the blunders of the Bush Administration? Further, shouldn't employees of the State Department be able to count?  No child left behind, indeed.   CASTING, DEALS, DENIALS AND DEPARTURES  01.  Oscar winner Tim Robbins has signed on to the lead role of 'Zathura'.  The film will be directed by Jon Favreau ('Elf'). The children's fantasy is based on the book of the same title by Chris Van Allsburg, who wrote 'Jumanji'.  While the film is based on a board game that transports kids into an intergalactic environment, it's technically not a sequel as none of the first film's characters appear.  The project is being developed at  Paramount .  Robbins will next be seen in Michael Winterbottom's 'Code 46' which opens August 6th.  02.  Recent Tony winner for Best Book of a Musical for 'Avenue Q', Jeff Whitty, has signed with  Plan B  and  Warner Bros.  for his first big screen adaptation.  The project called 'Zora' is based on the true story of Zora Colakovic, which first appeared on Ira Glass'  National Public Radio  show 'This American Life'.  Colakovic was a young woman who wanted to be a CIA agent. She trained herself intellectually and physically only to be rejected by the agency. Shattered, she rebuilt herself into a formidable bounty hunter.  03.  David Johnson and Scott William Alvarez of  Cinema Revival  have acquired the rights to Jeremy Jackson's novel 'Life at These Speeds'.  The novel tells the story of a teenager who runs from the guilt of surviving a bus accident that kills his classmates only to become a hero in another town.  The book will be adapted by Mark Novak and Jessica Landaw will make her feature directorial debut.  04.  Michael Moore's controversial film 'Fahrenheit 9/11' has lost its battle with the Motion Picture Association of America.  The film's distributors  Lion's Gate  and  IFC Films  had petitioned the MPAA Ratings Board to change the film's rating from "R" to a more box-office friendly "PG-13".  The film will have to stick with a "R" rating due to what the Board found ' violent and disturbing images and for language '. The offending images include an Iraqi man tossing a dead baby into a truckload of bodies, Iraqis burned by napalm and a public beheading in Saudi Arabia.  Mr. Moore's response: ' I encourage all teenagers to come see my movie, by any means necessary. If you need me to sneak you in, let me know. '      05.  Actress Elisabeth Rohm will depart from NBC's 'Law & Order' after approximately 13 episodes next season.  Rohm, who plays ADA Serena Southerlyn, will have become the longest running actress to hold that spot eclipsing such notables as Carrie Lowell, Jill Hennessey and Angie Harmon.  Rohm negotiated her stay into next season with series creator Dick Wolf to allow Dennis Farina to join the cast.  Ms. Rohm is currently shooting 'Miss Congeniality 2' and is expected to seek more big screen work.

Young's 'Masquerade' has been optioned by the Los Angeles-based  Dream Entertainment .  'Masquerade' chronicles the true story of Deborah Sampson, who during the American Revolution fought as a Continental soldier disguised as a man named Robert Shurtliff.

Martin has concluded a multi-year, multi-million dollar extension on his contract to stay with Dick Wolf's 'Law and Order'.

Owen Wilson has signed to star opposite Natalie Portman in Richard Linklater's 'The Smoker'.  Wilson will play a teacher at a private girls' school where one of his students develops a crush on him, invites him home to dinner and asks to marry him, with the encouragement of her eccentric parents.  The script is based on a David Schickler short story that originally appeared in the Summer 2000 Debut Fiction issue of the  New Yorker , and quickly was snapped up by Paramount-based producer Scott Rudin.

I just didn't have the heart (or energy) to retype (or remember) the whole thing.  So instead, I wish you all a weekend filled with friends, fun and good health.

       QUICKTAKES  01.  The Human Rights campaign  urlLink endorses  Senator John Kerry for President:   " I want to thank HRC for its endorsement. We have worked together on so many battles and we still have many challenges ahead of us.  I know that America finds its strength in the diversity of this great country. I have worked for than 20 years to make sure that LGBT Americans are treated with dignity in our society and equality in our laws. That fight is not over and I will be there for the fights in the future. ”  02.  Another of the Bush Administration's dirty little secrets is coming to light in the form of prisoner who was secretly held in an Iraqi prison for nearly nine months.  Apparently at the request of former CIA Director George Tenet, the so-called "high value target" was secreted away on orders from Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld.     urlLink 'Triple X' , as the prisoner was code-named, was not assigned an internment identification as is required under international law.  Nor was his presence disclosed to the International Committee of the Red Cross.  Department of Defense officials say his secret status was supposed to be temporary and deny he was a ghost detainee.  The official reason given:   the CIA and the Pentagon " dropped the ball " by failing to review his status for more than eight months despite two requests by low-level military personnel to reclassify the prisoner, and integrate him into the general prison population.    Yeah, right.  I'm sure it had nothing to do with healing broken bones and bruises.   INTERESTING READS  01.   The New York Times :  Maureen Dowd:   urlLink 'Smack That Cheney-Bot!'  02.

       NOTABLE & QUOTABLE  " I mean, I'm cheeky, I'm sexy, whatever. You know, I've got a lot of life inside " --Ms. Teresa Heinz Kerry  " Though [Henry] James was not strongly sexual, so far as I could see, in either direction he had extraordinary intuition into the sexual life, and the emotions connected with that and with marriage. His portrait of an unhappy marriage in the `Portrait of a Lady' is astonishing for somebody who was never married. " --Mr. David Lodge, on his forthcoming biography of James  " There are many things that are of concern and taught by the church with respect to war, with respect to the environment, with respect to poor people, our responsibilities to each other, and I am very comfortable with where I am with respect to those.  But I am not a spokesperson for the church, and the church is not a spokesperson for the United States of America. " --Senator John Kerry on President Bush's appeal to The Vatican to help push his conservative social agenda in the U.S.  " I started undressing. Watching you shed your attire and display your taut body did not excite me immediately, maybe because the smell of our unwashed clothing dampened desire. It was only when you had completed your transformation that my bowing to your beauty took hold. In your baggy boxer trunks and shirtsleeves rolled up in tight bands around your globed biceps, you were what my grandfather would have called "a splendid specimen." You caught me staring at you and smiled, and my willingness to ruin myself for love seemed a choice that only a bitter man would disapprove of. " --Mr. Brendan Lemon, from his first novel 'Last Night'  " The Senate Republican leadership is aiming for a mid-July vote on a constitutional amendment that would ban gay marriage, forcing Democrats to take a stand on the controversial topic just before the party heads to Boston for its presidential nominating convention. " --Mr. Matt Drudge, in today's 'Drudge Report'  " I tend to write stories about me going up against something.  I guess I'm attracted to situations where I have to overcome the odds.

       RULES, RUGBY AND RANTS  --The July issue of  urlLink  Out   has let the virgin out of the bag.  Viewers of the  MTV's  thirteenth season of  urlLink 'Road Rules'  (tagged: X-Treme) were introduced to the six new cast members, including Danny, the requisite gay guy.  Turns out this season will have two gay male competitors--a first for the 'Road Rules' franchise.  Stepping in for an original who is booted, will be 22 year-old Nick (a self-proclaimed virgin).  Derrick will be thrilled  --Speaking of  Out , the sports-themed issue proclaims that 'Rugby Rocks!'.  After flipping through the fashion layout featuring models from NYC's  urlLink Gotham Knights , I find myself curiously interested in the game.  Though Oscar Wilde once remarked that "rugby is a gamed played by men with funny shaped balls", I'd play with them.  --Yesterday the official White House portraits of President and First Lady Clinton were  urlLink unveiled .  Both striking portraits were painted by self-taught artist  urlLink Simmie Knox , who becomes the first black artist to paint a presidential portrait.  -- The New York Times : Paul Krugman:   urlLink 'Travesty of Justice'     --" Hush, You don't have to say a word.

       REQUIESCAT IN PACE:  RAY CHARLES       "Mr. Charles could sound suave or raw, brash or hesitant, joyful or desolate, insouciant or tearful, earthy or devout. He projected the primal exuberance of a field holler and the sophistication of a bebopper; he could conjure exaltation, sorrow and determination within a single phrase."    The New York Times : John Pareles and Bernard Weinraub:   urlLink 'Ray Charles, Bluesy Essence of Soul, Is Dead at 73'    SIX FEET UNDER      The Fisher family returns this weekend on  HBO .   urlLink 'Six Feet Under'  is without doubt the most well-written drama on television.  The ensemble cast is pitch-perfect in bringing to life characters that are real people.  Flawed and fierce, you can't help but come to care for the Fishers.  I know I'll be parked in front of my set on Sunday. Every day above ground is indeed a good one.

       THURSDAY MUST-READS  01.   The New York Times : Maureen Dowd:   urlLink 'Epitaph and Epigone'  02.   mediabistro.com : Allison Burnett:   urlLink 'Coming Out'  03.   the advocate.com :   urlLink 'New Mexico clerk continues fight for same-sex marriage'    MUST-SEE LINK OF THE DAY  DTripTV:   urlLink 'Republican Survivor'    FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION      An early entree into the 2005 Oscar race for Best Actress should be given to Ms. Anne Reid ('Love and Death On Long Island') for her stunning turn as May in  urlLink 'The Mother' .  The film, deftly directed by Brit Roger Michell ('Notting Hill', 'Changing Lanes'), is a superb character study of a woman who must confront the loss of her husband and the state of her family.  In what could have easily been an over-the-top melodrama, Reid imbues May with an electric rawness tempered by soulful fragility.  During the course of 'The Mother', May tries to find her place in her son and daughter's lives--as well as her own. Circumstances bring May to an affair with a man half her age (who also happens to be sleeping with her daughter).  In a wonderfully nuanced script by Hanif Kureishi ('My Beautiful Laundrette', 'Sammy and Rosie Get Laid'), Ms. Reid is able to give a single glance the weight of a million words and the audience a view of her soul.

       RANDOM THOUGHTS  01.  I was desperately trying not to mention the late President Reagan in my weblog.  It will come as no surprise to anyone who visits here even on an infrequent basis, that my politics lean left.  As much hate as I have for President Bush, there's plenty left over for Reagan.  I am frankly loathe to turn on my television any more this week.  Every channel seems to have a rosy tribute to Reagan.  But what really just leaves me speechless is the rush of Republicans and conservatives tripping over themselves to memorialize Reagan as the 'most popular president ever'.  Where did these people live?  I don't want Reagan on my money--paper or coin.  I don't want his mug on a stamp on my mail.  Now, Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist is attempting to rename the Pentagon after Reagan.  What's next the McRonnie Happy Meal?  I don't get it.  The man left a legacy of hate, churning with the fallout of Reaganomics, and a unbridled contempt for minorities and working-class citizens.  I say  hurry up  and put him the ground.  02.  After two episodes of the second season of  Bravo's   urlLink 'Queer Eye for the Straight Guy' , I still find myself amused.  Carson Kressley and Thom Filicia crack me up.  Granted much of their humor is sexual innuendo and double entendre.  However, there's no denying it's funny.  Where else can you find gay men gleefully playing with tampons on television?  03.  I also watched the premiere of  Bravo's  latest 'reality' entry  urlLink 'Blow Out' .  While there is just no denying that there is going to be D-R-A-M-A with that cast of characters, I have to wonder how much of Jonathan Antin I can stomach.  Beyond the fact that he is the deification of metrosexuality, his ego is preposterously inflated.  Does this man love himself or what?  Hey, I'm all for self-love.  But, he's ridiculous.  04.  So now that I bitched about metrosexuality, I must confess how truly gay I am.  I finally gave in and bought the Louis Vuitton man purse I've had my eye on.  Shallow?  Perhaps.  Stylish? Definitely.  05.  Frighteningly addictive:   urlLink Momints .  06.  Go see  urlLink 'Saved!'  as soon as you can.  It's wickedly funny.  Director Brian Dannelly delivers a home run in his first at bat.  06   If you're a fan of the films from the team of Merchant-Ivory, be sure to check out the new high-definition transfer of  urlLink 'Maurice'  on a special two-disc DVD edition.  It's beautifully put together and includes some great interviews and commentary.  The film is visually and emotionally stunning.

       BOYS LIKE US 1.09  " I met George by chance in the shy spring of 1975, during my senior year of high school. Had I not been preparing an article for the school news magazine, George and I would never have connected.  Our intimacy began innocently enough. My journalism instructor assigned me to interview the reverend of a local Episcopal church. Under his pastorship, volunteers from the congregation were providing daily meals for the poor and homeless. I phoned the church later that afternoon to schedule an appointment. George answered my call.  His thick baritone voice overwhelmed me. I stammered through my introduction, my purpose for ringing the line. As I explained myself, his breathing sounded as inviting as his supple, leathery voice. I had not felt desire like this even when I was messing around, a few years earlier, with a grocery clerk who was also named George, an older, white homosexual who lived and worked in my neighborhood in Washington, D.C. As this new, brown-like-me George breathed in and out of the telephone, there was nothing for me to clutch, nothing to grasp, no way to resist him. I didn't really want to resist.  When at last I finished my rambling, George politely said, 'The reverend isn't in at the moment.' I paused. I was becoming increasingly aroused by his soothing baritone. His mellifluous voice lingered long after he ceased speaking. The phone sweated in my hand as I regained the focus of the conversation, which was loping away from me every time he spoke.  I asked could I leave a message and George replied, 'Yes, you can.' The notes resonated, in my loins and in my imagination. I was called to answer those startling, enticing blue notes. I was called to receive them, to claim them, to own them proudly. I would later discover that this music between men can be sacred, worth fighting and dying for, but at that moment my mind and reasoning weren't in control--my hormones were. I was enchanted and curious. I allowed the liberal hand of pleasure to rule.  After giving George all the necessary information to pass on to the reverend, we lapsed into a momentary silence. Sensing the imminent good-bye, George lowered his saxophone voice a half octave and brashly asked, 'Why don't you come on up here and meet me?'  I feigned protest, but he pursued me anyway, neutralizing the little resistance I halfheartedly pretended. I wanted very much to meet the man possessing such a voice--a voice offering possibilities I had not yet dreamed of or considered. But I wasn't completely sure. I wasn't convinced of his motives--or of my own. "---Mr. Essex Hemphill

       FAHRENHEIT 9/11  Michael Moore's controversial documentary  urlLink "Fahrenheit 9/11"  will open on at least 1,000 theaters in the U.S. on June 25th.  The film, which takes President Bush and his Administration to task for their handling of the fight on terrorism and the Iraq War, was awarded the prestigious Palm D'Or at the 2004 Cannes Film Festival.  While the film was receiving a twenty minute standing ovation in France, Disney was busy trying to stop its Miramax subsidiary from distributing the film.  A complex distribution deal involving the Weinstein's newly formed Fellowship Adventure Group, Lion's Gate Films and IFC Films was finalized yesterday, pushing the film into theaters prior to Mr. Moore's anticipated July 4th debut.  Terms of the deal give the broadcast rights of the film to Showtime.  The Weinstein's purchased the rights to the film at an estimated cost of $6 million.  They have also committed to an intial $10 million dollar budget for print and advertising.  Moore hopes that his film will have an impact on the November 2004 elections.   BODY BY JAKE  Perhaps the most stunning magazine cover of the year (thus far).  When I pulled this out of my mailbox, I think I got a little weak in the knees.  I'm not sure if its the piercing blue eyes or the rain-soaked shirt, but Mr. Jake Gyllenhaal is simply flammable.  Bless you,  Entertainment Weekly .        TO BEE OR NOT TO BEE  The  urlLink 77th Scripps National Spelling Bee  began with a twenty word written test on Tuesday.  The first-round challenge, part of a three-day competition, included such words as 'panickiness',  urlLink 'triskaidekaphobia' ,  urlLink 'acesodyne' ,  urlLink 'rijsttafel'  and  urlLink 'epixylous' .  As a former bee competitor and professed geek, I always look forward to seeing the latest spell list.  A total of 265 spellers are competing for the bee's top prize of $12,000 in cash and an engraved cup.  ESPN will carry live coverage of the final rounds on Thursday.

       A TALE OF SIN  Sloth. Lust. Gluttony. Pride.  When you've committed four deadly sins in one weekend, I suppose it safe to say it was a resounding success.  It was a holiday weekend spent with family and friends.  In between fun and sun, a visit to my grandfather's grave grounded my soul.  I hope everyone had a safe and wonderful holiday weekend.   THE STRUGGLE IS OVER?  Signs of the impending showdown between Chairman Sumner Redstone and Viacom's President and COO Mel Karmazin had been the talk of Hollywood for weeks.  Over the weekend, the battle ended with a whimper and many questions.  Karmazin surrendered his resignation and gained approximately $25 million in salary, bonuses, and deferred compensation as his parting package under the terms of his current contract.    Viacom’s MTV Networks CEO Tom Freston and CBS Chairman and CEO Leslie Moonves, have been named co-Presidents and co-COOs. In their new roles, Freston and Moonves will jointly oversee all of the operations of Viacom, as directed by Chairman/CEO Sumner Redstone. Freston will be responsible for overseeing the operations of Showtime, BET, Paramount Parks, Simon & Schuster and the motion picture operations of Paramount Pictures. In addition to overseeing Viacom's broadcast television businesses, Moonves will be responsible for the operations OF Paramount Television, Infinity Broadcasting and Viacom Outdoor.  Many industry insiders contend that the power struggles inside Viacom are far from over.  Indeed, the dual president/coo dynamic seems to lend itself to an ultimate power struggle.  Also on tap, Howard Stern's threats to leave if Karmazin was forced to leave.  As Mr. Drudge is fond of saying...developing.   STALKING THE BOGEYMAN  David Holthouse created a stir when his article  urlLink 'Stalking the Bogeyman'  was featured as a cover story by the alternative weekly  Westword .  In the piece featuring the ominous byline "Coming to grips with the killer inside me", Holthouse recounted being the victim of rape at age seven and the resultant anger that lead him to want to kill the man responsible.  Holthouse's gripping piece took a stranger than fiction turn on Saturday, when he was  urlLink arrested  on charges of suspicion of felony stalking.    Who could write a stranger story?   FOCUS:  CHARLIZE THERON  Hot off her Oscar for "Monster", Charlize Theron has become one of Hollywood's busiest actors.  Recently in Cannes promoting the HBO film "The Life and Death of Peter Sellers" (she plays Swedish actress Britt Ekland), Theron already has a bevy of film in the can.  Scheduled to unspool first is her svelte assassin in "Aeon Flux" for "Girlfight" director Karyn Kusama and Paramount.  That will be followed by the sexual harassment drama "Class Action" for Niki Caro ("Whale Rider") and Warner Bros. She's also attached to star in and produce Universal's "Jinx," based on a graphic novel about a bounty hunter.  But her most interesting project of late may be teaming with "Boys Don't Cry" director Kimberly Peirce on an adaptation of Mark Richard's novel "The Ice at the Bottom of the World".  Richard's novel, a collection of 10 short stories primarily set in the American South, carries a running theme of love, loss, birth and death centering on a cross-section of redneck characters. Richard adopted his novel for the big screen.

       FRIDAY READS   01.&nbsp;  The New York Times :&nbsp; Todd S. Purdum:   urlLink 'Strong Show of "Strength"'   02.&nbsp;  USC Annenberg   Online Journalism Review :&nbsp; Mark Glaser:   urlLink 'Blogsploitation: Big Media Try to Steal Bloggers' Thunder at DNC'   03 .&nbsp; mediabistro. com:&nbsp; Peter Hyman:   urlLink 'Excerpt: 'Fact Checker's Delight,' from  The Reluctant Metrosexual '     BALE BEGINS      I recently had the immense pleasure of viewing a ten minute preview reel of director Christopher Nolan's 'Batman Begins'.&nbsp;&nbsp; If the preview is any indication, this will be the finest adaptation of the Batman saga.&nbsp; Scheduled to unspool in June of 2005, the film stars Christian Bale in the lead role.&nbsp; Bale, who has picked a variety of challenging roles, absolutely nails the ethos of Batman.&nbsp; Having undergone rigorous physical training, he cuts a striking figure in the new, less ornate Batman costume.&nbsp;(Interestingly, the first appearance of the bat suit is a translucent version that is later sprayed black.)&nbsp; Everything from mannerisms to speech patterns is pitch perfect.&nbsp; There is no doubt that Christian Bale   is   Batman.   The film's budget, which has been publicly stated at $150 million, will according to sources end up just under $200 million.&nbsp; A massive construction of the Bat Cave on a soundstage in Shepperton Studios (outside London) is an amazing feat of architecture.&nbsp; It includes a full lagoon, waterfall and what amounts to a subterranean bachelor pad.&nbsp; The Batmobile has been given a radical make-over with massive rack of humvee tires.&nbsp; Nolan is a stickler for ambiance and every frame of the preview shows a precise attention to detail.&nbsp; Using varying camera shots and moody cinematography, 'Batman Begins' creates a mood&nbsp;in the ten minutes that grabs around a viewer's neck from the get-go.&nbsp; Nolan poured over the sixty-year comic book history of Batman to develop the plot of his film.   A full city block of Gotham was constructed in an abandoned airplane hangar.&nbsp; The gritty, urban look Nolan embues upon it only adds to the authenticity of the Batman legacy.&nbsp; A stellar supporting cast includes Liam Neeson, Morgan Freeman, Cillian Murphy, Michael Caine, Katie Holmes, Gary Oldman, Ken Watanabe, Tom Wilkinson, Rutger Hauer and Linus Roache.&nbsp; With a screenplay by David S. Goyer, 'Batman Begins' looks like the event film of the Summer of 2005.

One of the most rewarding byproducts of blogging is finding yourself in a community of interesting and diverse people.&nbsp; You find writing and personalities that speak to you.&nbsp; Soon, you have a list of blogs that you&nbsp;read each day.&nbsp; Some bloggers become friends in real life and others make real connections over distances and countries.&nbsp; Invariably you get to know things about the people you read.&nbsp; Common interests, community and a few healthy crushes open your eyes to lives that are similar to your own&nbsp;and exquisitely different.   A perusal of my blog roll will show that many of my daily reads happen to be the writing of other gay men.&nbsp; I suppose that's to be expected as I share a communal bond with them.&nbsp; (I won't be as bold as to suggest that gay men are more interesting and&nbsp;candid writers....but, honestly.)&nbsp; To that end, two wonderful gay bloggers-- urlLink zeitzeuge  and  urlLink palochi --have recently started a  urlLink Gay Bloggers & Friends  tribe at  Tribe.net  .   It's taken off like wildfire and has been a rewarding introduction to some new blogs and bloggers.&nbsp;&nbsp;The result is that my&nbsp;daily reads list continues to grow.&nbsp; But in the end, I reap all of the rewards.&nbsp; (Why do&nbsp;I have this feeling that the last sentence is highly inappropriate?)   Check out the tribe.&nbsp; It's quite addictive.

       ANN COULTER: BITCH IN BOSTON   So some brilliant editor at  USA Today  gets the bright idea to send a right-wing conservative Republican&nbsp;to the Democratic National Convention in Boston to provide insightful dispatches.&nbsp; Yeah, like that's going to&nbsp;happen.   So Ms. Coulter packs her blue eyeshadow and hops her broom to Boston.&nbsp; She writes her first dispatch entitled 'Put The Speakers In A Cage' filled with her usual understated and demure political&nbsp;commentary and comedic prowess.&nbsp; When her copy arrives on said editor's desk, he suddenly wonders what the fuck&nbsp;he was&nbsp;thinking?   Ms. Coulter's piece is returned with a&nbsp;list of editorial comments questioning her writing, intent and stabs at humor.&nbsp; Well, that's simply unacceptable.&nbsp; I mean who do people think they're dealing with?&nbsp; She is Ms. Ann Coulter, respected author, beautiful person&nbsp;and political commentator.&nbsp; How dare those lowlifes at  USA Today  question her brilliant writing.&nbsp; What's a woman of the moderne age to do?&nbsp; Why let's call our good (and totally  not  gay) friend Matty--Matt Drudge, to the rest of us.   Faster than you can say "developing", Matty has blaring headlines about Ms. Coulter's column being "spiked" and how her column was "too hot to print".&nbsp; Add water, instant conservative media frenzy in a box.   Already having had the displeasure of seeing some of Ms. Coulter's diatribes on the cable news networks, I figured what could be so offensive?&nbsp; Then I read the opening paragraph of her submission and decided she is the most evil woman in America.&nbsp;   Ms. Coulter writes:  " Here at the Spawn of Satan convention in Boston, conservatives are deploying a series of covert signals to identify one another, much like gay men do. My allies are the ones wearing crosses or American flags. The people sporting shirts emblazoned with the "F-word" are my opponents. Also, as always, the pretty girls and cops are on my side, most of them barely able to conceal their eye-rolling ."   Let's break it down:   -- Here at the   Spawn of Satan convention :  Oh, Ann you crazy gal! You're so original.   -- Covert signals to identify one another, much like gay men do :  Dammit, Ann! You've busted us.&nbsp; Now, I'll have to tear down the giant floodlight on my roof that projects a secret&nbsp;image of my penis on the black night sky to announce to all the gay boys when I want to engage in some of that perverted, immoral&nbsp;sinnin' and debauchery&nbsp;that you God-fearin' folk look upon with such disdain. (Note to Ann: that would be&nbsp;sodomy, look it up.)&nbsp;   -- My allies are the ones wearing crosses&nbsp;or American flags:   Who knew Mel Gibson and Pat Robertson were in Boston?   -- The people sporting shirts emblazoned with the "F-word" are my opponents:   Ann, Dick Cheney is going to be so disappointed.&nbsp; Oh, and just in case it hasn't dawned on you yet, those shirts are meant to send a loud and clear message to people like you and your Bush (that's with a capital "b", Ann).   -- Also, as always, the pretty girls and cops are on my side:   All the girls want make-up tips Ann.&nbsp; All the cops want to sex you up.&nbsp; It's hard being so damned glamorous and beautiful.&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm sure Hillary Duff is on your speed dial.   Blah. Blah. Blah.&nbsp;Blech.   Ann, maybe it's not too late to audition for 'Last Comic Standing'?&nbsp; I hear reality television is all the rage these days.&nbsp; Like we all thought you'd hit Boston and write glowing reviews of a political party that is united.&nbsp; That you'd sing the praises of John Kerry and John Edwards.&nbsp; That you'd proclaim that gay men should be out and proud.&nbsp; That you secretly love sodomy.&nbsp; Whatever.   Ann, I hope you have a wonderful time in Boston.&nbsp; On the way home, I hope you take your broomstick--and in the famous words of a woman I truly admire-- SHOVE IT .  ------  Links:  -Ann Coulter's original commentary:&nbsp;  urlLink 'Put the Speakers in a Cage'   - USA Today's  editorial comments:&nbsp;  urlLink 'Banned in Boston'   -Matty on Ann:&nbsp;  urlLink Drudge Report     OPENING NIGHT AT THE DNC   As I watched the opening night coverage of the DNC, I was very pleased with what I saw and heard.&nbsp; Great speeches from Al Gore, President Carter and Senator Clinton set up the highlight speech of the night.&nbsp; Say what you will about President Clinton, but his ability to provide electricity and&nbsp;a poetic cadence&nbsp;to an oration is unmatched.&nbsp;   You can read a transcript of President Clinton's remarks  urlLink here .

       MONDAY MORNING NEWS   01.&nbsp;  The Washington Post :&nbsp; Alan Cooperman:   urlLink 'Gay Marriage as the New Abortion'   02.&nbsp;  The New York Times :&nbsp; Editorial Staff:   urlLink 'Complacency on AIDS Prevention'   03.&nbsp;  The New York Times :&nbsp; Saul Hansell:   urlLink 'RealNetworks Plans to Sell Songs to Be Played on iPods'     HOLLYWOOD NOTES   01.&nbsp;  Fine Line Features  &nbsp;has shelled out $5.5 million for the distribution rights&nbsp;to Alejandro Amenabar's 'Out To Sea' ('Mar Adentro').&nbsp; 'Out To Sea' stars Javier Bardem ('Before Night Falls')&nbsp;in the true story&nbsp;of Spaniard Ramon Sampedro, who endured a 30-year fight for the right to die.&nbsp;Sampedro fought to end his life rather than continue living&nbsp;with paralysis from the neck down.&nbsp;  Fine Line  (which is an arm of  New Line Cinema ) will have world-wide distribution in all English speaking countries.&nbsp; Amenabar last directed Nicole Kidman in 'The Others'.&nbsp; 'Out To Sea' will hit theaters&nbsp;later this year.&nbsp; Look for Bardem to be an early odds-on Oscar favorite.   02.&nbsp; Woody Allen's next film 'Melinda and Melinda' will have its world-premiere at the 52nd Annual San Sebastian International Film Festival in northern Spain.&nbsp; 'Melinda and Melinda' is described as a romantic comedy/drama and stars Will Ferrell.&nbsp; The festival runs September 17-25.&nbsp; The film is&nbsp;distributed by  Fox Searchlight  .   03.&nbsp; Actor/director Forest Whitaker's next project will be a remake of the 1956 Jayne Mansfield-Tom Ewell comedy 'The Girl Can't Help&nbsp;It'.&nbsp; The music driven film tells the story of a talent agent who is hired by a mobster to turn his musically-challenged girlfriend into a star.&nbsp; The original film featured performances by Fats Domino, Little Richard, The Platters and Julie London.&nbsp; Whitaker is said to&nbsp;be looking at starring and directing&nbsp;the remake.    TERROR STARTS AT HOME&nbsp; (*possible spoilers*) &nbsp;      I've run out of adjectives to describe how brilliant the writing, direction and acting on  HBO's  'Six Feet Under' truly is.&nbsp; It is without doubt the finest example of what episodic television can be.   Last week, there was a furor (see&nbsp;Episode 44: 'That's My Dog')&nbsp;that seemingly divided fans of the show.&nbsp; Internet fan sites and message boards were clogged with heated debate about whether the brutal attack on David was a stroke of brilliance or a sign of jumping the shark.&nbsp; I personally felt that as horrifying as the episode was to watch, it stayed true to the character of David and was brilliantly executed in an unedited and increasingly intense&nbsp;story arc.&nbsp; The last few minutes of that episode should guarantee that Michael C. Hall's shattering portrayal of David be nominated for an Emmy.   Which brings me to last night and the episode entitled 'Terror Starts at Home'.&nbsp; First, I think even critics of the last episode would have to agree that in the context of what unfolded in the aftermath of David's attack, this episode brought into sharp focus where the writer's were going with the jarring storytelling.&nbsp; Once again, the writers were brilliant in taking a look at the psyche of the Fisher clan and their interaction with one another.&nbsp; There were several revelatory glimpses into what is to come for several of the Fishers and their circle of friends and lovers.&nbsp; But, the biggest impact the episode had for me was&nbsp;in reinforcing the&nbsp;great admiration and love&nbsp;I have for Lauren Ambrose.   Last night,&nbsp;Claire Fisher grew up in leaps and bounds.&nbsp; In the process, Ms. Ambrose showed why she too deserves an Emmy nomination.&nbsp; The expressions on Claire's face as David relayed the true story behind his&nbsp;'robbery' were at once heart-wrenching and endearing.&nbsp; Ms. Ambrose is simply one of the finest (and most underrated) actresses of&nbsp;her generation.&nbsp; She made me fall in love with Claire Fisher--and in the process I fell in love with her.

       WE HOLD THESE TRUTHS TO BE SELF-EVIDENT   In today's  The New York Times  there is a thoughtful&nbsp;and succinct editorial entitled  urlLink 'A Radical Assault on the Constitution' .&nbsp; It&nbsp;takes on the disgraceful vote in the U.S. House of Representatives this past week which attempts to prevent federal courts from intervening on any constitutional questions&nbsp;as they pertain&nbsp;to the issue of gay marriage.   As I have said before,&nbsp; the issue of gay marriage&nbsp;is at its heart an issue about basic civil rights.&nbsp; Not every gay couple wants to be married.&nbsp; However, those that do should have every right to do so.&nbsp; Furthermore, the meaning and essence of any union--whether it is called a marriage or not--is filled with nuances unique to those two individuals.&nbsp;&nbsp; What should not be&nbsp;unique or different is the way our government treats that union based solely on the sexual orientation of the individuals involved.&nbsp;   The recognition of gay marriage&nbsp;is not an assault on a religious&nbsp;institution called marriage.&nbsp;&nbsp;The recognition of gay marriage&nbsp;is not an attack on the moral fiber of a country.&nbsp;&nbsp;The recognition of gay&nbsp;marriage&nbsp;will not lead to&nbsp;the destruction of the American nuclear family.&nbsp; The recognition of gay marriage is, simply put, the acknowledgement of&nbsp;love and a recognized commitment.&nbsp; Said acknowledgement by&nbsp;our&nbsp;government&nbsp;ensures certain legal benefits and protected entitlements.&nbsp;   In the end, the struggle for legal recognition of gay marriage--and the benefits and status that&nbsp;are afforded to heterosexual marriage--is a fight for a belief that the words "that all men are created equal" is more than a platitude.

       COLIN FARRELL: FULL FRONTAL INTERVIEW   In issue #775 of  Entertainment Weekly  (07.23.04), Colin Farrell gives Dave Karger an interview entitled 'The Naked Truth'.&nbsp; The following are excerpts from that interview:  &nbsp;  Karger: I wonder why you wanted to do this movie in the first place.&nbsp; Your character, the ultra-naive Bobby, is so different for you.  Farrell:  My agent passed me the script, and I read it in Dublin on me couch.&nbsp; I think I called him at four or five in the morning and left him a message on his voice-mail.&nbsp; I hadn't read anything like it.&nbsp; It was just very gentle.&nbsp; It was about people whose lives are changing and molding and about loss.&nbsp; I had never read anything so fuckin' intense on the idea of love, yet didn't hit it with a hammer.     &nbsp;  Karger: Besides the wig, what was the biggest challenge in playing the part?  Farrell:  When so much importance is placed on a particular energy that you've become known for, whether it's brooding or swagger or being butch, it's very easy for the human mind to find comfort in being recognized as one thing, which can become a form of self-imprisonment as an actor.&nbsp; So I suppose [the challenge was] for me to break out of that and be as open and weak and simple as Bobby was.   &nbsp;  Karger:&nbsp;I&nbsp;can't open a paper these days without reading something about your nude scene.&nbsp; Are you surprised by all the attention it's gotten?  Farrell : Yeah, man, I mean, fuck me!&nbsp; Who gives a fuck! Apart from the readers  of The Advocate  &nbsp;maybe, who wants to see Colin Farrell's cock that much?&nbsp; And let me tell you, it ain't nothing to fuckin' write home about.&nbsp; Someone told me that someone said it was fine but it was no Ewan McGregor!   &nbsp;  Karger: I saw the early version with the scene, and it wasn't that big a deal, pardon the pun.  Farrell : [Laughs] No, it's nothing, man! I walk to a door and you see my cock, and I walk out of the shot.&nbsp; It's dark, and it's three inches, uh, seconds long.     &nbsp;  Karger: So it wasn't the studio that made the decision to cut the shot?&nbsp; It was you? Or Michael Mayer?  Farrell : Both of us together. And [producer] Tom [Hulce].&nbsp; Everyone seemed to be on the same page.     &nbsp;  Karger: But now what's been added back in the film is...  Farrell : My asshole.&nbsp; That's in the next picture.     &nbsp;  Karger: No, the rooftop kiss between you and Dallas.  Farrell : The kiss is back in?&nbsp; Good, yeah.&nbsp; It's a very important part of the story.&nbsp; It's very quick and very gentle.&nbsp; It's not exactly '9 1/2 Weeks'.     &nbsp;  Karger: So would you be okay if they put the nude shot back on the DVD?  Farrell : That'd be totally gratuitous.&nbsp; It's not like a director's cut.&nbsp; That would now creep me out.&nbsp; I would prefer it to be in the original than have it put on the DVD.&nbsp; 'Cause to have it put on the DVD, that's to sell&nbsp;[nudity].&nbsp; And that's when I'd come in with me fuckin' hands up, to be honest with you.&nbsp; Would they have it on "Special Features: Deleted Cock"?

'Superman' franchise once again has a director.&nbsp; After a much publicized falling out over budget and location concerns McG ('Charlie's Angels') stepped away from the project.&nbsp; This came after such notables as Tim Burton and Brett Rattner failed to sign on.&nbsp; The freshly signed director is none other than Bryan Singer ('X-Men').&nbsp; While there is no start date associated with the film, there is already a working script by 'Alias' creator J.J. Abrams.&nbsp; Whether any of that script will be used remains to be seen as Singer is very hands on in the writing of his projects.&nbsp; The new assignment does however put the future of two Singer projects in flux.&nbsp; 'X-Men 3' has already been given a release date of May 5, 2006.&nbsp; Singer is also slated to helm the much talked about remake of 'Logan's Run'.&nbsp; It does appear that&nbsp;the&nbsp;'Superman' project could take precedence.&nbsp; According to Singer,  "My interest in Superman dates back many, many years.&nbsp; In fact, it was the Richard Donner classic film that was my day-to-day inspiration in shaping the 'X-Men' universe for the screen. I feel that Superman has been late in his return and it is time for him to fly again . "   &nbsp;  02.&nbsp; Russell Crowe will next be seen on the big screen in March 2005 in 'Cinderella Man'.&nbsp; Meanwhile, sources report that he is close to signing on to his next project which would see him return to his homeland.&nbsp; The project would be  Fox Searchlight's &nbsp;&nbsp;big-screen adaptation of Australian author Murray Bail's novel 'Eucalyptus'.&nbsp; The film would reunite Crowe with director Jocelyn Moorhouse, for whom he starred in 1991's 'Proof'.&nbsp;&nbsp; Bail's&nbsp;book&nbsp;was&nbsp;the winner of the 1999 Commonwealth Writers Prize.&nbsp; The fairy tale-like story tells of a man, his daughter and the stranger (Crowe) who whisks her off her feet. The father plants hundreds of varieties of eucalyptus trees and then decrees that only a man who can name every one of them may have his daughter's hand in marriage.  &nbsp;  03.&nbsp;&nbsp; HBO's  Emmy favorite, 'Angels In America' made a big splash on Saturday at the 20th Annual Televison Critics Association Awards.&nbsp; Up for 21 Emmys, 'Angels' was named&nbsp;Best Movie or Mini-Series, as well as Program of the Year by the 256 members of the TCA.&nbsp;&nbsp; FOX's  'Arrested Development' was named Best New Program and Best Comedy.&nbsp; The Best Drama nod went to  HBO's  'The Sopranos'.&nbsp;  BBC America's  Ricky Gervais was cited for Individual Achievement Comedy for 'The Office'.  &nbsp;  04.&nbsp; 'Mission: Impossible 3' has been moved back to a June 29, 2005 opening as director Joe Carnahan ('Narc') has dropped out due to&nbsp;"creative differences'.&nbsp; The Tom Cruise picture has already been fully cast with Scarlett Johansson, Carrie-Anne Moss, Kenneth Branagh and Ving Rhames.&nbsp; Previous directors have included Brian De Palma and John Woo.  &nbsp;  05.&nbsp; 'CSI: Crime Scene Investigation' was set to begin shooting the upcoming season last&nbsp;Thursday.&nbsp; However, on-set reports are that only one principal cast member--Gary Dourdan--showed up.&nbsp; A salary&nbsp;dispute&nbsp;led  CBS&nbsp; to terminate the contracts of key cast members Jorja Fox and George Eads.&nbsp; Apparently series star William Petersen and Marg Helgenberger did not show up on-set as a protest of the firings.&nbsp; Now that's some drama.  &nbsp;   RANDOM NOTES FROM A WEEKEND   01.&nbsp; Summer is sizzling in the Southwest.  02.&nbsp; 'Six Feet Under' was utterly disturbing--and as always, brilliantly written.  03.&nbsp; I have a crush on a decidedly straight man.  04.&nbsp; The first season of  Comedy Central's  'Reno 911!' is out on DVD.&nbsp; Buy it now.  05.&nbsp; Weekend album pick: Brandy's 'Afrodisiac'  06.&nbsp; I've suddenly been inspired to work on sketches of dress designs.  07.&nbsp; Jessica Simpson should be punished for her screeching cover of Robbie William's sublime 'Angels'.

       FRIDAY MUST-READS   01.&nbsp;  The New York Times:  Celia W. Dugger:   urlLink 'Devastated by AIDS, Africa Sees Life Expectancy Plunge'   02.&nbsp;  The New York Times:  Bob Herbert:   urlLink 'Bush's Not-So-Big Tent'   03.&nbsp;  Rolling Stone:  Eric Bates:   urlLink 'Doonesbury Goes To War'   &nbsp;   DEBUNKING STEREOTYPES--PART&nbsp;IV    MYTH #4: GAYS AND LESBIANS HAVE IMPOVERISHED SOCIAL SUPPORT NETWORKS.    &nbsp;   Although there is growing public awareness of the existence of gay and lesbian communities, stereotypes continue to depict homosexuals as socially isolated and lacking in social support. It is certainly true that in a homophobic society, gays and lesbians may suffer from social alienation and estrangement. The psychological stress that results from social recognition and stigma should nonetheless not be minimized. What is noteworthy, however, is the extent to which contemporary lesbians and gay men seem able to overcome these obstacles and to create satisfying social networks. This is especially important because of growing evidence that emotional support, guidance, assistance, and other forms of social support contribute to mental and physical health.   Illustrative of the research on social support is a comparative study of lesbian and heterosexual women conducted by Aura (1985). She compared the social support experiences of 50 lesbians and 50 heterosexual women. All women were currently in a primary relationship and were matched for age, education, length of their relationship. None had children in their household. Women filled out detailed questionnaires about many specific types of social support. Results showed that both groups of women held very similar values about the importance of social support. In addition, women reported receiving similar total amounts of support from their personal relationships. However, lesbians and heterosexuals often received support from different sources. In particular, many lesbians depended somewhat less on relatives and more on their partner or friends than did heterosexuals. For example, lesbians and heterosexuals reported receiving similar amounts of material assistance such as help in moving or getting a ride to the airport, but lesbians relied more on friends and heterosexuals relied more on their family.  &nbsp;  Research by Lewin investigated the social support experiences of lesbian and heterosexual divorced mothers raising children (Lewin, 1981; Lewin &amp; Lyons, 1982). Lewin found that both lesbian and heterosexual mothers were equally likely to turn to their parents or other family members for support. About 84% of the lesbian mothers said that most or all of their relatives were aware of their homosexuality. Although this initially created stress for many lesbians and their families, over time the families seemed to come to terms with the situation. Overall, results seemed to suggest that the presence of children may increase the similarity in social support experiences of lesbian and heterosexual women.   Kurdek (1998) studied the social support among gay men and lesbians in couples. When asked who provided social support, virtually everyone listed not only their partner but also other friends. In addition, 81% of the gay men and 86% of the lesbians cited a family member as a source of support--most often their mother or a sister. Using the standardized Social Support Questionnaire developed by Sarason and his associates (1983), Kurdek found no differences between gay men and lesbians in the source of support or in satisfaction with support. Overall levels of support received by gays and lesbians were similar to and slightly higher than those reported by Sarason for a college student sample. (See also D'Augelli, 1987; D'Augelli &amp; Hart, 1987; Kurdek &amp; Schmidt, 1987).  &nbsp;  In summary, despite the potential obstacles to the establishment of meaningful social relations, many lesbians and gay men are able to create supportive social networks.

DEBUNKING STEREOTYPES--PART III    MYTH #3: "HUSBAND" AND "WIFE" ROLES ARE UNIVERSAL IN INTIMATE RELATIONSHIPS.    C.A. Tripp notes that "when people who are not familiar with homosexual relationships try to picture one, the almost invariably resort to a heterosexual frame of reference, raising questions about which partner is 'the man' and which is the 'woman' (1975). This issue has generated a good deal of empirical research (see reviews by Harry, 1993; Peplau &amp; Gordon, 1983; Risman &amp; Schwartz, 1988).   Historical accounts of gay life in the United States suggest that masculine-feminine roles have sometimes been important. More recently, there has been a sharp decline in the occurrence of gender-linked roles in gay and lesbian relationships. Some have attributed this change to the effects of the feminist and gay rights movements and to the general loosening of traditional gender norms in American society (Marecek, Finn, &amp; Cardell, 1982; Risman &amp; Schwartz, 1988; Ross, 1983).   Today however, research shows that most lesbians and gay men actively reject traditional husband-wife or masculine-feminine roles as a model for enduring relationships (see Blumstein &amp; Schwartz, 1983; Harry, 1984; Lynch &amp; Reilly, 1986; Marecek, Finn, &amp; Cardell, 1982; McWhirter &amp; Mattison, 1994; Peplau &amp; Amaro, 1982.) Currently, most lesbians and gay men are in "dual-worker" relationships, so that neither partner is the exclusive "breadwinner" and each partner has some measure of economic independence. Further, examination of the division of household tasks, sexual behavior, and decision making in homosexual couples finds that clear-cut and consistent husband-wife roles are uncommon. In many relationships, there is some specialization of activities with one partner doing more of some jobs and less of others. But it is rare for one to perform most of the "feminine" activities and the other to perform most of the "masculine" tasks. That is, the partner who usually does the cooking does not necessarily also perform other feminine tasks such as shopping or cleaning. Specialization seems to be based on more individualistic factors such as skills or interests.   Nonetheless, a small minority of lesbians and gay men do incorporate elements of husband-wife roles into their relationships. This may affect the division of labor, the dominance structure, sexual interactions, the way partners dress, and other aspects of their relationship. In some cases, these role patterns seemed to be linked to temporary situations, such as one partner's unemployment or illness. For other couples, however, masculine-feminine roles may provide a model of choice.   Given that traditional husband-wife roles are not the template for most contemporary homosexual couples, researchers have sought to identify other models or relationship patterns. One model might be based on differences in age, with an older partner acting in part as a mentor or leader. In his studies of gay male relationships, Harry (1982, 1984) found that the age-difference pattern characterized only a minority of gay couples. When it did occur, the actual differences in age tended to be relatively small, perhaps five to ten years. Harry also found that in these couples, the older partner often had more power in decision making. McWhirter and Mattison (1984) also observed age differences among some male couples they studied, and reported that age differences of five years or more were characteristic of couples who had been together for thirty years or more.   Finally, another pattern is based on friendship or peer relations, with partners being similar in age and emphasizing companionship, sharing, and equality in the relationship (e.g., Harry, 1982,1983c.; Peplau,et.al., 1978; Peplau &amp; Cochran, 1981). A friendship script typically fosters equality in relationships. In contrast to marriage, the norms for friendship assume that partners are relatively equal in status and power. Friends also tend to be similar in interests, resources, and skills. Available evidence suggests that most American lesbians and gay men have a relationship script that most closely approximates best friendship. In summary, contemporary homosexual relationships follow a variety of patterns or models.

Maria Bello ('The Cooler') and Viggo Mortensen will star in director David Cronenberg's next project entitled 'A History of Violence'.  The film will tell the story of an ordinary family's life after the father (Mortensen) receives unwanted national attention for a seemingly vigilante-style self-defense killing at his diner. Bello will play Mortensen's wife. The film is based on John Wagner and Vince Locke's graphic novel entitled 'Violence'.  The project is being developed at  New Line Cinema .  02.  Reese Witherspoon is currently in final negotiations to lend her voice to an animated Disney project.  'Rapunzel: Unbraided' will headline Broadway star Kristin Chenoweth in the role of Rapunzel.  The script calls for a modern boy and girl to be thrust into Rapunzel's world.  Witherspoon would voice the female role.  Chenoweth is scheduled to wrap up her run in the Broadway musical 'Wicked' this weekend. She recently wrapped a role in  MGM's  'The Pink Panther' and will be seen in  Columbia Pictures'  'Bewitched' opposite Nicole Kidman.   03.  Tommy Lee Jones will make his feature directing debut with the indie 'The Three Burials of Melquiades Estrada'.  Production is slated for a mid-September start in Texas with the script penned by Guillermo Arriaga ('21 Grams', 'Amores Perros').  Jones would play a ranch hand named Pete Perkins, who attempts to keep a promise to a recently deceased friend's wish to be buried in his hometown in Mexico.  04.  While Charlize Theron and Frances McDormand are currently filming 'Aeon Flux', it appears the Oscar-winning duo will reteam in their next project.  McDormand is in final negotiations to join Theron in  Warner Bros.  drama 'Class Action'.  The film is a fictionalized account of the first successful sexual harassment prosecution in the United States,  Jensen v. Eveleth Mines .  05.  The Toronto International Film Festival (which runs September 9-18th) will world premiere two highly anticipated films.  'Red Dust', starring Oscar-winner Hillary Swank, is a suspense drama surrounding South Africa's Truth and Reconciliation Commission.  The film will co-star Chiwetel Ejiofor ('Dirty Pretty Things').  Also unspooling will be a biopic of the legendary Ray Charles starring Jamie Foxx.  The film, 'Ray', is directed by Taylor Hackford.   DEBUNKING STEREOTYPES--PART II   MYTH #2: GAY RELATIONSHIPS ARE UNHAPPY, ABNORMAL, AND DYSFUNCTIONAL.   It is often believed that gay and lesbian relationships are inferior to those of heterosexuals. For example, a study of heterosexual college students found that they expected gay and lesbian relationships to be less satisfying, more prone to discord, and "less in love" than heterosexual relationships (Testa, Kinder, & Ironson, 1987). To investigate this stereotype scientifically, researchers have assessed the psychological adjustment of homosexual dyads, and have often used a research strategy comparing the relationship functioning of matched samples of homosexual and heterosexual couples. The central question has been how well gay and lesbian relationships fare on standard measures of relationship satisfaction, dyadic adjustment, or love.  Illustrative of this research is a study conducted by Susan Cochran & Letitia Anne Peplau (1990) that selected matched samples of 50 lesbians, 50 gay men, 50 heterosexual men, and 50 heterosexual women--all currently involved in "romantic/sexual relationships". Participants were matched on age, education, ethnicity, and length of relationship, and all completed a detailed questionnaire about their current relationship.  Among this sample of young adults, about 60% said they were "in love" with their partners; most of the rest indicated they were "uncertain". On Rubin's standardized Love and Liking Scales, lesbians and gay men generally reported very positive feelings for their partners. Lesbians and gay men also rated their current relationships as highly satisfying and very close. No significant differences were found among lesbians, gay men, and heterosexuals on any of these measures of relationship satisfaction. All participants were also asked to describe in their own words the "best things" and the "worst things" about their relationships. Systematic content analyses found no significant differences in the responses of any group of respondees--all of whom reported a similar range of joys and problems. To search for more subtle differences among groups that may not have been captured by the coding scheme, the "best things" and "worst things" were typed on cards in standard form, with information about gender and sexual orientation removed. Panels of judges were asked to sort out the cards, separating men from women, or separating heterosexuals and homosexuals. The judges were not able to identify correctly the responses of lesbians, gay men, or heterosexual women and men. Indeed, judges may have been misled by their own preconceptions; they tended for instance, to assume incorrectly that statements involving jealousy were more likely to be made by homosexuals than heterosexuals.  Other studies have portrayed similar findings, and have extended the range of relationship measures used. In general, most gay men and lesbians perceive their relationships as satisfying. Homosexual and heterosexual couples who are matched on age and other relevant background characteristics do not usually differ in levels of love and satisfaction, nor in their scores in standardized measures such as the Locke-Wallace Scale or Spanier's Dyadic Adjustment Scale. (See Cardell, Finn, & Marecek, 1981; Dailey, 1979; Duffy & Rusbult, 1986; Kurdek & Schmitt, 1987; Peplau, Cochran, & Mays, 1986; Peplau, Padesky, & Hamilton, 1982.)  None of this is to say that all gay and lesbian couples are happy and problem-free. Rather the point is that homosexual couples are not necessarily any more prone to relationship dissatisfaction and difficulties than are heterosexuals.

       DEBUNKING STEREOTYPES   MYTH #1: HOMOSEXUALS DON'T WANT ENDURING RELATIONSHIPS AND CAN'T ACHIEVE THEM ANYWAY.   Homosexuals are often depicted as unhappy individuals who are unsuccessful in developing enduring same-sex ties. Drifting from one sexual liaison to another, they end up old and alone. Existing data sharply counter this stereotype.  Studies of homosexuals' attitudes about relationships find that most lesbians and gay men say they very much want to have enduring close relationships (e.g., Bell & Weinberg, 1978). Other studies have investigated the extent to which lesbians and gay men are successful in establishing intimate relationships. In surveys of gay men, between 40% and 60% of the men questioned were currently involved in a steady relationship (e.g., Bell & Weinberg, 1978; Harry, 1993; Jay & Young, 1997; Peplau & Cochran, 1981; Spada, 1979). In studies of lesbians, between 45% and 80% of women surveyed were currently in a steady relationship. These estimates are not completely representative of all gay men and lesbians in the United States. They do indicate, however, that a large proportion of homosexuals have stable close relationships. Research also suggests that a slightly higher proportion of lesbians than gay men may be in steady relationships.  Given that substantial proportions are involved in intimate relationships, a next question concerns the longevity of these partnerships. Lacking marriage records and representative samples, it is hard to make judgments about how long "typical" homosexual relationships last. Most studies that have been conducted focused on younger adults whose relationships have lasted for a few years--as would be true for heterosexuals in their twenties. The few studies that have included older gay men and lesbians have found that relationships lasting twenty years or longer are not uncommon (e.g., McWhirter & Mattison, 1984; Raphael & Robinson, 1980; Silverstein, 1990).  The basic point of all these studies to draw from is that gay and lesbian relationships are very much a reality in contemporary life.

       THE FLORIDA PLAN: THE SEQUEL  The Department Of Homeland Security has a novel idea to screw up another national election.  No need for the vote-counting meltdown of Florida that gave Bush the job in the first place.  Instead, because of the threat of those ever-looming terrorists, America can just  urlLink postpone  the election.  This is the most idiotic idea I've heard the Bush Administration come up with in quite a while (and trust, that is quite a feat).  First, what better way to wave a white flag to any terrorists who would want to disrupt the democratic process.  We're afraid of you and you've disrupted our political system and it's only July.  Give me a break.  It's quite amazing how Secretary Ridge has a way of announcing "terror", yet never has any specific information on time, date or place.  If I was a cynic (*cough*), I might even believe the U.S. would bomb itself to prevent an election if they thought there was a chance Bush might lose.    Forget about remaking 'The Manchurian Candidate', we've got front row seats.   MONDAY MORNING NEWS  01.   The Washington Post : R.

Of course, the news about Mr. Farrell has been internet fodder for days.  If the studio wanted to make 'A Home At The End Of The World' a bonafide box-office smash, they'd put back the infamous scene now that it's been discussed around the world.    What I found more interesting in Ms. Chonin's article is the case made that there is an obvious double-standard when it comes to on-screen nudity in U.S. films.  Obviously, in a male-dominated film industry, there is little question about showing nudity and sex as long as the woman is clearly the focus of the footage.  While male buttocks have finally become bromide, the thought of a penis is just too horrifying to the MPAA and a lot of heterosexual males.  But, I'm sure there is a large female and gay male population that would beg to differ.  If a heterosexual male is so insecure with his masculinity that the thought of seeing a thirty foot penis on the screen will require psychotherapy, might I suggest they leave the theatre.

       FRIDAY ROUND-UP  01.  The 30th annual Humanitas Prize luncheon was held yesterday in Los Angeles.  The Humanitas Prize recognizes television and motion picture writers for work that honestly explores the complexities of the human experience and sheds light on the positive values of life.  In the feature film category the prize was awarded to Steven Knight for his script of 'Dirty Pretty Things', which tells the story of two immigrants in London who discover an illegal body parts-for-passports trade in the hotel they work in.  In the television film category, the winner was Tony Kushner for the screenplay of his Pulitzer Prize-winning play 'Angels In America' for  HBO . Other honorees included: Jacob Aaron Estes ('Mean Creek') and Barbara Hall ('Joan Of Arcadia').  02.  Drew Barrymore and Jimmy Fallon have signed to star in the film adaptation of Nick Hornby's 'Fever Pitch'.  Hornby's best-seller dealt with the author's obsession with soccer.  The script by Lowell Ganz and Babaloo Mandel has been 'americanized' and soccer has been replaced by baseball--specifically the Boston Red Sox.  The film is set at  Fox 2000  and the Farrelly brothers are in negotiations to direct prior to starting their 'The Three Stooges' project.  03.  Michael Moore's 'Fahrenheit 9/11' expands to 286 more theaters today.  The film will now be showing in 2,011 theaters nationwide.  The latest controversy to besiege the film is the refusal of at least two theater chains to screen the film.  Illinois-based GKC Theaters and Iowa-based Fridley Theaters have both cited "objectionable content" and "propaganda" in their reasoning.  GKC further says it will not screen the film due to the fact "our country is at war".    04.  On Thursday, the annual News & Documentary Emmy Award nominations were announced.   PBS  led the field with 24 nominations, including four of the five in the documentary category.   ABC  News pulled in 21 nominations, with a particularly strong showing for 'Primetime Thursday' (six nominations). 'World News Tonight with Peter Jennings' nabbed five nominations--more than any other evening newscast.  Other nominations:  CBS  News received 19;  Cinemax , 12;  NBC  News, 11 and the  History Channel , 11.   05.  Clint Eastwood has signed to direct  DreamWorks  adaptation of James Bradley and Ron Power's non-fiction book 'Flags of Our Fathers: Heroes of Iwo Jima'. The look at the turning-point battle of WWII will be scripted by Paul Haggis.  06.  Atom Egoyan begins filming 'Where The Truth Lies' on August 30th in Toronto.  The film noir is based on the novel of the same title by Rupert Holmes.  Kevin Bacon and Alison Lohman have signed to star.   BIG BROTHER IS WATCHING  The fifth season of  CBS's  'Big Brother' series is well underway with a bevy of twists and surprises.  Amongst the lost siblings and sets of identical twins, the internet is rife with chatter (and pictures) of one of the male housemate's spread in  Playgirl .  While the pictures are apparently underwhelming, there is more to this story than meets the eye.  It seems our little nudist has posed for a few other magazines that cater to a specific male audience.  One has to wonder if the show's self-professed gay boy Will might not have an extra-special roommate?   SAVE THE DATE      'Trading Spaces' charming and talented Douglas Wilson will celebrate his 40th birthday with a combined birthday/book launch party on November 4th.  The book, entitled 'Doug's Rooms', will showcase a portfolio of work done for the  TLC  home improvement show.  The party will be held in New York City.  While the location is TBA, Crobar in Chelsea is the front-runner.      IN OUR LIFETIME   The New York Times : Carl Hulse & David D. Kirkpatrick:   urlLink 'Senate Braces Itself for Fight on Gay Marriage'    TIME FLIES...  I just realized that this weblog celebrated its one year birthday on July 5th.  It's hard to believe that I've been doing this for a year.  When I started, I feared I didn't have enough to say to sustain a blog.  I guess I have debunked that myth. My second fear was that I couldn't possibly be interesting enough to sustain a readership beyond myself.  Thankfully, you've debunked that myth.   It's been an interesting journey to say the very least.   Obliquity  has slowly morphed to have a media-oriented, pop culture focus.  Yet, I'd like to think that enough of my own personality, politics, and passion have seeped into the words along the way.  I've actually learned things about myself from this endeavor.  I've shared things embarrassing and silly. I've ranted and raved.  I've tried to put GLBTQ issues forward for readers who are not necessarily gay.  Some entries stumble.  Others seemed to generate interest and served a purpose beyond my own ego.  Perhaps the greatest reward has been the opportunity to cross paths with so many talented, witty, and charming fellow bloggers.  There is definitely a sense of community to be found in this crazy place we call cyberspace.  I thank those of you who take time out of your day to check in.  Here's to another year...

Series creator Paul Maslansky is getting ready to dust-off the 'Police Academy' franchise.  Being developed by  Warner Bros. Pictures  and  Village Roadshow , the untitled film will be the seventh sequel to the original film.  Plans call for a blend of returning and new characters.  The most recent sequel in the franchise was "Police Academy 7: Mission to Moscow" in 1994.  02.  Well-respected Broadway director Michael Mayer ('Thoroughly Modern Millie') makes his big screen directorial debut with an adaptation of Michael Cunningham's 'A Home At The End Of The World' later this month for  Warner Independent Pictures .  Meanwhile, Mayer has signed on to his follow-up project.  He'll direct 'Under My Skin' starring Annette Bening for  United Artists .  'Under My Skin' was originally written for the stage by Catherine Butterfield, but was adapted by the author for Mayer.  The 1960's period piece features Bening as an uninhibited divorcee who strikes up a friendship with a conservative young girl who is her next door neighbor.     03.   20th Century Fox  continues to add to the cast of their upcoming adaptation of the Marvel comic book series 'Fantastic Four'.  The potential franchise picture will be directed by Tim Story ('Barbershop') and star Michael Chiklis.  'Fantastic Four' follows the adventure-seeking quartet of scientist Reed Richards/Mr. Fantastic; his love interest, Susan Storm/the Invisible Girl; her brother, Johnny/the Human Torch; and Reed's best friend, Benjamin Grimm/the Thing. The four develop superpowers when the spaceship they're on is exposed to cosmic radiation. Chiklis' casting as Grimm had been previously announced.  New additions to the cast include Chris Evans ('The Perfect Score') as Johnny and Ioan Gruffudd ('King Arthur') as Reed Richards.  The role of Susan Storm is still to be cast, but frontrunners for the part are Jessica Alba ('Honey') and Rachel McAdams ('The Notebook').  04.  Mena Suvari, who is in the midst of an eight episode arc on  HBO's  'Six Feet Under' has been a busy woman.  Already in the can are the indie thriller 'Trauma' co-starring Colin Firth and  MGM's  'Beauty Shop' with Queen Latifah--both of which are set for 2004 release.  Suvari has also just signed on to an untitled project co-starring Jennifer Aniston for  Warner Bros. .  Written by and to be directed by Ted Griffin, the film revolves around Aniston's character who discovers that her family's darkest secret was the inspiration for the book and movie 'The Graduate'. Suvari will star as Annie, the younger sister of Aniston's character, whose wedding brings all the characters together in the film.  05.   Sony  and  Imax  have announced that 'Spider-Man 2' will bow on Imax screens worldwide July 23rd, three weeks after the film was released to a $180 million six-day opening gross.

       POP CULTURE CRANKY PANTS  01.  America, just say  NO  to Ashlee Simpson.  She does for self-importance what Jessica did for special education.  You can dye your hair honey, but your roots--and lack of talent--will always show through.  02.  Speaking of the Simpson Spawn, there should be an emergency moratorium put out on sibling celebrity pairs.  Those Duff bitches ruined a classic Go-Go's song.

In the immortal words of Susan Powter (who?), "Stop the Madness!"  03.

       BENEATH THESE FIREWORKS  01.  I hope everyone had a fun and safe Fourth of July holiday.  I stayed close to home and watched half a season of the  F/X's  delicious  urlLink 'Nip/Tuck' .  I never caught the program in its debut season--and now I see that was a mistake.  It's a wonderfully acted, wickedly written drama.  My fireworks were limited to watching the NYC/Macy's display on television. Oh, the glamour of being me.  02.  Monday brought bad news.  My maternal grandmother suffered an apparent stroke.  I lost my grandfather to cancer about five year ago.  My grandmother is the only surviving grandparent I have.  While she has not always been the easiest person in the world to get along with, I do love her with all my heart and we are close.  After being assessed at a local hospital, she was airlifted to a larger trauma center.  Until further tests are completed, it's hard to say what kind of long-term damage she has sustained and what her prognosis will be.  So I'm sending positive thoughts and much love to my grandma.  03.  If you haven't dropped by  urlLink Towleroad  of late, you really should make it a point to do so.  While Andy's getting some well-deserved R&R, he's enlisted a guest blogger in the form of Mr. Christopher Rice.  Aside from new perspectives and rodent tales, you can get the scoop on Mr. Rice's upcoming book 'Light Before Day'.  04.  Continuing to garner respect as a personal hero of mine, Duke University's Mike Krzyzewski has  urlLink turned down  a lucrative $40 million dollar contract to become the new L.A. Lakers head coach.  Of his twenty-four year tenure at Duke, Krzyzewski says, " The allure of coaching in college has no price.  I've never made a decision based on what was going to make me the most money. It was what was going to give me the most happiness and I've been really happy and fulfilled at Duke. "  05.  If  CNN  is to be  urlLink believed , today will be the day that Senator John Kerry finally names his choice for vice-president on the Democratic ticket.  Despite Matt Drudge's nearly hysterical headlines that Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton was a done deal, most pundits put the contest down to three choices: Senator John Edwards (North Carolina), Representative Richard Gephardt (Missouri) and Governor Tom Vilsack (Iowa).  Of those three, I think the most progressive candidate would be Senator John Edwards.  For the record, if Matt Drudge was somehow correct in his Clinton prognostication, I for one would be a very happy voter.

Jake Gyllenhaal is a leading contender to take up the cape of Superman as the franchise is rethought a la 'Batman'.  Sources say that members of Gyllenhaal's management team are concerned that any on-screen sex or kissing in 'Brokeback' could derail their client's chances to wear the tights.  For the record, Gyllenhaal thinks any controversy about his role in 'Brokeback' is "nonsense".  Perhaps someone needs to remind Gyllenhaal's team that Christopher Reeve had no problem being Superman and playing gay in 'Deathtrap'.

       THE AMBIGUOUSLY GAY DUO?    Most watchers of 'Saturday Night Live' are familiar with the cartoon adventures of  urlLink Ambiguously Gay Duo . Produced by Robert Smigel, the cartoon details the capers of Ace and Gary, who happen to be ambiguously gay superheroes. Of course, the joke is that Ace and Gary are anything but ambiguous. Wearing matching lycra costumes accentuating their bulges and constantly assuming positions from the gay kama sutra, Ace and Gary drive a car shaped like a penis that shoots semen-shaped rays. Meanwhile, villains like the coyly monikered Big Head and the Mayor and Police Chief debate the sexuality of the terrific twosome. Innuendo abounds in the stilted dialog between Ace and Gary.  The reason I bring up Ace and Gary is that while having dinner this weekend with a group of friends they entered into the conversation. What resulted was a far more interesting discussion about the ambiguity involved in gay relationships in general. At first, the general consensus was that there was nothing ambiguous about being gay--or more specifically a gay couple. But as the discussion grew more animated, some in the group began to change their minds.  Some of the more interesting points raised in the animated discussion:  --Most everyone has gradations of intimacy--from acquaintances to closer friends and lovers.  --Gay men don't (generally) have markers of engagement, marriage, and pregnancy that characterize the bond between heterosexual couples. (This was perhaps the biggest bone of contention in the spirited debate.)  --The lack of a socially recognized status  can  be a source of ambiguity in our relationships--are we friends, occasional sex partners, or lovers?  --Though we don't need to follow heterosexual models in forming our own relationships, this ambiguity becomes problematic when it interferes with the expression of feelings.  --It is quite common to feel attracted sexually without having any idea as to whether you'll find yourselves compatible in other ways.  --If you have sex before you become emotionally involved, it can be confusing trying to figure out what else you want from each other, if anything at all.  --You may end up sleeping together once or twice, and then feel awkward trying to redefine the relationship.  --Neither of you may be ready to make the commitment that continued sexual involvement may imply, but instead of dealing with that uncertainty by talking about options and expectations, it may seem easier not to see each other.  --Not every relationship has to last forever in order for us to get some value from it, but if you had more in mind than just recreational sex, you can end up feeling seduced and abandoned.  --Some men are scared off by the intensity of their initial involvement. If you're not sure how you feel, you may hesitate to become involved emotionally.  --You don't have to know what you want in the very beginning. After seeing each other for a while, you may need some distance in order to sort through your feelings.  --What may simply be a desire on the part of one man to reclaim himself may be misinterpreted by the other as a lack of interest in building a relationship. You can avoid the misunderstanding by talking about your need for time apart, while still affirming your interest in getting to know each other.  --You can be clear about what you want at the moment, even if that involves a limit to the degree of emotional or sexual involvement you're interested in. You may feel vulnerable saying how you feel, especially when you're just first getting to know each other, but being honest about your feelings increases your capacity for intimacy in the future.  Gary and Ace have no idea how complicated being ambiguously gay is.   MONDAY MORNING READS  01.  CNN.com : David de Sola:  urlLink 'International Team to Monitor Presidential Election'  02.

The New York Times : Bob Herbert:  urlLink 'Failure of Leadership'    PROJECT D.N.A.   (*possible spoilers*)     In what must surely be  the  best episode of five seasons of  CBS's  'Big Brother', the second phase of Project D.N.A. dropped on the house like a bombshell. There were so many things that were truly classic reality television moments. From watching a flummoxed Scott get the boot by a 4-3 margin to seeing the remaining members of 'The Four Horsemen' taken out with one question in the Head Of Household competition, it was a night of delightful surprises and  consequences.  While Scott was still stunned that his housemates canned him, Julie Chen threw him down for the final count when she sprang the Natalie/Adria twist. That sequence of reaction shots is nothing short of priceless. Then, it was finally Natalie's turn to enter the house as herself after switching places with her identical twin Adria ten times over a five week period. I have to give the producers credit for setting up the perfect scenario to divulge the twist to the houseguests. While Julie Chen went back to the houseguests presumably to start the Head of Household competition, she quizzed Diane:  Julie: " Since week one, Diane, how many total houseguests have been playing the 'Big Brother' game? " Diane: " 13 " Julie: " You are incorrect. Actually, Diane, 14 houseguests have lived in the house and have played the game since week  one .  " Diane: " 14? "  With that, a pan of the houseguests faces said it all. While mouths hit the floor and exclamations rang out, the look on Jace's face was the most wicked reality television comeuppance maybe EVER! From that point the classic moments just rolled: The confused Cowboy repeatedly yelling 'It's Holly!' (not realizing that Holly was already evicted and could not be changing places with an alleged twin); The crashing sound that was the Santa Monica Van Boys imploding; Nikomus winning the coveted Head of Household title; The girls and Will hugging Nikomus, as the boys all looked like they'd lost their best friend.  It was classic television people.   TRANSATLANTICISM  I need you so much closer I need you so much closer I need you so much closer I need you so much closer So come on, come on So come on, come on So come on, come on So come on, come on  ( from the album "Transatlanticism" by Death Cab For Cutie )    Have a super weekend everybody!

       THE PASSING OF A LEGEND: HENRI CARTIER-BRESSON    " In whatever one does, there must be a relationship between the eye and the heart. One must come to one's subject in a pure spirit. One must be strict with oneself. There must be time for contemplation, for reflection about the world and the people about one. If one photographs people, it is their inner look that must be revealed ."--Henri Cartier-Bresson ------- Born in 1908 in Chanteloupe, France, Henri Cartier-Bresson was undoubtedly one of the most significant photographers of the 20th century. Though he dabbled in painting and film direction, Cartier-Bresson will undoubtedly be remembered for his exquisite black and white photographic images. At the age of 22, Cartier-Bresson picked up a 35mm Lieca and the world around him would be captured in wondrous ways on film through his keen eye. He remained devoted to the 35mm camera throughout his career. While many characterized the man as shy and unassuming, his photography was anything but. The use of light and shadows was a finishing brushstroke to his photographic canvases.  After service and capture in World War II, Cartier-Bresson was one of the founders of the illustrious Magnum Picture Agency. His photographs of people, places and events went on to preserve a lifetime of memories for a legion of devoted fans. His personal philosophy was that the camera should become 'an extension of the eye' (a phrase attributed to Cartier-Bresson). To that end, the camera became a glimpse into the mind of an intelligent and creative man.  As with many others, the stunning vision captured in a 1952 collection of his photography entitled 'The Decisive Moment' was among my earliest exposure to his work. While many of his photographs had a modest subtlety to them, the feelings and emotions captured by his eye demanded to be experienced.  The world has lost a true legend with Tuesday's passing of Monsieur Henri Cartier-Bresson.

Bassett will take on the role of a CIA bigwig who will butt heads with Sydney Bristow. The role was originally intended for a male. However, after a discussion with the writing staff, Abrams offered the role to Bassett. Her character is slated to appear in more than half of the episodes in the upcoming January 2005 season.   BOYS LIKE US 1.11  " In Falls, North Carolina, in 1957, we had just one way of 'coming out'. It was called getting caught. Every few years, cops nabbed another unlikely guy, someone admired and married--a civic fellow, not bad looking. He often coached a Pee Wee League swim team. Again we learned that the Local-Man-Least-Likely-to-Like-Boys   did  ! In our town of 2,200, this resulted in confusion unto nausea. Our  Herald Tribune  was usually sedate ("Recent Church Goings-on of Fun and Note"). It now encrusted the front page with months of gory innuendo. Circulation beefed right up. And into jail, they chucked the hearty, beautiful Dan R__, my boyhood idol ."---Mr. Alan Gurganus   IT CAN'T COME QUICKLY ENOUGH  ( from the album 'Scissor Sisters' by Scissor Sisters )  We knew all the answers And we shouted them like anthems Anxious and suspicious That God knew how much we cheated  It can't come quickly enough And now you've spent your life Waiting for this moment And when you finally saw it come It passed you by and Left you so defeated  (J. Sellards/S. Hoffman)

       OBLIQUE RECOMMENDATIONS    The  HBO Films/Fine Line Features  production of  urlLink 'Maria Full of Grace'  is a gripping and engrossing look at the residual costs of the illicit trade of drugs. However, beyond being a haunting film, 'Maria Full of Grace' marks a tour de force performance from Colombian-born Catalina Sandino Moreno.  Playing 17 year-old Maria Alvarez, Moreno brings a heartbreaking nuance to her portrayal of a drug mule. Boarding a flight to New York City with 62 heroin-filled capsules in her stomach, Maria's story is riveting. Meanwhile, Moreno deftly carries a naturalistic and captivating presence that marks a true star turn.  The 23 year-old actress--who had never read a film script--beat out more than 800 other actresses for the role. Additionally, during the course of filming Ms. Sandino Moreno actually swallowed four non-heroin filled capsules to create a gritty realism and authenticity to Maria's plight.  'Maria Full of Grace' won the Dramatic Audience Award at Sundance earlier this year. It also earned Moreno a co-Best Actress prize (with Charlize Theron) at the Berlin International Film Festival. 'Maria Full of Grace' at times is difficult to watch, yet it demands to be watched.    Gioia Bruno was once a member of the highly successful trio Exposé. Now, her debut solo album has finally seen the light of day on Koch Records. Cheekily titled  urlLink 'Expose This' , one of the album's tracks, 'From The Inside', enjoyed success in late 2003 after appearing in an episode of 'Queer As Folk' and being remixed by Junior Vasquez.  As a whole, the album is nothing less than what you'd expect. Killer diva vocals, great beats and hook-laden tracks. The album's first single, 'Be Mine', was written by Gioia, Drew Sessa and Charlie Pennachio. Other key tracks include: 'Every Little Thing', 'I Was Made For Loving You' and 'Going, Going, Gone'. This one is a must-have.   QUICKIES  01. The August 8-14th edition of  TV Guide  names Dave Chappelle the Funniest Man on TV. Concurrently, Chappelle has just negotiated a $50 million contract with  Comedy Central . Who's laughing now?  02. Continuing its tradition of boldly treading where no network dare go,  HBO  has just greenlit its latest episodic series entitled 'Big Love'. The intial ten episode order will tell the story of a Utah polygamist (Bill Paxton) and his three wives. Signed to co-star: Chloe Sevigny, Gennifer Goodwin, Jeanne Tripplehorn, Harry Dean Stanton and Grace Zabriskie. Look for a mid-2005 debut.  03. Julian McMahon ('Nip/Tuck') is the latest actor to sign on to the cast of the highly-anticipated 'Fantastic Four' film. McMahon will play the quartet's main nemesis Dr. Doom.

New York Metro : Emily Nussbaum:  urlLink 'Six Feet Under's That's My Dog Episode'    HOLLYWOOD NOTES  01. Kiera Knightley ('King Arthur') has just signed on to the lead role in the true-life action thriller 'Domino'. 'Domino' chronicles the life of Domino Harvey who left a career as a Ford model to become an unlikely bounty hunter. Based on a script by Richard Kelly, the film will be directed by Tony Scott ('Man On Fire') for  New Line Cinema . Principal photography will begin next month in Los Angeles and Las Vegas for a 2005 release.  02. Director Gary Fleder ('Runaway Jury') will helm 'Fear of Heights' for  MGM . The film is based on Susan Eisenberg's book 'We'll Call You If We Need You: Experiences of Women Working Construction'. The script will center on a working-class, single mom who becomes the first female member of the Ironworker's Union.  03. Director Michael Canton-Jones is lensing 'Shooting Dogs' for  BBC Films . Starring John Hurt and Hugh Dancy, the film explores the 1994 genocide in Rwanda. Principal photography began in July on location in Kigali, Rwanda.  04. The remake of the 1979 horror classic 'The Amityville Horror' begins shooting today. As previously announced, the film stars Ryan Reynolds and Melissa George ('Alias'). Recently announced casting additions include: Philip Baker Hall, Jesse James and Chloe Moretz.  05. William Hurt and Ed Harris will join Viggo Mortensen in David Cronenberg's 'A History of Violence'.     FOR WHOM THE BELL TOLLS  In ten days, I will be 39 years old. The number and physicality of that fact does not bother me in the slightest. I think turning 30 was the only time I felt aging was traumatic.  What is interesting to me is that 39 will mark my tenth year as an out, open gay man. Even though embracing my sexuality was a difficult process, today I feel so comfortable in my own skin that it nearly becomes an afterthought.  I have to confess that turning 39 does disconcert me on one front. I guess I would have to liken it to people who talk about their biological clock as 'ticking'. In my case, it's not a biological issue--but a romantic one. Do we have a relationship clock? Sometimes, I think I do. More disconcerting is the feeling that my clock is running out.  Having had two long-term relationships (the longest of which was over four years), the past two years I've embraced being single and 'me' time. Yet, I would be completely lying if I did acknowledge this nagging desire boiling in me to settle down--to finally find 'the one' and settle down long term. It's the call to nesting that is weighing on my mind and heart.  I suppose my biggest fear is that the time for that has past. Yet, the hopeless romantic in me says that is just pessimism. It is this internal struggle about whether I'm too old or have missed my opportunity, that does make the looming birthday a bit precarious.  Where have all the good men gone?
