      The dictionary defines a promise as "A declaration assuring that one will or will not do something; a vow." Now knowing that this is a "vow", why do some people through this word around like it is nothing? Why do people "promise" they are going to do something, only to turn around and shit, on your hopes and dreams later on. "oh well I didn't know, Oh well I didn't think" Yeah that's right bitch, you didn't think. You probably haven't thought more then once in your life, and any thoughts you might have are quickly, scooped up and shit on by your spouse, or guardian. Let me stop "ranting" and explain.  In life NOTHING, is guaranteed. I can accept that. But, I can't accept, people who I let in my life, fucking shit up. I can deal with things, when I can't get them. When things I can't control, don't work out. But don't make my pain or truimph, trivial. It's just not ok. It's not what "all the cool kids are doing", and it's not for me!  I had a "friend". I use the " 'S, because a real friend, would not do,  what these "friends" did.  So this "friend" was going through a hard time. Her mother died, her brother was living in foster care, and life was just pretty much going down hill. So me being the FRIEND I am, tried to help out. Big mistake. This girl, moved into my one bedroom tiny ass apartment. Took over it, and then in time after we moved to a two bedroom. Took over that too, after she put no help into moving into the two bedroom. And, then proceeded to have her little brother over, (when she was not allowed by DYFS) along with countless men, and god knows what else came through here. I'm sorry but I have a little girl. The deal was, you move in until you get back on your feet, not your skanky ass friends, hook ups, and God knows what else you have going in and out of here. Then when confronted, she went all pycho bitch on me. Oh no, that HAD to go. So IT did, and I lost a "friend" Good riddance.  So, I go along in life, vowing never to make the same mistake again. And what happens, Another "friend" fucks me over. Thankfully not in the he same way, but close enough. I had these "friends" who lived across the way in an apartment complex I once lived in. We became close, my friends became thiers, and thiers became mine, hell we spent, enough time together, why not right. The difference was my friends thought they were old and stupid, thier friends thought I was young and cool (which by the way I am. (No one can do the WGD like me) Sorry getting off topic, just stating the odvouis. So they know I am a single mom, and they "promise" me a table and chair set they have when they get a new one. OK, I laugh and am like ok. They say "no we are serious, it's yours" "we promise" Ok so now I am like ok, I believe you and thank you. It takes three years, b/c everything in life takes time, (except for maybe there dating-engagement-wedding concept) But they get a new set, and I am promised the old one. First it is promised to my other friend, my true friend. I call them up joke around a little and they say "oh sorry we forgot, it's yours we promised" Now the point of the call wasn't to call them on it, but to joke around, friends do that, (IF YOU DON'T JOKE AROUND WITH YOUR FRIENDS, YOU AREN'T REALLY FRIENDS!! TAKE A JOKE, IT'S OK! JUST AN FYI)  They promise blah blah blah, and I am like ok, here we go I get a new set, YAY! But guess what it goes to the bitch (friends) father. Great, after 3 years and 3 promises I get jack shit, except for a shit on feeling. Now let me make something clear, b/c I know about now it is sounding like all I care about is the set. No I care about the promise. I don't make one, unless I intend on keeping it, that is why I rarely make them. I don't throw, the word love around. The people I love, know damn well they are loved. So I have no need to throw such a special word around. That is also the word promise to me. Is it just me? Am I living in a different world? And the way I was told, "well I was going to tell you, but I wanted to wait until you said something, so you wouldn't get to "cheesed" What is that?  It's a piece of shit friend that's what it is. Let me make a notice to the public now, Weed out these vermin. You don't need it, you know you don't want it. And, if it comes in double trouble size. Run for your life!
