      I went to a Newsboys concert tonight and took some youth kids.  It was pretty exciting.  They put on a great show.  The theme of the concert was worship and it was more of a worship service kind of thing instead of a concert.  As we left one of our girls told me about a friend she saw there that was making out with some random guy.   Kind of blew my mind that at a Christian concert kids would just start making out randomly.   How messed up is that!  It pretty much pissed me off.  It is amazing how disrespectful we can be sometimes.  The whole idea was to turn our attention and affirmation towards God and instead we pervert it and turn it on each other.  How it much hurt Him when we take our affection and toss it around as if it is not special and meant for a purpose.  It is as if we say, " Look here God...This should be for you...but what do I care!!!"    hmmm...

      We just looked to see how much of a house we could afford with our income.  Well...you guys know about any houses for $16,000?

      My thoughts through today have been nothing to write about but being the person that I am and wanting all of my 15 minutes of mini-fame I will continue to write and post something.  My drive for spending time with God has been lowered recently...of course it is my own fault.  It is just easier to let it go than to do anything about it.  How quick your mind can wonder from thinking of "Godly things" to anything else that happens to pop up....that would be how I would rate my day.  As one where God tried to show Himself but I was quick to look away.  Seems to be a consistent event in my life....Like I said...nothing to write home about. It is the same old story for most of us.  The question is what will we...eerrr...I will do to change it.  It is hard sometimes to be in a position where you lead and teach other people to do the things that you always fail to do. Is it that way with most jobs? And how much can something actually be a passion if you continue to fail at it?  Can I truly have a passion for Christ if I continue to fail Him???  Isn't the whole idea of passion in itself that it pushes you do something?  If so then how can I say I have it if I fail to do what the passion would cause me to do??? Maybe passion should be the word of the day for you "word of the day" guys.   It is an interesting one.

      My mom was here today and last night.  It was good to see her....Kind of weird to have your parents at YOUR OWN place...not use to that yet.  It is funny to look back and think about all the time before when she was always yelling at me for something.  This time she can't...I can do as I please...oh...but my wife can still yell at me.  Married life is great.  It is different than I expected it to be but in an amazing way.  I wouldn't change it for anything!  You really do become "one flesh".  It is one of those things that you have to experience to really understand.  I hear that having a child is the same way....but let's not travel down that path yet.   ok...goodnight everyone.  More insight to come!!! WOO HOO!

       Well...my sinuses have been getting the best of me lately.  I know everyone wants to know that.  It has helped me to get up early in the morning though, so that could be a good thing.  It is an awesome day outside...nice and warm....I don't really have much to say.  I just had a desire to post something....this thing is addictive, even if no one reads it.      One thought I do have is on how money can really grab you.  You think you know about it when you are in high school or maybe even college, but man it really hits you when you are on your own.  So many expenses come into play that you never thought were even there! It's like, "We have to PAY for that?  Shouldn't food just be free?!?!".  Yesterday I wanted to buy some stuff for the computer, but Jamie said, "Do we really need that because we just don't have the money right now." Well...I knew she was right I just didn't want to hear it.  It even made me mad for awhile...How stupid is that?!  I got over it...but you just think you are above those kind of things and sometimes you still get caught up in it.  We do that with God a lot.  Except unlike Jamie was to me, God isn't as vocal about His view on it.  Kinda brings new meaning to  "be still and know."  Sometimes we just need to listen when the last thing we want to do is listen.  Sometimes I wish God would yell it out and let me be angry with Him for a day even though I know that He is right.  Well, I guess "be still and know" is in the good book for a reason.  Freedom can be a  damaging thing.   well..that is it for me...now play outside.

      Ok...This is my first time to try to use this thing.  I know I am light years behind the rest of the "blogging world", but ya know...someone has to bring up the end.     Ok...Well,  I was just thinking of what this thing is like.  It is kind hard to just start putting all your thoughts out there, at least for me it is.  Of course the closest thing I can compare it to is song writing. You are basically putting everything out there. The big difference though is that with this people aren't just staring back at you as if you are crazy as you sing these songs that they have never heard, nor do they understand the depth the songs mean to you.  Hmm...maybe in some ways it is better...still....you can't really get the emotion into it as with a song...At least that is my take on it.  Anywho...this seems fun.  We will see how it works out.

      Worship is an amazing thing.  I love to do it and of course God loves it from us.  I wish my life was completely a life of worship, but I know there are times when I fail at that.  But the amazing thing is that the same grace we sing about is the true grace that comes to us...that God is faithful through all things.  How wonderful that is!  That even though I am a complete jerk and so wishey washey sometimes, God is always faithful, always the same, always....God.   I just got a new bible... urlLink The Message  by Eugene Peterson. I love it...it is so easy to read.  It isn't really a bible for studying and using scripture from, but more of one for reading though...more of a story bible.  I love it!    Also I found some cool worship music. Check out  urlLink Jason Upton ...I like it...Jamie doesn't really as much as me, so you may not.  You can listen to some of his stuff on the website so check it out.  Maybe it will uplift you...get you in a heart of worship.

      I just returned from  urlLink Ichthus   in Kentucky.  It was fun, but really muddy.  Youth ministry is really pushing me right now. It has been rough the last week or so. It is hard for me to be strict with the kids, sometimes I just feel that I am always negative with them, but on the same hand they are wild as can be and have no respect for me or any of my sponsors. It is frustrating.  I have other thoughts on the issue...but I will save them...maybe later today or maybe another day.

      I just listened to Greg's new song on his website called  urlLink Be The Body .  It is awesome!!! Great hook, great sound, great message!     He is doing  urlLink 52 songs in 52 weeks . If you haven't checked it out you should go over to his site and give them a listen. He also has TONS of resources for ministry as well as great insight...(I stole the background picture from him).  Danny did an amazing job of recording this song too and Scott always does awesome on drums.  He did great back in the day when he recorded our stuff, but I can really hear a difference...If you need to be recorded you should get with Danny and get his studio to do it for ya...awesome.  Wow...it is great to have such talented friends even if you don't get to see them that much.  As for me, I am headed to the Ichthus festival...three days of camping and music and kids!!  Let's chat some more when I get back...ok? OK.

      Tomorrow I leave to take a bunch of high school kids to a huge music event...3 days of camping and listening to music.  I am excited about it even though I would change the line up a little if I was in control.  There are great bands, don't get me wrong just not all my type of stuff...Some music just really inspires me a lot.  Some bands just give you that extra push...change your mood... change your desires...music is just awesome.  Well, it should be a lot of fun.  Maybe some day Clarksville will have a large local music scene.  It was just so much fun in Knoxville to hang around the coffee houses and get to know the different songwriters.  I didn't realize how much I would miss it till it was gone. Oh and one more thing...my wife took me to a quilt show today. Yeah...seriously.....I know, I know.

      Well,  my wife just got back last night from being gone for 4 days....we will just say that I missed her and leave it at that. I am glad she is back.  It is a humbling thing to have something (or someone) that you love and want leave for awhile just to be able to see how much you do need it (or them). It helps you to appreciate it more.  I am just very thankful for her...thanks God.     Today was nothing really exciting...I have to talk to a 9 year old this week about understanding what it means to be baptized and have Jesus in your life.  I don't even really know the parents and I am not completely sure how you go about doing this.  What really is the meaning of understanding at that age? How much must they really know and be able to comprehend to be baptized??  And if they don't do you tell them to go home and study and try again in 6 months like they did with the Bible test at school???   Hmm...  I started a small group or d-group for the high school tonight....we had 2 kids.  So we just talked about how we want things to go and then went to Dairy Queen (they have cotton candy blizzards now).  It went ok...I would dream for it to be better....but it was a great chance to get to know the 2 that where there a little more.  When I was in youth group we didn't have small groups...I don't really think I had ever heard of the idea actually...how do you guys format yours for the youth??    Well...that is it.  I think I might pop some popcorn and watch a movie. (Tres is rubbing off on me again)

      Hey everybody... Wow..It is awesome to be able to read about all your friends and how things are going with them.  it doesn't replace going to visit or hanging out, but it is an easy way to keep up.  So much is going on...it is weird...well, actually exciting to see all the changes that go on in your life. It is like you live little  mini-lifes that come together.  I think of all the people I have known and different places I have lived..(and it is only like 3 or 4 places).  I guess I am just saying that it is awesome to have so many friends even if you don't get to see them all the time.  Just to be a part of their life for the time frame you where there...exciting..I miss Knoxville...I miss Pittsburgh...I miss Nashville...and I love Clarksville.  Every place is different and every place is awesome...If only I could just combine them all and have all my friends live in the same city....maybe Daynevillesburgh....well, that might be a little much to ask... I am so greatful for all you guys (and gals)....God is just amazing.

      I sat down today like I use to do back in college when I would write a song at the computer.  I usually would just open up Word on my buddy Scott's computer and start writting...I must have covered his computer with random meaningless songs...sorry Scott. :)  Anyway...I decided to do it today, but instead of using Word I just used my blog.  Don't try to read to much into this...It was just a quick one.  I think sometimes I love the process more than the actually songs that come out...maybe that was why i did it so much and didn't really push the songs...i miss those writing days   DAYS  oh the days go by and i just sit here wondering where I'm going to and how you came to me so strong cause i know it's nothing that i said and i know it's nothing that i know how to do because right now proves that i can be wrong  oh i sit and dream of you day and night  a piece of life that hit me when i thought that life had already gone and as i wonder where i fit in space  you come on in and invade my place have i really been dreaming this long?  What if it isn't just what they want? another tale of hope and fail and love and inbetween i look out at all i have to see can anything exist past what i dream for me at least it all just runs together it all just jumps together it all just slides into forever  oh i sit and dream of you day and night  a piece of life that hit me when i thought that life had already gone and as i wonder where i fit in space  you come on in and invade my place have i really been dreaming this long?

      I have been reading and thinking.  So many times we get hit with the "that would never work" mentality.  I think a lot of it comes from ourselves.  We get these great ideas, hopes, and dreams that come up and root themselves in our thoughts and imaginations but we some how work ourselves out from giving them a try...from stepping out and giving it a chance.  Did you know that Walt Disney went bankrupt multiple times before making it?  Did you know that Howard Schultz (Starbucks guy) started out with pretty much nothing and grew up in the projects??  Did you know that Mary Kay spent her life savings and her husband died a month before she started her business? Also her accountant and lawyer told her to cash it all in because it would never work!         so many things in the world push you to think that you can never make it.  My advice would be to count the cost.  What have you got to lose???  If the loss is something you can handle then I would say to go for it! You can do it!!!     There is your encouragement for the day. :)

      Well...In a couple of hours me and a bunch of adults are going to drive around town and "kidnap" all of our youth. (well...at least most of them)  It will start at 3am and go until around 7 or 8 I think.  We are going to get each one, blindfold them, and take them all to Shoneys to eat some breakfast and talk about how Christ can come at anytime and we gotta be ready.... Based off of Matthew 24...."thief in the night".  Hope it goes off smooth...It is going to be a lot of fun!!! Can't wait!  :)     oh yeah...and we are filming them....WOO HOO!

      Does this verse kind of scary ya sometimes???    "Not many should be come teachers, my brothers, knowing they will receive a stricter judgment;"                                                                                                                                  -James 3:1     We have decided to become teachers even though we know that the judgment on us will be stricter.  The key is to not get puffed up with spiritual and intellectual pride.  It is dangerous to fake the gift of teaching, but sometimes it seems you just fall into the position of being a teacher.

      It has been a fun Friday.  The only bad news about it is that I have to buy gas in the morning...that is a bummer considering it is about $1.75 a gallon.  On the up side my taxes are done!!!! I guess all the return that I get now must go for gas so that I continue to drive around....bummer.... I wonder if gas prices will continue to rise?  I really hope not.    Also we are trying to start a youth band...I am really excited about this!!! I few of the kids we have are really into music and I am pumped about getting them involved with worship.   I know it may be a little rough at first, but I really want to get it to where it is complete youth done. I think to start I am going to have to lead, but my hope is that it will not be for long....right now we have a drummer, bass player, and me for guitar and stuff, and some other singers.....Any ideas or advice on starting a youth praise band from scratch???

      Hey everyone.  Tomorrow I am leaving to go to Southeast Christian Church for their big conference.  Everyone keeps talking about how amazing the church is.  I am sure it is awesome to see.  Sometimes I wonder what it takes to become a church like that...I wonder what traits the leaders of these "mega" churches have in common beyond the desire and relationship with Christ.  What I mean is their gifts and abilities...are there certian things that run true across the board?  Maybe there aren't because God used a bunch of misfits all through the bible to run things...just take Moses for example.  I know there has been tons of studies done on these churches.  Anything successful has people studying it and after it.  Anyways...I rambled on with all that just to say that I am going to Southeast tomorrow for the rest of the week.  No more posts.  Not sure how many people read this, but for you that do...no more posts this week.  Maybe one tomorrow before I leave, but none until Saturday after that.  It is interesting to me that as humans we can become so run down so fast that we need constant encouragement.  It only takes a little of "you can't" to make you beleive it, but it takes a TON of "you can" to make you step out and do it...we are such silly people... bye.

      It is Wednesday so as always we had youth group.  It went pretty good.  I go through times were I wonder if this is exactly what I am suppose to do....not the working with youth part, but the being in charge of it part.  Sometimes I just feel that I don't have it.  There are so many other people that could speak better than me and plan a lot better than me.  I still love the position and the ability to serve God and get paid for it! That is great!!!  How many jobs do you have were you can hang out with kids and focus on God AND get paid all in one day!?!?!?!  Music is still my passion though....I would love to get back to leading worship.  Also we are really low on money right now.  I mean low as in we have NONE.  It really forces you to give everything to God...even though right now we don't have much to give.

      Hey guys...    I am at camp this week and things are going pretty good.  I only got 4 hours of sleep last night because a bunch of Jr. High boys would not be quiet and lay down.  It was pretty frustrating, but God is leting me know that this is not about me...it is about Him using me.  Sometimes hard to grasp, but we must or we will go crazy.   Camp is ok...there are things I wish were different as everyone does with anything...good ole opinions.   Well...I can't really post a lot because I am short on time.  See ya....talk later...

      Ok...  So I have been playing the idea of furthering my education and not that you guys are the source of decision, but I was wondering what you thought about the idea.  I want to get my MBA.  I just think it would be useful for the future and partially because my wife is starting her own business. I am not sure if this is even really possible with just a BS from a Bible college.  The other plan is to get an undergrad in business and marketing.  Any thoughts on this???  It is just some ideas that are floating through my brain and I feel would be helpful with running the new business...

      I just had a change of opinions from yesterdays post.  Hanging out with people can be a good way to get to know them...but you can hang out for too much time.  Three girls from the youth group stayed the night and I am glad there is peace and quiet in my home once more.  They are great kids though...(and by the way, my wife invited them and hung out with them. I was just here.)      Well..the other thing is that I am getting frustrated with some things with ministry.  I am trying to figure out why that is, but I can't really figure out why I am not into it right now.  I am kinda just going through a dry spell I guess.  Nothing in particular is bothering me. It is just everything...maybe I just need to back up for a bit and refocus.

      Hey...Today we had a church picnic.  It was fun...played some softball and hung out with everybody. Times of just talking and goofing off are awesome. I really think it is where you start to get to know someone.  Formal things are cool too, but it is during those times were you just hang out with no real reason that you let yourself be you.  Just fun times...oh and I killed about 20 flies today in our house.  Where they came from I have no idea....my wife wanted me to suck them up with the vacuum so that they would not be all over the floor...Well, that didn't work too well.  So I used a flip flop and took them out.  Then we vacuumed.

      We had a yard sale today and yesterday with a few other friends. We ended up making $20!! We didn't really have that much to add to the sale so that was a lot for us!  Those .25 and .50 cent items add up.  So...now we can buy gas! We are also having a church picnic tomorrow and that should be fun.  Oh..Mean Girls was interesting. I never knew that girls in high school were so mean to each other. They really are...it is scary.  I thought the movie was pretty funny and poked fun at some of the stupid stuff we consider important as kids.  It did have a good point or message to it.  Just don't rush out to the theater to see it.  Just wait until it comes on video...good, but not so great.   Well...talk to you guys later.  Leave a comment why don'tcha!!!

      I am in a mood to post a lot today.  This is my second one and most of the time I go weeks without doing it.  I guess I am trying to make up for all the days I have missed.  I know the internet has not been the same without me throwing my 2 cents out into it.  So I better get right on that.     Me and Jamie are about to go see a movie in a couple of hours.  I wanted to see Saved! but it isn't out yet.  I just wanted to see what it is all about.  Check out the trailer and stuff...not really sure about what angle it is coming from, but I want to find out.  Well, since that isn't out we are going to see Mean Girls.  From what I have read it got pretty good reviews.  Most of them said it is more than just another teen movie, which is good to know.  I will let you know my thoughts (because ofcourse this is my blog) when I get back from it.  I think it just goes after the politics in high school culture..mostly girlie politics I would assume because it is about girls.  But like I said I will let you know when I get back.  Oh...and we got our wedding album back.  It is freakin' awesome!!! That is worth extra points because I am a guy too! Half the time I can't tell the difference between these things, but this one is amazing!  Come over sometime and you can see it....maybe even stay for dinner...well...until you make that visit.  Post some comments, give me a call, or start the drive.  Either way...talk to you later.

      Hey guys...   I told my friend Tres that I would read with him through Proverbs and post about it.  Well...I dropped that ball and basicly did none of it.  So I am repenting from that now. Sorry Tres & way to go for keeping it up!! I love reading your blog and comments.  Always good stuff.    Last night we just played some games with the kids.  It was a lot of fun! We played a game that is almost the same as ultimate frizbee.  The difference is you use a roll of toilet paper covered in duck tape instead.  Also there is a box around the goal that no one can step in except the goalie.  It is tons of fun! We played for about half an hour!   It was good just to hang out and play with the kids without caring if they listen or soak anything in....just taking time to be on their level and be a kid.  Sometimes you have to really do that to get back to what it is all about.  Next week one of the elders is going to teach to them.  Get ready for a 180!! :)

      Sorry for the long delay.  I have been busy doing different stuff...going to camp, helping shoot a wedding, those kind of things.  Nothing extremely exciting is going on right now.  Well, one thing is that almost every couple in our small group at church is pregnant except for us.  That is kinda crazy... everybody wants to have babies.  I am not quite ready for that.      Well..I understand how Nate feels about ministry. It hits me all the time like that.  I seem to be going back and forth with things.  Sometimes I just get mad at the kids other times at me and my effort and other times just at the fact that I can see someone else that can do EVERYTHING I try to do better without even trying.  It is tough to get away from all that and just do what God wants you to do.  Well..I will try to post later, but for now I need food and we have none in the house....time to shop!   See ya guys ..love ya.

      I have been thinging a lot about Josh and what happened.  The funeral is today and I wish I could have made it.  I just wasn't able to afford to leave.  I am in such shock about the whole thing and have really thought about my views and priorities in life.  Death makes you refocus some of those things and understand how fragile life really is.  I don't want to drone on too long about this, but it has been coming into my mind often.  Josh was an awesome guy...He truly will be missed.

      Living in a town full of military people you start to understand how hard it can be to leave your family like that.&nbsp; I never really thought about it until I was put in the lives of people who live with it everyday.&nbsp; Now that I have friends that come and go like that with young kids and spouses it is a lot more real.&nbsp; I guess there are a lot of things in life that we just don't really understand how much they effect people until it starts to penitrate our own life.&nbsp; Hmm...it is kinda the same way with Jesus.&nbsp; Just think about it for a sec...All that he did doesn't really mean that much to us.&nbsp; I mean we know he suffered and he died...yeah yeah...and that he did it for some great cause and purpose.&nbsp; No one can really deny that....but it is when you start to see that the purpose was you and it effects you everyday.&nbsp; He was in your family...or better said you are in his and the outcome of his life goes straight into your own livingroom.&nbsp; That is when it becomes real and that is when it means something.&nbsp; You start to act on it....not out of force or duty, but out of the same reason he acted for you.....love.&nbsp; Love is a powerful thing and as good ole Huey Lewis said....That's the power of love.&nbsp; (that last comment invertly comes from Tres some how)&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp; On a lighter note we looked for houses today.&nbsp; It was fun.&nbsp; Life is moving on.&nbsp; Next week we are going to actually see inside of some of the houses...and tomorrow we are baby sitting.&nbsp; Oh my how life seems to just move right along.&nbsp; Before you know it we will all be out of style.&nbsp; Except I think the 80's are coming back around.&nbsp; Anybody else notice that?!?!&nbsp; Well..I am not proofreading this so if it doesn't make sense....skip it.&nbsp; ;)  see ya....dayne.

      For all of you that continue to come to my blog and wonder..."Will he ever post again?"...well...the answer is yes & today!  What a deal!!!  To tell you the truth I just forget to do it.  Today I am taking about 10 kids to play glow golf.  That should be crazy.  Jamie is going to Brittany Smith's wedding in a couple of days.  You remember her Tres??? She is getting married this weekend.  So I will be all by myself for the weekend.  Anybody want to come over? Last night we went to WalMart to get some food so I wouldn't starve and there was a tornado warning or something and they made us all stand in the middle of Walmart for 45 minutes.  There was an amish family there standing beside us.  At least I think it was amish.  I don't really understand them. They had like 5 kids and looked like the wild kids that I teach at church but didn't act like them.  Are they allowed to have a Nintendo or a Playstation?? With all the things out today if they couldn't have one it seems they would go crazy!  I mean...they are still kids.  Anyway...it was interesting to me becuase I don't know much about them and why they do what they do.  Ok...off to play Glow Golf!!! Talk later.

      Today is the day after July 4th (otherwise known as July 5th).  My wife is at camp, but I had to come home to do some things for work and I am going back there tomorrow.  Things are going pretty good.  We are hoping to get a house before our lease ends on the townhouse, but I am not sure if that will work out as smooth as I hope it does.  Also we are trying to get her business up and running and it is taking some time. Still...things are going great.  Life is good...everyone around us is having kids and it has really made us start to think about it.  It seems WAY to soon though, but at the same time I am 26 years old.  I don't want to be a dad of a high school at the age of 60.  Just doesn't seem that fun.  I miss my old friends...wish we could all get together sometime and just have a big party.  Sounds like a great idea to me...who wants to tackle that?!!? ;)

      Hey...Friends are awesome.  I am learning that more and more as I go through life.  They are essential for everything....we need them.  Like I have heard said before "sometimes you need Jesus with skin".  I am VERY grateful for the friends I have.  I love them.   Tonight at our small group we talked about the difference between the soul and the spirit.  What is the real difference if there is one???  Are they the same?  One person said that in the greek there is a term for each and they are both used differently in the bible.  I've never really thought a whole lot about it to real dive into it.  Soul and spirit??? What do you know??? Any insight into that one???  Talk to you guys later....thanks for the friendships ;)
