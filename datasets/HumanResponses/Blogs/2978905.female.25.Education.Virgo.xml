      So... the news as of late, I am still working towards the whole learning the guitar bit.  I must say that I am rather impressed that I have not yet given up, though I have certainly thought about it.  I would like to learn a few more songs, just so that I don't have to constantly play the intro to Disarm.  That I can say, was the first song I learned, thanks to my brother.  I also phoned him up this afternoon, and he taught me the intro to Time of My Life, by Green Day....  I will defeat you Mr. Murphy.. it will take time, but I am certain to defeat you.  For all of you who are not yet aware of Mr. Murphy.. he is my shiny red guitar.  We are great friends.  I would say that is about it... Pretty boring for a Sunday afternoon, but I would think that was what Sundays were made for.    Cheerio

      Hello.  This whole bit is actually new to me.... I was reading someone's Blog.. I figured that since I like typing a lot, and I traditionally have nothing exciting to say... someone might want to read that.  So... yeah.  I also like to type those dots a lot, so you will have to get used to it.  I know it is a terribloe habit for an english teacher to get into... although I will never say "cuz".  That is just plain irritating.  As you have noticed, I have already managed to type a whole paragraph on absolutely nothing... it's what I am good at.  Welcome to.. this is my brain speaking.  I am sure we will get relatively well acquainted.  Cheers.

      Hmm..... blog blog blogging.  Here is something I worked on this weekend.  It's called...   Past Midnite  Staying up late With everything to say We laughed as we sipped our drinks Smiling I wanted it to last forever Of course it never can And then, happy turned to sad When you were no where to be found Now I am ... Staying up late With nothing to say The smile has gone  This.... poem.... is because I had an exceptional conversation with a chap, and he asked if I would be around... where in which I said I would, and he didn't ever show.  The problem is.. is that we had great conversations, and I actually feel like I miss talking to him... so.. yeah, that sucks.  Anyways, other than that, things are pretty much the same.  Yawn.

      Aloha.  I don't have much to say really.  You would think that after spending 8 hours in a car driving, I would have a lot to talk about, the truth is.. I don't.  I spent the May long weekend at home... in that city where I am originally from.  I visited with family, and friends... and it was sure a fun time.  So, I'm going to talk about something I hate.. it was a result of an experience I had.. whilst home.  Apparently... I am a bridesmaid in my good friends wedding.  And, that part is ok.  The part that sucks BIGTIME is that part where you are getting your dress sewn, and everyone is in there poking and prodding you.  I actually had to tell my friends fiance to turn around when they had my shirt lifted way up.  You would think people would just figure that out.  OH, hey.. that girl is half naked, perhaps I shouldn't be staring at her.  Either that, or they should call the wedding off, because he really wants to be with me :)  Perhaps I should ask him.  Anyways... my friend told me that I could wear whatever undergear I wanted to, and I did... low and behold the seamstress was yelling at me because I wasn't wearing the right stuff... I also forgot my damn shoes at home..  Wasn't a good scene.  Oh yeah, and everyone pretty much saw me naked.  Not cool.... not cool....    I guess I just think everyone should wear whatever the hell they want.  OR>.. just go to a store and buy dresses that fit people.  Uh huh.  That's pretty much all I had to say.  Oh yeah, and... beef jerky is good.

      Now is likely not an appropriate time to be writing... however, I feel that it is somewhat necessary.  I don't know why it's necessary.. I was going to rant on about my excessive boredom.  But at the moment I am absolutely irritated by a certain person. This is likely one of those blogs you write now.. and delete later.  People might figure out that you're a lunatic, if they ..even for a moment, can understand the true capacity of your brain.  By yours.. I mean mine.  So... I went to get my hair done today, always a pleasure.  This time I had to match it to some fabric for the wedding party I am a part of this weekend.  I have convinced myself, though it wasn't hard, that Saturday is going to be the longest day in all of eternity.  Hair style and make-up at 9... wedding, pictures, supper,reception,dance, bed.  Yay Bed!  Summer Holidays -->  Last blog I mentioned about how I wasn't looking forward to working.  Apparently the summer job doesn't actually need my help.  This makes me very sad, because although I can openly admit to dreading it, it's been four days of me being completely bored out of my mind.  A summer job would have been nice.  Crazy person... I'm just going to let that slide.  Apparently that is all I have to say.  My cousin is coming for a visit this weekend, starting tomorrow actually, and there is never a dull moment when we are together, so I can admit that I am SO Looking forward to her coming.  I might have to ask for time off from my boredom. Yikes.  Until Next Time.

      Summer... Vacation.....  How exciting.   You know, one of the many plusses of being a teacher, is that you get an extended summer holiday.  I am starting that holiday tomorrow... how is it starting?  I will pack almost everything I own, and move home for the summer.  Apparently I have decided to take a summer job, you know.. because I will need the money.  Um.. in case you weren't sure... that was sarcasm.  I don't actually need the money.  I am trying to convince myself that I will be bored out of my mind, and want something to do.  That is the only way thinking of it makes any sense....  Don't work... or work... when you're getting paid for the summer, it makes perfect sense to just not work.  However.. not exactly what I am doing.  Uh.  I don't have much to talk about really.  I successfully completed the year... I must say that I am slightly sad to be moving home.. I established some wonderful relationships while I was here.. and to leave them.. seems a bit sad.  Low and behold I will be back in August.. to start the whole process over again. Alas.. this is what I prepared myself for.  Thats pretty much it.  I haven't written any scary lame assed poetry lately, nor do I intend to soon....  just for your information.  So.. have a joyous summer.. I am sure I will post more due to my extreme summer boredom.  Until then.... Ciao!

      Uh... yeah.  I have been feeling a bit crazy lately, and I wrote about it. So.. for this blog, you can read it.. and stuff.    Just Another Life to Steal  Cut it deep, to the core Cut the memories, cut them more Take a stab, rip it out Make it scream, make it shout Flip the switch, turn it on Make it weak, make it strong Take the pain, make it worse Cast a spell, cast a curse Carry on, play your game You will always feel the same Tear it up, tear and shred What do you care, you're not dead Point and laugh, point and stare Try again, one last dare Melt it, stab it, make it cut Feel the pain inside your gut? Make it hurt, make it bleed Plant your crop, plant your seed bring it forward, bring it back feed the hunger, feed the stack Grind it down, make it meat Make it sweat, accept defeat Blow it up, pop it down Show it's weakness, make it drown Hold it down, watch it go One last battle, one last show Watch it struggle, one last fight One last chance to dance tonight Wave it down, say goodbye Shed a tear, pretend to cry It was nothing, no big deal Just another life to steal You won't feel it, it's not you It's me you're casting pain on to

      I haven't written in a bit.&nbsp; So many things are going on in my life right now, and unfortunately none I can speak of.&nbsp; You know how it is.. people might find stuff out, and that would be bad.&nbsp; So... it slightly defeats the purpose of having ablog if you can't even write about the stuff you think you should get off your chest.&nbsp; Meh.&nbsp; What can you do? &nbsp; I'm not sure if you've noticed, but when I am upset, or stressed.. I tend to do some creative writing.&nbsp; This will mean nothing to you, and everything to me.&nbsp;  &nbsp; What I found in&nbsp; you &nbsp; Sitting in the same spot For over an hour Holding the phone I thought this would be easy I wait for a knock on the door I search for something in you Glass shattered on the floor I. Feel. Brushed off becomes my middle name I am not fond. I'm in this game until I lose The game is ending soon Too attached to what I've found What I found in you.
