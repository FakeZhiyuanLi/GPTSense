      hm. lets see. this is the first time im doing this! there are so many crazes like frenster and stuff that i started cause evry1 else was doing it. but i didn't keep those up so lets see if i can keep this up. :D haha. a tough challenge this is.  its been such a hectic week. went to hosptial so many times. i think bout 4 times. haha. cause i got high blood pressure so trying to find the cause of it. hope its not too serious. 1st day we jus saw the doctor and had some ultra sound (no, im not pregnant) of my kidneys and bladder! the jelly stuff for lubrication was felt so weird and the doctor dug the thingy into me so hard i was sure i was gonna be bruised. but there was nothing :D 2nd day was for blood test. they had to poke both arms cause the nurse at the counter didn't see the request from the doctor for more test to be done on my blood! 3rd day which is today was to this get this machine that took my blood pressure every 15 mins. its quite irritating cause its quite painful when it squeezes and my hand goes numb and tingly at the same time. tomolo im going again to take off the machine. as result, i missed so many band practices felt so guilty.  band yesterday was fun. we played lotsa music and even music from lord of the rings! that was most fun. when we gonna go for band jog i told i had high blood pressure. and one of the seniors aaahhhhhhhhhhhhh! machine is squeezing me! phew over. i think my blood pressure has dropped a bit:D neway, where was i. o yes. the senior joked that if i had high blood pressure then he was a stroke victim. wasn't sure if i cud laugh so decided not to.  last night went to watch aa movie wif my dad. was quite a humerous action show called "breaking news". dun feel like doing a movie review tho so go watch it urself;D with ur gf or bf. haha. wish i cud watch a movie with the gal i like. haha. but i wont say who cause im scared she'll scold and shun me. so plz dun ask? ty.  kk i think that's bout it for now. i'll see if i can keep up but there are so many things going on around us in our busy lives and nxt week im going on holiday in kun ming.  o ya. i read in the newspaper bout students using 2 much sms language. as u can already c in dis blog dat i totally agree wif them. hahah. aaaaahhhhhhhh. the machines doing it again. dat means i've spent 15 mins here. haha
