        Well hello there!!! This is my first time with this and I tink that a lot of the stuff I'll write in here will be boring, but oh well. So well My sister got married yesterday and I'm so tired. This whole week I've been getting home like at 3 or 4 in the morning. Its so dumb that I have beeen doing that. Damn I knew that a wedding was a lot of work, but not as much as I did. It was way to much. Even though I'm complaining aboot that the wedding was good. The service went by pretty fast. I had to sing!! That was soooo nasty. I had fun at the reception. I got to hang out with my BUDDY Fez so that was pretty cool. Well I better be going. I missed No Doubt in concert cuz of the wedding.

       Well I haven't been wrtting in here cuz my comp is broke and its still getting fixed, and I really don't want to talk to people right now. Its been a really hard time for me, and things just keep getting bad. Like I haven't really been getting along with my mom and everyting thing like that. You know how it is, and it just sucks. She doesn't trust me for some odd reason. I've never done everything to make her not trust me and its really pissing me off. WEll all this stuff with my moom is making my vb game bad. Things at school aren't that great because of stupid ass Leeann. Oh and to top it all off Mr. Yim(my band di.) just quit and now we have no one to teach us. This reminds me so much of my freshmen and I don't like it a bit. Whats going to happen next one of the people that i care so much for are going to leave me or tell me that something is wrong with tme? Man I can't take this anymore.

       I really haven't been writing anything in here because I've been having a hard time with some stuff. I've been in this mood where I feel nothing can go right and nothing will get better. I've been treating people like crap too and thats so not cool. I want answers to my questions, but I know I can't ask them cuz they could mess upi something that I hold so dear to me. I've had this question in my head for some time. I've been telling myself in my head, should I ask it or leave it alone. It's been like that in my head for the last week. I don't know what it is. All I know is that I need to stop acting the way I am and move on. That's really the best thing right now. But it's not going to be easy for me to do. Oh well. I got to go now. I feel like making food for my family.
