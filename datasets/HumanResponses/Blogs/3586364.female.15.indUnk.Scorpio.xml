      The Story of an Hour is mainly about a woman whos husband dies.  She finds out and she goes to her room and she starts thinking about her husband and how she is a single woman.  She's finds out that she's a free woman and she doesn't have to answer to anyone any more.    This short story has inspired me not to depend on any man and that it's o.k. to be alone and on your own.  It tells me that maybe we're the strongest when, us ladies, don't have a man in our lives.  I really enjoyed this short story and if you're going through "man problems", I would encourage you to read this story, The Story of an Hour, by Kate Chopin.

If you need something that looks professional then you should definitely check out this article.  Plus, this artcile has good information about this short story.  http://galenet.galegroup.com/servlet/LitRC?locID=ksu&ADVST2=TI&srchtp=adv&c=1&stab=512&ASB2=AND&ADVSF2=Story+of+an+Hour&docNum=H1420007762&ADVSF1=Chopin&ADVST1=NA&bConts=3715&vrsn=3&ASB1=AND&ste=74&tbst=asrch&tab=2&n=10&ADVST3=NA:  I think that this is a good article because it has really good information in it.    http://galenet.galegroup.com/servlet/LitRC?locID=ksu&ADVST2=TI&srchtp=adv&c=6&stab=512&ASB2=AND&ADVSF2=The+Story+of+an+Hour&docNum=H1420056308&ADVSF1=Chopin%2C+Kate&ADVST1=NA&bConts=3715&vrsn=3&ASB1=AND&ste=74&tab=2&tbst=asrch&ADVST3=NA:  I really do love this article.  I believe this is a good article because it is something that a smart person can use.  I wouldn't recommend it to someone who is below middle school level, it has some hard words and it's definitely for older teens.  http://galenet.galegroup.com/servlet/LitRC?locID=ksu&ADVST2=TI&srchtp=adv&c=5&stab=512&ASB2=AND&ADVSF2=The+Story+of+an+Hour&docNum=H1420056302&ADVSF1=Chopin%2C+Kate&ADVST1=NA&bConts=3715&vrsn=3&ASB1=AND&ste=74&tab=2&tbst=asrch&ADVST3=NA:  This article mainly talks about the author and her succeeding.  It talks mostly about her and her comments about her novel.  I can see why this is important, so you can get to know the author and understand why she wrote this short story.  http://galenet.galegroup.com/servlet/LitRC?locID=ksu&ADVST2=TI&srchtp=adv&c=1&stab=512&ASB2=AND&ADVSF2=The+Story+of+an+Hour&docNum=H1420007762&ADVSF1=Chopin%2C+Kate&ADVST1=NA&bConts=3715&vrsn=3&ASB1=AND&ste=74&tab=2&tbst=asrch&ADVST3=NA:  This article, like the other, is mainly about the author and why she wrote this short story.  And about the critism that she took when she wrote this short story.  It's very important, because you need to know what the author went through to get to this point.

      http://www.wsu.edu:8080/~wldciv/world_civ_reader/world_civ_reader_2/chopin.html:  This site is good  because it allows you to know the author more and see how she wirites.  It gives you the a short recap of the author's life and it a little about the story.  It takes you into the mind of the author, while blending a good summary of the story.  http://www.vcu.edu/engweb/webtexts/hour/:  This website really just gives you a great summary of the short story.  I picked this website as a great toll to use because it really gets indepth with the story.  At this point you really don't need to read the story because this website totally does the reading for you.  I wouldn't go to this website unless you have already read this short story.  http://sources.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Story_of_an_Hour:  This website pretty much just has the story itself on the page.  I picked this one, because how are you going to know the story if you've never read the story.  So, I believe this should be the first link you check out before you hit up the other ones.  http://www.studyguide.org/story_of_an_hour_study_guide.htm:  This webpage is a study guide of the short story.  This allows a person to review themselves of this story.  It allows them to know if they have really read this story or not.  I would check out this study guide so I could make sure I understood what I read.  http://www.wiu.edu/users/mfwc/wiu/storyhour.html:  I really love this website.  This webpage has a list of why this feminist woman believes people should read this short story.  I like because I believe in women's rights and I believe that even if you haven't read this story that it will open your eyes and want you to read this short story.

      Yes, UB is almost over and it's almost time to start the summer for real.  I'm a little nervous, but I can't wait to go on vacation with my family, it's going to be lots of fun.  I'm sad that I have to move on with the relationships that are just starting to develope, sometimes UB is way too short. It's also time to move on with the boy that I still kind of like...life goes on and I feel that it's time to move on with mine.  That's just me, I don't continue to like a guy if he doesn't like me bck, I'm not a stalker...lol.  Plus, I really don't want to be in a relationship right now anyway.  I'm going on vacation and I feel like flirting and just having fun this summer...There's still a couple of hott dudes in UB, but it's too late to hook up with any of them...Life's too short to spend on one guy.  I'm too young and serious relationships are over-rated. -Essence

      The boy that I really really like is for one very sexy, but I hate when people list that as number one...well I just did that.  i think he has a very good personality and he always makes me laugh.  He's very truthful and honest, and I think honesty is, most of time, the best policy.  He's seriously amazing and I'm amazing so, an amazing girl needs an amazing boy.  I was googling on about him when my friend told me that she didn't want me to talk about him any more. I asked her why and she said that all I can do is be myself and if he doesn't like me for myself, then that's his problem. That's exactly what I'm going to be...myself, and I love myself.  -Essence

      This story is truly something that I believe I can write about, because it feels so poetic to me even though it's not written in poetry.  This story makes me want to read it and not put it down, it would have been great if the author would have made it longer with more details.  Maybe someone will expound on it in later years.  I really enjoyed it and was definitely a page turner.

      Hmm....hard thind to think about, what a father means to me?  A father is a man who is always there to listen to your problems and care about what's going on in your life. He's a man that will say he loves you just because.  My dad, even though we get in lots of arguments and we hardly ever see eye to eye, he's a good dad and I know he loves me.  It's not about saying that you love someone it's about proving it, it's what you do that matters.  My dad shows me that he loves me. When I need money he usually gives it to me, I never go hungry, I never don't have clothes on my back, he's a really good dad once I think about it.  I love him and maybe I need to show it a bit more. A father doesn't have to be biological, so if there's a man in your life that does all these things, he's your dad, and it's time to prove that you love him.

      I thought that this was truly elightning! I really quite enjoyed this short writing on this subject.  I'm really going to have to show my father.  It seems to me that this women is a femenist and so am I.  I think it's ok to show how many women are being treated in relationships and how many wives do have to do everything in the relationship, from taking care of the kids, keeping the house clean, having sex when she doesn't really feel like it, and still maintaining a job!!!  It's ridiculous everything that a women must go through as a wife and mother and I truly sympathisize with the author.  With me sympathisizing with her, I also know that one day I would love to be a wife and mother, but that doesn't mean that I want to be taken avantage of because I am caring and faithful.  I strongly believe that a wife and husband should split house-hold duuties as evenly as possible, it's only fair.  One day I do want to be a wife and mother, but I will make sure I'm not misused.

      Ok, so I want to go to college when I grow up, but who being born now, in there right mind, wouldn't want to.  I really have just started getting serious about what I want to go to college for and what I want to spend, hopefully, the rest of my life doing.  I really want to be a phychiatrist, I'm a black female who's really good in school, so I shouldn't have a problem getting scholarships and getting into college.  I just want to be successful, like everyone else.  College isn't for everyone, but I know college is for me.  -Essence
