      I finally got up the energy to pull out the cart and load my oversized laundry bag tightly packed with stale laundry inside to head to the Laundromat.  On a laid back weekend afternoon, I faced the decision of the day, which Laundromat to go to?  There's the one I love, that is about half-a-mile away, which always requires extra amounts of energy to go all the way down eight blocks and over two.  Then there is the place around the corner.  The closest Laundromat always seems to bring on the inner debate between proximity and quality of laundry.  It is only about 700 feet away from my apartment, but there are never any driers available and the staff doesn't seem to care all that much.   Unfortunately, on an afternoon where I have over a months worth of laundry, proximity wins and I pick the closest one.  One thing I do like about the place around the corner is that they have the top loading, washers like the one I had at home as a kid.  I always know how to use these, so I am usually more comfortable throwing my laundry in without the fear that the detergent won't release out of the hatch, or that I my laundry will stick to the upper wall of the chamber and I'll lose a sock.  I loaded three washers full of clothing, started them up and pulled out the needles and yarn that I had been using to knit a scarf.  About ten stitches in on a row, I hear someone say,   "Excuse me, why is the drier smoking?"  Immediately the man who notices the smoke stops the drier, grabs the clothes and leaves the door open. After a few moments of watching smoke pour out of the machine, everyone notices flames behind the drier wheel, like a coffee roaster, frying up any kind of lint kindling left in the basket. The exclamations coming from all the customers finally push the ladies who work there into action as they recognize the problem and run to grab the fire extinguisher.    We all walk outside to get out of the smoke, and the lady next to me says,   "That's what I get for being lazy."  I realize that others get sucked into what I like to call the law of the Closest Laundromat.  I am sure had either her or I taken the time and energy to walk to the next nearest Laundromat, this whole chain of events could have been avoided. But when it comes down to it, I would be willing to spare a couple of pairs of undies to the drier gods in order to save a walk downtown.  The manager comes in with the fire extinguisher and puts out the flames.  Then, as if nothing is wrong with the place, he comes out the front door and proclaims,  "No fire, nothing to worry about."  At this point I am standing on the sidewalk with my knitting in hand, when two fire trucks pull up to inspect.  Out come about six firemen, ready to remove the drier and all contents, threatening the chance that I'll get any laundry done today. I notice that about 10 feet away from me on the sidewalk, there are four people working on a PVC pipe track for a homemade camera dolly. I notice that they have the camera ready to go, and an actor, who up to this point I though was another neighborhood resident, waiting for his cue.  Assuming they are film students because of the small operation, I am surprised that throughout the entire chain of events with the firemen and the Laundromat, they work on their track, and prepare for the next shot of their film. I personally think that this would be a great scene to be written into the script.  Kids from the surrounding area are now standing on the sidewalk, ready to watch the Laundromat burn down.  They all notice the camera, and start yelling about being on TV.  I look around. There are two fire trucks, a film crew, about ten people waiting for their laundry, another fifteen who wandered downstairs to watch the action, and me standing with knitting in hand, all on the sidewalk around the corner from my apartment. I crack a smile at the thought of all the action taking place in my neighborhood, and for a moment I appreciate the Closest Laundromat for at least offering me this unique opportunity to see the people who surround me and live in this same crazy place.   All entertainment aside, I still took my clothing to the Next Closest Laundromat to dry.

      Two friends, walking on the Reservoir Path late at night, collars up and eyes forward, whispering wildly to each other about the serene beauty and stillness of this otherwise empty place.  Friends reminiscing about the lost wilderness adventures, looking towards finding nature in the city, without whirring engines or blinking lights, void of all unnatural sounds. The chosen destination of this midnight trip is expected to fulfill this want, as they wander closer to the core of the island, dipping in and out of lights and quickening the pace, trying to avoid any nosy park staff.  “Do you know we are the only two people on this island farther away from anybody else?” he asks. It really is an amazing thought when it sinks in. When you have two people with at least half a mile on either side to themselves in the middle of Manhattan, it really feels like you may be lying around on someone else’s backyard, not in the middle of the Great Lawn in Central Park.  Times Square seems so distant to the South, yet with the glow of billboards a reminder that we aren’t out of the jungle. Brightly lit high-rises serve as a mountainous backdrop and the grass, its original purpose fulfilled, cushions their backs as they settle in for some star-gazing.  This instance in Central Park solidifies to me what it is to live in New York. Learning the art of escape, understanding how to leave town without actually crossing a bridge, finding an organic moment in the midst of the strain that runs our daily lives.   Viewing what few constellations we can through the neon glow of the sky, my friend and I remember the days of pre-city, when stars were in great proportion to humans and natural phenomena were taken for granted.  I remember living for four years in Fort Collins, Colorado, minutes away from whitewater rafting, hiking, bike trails and peak climbs.  I had a chance to snowshoe in the winter, to trail run all year long and to backpack untouched backcountry paths, but all of that was put off for a later time, when I wasn’t studying for exams or partying with friends, basically when I wasn’t being a college student.  And now I’m in New York, having moved here shortly after college graduation, occasionally kicking myself for leaving, but making it a goal and a pleasure to find these organic moments everyday, smelling the sweet grass during a run around the park, listening to the East River lap the cement walls of the shoreline, looking up between buildings to see nothing but blue sky and blinding sunshine.  These are the moments that I don’t take for granted.  These are the moments that remind me that the earth and nature are still intact and that there is a reason I moved to New York.  I was told by a prospective employer, one of the six or seven I have had in recent months, that the city both drains your battery and recharges it at the same time. I know that mine drains when I’m walking on hot pavement, looking for a cheap bite to eat and maybe a nap, when I just want to head back to college, if just for a week or so, to appreciate the support of my parents and professors, and possibly squeeze in a backpacking trip. But this bitterness fades and I feel refreshed when I realize that I have made it through a summer in New York, with little money, no air conditioning, loud noises at night and some angry, tired people.  This recharges me, as well as those instances when two friends break the law and jump the fence to sneak onto the Great Lawn on a late summer night.  As my friend and I talk, we both forget what it is like to embrace silence, so conversation flows from one topic to the next. Most of what we talk about is highly irrelevant, but groundbreaking ideas and decisions are made during our time on the lawn. When a police cruiser passes by with a searchlight focused on the lawn, we lay flat face-down and still on the grass, giggling like children playing hide and seek with adults.  I feel protected and safe and at peace in my new home.  Now it’s 2a.m. and my friend and I have gotten our nature fix. We have managed to avoid humanity for a couple of hours and we have a replenished sense of clarity in our lives. Now it’s time to return to my apartment and sleep and start the next day again, seamlessly mending together the memories I make and remembering to record them so I will never forget life in New York.

      “Please, please, please,” squinting my eyes shut, head bowed and waiting for the Allmighty to say something.  “Please God, tell me what I need to do, tell me what I am doing here,” I pray quietly for about 10 seconds before my mind starts to wander. “Please God, just one little word, like a to-do list, that reminds me, my to-do list….”  This is the way praying has seem to have gone since my youth. I sit, I settle in and I start to praying, only to find that I can’t conjure up a mighty inspiration in the course of a few seconds.  As I like to see it, I listen to God, but I accidentally keep hanging up on him.  I have very little patience.  From my day job through everything else, I can never seem to find a clear focus in what I am doing. I am pretty sure that I will start writing this book and stop at about chapter .5 to head out on some other project.  Then I will justify my writing as a short story, and find some way to tie it off.  This is the way I do things, this is the way they always seem to get done.   I have half a set of cross-stitched placemats from 1989, now with a large circular rust stain where the cross-stitch hoop has sat for fourteen years.  You have to admit, for a young girl of 9 years, and not living in pioneer times, it is quite the project to cross-stitch your own placemats, but as the tape runs, I don’t have a knack for finishing things.  I live in New York City and work in Public Relations, a field in which you can often forget about a project and even never finish it, and always have some reason why it was never really important in the first place.  And that is what leads me to a point of concern in my young life, Do I want to work in a profession where you can talk your way out of doing something, simply because I can talk myself into thinking that it would be better off never happening.  Is PR the serial non-finishers dream?  I have always wanted to work in PR.  After my freshman year, when I decided that I would never be able complete an 8 year doctoral program in zoology, I decided that a four-year quicky with Journalism school would suit me just fine.  I like to talk, I like to convince people that they should be talking about what I am talking about, PR seemed like a perfect match. Crisis management? That would simply be like saving the reputation of a good friend after a bad night of partying.   So I graduated, in a frenzy, and moved to New York to pursue my “dream” as a PR maven in the big city. I do a lot of things in a frenzy.  The way I see it, we really have a limited span of time on this planet to make a big enough difference to matter, so I am trying to stuff in as much as possible.  This is why I stress myself out a lot.  I don’t see all that much time to write a novel, learn Italian, travel the world, pursue an acting and music career and get married, have three children, and care for a family.  What?!?  You can’t do that in an 80 year average life-span. I don’t have enough attention to write a memo, or to practice Italian and guitar everyday, allotting myself enough time to finish all of these things before I die, so how is this supposed to happen?  I have held through on the goal on running the marathon.  This is the first post-college project I have managed to finish within a 6-month period, other than finding a job and an apartment when I moved to New York.  But you have to do those when you move to New York.  Heading out for a morning jog from the homeless shelter would seem a little awkward and someone might get suspicious.    So this make me worry.  I worry that I need get a lot of stuff done in what feels like a limited time period, that is actually three more of my current lifetimes, which already seems like an eon, but wasn’t it just yesterday that I was in the marching band?  I have been at my job for over a year.  One month over a year.  One month short of being able to apply for a promotion, and therefore one month more bitter at the idea of starting my second year in the same position.  I told my boss it is like being the kid who starts the new school year and gets held back in the same grade.  Sure, now I get to be crossing guard, and I always get to take attendance, but who cares about the superficial appreciative gestures.  I want to deep stuff, the projects and the deadlines and the pressure and the glory that comes with skipping a grade.  Hand it over.  But I am average, horribly dreadfully, painfully average.  I went to get my fat percentage at the gym yesterday and I was 22.3 percent body fat.  When I checked the chart, it was told that I was average for a female.  I am also average height, weight, salary for a young professional and many a time I have been considered a handsome female, which screams average looking if you ask me.    How do I get past average and content in my life? I talk so often about doing these amazing things, and I freeze up any time I actually have to take the first step to get there.  Where do you start a search for the most amazing opportunities in the world?  I have no idea.

      In New York City, laundry is not only a chore, but an exercise in time management and patience.  Not to be too discouraged, one can also see laundry as an adventure in city living.   I sat at home an avoided the idea of taking three hours to sit in a laundry mat and wait for my laundry. I thought of possibly going in the middle of the night, when no one else is there, or seeing who might be there at 2 in the morning.  At the laundry mats you can find the most interesting people.  Once, I watched a man painstakingly pull each item out of his bag separately with rubber gloves on, Spray 'N' Wash each, and then place in the washer. It took him about 45 minutes to just prepare the load, let alone not even starting the washer.   Tonight though, I cannot even bring myself to think about laundry.  I came home around 6PM, and thought about having a little dinner and then  I would drag my sorry-ass four-wheeled cart (actually, my roommates sorry-ass cart, since my sorry-ass cart now only has two wheels after helping my boyfriend move to Staten Island) down seven blocks and over two to the 24-hour laundry mat that gives you one load for $1.00 and 10 minutes for a quarter, as opposed to the average New York price of one load for $1.25 and only 8 minutes for 25 cents.  It is worth the walk, when I am up to it, and the 24 hour openness helps to accommodate my procrastination habits.    Then Jeopardy comes on at 7PM, thus furthering the time I am going to sit around and NOT do laundry. AND it’s college week, which means it is even better to watch because I know all of the answers.  Then as I flip through the channels for one final look before I turn the TV off and head out to do laundry, I find a movie I like, starting right then.  Goners for laundry. That is the ultimate downfall of the New York City laundry experience is the risk of having so many other things that outweigh laundry on a scale of enjoyment. And so, I let it pile up, over THREE weeks of laundry, some that I will eventually end up washing in my bathtub since I run out of clean underwear at about the end of week two.  I am amazed that some of this stuff doesn’t grow legs.    It is only Monday though, so I will have the rest of the week to do laundry.  In between my day-job, my workout schedule, plans with friends and finding other things to do.

      "How many of you can sing all the songs playing on the ice rink from heart?"   From a branch two feet to the north I hear,  "It's not the music, it's the bells"   Those silver bells, like the ones in the famous Christmas carol, driving the electricians crazy in the middle of the Rockefeller Center Christmas tree. Stringing 30,000 Christmas lights over the course of a couple of weeks, and everyday, for twelve hours a day, hearing the bells of the Salvation Army clanging away. But the repetitive clang of the bells sets a tempo for the repetitive task of working nine hours a day sinching&nbsp;lightbulb covered&nbsp;wires to a tree branch with electrical wire. It is a job that comes with a lot of pride, being responsible for making the tree glow. But it is tough, and some of these guys have been doing this for longer than I have been alive. You ask some guys, and they have to count backwards in five-year increments to get to the beginning of it all.   The Rockefeller Center tree is a Christmas centerpiece that amazes those who know it, which in a day of television, internet and radio, means almost everyone. Hundreds of thousands of people from around the globe come to watch this inanimate object wrapped in electricity sit from December through January. They watch it on television, they see it in movies, they read about it in books.   And what a wonderfully big and beautiful tree it is. When you look at it objectively, the entire concept of the Christmas Tree is odd. It is an object that you hunt out and cut down to place in water and store in your house for anywhere from a week to a month. Some people put symbolic tokens on it, handmade Christmas crafts by tots and ornate, hand-blown antique glass bulbs, and some people just cover them in store bought crap. Whichever way you look at it though, each tree, from the 8-inch high singing tree on a trucker's dashboard, to the 79-foot Norway Spruce in Rock Center, brings at least a moment of joy into all hearts when put up for the first time each Christmas season.   This year, as part of my job as a PR assistant, I got to take photographers up in the tree for an inside glimpse of what happens when the scaffolding is up. Inside you see a whole microsociety of electricians, many of who you can't see from the street, straddling the main trunk, hugging branches as they reach for smaller branches that need a light. The wad of wires running vertical up through the trunk creates a vein of watts that runs as thick as a bodybuilders thigh straight to the top. Up there is a 21-point star that gets set into place shortly before the scaffolding comes off the tree. Every year they use the same star, with a fresh paint of gold over the solid metal sculpture. It is lifted into place via crane and tightened down over the top of the trunk of the mighty spruce.   I wonder if the electricians seeing their own tree at home for the first time, or seeing the annual lighting of the Rockefeller Center Christmas tree brings that tinge of joy every season. Do these guys go home and decorate their own tree? Do their children practice wrapping every branch on their tree in the living room with Twinkle lights? Do they decorate trees in their yards? It all makes me wonder.   This year my roommate and I decorated our first Christmas tree in New York City. We bought a three foot spruce from a place around the block and decorated it with all the pagan flattery that you can buy from the local CVS store. Our boyfriends joined us and helped to make ornaments while we all drank champagne and listened to the Martina McBride Christmas album. Writing about it now makes it sounds like a really bad Newport cigarettes commercial, but in all honesty it really was quite fun.   After we got it all decorated, we plugged in the lights and stepped back to look at our Christmas creation. And for the first time this season, I got that tinge of joy for the holiday, and my apartment felt a little more like my home as a kid.

      From what I can remember, Anne was one of the first people who greeted me as I got out of the car at camp that summer in 3rd grade.  The first thing I remember, was her shockingly blonde spikey hair, the next thing, how tall she was. Like other memories of camp throughout the years, like having to ride the smallest, yet most rambunctious horse, Peanut, to climbing up in the trees at the camp's ropes course, Anne was a lasting memory of my time spent there.  Looking back, we had a friendship that was based completely on a location, I never knew her outside of camp, I never knew what she did for work in the off season, or what her house was like, but she still managed to have such an impact on my life.    When I was 17, I took the job of Counselor-in-Training with her as my boss as camp director.  I remember her scolding me for not following orders and disobeying her directly, and like all the other senior staff, having to watch me like a hawk, since I was prone to listening to my hormones and, giddy with the prospect of being away from home, apt to get in lots of trouble.  I remember leaving that summer and feeling so ashamed that I had disappointed such an amazing person. Someone who I thought a mentor and an example, had to deal with my immaturity, and that hurt the most, more than any boy not asking me to dance, or getting caught for sneaking out.    I think that a few years later we saw each other when I was a counselor at the camp, and in the brief time that I said hello, a little of guilt lifted, maybe because I felt more mature, and maybe because I hoped that some of my disappointment in myself might have shown through. I might have shown that I grew up a bit.  Today I got the news that there was a memorial service planned for her in Denver, inviting all of us who knew her to attend.  The news was a complete shock and I couldn't help to think that she was one person I would have liked to have known better.  I would have at least liked the chance to tell her how stupid I felt as a teenager, and how I thought she was such a marvelous influence on me.  That regret makes me think more about living the right way, living the nice way, being good to others and remembering that the universe does not revolve around my experience only. It leaves me thinking that there are others who I do not want to let down.  I have made a lot of mistakes, and will make many more, but hopefully not because of my selfishness or lack of self-eteem or lack of any other quality that I should have as an adult.  Like morals, or genuiness, or grace.  Looking back, I want to remember Anne for other things too.  Like the end of my first session of camp when she gave me a Poof football, or when she introduced a group of us counselors to Chai shakes in the camp's industrial kitchen, what she used to call "Thanksgiving in a cup", or when she would sing camp songs in her raspy voice.  I'll always remember her in Tevas, a t-shirt and shorts, and in a smock dress for the family banquet at the end of camp.  She was always a memory of the ideals that camp encompassed and the ideals that I want to take with me.  She will be missed.

      I often have dream of sitting in a coffee house, sipping on my organic, lightly sweetened chai as I write my latest story and daydream about where my romantic freelance life may take me next. Of course my research is all done, and I have a pile of facts and well journaled stories that will eventually fall into place to create my next article, which should appear towards the front of that new magazine, you know, the new one that just came out last week. Seeing my previous work, those in charge insisted that I write in the premiere issue, knowing how respected I am in the freelance community.   Instead, I sit in my office chair and stare at the screen and curse myself for not paying attention in magazine writing class. I am desperately trying to figure out how one gains notoriety from freelance journalism, and how much work it actually takes to make a name for yourself.   I am looking into becoming a travel writer, but I hit the current blockade of not being able to travel because of my job as a PR assistant. Then I think about using my free time to work on my queries for publications like Vogue and Cosmo, only to realize that the ideas I have I don't necessarily want to research that hard, or frankly, don't make a big hell of a difference in the large scheme of things. And my free time consists of a two hour time span on Wednesday nights between 8-10 PM, in which time I am also knitting two scarves, reading the Da Vinci Code (like every other post-teen, business type who didn't pursue a more romantic job than they talked about in college) and cleaning my turtle tank (Would anyone be interested in a freelance article on Turtle care and tank maintenance?)   So, until I can solve my dilemma and reach the currently impossible dream of becoming a freelance writer, I would like to congratulate all of you out there who took the leap to go out on your own and create without the confines of a regular editor. Kudos, and if you have any advice, e-mail me. I will be sitting on my bed, brainstorming ideas for my illustrious freelance career-to-be and sipping instant coffee.

      It has been a cold winter in the city, and recently we got a taste of what spring might be like once we get over the final March blasts of cold weather and sleet. Unfortunately, after a lovely first week in March, we had a storm front of snot consistency wintery precipitation that reminded us that we are not done with this season yet.  The bleakness has been expected to hang over the city all week, creating my least favorite weather condition, cold and wet.   This morning though, I was pleasantly surprised to find a break in the disgusting weather and the sun peaking through my shades to wake me up.  I immediately got my running gear together and headed out the door for a quick jog before I had to go to work.   The sky was a magnificent water color of pale oranges, grays and blues, blending together with the sunlight and creating a glow to the city blocks that could only best be described as a storybook illustration, creating an ambiance of fantasy and warmth.  The soft angles of the shadows eased me into my rhythm as I set out through my neighborhood, then over to Central Park.   The park is always lovely, especially after a recent rain, when the sun returns to dry things out and create beautiful reflections on the puddles and in the windows of the buildings.  Overlooking East Harlem through the trees of the Great Hill on 107th Street, you could see the top of the buildings black and faceless, hard shapes against the soft glow of the hazy morning. The view seemed distant and unattached to what I normally see, carrying me deeper into my own thoughts than my usual to-do list for the day that I reel through my head over and over during the course of a run.      Alone in my thoughts, I wound back through the park, breathing in the dewy grass smell and feeling the dirt paths soft under my running shoes, thankful for the break in the weather that offered me a new view to the same old neighborhood as well as a new enjoyment to my same routine.

      Originally from Detroit, and having a degree from Colorado State University, the level of gossip&nbsp;in the print media&nbsp;that originates from each&nbsp;city is not even close to par with what I have read since I moved to New York. Here it is meatier, snarkier and cruder than any other columns out there in print. That being said, gossip columnists here also tend to be a wee bit more territorial.   For instance, if you had used the term,"Lane's&nbsp;spleen in a chaffing dish for Richard Johnson's dinner table" two years ago,&nbsp;I might have not sensed the urgency that the image&nbsp;now conjures up in my mind. Since joining the ranks of NYC publicists&nbsp;though,&nbsp;who daily inundate the gossip guru with nuggets of "exclusive" information, the reality&nbsp;of this&nbsp;actually happening is oddly believable.&nbsp;   Essentially the biggest problem arose from Richard not returning my e-mail or being available by phone, leaving me and my colleagues to assume that after a day of not hearing from him, the&nbsp;item that&nbsp;we had shared with him&nbsp;might not be as interesting as we thought. Taking a final stab at getting the item in print, we handed it to Daily News, who gladly accepted.   A few strings pulled and twenty minutes later&nbsp;the piece was on its way to making it into&nbsp;the pages of New York's second most read gossip&nbsp;column.&nbsp;Unfortunately, checking my e-mail an hour afterwards, I realized that&nbsp;it only took a few words to begin the nauseous downhill spiral that would lead to pins and needles and various electronic apologies over&nbsp;the next eight hours.   "Thanks. I'll use this."   -Richard Johnson   Feeling the tips of my feet go white, I sprinted to my colleagues office to tell her the news.&nbsp; Page Six would take it.&nbsp; Great! No!&nbsp; Not Great! Immediately we both realized that the piece on both pages could mean nuts for me (the chump who sent it)&nbsp;and ruin most of my reputation with all of the daily gossip pages in New York City.   The call was made to the Daily News.&nbsp; Pretty please, please don't run the piece, please for the love of God don't run the piece.   "Actually we really like it, so we are going to run it regardless."   -Daily News   Normally, one might assume that two hits are better then one, like in batting practice or darts, but in this case, this flippant disregard for my professional&nbsp;reputation&nbsp;left me with my head between my knees as I realized that it had to be done. After conferring with senior staff, the decision was made, I would make the fateful call to RJ myself. Lump in my throat, I&nbsp;spoke the warbly message into the receiver,   "Thank you for your consideration of the item I sent you earlier. We are happy that you are interested in using it, unfortunately it seems that the Daily News is also interested in the piece. When we did not hear from you a day after we sent you the item, we assumed that you were not interested.&nbsp; I&nbsp;am incredibly sorry for the double booking. If you have any questions, please give me a call at...."   You know when you are trying to get bad news out fast that you can't remember what you said?&nbsp; That actually happened, and the quote above is merely a representation of what I thought&nbsp;was said.&nbsp; Regardless,&nbsp;I hung up and let out a long, painful sigh, realizing that I had just told the top gossip monger in the U.S. that&nbsp;I had&nbsp;given the same item to&nbsp;his biggest competitor, like double booking the corner booth at&nbsp;Sizzler on a Saturday night. Although more&nbsp;refined than the actual&nbsp;patrons that dine at Sizzler, gossip columnist&nbsp;are known to be&nbsp;more ravenous and less concerned about blood stains on their ties.&nbsp;   Knowing that there was nothing left to do, I headed home to await my fate, expecting a scathing phone call and a slap on the wrist in as soon as three hours.   Nothing happened that night. Nothing happened when I came into work the next morning.&nbsp; The item ran on both pages, and on the web site for the Post.&nbsp; No one called. No one yelled, and everyone knew that the other one knew it too.&nbsp; I was in the clear.&nbsp; Back pats were exchanged, thanks made&nbsp;to the staff that helped me through it all, and a little celebration for my incredible&nbsp;feat, although everything did not seem right. I cautiously went about my morning, not believing that this snafu was all over. Around 11AM the e-mail came in that I was expecting.   "Please explain to me why this is also&nbsp;in the Daily News today."   -Richard Johnson   I toddled into my boss's office.&nbsp; I recited the line, burned into my eyeballs. We worked up the following response.   "Unfortunately, it appears that you did not get the voicemail I left you yesterday evening about this.&nbsp; I left you a message explaining that, since we had not heard back from you a day after we sent the item, we were under the impression you were not interested.&nbsp; Therefore, we sent it to the DAILY NEWS for consideration.&nbsp; After hearing the good news from you yesterday afternoon, which we were thrilled about, we alerted the NEWS in an effort to pull the piece.&nbsp; They decided to run it regardless.&nbsp; As soon as I learned that, I called you and left a voicemail explaining the situation.&nbsp; I also called the City Desk to try and reach you, but was sent to your voicemail.&nbsp; I'm terribly, terribly sorry about this."   -Me   Note the second "terriby". My boss put that one in, while I was considering the alternate&nbsp;phrase "First&nbsp;child negotiable" as the&nbsp;signature line.&nbsp;   I sent it out and&nbsp;waited.&nbsp; Over the next hour or so, I got absolutely no work done, but went to get about six cups of water and took a pee break before the response came back to me.&nbsp; My stomach was reverberating to the beat of my heart as I clicked open the message:   &nbsp;  "stuff happens."   -Richard Johnson   &nbsp;  The deflated response left me to analyze it.&nbsp; Was this "stuff happens" the same as, "shit happens, and you are shit, and your piece is shit,&nbsp;and I'm not a toilet, so keep your shit away from&nbsp;me from now on," or was it more like "stuff happens&nbsp;man, no big whoop.&nbsp; Whatever."?&nbsp;I teetered back into my boss's office. She calmed me down, we took a few deep breaths,&nbsp;I realized that my organs were all still intact, and I thanked the heavens for my little publicist blessing.&nbsp;   I have never heard from Richard again, although I fear he thinks of me often.&nbsp; I won't try to reach him again until we have had a little more time to recuperate from the ordeal. And from now on, I solemnly promise to keep my gossip items between me and him until I know that he's not interested. Honest.

      Only four days before the official beginning of summer, and I am wearing pants and a long sleeve shirt as I sit in an air conditioned office under artificial light and stare at my computer.  This is not natural, nor could it ever be natural, unless I had windows that I could open and/or grass under my feet. In any case, I have made it my goal this summer to work outside of the office as much as humanly possible, in order to maintain my sanity and a skin tone that resembles more of a blush instead of an ivory.    Unfortunately, my laptop is busted. And most office-bound New Yorkers must know that unless you have a Crackberry strapped to your waist or your trendy laptop messenger bag slung over your shoulder, working in the great outdoors in nearly impossible.   I have already cranked the AC in my apartment up to high, even though the start of this summer has not been half as hot at the summer of 2002, in which I had no air conditioner and no full-time job, but I made it through just fine.  What the hell happened!?!  The daily iced coffees and skipping lunches to make phone calls has weakened my spirit as well as my endurance for city life. I actually find myself complaining about the weather, even though three-quarters of my days are spent inside. Why even care if it is raining bats if half the time I can't even see it?   So, to alleviate some anxiety that I am feeling, and to waist some time at work, and maybe even to use for future reference, I am recording a list of things I NEED to do this summer, if not only for my sanity and the safety of those around me.   1. Take a long weekend at the Jersey shore, and earn my keep by helping my sister-in-laws parents around their beach house... 2. Go home to Michigan to visit the family and cruise around town with my old girlfriends like a teenager, looking for highschool crushes and sleeping in my OWN bed at my parents house.... 3. Head upstate for a couple of weekends, including other states, like Vermont, Maine, etc., to get a little fresh air and stretch the old airbags for a few days 4. Take a work day off in the middle of the week to sit in the park ALL DAY LONG in a bikini and cowboy hat, reading the newspaper and sleeping.... 5.  Take a long weekend to head to Washington D.C. to see the nation's capitol and visit cousins and take a turn babysitting their two adorable kids 6. Head to Colorado for Labor Day weekend to attend an event at my old summer camp and hang out in the trees at the ropes course. 7. Go to Newport for a long weekend with one of my oldest friends, as we pay way to much to go to the bars and scope guys who are definitely not my type, but fun to make fun of... 8. Head to the Cloisters, the Bronx Zoo, the Brooklyn Botanical Gardens and the Whitney museum all before Labor Day weekend.   Long live the summer!!!

      Ironically enough, this morning I had seen in the paper the picture of Lance Armstrong holding up his&nbsp;two hands with six fingers in the air&nbsp;to signify his&nbsp;latest win&nbsp;of the Tour&nbsp;de France.&nbsp; Now I&nbsp;am sitting with an ex-boyfriend and college sweetheart turned (supposedly)&nbsp;close friend over as he&nbsp;holds up the number of fingers of women he'd slept with&nbsp;over the duration of our&nbsp;three year relationship.&nbsp; The number is not exact, he has a hard time&nbsp;narrowing it&nbsp;down between&nbsp;four and seven, but in the end, he&nbsp;averages the count to&nbsp;five.   The women range from his hair stylist at Cost Cutters, to a random girl he met at a bar, to&nbsp;an old highschool friend.&nbsp; He&nbsp;says to me that he wants to be perfectly honest,&nbsp;like we have been since we broke up three months ago (like we "were" to each other when we were dating?)&nbsp;. During our first&nbsp;round of beers this evening we were talking&nbsp;about new people who we&nbsp;are dating right now.&nbsp; While I have danced around the possibility of dating this new guy I have seen a few times, he has already bedded down with&nbsp;an overweight, &nbsp;accountant with a thyroid condition from Brooklyn.&nbsp;   He wants to be honest because he cares.&nbsp; And because he didn't have the cajones during our courtship to just let me go in peace.&nbsp; In the most selfish act imaginable, he left me to think that he was the only one for me, left me to feel that he really cared for me,&nbsp;while on his own time he sabotaged what could have been an amazing, long lasting bond.&nbsp;   He followed me to New York City and spent countless hours letting me know how much he let go to be with me there. Leaving his friends and family to follow the woman he loves, talking about marriage someday, but never committing to anything, since he couldn't commit to me.&nbsp; Writing me love poems, that&nbsp;could&nbsp;be written to anyone,&nbsp;showering me with&nbsp;kisses from the same lips that he used for some other girl and&nbsp;phone conversations ending in tears for me, then my guess, a blow job for him, as he turned to another woman to&nbsp;please himself.&nbsp;   He&nbsp;tells me that he is not good for me, that he is&nbsp;scum, &nbsp;and that&nbsp;he&nbsp;wants me to know this now because he doesn't deserve to get me back at any time in the future.&nbsp; He only has the ability to say this after&nbsp;being broken up for three months, after&nbsp;he took home more women than the&nbsp;offensive lineup&nbsp;of a powderpuff football team,&nbsp;after I had the strength to let him go first and realize after three, long, years that he was not right&nbsp;for me, then, he found the power within to let me know that he is not a good person. I am so happy we got this out in the open.   He is telling me that these women meant&nbsp;nothing, and&nbsp;then uses the silliest cliche, like what you might find in the 1980's condom&nbsp;public service announcements, telling me he&nbsp;thought with the wrong head a lot. Like&nbsp;when I was traveling with my college ski team, only a few&nbsp;months after we started dating.&nbsp; Or, in a most shocking reveal,&nbsp; when he took a&nbsp;woman&nbsp;home to his place in Staten Island&nbsp;the night before my first New York City marathon, as I&nbsp;laid in my&nbsp;bed, full of jitters before the big event.   Looking at this now, everything is incredibly clear to me.&nbsp; This guy has shitty luck, and when you hear these stories, it immediately&nbsp;transforms into what can be defined as Karma, coming back to bite him in the ass for his outrageous&nbsp;behavior.&nbsp; He told me after we broke up how&nbsp;his back had started bothering him, and how he was unable to find a job (like that was a&nbsp;new development) and how he&nbsp;couldn't move out of his crummy apartment in Staten Island because his writing for a small paper wasn't being paid for.&nbsp;And I felt really bad for him, considering that in that time since I&nbsp;have gotten a promotion at work, a raise, and am looking damn fine in a short skirt. I was wasting all of these emotions on something that didn't match up.&nbsp;   Throughout the initial shock of realizing that I have been cheated on, repeatedly, throughout even&nbsp;the strongest times in our relationship, and with the most heinous women, I &nbsp;am actually quite happy for the realization that&nbsp;this confession has offered me.&nbsp;Because it makes me worry less about him as a person, and more about him as a mental case, like I would care for a beleaguered homeless man on the street. No longer do I have to treat him like a wounded woodchuck half-runover&nbsp;on the shoulder of the highway, trying my best to wish he could walk on his&nbsp;own, nursing him along to becoming a better living being, with a six figure income, a six pack and and some half-decent cooking skills.&nbsp; Now I&nbsp;can stop blaming his lack of effort, or&nbsp;his parents for their poor rearing.&nbsp;&nbsp;Now I can understand that crappy things happen to crappy people, and I can visualize him so much&nbsp; more easily now as a pathetic head case,&nbsp;and&nbsp;not really like a functioning member&nbsp;of the&nbsp;society I live in.   So in&nbsp;the best way possible at the moment, and being someone who will be followed along by good Karma for my&nbsp;actions, I have given him the forgiveness that he so desperately does not want from me. I have not freaked out on him and crumpled on the sidewalk as we stroll through the&nbsp;streets back to the train station. In fact, I&nbsp;thank him for the heartache that&nbsp;makes&nbsp;life interesting, and since I have had a good life, a little drama is always in need to give you, what my college theatre professor used to call, "Treadmarks on the soul." I also thank him for giving me the reason to not kid myself about us getting back together, or pining over him while I&nbsp;search for&nbsp;an attractive guy to take me out.&nbsp; I keep on giving, because I know in this way, it kills him to see me take it so well. I think in a way&nbsp;he would like to see me sucker punch him, or call all of my friends to beat some sense into him.&nbsp; He&nbsp;wants the anger to come out in me so that he can release a little bit of that guilt he is feeling,&nbsp;to release the pressure he is feeling in his soul.&nbsp; But I won't let that happen, because guilt is much better revenge than heartache. And he will need all of the friends he can get when those ghosts start to haunt him.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   I think about Lance again in the end of all this, conquering his own demons within to overcome the challenges that life has thrown him, and excelling to boot. With that, I think that maybe I should be holding up the five fingers instead of my ex-boyfriend, overcoming the ideas of these five voluptuous demons that tempted away the man I used to love, not altering my reality in any way and showing me the strength that I posses.&nbsp; Beat that.   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;    &nbsp;
