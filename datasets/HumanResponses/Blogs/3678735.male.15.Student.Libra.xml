      - Haiyxz -  Sometimes.. i wished for a different identity..  Sometimes.. i admires another person.. It could be you.. The one reading this now.. You would never know.. How much i wished to be you..  My life is full of ups and downs.. Often i thought.. It always should resembles the life of a normal one.. But things don always go in my way.. Again.. Thats another resemblance..  Many things happen in a day.. For which.. many i hoped never happens.. I never expect any consequence.. That leads to violence..  Friends are like footprints.. Many people walk in and out of your life.. But only friends leaves footprints in your life.. They could be an agony.. However only sometimes.. Moreover often many times..  I feel like giving an advice.. But your character seems like stubborn of a kind.. You insist on what you wants.. I could only forgive what you have done.. What a friend.. Having a friend is always better than having an enemy.. Remember..  You too...

      The Reason by Hoobastank  I'm not a perfect person As many things I wish I didn't do But I continue learning I never meant to do those things to you And so I have to say before I go That I just want you to know  I've found a reason for me To change who I used to be A reason to start over new and the reason is you  I'm sorry that I hurt you It's something I must live with everyday And all the pain I put you through I wish that I could take it all away And be the one who catches all your tears Thats why i need you to hear  I've found a resaon for me To change who I used to be A reason to start over new and the reason is You [x4]  I'm not a perfect person I never meant to do those things to you And so I have to say before I go That I just want you to know  I've found a reason for me To change who I used to be A reason to start over new and the reason is you  I've found a reason to show A side of me you didn't know A reason for all that I do And the reason is you

      Accidentally In love by Counting Crows  So she said what's the problem baby  What's the problem I don't know  Well maybe I'm in love (love)  Think about it every time  I think about it  Can't stop thinking 'bout it   How much longer will it take to cure this  Just to cure it cause I can't ignore it if it's love (love)  Makes me wanna turn around and face me but I don't know nothing 'bout love   Come on, come on  Turn a little faster  Come on, come on  The world will follow after  Come on, come on  Cause everybody's after love   So I said I'm a snowball running  Running down into the spring that's coming all this love  Melting under blue skies  Belting out sunlight  Shimmering love   Well baby I surrender  To the strawberry ice cream  Never ever end of all this love  Well I didn't mean to do it  But there's no escaping your love   These lines of lightning  Mean we're never alone,  Never alone, no, no   Come on, Come on  Move a little closer  Come on, Come on  I want to hear you whisper  Come on, Come on  Settle down inside my love   Come on, come on  Jump a little higher  Come on, come on  If you feel a little lighter  Come on, come on  We were once  Upon a time in love   We're accidentally in love  Accidentally in love (x7)   Accidentally   I'm In Love, I'm in Love,  I'm in Love, I'm in Love,  I'm in Love, I'm in Love,  Accidentally (X 2)   Come on, come on  Spin a little tighter  Come on, come on  And the world's a little brighter  Come on, come on  Just get yourself inside her   Love ...I'm in love
