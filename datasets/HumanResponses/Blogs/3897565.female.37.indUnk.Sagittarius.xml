       We used to talk   We used to laugh   We were best of friends   I thought that’s how it would always be   You taught me so much   Told me exactly what to say   I wish it were still the same   But someday I know it will   Maybe not today   But we’ll meet up again   It won’t be long until I see your face   Above the stars one&nbsp;day     &nbsp;  RIP my Darling :(

       He's an incredibly understanding guy!    &nbsp;  I'd had a long-standing appointment with him a&nbsp;couple of months&nbsp;ago to touch up my current tatts and discuss the designs for a couple of other planned ones, which I failed to attend due to being unable to go out, even across the road, so he called me up to re-arrange it, but due to his popularity and busy schedule it couldn't be arranged for several weeks.     &nbsp;  Well, today was the day, and as usual I'd forgotten all about it! Well, John called me first thing this morning and left a message to remind me that my appt was at 11am, first appt of the day. I called him back and told him about my current difficulties in leaving my flat alone ...&nbsp;even though he's just across the road! ... and he was absolutely wonderful!    &nbsp;  He called round to get me before opening the shop, and even walked me up to the cash machine so I could get some cash, although he didn't actually charge me for today's work! He&nbsp;also left the closed sign on the door so no one else would come in while I was there.    &nbsp;  I was very apprehensive due to the visibly recent SH, but he never commented on it while working on my tatts. Out of respect for his excellent artwork,&nbsp;plus the fact he's&nbsp;put in so much effort&nbsp;in the past to cover old scars, I hadn't actually marked any of them, despite coming very close.    &nbsp;  I got  the  bollocking when it was all finished though! Not in a bad way, as he is very understanding about MH issues, and he was suitably impressed that I hadn't actually defaced any of his work. I even joked about getting my whole body tattooed if it would deter me from SH'ing again LOL!    &nbsp;  He told me about his wife having agoraphobia and PA's in social situations, and how she'd cured them with hynotherapy (several years ago now) on the advice of her GP,&nbsp;which was&nbsp;provided on the NHS. The hypnotherapist even went to her home as she couldn't bear to go out at that point. She only needed one session and has never looked back since!     &nbsp;  John is now on a mission to get me out of my flat more frequently, so rather than go through the new designs today, he is going to come and get me, when he has a quiet moment, to discuss&nbsp;them&nbsp;over the next couple of weeks. He is also going to space out the work in short bursts to ensure I get out as much as possible, rather than just sit in the chair for several hours in one go!    &nbsp;  He's even threatened to come and get me to make the coffee on a morning, for him and&nbsp;his clients, as long as I feel comfortable being there!    &nbsp;  He's a complete git for doing this to me, but&nbsp;I can see why, and I know it's just cos he cares. He'd guessed I was ill again, as he hadn't seen me around,&nbsp;but hadn't realised just how bad until today :-(

       I had a rather pleasant awakening on Sunday afternoon by a couple of friends from "Oop Norf" who were in the area, so called in to see me. To be honest I'd completely forgotten they were coming as it had been arranged weeks ago for them to collect a couple of baby snakes from me, as well as having our annual get together.    &nbsp;  They are a lovely couple and Cathy was the one who arranged to have loads of flowers/cards etc sent to me last summer when I was going through a particularly bad crisis. She's one special woman!     &nbsp;  Unfortunately it all went too fast, but at least I had a few hours of human interaction, which I thoroughly enjoyed, although I think I probably bored Allen to death with my incessant chatter while Cathy was dozing after her long drive.    &nbsp;  I guess that's the problem with not seeing people for weeks on end :(    &nbsp;  If you ever get to read this Cathy ... thank you  so  much for the few hours you brightened my existence, and please apologise to Allen for me, for&nbsp;boring him to death! And Jack is a lovely lad, so much like my Ryan ...&nbsp;it was good to have him around for a while :)    &nbsp;  I hope the snakes are settling in ok!

        What a palaver!     &nbsp;    A quote from their website:      &nbsp;   Customer Service    - No other carrier provides an earlier average delivery time for next day consignments, or a later cut-off time for requesting same day collections on a national basis.    - The majority of deliveries are completed before 1pm     &nbsp;    My experience:      &nbsp;   I placed an order with a reptile supplies company for livefood, frozen food and non-perishable goods last Wednesday, which were despatched for Next Day Delivery on Thursday. Bearing in mind that frozen goods are highly perishable and can only sustain a maximum of 24hrs in transit if packed sufficiently with dry ice.     &nbsp;   I waited all day for delivery on Friday but it never arrived. I couldn't call anyone due to the phone being on incoming calls only, so didn't know if there had been a problem with my order and it hadn't been dispatched, or whether the problem lay with the couriers.     &nbsp;   I finally get my phone service back on Monday, so called the reptile supplier who confirmed the order had gone out on Thursday evening and I should have received it before 12pm Friday. Both I, and the reptile suppliers spent several hours trying to contact Amtrak, but they weren't answering their phones. I eventually get an email back from the reptile supplier, who had finally managed to make contact with them, and apparently my order was en route on Monday ... what use is that with frozen goods on board since Thursday!!! ... that the van had broken down and was in the garage but they would try and get to me at some point that evening!     &nbsp;   No delivery arrived.     &nbsp;   A new batch of frozen food was sent out Monday evening, as it was obvious the original lot wouldn't be fit to use, and that arrived on time this morning, albeit with a damaged container, meaning the mice had started to thaw out prematurely, but I just bunged them in the freezer anyway and fingers crossed they'll be ok.     &nbsp;   In the mean time I'm still waiting on my original order! The box containing the non-perishable goods turned up an hour after the frozen delivery ... same van/driver ... he couldn't find the parcel the first time around!     &nbsp;   So I'm left waiting for the live insects and the "frozen food" from 6 days ago!     &nbsp;   Numerous emails to the customer services department, and phone calls&nbsp;to my local depot went unanswered, until I finally receive an email telling me to expect one package by taxi some time this evening, and&nbsp;the remaining&nbsp;parcel had been destroyed as it was unfit for delivery ... obviously the "frozen" mice!     &nbsp;   The livefood turned up an hour ago by taxi, the majority having perished during the 6 day journey, and I have not been offered one word of apology or an explanation from Amtrak over their horrendous service.     &nbsp;   I'll never use them again, but that was the only place I could obtain the supplies I needed online, so fuck knows what I'll do now.     &nbsp;   Time to sell all my reptiles I guess :(

       I don't know how much longer I can exist like this, cos that's all I'm doing right now ... existing.    &nbsp;  Much of the night was spent lurching from one panic attack to another, with the odd spot of calmness and a small amount of snatched sleep, only to be disturbed by horrific nightmares :-(    &nbsp;  Much of the day has been the same, and with added anxiety, as I lay in hope of  someone ... anyone ... &nbsp;calling round or even phoning. Even if I couldn't manage to answer it at least I'd know someone cared enough to try and contact me ... but nothing.    &nbsp;  No one would even know if I slipped quietly away off the face of the earth. No one would care.

       I've finally had confirmation that my presence in my only online support network is no longer required.   To be honest it comes as no surprise as people have been pushing me out for some time now. Doesn't make it hurt any the less tho. In fact it has totally destroyed any last remnant of faith I had left in humankind.   This was supposed to be a  support  place, somewhere I've been a part of for almost 5 years, but it's now at an end.   I've nowhere left to go from here.

       I write a short, non-important post and it gets published immediately.   I give up.

       My last hour long post got ate up in some malfunction of the system, so here I am again.   I can't even remember what I said now.   Lesson #1 ... copy to notepad everything you write before clicking publish.   The words I wrote can never be re-created in a true sense, as they came straight from the heart.   Just one more thing in a long catalogue of problems to plague me recently :-(

       I'm in pain but offered no pain relief ... surprise, surprise :-(   I have no credit on my phone to call/text anyone, not that there's many people left I can do that to anyway.   Why didn't they just leave me to die???????

       Well, they've cut out the offending bits from both my groin and breasts.   I now await results from the pathology labs :-(   I was scheduled for a 2 day stay but my PA's got in the way of that. Seems the pdocs got there before me and refused a prescription of Lorazepam for me, even while in hospital, which they were quite willing to prescribe last year while in hospital with my broken ankle.   So all you poor bastards are stuck with me until whenever :(

       This is my last posting of the day as I await my transport to hospital.   Just had an impromptu call from my CPN which has totally thrown me. Does he  really  care or is he duty bound to make sure I stay alive???   I don't know what to think anymore. Somehow it doesn't make a difference. He's not allowed to give me a hug or show me any form of compassion cos it's his "job".   I'm still as lonely as ever and will face this alone, and face the recovery alone.

         Wisdom beyond her years  Childhood, stolen  Mark of the unwanted  Resemblence on her heart  Soul longing to escape  run away, as fast as she can  get away, for just a time  Jump back into life  her own outlandish reality  Start all over   Quiet Whispers  not a one for counsel  a dying angel, all alone  heart is pounding  one beat, then two  slowly ceasing  eyelids caressing one another  lashes entangled  single tear, slipping through  begining of eternal silent slumber   Don't awaken her  a dying angel  let her rest  ease exhaustion  don't interupt  this unending sleep.

       People talk of loneliness, but I wonder how many know just what it feels to be  really  lonely.   Lonely as in not having another human being to talk to for days, or even weeks, on end. Not having any physical contact with another human being, not even a hug or touch of hand.   Yes, you can feel lonely even with people around you ... I know that one too ... but true loneliness is having  no-one .   The internet is useful to communicate, but it can't give you that human touch, no matter how hard people try.   I'm lonely.

       I face my operation tomorrow morning and I'm dreading it. Or am I? I could die under the anaesthetic I suppose ... wishful thinking!   Just my luck I'll recover though, and to what ... months of more treatment just to prevent me from dying!!! ... doesn't make sense does it.
