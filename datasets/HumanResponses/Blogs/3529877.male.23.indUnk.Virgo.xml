      The most surreal Sunday ever - played 3 sets with 2 different bands today, both outside. It absolutely pissed with rain. I mean, God opened his bladder and fucking slashed his load all over us. We were under (a very small and technically inadequte) cover so all the power leads and stuff got drenched (thank fuck for plastic coating!), but the show had to go on! It's very strange playing in the middle of a hail storm, and there were actually people standing under umbreallas watching us (bless em!) But, we got paid, my pedal board got broken by a clumsy singer (bloody divas!) and we went down really well, so there you go. Not all bad. Oh and SANDWICH OF THE DAY  -  sausage and ketchup from the BBQ when it wasn't raining. Very tasty.

      How can someone work their arses off and come out the other end with a pathetic pay cheque? And why is it that all the shit falls on your head at the same time? Not only did I get my piss poor months pay (how I'm supposed to live on such a paltry amount confounds me) but then I got my tax bill (cos I do self employed stuff too)  and  my accountants bill at the same time. Add to this a cancelled gig this weekend which was going to basically buy me some food for a few weeks, mix it around til it isn't even funny anymore, and you have a whole world of shit. Yeah, yeah, yeah, there's always someone worse off etc, but right now, if you don't mind, I need to worry about me. Sorry if that sounds selfish, but bollocks to it. I'm fed up of trying to please other people the whole fucking time, and I'm sure a few people who may read this have noticed that I've probably been a bit more.... balshy the last couple of days, and I'm sorry about that. Anyway, I do charity work so I'm not all bad!! So, upcoming considerations....payment of studio recording (probably about Â£500 per band member), the obvious things like rent, bills, any speeding fines that will probably bite me in the arse when I least need them to....and you have a very shitty summer indeed. Much like every year then.  Plus, I've decided that my job is shit. I'm fucking sick of the inept admin people who seem to exist just to make my life difficult, and I'm sick of teaching kids who basically don't give a fuck and just want to play guitar cos its the latest cool thing. Don't get me wrong I have some very cool and dedicated students, but the majority are a pain in the arse. I would say the money is good (the hourly rate is very good) but I don't seem to be earning anything...hmmm....so basically, I'm at a bit of crossroads. Ditch job, live on the breadline for a bit earning enough to get by and work on the bands - or is that putting al my eggs in one basket? Or do I get a full time job with no flexibility, have no time for the bands but have loads of money and very boring life?   The money does sound tempting....

      There was a man called Klaus Who sat in his house Listening to Strauss Dousing his house in Famous Grouse Cos his tiny pet mouse Had pyromaniac tendencies and he had carelessly left a box of matches on the side. And a louse in a blouse and new pair of trous(ers) Ran off to call the fire brigade.

      Well, that ws the oddest day I've had for a while. Woke up with a splitting headache, and toothache (I think I have a wisdom tooth coming through - the little bastards making his prescence known. No wonder babies make such a fuss when they're teething, it's bloody painful!), went to work as usual, feeling shit. Didn't eat anything all day, so unsurprisingly felt worse by the time 6:30 rolled round, and I went straight from work to play bass for 500 people, for a grand total of 2 songs (I play in a band of blind guys, who are all fucking awesome, perfect pitch, the lot of em and their RNIB college was a doing a show at the local theatre - which my ever talented sister was Musical Director for, gosh, I'm so proud!), came off stage, went and cast my vote in the European and Local elections, then went down the pub. Now, the pub thing is normal, but the playing bass for 500 people and voting in an election aren't, so I'm feeling a little spacy. It doesn't take much. So, to freak me out a bit more, I watched Derren Brown on C4. Christ, that guy is a fucking genius, he never ceases to amaze me. So tomorrow, I'm gonna do sweet fuck all, except maybe catch up on the sleep I've been missing for the last few days. Wake me up in time for Euro 04.    Sorry, I sounded like a bit of a lad there. Ooops.

      You know that bit at the end of the Blair Witch Project where they hear Josh shouting, but they don't know where he is, so they're trying to find him...? It sounded lke that round the back of our house tonight - there's some woods that backs on to the neighbours garden and there was all kinds of bellowing and shouting going on. Then it all went very quiet.... I wonder if there are any disused cottages in the woods over there. Hmmm.....

      God I hate sunburn. It's not too painful right now, but my forehead and arms are pretty damn sore. We spent hte day in Brighton, wandering around looking for suitable locations for this photo shoot. It went pretty well, but I guess its hard to tell til you see the finished print. But I have to say, I've never taken my shirt off in a pub before (I've been missing out, it was strangely liberating) and I've never seen anyone change their trousers in the middle of a pub either (the culprit will remain nameless.) Maybe I've just led a very sheltered life. So that was nice. Spending more money that I don't actually have (but the good people at Mint are loving me). Bollocks.   Now where's my aloe vera......

      Another Saturday night, another end of the week. Yes I'm pissed, but I'm typing very slowly so that I dont look like I am. Cunning.  So I went to the pub, and it was one of those pubs where you bump into just about every person you've ever had contact with - your accountant (cos I have one of them, how posh am I?! Actually, its more to do with not wanting to completely fuck up my tax return...), the bloke who taught you your first swear word, the guy who used to kick you up the arse when you walked home from school, the midwife who delivered you and welcomed you into this cess pit, etc etc... It's all good fun, as long as there's beer involved. And there was.  There was also a guy trying to haggle with me - bascially trying to get me to teach him guitar for free...sorry mate thats not gonna happen! Its my job, is how I make money, so i want paying dammit!! You wouldn't ask a plumber to come round, fix your boiler, then not pay him would you. No, you fucking wouldn't!! So, you know, I'm sharing my "wisdom" here, and I want some fucking cash for it!! End of story! Call me a heartless capitalist or whatever, but what do you want to survive on? Thin air? My lust for life? Sorry, but I think I'd be at deaths door pretty soon if that's what I had to rely on! So anyway, tomorrow, we got a photoshoot for BTP. We're going to Brighton (not sure why but there you go), and we'll probably end up standing around on the beach or in the lanes, looking moody and famous. And wet too, knowing the British weather. So that'll be nice, we get to feel like lemons for a few hours, but we'll have some good shots at the end. Rock n Roll eh.  Yes, rock n roll.

      So it was a warm night so I left my bedroom window open when I eventually went to bed. Remind me to never do that again - the bloody kids whose garden backs onto ours woke me up while having a fine old time at 10:30 this morning - ten fucking thirty!! I normally work Saturday mornings but I didn't have to this week so it would have been nice to not have been woken up by the little hellions from across the back being noisy!! I blame the parents - children should be kept locked up at weekends to allow adults who have been working all week to do what they want without being disturbed.  Or maybe I'm just being a grumpy bastard.

      Well I'm totally fucking knackered. Thats what you get for wandering aimlessly round London all bloody day. Wasn't all bad though, I am now Officially Cool. Hurrah. Another short one tonight, but I'm promising myself a lengthy post soonabout the mysteries of the world and the human race, just something to make the most of this great free thing that no one reads except me. Rah. That picture on my profile incidentally is my band, Black Top Phoenix. But then, if you're reading this then you probably already know that. Ho hum. Oh and by the way...SANDWICH OF THE DAY - chicken and sweetcorn. Its all I had between 8am and 9pm so I hold it in very high esteem.

      Did I even go to bed? Fuck its early, I think my eyes are bleeding. I think I got a cosy 4 hours sleep there, so it was all worth it in the end.

      Well folks, its been a fucking doozy - here's to the end of the first full day of me having my very own blog. Will wonders never cease? Probably not (figure that one out if you have the time and the inclination). No? Na, me neither.  So it hasnt been the most interesting day for blogging...who knows what will happen? Or maybe I'll just forget about it all together...one day I'll keep that promise! ARF!  Sorry, I just had a very fucking annoying IM, so I'm off now...Grrrrr.....

      Christ on a fucking bike, I hate mornings. Some people by this time have been up since stupid o'clock by this time, but I'm not one of those people. I had to set my alarm (shudder) and when it goes off its like a bloody police car siren right next to your ear. "Wake up you cunt, its morning!!!!" Grrr. Anyway, I had this very odd dream - it's a variation of a recurring dream in which I'm tutoring kids in the arts of indoor football  at the local leisure centre, only this time, it was (deep booming voice) IN THE FUUUTUUUUURRRREEEE!!!!!! Basically, I ended up having my skin peeled off with a weird laser beam thingy. Fuck, I was only trying to teach indoor football, and I ended up looking like one of those dogs you see hanging upside down in a Korean street market. So, 2nd to last day of my week off, and I'm having lunch with Grandma (its her birthday) and hopefully there will be some pubbage this evening, cos its been a little while and I have a reputation to up hold. Still cant get the song we were writing last night out of my head, which is possibly a good sign.  Bollocks. urlLink

      Right, I have no idea how this fucking thing works, so I'm just gonna write some shit and see what happens. I'm probably gonna use this blog to just write some stuff that I don't really want to tell anyone I guess, or I may just forget about it all together. Who knows.

      It's possible I may have jumped the gun with this whole "medical issue", so to those of you who have expressed concern (and I didn't realise that people actually still read this fucker!), thank you, but don't worry! I'm sure it's all good and that the brain leaking out of my ear is just a sign that there is too much knowledge and wisdom in there...I'm joking of course. Ha ha. But seriously, it's all fine I imagine, so until I go on red alert, nobody else needs to.

      ...but I don't suppose anyone's actully noticed.  Anyway, I've been pretty busy - BTP are in the studio and it's sounding pretty fucking good if I do say so myself. Gotta say, I do like the whole studio thing, hearing the songs develop as more and more stuff gets added. I like the idea of lock ins, eg, recording until you drop (like we did in the B-Sides - 24 hours straight one time I recall) but I suppose it's wise to get some breaks in here and there! And we're doing the Guilfest thing next Sunday, so that'll be cool. Oh, if anyone reading is at a loose end on Wednesday at about 9pm, tune into Eagle FM (96.4 or something) cos we're doing an interview and some acoustic stuff. Yay.  What else...oh yeah, nearly finished work for the summer, so I have yet another financially desolate period til November, when I next get paid. Oh well, it'll give me a chance to catch up on some drinking. There's something quite comforting about being drunk by midday.  I can't think of much else to say right now, except that I may have a fairly serious medical condition, but I'll let you know as soon as I do, Mr Blog.  Woo.

      Ha ha ha ha ha!! The plot thickens! If you're reading this, and you know who you are, then know this...I'm fucking well and truly onto you - and don't think you can lie your way into my sympathies anymore. The games up. And you, my friend, have lost.

      Sounds weird, but I think I'm very slowy becoming slighty aggrophobic. "Hey boy," I hear you say "Don't beat around the bush or anything - you  think  you might be (albeit very slowly) going  slightly  aggrophobic?" Yes, I know I sound a bit hesitant on the subject, but I don'tknow. Take today for instance - I'm bunged up to fuck (that's what you get for living with 3 other people; even the germs are communal) so I had a choice: go out and get some medicine or stay in and hope nobody sees me. So, I stayed in, and as a result, I feel worse than ever now. I think that's what my mum would call cutting off your nose to spite your face, but I call it just being a bit....strange...I also had the opportunity to go to the pub this afternoon, but I backed out. Now that's unheard of! The pub is like a second home to me, and yet I didn't even wanna do that! I haven't actually the left the house since Sunday,  except to go to band rehearsals. It's getting to the point where I won't go out unless I have to, like, really have to, otherwise I'd rather stay home. I guess sometimes you just don't want to be seen. And, no, it's not laziness - I can be lazy, and this definitely isn't the same thing. But then again, I have a history of reading too much into stuff, so who knows, I might just be being a big fucking baby. Waa waa.  Oh, and incidentally, no further developments on my earlier post, apart from the fact that Person A has totally misconstrued what Person B said to them. Sorry, not my fault.

      Well, that's just sweet isn't it. An already difficult situation has been made even more difficult by someone who I regarded as a good friend. Allegedly. So, tonight, there will be words said as Inspector Walrus puts on his deerstalker has does some investigating.  Why the fuck can't people just mind their own business? If what I heard is true (and to be honest it may very well be), then there is gonna be trouble. Oh dear.

      Hello summer, nice to see you again. Did you bring your months of boredom, financial worries and drinking too much with you, like last year and the year before? Excellent, sit yourself in that corner and don't move til September 20th. We're gonna have a great time, you and me.
