        urlLink Date: Friday, May 14, 2004  Time: 11:00 Am Place: 146 Arts   The animated fish in Pixar's Finding Nemo are colorful and varied. As part of the process of creating these characters, the shading team translates the director's vision into texture maps and software (shaders) which generate the look of the character at render time. This talk will describe a general approach for creating RenderMan character shaders and discuss techniques used to solve specific problems.  About the speaker  Byron Bashforth received his Bachelors and Masters in Computer Science from the University of Saskatchewan in 1996 and 1998. After joining Pixar Animation Studios in 1999 as a technical director, he has worked on Toy Story 2, Monsters Inc, For the Birds, Finding Nemo, and The Incredibles. His recent work has focused on characters and their visual development, including Finding Nemo's Dory and Gill. I think  urlLink Jeb  and I are planning on going.

      After the last Freehouse, a lot of people were asking me about what is next or on the flipside, is the Worship Freehouse dead? I never knew what to say. Was it dead or wasn't it. Some people who helped create it had moved on or were too busy with other things or just weren't as passionate about it anymore. Not only that but we were running up with some insurance issues and financial realities.  Last week while having a Slurpee with fellow Freehouse founder Todd Peters we were talking about it and Todd started talking about the original vision for the Freehouse that he had while at Soularize in Seattle a couple of years ago. Basically for there to be a place where the theologian and artist could come together and hang out and be who God created them to be.  It is a hard balancing act to do and I wonder how effective it was (I mean that in a good way because how does one evaluate that) having it in one place. We started talking about Todd passion of music and some others passion of theology and the  urlLink Theology Pub . As we tossed around ideas we talked of that happening as a community and not as an event. Instead of getting musicians to play for us, what about us as a group going to listen to them play at their gigs?  Instead of preparing a learning experience all of the time, why not go an take in some of the learning opportunities and lectures that Saskatoon has to offer?  Todd and some others still have some ideas for some events but not as a regularily scheduled "service". I am not sure what it will look like in the end but it should be a little more organic and not as programmed, then again it will also depend on knowing what is happening in Saskatoon so if you know of something cool, let us know.  As far as knowing what the Freehouse will be up to, check out the new blog and  urlLink Atom feed  for updates and news.

      Food at Jordon & Wendy's place (1403 Avenue D North) around 3 p.m.  Wifi provided but bring your own drinks.  Around seven we will make a decision on whether to keep hanging out or heading to Diefenbaker Park to see the bands (the bands are not announced at this time) and the fireworks (generally a little underwhelming) or doing something else.  Will post more as we have the details.

      LT is opening up the cabin again This year the cabin is open from July 26 to Aug 2 for anyone who wants to relax, talk theology and share church experiences.  We rented a house boat for an afternoon last year and that turned out to be a highlight.  There is no base cost, just bring yourself and some food.  All I require is knowledge of your arrival.  This will help me plan things out.
