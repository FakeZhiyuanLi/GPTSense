       XBOX REVIEW     This 4th edition of Colin McRae's rally series is a good one.  I have yet to play the previous selection of his games so I'll write this from a "Virgin" perspective as a newbie checking out his game.  The gameplay overall is typical of a standard driving game front on, and with different in cockpit views.  There are a wide and specific selection of cars ranging from "group b cars" to "4wd/2wd" cars, and there are a wide range of tracks to race them on.  All your typical exotic locations Greece, England, Japan, Norway, Italy.      "Ok was that 40 degree right turn, or 90 degree right turn?"    The different playing modes are all very well selected with the ability to play 4 player split screen and championship 2 player switched full screen on a few of the different selections.  If you are renting this game you may want to check the  urlLink this  game website out for some cheat codes.  The initial selection of cars leaves you drooling from the shadows of the other cars that lay in group B.  Everything from an old Austin CV to some of the best and fatest rally cars out there today.    The Scenery in the game is very well done, along with the slide particle effects and shading have been given lots of attention.  The interaction of the scenery as well adds a good touch and around some bends it will slow you down if you arent playing attention very carefully to the on screen arrows.  As well as the on screen arrow indication you will get instruction from a co-pilot driver who will be shouting course notes at you.  Sometimes they can come in handy if you pay attention to the "careful left" or "long right" additions that he has.  They add a good touch to the game instead of it being just driving and no notes.          *drool* ok how do we get to the place where we can do donuts?     So overall I would say rent Colin McRae 4 and give it a try.  If your a fan of driving games it might just be one for your collection afterall, but I wouldnt ever buy something with out giving it a try first.  The selection of cars and choices of places to race are good and generally they provide a steeper challenge if thats what your after.  Also with the split screen approach it gives you alot more fun if your having a couple of friends over to play some games.  Definetly one to try.        Overall Rating 85%

       XBOX REVIEW      I found this second James Bond title for the Xbox a good one overall.  Its gameplay allows for multiple playing types and styles like racing in a car or going on foot as the man James Bond himself.  Graphics and Style in this game are very good and the gadgets that James has in his arsenal in this one are very stylish and much more upgraded than the previous game "nightfire".  On top of all the upgrades from the previous title by Electronic Arts they have added the actual character voices for all the different characters in the game.  Now some of you might be saying "Who gives a flying $%@#?  I wanna blow some #$%@# up!"  No doubt, but to the sleuth style of the game and slick intros it adds that extra "Je ne sais quoi".        "spank me harder Jaws you bling blinging bad boy"      Yes what you see above is the man, Jaws.  He makes an appearance on the train level, just an example of the care for detail and the more in touch the game makers have become with the classic Goldeneye release, and the Bond series in general.   The gameplay as compared with the original goldneye/nightfire format of first person shooter has been changed however.  For some who are faithful to the original first person style it could be a change that isn't really welcomed.  However the game does add a new hand to hand combat feature,  a sleuth mode, and a bond sense feature.  Sleuth mode in bond is much like that of Splinter Cell or other games where stealth is paramount.  There is a back to wall feature that allows you to approach a corner or a break in the wall and see what is around the corner.  The bond sense feature is a new feature added by EA that makes it possible for the player to detect secrets and important features about a room by giving a three circle red ring over anything of note or ability to interact with in the room.  This feature tends to break up the gameplay in my opinion and messes with the flow and challenge of the game.        a mercenary feels the thrust of bond in full effect *snicker*    Now the targeting system.  hmph.  It makes EON (everything or nothing) a more playable game for people who aren't familiar with the FPS format, but overall it removes the challenge from the game of being able to target an enemy. The idea of targetting something and then switching with the move of a joystick and autoaiming on the target with out using the crosshair manually allows less expereinced players to get in the groove and give it a go.  However, much more easy overall.    The difficulty rating in the game is also interesting. The settings as they get more difficult give you more guys to fight, more objectives, and less ammo to do it with.  I like this personally.  Instead of giving the enemies more armour, or making them more impervious to bullets, they give you less ammo to shoot them.  Know I know your thinking "Well what do we do when we run out of ammo?" Well I'm glad to tell you they have finally developed a decent hand to hand combat feature in a run and gun type of game.  In general I like the idea of being able to get more physical with your enemies that just a fist that swings out and hits someone or a knife that pokes out at your enemy (Flash back to wolfenstein 3d) EON provides a very delicate balance of kungfu moves, grab from behinds (as exercised in the picture above), and a whole other repatoir of attack and counter attack moves, very chic.    In general I find this version of bond alot more enjoyable when played first player.  The flow of the missions and user interface are very nice and the addition of a training mission allows you to practice the grappling techniques and other gadgets that I have neglected to mention here.  No question that this is rent before buy, if a buy at all but it deserves a good lookover.   OVERALL RATING 9.0

       So.   This is the first installment of Bukka game reviews.  If your wondering what  Bukka  is all about its a forum for you to post your game reviews on.  Yes you the average person who has a lick of sense and wants to share their enjoyment or displeasure about a game or an aspect of a game that you agree or disagree with.  I will be mainly writing and renting a group of games and reviewing them once everywhile with some cohorts, Ken, Jeff and others who want to get involved.  Who knows   you just might end up being one of your feature columnists!!    So here we go.  You'll find the first review written hopefully sometime today, god and girlfriend willing.
