       AVRIL LAVIGNE  "My Happy Ending"  So much for my happy ending Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh...  Let's talk this over It's not like we're dead  Was it something I did?  Was it something You said? Don't leave me hanging In a city so dead Held up so high On such a breakable thread   You were all the things I thought I knew And I thought we could be    You were everything, everything that I wanted  We were  meant  to be,  supposed  to be, but we lost it And all of the memories, so close to me, just    f a d e     a w a y All this time you were   pretending    So much for my happy ending Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh...  You've got your dumb friends I know what they say They tell you I'm difficult But so are they But they don't know me Do they even know you?  All the things you hide from me  All the shit that you do  You were all the things I thought I knew And I thought we could be  You were everything, everything that I wanted We were meant to be, supposed to be, but we lost it And all of the memories, so close to me, just fade away All this time you were pretending So much for my happy ending Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh...   It's nice to know that you were there   Thanks for acting like you cared  And making me feel like I was the only one  It's nice to know we had it all   Thanks for watching as I fall  And letting me know we were done  You were everything, everything that I wanted We were meant to be, supposed to be, but we lost it And all of the memories, so close to me, just fade away All this time you were pretending So much for my happy ending Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh...  Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh...  So much for my happy ending   Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh...
