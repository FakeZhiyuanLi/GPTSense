Cos i hv a feelin that we dont hv enough time to practise & we may ended up cockin up everythin all again...... In Npcc, me now a NCO... but sometime i dont feel dat its fair... Cos i saw dat its jus the same old people doing the job & getting Busy...... & the same old  people who relax & dont have anything to do....but am glad & happy cos a few cadet of mine from Sec 2. praise me of being a gd trainer, they said dat they are havin a lot of fun wif me training them..... & they even asked me on that day to train them again  btu i dont have any mood on dat day so no trainin, no learming & no lecturing from me..... niwae me still in kayakin until we passed out next year....
