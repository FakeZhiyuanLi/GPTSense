      Let it flow, but don't let it all pour out...no sex...darn...that pretty much eliminates what I have to say....Not!!!  More abstract, seems to be a theme with me, the less constraints I have, the more creative I can be.  The more free I can be, the better prose flows from me...see...  Thanks Fos...you hit that right on the head!

      What the heck am I supposed to be writing here? I get started and then it flies straight out the other side of my head.  Got many ideas but none seem to mesh out...what do I think about politics, they suck...why do we need government, they are all about the little people-not...what about religion, I feel whatever you need to believe to get you through the day, but if its off the wall, I don't want to hear it, but if it makes me laugh, then maybe.  What do I think? I think it should be whatever you want it to be.

      This is the first of many...stressing today, got so much to do it makes my head spin.  Tomorrow my 2nd son graduates 8th grade. Whew, never thought it would be such a relief!  But all that does is remind me of my 1st son who was given up 21 years ago this month.   Happy Birthday!!!!    It hurts, bad...where do I go from here?  Reaching into the past brings me so much pain, pain in knowing how ignorant I was about life and how I would change it if I knew then what I know now.  I'm all grown up now, but what did I learn?

      The tournament is over, we went down with 2 wins and 3 losses...it was a tough ride this week and we will be glad to get home tomorrow.  &nbsp; The highlight of the whole tourney was playing 3 games in Ripken Stadium, home of the minor league Ironbirds, so the boys got a feel for playing on a professional size field and I have to say that most of them held there own the entire time, though my son lost his heart the last game I think, his head just wasn't in it anymore.  &nbsp; When I finally get home I will be putting all the pictures that I can put together up and I will put a link here. &nbsp; Welll not much more to say, ready for a nap, then the pool, got nothing else to do! &nbsp; Sun

      They say whats done in the dark will always come to the light But what about what's done in the light, will it come out when its dark?  A Little Ditty...  Sun warms the day, Moonlight cloaks the night  Sitting here with you, Makes me feel so right  You hold me close, I feel your heat  Next to you, where I want my heart to beat  Our minds meet again, our souls are complete  You in my life, there's nothing else that can compete  For friends we were and friends we will always be  Nothing can take that away from me   (For you..Cochise, thank you for reminding me of what was missing)

      I know I said I would write when I came back from Indy. I didn't realize that I would be so tired and now we are in Baltimore.   I had no idea travelling with my son's baseball team would be so extremely exhausting.   But I love it, we meet so many new people everyday and we may actually get a chance to me Cal Ripken Jr this week (if we are lucky!)  This trip its only myself, my son and my youngest daughter, usually its five of us cramped up together.   The land out here is beautiful, there are so many trees along the highway. Not like in Chicago, all you see are businesses and corn... ;0) but really, its exciting.  This was the first time my son and daughter flew, my daughter was like me, laid back and enjoying the flight but my son was white knuckled and sweating profusely, he hated it and said he likes rollercoasters better!   We will finally get a chance to rest soon, next week he has one last week-long tournament, then its over for the UDC Cougars...thats the team he plays for this summer.   Sun

      I have been watching recently and I have a few suggestions:  1. For us fuller size women, just because the outfit comes in your size, doesn't mean you can wear it.  2. If your high heels are at a 45 degree angle to your foot, you look ridiculous when you wear them, don't get mad if I laugh when I see you struggling down the street.  3. If you are bent at the waist when you walk, then I suggest that you not wear those 4 inch hooker heels.  4. No, belly shirts are NOT acceptable if you are pregnant  5. Neither are tank tops  6. Or Low-riders  More to come...  Sun

      It August 11 and its freakin 60 degrees outside!! What is that? Who stole my summer? Give it back!  But really, here in Chi, all you have to do is wait a day or so if you don't like the weather, and I guarantee that it will change, though you still may not like it.  Its funny, I saw a guy with a trench coat and corduroys on yesterday, kinda scared me, wondered did he know something I didn't?

      ...although sometimes I don't know why.  its cruel sometimes, life lets you in, gives you all these feelings, all these opportunities, right when you can't really do anything about them, then it puts you out, you know.  got so many mixed feelings, my life, my kydz, my friends...  but I'm getting closer now to making a run for it...it feels like my life is closing in on me...where should I go, should I do it alone, or should I not, see there is the turn I take...I want to leave and go by myself, no encumberances, no more responsibilities, I want to be selfish for once in my adult life and not have to think of what others want for me, of me, or whatever...  well...when I go, it will be the final step in my evolution, can't you tell I'm shedding my old skin?
