       Quite a sad day today...Soraya (the other hostess) left  and I feel a bit sad...i just hope we'll be able to keep in touch...I don't see why we wouldn't...I'm so gonna miss her!!!   Eric (Bubblies' singer) came over this morning for his weekly english lesson...I forced him to do a bit of "boring" translation before we started the singing. He actually sings the songs for the new album and we work on his pronounciation...it's really quite good fun!!! He then drove me to work where I met soraya and gave her a little good-bye present...so that she won't forget me!!!   Also, I got an e-mail from Lucy today...she told me she's definitely getting married next year (I'm SO HAPPY for her) and that she's going to south America on holiday...lucky her!!!   Anyway, nothing more to say, apart from the fact that today's friday and that I'm not working tomorrow and can go shopping!!!   Love

      Haven't written anything for a while...it's just that I felt a little sad as my parents left on monday morning...time really does go by fast when you're happy!!! Anyway, Nat came over yesterday and we spent the morning talking about one thing and another...slagging off "the gang"(basically stating the obvious) . She also did my hair (she used to be a hairdresser) and then drove me to work. Since it was pouring with rain she also came to pick me up and we went shoppig...but seen as  I don't have that much money at the moment I didn't buy anything... After that I went back home and spent the evening with my baby and two of his work mates...it was really fun, even if I drank a bit too much... Anyway, gotta go now...I've got work to do!!!

        Nobody around today…I was talking to a couple of colleagues when I realised there must be around 20 people in the building as opposed to about a 100 on a regular bases…believe me it does make a difference…on the other hand I do have more time for writing here, so it’s not too bad after all…anyway, last night Olivier got an e-mail from one of our so-called close friends who’s about to move out of his flat with his darling girlfriend. He wanted to invite us to some sort of “farewell party” in his old flat and he of course invited everyone from the gang. When I say the gang I mean: - Couple number one : She is a frigid almost-thirty-years-old annoying girl who hates the following: cigarette smoke, cigarette smokers, bars and clubs and restaurants (cos people are allowed to smoke in those), meeting up with friends (cos she hates talking to people in general and that’s what friends do) and giggly happy-to-see-you type girls (since she thinks nobody enjoys spending time with other human beings, therefore they just are fake and naive girls…). He on the other hand is a very very very nice guy (and I promise you im not being ironic here)…the only real problem he’s got is that he doesn’t seem to be able to properly choose the people around him. - Couple number two : She is veeeeeery interested in herself, especially in her glossy-shiny-lightly-highlighted(natural look you understand) hair that she washes and carefully dries every bloody 12 hours. She carries around a huuuuuge make-up bag (more of a suitcase really) and it takes her around an hour-an hour and a half to do her feet (French pedicure…we ARE in France after all…) He is almost thirty but one would think he’s only just turned 16 (even though he DOES iron his shirts all by himself). He really likes the sound of his own voice and probably thinks he is the reincarnation of some very intelligent dead person. - Couple number three  “THE HOSTS”: She is the opposite of girl number one. She spends more money than she’ll ever have and she can’t possibly live without people around her (it really is an obsession). She has no moral values (money, family), no loyalty and no shame at all. He used to be my best friend but happily forgot about me as soon as he found himself a girlfriend. He’s very “Look at me im the best “, therefore no regrets… - Couple number four : She is very “memememememememememememe” and he is very “memememememememememememmeme”. - Couple number five : She is like “I’m so beautiful and rich and clever” and he is like “Im so beautiful and rich and clever and you are such poor scum…” Now see why we really don’t wanna go? You might be wondering why on earth we keep in touch with this kind of people seen as we don’t particularly enjoy their company. Thing is, if it was all down to me I would have stopped pretending a long time ago, but Olivier’s known most of them forever and I think he still “loves” them, if anything because of the “good old times” they had together. I can totally understand that and I truly respect it, but they have hurt us both so much that I can’t be bothered anymore. They are now nothing more than acquaintances to me … After reading this you must think Im not an easy person to impress and that I lack tolerance…but believe me I don’t! I really enjoy people and I have quite a nice amount of very good friends. You must think I’m making them up…promise Im not, just read on… I’ve met quite a lot of people and im friends with a good number of them, but there are only a few who are close to me, and even less who are very close…see what I mean??? The very close ones: - Copine:  a wonderful, straight-forward, down-to-earth girl…I’ve known her for almost two years and she’s always been very important to me, right from the start. - Nat -the sweetest girl in the world, the kind of person who will always be there…I owe her so much…she really is special - Alessia -an Italian friend from school…she’s like a sister to me, we know each other so well it’s really comforting. The close ones: - Nunzia - she used to be a very close one (possibly the closest) but she’s changed so much over the past two years that im having trouble recognising her. She is also Italian and ive known her for 15 years (Gosh I AM old…) - Eric, JL and Carine - all three of them part of a French band (BUBBLIES). They are the most adorable, warming people ive ever met. I luuuurve them!!! - Lucy - a friend from uni…she helped out a lot when I first got to London. She is so sweet and caring and I know I can always count on her!!! - Immy and Fran - my two flatmates at uni…lovely, sweet, cool, really good fun, caring…they have it all!!! I hope I haven’t forgotten anyone…the others may not be so close as these ones but I really care about them anyway…    ciao ciao

      Hello there...Gosh, I really feel like a fat cow today...I ate so much last night!!! Anyway, Béné and Cyril came over and we had a lovely time. Nothing special happened and I'm now at work feeling a little sick-my stomach is upset because of the shameful amount of alcohol I've ingested and I think I've put on too much perfume, which always makes me a bit dizzy...as you can tell I've got nothing much to say, so I think I'd better go...have a nice day!

       Really nice day today...Yesterday had a lovely evening with my parents and my wonderful baby (Olivier) and we ate lots and drunk even more (white wine, red wine, grappa...!!!). I went to sleep around midnight so I'm not that sleepy today. Am at work (got here about 20 minutes ago) and the place is totally empty, no one around, absolutely no one...sooooooo depressing!!!   Last night we had a biiig talk about things that have and are upsetting us, and we mentioned Nico and Chrystel, who used to be my two so-called best friends and who betrayed me in the most horrible way. We had actually created a wedding planning agency together and when the time came to register with the local authorities they told me they wanted more shares than me and didn't leave me a choice. I therefore decided to leave and haven't seen them since, even if they've tried to contact me a few times, palying the victims saying stuff like "Val, we don't really understand why you don't want to be our friend anymore...we feel so sad about that"... stupid fuckers! They also kept all the work I had done for the agency without even paying me fot it!    Anyway, enough of them...they are so not worth it anyway, just like all the others who are part of Olivier's gang (and who had became my friends also) who actually didn't find it that shocking that Nico and Chrystel took over the agency without leaving me a choice and left me jobless and moneyless...at least now I know who my real friends are...   It feels like I'm putting on weight again (no wonder with all the food and alcohol I've been filling myself with in the past week) and it really pisses me off. As soon as my parents go back to Italy I'll stop eating junk and drinking anything that is not water (easier said than done!!!). Also, tonight Béné and Cyril are coming for dinner wich means I'm gonna stuff myself with "gateaux apéro" and red meat...so bad and yet so good...   Anyway...I just can't wait for the week end to come...

       Really shitty day today. Got up at 9 (pretty late, I know) as the alarm didn't go off and Olivier showered and had his coffee in about 15 seconds...it really was quite a stressful way to start my day. After that my parents came to mine's for brakfast and we had a major fight over a stupid shitty cereal-made buiscuit (I was trying to force my dad to have one and he just wouldn't). Things got a bit carried away and before we knew it we were being really stupid and having a real fight (my mum joined in as well). When we calmed down I realised I'd said things I shouldn't have said and I really upset them both. So I apologised, but I still don't feel right cos I could tell my dad was REALLY upset.  I hate myself now and all I wanna do is bang my head on the door. I'm just so fucking stupid!!!   Also, I should know better since my father's sister (my aunt...daaahhh!!!) has been a bit of a twat to him (and the whole family really) and ,since he's always been extremely close to her, I know he feels very bad about this and I'm sure he doesn't stop thinking about her. And here I go pissing him off and hurting him first thing in the morning! Val you're a sad cow, really.
