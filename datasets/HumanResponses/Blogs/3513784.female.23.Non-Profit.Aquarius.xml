         Mostly here ...    Ursprüngliche Nachricht----- Von: matthew.neagle@aiesec.net [mailto:matthew.neagle@aiesec.net] Gesendet: Samstag, 17. April 2004 09:33 An: oriana.torres@aiesec.at Betreff: [Americas Uno] GN Coordinator   Dear Americas Unos:  It is with great pleasure that I announce the GN Coordinator for 2004-05....  ORIANA TORRES!  Oriana is currently the MCVP in Austria and was previously the MCVP of Colombia.    Her role during the next year will be including: -Selling of Developing Leader's Day and Awards Partner -Coordination of Explora Program -Cultivating Talent Development Relationship  Please feel free to contact Oriana at oriana.torres@aiesec.net!  Matthew   * * *  Well it´s not true, actually I hope one time my thoughts could be centered in one topic, but it has never been posible! For those who know AIESEC (are AIESEC people), well yes, to many of you I haven´t told, but I´m in at least one year more coordinating for Latin America (this is the Spanish Speaking Groth Network) three of the main innitiatives of the current plan. It´s bloody good stuff, it´s a piloting (well, many people don´t like the word piloting, so let´s say running for the first time) a position that has to become financially sustainable by its own in less than 6 months... well good stuff, or scary?  Well, there are always TRADE-OFFs for everything in life, important is that I feel passionate about the job, travelling cross Latin America selling regional products and therefore, explaining more than ever the power of the organization. Always wanted to do it at an international level, and seems that now I´m in!

            Hi mates,  I just realized that is quite "fake" the way I have been handling my old  urlLink http://orianatorres.aiesec.ws  weblog ... actually I will keep using it (that´s why old is not the best way to name it), but for the same I´ve been using it till now, making kind of newspaper for friends that might be interested (or not) about what I´ve been doing lately.  Come on...I love writting , for those who really know me, they know I do, and I love to do it long, and detailed ...           Looking into my sent-mail folder, I realized that it´s high time not not only share the random, other times "rationale" but however always emotional thoughts that come to my mind, with the same 3 people. Actually I trust them a lot for doing it, but what is so bad to post freely what you thik?    And Bingo ... I managed to find this free bloging site (thanks  urlLink Santi  - http://santiagou.blogspot.com/,  I just saw you were using it).  Well also real credits should go to  urlLink Levri . Levri - ulli.typepad.com  also had a big influence in my way of perceiving (or actually using) blogs (and specially bloggers) and how money, true friends, and dreams can be made out of them. Once she asked to someone, what his key to sucess was, and this answered:  "I just did it through sharing my ideas"

       Lately NIKI has showed being a genuine member of the UNITED TEAM (LEVRI, we did it!!!) -     practically we made out of him a monster ... things like bitching, saying naturally some of the  urlLink "what we use to say"  expressions, is DOWNLOADING MUSIC!!! in his computer, being in love !!!! and doing things like putting pictures of her darling in his desktop and even one time calling me "BEBE" (give me a break!), are  the best PROVES that HE´S ONE OF US!     Niki and Levri   Now, there is no better sample, than his weblog (I´m very proud of having introduced him to this world), please ladies and gentlemen go for it at  urlLink http://nikiontour.blogspot.com   and ENJOYYYYYYYYYYYYY!

      This is worst that what i thought ... now my dear sucesor,  urlLink Mate , now also has a weblog!!! way to go, and way to titel it ...   untouchable feelings  live your life as it would be a piece of art. design it!   Now, going home, Levri is cooking for us (what a surprise!) was not one of my best ever productive days, but lately emotions and thoughts around what is coming in almost one month after arriving home, are my favourite occupation. I did not tell by the way how the  urlLink RAFTING weekend  went, but I just have one thing to say in this regard:  I AM ALIVE!

        Jana, Me and Levri   Well, just wanted to share two of some pics we took one week ago while celebrating Jana´s brithday.  She was President of AIESEC in Germany last term (03 04)... and was visiting  urlLink Levri  and Vienna ...     The pubs/bars at  urlLink MUSEUMSQUARTIER  in Vienna are not that bad! And even the nicer component is that on a summer night (even if the night we were there was far away to be really warm!) you can just spend some time randomly sitting and making pictures of you on the certain "modern art" pieces that lie all around the building. Last winter I was also, now seriously, in the Museum of Modern Art inside MUSEUMSQUARTIER, and it´s worth ... have to admit that sometimes while lookign at some "art pieces" I was doubting A LOT about my sensitivity towards ARTS, but specially coming from Latinamerica and from an environment where arts are not the TOP ONE priority of government and citizens, it was for sure a one time experience!

      Well, yes and again!  I think the more I travel and have the opportunity to feel the world as my home, the more I hate the stupid and burocratic VISA processes. This on one side, and on the other, the not less hated FLIGHT reservation and neverending fights for a "fair" fare on a high travel season. What a surprise, now  urlLink IC  is calling and the stress is back. Why?     DO I find a real cheap air fare? NO DO I find a "relative cheaper" air fare? Well yes, but over the US DO I need a US trasit Visa? YES Does it take AGES to get even a trasit visa being Colombian? YES WHY?  urlLink Just click here  (if you really wanna hear the background! it´s really valid I mean, but really unfair at the same time ...)  Let´s see; hope to have this defined by the end of teh next week, max! If not my little  urlLink SSGN Coordinator  budget will be really hurted!    I am serously tired of the whole crap travel after travel ...

       The closer the day of my coming home from Austria is, the more exited and pleased sound my family in the phone ...  I mean it´s an unique feeling - They tell you these small things that money can´t buy like what are they gonna cook for you, how thinks will look like in your own room, how many sunsets that we miss we can see now ... etc ... on the other hand friends also start to mail, asking for the exact date you arrive and making preliminary plans for a bastard WELCOME PARTY ... I also can´t imagine seeing my  urlLink boyfriend  again,  actually have to confess that this is my favourite part and would deserve its own posting, or even its own weblog  ... in general it would be like a bombastic explosion of all the love you kind of stored for one year for your people ...   Many peope have asked during the whole year (time after time)...  "Mowwww, you miss your family? you miss your country? wow, how can you manage it with your boyfriend?"   And many times I answered proudly: " NO! I do not miss them, I mean you miss someone when they are not anymore with you or when you lost them, but despite the distance anyway I am so close to them, and you know, I´m very used to travel and connect with them all in very different levels"     Which IS A COMPLETE CRAPY LIE and A CHEAP FAKE THEORY. OF COURSE I MISS THEM, AND A LOT! HUG AND BE HUGED, KISS AND BE KISSED, FIGHT, CRY, OR JUST OBSERVE THEM WHILE THEY ARE SLEEPING AND I WAKE UP IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT TO HAVE A GLAS OF WATER.      Therefore I find really stupid how I sometimes was proud of "thinking that I was not missing", or that "missing" was a sign of being weak ... or in general thinking that feelings is somthing you can control.  CRAP! CRAP! CRAP! and ten times CRAP!    TO MISS IS NOT MORE THAN TO WANT:  "To discover the absence or omission of; to feel the want of; to mourn the loss of; to want; as, to miss an absent loved one"  I am really happy of coming back home and BEING ME AGAIN. It sounds silly. About this BEING ME again, again, I guess this is something I have to put into paper/ or into weblog quite soon, then it was one of the biggest realization of the year. I guess I realized finally what makes me unique back home (familiywise, countrywise, professionalwise, leadershipwise) and how the last 12 months I kind of played to "taking a rest" and BEING ANOTHER ME. Posting shall come soon ...

      " There were times I didn't understand And there were times I wouldn't hold your hand But baby now I'm here for you 'Cause baby I am so in love with you    I'm gonna stand by my woman now 'Cause I can't live my life alone Without a home "      I love the way this guy sings ...  Lenny, 62 Euro for a concert of you is too less, actually is nothing ... even if I have not money at all and will not make it to your concert in Vienna. I hope you apologize me, shit sometimes happens.

       See it?      This was the cottage where I spent two days with the AIESEC INNSBRUCK Executive Board, while chairing their 04 05 Planning. Well, it was a picture of 1946!!!! but still the cottage it´s the same. I just can say for being colombian, this was like in the movies ...  I felt like HEIDI in the Alps ... hehehe just joking.  The ladscape was wonderful, the weather also, just looking at the mountain you can relax, and really feel like a small spot in this that we call world. Is so damn beautiful, that even if I was fucking tired, I just was looking forward to wake up and take a look again to the landscape. All these two days were also like a nice "TYROL" closing. TYROL is one of the austrian states and in general one of the most touristic regions of western europe. I was responsible for LC Innsbruck (capital of TYROL), therefore my visits there where quite often.  Exactly the cottage was in the subregion of  urlLink HALL . In Austria there is whole "cottage culture" - I really enjoyed lookign at it. People just sing like crazy, enjoy nature, go hiking, breath the best air ... somehow feel proudness of beloging to such a good part of the world.   Thanks INNSBRUCK for all this. Somehow, you and my team, made my year in Austria. I´ll miss you forever.

      Reading some headlines in BBC this morning I found a very funny article about the fact that  urlLink Being bilingual 'protects brain'  !       Being fluent in two languages may help to keep the brain sharper for longer - they say  This latest study appears to back up the theory that language skills also have a protective effect - they also say ...   I am passionate about languages - and about the fact of using them actively. After some times visiting and now since one year living in a german speaking country, there are moments where I say: "Dear parents, you had no clue why you sent me to this german school, but I will love you forever for this!"  Thinking back in how language education is managed in Colombia, I guess there is a lot room for improvement.   Even if in the past years the situation is not that radical, there is a decent gap between "Bilingual Schools" and "the others". Which is quite unfair - why money has to make a difference in the right people have to getting certain basic skills? In this regard I really appreciate the european public education system - opportunitities for all to get the same knowledge and develop the same skills. And I love it the most, since it gives no room for blaming the "school" or the university one comes from of the type of opportunities you have - which sadly is the day to day story back home. People give the fault to what they were not able to learn, rather than start doing something around it.  The other fact is the level of usage and REAL SENSE of learning a language. I also know couple of mates that have been in extra language courses lifelong. They celebrate every level they achive, which is quite cool, but at the end of the day the real spaces where they MAKE USE of these skills, are practically inexistent, sadly are not even looked for.    I ask myself what is the motivation to learn another language or howcome you do it ...  1. Many times is just due the paradigm your "chances of sucess in life are directly proportional to the number of languages you speak. It sounds like, "don´t discover what you what you wanna be in life and how strong your desires are, just put nice stuff in your CV."  Completely crap,  you will suceed wilth or without languages, maybe with them   it´s easier to put your nose in more parts and therefore, find what you want to be in a most exiting way.    2.  Other times it´s rather reactive. Life moves you to another part of the world (for personal or professional reasons), where you just have to absorve the language to survive. Even if shocking, I like this one a lot, at least you are having active usage to it.   3.  ND THERE ARE THE RANDOM stories, as mine, where my parents just wanted to send me to a school that shall be the opposite of a nuns school, or any other conventional education style. Their theory  still  is that as little girl I was too shy, so they needed a completely open minded, unconventional school for me. Bingo - the german one seemd to meet the criteria: no uniform, they teached GERMAN!! and english!!, the fact that students need to go abroad for 5 months before graduating, open building, long hair in boys allowed ... ACTUALLY I WAS SUPOSED TO TALK ABOUT LANGUAGES, but can´t help to think in my school when I need to recognize thanks to who my brain might stay sharper for longer  - as the study say.  Coming back to languages, now I´ll go for portuguese, this time on a reactive basis, as a just said before. Starting in november I´ll be living in Brazil so, it would be more than senseless to not to use this chance to go for another language,   specially this SEXY ONE!    (random comment, I know)   I feel lucky that my parents sent me to a bilingual school, and specially to this one, then it was not only about a language, IT WAS ABOUT GETTING A LIFE STYLE, a life stiyle of being a global villager, a life style of appreciating freedom and respecting your space of building your criteria. I guess my school made me a real  urlLink AIESEC  member even without knowing that the organization existed.  If God gives me the opportunity of having kids, I would without have second thoughts on sending them to the GERMAN SCHOOL - don´t know if I´ll manage to live in a city where there is one, but at least there is the desire!

      ... OR EVEN A SHITY WEEK?  I know that being always in a good mood in cool, is nice, is fantastic, makes you popular, makes you feel that you are perfect, but also sometimes is fair to just follow your own feelings and take the consequences of it. I just think my mood in the last days is just reflecting the way the thoughts are fighting inside my brain, and dancing at the same time with my fears and hopes. And besides that I have my period (NO, it´s not only the period story: even  without having it, I also would be thinking the same)  I really have no fear to show how I feel and do not care much ... If I feel shity I act shity, That´s it. Internally - believe it or not - I am trying to put attitude to change this, this is clear, and is something that not everybody needs to start asking me to do, as if it would have been the "lastest dicovery against bad mood and temporary thoughts crisis"   The bad thing,  however is when you just say ..."Listen, leave me alone with my devils" - you appear as the complete asshole.    The other bad thing  is that every person takes it personal - I love you all, seriously and it´s really cool that you try to make me feel better, I´ll remember some of you when I think in the word friend or real caring, but there are some issues that only one self can fix and where you have ANYTHING to do.   Last and but not least, the other bad  thing is the level of confindence/sharing that  the others expect from you. The typical "Come on, tell me what´s going on..." might remind you of what I am talking about. Helloooooooo! If I even do not know, how do you expect me to tell you!!! and as soon as I discover, I guess it´s better to fix it and come back into action, rather than telling it to anybody!!! - but again, the asshole perception comes into stage.  After so much crap written until now, all I want it ...   ALLOW ME TO HAVE SHITY WEEK PLEASE!!!   ...  follow the good case practice of my parents   when as I started with my quarter life crises! they just make the try with the traditional "What happen, what can I do for you, kissy stuff"  - BUT THEN ignore me completely. I felt better enjoying the normal right of having a shity time that every human being has and in shorter time, thoughts are in order and the party is ready to continue.   ...  also follow the good case practice of my best friends back home - Sweetie and Patiño (I miss you monsters),   that keep in the best way for themselves the way they perceive me in such shity days, the same way I do, since they know that in the end we all are far away of having a shity life!   I guess is a fact of maturity, tolerance, respect towards others space -  and specially to understand that you can keep being nice to others and keep showing yourself as a good friend, even allowing other to have a shity week.   My respects and apologizes in advance for those who think this message sucks - but that´s the cool thing of having a webloooooooog (that you can erase it afterwards in case the shity mood does not influence you anymore, allthough all I wrote, I am quite sure I will still defend even having the best of the moods!)

      Some hours ago I got this e-mail (and several responses to it!)from Johanna Garcia, MCVPe of  urlLink AIESEC in Brazil :     "Hello guys! Exciting news from Brazil!!!!! Guga and me just had an awesome meeting with Artemisia Foundation. This Foundation contacted AIESEC a while ago in order to suppport DT traineeships in Brazil, so Guga sent him the proposal that Matthew designed for Kellogs and they were very interested in supporting it. Today after answering some questions, clarifying doubts and discuss about the impact of the project (EXPLORA) Artemisia foundation decided to support the SSGN by funding with a total of US$60.000 for two years!!!!(...)"         It´s for sure one of the best news lately. In simple words, the  urlLink EXPLORA  program, one of the innitiatives of AIESEC in the Spanish Speaking Network - the region I will be working for as coordinator starting in July - just got USD 60000 from this brazilian Foundation. EXPLORA, as you might read on the page is an long term innitiative that aims to allow organizations on the development sector in Latinamerica to get young talented individuals (AIESEC Trainees) as active drivers of action and development for the organizations, as a platform for their own personal and professional development.   Coming back to the USD 60000 - still couldn´t find anything on the web from this foundation, still too many questions to answer on how it´s gonna work on the operative level,still a whole process to deliver  , but the relevant fact is that an innitiative that many did not belive in, now is showing how it is easily becoming in a project to invest in.  Facts like this - not talking about the money, but on the passion and discipline while working on something - do motivate me a lot. Also the work done by AIESEC in Brazil motivates me a lot, I guess this  - "we take the challenge" attitude -  was one of the biggest engines to run for the Spanish Speaking Network Coordinator position.     Old small Explora now is getting bigger ... Old Explora dream now is a reality ... Big challenge to be part of the process of giving continuity of the dream of the past Spanish Speaking Network generations ...

       The longer I live, the more I realize the impact of attitude on life.  Attitude to me is more important than facts. It is more important  than the past , than education, than money, than circumstances, than failures, than success,  than what other people think or say or do . It is more important than appearance, gift, or  skill .   It will make or break a company...a church... a home.     The remarkable thing is we have a choice every day regarding the attitude we will embrace for that day.         We cannot change our past... we cannot change the fact that people will act in a certain way . We cannot change the inevitable.  The only thing we can do is play on the string we have, and that is our attitude.     I am convinced that life is 10 percent what happens to me and 90 percent how I react to it. And so it is with you... we are in charge of our attitudes.     Charles Swindoll

       Long time ago I wanted to write a posting around this, exactly around crappy places and how you get/or how you never get used to them!    My personal experiences with crappy places are as old as my AIESEC career. With this I am not saying that I live in a palast back home, but fortunately it does not take more than one hour for my mom/grandma to recognize the source of disorder... and in a nice or not to nice way, ask me to take care of it. Well but let´s come back how AIESEC has been the highest point on experiencing crappy places ...    PART I: CRAPPY CONFERENCE SITES    The Zonalitos (so were called in my times of AIESEC in Colombia the newie introductory conferences) are the best examples of crappy places, well not all, but at least some I experienced were! I just can remember KLIMADIARO (or however it´s called) where the bathroom had no door and you also could see snakes in the room, this without counting otehr insects. Of course the rooms and bed clothes were of this recognizable  yellow color  that makes you think that they were not washed AT ALL! And as newie in AIESEC all this kind of crappy experiences are camufled as "living diversity" experiences ...    PART II: FIRST YEAR IN THE MC    Well, as soon as the times of full time work in AIESEC arrive, the look for cheap places to live and eat also starts. My fist year in the National Committee (MC) also were the best example of living in crappy places. The first 6 months after almost 1 month of hard seeking for a decent and specially cheap place to live, my two male teammates (Santi and Andres) and me ended is the well remembered hole at CHAPINERO, behind the Javeriana University. Why ist was crappy? Well, let´s try tu summarize ...  1. Almost 4 months without warm water (Bogota is really cold), so cold was it, that every day we had to cook water in the kitchen and bring from 3 to 4 pots that with a glas we used to take a shower. This every morning.  2. The toilet from time to time did not work, and specially after using it.  3. The apartment was FULL OF FLEAS. Santi and me were specially completely read in our whole body, they really had a good banquet with our bood! And the most embarrasing thing is that it´s so easy to recognize when you have been biten by fleas.  4. We did not have furniture - we slept on the floor, on matrass ...  5. The sink where clothes should be washed was not working, which means water could not come down. The most ugly experience was when after a long conference we realized that in the water that was stagnant, flies started to have a nest.  6. WE DID NOT HAVE A FRIDGE!!!! :)  Well, after 6 months I moved out into a ladies apartment, this was quite ok, and was a fair break before the next crappy place to come.     PART III: SECOND YEAR IN THE MC    As you know, I joined another MC in Austria. The salary (and the security to get it specially) was much better, anyways as MC you always feel like saving money and just feel also the need of looking for the cheapest option. SO we did and we ended in the 16 th district of Vienna, better known as OTTAKRING! Now the facts ...  1. Also 4th floor, of course without elevator, but let´s don´t count this as a crappy criteria ...  2. TOILET WAS OUTSIDE! Yes, it´s a so called ALTBAU (old building), and such buildings have a  shared toilet for each floor!   3. 10 days long we had the bathroom without light, we were taking shower with candles. The light bulb was such an old model, that it was difficult to find it and took around 10 days to arrive after ordering it.  4. The sink ... yes again the sink does not work, water gets stagnant, so we just have to wash our teeth in the shower or in the kitchen ... niceeee ...  5. NO WARM WATER!!! Juhuuuuuu!! also for ca. one week, and believe me, it was worst than in Bogota! The heating system was too old that also one electricity problem happened    THE MAIN QUESTION TO ASK IS ... what is the crappy thing? the flats or the way we manage it?    Day after day you do not realize it, but it makes you tired. Maybe it´s better if you do not realize it, you take your life less complicated, which is better, anyways this is typical student life and who cares ....  But there are some days where you just wake up and ask yourself ... helloooooo! where am I living!!?    CRAPPY PLACES, a lot of money has been saved, but never as much as "good" memories ...

           urlLink XAVIER NAIDOO  has been the guy that after this year in Austria is in the TOP of best singers in the german speaker world. He deserves this posting and more. Even if I was surprised when I saw him (I mean a picture), cause I imagined his voice coming  from a big blond man,  , maybe i realized where this rythim, soul and passion of his voice came from, from his asian rootes.     There is a MASTER PIECE for lovers from XAVIER, also my favourite song:    Ich kenne nichts, das so schön ist wie du - here are some of the best parts:  "Ich könnte tagelang nur von dir erzählen Ohne deinen Namen auch nur einmal zu erwähnen Unter Schmerzen oder unter Tränen  würde dein Name als meine Linderung dienen Jede deiner Bewegungen ist erstrebenswert und Jede Stunde mit dir ist so lebenswert  ... Ich kenne nichts, das so schön ist wie du ... "  which means ...  " I could daylong talk only about you, even without saying your name one time, under pain or under tearsm your name would be my cure. Each of your movements is so worthwhile, each hour with you is so worth living ... I do not know anything, that is so beautiful as you..."      And this only lyrics, you just have to hear his voice.    There is more to love like this Love is more then just a kiss Will we take you to that step Will we do more than just connect  Hay mas que amar asi,  amor es mas que un beso  me llevarias a ese estado donde simplemente hacemos mas que conectar?     It´s all about love, sing about it

       CONGRATULATIONS SILVIO!   Today I got to know that Silvio Velasquez, was selected by AIESEC INTERNATIONAL and the support partner group of this initiative, as part of the  urlLink AIESEC GLOBAL ALUMN HALL OF FAME , in the category National Contribution Award!  I was so extremely happy and again through this way (even if he might never read it - that´s why I just mailed him) I congratulate him so much. Silvio was teh founder of AIESEC COLOMBIA ALUMNI ASOCIATION - and has been always more tna involved with us! Silvio - by the way is the father of  urlLink Andres , one of my MC 02 03 Team Mates back in Colombia! Hope to see you at IC SIlvio!   OTHER HALL OF FAME ALUMNI FROM COLOMBIA   In the past also two great individuals have been awarded!     In 2000 Cesar Gaviria, who was MCP of AIESEC in Colombia, President of the Republic of Colombia and now, General Secretary of the  urlLink Organization of American States , OAS or OEA (in spanish!)From my point of view, Gaviria has been one of the best presidents COLOMBIA has had.  The other great individual was RICARDO OBREGON, president of  urlLink BAVARIA  (I remember how in the MC 0203 we called him Ricky, intenally of course). Ricardo Obregon wa also MCP, and git the award at IC 2002 in Canada!

           The world's most difficult word to translate has been identified as "ilunga" from the Tshiluba language spoken in south eastern Congo.   It came top of a list drawn up in consultation with 1,000 linguists.    Ilunga means "a person who is ready to forgive any abuse for the first time, to tolerate it a second time, but never a third time".     It seems straightforward enough, but the 1,000 language experts identified it as the hardest word to translate.   In second place was shlimazl which is Yiddish for "a chronically unlucky person".   Third was Naa, used only in the Kansai area of Japan to emphasise statements or agree with someone.

      Transition is in the highest moments ... I am already in Rotterdam, there is a lot to update about the last week, but in the meantime, short note from ELECTROLUX ...  Date:  Mon, 28 Jun 2004 17:22:10 +0200  From:  Miriam Kollnig    To:  Oriana Torres    Cc:  ""    Subject:  Re: Traineeships Conditions and Update of AIESEC Representative   Dear Ms Torres  Thanks for your note.  I have in the meantime been speaking with Mr Szuecs and we have agreed that the trainees will be given a normal employment contract when they commence employment with us, in terms of which we will define their employment relationship with Electrolux.  We will do everything we can in order to make these traineeships a success from our side.  However, should a problem arise which cannot be solved, we will contact AIESEC in the first instance to act as mediator and we reserve the right to terminate the traineeship in the event that we are unable to solve the problem.  I would like to take this opportunity to thank you for the professional way in which you handled these two traineeships for us and wish you everything of the best in your future career.  Regards Miriam Kollnig

      Believe it or not, it's almost 2400 ... and even if I have a relatively light transition plan/schedule, some changes have happened inside the board plan, that suddenly increased the stuff to be done ... I will update you about this amazing perspectives as soon as it's official.     Ok, since of course now I'm just waiting Helena to finish to go home with her (for this that Rotterdam is a dangerous city and it's better to prevent), now or never is the time to update what has happened the last dayz in Austria (I am coming back for one day anways on 14, but ...)  So, let's start ...   1. WE WERE VISITING ALEX   After some time not managing to do it, the last sunday Levri and me, randomly poped up at Alex place. Of course she was there (then is was one of this stupid rainy sundays when it's highly likely that people stay home). I won't give much details, she is feeling better and we had fun. This same day she invited us to come next week with "the boys" (niki and willi) and so we did - a great dinner waited for us! Thanks for this one ALex!       2. TAKE OVER PARTY   This happened, we got really nice presents and the key people that made the year where there. It was not as WILD as I thought, but ok, lack of alcohol influeneced ... :) ! I have realy cool pics, need to upload them, but in between, you co go for this, done by one of the LC Vienna members!       urlLink http://groups.msn.com/sashasfotos/mctakeoverparty04.msnw?Page=1    3. TEAM DAYS and Annual Report picture   Team days ... it deserves its own posting, that's why I will not make any extra comment!!! But I just leave you with the one that seems  to be the pic that we'll have on our Annual Report!

          Everybody is happy ...!!!!!!! all Manizalitas are happy ... therefore my boyfriend is happy ...  actually all colombians are happy ... all nicknames of Colombians in MSN reflect something about this ...    urlLink ONCE CALDAS  is one of the national football teams in Colombia, from the city Manizales, and it won the so called "COPA LIBERTADORES DE AMERICA" that is kind of "Champions league" for Europe!! Good stuff ah????  well ... football-mania is back - also in Europe the final of EURO 2004 between PORTUGAL AND GREECE is near! Two nights ago we were also watching (IN THE NETHERLANDS) the match between NETHERLANDS and PORTUGAL! Of course the dutch team did not make it - making a good bunch of AI people happy!  Here, coming back to ONCE, how they described it, CONGRATULATIONS :) !!!   ONCE CALDAS CAMPEON!!!!!!!!   ¡Un título no sólo para Manizales sino para Colombia!     ¡Qué noche tan grandiosa! La emoción fue total. Qué bueno para quienes tuvieron la posibilidad de vivir en el estadio Palogrande esta gran fiesta, este día inolvidable que se convierte en una hazaña para Caldas y para Colombia. Parece increíble, pero es verdad, a veces toca volver a realidad para creerlo, EL ONCE ES CAMPEÒN. Jamás se había visto tanta emoción junta, tanta euforia junta, tanta alegría junta y tantas lágrimas de alegría. El ambiente en el Palogrande fue simplemente sensacional, hermoso, único y especial.

      I can be an asshole of the grandest kind  I can withold like it's going out of style  I can be the moodiest baby  And you've never met anyone  As negative as I am sometimes   I am the wisest woman you've ever met  I'm the kindest soul with whom you've connected  I have the bravest heart that you've ever seen  And you've never met anyone  As positive as I am sometimes   I blame everyone else, not my own partaking  My passive agressiveness can be devistating  I'm terrified and mistrusting  And you've never met anyone who's closed down as I am sometimes    What I resist, persists, and speaks louder than I know  What I resist, you love, no matter how low or high I go    I am the funniest woman that you've ever known  I am the dullest woman that you've ever known  I am the most gorgeous woman that you've ever known  And you've never met anyone as everything as I am sometimes   You see everything  You see every part  You see all my light  And you love my dark  You dig everything  Of which I'm ashamed  There's not anything to which you can't relate  And you're still here

      Actually I was not planing to write a post around Neruda, not even today, but just reading some headlines in  urlLink EL TIEMPO , one of them made me remember that tomorrow, 12 of July is Pablo Neruda's birthday. For those that are not familiar with latin american poetry (or even universal cause he was Nobel prize winner in 1971), he has been one of the BIG ICONS in terms of literature of the world and one of my favourite artists.     What nobody would believe is that I know more that 5 of their poems by heart, which is not relevant at all, then finally I just enjoy more reading them, as if every time would be the first one. He was unique, and I just don't wanna spend time on trying to describe how I find his style,  I just try to imagine what would have been the feeling of being the loved one of him or even the muse of inspiration of many of his poems.  Neruda has been one of the best finding for life  of my "devoted school learning hours", I critize a lot the fact that at school you are obligued to read books and engage literature in general, that at the age of 12,13 or even 16 you are not able to understand at all, and that only when you pass the 20, you remember why the book made sense. But coming back to the point, Neruda actually was the exception from this junk of books and authors. There are also so funny memories around "Poema 20", when the whole class had to declame it - will never forget the way MONICA VIVES, I friend of my from school did it, actually very good, but due to the level of inmaturity by that time, we never stoped imitating her.  Just wanna encourage to go to a vey good sire about the 100 years of him go to    urlLink http://www.centenariopabloneruda.cl/ , it's a good one and very good sorted.  Neruda is the man ...  I like poetry a lot, actually I have was so impresed as some days ago I went back to all self written poems I have, some of them crap, but some of them very touchy, at least I could remember exactly why I wrote them and in which moment of my life ... it's a cool feeling, but somehow enjoy more reserving this "art" for myself, or maybe am not just brave enough to show my talent and expose it to the critics ... whatever,  VIVA NERUDA TODAY!      "Yo nací el 12 de julio de 1904, y un mes después, en agosto, agotada por la tuberculosis, mi madre ya no existía." Empieza así uno de los primeros párrafos de las memorias de Ricardo Neftalí Reyes Basoalto, que vino al mundo en una pequeña aldea vinícola del centro de Chile y se convirtió en uno de los más grandes y populares poetas de la lengua española. A los 14 años, para despistar a su padre, Reyes halló en una revista el apellido de un autor checo cuya sonoridad lo atrajo: Neruda. Con un Pablo como nombre, aquel joven campesino se convirtió en uno de esos pocos poetas que al mismo tiempo seducen a los críticos y graban versos en la memoria popular: "Me gusta cuando callas / porque estás como ausente"... "Puedo escribir los versos más tristes esta noche"... "Amo el amor de los marineros / que besan y se van"...

         Thanks Levri for a fair FARWELL! The ones that were there, where the one that made the year - Lev, Niki, Alo  (hehe, I´m home and you are not!),  Heinzl, Balint, Mate, Kristina ...   Yes, yes, yes I know it took me a long time to come back to my weblog but hellooooo! do you have a clue how busy you can be when you come back home after one year? Today is 31 of July! I arrived in Colombia exactly 2 weeks ago (15 of July)! And  after spending only one week there! , I moved for one week to BRAZIL! Right now I am in Sao Paulo,  and I´m in love with this city , but ok, soon I´ll write about Brazil. Now let´s focus on some farewells/welcoming feeling ...  In few words, I really still don´t feel having came back home! I´m now in a totally new culture (well, the totally is very relative, is new, but is so easy to adapt) and it has been like jumping from the part of the culture shock curve when you feel estable to another cultural shock curve where you are in the "honeymoon period". I still need to saty a longer period home :) to feel back and maybe to start feeling real "reintegration symptoms"!  Anyways, even if one week, there are deeper things you can realize!    1) One I realized I´m still in love,  actually never stoped, even if at the moment to love seems to be harder than ever. Sometimes I asked myself if I wanted to keep believing that I was in love or I really was. Answer was found.   2) I realized that I made it to gain weight!  (allthough I think I´ve been loosing weight the last two weeks as well and actually not on propose, just as a results of more movement and STRESS!! - welmcome back real stress!). About the gained kilos :), let´s say 80 % of the people like it a lot, so funny, they say I look more "woman"! Other just say - "Look good, just work on your belly"!     3) Barranquilla is Barranquilla!  freaking hot weather and cool night flair make me finally remember where I belong!   4) The leader is back!  Could also feel how the "leading sister, daugther" position came back to me. Was nice not having it one year, you feel kind of with one responsibility less, but having it again proves so much the level of trust that your relatives have in you, wich is also a better feeling.  THE QUOTATION OF THE PAST TWO WEEKS SEEMED TO BE:  "EXPECTATIONS REDUCE JOY IN LIFE" , I came with many, not all have been fulfilled till now, but  I can really feel how slowly balance is coming. Actually I regret that because overestimating my "coming back" expectations, I underestimated some of the last moments of being near to some people back in Europe  I still believe in expectations, not to have them is to be like a ship without destiny, but at least someone made me realize to overestimate expectations can drive you crazy. True.  Specially after this week in Brazil, as said, I start slowly to feel so balanced, cause let me tell you ...  LIFE IS SO AMAZING! and all this world was just made just for US! Two weeks ago in Vienna, one week ago in Barranquilla today in Sao Paulo! Does the jurney have an end? I hope never!    It was a fair farewell. It was also a fair welcome. Thanks for this ones!

Otherwise its quite impressive, well done!    Will get back to you if there any changes to the agenda (i'll discuss it with kelly) but shouldn't be any major modfification. Maybe point 2.1 and 2.2 could be merged, since we discussed the motivations yesterday, although it could be grouped under one heading.   For point 5.2, probably just go over main deadlines (the big objectives, or any bottleneck issues) rather than action-by-action.....   Btw, no capoeira tonight :(  i guess u didnt get to see the film that u were talking about yesterday?    tchau   alex

      I have a new baby, I have a new love! Let me introduce it to you, her name is urlLink  ARTEMISIA !     "ARTEMISIA is a woman´s first name. We imagine the foundation as a person not reduced to a single issue, but as a living, organic being. "She" might sometimes be contradictory, but always passionate, with a human desire to help other to transform their communities.Tha name remins us an institution is made uff of its people: staff members, supporters, fellows, grant recipients ... its structures are created not for their own sakes, but for the fullfillment of the human needs"    Isn´t this beautiful?  Ladies and gentlemen,  urlLink ARTEMISIA  is the foundation I from my AIESEC Regional Coordinator position I work for now! Just look at this values ... aren´t they sexy?     Guys, just go to their webpage, urlLink http://artemisiafoundation.org/novo/ , it´s amazing, all of them are amazing.  I feel so proud of making part of this in a way, talking about expectations ... things that you never expected, finally end of making you happier than anything...it´s just so inspiring! I feel so challenged with the expected outcomes of my job, but rather than this, I´m so hungry of knowledge and this sensitivity of understanding the development world and working between people that throwed everything away to "try to fix this world", there where they think they can start doing it. I´m amazed and I just pray for keep surprised everyday.

      Betreff: Explora Programme  Datum: Thu, 5 Aug 2004 17:25:48 +0200 (MEST) Priorität: Normal  Von: "Niki Rohrmoser"     Dear Queen of SSGN Board,  how are you? Are you at the moment in Brazil lying at the Copacapana beach or are you in Colombia lying at the Baranquilla Beach.  Yo apprendo mucho espanol aqui, pero la espanol dominicana es dificil de entender - okay back to English.  I face a lot of challenges here - no electricity, no water, no office with computer and internet except in the office of my traineeship (Horwath Consulting, www.horwath.com, if you are interested in) and the last challenge is now that we lose one MC member - Edmer our VP-ICX.  So I am now taking over his part and I am the new VP-ICX here. Due to the fact that I am didnt get much transition about the explora project, it would be very cool if you can help me. I want to push this initiative but I am lacking information.  So thank you for your help.  Aja except all these challenges the Dominican Republic is great, Merengue, Bachata, Salsa,...... Tropical heat, playas (which I havent seen so far, working in Santo Domingo from Monday till Saturday - you have no time for lying at the beach).  hasta pronto y un abrazo de la Republica Dominicana  Niki  Niki dice - "Soy verdadero un dominicana" (quote of August 2004)  PS. congratulations for your faci selection.
