       this morning i went to tom's market, got an application, and i just filled it out! woot! i'm probably getting a job. if i get hired, i can't start till august, between driver's ed and isabel being here. but still, i am excited. i've been wanting to work for awhile now. i saw chelsea p. from school when i went in. she works there. i think that if they'll hire her, they'll definitely hire me.   pawsox game later...woohoo. and my mom is making chowder.   gotta love new england.

       nathan called. he might be in my math class next year.   you know, sometimes i get the vibe that he really does like me and have an interest in me. and other times...nothing. i can't tell which one i hope for. poor guy. i think i bore him to death.   went strawberry picking this morning. and i don't even like them. bethany came, and then we came home, went in the pool, and listened to music.   other than that, i didn't really do anything. that's why i love summer.   last night, i watched THE best episode of even stevens last night, the one where louis and tawny make tapes for each other saying their true feelings. it's so sweet. i cried the first time i saw it, because even though it's just a show...i want what they have.   i sense a fanfic coming on...

       yesterday i went to the movies to see white chicks with rachelle and andrea. it was a funny movie. i laughed a lot. of course, when i got home and tony asked me what i saw, he was like, "why'd you go see that stupid movie?" honestly, nothing i ever do is good enough for him. everything i like is stupid and unimportant. it makes me mad.   then rachelle, andrea, and bethany and i played hide and seek. don't laugh, it was fun. and we talked, and then bethany left and so did my parents. they went to see spiderman 2. grr, i was jealous, i reaaaally want to see it. but i stayed home with rachelle and andrea and we had a ramen party. it was good :)   i didn't rsvp to christina's party. guess that means i'm not going.   and now i'm off to go strawberry picking.

       yesterday when nathan called (which i'm still adjusting to the shock that he actually did; i had assumed contentedly that i wouldn't see him all summer) he mentioned that he had watched return of the king. it gave me the urge to watch it too. so last night i did. and sheesh, denethor is a freak! he scares me! his train of thought: "oh, look. my sons are dead. allow me to kill myself too. because that solves everything." ew.   my driver's ed class is pissing me off. it is conflicting with everything i want to do this summer. including that overnight trip to new york, where i've never been. oh my god, do you know how awesome it'd be to go away without my parents? i'd probably die from happiness. or of shock, because of all the freedom i'd have. awww, i really wanted to go...but i'll stick to my commitment.   i decided not to go to christina's party. as much fun as it sounds, the couples thing irritates me. plus isabel will be here, and it might be uncomfortable for her. i know it would be for me. besides, there will be other parties, i suppose. right?   i went to bj's (shut up) and got books! woot!  the notebook  by nicholas sparks and  suzanne's diary for nicholas  by james patterson. reading material=happiness. i have some books on hold at the library too. yay :)   i'm going to be a busy girl after this. i'll probably go in the pool and eat lunch, and then go to the library and apply for a job at tom's, 'cause i can, woot. ah, life is good.

       i've been looking at all these pretty websites by these people who are so skilled in graphic design that it marvels me. i'm jealous. i wish i could have a cool-looking site. but no, i'm stuck with this damn blogger. ah well. someday i'll learn html. i will.   tonight, there is the possibility that i may go see spiderman 2. it's weird. i didn't go see return of the king or prisoner of azkaban when they first opened, and they are my fandoms. but spiderman comes along, and while i like it very much, i'm not a diehard fan, and i go see it as soon as it opens. ahh. what's wrong with me?   don't answer that >:-o

       ohhhhh yes. i am a happy person.   i went to the orthodontist and did an awful lot of waiting around for dr. gordon to come to me. i was very nervous, rehearsing my speech in my head and everything. plus, i was wearing shorts, so all the while i was calling myself thunder thighs inside my head too. when he came, the first thing he said was, "if you don't want to do this, you don't have to."   so i said the stuff about how it felt much better, i wasn't hurting, blah blah blah. he looked at my teeth and told me he would leave well enough alone.   so, woot! i am so happy. thrilled. enthralled.   now i'm going to go watch 7th heaven and bask in my glory.

       i never thought i'd find myself wishing for digital cable, but that's what i'm doing. every night for the past few days i've been watching the noggin preview channel, and it rocks. particularly, my so-called life and degrassi. those shows rule. they're actually realistic. unlike some tv shows i know. *cough* lizzie mcguire ;x   today is that damn appointment for me to get my braces back on. 2:45. on the bright side, i'll get out of watching laura earlier than usual. when i get there, i'm going to try to get out of it, because i'm not in pain or discomfort anymore, so why do it?   the worst was when i first got them off, and everyone was telling me how perfect they looked. and yeah, they do look good. in fact, they look artificial. meaning, they're so straight, it's obvious they aren't that way naturally. it took three years of pain and soreness and wires poking me in the gums to get them this straight. anyway, the worst part of getting them off, i kept getting compliments, but at the time i didn't want them because i was in so much pain and i was so worried that something was really wrong. so the conversations would go along the lines of, "amy, your teeth look great!"   me: *silence while i try to ignore the throbbing pain*   so hopefully my trusty retainer took care of it all.   last week my mom sent an email to isabel and she hasn't written back yet. she either doesn't like us already, or she never checks her email. what a shock she'll have when she comes here and sees all of us internet obsessed freaks.   well, yesterday i meandered into wvane.com (weathervane's site) expecting to see some clothes i can't afford. instead there's a big sign there that says "all weathervane stores are closing! everything must go! 30%-60% off!" well, woohoo! i love that store. you will be seeing me there multiple times this summer. whenever i go in there i want everything, but never have the money to get anything great.   babysitting laura all day today. *cringe* always enjoyable.   hope you all have a better day than i will.

       well, isn't this exciting. i figure, new school year, new blog! woohoo! i wish i could ramble about how exciting my life is, and how awesome, and how me and my friends are going to do this and this and that. but, that would be a lie. i'll be honest. summer has not been most interesting thus far. i've seen amanda once, but she's been busy since then. i saw harry potter. i got a haircut. in other words, nothing interesting, really.   i don't know why i left greatestjournal. i wrote so many secrets in there. i probably said so many bad things. i don't know. i feel like i need a fresh start. the fact that i let rude, ignorant people get the better of me and drive me out of my old deadjournal still bothers me. but i'm moving on. i'm almost 16 years old. time to grow up.   in other news, i'm debating about christina's party. yes, it sounds like great fun. swimming, dancing, hanging out. doesn't get any better than that. it's the whole "couples thing" that irks me. i'm not a "couple". i probably won't be for the rest of high school, because boys are too much trouble. so i don't see how i'd fit in there. everyone will be hanging with their significant other, and i'd be...by myself. how unusual. i dunno. doesn't sound like a comfy situation to me. i don't why she bothered to invite. maybe amanda told her to. who knows?   isabel (our exchange student from spain) is coming in a week! i'm looking forward to it. at least i won't be alone.   good day to you all.

       driver's ed was fascinating!   not.   the only interesting part was when we took an anonymous survey about whether we'd ever drank alcohol or not. i think i was one of about three people who hadn't. beautiful. i love being a goody two shoes.   the rest of the day consisted of lectures and some book work and three videos. and sitting in a drab classroom. so i have lots of energy now. and i have to back tomorrowww... :(   the only person i knew was kert. he's cool, he's been in my homeroom since 7th grade. he's going to christina's party tonight, which i am not. speaking of, i think it's going on right now. i feel a little bitchy for not going, but i just don't want to. i think i have better things to do. plus all i'd do was be a wallflower anyway. because i'm single, you know. and it's a couples party. so what would be the point of going?   i kind of hope keith calls tonight. what is happening to me?

       the beach yesterday was funnn. yeah, we got there at around 11:15, set up, and chillaxed. the water was freezing, so we didn't really swim. i got a sunburn on my back and my legs, the only places i didn't put sunscreen on. thus i am a future skin cancer patient of america.   at home me, isabel, rachelle, and my parents played bs. i looooove that game! me and rachelle decided we have a bs problem, because we can't stop playing it. i hope can later today. i will look forward to that :D   yes, and then keith called, and he said something interesting to me before we hung up. i can't wait to see how this turns out. unless, of course, it's not in my favor *crosses fingers*   sometimes i have no idea what i'm doing.

       good morning.   today=staying at home. amanda is coming over around one. i hope she can go to the beach with me and isabel tomorrow. but her mom said, "we'll see." so who knows.   last night rachelle, bethany, andrea, and her friend megan came over. we played bs. let me tell you, this girl megan was pissing me off. i mean, she was kind of funny, but it annoyed me so much that my parents let her go into our house when none of us knew her. she's a stranger. i don't know, maybe i'm being territorial. but i couldn't wait for her to leave. whew.   i'm hungry and i want a muffin.   coffee would be nice, too.

       went to newport today. hence the title. we took a tour of the most gorgeous mansion. actually, all of them are beautiful. i wish i could spend a day there, and feel important and rich. i think that would be so much fun.   then out to lunch at brick alley pub. the nachos were delicious.   thennn a little bit of shopping. i didn't buy anything. i only had $21. i plan to save it for providence place.   anyway, amanda and i are getting together soon...hopefully friday, and she and isabel and me will go to the beach. woot. i hope she can go. i miss her. i haven't seen her since school first let out.   alissa is bitching because she has to get her wisdom teeth out. i can't stand it. i bet i've been through more oral pain than she has in her lifetime. and probably more to come. dumb wimpy bitch.   my glasses are smudged. i must go clean them. adios!

       happy independence day all!  *waves american flag*   pawsox game last night was good. they played really well. i was impressed. i wish my red sox could play that good, but that's just a far-off fantasy now. actually, i'm scared, because even tony now believes that we're cursed. and if he believes it, i'm afraid it might be true. i don't know. my thoughts on that are all over the place.   isabel is coming tomorrow. i feel a little anxious.   anyway, i hope everyone has a fun day!

       i spent around $100 today. oops. but i did really well. i got a lot for my money.     &nbsp;   tonight, i am relaxing. watching spiderman with isabel, and hopefully when keith gets home from work he'll call. or sooner. that would do too.     &nbsp;   i think about him a lot. it's kind of frightening. and the more i think about it, the more right it seems. i'm just terrified that he doesn't feel the same way. i know he likes me, but how much? i wish i knew. but i guess time will tell. i have a feeling that the next time we're together in person, it'll say a lot. i want him to know i like him. but subtly, and...ok, i'm babbling now.     &nbsp;   so. alissa got her license. those of us who read her journal are never going to hear the end of how great she thinks she is.     &nbsp;   driver's ed tomorrow. damn.

       i forgot to mention that i can go to new york! the dates changed to the 30th and 31st, and i'll be finished with driver's ed by then, so i can go! i'm so excited, i've never been before, plus my parents aren't going, which makes it extra special. it'll probably be a little weird, because it's be with all these spanish kids and my spanish kind of sucks, but i'll try anyway.   keith, amanda, and mike were gonna come over monday, but i don't think that'll happen 'cause amanda can't. but another time we're all gonna go down to her land and hang out. i don't think i'm ready to be alone with keith yet. i just feel funny about it. everything's so light right now. i don't want it to get too heavy. plus i'm kind of nervous about him meeting my parents. they tend to dislike my friends.   i'm looking forward to tomorrow night. my parents are going to a concert, and laura is sleeping at a friend's house. woot! :)

       today i'm going to get brave and call keith, because he thinks i'm in new haven for today, and my mom changed the plans so i'm not. so. noontime. that's when i'll do it.   the triple a all-star game was fun. cold, but fun. nothing majorly interesting happened, so i'm not gonna bother writing every little detail in here. man, being vip rocks though. free drinks and food! you've gotta try that.   yesterday me and isabel stayed home. we watched the fellowship of the ring. i like that movie. i've just seen it a million times so sometimes i get sick of it.   this kid keeps me up at night. even when i'm exhausted.

       soooo last night i went to the sunflower cafe with my mom, neighbors, and isabel. can't say i liked it too much. the menu was tiny, and i didn't know what half the things were so, and then the chicken was way too dry. next time we go out to eat with isabel, we are so going to olive garden.   amanda was like, "geez, you guys really like each other, don't you?"   hmmm...yeah.

       um. i just woke up.   last night was the home run derby at mccoy stadium, and it went on forever. seriously. i wanted to die. plus i didn't feel good. i had cramps and shit, so i spent the whole time wanting to go gome. and it was raining. somehow it would have been more bearable if my friends had been there. i dunno why. me and keith are gonna try and convince amanda and mike to go to a game with us. it'd be so much fun. and we could sit on the grass, cause it's more comfortable than the stupid bleachers.   speaking of keith and amanda. amanda called yesterday. i could only talk for 60 seconds, but she did say keith likes me. so i'm not sure what'll happen next. hmm. exciting.   laura was supposed to go to camp today, but it's raining and she has an ear infection. coincidentally, she was fine last night, and she was running around and having a grand time. my parents baby her so much. it's sickening. so wonder she still cries at every little thing and can't do squat for herself.   alright. enough venting. see ya later.

       hahahahaha. i made a wishlist at alloy.com, and there's a ton of stuff on there now. maybe i'll order some shit for my birthday.   omg. i forgot to mention that tony got a brand new truck!! it's a 2004 dodge dakota. i love it. i wish i could ride in it all day. i'm scared to drive it though. i probably never will.   went to some beach area today. i can't even pronounce the name, so i'm not even going to bother trying to spell it. it me, my parents, isabel, and rachelle. we went on go karts (i didn't hit anything for once, i must be getting better), and bumper boats, and these guys kept squirting us. me in particular, for some reason of which i have no idea. i was soaked. oh, and i got my period, which was pleasant. we went out to eat. we just ordered a bunch of appetizers, it was great and i was wicked full. yum. laura was at camp and they called and said she wasn't feeling good, so we had to drag our asses out there to get her. and of course, she's fine now. err. whatever.   going to mccoy for a cookout thing today. i guess it'll be okay. i don't think i'll get to talk to keith or amanda today, but it's alright, i'll be home all day tomorrow. i think as of this moment i need to talk to amanda more. before i get in too deep.   guess i'll leave now. isabel's sleeping on my bed lol. see ya.

       just got back from rachelle's. goddd i am so pissed.   i waited all day for keith to call. it was really weird. i felt like my brain was on fire. i was excited. i came home. he called at around 7:00, and we had been talking for around 40 minutes when tony told me to get off. i explained we were trying to make plans, and he told me i had ten minutes, so i said i'd try to get off. for some reason that made tony mad and i had to hang up on him really abruptly. i felt so awful. i feel so awful. sick, even. luckily i feel a little better now, after chilling with isabel and rachelle, but still...now all i want is for him to call tomorrow.   i must talk to amanda. i have to know if keith likes me. because i feel something. and after what he said yesterday ("i have an interest in you"), i need to know. i need to know everything i've been avoiding and missing. and soon.

       i passed my permit test!!!!!!!! with an 88!!!!!    &nbsp;  i am so happy. i wasn't even that nervous when i took it, and it was easier than some of the quizzes we had in class. so i'm relieved. only i have to wait till my birthday to get my actual permit. which sucks, because i want it now :-( i can't wait till i get my license. not because i'm so anxious to leave home (well, maybe a little), but i want to be able to really do things on my own, or just with a friend, without having to beg my parents to drive me. that will be sweet. according to my calculations, my road test to get my license should be sometime in march.    &nbsp;  oh yeah, i forgot to mention that my car is done. the engine is replaced, but tony wants to fix up some other things too.     &nbsp;  i may go see spiderman 2 tonight. i would really like to with isabel. but i dunno if she wants to or anything. so we'll see.    &nbsp;  last night i slept at jo ann's house. it was sooo fun. her house is so gorgeous, and quincy is the most awesome dog lol. we ate good food and get dressed up for no reason. i didn't wear my homecoming dress. or my semi dress. i wore one of my mom's old costume dresses. it was white and really pretty, but too big. my mom took pictues, and there's one of me that i actually like. there's a miracle for ya. i weighed myself on jo's scale last night, and i was somewhere between 117-119. which i less than i thought, because on amanda's scale, i'm 120 or over. hmm.     &nbsp;  i hope keith calls tonight. for no apparent reason.

       i wonder, is there a difference between loving someone and being in love with someone? just curious.     &nbsp;  i feel good, i guess. different. i hope nothing gets too serious.     &nbsp;  is it possible to say to someone, "i love you but i don't want to be with you"?

       Maybe I've been on the road too long   Living my life through these songs   I guess loving a music man   Really wasn't in your plans   Does it matter if I'm sorry again   And why should I apologize   You knew all along this was my life   You knew my ins and outs   All my fears and doubts   It's the life I love   But it's you I can't live without    &nbsp;  And this whole world seems cold and empty   Someone please turn on the lights   Lord if there's an angel you could send me   I could use one here tonight    &nbsp;  Now where am I supposed to go   My only home was in your soul   I know that I can't stay here   And drown in a pool of tears   Should I pack my pride   And face this life alone    &nbsp;  Maybe it's me who's cold and empty   And in my darkness I can't see the light   Please God if there's an angel you could send me   'Cause there's one missing from my life    &nbsp;  You are my heart you are my soul   Wherever you are that's where I go   You know my ins and outs   All of my fears and doubts   It's the life I love   But it's you I can't live without   Yes it's the life I love   But it's you I can't live without   The life I love   The life I love    But it's you I can't live without

       alright, so keith has been emailing me and i guess i never truly knew how easy it is to say stuff in email until now. because he told me he loves me. and a lot of other things too. i said it back, because in a way i do feel it. i can't help it. i can be myself around him. it's nice. and i guess we can understand each other in some way too. but in another way, i'm a little weirded out. i don't want a relationship right now. i'm sure i'd be perfectly ok being affectionate and all, but that's it. i don't want to be classified as a couple. it'd bother me. that's just how i feel, that's the mood i've been in. i can't help it, and maybe it'll change at some point, and i will want more. i just don't right now. i sent him an email explaining this as best i could. i hope he isn't offended, and i hope things can stay the way they are.    &nbsp;  new haven was fun. urban outfitters is a cool store, i liked a lot of stuff there. too bad i spent all my money at providence place. but hopefully i can go back there at some point with more cash. the architecture in new haven is awesome. me and isabel walked on the green a lot. it was cool seeing yale and all. although at one point we walked by some child molester and he was like "ooh, you're pretty..." talk about frightening.    &nbsp;  must go to waterfires now. adios.

       wow. could i be a bigger bitch?    &nbsp;  nathan just called and told me he found the wallet sized military ball pictures. and all i could think was: could i possibly care less? no, i cannot. he annoys me so much. i don't see how i put up with his crap for so long. i don't think i even said a complete sentence the entire time (about...two minutes) we were on the phone. i just don't want to deal with him. i wish he'd leave me alone.    &nbsp;  haha, yeah, i made my mom call me really loud so i'd have an excuse to get off.    &nbsp;  hey, you've gotta do what you've gotta do.

       sometimes my parents really piss me off.    &nbsp;  tony wants to meet keith, and i don't want him to, because no matter what i do, he doesn't like any of my friends. they're never good enough for him. i swear, i could bring home a saint and tony would still find something wrong. i'm so sick of it. and i don't see why or how he can have such a strong opinion on my friends. he doesn't know them as well as he thinks he does. and if i like them and i get along with them, that should be enough for him. no, my friends aren't perfect. and that's ok. 'cause neither am i.    &nbsp;  another thing. you don't hear me going around saying crap about his friends, even though sometimes i want to. maybe he should keep his opinions on my friends to himself.    &nbsp;  well, that was a nice little vent, wasn't it?

       *sigh*    &nbsp;  yes, i am being pitiful and waiting for keith to call. we talked earlier, but then nikki came over (more on that in a sec), and i got off, and i said call back at 7:00. but he never did. that has never happened before. it's weird. kind of disappointing. but i'm hoping there's still a chance.    &nbsp;  i feel like i'm disappointing him. like i'm not interesting enough all the time. it's a depressing feeling. it's like i like him so much, and it drives me nuts to think that he doesn't feel the same.    &nbsp;  anyway, nikki got her license today so she drove over. we hung out, and then later me, her, and isabel went to taco bell. wow, i never go there. i got nachos, and they were actually halfway decent. mexican food isn't really my style though. but it was funny because all i had was $3 in change. the lady at the register thought i was whacked.    &nbsp;  i'm going to go now. if keith doesn't call tonight, i'll call him tomorrow at noon. ha. what a plan.

       i'm really fighting this jealousy issue i have.    &nbsp;  i know he has told me a million times that he doesn't like amanda. only i just don't understand. she has everything i have and more. why wouldn't he like her? why on earth would anyone choose me over her? i don't get it. i'm serious. i'm not just saying that because i need reassurance. i want to know.    &nbsp;  plus they email and actually hang out, and...i don't know. maybe it's all in my head.     &nbsp;  it's like, even though he may like me, a big part of him will always have feelings for her. and if i'm going to be with him, i can't have that.    &nbsp;  i don't want that.

       You consider me the young apprentice   Caught between the Scylla and Charibdes   Hypnotized by you if I should linger   Staring at the ring around your finger   I have only come here seeking knowledge   Things they would not teach me of in college   I can see the destiny you sold   Turned into a shining band of gold    &nbsp;  I'll be wrapped around your finger   I'll be wrapped around your finger    &nbsp;  Mephistopheles is not your name   But I know what you're up to just the same   I will listen hard to your tuition   And you will see it come to it's fruition    &nbsp;  Devil and the deep blue sea behind me   Vanish in the air you'll never find me   I will turn your face to alabaster   Then you'll find your servant is your master    &nbsp;  And you'll be wrapped around my finger   I'll be wrapped around your finger   You'll be wrapped around my finger   I'll be wrapped around your finger

       remarkably, that driver's ed class wasn't totally useless.     &nbsp;   lunch was fun. i ate with kert and some kid. i keep forgetting his name. they're funny. if the class itself is deathly boring, at least lunch isn't. they keep me laughing.     &nbsp;   after class yesterday we went to canobie lake. it was alright. i'm still working on getting my nerve up to going on a decent rollercoaster. but i went on the other rides with isabel and laura. isabel went on the rollercoaster. damn, i am a wimp.     &nbsp;   i didn't talk to keith all day yesterday. and i think he's in bosron today. ahhhh.

       i will always have issues. no matter what. even when i should be happy, i have problems. i guess i can never be fully content. that's the way it's going to be. i wish it was different, but i can't change myself so easily.    &nbsp;  but i wish i could.

       i am so tired. who knew just shopping and eating could be so exhausting?    &nbsp;  cheesecake factory is the best restaurant. every single dish is so delicious. if i could eat from only one restaurant for the rest of my life, that'd be it. i have leftovers from my lunch too, so i'm looking forward to dinner :-)    &nbsp;  i bought laura's birthday present and a red sox sweatshirt. i feel funny about spending cash from my bank account. it really makes me want a job so i can replace it, and then some.    &nbsp;  thinking is tiring.

       i'm sorry i haven't written a lot lately, but sometimes i'm at a loss for words. things seem to be going well with keith. i like the way things are and i'm not sure i want them to change any time soon. but who knows? who knows how i'll feel even tomorrow? he says the funniest things. i love it so much.     &nbsp;  today i'm going to providence again, and we're eating at cheesecake factory. i'm taking $50 out of the bank. i know i shouldn't because that's money for college, and there is barely any as it is, but i'm going to try not to worry about it. i can replace it whenever my dad pays child support again. but one never knows when that'll be.    &nbsp;  about my moving out. i really don't know. things may be getting a little better, but i don't know. i shouldn't run at the slightest wrong thing that happens here, but sometimes i truly am unhappy. but i guess i'll see how it goes. i still want to try and live with my dad for a bit, if he ever calls or comes around again. like i said before, i feel like i don't know him as well as i should.    &nbsp;  talk to you later.

       dude, the beach rocked! i had a great time. other than this near death experience i had. it involved two huge waves taking me under and me almost losing both my bathing suit bottoms and my glasses. imagine the trauma if that actually happened. i have a bit of a sunburn, but i have hope that it'll turn tan in the end. one never knows. i actually feel pretty decent right now, which is odd. i haven't talked to keith all day *sob* but hopefully he'll call tonight. right now isabel's on the phone with her boyfriend. today's their&nbsp;five months anniversary. awww. &nbsp;&nbsp;

       the idea that i could be in love with keith is so weird!    &nbsp;  i know i feel it. or, i feel something, rather. but who knows what it is? maybe it is just friendship. maybe that's all i'll want us to be. i don't know. time will tell. and i think when we see each other in person, that'll really say what's going on.     &nbsp;  i think that if we are in love, it's good that we fell in love over the phone, for the most part. we did it without making physical contact or seeing each other. i dunno if that's good or bad, but i think it's good. but that's just me.    &nbsp;  my brain is all over the place.

       amanda called. she and i had a long talk, which we haven't done in awhile. she needed to vent and i was glad i was there to listen to her when she needed me. i've been feeling like we were drifting apart. hopefully it won't get worse when she moves. and if her mom says yes, she'll sleep over at some point this week, before isabel leaves. which will be cool.    &nbsp;  i'm sort of pissed right now, because last night when i told tony about how i was unhappy living home, and how i wanted to try and stay with my dad, he took me seriously. i was glad, because it's something i really want to do and something i feel that i need to do. i'm almost 16 years old and i hardly know my father. i think it would be good for us, and maybe it would change things at home. maybe my leaving would make mom and tony realize that something isn't right, and they'd try and make a few changes. i don't know. but today tony was like making jokes about it and stuff, and it made me mad. makes me want to leave more. so i guess i need to talk to my dad about this...but i'm kind of scared to. like i told keith, i'm afraid i'd be a burden to him. keith said, "no, you would never be a burden to him. you're his little girl." which is true. i like the way he put that :)    &nbsp;  saw spiderman 2 with isabel today. great movie. i wanna see it again.    &nbsp;  night.

       i am just so sick of this.    &nbsp;  the more i think about moving out a little while, the better it seems. but i'm scared. scared of what'll happen if i do. even if it's just for a short time.    &nbsp;  i'll write later.
