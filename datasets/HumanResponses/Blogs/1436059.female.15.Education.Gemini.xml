      I was  so  bored today, that I actually started a blog. That's right people, a BLOG!   Anyway, I was going to go and see 'Bend it Like Beckham' at seven on Sunday. The movie was sold out! And it's been out for...lets see, three months? We had to go to the ten oclock showing. It didn't have very much soccer in it, which was the main reason I wanted to see it. We have a soccer game this weekend. Ugh. I really don't care if we win or not. But I do want to win the game next weekend and kick some SAC Twister a...erm, butt!   Went running today. Almost three miles. Was too tired to run any farther. I have Tae Kwon Do tomorrow, and I don't want to go to the Sparring Team class. I hate it. We don't even Spar for goodness sake! I guess now that I've been a black belt for a while Tae Kwon Do has kind of taken a back seat to everything else.  Sheesh. I seriously think our teachers planned all their unit tests on the same day. We had a science test on the Earth's atmosphere, we had a Spanish test on unit 3.3, and we had a drill quiz in Art. Then tomorrow we have a math test on all the Algebraic Geometry we've done in the past few units, and then next week we have a General Music test on Rock-n-Roll, Rock-a-Billy, and Surf Music in the 1900s. Fun. And finals are in two weeks.  The 8th grade dance is on Friday the Thirteenth. What about the kids in our class who are Triskaidekaphobic? Honestly. And they won't even let us have it in the gym, Mrs. Izzo is making us have it in the CAFETERIA! It's so dirty in there after all three lunches it isn't even funny. The janitors clean it and all, but it stinks like no tomorrow in there.   Heather curled her hair today! It was all spiraled and pretty-pretty! We got to talking about this one girl in our school, and she has such long hair that we want to put bubble-gum in it and see if she chops it all off. But that would be mean, says Beth. Yada yada. Bla bla.   Basketball is *evil*. Pure hell is gym class basketball. C'mon, we should at least do some cool sport, like volleyball, track, or soccer. But NO, we do basketball! Mr. Reed makes us walk around the track and dribble with our right hand. Then he says to try it with our left hand. Now, I won't go into detail, but to put it simply, I can't dribble a basketball with my left hand. THEN he told us to dribble left-handed AND jog at the same time. I can't even get walking/dribbling left-handed right, so you can imagine what RUNNING while dribbling left-handed is like for me! It left me begging him to let us play soccer the next class.   Feeling:  Tired. Confident.  Drinking:  Water.  Eating:  Nothing.   Listening to:  Evanescence.   Reading:  Sabriel by Garth Nix. Pretty good book.  Writing:  That Fantasy story for Language Arts that is limited to SIX pages. Honestly. Can she *really* put a limit on imagination? *Smiles innocently*  Procrastinating:  Spanish amd Math homework.

      I had just enough time on the computer today (since we're packin' yo, lol) to take Tea's new DotG test (that stands for Daughters of the Goddess, a Tortallan RPG, www.therogue.net/rpg ). This time its a "What is your Gift color"  This is what I got for me (my real name):        If I lived in Tortall, My Gift Would look like this.      urlLink What's My Gift Color?    This is what I got for my character in DotG (Jaedyn of Owain's Creek):        If I lived in Tortall, My Gift Would look like this.      urlLink What's My Gift Color?    Here's what I got for my BD name (Aylwen):        If I lived in Tortall, My Gift Would look like this.      urlLink What's My Gift Color?    THANK YOU TEA!  Today I don't have enough time to fill out that little thing I always do (Feeling, Eating, Drinking, Writing etc) so I'll do that another time. Seeya!

      Update: Just got the new MB CD. Musically, I don't like it as much as the last one. The lyrics are still pretty good, but I just think overall the CD is too mellow. Or maybe I'm just judging it too quickly. Dunno, just dunno. +Shrugs+  Fave Songs on "Hotel Paper":  1) Are You Happy Now 2) Love Me Like That (Feat. Sheryl Crow) 3) Breathe 4) Tuesday Morning 5) Hotel Paper  I'd say about a three and a half out of five stars. Just not as good as the first album. It's pretty good though. Love the lyrics though. Thoughtful. I'll do better though when I'm famous *grins* I know ya'll will just love my CDs and buy a ton of them and listen to them over and over again, right?    "Breathe" by Michelle Branch   I've been driving for an hour Just talking to the rain You say I've been driving you crazy And that it's keeping you away  So just give me one good reason Tell me why I should stay 'Cause I don't wanna waste another moment In saying things we never meant to say  And I take it just a little bit I hold my breath and count to ten I've been waiting for a chance To let you in.  Chorus: If I just breathe Let it fill the space between I'll know everything is alright Breathe  Every little piece of me You'll see Everything is alright If I just breathe  Well its all so overrated In not saying how you feel So you end up watching chances fade And wondering what is real  And I give you just a little time I wonder if you realize That I've been waiting 'Till I see it in your eyes  Chorus  So I whisper in the dark Hoping that you'll hear me Do you hear me?  Chorus  Everything is alright if I just breathe I've been driving for an hour Just talking to the rain.

      Today Michelle Branch's new CD Hotel Paper came out. I usually don't listen to that kind of music (pop) but I like the lyrics to all of Branch's old songs, so I'll probably go out and get it tonight. But Target probably won't have it. I don't get it. They have tons of Harry Potter copies (which sold out before I could get a copy for mom and me to share) but they usually don't have the new CDs until about a month after they come out. Sheesh.   I've been drawing a lot lately. My book gives me inspiration to draw evil Pirate characters. *Don't Ask*.    "Are You Happy Now" by Michelle Branch   No, don't just walk away Pretending everything's okay And you don't care about me, yeah.  I know its just no use When all your lies become your truths And I don't care yea yeah yeah.  Could you look me in the eye And tell me that you're happy now Would you tell it to my face Or have I been erased Are you happy now? Are you happy now  You took all there was to take And left me with an empty plate And you don't care about it, yeah.  And I, I'm giving up this game And leaving you with all the blame 'Cause I don't care, yeah yeah yeah  Could you look me in the eye And tell me that you're happy now Would you tell it to my face Or have I been erased  Are you happy now  Are you happy now Are you happy now  Are you happy now  Yeah yeah yeah  Do you really have everything you want You can only give something you regret You can't run away from yourself  Could you look me in the eyes And tell me that you're happy now...  C'mon tell it to my face  Or have I been replaced Are you happy now? Yeah yeah yeah yeah oh  Would you look me in the eye? Could you look me in the eye?  I've had all that I can take I'm not about to break 'Cause I'm happy now, ooh.  Are you happy now?     Feeling:  Bored. I also feel like drawing again.  Drinking:  What's new here? Let me wake you up when I'm drinking something besides water, K?  Eating:  Nada.   Listening to:  "Your Song" Ewan McGregor from Moulin Rouge.  Reading:  So yeah, I'm waiting for my vacation so I can read...STILL  Writing:  My novel, duh!  Procrastinating:  I dunno. Oh yeah! I've gotta call Evan! Oh, Evan, if you're reading this, sorry I forgot last night! I was watching Rat Race! Y'know, the movie with the narcoleptic spaniard?

      Yeah, haven't posted in a while.   Well, last friday was the last day of school, which I thought was really fun. At lunch our table had a feast! Melissa brought two cans of pringles, Andrea's mom made her famous chocolate-vanilla powdered cookies, someone's mom made M&M cookies, I brought Fruit Punch for drinks, and Heather and Jake brought a bunch of cheeto bags. The teachers picked up after us routinely during the lunch time because they were afraid we would start a food fight (which Evan and Daniel almost did, so I guess the teachers were right). Then we had our awards ceremony.   They had the usual awards like the ones for all A's or all A's and B's. Then they had the ones for foreign language with like "Most fluent" or whatever. Then our team (the Rock Stars, corny I know, I didn't pick it though soo...) teachers went up and gave out more "Personal" awards.   Winner of "Best Laugh" = Brett (LoL!) Winner of "Best Voice" = Of course....DANIEL. Told you he would. Winner of "Most likely to be a Lawyer" = Anisha Winner of "Most likely to be an Astronaut" as in, their head is always in the clouds = Season. Which I thought was hilarious since she is such a ditz. Winner(s) of "Most independant fashion statements" = Catie, Jill, and Courtney. Winner of "Most Diplomatic" = Matt. LoL.   And there were a bunch of others.   On Saturday I was really sick with strep, so I was just hanging around the house a lot. I felt equally horrible on Sunday, but I still went to clean out and paint my room. Today Shelb and I went swimming in our pool, which was blown up lopsided so Dad has to unfill, move, then refill tomorrow night. I also made hot dogs for lunch without hurting myself! WHOOT!   Feeling:  I feel like singing. But I don't want to scare Shelby out of the house so...  Drinking:  Water.   Eating:  M&Ms  Listening to:  "Are You Happy Now" by Michelle Branch  Reading:  I can't wait until our sixteen-hour drive to MN and MI. Then I'll be able to start reading another book.  Writing:  RPG posts.  Procrastinating:  Giving Alex her B-day present. I've had it since the Sunday before her b-day. I was going to give it to her on Wed. her B-day, but I didn't have a bag so I just said I would give it to her at her party.  Then the morning before her party I get strep, and I call her and she's just like "Okay whatever." I don't think she wanted me to go anyway, and I didn't really want to either since we're not exactly friends at all and her mom probably made her invite me. So then while I'm downstairs trying to sleep, someone calls and Shelby picked up the phone. These two girls were coughing and laughing and talking in fake raspy voices and saying "Oh we're sick, we have strep!" and then they stopped and they asked Shelby if we had caller ID. Shelb said "No, but there is such a thing as *69" and they hung up. My mom did press *69 and it turned out to be Brittany's cell number. So my mom called Alex's home phone. Mom said "Hey Alex, this is Alex right?"  "No, this is Brittany, but I'll get Alex for you." so then Alex comes on the phone. My mom goes "Hey, I just wanted to wish you a happy birthday, and say that Mallory can't come since she has strep and I don't want you all to catch it. By the way, did you just call here?"  Alex gets real quiet and just says no. So my mom says goodbye and tells me everything when I wake up for lunch. I think it's hilarious since Alex and I really don't even like each other anymore. So now I'm tempted not even to give her the present that is supposed to congratulate her supposed maturity and new age. But I know my mom will make me give it to her anyway. Oh well.

      *Cries*  This was the last day of a lot of things. This was my very last day of Middle School chorus after three years. This was my last day of P.E. in Middle School after three years. This was my last day of Spanish w/ Señora Rivera, and my last day of Science with Mrs. Ward. Mrs. Ward said that she, Ms. Fecher, Mrs. Weigand, and Mrs. Malchester had come up with really cool categories for awards tomorrow. Cool. Mrs. Ward and Señora Rivera both said that our 8th grade class of 2003 was, out of all their years teaching, the classes filled with the most personalities. I have to believe them.   Daniel WILL win "Best Voice" because Mrs. Ward likes his voice...  *Cue Music*   We've come such a long long way Now the waiting is over We've shared our dreams And now it seems  That time...has slipped away  We leave you with a smile You're the ones who made it all worth while As we're walking down the aisle We leave you... With a smile  And now we near the end                           Near the end And say goodbye to all our friends There'll always be Sweet memories When we look back across the years  We leave you with a smile You're the ones who made it all worth while As we're walking down the aisle We leave you... With a smile  We leave you...with a smiiiiiiiiiiiiiiile     Feeling:  My leg hurts. And I'll miss Middle School.  Drinking:  The usual (Erm, water...duh)  Eating:  M&Ms  Listening to:  This guy on the history channel...he is talking about Theodore Roosevelt.  Reading:  My dad won't let me start reading another book. He wants me to save them for the trip to Grandma's since it will be a REALLY long drive from Maryland to Minnesota.  Writing:  Birthday cards.  Procrastinating:  Everything.

      Update:  Life stinks. Real bad. I seriously pulled my hamstring at Tae Kwon Do, and now  my whole right leg feels like Jelly. This stinks.   Grand Master Bai wanted to give me something to make it feel less sore before my dad came, so he handed me this little patch thingy. He said something to the affect of "Put where hurt." He's Korean, and although his son Master Bai has slightly better English it is kind of hard to understand either of them. So I just kind of nodded. Then I saw that all over the back of the patch were Korean letters and stuff. The patch is really tingly. Weird.  I'm such a klutz. Just when I thought things couldn't get bad or worse...GO FIGURE! Cue the Alanis Morrisette music! *Plays 'Ironic'*   An old man turned ninety-eight He won the lottery and died the next day It's a black fly in your Chardonnay It's a death row pardon two minutes too late Isn't it ironic... don't you think  (chorus) It's like rain on your wedding day It's a free ride when you've already paid It's the good advice that you just didn't take And who would've thought it figures  Mr. Play It Safe was afraid to fly He packed his suitcase and kissed his kids good-bye He waited his whole damn life to take that flight And as the plane crashed down he thought "Well, isn't this nice." And isn't it ironic ... don't you think  It's like rain on your wedding day It's a free ride when you've already paid It's the good advice that you just didn't take And who would've thought it figures  Well life has a funny way of sneaking up on you When you think everything's okay and everything's going right And life has a funny way of helping you out when You think everything's gone wrong and everything blows up In your face  A traffic jam when you're already late It's like 10,000 spoons when all you need is a knife It's meeting the man of my dreams And then meeting his beautiful wife And isn't it ironic... don't you think A little too ironic.. and yeah I really do think...  It's like rain on your wedding day It's a free ride when you've already paid It's the good advice that you just didn't take And who would've thought it figures  Well life has a funny way of sneaking up on you And life has a funny, funny way of helping you out Helping you out Helping you out

         wants to huggle     urlLink DotG Random Hookups    Jaedyn is my character in DOTG. Those nifty avatar things were made by TEA the same person who made the ever-popular FUZZIES! THANK YOU TEA.  *Ahem* Well, not much has happened. Today was the first day of early dismissals. Only two days left of school. I passed all my finals! WHOOT! I got a B on science w/ an 88%, but the scantron thing screwed up so I actually have about a ninety-two, but Mrs. Ward only changed the Exam grade of people where it would've affected their final grade. I had an 85 on my Spanish final, which is a LOT better than I thought I would do...but Señora Rivera curved it since so many people were one point from passing and thus I have a 89.5, to be raised by the MUY INTELLIJENTE Y SIMPATICA Señora Rivera. All the rest were A's of different degrees, and despite the fact that I about killed myself studying for Science, I'm pretty happy.  Finished Abhorsen by Garth Nix. Everyone said it wasn't as good as Sabriel, but I thought all three of them were awesome. In order of most favorite to least:  1) Sabriel (1st in the series) 2) Abhorsen (3rd in the series) 3) Lirael (2nd in the series)  Good books. NOW IF YOU DON'T GO OUT AND CHECK OUT/ BUY THESE BOOKS I WILL SIC MOGGET/YRAEL AFTER YOU!   Oh yeah, HOTEL PAPER comes out TUESDAY, JUNE 24TH!   I'm doing a lot of advertising, aren't I?   Feeling:  I HAVE SUCH A BAD HEADACHE RIGHT NOW!! Gah. I'm also pretty relieved testing is over. Incredibly Tired = Me.  Drinking:  Water.  Eating:  Recees Peanut Butter Cups, Yum.  Listening To:  Evanescence...AGAIN  Reading:  I just finished Abhorsen about twenty minutes ago.   Writing:  My great American Novel. Oh yeah.   Procrastinating:  Sleeping.   P.S.

      Hey! Yesterday BW gave me a Personal Title! What do you think about " The Melody of Misery "? Cool, huh?   Still. Finals are this week and next. That sucks. We got yearbooks on Monday though, so I'm happy. About half of the 8th grade has signed mine, and a few sixth graders and I think one seventh grader. I don't like sevies so that's okay.   We had a fire drill during 8th period, then we also had a locker clean-out in the same class. And we also had to send someone to go get Newsletters during...you guessed it, the same class. The locker clean out was good for me at least because I swear I haven't seen the bottom of my locker since August. There was a whole binder down there that I haven't used since October. Weird.   Ugh. Season signed Heather's YB. She wrote (direct quote):   Hey Heather! It was nice getting to know you! Stay nice! Keep this autograph for when I am famous! ~Season!   Yeah. Uh-huh. Well, yesterday after school, I heard that Clayton threw a pencil at Season that was full of wet glue and it got stuck in her hair. Heather said she was fussing about it for the rest of the Spanish Review. I wish I had stayed after to see it!   Mrs. Fetcher still hasn't given back our Sci-Fi/Fantasy short stories yet. I want to see what grade I got. It was about a pirate who attacks her hometown because the people used to make fun of her because her magic was the ability to smell Quality Cheese and tell when someone last washed his or her socks. But (obviously, its so cliche) the heroines save the day by thinking of a clever way to divert and in then end, kill the pirate.  Cool, huh?   Feeling:  Right now, I feel like writing. And editing, can't forget editing. I also feel tired. I always feel tired. I never sleep. (  Drinking:  Water (I know, I'm getting so predictable)  Eating:  Pringles.  Listening to:  I'd Rather Be in Love, By Michelle Branch.  Reading:  Abhorsen by Garth Nix.  Writing:  Music.  Procrastinating:  Sleeping.

      ((Note: This was written on June 5th, but blogger was being stupid so I'm posting it now))  Yeah! Happy Birthday to me!   Shelby made me breakfast...now, you can only imagine the shock that came with that. I wore the shirt she gave me for my present to school, and my dad drove us all. Heather said she was broke and couldn't get me a gift, but that she'd bring money to the mall Saturday and let me pick something out. Sweet.   In Chorus we started watching  West Side Story . The outline Sharp gave us makes it sound really stupid, and I wonder if it really is.   Ahh, then in Language Arts we talked about  The Giver,  which I've already read and think it is totally bogus. The only part I agree with is the theme that perhaps some people really   are   too stupid to make the right decision.   In History, Melissa and Carly wished me happy b-day, and Alex gave me a gift! It was bagged in a cool Garfield bag, and it was this little makeup kit thingy, and a few pairs of nifty socks. LoL. And Melissa counted down the minutes till my real bithday (11:09 AM), and when it came she leapt out of her chair and screamed, "HAPPY BIRTHDAY, MALLORY!"  In Math, blah. Nada.  At lunch...wait...blah, nada again.   Right before gym started, Brandon asked me to the 8th grade dance! I know Brandon is kind of geeky and stuff, but he really is a nice guy, and I seriously would have gone with him "as friends" or whatever if he had asked me one week sooner. But Heather and I had already planned an  Anti-Dance, Non-Conformist Alternative to the Corny 8th Grade Dance  night out.   In gym we played partner dodgeball. Fun. Except for the fact that as soon as Heather and I made it to second base, the people who came after us got out, making three outs! Man! And we were so happy after getting to first base, we even made it to second!   Ahh, in science we talked about tides. Mrs. Ward walked up to me and whispered, "Happy Birthday, Mallory!" Next to her, Matt was like, "ITS YOUR BIRTHDAY?!?!?!" and everyone hears and starts chorusing, "Happy birthday Mallory!"  Then they sang happy birthday to me in Spanish...in Spanish. Fun!   I went running after school, three miles around the neighborhoods. Then I went home, took a shower, and got ready for going out for dinner. My parents have made it a tradition to go out to dinner for anyone's birthday. We went to Red Lobster, despite the fact that my whole science class thinks there is a correlation between the high cancer rate in MD and our closeness/"love" to/of seafood.   Then I came home, and ate some cake! I called Heather and made plans for this weekend. We're going to go see Bruce Almighty on Saturday, then go to Sakuro's Hibachi Grill.   Our last soccer game is this weekend. Cool.   Oh yea! And there is this Sports Center a little ways away, and apparently they're hiring for summer jobs for teenagers helping out children's Sports Camps. One of them was for Tae Kwon Do, and I'm going to look into it. Mom said they were only looking for ages 15-17 though, but she thinks that since I'm a blackbelt in Tae Kwon Do they might make an exception. I mean, seriously, it's a good alternative to babysitting. That was my other option, but since Breana is babysat by Amanda, and Emerick hates me (but he likes my sister apparently, because he only doesn't like "Big Girls!" Direct quote), working with kids doing  'my'  sport sounds like...dare I say it...fun!   Feeling:  Older. Hopefully Wiser. Tired.  Drinking:  Water.   Eating:  Leftover Birthday Cake.  Listening to:  I know I usually listen to Rock/Punk, but ever since she came out in 2001, I've loved Michelle Branch's music. I had never,  ever  heard Everywhere before, and still, when I heard it in the mall one night, I somehow knew the words. I've loved her music ever since. So now, since my friend's dad is in the business, I've got an early copy of  Hotel Paper  to listen to.  Reading:  Lirael by Garth Nix. Still.   Writing:  Music.  Procrastinating:  Everything. Okay, maybe not everything, but a lot of things.

      Errr, yeah. Hi.   Uhh, we won that soccer game 2-1, and now our team has 'bragging rights' or whatever. I know if the other team had won, they'd be living it up but our team is 'too humble' and no one has even mentioned the game at school. Oh well. But I almost killed three players during the game. I swear, I'm the only one on either team who thinks people shouldn't get called for pushing, but maybe that's because I unconsiously do that every game. Apparently, as the one girl calls it, I 'side tackled' her. Another girl, I was trying to take the ball from her and we both ran into my team's sweeper, Nora. As I tripped, I kicked the other girl who was falling to, in the eye. Now she has a black eye and Nora says she had her leg tested and it is bruised in five places.   Every singe final except for math is on the THIRTEENTH! Thats FRIDAY, the 13th!! Honestly, there are at least two people I know who have triskaidekaphobia! Not to mention the fact that for midterms they spaced them out! Mrs. Weigand says the History test will be killer, but I don't think so. It's on all the things that happened after the signing of the constitution. Can't be that hard. Still, Melissa thinks the only ones anyone is going to pass are Language Arts and Math. Spanish. Will. Kill. Us. All.  In other news, the school dance was canceled for about three days and a weekend, and I didn't find out until Monday. Now they've put it back on. And now they're raising lunch prices for next year. Our county sucks. It's not the kids fault the food costs so much! Oh well. Maybe next year they won't have the price raise in the high school.   Basketball is STILL EVIL, but we're starting floor hockey tomorrow. In art, well...I have no idea what we're doing in art. General Music class is so boring, I think everyone just sleeps during it. We just learned about DISCO AND ABBA!    You are the dancing queen  Young and sweet only seventeen  See that girl, watch that scene  Diggin the dancing queen!    I swear, leave it to Mrs. Zeigler to make you fall asleep.   Feeling:  Exhausted. Sick.  Drinking:  Water  Eating:  I just ate pancakes. Yum.  Listening to:  Ahhh, mix.   Reading:  Lirael by Garth Nix. Another good book. So far.  Writing:  Gah. Posts for BD and DOTG. But I haven't been online for those two in a while. They'll kill me. Tea and Emmie and Margery will kill me. I'M SORRY AIKO, TANIS, AND CELESTIA!!!  Procrastinating:  Taking Jaedyn to Tanis' party. Busy Busy.  Bye. School.

      OMG! I was at six flags today...it was really boring (derr) except for I got into a fight with some stranger. I was there with my dad, Shelb, Meghan, Brad, and meesh. meesh and I went on this little spinny kinda ride that had cows for the seats. While we were waiting for the ride to start, one of the game koisks was playing some rap song (like I would know what the hell they were saying...::rolls eyes:: ). The girls across from our cow were waving their arms like they were eminem or something it was soo funny, and I know it sounds stupid now but it was hilarious when meesh and I saw it. meesh was like, "Holy sh!t, its the winner of the million dollar America's Funniest Home Video award!"   The 'rap' girls in the cow noticed we were laughing at them and one of them (who had really nappy blond hair and was wearing a bandaid on her cheek) sneered at us and screamed "BOO!"  "Yeah! We're really scared 'cause of your mask!" meesh screamed back. *snickers* meesh is so cool. Then of course, I *had* to add, "Oh wait, it isn't a mask!" of course. Stupid, yes, but classic, ne?  I GOT AIM REINSTALLED! Hallelujah! I've erased all these old s/n (paula, alex, hannah, erica...) but people who I don't know (or don't want to know) keep IMing me. But at least I can still talk to soccer friends, dotg peoples, bd peoples, and sheroes. That's cool. Besides, I love my new away messages! LoL. I HAVE DEDICATED A HIPPO AWAY MESSAGE TO *YOU* EMMIE, I HOPE YOU'RE HAPPY! LoL.   Meghan is leaving tomorrow. YEAH! I can't wait. Mom says I should go and see her off, but I really don't want to. I hope she has fun in D.C. since all she did while she was here all she did was complain about Brad. Oh well. I hope she has fun when she goes back home and then she'll be stuck with all three of her brothers! Brad has a twin...lol.   Ugh. MD is so boring during the summer. I see my friends a lot but there is never anything to do around here. Oh well...again...I saw the Constellation last week though, an old Civil War battleship. That was kind of cool. Except that the ceilings were a bit too low for my mom so she couldn't come below deck with me, Brad, Meg, and meesh.  My mom got back from here weekend work trip to Cali on...what was it...SUNDAY! She brought us all T-shirts from China-town. They're in my (and my moms...like mother like daughter...) favorite colors! Ten bucks to the person who guesses it first... (*hint*Black and Red*hint*)  Tryouts are the fifteenth! I'm so ready! If I don't make soccer, no big deal. Keneisha, mom, and meesh all say I should just try out for cross country anyway since I'm a runner. I lurrrve running. Those are the only sports I'm really good at....soccer, track/cross country, and Tae Kwon Do. I am *not* hand-eye coordinated, but I can do any sport that heavily involves footwork.   Speaking of TKD, I had a great practice tonight...just thought I'd mention it...being a black belt rocks...we get to learn all the awesome kicks.   Sundae is such a cutie pie! Everyone mixes *her* up with Midnight, but I don't blame them. We made her an indoor cat after what happened to Middie. But she is soooooo like him its not even funny. She gets along with GenGen well...   Feeling:  Tired I guess.   Drinking:  Water...what else is new? My mom has banned pop until I get my brackets off, and I just don't care for anything but water and milk besides pop. STOP MAKING FUN OF ME BECAUSE I SAY POP!!! (Random spasms, eh?)  Eating:  Yumm. Mexican rice.  Listening to:  "Away From Me" by Evanescence. Not sure which album its from though, since I burned a new CD with my favorites from all their old albums. I could look it up, but all the Evanescence CDs from before  Fallen  are under my bed. I don't want to go there unless its absolutely necessary.  Reading:  Corsairs & Corsets...by several authors that I don't feel like listing right now.   Writing:  Chapter six, so sue me. I know, I know! I need to keep writing! I've planned everything but I just can't write it out!  Procrastinating:  Practicing guitar. I know meesh will be pissed when I get to the rehearsals and I mess up all the time. I need to stop procrastinating...

      I know its early in the morning, but I'm turning nocturnal these days so...I took a bunch of quizzes so I thought I'd post them here out of sheer and utter boredom.    Gray: You poor, depressed child. A rain cloud seems to follow you everywhere. The worst has always got to happen doesn't it? Life is miserable.  urlLink Made by  Sara      urlLink   What color do you see the world in?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla    Oh, that makes me feel wonderful...    You were a brave knight, fighting for the king and dualing other knights in great battles. Perhaps you were a hero in your past life.    urlLink   Who were you in your past life?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla    Ten bucks to the person who e-mails or sends me a PM first explaining that up there...    Big Grin; :-D  applaud my award-winning smile   This quiz was made by Sara (www.saradover.com)    urlLink   What facial expression are you?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla    Oh dear Lord. I can think of several of my friends' reactions to this. Mom would show me a picture (or several) of me making a smile as big as the one up there. Dad and Brad and probably Jake and most likely most of the kids at school who know me would burst out in long fits of laughter. Heather would try pointing out the resemblances, and Hannah would say that's what I look like when I kick someone's ass at TKD.    Damsel in Distress: It's not your fault your always in the wrong place at the wrong time! But hey, the hero always saves you in the end and you live happily ever after.     urlLink Made by  Sara       urlLink   Who do you play in in a typical movie?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla    Shit!

      *Sigh*  I can't wait until Meghan leaves. She makes Psycho Brad seem really nice. Thats really hard to do, by the way. We're going to Six Flags tomorrow, which I really don't want to do. First, I've been there a gazillion times since we moved to Maryland, and after a while it just gets really old. No joke. Second, did you see the news around the last weekend of June? Dude! The Six Flags I've been to *so* many times was on the news because that damn Jokers Two Face ride got stuck with 28 people on it! Now, as cool as I think that is....I'd rather not take my chances with Six Flags' track record of failed rides.  I took all them quizzes Tea and Rosalie (with the accented 'i', I think) made. They're kinda fun when you're super super bored. Which I have been since school ended. All my friends are on vacation, damnit! Anyway, on to the quiz results:  Quiz #1, 'DotG Name Generator' By tea. Not far off from my actual character, except that her name is Jaedyn and she is not De Negacien.   urlLink My DotG name is Jaedyn de Negacien   Quiz #2, 'What Job Would You Have in Tortall?' by tea. This is a joke quiz, btw. We used it when Daughter Alessia gave the students a test to see what they would be when they grew up. Jaedyn wasn't happy to receive this result (but then again, who would be (don't answer that, please!)):      urlLink What Tortallan Career Would I Have?    Quiz #3, 'Which DotG Character Are You?' by Rosalie. Jaedyn wasn't included in this test, so I didn't get hers. Oh well. It was a nifty quiz!      urlLink What DotG Character am I?  By Rosalie   DUDE! Hillaron! Hell yes! He's the DotG charrie I am most like in real life. I am a pyromaniac. I love to experiment with explosive things...and then say it wasn't me! BOOM!  Ahem...anyways...

      Hey! Not much has been going on. Still sick of Meghan but she is leaving on Thursday so its all good. I asked some of my friends (Jake, Jem, and meesh) to fill out this quiz about me. They had to agree on everything. I got this from somewhere...can't remember. I told them I'd fill it out for them later. You're supposed to put percentages of how much you are of that adjective. It doesn't all have to add up to 100% in the end, 'cause there are too many adj. for that, but each adj. has to be ranging from 0-100%. This is what they all put for me:   Wild: 55%  Crazy: 60%  Loveable: 89%  Funny: 90%  Annoying: 40% (After this adj. Jake wrote "Only on some days...")  Psycho: 99% (JemJem said that this isn't always such a bad thing, but I dunno...)  Daring: 50%  Friendly: 75%  Argumentative: 95%  Patient: 0%  Determined: 85%  Creative: 90%  Optimistic: 35%  Happy: 35%  Intelligent: 85%  Bossy: 20% (meesh wrote: "that is your cousin Meghan's job right now...")  Beautiful: Okay, on this one I got two different percentages. Jake put 80%. JemJem and meesh put 75% in a best friend sort of way.   Critical: 65%  Outgoing: 80%  Athletic: 90%  Superstitious: 15%  Curious: 45%  Moody: 67%  Loud: 83%  Passionate: 52%  Obsessive: 40%  Eccentric: 75%  Arrogant: 59% (Gee, thanks JemJem... ;-> )  Studious: 80%  Honest: 67%  Open-Minded: 45%  Talented: 90%  Enthusiastic: 85%  Lively/Active: 75%  Popular: 65%  Chaotic: 100%  Realistic: 85%  Rebellious: 85%  Energetic: 50%  Rough/Tough: 85% (Jake reminds me at this point what Hannah says she thought when she first met me. We were at Karate, and it was back when she was a Black belt and I was just a Red. We were about to spar and Hannah thought "Oh shit. She's gonna kick my ass like she did to that other boy!")  Clumsy: 50%  Spontaneous: 87%  Talkative: 86%  Strong: 75%  Reliable/Loyal: 90%  Independent: 90%  Bright/Bubbly: 60%  Self-Conscious: 70%  Idealistic: 90%  Sarcastic: 85%  Child-like: 60%  Yes, now I see my friend's true colors...   (Just kidding, you know I love you guys!)  HEY! Heather, if you're reading this I want to fill this quiz out with you for you and me! Okay? LoL

      I haven't posted since Monday? Well then...  My psycho neighbor keeps coming over and ringing the doorbell, stealing the mail, and calling on the phone. Brad thinks its hilarious and keeps egging her on. Meg thinks it is extremely freaky and wants Brad to ignore her...which he won't.  We (Me, Brad, & Meg) have been painting my dad's shed for FIVE DAYS! Damnit. It is the job that will never end, and its the job from hell. Thank you. Meg keeps bossing me and Brad around, so we have quit and then rejoined her painting squad on numerous occasions. Mostly because Meg would remind us after we quit that there was good money involved. We still haven't finished.  On Wednesday night some cousins from my moms side (Brad & Meg are from my dad's side) stayed the night. They drove from Michigan to here since their flight leaves at Baltimore-Washington International Airport. It was my Uncle Joe, his daughters Katie & Sarah, Joe's 2nd wife Sue, and Sue & Joe's sons, RJ and Desmond (Desi). They had to go get their passports on Thursday, but then me, Brad, Meg, Katie, and Sarah stayed home alone in the afternoon. It was very funny because my psycho neighbor kept coming to ring the doorbell. We locked all the doors and her dumbass dog still went through the backyard (since the psycho neighbor stole our padlock) and pooped all over the place. But that night my dad talked to the psycho neighbor's adoptive mother. She's in trouble now...  That's about it. Oh yeah. Me, Brad, Meg, & my dad went to see Lara Croft 2 today. It sucked. Don't go see it, its not worth the time. Honest. Pirates of the Carribean was better...Savvy?

It only lasts 24 shampoos though. I used to have natural blond streaks near my face, while the rest of my hair was brown. Now, thanks to...nevermind, I can't remember the stupid brand of dye. Anyway, now my hair is chocolate brown instead of mousey brown, and those damn streaks turned wine red. Next time I'm either going for red or black...LoL.  Also on Sunday my old friend Chelsea came over with her mom and her sister Martea. She has changed a lot since she moved to Hawaii. A LOT. She's scary now. I know I have a lot of rocker or 'punk' buddies at school, but...she cuts herself...and she...she is suicidal. And her whole entire life revolves around anime characters (that are usually gay guys that look like girls). Chelsea is so different now...  SOCCER CAMP IS AWESOME! Its not one of thoses sissy and wussy camps. We get dirty, we sweat, we work hard...not to mention get a head start for the soccer tryouts for High School in a month. Its so freakin awesome. It goes from Monday-Friday and lasts from 8AM to 12PM. The ages allowed to go are from 9 to incoming 9th graders, but most of the kids there are incoming 9th graders. There are about 47 kids there, and only seven of the girls and fifteen of the boys are from South (my old Middle School). Most of them are the kids and siblings of kids from North (the other Middle School that is connected to my old Middle school...got it? LoL). We have mini-teams, each with four or five kids on them, and there are six boy mini teams and five girl mini-teams. I'm on girl mini-team five, which has a record of 0-0. Go Losers! Go us! Then there are big teams, with 8-10 people on them. There are two girls' big teams, each with 10 girls on them. They're called USA and China; I'm on USA. There are three boys' big teams, each with nine or so boys on them, called Brazil, Columbia, and Ukraine. Whichever boy team wins the tournament in their boy division goes against the girl division winner. Its awesome.  What else? Not much else, really. Seeya.

      Evanescence rocks my world.   Okay, so maybe thats a little much, but hey, Amy Lee kicks ass. She represents the kind of person I want to be...successful and awesome without being a slut like Britney Spears. Amy doesn't need to stoop down to Britney's level (stripping and dressing like she can't afford extra fabric) to be successful and Amy is the best. Her voice is so beautiful even if she is screaming out. I've been a fan of Evanescence since before their album Origin came out, and I'm so glad they made it and Amy and Ben are doing what they were born to do.     Missing by Evanescence   Please, please forgive me, But I won't be home again. Maybe someday you'll have woken up, And barely conscious, you'll say to no one: "Isn't something missing?"  You won't cry for my absence, I know - You forgot me long ago. Am I that unimportant...? Am I so insignificant...? Isn't something missing? Isn't someone missing me?  [Chorus] Even though I'd be sacrificed, You won't try for me, not now. Though I'd die to know you love me, I'm all alone. It's too late now. Isn't someone missing me?  Please, please forgive me, I won't be home again. I know what you do to yourself, Shudder deep and cry out: "Isn't something missing? Isn't someone missing me?"  [Chorus]  And if I bleed, I'll bleed, Knowing you don't care. And if I sleep just to dream of you And wake without you there, Isn't something missing? Isn't something...  [Chorus]

      My carpet is wet.  Why?  I live in a walled-off, warm, cozy room in the basement. While I was at Tae Kwon Do last night, the huge storm that passed over Central Maryland and many other places beside flooded my city. Flooded. Since the law states that every bedroom has to have two emergency escape routes, and I'm underground, I have one door leading upstairs and one door leading to a stairwell outside in my backyard. That damn backyard door leaked water into my room. Dammit.  I'm totally done wallowing in my self-pity for now, because I got to sleep in this morning. I am becoming a night bird. I continually stay up past midnight and one oclock to wait for someone on the BDs to post, and the next morning I sleep in until twelve noon.   Gramma is getting better, but she finds out this Sat. when she starts chemo.   I saw Pirates of the Carribean last night. It was an AWESOME movie. I loved Jack Sparrow (Depp), and how he walked, talked, and planned like he was perpetually drunk. Awesome. Orlando Bloom was alright, but I didn't care for him much. CAPTAIN Jack Sparrow ROCKS MY WORLD! J/K. :-)

      *Sobs*  Gramma has cancer.  I told you she went into surgery right? They found cancer. She's still in the hospital, apparently. My father knew but he didn't even tell me or Shelby until last night.  We were watching " Last Comic Standing " and a commercial for  Pirates of the Carribean  came on. Dad and I are going to go see it tonight, but my mom asked me if I would rather wait until cousins Brad and Meghan came to visit in two weeks. Then my dad said he wasn't sure if we would still be meeting them if "something happened."  Then my mom asked him if "This was something you had discussed with the kids."   Shelby and I were both chorusing "What? What? Tell me!"  "Gramma has cancer."  Now, I have no idea what he meant about "something happening" but I don't think it is good. Now both dad's parents have cancer. Aunt Theresa, Kassie, and Ben are taking care of Grandpa. I'm scared. I love Gramma...I love her house, I love her pancakes (panercookins), I love her smile, I love her laugh, I love her rice crispie treats....and I love her.  *Sobs*

      Whoot! I'm back from Vacation! Hell yeah!  On Friday, June 27th, my parents and sister and I drove 18 hours from Central Maryland to Winona, Minnesota where my dad's family lives. We stayed in a Holiday Inn that has a really nice pool (that I didn't swim in this year for some reason...can't remember why). On Saturday we just kinda visited with everyone and played cards a lot. Don't go to visit my dad's family unless you can deal cards really quickly or play cribbage and count your cards correctly. Up there its hard core card playing! LoL.   On Sunday we did the same for most of the day. Shelby beat me at BS and King's Corner all day. That night me, Shelby, my parents, Aunt Kim, and cousin Faith went to see some movies 'cause we were all kinda bored. At least I was kinda. My mom and I went to see  Alex & Emma  while everyone else went to see  Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle. Alex & Emma  was about a writer who falls in love with his sternographer (sp? someone who types out everything in code). Mom and I were the only two in the theatre!  On Monday we went to a place where there were a ton of hand-crafted and hand-made toys and a whole carosel made of these awesome carved animals. We also played mini-golf. It was awesome. On Tuesday we went horse-back riding. I had a pretty brown mare named Dixie. We went on a trail that went uphill and I was so freaked out that the horse would go over the edge and take me with her! LoL. On Wednesday we said goodbye to my Grandparents who were about to leave for my grandpa's doctor appointment. He has cancer and needs to get medicine every Wednesday.  Then we left and drove 8 hrs to get to Gwinn, Michigan. On the way, my dad got a ticket in Wisconsin for speeding to get past some slow driver. It's one-way traffic up there so the police guy fined him extra. In Wisconsin we also stopped at a cheese store where I asked the lady at the counter if the cheese was quality as stated in the Quality Cheese Act of 2003. She looked at me like I was crazy, but I don't blame her.  Now, Gwinn is a  really  small town. They don't have air conditioning usually. They have no fast-food restaurants at all, but they do have a sit-in pizza parlour and an ice cream shop. Population: 1,500. We stayed in the Red Fox Inn at a closed-down Military Base about five miles away from Gwinn. My grandmother's and Aunt Nora's house (connected) were filled up since my Uncle Joe's family (Aunt Sue, RJ, Desi, Katie, & Sara) and my Aunt Lucy and my Uncle Glenn would be staying there.  On Thursday me, Shelb, Dad, & Mom went to the nearest city (Marquette) and looked around all the shops. The guy at a guitar/music store yelled at me when I tried to pick up and play one of the guitars, saying that the natural oils from my hands would rust the strings. Now, I have two guitars and have had them for a long time, and the strings on them sure as hell don't look rusted! Later on Thursday we went and picked up my Uncle Glenn from the Airport.  On Friday (4th of July) we all went down to the park in Gwinn to celebrate Independance day. Every year they have a little fair hosted by the VFW (Veterans of Foreign Wars) and the Fire dept on alternating years. This year it was the Fire dept. Shelby and I won $93 with these rip-ticket things. At night on Friday we went down to the lake and campground my Great-Uncle Norm Meden owns (Meden's Eden, LoL) and my dad set off fireworks with my 2nd cousin Andre.   On Saturday...erm...what did we do on Saturday...oh yeah! Okay, we went to this mountain called Sugarloaf where you can climb to the top where there is a little overhang where you can look at Lake Superior. Shelby, Katie, RJ, and I went the "Difficult" trail (one without a trail, LoL, we literally went rock climbing) while Aunt Lucy and my mom went the easy way where there were steps to climb. Then we went down to the break wall nearby on Lake Superior and skipped rocks.   On Sunday morning we all left Michigan to drive almost 20 hours to Maryland again. It shouldve only taken 16 hours but the Pennsylvania turnpike was hell. People would stop just to watch a trucker get a ticket or stop to watch a family pee in the bushes.   So now I'm home again!   Feeling:  Happy. LoL. 'Nuff said.  Drinking:  RC cola! Something besides WATER! Halleluja!  Eating:  Blueberry muffins  Listening to:  "Someday I'll Fly Away" Moulin Rouge Soundtrack.  Reading:  RPGs  Writing:  Catch-up RPG posts  Procrastinating:  Sending a "Get Well" card to my Grandma, who is in surgery.  G'Night MD! IT FEELS SO GOOD TO BE HOME!

       Away From Me    I hold my breath as this life starts to take its toll I hide behind a smile as this perfect plan unfolds But oh, God, I feel I've been lied to Lost all faith in the things I have achieved and  I have woken now to find myself In the shadows of all I have created I'm longing to be lost in you Away from this place I have made Won't you take me away from me?  Crawling through this world  As this ease flows through my veins I look into myself But my own heart has been changed I can't go on like this I loathe all I've become  I, I've woken now to find myself In the shadows of all I have created I'm longing to be lost in you Away from this place I have made Won't you take me away from me?  Lost in a dying world I search for something more I have grown so weary of this lie I live and  I, I've woken now, to find myself In the shadows of all I have created I'm longing to be lost in you Away from this place I have made Won't you take me away from me  Away from me Away from me From me From me   Yeah, I'm in the Moody Music mood. I'm so incredibly bored, that I've gone through my room and thrown out everything that I have no more need of. I've found things from when I first moved here seven and a half years ago and I found stuff from when I first moved into the basement three and a half years ago. I can't wait until school on Tuesday. Ninth grade is kind of boring, but its a lot better than being grounded at home. What really sucks is that I'm looking at three more weeks of punishment and yet Hannah, who did the real dirty work that got me in trouble in the first place, gets off doing nothing. Her parents probably don't even know about what happened! So I'm the one in trouble. No worries though, Hannah, I just love being on punishment. *snickers*  I've become a fan of Coldplay. At first I really didn't like their music. The first song of theirs that I heard, "Clocks", pissed me off because they stole "my" beat. Not that it was copywrited or anything. But any of my best friends could tell you that before that song came out I was drumming my hands to that beat. That's a stupid reason for not liking them, though, I know. My other reason was for the same reason I dislike the Dave Mathews (sp?) Band. Their music was too mellow. But later on, when I heard "The Scientist" I realized that their music wasn't truly mellow, it was just...well, heartfelt and honest. Full of sincerity and angst without having to cuss and strum power chords. Beauty. That is how I recently (yesterday, actually) started actually liking Coldplay. SHUT UP!! DON'T LAUGH AT ME LIKE THAT!! LoL.  I've also recently realized that I really don't mind different styles of music. No, I don't adore Rap (Go Shawty, Ish yo Birfday...what the hell is that?), and I don't swoon for pop (Dirrrrrrty...what the...), but I really don't diss it like I used to. I've become so used to it (especially 50, since he's all over the place) that I don't mind it. But my heart still stays with Alternative and Classic rock. Thank God for that.   I also find it hilarious that Avril Lavigne, the so-called Punk Rawk Princess, was nominated for the POP award at the MTV Video Music Awards. She so adamantly calls her music "Hard Core Punk Rawk" that I found it endlessly funny that she was nominated for an award category that also featured such "hated" artists as Christina Aguilera and Britney Spears. I love you, MTV, for showing Avril what she is, but I hate you, MTV, for not showing us Avril's face when she was nominated for a POP award. Really, I don't mind Avril's music, as I've said before, I've become used to the addling little pre-teen wanna-be Avril-ites, but she shouldn't be calling her music rock. I mean, Britney Spears' music stinks, but at least she isn't calling it Rap or Hard Core Metal.   Lately I find myself listening more and more to the guitar parts in music, picking out the notes and chords. I no longer look at a song as a whole, but I rate a song by its lyrics and its guitar chords. Its sincerity. How the singer and performers really feel. Did you  see  Chris Martin's  face   as he sang "The Scientist" in front of the VMA audience? Did you see his passion? What about Michelle branch when she sang "Goodbye to You" live on my birthday last year? Did you hear her youth and her enthusiasm as she sang? What about every single song Linkin Park plays? Do you hear it in their voices?  That , my friends, is what music is really all about.  Here I am, rambling on (no pun intended) about music. What else is there to do?   Now, honestly, I totally despise everything Christina Aguilera stands for, the way she dresses and carries herself, but I can't help but give her some props for "Can't Hold Us Down." Honestly, forget the fact that she's the only white person in the video, and forget her passive (but strong) voice and Lil Kim's appearance in the song/video. Listen to the lyrics closely...   So what am I not supposed to have an opinion Should I be quiet just because I'm a woman Call me a #### cos I speak what's on my mind Guess it's easier for you to swallow if I sat and smiled   When a female fires back Suddenly the target don't know how to act So he does what any little boy will do Making up a few false rumors or two   That for sure is not a man to me Slanderin' names for popularity It's sad you only get your fame through controversy  But now it's time for me to come and give you more to say   This is for my girls all around the world Who've come across a man who don't respect your worth Thinking all women should be seen, not heard So what do we do girls? Shout louder! Letting them know we're gonna stand our ground Lift your hands high and wave them proud Take a deep breath and say it loud Never can, never will, can't hold us down   Nobody can hold us down Nobody can hold us down Nobody can hold us down Never can, never will So what am I not supposed to say what I'm saying Are you offended by the message I'm bringing Call me whatever cos your words don't mean a thing Guess you ain't even a man enough to handle what I sing   If you look back in history It's a common double standard of society The guy gets all the glory the more he can score While the girl can do the same and yet you call her a whore   I don't understand why it's okay The guy can get away with it & the girl gets named All my ladies come together and make a change Start a new beginning for us everybody sing   This is for my girls all around the world Who've come across a man who don't respect your worth Thinking all women should be seen, not heard What do we do girls? Shout louder! Letting them know we're gonna stand our ground Lift your hands high and wave 'em proud Take a deep breath and say it loud Never can, never will, can't hold us down Lil' Kim: Check it - Here's something I just can't understand If the guy have three girls then he's the man He can either give us some head, sex her off If the girl do the same, then she's a whore But the table's about to turn I'll bet my fame on it Cats take my ideas and put their name on it It's aiight though, you can't hold me down I got to keep on movin' To all my girls with a man who be tryin to mack Do it right back to him and let that be that You need to let him know that his game is whack And Lil' Kim and Christina Aguilera got your back   But you're just a little boy Think you're so cute, so coy You must talk so big  To make up for small lil' things So you're just a little boy All you'll do is annoy You must talk so big  To make up for small lil' things   This is for my girls... This is for my girls all around the world Who've come across a man who don't respect your worth Thinking all women should be seen, not heard So what do we do girls? Shout louder! Letting them know we're gonna stand our ground Lift your hands high and wave 'em proud Take a deep breath and say it loud Never can, never will, can't hold us down   This is for my girls all around the world Who've come across a man who don't respect your worth Thinking all women should be seen, not heard So what do we do girls? Shout louder! Letting them know we're gonna stand our ground Lift your hands high and wave 'em proud Take a deep breath and say it loud Never can, never will, can't hold us down Spread the word, can't hold us down    Really, Christina. You've outdone yourself this time. " You must talk to big to make up for smaller things... " Whoa! What girl honestly has never wanted to say this to some guy that was being, as "Snoop Dogg" would say, P-I-M-P? I really love the concept Christina is trying to get across here. Not that I'm promoting sluts or anything, but really, there always has and always will be a double standard for girls as opposed to guys. Prime example for kids at school: when we do Superfit, there are always goals for guys doing the events for superfit and they're always different from girls. Hell, I know girls who could whoop ass going by the guy's standards for the Superfit awards in P.E.   Oh, lets talk about Stacie Orrico. Damn, I'm talking about a lot of Pop People today, aren't I? Well, don't worry, If you're still hanging on and still reading this, I'll get to my beloved Alternative rock soon. I don't like her first single, "Stuck", but I love her second single, "More To Life".  Read:   I've got it all  But I feel so deprived I go up, I come down  And I'm emptier inside Tell me what is this thing That I feel like I'm missing And why can't I let it go  There's gotta be more to life Than chasing down every temporary high To satisfy me 'Cause the more that I'm Tripping out thinking there must be More to life Well there's life, but I'm sure There's gotta be more Than wanting more  I've got the time  But I'm wasting it slowly Here in this moment I'm halfway out the door Onto the next thing I'm searching for Something thats missing  There's gotta be more to life Than chasing down every temporary high To satisfy me 'Cause the more that I'm  Tripping out thinking their must be More to life Well there's life but I'm sure There's gotta be more  I'm wanting...more I'm always waiting on something Better than this Why am I feeling like there's Something I'm missing?  There's gotta be more to life Than chasing down every temporary high To satisfy me 'Cause the more that I'm Tripping out thinking there must be More to life Well there's life but I'm sure There's gotta be more...    Plus I love her accent. Where is she from, anyway? She sounds Spanish or Mexican, almost. I dunno...  Next song on the list. "Hell Song" by Sum41. Not really Rock, I know. More like...punk-pop, eh? Although they act like dorks in the video, I like the lyrics to this song too. " I feel I've come to realize / How fast life can be compromised... " Okay. Cool. " Knowing endless / Consequences / I feel so useless in this... " Don't we all feel this way sometimes? What about that chorus...hmmmmm:   Part of me won't agree 'Cause I don't know if its for sure Suddenly, suddenly, I don't feel so insecure Part of me won't agree 'Cause I don't know if its for sure Suddenly, suddenly, I don't feel so insecure Anymore....   Another song. I have no idea who sings this one, but I know that its called Kryptonite. I know this is an old song, and I used to listen to it when my friends let me borrow their "Now" CDs. I'm not sure which "Now" it is on, since their are like, twenty of those CDs, but I've loved the song for a long time. I heard it again 'cause my dad burned it onto one of his CDs and we were listening to it on the way to Jason's. My favorite verse is this:   You've called me strong You've called me weak But still your secrets I will keep You took for granted All the times I never let you down...   Mmmkay, know the feeling. But I won't name any names. And I won't do that cough thing where you cough and then put the name in the cough somewhere. I know you were expecting that, don't deny it.   I still like Evanescence, but only the guitar parts because they're easy to learn and quite catchy sometimes. I've fallen in love with "Bowling for Soup". They have a wicked re-make of "I Ran (So Far Away)". How do I know that it was a killer,  wicked awesome remake? Even Dad liked it. Coooool. I also think that their song, "Punk Rock 101" is funny.   I don't know what else to write, but I'm likely to post again tomorrow about the woes of being grounded.

      On Friday I had my B-day classes, which I will go into now...  First I had Creative Writing. Let me first remind you that on the schedules all they put are the course title, the teachers NAME (NOT their Title, ie, Mrs. Mr. etc), and the room number. So I walk in, and since the student's seats were apparently shown by the name cards (uhh, duh), I began looking for my name card and seat. I walk past one isle and into another and see the teacher. She's middle-aged, not young, not old. I ask, "Mrs. Mitchell?" Just to make sure I'm in the right class, you see, since I could not find my name. She glares at me, looking down her nose in a most regal way. " Dr.  Mitchell." She replies. If Heather were there, she'd say, "Oh no she didn't!" (I miss you Heather! Where are you? Did you go to Glen Burnie?) Anyway, she went through the usual, boring, first-day course syllabus, and our first essay question was, "Who Are You?"   Being the psychotic person that I am, I wrote a stupid, one and a half page essay that was melodramatic and predictable, since I was pissed off about the original and misleading outline of creative writing which had made me originally sign up for the course in the first place. My last three sentences were: "Most of all, I am Mallory. I will always be Mallory. Who are you?"  *Snorts*  Melissa, a girl from my Sunday School classes, was in my Creative Wri. class. I knew I recognized her from somewhere! She talked to me after class and I was like, "Oh yeah! Melissa! Duh!" I felt so stupid. My second class was Spanish II, which was in one of the portable classrooms outside, and Melissa walked with me since she had Spanish too. I was surprised to find that two-thirds of the class was 10th and 11th graders. It kinda made me feel cool, being a 9th grader and all. Anyway. Familiar Faces: Catie, HANNAH (ack), Ashley, Melissa, Willie, Chris, Todd (LoL), and other people...yeah. Spanish was real boring, but not half as boring as Am. Govt on A-Day is.   Then I walked all the way back inside to have A lunch, as opposed to the D lunch I have on A-days. Confuzzling, ne? There were considerably more Southies at this lunch. Paula. LoL. *Snort* I sat with Catie and Ashley. Familiar Faces: Catie, Ashley, Paula, Cheryl, Jill, Daniel, Todd, etc. The whole gang. Did you know they sell Gatorade (sp?) and Mozzerella sticks at High School? COOOOL!  Then I walked all the way back OUTSIDE for Algebra I. Same familiar faces: Catie, Ashely, Krista, Todd. I also noticed that SEAN was in my Algebra class. LoL. Algebra was okay. Real easy though. Speaking of easy...  Todd and I went to Guitar I next. All summer I feared that Guitar I would be far, far too easy for me. My fears were confirmed when I picked up a guitar from the wall. We plucked out three notes on the High E string, E, F, and G. We weren't allowed to have picks, and we didn't even strum some chords. Linnell talked about advancing about five of the more seasoned guitarists to Guitar II, but I don't think she'll keep her word. Let me put it this way: its like being Spanish and knowing Spanish, then signing up for Spanish as a class. Or, more like me or anyone else like me taking ESOL (English Speakers of Other Languages). Get it?  Other than that, its all good. Power flickered on and off with a HUGE dry thunderstorm Friday afternoon. Just thought I'd ought to tell you.

      Was going to post yesterday as promised, but...  Right. Back track to Tuesday morning, 5:30 AM. I wake up and get dressed and get everything ready, and go out to the bus stop at 6:30 for my first day of High School. I stood around waiting for the bus with Mandy, a neighborhood friend who is in tenth grade now, and a fellow freshman from Middle School South, Catie. I sat with Catie, and it felt so incredibly strange to be sitting in the front of the bus. I was glad to be leaving the bus stop though, because there are a few creepy people that go to my bus stop. There were about five gothic folk out there, one of whom I remember from Middle School when he was asked to cut, dye, and spike (with Elmers glue) the principal's hair. The other people there were Nina and Claire, people who I also remembered from Middle School, but I stayed away from them since they were smoking and puffing some ciggarets. I leared from my father's mistakes and decided a long time ago that I would never EVER smoke in my life.  Fast forward to Advisory period. This is kind of like homeroom, and mine holds all the freshan with 'S' last names. We sat in alphabetical order, and I happened to get a seat next to one freshman who had failed ninth grade and was back again. Mrs. Hrebiniak (I amazed myself by pronouncing it correctly) explained everything to us, though it was really boring because most of it was stuff we remembered from middle school. She was very sweet, but Mrs. Hrebiniak did treat us like we were kindergarteners. She was nice though. Kind of.  Next I made my way downstairs and without any trouble found my English 9 teacher, Mrs. Andrione. She spoke with a Botsonian's accent and has become one of my favorite teachers already, though I have yet to meet my other four on the next B-day. She's already given us homework, and I'm COMPLETELY stumped as to what I am going to write by tomorrow.  The only time I got "lost" was going from English 9 to Keyboarding (mandatory, I swear). But I found it before the bell rang and found a seat next to other "Southies". Mrs. Taylor was boring, but she didn't hand out as many papers and Mrs. Andrione so I was happy. My parents weren't because these days the school system drills you to death with permission slips, consent forms, insurance forms (in case of DEATH or DISMEMBERMENT, y'know, *sarcasm*), and queries for money for just about everything BUT the schooling itself, which comes out of taxes anyway.  Next was Biology. Remember that girl from homeroom/advisory? Yeah, the one that failed? She was in my science class, along with four others who either failed ninth grade, or just biology. Luckily there were about ten others there who I recognized from South. It was a small class. Biology teacher seemed to be a kind of "Wanna-be young" kind of person, but she gave us raisins as we (quickly) went through what was inorganic and organic. Then we went to lunch.  There were only about ten Southies there that I recognized, and I sat with Amber (from P.E.) and Brandon (the one who asked me to the dance last year, when I couldn't go). Lunch sucked. I had packed a snack, in case there was nothing good at the cafeteria lines, but the only reason I couldn't get cafeteria food was because the damn schools raised the prices for lunch! 1.75 for a main course, a small side, and milk! It used to be 1.10! That means its like, 40 cents for MILK! What is the world coming to? I'm paying more for lunch than my parents are gor one gallon of gas...well, barely since the gas prices are almost two dollars now too...  American Government. This was so incredibly BORING. I'm not even joking. Mr. Bright was old, I knew that from the start. He talked really, really low. He didn't know how to pronounce my name (which isn't too surprising) but not only that, he couldn't pronounce the name "KATIE". We had to yell for him to be able to hear us correct him. The teacher next door seemed a lot more fun, because we could hear him making his "back-to-school" speech about how everyone is important and everyone can make a difference. Mr. Bright goes, "Yes, I remember when I had that boy as a student, right there." He points to my seat. Mr. Bright really *was* old.  Then I made my way down to the girl's locker room, so I could change for cross-country practice. The soccer team was in the Girls Gym lobby, since they had a scrimmage. The field hockey girls came in after me, and kept complaining about how the lights were out in the bathroom. At cross-country, we did our warm-up run around the school twice, which is almost two miles since its the high school and two other middle schools. Then coach made us run six 800s (two laps around the track), each with six minutes rest between, each 800 under four minutes. When we finished, we were about to do our routine sprints to end the day, but we heard thunder so the cross-country team and the field hockey team packed up and either went home with their parents or went to the Girls Gym Lobby to wait for their parents to pick them up.   We were walking to the Gym, me and Kendra, when the wind got REALLY REALLY bad, and started to whip sand at us. So we started running to the gym, and got their just in time before the pouring rain came. We waited there with the field hockey people and the football boys for about a half hour. Coach let us use his cell phone to call home, and he even took one girl home since her mother was stuck in traffic. Before the rain and the lightning ended though, the janitors came to the girls lobby. They got pissed off because two of the ceiling tiles fell down because of the huge winds, and they actually ORDERED US ALL TO LEAVE THE GYM. They kicked us OUT OF THE SCHOOL! The doors only open from the inside, so we had to wait outside for our parents, in the rain and lightning. Christena was like, "This has to be illegal in at least five different ways..." Then my dad picked me up.  We got home, and the cable (TV and Internet) was out. The power had gone out for almost a half hour before.   This morning, school was canceled because the school and some of the students didn't have power at all. Now we have cable back, which I am very glad of because I'm grounded and am stuck in the house.   Tuesday had to be the most exciting day since...a long time ago....

She grows up quickly, though upon falling in love with Romeo, the son of her family's great enemy. Though she loves Romeo as profoundly as he loves her, Juliet nevertheless demonstrates a more level and sober head than does her paramour. Until a falling out near the end of the play, the Nurse is Juliet's closest, and, it seems, only confidante and friend. She fakes her death upon being ordered into an unwanted marrige and Romeo, thinking Juliet dead, kills himself in her tomb. Upon awakening and seeing Romeo dead, Juliet stabs herself with Romeo's dagger.    urlLink   * Which Tragic Shakespearean Heroin are You? *     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla    Ehh, good enough for me, I gues...

      Because I am so EXTREMELY bored, I took this Pirate Name Generator test (by tea and Des):   Mallory:   urlLink My pirate name is Mad Abigail Breakes   This weekend I'm going to a work picnic or something with Heather! I don't know what its gonna be like but I haven't seen my Home Fry in so long so I don't care. I've been so bored this summer and I haven't seen my friends in ages so I can't wait. Heather says another friend of hers is going, but I don't mind that either. I don't know if I know the friend, but I probably don't 'cause she didn't say his name.  OMG that Gap commercial with Madonna and Missy Elliot is so funny! I think its hilarious. I don't like Gap at all, but I thought that pairing for a commercial was rather...odd.  Get into the groove, let me show you some moves...  LOL! I don't really like Madonna or Missy Elliot, but I still thought it was funny.  I didn't do anything remotely interesting today, so get lost if you want something interesting!

      Oh, dear Lord! Save me from this hell-hole that is Maryland! Save me from the boredom and save me from a wasted summer! It has been so incredibly boring these past few days. Excruciatingly boring. Okay, want to hear about my day? No, I didn't think so! Oh well, I'll tell you anyway. I woke up this morning at ten-thirty, which I was proud of since for the past two weeks I've been sleeping in since noon. Then I did nothing but watch TV and hang out on the computer until I had to get ready for Tae Kwon Do.   Then I left for Tae Kwon Do. TKD was a bit more entertaining that life at home had been, since Michelle was there to laugh at/with. Even though Dennis was there, it was a decent practice because Master Kim was there too. Before we start class, Dennis asks everyone if they did anything exciting over the summer. Like three people raise their hands and they all say something to the extent of "So-and-so had surgery done!" Well, Michelle I guess was feeling goofy or couldn't help but comment. She goes, "Oh yeah! Over the weekend I had my left breast removed!" It doesn't sound funny now, but under the circumstances it was so completely hilarious! We were laughing and sniggering for a few minutes and we finally realize that Master Kim heard the whole thing! Michelle was like, "Ahh, ooops?"

      Whoot! I talked to Sarah today for about two minutes. I asked her if she knew what time and where on the 15th the soccer try-outs were. She didn't know, but she says she's gonna call and ask. I'll call Nora and see if she knows too, just in case she does...yeah. Anyways...Sarah had at least some good news! Since we both have last names that end in 'S' and are close together alphabetically, we'll be in the same homeroom in 9th grade! YAY! I didn't want to be stuck there with only Northies and no one I knew, so that's good. I signed up for Guitar 1, but I hope I don't get into it 'cause I'm afraid it will be too easy. But its also a good thing I signed up for it, 'cause its another class I might have with Sarah and since it will be really easy for me it'll be an easy pass class.  I watched the Pianist today. It was a sad movie. Awww. But Adrien Brody is kinda cute before he grows a beard in the movie, so I was happy. The Pianist is a very sad movie about a Jew in Warsaw, Poland during WWII, who plays the piano really really well. Sweet. He was about to get sent off to a concentration camp with his family, but his friend that was in the Jewish Police saved him and let him run away. So it was kinda like the Underground Railroad and the Pianist (I'm not sure what his first name was, it was Dutch or Polish or German or something...was it Broderick?) was shipped around in different houses by Anti-Nazi Polish people (that weren't Jewish). It was a very sad movie. Lots of dead people in it.

      *Sigh*  Another boring day in the life of...who am I? Oh yeah. Another boring day in the life of Mallory. When I die, no one will remember me and it feels good. Doesn't it feel good to know that after a few years, a few hundred bucks to replace the shed you blew up, and a new fire hydrant, you'll never be remembered? Oh yeah.   Went to church this morning. The message of today's homaly was "Your job description is not who you are." Sure, you may be a doctor, mother, lawyer or whatever, but deep down your true self is one of God's children. Thank God for St. Paul. Brad keeps comlpaining about St. Bernadette Parish. He says the homaly is too long, then he says that the songs are too long, then he says Father Nick's nose is too long...etc.etc. you get the idea, right?  First Day of School Countdown: 23 and a half days. Or is that 22 and a half? Oh well. Either way, High School is upon us and there is nothing we can do about it. Doesn't that feel great too? Knowing that you can't slow down time and ask the Superintendant for three more years of summer vacation.   Well, at guitar yesterday we finished writing down the sheet music for the song "Going Under" by Evanescence. Its really an easy song, and meesh & John could figure out the power chords just by listening to the CD. Awesome. Its easy to figure out the rhythm once you've got the chords too. All I need to figure out now is the guitar solo and that song is done, and we can move on to some more. Cooooool.  Not much else going on. Waiting for soccer try-outs. I'm not quite 100% optimistic about making it, but me and Sarah are more optimistic than some. "We're gonna try out, and we're gonna make it! Right Mallory? Mallory?"  Yeah. Ice Age, Sarah, Ice Age. *grin*   Feeling:  Bored. . .still.  Drinking:  Water.  Eating:  Sunflower seeds.  Listening to:  Exploding cars. Hehehe. They can't blame me. They'll never figure out who put the cooking oil in the middle of the street...::evil::  Reading:  Nothing.   Writing:  Chapter Seven.  Procrastinating:  White Horse/ Chapter Seven

        You are the Dread Pirate Roberts.  There will be no survivors.  Your name has become more powerful as a weapon of fear than many others ploys. Keep working to maintain the justification of that fear, but remember what is important in life.    urlLink   Are you a Pirate?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla    Awesome. At least I'm not someone stupid like Mary Read or Black Beard. I'm someone cool who no one that doesn't know about pirates knows about. Did that make sense? No, but it doesn't matter, 'cause I'm the Dread Pirate Roberts. I don't get what it is with everyone and PotC! I mean, it was a good movie and everything, but all it did was create a whole new breed of Rabid Orli Fan Girls. GASP! But I love both Jacks, monkey and pirate.

      *Sighs* Damn, its August already. Tomorrow is Emmie's and Katie's birthdays, so HAPPY EARLY B-DAY!! I just love birthdays. Yeah and I was invited to this seven-year old's birthday party tomorrow, but I have rehearsal with JemJem and meesh so I can't go. But I got her a present and I'll give it to her on Monday at Karate I guess.   Less than a month until school. OMHS really isn't that big, but there are a lot of people who're gonna be there so I guess it might look/seem different since I saw it when it was empty. Most of the classes are in a certain hallway, depending on their subject. So, all I have to do is figure out where the hell my class will be in the hallway. I'm not nervous, either. Its gonna be fun. New place, new people, new ways to get in trouble...yeah.   Today I watched Braveheart, 'cause I was really really bored. Its a cool movie, and I love the way Mel Gibson says 'arse' with his Scottish accent. Mom says we're going back to Scotland next year and we'll visit uncle Joe in London sometime. Cool. Can't wait. I mean, I'd much rather go to Scotland than the Carribean.   Nothing much else is going on, really.    Feeling:  Bored.   Drinking:  Water, of course.   Eating:  Brad has eaten all the good food already. Stupid bugger.  Listening to:  Scottish accents.  Reading:  Nothing really.  Writing:  Chapter Seven.

      Nothing really exciting happened today, but I had a good - well, better than most! - day so I thought I'd share it with ya'll. The first sign that it was a good day was that even though it was a Monday, it was a B-day and I got driven to school so it was a sign from God that something right would happen today.  Creative Writing - On my short story (Like Pandora's Box with a twist, I guess is the easiest way to explain it) I got a 190/200. The only reason I lost ten points was because my plotline was handed in a week earlier instead of with the whole packet. And on my Short Story test I got an 80/85 on my essay about Edgar Allen Poe's "The Tell-Tale Heart" and a 15/15 on my multiple choice, so a 95% on my SS test. That's great!  Err, well nothing happened in Spanish or Algebra or Guitar, nothing bad, but nothing particularly...nothing abnormally or unusually good either.   After school we had a short Cross-Country practice. We basically did warm-up and a 50 minute free-run on campus. We had pictures at four, and it was so funny because all the shorts are reaaaaaaally short and the boys' legs were all pale and white. The girls were all screaming and whooping about how sexy their legs looked and it was just so funny. After practice Coach told us his expectations for the meet tomorrow at Chesapeake. If you remember, we had a dual meet there for our first actual run. He told me that I need to shave about six minutes off my old time, and I'm sure I can shave off four minutes but I might have to try super-hard for six whole minutes...oh well, I'll do my best and have fun and that's all that matters.  At Tae Kwon Do we started Hap Ki Do lessons, which is basically a form of self-defense should you ever be grabbed or threatened. It was cool. Christa was kind of cold to me, and talked to me like I should know everything they were doing even though I had never taken HKD before. Its all good though...it was fun...Master K was there! Whoot! I love master K! (ewww, not like THAT! He's married! sheesh, you people and your sick minds! *smiles*)  Then I came home, and in less than a half-hour I finish a Periodic Report due tomorrow for American Govt. We had to find an article and write one page about the article and one page on our reaction. Boo ya. Mine sucks, but its better than not doing it at all. Its about this strange tradition in Swaziland where the king gets to choose one wife a year out of the hundreds of legally eligable young women. I guess he abducted one illegally and the mother is pressing charges with a bunch of human and woman's rights activists backing her up.  Now I have to finish my English Journal. We read, "The Cask of Amontillado" in English on Friday, and we had to write a journal answering these questions:  "Analyze the author's (Edgar Allen Poe's) narrator in the Short Story, "The Cask of Amontillado. How reliable is Montressor in telling the story?To what extent does Poe want the reader to trust Montressor's viewpoint? Why would an author deliberately create an unreliable narrator?"  Dude, Montressor was just psycho....and I've come to be reminded that in all the E.A. Poe stories I've read the [first person] narrator is always psycho. But Andrione says that Poe wrote a lot of romance/tragedies, and schools just play up all the drama/horror/thriller stories by Poe.  Oh well, I'm off to finish my Poe Journal. 'Night, folks!

      *Sighs*  So what else is new? Please, tell me something new. Practice on Friday sucked because I felt like crap. I got sick right after lunch, so maybe it was something I ate but all through practice I was sneezing and yawning and my eyes were watering and...it was just hell. I felt a bit better on Saturday when I went to see John, and I felt really good after my three-mile run with Kendra at four. That was cool.   We have sports team pictures on Monday, after practice so that we're all sweaty. Coach says it makes us look more "Real" and not all prissy in our pictures. I don't really care either way.   Halloween is coming. I've narrowed it down to two ideas for costumes. Now, before you go yelling at me, saying, "You're 14, in High school! Why are you dressing up for a kid holiday?" let me just explain. I always help out at the Tae Kwon Do Halloween party every year, and I need a costume for that. But that's not the only time I can wear it! I could also wear it to school on Halloween, since it'll be a Friday this year, and I'll also wear it when handing out candy to the kiddies. So, I've narrowed it down to being an authentically dressed pirate or Samara from "The Ring." I can't decide. They'd both be easy to make, so I'm stuck. PM me, IM me, write me, let me know! Help...  Ugh. Writer's block. Well, not really a block. I know what I want to write, but I just won't. I've put chapter eight off for almost a whole month now. I've edited everything on chapters one through seven, and they're changed and ready for review. I just can't get chapter eight out! Help!  Mom and Dad went to a football game tonight. Shelby has Sunday School tonight. I'll be all alone. For once! But then I have SS next week and I have to face Jackie and/or her mom. Miss Valerie is the sweetest person on earth! But, after what Hannah did I'm just so scared to face them. I'm so ashamed.  But, we found out what happened with Hannah. Its kind of a personal thing so I don't want to blurt it all out but, it explained a lot. It almost makes me feel a bit bad for her, but then again...after all the things she's done to me and all the trouble she has caused in my life its just so hard to feel sorry for a person like Hannah. The short story is that she's moved out of the school district for OMHS and won't be going there again, and I'm not likely to see her again for a long time so that's good. Might make things a little better in my social life without her ruining everything with my OMHS friends. She ruined everything last year in eigth grade.  So...talk to me people! I'm so bored. I should be working though...

      Hey everyone. I know its been a while since I posted, but I lost power for two days during Isabel and there just hasn't been much going on lately.  Our meet on Thursday at Chesapeake got canceled, since its a low-lying ground and they were afraid it wouldn't be dry enough. They postponed it to next Tuesday, which means we'll have two meets in one weel; one on Tues. and one on Thurs. Oh, and today was Arundel day! Old Mill welcomed Arundel's JV boys soccer, Varsity boys soccer, Varsity girls soccer, and Varsity football to our stadium, meaning that XC had NO PLACE TO PRACTICE! I am beginning to dislike soccer more and more. Almost more than field hockey. I have friends on both teams and I'm not pissed off at any of them per ce, but I just wish that we could use the track more often.  Not much else going on. Well, tonight I got my letter for my 9Gup Black Belt test, which is like going down in levels of your black belt until you get your next stripe. Its Oct. 11, which is good because I have no meet that day at all. I have to cancel practice with John and JemJem though, but that happens every week and Black Belt tests only happen three or four times a year, so...  Meh. Nothing else. Argh. School is so dull. English is just getting to the point where I want to sleep during it (but I haven't yet). Keyboarding is just...so incredibly easy...if I don't use home row, that is. *evil grin* My science teacher treats us like babies, and that sucks. But my Am. Govt. teacher is fun to laugh with (at?) since he's totally deaf and you haev to scream out your answers and feel really stupid. But the company is good. Creative Writing is my best class by far. I love it. I only like Spanish2 because Catie and me and Amanda sit on the comfy floor. We've got CARPET in our Spanish class. Coooooool. Algebra is just...Algebra. And Guitar is too easy.  That's it. I've nothing more to say.  Hey friends, IM or Email or tell me which I should be for Halloween: A pirate or Samara from the Ring. Lemme know! Love ya!

      Mmmmkay. What's up?  You've all heard about Isabel. She was an on-and off category 4/5 hurricane early this week, and it hit southern North Carolina Wednesday night when I got home from Karate. They already canceled school for today (Thursday), which I thought was kind of stupid since the last time they did that for a Hurricane two years ago it didn't even rain.   So I had off today.  Now its been raining with slight winds for about three hours now, but it really hasn't been that bad. Shelby is happy, since today is her birthday and she's never had off school on her birthday (Niether have I! Wahh). Then I learned from coach that school would be out on Friday too, and that there would be no Hereford meet this Saturday.  So its all good. No school until Monday. I'm decently happy.   I guess I've been suckered into going to a football game on Tuesday. Alex told me about it over AIM (well, I was at Karate but she left messages). And I am trying to tell Heather (unsuccessfully) that I should be able to go and see the POMS squad perform. It should be fun, I've got several Middle School buddies on the JV football team, who will either be playing (I think?!) or watching, so I won't be alone. I need to support my POMS buddies so...  Izzzzzzzy Izzzzzzzy IZZZZZZABEL! WHOOOT. I'm off to go and run in the rain...SINGING IN THE RAIN!!!   I Ran (So Far Away): Flock of Seagulls    I walked along the avenue I never thought I'd meet a guy like you Need a guy like you With auburn hair and tawny eyes The kind of eyes that hypnotize me through Hypnotize me through  And I ran I ran so far away I just ran I ran all night and day I couldn't get away  A cloud appears above your head A beam of light comes shining down on you Shining down on you The cloud is moving nearer still Aurora Borealis comes in view Aurora comes in view  And I ran I ran so far away I just ran I ran all night and day I couldn't get away  Reached out a hand to touch your face You're slowly disappearing from my view Appearing from my view Reached out a hand to try again I'm floating in a beam of light with you A beam of light with you   *Two words slightly changed...

      Meh. School was okay this week. Decent. I can't believe its only the third week of school. It seems like so much longer! And it seems like even longer when I think that the last cross-country meet was only just last week!  Speaking of Cross-Country...  Today it was pouring from the remains of hurricane Isabel today. Pouring. I prayed that it would start thundering, but does it ever? I went down to the Girl's locker room, and Toni comes down and says, "We're on unless it starts lightning!" And I just...blech. I felt horrible. We did weight training on Wednesday, and my hamstrings, obliques, and my shoulder muscles (Mr. B would be so disappointed if he knew I forgot!) felt like jello today. Anyway, life sucks a lot for me, so I had to go anyways.   I was on Varsity, and since Jessica got sick (oh, what a coincidence!) Toni was on Varsity too. We ran at 4:30, after the Varsity guys. After us would go the JV guys and then the JV girls. Well, we got to the course at three, and it was pouring. Just...and well, I guess that it really wasn't bad with the rain, but rain PLUS wind is killer. Not to mention the mud. So by the time we were done doing the course walk we were freezing to death and were soaked through all our clothes and shoes.   Okay, fast forward to about 3/4 of a mile into the race. A hill moderately slopes after a half mile through the extremely muddy (and I mean EXTREMELY muddy) wood trail. Even though I was in the second race, the hill was like a mud hole. I was smart enough to go far to the right where there was still some stable grass, but I know tons of people slowed down there or fell/slipped there. Other than that the course really wasn't that bad. I keep improving my time by about 3-4 minutes each race. That's decent! I'm still on Varsity since I got a 25 minute run in today. I could've done better, but my sore muscles plus the weather was just killing me.  Not much else going on. Dad's coming home from Minnesota tomorrow. He was there to visit Grandma and Grandpa. They both have cancer, and its getting really bad. But lately they've been getting better, Dad says. Looks like we'll be going back for Thanksgiving or Christmas without bringing some black clothes (said in the most respectable and completely serious way, of course).   That's about all. I've been running late on posts, but I should catch up this weekend. I'm looking at finishing most of my games before starting ANY new ones. I'm loaded now, I've lost count, but one or two just ended and another is on its last five or so posts. Which is good. I love 'em though, and I'll miss playing them. Its all good though. Hey, check out this really short song that I love, because I have nothing else to post about!   The Last Rock Show    Stand in line behind me We've got tons of time to Let it all hang out  And cast the demons out.  Once we're in the roof falls I heard that we have got to raise it up And let the f****r burn.  And this is sure to take awhile cause if we're going out, we're goin' out with style So we all jump around, and we fall to the ground Like it's the last rock show of our lives.   Same song different chorus...*Hums along*....

      Blargh.   School really hasn't been that bad, but I've really had some troubles with getting up so early. Well, I know some people get up way earlier than I do, but really, after two months of sleeping in late getting up at 5:45 to catch the 6:30 bus and get to school when it starts at 7 is almost killing me. And it gets really bad on A-days, since those are my most boring classes. English is my first class and I'm half asleep before announcements! That's sad. Not to mention what I'm like at 2:30 pm when Cross-Country practice starts. Yesterday I got home at 6pm and snoozed until eight, at which point I did homework and went back to bed at 11. I'm just not good without sleep.  Tomorrow is school pictures. I've lived for ten school years with decent/okay school pictures. I'm really not picky about how they turn out usually, but I just want a picture that I can show to relatives with pride. All my school pictures have turned out kind of hokey. We never got my Kindergarten-First grade pictures, since then I lived in Scotland and they never sent them home. In second grade I remember that I had a terrible hairday since pictures were after Recess. In third grade my picture was halfway decent, except for the fact that through elementary school I almost always seemed to lose a few teeth right before picture day so I had a nice picture and smile in third grade but a gap in my teeth. In fourth grade I was forced to wear an ugly dress courtesy my Auntie, which I thought was horribly revealing (but it wasn't really, I was just a dork then) and then there were the teeth. I vaguely remember my fifth grade picture, in which I wore black overalls over a silky purple shirt. In sixth grade I wore the same shirt as the girl alphabetically next to me in the yearbook and I had the same hair length, so we look alike. In seventh grade I had a really bad haircut. In eight grade my shirt was the same color as the backdrop, so my head was floating.  I just want a good school picture! Is that so much to ask?!? Huh??  I'm tired. Ugh.   Homecoming is November 1st. I don't want to go unless someone asks me. I will go to the football game though, because Heather will be in the halftime show and I want to see how my Poms buddy does. We don't have any classes together so I just want to make sure we don't grow too far apart. Umm, what else? Kendra says that for spirit week, the Freshmen wear tropical clothes on misc. day, and wear red (I think) on school color day. Sophomores and Juniors will wear blue or white, and the Seniors wear...you guessed it! Togas! Toga, toga, toga! Don't ask.   Umm, what else? Halloween is the state championship for CC. We get out of school two hours early that day for some reason (not just the CC team, the whole school). I think I'm going to be a pirate for Halloween. I don't think I'll go trick-or-treating though. No one gives out enough candy! Jeeze, you have to go through like ten neighborhoods just to get a bunch of Recees Peanut Butter Cups. Sheesh. I'll probably just stay home and give out candy and steal whatever is left.  Nothing else. G'night, folks. *Yawn*

      Sorry its been so long. Blogger sucks. Or, well, my computer does. Or, well, my internet does. Or, well, you know.   I bet you're all wondering how the cross-country meet went on Thursday. Even if you're not, too bad. Well, it was a longer course than usual, by like a half mile. And even though most of it was in the cool woods, there were a LOT of steep hills. Still, moving on. A lot of Chesapeake girls got in front of me, but I always sprint the last three hundred metres so I caught up to some of them. And guess what? Go on, guess! I GOT ON VARSITY!!! WHOO! There were ten Old Mill girls there, and I was within the top seven so I got a spot on Varsity and next meet we go to I'll be running with the varsity girls. Cool! Old Mill didn't do so bad at the meet, but we could've done better.  Not much happened on Friday. I was really tired though, I can tell you that. I also forgot my damn running shoes at home, so I had to run in my Vans. If you're wondering whether or not that hurts, trust me, running eight miles for Cross-Country practice in flat-footed Vans HURTS REALLY REALLY BAD. I learned my lesson, that's for sure.  Today we had a car wash for Cross-Country. It was technically free, but most people gave donations (which is what we had hoped for in the first place). We were supposed to be there from seven to twelve, but the damn field hockey people apparently had a slot starting at ten AM. I'm not blaming the field hockey girls, I'm blaming the stupid owner of the gas station we used. Still, we made $250 in two and a half hours, so I'm happy. We'll all be able to go to the end-of-season banquet, so its all good. Kendra's mom rocks! She brought what Doug so rightly called 'sustenance', or, Hershey's chocolate, apples, and Sunny Delight. AND GRAPES!!  Then I went to Jason's. It was hectic and crowded, but I did eventually get to see John. Now I'm back, finishing all my homework. I seem to have a lot this weekend. But its all really really easy. Spanish II is too easy. Way way too easy. School is a lot better than I thought it would be. Cooooooool.   Oh, and I forgot to mention something that completely pisses me off. Hannah tried out for soccer, and somehow she made it and Jess and Nora didn't. When she was going to the tryouts, she never once got a ride from her own parents. And when practice started a day or two before school she had troubles getting carpool rides because her parents "couldn't take her". Then, she goes to school for a whole two days and doesn't show up at all after that. On the third day of school she didn't go to classes but then got to soccer somehow. After that she just stopped coming to school and soccer altogether.  So, I'm wondering what is up with Hannah and so is Nora. I got to SpanishII yesterday and Señora calls role. When she gets to Hannah's name she goes, "Oh yes, she got dropped." Now, I wasn't  sure what this meant, but I guessed that Hannah had either dropped out or she had been kicked out by the school. After school, I'm getting ready for Cross-Country and Ali is in the locker next to mine. Ali is on the soccer team, but she couldn't find an empty soccer locker so she used one of the CC lockers. And I was talking to Ali, and I asked her what was up with Hannah. She goes, "Oh, you didn't hear? Hannah's moving!"   Ali also went on to say that two or three other girls on the team weren't going to practice or were showing up to scrimmages saying they forgot their uniforms. This pisses me off more than anything. I know that Nora wanted a spot on the team and Jess deserved one, and they would have been dedicated to the team. So they were rejected by some Texas-Ranger soccer coach who didn't even bother looking at the Freshman in the first place, and replaced Nora & Jess with a few players that were undedicated, making stupid assumptions.   Sorry, that was my rant for the day.  I'm off punishment now, thank god. Hannah so needed to get in trouble. She was the one who did the dirty work and did most of the work in getting in trouble. Sure, I know I was wrong to let her do it, but I wasn't the one who actually did it! Her parents probably don't even know what happened. She lies like that sometimes. I'm so pissed with her. I had half the mind to call and tell her mom or dad, but then she'd probably lie to them and tell them it was all me. The thing with this is that I have never gotten into trouble for doing such a thing with any of my other friends, which leads my parents to lean to my side and blame Hannah. That's a relief. But I was still stuck on punishment for two and a half weeks and Hannah got off free.  Oh well. Life sucks sometimes.   Oh, and to add to all of that crap, my CD player is broken. Dad says a new one will be a Christmas gift. Okay, counting down the days - ahem, MONTHS until I get a new CD player. Really, its not like I'm spoiled or anything, but I'm a musician, and I neeeeeeed a way to listen to music and hook it up to my Amp for my guitar. Life sucks a lot right now.

      Hey again. Me again. Bored again.   A-days suck. B-days rock. On A-days I have English 9, which I used to think was fun but now I think is rather boring and below my level and every student in my class' level. Then I have Keyboarding. Mrs. T picks on me, I think. Still, the only problem I really have with that class is the fact that when we are *forced* to sit ramrod straight and the damn rollie wheely chairs dig into our backs. Ouch. Then there's Biology. I sit next to some cool guys from North, but the class is just so incredibly boring. This is also below our level. Maybe its just because these first few weeks are review days after a [not very long] summer vacation. Lastly...well, there's not many positive things I can say about Mr. Bright and American Government. He is deaf, can't pronounce ANY name WHATSOEVER, and he likes to pick random people to pick on and be mean to everyday. But isn't it every student's nature to hate teachers and school? Okay, maybe not *every* student. The point: A-days stink.  B-days, on the other hand, are very cool. First I have Creative Writing, which is cool because Creative Wri. is a lot more accepting of Fantasy and Sci Fi than English is. We're currently developing three themes and three plots for short stories that will all [this is mandatory] be submitted into a county contest. Then I have Spanish out in the portables, which isn't exciting but its actually really really easy. I'm just good with languages. Then I have Algebra, which is just plain fun because of the teacher and the guys who sit near me. Funny stuff. Then there's GuitarIII, which I had to be moved up to since Guitar One was like, baby stuff for me. I haven't had a GuitarIII class yet, since she just yesterday told us the new classroom to go to, but its all good. B-days rock.  Tomorrow I have a cross-country meet. Our uniforms aren't the best, but I have my lucky number nine so its all good. I know I'll do fine, but I hope my mom has fun because my dad's already been to a scrimmage but mom hasn't. Other than that, school life is just like middle school. Almost. Kind of...okay, not really.   Not much else to say...

      And here I thought I was looking forward to Labor day. But I wasn't expecting to be grounded. I guess I'll have to wait until the next holiday. Since I can't do anything now. Next scheduled holidays for OMHS: October 6, October 16, and October 17.   I feel like a lazy bum today since I can't go anywhere. But I vaccumed today so mom let me steal cookie dough, even though she says I could get Sal Minela (sp?). I also helped clean out the basement for our yard sale on the 20th. There are some cooooool things there. I hope we get a lot of money. I have a stash where I put my cash that I've been saving up. I don't know what I'm going to do with it though.  Last night I watched Gladiator. It was such a sad movie! It was so heart-wrenching when the Emporer's son cries to his father because he thinks the Emperor loves Maximus as a son and hates him! And then Joaquin's character smothers the Emperor in a hug! Dear God, how sad is that? And then when Maximus' son and wife are crucified! And that nice African man who stays a friend of Maximus'. And when Gladiator kills the Emperor, and dies soon after. Lovely. Lovely.  So, the movie ended at almost 2 AM. I tried to sleep, but I kept waking up. Then, in a sudden stroke of inspiration, I type up a poem at almost 3AM. I think it was a brilliant poem, which says something since I usually hate all my writing and throw it away or delete it. Then I went to bed and had a horrible dream about Cross-Country team mates calling me by Alex Yanky's nickname for me, "Malaria." Don't ask.  Anyways, I'm starting a petition. All my friends, family, and acquaintences are to wear  BLACK  on  DECEMBER 8th . If any of you remember, this is the anniversary of Midnight getting hit by that car. I MISS YOU MIDNIGHT! Maybe if we all wear black we can ressurect him somehow. I'll wear a picture of him around my neck. We remember Midnight, though day breaks. Middie. *sob*  What else am I to do? My damn muse wakes me up at 3AM to make me write a brilliant poem, and then leaves me hanging when Aman expects a post for Tadgh and I need a post for Dorlas. You suck sometimes, Butler. But it was a good poem, if I do say so myself.  I should have a Tadgh post up by late tonight. If not, all hope is lost.

      I beat Erica out for Regional's Varsity Team at the County Race. A whole minute and eight seconds faster. She was practically dying, so I felt incredibly bad for her, and Kendra and I had to carry her back to our dugout before she fainted. I hope coach doesn't change his mind again.   Homecoming is this week. I'm dressing up, but because I like being psycho. Tropical day, Twin day, Wacky Wednesday, Spirit Day, Halloween, then the Saturday float parade, football game, and dance. NOT GOING TO THE DANCE! YOU CAN'T MAKE ME! But I will go to the game. I love football, didn't you know? I'm a cheesehead, (ten bonus points if you know what that means) so lay off my psycho headgear. And if anyone at the Regional meet this Thursday (spirit day/school color day) thinks I am crazy for painting my face red, white, and blue, I will scream, "I AM A WHALE!" at them and confirm their suspicions. It doesn't sound right to say, "I AM A PATRIOT!" as a chant or mantra, so we decided to be whales.  So, Cross Country is almost over, and thus begins a whole new season called Indoor Track. The only part of Indoor Track that is indoor are the meets, otherwise we are outside freezing our butts off while other sports (intelligent people, now that I think of it this way) like basketball are  inside  when it is snowing. I don't know what events I'm competing in, but it will probably be some sort of middle distance event, even though Shelby has been begging me to do pole vaulting.   I'll miss Cross Country!   Kevin: Who was that screaming, “We love you Kevin?” Kendra: Err… Me: We said that to everyone on the boy's JV team when they ran! Kendra: No,  you  said that to all of them! I only said it for Kevin and that he was our hero! Alex: Once again, Kevin’s hopes are dashed…   Kendra/Me: WE LOVE YOU DAVID! David: I hate you. Me: Uh, what? Kendra: He just said he hated us! Me: That’s it, no more cheering for David.  Kendra: I’m not leaving Kevin. Me: We’ll see him at the finish line! Kendra: I’m not leaving Kevin. Me: I’m not suggesting you leave him, per ce… Kendra: I’M NOT LEAVING KEVIN. Me: All righty then. Me neither. KEVIN IS MY HERO!   I have a feeling that I should mention the fact that I finished five books in the past month and I am very proud of this considering the facts that (A) I have been bogged down with XC, TKD, and school, and (B) they were all books suggested to me, not books chosen of my own free will.  My new mission for Christmas is to learn a Pink Floyd song for my father's Christmas gift. I must complete this mission!

      My braces are completely off, but now I have these retainers in that are just like invisalign only they are only temporary to keep my teeth in place until I actually get invisalign. There was still cement on my teeth though, so they had to do that today too (that was one of the reasons I didn't want braces in the first place, LoL). The retainer kind of hurst, but at least it is removable. When I had my pallet expander in, I couldn't pronounce the letter 'K' in a word. Now I have trouble with the letter 'S' since I have the little plastic retainer over both sets of teeth. Darn it!  The purpleness has gone! Whoot!   Other than that, nothing has really happened.  But I did turn in all of my homework today, and I'm getting A's in all my classes but Algebra. Well, actually, I'm not sure what I really have in Algebra so I have to wait until I get my progress report. I know its not less than a B though, so I'm happy with that. I'm doing well in school, is my point, anyway.  I finished Chapter Nine tonight, and thus finished BOOK ONE! FINALLY! On to book two when I fell motivated. Yawn.

      Yeah, its been a while, huh?  Well, I had my surgery on Thursday! Go me. It hurt so incredibly bad. My doctor was gone for over a year, and he said that it would be best if we tried this new laser that had a longer wavelength than the other one. My birthmark was really purple and had to lumps, and I think they called it a cavernous hemangioma, but I'm not sure I spelled that correctly. Anyway, the first hit with the laser didn't hurt that bad. Yeah, it hurt, but not that bad. The second one, however, hurt so badly that I didn't even  cry  on purpose, and tears just rolled out of my eyes. Ouch. He did three more hits and it was all over.  IT WORKED! Well, okay, so it swelled a lot and it isn't completely gone, but hell, the purple-ness is gone! Totally gone! It swelled and swelled to the point where I had to have ice and everyone noticed it at XC practice even though we were in the morning darkness, but IT WORKED! So I'm incredibly happy.   This birthmark lip thing has just been so...taxing. I know that I don't even really think about it much anymore, but there's just something wrong when the first thing people notice about you is "That thing on your lip." I have to break the stereotype every time I meet someone new. That sounds kind of self-centered and melodramatic, but I'm not even exaggerating. Still, I'm very happy that the surgery (my 27th!) was a success, and hopefully I'll feel even better about it once the swelling goes down.  Argh. Tomorrow I get all my brackets and pallet expander taken out! Whoot! I get a whole night and day without braces, and then the next day I get a retainer. Hallelujah!  My XC coach (Coach W.) is totally pissing me off, with his stupid policies and how he plays favorites and worships Larry (not that its Larry's fault, Larry is a nice guy). I can't wait for Track, when its just Coach L. and the track. Thank God. And Keniesha will be there too, and so will Jenn. So I'm happy. Kind of. I just hope that Coach W feels bad next XC season when Larry, Kath, and Katerina are gone and he wonders why I'm not there to take a place. He just doesn't understand that he should set a bunch of rules and NOT MAKE EXCEPTIONS. I'm there for every race, and I make varsity too, and then he still lets whoever wasn't at a race get back on varsity. I know if I missed a race I'd have to earn my spot back. BUT NO, Kate is different. He says, "There's a big difference between your top runner and your sixth and seventh runners..." Bull. Its all varsity. Stupid stupid stupid! Argh.  Sunday school. G'night!

      The Autumn Classic Invitational on the military base just ROCKED today.  Kate decided not to run since she's been 'sick' lately, though since she talked up a storm throughout the whole meet I don't think she was that ill. We could have beat Chesa. if she would have run, but we came super close and I did so well that I'm fifth on the Varsity team now.  Kendra and Tonie did really well, sticking together like glue through the whole course. Alex got back on Boys Varsity, and Trevor sucked so he's back on JV where he belongs (sorry, I love all the other boys but I'm just against Trev. Nah, just kidding Trev). David did really good. So did Kevin. Ah, Larry was in first for Varsity (first out of EVERYONE) until the last hundred-metres, which he should have sprinted...but I still think he could have beat that other dude.  Its all such a blur now. I wasn't nervous once the race started, and my legs were numb so I decided to push as hard as I possibly could. And it worked. Larry got an award and whatnot, like always. Our team did pretty well, all in all.   Such a feeling of companionship...not to mention the only co-ed sport for fall. *wink*. Nah, just kidding. I love all the boys. I love boys in general. The JV boys were running by and Kendra and I were screaming "We love you!" to all the OM guys that ran by. They laughed. So did we...  Oh, and when we got home the football game against Chesa. was going on, and we got to see the marching band! I had never seen it before, and I thought it was so incredibly cool! Their uniforms, mostly. Okay, our mascot is the Patriots, and they were walking - marching - down the way in Revolution uniforms with flutes and drums and trumpets and everything. POMS and cheerleading followed the serenading chorus, and thusly I got to see Heather, Lexi, Sarah, and Lara before their big performance. I'll see 'em all at homecoming game, but its nice to see people you don't see very often.  David stole my sandals.

      I've had the sniffles really bad lately. *sniff*  In Creative Writing we're writing one-act plays. I'm working with this girl named Rachel, a Junior, and my friend Sarah from Middle School. Its starting to turn into this romantic comedy set in India during British occupation, and I think it'll be super awesome (froody!) once we're done. Yeah. I'm already bragging about it and we've just barely finalized the plot/setting etc. Let me know if you want to see it when its all done...  Umm, in Spanish2 we went outside and drew an airplane on the safety road, and I was an  auxiliar , or, a flight attendant. JOE was a  copiloto , and yeah, you guessed it, he was a co-pilot! It was funny. I walked around to all the "passengers" or classmates going, "Quieres Beber? Cola? Agua?" Someone asked me for peanuts, but I told them that we'd run out. Ha!  Algebra is just so incredibly boring.   Ehh, what else? Oooh, I got a 98 on my current event in American Government. Mr. B said that my reaction was excellent, but he took off two points because I only had two paragraphs - one for the summary of my newspaper article and one for my reaction. But really, he never specified about that area so I wasn't sure what was going on when I handed it in. Oh well, I did great and thats all that matters to me.  During our twelve seperate four-hundred meter sprints yesterday I was the first girl to finish (ahead of a lot of boys too!) for half the sprints. It might have been because Kate felt totally sick or Emily was just feeling...well, I dunno what was wrong with her but, well, I was happy so...  Invitational tomorrow. Test on Saturday. I'm so overwhelmed and I just hope I can go to the Ren-Faire on Sunday, and do something I actually consider relaxing and non-taxing on my body. For the race, my hope is to beat Jessica and possibly get closer to Katherina. But I won't be running in their race so I have nothing visually to help me, so I have to go by time. Time. My goal is twenty-four to twenty-five. That's kind of slow, almost. But its a good goal to get another point. For the Tae Kwon Do test, I just want to get the next Gup without trouble. I'm pretty confident, but I know I've been kind of half-ass lately about TKD.  I asked David today why he turned Alison down for the dance. He said he didn't like her that way, and that he didn't really want to go to homecoming anyway. I hope he doesn't go, otherwise Alison will get really pissed at him if she sees him there.  Argh. I also might miss the pep rally the day before the game and homecoming. We might have to leave early for the county meet. I really hope that doesn't happen. It will most likely run late, and thusly I won't be able to make it to the Tae Kwon Do Halloween party, which is always the day before Halloween anyway. So, I'm totally booked and I know I can't ditch Cross Country but I have been organizing and helping at the TKD halloween party for the past three years. Argh....  Well, its been decided. Unless I'm invited to some sort of Halloween party, I'm staying home to hand out candy on 'El Dia de los Muertos' (Day of the Dead, I think). My mom thought I was too old for trick-or-treating when I was in seventh grade, but I went last year (8th grade). This year I just feel like staying home and eating candy and watching movies and writing and...  Sigh.   Simone:  Madame, they're coming up the steps!  Madame:  Well Simone, that's what the steps are there for...

      I'm fairly happy with myself and what I did today. Go me.  Okay, let me explain:  Today is Yom Kippur. This is the first year that our county (I don't know about our whole state) decided to let us have the day off for a Jewish holiday. I find that quite fair, y'know, since we always have Christian holidays off its only fair that we at  least  have some Jewish or other religious holidays off, right? So, I was convinced that I would relax today, but not waste this whole day full of non-school wasted time.  I woke up this morning at nine-thirty. Just right. Late enough for me to feel rested after a month of waking up at five in the morning, but early enough for me to feel like I have enough time to do things. Here's a list of things I accomplished/did today:  1) Woke up (Yay! Go me!) 2) Roller-bladed for cross training for two hours this morning 3) Finished Chapter Eight! (Hallelujah! Took long enough didn't it?) 4) Re-revised Chapters One-Seven. 5) Baked...well, burned cookies. 6) Watched a movie that was so incredibly stupid it was funny to me: Quest for Camelot, my sister asked me to put it in and I thought it was so hilarious! But the blind guy was kind of cool, and so was that two-headed dragon. "Frankly, we're the reason cousins shouldn't marry..."  7) Went and ran three miles straight with Kendra, and it turned out that it was faster than our actual course time! But that may be because it was on the track and without terrain or hills.  Cool, huh? All this before I go to Tae Kwon Do, too!  Yesterday I went to Sunday School. Jackie dropped out, I guess. Which stinks, because this is our last year of it and she could've held out for Confirmation. Our teacher is cool, he's an eigth grade Algebra teacher at one of the inner-city schools. He kind of talked bad about me and Melissa and Gjeelea's school and then talked a bit bad about Sev. High, since Sev. is richer than ours and his and whatnot, but he's all in all a cool guy. His mother-in-law was a little creepy at first when she asked for my name, but she's a nice lady too.   Well, that's my story for the day...  Oh, this really interesting RPG starts the tenth, but I don't think I'll be able to join it. Ambassador's Son, or something like that. I'm so tied down with all the RPGs I'm in now, but two are nigh to an end, but still...Dunno.

I want to go actually, and I hope its more interesting and interactive than first through eigth grade of Sunday School was. Yay. For some strange reason, my church does confirmation in tenth grade instead of eigth, so I can't wait for that either.

      Hah...I just feel like laughing right now...  Today I woke up to get to the Girl's Gym lobby at 6:30 AM for XC, since we were going to an invitational at the toughest course in the state and the course that would be used for the state race. Kendra's mum provided breakfast, being the awesome and think-of-everything mom. Then the caravan left OMHS and headed on the hour and a half drive to Hereford High. When we got there it was pouring, but we all did the course walk.  Now, the course really wasn't that bad...until I saw the Hill of Doom (go ahead and laugh now if you're reading, DV!) about a mile and a half into the course. The Hill of Doom features a nearly vertical downhill slope and a nearly vertical uphill slope, with a mere wooden bridge between the two. And on this particularly wet, dreary morning, it featured about five inches of mud and hardly any stable grass. Honestly, it would make a killer awesome sledding hill, but it was just plain suicide trying to WALK up and down that hill for a XC course.  Boys JV race was first. You could literally hear the ground rumble. I didn't even go to the starting line, I just went to the hill to take pictures of all our JV guys. When David got to the hill, everyone was telling the runners to slide down the hill, but David tried running and ended up  ROLLING  down the hill. One boy from a private school gashed his hands up 'cause he fell on a rock running down that killer hill. Not one boy came back clean, and not one boy came back with bragging rights for NOT falling. They all fell. Yeah, all of them.  When they came back, all the varsity girls were getting ready, and the JV guys are all going, "Just slide on your butts down that one hill," and we were all extremely excited to get out there and do something funner than mud wrestling...SLIDE DOWN THAT ONE HILL!   Pain is temporary...Pride is forever...  Guess what? They canceled the meet right after that first race. That pisses me off because all our JV guys had to go through that just to show the officials that the course was too dangerous wet. Not only that...I kinda wanted to go down that hill...y'know, just to know what exactly it was like, and what it would be like at states.  Honestly though, I don't think the entire boys team will make it to states. Larry will, and Kate might, and I am feeling fairly confident that the girls will. But the boys...I just don't know.  And that's my story of the day!

      Turkey day was wonderful. My mom is such a good cook! Especially the mashed potatoes and gravy! That is always my favorite part. The turkey was good too but I didn't eat much of it. About one piece and a lot of the skin. Isn't it strange that the tastiest thing is always the least healthy to eat? It was so incredibly good though!  Then last night we went to see the movie Timeline, and it wasn't crowded at the mall for once! Oh, that is so strange to type and say! Umm, the movie was really cool but I think they needed to work some things out with the whole time cycle thing. I mean, if they were born and went back in time, how did they get born again to come back and do all the stuff they did and go back in time again? And if the Scottish dude stayed, how did he die and then get reborn again so he could go back in time? It's a vicious cycle, and the movie guys could have done a better job fleshing that time idea out. Other than that, I loved it! Especially Marek's accent! Makes me want to go back home to Scotland more and more, just to hear them speak. Yeah, I'll get a boyfriend there and I won't have to watch movies to hear that awesome accent! Bwhahaha.  I'm gonna see John today at three thirty. I can't go later tonight because I'm going to that concert. But it's all good and I get to go to both.   Tomorrow I'm planning on going running with Skwerl and Rabbit's Foot. I love running. Really it requires no skill to  run , just a pair of legs. But the sports like Cross Country and track do require the will to hone the ability to run and use your legs. I know all the other people in sports can run, but I also know that very few of them would have been able to do what we did in Cross Country. Oh, that makes me so proud. I still miss and love soccer though.  I can't wait for school to start again. It's gotten so much easier lately, but I know that midterms are coming up in January so...but second quarter is so much easier than first quarter. The only class I truly hate is Algebra, but that is because it's basically a review of eigth grade math and my teacher is a skunk. I like talking to Amanda and Cory and Sara and RYAN (see, I know the name! *giggles*) in that class. Sometimes I ask Mrs. M stupid questions like why everything we learn we already were taught last year, and I do feel bad about it after I say them but I can't help it! It's sheer distaste for that class! Mrs. M just laughs it off and says I really should join the mock trial/debate team. Pshhhhh....  Grrrr the first day back at school is an A day. I hate A days. They're so boring. Grrr. But then Tuesday is a B day. I lurrrrrve B days. I love Creative Writing and Spanish and ..... well I don't love Algebra but I love Guitar.  Our first indoor track meet is December ninth. I think that for the bus ride there I'm going to wear my Polar Bear pajamas over my uniform just for fun, since we won't have gotten our warm-ups (sweat pants, hoodies, etc.) by then. Our uniforms really suck, and they're white with blue lining and red lettering. I like the Cross Country uniforms so much better, even if they are a cross between wrestling and basketball uniforms.  I'm looking for the perfect notebook. I know that sounds psycho, but you know what? I AM PSYCHO! Okay, on with the show: I am looking for the perfect notebook. My spiral notebooks stink because the covers won't turn the right way, and in composition notebooks it's hard to tear out pages (in fact, it's nearly impossible for me...). I can imagine the notebook now: A folder built in inside the front cover and another folder built into the inside of the back cover and easy-to-tear-out pages. The front cover would hold my artwork; the back cover would hold my music and the pages would hold my writings! Oh, so perfect!  Anyway...

      *sniff*  Arghhh. I talked to Hannah today. She's in B.A. now, and I guess her internet and phone were screwed up for a while. She says she misses OM, and wants me to take pictures and stuff. I will, hopefully I'll remember. I kind of wish she would have contacted me somehow, but I guess I understand that all this packing up and moving must be hard for her. All my friends from school think that her being gone has been good for me, and I have been having a really great year this year. I was curious though.  Anyway...  I'm still catching up on my posts, but I'm almost there. I also thought of this wonderful new story idea, and I'm working it out now.  Oh, I'm so happy. I'm watching Moulin Rouge and writing about ten million different things at once and I'm just so happy. It's finally sunk in that I don't have school AT ALL until MONDAY! Hallelujah! I love Moulin Rouge! *does happy dance*  On Friday my whole family and my dad's friend (and his wife) are going to a concert for the TranSiberian (sp?) Orchestra. It's like classical music meets electric rock. AWESOME! Well, I'm not really into that kind of music, but John's been trying to get me into other genre's of music so I think this will be good for me. Mom and Dad loved it last year, so it's all good!  Everyone at school is coming down with the flu. It's supposed to be really bad this year. Almost the whole sophomore class has it, and I didn't even know until Mandy got it and skipped school for three days, gave it to Krista and Eric, and Kate came down with something too. Those are the only sophomores I really know (besides the other Track geeks *winks*), so I'm waiting for the flu to pass through the sophomores and seniors and weed it's way to the Juniors and Freshmen and eventually infect the entire school so we can all be caught in the epidemic together *takes deep breath*  'Cause we are living In a material world And I am a material girl!'  Madonna and Moulin Rouge. *smiles* My dad thinks Moulin Rouge is corrupt and horrible. He has 'No desire or interest in seeing the movie!' Grrr. I like it, it's so cool. Maybe I drank too much Pop (that's soda for all you North-Eastern people making fun of me!) tonight. *giggles*  I keep cracking my knuckles even though it's realllllllly bad for me.  'We don't need no education We don't need no thought control No dark sarcasm in the classroom Teachers leave them kids alone All in all you're just another brick in the wall...'  I love Pink Floyd. 'If you don't eat yer meat, you can't have any pudding! HOW can you have any pudding if you don't eat yer meat?' The Wall is so cool, but nothing can compare to the Dark Side of the Moon!  Okay, enough chit-chat.  I'm off to write and watch Moulin Rouge at the same time. Yup, people, it's called multi-tasking, and I'm so good at it.

      Hmmmm it's been a while.  Nothing is really going on.   On Monday the 17th we started the indoor track season. A lot of people came, almost a hundred kids. Over half of them were girls. Only seven or eight were freshmen girls. Jenn from soccer showed up, and of course Rabbits Foot. I wasn't worried about the size of our team. By Thursday only thirty girls were left. Granted that is more than the whole Cross-Country team ever was, everyone said that more people would give up by the first cold streak.  On Friday night I went to Kendra's for a sleepover. Rabbit was there, and two girls that I didn't know but were friends of Kendra's: Sam and Mariana. It was so much fun! We went to blockbuster in our pajamas (well,  I   was in my pajamas...) and it was so much fun. We watched movies all night and only slept for two or three hours. LoL.   Then on Saturday we went to the airport and took a flight to Minneapolis. IT WAS SNOWING!!! Whoot! Anyway, we ate dinner at my aunt's house, and drove on south to grandma and grandpa's. We were just there in July and my grandparents aren't doing so well since then. Grandpa fell and apparently it was really bad, and he can barely walk, and the doctors think that his eye problem might be a tumor. That, and his cancer...Grandma is starting to lose her pretty red hair from the chemo.   We just got back today, and it's all good. I have a lot of catching up to do, and none of it is for school. *grins*  I have a lot of posts to write up, a lot of people to talk to, and a whole new story idea to write up!   I love having a week of vacation though!

      Hey everyone.   I tried to update the layout, but I had computer troubles so I just changed the title and the header/introduction. I'm computer challenged, okay? Lay off....*grumbles* Nah, just kidding.  Ahh, so indoor track starts Monday. Fun, fun, fun! Goodie. No, really though. I'm scared to death that I won't do well in track, but maybe that's just because I did so well in Cross Country (got my Varsity letter and everything on Wednesday!) and I don't want to fail. Ha! That sounds so melodramatic, I know, but what can you do?   Amanda seems to be having good luck with boys. Good for her! And I won't say anything more, lest I be "damned to the furthest reaches of Hell by the power of the Almighty Lord" (sorry for using the name in vain! Amanda's sorry too!) and never spoken to again. Hey, that sounded melodramatic too, but what can you do?   Kendra and Keniesha and I are going to have a big sleepover on the 21st, apparently. I dunno what we're gonna do, but they're two of my best friends, so I trust them. OOH! Maybe we could go see The Cat In the Hat! I live for those kiddie stories. I watch the old animated Grinch every year. Well, its a VHS tape so we have to watch it in Shelby's room, but its tradition. I also love thing 1 and thing 2 from the Cat in the Hat, so...  Man, I've been writing poetry like a maniac. I swear, its like I'm a poetry monster all of a sudden. Not all of its good, I know that for a fact. But it's poetry, and it's MINE! All MINE! Created entirely by ME! It's all because of the poetry assignment in Creative Writing. Dr. M said she got a reporter from the Washington Post to come and do a spread on our "Coffee House" that we're having in late Dec. COOL!  Things Accomplished:  1) U.S. Government Report/Current Event on the Executive Branch - Completed in thirty minutes and written on the partial-birth abortion bill...well, law... 2) Nine pages of chapter one (of book TWO!) - Completed in one and a half days with a serious philisophical discussion...kind of...err... 3) Watched "Finding Nemo" twice. DORI IS SO COOL! Oh, and that French cleaner crab, Jacque, is so cool! 4) Finished thirteen poems for Creative Writing - Completed throughout this week, and more are to come, I'm sure.  Things To Do   1) Run sometime before Monday, since track starts then. Gargh. 2) Rearrange my room, so that my stereo and my keyboard, guitar, and other music stuff are all near the same wall. That sucks when I want to play along to a song and my stereo is on the other side of the room. Especially since the battery to the stereo remote mysteriously disappeared...*eyes dart* 3) Figure out what Math homework was! *scratches head* 4) WRITE MORE! *giggles* 5) Errr....I'll get back to you...  YAWN! G'night, people!

Everyone on the team was there except for Katharina and Allison. The people running were Larry, Kate, and the Varsity boy's team. I guess Coach Lawton didn't want to hack up the cash for a nice coach bus for the STATE MEET, so we took a crappy yellow school bus. The ride was a little less than a hour, since we were going to that dreaded place that you might recall from a month and a half ago: HEREFORD! Y'know, the course that was perfectly fine and hilly except for that one "killer" ravine hill? Yeah, there.  It was freeeeeezing out! Kendra and I bought shirts, and then we got hot chocolate before going to watch the boy's 3A school race (we were 4A, so our boys didn't go yet). We went to the one hill, and to our relief, not one person fell during that race. Will Eden was supposed to win, but he got beat out at the last 100 metres. Poor Will. Then we waited around for a while and made David get us hotdogs (LOL!).   Then we ran back down/up that one hill to watch our boys run the 4A race. None of them fell, thank the Lord, and Larry did pretty well. He got fourth in the state, but he was disappointed in himself for not getting under seventeen minutes. Err, his time was 17:00:05, but whatever. That's about six or seven minutes better than my time! LoL. I just don't get Larry. Umm, Tommy and P Berry beat Pappas, and Pappas seemed really surprised about it afterwards. Other than that...yeah, nothing.  Then Kendra and I ran BACK down/up that one hill for the third time to watch the girl's 3A race. We were rooting for SP and Annapolis because they were the only teams we recognized from the season. Whoop Whoo.   Grrrrr. Then we went back down/up that one hill to watch Kate run in the girl's 4A race. Of course, Lauren C. from the Bruins was first place in that race. Her time was 19:01:01, and she beat most of the good  guys   that ran. I was happy for her though, and she deserved this because since she started running as a Freshman, she hasn't lost one race (or so I've heard). Good for Lauren. Kate was upset because she didn't do as well as she did last year. Ok, I don't get Kate sometimes either, since her time was good too, and at least she made it to states.  Then we went to the awards ceremony, and yada yada. Larry got fourth and got a medal and we left for home.   On Sunday I did nothing. On Monday I did nothing.  Today I started Book Two, finally! Everything is posted at: www.fictionpress.com/~dreamsong Under the story titled, "Song of the Sea" It is the unedited version though, but I'm okay with it.  YO! *giggles* Time for bed!

      So we were at the Regional Cross Country Championships and...  Larry got first place for the boys race, and is thusly going to states this coming Saturday. Kate got sixth place for the girls race, and is thusly going to states this coming Saturday. The OM boys TEAM got sixth place by TWO POINTS, and is BARELY going to states this coming Saturday. The OM girls team got fourth place by TWENTY-THREE points (argh!) and is thusly NOT going to states. My season is over.   At least I beat Jessica.  Yeah, that's right. I kept cheering her on, telling her not to walk the hills, and those walked hills came back to haunt her when I sprinted the last three-hundred metres. I was flying, I swear. Not even bragging, either, because I am in no position to brag compared to Kate and Katharina, but I just   felt   like I was flying.   I feel so bad for Alex, though. Coach had to send in a roster of ten names, and that was the roster he could pick from for all the final meets (Counties, Regionals, and States). He forgot Alex. If your name wasn't on the roster, you don't get a tag. You haven't got a tag, you sure as hell aren't going to run. Colin would have been next in line, but he said that he "wasn't going if I'm not going to run." So, he would have actually ran if he had gone! Gasp. So, Chris K. had to run. Chris did pretty well.  We were all happy and cheering when the boys got to states. By two points. Coach had a look on his face that spelled out his complete disbelief, which confirms his unconfident manner with his team, and I knew he wanted to say (but didn't) "No (maybe the F word? Nah) way. No way."   Anyway, so my season is over. I still have to go to practice though. Argh. Oh well. Track is up soon.   I went to the Homecoming game today. I didn't really pay attention to the game that much but I know we won, only by like one touchdown. I love football, but not on the high school level. I was too busy hanging with Kendra, Marisa, and Robyn. I got to see Matt again, my old paper boy. He really is a nice guy, but I don't think he likes me at all, not even as a friend. Which I don't understand at all, because I was totally not mean to him in Middle School like SOME PEOPLE!  I need to lighten up, despite the fact that this week hasn't been the best week of my life. Some quizzes and happy sappy music will do me good for one night.      urlLink         *insert notorious giggle here*        What Is Your Battle Cry?        Z ang!

      Wow. Seven more hours and another year will have passed. Mom's birthday is at 3AM technically (Yes, she's a New Years baby) and that will kick off another New Year. A whole year gone by. That's good. In many ways to me it's felt like 2004 for a few months. I'm totally ready for another clean slate. Actually, it never feels like a clean slate to me until the next New Years rolls around and I realize how different I have become.  Six things that 2003 taught you: 1) High School isn't the hell that I feared - Middle School was as bad as it got (so far!). 2) Friends are good things to keep around. 3) There is a major difference between "good" and "best" friends. 4) Trust is a privelage - You earn it and have to keep it; it's precious. 5) All you need is love. 6) People play favorites, even if they're convinced that they don't.  Six new people you've met or became close with in 2003: 1) Keniesha. 2) Kendra. 3) Sara. 4) Amanda. 5) David. 6) Ryan.   Five things you want to do in 2004: 1) Get organised. 2) Learn how not to let things bother me... 3) Show people that I can do what they didn't think I could (that probably makes no sense to anyone but me and Kendra and Keniesha). 4) Remind Kate that she's only a Sophomore and that she was a Freshman too, once, since her head seems to have gotten really big. (This will probably be achieved through Track). 5) Be more confident.  Nine personally significant events of 2003: 1) I turned fourteen. 2) I started High School. 3) I got a general idea of what I want to do with my life. 4) I lost people I thought were "friends" and gained people who I  knew  were friends. 5) I found out that even though soccer isn't my thing -- running is. 6) I realized and learned what things I could never live without. 7) I started choosing my own path for who I am and not letting others choose for me. 8) I let the real me come out (Oh, this is funny). 9) I'm happy.  Five things I don't want to do in 2004: 1) Lose all my new, closer friends. 2) Die. 3) Have anyone else I love die (that's a hard thing). 4) Rush life. 5) Grow up too soon.  Six songs that you over listened to this year: 1) My Last Breath/My Immortal - Evanescence 2) The Saddest Song - The Ataris 3) Mephistopheles Returns/Maybe Then - The Tans-Siberian Orchestra. 4) Empty Handed/One of These Days - Michelle Branch 5) Another Brick In the Wall Part Two/ Comfortably Numb - Pink Floyd. 6) My Greatest Day / And I Ran (Cover Song Flock of Seagulls) - Bowling for Soup.  Seven things you truly regret from 2003: 1) It took me so long to get rid of (or be gotten rid of) Alex and Paula and them. 2) All else is trivial. 3)  4)  5)  6)  7)   Five things you wish people understood about you: 1) I'm a lot more fun once you get to know me. I'm not good with first impressions. 2) Music is my lifeblood. The arts are my needs. 3) Running is important to me, so is Tae Kwon Do. 4) I am a good listener, really, I am. 5) I am independent...and headstrong. Get over it. :)  BRING IT ON, 2004!!!!!!!

       Today's feature presentation:    Payback's a Killer (Bitch)   I haven't slept in once this whole winter vacation. Not once.   Last night I went with Mandy to a lock-in at the firehouse. We took a bus to go and see Train Gardens set up by other fire stations. Then we went back to the firehouse and hung out. Everyone was determined not to go to sleep because Joe had threatened to 'get us' with shaving cream. So we decided to wait for him to go to sleep and 'get him' with shaving cream and blue hair spray/dye. Mandy made an attempt but got sprayed with Joe's CoolWhip can in return. Yeah that stuff smells like fish if you don't keep it in the fridge or eat it.   Then we all started getting tired. This little girl who was about 12 had all this makeup out saying she was going to draw on people's faces. Yeah, she got me about twelve times when I didn't expect it and so I had blue and brown and pink eyeliner and lipliner all over my face. Eventually I got pissed off enough and when she dared to ask me if I was mad I told her that I was really mad and that if she touched me again I would take the blue hair spray/dye on her. This made her go into the girl's bathroom and cry. Mandy went in to see what her problem was and she said that she was crying because when I was around she wasn't having any fun. *rolls eyes*  Okay, so everyone but the chaperones are sleeping by 5 AM. Then Miss Sue tells someone to wake me and Mandy up since we were leaving early at about 6. Others start waking up, including the crying 12-year-old named Sarah. Lots of people stay asleep though. Sarah goes around with shaving cream and sprays Joe, Robby, Kelly, and three other people in the face. Then Joe got so mad that he grabbed the shaving cream from her and sprayed the remaining parts of the can in her hair on the top of her head! Sarah starts wailing and crying and goes to the bathroom, slipping on cream on the way and falling to the ground once or twice.  When she walks out Miss Sue laughs and says 'Yeha, Payback is a killer, ain't it?' and everyone starts clapping and cheering for Joe. Everyone was so incredibly pissed at Sarah that they were clapping for her shaving creamed - hair. Yeha! Then she went and cried some more in the bathroom as the guys cleaned up her shaving cream mess.   And now I haven't slept in over 24 hours.

      Ummmm okay.  On Tuesday morning I set my alarm clock to go off at 7:00 so I could get ready for track at 8:30. My dad comes in my room at 8:15 and asks me if I'm going, because I was still in bed, with my alarm clock going off! Apparantly it wasn't loud enough so I slept right through it! Grrr. So I got ready in five minutes and we left at 8:20 and got to the track at just a bit after 8:30. Coooool.  Wednesday night we went to 7PM Christmas mass. It was very cool with the caroling and whatnot. The girl behind me was very annoying, though. She recited (well, murmured) everything that they say at mass (like, when Father Nick begins the mass and starts the first reading and blesses the bread etc.). If it wasn't something they say every mass she would repeat it and follow along, whispering everything they'd say. She sang (VERY LOUDLY) along with every song, which, uhh, I sang too, but uhhh...okay so her singing was very good. Nevermind. Scratch that. I dunno I guess the only reason I'm ragging on her is because the rest of the mass was so perfect that I can't really make fun of anything else. *laughs*  Thursday morning was very cool. Lots of gifts for everyone, and everyone got what they wanted, I think. I didn't get a lot of clothes because my parents are always afraid it won't fit or I won't like it, so I got some gift cards. I got a few Guitar Hangers so that my dad can hook them to the wall and I can hang my guitars up on the wall. VERY COOL! OH YEAH! Ummm a book about Joan of Arc (I'm obsessed, and her story is why I'm so anxious to get Confirmed) called "Joan d'Arc in Her Own Words" and I got the DVD Joan of Arc (the version with LeeLee Sobieski in it). Very cool. Ummm, I got a few CDs, lots of candy/chocolate, ummm. OH YEAH! My dad bought me a white Tae Kwon Do uniform! Oh, I know that you're thinking, well, uhh, white belts have white uniforms. Well, he got me the white pullover-tunic uniform with a black collar, which means only black belts can wear them! Ooh I've wanted one since I was a red belt, and thought of getting one for myself ever since I got my black belt back in early April. Yay for white uniforms! Oh, I also got a lot of Navy stuff! GO NAVY!  So we spent most of Thursday doing the Christmas thing and watching our new movies etc. Uhhh, what else....Grandma Char called. She sounded lonely, and I know she misses Grandpa. Dad says it's probably that she's tired from the Chemotherapy. I dunno.   Today I went to track practice and came home and finished cleaning up my room. Then at 12 mom took me and Shelby to the mall to take advantage of the after-Christmas sales. We didn't spend much of our money or gift cards, since most of the clothes and stuff at the mall is the same old stuff just on sale. So we left and came back home. I cleaned my bathroom so it's spotless and beautiful, because Aunt Kathleen and the twins (Mark and Brad) are coming down from Michigan tonight. They got stuck on the Pennsylvania turnpike so they won't be here until Midnight, they said.  Anyway, I have to go hide my cats for when the twins get here. I know they're only ten days younger than I am, but they're obsessed with attacking the cats! I also need to figure out a way to keep my room safe in a way that they can't lockpick! Those darn troublemakers! They're still kind of cool, though! Honest...

      Oh Lord so much has happened in the last week!  On Monday the fifteenth Grandpa Bernie died in the home that they'd put him in three days previous. He was 81 years, 11 months, and 21 days old. He died while I was at school running track. Thank God we went to visit during Thanksgiving and not for Christmas break, or we would have missed seeing him by a mere week or so. I miss him so much! Oh God it's so hard to think that I'll never see him again! It's so hard, but thanks to all my friends and acquaintances, the pain isn't nearly as hard to bear as it could have been. Everyone is so supportive! I love ya'll!  Not much happened on Tuesday.  Holy crap (it sounds so vulgar, I know, but this is sooooo weird!). On Wednesday I go into third period Biology and it's business as usual until 11:55 when our D lunch bell was supposed to ring. Well, it was supposed to ring...but, well...it didn't. Then the Principal comes on the announcements and blares out: "NO ONE HAS BEEN HURT, I ASSURE YOU!" and then his voice calms down and he doesn't explain why anyone would be hurt in the first place, and insteads decided to explain that police have surrounded the High school and two connected Middle schools and, alas, that everyone would stay in their third period classes. This means that the C lunch kids were stuck in perpetual lunch-ness while we poor, deprived Science hall students were to get no lunch.  12:00 ticks by, and Mrs. McC pops in the DVD "Finding Nemo".  12:30 ticks by, and Principal comes on the announcements just to reassure that despite the fact that we have NO IDEA WHAT IS GOING ON....no one has been hurt. 1:00 ticks by, and all the tenth graders in the class that failed last year start complaining that they're hungry and that a movie about fish does nothing to help. 1:15 ticks by, and Mrs. McC goes to the bathroom, and everyone gets pissed because they're not allowed to go to the bathroom. 1:30 ticks by, and Finding Nemo starts winding down. 1:55 ticks by, and Principal comes on the PA system and says that he sent a letter for the students to bring home and that students will be dismissed shortly. 2:15 ticks by, and the students are let out of the classroom twenty minutes later than their usual school-ending time.   We were only allowed out of two exits, and the police only searched boys with ski caps and baggy clothing. No one was allowed anywhere on the bottom floor after dismissal without a teacher unless they were going to the exits. Thusly I was not allowed to get my WINTER COAT. Grrr. All after school activities were canceled. I go outside without a letter since Mrs. McC forgot to give us ours. And, with my incredible luck, it's pouring outside and my bus isn't there.  The buses started leaving, and my bus and one other bus had yet to arrive. Again, with the apparant occulation of any luck I once (or [n]ever) had, it began to hail outside. And I with my simple long-sleeved T-shirt on. 2:30 and my bus still hasn't showed up. IT STARTED TO SNOW. Yes, snow. Then my bus showed up at 2:45.   I found out more about the 'incident' on the 4 and 5 o'clock news than I did from our dear old Principal. Apparantly some student smuggled a gun into school and shot it in the gym hallway. I guess NO ONE WAS HURT, as Mr. L kept on insisting over the PA. And, for a news update: the boy who brought the gun to school was apparantly caught while I was in Minnesota. Yay.  We had to delay our flight for MN from Thursday night to Friday morning. EARLY Friday morning. So I wake up at four AM on Fri. morning to catch the flight. Black clothing in tow, I was met with about half an airport full of US Army dudes and dudettes going home for the holidays. I was filled with some kind of pride that only the sight of one Army guy being chastised by my retired Senior Chief in the Navy mother for putting his bag over his shoulder when wearing his dress uniform.   Friday was the wake. It was incredibly sad. So much sadder than I'd anticipated. I couldn't go up to the open casket. I couldn't. Aunt Sondra said she'd go with me if I wanted her to, but I didn't think I could. Then Jovana took me up there, and I couldn't bear it. His face....it was so....sunken in....  Anyway...  Saturday was the funeral. I said goodbye to grandpa and the service was very nice. Jo said a poem and Uncle Gary spoke during the commentation time. They played Amazing Grace.   The rest of Saturday and Sunday was spent visiting with family. We got home today at 5:30. I was so happy to be home. Now apparantly I have track practice tomorrow at 8:30 AM and I need to find a ride home since my mom can drive me there but not back.   Christmas is in two days, I think. Oh and on Christmas-Eve-Day I'm going with my dad and Jett Robb (LoL) to see Return of the King. Oh God I've wanted to see it for so long but it's been such a busy week. Then I'll go to Midnight Mass on Christmas Eve since that's the one with the candles, and then it will be Christmas Morning!  Oh, but how I wish it was that simple.    You are a freeform writer. Individualistic with a sense for the different and challenging, Walt Whitman and his poetry lacking meter and rhyme is just what the doctor ordered. You're quick to write something that the rest of the world doesn't accept as poetry, quick to separate yourself from the average joe. An author with a true sense of self, you have confidence in your abilities and aren't afraid to show it. :) GO YOU!    urlLink   What's YOUR Writing Style?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla    Yuppers, that's me!                 50%          How Dumb Are You?  by  The Traveller       Awwwwwww I wish I could touch my tongue to my nose! *sticks tongue out with sarcastic stupidity*           Which Founding Father Are You?

      Saddam Hussein has been captured.  Really, I don't think I was really  for  the war in Iraq at all (I mean, what ever happened to finding Osama and hanging around in Afghanistan?), but I'm a military child through and through, and I think this is a good thing. I found it really strange though that for some man who was willing to stand his ground despite threats of war just willingly gave himself in. He had a gun, but NO shots were fired. I just found that strange.  I seriously seriously hope there is no school tomorrow. I CAN'T TAKE IT ANYMORE! I can't wait till holiday break. Five more days, five more days, five more days....*mutters feverishly*

      Today I went to Church for a teen Christmas Project. All the Middle Schoolers and four of us High Schoolers (even though it was supposed to be a HS thing in the first place *rolls eyes*) came to Church and made pretty bags and filled them with donated goodies for the people less fortunate during the holiday season. Then we made disgusting sandwiches made of rye bread, mustard, some mix between salami and bologna, and nasty cheese. Yummy.  I'm so tired.   It's supposed to rain/sleet/ice/snow on Sunday, so hopefully we won't have any school. That's an A day so I really hope we don't have school. I love B days.

      Oh God it's been such a hectic week.  Mom left for a business trip on Tuesday in California. So basically that means dad is cooking all week...errrr...and Mom is coming back Friday around midnight. That will be a good day, despite the fact that by then I will have collapsed in a coma from lack of sleep and over-extending my physical energy. *sigh*  Tuesday right after school we got on the nice coach buses for the first track meet at PGSLC. Girls got one bus and boys got another, since the coaches said it would be easier to keep track of who's there and who isn't. I sat next to Jenn, and Kendra came and sat with Keneisha. The bus ride there was only about 45 minutes, so we weren't too bored.  When we got off it was freezing outside, but when we got inside to the track and field arena it was boiling. Hot, DRY air. We sat on bleachers between Glen Burnie and North East. My event was first! God. Okay, I was only running in two events: the 4 by 8 (or 3200, 2-mile relay), which means four people each run eight-hundred meters, and I also ran the 800m run. The 3200 Girls relay was first! And I was the last girl from our team to run.  We prayed on our pink baton, and walked out onto the track. Emily went first, and she kept up her spot as third in the group. Then Katharina went, and at first she was sprinting hella fast, but as was to be expected, she tired herself out and got us to fourth place I think. Then Jessica went and did really well, and then it was my turn. I think I did okay for my first indoor track race, and I even passed two girls so that our team was in fourth. Cooooool. Not bad, not bad.  But my next race wouldn't be until about three hours later, so I watched all my other OM buddies run. Most of the girls ran sprints, but Kathleen and Kate ran the 1600 (one mile) race. Umm, we had only one disqualification, and it was on the 500m dash. I think it was for a false start.  The second to last race was my 800m race. I was in the 3rd heat, and there were about ten other girls along with me. Coach Keith teases me now saying I'm the best starter on the team since I didn't let those girls shove me to the back of the line. I did pretty well on that race.  We left the arena at about nine oclock, or close to that. We got home at 9:40 and I didn't get a ride home and walk through the door until 10. I took a shower and finished the last of my homework and didn't get to bed until 11. I was so tired on Wednesday. So tired.  Ummm, today was okay. In US GOVT, only seven people passed this one Division of Powers test we took a few weeks ago, so everyone but the seven people had to retake it. So we all (yeah baby, I'm one of the people who passed it!) moved to the back and got to do whatever we wanted for twenty minutes. I passed notes with Amanda and Sarah and listened to music.  Then today we did our run-a-thon for Track. I got three pledges, btu they're all from my family. One dollar a lap from dad, one dollar a lap from mom, and twenty cents a lap from Shelby. I ran six miles (I know, it's slow for me, but hey, I feel like jello by the end of the week), or 24 laps. Whoot whoot!  I need to go do some homework!

      HAH! NO SCHOOL!   My mom woke me up this morning at 5:30 and said she had bad news. I was like, "We have school, don't we?" and she said, "No, there's no school." I was so happy! Then I went back to bed and didn't wake up until 7:30, and even then I just went upstairs to see the snow and go sleep on the couch. I feel so rested, and not only that, but on Monday it's a B DAY again! YES!!! I'm so glad we had no school today. THANK YOU, SNOW!!!

      Oh Lord, Monday.  I asked my mom to wake me up this morning, since I kept setting my clock over the weekend (You know, to get back into the swing of things) and I was either sleeping through it or it just wasn't going off. Anyway, my mom knocks on the door and says, "Wake up, Mal, it's six oclock." You know what I said? "Yeah, so? Why are you waking me up so early?"  Argh I just hated it today. I would have been more awake if it had been a B day. I love B days.   On my current event report for US Govt about the new law (which they're already challenging) about partial-birth control I got an A. 100%, in fact. Go me. I think it's just because I'm very opinionated on current event projects and whatnot. Anyway...  *Sigh* There's not much to say now...  We decorated our home for Christmas yesterday. Oooh ahhhh. Our house looks really cool outside and our tree is really pretty. We started lighting the Advent wreath yesterday too. Christmas will be here soon, and all I have for gifts for others is Lacross balls for Shelby.  I have to go shopping...grrrrrrr

      Oooh. Tests. Exams. Oooh, so much fun. Mucho fun...   Thursday  I had Biology and Government exams. It was a two hour late opening into school because of the icy roads and stuff, so I was all awake for the tests which I guess kind of helped. Biology had four BCR's and the rest was I think 65 mutliple choice questions. It wasn't too hard but there were some questions that I had to read about five times just to figure out what the hell they were saying. Confuzzling. Then I went to the break and hung out in the one spot that I always did...dunno why...but for some reason everyone was acting really hyper. It was strange...Then I went to Government with the eighty-year old pregnant man (*cough*BRIGHT*cough*) and it wasn't half as hard as I thought it would be. THe only trouble I had was remembering what the hell the different economic systems were and the legal ways to change a law. Other than that I don't think I did too bad.   Friday  I had Creative Writing and Spanish II. Creative Writing required us to be exhaustingly creative on our exam with a total of two hours to be able to be such. I think I did well on everything but the One-Act Play part. What the hell is a 'dramatis personae'? I said it was the stage directions! Hah! I guessed. Completely. But then we got our final projects back and mine was a 300/300. I was very pleased. Then I went to the break. It kind of sucked...I don't know...nevermind. It wasn't good, but it wasn't bad. Kind of...Blah. Keniesha gave me sour cream and onion pringles so my breath was stinking. LoL. I admit it! Then Spanish was pretty damn easy since it was all multiple choice.   Track was boring. Jessica 'broke her foot' so I wanted to take her spot in the 3200m Relay so I could maybe get that last point I needed to get my letter, but NO! Emily came up and said 'For the 3200 sign up me, Kate, AMY, and Katharina'. Urrrrrgh I was so mad. So I made my own 3200m Relay team. There's no way in hell we can beat Kate's team *rolls eyes*, but me, Shanika, Brittney, and Sarah can run our asses off! I'm also doing my usual 3200 open, the damned 2-mile.   Today was boring. Oh, but good news - I got an A on my English Exam! Whoot! She told us during attendance. I was happy. Eeeeeee.

      Hmm. I ended up getting three days off of school and then tomorrow it's gonna be a two hour late opening. Sounds good, ne? Except I'm really worried about that last regular meet on Feb. 3. Because if we have school on Thursday, Friday, and Monday to complete Mid-Term Finals, then Tuesday and Wednesday will be the in-service workdays off. That means that with no school on Tues, we won't have a meet. They'll either cancel it entirely or postpone it. I need two more points to be Varsity. But if they cancel the meet than that would lower the number of points needed, since it goes by having an average of one point per meet. I can only pray.  I've done nothing more than write this whole three days. Oh, I slept and watched movies, too. Other than that...not much. Hmmm. I want to take pictures at the next Track meet. I've been scrapbooking everything.   I've been a little sad lately, too. I guess only Keniesha and Kendra know why, but I'm getting over something...or trying...teehee...but it sucks. Loving someone who doesn't love you back. It hurts. Please don't laugh at the sappy songs I add to this now!   I'd Rather Be in Love  I cannot help it I couldn't stop it if I tried The same old heartbeat Feels the emptiness I have inside And I've heard that you can't fight love So I won't complain 'Cause why would I stop the fire That keeps me going on  Turn out the lights now To see is to believe I just want you near me Just want you here with me And I'd give up everything Only for you It's the least that I could do  [Chorus] And when there's you I feel whole And there's no better  Feeling in the world But without you I'm alone And I'd rather be in love With you.  Why are we afraid to be in love To be loved I can't explain it I know it's tough To be loved  Okay, so I guess I need to study. *Sighs*

      No school today!   I woke up at 5:30 to take my shower or go back to bed if it was canceled, and my mom said that they hadn't decided! They'd decided to close every other county, but ours couldn't make up their mind! I mean, hey, there was only like a foot of snow on the ground! I think it was some serious bull that they couldn't decide, considering that people need to get to their buses at 6:30, they should decide by five so people can get ready! Then I slept till six and my dad called to say there was no school.  Then I slept till nine, watched TV until ten, and here I am. Watching the snow fall, writing, and studying. Okay, well I'm not  really  studying, but it's encouraging to say that I am.   I dunno. I feel like going ice skating. Maybe I could call Kendra and Keniesha and go ice skating with them. Or have a snowball fight, but then again I don't feel like putting on a bunch of snow clothes stuff.   Have you ever met someone who liked to say they were the best at everything? Someone who also owned the best of everything? In short, someone PERFECT? Or, someone who liked to pretend to be perfect? Man, it sucks. Maybe I'm just jealous. Maybe. No! I'm never jealous! I'm perfect! No, wait...that made no sense...oh well. Nevermind.  I haven't run in almost a week. It sucks. Especially since I need to win that meet on the third of February to get my letter. I guess we don't have practice today though...teehee...

      I've been feeling like serious crap since the weekend started. I haven't gone anywhere at all. I just don't feel good, I feel lethargic. Amanda came over yesterday, but other than that...nothing. I hate it, but I just don't want to do anything. The only productive things I've done all weekend was sleep, play guitar, fold laundry, and study. Pathetic.   Mom and Dad say there's a huge chance that there won't be any school tomorrow. That's good. Really good. That gives me an extra day to study and not worry about the Government final. So, yes, I really want snow.   Quizzesssssssss.

You've been warned!    You are a  PHOENIX  in your soul and your wings make a statement. Huge and born of flame, they burn with light and power and rebirth. Ashes fall from your wingtips. You are an amazingly strong person. You survive, even flourish in adversity and hardship. A firm believer in the phrase, 'Whatever doesn't kill you only makes you stronger,' you rarely fear failure. You know that any mistake you make will teach you more about yourself and allow you to 'rise from the ashes' as a still greater being. Because of this, you rarely make the same mistake twice, and are not among the most forgiving people. You're extremely powerful and wise, and are capable of fierce pride, passion, and anger. Perhaps you're this way because you were forced to survive a rough childhood. Or maybe you just have a strong grasp on reality and know that life is tough and the world is cruel, and it takes strength and independence to survive it. And independence is your strongest point - you may care for others, and even depend on them...but when it comes right down to it, the only one you need is yourself. Thus you trust your own intuition, and rely on a mind almost as brilliant as the fire of your wings to guide you.You are eternal and because you have a strong sense of who and what you are, no one can control your heart or mind, or even really influence your thinking. A symbol of rebirth and renewal, you tend to be a very spiritual person with a serious mind - never acting immature and harboring a superior disgust of those who do. Likewise, humanity's stupidity and tendency to want others to solve their problems for them frustrates you endlessly.

      Hmmmm. Finals started today! I don't know why everyone says they are so bad, they were so much fun! I was really hyper today. Teehee. Finals rocked! Mine were so easy today. Even though I have the really hard classes left, I still think I'll do fine like I did today. Let me explain!  English was very easy. There were questions about literary devices, like similes and metaphors and personification and stuff like that. There were also a lot of questions about the stories and books we read. Like "Most Dangerous Game" (Connell), "Scarlet Ibis" (Hurst), "Cask of Amontillado" (Poe), "I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings" (Angelou), and "Lord of the Flies" (Golding). All of those were pretty easy. Then we had a lot of essays. They weren't hard though, a lot about theme and the Journies and stuff. Ahh, one big essay was about someone who inspires us, and I wrote about my friend Kendra and my Creative Writing teacher. LoL. I'm such a dork.  Then I went to the cafeteria for the fifteen minute break and spent ten minutes of it looking for Kendra and Keniesha, only to find them back in the same place I started, sitting at the table near Nora, Pepe (Okay, her real name is Brianna!) and these other two girls (I think one of them was Becca? I dunno) and Ryan. Keniesha seemed kind of out of it, but maybe because I didn't have much of a chance to talk to her. Kendra was working on some project for P.E. (tisk tisk, Kendra.) and then the bell rang. I walked with Kendra until she went...errr, Oh yeah! She went to hand her P.E. paper even though she had Drafting. So I went to Keyboarding.  Keyboarding was so easy that I won't even talk about it.  I got home, and Shelby got home two hours later from school since she's a wee Middle Schooler. We actually got along for hours and made cupcakes and a cake for my dad's birthday. I went to Jason's before going out to dinner for dad's birthday dinner, and I saw Coach Keith there, since his wife teaches there. He gave me some really important news: I need two more points to qualify for my varsity letter. Now, I'm on a roll here with getting my Cross Country letter and all, so hopefully at the meet on February 3rd I'll get fifth or better in the two-mile and get those points that I need! Dad's dinner was fun, and we went home and I had a concert for my dad since he wanted to hear me on my guitar. I played "Another Brick in the Wall Prt. 2" For him, since Pink Floyd is about his favorite band of all time. I also played "And I Ran (So Far Away)" by Flock of Seagulls, and "Boys of Summer" by Don Henly. All those good eighties songs! I seem to be obsessed with them lately.  Then my dad gave me the address to his music directory on the network and I'm listening to all these awesome songs! "Inspector Gadget", "Secret Agent Man", and loads of other funny songs! It's fun. Today was really cool. Very awesome.

      Okay, yesterday really, truly sucked, so I won't think or talk about it anymore because what's done is done and the past shall remain the past. Anyway, tomorrow is the first day of finals. I have English and Keyboarding. Both should be pretty easy, I hope. Then on Saturday me and Amanda are going to study together for Government, Algebra, and Spanish.  ARGH! About Algebra....MRS. M was being such a...Okay, I won't curse but...It really sucked. I retook her test on Tuesday and she said she wouldn't grade it and she wouldn't let me take her final unless I had given her a note for that day the bus didn't pick me up - - Remember, the day the office said that they would take care of it, and that it was a LEGAL ABSENCE?? I honestly can't stand Mrs. Meeer-a-bile.  I'm tired, and hungry, but I need to study. MUST STUDY...MUST STUDY...  *studies for five minutes*  *goes and plugs her guitar into her amp*  *ignores computer*  *ignores study review sheets*  *plays guitar*

      Hmmm. Last night we had another meet. Sarah and Jenn did really well, they both got Personal Records. Keniesha went and told all her friends that she won the 300m dash when, technically, she didn't. Well, she did win her  heat  with her and two other people in it, but she didn't win the entire race. Either way she did pretty well, but I don't know if she got a PR (Personal Record) or not because she won't talk to me. She's been ignoring me lately and she won't tell me why. Anyway, I ran the two-mile again. I still did way better than my first race, but I didn't do as good as my race last week. So, I didn't get a PR, but I didn't do horribly. My dad took me home after my race, so I actually got to sleep some. Today we had no practice so it was all good.  Other than that, not a lot is happening. I'm writing behind-the-scenes like crazy on the BD, but I need to get back to actually posting, LoL. I'm working on a new game with Aman, which is incredibly fun but almost confusing just because it's really intricate. Then I have exams starting Friday, and I have English and Keyboarding this Friday. Cooool. But because it's exams I also get out two hours early, at 11:55. I probably have practice though. Grrr.  Keniesha is mad at me. I don't know why. I just don't understand her sometimes. She just makes everything into a joke. Well, scratch that...it just seems like she doesn't take anything I say seriously because whenever I talk to her about something I'm really being serious and honest about she laughs or smiles and doesn't even answer. Then she told Kendra something about Nora not liking her, which I really think is not Keniesha's business anyway, it's just gossip which sucks and I know it does. I need to talk to Rabbit but I don't know what to tell her other than that she needs to keep secrets secret and keep herself to herself and take things seriously when they need to be taken seriously.  Okay. I think I'm done now...

      First of all, this year's playoffs were a serious disappointment. Patriots and Panthers *rolls eyes* Well, you can't get a good match every year. What really disappointed me though was that my team lost to a team that they could've beat, with a play they decided not to run. Oh well, there's always next year. I guess I'm rooting for the Panthers.  Anyway, we had the Puffy Paint Party! We went to practice and did a free run for a while, and then when we came back to get our stuff we went to the track and we all carpooled to Coach Nelson's house. The guys all went to IHOP for a breakfast as their party thing, since we came up with the wonderful paint party idea. My shirt is okay but it does look kind of...weird. I need to wear a shirt under it because I cut & beaded the sleeves red, white, and blue.  I also got my Secret Spirit stuff yesterday for Jenn, since she's the name I pulled out. Not that it stayed secret for long...but I still don't know who has me so I guess it is still kind of secret. Tomorrow morning we're all going to meet in the locker room and exchange gifts. Fun fun fun. Then that night we're going to run. I'm still running the two mile race *sighs*. I always get nervous before a race.   So, the last three days of the first Semester. Then most of or all of my classes will change. I will miss Creative Writing so much. That's like my favorite class. Technically, we do have homework in it, but it comes so easily to me that it doesn't feel like homework. I hope I have all the same people in my classes though. I wouldn't mind changing Government and Algebra teachers, and I'm really glad that keyboarding is only a one Semester class cause  that class is really boring.   Then again this also means that exams are only a few days away...FRIDAY. EEEE! At least the two classes for Friday exams will be easy...English and Keyboarding. Then over the weekend I'll hold a cram study session for all the hard classes next week.  + I _____ Mallory + Mallory is _____  + If I were alone in a room with Mallory, I would _____ + I think Mallory should become a _____ + Mallory needs ______ + Someday Mallory will _____ + Mallory reminds me of _____ + Without Mallory I ______ + Memories of Mallory are ______ + Mallory can be ______ + Worst thing about Mallory is ______  + Best thing about Mallory is _______  Keniesha, you better fill this out and email me! LoL j/k. Anyone else who wants to answer this can, I don't care. LoL I just found it somewhere and put it on here randomly because I'm bored. LoL.

      I went to Peter Pan with Amanda this morning. The boy to played Peter was so cute! Awww. Thimble! Other than that and talking with Aman my day has pretty much really sucked. I got into another fight with my parents, which is typical but this time it was over something so stupid I can't even stand   myself  for it. GAH!!!!!!! I need a hug! *whimpers*  Anyway, I talked to Kevin for a while today. Like, an hour. That was hilarious. I'm not telling you what we talked about, because it was mostly just random crap but...it was funny! Then he invited me to chat and to my horror Corey was in there! He told me to leave and I told him to leave, and all in all it was pretty funny.   Hmmm. I spent a lot of time with my guitar on today. I was going insane with boredom, Keniesha was never online and Kendra disappeared on me. I wanted to sleep but I couldn't, no matter how much sleep I've lost over just this week. I wanted to work on my Creative Writing final story, but I was stuck on this one part where Beethoven first starts going deaf. So, I just hung out in my room doing nothing but playing on my guitar.  So today I didn't accomplish much at all. Nope. Tomorrow for Sunday School we're going for three hours from 5:30 to 8:30, because we're feeding the homeless people that are staying at our Parish. Eddie was talking about it in Government, and Melissa was all, "But I'm afraid of homeless people!" LoL. She is so goofy sometimes. Then on Monday I have the Puffy Paint Party. Fun. Then on Tuesday I'm going to die at the County Meet. I need support, so everyone pray for me Tuesday night and say out loud, "GO MALLORY" no matter where you are. Thank you, it is much appreciated. LoL.  I think I'll go back to being bored again. Actually, I'm talking to Sarah so it's not so bad.

       Music News   A lot of things going today and lately in music. (Okay, you got me, I'm just posting because I'm bored and taking a break between writing posts and typing my Creative Writing story). Anyway, loads of things going on! Some things very cool, and some things very uncool.  1. We all know (or now you do) that the former Evanescence guitarist and front man  Ben Moody left the band a few months ago. I just found out that he has agreed to offer his talents to none other than  Avril Lavigne's  upcoming album. That's sinking pretty low, if you ask me. But also for Evanescence, Amy Lee has got the guitarist from Cold to step in for Moody, and they are also working on their new album, due out sometime this year. Whoot.  2. I listened to Coldplay a lot today. I stole Shelby's "A Rush of Blood to the Head" CD. Very cool. Especially "Scientist". They have such raw passion and emotion, it's so awesome. I wish I had their CD, but I can just steal Shelby's.  3. Whenever I haven't been listening to Coldplay I've been listening to Maroon 5. I love their style, it's very refreshing. It's kind of racy, one or two cuss words and sexual connotations, but it honestly isn't that bad for that. I love it. Especially "Harder to Breathe" and "She Will Be Loved". Very awesome. Very.  4. I started getting through some favorite songs by ear today, my guitar is stretching out of tune from all the string bending I’m doing. It’s very good practice though, and it is very time-consuming, yet fun. I played “Another Brick in the Wall Part Two” for my father the other day; he was very proud and thought it was pretty cool since Pink Floyd was and apparently is his favorite band. Cool.  5. I’ve noticed lately that there aren’t a lot of girl guitarists in the media. Sure, there’s Liz Phair and the Donnas, and that band Lillix (I dare not count Ms. Lavigne, since she knows all of maybe three chords max). But really, not a lot of hardcore, frontwomen playing guitar and rocking out. Sheryl Crow, sorry, forgot her for a second there. Not a lot. Hopefully I’ll help change that someday.   Errr….not much else.

      Okay, so I didn’t get any snow. Like, a dusting, where you couldn’t even see the snow except for the cracks in the sidewalk. So, I woke up this morning at 5:30 and took my shower, got ready, and left the house to get Mandy by 6:30. It was, oh, say about ten degrees Fahrenheit, and we were waiting for the bus. Then it gets to be almost seven and we start wondering where the bus is. That’s when my ears started losing the feeling.  Then, it’s almost 7:05 and we haven’t seen any buses at all. Classes start at 7:17 so we start thinking we won’t make it at all in time. Nikki’s mom called the school then and told them, but they said they hadn’t had a report of a broken-down bus. Then it got to be 7:15 and people start leaving the bus stop, since they’re all freezing. At that point I couldn’t feel my ears at all and my feet were starting to tingle.   Nikki’s mom calls the school two more times and they finally report that our bus driver simply ‘skipped’ a few stops! It was almost 7:30 and we all went home! So I have an excused absence from school (it shouldn’t really be an absence at all since it’s not my fault!) and I have the whole day to myself. It was so freaky. We were making jokes about it! Well, I was making jokes about it. “This is like the Twilight Zone!” or, “This is like Titanic while they’re waiting for the boats! Jack! Don’t leave me Jack!”  So now I’m home, and I can catch up on my Creative Writing project and all my posts on the BD. Cool! Free day! Guess I didn’t need a snow day!

      DAMNIT!!!!! Excuse the language, I just lost a really long long entry that I...eeeeeeerrrrrrrg!  In short, this week has been SO INCREDIBLY AWESOME. All my friends. I just wanted to say that this year has really taught me true friendship and even if I don't know someone that well it's really great and uplifting just to have a lot of people walk by you and say "Hey, Mallory" or acknowledge you in some way. Kendra, Keniesha, Amanda, Amanda#2, Sarah "Hopper", Andy, Jenny, Jenn, Sarah "SARS", Alex, Kevin, Ryan, Catie, Joey, JessJo, and EVERYONE ELSE: YOU ARE THE COOLEST!  Also, at the meet on Tuesday I did way better, I had some Personal Records:  Last week: Overall Time for 2-Mile: 14:57 Split/Mile Time for 2-Mile: 7:13  This week: Overall: 14:23 Split/Mile: 6:56!!!  I'm so happy. I also applied for the Naval Academy and their Cross-Country distance camp. I also brought up my Algebra scores. YAY!   Now if only God would keep granting me awesome days and give me a snow day tomorrow...

      17-17 in overtime, Packers v. Eagles in the playoff games, Eagles win the toss. Somehow Green Bay gets back the ball and then Brett Favre, the veteran quarterback that led Green Bay so far, sends an interception right to the Eagles, the ball flying blindly out of his hands. Inevitably, the Eagles win 20-17 with a field goal kick and the Packers get picked off in the playoffs for the second year in a row. Disappointing. Well, Mr. Jim, I wish your team luck and hopefully the Eagles get as far as they want this year. Brett, sorry 'bout your Father, I can empathize in a way, but I hope that kind of throw never, never, NEVER happens again. Probably my final commentary on Packer's football and football in general until next year.  I finished my Lord of the Flies report on Simon. Wonderful, if I do say so myself, I mean, for only taking a few hours...

      I spent my whole Saturday at the Armory Meet. I didn't have to be there, but I was an alternate for the 3200 Relay and Kendra didn't want to be the only person there to help write down the times of our teams and other teams. So I got up at 6AM and went to school, ready with my blanket and pillow for the long ride to the Baltimore Armory. It was, oh, about 8 degrees Fahrenheit (sp?) outside, and we got a damn cheese-bus (a regular school bus, not a nice coach bus)!!!   Anyway, the ride was about a half hour long, and when we got there we all got off the cheese and walked a few blocks to the entrance of the Armory, to be greeted by Army dudes with guns strapped to their hips and slung about their chests. Then we went in and found a little spot by the corner near the barracks area. There were thirty other schools there, some from MD, some not. But it was cool, all in all. It hurt my butt sitting on the hard ground taking down times, but I guess I'm kind of glad we went. The girls were close to getting a few medals, but they always got fourth place (when you needed third to get a medal) by a few tenths of a second. The guys, overall, got first place, and got a big bowl for a trophy. In any case, after Coach Ward put barbeque chips in the bowl on the bus, Littlejohn somehow broke the bowl from its stand and Coach Limaata wore the bowl upside-down as a hat.  That's basically my weekend. In other news, I wrote up a bio for another RPG (one that I was invited to join, and gladly accepted the offer) and 'unofficially' I am going to join forces (*evil laugh*) with an awesome writer with whom I've already had the pleasure to game, and all is well with the world...except that I have a four-page report due on the character Simon from "Lord of the Flies" including the analogy between him and Christ as saviors for the evils of mankind...something to that extent. Due tomorrow. And it's four-thirty in the afternoon...

      LoL, Britney Spears got married for a total of two or three days (not sure how long) and it was only annulled yesterday. That's so hilarious. *grins*  1) What's on your bedside table?  Alarm clock, CDs, sheet music, guitar picks.  2) What's the geekiest part of your music collection? Teehee, I'd have to say my, "Beethoven's Last Night" CD, a refreshing mixture of Rock and classical music written and produced by the Trans-Siberian Orchestra.  3) What do you eat when you raid the fridge at night? Um....Cheese. Cheddar Cheese.  4) What is your secret "guaranteed weeping" film? Haven't found it yet. I don't really cry in movies.  5) If you could have plastic surgery, what would you have done? I've already had three plastic surgeries (minor ones) on my birthmark, a cavernous hemangioma on my bottom left lip. While a whole lot smaller than when I was six, the damn thing is still there and I want it gone. That's the only way I'd ever get plastic surgery done again.  6) Do you have a completely irrational fear? If so, of what? FAILURE. DISAPPOINTING OTHERS.  7) What is the little physical habit that gives away your insecure moments? Tapping my nails on any hard surface or drumming with my feet.  8) Do you ever have to beg? Errr, nope.  9) Do you have too many love interests?  I don't think so...  10) Do you know anyone famous? Nope.  11) Describe your bed. Twin-size bed, a little raised off the ground because it used to be a bunk bed before we decided to cut it down (since I kept hitting my head on it!) with a flower-patterned blue, green, orange, and red sheets/comforter. BORING.  12) Spontaneous or plan?  Spontaneous.  13) Who should play you in a movie about your life? Eliza Dushku.  14) Do you know how to play poker? No. My whole Dad's side knows, but since we live about 1500 miles away, my sister and I were the deprived Poker children.  15) Do you like to color? No. Requires too much coordination. I prefer drawing.  16) How do you drive? Hah! I don't even get my PERMIT until March 5th, 2005.  17) What do you miss most about being little? Being carefree and not having to worry about the past nor present. Besides, recess was a plus, as was naptime.  18) Are you happy with your given name? I'm okay with it. If I were me, I'd have gone with a different one, but eh. Dem's parents. Mallory also means Bad Luck and Army Counselor, but...oh well. Does it matter?  19) What was the last song you were listening to? "My Last Breath" Evanescence.  20) Have you ever been in a school play? Annie...in fifth grade. Everyone tried out for Annie, including me. You know what I ended up getting? THE DAMN DOG CATCHER! (excuse the language, I'm still a little mad about that...)  22) Do you like yourself and believe in yourself? Eh, sometimes yes, sometimes no.  23) Have you ever done any illegal drugs?  Nope.  24) Do you think you're cute?  Do not utter that word EVER in my presence. *growls*  25) Do you consider yourself to be a nice person? Mostly, unless sufficiently peeved, and then I can hold grudges for years. *grins*  MEET TOMORROW! AHHHH KATE'S GONNA SMOKE ME IN THE 2MILE!!!

      Hmmmm back to school again.  In Creative Writing we're doing our final project, which will be our choice so long as it involves the written word. I sent in my proposal for a music-based short story, and I had something planned but then I tried explaining it to a friend and I realized how stupid it sounded. Really typical, like something with graduated High Schoolers and a touch of the movie, "A Walk to Remember." Of course I would have given it my own flare, but now I just don't like the idea anymore.  Spanish was okay. We started a food unit and hopefully we'll get to eat some actual food. The movie we watched was kind of disgusting, with them gutting fish and whipping themselves at Passover down there in Mexico. But I kind of liked the movie, only because we are going to have a test on it and the movie was in English (=easy notes).   Algrebra sucked, as usual. We split up into new groups, which also sucked because I liked my old seat in front of Cory and next to Amanda and behind the dude with the big head. Then we did a ton of dittos on linear equations...which was totally and completely boring. Grrrr. Guitar was same old same old. Not good, not bad. I got a hug from Kevin, so it made me feel a little better.  Track was okay. Got a meet this Wednesday. Whooo (*lack of enthusiasm*).

      2004! So far, so good.    *HUGS* TOTAL!  urlLink give guitargurlie more *HUGS*     urlLink Get hugs of your own    Hugs? Anyone?  Tonight we're going out to dinner for mommy's birthday. Fun. She unwrapped all her gifts. We (Shelby and I) gave her stuff from Bath and Body Works. Not quite personal in any way, IMHO, but she loved them and that's all that matters.   Argh, it's finally hitting me that school starts Monday and Exams are at the end of the month. We have such a messed up schedule for exams. Well, not really, but I hate exams so I'm just going to diss them anyway. Here's the schedule:   Friday, January 23   7:17 – 7:30       Pd 1 – Attendance and Announcements   7:35 – 9:35        Period 1 A Day Exam    9:40 – 9:50       Break   9:50 – 11:50      Period 2 A Day Exam    11:50 – 11:55   Announcements       Monday, January 26  7:17 – 7:30       Pd 1 – Attendance and Announcements   7:35 – 9:35        Period 3 A Day Exam    9:40 – 9:50       Break   9:50 – 11:50      Period 4 A Day Exam    11:50 – 11:55   Announcements      Tuesday, January 27  7:17 – 7:30       Pd 1 – Attendance and Announcements   7:35 – 9:35        Period 1 B Day Exam    9:40 – 9:50       Break   9:50 – 11:50      Period 2 B Day Exam    11:50 – 11:55   Announcements       Wednesday, January 28  7:17 – 7:30       Pd 1 – Attendance and Announcements   7:35 – 9:35        Period 3 B Day Exam    9:40 – 9:50       Break   9:50 – 11:50      Period 4 B Day Exam    11:50 – 11:55   Announcements   Yep. Then we get Thursday and Friday off to wallow in our self-pity, and convince ourselves to think the worst (that we failed) and hope for the best (that we pass and get the credit). At least on those days we're getting out two hours early! I hope we don't have track practice those days too, but we probably do since the Regionals and States are two and three weeks after the tests. I dunno.  Anyway, give me hugs! I hope all the rest of you High School and College students do well on your Mid-Term exams! Good luck!   Oh, right. HAPPY NEW YEAR!

      Wow, a lot has happened...  Thursday and Friday were boring, really. Actually, they might not have been boring, I just don't remember what happened.  But Friday afternoon I went home on the bus and started packing for the 30-Hour Famine. It's this progect that my church and lots of other churches do the last weekend in February. We go to church, kind of like a lock-in almost, and do things to help the people in Africa and other third-world countries (even the US, I've learned) who are having serious problems with starving people. In any case, I went to guitar practice and then we went to pick up Kendra, who was to be my guest on this starve-fest.  So, now the story of the Thirty-Hour Famine, all set in my Church!  We brought donations and pledges, and we earned enough money to feed six children, each for two years. Or, similarly, twelve children for a year. You know, fifty cents feeds a single child for a day? But we went to church, and there were other kids that came to stay from Saint Andrew's By the Bay, Mount Saint Joe's High School, Our Lady of the Fields, Holy Trinity, and there were ten or so kids from our church. We had loads of fun! For not eating for thirty hours, we had soooooo much fun!  A band came and played while a few of us made posters with pictures from magazines of children, adding some of the facts and figures about starvation. That was fun. We played ice-breaker games so we could get to know the kids from other churches. Kendra, Lindsay, Robert, and I made one-hundred Easter Cards for the homeless children of a near-by shelter. Then it started to get late so we were allowed to watch Bruce Almighty or just hang out for a while. Most of us didn't get too sleepy until we all about passed out at say....one oclock in the morning.   Saturday morning started early. We woke up at eight and started right out with a big prayer. Then we played a game where some of us sat on the floor, some of us sat in chairs with a little brown table, and some of us sat at a beautiful white-clothed table with silverware. The people at the pretty table represented 15% of the world, the part that has no trouble getting food on the table or keeping their family well-fed and clothed. The people at the brown table with the chairs represented 30% of the world, the percentage tht has maybe a little struggle, but everyone is content in their family and gets enough to eat to keep them healthy. They are the people who are flirting with the line of poverty. The people who sat on the floor (Kendra and I got to sit in this section, LoL) represented 55% of the world, the part that is in complete poverty and rarely has enough, if anything, to eat. We read stories about people in poverty from Haiti, Sudan, Egypt, Cambodia, and Bangladesh.  Then we made SANDWICHES! They were reallllllly icky-looking, which is why I hesitate to mention that they actually started to smell like McDonalds. Yes, that's how hungry I was. LoL. They were bologna, cheese, and mustard sandwiches. We made them and wrapped them in something like an assembly line. We made over 600 sandwiches for homeless and poorer people in our County. It was really awesome.  Then we walked around the neighborhood that is next to my church, collecting canned goods that had been set out by the nice people living there. It was really awesome, and people said they really thought we were wonderful young people for doing all the things we were doing during the Famine. After that we went back to church and met a man who'd been to Haiti with our Sister Parish for a week. He showed us some really cool stuff. It was awesome.  We then wrote letters to our Senators and District Representatives, telling them our story and asking for their help to expand the money in the 2005 budget for Food Programs.  We ended with a large prayer. Gail sent around a roll of thread, that faded from one color of the rainbow into another. She asked us to either say a hope/prayer aloud, or say it to ourselves, then wrap some of the thread around our wrists and pass it on. So, when it got back to Gail on the other side of the circle, she said one long prayer with us. When we were done she came around and snipped the threads, and told us to have the person to our left tie our piece of string around our wrist. She said it would help to remind us of what we did to help, and how we could use the things we learned to help others.   Then Gail read a passage from the Bible, and I don't recall where exactly it is (I wish I knew the Bible better) but it's when Jesus washes his Disciples' feet. She had two bowls put in the middle of the circle, and we were to wash someone else's hands from the opposite side of the circle, and they were to wash our own. Gail said it was important to learn not only to serve others, but to let ourselves be served as well.   We all went to 5:30 mass with each other, and then we had a Pot Luck dinner to Break the Fast.  It was wonderful!

      Changed the template. Decided to go for the plain look. Worked out well, ne?  Anyway, today was sooooooooooo much fun! We had a three hour early dismissal. Do you know what that means? Yeah, that means I got out of school today at 10:55! It was so awesome. The schedule was a bit screwed up, because it went First Period, Second, Fourth,  then  Third. All the classes were 25 minutes long except for Third, since everyone needed to eat lunch so it was ninety minutes or something like that.  My dad drove Manda and me to school, because I had my double helix project, made out of Starbursts and Dots. I made it entirely out of candy (except for the coat hanger...) so that if I get a bad grade I can make myself feel better by eating it. Anyway, we got to school and I meet up with Amanda, who's in the main lobby. We go to the science hall together so I can drop off my project, but Mrs. Smith isn't in her room. So I say bye to Amanda and go to the North Hallway and stand with Jenny, Kendra, Andy, Kevin, and Katie until the bell rings.  In Theatre Arts we did a pretty cool warm up. It's like those sentence stories where the starting person starts a story and then points to another person to finish the story. But the thing was that if you say, "Ummm," or pause for more than a second or two, you had to die. And I mean, literally pretend to die. Loud noises, coughing, dramatic falling, the works. It was funny...Then we worked in our Pantomime groups and Jenn was being excessively hyper as always. We have to perform next Wednesday, and we still haven't chosen what to do. Jenn thinks we should just do improv. +roll eyes+  Then I walked with Ryan to Spanish, and found out that I have a report due on March 1st for Mr. Bright from Matt. The thing is, I just know I have it but I don't know what to write it about, because Matt forgot. In Spanish I think we played a game...I can't remember. It all went so fast. Actually, I think I recall taking a notebook quiz or something like that.  So then I went to Bio since it was 1,2,4,3 and Bio is usually my fourth period. I turned in my project and we went over the test before playing a game. Casey is such a goofball! And he cut his hair again! He was yelling at Sean for some reason too....But Biology was really boring today so I guess I'll just fastforward to Math...  Math was boring too. But I actually got all the work (understood it) and finished it all really quick. Alex sat next to me and Nick worked with Colleen and Alayna. Alayna and I complained a lot about the creepy pedophile/child molester that watches us when we are at Carpentry for CATN, and everyone thought it was pretty funny. The scary part was that we were actually one hundred percent serious. Scary Mr. Kovaks....  At lunch I sat with Nora, Pepe (Brianna), Heather, Alex B. and Ali. It was funnnnnny. It only took me five minutes to get my lunch for once! Yay! When lunch ended there was a fight in the hallway that I was walking through, and like everyone was running over the lunch tables in herds to see the fight. I never actually saw it because of the millions of people crowding around it. It was funny! Then I walked with Ryan until he went to lunch and I went back to math.  Then school ended.  Oh! Track starts up again next Monday! Hurray! But then on Tuesday we have the Primary elections and no school. Grrrrr. Oh well.   Today is Ash Wednesday and I was asked to read a passage during the 4 oclock mass. Then I get a cross put on my forehead with ashes. Then I have to go to TKD with ashes on my forehead and everyone will ask me if I fell in the dirt or something. It will probably wipe off by itself though when we start the class.

      Good day. Yes.  I had a test for TKD. It was boring, to be honest. There were so many little kids to direct. One first-timer, but he was okay. It was the little five-year olds that annoyed me the most. It was okay though. Joseph and Daniel got their black belt. Congratulations to them. Yay. I got my 7th Gup. It's all good. I was hungry though when it was over!! Starving, actually...  So I went to see a movie today with Amanda after that. It was fun. Then next weekend I'm going with my buddies maybe to the mall or something. Something. Hey Amanda maybe I should call Chris lol (that dude I showed you after school on Friday). Not that I know his number. He asked me to call him but he has my cell number and I don't have his. Yeah, Sarah gave him it. LoL. That was funny with Josh and Nicole...*laughs*  Hah! Another fight with Paula. It was funny. She seems kind of obsessed with me writing about her. And apparently I'm on her buddy list in the 'hate' section. I'm happy to hear she let my screen name take up a spot just because I happen to be one of the people she hates. It's almost funny. I don't even know why we hate each other. It's kind of funny though. Admittedly I used to be to self-consious to  ever say something about my dislike for her at all, but now I really could care less. Whatever. I'm over it. She can say that we used to be friends like three years ago, but now that I have real friends I could never call whatever it was a friendship. So that's it.   Anyway. Long conversations with Kendra and Keniesha. We're going to hang out more when outdoor starts.  NecromancerJulin: yo guitargurlie89: hey NecromancerJulin: yo guitargurlie89: hey NecromancerJulin: yo you are a chicken guitargurlie89: what?? NecromancerJulin: a chicken gobble NecromancerJulin: wait that a turkey lol NecromancerJulin: haha NecromancerJulin: hmm guitargurlie89: you are so confusing. guitargurlie89: :-D NecromancerJulin: really? guitargurlie89: sometimes NecromancerJulin: most of the time  I'm a chicken, but a brave chicken if I do say so myself. Anyway, heading to the mall on Saturday, as plans have been made now unofficially. Maybe I could hang out either with Amanda or Johnen on Sunday next week. I'm booking up my schedule for no real reason. For things to do I guess. Life gets dull. Life gets boring.   Also, this woman walked into the store on Friday, with a little acoustic guitar in her hands. She set it on the counter and pulled her coat closer to her. Then she asked if we fixed strings and did tuning. I said yes. She laughed, saying that it (the guitar) had just been lying around in the back of her car for about six months. My eyes widened. "You know, leaving your guitar in the cold overnight and for a few months without a case is probably almost as bad as when rock stars smash them at the end of their concerts..." she laughed at me again and just proceeded to give her name and number for when she could come back and pick up her guitar. I felt sorry for the inanimate object. That's a first...So I gave it to Johnen and he took it to the back. Coach Keith's wife teaches vocals and piano upstairs, so I saw him twice. It's almost scaring me out of showing up. LoL.  Awwww I've been so tired lately. May as well go get some sleep...  Good luck to Kevin. Hope you make Varsity!

      *Glomp* Today was boring. Blah...  At CATN Alayna and I made holes in our wall. Yes, we took out our frustrations and smashed holes into our lovely sheet rock. Then we had a fire drill and went outside. It was actually kind of nice outside. Other than that we didn't do much. We are going to plaster our walls next class. We were almost late for the bus but it was all good.   In gym I ditched my Team Sports class and went to play basketball with Daniel, Matt, Brian, Courtney, Katie, Sarah, and this other senior dude that I don't really know. It was fun. Katie told me to knee Matt in the balls, but it didn't work very well and my elbow ended up hitting his face and his foot ended up tripping him and me. It was funny though. Good stuff. Shanika and I talked about the new season, it was cool.  Mr. Bright is such an idiot. Grrr I can't stand him. Gary is such a goofball though, it was almost funny when he asked Mr. Bright how old he was and if it was his brithday. Long story. I gave Courtney the moola for the Quebec trip. It's gonna be so much fun even if I don't speak French. French may be a pretty language but it's not very practical anyway with all those extra consonents. Whatever. But anyway, the Quebec trip will be fun.  Lunch was boring. But I saw Kendra and she randomly told me that Ryan was sleepy. *shrug* English was boring too. I got to grab Andrew's curly hair (FRO BOY!) and yell at Josh, and our subsitute was a really annoying woman named Ms. Leech. How ironic...  So then we go outside (Amanda and I) and I say good bye to Chris (and show Amanda my boyfriend! LoL) and Nicole O. walks by, Josh right behind her before he stops to say bye to us. Then he asks Nicole if she is ignoring us on purpose. So she turns around and says, "Amanda doesn't like me anymore." Hah. My cue. I just can't seem to keep my mouth shut. "She never liked you in the first place." Whoa, how did that slip out? No idea. So she blushes and walks away and Amanda and Josh burst out laughing.   Then I got on bus #10 and talked to Ryan for a second (wrong bus, teehee) and got back on my bus. So today was rather uneventful. I'm going to the movies tomorrow and then on Sunday I might go with Joey to the competition. Might be worth going to. Then I have Sunday School. Blech. Ah well.    "The only thing to fear...is the third lap of the 800."

      Today was funny. Fun. Cool. Not bad...  We turned in our Course Selection Sheets and got our report cards. I did pretty well, but Algebra grades were disappointing to I'm going to try to do better this semester in that class. I got straight A's (As in, for first marking period, second marking period, the Exams, and the final grade) across the board in Biology, English, Guitar, and Creative Writing. I got mixed A's and B's in Keyboarding and Spanish II, and a C or two mixed with A's in Algebra. The thing that dragged me down was the D on the Government exams. Everyone else is complaining to the school. Everyone got Ds and Es, and if they were extremely lucky they got a C. So Mr. Bright might be teaching us, but he's not teaching us to prepare us for the exams. In any case, I've got a 3.5 so I'm happy enough. I'll do better this semester.  Nick Womack and Robin ate Kendra for lunch today. There was a serious oven problem in the cafeteria today...chicken nuggets and turkey...not really...  Awww Bio was soo much fun today. Casey is such a goof. He is so funny. He got his hair cut and everyone felt bad for his cut off hair. I mean, Casey's hair is like his main asset. He's good at flipping it around LoL. Sarah and Jenny and I made a model of Protein Synthesis, which was kind of boring but Mrs. Smith is always boring. Then the bell rang and I went outside to go to my bus and it was so warm out! It was so nice. I can't wait for spring to really be here!  So I was walking to the bus and I see Chris from track. He stopped to say hi to me and I asked him if he was okay because he looked sad (awww). Chris laughed and said it was because he hadn't seen me since the meet. I told him he was full of BS and he said he was serious. Then he asked me out for the millionth time before he got on his bus and told me to call him. *roll eyes*  Meh. I get to see Johnen tonight at practice. I need to find out my breaking technique for this Saturday. Then after the test Amanda and I are going to go see a movie, hang out around Arundel. I don't like Arundel because it's so crowded, but the theatre is the best so I can't complain too much.   Blue feet...

We let two people on the elite team that I don't think should have been let in, but it's not just my decision so...  Report Cards tomorrow! I'm not going to be disappointed, that's all I'll say...

      Eeee a lot has happened. Last night was the State Meet! I mostly hung out with Jenn, Shantel, Durke, and Chris for no real reason. Mr. Al was there, it was hilarious. Anyway, the guys got second, and there were only eleven boys that ran. They each ran more than once, sometimes four times. Kyle got a PR, and Chris Bryant got really far on the Pole Vault. We only lost by about twenty points, but Kyle says we'll just beat Suitland in outdoor. So now I have a break until March 1st. Yay! But then Kendra and Jenn and Keniesha will be back for outdoor, and all will be well.  Amanda that was hilarious! Paula read my blog and got pissed, telling me to "get over it". It was so funny because honestly I'm glad we're not friends anymore. I think the only reason we were ever friends was because our parents knew each other. We were good friends in second grade, but it was all downhill from there. There are others I hate more than Paula. Sometimes I wish I was still friends with Alex, but it's not like we're fighting or anything. We've known each other for too long (almost 12 years!) for us to really hate each other. Well, she can hate me, but I don't hate her. Anyway...Then Paula logged off before I could tell her that I would write what I want and she should get over it. Funny. Heather I know you want to get out the scissors but we need to wait until Graduation day! Wait for it, wait for it, wait for it...  Today was rather uneventful though. I slept in late this morning, and got a ride to school with Tim. Yay. Then in Carpentry we went to a presentation so we could decide what class to take next four weeks. Alayna and I were in the slide show, pounding nails into the dry wall. But let me tell you, never operate with power tools when you're not fully awake...  Nothing else really happened. I'm taking two AP classes next year, since I also am being forced to take Health. So I'm going with Honors English and Honors Chemistry, above-average World Civ. and Geometry, Spanish III, Latin I, AP Music Theory (yay!), AP Music History (maybe?), Health, and either Journalism or Lit. Mag. Sound boring? Yeah, thought so...  Talked to Johnen again today. And Amanda. And Keniesha. And...well, I talked today a lot. I'm going to the movies with Johnen this weekend maybe, and on Saturday I think I might go with Amanda to a movie. MOVIES MOVIES!!!!  Okay, off to see Joseph and Colin!

      The fear of death follows from the fear of life.  A man who lives fully is prepared to die at any time.  ~Mark Twain  Because I could not stop for Death, He kindly stopped for me. The Carriage held but just ourselves And Immortality ~Emily Dickinson   All these things are now before me, Endless death or timeless glory. On this night of ghosts returning To the light of bridges burning!     Final Dream  Lay your head down And sleep on my shoulder Lay your head down Just start a new dream And for tonight The moment is over Drift in a lullaby Here where the stars reside And angels are always seen  So lay your head down The stars they have whispered Hear what they say And know what it means The moon is her guide The stars, they have kissed her As she goes gently by Light as a baby's sigh Safe on a fairy tale stream  And start a new dream...   I recently found out that some of the people I know well have lost a friend that was very close to them. My heart goes out to them and her family, because even though I don't know her, it seems she has touched so many lives in only fourteen years. Besides, the motto of the United States Holocaust museum says that for both the living and dead we must bear witness. When my grandfather died, I was heartbroken because I'd never experienced a death so close to me. After a while, though, at his funeral and after even that, the waves of his life were still affecting people. So, since all I've heard about this person is good, hopefully it will make the world just a little better even with the memory of her.   Since the time when Ra and Isis Raised the sphinx out of the sand And Apollo dreamed Athena So men began to understand  That when darkness folds on darkness In the resltess tides of night And lightning raises shadows Just for moments giving them life   It's been said by those who ponder That it surely is a sign That a life touched by the stars Has now ran out of time   And that somewhere in that darkness In the heart of that great storm The world returns a soul That God caused to be born...

      Ahh, a lot has happened. Whoot...  I had my first A-day classes with the new schedule on Tuesday. First period was Theatre Arts. It was kind of cool, it's right by the gym and Jenn and I have the class together. It involves a lot more work than I thought it would, though, and my teacher is kind of psycho-happy. And Becca's in that class...Then again, at least that one girl from church is in that class, and Jenn and Alix. So is Daniel. Yeah...  Then I have SPANISH! It is so incredibly awesome with Señorita, she's so cool. She's loud and hyper and talks really reall fast, and even faster when she's speaking in Spanish, but she's so cool! We get to eat and drink whatever we want as long as it's not Sunflower seeds. Don't ask...long story. Matt and Matt are in that class, and so are some other people I know but don't really talk to for less obvious reasons...  Then I have Algebra. It's okay, Coach is really cool as a teacher. Makes Algebra fun...ALMOST. And Paula's in that class *cringe*. It's not so bad, except she glares at me sometimes and looks at me as if I had stolen something from her. Oh well...it doesn't bother me as much as I thought it would. So long as she doesn't speak to me...Also...Alex and Colleen and Robin and other people are in there too. Alayna, my carpentry partner. It's fun...usually.  Lunch is cool. Heather's in that lunch. Other people, too....like Kevin! Awwww, and hmmm, I think Catie and P-Berry are in that lunch.  Bio is awesome too! Kacey is in there, so is Jenny and Ali...Marcus and DJ. Our teacher is kind of spazzy but it's all good.   OUR BOYS WON REGIONALS! GOING OFF TO STATES ON TUESDAY BABY! Yeah! We also got five girls into the state championships. Our 4*2 team and Lauren. We have a guy or a team in every single event there is except for the high jump. We are winning states...putting a banner up on that wall for the first time in ten years. Awesome. I ran the two-mile. My end time kind of sucked but my split/mile time was pretty good...Six minutes, fifteen seconds. I was six seconds behind Kate. I guess I went out too fast though! Teehee.  Not much else going on...we started choosing classes. I'm taking AP English, AP European History, Chemistry, Geometry, Latin I, Spanish III, AP Music Theory, Journalism, Guitar III, and they're forcing me to take health as a sophomore. Sounds good, ne? Sounds fun. I signed up for as many AP classes as I could handle! English and Music Theory will be really easy, since I've been passing my two English courses now with 100%s and well, music is music to me. I don't know about AP Eurp. History, but I'll figure it out sooner or later. Latin will be fun...Kendra and Kenny are signing up for that too, hopefully I'll be in classes with them.  My room is a mess...

          99% Of The Internet Loves Me!      I am loved by 99% of the population, including:  811 people who love midwest people  1621 people who love happy people 1121 people who love bloggers  In return, I love 56% of the population, including:  510 people with lots of shoes 653 people talking on cellular phones 143 linux users       urlLink show the love at spacefem.com       Oh, I feel so loved...  Anyway, today was Monday. Monday sucks. I had my first Carpentry class today with Mr. Bury. He's kind of a geeky guy who's really timid. There were only nine of us...he gave each of us a piece of dry wall and a glomp of spakel (sp?) and we drew with the spakel stuff. It was fun.  In gym we played basketball and soccer. It was loads of fun but only because Sarah's class was allowed to come over into Team Sports. How come I made it into Team Sports but Sarah didn't? She signed up for it and all. Whatever. Hmmm....  Government sucked arse today. I'm not even joking either. Out of six classes, only one person got an A on his Final. Only five people got Bs or Cs. Yeah, that means that 90% of us got Ds and Es. And I was one of them! I got a D! I was upset, I wanted at least a C because I have an A in the class. So I wanted a C or higher on the test because I would at least get a B in the class then, but now, how does that D on the test weigh out my A? I was upset but honestly I wasn't that surprised.  In English we talked about sonnets again. We read the famous Sonnet 18, "Shall I compare thee to a summer's day?" Then we read a sonnet about a gay love slave...Shakespeare was a strange, strange man, even though he was brilliant. I got to talk to Amanda and Coooory.  Finally tomorrow I get to go to A-day. I have theatre arts and Spanish, but that's all I'm looking forward to. Nick and Cory are in my Algebra class, so that's good, but there are some not-so-good people in that class too. People who hate me, and I hate them, so we're all one big happy hate-fest. I don't even know why we hate each other. Some people are just really prissy and bitchy sometimes. Anyway, at least Amanda said she was in that class, and hopefully Andy, Brad, Ryan, and Jenny will be in there too because I haven't seen them lately.   Tomorrow is the last Indoor meet! Whoop! I'm running the two-mile. It's at the armory though, and I haven't run there yet. Full of army dudes, and I'm a navy brat. Teehee. Lalalalala. I'm going to go write a sonnet for homework....funfunfunfunfunfun....

Such a sad, intense story, very moving since he composed even though he was completely deaf...        urlLink Take the test , by  urlLink Emily .   Errr....  Anyway, I played scrabble today! Go me. I also sent in a proposal, which was eight pages long in a Word Document! I went to Target for supplies for the new semester. So, I'm all set. Tomorrow I have to go to 12:15 mass because Sunday School is right after that for some unknown reason. Other than that I've got nothing going on. Johnen called, but not much else happened. My life is so boring.

      Hah! I woke up this morning at five AM to get ready for school and my mom said it was a delay. So I made myself pancakes (real ones, not microwavable ones) and my mom left for work and said that there was no school at all. So, basically, I could have slept for five or six more hours...  Practice was inevitably canceled, and Tuesday is Regionals so I guess everyone is running on their own. I'm still going to run the two-mile, and hopefully the Baltimore Armory will be better than PGSLC. I'm going for a Personal Record, (PR) hopefully under 14 minutes, even though my PR is 14:23. My open 800 on Tuesday at PGSLC was really good, I was fifth (would have been fourth, if not for that darned Chesapeake girl). Shanika said outdoor was more fun, and Kate won't be participating, since she does Lacrosse. Sarah's going to do Tennis, but Jenn, Kendra, and Keniesha are all going to do outdoor with me. So I'll be the 'star' two-mile runner, since Kendra is convinced it will take her a while to get back in shape after taking the winter season off. Whatever. My goals are set.   Hmmm. I went to Johnen's yesterday. Fun. That's about the only good thing that happened yesterday. The new classes sucked, and I'm fearing the worst for my Algebra class on Tuesday. I also want to ditch CATN, if only because I feel like I could be doing something more music-oriented, like Music Theory or Music Theatre. Theatre Arts just sounds stupid. So we took Jenn home yesterday after track and found out that Emily and Kyle don't live too far away.   I went through the house this morning and found a plethora of guitar picks that had been lost, found, and lost again over and over in a vicious cycle. I also found my Ataris and Bowling for Soup CDs, as well as the Trans-Siberian CD that my mother had let me borrow. My Evanescence CD is scratched all over, probably from Charlotte scratching her baby claws all over it like she does everything else.  Speaking of which, Charlotte is doing very well. Her ears smell like baby powder (random...) and she gets along with Sundae very well. They like to play together! General Posy misses Midnight still, and he sleeps in the kitty bed that used to belong to Middie. Oh, and a weird thing we found out was that Midnight died a year before Grandpa on the same day...Spoooooooky. But the kitties are doing well. GenGen is the only outdoor one, thank God. We don't want another run-over cat.  Ahh, more bullsh!t with the President. Can't wait for reelection, even though I can't vote. My uncle is getting transferred out of Bahrain (Thank the Lord!) back to London. Mary-Beth is still in Spain for a while. Oh, and in other news, Reagan is 93. Wow. Like I care. Sometimes I can't understand how people like Mr. Bright and Reagan are still alive and perfectly wonderful people like my grandfather are dead. I'm not saying I wish that people like that were dead, I'm just saying that it's not fair. And I know, "Life's not fair" but you know what? It should be. The world sucks, it's almost depressing how horrible everything is. Outside the country, inside the country, inside the damn High Schools even!  Okay, that's my rant for the day. I'm going over to Andy's house then I might go somewhere with Keniesha. Probably won't go anywhere with Rabbit though because I haven't heard from them in a while. Oh well. S'ok.

      EEEeeeeeeee!!!! New Semester, new schedules, new teachers, new electives! Yippee! I miss all the buddies from my other classes terribly, but only one day has gone by so maybe they'll be in my classes tomorrow. I can only hope! Here's my new schedule:   A-Day  1 - Theatre Arts 2 - Spanish III 3 - Algebra 4 - Biology   B-Day   (what I had today)  1 - Center of Applied Technology North, where I'm taking Carpentry for six weeks, Baking/Pastry for six weeks, and Welding for six weeks. Fun. *rolls eyes* 2 - Team Sports 3 - Government (with the same damn teacher! ERRRRRG! I hate that eighty-year old pregnant man!) 4 - English  Today was a B-day. Apparently Amber and I were supposed to get right on the CATN bus and skip our schedules, but instead we went to Advisory and did get our schedules. Thus we missed the CATN bus and waited for two hours in the cafeteria. It was boring as hell. But at least I got my schedule.  Then second period I had Team Sports in the Gym with Coach. There was only one other girl in my class. But P-Berry and Grumpy Gills (LoL Kendra) were in the Weight Training class that same period, Kendra and Shanika were in Aerobics the same period, and Sarah is getting her Fitness for Life that period changed to Team Sports since that's what she chose to begin with. So Yay!   Damnit, I have the same old Government teacher. Yeah, the one who likes to look at girls, had a heart attack last year, and is as deaf as if he had no ears. But Sarah has that class too, so I'm okay I guess. Matt has the class too, and he was my paper boy for a few years so I kind of teased him for it but it's all good.  English. I have a new teacher, and she's an obsessive-compulsive little woman who is completely wrapped up in staying organized. We talked about how Sonnets were all ABABCDCDEFEFGG, 14 lines, 10 syllables a line. It was kind of strange. Oh well.  Then we took pictures for track. I should say what happened at the meet on Tuesday, but it's too embarrassing for words. It was a complete disappointment, but not because of me. Because of one of my teammates during the relay. She just kind of quit. Ran off the track, dropping the damn baton when she only had one last lap to go. Then they told us to go on! WHAT THE HELL! (Excuse the language) We were three laps behind everyone! So I was anchor, and running three laps with the track to myself because of that stupid witch who couldn't finish four laps! HALF A MILE! NOT THAT HARD! It was so frustrating. But my mile and open 800 times were good. I can't wait till outdoor.

      Pick a band and then answer the questions about yourself with their lyrics. Try to answer each question with lyrics from a different song.  1.   Favorite Band/Singer:   Trans-Siberian Orchestra  2.  Are you male or female?:   Ornament    There is an ornament Lost inside the night There on a Christmas tree With a thousand lights  No one can see  her   She's  standing all alone  Somewhere  she  glistens where no one can see   3.  Describe yourself:   What Is Eternal   And here in the night, as I feel the inferno I stare in the dark, thinking what is eternal The man or the moment? The act or the reason? These thoughts fill my head as I contemplate treason Now caught in a waltz with the eternal dancer I’m courted by death, but death isn’t the answer  4.  How do you feel about other people:   Then, Maybe then   In this world of circumstance Children never fear forever And this moment that enchants Someday we may both remember  Then, maybe then If we are still alive Then, maybe then This moment will survive  There is time in every word There are words in every reason And these notes that are unheard Someday they may find their season  5.  How do you feel about yourself?:   The Dark   Feel the darkness smiling Every note is dying Silence is refining Every thought in my heart  Still the Fates are weaving Every note that’s bleeding As I sit here seething All alone in the dark Alone in the dark  Someone is whispering softly to me Shadows of things that no one can see They are there for you if you want them to be You want them to be  But in the night The darkness breathes If I will it to be  Before my eyes The music dies But you will always hear me  The only sound That I will hear Is here in my heart…  6.  Describe your girlfriend/boyfriend:   Time   Time, only time Could ever take me away from you And why, should it try Time never cares just what we do It just sits on a star and gazes down Dropping its moments all around And if I could wish upon that star I would find what you dream and then  Ask God to grant it  I wanted to say this Long before this dark would fall At night I would pray this And wonder if God heard at all For the chances I’ve had are now long gone And that star is no longer wished upon For on this night it seems to far away  7.  What would you rather be doing:   Empty-Handed   I’m packing my bags ‘Cause I don’t wanna be The only one who’s drowning In their misery And I’ll take that chance  ‘Cause I just wanna breathe And I won’t look back And wonder how it’s supposed to be  8.  Describe where you live:   Sarajevo   But as he neared the earth Of a recent battleground From among the ruins He once more heard the sound  It was a single cello playing A forgotten love song And even on that battlefield The song somehow belonged  And as he flew away The angel did take note That where he found the music played One could always find hope  As he flew over the countryside He was still listening When from a little church below He heard one voice begin to sing  9.  Describe how you love:   Mephistopheles Returns   Don’t need this path before me Don’t need forgotten glory Don’t need the threats of violence Don’t need eternal silence  Don’t need these midnight visions Don’t need to make decisions Don’t need to be uncertain Don’t need this final curtain  All these things are now before me Endless death or timeless glory On this night of ghosts returning To the light of bridges burning  10.  Share a few words of wisdom:   An Angel Returned   An angel returned That night through the sky But time it was short He had to decide  And so he flew Back over the land A gift for his Lord Was there in his hand  It was the glow of a light It was the heart of a song It was the tear of a child Where they never belonged It was a wish of a soul On an old neon light And the Lord smiled at him On that cold winter night  Hear as they ring through the night Kyrie among nations Kyrie among nations Hear as the bells ring through the night

      AHHHH!! The meet was so awesome! It was so cool! Hehehehehe!  So I get to school this morning, and go to the North end to give a nice good-morning to Kendra, Andy, Ryan, and Jenny and Hopper. Then I took my chicken breasts (LoL!) to Señorita Sharrer's room. She told me I was awesome because Matt didn't bring his chicken boobs. ;-)  Then I went back downstairs and said good-morning to everyone in the locker room when I put my track stuff down there. Then it was time to go to Theatre Arts. It was a thoroughly and completely uneventful class. We recited the memories that had been randomly passed back to us, nameless. I had Tiffany's memory, which was incredibly sad and depressing. I know my memory was happy, but the gothic chick who had mine wasn't there (as usual).  In Spanish I helped cook the Paella! Yay! It was so awesome!  WHOA! In math we had a really freaky substitute. She was like, permanently PMSing or something, 'cause she was really, really bizzotchy. Ha! She read my name and pronounced it so wrong! She goes, "Maaaah - Lair - eee?" and I totally wondered how she got that from Mall o ry. I dunno, she was seriously weird and psycho about the test we were taking too...whoa...  Biology was stupid.  HAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!! THE MEET ROCKED SO HARDCORE!!! IT WAS SO AWESOME! It was at Chesapeake, and it was us, Chesapeake, Arundel, and Northeast. Girls and boys got first place! And guess what? GUESS!!!  I GOT THIRD IN THE MILE!! THIRD PLACE!!! And I got SECOND in the half-mile!!! I WAS SO HAPPY!!! I have enough points to get my varsity letter, and it's only the second meet of the season. Whoa! Hahaha! I got a Personal Record on my mile, and I think the 800 got me a PR too. YAY!   SOY AMADA!!!!

      Ack. So much has happened in the past two days...maybe three days...when was the last time I posted?!? I'm not sure...the post options thing for blogger is messed up. ANYWAY...  On Monday...what happened! Goodness I've forgotten. It was an A-day, so yeah...I was asked to bring Chicken Boobs (Breasts, LoL) to Spanish class tomorrow so we could make Paella. In Theatre arts we played sharades! Whoa was that funny! I went up and got "Peter Pan" I was so confused because I had no idea how I would get my team to know it was Peter Pan. So when the time started I flung myself across the stage in a leaping way and waved my arms around. Spencer screams, "PETER PAN!!!" Yup. We got that one in thirteen seconds. Lol.  Math was stupid. Grr. At lunch I had to hold the box thingy for Theatre Arts. So when lunch was over I walked down towards the Theatre Arts classroom, and Paula walked by and I rolled my eyes. She said something, it might have been calling me a name for rolling my eyes at her, or something to that extent. I think it's funny how it almost seems like I annoy her. I might not be annoying her, but if I am it's really funny. So I come back from dropping the box off at Ms. Parker's room and I get to see Keniesha and Ryan and...well, I saw Courtney too, but she doesn't really like me much. Yay! I got to see my homies from D lunch.   Biology was boring, except I made babies. No, not like *that*. We got a partner and flipped coins for the different genotypes. I made babies with Jenny, since we had so many boys. SHE IS THE FATHER!!! Lol. We had a girl, and we named her after my sister (and the baby turned out to be really ugly so it turned out nicely), and a boy that we named Curious George. ;-)  Then at track on Monday I found out that I would be going to both meets, one on Wednesday and one on Saturday, which is the Invite. Tomorrow Coach is letting me run the mile and half-mile, since she's letting me get a variety before I am being forced to run the two-mile on Saturday.  ---  Today was funnnnnnny. I woke up at 6:20, and my dad yelled at me for sleeping in late. I got ready in a record time of fifteen minutes! Go me! Yay!   In Agriscience we made pretty-pretty flower arrangements and got to take them home. So I carried bunches of flowers all around school.   Other than that, not a lot happened today other than me and Amanda patching things up. Yay for that!! She suggested doing the talent show with me, and I'd play guitar and she'd sing. YAY!!!!

       I wanted you to know, That I love the way you laugh. I wanna hold you high and steal your pain away... I keep your photograph,  And I know it serves me well. I wanna hold you high and steal your pain --  Because I'm broken When I'm lonesome! And I don't feel right when you're gone, away...  The worst is over is now, And we can breathe again! I wanna hold you high and steal thy pain, away There's so much left to learn, And no one left to find. I wanna hold you high and steal your pain.  Because I'm broken, When I'm lost... And I don't feel right.  Am I strong enough? 'Cause I'm broken, When I'm lonesome... And I don't feel right -- When you're gone, away...   This weekend has seemed so long. I guess I should be glad, but I don't know anymore. I'm so bored. Not really bored, actually, more like aimless and unsure. I've been going through all these old documents on my computer, some of them are so old and some of them are rather embarrassing songs and stories from ages ago. I don't know. Old digital photographs, old tales of heroes and old virtues that no longer exist in the modern day. It's so funny sometimes, that I used to wish that people were like the characters in my stories and songs and poems. Oh well. Dreams are crushed sometimes, it just means you have to make new ones...   Feeling:  Happy and kind of surprised at all these old writings.  Drinking:  Water. Ha!   Eating:  Nada.  Wishing:  A certain movie song comes to mind...   And even though I know how very far apart we are, It helps to think we might be wishing on the same bright star. And when the night wind starts to sing a lonesome lullaby, It helps to think we might be sleeping underneath the same big sky!    Writing:  Re-writing that stupid Beethoven story.  Note to self: Multiple forms of the verb "to be" are your ENEMY! Gah!   Singing:  Old songs from my music directory. LoL!!

      For some reason, today I had the weirdest question pop into my brain. I wondered who would attend my funeral if I died today. It was so strange, but I was talking to the man who'd been to Iraq and I suddenly wondered, "Hey, if I died today, who would go to my funeral and miss me?" It's not just the man from the war...I was in the part of Little Women where Beth gets scarlet fever, and all her sisters realize how much everyone in the town loves Beth, even though they always just thought of her as their shy little sister.  I know it's such a strange thought...I just wonder sometimes. I like to think that I know the names and faces flashing through my head would go, but I can't ever say for anyone. I can't speak for everyone. I definitely know that some people think I'm a bitch, and I definitely know that at least a few people would never think of me as such. I like to think some people would miss me terribly, as I would miss them, and yet some people I know would turn their backs and not think twice.  It's so strange. *bangs aching head on desk* Maybe I'm just delerious. Maybe I just get memories from Grandpa's funeral last December, and seeing that he wasn't just loved by me or Dad or even his immediate family. Seeing everyone hurt for him, but everyone glad somehow that he was out of the pain caused by cancer. Isn't it strange that so many lives can be changed and rearranged by something so small? Something out of our hands causes people to have to readjust their comfort zone and their loved one's comfort zones.   "To die would be an awefully big adventure." - Peter Pan  Perhaps I should think of it that way. It seems so much more positive, hey? I'm not planning on dying any time soon, but who knows? Maybe I'll grow up and have to go to war, fighting for something I might not believe in, and lose and arm like Mark or lose my life. Maybe I'll grow up and have cancer, battling against something I can't see and parry the blows, dying slowly. Maybe I'll grow up and die at a ripe old age, with someone by my side loving me. Maybe I shouldn't care so long as I die loved.   All this stuff is wearing me out...G'night...

      Ouch.  Woke up this morning at 9. Dad didn't make me go to school this morning. I'm glad, because P.E. is incredibly boring and I was sick of working with hoes in Agriscience. ;-)  So at 10:20 we make the drive to Silver Spring. The roads there are terrible, I don't know why anyone would ever want to work there or live there or have to drive there unless absolute necessity called for it. It was terrible! But we eventually got to the Army Medical Center. Army...*rolls eyes* Give me Navy any day.  It was so sad. I saw men there, men who'd been to Iraq. Every time I feel sorry for myself, I promise that I'll think of them and how it could always be worse. Always. That poor man lost his forearm from the elbow down. I wanted to cry for them, because I felt so bad that they had to go over to a place so far from home and make such sacrifices.  Anyway...we keep going and get to the Dermatology clinic, since my surgery is technically dealing with the skin. A woman there, she was very old...apparently she'd just had a surgery and I got to push her wheelchair since we were called at the same time. She thanked me and gave me a mint from the pocket of her wheelchair.   Then my doctor looked at the pictures from before all the surgeries and right after, thanked me for bringing them in, told me how much better *it* looked, and it was time for surgery.  It hurt like hell. I hated myself for seeming like such a wuss, but it **hurt**. The first part, the tears just came subconsiously. The second time, I had to keep back the sobs. The third and final part, I gave up and let go of my dad's hand. It hurt really really bad. The doctor got ice though, and he talked to my dad for a while in another room and I got to look at his office. He had all these pictures of his five daughters and of his awards for medical schooling and stuff like that.  Then it was time to go home. It was all over. It's swollen, but the discoloration is gone immediately. Cavernous hemangioma leaves scars, and they don't go away without surgery like capillary hemangioma does. Oh, Lord, it's all so confusing.  I met the most amazing people today, though. I never want to go to war, but I'm so proud of them. Poor man...lost his arm...his right arm...He is only eight years older than I am.  I gave Amanda a note on Wednesday, but she still doesn't talk to me or mention me in her journal. Apparently she's really happy lately. Maybe it was all me not being around. Whatever. I'm glad she had a good day. I know mine stunk except for sleeping in and meeting Mark at the hospital.  ----  Currents: {x} current clothes: Red OM track team hoodie, OM Cross-country shorts, Nike socks, Adidas sandals. Yeah, I'm dressed down. Don't usually dress like this. {x} current mood: In pain, but cheerful all the same. {x} current taste: Water. {x} current hair: Half up in a messy bun, the rest down and curled. I was bored this morning. {x} current annoyance: My birthmark stings and is annoying the hell out of me. {x} current smell: Huh? {x} current thing you ought to be doing: Homework. {x} current desktop picture: Picture of a female knight, with a quote, "Anything men do, women must do twice as well." {x} current book: Re-reading "Little Women," which I last read two years ago after Christmas. {x} current refreshment: Water. {x} current worry: Hmm... {x} current crush: I've learned not to tell a soul.  ---  Oh, I can't wait till the next meet.  I do well when people doubt me. When someone says I can't do something, I want to do more, do better; I want to prove them wrong.  I won't back down from anybody.

      EEEEEEEE!!!!! I JUST got back from the first meet at Northeast! IT WAS SO AWESOME!!!!!!!!  Caitlyn ran the mile, and she got a PR by like, forty seconds. I was so proud of her! Kate got a PR too, it was really awesome. The girls for OM track are off to a great start!  I got a PR for my two-mile time! YAY!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I got sixth baby!!!! And I only got sixth by a little so I was really close to fifth. YAYYYYY! I was so happy! I ran the 800 too, but there were like fifty other girls running it, most of which were from SP.  Keniesha did really well on the hurdles and high jump. It was very awesome...  OVERALL: OM girls got SECOND place. Guys got FIRST place. WHOOOT!!!  ---  Whoa, sorry for all the caps. Was excited...  This morning I overslept till almost 6:30. It was baaaaad. Hahaha, but I was well-rested.   In theatre arts we spent (as a class) the first five minutes trying to figure out how to get the logo on my spandex shirt (during a race they disqualify you if you haev a logo). It was hilarious. We tried duck tape, masking tape, safety pins, and eventually decided to try wearing it inside-out.  Spanish was incredibly boring except we got to have a FIRE DRILL!! YES!  What's third period? Oh yeah. Math was boring too. Lunch was funnn though.  After C lunch I stayed for D lunch and got to see my homies, Keniesha and Ryan. I saw Courtney too but I don't think she likes me much. The nerves about the meet kicked in and I was like, shaking my water bottle like a psycho person while I waited for Keniesha with Ryan. He probably thought I had ADD or something.  Science was boring too. Mrs. Smith kept yelling at me. I have no idea why...  THEN THE MEET. See above. **smiles**  I don't have to go to school tomorrow! I have surgery tomorrow. Scarrrrrrryyyyy stuff man.   Sooooo tired....Lactic acid building up in thighs....dying....soooooo tired....exhaust....  ----   Wanna quit and give up; Simon says to pack it up. Shot down from all sides... Don't know why I try! So take this and kiss it... Goodbye won't miss it! Wanna go back to L.A.  I don't belong, that's what they say.  Back again, one more time. Couldn't keep me down las time! Leaving what I know on faith, To take on the world and make waves. Still standing defiant, May be me against the giant. But Rome wasn't built in a day: Game's going on, so I'll still play!

      Awwww I had two awesome days!  Okay, yesterday, Tuesday night:  INDOOR TRACK BANQUET! The food was really good. I sat with Jenn, Sarah, Shanika, Chantel, and Tim. Then they had the awards!!!! They started giving out the graduation numbers for the JV people, and I honestly thought I was getting one, because I remember that I thought I missed my letter by two points. But then, I was the ONLY FRESHMAN to get my letter. Yay me!   And that's not even the best part! I got a plaque for winning the award as "Best Freshman!" Sure, they spelled my name wrong, but Coach L. said she'd exchange it and get it spelled right.  On to today...  I worked with Hoes today in Agriscience! The boys were making really bad jokes about it. We were re-planting plants by the CATN sign. Mrs. Roos came over and said our flower bed looked like a mole had come through it! Grr... :-(  P.E. sucked, as usual.  In Government we had to research different towns to decide where we'd move in the future. It all seemed quite pointless to me, but whatever...  I saw Kendra today.   English sucked, as usual. It was even worse today because it became PAINFULLY obvious that we have a few seriously moronic people in the class. Goodness, some of them are just plain STUPID. I'm not even joking, or being mean on purpose or anything like that. It's just stupid. Silly.  Then, Amanda and I are still fighting. I don't understand how people can get so pissed off over seriously stupid things, ESPECIALLY when the person in the wrong apologizes. Honestly, I don't think there's much else I can do anymore to make it better. She's just so stubborn sometimes. I guess that's always why I related to her, but now it just stinks. I suppose if it doesn't work out in the end it's just another friendship come and gone, which seriously stinks.  I'm running as a scorer tomorrow in two events. I'm the only girl running the two-mile for OM, and I'm also scoring for the open 800.   I'm so exhausted!  "Now let's just remain this way till plans change by fate, not by us and our stupid misunderstandings," --Keniesha.

      Things are cooling off, but I still feel like crap. **works on finishing a Tapestry post**  I have to do ticket-selling duty tomorrow, but I like that lunch so maybe I switch to C lunch on B-days for selling tickets. The damned awkward silences today were terrifying. I should have just sat with Sarah and Courtney, but I wanted to at least try saying  something,   anything  to Amanda, but then the look on her face made me change my mind.   **a lot has been edited because I've calmed down**  Besides that, at track today I found out what I'll be running. The two-mile didn't surprise me, but the open 800!?!?! That was a shocker. They're getting all these sprinters to run the 4x8. Well, there ya go. Life sucks sometimes, but it's not gonna kill me (though I know some people wish it would).   Keniesha wouldn't look me in the face, wouldn't nod acknowledgement, wouldn't say a word. *shrug* I guess she's still mad at me too. Other than her and Amanda, none of my other friends are pissed off at me, I don't think. ;-)  All this crap all at once.  I wish I could say that something good happened today, but not really. Three days till meet, four to surgery. Mom is a million miles away and she hasn't called yet. My grandmother was put in the hospital for two nights...I dunno. The worst part about that is that my dad can't leave while my mom is gone.   **edited again because I've calmed down**  Again, this song is so strangely there...   I'm full of regret  For all the things that I have done and said  And I don't know  If it will ever be okay to show  My face 'round here  Sometimes I wonder if I disappear   Would you ever turn your head and look  See if I'm gone, 'Cause I fear  There is nothing left to say to you  That you wanna hear,  That you wanna know...  I think I should go  The things I've done are way to shameful...    Awwwwwwwwww...........ARGGGGGGGG..........*bangs head on wall* I AM SO STUPID!!!

       I've been the needle and the thread, Weaving figure eights and circles round your head. I try to laugh, but cry instead... Patiently wait to hear the words you've never said."   Mr. Mike told us all to read one chapter of any book of the Bible a day. I started with Psalms. My favorite is 144, but I'm not sure why. Mr. Mike started at Romans and said it was really hard to understand what was being talked about and why, unless he had all these other sources to cross-reference from. Tonight at Sunday School we drew our own "Passion of the Christ" for the Religion Fair next week. We drew our own depictions of the chapters of Matthew that tell about the death & resurrection of Jesus. My picture was about "Peter's Denial of Jesus". It was fun.   It's not always rainbows and butterflies, It's compromise -- it moves us along...   **works diligently on Tapestry and White Horse posts**

      Went for a change. Dunno why.  Mom left today, and dad went to take General back to the vet hospital again. Shelby is somewhere, and I'm here. Here.   I'm gonna miss mom so much.   In any case, I've had a crap weekend that I'm going to try and forget about, or at least try and make it better as I can. I'll bend over backwards to make things better but it requires people to understand that I do make mistakes and I am sorry for them. It seems I'm always making mistakes, but I'll promise anyone that I would never make the same mistake twice. I was ticked off at myself yesterday for being stupid, but now it seems a little stupid. I mean, I'll always be sorry, but what am I supposed to do if someone won't accept my apology?  Anyway, I'm starting to feel a little better because I know it can't get any worse than this. I have my first meet on Thursday. There's the whole surgery thing on Friday but I'm only worried about it if I have to go to school looking worse than I do every other day. :-)  I really, really don't want to go to school this week. I never really want to go to school anyway, but this week, I can already tell it will be a load of not-so-hot stuff...   I'm full of regret For all the things that I have done and said And I don't know If it will ever be okay to show My face 'round here Sometimes I wonder if I disappear  Would you ever turn your head and look See if I'm gone, 'Cause I fear There is nothing left to say to you That you wanna hear, That you wanna know... I think I should go The things I've done are way to shameful...   Mandy cheered me up today. She's good at that because she's always happy and she lives right down the street. Johnen walked over to my neighborhood randomly and said he was just stopping by. See, it's already getting better than yesterday morning...I just don't want to go to school tomorrow...

       Please don't read if you dislike violence and unhappiness. Minor language.    Feeling:  Like crap. I'm incredibly pissed off at Keniesha and I'm full of remorse for Amanda, but there's nothing I can do anymore and it's all blown up in my face and I feel like crap that's been stepped on.  Thinking:  I'm gonna kill Keniesha.   Drinking:  Water...  Eating:  Nothing...I'm starving...  Listening to:  REM - Everybody Hurts.  Okay, this is it. I can't handle Keniesha anymore. She's a bloody pain in the ass and she's made me feel like I'm useless and that everyone hates me. Maybe that's true but it's not cool. It's not cool. I needed to handle it so I canceled and made a mistake with one of the only people who was my friend. I shouldn't have, and I'm sorry, but this bullshit Keniesha is pulling is killing me and I want her out of my life.  Keniesha is freakin bipolar and maybe she doesn't realize that what she does hurts people. I know I might have this problem too, but I'd never ever ruin someone's life the way she's tearing mine apart. Yeah, this seems overdramatized, but she's messing with my life as if she can't control hers. It's like hers has gone down the tubes so she's taking care of mine.  I'm going to avoid Keniesha at all costs. Like Kendra said, if we just cut her off at the knees she'll just get worse, we need to ignore her entirely. This crap has gone on long enough and I can't handle it anymore. Keniesha, leave me the hell alone!  --- The cats went to the vet yesterday:  Sundae needs to lose a few pounds, Charlotte is too skinny, needs to gain a few pounds, And, just to add to the rest of the crap of the day... General Posy is as old as I am and he might have some form of cat cancer.  Why me?

      I just feel like crying.   And if I bleed, I'll bleed... Knowing you don't care. If I sleep just to dream of you But wake without you there, Isn't something missing? Isn't someone missing me?   I've had such a crummy day. First off, it felt like it was a Monday, which is always a horrid thing.   Well, actually, my day started pretty well, but it transformed into a not-so-hot day later on. I went to pick Mandy up since my mom offered to drive us to school. Her three-year old brother Tyler slid down the steps and screamed, "Mallowee, Mallowee is here! My girwlfriend come to say hi!" So I guess I have a three-year old boyfriend... :-) Yay~ He makes me feel loved. ;-)  Theatre arts was boring. Spanish was boring -- but I got a 46/50 (92%) on my Negative Tù commands quiz. Yay. Math stunk. Biology was quite interesting.  Then Keniesha ruined my day by blackmailing me just because she has a quick temper and wanted payback for something I didn't do. She's pissed cause she needs a psychiatrist and her record's ruined, but it's not my fault and all I try to do is be the mediator between my two friends, and it all freakin (excuse me, sorry) blows up in my face.  I wanted to smack Keniesha, but I couldn't because it wouldn't be right. Why am I the middle-woman here? Why? Why me? I don't mean to feel self-centered or sorry for myself, because I'm not. I just don't get it.   "A friendship's not a friendship if it's hard."  If it was hard to be friends with someone, you wouldn't be friends. If keeping a steady ground as friends was too hard to handle, two people just aren't friends. That's why (the first example that comes to mind) Paula and Hannah and people like that aren't friends with me, because it's too hard. I'm not a wuss, not a baby, but when you can't be friends you aren't friends. I'm even getting lost in my own reasonings.  But hey, on the bright side, I did 25 seconds faster on my timed mile today than last week, and 10 seconds faster than the first time I did the timed mile. I'm pretty happy, I guess. Yes, very happy. Caitlyn improved her time by 20 seconds, and has improved by three minutes since the first day of practice. Yay for Caitlyn! "I love my track Ohana!" --Caitlyn...  Five days until the meet, six until surgery. Still counting down.  At least I get out of Mr. Bright's class and Mrs. Parker's class...most of P.E. too, next Friday. I don't know how that next Monday will turn out though.    "And if you do not want to see me again...                                         I would understand.           Can you put the past away?"

      Ahhhhh. A lot happened today, I think.  At Agriscience we worked with Thyme and the nodes of already planted seedlings. We snipped the branches at the internodes and dunked them in powdered plant hormone, then planted them. Mrs. Roos gave us our own little plants to take home, called "Devil's Backbone". She told us to hide them though, or Mrs. Cornelius would take them away and do evil things to our permanent record. Roos also showed us a live Black Widow Spider. Most of the girls acted like such wussies and screamed, and I was a bit freaked out but it was in a bottle for goodness sakes! I got to see it's little red hourglass.  In P.E. not a lot happened really, I don't think. Tyrone was really really starting to get on my nerves because he kept calling me China and acting like we were Power Rangers, telling me to, "use [your] powers, China!" It's not that I don't like him because he's mentally challenged, it's because he never pays attention! But he's funny though, and I know to stay patient with him.  In government we took the first Unit Test for the Foreign Policy unit. It stunk! Errrg. It wasn't hard, but it was really stupid. I dunno...just not fun or anything. We had to write a lot of essays. Stuff about the President's role being affected by congress and stuff like that.   Hahahaha! In English we watched Romeo and Juliet the movie. The costumes were hilarious! It was completely weird and funny. The guys wore tights that were like the spandex and underarmor people wear to track, except that we wear the spandex with shorts and shirts overtop!   Track was funny. I had to run my five miles. However, the baseball people kept purposefully throwing their baseballs over the fence and into the stadium. One of them hit Jack. Then it was funyn because all the track guy sprinters were telling off the laughing baseball people, who immediately backed off. Then Spalding came over and I got mad because they stole our track. For people who pay so much just to get into and go to school, you'd think they'd have their own track!  Tomorrow Coach L will have the roster for what we're going to run on Thursday. I'm looking at the two-mile race and the 4x8 relay. Maybe the one-mile instead of the two mile, but most likely one of those two and the 4x8.  6 days until the meet, seven until the surgery. Yes, I'm counting down.  My mom said she might give me a ride to school tomorrow. Yay! I can say hi to all my friends in the morning! Usually I either have to go to CATN or my bus comes too late for me to see them before the bell rings. Grr....  Je suis fatigue (That's right, isn't it? I don't take french..)

      Ehhhhhhhhhh.   I just found out my surgery is scheduled for next Friday, the day after the first track meet. At least it's a Friday, so I don't have to go to school the next day or anything.   Caffeine is good.   I want my Sunflower to finish growing.  I have to write my Bellyn/Bella intro. I started it, but I still have a long way to go. I'm so tired....

No, I don't speak German and no, I don't remember what it means. Something about music and dance or somesuch.

      'Allo folks. Happy Saint Patrick's day to you all!  I made Irish Lace Cookies last night and brought a few to school today. Some people liked them, but Ryan laughed and said they tasted like cereal with the oats and brown sugar. LoL. It's true, though, I guess. Not my recipe though! The hardest part was getting the damn cookies off the cooking sheet when they were done in the oven. They're so thin and connected by bits of brown sugar/butter or whatever, and they crack and crumble if you're not careful.  Anyway, moving on.  In Theatre Arts we learned about makeup. Krystle did Lindsay's makeup to make her look like a rosie-cheeked three year old, and I did Jacob's makeup to make him look like a really old man. Lindsay turned out great, but Jacob looked more like he was dead than he did an eighty-year old man.  Ech. Spanish was kind of boring today. We had a timed write where we had to describe 'un monstruo' (monster) or 'una persona con muchas partes de el cuerpo' (a person with a lot of body parts). When we were done we paired up and we had to read our description to our partner, who, in turn, tried to draw the monster (All of this being conducted in Spanish, of course). Mine looked really scary. Five elbows, polka-dots, and arms that are longer than legs tend to do that.  Math was boring So was lunch. So was Biology.  Ugh. Track sucked. Track hurt so bad.  Now I'm tired. :-)   SEVEN DAYS UNTIL THE FIRST MEET OF THE OUTDOOR SEASON!!!! WHOOT!!!!    Feeling:  Happy, cheerful (as usual) but extremely and excruciatingly tired.  Eating:  Nothing, but I'm so hungry!!!  Drinking:  YO BEBANDO EL  AGUA !!!!!!!!! SI!  Mad At:  *grumbles* damn Maryland weather. Freaky weather...  Listening to:  My Uncle's newest CD, "Only a Fool".  Writing:  Meh. This and that...MUST GO TO LIBRARY!

      I can't really remember what went down yesterday at school, so I'll just talk about today. It was weird today...  Okay, first of all...It's mid-March, right? Right!?! Please tell me why it was snowing when I left for school, then pouring when I was at CATN? I hate this FREAKY Maryland weather. Actually, not just MD weather, but the WHOLE EAST COAST OF THE UNITED STATES doesn't seem to want spring.  In Agriscience we planted loads and loads and loads of pots full of sunflower seeds. I took one home with me in a mini-pot and it is supposed to grow in ten or so days. Funnnnnn. When it's done growing I'm gonna pick it! I'm gonna pick a flower that I grew! It will be extra special. My own special flower. Awwwww....  P.E. stunk. I love sports, but this Team Sports elective is just the pits. I don't know anyone in the class really, 'cause most of the ninth-graders and tenth-graders that I know are taking Fitness for Life and most of the upper-classmen that I know are taking Aerobics or some such elective. I played volleyball again. Grrrr. I hate Volleyball. Give me a damn soccer ball and I'd be happy enough.  In Government Mr.Bright singled me out. He said that I went above and beyond on a certain activity and that I was ahead of the rest of the class, saying he'd always recommend me for any AP Social Studies class. It sucked because it was in front of the whole class. I know I'm glad I'm getting compliments from someone as weird and senile and cold-hearted teacher there is, but in front of the class? They all thought I was a teacher's pet. It sucked. Oh well. He said he was definitely going to talk to the office and ask for me to have AP European History next year instead of Honors World Civ.  Jake: "Wait, Mallory...European History means everywhere but the U.S., right?"  ::rolls eyes::  English was plain boring. We had a test on Act 1 of Romeo and Juliet. It was really easy. I like Tybalt the best. Romeo is so superficial. :-) Mostly I like Tybalt because he's the one I read for, and Tybalt wants to kill Romeo who is played by none other than JOSH. Hahahaha!  Track was indoors. It stunk too.  BUT TOMORROW IS ST. PATRICK'S DAY! I'm making cookies. I'm part Irish so I'll make Irish Lace Cookies. I refuse to wear green though other than maybe a green hairtie. Mostly because I do not own green clothing.  Happy Saint Pattie's day everyone. Tomorrow.

       Wish you would step back from that ledge, my friend You could cut ties with all the lies you've been living in And if you do not want to see me again I would understand I would understand   Monday morning. ::rolls eyes::   In theatre arts our warm-up was a trust one where someone is picked up by seven or so people and them spun around at waist level. Everyone was like, "Oh, I'm too fat," or "I weigh to much!" Which was really stupid because two of the girls were sticks and the other three weren't fat or anything. Maybe bigger than me, but not fat or anything. I was just like, "This is stupid, let's just go!" and then after they were done they were all happy and thought it was really cool. It was cool. I felt light as a feather.  In Spanish I have a 99.5, which really surprised me since last semester with Mrs. Beall I barely had a 90. An A is good in the first place, but I've got basically a 100. I guess Ms. Sharrer is just way more fun and child-like at heart.  Math has turned into gibberish with its polynomials. Looks like a baby smashed his hands on a keyboard and they printed it onto a math worksheet. Somehow I've been getting by with a 90 on the last test and worksheets and whatnot. I despise math, but I'm not bad at it or anything.   Hahaha! In Biology we studied the reproductive ways of our own chosen animal. Jenny chose a Jackrabbit, and she learned that their gestation period (length of pregnancy) is only 41-47 days. Sarah is researching Sea Otters and she learned that they mate and have their babies in the water. I'm researching mongeese and all I learned was that Rikki Tikki Tavi from Rudyard Kipling was a mongoose and that they are banned from Canada and the U.S. Yes, I have my priorities straight, don't I? :-)  Ran four miles for my work out today, and a mile for warm up and a mile for cool down. Six miles isn't too bad, but not as much as I usually do. It was all at a 6:30 pace. I was tired as anything when I was done though.

      Not a bad day. Nope, not bad at all.  I want to go to the Library soon, but I keep forgetting the times since I lost my library card a long time ago. So I haven't been yet...I need to do something Spring-ish, and I guess going to the Library makes me feel like it's almost Summer again. I always use to go to the Library during the Summer because I had nothing else to do and it had really awesome air conditioning. I'm such a dork... ;-) I've been really happy and hyper lately. It feels like Spring is near, even if it's still crazy weather on the outside.   I went to church this morning and saw Chris, Mrs. Betty, and Mike. Lindsay sang the whole time, it was cool. She's hilarious, Lindsay is...she's in my Theatre Arts class. She's such a goof ball...  Anyway, I'd imagine that the only cause for upset feelings lately has been the malfunctioning of my electric tuner. Grrr. So now I've resorted to using my old piano to tune my guitars. I've been playing one song lately that requires Drop-D tuning, but my acoustic was successfully set to standard tuning this morning.  At sparring class on Wednesday, Joey is going down. Sure, he might be fifty pounds heavier than I am, a year older than I am, and three inches taller than I am, but I'm so set on kicking him to the ground next round of sparring. Mrs. Betty says it's horrible to be fighting like in TKD, but it's not like we're learning how to kill people or anything. It's fun exercise.   Speaking of exercise, I'm counting down the days until the first triple meet! Eeeee! The twenty-fifth...only eleven more days! Eeeeeeeeee! Running makes me so happy. I'm definitely running the 4 by 8, and either the mile or the two-mile. Probably the two-mile.   Feeling:  Happy, hyper, cheerful.  Listening to:  Everclear's version of "Breakfast at Tiffany's," Third Eye Blind "Jumper," Disney Classic's "Ugly Bug Ball" and "The Spectrum Song," and I've been playing and teaching myself Evanescence's song "Whisper".  Eating:  This and that. Nothing in particular.  Drinking:  Water. It's good for you.  Procrastinating:  Homework!

      Kyrie elison, Christe elison, Kyrie elison...  I saw Secret Window yesterday. It was okay. It's one of the only movies I've seen where the bad guy wins or at least the good guy doesn't win. Besides "The Empire Strikes Back," which ends with Han Solo getting dipped in chocolate and Luke getting his hand chopped off. Other than that...yeah...it was pretty good. Johnny Depp is hot with messy dyed hair and even without eye makeup.  I was going to go on a field trip with my Sunday School class to the John Paul II Cultural Center, but not enough people wanted to go. It was a bit short-notice, but I thought it might have been fun...maybe...  Not much else is going on, really...

      Soy viviente vida solo.  It snowed today. In less than a week we've had eighty-degree weather, rain, shine, wind, and snow. It's crazy spring weather, and it's making me more crazy by the day. I can't stand this weather.  In Agriscience at CATN we made corsages. It was kind of fun. Then we left the greenhouse and it was snowing. Amber and I were the last people on the OM bus.  In P.E. we started volleyball. It was incredibly boring.  Govt. and English were boring too.   Track is killing me almost. I ran four miles today in under seven and a half minutes each, though my first mile was a lot faster than seven minutes. There was also warm-up and cool-down too.  I have Tae Kwon Do now! Yay! It's Wednesday class so I'm happy.

      I swear I just saw the scariest TV commercial in the history of modern television. I honestly have never seen something so horrifying.  THE QUIZNOS COMMERCIAL!  That commercial is so messed up! It makes me want to hide under my bed and never come out. Those gerbils need an orthodontist, and must NEVER EVER SING AGAIN! It is such a freaky commercial. It's honestly the scariest thing I've ever seen in my life.   But at the same time, it's also the funniest thing I've ever seen in my life. :-)  We went to our second CATN rotation, and now I have Agriscience. It looks incredibly stupid, and I hate bugs so I don't know what I'll do. But the greenhouse is really really warm so it's not terrible or anything.   Other than that...not much...

      I went bike riding with Shelb today. Meh...  Then I came home to make a scrapbook page and I found all these old photos of where we've been and where we've lived. I saw the photos of Alex and me in Scotland at the Guy Fawkes Bonfire parade thingy...photos of Puerto Rico after Hurrican Hugo...photos of Iceland and Germany and when my dad went to Luxembourg (sp?) to see where his family was from...stuff like that. It was really cool. Kind of mind-boggling since America is so boring and wrapped up in itself and I just don't like it here.  " I've been all over the world, I've seen a million different places... Right through the crowds and all the faces... I'm still out there looking for you. "  I still have Sunday School tonight, too...

      Yay! Weekend. It's almost over though...grrr....  On Saturday I woke up at eight so we could catch the 10:20 showing of Hidalgo. It got bad reviews but I really wanted to see it. I invited Amanda but she wasn't around when I called on Friday and it was too short notice for her to come when I called on Sunday. I felt bad for waking her up. Sorry Amanda. :-) In any case, it was a really good movie. It did seem a bit cliche with him being the son of an Indian chief's daughter and a white calvary man. However, Viggo did a wonderful job acting the part, and I'm glad he was able to sucessfully drop the Aragorn in him and pick up the Hawkins in him. I love Hidalgo! Makes me miss Midnight for some reason, and makes me want to be around GenGen, Sundae, and Charlotte more...Poor Horsie...  Then I came home and played Cups with Keyan, Jorge, Maribel, and Shelby. It was hilarious. I totally lost, I had CUPSSSSSSS because I lost so many times and they still let me play even though I should have been 'out'. It was funny.  After that I went running at the Airport Park, three miles. I got just over 24 minutes, which isn't very good but isn't incredibly slow either. Somewhere in the middle. It makes me feel better to know that I run better than most of the people in my gym class and at least a portion of my High School. I keep telling my self that...I'm starting to think I should run the mile event instead of a two-mile. I got a damn good time at that last Armory Meet for my split mile. But I'm probably also on the 4 by 8 team.  So then I came home and went to bed.  Went to church this morning and now I'm going to Kohl's to buy a new pair of running shoes. Why we're going to Kohl's eludes me, but maybe they're having a sale or something and my mom wants to make the most of it. Something like that. Dunno.  Ewwww...school tomorrow. And it's a B-Day too, so it will really really stink. Having Monday be a B-day is one of the worst things...Well, at least it means no more carpentry. Besides that, it also means that the Team Locker room will be open finally and I can grab a locker for Jenn and Kendra and me.

      Had a good day today. Yay!  Actually it was very uneventful. In Theatre Arts we had a substitute and had to do bookwork with lots of questions at the end of the readings. Really stupid questions, the kind that have the answer in the question. "How could you change the voice to make the transation from narrative to dialogue?" Uhh...change the tone of voice...right? It was just really stupid is all.  Spanish was so much fun! We started singing since we were learning the tú form for commands. We sang the original verb then the tú conjugation, and if we sang loud enough we got extra points. We sang so loud, this boy from another Spanish class came in laughing, "Viva la revolucíon!" (Rough translation: Long live the revolution!) It was hilarious.  Algebra was boring, but I got an A on my test so it wasn't bad or anything. Just boring.  Biology was so much fun! We're starting to review stuff from 6th and 7th grade like asexual reproduction and stuff like that, but that's not the point, really. It was just fun. We talked about so many random things it was just fun for once. Like, somehow we got on the subject of what was for lunch...randomness...   Richard : Yeah, they had no casedillas today at lunch!  Jenny : I know I was so mad! They said they ran out...  Mrs. Smith : You guys know you can make your own casedillas at home, right?  Richard : Oh yeah, I do that. Just take white bread and cheese and put it in the microwave or on the stove.  Mrs. Smith : That's called grilled cheese, hun.  Then we actually got back on track, and then we got to where we were talking about fragmentation. It's a form of asexual reproduction where if you cut off part of the parent cell, it will just grow into a regular cell and the old one just grows back. When pieces of the parent cell break off to form a new organism...anyway...   Andrew : Like when lizards cut off their tails?  Matt : Yeah and they grow back!  Beth : That's not the same thing...  Mrs. Smith : Right, because when lizards lose their tails they just grow a new tail, it's not like the tails grow out into a new lizard and they share a tail.  Me : Oh, but that would be so cool!  It was just fun.  Track was exhausting. I ran the timed mile to set my pace per mile for next week and got 6:30. Not as good as I was during indoor, but it's been two weeks since I ran so it's okay. After that I had to run four continuous miles. It was okay, I was just tired and sore. I need to run three miles tomorrow and five on Sunday.  Tired...

      I didn't like the white. It was boring. Hah! Back to the red and...peach? No...off-white? Creamy?? Dunno. Back to the red and other colors. :-)  Today was tiring. Very.  In theatre arts we performed our pantomime skits. Our group didn't choose which idea we were doing until last class, and didn't even rehearse it until five minutes prior to performing. Somehow we pulled off being the second-best out of five. Not too bad for random Santa Claus stuff...I was pleasantly surprised. I sighed up to sell tickets at three lunches and two of the nights of the shows. That should equal up to my five hours of crew-work required for the class. Mrs. Parker isn't really the teacher...now that I think of it...she doesn't really teach, Mrs. Revel (sp?) does. And Mrs. Revel isn't even from our school! It's messed up.  Spanish was fun. It's always fun now. A lot more fun than when I had Mrs. Beall.   We had a test in Math, but I thought it was really kinda easy. I don't know if that should make me worried, but I flew through it and finished the extra credit paper before class ended with time to spare. It was easy work...wow...  Alex kept stealing my nachos. He kept playing tricks and stealing them on the sly. It was kind of funny almost. Then Pepe and I talked about why Kendra had been crying the other day...It was almost a relief to get it all off my shoulders, even though I didn't tell her everything...  Bio was boring except for our conversation about Power Rangers. I remember that show. I used to love it...  Track just kind of sucked. Dunno. My times were pretty good though.  I don't have to go to CATN or have P.E. tomorrow! I have an Orthodontist appointment at eight, so I'm skipping votech and I'll be too late to P.E. to get dressed. Awesome! Yay! I get my next set of invisalign. It will hurt...I know it will...like it did last time...ahh well...  Now I still have TKD. Grrr....He made us stay until nine last week! It ticked me off...and my dad too. It's getting really frustrating...  Wow my mom said she saw Mrs. Janet (Paula's mom) at curves today. LoL. Mom said she looked as young and pretty as she did when they first met almost twenty years ago. I haven't seen her in over a year, maybe two or three. She was always a nice lady. She was cool. Then again, most parents that aren't mine seem awesome to me. Like Kendra's mom, Keniesha's dad, both of Johnen's parents...etc.  Not much else...cept for some random stuff that happened after school but before practice...

      Arggggggh. Life stinks. I'm sure you all have figured this out already, but sometimes it's just not cool for it to pop out all at once on you screaming, "YES, I'M LIFE AND I'M HERE TO MAKE YOU MISERABLE!" Then laugh in your face. Yeah. That's how psycho not-happy I am today.  In Carpentry we were putting the white wire shelving on our walls. At one point during the lecture Mr. Bury says, "And if you do this right I promise you'd be able to sit on it!" So when we go to do our walls everyone else it putting thiers at four feet or so, and Alayna goes, "Why don't we put it low enough so we can try sitting on it?" We tried! Eeeeh! We finished and Alayna sat on it, and it held. Mr. Bury came over and smiles, telling everyone else to listen up. "This is the perfect example of how a shelf should be made. It's strong enough to--"  Right when he says this, Alayna falls as the shelf bends. It was rather funny because everyone was paying attention and just as Mr. Bury is saying how great ours was it topples -- after staying strong for five whole minutes. Alayna and I were laughing so hard.  P.E. was the usual.  Government was the usual.  English was the usual. (I learned that if you murder someone after planning it you get a longer jail sentence than if you'd just randomly murdered someone. Wow.)  First day of outdoor! Eeeeh!   Actually a lot more happened to day, involving Team Sports lockers that I don't want to go into, but let me just say that it caused my backpack to gain five pounds throughout the day.  Now I'm very tired, and this one girl I know has been hurting herself and my friend and I don't know what to do. The girl broke a promise to my friend by hurting herself, and things just aren't going so well.   Tae Kwon Do now, then a free day tomorrow. Except for practice at 9:30. Election day! How wonderful! +shrugs+ I could care less, honeslty. All I have to worry about is the 2008 election, since I'll be old enough to vote by a mere four months. Maybe five...what's June to November? I guess five. Oh, but I can't vote in 2008 primaries...won't be old enough...  So tired...must...have...day...off...from...school...

       "...It was really too bad that they'd tied him up.  He couldn't even die in a valiant attempt at escape. Of course, he could always lie on the floor in a threatening manner. Or maybe, if he really made an effort, he could twitch aggressively..."   Gargh. I have D lunch tomorrow because of the stupid run/walk-athon. Stupid. It's for a good cause, yes, but I just don't want to do it. I will, but I don't want do. +sigh+

      Another meet. I shouldn't have gone today. It was for underclassmen OR for people who don't usually score. I'm an underclass(wo)man but I have enough varsity points for two people so I didn't really need to go. I guess I just wanted to go and get out of practice.   Ryan and Alex were at the meet...but they sat with the Cougars like little bizznitches (homez). Coach Nelson went...even though the Juniors and Seniors were acting like idiots on Friday.   So I ran the mile...got a 6:22. Not a PR, but I've done worse. I ran the 800 too, and got a 2:54. Shanika got shoved and fell, which tripped a SP girl, which stopped their heat of the 800. Shanika was bleeding...lol...she did the 4x4 with me anyway. I'm not a sprinter...lol...but they didn't have enought people for the 4x4 cause everyone was ditching and stuff. So I ran. We got third place and I had a 1:16.  Looks like my report cards gonna have six As and two Bs. Good. Now my parents won't freak like they did when they saw my report card when I had Mrs. Mirabile.  Talent show is coming up soon. Amanda wants to sing while I play guitar. +shrug+  Hah! Chris was singing this seventies TV show theme song when I got home...I love Chris!    Secret Agent Man! Secret Agent Man! They've given you a number, And taken away your name.  Beware of pretty faces that you find... A pretty face can hide an evil mind! Be careful what you say, Or you'll give yourself away. Odds are you won't live to see tomorrow.    Still playing Another Brick in the Wall prt. 2 though. Yay.

      Hey ya'll. It's been a while, eh? Ummm...we had a meet today. I did some middle-distance relays and a sprint medly, and I did fine but I've fully come to terms that I am a one-mile, two-mile, and three-mile runner the best. Some of the guys on the back of the bus on the way home were being incredibly stupid and freestyling. Coach N asked them to stop and they mocked her and acted really obnoxious. I hope Coach N doesn't quit, because those cocky boys with senioritis are really getting on her nerves more than they are getting on anyone else's nerves.   FOURTH PERIOD ENGLISH ROCKED!!! I was Lady Capulet and Juliet in plays! YAY! AMANDA WAS THE BEST JULIET EVER!!! LOL.  Now, a rocking survey from Catie's journal:  If I were a month I would be: August.

If I were a kind of weather, I would be: A warm spring shower where the sun is still shining, or an overcast, cloudy day but with warm air.

If I were a sound, I would be: The sound of the gun that signals the beginning of a track or cross-country race. If I were an element, I would be: Fire. If I were a car, I would be: I don't know what company makes them, but I'd be a Shelby (I think it's an old car) because it has my sister's name.

      Happy Easter everyone!  I loved Mass today -- I saw all these people from High School that I know! Yay!! Rachel was singing, as was Lindsay, and that dude who sits in front of me in Spanish that always gets in the newspaper for baseball was there...it was awesome. There was a funny Homily because Father Nick asked all the children to go up and help him explain how easter eggs came about to help symbolize new life, etc. It was hilarious because the kids say the funniest things up there...  In any case, despite the happy, springy feel of today I couldn't help but keep worrying about Amanda. She won't tell me anything, and I know she's hurting herself or doing something, but she won't talke to me about any of it. I know some things are better left alone, and not everything is my business, but honestly if it's something as serious as this to the point where I never know if I'll see Amanda the next school day, then I think something must be done. I don't want to lose another friend, especially if that friend is Amanda. I would never forgive myself if Amanda died.  I just don't know what to do...   In this world of circumstance Children never fear forever And this moment that enchants Someday we will both remember  Then, maybe then If we are still alive Then, maybe then This moment will survive...  There is time in every word There are words in every reason And these notes that are unheard One day they may find their season  Then, maybe then If we are still alive Then, maybe then This monent will survive... Will survive...                urlLink adopt your own virtual pet!       Teehee...

      I am so bored.    1. Grab the book nearest to you, turn to page 18, find line 4. Write down what it says:   "The Lord." (The Bible was right there on my desk. Pg 18 was Genesis 18, and line four was the end of 22...and it was two words long...LoL)   2. Stretch your left arm out as far as you can. What do you touch first?   My little trash-can set atop my actual computer on the floor.   3. What is the last thing you watched on TV?    That's So Raven, since I was coloring Easter Eggs while my sister was watching it.   4. WITHOUT LOOKING, guess what time it is:    Close to twelve o'clock, I'd imagine...   5. Now look at the clock, what is the actual time?   11:23 PM   6. With the exception of the computer, what can you hear?    Pink Floyd -- Another Brick in the Wall prt 2   7. When did you last step outside? what were you doing?

Blue Old Mill shorts and a long-sleeved T-shirt from the Maryland Cross-Country State Championships.   10. Did you dream last night?   Yuppers.   11. When did you last laugh?   A few minutes ago.   12: What is on the walls of the room you are in?   One guitar is hanging up in its hanger -- the acoustic, since I always play the electric and it's in the floor hanger...hmmm, not much else...my parents (mom!!) don't like it when I tack stuff on the walls.   13. Seen anything weird lately?   MY SISTER!!! AAAAHhHHHHH!!   14. What do you think of this quiz?   *yawn* I'm tired.   15. What is the last film you saw?   I can't remember!!! Argh!!!   16.

Tell me something about you that I don't know:   I HAVE BROWN HAIR!!! Eeeeeee! LoL.   18. If you could change one thing about the world, regardless of guilt or politics, what would you do?   War sucks. It needs to be locked up in a box and thrown into outer space.   19. Do you like to dance?   Yes, but it scares my friends so I don't do it a lot.   20.

No...sorry, not Bob...I'd have to consult with my husband.   21b. Imagine your first child is a boy, what do you call him?   BOB!!!! No...sorry, not Bob...And instead of consulting with my husband, I'll call him CURIOUS GEORGE!!   22. Would you ever consider living abroad?   YES!!!  ---  G'night. Easter is tomorrow. YAY!!!

       "...I've been all over the world, I've seen a million different places. Right through the crowds and all the faces, I'm still out there looking for you..."   Where has my spring weekend run off to? It's Saturday, and I only get Monday off now so it seems to be passing me by without me doing anything particularly special. Grandma sent a card with five dollars in it for Easter, and said she misses me and loves the long letters I send her every few weeks. Well, I love her and I think she must be terribly lonely up north without Grandpa now, with only the freezing cold wind and Sugar Loaf mountain to keep her company. Still, Lord knows I needed those five dollars since I spent the last of my own money for the last payment for the Canada trip. HA! I'm poor.  Mom's painting the hallways again. Man, my house is like a madhouse! We have builders adding to the kitchen and upper level, my mom is painting the hall, Shelby is cleaning out the shed, and it just seems a lot more like spring building than spring cleaning.   Thursday night I talked online with Ryan and Keniesha until I couldn't keep my eyes open. On Friday I didn't really do much. I used two pieces of wood and hammered them together to make a cross (or the letter 't' whichever you prefer). Then I painted it blue and shoved it into the garden dirt just in time for noontime of Good Friday to roll around.   Today I haven't done anything.   I can't wait for Easter. I don't know why...I guess it's just like it's officially spring or something. And I'm sick of the rain already, since it always seems to rain whenever we have a meet (grr....) but I love spring and fall, so I can't wait...  Besides, Easter and Christmas are the only Holidays I wear skirts for (Besides the sports banquets) and dress up for.

      Hmm. I don't really remember Tuesday or Wednesday.   This morning I woke up late since I had an orthodontist appointment. I got to school in the middle of second period, just in time to play a fun game in Spanish, called Subjunctive Relays or something like that. It was loads of fun.  Math was incredibly boring...but I have a B in the class, and that's not bad. This math class is so much better grade-wise than last semester, but I miss all my first semester buddies. I didn't like Mrs. Mirabile, but I loved all the psycho people in that class!  Biology was stupid. Just plain stupid. STOOOOOPID (yes, I know I spelled it with *counts*five O's).   The invite for track...IT WAS RAINING AND COLD!!!!! ARGHHHH!!!  I ran my two-mile, and it was the second to last race. I got a personal record, and got third place. Yay...*eye roll* I have 14 varsity points. Yay.  I'm really worried about Amanda. She's so depressed and I'm afraid of what she's doing to herself but she won't tell me anything. She won't talk to me about  *it* , and I'm starting to get scared. I don't know what to do. I'm scared...  So exhausted...   "...And nothing else matters..."  --Metallica

      Whoa...what a  PSYCHO  day.  Mom is back from GERMANY, and she woke up at 4AM to make waffles. *sighs* Same old mom, yup yup. I was so exhausted from staying up so late on Friday night, having a meet on Saturday, and doing English projects on Sunday all day. So I was extremely tired. Extremely tired. People probably thought I was high or something, and I know Mr. Bright asked what I had had for a drink during lunch...NO!!! I am not a bad person...I WAS JUST TIRED!!!  So I get to CATN, and we change our class. I got my twelfth choice - Drafting/CAD. ARGH!!! If I don't get Baking/Pastry next rotation, I'm gonna be so mad...I'm definitely not going back to CATN next year.   P.E. made me even more tired. I got locked out, but Nancy let me back inside. Then Courtney Smith shoved Matt out the door and locked  him  out, and when she shoved him he smacked his elbow against the silver metal push bar that opens the door. His elbow was all bruised...LoL...I felt so bad for him...  Government was INCREDIBLY BORING. BAHHHH! We didn't have to take a test...(Happy Passover, everyone!)...Man, do you want to know how bored I was?!? Matt and I were so bored we planned our weddings, our future families, my future husband and his future wife...It was so scary when he told me who his wife would be...but then I laughed so hard! He is so funny...LoL.  Lunch was the usual. Gary sat with us, it was funny.  I went back upstairs after lunch and saw Keniesha and Andrea. Then I saw Kendra and Ryan. I was so tired by that point, I was on the verge of collapsing, I bet. I was so tired. Kendra and Ryan think I'm psycho. Wait...okay, Kendra knows I'm psycho. Nevermind. *yawns*  English was ESTUPIDO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!   I got home and cleaned house. Go me.   I want a hug...*sighs and collapses*

       "I'm so tired Of being here..."   The Seahawk Invitational was really cruddy. I hated it. My race was third from the last, so I had to wait three or four hours in the pouring rain and twenty-degree weather, with the only thing I could do being to cheer on my other teammates. Things looked up though, and it stopped raining (or at least it stopped  pouring ) in time for my race, and I got a personal record by 12 seconds and got a ribbon for 6th place. It was terrible, and still not too bad...ironic, eh?  I made cupcakes last night.  I sold tickets to Wizard of Oz today.  I got in a big fight with my dad.  Now Mom's coming home from Germany and I'm exhausted and in a crappy mood. I want a hug...:-( Not to mention I still have three English projects to finish by tomorrow.  Man, life sucks sometimes...

      Hmmmm today was....RAINY. It was so nasty outside. It was terrible! I had my hair down since we were having team pictures this afternoon, but I gave up. My hair was starting to curl in the humidity and downpour.   Angriscience was really boring.  In Team Sports I played HORSE with Matt, Scuzzy, Teddy, Courtney, and Sarah.  In Government I had a funny debate with other classmates about conservatives and liberals and the homework we had. Hahahaha. *rollseyes*  I ate lunch with Amanda and Keesha.  After lunch, I saw Kendra and Pepe and Ryan. I told Kendra about second place and I was happy again. Man, I know this sounds really boring, doesn't it? I need something exciting to happen, but I know if I ask for something to happen it won't be good...  English was incredibly boring. The class is full of MORONS. I think it's everyone but me and Amanda and Amber...  Team Pictures took FOREVER. Now I have to go to Tae Kwon Do and I'm exhausted. Grrrrrr!!!!   Watching buttercups cup the light                        Sleeping on a dandelion Too much, I wouldn't touch you                        But then I might...  --Pink Floyd ------   Later...    AHHHH!!! The class was full of dudes! Usually Cathrine goes...or Krista...I was the only girl and I was the youngest and I was the SHORTEST!!!!! AHHH!!! This one boy kept farting...ewwwww....  Now I'm very tired, but I can't sleep. It's so psycho and strange...whoa...:-)

      Yes, my friends. In nine days I will reach the mature age of fifteen. (Bloodstained Eleanor opens on my BIRTHDAY!! Whoot!)  *snickers*  I've only asked for a few presents of my parents. Probably because I really don't want much. A new CD player since mine is old and stopped working last week. A new pair of shoes just because mine are getting worn and the shoelaces have frayed and the laces won't lace. Other than that, everything is up to my family's discression.   This weekend Amanda and I are going to go see The Day After Tomorrow with my father (though not necessarily *with* him). My gore-scared Aunt is coming into town this Saturday from Minneapolis, and is going with her sister (mum) to see Shrek 2. I've already seen it, and I really want to see TDAT with Amanda. So, yeah...our plans are set.  The closer my birthday gets, the more I realize that I have no idea what I want to do with my life. I don't know if I'd ever be able to write professionally. Going into the Naval Academy is at least an eight-year commitment. Music is lovely, and I could do it for my whole life, but in a world where nobody says what they mean everything I like could be lost on the ears of today's objectional population. I don't want to be stuck in a job that I hate, no matter how much it pays and no matter how cliche that sounds. I want a job that I would not mind getting up for every single day of my life.   I am small and the world is big...  But I'm not afraid of anything.   The HSA's kind of suck. They're easy as any test could be, but when you have to sit quietly without anything to do or read and not allowed to sleep for three hours, it gets to you after four days of it.  Track went well. I had enough points to get three or four letters, which is all well and good since I worked my ass off for it.  I feel fine.  In any case, I will get back to this when I am less confused.

      I redid the whole thing again from Maroon5 lyrics to Sarah McLachlan lyrics from her song Fallen…most specifically from the second verse. I still love Maroon5, but this song has been on ‘repeat’ and stuck in my head for a good deal of time now…   "We all begin with good intent, When love was raw and young. We believed that we could change ourselves; The past could be undone. But we carry on our backs a burden Time always reveals -- In the lonely light of morning, In the wound that would not heal, Is the bitter taste of losing everything I’ve held so dear..."   In any case...Happy birthday to Katy and Bryan.

      Wow...Amanda was really down today...On GJ she wrote this:  "I wish this never happened. I wish I was never born. I wish I was someone else, somewhere else. I wish I was a different person, one with no friends...so no one would care so much about me. I wish I was in the Twin Towers when they collapsed I wish I was nicer, prettier, more confident. I wish I had talent. I wish I would die an' come back as someone else. I just wish everything was different, that no one cared, that I was alone, no family, that I didn't have feelings I wish I was dead...or that I'm not afriad to kill myself. But if I had a gun right now......I'm sorry Katy......sorry mom an' dad....sorry to everyone. I guess I have to revise my suicide letter now. But I swear, if I had a gun right now or some pills...damn, that'd be one sad story. A lotta sorrys. Just to say it now...I never meant to hurt anyone...I didn't do it on purpose an' I'm sorry...this is to anyone I've hurt in the past, an' now."  And I was like...WhOA!!!! So I wrote this to cheer her up...  "I wish I was prettier, I wish I had a guy that made me feel beautiful and made me feel important, I wish that I used the brain I have to get great grades and I wish I didn't slack on schoolwork like I do, I wish I had all these things that I don't have. And then, Amanda, I think about the things I do have. I have friends (usually) who don't care if I'm pretty or if I'm the butt-ugliest female on the planet, I don't have a boyfriend right now but I realize that if I went for so long, I could wait ten more years for the RIGHT one to come along, and I realize that having a brain and using it as much as I please is better than not having a brain at all, and I realize that all the things I don't have make me more thankful for the things that I  DO  have."  TOMORROW IS OUR YARD SALE!!! WHOOT. LoL...  So exhausted...

      HAH! I edited the layout wording stuff. Maroon5 lyrics. Whoot.  Erg. Tomorrow is counties. GUESS WHAT!?!?!?! Take a wild guess what I'll be running!  Yeah, that's right...the two-mile...again.  *Sigh*  But hey, it's at Chesapeake and they have a rockin' track. Maybe it'll turn out for the better. Sí?  Not much is going on, really. Twenty-four days until my birthday, I think. Amanda had it on her journal that it was twenty-three days until Harry Potter comes out, so it must be twenty-four days until the big One-Five. Wow, fifteen. Ha!   When Thursday gets here it will be twenty-five WORK DAYS until school lets out on the 17th of June. That's good, because I'm just plain sick of school. It took me long enough to get sick of it, but I got there. Hey.   Then the HSA's are in two weeks. I get to go in late on that Monday since it's the Geometry HSA. Other than that, it's regular time all that week.   Next year sounds good already. Sophomore...YES!!! AP European History, moving on up, Honors English and Honors Chemistry...it's all good. Music Theory, Latin, Spanish III, and whatever else I signed up for. It's looking good already. Can't wait. I'm so sick of this year...Theatre Arts is fun, but it's a hell of a lot more work than even any of my core classes. Team Sports just plain sucks, but I'd rather have TS than Fitness for Life, and I never had to take Fitness for Life so I guess I feel kind of lucky. All my other classes are just going downhill now.  Katy's birthday is next Wednesday.   Let's see, what else? Working on more music, more gee-tar. Amanda's crushed, and I don't see why. I guess she had more to lose since I didn't really count as anything but accompanament. It's all good, and I'm not worried.    I once had something Something that was so good Better than the last thing I touched  Then I turned right around On that something Guess I figured I didn't like it that much...  Whoa yeah the grass is green But can you tell me  Can you feel it? I wanna feel it! Whoa yeah the grass is green But I think I stained my jeans and now Everybody knows that I've been in it...  I am a believer But as I was standing In line somebody took my place...  I am a believer No matter what they say  I got so tired along the way  Whoa yeah the grass is green But can you tell me can you feel it? I just wanna feel it! Oh yeah the grass is green, But I've stained my jeans  And now everybody knows that I've been in it!   And I've got a skeleton that deeper than any closet And I promise I will ride on it... You opened up to me, 'till I could only see the Beauty in your dishonesty, yeah!   Whoa yeah the grass is green But can you tell me can you feel it? I just wanna feel it! Oh yeah the grass is green, But I've stained my jeans  And now everybody knows that I've been in it!   *yawn* I'm so tired...  Someone told me today that my birthmark looked a lot better than it used to in sixth grade. When I told them that it should because of all my surgeries, they were surprised 'cause they didn't know I'd had so many surgeries (I've lost count). I guess that's good.  I'm hoping for another Thunder-Boomer so I won't have to go outside and play flag-football tomorrow in Team Sports.  -Mal

      The girls team kicked ass today. I got second place and eight points. McPhail was a lap ahead, but she's a great runner so I can't complain.   Ahhh Auditions on Friday. I'm not really worried, because it's just for fun and if we don't make it, I wouldn't be surprised. If we do make it, that's the only time I'd get nervous. But I honestly don't think we'll get that far. It's all good.   Ehhh! Shelb bought be the Punisher Soundtrack Album. Amy Lee and Seether...kick ass! There's some other hot stuff on there too. Nickelback and Trapt...Drowning Pool...awesominity.   I wanted you to know, That I love the way you laugh. I wanna hold you high and steal your pain Away...  I keep your photograph, And I know it serves me well. I wanna hold you high and steal your pain  'Cause I'm broken When I'm lonesome And I dont' feel right  When you're gone  Away...  The worst is over now, And we can breathe again. I wanna hold you high and steal your pain Away...  There's so much left to learn, And no one left to fight. I wanna hold you high and steal your pain...  'Cause I'm broken When I'm lonesome... And I don't feel like I am strong enough. 'Cause I'm broken When I'm lonesome. And I don't feel right When you've gone  Away...

So after Bio I'm leaving and walking down Patriot Lane to go to McDonalds or 711 to hang out w/ jenn and whoever else wants to go.  Talent show auditions are on Friday. 3:40. Ehhh no big. Amanda's nervous about it though, I think, and Caitlyn hasn't even finished her dance yet.

      Got this from Aman, though I’m certain I’ve tried (unsuccessfully) to fill this thing out numerous times. You’re supposed to use only song lyrics or song titles and accredit the artist. Let’s see how this works! It took me an INSANE amount of time to complete.   1. Are you male or female?:   “She carries on without a doubt, I wonder if she’s figured it out…”  – Evan and Jaron, Crazy for this Girl   2. Describe your neighbourhood:    “Never too far from the places that gather and the dreams that have been. In the safety of night, and its old neon light, it beckons to strangers that always come in. The snow it was falling, the neon was calling, the music was low, and the night, Christmas Eve. Here was the danger, that even with strangers, inside of this place, it’s easier to believe.”  – TSO, Old City    3. How do you look?:   “With auburn hair and tawny eyes, the kind of eyes that hypnotize me through…”  – Flock of Seagulls (or, more recently, Bowling for Soup), And I Ran.   4. If you could say something to the person you like, what would it be?:   “That nothings ever seems to be, when dreams collide with our reality. It should be easy when two people love each other to be free. Wouldn’t it be good if they could understand us, wouldn’t it be good if we could be together?”  Fefe Dobson, Take Me Away   “I am extraordinary, if you’d ever get to know me. I am extraordinary. I am just your ordinary average every day singing psycho.”  Liz Phair, Extraordinary   5. Where do you wish you were right now?:   (There are so many places I’d rather be right now!)  “You'll remember me when the west wind moves, upon the fields of barley. You forget the sun in his jealous sky, as we walk in fields of gold.”  – Sting, Fields of Gold.   “In the middle of a forest there’s a clearing by the stream…”  Trans-Siberian Orchestra, Prince of Peace.   6. What would you say to your best friend?:   “It’s always hard to believe in your own self, and easier to find belief for a friend. I’ll hope for you, you for me, and together we can say it’ll be okay.”  Superchick, It’ll Be Okay   “We’re not done yet, not going quietly into the night. Not me and my friends. We’re not done yet. Don’t take it too seriously. It’s just life, we’ll win in the end.”  – SC, Not Done Yet   “I wish you would step back from that ledge, my friend. You could cut ties with all the lies you’ve been living in. And if you do not want to see me again, I would understand.”  Third Eye Blind, Jumper.  (Just one more, I promise)   “Just when you thought you were falling. But you know, I’ll always be right there…”  – Michelle Branch, Always Be There   7. Any words of wisdom?:   “All of the moments that already passed, try to go back and make them last. All of the things we want each other to be, we never will be. We never will be that wonderful. That’s life.”  Nelly Furtado, Try   “And when you say ‘It doesn’t matter’ well it does. And all it takes is a mistake to eat your words. And when you look it’s gone, it’s too late to turn around. It’s another day facing yourself and the things that you’ve done.”  Michelle Branch, Second Chances.   8. What’s your view on life?:    “And I thought I’d live forever, but now I’m not so sure.”  Lisa Loeb, Stay.   "I live my life by the moon. If it's high play it low, if it's harvest go slow, and if it's full then go. But after midnight, morning will come."  - Nelly Furtado, Turn Off the Light.   “I’ve got it all, but I feel so deprived. I go up, I come down, and I’m emptier inside. Tell me what is this thing that I feel like I’m missing, and why can’t I let it go?…There’s gotta be more to life, than chasing down every temporary high to satisfy me. ‘Cause the more that I’m tripping up thinking there must be more to life…Well there’s life, but there’s gotta be more.”  – Stacie Orrico, More to Life.   9. Do you hear voices?:   “Don’t waste your time on me, you’re already the voice inside my head.”  –Blink 182, I Miss You.   10. If you could say something to your enemy, what would it be?:  I’ve got more than one enemy…GO ME! I balance it out with the many wonderful friends I have.   “You’ve called me strong, you’ve called me weak, but still your secrets I will keep. You took for granted all the times I never let you down.”  Three Doors Down, Kryptonite.   "Go ahead and hate your neighbor, go ahead and cheat your friend. Do it in the name of heaven, you can justify it in the end. But there won’t be any trumpets blowing come the judgment day. On the bloody morning after, one tin soldier rides away.”  – Joni Mitchell, One Tin Soldier.   “Bet you don’t think I can take it, but my mind and body are strong. Bet you don’t think I can make it, it won’t take long!”  – Joanna Pacitti, Watch Me Shine.   11. Do you have a role model?:   “Two days past eighteen, he was waiting for the bus in his army green.”  – Dixie Chicks, Traveling Soldier   “You could be a hero, heroes do what’s right. You can be a hero, you could save a life. You could be a hero, you could join the fight for what’s right.”  – SC, Hero.   “Each day she goes on is a day that she’s brave, fighting the lie that giving up is the way.”  SC, Hero.   12. Do you have angst issues?:   “Sometimes I have good days, and it’s great to be me. Sometimes I get the best of insecurity. And it’s quite all right to be the one and only, but some days I just feel like the one and lonely. Oh, the one and lonely.”  SC, One and Only.   “Makeup can’t hide how I feel inside. We all have bad hair days, those ‘nothing good about me’ days. We just keep moving on, ‘cause they’ll be gone, and we’ll still be here going on. We have our yesterdays, ‘no lunch ‘cause the jeans don’t fit’ days. We’ll still be going on.”  –SC, One and Only.   13. How has music had an effect over you?:   “It was the glow of a light. It was the heart of a song, it was the tear of a child who had never belonged. It was the wish of a soul on an old neon light, and the Lord smiled at him on that cold winter night. Hear the bells ring through the night. Hear as they ring through the night. Listen to the bells as they ring, listen to the message they bring. Listen to the sound as they sing as one voice in the night. Hoping that we’ll all understand every dream is there in our hand. And for every bell, let them ring on through the night!”  –TSO, An Angel Returned.   14. How do you feel right now?:   “And I thought that what I felt was simple, and I thought ‘Well I don’t belong.’ Now that I am leaving, oh I know that I did something wrong.”  Lisa Loeb, Stay.   “It really doesn’t matter if we don’t eat. And it doesn’t matter if we never sleep. No it really doesn’t matter, doesn’t really matter at all. Because we are so young now, we are so young, so young now. And when tomorrow comes we can just do it all again.”  –The Corrs, So Young.   15. How do you feel towards your parents?:   “Then I see you standing there, wanting more from me, and all I can do is try. Then I see you standing there, I’m all I’ll ever be, but all I can do is try.”  Nelly Furtado, Try.   16. What’s your favourite part about the opposite sex (or the sex to whom you are attracted)?:   “There’s something ‘bout the way you looked at me. Made me think for a moment that maybe we were meant to be. And it’s strange that things change but not my wanting you so desperately. Oh, I cannot  ignore it. I hate giving in but I should have known better.”  – Michelle Branch, Desperately.    17. Do you have low self esteem?:   “If you wanna be somebody else, if you’re tired of fighting battles with yourself, if you wanna be somebody else, change your mind.”  – Sister Hazel, Change Your Mind.   18. What’s your question to the world?:   “Are we wise to believe in things we never see? Are prayers just wishes in disguise, and are these wishes being granted me? For now I see the answering to every prayer I’ve prayed! Are we kind, more this day than any other day? Or is it only in our mind? And must it leave when you have gone away? It’s different now, it’s changed somehow, and now you’re here to stay.”  –TSO, This Christmas Day  -----  Ouch, my hands hurt now...  GOLLIDAY IS GOING TO ROCK SO HARDCORE!!! I'm running the two-mile. Marisa McPhail is, too, but I'm just gonna run my race and try my damned hardest to get up there, whether M.M. is there or not.

      There is no possible way I can describe to you the beauty and wonder of my trip to Québec. It was a once in a lifetime trip and I will never forget it. I saw beauty beyond compare, intrigue beyond reasoning, and I had the most enjoyable time I've ever had. I will miss the city of Québec and the Québecois, especially Maxime, our tour guide. I will miss all of it. In fact, the only bad part about my trip was crossing the border, knowing that I was back in America and knowing that I was back in a place where all I can hear is terrible news.  So, after spending a whole weekend without television and without interruption from terrible news breaks and whatnot, I have resolved to refrain from watching as much news channels as I used to and watch less television entirely. I am completely sick of the disease of fear spreading throughout America and I just want to bring back as much peace from Québec as I possibly can.   "I'll miss you... Miss you so bad. I can't forget you, Oh, it's so sad. I hope you can hear me: I'll remember it clearly. The day you drifted away, Was the day I found it won't be the same!"   I somehow learned that life is only what you make of it. Your president can control you country, and your news channels can bias you as far as fear and terror go, but the excitement you feel and the wonders you see only come when you want to see it and when you are willing to be captivated by the extremity of the world around you.  Does that make sense?

      This post is probably said out of immediate irrationality, so please do not take it seriously if it offends you terribly.  So, they killed that dude...Paul Johnson (sp?)...  It makes me sad, it really does, I mean, anyone who isn't sad about someone dying is weird...but...  How is his killing any different than all the people Americans are killing in the Middle East? Sure, we're over there to kill terrorists, but how many innocent Iraqis have been killed? THat's a tally number I haven't heard in a while. What other difference is there besides the fact that we just aren't killing terrorists one by one and putting their killings on the internet? Besides that, how are our killings any different than theirs?   I watched Joan of Arc today. After the battle for Orleans, she asks her captain (well, God), "Are those that died for England any less noble than those that fought for France?" Now, are those innocent (not necessarily terrorists) Iraqis dying any less human (not noble, per ce) than Americans dying? It is a war. Earlier in the scene between Joan and her captain the captain said that, "Even a holy war is still a war."   In a post I made today I said that after 9/11 I had begun thinking that maybe, just maybe, the world really  is  going down the toilet.  Well, kids...  The toilet has  flushed  and been  drained , taking your favorite  goldfish  George  along for the ride , getting  stuck  and  flooding the bathroom .   "Of all the things I've believed in, I just wanna get it over with. Tears form behind my eyes, But I do not cry. Counting the days that pass me by. And I've been searching deep down in my soul, Words that I'm hearing are starting to get old. Feels like I'm starting all over again, The last three years were just pretend."   Now I'm just plain tired.

      I've been doing laundry and packing all day, because I know I'll be busy tonight and tomorrow before I leave on Sunday. Besides, I don't want to be frazzled and rushed into forgetting something - that always seems to happen to me. So, I'm leaving Sunday and coming back the 29th of June. Just in time for report cards...whoop...  Anywho...I was looking through my files and looking through all the emails and home videos and such. I opened one file that was made shortly after 9/11 and probably sent to everyone in America for all I know. Seeing the footage and hearing the voices reminded me why I don't watch the news anymore. Eugh. Then the System of a Down video for "Boom" and whatnot...it makes me sick. It hasn't even been three years. Then I remember the movie Braveheart...wow, that movie is almost ten years old now...when William Wallace (Gibson) is talking to Robert LeBruce (sp?) and he says something like, everyone dies it's just a matter of how. And then he speaks to the Princess of Whales and says, oh, every man dies, but not every man truly lives... I love that movie. And sometimes I feel like the world is going straight down the toilet.   And then other times I really don't care. Because there is nothing I can do about it.  Besides, why should I worry? School is out, vacations are coming, and I'll be going to two of the safest places I could really be this summer. I'm going to a place full of guns and soldiers (Naval Academy) and to an entirely different country where people leave their doors unlocked and everything seems peaceful (Canada). Why should I worry?  In any case, Shelby has left with Leslie and our mommies...I have no idea where to, though.   Kendra will pick me up at 11 on Sunday morning, and we'll be ready to go. Dave will pick us up at the Academy on Thursday afternoon, and then on Friday afternoon we'll go back to school and meet all the former North School kids and go off to Canada. Then in August I'm going off to the Black Hills in South Dakota. It's going to be a great summer. Plus driving. That's always cool.  Wow...it's the eighteenth of June. Alex's birthday?? ...Happy birthday...I still have pictures of us when we were living in Scotland at the Guy Fawkes parades. But then tomorrow is Joseph's birthday, and then Chris' birthday is in July and Kendra's is the third of August! YAY! Birthdays!

      Ewwww I swallowed a bug while running 400s at track. That is why I am no sprinter. That is why I am the one and lonely 3200m chica.  THEATRE ARTS was so easy. We only had 35 multiple choice. I did my monologue, from "Good Night Desdemona" and it went pretty well. Don't mistake me, I would never want to be an actor, but I am pretty sure I got through that part with little or no scrapes. I only asked for "Line" once, and that was pretty good compared to some of the kids. Lindsay kicked ass though on hers. Spencer did well, too. I hated the essay...it was rather silly.  Spanish was a breeze.   Today I had the Algebra one, which wasn't too terribly hard. I didn't like it, though. It wasn't much fun.   The Biology exam was stupid. I finished so early and then we could only read or sleep, and I had no book so I snoozed and it was the most uncomfortable manner in which to sleep. I am surprised I slept at all.  Tomorrow I have no morning exam, and then for second period B-day exam I have Team Sports. Shouldn't be too hard.  SCHOOL IS ALMOST OVER!!! YESSSSS!

      It's been a while, huh?  The boys won states - the only Old Mill team to get that far and bring home a banner this year. They beat Suitland by ONE AND A HALF POINTS!! Guys, it all came down to the mile relay, the 4x4! We needed to get first and Suitland had to get third otherwise we would have lost by half a point. Just as Darnell came around the last turn, Eleanor Roosevelt came sprinting up between Darnell and the Suitland guy. We won by less than a tenth of a second.   Whoo. That was incredibly exciting.  So....then I was in the yearbook for Cross-Country. It was a half-page picture and it wasn't half bad. It was of me and Katharina at Blob's Park running past a Chesapeake girl. It was great...except that they called me Jessica Masters and they called Katharina Kathleen Kennedy. Grrr. Not a big deal, though. That's where I've been signing my friends' yearbooks, on that picture.  Then my birthday came!!!! YAY!!!! It was loads of fun.  On the 3rd of June I started going to the North County Summer Track program so I could stay in shape for next season of Cross Country. It's a lot of fun...  Thursday was my last regular B-Day, which made me very happy.  In Cosmetology we braided hair. I came out with a messed up french braided pig-tail on my mannekin (sp?).  P.E. killed me. We did absolutely nothing. Mr. Bliss' class went outside, and all my friends are in that class. Since I didn't know anyone in my class (even though I've been in the class for the whole semester) I just sat around lookin all lonely. I was rather good at looking lonely, too.  In government I got the recommendation and application for AP European History. yay! We took a test, which was easy.  At lunch I sat with Courtney because I needed to talk to her desperately about the Canada trip since I don't have her number and I won't see her until then. I didn't want to miss the trip so I ate lunch w/ her...even though I was sure Amanda would get mad and Keesha would be sad (awww keesha!).  And at NC track...I FINALLY SAW YURKES! If any of you know how thin Shelby is (my 60 pound twelve-year old sister), just imagine Shelby stretched out into a five-foot four inch six-teen year old! Robin Yurkes, the Broadneck, hell fire-fast sprinter is a twig! God, if I have felt fat around Shelby all my life...I felt like a monster compared to Robin. Her hips were jutting out from her waist! Like...it was disgusting almost, for her to be that thin. Just muscle (just a little...lol), skin, and tiny bones. Not a gram of fat on the chick.   Then on Friday it was my last regular A day of Freshman year.  In theatre arts we didn't do anything. It was stooopid.  In Spanish we made a five sentence speech. Mine was stooopid.  In math we went over a 500000 page review packet. It was stooopid.  In Biology we went over a shorter-than-math review packet. It was stoooopid.  I was invited to an attendance thing, but I didn't go. It would have been stoooopid.  My bus came about a half an hour late. Boy, was that stoooopid or what?  Now I'm just left with FOUR MORE DAYS OF FRESHMAN YEAR!  SUMMER IS HERE!!!!  Guys, I just wanted to tell you the days of my vacations so you didn't think I disappeared. If you wouldn't have noticed I was gone anyway (It happens...people forget me sometimes ;)), then ignore this message and go eat some watermelon!  Sunday, June 20th - Thursday, June 24th = At the Naval Academy for the Naval Cross-Country Distance Camp!  Friday June 25th - Monday, June 29th = In Canada (Quebec) with those weird kids that take French in school!  July 27th - August 2nd = I'll be in the Black Hills, South Dakota, with all my psycho cousins! AHHH MARK AND BRAD!!!  August 9th - August 13 = I'll be in Maryland, but helping out at the Summer Track/XC camp! YAY!!  Saturday, August 14th = YESSSSSS!!! CROSS COUNTRY STARTS THIS DAY AT NINE AM!  Then, sometime in early September (wow, late start, huh?), like the third, I think...it's that Thursday for sure = WE START SCHOOL!   SOPHOMORIC, BABY!!!   Now I'm about to go off and run with Stephanie and Kurth.

      I hate being torn between two things, things that I love equally but clash with each other constantly. What I hate even more is when I am being torn between more than two things, and more like five or six things that I love but I know I can't do all of them.   I can't do track and Tae Kwon Do and music and school at the same time.  Obviously, I can't  *not*  do school. But I love running...I love being a part of a team and being important and I love being able to relax and be alone running but being on a team and working for that at the same time. I love Tae Kwon Do and the familiarity and knowing everyone and feeling like I belong and that I am good at something. I can't give up music. Simple as that.  How can I choose? I can't and I hate it.   If I do it wrong, I will lose something precious to me. And I'm starting to realize that if I do anything or choose anything, I will lose something precious no matter what I do. Well ever wanted something so badly, so desperately that it's tearing you apart inside? You no longer think straight and just frankly want to give up and die?   I can't do this anymore.

      Jovana got arrested. Her mother called the cops on her and now she is in a detention center in Rochester.   Now I'm going off to track, run my cares away, come home and shower, watch the Olympic Track Trials from last night, and sleep. What a life I live.  Not much else going on, really. I have absolutely nothing going on for a while. I know it is really weird, but I can't wait for school. The feeling of needing to be somewhere and the feeling of being on a track team and the feeling of independance and being out of the house just makes me feel better. I could do without the work, but being busy and having things to do and being needed on a team...I miss those things. School is a great idea in theory, but the practical application of it is just silly.

      Why is it that whenever things are starting to look up and the sun is coming out, bad stuff starts happening again and it's like the world just wants to get you down?  Why is everything so   dysfunctional  ?

       You Know You’re A Track Runner When…  ·	When you wake up at five AM every Saturday morning, thinking that there is a track meet. ·	When you look both ways before crossing the track. ·	When you have a billion safety pins for the cross-country number labels. ·	When you get hurt and there is no such thing as rest – just ibuprofen and ice. ·	When you are the only sport that runs when you’re NOT in trouble with your coach. ·	When you have a tan line from your watch. ·	When you’re in a crowded hallway and you try to figure out how and when to make a move to pass the guy in front of you. ·	When you give distances…in meters…to your friends. ·	When you run away…and you literally  run away . ·	When you walk fast just so that someone behind you can’t catch you. ·	When your legs feel like jell-o and the only way to make them feel better is to run. ·	When you have figured out how to sleep comfortably even with a big track bag at your side. ·	When you know the name of every street within three miles of your school. ·	When you’re trying to figure out your splits for the two-mile while sitting in church. ·	When every Saturday of your High School career has gone down the drain. ·	When you threaten to hurt the soccer/football/field hockey/lacrosse teams because they have moved their stuff onto the track. ·	When you brag about your new running watch. ·	When you watch COPS just to critique the stride of those being chased, complaining and saying that, “They could have gotten away if they’d had a better stride!” ·	When .06 seconds is all the time in the world. ·	When getting drunk, to you, can only be by Gatorade. ·	When you start most of your sentences with, “And one time, at track camp…” ·	When it’s pouring outside and all the other sports have canceled their games, but you go down to the locker room anyway because you know that your meet is still on. ·	When the gun goes off and nothing else matters. ·	When the gun goes off and it scares the crap out of you…and that just makes you run harder. -- I'm suffering from boredom and school withdrawal. Not really school withdrawal...I miss my cross-country and track team. It's pathetic, really, I know.

      I ran the 5k race last night. I was top 15 for girls, and I got 23:38 for just over three miles. That's better than I did last year for Cross-Country. Must be all the running. So then I stay up until 2:30AM because I just couldn't get to sleep, and I came to regret it this morning when I woke up at six to go run five miles with Kendra.   Now I've just got to go to the 9AM mass for church, then I can come home and sleep through the hot hours of the day and go driving in the afternoon. I wonder where I am on the countdown for learners permit. You have to be 15 and 9 months...so I think I've got just under eight months left till I can officially get my learners permit. Driving isn't so bad, but I'd much rather run...but I don't think I could run to school...   Called your name today But no one answers anymore You turned and ran away Like someone came and locked the door  Paper pieces lyin' on the floor I fall to pieces now The coffee's black and  My heart is sore  Pick me up, tape me together Like paper pieces on the floor  Since you left that day I've realized my mind's made up on you My heart is capsized and  I dont know what I'm gonna do  Pick me up, tape me together Like paper pieces on the floor Pick me up, tape me together Like paper pieces on the floor Paper pieces on the floor and I call out to youu but you turn yes you turn away  I called your name today but no one answers anymore  Pick me up, tape me together Like paper pieces on the floor Pick me up, tape me together Like paper pieces on the floor Paper pieces on the floor

      I spent from 11 PM to 1 AM last night watching the Olympic Track and Field Trials. Bob Kennedy wimped out of the 10,000 (6-Mile). I watched the women's 5000semi as well, and that wasn't so bad. Between the 5k and the 10k, though, was all 100m and 200m crap. I slept through that. So then when I finally went to bed (after Kennedy left the race, consequently) I was tired as anything and slept until 11AM this morning when Kendra called me and woke me up from my nightmare about Canada.   I finished the AP Modern European History packet for next year today. I'm also going to the 5k race today at Annapolis High. The girl that always used to win the two-mile during Outdoor ran the 5k last week, and she won it with a really slow time of 26:07.7. That is slow. Reaaaal slow. Maybe it is just because it is summer.   I saw King Arthur with my dad and Corynne. It was pretty good...it was okay...the only reason I didn't really like it was because my two favorite characters died in the end, when they could have had two other guys that no one really liked die. Tristan died, the cool dude with the eagle, and Lancelot (Ioan, from Horatio!) died. Grrr.  Not much else going on. I got a capo. YAY! It cost me 17 dollars, though...

      I woke up this morning at 10:55 after spending the whole night editing and revising chapters 1-8. I had a terrible headache. I woke up, dragged myself out of bed and took my comforter up to the couch where I sat and layed all morning watching OnDemand movies. Gangs of New York and Chicago, and half of my own copy of Secret Window. I felt so sick. Then I went running with Tina again. Today was our easy day, so we only did four and a half miles. Tomorrow night my dad and I are going to go see "King Arthur". My rule is that only great movies start on days that aren't Friday. Lord of the Rings, Spiderman, Star Wars (this one wasn't so great...it was the exception), and hopefully King Arthur. I go to see Lancelot...played by Ioan something or other. He was in the A&E series a few years back as Horatio. YAY!

      Brian and Corynne played volleyball with me while the "adults" talked...Sean and Ryan didn't really do much but stay quiet and listen to their parents talk with all the other old people. Their loss! Then Mandy came over with her baby twin siblings, Tyler and Kelsey, who played with Corynne's younger brothers and sister. So, the teenagers (except Sean and Ryan, as mentioned earlier) played volleyball and had a jolly good time.  Now I'm going to go see Spiderman2 again with Corynne, because she really liked it and I was the only one who didn't mind seeing it again.  I've been using the new guitar program my dad got from Jett Robb to write down the music. It's realllllyyy cooool.

       Merry Christmas!     Which  urlLink Legendary Actress  are you?  I've updated again.  Where having a cookout today after I go out to drive.   I ran five miles this morning, even though today was going to by my "rest" day. I don't feel comfortable eating all day and not running. I don't know why. A bad habit from three seasons of constant running.  The Smiths (YAY CORYNNE! LoL) and the Pinkhams are coming over, and Brian is coming with the Pinkhams. We are going to barbeque since it's nicer out than it was yesterday. Set off sparklers...YAY!  Well, I don't much like my heading at all, really. I don't have time to change it since I can hear the Smiths already at our door, but I'll change it after our Fourth of July BBQ!

      I used a new layout. Yay. I got bored with the other.  Yesterday I ran seven miles, then went to see Spiderman2 with Brian, Corynne, and Joseph (aka...JOEY). It was okay. Ehhh. Then we went to see Brian's show, but I was exhausted from running and waking up early and Corynne was tired from donating blood earlier.  Not much else going on...a rather dreary fourth of July, however. Happy 228th, America. It's a good one, isn't it?
