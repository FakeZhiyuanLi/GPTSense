      In the past couple of weeks I have chatted up with two eligible bachelors who have stated they were interested in me for more than a hookup.&nbsp; In both cases I readily agreed to meet them as they were:   1) Single, gay&nbsp;and breathing  2) Younger than my own years.&nbsp;&nbsp;Gentleman #1&nbsp;was about 8 years younger than me and Gentleman # 2 was 1 year younger than me  3) Attractive.&nbsp; This was determined either through photographical evidence or based on their profile's description and built up in my own single and lonely mind that I imagined a god-like creature I would willingly bow down to and perform his bidding.  4) Had a good personality; at least&nbsp;for the short time we chatted.&nbsp; Gentleman # 1 and I even went so far as to engage in an actual&nbsp;conversation bia the telephone.&nbsp; This last point is by no means a small one, most gay men I chat with are either aloof, vain, too competitive, too picky; holding out for their own interpretation of what they feel is the perfect specimen of manhood or in general, they suffer from any discerning sign of any personality.   In both cases all signs pointed to a potential match, so as I said; I readily agreed to meet them, in a public place for coffee or dinner.&nbsp; Sadly in both cases I was, as they say, stood up.&nbsp; I can't, for the life of me, understand why an otherwise seemingly intelligent human being would agree to meet at a specified time and place and then turn out to be a no-show.&nbsp; I presented full disclosure in my profile, photos, chat.....I was genuinely interested in whatever they had to offer.&nbsp; Had they shown up and it turned out not to be a match, well....no harm, no foul.&nbsp; &nbsp;Try as I might I can't figure out what the charge would have been for each of them to have agreed and not meet, it's not as though we had a lengthy exchange of sexual dialogue wherein they, on their end of the internet line were jerking off.&nbsp; When I think back on the chat it was rather innoucuous if not pleasant.&nbsp;   Why would a guy not show up? What is the point?&nbsp; Could it have been some bizarre frat hazing?&nbsp; Dude, see if you can get a queer to meet you and you can join our fraternity.&nbsp; Seeing as it is only July, this doesn't seem likely.&nbsp; Aside from being frustrating it is a&nbsp;hurtful and aggrevating thing to&nbsp;go through; in the case of&nbsp;Gentleman #1, &nbsp;I drove 20 miles out of my way to meet for dinner.&nbsp; All systems were go&nbsp;to the extent we chatted on the phone as I arrived.&nbsp; And then I waited.&nbsp; And waited.&nbsp; And waited.&nbsp; For 90 minutes I waited in hopes an ambulance would pull up to carry an attractive, yet&nbsp;injured &nbsp;gentleman to the hospital suffering from a bad fall caused by running down his apartment stairwells well en route to meeting me at street level.&nbsp; Alas no ambulance arrived and dejected, I turned on my heels and headed back to my car and back to my own more comfortable, yet lonely surroundings.   Gentleman #2&nbsp;and I agreed to meet at a Border's bookstore for coffee.&nbsp; After arriving five minutes early I grabbed a sugar free cappucino-like drink and sat down, eagerly awaiting his arrival, &nbsp;among the crowd gathered around the cafe area.&nbsp;&nbsp; At that point, it certainly hadn't occured to me that I could be stood up twice in 9 days.&nbsp; I mean, who could have such a run of bad luck in meeting a potential life mate?&nbsp; After breezily reading a newspaper I glanced at my watch to realize that Gentleman # 2 was 25 minutes late.&nbsp; As anal retentive as I may be, I sucked in my breath and resigned myself to relax.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course he was going to show up.   Lacking any reading material after completing the newspaper; I jaunted over to the Film & Performing Arts section, which of course I default to in any bookstore and spied a&nbsp;hereto undiscovered book&nbsp;on Alfred Hitchcock.&nbsp; Snatching it up I returned to the cafe and comfortably sank down onto a leather sofa and began discovering all over again the Master of Suspense's filmography and tricks of the trade.&nbsp; Another hour passed before I realized, to my horror that...to quote Piper Laurie in "Carrie", "He's not coming.&nbsp; He's not gonna come."   Alone and dejected, I drove&nbsp;home.  It may not have turned out to be her dream date, but&nbsp;even Carrie got to go to&nbsp;the prom.   &nbsp;   to be continued....

      I alternately feel determined and hopeless in my quest to change my body from a fatty fat to a hottie hot.&nbsp;&nbsp; I have 20 plus years of sins to eradicate and sometimes I think I am kidding myself.&nbsp; It's been only three weeks since I started seeing a trainer (oh if only I could be saying that same sentence and ending it with the word "socially") so I realize any changes that may possibly be occuring are hidden under inches of blubber.&nbsp; I say this not to continue to beat myself up but because tonight I had a minor victory.&nbsp; Mind you, the operative word is minor, but I still consider the following a victoy.  Over the past three weeks Jose has attempted to get me to do crunches.&nbsp; Not the garden variety mind you, I am able to do those; but rather a special type of crunch I have never heard of, nor has anyone I have inquired has quite understood as well.&nbsp; While lying on the mat, he has&nbsp;me raise my legs vertically.&nbsp; As I take the form&nbsp;of a human equivelant of a right angle I am to do crunches.&nbsp; In the past I can barely get my legs up; I think mostly because he has me do these crunches at the end of the workout, when all my energy has been depleted.&nbsp; I don't like failing, particularly in front of someone else&nbsp;and more than that&nbsp;I don't ever want to let Jose down.&nbsp; I grant you that last part makes no sense, what difference should it make if I let Jose down, he is being paid to move my carcass.&nbsp;&nbsp; But as much as he has my respect, I so desperately need and crave&nbsp;his respect and support; I am reduced to a puppy dog to his Alpha Male.&nbsp; So tonight after the standard crunches he told me to raise my legs.&nbsp; &nbsp;I closed my eyes and&nbsp;raised my legs, hoping I still had the strength to fulfill his request.&nbsp;&nbsp;To my surprise when I opened them they were, more or less, in the proper form.&nbsp; I was only able to do 10, all the while grunting and panting; but dammit, I did them.&nbsp;

      Back when I was in elementary school I have two specific rememberances that clearly indicated I was a homosexual. Well really, one that would outwardly indicate my sexual preference the other was more or less a secret crush.   I was in the second grade when I make friends with Peter Piotrowski.&nbsp; He was in the third grade. My family had a swimming pool and I invited him to come over shortly after summer recess started to spend the day swimming.&nbsp; I remember him being so cute and funny with very blond fine hair and I was so happy that someone actually liked me, I didn't have a lot of friends at the time.&nbsp; My parents were furious that I had invited him over, not&nbsp;so&nbsp;much that they didn't want me to have friends but I hadn't cleared it through them and they were uptight about the possibility of a strange kid coming over to use our pool.&nbsp; It certainly would have been sad for them should I have drowned but if an outside kid had an accident, well they didn't want the fiduciary responsibility.&nbsp; Of course I cried and cried.&nbsp; I couldn't possibly tell them that I loved Peter, and truthfully I don't think I knew that's what the issue was -&nbsp;I mean I was only 8; but all I wanted was to be with him.&nbsp; (Oy, even then, the drama)&nbsp; They eventually relented and Peter did come over at some point, but I remember it being quite anti climactic; even if I didn't have the mental capacity to understand why or how this was so.&nbsp; Once he was at my house, I kinda just wanted him to leave.&nbsp;&nbsp;Not only was I exhibiting the signs of being gay, I was acting like a typical gay male well beyond my years.&nbsp; We want what we want, but as soon as we get it we want something else.   The second outward sign of my homosexuality came about two years later.&nbsp; Keir Pellisero was a new kid to our school.&nbsp; He was athletic, cute with really nice tassled brown hair, with just a little curl to make him even more handsome.&nbsp;&nbsp; We had chorus practice in the school&nbsp;gymnasium and&nbsp;I was seated behind him; this&nbsp;only hard wired me into believing even at this early age that attractive people were moved to the front while the more average looking people are relegated to the back.&nbsp; One day during chorus practice I impulsively started playing with Keir's hair, twirling it in my fingers with abandon.&nbsp; When I look back I was probably freaking him out, or at least you would think that would freak him out but he remained still; neither stopping me nor indicating that I was doing something forbidden.&nbsp; This went on for several minutes until the teacher admonished me in front of the entire class with "Frank, stop playing with Keir's hair".&nbsp; Instantly the room filled with the laughter of the entire class which shot through me like a humiliation filled lightening bolt; though outwardly I would just shrug it off.&nbsp;&nbsp; I think that was my first realization that boys liking boys was bad, forbidden and should me kept to yourself.&nbsp; In 1974, at the age of 10 I wouldn't have been aware that 5 years earlier my older "brothers and sisters"&nbsp;rioted at the&nbsp;Stonewall Inn&nbsp;for the expressed purpose of&nbsp;exhibiting sexual freedom.&nbsp; It would take me another 10 years to come to terms with my own liberation.   Utopia is the only place I am aware of where&nbsp;a boy or girl wouldn't have to feel&nbsp;humiliated, ashamed, shunned or an outcast for being different.&nbsp; There's no denying that we are closer then ever to just such a society but still we are far from being free.&nbsp; Matthew Shephard was brutally murdered just for being different, I was simply made fun of and ridiculed for a couple weeks until&nbsp;Billy Baker threw up&nbsp;during class.&nbsp; Thank you&nbsp;Billy for taking the heat off me, even if that wasn't your intention.

      I remember my first date with a guy pretty well.&nbsp; It was about 20 years ago; I was 20 and while I was sure of what I wanted I wasn't too clear how to go about getting it.&nbsp; Being the days before the internet there weren't alot of avenues to travel to achieve my goal of finding the guy that would become my first boyfriend and being underage a bar seemed out of the question as well.&nbsp; Our local paper did however have a personals section so I decided to place an ad.&nbsp;   The first detail of placing the ad was to secure a post office box in which I could receive replies while also insuring my discretion.&nbsp; The details of my ad are long forgotten but I suspect it was probably fairly generic.&nbsp; Looking back I would have expected my replies than the 7 or 8&nbsp;I received; I say this since nowadays it seems every guy wants a 20 year old to break in.&nbsp; I was rather shocked and more than a little turned off with the reply of an "x" pic and rather profane letter.&nbsp; Needless to say that one went in the garbage.&nbsp; The one reply that does stand out in my memory&nbsp;because it is the one I ultimated answered was from a doctor.&nbsp; I thought, wow, that's a catch.&nbsp; Isn't it every gay boy's dream to land a doctor husband?&nbsp; The doctor included a phone number which I used to contact him and after a brief chat we decided to meet in person at a diner in Dover, NJ.&nbsp; I figured Dover was close enough to where I lived, about 10-12 miles but far enough that I wouldn't see anyone I knew, lest I got "caught" on this date.&nbsp;   Being a doctor (a grown up profession), I understood he was older, about 35-38.&nbsp; I hate to admit it, but I was disappointed when we met face to face, he really wasn't my type, not that I knew at that point what my type was.&nbsp; But seeing as we were both there, it seemed silly to turn around and leave, not that I would have thought then that it would have been ok to leave.&nbsp; Being 20 I was the pinnacle of wide eyed earnestness; not yet having developed into&nbsp;the&nbsp;jaded cynical being I am now proud to be.  Doctor "X" (I have no idea what his name was) turned out to be a geuinely nice guy, but - and isn't there always a "but"? - had a strange fixation on the Muppets which, I have to say I found strange and a little bit of a turn off.&nbsp; The more&nbsp;I ponder this in the present I find it ironic since I now have a bit of a crush on an actor starring in Avenue Q on Broadway, which of course, is a satire of Sesame Street crossed with Rent; replete with a cast of very muppet like puppets.&nbsp;   If the muppet fixation wasn't damning enough the good doctor turned out to be&nbsp;a podiatrist, which I grant you is a noble and necessary profession but hardly what I had in mind as a potential life mate.&nbsp;   Alas, Chuck Woolery was unable to make a love connection for us and I never saw him again after our one and only date.&nbsp; But it did give me the experience I had been seeking for as long as I could rememebr, up to that point. And it diminshed the possiblity that I would be alone for the rest of my life.&nbsp; There have been many dates since and although I am, as I stated before, a self professed jaded and cynical being; nothing can brighten a day as much as the prospect of going out on a date.&nbsp; The mere opportunity to meet, face to face with a possible significant other&nbsp;I find very exciting and always fun.&nbsp;   Dating is nice.&nbsp; Make someone happy, go on a date this weekend.

      Sadly, Academy Award winning composer Jerry Goldsmith has passed away.&nbsp; He died in his sleep after a long bout with cancer.&nbsp; Often his musical compositions had a experimental sound which complemented the action on the screen without owerpowering; particularly  Alien  and  Planet of the Apes .&nbsp; He was a pioneer in using electronic sounds in addition to instruments.&nbsp;   During his career he was nominated for 17 Academy Awards, winning only once for Fox's 1976 megahit,  The Omen .&nbsp; His work on  The Omen  also included an Academy Award nomination for Best Song, " Ave Santini "; which truly captured the evil within the film and is undoubtely the scariest component of the film.   He began his&nbsp;career&nbsp;writing familiar themes and scoring for&nbsp;many television shows ( Studio One ,  Gunsmoke ,  Have Gun - Will Travel ); he contined writing for television throughout his career ( Twilight Zone ,  The Waltons ,  Room 222 ,  Star Trek - The Next Generation ).   His filmography included the films  Logan's Run ,  MacArthur ,  Coma ,  Boys From Brazil ,  Poltergeist ,  Gremlins ,  I.Q. ,  Total Recall  and  The Sum of All Fears .   He was truly an innovator in his field&nbsp;and while he has passed on; his work&nbsp;will continue to thrill generations to come.&nbsp;

      This entry is dedicated to my favorite little guy, Babalu.&nbsp; He certainly isn't a substitute for a lover, but in the end he probably gets on my my nerves at about the same rate as any guy I have ever known.   Babalu is now 8, and last September he was diagnosed with hypertrophic cardio myopathy...in other words he has a heart condition.&nbsp; The chamber walls of his heart are thickening and eventually it just won't be able to pump the blood through his system.&nbsp; It kinda sucks cause he seriously is a great companion cat.&nbsp; He's always at the door waiting for me when I get home, I have no idea how he can distinguish my footsteps coming up the stairs as opposed to someone else's but I think he can.&nbsp; He also races to the end table that's seated directly by the front door when I leave, one last opportunity for me to give him a little face and neck rub.&nbsp; Hey if it makes him happy, then it makes me happy.&nbsp;   I've had him since he was a youngin'; he was born on April 15th, 1996 and I brought him home on the Friday before&nbsp;Memorial Day of the same year.&nbsp; He was born into the family of a co-workers' friend and he was brought to me that Friday at work.&nbsp; He was, without a doubt, the cutest kitten I had ever seen and from the moment we "met" we seemed to bond.&nbsp; He was such a tiny little thing and climbed up my arm as though we were old friends.&nbsp; I also remember all my co-workers making such a fuss over him, wanting to pet him and cooing and fussing over him; Senior Management obviously didn't appreciate it but since we were getting out early anyway, they basically looked the other way.&nbsp; Have to say it was there loss for looking the other way for one look into his eyes and you couldn't help but melt.   I remember when I brought him home, all textbooks will say that a cat or kitten entering a new&nbsp; home will walk the perimeter of the room while they are getting used to their surroundings....not Babalu, he just walked out of the carrier&nbsp;and settled in immediately.&nbsp; He was so self confidant and cool and fun when he was younger but I guess living in my home which for months at a time would have&nbsp;no visitors has made him more than slightly wary whenever he hears someone approaching the front door.&nbsp; Most times now he will either run like hell into the bedroom, leaving behind him a vapor trail a la an old Warner Brothers cartoon or he will run to the hallway entrance, pausing and looking back just long enough so he can confirm in his little cat mind that whoever is at the door is not someone he wants to socialize with.&nbsp; If the visitor is a temporary visitor (read: hookup) he will essentially stay out of sight for the entire visit.&nbsp; If however the visitor is a friend(s) or a date&nbsp;and we settle into some leisure time, like watching a movie or having dinner he will typically make an entrance within an hour.&nbsp; Just to say hello, then he will retire back to the bedroom and wait till the coast is clear.&nbsp; I guess I blame myself for his skittishness as for&nbsp;too many years I&nbsp;would get stoned around him.&nbsp;&nbsp; I guess marijuana can and does kill brain cells, I just didn't think the brain cells would be his; but perhaps I am over reacting on this point.   He doesn't ask for much really, fresh water, some dry food, canned food on a regular schedule (within reason) and of course a litter box that is taken care of on a regular basis and of course attention.&nbsp; Boy does he require attention...it is impossible for me to sit a the computer for any length of time without him jumping up on the desk and standing directly in front of the monitor - which, let me tell you, can get not only old but pretty damn annoying.&nbsp; But on the whole, I wouldn't have it any other way - the benefits of sharing an apartment with him far outway the negatives.   Babalu is a cool cat and while I know he won't be around for ever, I hope while he's with me he is as happy and&nbsp;content with me as&nbsp;I have been with him.&nbsp;   Thank you Babalu for 8 great years, lets hope you can make it another 8.  :)   &nbsp;

      Today began the third week of working one on one with my personal trainer.&nbsp; Today was the toughest workout so far.&nbsp; I knew he was going to&nbsp;step it up, he said he was and he certainly did.&nbsp; Jose amuses me, I don't mean that in a condescending way; he left me a message one day last week, about what I'm not even sure I remember but his message started out with "Hello, this is Jose Fuentes, your personal trainer...".&nbsp; I can't help but crack a smile even as I wrote that; I mean yes it's possible I know another Jose, I don't but of course it's possible.&nbsp; But to clarify that he is Jose Fuentes and to follow it up, as if there would be some sort of confusion on my part because I didn't recognize his voice, he reminds me that he is my personal trainer...you gotta love someone like that.&nbsp; It's all I think about night and day, not him per se; but that I am going through this metamorphosis and it consumes my every thought.&nbsp;   Can I do it?&nbsp; Will I succeed?&nbsp; Will I be the better person for it?&nbsp; What will I look like when I am done?&nbsp; I can't even imagine.&nbsp; I would like to think I will be a million times more&nbsp;attractive physically, I mean I have certainly seen my share of the male phsyique both in person and in pictures (thank god for the internet) and I think that even an average or below average face on a sculpted body equals above average looks.&nbsp;&nbsp; Let's hope so.&nbsp; I am certain I have the determination to go for quite some time.  Jose weighed me in before we started, we were both pretty happy when I weighed in at 322, that's an 8 pound drop in two weeks.&nbsp;&nbsp;During the workout&nbsp;session I noticed he was much more into it then has been in the previous two weeks, cheering me on, motivating me, trying to get my flabby unused muscles to perform in ways that have, until now, been unaccustomed to.&nbsp;   Once again I was spewing perspiration, I must look like a lawn sprinkler when I get like that and it embarasses the hell outof me.&nbsp; But I suppose it's my overly large&nbsp;body just trying to keep itself from overheating.&nbsp;   After the workout we were chatting, I had some serious (and seriously embarassing) questions for him.&nbsp; Such as, once I have lost the weight, will I have disguting saggy skin all over my body.&nbsp;&nbsp; I mean I have such a gut (still, even after losing 68 pounds in approximately three months), I know the weight will continue to drop off and the abdominals will contine to tighten and develop, but I'm not convinced that the skin will bounce back.&nbsp; He assured me it will.&nbsp; Also I was asking about stretch marks, woudl they go away.&nbsp; He said they would.&nbsp; I hope he's right. Of course I believe everything he tells me, I have no reason not to; he's been doing this for some time.&nbsp; I just have this horrible feeling that despite my acquiring a muscular body after logging in many many hours working out that I will still have these gross stretch marks and sagging skin.&nbsp; That would really suck.&nbsp; Not to mention completely unfair, but so far as I know, there is no complaint department in life&nbsp;that will handle that problem.&nbsp; "Excuse me, God?&nbsp; Yes, I would like to exchange this skin......you can see it's damaged?"&nbsp; Fat (no pun inteended) chance.  So during our chat he informed me of the following:  1) By October I should see musuclar development 2) By December I should be down to 250 3) By April 2005 (sounds like a long time, but its really only nine months)&nbsp; I should be "cut"(?). He didn't use that word but that was the impression I had.&nbsp; But really, basedon where I am now, anything will be an improvement.   Right now my stomach is killing me (damn crunches)&nbsp;and I can barely sit up straight; I am sure tomorrow I will feel better.&nbsp; And each day thereafter....a little better...I just have to take it One Day at a Time.

      Since I am going through a self imposed "ReInvention" it seems pointless to date or rather more accurately it seems pointless to try to find the guy for me.&nbsp; I can currently attract chubby chasers but who wants to be with someone that is into the one thing you would give anything to change about oneself.&nbsp; Besides as soon as they learn that you are actually going through a "ReInvention" they are out of here.&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; As for hooking up....well let's just say that's being put on hold as well...Meaningless encounters are actually ok in my book but I just want to focus a few months on myself to improve myself overall.&nbsp; Maybe by Christmas I will be in decent enough shape so my self confidance will allow me to have some fun.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Of course, that doesn't mean I won't be online, or even in a chat room......but that will be background white noise....and if someone should, by chance, actually contact me and want to meet me...well far be it from me to disappoint them. :) &nbsp; Sorry this entry is boring......but I am pretty tired from the weekend and walking tonight.&nbsp; Oy tomorrow is a PT night; it was bad enough when Jose had to take my measurements in the beginning, and despite being smaller (I am convinced) now that I know him a little better I just find it a little embarassing and humiliating to have to strip in front of him and allow myself to be measured around the circumference as though I were some big ass pumpkin in the county fair.  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

      The Assassination of "Assassins"  &nbsp;  Right now, as I write this entry, &nbsp;the very last performance of "Assassins" is taking place at Studio 54 in NYC.&nbsp; With a book by John Weidman, Music and Lyrics by Stephen Sondheim, Directed by Joe Mantello, Starring Becky Ann Baker (Sara Jane Moore), James Barbour (Leon Czolgosz), Mario Cantone (Samuel Byck), Tony Winner Michael Cerveris (John Wilkes Booth), Mary Catherine Garrison (Lynette "Squeaky" Fromme), Alexander Gemignani(John Hinckley), Neil Patrick Harris (Balladeer/Lee Harvey Oswald), John Schiappa (Proprietor), Jeffrey Kuhn(Giuseppe Zangara) and Denis O'Hare (Charles Guiteau).  &nbsp;  The closing was announced a&nbsp;few weeks ago as attendance has been down and they had not been playing to capacity.&nbsp;&nbsp;Luckily I had secured tickets to the show just prior to this annoucement for today's matinee.&nbsp; I have seen my share&nbsp;shows both on Broadway and off;&nbsp;granted my taste is, I think, what you would call eclectic.&nbsp; I've seen Gypsy (with Bernadette Peters), Urinetown, Wicked, The Guys (with Susan Sarandon), The Mercy Seat (with Liev Schreiber and Sigourney Weaver), The Rocky Horror Show, Woody Allen's Writer's Block, Sweeney Todd (1989 revival), and the infamous expensive Broadway flop Carrie&nbsp;to name a few....but I have to say I think Assassins is the best show I have ever seen.  &nbsp;  From the moment the show started to the finale I was completly mesmorized and under the spell of the entire cast and production team.&nbsp; Essentially a review chronicling, in a carnival-like atmosphere, 9 American political assassins and would be assassins, the show is steeped with very dark humor and boasts a beautiful and melodic score that could only have come from legendary Broadway composer Stephen Sondheim; a man I have been fascinated by, attracted to, and in total awe of.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Every aspect of this show, from the production design, lighting, musicians, was flawless.&nbsp;&nbsp;All ten performers listed&nbsp;above were superlative.&nbsp; Simply put, I have never been so filled&nbsp;with glee, joy and pure contentment during a theatrical performance. &nbsp;  In June of this year this show won 5 Tony Awards, Best Revival, Best Director (Joe Mantello), Best Featured Actor in a Musical (Michael Cervaris), Best Lighting (Jules Fisher and Peggy Eisenhauer)&nbsp;and Best Orchestrations (Michael Starobin)....so you may be asking, if this show is so good and it won all these awards...why is it closing?&nbsp;&nbsp;Well as I previously stated&nbsp;it just wasn't playing to capacity and couldn't&nbsp;continue.&nbsp; I can't imagine a more depressing scenario; I suppose people just want to attend glossy, slick, happy sappy (and crappy) shows like Forty Second Street, Aida, and Beauty and the Beast (don't even get me started on the putrid Disney-fication of Broadway in recent years), to name just three long running&nbsp;shows still playing.&nbsp; I know, I know, it's all a matter of personal taste and I'm not arguing that point.&nbsp; Art is subjective.&nbsp; But consider this, we can't subsist on a diet of all candy (granted it's taken me many years to realize this), shouldn't we vary our&nbsp;entertainment as we vary our diet?&nbsp; Doesn't it make us a more complete healthy person?&nbsp; Shouldn't we treat our minds as well as our bodies?&nbsp;  &nbsp;  A thought provoking intelligent show like Assassins probably never had a chance.&nbsp; I just find it so depressing to know I live in a world where IQ's are dropping&nbsp;at an alarmingly accelerated rate.&nbsp; Good times.&nbsp; Good times indeed.

      This blog entry&nbsp;is dedicated to a new found friend I have met online.&nbsp; He has his own blog and is currently dealing with coming out of the proverbial closet.&nbsp; In fact, it is he who&nbsp;inspired me to start my own blog;&nbsp;&nbsp;I eagerly await to read his daily updates.&nbsp; The first couple entries of his that&nbsp;I read I couldn't understand what the big deal was...but I gradually came around to his side.&nbsp; He is 32 and has, up till now, led a traditional heterosexual life.&nbsp; I on the other hand, came out when I was 20 and really knew no other existance.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Memorial Day, 1985....The local Gay and Lesbian Alliance was having a barbeque (if you read my earlier post, you will understand that the fact that they were serving food was definitely a perk).&nbsp; Anyway, I digress, as I do far too often.&nbsp;&nbsp; I attended the picnic, well actually it wasn't that breezy..I drove by about 12 times before I had the nerve to pull into the driveway.&nbsp; The local Gay and Lesbian Alliance holds their meetings at a Luthean church, so I guess my first major fear was that I would burst into flames upon setting foot on holy ground.&nbsp; Having alleveated that irrational fear I did pull into the driveway and parked my car.  &nbsp;  There is something profoundly disturbing about acknowlegding your sexual preference particularly when it is not considered mainstream, traditional or normal.&nbsp; I suppose my generation had it particularly harsh since the AIDS crises was just coming to light.&nbsp; Of course I took it personally, as though a higher power deemed that I should not be allowed to fulfill my sexual destiny.&nbsp;&nbsp; I made my way to the front door of the church and&nbsp;looked around to see if anyone driving by could see me walk in.&nbsp; Luckily the coast was clear&nbsp;so I opened the door, walked in and didn't look back.  &nbsp;  The lobby sign indicated that the BBQ was in the meeting room on the first floor, after&nbsp;milling &nbsp;around the lobby, reading every flyer on the Community Bulletin Board I gradually made my way to the meeting room, lest I appeared overeager to join in the fun.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  The room was setup for a meeting with the steel folding chairs you would expect to&nbsp;find at a school &nbsp;auditorium.&nbsp; There were only a couple people there, primarily because I was a half hour early.&nbsp; I made my way to the back of the room and sat down in a chair in the last row.&nbsp; So far, so good I thought, this wasn't so bad.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  As the next 30 minutes progressed more people filed in, occaisionally I felt them glance at me, the new comer, but mostly they chatted amongst themselves like friends do.&nbsp; The realization that I was an outsider in an millieu that I was unfamiliar with caused me increased anxiety.  &nbsp;  There was a brief meeting with information given out and updates on upcoming events...none of which I listened to as the blood pounding in my ears caused a slight hearing loss. Thirty minutes later the meeting broke and the evening turned social.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  I was approached by Friendly Gay Man # 1, who it turned out, lived about a mile from my house.&nbsp; I never saw him again but for that brief moment I felt like&nbsp;I had a gay friend, or should I say "sister"? I was leaning against a stack of folding chairs facing him and we chatted for a while. I confessed it was my first time there.&nbsp; A couple minutes passed by and we were joined by Friendly Gay Man # 2, at which point I had to repeat it was my first time.&nbsp; After a couple more minutes passed by Friendly Gay Man # 3 joined us and again I had to relate that it was my first time there.&nbsp; The ventilation in the meeting room was pretty poor, and the heat and humidity from what we traditionally consider the start of summer was becoming increasingly oppressive.&nbsp; It was, I suppose, about this time that I realized that three gay men were surrounding me in a semi circle, not in a predatory fashion but just as any little clique would form a little hen party.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  The sudden realization that I was among my peers should have made me feel welcome and comfortable and secure.&nbsp; I mean, I was with my own kind....right?&nbsp;  &nbsp;  In actuality I felt very stressed, hot and&nbsp;uncomfortable.&nbsp; It was then that my vision started to fade a bit, going from slightly gray to near black and I felt my legs buckle under me.&nbsp; I didn't lose conciousness but I was unable to hide the fact that there was something seriously wrong with me.&nbsp; I reached my arm out to grab the chairs behind me as my legs were giving out.&nbsp; For the three men not to have noticed would have meant their combined IQ scores would have equaled the posted&nbsp;speed limit outside the church.&nbsp; I understand it isn't socially acceptable to look away during these times, after all it's a good samaritan to come to the aid of the needy.&nbsp; But I really did wish they would have had the good grace to act like nothing out of the ordinary had occured.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  They all reached to help steady me, and I feebly offered the excuse of the heat...I excused myself as&nbsp;I unsteadily but persistently headed for the door.&nbsp; Once outside the ample quantities of fresh air helped to further "sober" me up.&nbsp; I ran for my car.&nbsp; Seconds after getting behind the wheel, Friendly Gay Man # 1 appeared in my driver window and asked if I was alright.&nbsp; I assured him I was, thanked him profusely and left.  &nbsp;  It would be months before I would return to any meetings.&nbsp; But I did go back.&nbsp; Well...maybe&nbsp;four times in the twenty years since.  &nbsp;  Looking back on that experience, I am very glad I went.&nbsp; Not so glad it went the way it did, but we can't rewrite history.&nbsp; Sadly I couldn't appreciate the one aspect I look back on now with fondness...which is the fact that three Friendly Gay Men were simultaneously&nbsp;genuinely interested in hatever it was that I had to say.&nbsp; It's true when they say youth is wasted on the wrong people.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;

      What exactly does that mean?&nbsp; I was alive for 40 years before "My Life Began...".&nbsp;&nbsp; And 40 isn't exactly correct either, more like 39 and 8 or 9 months would be more accurate but that doesn't have as nice a ring to it and lets face it, everything we know in life is now packaged and marketed so well that....Life Began at 40 seems to be a more solid name.  &nbsp;  Brief History  I am the youngest of five kids from a middle class family brought up in a middle class neighborhood in a middle class home.&nbsp; Being the youngest of the five, typically I was the one everyone picked on.&nbsp; Now I am not trying to evoke any sympathy, I'm merely&nbsp;just expressing how I interpret my youth.  &nbsp;  I was always a fat kid growing up.&nbsp; I wasn't particularly active,&nbsp;I didn't do much of&nbsp;anything, other than cooking...And eating, oh and watching TV.&nbsp; I excelled at pop culture even as a tot.&nbsp; Some of my fondest memories of my childhood are Friday nights on ABC-TV:&nbsp;  The Brady Bunch ,  The Partridge Family  (a particular favorite, I still listen to their records with relish and reverence),  Room 222 ,  The Odd Couple  and lastly  Love American Style .&nbsp; These shows (and many others), as well as films molded me into who I am today.&nbsp; Not sure if I should be proud or seek an attorney to file a civil suit.  &nbsp;  I have vivid memory of my parents taking me and my sister to&nbsp;Morris Plains' &nbsp;drive in during the summer of 1973.&nbsp;&nbsp; The feature attraction?&nbsp; Twentieth Century-Fox's box office bonanza  The Poseidon Adventure .&nbsp; I can't remember the date, but the film was released in December of 1972, so I estimate it was probably July of 1973.&nbsp; I was so psyched to see this, the commercials on TV demanded my attention everytime I caught them.&nbsp; For months I had wanted to see&nbsp;this movie.&nbsp; Now I was born in June of 1964 so I was only 9 when I saw this movie.....During the&nbsp;film my mother asked, to know one in particular, or perhaps to me;&nbsp;I can't be sure (referring to the actress portraying Susan Shelby, the teenager who had a serious case of the hots for leading man Gene Hackman, "Isn't she the one who's on that show  The Partridge Family ?"  &nbsp;  From the backseat of the Buick I chimed in, "No mother, Susan Dey portrays  Laurie Partridge , this actress is named Pamela Sue Martin."&nbsp; Ok, I may be embellishing slightly, but I swear I have that memory.&nbsp; My father interrupted however with a "Would you shut up!&nbsp; I'm trying to watch this!"&nbsp;  &nbsp;  I truly missed my calling, perhaps for some reason I felt I could make a living at memorizing&nbsp;and retaining film credits, actors and production peoples names and their filmographies.&nbsp; To this day I can recall with a fairly alarming rapidity an actor's, or crew person's body of work.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also found a pattern in that Twentieth Century-Fox always (at that time, anyway)&nbsp; produced and/or released a&nbsp;fairly high volume of projects that I was drawn to:&nbsp;  Planet of the Apes ,  Poseidon Adventure ,  Towering Inferno ( co-produced by Warner Brothers, which at the time was a record breaking deal; no studios at that time had ever combined to produce a joint production ) ,  Lost in Space , etc etc.  &nbsp;  Ok back to my being a fat kid.&nbsp; I was fat. Fat. Fat. Fat.&nbsp; Yes it hurt when kids would make fun of me but I always seemed to have some endless supply of self respect (I realize gentle reader that its somewhat of a contradiction;&nbsp; being really fat&nbsp;would not seem as though one has self respect), so to use the proverbial playground sentiment: sticks and stones...... I would choose to simply ignore them.&nbsp; Junior high school years were particularly rough, after 6 years of familiarity with the kids at my grade&nbsp;school, 7th grade brought about many changes.&nbsp; A whole new set of kids to meet and to be teased by.&nbsp; Good times.&nbsp;&nbsp; High school was not much different.&nbsp;&nbsp;Rather then drag out this first entry with&nbsp;25-30 year old annecdotes, which truthfully future entries in this blog&nbsp;will probably be peppered with&nbsp;them so it's best I don't blow my wad now; let it suffice to say growing up wasn't fun.....but who does have a "normal" growing up&nbsp;years?  &nbsp;  Anyway in my sophmore year of high school, early in the year, we had a visit to the school nurse.&nbsp;&nbsp;The accumulated fat in my brain&nbsp;must have clouded my&nbsp;intuition for I had no idea what was to come next.&nbsp; Apparantly she called my home and because of my obesity (I think I was tipping the scale either at or near 350 pounds) she&nbsp;suggested to my parents that I be in our family doctor's care.&nbsp; So off to Dr.&nbsp;Huster I went, and began monthly visits.&nbsp; Immediately I was put on a diet that my parents (unsuccesfully) tried to enforce.&nbsp; Up until that time I had free reign to eat whatever&nbsp;(and probably whenever) I chose.&nbsp; Now portions were cut drastically back, I&nbsp;felt like a prisoner.&nbsp; I cheated every opportunity&nbsp;I could.&nbsp; You know the saying&nbsp;"desperate times call for desperate measures"?&nbsp; Well possibly a few months into these visits I was put on a drug called Tenuate Dospan, if memory serves.&nbsp; It's an appetitie suppressant drug but it also has side effects.&nbsp; I developed heart palpitations every once in a while.&nbsp; Suddenly I would feel my heart pounding in my chest with such a vengeance; the first time I was convinced I was dying right then and there.&nbsp; These "attacks" would hit anytime.....I could be lying down reading a book and suddenly the beating of a bass drum was happening inside my chest.&nbsp;&nbsp; I quickly learned to take a deep breath, I imagined my lungs filling to capacity pressing up against my heart to stop it from its irregular beat and slowly exhaling.&nbsp; Usually that would do the trick.&nbsp; That routine was pure&nbsp;instinct but ironically years later I read&nbsp;about&nbsp;doing&nbsp;&nbsp;something like that in that&nbsp;kind of situation.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  I would have to say about six months into this "program" I became closer friends with my next door neighbor; she had just lost her father (who used to unintentionally intimidate the hell out of me).&nbsp; We started to hang out more and I found myself doing stuff.&nbsp; Not much, but just being out of my house and not near food seemed to be a key in my&nbsp;weight loss.&nbsp; Suddenly I started dropping weight.&nbsp; Cathy&nbsp;and I and a&nbsp;couple other friends of hers would go into&nbsp;NYC; walking around the city burned calories (duh) and the weight started flying off me.&nbsp; I went from 350 (my highest recorded weight and a size 54" waist)&nbsp;down to (if memory serves) 180 and a 34" waist.&nbsp; Just in time for the end of my&nbsp;junior high year.&nbsp; I lost 170 pounds.&nbsp;&nbsp;That's something.&nbsp; I wasn't anorexic I was just suddenly doing shit instead of sitting in front of my beloved television.&nbsp; I gained some weght back initially over the next few years, but I think that was normal...some people thought I looked emaciated at 180.&nbsp; But naturally it was such a drastic swing from one weight to the other.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  I had friends now, it was the summer before my senior year; got my&nbsp;drivers license, got a part time job at a local department store but I wasn't happy.&nbsp; I knew something was still not quite right....I think I knew&nbsp;what that something was, I just certainly wasn't prepared to deal with it and truthfully even if I&nbsp;was ready to deal with it I wouldn't have&nbsp;known&nbsp; how  to deal with it.&nbsp; I am talking about my sexuality.&nbsp; Yes I am&nbsp;queer.&nbsp; Gay.&nbsp; HOMOSEXUAL!!!!&nbsp; My first experiences with being gay was thinking Robin the Boy Wonder was cute.&nbsp; And getting certain feelings whenever he and Batman were&nbsp;caught in some bizarre trap set by one of the Super Arch Criminals (played with gusto by a  fabulous  guest cast).&nbsp; But again, this first entry is merely to set the stage for the present, I don't wish to relive my past, though again, you can expect future entries to have quite a few anecdotes of the past.  &nbsp;  Over the next several years I went to college, was employed here and there and in general taking&nbsp;life one day at a time (I hope I am not using too many cliches for your taste).&nbsp;  &nbsp;  In 1988 my parents retired and put their house on the market.&nbsp; It was obvious I was not going to be considered a fixture of the house so I had to move.&nbsp; My parent's plan was to move to&nbsp;Upstate New York, outside of Syracuse.&nbsp; I know that sounds strange, who retires to a colder climate?&nbsp; But my dad who worked his ass off for years to raise 5 kids loved to fish and had recently discovered the joys and thrills of salmon fishing, combined that with the simple fact that the area they intended to live to was a cheaper place to live.....well off they went.&nbsp; I had to move out and be on my own.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  By this point I ws frequenting a gay bar on the weekends known as  The Yacht Club.&nbsp; It was a fairly relaxed atmosphere even though the place was something of a dive.&nbsp; The bathrooms leaked, the roof leaked, the very large&nbsp;room on the side of the main&nbsp;bar area&nbsp;was never opened even though some nights the place was packed beyond my wildest dreams.&nbsp;&nbsp; There I made a friend name Duane, but he went by Jessie (ya gotta love gay men).&nbsp; We met because I started dating a friend of his,&nbsp; jeez - I can't even remember this guy's name....let's call him Michael.&nbsp; I seemed to be always dating someone named&nbsp;Michael, which was cool since I always liked that name.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Anyway Michael dumped me for someone else and Jessie (Duane) felt bad for me so we became friends.&nbsp; He was living at home and when I told him one night I was looking to find my own place he suggested we move in together.&nbsp; So we did.&nbsp; Can two homosexuals share an apartment without driving each other crazy?&nbsp; Well apparantly they can, but it does take a lot of work.....you have to turn a blind eye on things that you find really irritating.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Sometime in 1989 I had a reason to go to the doctor....I mention this because my recorded weight was around 239.&nbsp; So I had gained probably 30-40 pounds in about 7 years.&nbsp; Certainly not a horrible thing. not good either....  &nbsp;  In 1991 Jessie and I parted ways as he had met the man of his dreams and was moving in with him, I couldn't afford the rent on our two bedroom apartment on&nbsp;my own so I had to find alternate housing.&nbsp; Despite the fact that 1991 was a cool year at the box office for me personally (Thelma &amp; Louise, Terminator 2, Soapdish etc) I entered my low years.&nbsp; I moved into a one room apt (it was all I could afford) and became pretty apathetic.&nbsp; I stayed for about 2 and a half years, it took that long till I could afford to move into a tradtional 4 room apartment.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  So from 1989 until this year I managed to pack on&nbsp; surprising amount of&nbsp;weight.&nbsp; Around February of 2004 I&nbsp;recognized that I had to do something.&nbsp; I mean, what gay man wants to date a fatty fat?&nbsp;&nbsp; I had to do something to&nbsp;change myself around.&nbsp; Food was so important to me....not as a fuel but more as entertainment.&nbsp; I love to have people for dinner (by that I mean I cook for them and they dine with me, I am not a cannibal), I religously watched the Food Network and would&nbsp;emulate what I saw on various programs over the years.&nbsp; But something had to change.&nbsp; I didn't own a scale though my waist size balloned up to 54" again so I knew approximately what I weighed in at, from previous experience.&nbsp; So it was February when I decided I had to take action, but - crap - Easter was coming up, baked ham, asparagus, chocolate bunnies and robins malted milk eggs.....I couldn't pass that up.&nbsp; I mean I am only human.....aren't I?&nbsp;&nbsp; Consulting a calendar I surmised that April 19th, 2004&nbsp;would be the ideal time for me to start some kind of life changing plan.&nbsp; That was a Monday, one full week after Easter.....any leftovers would surely be gone by then.&nbsp; In the meantime every meal was like a condemned man's last meal.&nbsp; Eat up today, for tomorrow you won't be......  &nbsp;  A very good friend of mine from work told me about the South Beach Diet and from what he was telling me about it I thought, maybe this is the plan I should try.&nbsp;&nbsp; I bought the book and started reading it the week of Easter....as I was reading it Dr Agatston, the author of the book as well as a well known cardioligist in......Miami, of course; explained the mechanisims of eating and how insulin affects the blood sugar.&nbsp; How the blood sugar spikes after you eat,&nbsp; insulin is released and brings the blood sugar level down and it started to make sense.&nbsp; I thought&nbsp;I should invest the minimum time in this plan, two weeks and just see what happens.&nbsp; The first two weeks is designated as Phase 1 and you completely cut out all processed carbs.&nbsp; No sugar, no flour, no rice, potatoes or pasta, no bread, not even fruit.&nbsp;&nbsp; So what's left?&nbsp; Lot's of vegetables and&nbsp;ample amounts of lean protein.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Right before I started I bought a scale on Ebay.&nbsp; Sad to say I couldn't go into a Bed Bath and Beyond and buy any regular scale because most scales only go to 300 - 330 pounds tops.&nbsp; I suspected I was closer to 350 like I had been about&nbsp;24-25 years ago.&nbsp; So I bought a super scale, it goes up to 400 pounds.&nbsp; When it arrived I mustered up the courage and stepped on.&nbsp; My heart sank.&nbsp; I seriously thought there was no way this was right.&nbsp; How could it be?&nbsp; How the fuck could I have let myself get to be 390 pounds (as if the extra 40 pounds really made all that much difference).&nbsp; Oh I should probably point out that sometime around 1998&nbsp;I started to smoking pot after an absence of many years.....those munchies are really a killer.  &nbsp;  Well after getting over the hysterics of being 390 pounds I resolved all the more to be bound and determined to follow the South Beach Plan to the letter and just&nbsp; see what would happen after two weeks.  &nbsp;  So on April 18th I ate my last full fat, high carb&nbsp;meal, but to tell you the&nbsp;truth for weeks I was&nbsp;actually feeling rather sick....sluggish, in a horrible rut eating horrible horrible foods.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  On April 19th I started my routine of eating breakfast:  &nbsp;  1 glass of V8  1 hard boiled egg  coffee with artifical sweetener and skim milk  &nbsp;  Now I never used to eat breakfast before so it was&nbsp;difficult to get used to eating in the morning.  &nbsp;  Lunch&nbsp;consists of a&nbsp;salad with either grilled chicken or tuna salad atop dressed greens.  &nbsp;  Dinner is composed of lean protein and lots of vegetables.&nbsp; In the first&nbsp;weeks I basically ate salads.&nbsp; Lots and lots of salads.  &nbsp;  By the end of the first&nbsp;two weeks I had dropped 20 pounds and was already actually feeling&nbsp;better.&nbsp; I had a lot more energy and felt, well......vivacious! &nbsp;As Dr Agatston promises, if you stay on the plan during Phase 1 your body actually stops craving the&nbsp;bad carbs, i.e. sugar, bread pasta, etc.&nbsp; Damned if he wasn't right.&nbsp; 20 pounds is fairly substantial and I was thrilled.&nbsp; I wasn't hungry all the time, I was feeling better, and it&nbsp;was just easy to lose that weight.&nbsp; Of course, it was only 20 pounds against the, conservative estimate of 140 pounds I was shooting for, but still....  &nbsp;  Which brings us to the present.&nbsp; Today is July 17th and as of this morning I&nbsp;am down a total of (approximately, I mean, who can read the&nbsp;scale&nbsp;accurately?) 65 pounds.&nbsp;&nbsp;Not too shabby....  &nbsp;  I did an amazing thing last week too....I signed up with a personal trainer.&nbsp; Sometime around&nbsp;my epiphany in February/March I thought&nbsp;"How cool would it&nbsp;be if&nbsp;I could become muscular?"&nbsp; So that is my goal.....I want to be a hottie.&nbsp; I want to look&nbsp;like the kind of guy I am&nbsp;attracted to&nbsp;so that&nbsp;I could possibly attract one for myself.&nbsp; I know,&nbsp;I know, this may all&nbsp;sound&nbsp;rather shallow....but truthfully my health is not my priority, but its nice to know that's its benefiting from this sudden surge of wanting to be hot.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Today ended the second week with the trainer and while I don't feel any different, he has commented that my stamina is improved.&nbsp; That makes me feel good.&nbsp; Jose, my trainer is&nbsp;such an inspiration to me.&nbsp; He doesn't make me feel like I can't do something, he doesn't overly&nbsp;push me either, I think in the first couple days he was afraid I might keel over and have a heart attack, even though he would be absolved of any liability since I did sign a waiver.&nbsp; He told me today however that next week we will begin to target specific body parts.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Wherever I go from here I invite you to take the&nbsp;journey with me.&nbsp; Through my fears,&nbsp;depression, anxiety,&nbsp;frustration and&nbsp;ultimately success.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do aploigize for the overlength for this first post, but I truly felt the history was important.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Not all&nbsp;future posts will deal with my (to&nbsp;coin Madonna's latest tour) Re-Invention, but rather celebrate life as we only have one life to celebrate - that is, unless I meet a really nice&nbsp;Indian&nbsp;man&nbsp;who converts me to Hinduism &nbsp;:-)&nbsp;   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   &nbsp;

      I am in my office at my desk in my place of employment. My place of employment is a Corporate environment. I work for a real estate company whose sole existence is not to help people live the American dream but to continue to line their inflated wallets with more green. I am not so idealistic that I think I should be working for a company that provides services for nothing, or more socially concious company; but I do wish I worked in a more enjoyable industry. Perhaps something entertainment based.  My office is tastefully decorated with 11'x17" reprints of movie posters I brought in from home. I have occupied this office since July of 1999. My position is of Project Manager in Marketing; which really makes no sense. What's even more ironic is that my projects are few and far between. I have been employed here for 17 years. I left, albiet briefly in 1996 to go to the parent company to further help line their wallets. I was enticed (or is that tricked?) to return to this branch of the corporate family tree in the position of IT Manager. I supported the IT needs, sucessfully I might add, for approximately 100 branches in thr greater NJ/NY/CT Metro area. I performed these duties for 3 years when the evil parent company deemed all IT service and support should be farmed out to IBM. Rather than losing me, my company wished to keep me and transferred me to Marketing. I reiterate it makes no sense, but it's better than being unemployed. I am constantly searching for a better job, but to date, nothing has surfaced. The one interview I did secure was for a Help Desk Manager in Weehawken, NJ. I made some excuse to leave early and went on the interview. Sadly upon my arrival I discovered the interviewee was so disinterested he failed to show up himself. I wonder if I had sent my thank you letter they would have called me back?  I am working on a current project (well not actually working on it today); a multimedia training cd. When I don't have major projects going on I track Market Share, assist others, goof off, surf the web, typical duties of the Corporate employee.  Today all I have done is listen to a few Stepehen Sondheim cd's. Last week I finally went ahead and ordered the major Sondheim cast albums I had been meaning to purchase for years: Follies, A Little Night Music, Anyone Can Whistle and Sunday in the Park....  A Little Night Music is a beautiful score written in 3/4 time, in other words a waltz. Hey, I have to do something to while away the hours. Though I decided this morning I am leaving at 3. Just beacuse. Well actually because I have a couple dangling hours of vacation time and my company instituted a new policy that you cannot record less than 4 hours vacation time in a day; so an HR friend of mine suggested I leave two hours early and let her know and she would adjust the vacation balance. This was two weeks ago she suggested this; so how I haven't left early yet is beyond me. I suppose there are worse situations I could be in; I could be in a romantic relationship with an abusive drug addict.  Monday will bring a new Supervisor, err - sorry, New Vice President and Director of Marketing. Maybe she can help improve the situation. Maybe not. My old VPDofM basically ignored me. It wasn't personal, she had been with the company for over 20 years and lost her fire at least 15 years ago. I was (as were the rest of my department mates) hoping we would be supervisor-less for a longer period of time. We are a pretty well oiled machine, with each of us having very specific responsibilites and from my perspective really don't need supervision. Just someome to occaisionally let us know of new policies and programs. Part of me actually feels sorry for the new VPDofM, I am sure she doesn't realize how heinous this company is, nor how little power she will actually yield. There's zero creativity involved, it's all administrative. I will be supportive, fun, nice, informative and motivated. Ok, basically that means I will be a two faceed brown noser, but hey, whatever it takes right? I don't play the corporate game very well.  I am so bored but at least I only have 30 more minutes left in the day. I should do a lap around the floor and chitchat with some people to help the time pass. I really hate my job.

      Christmas is one of my favorite holidays. Aside from the surplus of food that, in the past, I would consume; my activities are usually filled with getting stoned, watching holiday themed movies and classic specials and generally enjoying the abundant quantity of media related gifts my best buddy Babalu bestows upon me. He really is a great cat.  Shopping online accounts for approximately 95% of the gifts I give to others; I really like to be prepared and pick out what I think is the perfect for the loved ones on my list. Usually by October I have a fairly solid list of people to shop for and a list of items I am thinking of buying. Then I start to do searches, looking for the best deals online; i.e. free shipping, prices, discounts, etc. After placing the order I record the order information in the spreadsheet and save any relevant emails I receive such as order confirmations and shipping notices. This is truly one area my anal retentiveness pays off. As each order is received I cross reference it on the spreadsheet marking it "received"; and store the packages in one closet to be wrapped at a date closer to December 25th.  I consult my Outlook calendar and pick an opportune weekend about 10 days before Christmas and plan my holiday baking. In addition to the typical store bought gifts for the people on my list, I like to provide them with a ample supply of home baked treats. The list of recipients is typically about 20 people long, plus I like to bring in a platter of cookies to work a couple days before Christmas so the baking is pretty extensive. My cookie list is usually typed and checked (and re-checked) at least by the middle of November. At that time I estimate how many batches of each type of cookie I plan to bake, since my list of recipients is fairly lengthy and as I stated I like to provide ample amounts. I make a mean cookie. All butter, high quality chocolates and fruits and nuts....I may have issues of low self esteem, but I am quite confidant when it comes to my talents in the kitchen. I make your standard issue chocolate chip, oatmeal raisin, peanut butter, biscotti, rugelach and at least one or two varieties of shortbread. On top of those I have a fairly lengthy list of recipes I've collected off of various sites for more exotic fair. All in all I make about 14-15 different varieties of cookies and they are all, at the minimum, double batches. I don't get into decorating them, they don't look like traditional Christmas cookies but they taste abso-fucking-lutely awesome and when a couple of each type are combined in a holiday box or tin...well it just screams "I love you!!!!" (as well as "Hi, I'm Frank and I'm an over-achiever!")  In addition to the cookies, last year and in 2001 I made up about 75-80 holiday audio CD's. In 2001 I did a double CD set of holiday music. I give them out to everyone at work, even the people I didn't like (ok, MOST of them I really don't like). I decided, rather late last year (well late for me, it wasn't Thanksgiving yet but I hadn't ordered the jewel cases, the blank CDR's, labels and CD covers) to do a new version of my famous CD. I partially blame Mariah Carey. Her version of "All I Want for Christmas" that was featured in the movie  Love, Actually  inspired me to release a new CD. I also creatively turn the CD into a Christmas card, hand signing each CD on the inside jacket. It sounds like an enormous amount of work, and it is, but since I am perpetually single.....well I have a lot of free time on my hands. I take about a week or two deciding on what songs should be on the CD, illegally downloading them off of Napster (in 2001) and Kazaa (last year); listen to them for quality control, burn the CD's, print the labels and audio covers and spend a coulpe hours in the living room watching some holiday movies while I apply the label and set all 80 copies up. Some get mailed, most are hand delivered about a week before Christmas to all my co-workers. I like seeing the look of genuine surprise on their faces when I give them out, which sometimes turns to delight when they realize what it is and scan the list of tracks. I have a pretty eclectic taste in music but you really can't go wrong in selecting Christmas music....everything goes together nicely whether the tracks are from contemporary artists or artists long dead. I decided last year that that would be the last CD. I think I have covered every song, and certainly what I feel is the best version so unless someone comes out with another instant classic, there's nothing I can do to expand on the concept.  I do a lot at Christmas....I like to. It keeps me busy, I think it's fun, I can spread some joy and happiness; which is something I rarely do and it all leads up to my taking about two weeks off for me to lay around the house in a marijuana induced stupor, in between looking online to have my own stocking stuffed. Good times.  I've already started my shopping but I am having trepidation on my baking ritual this year. Dare I spend a weekend in the kitchen baking until I want to cry feeling the stress and then having the temptation of having all these baked goods in the house. Even when I give them away I keep an unholy and unhealthy supply on hand for myself. I thought about canning salsas this year, or applesauce....something from my kitchen; but I am undecided. Obviously I have plenty of time, but I like to have a plan as well as a plan of attack. Maybe I will do my baking but scale back the assortment as well as the quantity. I don't think I can, in good conscious, give out my treats knowing they are fat laden morsels of heaven. I am pretty confidant I can limit myself in my consumption but the excuse of the "holidays" doesn't justify their potential lethal potency.  Another area I think I need to scale back is going to be what I allow Babalu to buy for me. I am giving him a spending limit of $200 on me and he better not go over that limit. I've been hinting on the Sondheim DVD collection but his attention span is pretty lacking.  I know I am a little early yet, but have a really Merry Christmas and Happy Healthy and Prosperous New Year!  Love Frank and Babalu

      I was born on my Mom's birthday, which means I can never ever use the excuse of forgetting to call or send a card or....well anything. After moving out of my parent's house, they retired to a sleepy little hamlet (that's the poetic way of saying "recession affected hell-hole") in Upstate New York. It's about 260 miles North (by) North West (forgive the Hitchcock reference, I find this entry a little depressing to write and need to amuse myself anyway I can); my father loved to fish and a couple years before they retired he discovered the virtues of salmon fishing. So off they went. I have to admit the first couple years were nice, I obviously love my parents but never really felt connected to them. I know my parents love all their kids but their method of expressing their love was always lost on me. Now, before you think I am a whining baby complaining of "not being loved"; keep reading, because that's not what I am saying. I come from a middle class family with two working parents. They worked their asses off to support their family and make sure we were always dressed, warm and fed. I totally understand how when they would come home from work they just didn't want to deal with their brood of five. Hey, I have one cat and I love him to death but some days I just don't want to deal with him. And he's just a cat - he doesn't deliberately misbehave, fuck up, over eat, whore around, use drugs, get drunk, get in trouble with the law, etc etc etc.  The first few years after they moved away it was pretty cool. I felt the burden of my parents lifted....sure there would be the obligatory "when are you coming to visit" queries but I could deflect them pretty well and get by with visiting maybe once during the summer, Thanksgiving, and maybe Easter. Even during these regularly infrequent visiting years I was still seeing my parents more often then my siblings. Actually one of my brothers passed away in '88 so obviously he is off the hook.  Around Feb/Mar of 2002 we found out my Dad had cancer of the colon and his prognosis was six months. From that point on I was visiting every other weekend. Every other weekend. Aside from the horror and hell of seeing your parent deteriorate on a regular basis, aside from the constant stress of knowing every other week you had to drive 520 miles round trip, aside from feeling you had to keep up a chipper demeanor in front of your parents, aside from having your job eliminated and and go through an interdepartmental transfer not knowing if it was going to be permanent or just pro-longing the inevitable layoff; despite having worked for the same company for 15 years..... The last six weeks my dad was in the hospital, drugged out on pain killers...not even recognizing me, calling me by my brother's name. (I am letting that go, despite the fact I was the one who made the bi-weekly pilgrimage). He passed away on a Friday as I was driving up on a regular bi weekly visit, not quite making six months. When he went I initially thought "well great, now maybe I can get back to a normal life". I think I am still waiting. The next couple of days after my dad's death I was dutiful son/chauffeur driving my mom to the funeral parlor, florists, hospital, whatever errands needed to be run. For a couple months after his death I continued the bi-weekly visits to make sure she was ok and to help in whatever way I could around the house. Typically my last visit of the year is Thanksgiving as I steadfastly refuse to drive that far Upstate New York in the snowy season. Luckily (for me) I get away with it. I start up the visiting season at Easter (I hope you don't find it too ironic that I open and close visiting seasons on holidays that traditionally involve big meals - the truth is my mom isn't a very good cook - though I do prefer her turkey and stuffing to mine).  This year I haven't visited as much....I have been too involved with myself and my working out. I am still the only surviving child who visits regularly and frankly it's so fucking unfair. I call regularly on Sundays and when I told her last weekend that I would be coming up on Friday and leaving on Saturday (not unusual for me to only spend one night) she suddenly sounded 30 years older than her 72 years and replied "you aren't staying through Sunday?" I bit my lip and simply reminded her that I usually only stay over one night but was just going to make my visit a day earlier....which seemed to either appease her or just shut her up. Either way, a "win".  I love my mom, but the truth is she is a Fox News channel watching right wing racist. Politically we agree on nothing. I hear epithets constantly about the blacks (I have heard the word "nigger" more times than I care to) , welfare, the Democrats (which I am one), and her favorite since '92 - "that goddamn Clinton". I guess it isn't enough for her that he is no longer our President. Sadly she loves Bush and loathes anyone who would dare contradict him.  I, on the other (left) hand; favor liberalism and democracy, Michael Moore, Hillary Clinton, John Edwards (Kerry doesn't do much for me) and have a passionate dislike for the man who currently resides at 1300 Pennsylvania Avenue (I dare not utter his name). You know who I mean, the one who lives there, not because he was elected but because his brother refused to enforce the Constitution which states all votes should be counted. But I digress....  My visit this weekend was filled with anti McGreevey-isms (she actually used the term "that homo"....doesn't she remember the time 18 years ago when my dad found gay porn in my bedroom???? Again, I digress, that's another blog entry entirely); I try to remind her that McGreevey is really none of her business, as she lives in New York. Driving home I could only hope that she will go quickly, when she does go....  I don't think I could bear having to go through losing another parent as slowly as my dad. I know that sounds horrible....but maybe when it's her time she can just go peacefully in her sleep. I will weep when she goes, but I know some of the tears will be from the freedom of responsibility, which will only bring guilt and then.....more tears.  You can't help but love your parents; they sacrificed for you and there is a feeling of appreciation and respect that comes along with that. But you don't have to be friends with your parents; I mean, it'd be nice.....but it's not a requirement. But you do have to accept them and their faults, as they, in turn..accept yours.

      The very gifted comedy writer/actress Carrie Fisher, in the screenplay adaptation of her bestselling novel  Postcards From the Edge  wrote an exchange between Meryl Streep and Rob Reiner. The semi-autobiographical storyline is about an actress fresh out of rehab trying to get her life back on track by jumping into a new film, hoping it will ground her and get her through some unsteady times. On her second day of filming as she is walking to and from the set she is approached by numerous studio execs who are gently criticizing her already fragile ego as they have just seen the dailies and don't feel she is giving her best. Along the way she meets one of the producers, played by Rob Reiner*, who tells her that it's a comedy rule to punch up the joke by raising the pitch of your voice on the last word of the line. So she responds by deadpanning "That's a comedy   rule  ?" Funny and subtle, it plays nicely on screen. On paper it's not funny, it's just sounds stupid.  I mention this because very often I am mis-read in my writing in chats or emails. I think I am coming across as too abrasive, obnoxious, sarcastic and not very nice. Words are powerful tools, there's no debating this. My mind sometimes works at a feverish pace always trying to think of witty things to say. But what I neglect to think about is how I am being interpreted. You can only type so many inflections in an email or chat, and it's far too easy to read emotion, or in my case, the wrong emotion into what is being written.  It would be easy for me to say that the people who are misreading me are idiots, of course, that also wouldn't be very nice. So rather than be stubborn and and bullheaded I think I would like to accept accountability on this issue and proclaim my intent to know my audience and write to their level of comprehension. That sounds far more arrogant then I intended it to, but essentially it's what I need to do. Perhaps I can just incorporate this into the whole "Re-Invention" plan, why not attempt to improve my social & writing skills along with my physical being.....well I can and will make the attempt. That's all I can do, if I don't succeed immediately; I know I will eventually. I just hope I don't drive more people away (well   some   of them can go away, that wouldn't be the end of the world) ; but certainly not the ones who matter.  On a related sidenote,  Postcards from the Edge  is a solid 4 star movie. Directed by Mike Nichols with a powerhouse cast including the aforementioned Meryl Streep, Shirley MacLaine, Gene Hackman, Dennis Quaid, Rob Reiner, Oliver Platt, Mary Wickes, Conrad Bain, Annette Bening and Richard Dreyfuss; it's a very funny movie that could have been very unfunny. Suicide, drug overdose, parental abuse and career woes wouldn't, on the surface, seem to be the stuff great comedy is made from but with this cast and Nichols assured direction.....it is. If that weren't enough, for a non-musical,  Postcards from the Edge  features not one, but two show stopping musical numbers. One of which is a slightly re-written (by the composer himself) version of Stephen Sondheim's "I'm Still Here", originally written for his 1973 show "Follies". If you've been keeping tabs on this blog, not that I think anyone is particularly interested, you'd know that I am, if nothing else, a huge fan of Stephen Sondheim. If you've never seen it, you could do far worse then checking out  Postcards from the Edge . If you have seen it, see it again; it's worth multiple viewing.    *Can't be 100% sure it was Rob Reiner at this point, it could have been Oliver Platt.

      Ok, not quite....at least not yet. But, this weekend pretty much marked the first month of working out and I swear I see some changes in the area known as the "biceps". They aren't exactly what one would refer to as "guns" at this point, I mean, there certainly are no "peaks" as of yet, but what I did see certainly gives me hope for the future.  I couldn't help but roll up the sleeves to my t-shirt today and flexed them every now and then. I kept craning my head to try to get a side view (yes I realize standing in front of the mirror would have made that task easier, but I was pretty much sacked out on the couch all day watching Stephen King's The Stand on dvd and didn't feel much like getting up).  I also kept flexing for Babalu, my domestic (cat) partner; however he remains unimpressed. I think he's just still envious over the lack of posable thumbs.  On the lighter side of the news, I was chatting up with a 29 year old gentleman this evening and he was digging me. He wanted to meet me in person tonight. Except things went awry when I disclosed my present weight; 310 according to my scale this morning, which brings the total loss to 80 pounds since April. Only 60 more to go until Jose Fuentes, my personal trainer, will start to really build me a better, more muscular body. I am not the least bit upset over the turn of events with this younger fellow; he was cute, but it's always an iffy sell until I present all information. It did confirm two of my theories however: 1) Men are scum and shallow (which I admit I am too, I mean, and I am ashamed to say this, I wouldn't be interested in a 310 pound man). And 2) I have such a great, witty, fun personality. I know I was charming the pants off him until.....well, you know...   The Disclosure        Just a few more months and this whole ugliness will be behind me.     You can do it   All you need is a hand   We can do it   Mama is gonna see to it      Curtin up!   Light the lights!   You've got nothing to hit    But the heights!   Blow a kiss   Take a bow   And nothings gonna stop us   Till we're through!      Honey, Everything's comin' up roses!   For me, and for You!

      For the past year I have been a premium subscriber to Match.com.  During that year I have received two emails a week showing profile basics of up to 20 Match.com members.  The percent "match" has ranged from 100% to 50%, yet when I look a little closer at their profiles the reality sees to be even lower, i.e. they are looking for "Athletic and Toned" matches (I'm working on it).  During the past year I have sent out "winks" or emails to guys whose pics and profiles I have been interested in....but for some strange reason I never hear back from them.  Now I have not been completely unsuccessful in my attempt at finding love through Match.com; last year, shortly after I registered and placed my ad I did hear from a local gentleman who said he was interested.  Rob and I met on the Friday night before Labor Day weekend, he was nice, decent looking, good job, stable and we shared some similar interests.  We went out a few times and I had him over to my place on more than one occasion for dinner and or a movie.  But he never seemed interested in sex.  That was ok with me; I mean sex is good....real good in fact, but I want intellectually to have a connection with my significant other as much as, perhaps more than a sexual connection.  Anyone can satisfy me sexually (well, within reason) but intellectually I need to be stimulated as well, and isn't that more important?  Things were going ok, I guess until sometime around the end of September he just stopped returning my calls.......  More recently I received an email from a gentleman in Maryland who found my picture and profile to be the answer to his dreams.   I replied in earnest, inquiring why he would be singling me out when I live about 3-4 hours from him.....but I told him I was game if he was.  A month later he replied.  We chatted one evening on AOL and I impulsively asked him if he'd like to go to dinner, near him; I thought hey it's time for me to have an adventure.  He agreed on a Wednesday night.  However on Thursday he indicated that the upcoming weekend wouldn't be good.   I sensed he had second thoughts.  We chatted a few more times but mostly after exchanging a few pleasantries he would say he was really busy and had to work.  Ok.....whatever.  I had wanted to say "Hey buddy, YOU initially contacted ME, if you aren't interested then FINE.....but just come out and say it."  But due to my amazingly well bred upbringing, I refused to allow myself to say that.  Instead I just deleted him from my buddy list and wouldn't you know.....it solved the problem.  I couldn't tell he was online because he never contacted me again.  About six months ago I signed up with Gay.com.  At first I thought, "Cool" - a lot more members than AOL and more chat rooms.  Upon closer inspection I came to realize that they were essentially the same guys from AOL I have been seeing online over and over again.  The one plus Gay.com has is a plethora of fake user ids; all who seemed to want to chat with me and have me visit their web cam site....for a price I am sure.  As of today I have dropped both Match.com and Gay.com from my personal payroll.  I don't need to be paying extra money to sites with gay members who will reject me when I can stay connected to AO-Hell and be rejected by some of NJ and NY's finest gay men.  I am not ceasing my quest for a lifemate, I think rather I am discontinuing my quest online....for now.

      My last post detailed two recent incidents in where I was stood up. After very careful consideration I am beginning to think that perhaps this has been due tot he laws of karma. The cause and effect of actions.  I have never,   ever   stood someone up, technically speaking. I find dating far too much fun, the whole concept of meeting someone face-to-face for the first time is an incredibly delicious feeling that I really like. I won't repeat my earlier post, just suffice to say I really really really like dating. However, on more than one occasion I have found myself chatting online with a guy, it's obvious from the get go that dating is not what they are after. Not to state the obvious, but they are looking for a hookup. Again, I don't wish to repeat earlier posts, but if you are new to the inner recesses of how I think and operate - hookups are fine. Every single person, gay, straight or bi needs a hookup now and then to remind them of what they are missing on a regular basis so that they will continue to seek out one of life's most treasured gifts. A partner. Anyway, to get back to my point, hookups are good thing.  When I find myself chatting with a guy who wants to hookup it inevitable is an inconvenient time. Perhaps it's an hour before I need to go to bed, or I am about to run out to run errands or I already have plans with a friend...it could be any number of reasons. But nevertheless the chat continues and it becomes more sexual, discussing the various possibilities of what the chattee and I could be doing. Most of the time they are happy to defer said activities to a mutually convenient time where the both of us are available. Sometimes not; sometimes it's a deal killer and we will never be able to recapture what could have been. The chattees in the former group though that agree to meet at a later time I have, in the past, perhaps mistreated. I don't feel as though I can accept total blame since I find it difficult to plan on being horny and eager at a said time in the near future.  Think about it, on Monday night at 11:30pm, say you are chatting with someone who, at that particular time, is fueling your heating core. At 11:30pm on Monday night you definitely want to be with him; but you have to get up for work the next morning so you tell him you can't do anything about it now. We may agree to meet up on Tuesday at 8pm. Tuesday night rolls around and frankly, you aren't really in the mood....maybe you had a long strenuous day and the thought of getting sexually active with someone you have never met isn't really a turn on at that point. Or perhaps on Tuesday afternoon you received a call from a friend who really wants to see the new Wil Smith movie... There could be a thousand reasons why on Tuesday you just don't want to be with someone. I don't consider this standing someone up or blowing them off. I always make a point to tell the chattee that it's best if we meet up online first. I tell them if I am online then I will definitely be looking, but they may tell me they won't have access to a PC at that time. They may ask me to call or I may have given them my number, and if they call...or rather if my phone rings, I may ignore it and not pick up. I know this behavior is wrong, and childish, but that's basically what happens sometimes. What sounded good one day isn't as appealing the next or the day after and then oddly enough a couple days later it can do a complete turnaround and become appealing again. So herein lies my problem. And make no mistake it is  my  problem.  Effective immediately I am instituting a new policy on dating and hookups. Each category will have it's own rules and procedures which I expect to be followed closely within the following guidelines. I should point out now that said procedures, which are being posted below, are subject to change at the discretion of the Management.   Hook Ups  Effective immediately any trolling for hookups will be conducted only on the weekend and when an appropriate window of time is available. It is no longer acceptable to "plan" on meeting a potential hookup at a later date since I cannot be depended upon to keep an appointment.  Hookups in general, should be reduced to a minimum.   Dating  Effective immediately, any potential dates must engage in online or phone chat at a minimum of five separate occasions before I agree to meet them in person. This procedure alone will be certain to weed out those who are insincere in establishing a relationship while at the same time allow each of us to get to know each other; making our first meeting that much more enjoyable.  ====================  So perhaps I am at fault in the recent incidents of being stood up. Perhaps karma is getting me back for my previous reprehensible behavior, or perhaps the two gentlemen were anything but...I can't say for sure. I can't answer for their bad behavior but I can answer for my own. I am cleaning up my act on a physical level, it's time for me to do the same on a mental level.  The road ahead may very well turn out to be a lonely stretch of highway filled with potholes and bad signage but if I can get there unscathed I know I will be ok.
