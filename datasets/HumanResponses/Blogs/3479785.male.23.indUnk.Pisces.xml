      So last weekend I managed to get this in.  This water garden addition is 8' by 8' by 2 feet deep.  I managed to dig this out by hand, place the liner, lay 3/4 of a ton of limestone, 1/4 ton of sand, and fill it with 910 gallons of water that were being pumped by a fountain head in under 12 hours. I broke two shovels in the process.  Not too shabby eh? lol  I love this thing, I even dyed the water blue.  I will take more pictures this weekend as I have added some solar powered lights.  I also need to finish creating the waterfall for this particular puddle.  I still have to wait another 2 weeks before I can place fish or plants in it, I'm getting impatient. :-p  I just hope I have a little time to do this stuff considering all the other things I need to do with finals week being next week. :-s     urlLink     My Father's Job Site Inspector Checking to Make Sure There Are No Building Violations    urlLink     The Finished Lake w/o Optional Landscaping

      Never thought I'd find myself here.  I used to think blogs were for those with weak containers for their thoughts...Then I looked upon the pad and pen I kept at my desk for writing my thoughts down on paper.  What's the difference, really?  My pen and paper are totally private...Then again, so is the internet "blog" where nobody really knows me, right?  Well, this is enough for a test post, I think, lol.

      Trust, where is it, what does it really mean anymore?  It seems the more progress we make as a species, the more humanity we take from ourselves.  The days when a man's word was his bond, and a handshake was as good as signing a dotted line are long gone. Say hello to the wary eye and shaking hand, shoving stacks of paper towards you to sign.  When they say you sign your life away, they aren't kidding are they?  Then we dig into the personal faucets of the word "trust".  Is it truly necessary to physically "see" a person before handing them trust?  How about if you've known them for almost a year?  It seems these days, that trust is a very rare commodity.  The crumbling ethics of a rapidly decaying American society and the morals that are now becoming extinct are contributors to this, no doubt.  American society, when placed side-by-side with any other society, is rapidly becoming one of the most primal and undignified social units in the world.    Keep in mind that we aren't talking politics, ethnicity, religion, or race. There is nothing here about which nation is more superior, or bad mouthing about this country as a nation. I'm just talking sociology and psychology, human behavior as a country amongst ourselves.    There are people telling me that we are untrustworthy and lacking in our morals, and these same people come from countries with corrupt governments with easily bribed officials and law enforcement employees!  When I stated this to a fellow student, the explanation was simply that people still trust other people in those countries. Though the government is corrupt, the society has high standards of interaction and a social ladder of respect.  Whereas here in America, we don't like those constraints that come with a pecking order, we make our own.    So perhaps the roots of our modern society's gradually worsening untrustworthy nature stems from the inadequate social climes we, as a "free society", have created for ourselves.    New York City is a perfect sociological stage for the viewing of a sub-standard social pecking order.  However far "in your face" you can get with somebody, the more authority, or social ranking, you have over them.  The principles of age, wealth, or status matter very little in this society.  If you can push hard, act hard, talk trash, walk fast, and avoid eye contact, then you too can be considered the upper crust of this particular microcosm of a society. Keep moving, keep quiet, and you may go unnoticed, just pray you don't accidentally walk into somebody.    Are there feelings of animosity amongst these people? You betcha!  Do people really act so tough there?  They better if they hope to get to work on time.  There's no roses to stop and smell here!   "So what's your point, where are you taking this?!"   Well, think about it. We have competition in an everyday social order, animosity towards others...A general feeling of needing to be better than the next person.  So what do we do?  Gossip, tell Joe about latest and greatest job promotion (except you make it sound better than it really was, going from pencil sharpener to paper pusher), telling that good-looking someone about just how powerful and influential you are(he/she will never know you got fired yesterday), telling friends that you managed to nab a date with prior said someone (though he/she completely blew you off on your random encounter after 5 minutes, but who was counting, right), or maybe you tell your neighbor that your Johnny is so intelligent for a child his age (did you forget how you yelled at him for failing his spelling test three minutes ago).  So here we have this awesome ego trip that needs fulfilled in some way, so we try to make it a "mine is better than yours" situation.  ......To Be Continued
