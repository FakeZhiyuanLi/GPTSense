       Please Go To:  urlLink http://www.freedonation.com/children/    "Every year, over 12 million young children die before reaching their fifth birthday, many perish during their first year of life. To put this number into perspective, one child dies before their fifth birthday approximately every 2.6 seconds, or almost 33,000 per day. What is really terrible is that most of these deaths are not caused by starvation or natural disasters - most of these children are dying because of a few diseases and conditions that are preventable or curable for mere pennies.

       Yesterday was tiring, but today was a blast! I hung out with Kristine, Christina, Kiet, Tony, Quyen, Peter, and Chi Jennifer @ the Santa Monica beach.  1. Kristine, Christina, and I were silly. We&nbsp;laughed so much. They are awesome!! Screaming and being crazy was fun.&nbsp;Kristine made a funny sand castle. Tina bought a chicken toy.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. Kiet and I went&nbsp;too far in the ocean. The lifeguard told us to swim back in. I was trying to swim back in, but the current kept pushing me further back.&nbsp;The lifeguard helped me. Now, I can tell my children, I was saved by a lifeguard :-P Kiet&nbsp;had some mad tricks :-D and he can rap! 3. Quyen gave Tony a basketball. He's into photography--- really cool. Tony was funny when he had to change out of his bathing suit. He was a good boy today :-) 4. Chi Jennifer and Peter were nice!! They are good drivers. &nbsp; ******************************* 5. I got to&nbsp;eat thai food w/my cool cousin Chi Hue and close friend Rachelle. Rachelle is a fun gal and incredible dancer. Chi Hue is so sweet-- gentlemen, she is a good looking woman and has a great personality.  6. Kiet, Hue, and I went shopping. It's been over a year since I went to Big-K. Inexpensive stuff, but I don't recommend the food they sell. &nbsp; well, I'm exhausted... take care. later &nbsp;

       What happened to generosity? altruism? philanthropy?&nbsp;It seems like so many people are apathetic when it does not concern their welfare.&nbsp;I can't stand it. I want more people to visit sites like  urlLink www.freedonation.com/hunger/ &nbsp;and  urlLink http://www.feedthechildren.org/ &nbsp;&nbsp;and  urlLink http://www.wvi.org/ &nbsp;and  urlLink http://www.give.org/  . It would be great if more people donated money to such great causes, but there are&nbsp;plenty of other ways to help!!&nbsp;It's important for&nbsp;us to care!!&nbsp;However, it is not my choice. It is yours. Please visit those sites to help&nbsp;end hunger & poverty,&nbsp;promote education, support&nbsp;art,&nbsp;protect the environment & animals, preserve our land, and much much more. We can all help!! Take action! &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

       Please visit  urlLink http://members.asianavenue.com/Helping-Ling  Please Read what it has to say. There are times when I'm skeptical about whether a person is sincere. You might not want to donate money because you aren't certain where the money is going, but look at it differently. I came across that web page by chance, and instead of ignoring it, I'm going to do something. Without people like us to help one another, what state will our world be in? Knowing that the gift I gave out was intended for a good cause is ample reason for me. Please hurry, Ling does not have much time. They need the money by Wednesday, September 1st, 2004; please send it at as soon as possible because it would take at least 2 days (Monday, August 30, 2004) for your donation to get to New York.

       Facts and Statistics on Cancer from   urlLink http://www.freedonation.com/cancer/cancer_stats.php3  *please note I did not write the following, I only highlighted some key phrases  Life with cancer is a challenge that is met by each patient in his or her own way. Cancer, while a terrible disease in itself, is not and  should not be viewed as a death sentence . Most cancers are controllable with the correct treatment. Some can even be cured. The  key is to never give up .  Cancer represents a group of  more than 100 diseases affecting parts of the human body  from the brain to the bones. The human body is composed of individual cells that work together to form organs such as the lungs. Normally, cells will grow, divide and then die - simply fulfilling its life cycle. However, in certain situations, abnormal cells do not die after they divide. With this new-found immortality, these  cells grow out of control ,  starving the body of crucial nutrients and resources  in the process.  Our knowledge of cancer is incomplete. There still exists many important questions that must be answered before we can achieve victory against this terrible disease. However, with broadly-coordinated research in recent years,  there is hope  for the cancer patient if the disease is caught early, before the cancer spreads to many parts of the body, in a process called  metastasis .  Cancer is one of the most  prolific killers in existence . According to the American Cancer Society, about  560,000 people will die  from cancer in the United States alone in 2000, or  more than 1,500 a day . Since 1990, almost  5 million  people have lost their lives due to the effects of this disease. In 2000, about 1 .22 million new cancer cases  are expected to be diagnosed. The current  5-year relative survival rate  for all cancers combined is only about  60% .  Do you have a friend or a loved one who did battle against cancer? Can you remember their struggle with this disease? Take a stand today and make a free donation for cancer research @  urlLink http://www.freedonation.com/cancer/ . The defeat of cancer is a lofty goal but together, we can make a difference.

       I absolutely enjoy reading. Knowledge is essential. I read for my pleasure. Articles on humanity. Fantasy books. Stories that emphasizes morals and values. Autobiographies about struggle and accomplisments. Texts filled with scientific and historic facts.  A few quotes of mine; I said I would post. You might not agree, and that is all right. My friend Amy Lee wrote "Unity Through Diversity"  Crying is not a weakness. Losing faith in yourself is a vulnerability.  Relinquish all indolence and you shall find vigor. *how the freak do you do that? well, don't question me. question yourself :-P  It is immodest to use profanity.

       Facts and Statistics from  urlLink http://www.freedonation.com/edu/edu_stats.php3                  The process of learning new ideas, of acquiring skills necessary for success in our fast-paced world of today, is otherwise known as education.          Yet, despite its obvious benefits, a formal education is  not universally accessible   to every child, every man, every woman . No,  education has been and remains a luxury , a luxury often unattainable for those occupying disadvantaged stations in life.          The total number of people in the world 15 years and over who are illiterate was  over 885 million  in 1995. This figure representated  22.6  percent of the worldwide population, or more than  one in five people . Out of the 885 million, 320 million were male while 565 million were female. In other words, 16.4 percent of the world's male population are illiterate while 28.8 percent of the world's female population are illiterate. Fortunately, recent studies are showing that the gender gap is gradually closing.             Over 130 million children , mostly girls, have  no access to education  on the primary school level. In developing countries, 25% of all children entering schools are expected to drop out before completing a primary education.          The difference in literacy rates between the developed countries and the undeveloped countries are quite dramatic to say the least. Overall, only 1.3 percent of the population in the most developed countries are illiterate while  51.2  percent, or  over half of the general population in the least developed countries could not read or write.           In general, the level of education in the world has been  rising  in the past twenty years. However, an enormous disparity still exists between the rich and poor. Take the United State as an example. In 1969, only 69 percent of the total American adult population had completed high school and the percentage of people seeking higher education via a four-year college degree was only 17%. In 1997, over 82 percent of the adult population in the United States had completed high school and the percentage with a college degree had risen to 24 percent.          A country on the opposite end of the wealth spectrum is Ethiopia. In 1970, the gross enrollment ratio had been only  0.2 percent . Almost thirty years later, the enrollment stands at 0.7 percent, a gain of only 0.5 percent (in the absolute sense) over three decades. With little money to spend on educational expenditures such as more teachers and supplies (i.e. pencils),  poverty and the lack of education conspire to become a vicious cycle  in which a child is born in poverty, receives  no access to adequate education  and as a result,  can not acquire the skills they need to break out of poverty  as an adult - thereby starting a new iteration of the cycle with the next generation.          A good educational environment must be free from danger. Yet, crime and violence seems to h ave slowly infiltrated schools everywhere. According to recent studies, up to 10 percent of 1992 American high school seniors reported that they did not feel safe at school and over 23% reported school  fights between different ethnic/racial groups . With the recent  wave of school shootings , student confidence in the safety of the educational environment are at a  low point .             Education is one of the most important keys to the success of humanity  as we march into the new millennium. Our goal should be a world where everyone, even the most disadvantaged, receive adequate education to prepare them for a productive life.
