      WHY?!?!   A condo cost as much as a small house on long Island. A decent sized apartment cost as much per month as a mortgage.  I rent the upstairs of my parents house. I don't pay them alot of rent...not alot compared to what rent prices are on Long Island. But at least I can save a down payment for that condo or town house I would love to have.  But, it'll be a while. In order to get an afordable mortgage, I need a BIG down payment. Once that part is done I can get the condo, get a room mate, and charge them half the amount of the mortgage.  Get a room mate...  Yeah, 36 and single. There's a story behind that. I was once engaged. I was 23 she was 20. Samantha wasn't very nice, very jealous, very demanding, full of twisted thoughts and ideas and very beautiful. I was very giving, very trusting, I had a big heart. She came from a torn family. Her parents divorced when she was young. Both of them re-married. Both her step parents had kids of thier own. She lived with her mother and step father, her step brother, and her real sister, Adriene. That's how I met her, through her sister. Adriene and I were good friends in high school and still are to this day. After high school I joined the army. When I came back 3 years later little Samantha had grown up. And all that kidding around when we were younger turned into flirting and then love.  She broke my heart.   I was ruined, mentaly, for a long time. It's obvious that it still haunts me. All the time I invested to make a good relationship, to make her happy... that's all that I wanted to do, make HER happy. In order to do that I had to give up what made me happy.  Happiness?  I had gone to school for radio after my active duty service, that was in '89. The school was supposed to place me, for internship, at a radio station. Samantha wanted to get married, interning doesn't make any money. So instead, I worked at a DJ company in New Jersey on the weekends, was still in the National Gaurd one weekend a month, worked for my best friends dad full time for a while and was in a deli at night durring the week. That killed alot of time and Sam and I really didn't get to see too much of each other. She suggested I work for her uncle, who owned a trucking brokerage. That was in '91. (One of her uncles is just as big of a mental case as she was, but that's a story for another time.) I gave up one of my biggest dreams for her... 1) the army - acomplished. 2) to be in radio - put on hold. We first broke up in '92, a couple of months before the wedding. Was on and off for about a year after that. And it wasn't until I was 26 that I had the mind to start seeing another girl. I left her uncles place and worked at a trucking company for 2 years until I decided that I need to try to get into radio. In July of '96 I achieved my second liflong dream.  Happiness was back...  (to be continued)
