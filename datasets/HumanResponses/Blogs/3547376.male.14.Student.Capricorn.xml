       I really want my brothers mobile phone (his old one) & I want it now! I am sick of waiting. He hasn't even agreed to swapping. He better or I will be so pissed off. I feel I'm about to explode! I really want it now, or at least know that I'm going to get it. He annoys me so much. He doesn't even use it, he has a brand new one & his excuse is "i payed for this phone". Mind you, he bought it off my mum for $100 a year ago (the phone was worth about $400 then). He just annoys me so badly.  Sorry, but I had to get it off my chest. Anyway, this is MY blogg. I'm listening to HIM at the moment. They are the best. I just realised that in some of the songs they have subliminal messages. Like in one it was telling you to kill yourself. He wasn't singing it, but the really soft voice in the background & the words he songed made you think of killing yourself because "this life isn't worth living"... Sorry, had to write that also...

       Its been a while since my last post. I've been busy with homework & assignments from school, working on my website & just the usual things I do. But I have some free time on my hands now & I also have holidays comming up, so lots of posts should end up here soon...  Have updated my website, somewhat & have had some new ideas too, but I will write them later. Ha! My cat is sitting with me & I am paying all my attention to the computer (writing this) & she is getting jelious. I love my cat so much!  Anyway, about my lovelife... There is this girl in Yr. 8 that I am interested in. She isn't interested in me & I haven't made a move or anything yet. I don't think I have a chance with her. Also, I had to tell my good friend in Yr. 11 last night that I didn't like her anymore than a friend. It was hard to tell her that, I know she is heartbroken. But I had to tell her. I feel so bad about it. To make it worse, my "best friend" is going off at me & calling me a fagot & shamming me because I told her. Her excuse for it was "I lead her on...", which I didn't. I tried to develop feelings for her, but I never did. It's not my fault I don't like her in that way...  Enough of that. I just don't understand people. Life is so hard. I don't think I can live with it anymore. Once again, I am having sucidal thoughts. Another thing that makes me even more stressed, is that I listen to everyone elses problems, but I bottle all mine up. I don't anyone about what goes on inside my head. I feel as if I am going to explode. I am ill. Mentally ill...

       Welcome to my journal. My name is BeauW. I live in Australia & am fourteen years old. I have many friends, but only a few. I spend most of my free time on the internet. I like designing websites & advertising (banners, awards & posters).  I am currently working on a new website at MSN Groups. It is called Dark.Shadows ( urlLink Click here ). If your interested in dark culture & lifestyle, music, writings & dark communities, then take a look at Dark.Shadows.  I am also interested in music (mostly darkwave, gothic, metal, rock & punk rock), art, writing. computers & internet. When I leave school, I want to go to University & study Graphic Art (Commercial Art) or something in the music industry.  As a teenager of fourteen years, I lead a sad, depressing life. Which may explain why I am gothic. I have been in the gothic scene for only a few months now. I like dark, gloomy, creepy stuff like cofins, vampyres, spiders, spider webs, castles, death, ghosts & all that other stuff.  One reason my life is so sad & depressing is because of a secret I have carried on my sholders since I was twelve. A secret I find disturbing & shaking. I lead two lives because of this. One is a lie, which I reveal to everyone. My family & friends. The other can only be revealed to myself as no one know's. I can only reveal this life behing closed doors, away from the human eye.  What I find most shaking about this secret is that I have to reveal it to someone, soon. I cannot keep it inside of me for much longer. Everyday brings me closer to a mental breakdown. This is something else that no one know's.  I shall continue in my next post ...
