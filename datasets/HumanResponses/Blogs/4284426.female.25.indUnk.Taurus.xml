        I went to see the Exorcist last night with C.P, the movie was better than what I thought it would be. After the movie we went to get some food and drinks.

         Why are people afraid of sexuality yet desire it, but always want to publicly condemn it? Sex is beautiful. Sex is natural. Sex is fun. Sex is the process of continuing life. Sex is necessary. Sex is a stress reliever. Sex is love not war. Sex, we all have  it at some point.

         Who would dream of Nights summer ones down long highways With destinations ahead and goings left behind  My soul lives in moments stolen by time and long summer nights gone by  But I will scent mine with the most crucial honey-scent dipped in towers of loyalty built by and for royalty  Songs are written about its addiction lyric filled sweets We play you loud and cover our bodies with its sweet sweet temptation  It's been in my life Brown Sugar won't you stay and be like the day and not the night

        I hate fake things!!! Including flowers, people, smiles, responses. Why be fake? So many people put too much effort into being fake, when it would be a lot easier just to be themselves.I once had a fake friend.Won't name any names, A.S. (A.K.A Asshole Skank)

       Candi Bar   [Intro] She looks like a (4x)  [Chorus - repeat 4x] {*ad libs through out*} She looks like a movie star Like a chocolate candy bar  [Verse] (She looks like a) Heya love love, you little fly lady bug Come and swing this episode wit more from up above With them Earl Jeans on fitting tight like a glove You little Cinammon Toast Crunch, come show me some love! Slim goodie got tittle litties Yeah but she's a picture post card pretty fat kitty little bitty, WHOO!! You're provoking me, giving me the notions To make me wanna lick your funky emotions She can make a crippled man walk and a blind man see How can I put this? hmm She can make the Grinch love Christmas How can I manifest her uniqueness in vernacular? (Like a chocolate candi bar) yeah that describes her  [Chorus]  [Verse] (She looks like a) I seen her at the park on the black top watching the kids play Hey style complimented the sunny day There's a mild nature about her Gentle but firm for all the bullshit life brought her way You reflected beauty of a starless night by far Like Billy Joel said "I take you just the way you are!" I had a crush on you since the days of love tap Karate shoes you had jelly cornrows with the peas in the back I knew you'd grow to be a fine specimen someday You the very inspiration for the song I sing The way you sprint the runway and scale the catwalk Your life is a movie and the camera's never off It's like love at first taste, coming deep from within From your DNA structure to your whole body ova Your beauty is respected in the eye of the beholder I love that little chocolate bar tattered on your shoulder  [Chorus]  [Verse] (She looks like a) Oh yeah the time is now and the place is here So come a little closer let me kick it in your ear And share this wit you girl you super official I just wanna bite you girl you look good like a Snickers Ooh la la, ah wee wee, walking by looking all like I exctasy Got doe ma didn't know, good gracious alive! Aw shuck now, there she go Hey yo come and rest your feet my little chocolate soufflet I know you're tired you been running through my mind all day And Oh My Goodness! can I get a witness? This roundy brownie is something to see I never had a craving like this before, I'm addicted Lord have mercy! please give me strength! Dark, rich and thick like a fresh baked cake Just thinking of your shape girl I catch a tooth ache  [Chorus]  [Outro] (She looks like a) We just buggin out a little bit, showing versatility  (to fade)

        At 25 I think my life is the sexiest it's ever been. Mainly because I'm the sexiest I've ever been in my own skin. Growing up slim and tall, I have always been a little awkward when cast into the spot lite. But now, I just take it for what it is. If I'm going to get attention regardless, I might as well make it work to my advantage. I've always had a sexual manner about me, I just didn't know how to use it. I think of it now as a fine wine mixed with my mystique, curiosity, and element of surprise. I'm not afraid to use my sex appeal, and don't apologize for it. And every scar I have, I earned and paid for it.
