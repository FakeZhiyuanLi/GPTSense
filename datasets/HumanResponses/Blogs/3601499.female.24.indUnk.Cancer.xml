      why do i question. why do i want to know why i exist? i torment myself with questions and what if's all the time. i really should be sedated and locked inside a padded room for my protection as well as yours.   i am fake. i have so many sides of me that most people only know me by that one side i've chosen to show them. i can be that very nice person that works really hard, listens, cares, and really interested in change and doing something right. other times, i'd can be that whore, an alcoholic, the girl that will not hesitate to stab you to death, and a&nbsp;selfish bitch.&nbsp;its really hard to keep myself between my urdges to be good and my urdges just to f*k everything to hell.  i don' t see myself with degrees, community service awards, a role model, a person with a big, bright future in front of her as much as i see myself as a&nbsp;whore on sunset with a drug i.v. in my arm, sniffing cocaine with a bottle of Jack. its sad but i'd much rather just not care about what other people expect of me. i am tired of "pretending" to be someone i am not.   i have "baggage." i don't trust anyone. i never get close to anyone because i know they will go away, even my family.&nbsp;i am very angry. i have been to a dark place. i have been at the edge of cliff and i have jumped. i am often disappointed in myself. i have one wish and it hasn't come true yet. i hate waiting.   there was once a time when i tried to vent my emotions only to hurt my mom with my words. it took me nearly a decade to write again.&nbsp;i believe anything that is written or typed is meant to be read and not hidden away. for years i kept my thoughts to myself only to know that i am strange and a bit scary for 'normal' people. i have thoughts no other people think or express openly. i know when to be quiet and keep my thoughts to myself because they do frighten others.  i know people aren't happy all the time, i know everybody's life, even though how sweet on the outside it may seem, may not be. i know i have had great luck with family, friends, and achievements but no matter what, i am never satisified. i will always feel i am behind. after years of thinking of the roots of my mental illness, i have come to two conclusions. one is the whole abandonment issue and the other i realized once with some help of a stranger but i don' t try not to think about; i will never admit what it is to another person. i am a girl with issues.  sometimes i am ambitious. i will take the leadership role and improve it 500% over. i will take and make new. i laugh and have fun. i smile and the world is sometimes bright, not all my days are dark but there is a storm cloud that hovers. i had a good childhood. not until i was officially a teenager did i experience a piece of what i live now. there are a few major changes in my life, first when i was 13.&nbsp;then 18, when i was&nbsp;20 and&nbsp;21. unfortunately they are not what you think. these years should be marked as academic milestones for myself but unfortunately they have different associations with them.  most days all i want to do is scream and just fly away. i have so many voices shouting at me all the time i get headaches. its hard knowing that i can't keep everything in total control. this is why i disappear for days at a time. i understand&nbsp;people get worried sometimes. believe me i do this as discreetly as i can.&nbsp;&nbsp;i just need time alone.&nbsp;  i have tried for more moments than moments&nbsp;i have&nbsp;given up. its scary to try because i have to face reality and consequences. its also scary to give up. i don't want to find myself giving up again but i also don't to try anymore. i think the worse is giving up then having to face to trying again. i.e. i'd rather be drunk than sober and hungover, i'd rather be high on drugs than sober and going through withdrawal. if everything goes to sh*t again, i'll probably just let it happen. i will be bad. next time around there won't be coming back only shame and embarassment but if i don't turnaround then i won't experience the after effects, and that is okay.   i actually don't mind typing in this blog, i don't really expect anyone to read it. this is censored of course. 90% of my real thoughts can be found in my journal. i have kept that particular journal since 1999. i have a restriction on my journal, i am not allowed to re-read anything that i wrote before. i am scared for myself of what i may have written years ago, especially during those times that were really unclear. i think most of all i didn't want to recall certain events or details of days past.

      music is such a part of my life. i am the youngest of six children. the nearest sibiling in age is seven years older than myself and the oldest is at least 15 years my senior. my older brothers like the rock of the 80s, ozzfest type of music. my sisters were the pop, madonna & duran duran type music. myself i am a child of the grunge era. only until i went to college i could fully except that i did like the metal band music as well as all the pop without shame as well as oldies, r&b, rap, techno, disco/funk, its all good...well with the exception of country, although i do like that dixie chicks cover of fleetwood mac (or billy corgan).  when i was upset during my angst teenage years i would cope by retreating into my room with the lock securely in place, surrounded by my dark grey walls. i would place my stereo on the floor and play music extremely loud with my body pressed against the wooden floor, only to fall alseep for hours at a time.   i went to a sucky college. duh. looking back (with much regret) i hate to admit i would have ended up at a preppy school anyways. if it was williams it most likely would have either been yale or brown. i can complain forever of how much hate i have for that place, believe me, there will be a blog for that. anyways, people there are so bland. people that are insanely intelligent but they have no sense of self. they are not interesting at all, with no taste. i had to be different.  i had the bleeched dyed hair blue, then green, and finally red. i like dark clothing. i had the music raging loud from everyone one of my dorm rooms. people were scared of me, i guess i give that impression sometimes. music was always there for me. it was bad enough one of my valid reason for staying in socal for school was just so i could continue to wake up to kevin and bean and listen to kroq music all day. instead i ventured into the purple hills of western massachusetts only to find myself alone. it totally sucked! only sanity was the these preppies were serious alcoholics. to think i had to go to that place to have my first ever drink and cig. kenki, thankfully, would send me cds and i was always downloading music to keep my "sanity."   every night i went to sleep with loud music because i couldn't deal with the quietness. i was so upset at the school, people just really pissed me off. i loved to blare the offspring and scream lyrics that could be heard throughout the house. for two years i played deftones at least 5 days out of the week at least two times before i finally fell asleep. other days it would be metallica, a perfect circle, my own mix of coldplay, linkin park, papa roach, or disturbed.   there are certain songs that i love or remind me of my childhood like dee-lite, grooves in the heart (?) this reminds me of 6th grade, etc. there are also songs that just really make me sad, like the police, (stalker song). then there are those songs that have both good and bad associations. i have good times listening to metallica and seeing them live, they always will remind me of my brothers but there have been really band times in my life where i sought comfort or in times of real anger while listening to their songs. their songs don't make me angry, if anything, they make me sad, but i associate a lot of moments in my life with music.  if i could have people follow me with theme music everywhere in order to express what i am feeling that would be cool, although sadly strange. did you ever watch, "i'm gonna get you sucka?" lol. if you've ever seen it you will know what i am typing out. theme music.  for one thing i never look at people. i swear. i don't notice what people are wearing or can recall people i've known forever their look. when i get a hold of a cd and love it. i am always surprised when i finally get to see what they look like. imagine my surprise when i fell in love with the violent femmes. my friend, mozzy, had loaned me her tape, yes i did say tape. i played that out. then i took it and had to get her another one. i didn't know anything about them beyond their music that i was quite frankly, surprised. not until last year i finally go to see them live. i love them!   basically music is important to me. if i had to answer whether i would prefer to be deaf or blind, i would pick blind. i hate looking at people anyways.

      last nights festivites were full of twirls and sparkles!  but first, two more quotes from my birthday night, duh, the most wrongly interpreted: 1. "i can't believe you guys haven't seen Dick! i seen it when i was like twelve or something."- me 2. lastly, "BJ's fu*ked me over last night!"- me again.   "le jour de lenn" i walked forever yesterday in hollywood on search for the awesomeness present EVER for lenn. well not, EVER, we did a pretty good job on the grad. present this year and card i think. it was a good day at the cantina as well.  some of lenn's memorable party quotes of her reign: (no more explanations as requested) 1. "is it in your crack?" - lenn (when i remember i will type)  no doubt started with "we will rock you." first off, NO. i was disturbed and upset. like i started to shout and rave, "i do not sing this song unless i am at a hockey game!!!" not to mention the "crown" and colors on their best of album?? l.a. kings?? i noticed these things. then they played MY song last. other than the fact that i shook my fists at gwen and i was older than 80% of the audience, it was a good show.  at this show like many other public places, i tend to see things. things other people would never notice. i usually point them out and i am somehow right. sorry lenn for making you laugh so hard you hit your head on the seat in front of you, i had to tell someone my observations. by the way, why isn't "dido" pronouced like "tito" so it sounds like "dee-doe"??  i would also like to damn all those drivers who honk in the parking structure thinking that all the cars would magically line up and move out in an orderly fashion. i wanna go home and take my drugs and go to sleep too. damn you! by the way, old people really got to stop driving, kenki almost kicked a senior's ass the other day, and so rightly.  BY THE WAY... IF YOU ARE READING MY RANTS, PLEASE POST A COMMENT. EVEN IF ITS TO SAY YOU READ IT OR ACCIDENTLY ARRIVED AT THE SITE OR SIMPLY YOU ARE NOW READY TO POKE YOUR THE EYES OUT OF YOUR SOCKETS (OR BETTER YET, SOMEONE ELSE'S)OR FED UP WITH MY GRAMMAR OR LACK THERE OF. THANK YOU.  I love JET the band! woohoo!

      Happy Birthday Lenn!! I officially declare you Queen now, you may take my reign. All hale, Queen Lenn. today, you will have your coronation and lots of fun. as you know, i called my friend Gwen and arranged tonights festivites, so we will enjoy the night. by the way, did you like my song that i left you at midnight? did you notice the deteriation in my thought process? i was a bit drugged and eight minutes of messages and singing wasn't exactly great, but i thought of you. then i crashed. (scared that i may be immune to my drug now, damnit! i woke up at 2 am and then of course at 5 am, boo! but then again, i could have been so excited about todays festivities.)  "le weekend" the weekend of festivites was ongoing and great fun. thanks to all for the gifts and not to mention all the "juicy goodness." there is only one thing i can boo this past weekend, the birthday hangover. boo BJ beer pallate! i hate beer, so this was hard. but i didn't mind waking up in some city. i think it was santa monica, still not sure two days later.   i talked with SANDY!! man it was great. she is fabulous and i am so happy for her and her family. side note: she is an emt in san diego. i did have to ask her if she knew my emt guy. lol. other news, victor is getting married, congratulations (i still sorry about dragging you into the slam pit at saniterium last summer, sorry about the phone, it was fun right?) lastly, i found andrea!! i was so happy to run into her. we need to throw a party for nora, that baby is about to come out. i am sooo happy for her! oh duh, birdie got a nice new ride, comfy, loud, and smells like fresh dead animal! (leather, mmm...dead animals.)  okay now to the hate part. it was partly last night during the countdown of lenn's happy day. (have a great day?! LOL) i hate someone with a passion that will exist after my dead body continues to decompose! i hate you, i hate you, i hate you!   that is all for now. i think my brain is waking up, it should since i am studying. okay my rant is done for now.

      today is my birthday!!! i was crowned with my tiara before midnight last night. i got lots of very kick ass presents as well as a pie! yes, i did just type pie. i was surrounded by loved ones, as well as friends (the other were bottles). we watched nkotb, of all things to amuse ourselves with, etc.   lots of good quotes to add later from the fiesta, but here are some... 1. "lick yourself, then i'll service you." - come on, you have lick yourself in order for the sugar to stick. how could i hand you over the "fun" if you aren't ready to receive. that was a perfectly valid statement. 2. "so how was your silk panties?" - lenn wanted a drink called that. i was just asking her how it tasted. 3. "wow, there are multiple orgasms, its hard just to make just one!"- myself "i would be lucky just to get one."- lenn - my brother gave me this book of every drink and i was just at awe at the different versions since i learned to make it differently. lenn's smart mouth responded to that quite rightly.  okay, festivites are on for tonight, it should be lots of fun.  things already good about today:  1. my very bizarre and strange one hour dream that had mike vitar in it, jorge in it, spaceships, a 12 hr. movie, two gay soap opera actors, losing my shoes, running from suva to a train station (w/o shoes) to get to my apartment with the crazy lady that was my manager. it was definitely quite odd. 2. tons of food from 'fosters' for only a mere 90 cents. thank you lupe! 3. got a free ice cream cone from 'fosters' because its my birthday and i am Queen for the Day damnit! 4. all the text messages i have received from people who love me. 5. invited yet again, to another kroq street team survey. yay! only 20 people so are get it a week. this is my third time.  tootles.  extra note: gizmo did not kill last night like i thought he might have. its still scary looking. it freaks me out and makes me scurrd that it just stares.  and my future address along with lenn and kenki is: 151 Scott Circle  Chino, CA *the house with the large bush in front (lenn get the S.C.???? I didn't notice that until this morning.)

      can't computers do anything right? honestly!  i am currently working on company merchandise. birdie just handed me a native condom, that was something i didn't expect to get as an early birthday gift.  i said goodbye to my best friends, the "painkillers," i think i can do without them now.    i finished one set of earrings. doesn't help that i am watching movies while working. (i am done for now.)  i have a new phone, but i am not used ot it yet. still need some more phone numbers.   i stalked people online today. i can't believe who i found! i won't harass but its funny. i really want to continue my stalking but unforuntately i am very tired.  still no real appetite but enough to know i should eat something. no more body induced/forced anorexia nervosa.  no gym today, maybe tomorrow.   things i hated today: 1. slow dsl. 2. blogs out of order! 3. having to re-do the same earrings three times. 4. the person or persons who stole my phone while i was intoxicated at the brass monkey. bastards! 5. no set sleeping schedule. slept through my invite to see Dodgeball today.  things i liked today: 1. my new "look." i think it would match the 'vampire-look' i had on saturday.  2. my sandwich for lunch, it was delicious. 3. watching Airplane and one of my favotite characters, Johnny. 4. re-telling my recent heroic adventure and brush with death. i have survived once again. damnit! 5. i wrote two testimonials on friendster and harassed an old friend.  things you may not know about me: 1. i have bullets in me! (well, kind of..sort of...hey i have the scars!) 2. i love tiaras! i will get on on my birthday. 3. my birthday is in Pi. after: 122353"62680".

      today's personal fact: i love to eat avacados.  two of my friends have made their own blogs now. vent ladies vent!  i woke up at 5 am today and couldn't go back to sleep so i went to the gym. i tried to do my ab workout after my cardio and it didn't work, i still need some time to heal.   i would also like to annouce that i think i am officially one of the last people to watch Shrek 2 today. it was cute. i love the kitty.  i want a kitty. i actually want lots of kitties so i can roll around in kitties. i will be cat lady one day. i can dream since i have pretty much lost most hope on everything else i ever wanted.  i also trapped myself in Target for a while, i couldn't decide if whether i wanted to start collecting Sex in the City or Curb Your Enthusiasm, they also released the first season of Kids in the Hall and Reno911. so many more dvd's to buy, not open, and never watch.  i am still working on my x-files marathon, i am on season 5 now, only a couple more to go.    just had my dinner, an endless bowl of salad and steamed broccoli. i want to go to the gym later tonight but not sure if i should. i need to call someone now before i forget, still not quite used to the eastern/pacific time difference, i usually forget until its too late.

      the graduation was great, congrats "burnt fingerz!" this week has made me so tired, did not help that i didn't fall asleep until the early morning hours.   will write at length tomorrow, hopefully i'll get a full workout and work on some company merchandise.

      i didn't go! i really wanted to but i've been too ill lately to venture off again. i cannot guarentee that something might go wrong with my health for a five day trip.  many errands to run before next weekends festivities anyhow. today is day one of no more whooziness, hopefully this is the right decision.  brain not functioning today due to sleep deprivation and lack of energy because i still have no appetite.   countdown this week: 3 days til birdie's birthday 5 days til niece & boss birthday and night fun 6 days til salvadorian party and most likely, night fun 7 days til kenki's graduation and night fun

      today, sadly, is the last day. at least i have gained a lot, i felt officially apart of a community in a non cult-like way.  packed and ready to enjoy the coastal organisms of the sea.  lenn, i know you will miss me but i'll back refreshed for our upcoming "fun" festivities.  i leave you with several things you may not know about me... 1. i am proud to admit being a nkotb fan, my fav was joey. 2. i nearly died three times. (i guess i have 6 lives left) 3. i currently fear carbs. 4. i first started stalking when i was 12.  whom? the LA Kings. 5. never got the whole shoe shopping and purse thing.

      so far, today’s dislikes are the following: dried and clumpy Wite Out, LA Skyline covered by smog, $1.33 for 20 oz. of water, Beastie Boys being played every 15 min., no more “Rock Me Amadeus,” secretaries not answering the phone so i end up have to answer the phone and get to talk with annoying people (yay), writers cramp, having to nourish myself, running out of water, the uneven distribution of sunlight when the sun is setting in my office, people on friendster that don't allow a random person like me to view their profiles.  i am still sitting in my office with the door shut blaring my cd's trying to finish all this paperwork, only the internet, an insane kitty named Sabo Cat and her sister Birdie keep me company (MAO!).  i'll finish the files later.    my heart wants to give out soon, so i better get to the gym before midnight.  tomorrow is a big day, haven't decided if i want to go out and celebrate.  apparently sunday i'll be off camping with my future in laws along the cali shore til thursday.

      i have so much work to do and i feel whoozy. the whooziness is either coming from the craziness or simply that i am anorexic now. i am actually kind of afraid that i might fall soon becuase all the elements are present.  i am tired and broke. i had hell of a social calendar these last two months. this party, that party, this show, that, etc. presents galore.    i need to retreat sometime soon.  i guess it is good that i lost my cell phone, then i won't be bothered so much with the trials of life.    i am so jumpy right now its weird.  there is this stupid rope (noose-like) that occasionally passes my office window on the seventh floor and its freakin me out.

      i didn't go. i was so pissed off, i kind of lost it. i hate when this happens because its unexpected and there are so many people everywhere i cannot "cope" with it in private. i hate that there is never a private space in this big city. i did relieve the pressure and stress but in a negative way. old habits really die hard.  no stealing a car or shooting sprees this week. at least i get to go to the funeral party on saturday, work out, and finish crap up. i should be done with my newest book by this weekend.

      horsies and JET kicked some ass. i know how to bet on horsies now and&nbsp;i totally rule. i won on my first&nbsp;bet and almost won serious cash, if only my horse came in third instead of fourth. i can't wait to go back. the weather was good, not too hot. traffic was hell getting down there but we did. i think i scared the producer because i kept talking about serial killers. hey its not my fault i like watching random shows late at night when i can't sleep.   on another note,&nbsp;before we left i found out who that 'gang member' was that was shot last week near the producer's house...it was this football player in h.s. that graduated with us, marc v. i don't recall how i knew him but i did and he was an alright kid. he's the second person i know of that died in our 98 class, the other was victor m. its kind of sad that these deaths are regular occurrances and not much of a shocker like it should be.  i had a great workout yesterday, but now my right knee is out of whack. i hate when i do too much and throw out my knee.&nbsp; anyways i need to run a couple of errands and get them done by wednesday because i'll be out of here. i am going to miss the funeral party! boo! i've been waiting for this party. i want to party at the funeral home!! damn. i'll be back next week. luckily i was able to change my reservations to get back by next wednesday because i really want to go to the show. the show should be fun, although i was thinking of not going for a while.&nbsp;i was just going to sell my ticket because i remember my last trip to the roxy, or i remember, not remembering my last trip to the roxy i guess. how is it, the two times i've ever had that&nbsp;GHB put in my drink, they were dropped in by umass, amherst boys?? is that the only way umass boys get laid? honestly. they are such losers! luckily my friends eventually found me. that drug, seriously sucks ass.   anyways, i think i will go home for a bit, then head for the gym. i want to complete my workout before the monday night crowd.  &nbsp;

      i came in early, i am quite impressed with myself. breakfast: bagel and coffee. i have about three hours before our little roadtrip to san diego. i guess there will be no bass practice today. hopefully next time we go we can also visit that little paradise known as TJ. i need to pick up more "prescribed" medication. its bad enough i had to go through sleep withdrawal this past month. i love mexico! good times for sure. i pretty much think if you do anything "weird"or "wild"&nbsp;in another country, its okay because you aren't from there and it doesn't really count. plus its kind of fun not knowing how you got to the hotel in the wee hours of the morning,&nbsp;only knowing that there was some&nbsp;stumbling going on while you crossed the border. i love to go with my friends too. unused, lonley stripper poles are always great fun in TJ too. good times! i would totally put a pole in my house.   oh yeah, right, practice. it was okay i guess. bridie cracked my arm and her 50$ ball caused me great pain. this is why i prefer working out at the gym because the machines don't attack me and cause bruises! well we will start a "super pulskamp" team next month. the team will be a family team + the future in-law (me). lol. honestly, i suck. i am not competitive when it comes to teams.&nbsp;   by the way this&nbsp;IS me. so weird, one of these quizzes actually is right.   &nbsp;&nbsp;  anti-social   urlLink  Which Personality Disorder Do You Have?    brought to you by

      last night's weather was perfect! it wasn't as hot as it has been these past few days. i have a few hours before volleyball practice. i know i just typed volleyball. we'll see how that goes. i also got the movie filmed in hell called "the human stain." i was more preoccupied with the campus than i was with the plot of the movie. it was ultra creepy seeing that forsaken place again. yeah i spent my 20$ well. damn me for buying every dvd released.   tomorrow i will be in del mar to see my Aussie boys again! yay! i love them. i think i will also bet on some horsies since i will be there anyways. saturday looks like club80s, that should be lots of fun. oh yeah, i will be at the arclight too. i want to go see that Metallica documentary.  well let's see this crazy lady just walked in my office right now and tried to bump me off the computer so she can check her email. yeah, like that's going to happen. first off, knock. second, like hell. i sent her to the public education terminals. something is wrong with that woman, she thinks she's all that and a bag of chips because she is the P. whatever!&nbsp;  going through my email just now i found out someone from the class of 2004 already died. don't know the kid. i really don't get that life actually has a purpose. why try? why have goals or any ambitions in life. seriously, if you are going to die anyways, what's the point? i know i don't need to impress anyone. there are way too many people in the world today and most aren't born into priviledge or destined to change the world, i know certainly i wasn't and am not. i hope its not like that french movie where, everything happens for a reason no matter how little or how small. there are frightening things about life i always thing about.   1. there lived a person hundreds, if not, thousands of&nbsp;years ago that had a name, relations, and a full life. today, they will not be remembered as if they never existed. basically, if a tree falls does it make a sound if there no one around to hear it type of deal. why live today when history is not absolute.   2. why be that person who missed an appointment to by a mere two&nbsp;minutes to instead bump into some stranger (who if not late, you never would have bumped into) whom has to go home and change their clothes only to arrive home and find their spouse having an affair.&nbsp;this stranger then murders these people&nbsp;in a rage of jealousy. would have, should have, ifs, buts, etc. i don't want to have to live this horrible life only to be 60 years of age and then my "purpose" was to bump into somebody.   nothing makes sense, so why try. my life slogan is pretty much: whatever happens, happens.   just stalked bean on aim. i am bored. i still have an hour or so to do nothing!

      another hot day in southern cali. i've been saying for years now, the end is near.  &nbsp;  let's see my life has&nbsp; basically been full of applying sunscreen, training, sleeping, sitting in front of the fan, plotting, and hiding. i hid from alex yesterday, i am glad i was wearing my adidas cap. &nbsp;i hate running into people from high school. i also hate hearing about people from high school. i heard some projectile vomit worthy news, first it was a shocker that danny and patty dated much less are now engaged and are soon to be married. how did they ever meet each other in the first place? i was apart of their circles and it all seems&nbsp;weird. what is up with all their people getting married, much less most of the people i was once childhood friends with now have children.&nbsp;i don't get it.  &nbsp;  as for my weekend plans its one of two things. first i might help adult-nap Sabo Cat and touring wine country or go see my anorexic Aussie hotties. its really a toss up, both will be fun. thursday i have volleyball practice apparently, yeah that should be fun. i like certain elements of sports like going to the batting cages, but i don't really like "playing" with people. honestly i'd much rather beat the crap out of my niece's coach with the bat. &nbsp;i really hate going to these kids games and the adults are the crazy ass people shouting and yelling all the time. i like hitting the volleyball and drills but i don't actually like "playing." i also enjoy shooting hoops but again, not actually "playing." i guess that's why i am more of a runner because i do it alone and its competition against my self and no one else. believe me, no one wants me to be competitive at sports because i would most likely just beat the crap out of someone. hell, i beat the crap out of the people i play monopoly with, now that is something i take really seriously.  &nbsp;  as for my sleeping schedule, i kind of have one now. i have been going to sleep without any aids lately and i have been waking up at the same time every morning. kudos for me! hopefully this will be a long term habit.  &nbsp;  write more in a bit, i need to make reservations for a trip.  &nbsp;

      sleep schedule is still off, i woke up at 4:30 pm today but its okay considering i haven't had a bad dream for a couple of days. i did have a dream where there was a snake and i was desprately trying to avoid touching it. of the many things in our navajo way, snakes&nbsp;are definitely one thing we are not supposed to never touch. as for memories, what i think i hate the most when i start to recall events is when these memories come back when i see something or smell something. i have been freaked in the past where i am in a public place and all of a sudden a&nbsp;person's cologne freaks me out.  &nbsp;  as for my mental break i have been going to the gym and watching dvds.&nbsp; i just finished watching the complete series (one season) of "freaks and geeks" and you know what? i absolutely loved it and i am quite upset that i have no closure. when the dvd came out the cast&nbsp;had a signing the day after lenn and i met JET, damnit i missed it.  &nbsp;  well i think its time to come out of my hybernation or mental break. i have been doing a lot of thinking about life and&nbsp;&nbsp;i really don't understand what happened, but i guess i can't really change anything.&nbsp;&nbsp;i ranted at kenki last night all my frustrations but at least others feel the way i do.  &nbsp;  today's kenki's parents 21 st. anniversary. yay! tomorrow is a big day, we have our annual education picnic at griffiths park,&nbsp;last year was such a success hopefully this year will be the same. i am sure i will feel some anxiety tomorrow so i may bail early. i don't think i will go to the wedding event tomorrow either, i'd rather just hang out and i guess its a no on the Rooney show on sunday.  &nbsp;  i want to make another blog and review my some happy school memories that i have been remembering lately. http://twstedchick2.blogspot.com

      i looked at something i should not have looked at before i tried to sleep. i looked into my past and for the first time, i wanted to remember. i always thought if given the opportunity to regain certain memories i wouldn't allow it, but last night i was struck with strong sense of curiosity. there were names of actual people that i obviously spent time with that i have no recollection ever existed. there are times and dates that don't make any sense to me. it makes me wonder what else do i not remember. it probably contributed to another sleepless night. i had nightmares for hours on end, i was afraid to fall sleep. then i had this weird morning day dream of my old music instructor, axworthy and for some reason the living end was opening up their annual concert then i was in some van with teachers on some mission of some sort. most bizarre i know. i guess its to be expected now.  since i did not sleep according to my set schedule for today, i will be off by a couple of hours.  i hate thinking. i hate going back. i hate analyzing my choices in life. arggh...i hate being frustrated. also, apparently i am a bottle of sweet, delicious, juicy goodness.    Vodka    urlLink   ?? Which Alcoholic Drink Are You ??      by the way, i enjoyed michael moore's new documentary on the bush administration, i definitely would watch again. i am suprisingly not as apathetic to political issues as i have been in the past, i have been following this election year.   another argh! VARSITY so annoys me. STOP IT!

      most times i don't know who i am or why i make the choices i make. currently i am in a transitional stage. i will abandon most and keep what does not question. i trust no one. after last thursday's "accident," i've decided to slam the breaks and hit the brick wall. i know what i am getting myself into and i am prepared for the worst. i will be hiatus for a while and hopefully in the time ahead my road will be smoother and a bit clearer so i can start anew; its always hard to return from the deep dark. after all these years i am still not used to it.

      bridie is kidnapping me again! hopefully she doesn't take me across state lines again. although it was fun last time. right now she's going to take me to a cheesy bar. what adventures we have at those places. need to call rocky now, i hope he can meet us. as for tonight's plans, not so sure. the olympics start tonight so i wanted to watch opening ceremonies but the voodoo glow skulls are performing tonight close by. i also found,(with the help of kenki)padilla's ska band. they are performing tomorrow at roxy, i want to go. I hate TICKETMASTER!! bastards charge way too much. monday i will go and see incubus at the Jimmy Kimmel then again on Wednesday. yay!   i have so much to do but i guess i can just say screw it.

      hopefully i will be crazy again in the ways of the gym. last week i went to the gym 5/7 days. i also stayed on the elliptical machine for an hour each time not to mention all the other stuff i do. today i worked out for two 1/2 hours. i will go back to the gym in about another two hours. i want to be that gym whore again who does nothing but wear gym clothes, works out, picky about the food i eat, etc. hopefully next week i'll start yoga again, then eventually add morning swims.    anyways, nothing exciting happening. incubus concert is next week, that should be fun.

      another one of those damned online test has cast me to hell. i love dante's inferno and always thought what level i would end up in when i finally die. i guess its LEVEL SEVEN.         Level    Score       urlLink Purgatory   (Repenting Believers)   Very Low       urlLink Level 1 - Limbo   (Virtuous Non-Believers)   Very Low       urlLink Level 2   (Lustful)   Very High       urlLink Level 3   (Gluttonous)   Very High       urlLink Level 4   (Prodigal and Avaricious)   Very High       urlLink Level 5   (Wrathful and Gloomy)   Extreme       urlLink Level 6 - The City of Dis   (Heretics)   Extreme       urlLink Level 7   (Violent)   Extreme       urlLink Level 8- the Malebolge   (Fraudulent, Malicious, Panderers)   Very High       urlLink Level 9 - Cocytus   (Treacherous)   Very High      Take the  urlLink Dante's Inferno Hell Test     man i am so tired. we didn't make it to TJ as planned. the drama from last night continued this morning and almost again tonight. i have my own thoughts about this drama but i will keep it to myself because its none of my business. i just know that i was a bit grumpy and pissy about the whole situation today. if a certain person never called and the chain of events didn't happen, then today would have been a good day. anyways i saw horsies, but i didn't win like last time. sabocat had a good day, she won some money. talked with cj today, everything seems good. i miss you cj! also talked with metalman, he tied the knot on july 3rd, kudos!  today was the first time i ever laid my eyes on the band cake. when i hear music i like i never care to see what they look like or any other background information on the band. if the music is good, its good enough usually. i used to listen to their cd's a lot when i was in college, especially when i would study. not to mention when i was depressed, there are some very good tracks on fashion nugget that i like to blare out loudly. cake didn't play the song i wanted to hear so i have to boo them a bit.  i didn't go to the gym today. shocker. instead i ate poorly. damnit! well i will work out like crazy tomorrow, well assuming that i actually get some decent sleep tonight.

      i really hate when i am a penny or two short!    urlLink    shes like to kill babies and make drinks.  Posted by  urlLink Hello    as a late night entry i am still awake and its three am. i am talking with pablo. we just went out to a couple of places and saw some bands perform. joey's band isn't as great as i was hoping they would be. i heard them practice and stuff but i guess i expected too much. after about fifteen minutes we left. we ladies then went to this punk/80s club. the bands were alright, venue small but okay. bands were off to a good start, pretty young kids playing, seemed like high school kids. finally our last stop was another bar. this band had like two people watching them, pretty sad. i was way too tired.   oh yeah, the band, the DeVice, i got a hold of a cd of theirs outside the roxy when i was chattin with Jerry. well first off, there was a phone number on it and out of curiosity i called. i listed to the cd quite a few times by the next day and i liked it. i went to the website and checked them out. its just funny because the guy called me back, bryan. i then harassed the lead singer,jimmie on myspace. they seem pretty cool and hard working. roisin talked with bryan when he called my phone tonight. she thinks she scared him. they have a show at the whiskey on the 25th; i want to go as do my friends (we are the list i think) but then again, with all this calling and chatting with them at 3:30 am it all now seems a bit creepy in retrospect on my part.   oh well. lots more shows to attend and more music to discover.

      my neck is sore. i have a bruise on my left knee as well as a slightly larger one on my right knee. i also have finger-like bruises on my mid-left thigh. well, what can i say? papa roach put on a great show. i got to the front and i totally felt the music. i love their lyrics. papa roach brings back some really bad times in my life and i am glad i didn't fall apart when i heard them. i was fine until the last song, last resort. kenki noticed that i was spacing out.  i wanted to type a super long blog today but i have to actually get out of this office. i need to pick up my niece at her softball game.  i am going to go home and watch "airplane!" and stretch out. no gym today. tomorrow i will hang with bridie and sabo cat. saturday i will be getting my drugs in TJ and then off to del mar to bet on the horsies and see cake again. yay.  by the way, i took this picture from the paparoach website. isn't jerry cute? i got to stand in front of him during the whole show, get his guitar pic, his autograph, and chat with him outside the Roxy and of course hug him.  The new Papa Roach, "Getting Away with Murder" releases August 31, 2004.    urlLink    Provided by www.paparoach.com, Jerry Sleeps. He is so cute! Very nice guy.

      headed to the gym in about half an hour or so. my workouts have been pretty good lately. yesterday i saw priscilla r. i smoothly turned to my right and moved across the gym in order to avoid her. i really hate running into people from high school. luckily she didn't see me.  tonight is the show at the roxy. it should be fun. i'll be headed to sunset around 4 to meet up with kenki. bridie won't be going to the show. papa roach brings back some awful times in my life. hopefully the music doesn't bring me down like that time with metallica when "one" hit me. i am currently running on three hours of sleep, it won't be long now until i kill over. i don't mind sleeping in the gutters of sunset as long as i get to sleep.  damnit, i forgot my vitapills for the day. oh well, i have to go home to change anyways.

      i had a great workout late last night, i didn't get home until well after midnight. i'll spend a few hours online today then head to the gym again.  at the funeral party, i got a glimpse into what i'll be doing for my friends. i think our snake dance will evolve into a mosh pit. that would be most fun. i also saw the village, i liked it.  i signed off of friendster. that website seriously sucks ass. i prefer myspace.com better. i am surprised i am not addicted to that site as of yet.
