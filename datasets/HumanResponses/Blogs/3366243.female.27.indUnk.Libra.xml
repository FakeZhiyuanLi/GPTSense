      I have just arrived from the biggest, most successful event I have ever coordinated.   It was Amazing, the people I worked with were phenomenal and the MC kicked ass... go Justin!!!   Amongst some of the guests were Finance Ministers, ex prime ministers, ex prime minister's son, Michel Richard, Julie Snider um Justin Trudeau and many many more. Pulse was there, Global did a bit on it the morning of the 29th and Flash was all over the place during the cocktail and the beginning of the dinner. There were 65 thous. Daff. another few thousands of silk ones, lights all over the place, we even had a VIP lounge with a flat screen TV to watch the "not so successful" hockey game.   We raised a record net amount... more than any of the previous years since its conception, 11 years ago. My boss thanked me and told me that this year it ran 100 times smoother than the previous year and she said I had everything organized. Even Justin kept thanking me for making everything so easy for him, his speech, the cue cards, reminding him when he was up. He really made me blush as the compliments poured in. We had big bands, singers and a Frank Sinatra impersonator, he was awesome too.   I have to say, I am soooooooo tired, sooooooo achey, soooooooo emotional about the whole thing because this is my FIRST real baby and I left the Hospital not knowing hat I was getting myself into and in the end, I just got myself into the best thing ever. It was great, beautiful, and spectacular.   My typing is probably horrendous right now, but I don’t give a crap, I just wanted to get it all down while it is fresh in my mind and share it with the few readers I have. It was a great event for an even greater cause (CCS) and I would do it again in a heart beat with all the ups and downs.   Peace and good night people, tomorrow I get to sleep in YAY!!!! Well today heh.

      Did you ever wake up one day and everything just seemed to go totally right?    You actually want to get out of bed even though it is 4:00 a.m., your shower is awesome, your son is ready ON TIME for school, you look decent, the road to work is practically flawless and your favorite songs are all playing on the radio, your Mocaccino is Orgasmic and your Boss is in such a chirpy mood...    Well, today is that day for me and it just keeps on getting better.  My Boss told me that today was THE DAY for my bonus (Prefect timing because I have really been wanting that Digital Camera).  My cousin is in town and I rarely see her (she moved to Alberta, then Yellow Knife, now Niagara Falls) and a bunch of us are going to go for drinks tonight so its going to be picture time.  Its not sunny outside, but its warm (mostly humid but it's ok cause I left my hair curly today).  I am going to actually have time to take a full hour lunch and I will get to do so with my dad, brother and cousin.  And last but not least (or maybe Least but not last?) I am actually getting quite a bit of work done (well not right THIS second) so I wont feel guilty this weekend and think about all the things I have to do on Monday.  I dunno, maybe this is lack of sleep talking, but it really is a great day, it doesn't take much to please me huh? LOL  Ok, well back to work I go, have a good weekend.

      I think I have had enough with men for at least the next 5 years.  Either I am super unlucky or I am a real Bitch (I am leaning more towards the earlier).  I can't seem to meet anyone half decent even if my life depended on it.  I am not talking about a serious, lets be monogamous type of relationship, I am talking about a simple friendship.  I have been talking to this guy for 4 years, Matt, aka Mr. Arkansas, we have shared every little secret (or at least I did) and every thought and fantasy and feeling and out of no where I am a bitch because I demand a little more after four fucking years.    My fuck friend on the other hand... He's in general not too bad... I just only see or hear from him when he wants some, god forbid Cindy has any needs.  There have been other guys over the last 2 years, one so called friend only called me or came by to smoke-up and watch movies when he was single, once he found himself a new fling, bye bye Cindy.  I called him on it the last time it happened, he said he would try and squeeze me in, I told him not to bother and guess what, that was the end of that.  This other guy, claimed he liked me and wanted to date me and so on, it was all BS.  I am ok with casual sex, I am only human and have needs too.  If that's all you want, just be up front about it and whatever decision I make at least it is my fault and I can't blame anyone but myself.  You would think that is pretty simple but no, not in this world.  I don't really know what I want and I am not out there trying to hook up with anyone, however I do know one thing, I want a friend (a male one, actually a woman would do just fine), I guess I am looking for a friend that I can be intimate with and also depend and trust.  I don't know if that makes sense, I'm so confused, I'm so tired of being alone.  Blah!!!

      One of those killer days where nothing goes right for the boss, and you get blamed or the littlest thing happens and you get tons of shit.  I have a pounding head ache, I haven't had lunch or any break as a matter of fact.  All I want to do is go home, eat and take a long ass MOFO bubble bath.  Ciao!

      So Saturday I went to see Shrek 2 with my son, I may be repeating myself, but PLEASE GO SEE IT!!!  And I forgot to mention that I had a "date"... yes a "date", with my son heh.  I don't date much, actually never, so I decided to take him out for supper (marathons) then for dessert (Rockaberry) then for a drive (the Old Port).  Surprisingly, it was an amazing evening, we talked, laughed and just chilled together, something we had not really done in a long time (The last 3 months I have been working mad hours and he has been spending lots of time at his grandparents).  I can't wait till our next "date"!!!  Sunday after a great supper with the girls and a couple of drinks, we decided to go see Troy.  This was my friend's 3rd time seeing this movie, I think she fancies Brad Pitt ;), hell, I fancy him after seeing this movie and him naked like 4 times - DROOLS.  I enjoyed the film, the actors, and the story but then again, what the hell do I know about movies right?  But most of all I enjoyed the night out with my friends, no fighting, no out of control drunk idiots and no harassments from out of control drunk idiots.  I think this should be a weekly thing, 3 months is way too long a time to go with out seeing your best friends.  Anyway, I am hungry and need to go buy shoes, laters.

      Ok, so I went for my usual La Bamba Tuna sandwich at JAVA U today and as I am waiting for them to grill it, I am looking at all the pastries.  Honestly, none do it for me - EXCEPT for the Brownie and today it was calling my name.  So the waiter hands me my sandwich and I get back in line and order my brownie.  The guy at the cash says:  "Let me find the biggest one" as he is going through one at a time, placing them side by side to see which is the biggest.  He finally hands me one.  Then the waiter comes by and says:  "Here, this one is the biggest" handing it over to the Cashier who then says, "Oh yeah, here you go"  hands it to me and I put it in my bag before then come out with a 2 foot by 2 foot big brownie.  JAVA U is awesome, the waiters are always nice, the majority of them are HOT!!! (guys and girls) and they are all very friendly.  I was not a coffee drinker until I discovered JAVA U, I get my Mocaccino almost every morning, and every now and then come get a sandwich, and maybe once a month, the BROWNIE!!! (DUDE have you ever tasted the thing??!!)  And I will straight out say it, I started going because of one of the employees.  To this day I do not know his name, but if I ever get the courage one day, I will ask him to go for drinks (I know, I am not looking for a boyfriend, so what :P ).  So here I am, giving JAVA U props and if they had a web site I would link it but they don't.  However, I have given you all the JAVA U locations, so if you haven't already done so, go get a coffee, or a danish, or even supper at JAVA U - who knows, maybe you will walk out with a date too :)

      It has been quite hectic for me at work the last couple of days, all the Thank you letters had to be proofread, sent out to be signed and once they come back I have to prepare all the envelopes so they can be mailed.  There are about 400 letters arghhh!  Anyway, nothing much to report except for my mother is driving me nutts with the whole "Start dating men Cindy, meet them off the net and go for coffee or drinks and start dating... blah blah... blah blah blah..."  I am not interested in Dating anyone... guy nor girl... A)  I do not have the time  B)  I do not have any interest in getting hurt again and C)  I don't think I am capable of loving anyone right now...   I love my son, and I think that's about it... I have love for my family and stuff, but to commit, to respect, to be loyal to and honest with - I don't think it is in me yet.  I am not 100% happy with myself and my life either, so how can I expect someone to be happy with me, with my life and my choices?  Anyway, I am not down on myself, but I know my valid reasons and I sometimes wish she would stop pushing.  One day either I will be where I want to be and all will fall into place, or I will meet someone who will help me get there, but until then, live a little right?  Besides, I have a few things that are way too good to give up just yet ;)  I saw the cutest skirt yesterday (I think I am going to go back and buy it tonight) it was fluorescent green, it said "50% Single" on the but and then had a Mess layer over top.  Anyway, looks better than it sounds.  There are a few things I want to buy actually... batteries :) and things you use batteries with, and shoes... and skirts yup yup.  Anyway, gotta go eat, I am famished, see ya!

      So this is it, for now anyway, I pretty much got everything I needed.  There may have been better ways of doing it, but hey, it works.  The only thing I am having trouble with right now is inserting an image (a logo type thing) at the top.  If anyone has any suggestions on that please give em to me.  And I think I have to somehow re-direct my old blog to this one... hmmmmmm ???!!!  As for the rest, all in time, when I get bored here or when I have alone time at home.  P.S.  This thing has a spell check which is cool, but go figure Blog is not a word... they give Bloc as a suggestion LOL

      I am not very savvy when it comes to HTML and stuff like that, everything I know is self taught, and I would love to know more but I suck.  I would love to have created my own Blog, but instead I have had to use a template from Tripod and I am limited to what I can do.  I would love to find a new template, from someone new, but I am afraid to lose all the archives.  And in the end, all I want to be able to do is add this  urlLink    to the side panel but I can’t, all I can add there are links.  I think I will change template and hope for the best, wish me luck.

      It is absolutely gorgeous out side, and this weekend calls for similar weather, perfect for camping and perfect for a camp fire with marshmallows.  It really is beautiful; I can’t wait to leave work and head to camp.  I have to leave early because they are changing my Patio Door in my bedroom and I need to move my bed, my trunk and remove the curtains.  I am excited that they are doing this finally ‘cause my door is hard to open and close and it rattles at the slightest gust of wind but I am not happy that I will not be home all weekend and there will be strange men in my apartment.  So last night I got home from picking up Nick from School, relaxed for like 30 minutes then I did my laundry for the weekend, made a fast supper, got Nick ready for bed, took a nice long shower and did all my girlie things (shaved, shaved and shaved heh) Spoke on the phone with my sister and that’s when the doorbell rang… I am still in my towel at this point (I make a habit of this huh?).  Anyway, yesterday I did something that I have not done in a very long time… wait, it may even be never, let me think… yeah, never.  I invited someone over… someone from the net who I have not met in person yet but talked to for a few weeks now I think.  Anyway, it was clear that all we wanted was one thing and one thing only.  Took me a while to initiate anything (all I did was say, “if you want anything to happen you best make a move ‘cause I wont” I never initiate… unless I have a few drinks in me).  But once it was initiated it was what it was.  I have not received oral in ages… and last night was oral fest heh.  It was the hot, sweaty kind where both parties are satisfied and you just lie there in your bed after ready to pass out.  Would I do that again, invite a practical stranger… probably not.  Would I invite him again, sure… it was pretty damn good .  Would he come again, I doubt it, something about guilt.  So what a great, refreshing start for a great weekend.

      In the Mirror this morning I read an article called Stroking for Stella and it went on to talk about how May has officially been deemed Masturbation Month.  Also, there is a Masturbate-A-Thon taking place this month and there is an on-line form you can   urlLink download   (hmmmm load?) for those who would like to participate.  Anyone?  It’s for a good cause, I think heh.  This is the funniest thing I have read in ages.  Do people really do this?  Will people go see there parents and there friends asking them to sponsor them for the Masturbate-A-Thon they are participating in?  Can you imagine?  Mother:  “Sure I will sponsor you to masturbate my son, how will the judges judge you?”  Son:  “The Honour System Mom, they will not judge by how many orgasms I have but by how much time I spend stroking it”  Mother:  “What a great system, you make me so proud son”   “Prizes will be awarded to the top five tuggers” -  Montreal Mirror , May 13 – May 19 2004   LOL

      Things have slowed down a little at work, clearly, and I really cannot stay away from this thing.  Actually, I am just bored and have no other way of amusing myself today.  I have read new blogs, commented on new blogs and vowed never to return to some of them new blogs.  So now let’s just talk about something so that 5:00 p.m. comes along sooner!  Today instead of shopping at lunch I actually did eat, gotta love Premiere Moisson and their Filouze.   Then I went for half hour walk down Sherbrooke Street and enjoyed the heat and the sun.  I can’t wait to go for drinks or for lunch on the Terraces of Crescent and so on, gotta love the summer.  Hey!  I have an idea… how do people meet decent single potentials, people?  I mean, I am single, a single mom at that, and I rarely have time to do anything but my regular motherly duties.  One night a week I get to myself but always end up at Trix with my sister (who her too is newly single) and we get drunk, sing a few songs and dance – but I have never met anyone date worthy there.  So where do single people go to meet other singles?  The on-line thing did not work, the Lavalife did not work, Yahoo Personals did not work… what works?  I know it happens when you least expect it, and I don’t live my days hoping to meet someone but enough is enough… I am tired of being lonely.  I just want a good friend to start, and then whatever happens - happens.  So yeah, I am hoping to get some input, from some of you, please lol.  Anyway, it is 4:30 p.m. I am still bored; it is slowly creeping up towards 5:00 p.m.  I am currently on line making possible plans with the “f-friend” for tonight to get me some but it does not look too positive.  It is beautiful out there huh?  Screw that, I am off this thing and I am gonna go listen to some music… laters!

      So today so is a skirt day and I wore the pretty pink floral one that I made a couple of years back with a nice white blouse.  I look all girly girl and pretty in it.    Also, yesterday instead of going to eat during my lunch break I went shopping (being nervous / angry all at once can do that to me) and I bought a really nice lip gloss called Eastend Snob by Rimmel.  It's natural looking with a high gloss and does it ever make my lips look bigger than they already are.  It's funny; I kept looking at my reflection in the Metro and thinking to myself "WOW! What nice plump lips"  Anyway, these past few days I have been feeling really good about myself and spring and summer and the whole skirts and bikini headaches I have been having.  Maybe sleep is helping or the time I actually have now to fix my hair and make myself decent.  Who knows but I do know I feel good!  This weekend's plans have changed, I am still going out to our camp site, but I will not be making a new friend.  Oh well, shit happens, besides I am so not use to entertaining people anymore that this may not be such a bad thing.  I haven't conversed with a guy (friend) in such a long time.  The only guy I talk to is my lil’ one Nick, or Matt in Arkansas and Mike which usually consists of a 5 minutes conversation and an hour of play:  "Hey"  "Hey"  "Wassup?"  "Nada, come here" grabs me and pulls me closer  "You smell good"  "Thanks" as he grabs my ass  "How about we go to my bedroom?"  "Ok" sticks his tongue out at me and I get closer to suck on it and from then on we just can't pry ourselves apart for the next hour or so.  After all is done and some moans and groans here and there:  "AGAIN!" I giggle  "I'll come by tomorrow, I need to go move my brother"  "I have to go too, ok, call me"  "OK, bye” more kissing  "MMMMMMM You really do smell good, bye"  So I really don't think that kind of conversation can fly with just about anyone, not when first meeting them anyway LOL.  So yeah, things happen for a reason, or don't happen.  I have to admit though; I am scared SHITLESS of going to camp this weekend.  After everything that has happened in the last year... I am petrified to run into my ex Husband or his friends and family - I think I might just start crying if I do.  I haven't seen my ex since his mother passed last August.  His Step Dad killed himself last month, and I am afraid for his well being, but also worried for my son and I (He has never hurt us, I don't think he would, but I am just really nervous cause there has been so much going on, so many drugs in his system and I just can't shake this weird feeling I have).  Anyway, long story short, having a MAN present just kind of reassured me a little and made going up there less scary.   That’s been the story of my last 2 years, just wanting a man, someone emotionally as well as physically big and strong, someone dependable (friend or more who friggen cares at this point, I would settle with a really good guy friend) to lean on every now and then.  I am no longer capable of being the POST for the family, my mom, my dad, my sister and brothers, especially my son.  I need help, I admit it, and I can’t do it alone.  I’m scared.  How did this go from - I feel good - to - I am scared -   that’s what happens when I am left alone to think about my life for too long.

      So Friday night we went out and guess what?  We did not go to Cheers lol.  This guy started off hitting on my sister, when she wouldn’t give him the time of day he turned to me (we had seen them and spoken to them in the past, we did not like them!).  I told him that I wasn’t interested in someone who wanted my sister or my friend first.  He pulled the whole “if I wanted your sister would I be here with you now?”  So I let him buy me drinks and let him kiss me… (kept my eyes closed the whole time and so pictured someone else).  We went for a walk, he tried to pull the moves on me… nothing happened but I felt kinda scared and told him I really needed to get back and I managed to get out of his grip.  So we got back to the bar, I asked Rob the DJ for help, he got me away and then the guy was like “please call me” and he hands me his business card.  At that point my sister was making out with the kid again so I said my good byes and left.  Got a call the next morning, she and he almost had sex in an elevator but he couldn’t get it up.  She refuses to go into further details as she is really embarrassed / ashamed because she is so not the type to do that.  Well, needless to say I just about puked hearing the story and this guy, if he knows what is good for him, he better never come and talk to us again.  My sister was really drunk and she admitted to not having much of her brain with her.  I was just bored and lonely and really regret it too so there you go anyway, blah… sick.  Moved my sister and her friend on Saturday (yes, we were all hung over but it went incredibly well considering).  She moved into a building where we believe ex Douglas patients reside now.  But it is a nice, cozy LITTLE place.  Yesterday was Mother’s Day and I had 3 great Mother’s Day gifts…. one given by myself… one given by myself again but with some help from someone…and one where I did not need to do a damn thing but enjoy it all…yup… it was good!  Was a pretty productive weekend no?

      Yeah it’s Friday, WOOHOO… I have to help my sister move tomorrow, not so WOOHOO.  We are all going out to celebrate, a b-day, new drivers permit, and new apartment whatever, we all have a reason to celebrate tonight.  So the plan is start off at Trix aka l’An Jeu (of course) and then make our way to Cheers (and if all goes as it usually does, I am willing to bet my pay that we are staying at Trix till closing).  We are gonna sing a little, dance a little then hopefully score a little… well anyway.  I don’t seem to have the desire to do what I use to.  Well kids, have a great weekend… be good!

      I got an e-mail yesterday telling me that someone had signed my guest book (which has not happened in ages by the way) and when I went to see whom it was it was one of the Performers from the Event. He was searching for some new on the event and came across my Blog.   I have to say I was shocked and embarrassed all at once. I have always been very careful not to put the hospital’s name in here and same goes for this job, it’s always been the Event, the Ball but never the ******** Ball. Except for a few posts ago where I went in to details about how wonderful the Event was (I changed it now).   I don’t have anything to hide per say, but, I have to admit that I can get kinda childish on here, and kinda dirty, and kinda rude LOL. The thought of somebody that I work with coming across my site, my Blog it kinda freaked me out. He even filled out my little survey I have when you sign my Guest Book.   But what’s even funnier he then sent me a real e-mail and said,   “Do I call you Cindy or Kuriouskitty?”   HEHE I am such a goof. Anyway, work is kinda busy today, and kind of fucked. The Musicians (go figure) should have been paid the night of the event, they didn’t, so the cheques were to be mailed Friday, they were not. Monday I speak to the Accountant and he verbally confirmed that he would be mailing out all the left over checks MONDAY, he didn’t. I call one of the Assistants; she found all the cheques on her desk without any instructions from the Accountant. So I told her to COURRIER them cheques NOW! My Boss wants to know WHEN they were mailed because one of the musicians did not yet get his pay. So I call back the assistant in hopes to save both hers and mine’s asses. Instead, her boss gets on Speaker phone and asks ME what the problem is. So I told her:   “The problem is that Mr. Accountant told me he would mail all the cheques and he didn’t. Instead he dumped it on your assistant’s desk without any instructions and I am trying to figure out a way to avoid getting your assistant and myself in trouble for something we didn’t do and had no control over, but since you don't seem to care I will just tell my boss what exactly happened, bye”   So I then went to explain to my boss what happened and added the little part on how every time I ask that woman for something (things my Boss has asked me to inquire on) she tells me:   “Your boss is not the only person we work for here, we have loads of other things to do and your boss will need to learn to be patient”   Needless to say my Boss wrote them ALL an e-mail saying how deeply disturbed she was to find out that…. And how it is unacceptable to treat suppliers that way especially if we hope to get there business again in the future blah blah blah…   I have a head ache… I need … stuff, and more stuff and chocolate. Is it 5 yet?

      It's funny how once you tell someone that you enjoy talking to them and want to do more talking with them all of a sudden they slowly but surely barely talk to oyu or stop talking ot you all together.   I should know better than to tell someone how I feel and expect those feelings to be returned to me. Way to go Cindy!!!   I have to let someone one who has I and only I in his heart find me.   P.S. I got my little Kitty this week, he rocks, he is so cute and cuddly and he purrrrrs a lot, we named him Rojo.

      So I know its spring and all and that if we are to have nice flowers and big green trees we need some rain, but come on already, show me the damn SUN!!!   I want to wear the little tank tops and the skirts with sandals; I am tired of the pants and jackets. Plus, I need to start working on my tan, how am I suppose to do that if there is no sun?   Anyway, I am backing up a little here, on Friday when I went for lunch with Didi at the JGH I saw all my old co-workers. Everyone was telling me how good I looked, how I lost weight, and how long my hair was. I suppose that is a good thing, only I do not see where I lost the weight and I thought I looked like a ghost with black circles under my eyes. Someone once said to me (like this week or something) that there are beautiful people who are naturally beautiful even when they think they are having a bad day and look like crap, could I be one of them? NAH!   I am so bored now, there use to be 3 girls that came in during the week (each on a different day) and now there is no one, but my boss and me. I desire to have someone to talk to, someone to tell me a story or what they did last night, and someone to make me laugh or tell me that they like my shirt or my hair in a particular way. I am so friggen bored! If you’re bored and have a phone at your finger tips, please call me at 1-800-IAM-BORED.   Thank you!   P.S. Obviously I am bored; check out my ramblings above, sheesh.

      I passed; I am now legally allowed to drive!!!   I was way calmer, way less stressed and way better. The tester dude was nice, at the end he told me,   “I have good news and bad news, which do you want first”   I said “the bad”   So he says, “The bad news is you will never have to see me here again and I will never have the privilege to see you again because the good news is you passed!”   So I was all happy and ready to cheer, but didn’t because I thought it might be childish. So anyone want to celebrate?

      Well kids, it’s time for the second road test tomorrow morning at 9:40 a.m. Hopefully this time is a pass and this weekend I can drive up to camp.   I was kinda having a crappy morning until I made my appointment, good news makes me happy. I know I am putting a lot of pressure on myself but I really need to pass ‘cause I really want to go to camp this weekend. I need to get away, just drive far and leave behind all this crap going on around me.   Anyway, keep your fingers and toes and all that crossed for me tomorrow!!!

      Maybe this title is not the best to discribe what I am going through but anyway...   So lately, when I go out with the friends and the bro and sis I have not been picking up. Well, it's not like everytime I went out I picked up but I have met a few guys here and there (nothing more than what it was). But not in the last long while - my sister who is newly single has been doing well in that department, my brother who is a dumb ass has been getting some too (not the wisest of choices but as I said - dumb ass!).   However, as I am writing this thing I am slowly but surely realizing that it may be ME the problem. I don,t think I want the meaningless BS one night flings anymore, I want to meet some one who will be around for a while.   It made 2 years since I got seperated and I have not dated anyone. As I said above, I met guys and fooled around, fucked, um fucked some more but no dating, no movies, no long conversations no hugs no cuddling no NOTHING!   Thats what I want, all the things that matter, all the things that makes being with someone meaningful and all the things that makes you want to see the person again and again and again.   I get jealous of couples on the street, my friends and even other blogs I have been reading. I am realizing they have what I am missing and I get bitter.   Sighs...

       Friday :  At 5:15 p.m. my boss is flipping out b/c her e-mail isn't working and I am flipping out trying to fix it and hurry up to go pick-up my son (I was running late).  So doesn't she start saying "someone has changed my passwords, someone had to have changed them, did you change my passwords?"  So that was the last straw for me, I told her that I was not hired to sabotage her computers, computers are not perfect machines, you need patience to work them and I would not be here trying to fix her email while I am super late to pick up my son if I were sabotaging her system.  I lost it after that, I started saying everything I was thinking and even shed a few tears (not b/c of her but rather because I was LATE picking-up my son).  I have put up with a lot of meanness from her lately and haven't said a peep.  She doesn't know that I am my mothers daughter and that her genes run through my blood and my mother never bites her tongue, NOW she knows.  I think she may have realized that she was WAY over reacting because she kinda shut up and changed tune then finally when she realized AGAIN that her email passwords had not changed and she was able to retrieve them she said "Ok, well we cannot let that sweet little guy of yours wait so go get him and have a good weekend, see you on Monday".  I just agreed and left.  Cried most of the route to pick him up, you know it's kinda hard to drive with your eyes full of tears.  I got to Nicholas' grandparents and apologized for being so late and explained in short what happened and they sympathized and she gave me a much needed hug!    After Nicholas and I returned downtown, he wanted to pick up a book at Chapters (he is a major book worm but I am so not complaining).  We met up with my dad who had found 4 NEW CDs worth $85 on a Second Cup table, he gave them to me, they were all pretty good so YAY for me!  So then we went to Hurley's Pub to meet up with Nicholas' grandparents and aunt again.  They all had a beer or wine or cider, I had an Ice Tea (I was driving) and some Nachos YUM.  We talked about anything and everything, we l;laught at Nicholas' jokes.   It was a fun and relaxing evening.   Saturday :  Woke up at a pretty decent time, showered, got dressed and went to the Card Shop with Nicholas, he picked out a few and then we headed to Java U for Lunch (the Java U guy was not there {pouts}).  Then headed down town again to go exchange some shorts I got for Nick, they were size 10-12 he needs 12-14, damn he is growing fast.  After that we went to see Two Brothers (the Tiger cub movie), it was EXCELLENT!!!  Nicholas and I both shed a few tears but it has a happy ending, I recommend you take your kids to see it, and even your SO.     Sunday :  Cleaned all day!!!  (Sounds like fun huh?)  Oh and had to get yelled at from my sister, she likes to play mother, then she hung up on me.  Why you ask?  Something about my brother's Birthday/Going away party being revealed to him from my Cousin, then him approaching each and everyone of us to manipulate us and find out more... Guess what, he tried with me, I told him to shut up.  He tried with her, she entertained him and made up these Cocamania stories and then he tried with my other brother who ended up confirming my cousin's original spillage.  Long story short, she was pissed and took it out on me.  Fuck her, fuck them all.  Family drama is really getting to me, I am tired of it, I am tired of them.  Everyone calls me to complain and bitch and yell at me.  I listen, I take it, I mean everyone needs a punching bag right and I figure that well be my good dead for the week.  But it never ends, and when I start to voice my opinions or thoughts, I get hung up on or told to shut up.  Whatever.

What ever happened to having decent CLEAN discussions?  What happened to all of the decent men out there?  Why wont they bother getting to know us better and possibly developing something good and better than just casual sex?  I dunno... I think I have really lost all hope when the male species is concerned and there isn't anything anyone can say or do that will change my mind anytime soon.  Blah!

      How is it that you create such a wonderful little human being?    How did I give birth to this perfect little being at the young and stupid age of 18 and have him grow up to be a perfect young little man.  Nicholas got his report card on Wednesday and it was amazing.  He is the "Top Ace" in Math and  en Lecture .  His scores ranged from 1s, 2+s and 2s and a 3+ in printing (he has horrible printing LOL).  His teacher wrote a beautiful comment too,  something along the lines of:  "It has been a pleasure to have Nicholas in my class this year.  He has such a BIG heart and has made other class mates feel very welcomed and comfortable in group activities and so on.  He has been a great asset to my class..."  That's the part that really stuck out.  I was such a shy little girl, I still am, I had a rough childhood because of this.  I was constantly teased, bugged and even physically hurt because I wasn't outgoing enough for the other kids liking.  He is the total opposite of me and for that I am SO grateful.  He has tons of friends, he tries out for everything even the choir solos, volunteers for everything and was even the captain for one of the class projects.  Way to go Nick!!!  I tell you I often wonder how I created him so perfect, yes I go as far as say PERFECT because I have never had any problems with him (teething stage and terrible 2s do not count).  He has always been very good, sweet, manageable and he is polite to others, very well mannered, a perfect little boy.  Lets just hope he keeps all these wonderful qualities as he becomes a man!!!  I was afraid that the last 2 years would have fucked him over but it seems it has only made him that better of a person, stronger, more confident.  He really is my hero, I am so lucky to be in his presence and wish that anyone who has a chance to meet him does because it will be well worth it.  With all the horrible things I have done in my life (I am not evil reincarnated but I have done some pretty dirty things) I am shocked and also so very grateful to have him in my life.  A second chance almost to make up for all the nasties and as far as I am concerned, I am doing quite well with the second chance, he is LIVING PROOF!!!  Now let me dry my eyes and get back to work, but yes, I love my son so very much and I am extremely proud of him.

      So much to say so little time... so long story short...  I took Nicholas to LaRonde on Saturday afternoon (for you out of towners, it is our Amusement Park recently purchased by 6 Flags).  My cousin had free tickets as well as front row seats for the International Fireworks competition we have had every year for as long as I can remember, Spain was the presenters that night.    Nicholas totally amazed me whit how brave he was, he wanted to do all the big people rides, the Monster, the boomerang, the Cobra all of them.  So his first ride was the Monster, I sat in front of him and when we got to the top of the first drop I managed to release my grip of death and I turned around to take a picture of his expression as we dropped - PRICELESS!!!  He laughed and giggled the whole rides and on the Boomerang (the second drop) as I turned around to ask him if he is ok and to remind him to breath (don't ask LOL) the roller coaster dropped in mid sentence and I just let out a scream while he is laughing his little head off.  I have tons of great pictures which I should be putting up tonight, I even filmed some of the Fireworks which were absolutely beautiful.  It is such a change to be sitting along the waterfront watching the fireworks compared to along the port or from my grandmother's balcony.  They have some in the water too, you never see those from across the river.  Anyway, I will post the pictures, I promise, tonight but for now I must get back to work.  P.S.  I had a visitor last night :D

      Note:  This thing is cool; it remembers the previous titles - heh.  So I have been calling, no wait, HARASSING this lady at the CCS for the last week, week and a half to find out where the picture frames are because my boss wants one.  So like 10 messages later (un-answered messages might I add) I reach her, the conversation went as follows (but in French):  Me:  Good morning, I have been trying to reach you for a while now RE the picture frames  Her:  The are 5" X 7"  (Note:  by the way, wrong size, the pictures we have are 8" X 10", just another small detail but anyway)  Me:  Well A* wants one to try out a picture in the frame which is why I have been calling you so often.  Her:  They are already gone to the Co-chairmen and i have no intention off getting them back.  Me:  Well why haven't you returned my initial call then to tell me?  Her:  I have no answering to do to you.  Me:  Fine, but meanwhile I am wasting my time calling you every day, leaving you messages that you do not return, so a call would have been appreciated.  Her:  I just found out today and your finding out when I am finding out, and I do not feel like answering your question. (Note:  Off the record her assistant told me 3 weeks ago that the frames were mailed already but we decided to let the bosses take the rightful wrap for once)  Me:  Ok then, well thank you very much and good bye now.  WTF - what bug crawled out of her ass this morning?  She has got to be the biggest bitch I have ever dealt with - EVER.  She is rude, ill-mannered and has absolutely no compassion or consideration for anyone.  The night of the event we were handing out the raffle prizes, these prizes ranged from $100,000+ to $5,000 and I needed the ticket number of one of the prize winners because I didn't want to hand him the wrong prize.  I asked her nicely if she could give me the ticket number of winner #6 and she gasped and started going on about how things are going to fast, she’s busy and has no time for this.  I replied, either you give me the number or i hand him the wrong prize, your choice.  She threw me the tickets and left me to go through the pile and find the right number.  {Sigh}  Tomorrow we have our final "Wrap-up Meeting" and I am not looking forward to bumping into her because I cannot be held responsible for my actions if she pulls this again.    Anyway, I have been on edge all day cause of her; I am happy to be out of there.  I really do not understand how someone can be that way, we are all working very hard for a wonderful cause and she makes it so very difficult for so many people.

      Yeah, what is that?  I can't find my drivers for my Digital Cam (Camedia 4.1) so I downloaded it and it says that it can"t install because I it cannot locate the RCP Server. {Sighs}  As I am fiddeling around with this, the WB Super Star is playing in the back ground... god these people are friggen HORRIBLE!!!  I sing better than they are, I sing better, dance better and yeah... what are they thinking?  I went to Java U for lunch, had a good tuna wrap and an Ice Mocaccino while Nicholas had a Chocolate croissant, the rest of my tuna wrap and a slush from Couche Tard.  Yes, he was there, the man of my dreams - ok not quite but he is the only man who has made me do a double take sinve, well in a long time.    One day I will get the courage to say something to him, either that or my son will do it for me.  As we walked in the Java U guy was holding the door for us, doesn't Nicholas stare at him and ask me, "Mommy, is that him?" and I am all like pushing him out saying "yes yes yes" trying to drown out his little voice and I thanked Java U guy and went on my way.  Kids, sheesh!!!  Well, it was a gorgeous day and lunch was Awsome!!!

      One more thing, got this from  urlLink Jade  on my friend  urlLink Sherry's   blog and figured what the hell!!! (I think this is the procedure of using someone else's stuff right?)  You can answer these in a comment, if you want.  1. Who are you? 2. We never met, but would you like to? (If I've met you: why did you want to meet me?) 3. Give me a nickname and explain why you picked it. 4. Describe me in one word. 5. What reminds you of me? 6. If you could give me anything, what would it be? 7. Ever wanted to tell me something but couldn't? 8. Are you going to put this in your weblog and see what I say about you? 9. What do you love like a fat kid loves cake? 10. What makes you come back here?

      So this is my first post at home in a LONG time since I got a semi-new computer and I can do this from home now, weeeeee.  So it may, or may not be a long one, just a friendly warning.  This week was my first week of the summer where my Fridays are off.  It was cool and all considering it is the Grand Prix weekend and all - but my boss figured she would pay me only on Monday.  Need I say more?  Friday night was my friend Isa's B-day so her boyfriend arranged a surprise dinner at Eduardo's on Laurier.  It was good, service was crap and the table next to us had a bunch of hot single guys - Isa, you need more Male Single friends, thank you!  We headed to Crescent Street after to try and manage the crowd, I enjoyed myself, a little excitement always gets me going.  We went for a few drinks (well they drank I danced and sipped on Coke ewwwwwwww) and it was a good night in general.  Today was Nicholas' Karate test, he passed to the next belt - YAY!!!  He is now a yellow belt and he is one proud little boy.  It was so weird seeing him all nervous and stressed out cause he is generally like me - very calm.  However, when they called his name and announced he passed he turned and gave me a quick glance and smirk sort of like a sight of relieve and turned back to bow to the Sensai and did a little skip back into line.  So to celebrate we went to Crescent - AGAIN (3 days in a row for me) and he checked out the cars, the girls, the singers and played some P2 then we headed for lunch at good old McDonald's.  We both had a Double Cheese burger with Bacon and he took his first bite... slowly chewed... kind of got this really serious look on his face... and then managed to mutter "This is SOOOO delicious".  Gotta love that kid!!!  So why am I up so late?  I dunno - was watching some TV, first a movie, then some porn, then SNL and decided I would catch up on some blog readings and logged on to Yahoo only to learn that I should be happy to know that Matt (Mr. Arkansas) and his Baby Mother split "for good" I believe his exact words were.  The only thing is I didn't realize that they were still an "Item".  Yes she lived there for the baby's sake and proper up bringing and so on, but I thought they had both made it clear that they were not an "Item".  This just goes to show A)  How much of a  POISON  I am (for you English folks FISH) and B)  I dunno, I'm friggen stupid maybe?  Anyway, what am I suppose to do with that?  I did call him to make sure he was OK and find out what happened (the curious instincts in me, can't help it) and find out what I should do with this tid bit since he seemed to think I would be HAPPY to find out.  I am not a mean, revengeful person, I just have needs and feelings to be respected and it hurts me to think that someone might think differently than that of me.  On that note... I am going to try and hook up some more RAMS to this baby, hook up my Digi Cam's software to post a few pictures of my weekend ok?  sounds like a plan, see you back here in oh lets say 10 minutes?  LOL

      Hmmm, I am having major IE problems on this computer lately.  I can't view my hotmail properly, can't send mail, I open pages that I view on a regular basis and everything is underlined or fucked up - WTF!!!@@@###???  Anyway, I installed a firewall after scanning for viruses and spy-ware... still not better.  Oh well, I guess I will have to start posting from home then, on my new and most definately IMPROVED computer.  Pssst, it has a CD burner... YAY! And I didn't pay a penny for the whole computer, how cool is that.    I know I am kinda jumping from topic to topic but I have to say, there are not too many blogs I follow but there is one in particular that I love reading, it's hilarious, and he always has something different to say... well ok, he is always talking about girls, getting wasted and sushi but at least its differnet girls - heh.  It's   urlLink Ryan's Blog   (also linked over in the side panel), I just hes funny, oh and them tatoos, yum.  What else, um, it's friggen hot out there, thank god I have AC in here or I would be dying of the heat.  I think I will go for a walk at lunch and catch some rays, maybe pick up a Veryberry Sorbet at Ben and Jerry's and walk around on Crescent.  Crescent Street is probably all set up for the Grand Prix weekend and I may get to see some wicked cars (and maybe even more so - thier wicked drivers ;) ).  Ok, well I don't want to be inside anymore so off I go!    P.S.  The spell check doesn't work either!!!

      It is gorgeous out there and I am cooped up inside :(.  This morning on my metro ride in to work I caught 2 guys checking me out, one I couldn't see (wasn't wearing my glasses) and the other was very attractive, I was checking him out too and our eyes locked and at that point I got very shy and turned away - dammit!  Well kids, it's Friday, it's beautiful and it's almost 5:00 p.m. and time for a couple of drinks!!!  So I bought 3 skirts this week, the short pleated schoolgirl type skirts, 1 black, 1 white and one with a black and white floral pattern.  I am 5'8 (pretty tall for a girl) and in them all you see are legs (I have received very good comments on how nice my legs are) but lets face it, I am 27 years old... no longer a schoolgirl, what was I thinking!!??!!  I really do look good in them though, I have been losing weight so shopping has been fun and I get to try them sexy little things now.  So guess what I am wearing tonight?  Ok I will tell you - the white skirt with a light yellow alter top, so in short, legs and boobs galore!!!  There is an artificial daffodil on my computer monitor, I think I am going to borrow it and stick it in my hair.  Hopefully if anyone checks me out this time I will not shy away!!!  Well, all in all it has been a pretty good week, hope everyone else has had nearly as good a week as I have.  Have a great weekend and take care.  P.S.  I will take lots and lots of pictures this weekend and come back and post a bunch so you can get a closer look into my life - hmmmmmmmmmm...

      So I managed to finally get some pictures posted, woohoo!!!  Lets see if that will bring along the hits and comments now, heh!!!  I promise to post an up to date one of me soon, and maybe of my apartment, my street, my son's school, the neighbor's lol - kidding, kidding.  I will try and get really interesting things however.  I took some time to catch up on some of the blogs I linked here, everyone is such a great writer, they all have there own style and I love every single one of them.  I wish I was a better writer and that my French side didn't take over my English side so much and restrict my English vocabulary knowledge so much.  Oh well... I got pictures... Who needs words when you've got pictures right?

      I'm not a perfect person There's many things I wish I didn't do But I continue learning I never meant to do those things to you And so I have to say before I go That I just want you to know  I've found a reason for me To change who I used to be A reason to start over new and the reason is you  I'm sorry that I hurt you It's something I must live with everyday And all the pain I put you through I wish that I could take it all away And be the one who catches all your tears That’s why i need you to hear  I've found a reason for me To change who I used to be A reason to start over new and the reason is You [x4]  I'm not a perfect person I never meant to do those things to you And so I have to say before I go That I just want you to know  I've found a reason for me To change who I used to be A reason to start over new and the reason is you  I've found a reason to show A side of me you didn't know A reason for all that I do And the reason is you

      So this Hello Blogger thing that I downloaded and installed, guess what? Ok I will tell you, it freezes when I launch it, I think I need more rams.  So still no pictures, however, I am {this} close to just using an FTP server, I think I read somewhere that I can post images that way.  Anyway, last night my son had Karate so I picked him up from school, rushed our little butts to the class and entering the parking lot I felt (and heard) something scrapping the underneath of my car.  I parked the car and lowered myself to see underneath the car and guess what? Ok I will tell you again, the Catalizer thingy was real low.  So in I go to Karate and when the Sensai (however it's spelled) arrived he told me "Your muffler is hanging low you know" and I was like "why are you looking underneath my car?"  He said, "I wasn't, I could see it from inside my Van".  Heh, my car is a little shit box but it gets me around.  On my way home from Karate, something fell off and was dangling and dragging on the road.  I drove very slowly and carefully to the garage close by and called my brother.  Meanwhile the gas boy got under the car and removed the Catalizer thingy that was hanging by a thread.  So my brother came by, tied the muffler and pipe that were hanging as well and leant me his car for today as he repairs my car.  His car has power steering, it's so nice to drive.  My car cost me 400$, a great deal for a first car with 2 sets of almost brand new tires (winter and 4 season).  It gets me around, it's a car, it's roomy, and cute.  The next car will definitely be more than 400$, bigger and tougher.  But as I said, it's a car, I like it, sure this is a bummer right now, but it's my first car.  Now I am just rambling on, so I am off to lunch.  Peace.

      Went out last night, was determined to have me some fun, and to hook up with someone.  I did both, sorta.  Fun - INDEED  Hooked up - he is a great kisser and I love his hands and so did the handcuffs ;)  Yay for me not needing anyone to have me some fun.  Yay for me being brave enough (drunk enough) to go start conversation with the tallest guy in the place (6'9) and it turning into somewhat of a rather funner and exciting evening.  Yay for me not giving a shit about what people were saying.  Yay for me thinking that this guy is fucking hot, has an original name and just as crazy as I am.  Yay for all the people who believe in a great time and releasing some stress with some cervesa and just being you.  So the plan is, pick up the sister and her friend and head to camp for the weekend.  Loads of sunbathing days at the pool in my new two piece suit.  Loads of beach volleyball, and more sunbathing.  Some camp fires, some smores and maybe some cute french dude will want to keep me company ;)  Bonne fin de semaine!!!

      You know what... this is the third time I edit this damned post... first one was too sappy, the second one was going to be brutal... and this one well... it is what it is.  For those of you who do not wanna hear about how I got lucky last night, please close this box, or move on to the next blog in your daily readings...  So yeah, dry spell is over, was ok, big mistake if you ask me but anyway, at the time my body seemed to think it was a good idea.  The mistake was giving in so soon, not him per say but whatever, shit happens.  Tonight, my regular is back, I think I made him feel guilty for neglecting my needs.  Either that or he really liked hearing about how badly I wanted him OR about how when we go for drinks or something tomorrow night, I am gonna go comando.  I think everyone around me is getting lucky, everyone seemed really happy and tired lately - heh.  Thats it, see not too graphic, not too many details, all done, til tomorrow that is!

      It has been 3 weeks since I have misplaced/lost my glasses.  The glasses I need when driving, working, watching TV, everything far.  Plus, I find I look good in them, when my hair is up I look like a teacher and when its down I look like a cool chick LOL.  Anyway, if anyone has seen my  perty  Red Diesel glasses please send them my way, I feel naked without them.  The funny thing is NEVER have I lost my glasses since I wear some (5 years or so now) and I had to loose my favorite pair - BLAH!

      Feeling Hot Hot Hot!!!  Yeah, the hottest day of this summer they say, the ever so dependent medialogists.  It just poured a hell of a lot, now it is all clear again.  Its fucking hot, and lately I swear a whole lot but I can't help it, even when I want to use frigg instead of fuck it comes out fuck and too fucking bad.  My best friend is at Jarry Park today having her yearly hospital Tennis Tournament, hope the rain does not make it there, and hope all goes well - good luck Didi!!!  Tomorrow I am off... plans so far are go bring Nicholas to day camp, go to the garage for the muffler who wont quite whinning and go get Nicholas from day camp, go swimming and hopefully go for drinks  with friends!!!

      Isn't it weird that the "players", the jerks, the married ones and the unfaithful people have the girlfriends/boyfriends, the multiple partners and or they always have someone around whether its serious, casual or mutual.  Now, I am NO angel, I have done my share of stupid and dishonest things in my time.  However, that being said, there is this "friend" of mine, in the process of getting a divorce if I am not mistaken, who fucking really knows anymore.  Well, he is seeing someone, still fucks his ex-wife here and there and at least has one other person too - I can testify to that.  Now, this girl he is seeing, well she did nothing wrong really but he assumed the worst and gave her a hard time about it and started feeling whatever it is men like him feel.  I am fucking sorry dude, but I feel absolutely, none at all, not one fucking ounce of sorrow, pitty or sadness for YOU because YOU is totally fucking around behind HER back.  But wait, this is the catch, HE loves HER and vice versa... what-fucking-ever!  Why people do this to each other I don't know, why people are blinded by people who do this to them, again I don't know and why they still manage to always have someone they can talk to, fuck or hang out with while poor souls like me are totally alone,  AGAIN  - say it with me, I DON'T KNOW!  8th wonder of the world, I tell ya.  P.S.  Please people, if you love someone, love and fuck only them, and if you don't then you go be by yourself while the good and decent people can have a chance at LOVE.

      Not at all in the mood to post but - I feel that if I don't get this off my chest I am going to blow.  My father has been in and out of the hospital doing series of tests.  He has been feeding us BS, last night I found out that the DR told him he saw spots on his Liver and it is most likely Cancer but he wants to run tests to confirm his already bad theory.  He was waiting ot have the final results before he told us?  Maybe - but we could have been there for him until thenm, during and after then.  So I was sad and upset about what I found out but I am usualy pretty good at denying shit or at least putting it way down there where no one can tell or where I don't think about it too much... until A)  My mother calls me and tells me I need to start thinking about funeral arrangements and calling to find out prices and so on.... or B)  I get the full facts from the DR.  When  option A happens before B it makes for a very bad night, day, week.  I know it is reality, shit happens - too much shit lately - but I was doing good with the thought that maybe my dad just contracted one of these weird bugs that no one else gets but him again and that the test results would be negative.  Or that yes he has spots but they are not cancerous or that it is caught early enough to be able to fix it and make it all go away.  Whatever the case may be, I was OK because I knew that August 18th I would know what the verdict is and that I would deal with it then.  My dad is only 57, he has never really been very sick besides hernias and his vasectomy... He has had freak accidents but nothing life threatning.  Everyone has been dying... both my grandmothers, my Aunt who was like my 3rd grandma, both my In-laws just a bunch of people, friends of friends and so on my mother who has had a heart attack at Christmas (she made it and is doing well thank god)- it's messed up.  I know I am getting ahead here, but it is NOT time for him, EITHER, of my parents to go.  It's not time for them to be sick and weak and suffering and not able to enjoy what they once did.  My father is always walking around, to the park, downtown, to his siter, my place... hes a big time walker - being in a hospital bed is going to distroy him, not the Cancer, he will feel trapped, lonely, unhappy.   To top it all off, he is the closest thing 9the only thing) to a father that my son has and I can't bare to tell him that Grandpa is sick, or going to die or whatever.

       Friday : Worked - Bleh, finished work, YAY! Went to my son's grandparents (where he was staying) and we had a great supper - home made pizza - then we made Pina Coladas (sp?). Then we played cards, we thought Nicholas how to gamble at Black Jacks hehe. Then we headed home and watched some TV, Nicholas fell asleep on the couch so I left him there and I went to bed.      Saturday : When Nicholas and I woke up we had breakfast, he watched a few cartoons and I took a quick shower before heading to the pool where we spent most of the day at. It was so humid and hot and felt so guhhhhhh so the cold pool water was so ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhh. Then we came home, made a light supper and just chilled all evening again, was kind of nice and relaxing actually.      Sunday : After getting up and doing the usual... Nick and I headed downtown to meet my Father. We checked out the Just For Laughs festival, there wasn't much going on besides a bunch of setting up and prepping up. So after walking around and getting really hot (even hotter and humider than Saturday) we went out separate ways. I headed to the pool again at Jarry Park where I met yup with my best friend and her sister and kids. The kids had a blast, the adults too, but we enjoyed whatever was left of the sun and the cool refreshingness of the pool. Then the kids played in the park a little, I have never realized how nice and how big that park is. On the land, there is a huge man-made pond like thing with a huge fountain in the middle, very nice for a romantic walk and also a great pick-nick area and even better sun-bathing spot. Then after all that swimming and running after the kids we went for a BBQ to another friend's house who happens to be leaving for Italy today (bitch). We, well I ate too friggen much, how can you not when you have her Italian mother practically forcing food down your throat. It was delicious but OMG I pigged out. Then of course she insisted that I take home leftover this and left over that, so I don't have to do much of a grocery this week - weeeeeeeeeeee. After all that food we looked through old pictures (I luckily was not in any because it was right before the time I met them and became part of their trio - phewwwwwwww). Some of Didi with the bangs and the 80's look... some of Josie with her teased up main and white socks LOL. We had a few good laughs, and some good memories. Then came time to drive home at 11:30 p.m. in the rain... and almost kill Nick and I - Blah - not so happy memories. So all that to say that I am friggen exhausted this morning, can't keep my eyes open and I am on a major coffee intake. I want my bed!!!     All in all it was a nice quite weekend and I got some major rays so YAY.

      So Mikey aka FF stiffed me yet another time.  Oh but wait, he did call, 2 hours after he should have been over.  He had to entertain clients and he mentioned how he had managed to get a way for a brief moment, should I have said "ok, come by"?... I think not.  Entertain them, they can suck you off too cause I sure as hell ain't anymore.    I really have nothing against the fact that this guy has a life, a career and can't always come running (which he never does anyway, it’s always about his needs).  But have the fucking decency to call me and let me know before your late, that you’re going to be late or not coming at all.  It's only common sense and courtesy, I don't ask for anything else.  Anyway, it's not like his coming by once a month or once every other month was satisfying for me anyway, I would probably appease my needs better by masturbating every night, so no biggie.  I have plans to go for drinks with a co-worker tonight... get shit faced actually, it has been a while and I feel that I need it.  What to wear what to wear... I wish I were a guy sometimes because all I would have to worry about is smelling good.  I can go for the short skirt but that means I have to shave my legs.  I can go for jeans or pants, but it is humid as hell and too hot.  Maybe I will wear my sporty pants (have no clue what to call them, a mix between jogging pants and track pants) with a tank top and that will be that.  Sounds like a plan, pretty good one too.

      My brother won tickets a few weeks back for the Evanescence show from a Molson contest so he gave them to my sister and I.  The show is Tuesday, July 20, and I'm kind of getting excited as I don't go to many shows (free or not).  I like a few of their songs (the ones played most on the radio) and I don't really know much more.  The opening bands are also ok, some I heard of some not.  Anyway, I am probably going to be one of the oldest ones there but I really don't give a shit.  Who knows, maybe I'll hook up with a young grungy type boy and I could show him a few trick ;) LOL  P.S.  It says restrictions: cameras, umbrellas, lawnchairs, ect...  Will they take my camera away if I do take pictures?

      Hello boys and girls, how are you all doing?  Good, well that's just great, so am I.  Mind if I share a little of my chatting experiences with you all?  Ok, so here it goes:  Way back when about 5 or 6 years ago Cindy discovered the world of chat.  She has met great people: friends; some handsome and very nice people: Geoff, Matt and Mikey; and some not so great people: psychos.  Well, in the last few days Cindy met No. 1 psycho and its been kinda freaky.  Started off all cool and nice and charming, but then got very demanding and wanting to meet and talk every night.  Even after my numerous comments about how I am not looking for a man on line... how I have no time to dedicate to anyone else but my son and how I was just not looking for a relationship.  Anyway, as I am typing this I am already getting bored with the topic.  So long story short, this guy was nutts, persistent and annoying as hell.  I am not looking for a relationship on line, I like chatting every now and then, kills time, some people are even interesting.  However, once I find out how fake you are and full of shit, I don't want anything to do with you.  So yeah, I need to get a life and meet real life people.

      Saturday an old co-worker, Nicholas and I head out to Lake George to pick up her daughter.  We decided to make a day out of it so we went to the Great Escape.  The day was great, the kids had a blast and even the parents.  I think my favorite part was the wave pool, it was cool, refreshing and just what I needed after hours of walking around in the strong sun.  I love hearing some of the American accents, they are cute.  This weekends phrase was "hot dog".  I heard a few people saying it and I would smile each time cause its just so damn cute.  Still a little tired from all the driving and stuff so I will post more later I guess.

      It's my weel off this week and so far I had a great weekend of beach volleyball and swimming and owrking on my now existing tan.  Yesterday I went and gave myself a few blondish streaks and it came out kinda BAD.  So today I colored my whole head of hair - Honey Dew or whatever it was called.  So far it seems light brown, very light brown, dark blonde-ish.  Anyway, I like it I just hope no one considers me a fake blonde now :(  Tomorrow my hair stays this color and Nick and I are most likely going to go check out the Jazz Festival down town maybe I'll get my hair cut and if it is really hot we will go swimming.  Gotta love being on vacation and just doing jack all all week long.  P.S.  I want my own personal trainer.  Hes gotta be into music, cute, have an accent, be tall, big and tanned and like beer yup yup.

      July 2, 2004  I haven't posted nearly as much as I would have liked to lately.  Been kinda busy with my mother being in town and work and Nicholas finishing up school and Karate and shit like that.  Anyway, I have had a few enlightening moments and I haven't been able to share with anyone... thats right, NO ONE.  Some more stupid than anything else but some kinda serious.  There are too many to list right now as I am running out of time, again, but the one that stuck out the most is my wanting to have a baby.  I had a baby scare this month (yes I use protection dammit, it's not always 100%).  Anyway, the baby scare, I have had 3 in the last 2 years I think and this is the first one that I actually hoped was more than a scare.  I know that having a baby right now would put my whole world out of wack and be a total disaster... anyway... to be continued gotta jet.   July 8, 2004  Ok, so back to the above, I want a baby.  I want my son to have a little brother or a sister and I want to have a little baby to take care of.  I know it's for all the wrong reasons and I also know that it ain't gonna happen anytime soon, but I was really hoping that I was pregnant.  What would I have told the father, I dunno... details I guess, but  I was ready to risk being the slut and a whore in my sister's eyes so I could have this baby.  Anyway, I know now that it really was not the brightest Idea I have had in a while but I guess the clock is ticking and I just really wanted to complete my little family.   I am not that unreasonable but everything has been like a roller coaster lately and I have not been myself.

      I had to post this; I got it from my friend  urlLink Sherry .  She is by far the funniest friend I have and I love it.  Anyway, enjoy!   How To Tell If You're a Canadian   You're not offended by the term "HOMO MILK"  You understand the phrase "Could you pass me a serviette, I just dropped my poutine, on the chesterfield."  You eat chocolate bars, not candy bars.  You drink Pop, not Soda.  You know what a Mickey and 2-4's mean.  You don't care about the fuss with Cuba. It's a cheap place to go for your holidays (not vacation).  You know that a pike is a type of fish, not part of a highway  You drive on a highway, not a freeway  You have Canadian Tire money in your kitchen drawers.  You know that Casey and Finnegan were not part of a Celtic musical group.  You cried when you heard that "Mr. Dress Up" died recently.  You get excited whenever an American television show mentions Canada.  You brag  to Americans that: Shania Twain, Jim Carrey, and Captain Kirk are Canadians.  You know what a touque is.  You design your Halloween costume to fit over a snowsuit.  You know that the last letter of the English alphabet is always pronounced "Zed"  Your local newspaper covers the national news on 2 pages, but requires 6 pages for hockey.  You know that the four seasons means: almost winter, winter, still winter and road work.  You know that when it's 25 degrees outside, it's a warm day.  You understand the Labatt

      Not a big poster lately, sorry, but I have been busy/tired/couldn't care less.  Between my mother telling me to make an appointment with the funeral home (note my father is not dead yet, nor will he be any time soon), and my brother and my sister being at each other's throats and my boss just being my boss - posting is the last thing on my mind.  It's fucked up how when one things goes bad, one piece of bad news - everything goes down hill from that moment on.  My father is sick, my family is falling apart, my mother is feeling helpless in the US and is trying her damned to have control over the situation but in the process is driving me nuts (I love her and thank her for trying I really do), money is short, someone who I have cared for  the longest time is getting a divorce - but wait - I never knew he was married, I can't seem to find a decent relationship and why - because I am a freak? crazy? not someone that anyone wants to be around right now? I don't care, nor do I want to put any efforts into anything that means me maybe being happy? All of the above perhaps...  Yes, some of you might be saying "things could be a hell of a lot worse" but in the last couple of years things have BEEN worse.  I cannot remember the last time I had a good year, actually, I can, the year my son was born!  Everything about him is awesome, the memories, the time spent with him, the whole picture.  I guess I AM lucky because he is what has been keeping me alive, going strong, and not allowing me to give up.  Anyway, this is just what happens when I think too much.  I love my life, I love my son and family, and even my career... I guess being the strong post is just getting to me and I need a post of my own, at least until I can catch my breath.

      So my father spent 1 day and a half at the hospital and this is the verdict:  He has Lung Cancer, it has spread to his Liver and possibly more we will know for sure on the 18th.  He cannot get operated or whatever, only chemotherapy (sp?) to help prolong his life.  So, I am not a happy camper for obvious reasons however, he is so hopeful and optimistic that it makes me feel the same.    I don't have much more to say, just figured I would give an update.
