      So I played some poker last Friday night.  I actually played from about 10pm until 6am Saturday morning.  It was wonderful.  And, now that I've been back, I can't wait to go again.  I made enough to pay my Sugardaddy back and have a bit left over for myself.  It's a beautiful thing to walk up to the cage with a couple racks of chips and watch the cashier count them up and convert 'em to cash.  Anyway, I played a little bit of Hold'em while I was waiting for a spot on the Half and Half table to open up.  At the HnH table they play 1 round of Hold'em and 1 round of Omaha and then do it all over again (a round being one full rotation of the dealer button.)  I had never played Omaha in the casino before so it was a great learning experience.  I decided that I'll play the HnH table in the future.  For those that don't know, allow me to explain Omaha.  It's kinda like Hold'em but not.  You get 4 cards in your hand and 5 community cards are dealt.  You make the best 5 card poker hand out of any 2 of your hole cards and any 3 of the community cards.  It's a beautiful game with more possibilities and bigger pots than the average limit Hold'em game.  I recommend playing online before you put any real money into a game of Omaha....and for God's sake, fold your freakin' hand if the board pairs and you don't have a full house...cuz someone does!!

      I'm going to be playing poker this weekend with a friend of mine.  He's bankrolling me so that I can play at the high limit tables.  I was supposed to go with him a few weeks ago but he had a bad run and needed some time to build up both his tolerance and funds.    I had a lot of success when I first started playing poker but it's been a while since I've played so I feel I need a bit of a refresher.  So for this installment of my blog (God I hate saying that word) I'm going to list a few rules and standards that I've reminded myself of in preparation for this weekends gaming.     A Strong Foundation    When I first started playing this was the strategy that paid for my wedding. ('s' denotes suited cards and 'x' denotes any card)    Early Position   Raise with AA, KK and AKs  from any position. Call with AK, AQs, KQs, and QQ and fold everything else.    Middle Position   Call with JJ, TT, 99, 88 AJs, QJs, AQ, KQ.    Late Position   Call with AXs, KTs, JTs, AJ, AT.  This is actually a little different from what I would play.  I believe I restricted myself to AA, KK, QQ, JJ, TT, AKs, AK, AQs, AQ, AJs, AJ, ATs, KQs, KQ, KJs, KJ, KTs, QJs, QJ, QTs, JTs.  It's a bit tighter in some areas and looser in others but it works for me.     Tells    I'm not gonna list every rule on tells that exists--if you want that you should ask Mr. Caro--but here are a few from the Bible of Poker Tells.  -Players are either acting or they aren't.  If they are acting, then decide what they want you to do and disappoint them.  -Players often stack chips in a manner directly indicative of their style of play.   -A trembling bet (a shaking hand while betting) is a force to be feared.  -The friendlier the bettor is, the more apt he is to be bluffing.  -A player glances secretly at his chips only when he's conSidering a bet--and almost always because he's helped his hand.  -A forceful or exaggerated bet usually means weakness.  -A gentle bet usually means strength  -Don't call Pokerclack. (Mr. Caro uses this term to describe the sound that's made when you put your tongue on the inside edge of your teeth at the top of your mouth, create some suction, and withdraw your tongue.  It's the sound made by an almost certain winner.)   So wish me luck.  If I make some money maybe I can actually mail JR his t-shirt.

      When I heard the news Saturday I thought of all the blogs that would be published about him and of what I could say about this man--as if more than 6 people read this thing.  I really don't know what to say about him.  He was definitely the greatest president of my lifetime but that's not saying much when you consider that I was born during the Carter administration.  So I've decided to let the Great Communicator speak for himself.  Here are a few quotes from the man himself.    Remember that every government service, every offer of government-financed security, is paid for in the loss of personal freedom...in the days to come whenever a voice is raised telling you to let the government do it, analyze very carefully to see whether the suggested service is worth the personal freedom which you must forgo in the return for such service.  Already the hour is late.  Government has laid its hand on health, housing, farming, industry, commerce, education, and to ever-increasing degree interferes with the people's right to know...We approach the point of no return when government becomes so huge and entrenched that we fear the consequences of upheaval and just go along with it.  Those who deplore use of terms "pink" and "leftist" are themselves guilty of branding all who oppose their liberalism as right-wing extremists.  No nation in history has ever survived a tax burden that reached a third of its national income.   A student at UC Berkeley once told him that it was impossible for the people of his generation to understand young people.  "You grew up in a different world," the student said.  "today we have television, jet planes, space travel, nuclear energy, computers...."  Reagan paused for a breath and said, "You're right.  It's true we didn't have those things when we were young.  We invented them."   When we start thinking of 'us' instead of 'them,' we've been in government too long.  We need a government that is confident not of what it can do, but of what the people can do.  I wasn't a great communicator, but I communicated great things.  And they didn't spring full bloom from my brow, they came from the heart of a great nation--from our experience, our wisdom and our belief in the principles that have guided us for two centuries.  We don't have a budget deficit because we, our people, aren't taxed enough.  We have a deficit because the Congress spends too much.  [America is]...a shining city on a hill...a tall, proud city built on rock stronger than oceans, windswept, God-blessed, and teeming with people of all kinds living in harmony and peace; a city with free ports that hum with commerce and creativity.   Margaret Thatcher said of him, "Sir, you strode into our midst at a time when America needed you most....  In a time of average men, you stood taller than anyone else.    In a time of politicians, you proved yourself a statesman. ...  It was not only that you were the Great Communicator---and you were the greatest--but that you had a message to communicate. ...  Not since Lincoln, or Winston Churchill in Britain, has there been a President who has so understood the power of words to uplift and to inspire.   In closing let me thank you, the American people, for giving me the great honor of allowing me to serve as your president.  When the Lord calls me home, whenever that may be, I will leave the greatest love for this country of ours and eternal optimism for its future.  I now begin the journey that will lead me into the sunset of my life.  I know that for America there will always be a bright dawn ahead.  - Reagan announcing to the nation his struggle with Alzheimer's disease.   It's been my honor to be your president.  - Reagan in his Farewell Address to the nation in 1989.   Nuff said.

      I wonder if it's all that uncommon for a husband and wife to have totally different senses of humor.  My wife and I never seem to agree on what's funny and what's not.  I like Seinfeld; she hates it.  I like The Simpsons; she hates it.  I like the Christopher Guest movies and, you guessed it--pun intended--she hates them.  It can't be that my sense of humor is uncommon.  If that were the case there wouldn't be writers like Larry David making millions with dry witted humor.  Seinfeld wouldn't be considered one of if not the best sitcom of all time if people like me were few and far between.    So something has to be wrong with my wife.  There has to be something inside her that is not allowing her to appreciate the humor of a well-done mocumentary.  There must be a switch in her brain that's been turned off and is stopping her from seeing the genius of The Family Guy.  Is it the years of legalistic religion that have bred the funny bone out of her?  Is she worried that she may turn into a rebellious nonconformist like her husband if she gives in to this primal urge?  These questions may never be answered because she just walked in on me and I have to stop writing now.

      So I decided to start a blog.  I hate blogs.  I think blogs are the new alt.country.  Every fat little girl over the age of 11 has a blog.  They're online diaries that you open up to the world and let them comment on each entry in hopes of fame and validation.  If you're not an 11 year old girl with an "online diary," you're a 20something year old wise-ass who wants to let everyone know that you're kewler than them because you knew about and loved (insert name of at-one-time-obscure-but-increasingly-popular musician/band here) before they had a video on MTV or had their song played on a Hewlett Packard commercial.  If this is still not a description of you then you must fall in with the rest of the pundits that can't get published in real life so you've turned to one of the hundreds of new blog sites in the hopes that one day the editor of your favourite major newspaper/magazine/DIY publication will stumble upon your genius and insist on having you on their staff.  I was inspired to start this thing by Jim Norton.  If you don't know him you should.  He will be coming into my life on a semi daily basis to brighten my existence with his stories of yellow discipline and self-abasement.  After reading his entries for the first few days I thought to myself, "Gee, I wish I could tell stories to my friends about my days events."  And after reading more of Little Jimmy's wisdom I could almost feel him giving me a tussle and saying, "Go for it, little buddy!"  So I've decided to go ahead and join the masses of too-cool-for-school hipsters with my very own blog.  Here goes nothin'.

      I'm hesitantly looking forward to the Jason Alexander sitcom on CBS this fall called Listen Up.&nbsp; I'm looking forward to it because it's based on the writing of  urlLink Tony Kornheiser --he's a writer for the Washington Post and the white guy on the&nbsp;ESPN show Pardon The Interruption.&nbsp; I'm remaining hesitant because of a few reasons.&nbsp; The first reason would be that CBS isn't necessarily known for their stunning work in comedy.&nbsp; Secondly, I've listened to Tony on the radio and read some of his stuff and I doubt that CBS and Jason Alexander--though I loved his work on Seinfeld--will be able to funny up to the caliber of Mr. Tony.&nbsp; The third reason and the real kicker is that Tony's sidekick on PTI will be played by Malcom Jamal Warner.&nbsp; A CBS sitcom with Malcom Jamal Warner?&nbsp; Seriously?&nbsp; Wasn't he on UPN last season?&nbsp; Has he done anything worth while since the Cosby Show?&nbsp; Does he still have the braids?&nbsp; You can't play Michael Wilbon with braids.&nbsp; The more I think about this I'm more hesitant than expectant.&nbsp; I can only hope that Larry David has a hand in it somewhere.

      I dreamed about my dad last night.  &nbsp;  My dad left my mom and I when I was 4.&nbsp; He was having an affair and left my mom for her or, more accurately—since she had a daughter—us for them.&nbsp; He kept in touch for the next 2 years or so but I haven’t seen him since 1986.  &nbsp;  I dreamed about my dad last night.  &nbsp;  I’ve thought about trying to find him several times.&nbsp; But what would I say?&nbsp; What good would it do if I actually found him?&nbsp; What would he say?&nbsp; What could he say?&nbsp; Could I expect that he would be a part of my life again?&nbsp; Do I want him in my life again?&nbsp; I don’t think about this a lot, but I did today.&nbsp; As I’m sitting here staring blankly at the screen I’m feeling pain that I thought was gone.&nbsp; I feel hatred.&nbsp; Somehow he must know how much he fucked up my life right?&nbsp; He can’t just be living life unaware of the hurt that he caused.&nbsp; And if he is unaware doesn’t that give me the right to hate him and wish him dead?&nbsp; Don’t I have every right in the world to wish for his eternity in hell?&nbsp; Wouldn’t I be perfectly justified in that?  &nbsp;  I dreamed about my dad last night.  &nbsp;  He was putting on an exhibit of some sort at one of the local malls.&nbsp; A friend of mine told me that he was going to be there.&nbsp; After some deliberation I decided to go and see him.&nbsp; There were hundreds of people around.&nbsp; He looked a little heavier than I remember but he still had that thick brown hair and the mustache.&nbsp; He looked like a used car salesman.&nbsp; I wasn’t sure what I was doing there but I was happy to see him.  &nbsp;  I walked up to him and he greeted me like he was greeting everyone else.&nbsp; He smiled and tried to make some small talk about the exhibit.&nbsp; I looked at him and said, “My name is Jacob Taylor.”&nbsp; His face sagged and the color drained.&nbsp; I stared into his eyes and waited for something.&nbsp; He brought me away from the crowd so that we could talk.&nbsp; He started telling me about his life and how God had changed him.&nbsp; He couldn’t bring himself to actually say, “I’m sorry,” but every word seemed like an attempt.&nbsp; We talked for a few minutes and I told him that I had to go because I had something to take care of across town.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Part of me wanted to stay with him and part of me was sorry I ever went.&nbsp; I wanted to believe all the good things that he was telling me but couldn’t.&nbsp; If God really had changed him like he said, wouldn’t he have tried to find me?&nbsp;  &nbsp;  I went across town to do what I had to do (I don’t know what I had to do.&nbsp; This was one of those details that is just known in your dream but is never fully explained.)&nbsp; When I was done I checked the time and saw that the mall would be closed soon.&nbsp; I decided to go back and try to see him before he left.&nbsp; I knew that I would probably never see him again.&nbsp; I headed back to my car.&nbsp; When I got to the spot I thought I had parked my car wasn’t there.&nbsp; I checked the next street and the next and my car was nowhere to be found.&nbsp; I kept looking for my car and looking at the time.&nbsp; If I didn’t find my car soon I would miss him and he would be gone forever, again.&nbsp; The dream ended with me still searching and quickly running out of time.  &nbsp;  I dreamed about my dad last night.

      I read a bit last night.&nbsp; I was planning on playing a few songs at a local open mic night—yes I’m one of those people—but I decided in stead to stay home and read as per my commitment to you my virtual audience and friends.&nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp;  Confessions is divided into Books and further into Chapters.&nbsp; The book reads like a journal.&nbsp; Each journal entry is a Chapter and, from what I can tell, the Chapters are&nbsp;grouped together&nbsp;by topics to form Books.&nbsp; I read the first 7 Chapters last night.&nbsp; I read them with a pen and notebook handy so that I could jot down anything that struck me.&nbsp; Here are a couple of things that jumped from the pages.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;    Restless Souls   &nbsp;  &nbsp;  Some of Augustine’s writing reminds me of the Psalms.&nbsp; The first chapter starts out, “You are great, O Lord and greatly to be praised: great is your power and to your wisdom there is no limit.”&nbsp; From that beginning he finds a wonderful balance of Davidesque praise and Kierkegaardian cyclical thought.&nbsp; He starts out praising God for his divine power and wisdom and wanders into a chicken-or-the-egg-like problem of which came first—knowing God or seeking God. &nbsp;  &nbsp;  During his praise/questioning he pens this line, “You arouse him [man] to take joy in praising you, for you have made us for yourself, and our heart is restless until it rests in you.”&nbsp; This immediately brought my mind to Hebrews 4:9-10 and the “Sabbath rest” that is available to us in Christ.&nbsp; I was reminded that I am created to be completed and satisfied by Him and in Him only.&nbsp; I can’t help but think of the “restlessness” that I’ve felt over the past few months.&nbsp; I’ve been so hungry for His presence that I can almost literally taste it.&nbsp; This makes me sick to think of because my hunger is only outweighed by my laziness.&nbsp; I’ve been sitting back on my ass and blaming my church for the shortcomings in my relationship when the reality is that I’ve done nothing on a personal level to draw close to Him.&nbsp; I’ve known all along that He desires that quiet time with me but, being the petty judgmental prick that I am, I’d rather focus on how much I hate the selection of Hillsongs being sung on Sunday morning rather than do something about the withered state of my personal worship life.&nbsp; Thank you, Mr. Augustine, for that well-deserved/needed slap in the face.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;         Finding Him  >  Figuring Him Out   &nbsp;  &nbsp;  The topic of this first Book is childhood.&nbsp; In&nbsp;Chapter&nbsp;6 Augustine&nbsp;questions the reality of his infancy.&nbsp; He&nbsp;wonders if he existed before birth.&nbsp; And if so, where?&nbsp; He theorizes and hypothesizes and comes to a conclusion of sorts, but this conclusion is not what&nbsp;caught my attention.&nbsp; It was the paragraph after&nbsp;the conclusion of his ramblings that made me smile.&nbsp; After he had come&nbsp;to the end of what I can only guess was a brilliant train of thought, he said this:&nbsp;&nbsp;     What matters&nbsp;it to me if someone does not understand this?&nbsp; Let him too rejoice and say, "What is this?"&nbsp; Let him rejoice even at this, and let him love to find You while not finding it out, rather than, while finding it out, not&nbsp;to find You.  This statement hit home for me.&nbsp; For a great thinker such as Augustine to dig so deep into a thought and, after finding closure in the matter, add this disclaimer is overwhelmingly refreshing.&nbsp; He is in essence saying that none of what he just said matters if the reader doesn’t find God in the process.&nbsp; He prays that the reader would rejoice in his misunderstanding and fall deeper in love with the Father rather than have everything figured out and lose sight of God.&nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp;  I've never been one for long drawn out thought.&nbsp; My idea of getting closer to God doesn't involve my intellect as much as it does my heart.&nbsp; I believe God comes to each of us in different ways.&nbsp; He has no trouble adjusting Himself to left-brained and right-brained people.&nbsp; I shy away from theological debates.&nbsp; I'd rather be lying on the floor in a worship service just soaking Him in.&nbsp; The amazing thing about Augustine's statement here is that, while considering such a headache-inducing matter, he realizes that "getting it" is not as important as finding Him.&nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; I'm starting to heart Augustine.

      I'm really bad about buying books and never reading them.  I'll see something in a bookstore or specifically search for it online and buy it with every intention of gleaning every ounce of wisdom from it's pages, and never touch it again.  It will sit with the rest of my books forming with them a monument to my short attention span.  I may one day notice it under the layers of dust and pick it up to read a page or two but I inevitably lose interest and my place until the next time I notice it and start all over again. I have several books--and by several I mean about 30--that I am "in the middle of."  One such book is  The City of God  by St. Augustine.  I've started it a number of times and forgotten about it.  I've picked random spots in the middle of the book and had the same results.  I know this book contains greatness but I can't seem to string enough days of diligence together to get into it and through it.  I don't remember why Augustine was on my mind the other day but as I was thinking about him I was reminded of the unfinished book on my shelf.  So I picked it up on the way to the bath--um, I mean, my office and started reading it again.  I noticed this time that Thomas Merton wrote the introduction.  I have come to love this man's writing so I decided to read his intro before I dove in to Augustine's work again.  In his intro, Merton suggests that anyone reading Augustine for the first time should start with  Confessions  before they read  City .  He said that this would introduce them to Augustine and they would be better equipped to tackle Augustine's defense of Christianity.  I don't consider myself an Augustinian n00b, but, given my history and the fact that I've never actually completed anything the man has written, Merton was talking to me.  So after I was done in the office I went and picked up  Confessions --another one of the skimmed-through volumes of literary brilliance that lie dustily on my shelf.  I've decided to read both of these works in the order suggested by Merton.  The reason I'm putting this in my blog is that I'm going to write a semi-daily report on what I've read.  This will hopefully keep me accountable and insure the completion of the task before me.    Feel free to send me threatening emails and pipe bombs to keep me on track.

      I just got a phone call from my wife that my car is now paid off!  We were considering taking some cash out of our savings to pay it off and avoid a balloon payment.  She did it over the phone this morning and it's over with.    We're gonna take the next several car payments to build the savings back up.  It should be fully replenished by the time we're moving.  This may not matter to anyone but I'm flippin' stoked!

      I have these two guys that come in to my store from time to time.  They are both in their 70s and both deeply religious.  I've had several conversations with each on various theological topics.  One of the guys is a Jehova's Witness.  Our first conversation was on the existence of Hell.  He told me that no one was going to hell.  Those that were lucky enough to be alive or resurrected when Jesus came back would live forever in the new Earth.  If you weren't one of these lucky ones you were either in the 144,000 people that would get into Heaven or you were left to sleep for eternity.  But no Hell.  We've had conversations about the Trinity (he's a Binitarian.)  We've talked about works and grace.  Some of the things we've agreed on and others we haven't but we always have very good conversations.  The other guy is, from what I can gather, a non-denominational, full-gospel type guy.  We've had several conversations about several things and we usually agree.  But there is something different about him that I find disturbing.  Every time we talk he has a way about him that says, "I'm right and anyone who doesn't agree is hellbound."  He has this air of superiority about him that makes me want to vomit.  Even thought I may agree with what he's saying, the way in which he says it turns my stomach.  The JW will talk to me and answer my questions.  He'll show me where he thinks I'm wrong and try to get me to see his point of view.  The full-gospel guy does the same but there's a huge difference in the two.  The JW, no matter how wrong I think he is, always seems as though he truly cares about me and my search for truth.  He takes the time to share with me what he knows and it's always done in love.  Love.  This is the difference between the two.  Whether the JW's theology is totally screwed up or not, I think he's closer to the character of Jesus than the full-gospel guy who would rather scream damnation at someone than buy them a meal and love them.  Far be it from him to show compassion for someone that doesn't line up with his doctrine.    It makes me wonder what God thinks of these two men.  I wonder if God sees the heart of the men and it overshadows their doctrinal miscalculations.  I wonder if God weeps when His words come out of a mans mouth coupled with hatred.  I wonder if God smiles when a mislead man with a good heart does everything he knows to do to show Jesus' love to another human being.  I wonder what He'll say to each of them when it's all said and done.

      There's this thing that pastors do when they need affirmation and crave audience participation. I'm sure you've heard your pastor say something like, "And all God's children said...," and the congregation says, "Amen." Or maybe your pastor likes to get you to play Fill-In-The-Blank. He'll read a scripture and you'll follow along until he stops reading and then you all say the word that he stops on in unison.  Whenever my pastor does this I usually lean over to my wife and say in my best brainwashed zombie voice, "Must drink the Kool-Aid."
