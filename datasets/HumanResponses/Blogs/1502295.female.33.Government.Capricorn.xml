       Why do I lie awake at night,  without the possibility of a quiet reflection-  only racing thoughts and fears?   Why is raising a child so exhausting, demanding,  but I wouldn't trade the experience for anything?   Why do I have to kiss so many toads before I find my prince?   Why do so many people shop at Walmart?   Why do people kill others?   Why don't teachers make as much as professional athletes?   Why was OJ acquitted?   Why does chocolate taste so good?   How is it that a warm, rainy day reminds me of Belgium,  and my heart longs to return?   Why does my cello remain unplayed?   Why am I always behind the 8 ball?   Why was George W. Bush elected and why would  anyone with integrity vote Republican?   Would winning the lottery help me sleep better at night,  and would it change my most precious relationships  for the better or worse?   Will I have another baby and how will it  change Joshua as a person?   Why can't I move to a cabin in the woods to live a simple life?   Would happiness still elude me, or would  freedom from distractions finally allow my mind to relax?   What is a Scooby Snack?   Why did the Howells take suitcases filled with money  for a 3 hour tour and why couldn't the Professor  find a way home if he could make a radio from a coconut?     © 2002 by ASH

       I can carry 5 grocery bags, plus my 6 pound purse,    and hold my son's hand while walking to the front door.    I don't care if he wipes his nose on my shirt.    I feel a deep heartache when I see a couple pass me,    his arm wrapped tightly around her waist-    as an old woman would wrap a worn comforter around herself to keep out the chill,    and warm the winter in her heart.    I know that winter-    and no comforter will reach that place deep in my soul.    But surely my son's sticky fingers are wrapped around my paper plaster heart,    decorated with dry macaroni and glitter.     © 2002 by ASH

       The night has come quickly    and the stars are giving light,    as the moon, she gently rises    to her proud and glorious height.     &nbsp;   The windows of the city    shine brightly with their beams.    People pass under street lamps    to a warmer place it seems.     &nbsp;   A cold wind blows in earnest    and shakes the trees alive.    The leaves are falling to the ground    as the chilling night arrives.     &nbsp;   I see the hurried people    rush to their fireplace.    Yet in their dash they will ignore    the night that I embrace.     &nbsp;   The night of freshly fallen leaves    of dreams on shooting stars.    The feet on grass, the hands in reach,    but eyes on brilliant stars.     &nbsp;   © 1993 by ASH

       The little white church in Honduras    with palm trees giving shade    to all who pass along the road    that oyster shells have made.     &nbsp;   The road that leads down to the beach    where one can always find,    an eager chase, children abound    under the bright sunshine.     &nbsp;   The bells that call the sinners home    that I will all ignore;    for my salvation I have found    upon this foreign shore.     © 1989 by ASH

       In the breadth between   the weakest flutter    of a dying bird's heart-    &nbsp;  to the steaming breath    of a racehorse's    thundering finish,    &nbsp;  You'll find the depths of love.    &nbsp;  © 1993 by ASH   &nbsp;

       Do you know that sadness lump in your throat?    When you think of your loved one with another?    Your private temple has been replaced.    I want to light an altar to God,    clench tiny statues of saints and Buddha.    Will the Blessed Mother wipe away my tears?    Hang prayer flags as high as I can, burn incense,    feel the comfort of the clicking rosary.    Would these keep the devil, that is despair, away from my sanity?    I will chant, sing and pray to the Higher Power,    if only I may be released    and return to my enlightened state.     &nbsp;   © 2002 by ASH

       I feel so sad today.    I miss the feeling of knowing someone loved me.    It was you.    Now all we do is exchange terse emails to each other.    I eat, or smoke to rid my mind of you.    Last night staying awake until I was almost asleep on my feet.    Anything so I won't be imagining you holding someone else.    I cannot give you the victory of learning how I've been broken by you.    And I won't or can't let anyone pick up the pieces of my shattering.     © 2002 by ASH

       the ice came alive.    everytime I looked.    They were red ancient beasts    and it unnerved me to bring my    mouth so close to it.     © 2004 by ASH

       Night tears are falling, stars left behind.    I put on my old flannel pajamas,    No more silk teddies.    I can't focus on the TV, but music draws me.    But only the sad ones that make my little boy cry.    He doesn't understand it but those sad chords    have a power over the heart, one can't control.    The bitterness in me, over wasted time, empty promises.    Yet all I can do is long for the touch of your hands on my skin    Of the feeling of knowing there is someone who so truly you.    When all that was ever involved was a dupe, me.    And all I can wish is for strength and the sad songs to fly past me.     © 2002 by ASH

       The interesting thing is not that I would stand barefoot in a field,    playing catch with my son and stop to look at the pink sky,    as my chest grows tight to hold back my tears,    but that I would want to take everything that reminds me of you,    a picture, a candle, a necklace-    and chew them, grind them with my teeth    to swallow them.    It is taking all of my strength not to follow through with this,    but to stay in my darkened room,    feel the comfort of a good pen on paper,    and rage against this dying dream.     © 2002 by ASH

       Some dreams aren't meant to come true.  Growing up, I dreamed of being a princess.  Every Halloween I'd wear my fairy princess dress  with a crown made by my father,  dreaming little girl dreams  on those magical autumn nights.  As a teenager, my dreams seemed more tangible.  I'd be an actress, or a lawyer, or both.&nbsp;  As long as I could prove myself,  show my abilities to all-  I was strong, opinionated, and ready to take on the world.  After college, I realized  I didn't have any more dreams.  Somehow they had faded away when I wasn't looking  And I was left holding an empty trick or treat bag and a tin foil crown.     © 2004&nbsp;by ASH

       With wonder and joy, I watch you grow    from a baby holding his arms out to me,    to a little boy running away.     &nbsp;   Now I'm holding my arms out to you.     &nbsp;   When I hold your strong little body close-    feel your heart racing with exuberance for life-    I can't believe what a gift you are to me.     &nbsp;   You are the new day!    To see you smile, hear you laugh, watch you run    witness your emotions-is a privilege.    I love your anger and outrage-    Your spirit is fierce, and I honor that.    May it never be broken, my amazing son-     &nbsp;   Soar with the eagles as you were born to do.     ©&nbsp;ASH &nbsp;    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;     &nbsp;

           1.&nbsp; I am an excellent mother.   2.&nbsp; I write sad, yet thoughtful poetry.   3. I wrote my 1st poem in 4th grade. It was about a girl running through dark alleys to escape a mean dog. My teacher accused me of plagiarism, but my parents stood up for me, so the teacher backed off.   4. I have 1 sister and my parents are still married.   5.&nbsp; My family is very close.   6.&nbsp; I consider myself spiritual, but not religious.   7.&nbsp; I prefer reading the KJV of the Bible..especially for the gospels and the psalms.   8. I was raised Episcopal, but only attend church sporadically with my son.   9.&nbsp; I think I have ADD.   10. I know I have fibromyalgia.   11. For those of you who don't know what that is, check this out:  urlLink http://www.fmaware.org/fminfo/brochure.htm    12.&nbsp; People might think I was lazy if they saw my house.   13.&nbsp; I'm not lazy, I just have different priorities.   14. I'm a lover, not a fighter.   15. I have several close friends, I have had since childhood, and I would do anything for them.   16. I've never understood people who have 20 close friends. How can they know that many people so well?   17. I wish I could be more creative on my job.   18. I've been to Canada, Mexico, Honduras, Costa Rica, France, England, Germany, Luxembourg, BELGIUM, and Holland.   19. I miss Belgium.   20. I miss my second family there.   21. I have really long brown&nbsp;hair.   22. My belly button is pierced.   23. I wish I could home school my son. I don't think public school is giving him what he needs.   24. If I won the lottery...I'd yank him out of school, and take a loooong trip to Belgium.   25.&nbsp; I'd get liposuction on my tummy.   26.&nbsp; I can never thank my parents enough for all the support they have given me through the years...I can only hope my son appreciates me in the same way.   27. I am a strong liberal Democrat--and pray daily for Bush to be defeated...soundly!   28.&nbsp; I feel loved by a number of people.&nbsp;   29.&nbsp; I have always felt alone in a group of people.&nbsp;   30. Parties exhaust me.&nbsp;   31.&nbsp; My dad and I both get head tingles at certain times of great happiness--I love them.&nbsp;   32.&nbsp; I am excited by most things&nbsp;historical--wish I had the history channel.&nbsp;   33.&nbsp; Though I consider myself shy, I do shockingly well at public speaking--got A's throughout speech class in college.&nbsp;   34.&nbsp; I kissed Gene Simmons--yeah..he's a good kisser! ;-)   35. I wish I had my mom's knack for all things financial, and my dad's knack for languages...&nbsp;   36.&nbsp; Though I consider myself open minded, I do hold grudges.&nbsp;   37.&nbsp;&nbsp;I know all the words to&nbsp;The Jabberwocky.&nbsp;   38.&nbsp; I&nbsp;speak&nbsp;French,&nbsp;some Spanish and a little Portuguese (mostly just words I cannot repeat here)&nbsp;   39.&nbsp; I love animals, brake for them always, and to my knowledge have never hit one. I feel guilty using insecticide on all bugs except ants.&nbsp;   40.&nbsp;&nbsp;I won a scholarship in 12th grade for writing.&nbsp;   41.&nbsp; I love helping underserved populations--the elderly, refugees and immigrants (all kinds).&nbsp;   42.&nbsp; I really don't like the taste of alcohol. I got spoiled living in France by wonderful, heady wines...cannot abide by most American wines. Do not like beer. Do not like hard liquor unless it is seriously masked by fruity, creamy beveridges.&nbsp;   43.&nbsp; I loved the Electric Company.&nbsp; Hey you guys!   44.&nbsp; My sister and I can speak in our own language.&nbsp; We know most of the dialogue to Scrooged. It drives my dad crazy. The dickens out of people..Nobody gets me.&nbsp;   45.&nbsp; Growing up I wanted to be an actress or a lawyer. Now, I am neither. For a time, I wanted to be an archeologist. Wish I had pursued that more than anything else.&nbsp;   46.&nbsp; I am terrible at math, still count on my fingers...I blame it on an awful teacher in grade school who ripped up my paper in front of everyone&nbsp;saying I had done the problems wrong.&nbsp;   47.&nbsp; I don't cook, and I rarely bake.&nbsp; But I make a mean homemade pizza--when I have the time...&nbsp;&nbsp;  48.&nbsp; I used to collect beanie babies. Mostly the bears and seasonal ones (for Valentine's Day and Christmas). Now they are collecting dust.   49.&nbsp; I have days when I am very sad.   50.&nbsp; It's rare to find people who truly understand me.   51. People think I am mostly happy. I'm not.  52. I still&nbsp;have the teddy bear, Paddington, that I grew up sleeping with. And I have my baby blanket.  53. When I am really stressed I will pick off all my fingernails. They grow fast.   54.&nbsp; Even though I've never been addicted to them, I LOVE the smell of cigarettes.   55.&nbsp; I have asthma.   56.&nbsp; But I never use my inhaler.   57.&nbsp; My first rock concert I ever went to was Prince-the Purple Rain tour, with Cynthia. Her mom came with us. How cool was that?  58.&nbsp; All my friends' parents like me.   59. I love books involving suspense, history and mystery.  60.&nbsp; I would love a house with a library one day.  61.&nbsp; I wish I had a large house where I could have more pets-some exotics, birds, dogs and reptiles.  62.&nbsp; I'm an autumn. I look good in oranges and browns.   63.&nbsp; At 5'8" I'm the shortest one in my family.   64.&nbsp; I also have small feet proportional to my height.  65.&nbsp; I love bread. Especially fresh bread with butter on it.   66.&nbsp; I snore...on occasion.&nbsp; Like days ending in y.  67.&nbsp; I can't help it. My doctor told me I have a small back of the throat.  68.&nbsp; I also have unusually large pupils.  69.&nbsp; I love going to the movies.   70.&nbsp; I worry too much.   71.&nbsp; I'm an ENFP, but I think I'm more of an I.   72.&nbsp; I used to have a crush on John Travolta, back in his Welcome Back Kotter days.   73.&nbsp; I LOVED Grease.&nbsp; How hot was he singing Greased Lightening?  74.&nbsp; I'd love to have my poetry published one day.   75.&nbsp; I wish my grandparents were still alive.&nbsp; I miss them all so much.   76.&nbsp; I wish I had thick skin.   77.&nbsp; Is there anything as delicious as brie on a baguette?  78.&nbsp; Only my mom's pinuche icing on angel food cake.  79.&nbsp; I wrote a fairy tale in 10th grade. I wish I knew where it was.  80.&nbsp; I'm divorced.  81.&nbsp; I'm terrified of flying. Well more of crashing.  82.&nbsp; I love Harry Potter, and LOTR.   83.&nbsp; If I could afford one luxury item, it would be a maid.  84.&nbsp; I think most people are fake. And that bothers me. A Lot.   85.&nbsp; All my female friends are strong women. I think I'm attracted to them because my mom is the strongest woman I know.  86.&nbsp; I read 880 words a minute.   87.&nbsp; I don't like to shave my legs, and only do it when absolutely necessary.  88.&nbsp; I love the smell of warm clean laundry.  89.&nbsp; I have tmj.  90.&nbsp; I love hanging out in cafes. But haven't been able to do that much since my son came on the scene.  91.&nbsp; I'm terrified of things that dart or move quickly like toads, mice and rats. Spiders don't thrill me, but for the most part I leave them alone.   92.&nbsp; I wish I could have a rabbit.&nbsp;   93.&nbsp; I love sleeping with the window open.  94.&nbsp; I haven't won many things, except when I was a kid, I won a huge jar of candy corn for guessing the closest to the right number in it.&nbsp; And tickets to a Boston concert.&nbsp;   95.&nbsp; I wish I had Halle Barry's body.   96.&nbsp; I do not like yard work.   97.&nbsp; My favorite seasons are spring and fall.   98.&nbsp; My favorite date is eating crabs at Ocean City.&nbsp;   99.&nbsp; I believe in God.   100. I didn't understand the depth of love, until I had my son.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;                   &nbsp;
