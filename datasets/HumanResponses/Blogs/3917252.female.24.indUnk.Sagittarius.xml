      Just getting up. I have to go to work in about 45 minutes. I am doing ok. I have lost about 5 lbs. on my diet. Still trying to reach my goal. Hopefully by the end of the summer all be lookin good.&nbsp; Ha ha!&nbsp; Hung out with Amy ( that's one of my best friends from way back) on Monday nite. We just rented some movies and stayed at her house.&nbsp; Her "friend" Dan came by then some other friends Joseph and Kyle.&nbsp; I have met them all before.&nbsp; Kyle is really cute and I wouldn't mind going out with him.&nbsp; But I still keep thinking about Drew all the time.&nbsp; He called the next day and said he was feeling a little jealous about me hanging out with other guys.&nbsp; It was very sweet and he talked about us getting back together.&nbsp; But I can never really trust what he says. Sometimes he might talk about it just when he's feeling lonely or something and then turn right around and go back to the way the was being.&nbsp; Well I guess we will see what happens.&nbsp; Got to go.

      Hey, just checkin in. Forgot to write yesterday.&nbsp; Started my diet.&nbsp; I did the pilates 20 min. workout yesterday.&nbsp; I can really feel it today in my abs today.&nbsp; Guess thats a good thing. Did really good for my first day.&nbsp; Didn't crave very much.&nbsp; Even went to the movies and was offered popcorn I didn't have to pay for and refused.&nbsp; Good job for me!!!&nbsp; Drew seemed impressed by that.&nbsp; I'm like a popcorn feen at movies.&nbsp; We went and saw a free showing of Napolean Dynomite.&nbsp; It was really good.&nbsp; Really really funny!&nbsp; I laughed pretty much throughout the whole movie.&nbsp; Weird thing happened though.&nbsp; Drew and I were standing in line and my brother just comes waltzing in.&nbsp; Funny!! He was their with some of his friends.&nbsp; They came all the way from Seymour, IN to Castleton.&nbsp; About a hour and a half drive just to see a free show to.&nbsp; So I got to see my brother, that was nice.&nbsp; He's about to move out to California in August.&nbsp; He wants to be in the movie industry.&nbsp; I'm gonna miss him a lot!&nbsp; Well guess I'd better get off here.&nbsp; Just got off work.&nbsp;Work sucks!!!!!!!!!!!&nbsp; I'm going to go over to Drew's tonight.&nbsp; Don't know what will do.

      Feeling a little weird tonight.  Not sure where my life is heading!! But are we really supposed to know?  Life just seems to suck most of the time.  Yuccccccccccccck!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Things I've messed up in life.  I divorced my husband when I wasn't sure.  I've lied to him in the passed about people I've been with and things that I was embarassed to tell him when we first got together.  It was very hard for him to trust me but he overcame it after awhile.  He was very good to me most of the time.  We had lots of fights when we were together but we had some very very good times also.  I've done a lot of bad things I feel sorry for.  But I know it's the same with him also.  I hope I can regain his trust once again someday.  I guess we will just have to wait and see.   We all make mistakes.  I think I make quite a few more than most.  I'm trying to learn from everything I've done. I guess thats all that I can hope for.  And true love one day...

      So yesterday was feeling a lot better about myself.  Made some good plans about changin my life some.  Still going to start my diet tomorrow!  Not going to back out on that!!!  Just talked to Drew on the phone.  Asked him if he wanted to come over and he started saying I was treating us like we were a couple again.  I just enjoy his company and like hanging out with him.  Yea sure I think about us getting back together but understand he needs some time. Oh maybe I push him to hard sometimes.  I don't know.  This probably doesn't make much since today. Just kind of blubbering about stuff.   My parents came by today.  They had been on a five week extravaganza out west and were making there way back home.  They looked pretty tired of traveling.  I bet their glad to be back home in the good old state of Indiana.  Weighed myself this morning I think since I started my period yesterday it made me gain two pounds cause I was up to 147 yuck!!  But I'm sure it will go back down.  Keep a positive attitude! Well fixin to watch a movie maybe i'll get on and talk later.

      Never really done this kind of thing before. Posted a journal online,  but wanted to try it out to see if it could make me organize myself a little better.  First off I'm 24 yrs. old and have made a lot of foolish mistakes.  Now I don't believe in regrets because I realize that if I had not made any of my mistakes I would not be the person I am today.  But I do feel sorry for the ones I've loved and hurt in the process of becoming that person. I just recently got a divorce.  Which I believed we moved into the divorce a little fast but my husband wanted it done as quickly as possible.  I was the one who originally left him but he took the reins and got the lawyer and had it done fast. So we are now divorced but I still love him and care for him deeply.  He is in some weird state which I can not fully understand yet.  I know he still loves and cares for me and enjoys my company but he wants to keep looking for this perfect someone he had in his head that i'm sure he will never find.  But what do I know! The worst part is he feels he's not sexually attracted to me anymore.  True we've been together for six years now and I have gained a little weight, well really just becomed less toned than I used to be.  And I totally understand why he would not enjoy me as much as he used too.  I wish myself that I would look better so I could feel better and more attractive.  So I have been trying to exercise lately and I would like to go back on my atkins diet.  I thought if I kept this record online it would help keep my on it.  Also I could express my thought here.  So starting on Thursday I am starting my diet.  I can't start tomorrow because my parents are coming to visit and they will want to go out so it will be my last binge kind of.   So here it is........................ I weigh...............145lbs ugh I said it!!!! Need to lose at least 30, 115 is about ideal. So thats my goal.  I also need to exercise even more than I have been to get more toned. So 4 times a week at least!    Ok well now I've stated my goals.  My ex-husband and I have been spending a lot of time together and I have really been enjoying his company most of the time. But we really are very different people.  The best thing I have learn since the divorce was how to be more honest with him about my feelings and inner thoughts. I've always been a pretty closed up person.  Another reason to start this was to help me become a little more open with myself and everyone.  Not try to hide so much of how I think or feel.  Drew(that's my ex) and I had a conversation last night about how hard life is and that all he really wanted was to find happiness.  I was trying to explain how life is never really easy and it will always be work.  But I do believe that their is some happiness to be found, it's just where to find it is whats hard I guess.  Truly I believe to find true happiness is that you have to find it within yourself first.  Make yourself happy and you could be happy throughout the rest of your life as well.  Well thats all I have to say for today.
