      Hey again everyone! Just thought I should pop in and give you a roundup of what's been going on in my life, after all, that's the point of having a blog! :)  Well, not really much interesting to talk about lately, we've been doing our "mocks" for year 10... something which I'll quite happily tell any teacher is a load of poo.  I mean, we have Mocks in year 11 as well, and then proper GCSE's, surely that's enough? But no, they'd much rather stick us in a hall and get us to fill in badly photocopied papers from the late 90's than let us learn something useful!! >:(  Well, I have revision for an English Literature mock now, so I won't have time for anything worthwhile... Point proven I think! Until next time, bye bye! xx

      Another rant - I'm not doing very well am I!?  This time it's about hot weather, and how much I hate it! It's been muggy all day, you know, when it's not  that  sunny, but it feels like you've been left in a roasting tray? It's my least favourite type of weather, even ahead of that nasty misty rain that  only  happens when you're on a  motorway !!  You're probably wondering why I hate hot weather so much, well you can  blame my dear 'ole Dad for that one!  You see, he's one big bundle of Migraines... and I seem to have inherited it from him! If only I was adopted!!!!!!!  So, whenever It's hot, I get a headache and a bad mood. It's horrendous... and I'm getting pretty fed up with it now! I'm looking forward to the time I'm old enough to get the pills dad takes, they seem to do a good job.  Anyway, rant over for now... and I'd just like to drop a  "Thankyou"  in here for my very good friend  urlLink Simon Fry  for making a new logo at TDR Forums! Very nice!  Bye for now everyone, more whinging soon! xx

      Right then, I was hoping I'd avoid ranting where possible in the Diary, but this is one I couldn't resist. As the title suggests, it's about Politics.  I remind myself of the bloke on that advert. You know:  "I don't do Politics" . The problem is, I  want  to know more about what's going on.  I've always been of the opinion that people of my age (15) should be given access to this sort of information, I mean, I'm the sort of age that's too old for  Newsround  but a little too young to be able to confortably watch things like  Newsnight .  See my point? There should be a website or a TV programme with news aimed at people in thier "middle-teens", but nobody seems to have bothered.   On a lighter note,  Simon finally managed to get me that capture I've been asking for of an episode of Big Brother, so we can package it all up and send it to our friends outside the UK. I was really pleased with how the Bedsit idea worked out in the end, I think Channel 4 deserve to get some credit for a good idea once in a while!  So, that's it again from me, before I bore you all to death! Hope you have a nice day, and see ya soon! xx

      Well hello there everyone! So, what do I say on my first ever Blog? You'd think after I bothered to set it up, I'd have  some  ideas! Apparently not!  I'll be using TheDiaryRoom's Diary to record my innermost thoughts and feelings, and giving you a brief idea of what's going on in my life day-to-day.   Hopefully  you'll find some bits entertaining, and it'll help people (especially my online friends) get to know me a bit better!  So now moving on to some of my "goings-on", I'm starting to lose weight (finally) and am doing pretty well so far! I'm aiming to lose half a stone before Mum and Pat (my stepdad's) wedding on July 24th, and so far I've managed to knock off 2lbs. Fingers crossed, this blog will help me to make an effort and lose even more!  No more binge eating!   I'm really enjoying Big Brother at the moment, I'm surprised it's going so fast... only 56 more days to go! It's an eviction night so I'm planning on popping into some chatrooms later when the folks go down the pub. The excitement isn't worth missing, believe me!  As you can tell, I'm a pretty big fan, and this year's the best so far, in my opinion. Other than Big Brother and weightloss, I have revision to squeeze in as we have mock GCSEs next week. Wednesday should be good though, I only have one mock so I don't have to go in until fairly late! (Lay-in! Whey!) I wish sometimes I had the get-up-and-go to work a bit harder, I mean, I  do  try to pay attention, but it's not always easy. And with sh*t from other students day after day (I'll probably tell you more about that in the future, when I'm feeling like it) it  does  become difficult after a while.  Anyway, I'm waffling now (I knew once I got into the swing of Blogging I'd start doing this!) I'll be off now, and I'll probably post again in the next couple of days! Bye for now, and tons of love to  everyone ! Bye bye, xx

       ...and realising it's the  holidays!   &nbsp; Well, I won't be doing much, I don't suppose, but it's nice to be away from school! It's the wedding a week from today, and then I'll be off to Dad's to hang around in forums for 3 weeks. &nbsp; I've just been shopping and got American Pie I and II, so I'll be having a cosy night in tonight when the folks go out. &nbsp; That brings me to an interesting point, I have a new way of telling when they're off down the pub. Pat (my step-dad) puts " MTV " on, because he doesn't like getting into a programme and then missing the end! Guess what's on ... yep, that's right. They're off. &nbsp; I got some new sunglasses today, they look really good! I feel like a new person lately, if I'm honest! I've lost half a stone, got a new hairstyle, had a good shave, and started taking an interest in what&nbsp;I look like (instead of slapping any old clothes on and not giving a toss!) &nbsp; Anyway, on that note, mother's whinging, so I'll be off! More soon, Love, Mike xx

      Well I've shaved and had a proper haircut (finally!) and I feel amazing... But the hairdresser was  so  funny I just had to blog about her!  She knew what she was doing, for sure, and she did a great job; but all the time she kept saying  really reassuring things  like "It looks like you're wearing a helmet", "You've got lovely hair but it was a disaster", and "I'd cut a bit more off here, but you've got quite big ears, love."  I was weeing myself! TDR x

      Just thought I owed you a quick note to tell you how sports-day went.  I managed to blag my way out of high-jump, but ended up doing discus. On reflection, that's probably worse. So, I made an arse out of myself, got laughed at, hurled some choice-phrases at people and wandered off half way through my event.  Never mind, tomorrow's another day...

      Time for another depressing entry - I find it quite interesting that only negative thoughts seem important enough to write about. I'm guessing it's a good thing though, a problem shared is a problem halved (so they say!).  Anyway, It's sports-day tomorrow at school. To most people that probably doesn't sound too bad, probably most would be getting   excited   about it (!) - but to the official   Worst Prson At Sport In The Entire History Of The World, Ever   - It's definitely something to worry about.  I've always hated it, there's no surprise that I'm dreading it, but I hate it all the same. I beg and beg to be put down for the 200m (possibly the only thing I can not come last in), but as usual I get ignored. Now, sports-day is a few short hours away and I've only just found out that I've been put down for high-jump. Nice of them to tell me.  In other (depressing) news, I'm being shoved to my Dad's house for 3 weeks this summer: I   could   have been spending time with friends but instead I'll be stuck in Norfolk doing nothing for half of my break. I'm really annoyed about it - I don't get on with my Dad most of the time anyway, and I think I'll be close to a breakdown before I leave.  Anyway, I'll be back to blog when I can make it, hope you're all having a good time of it at the moment! Love to all, TDR x

       I've decided to do a series of "Unplanned" posts here during the holidays, as I don't have anything specific to talk about I'm going to start typing and see what happens!   Well, it's been an entire month since I last spoke to you, and looking back it's probably been the most boring month of my entire life. Actually, I suppose Mum's wedding was a fairly big event, but that's drifting off into the distant past now.  It was a brilliant day, I don't think I've seen so many happy people in one place! I ended up being talked into giving Mum away, which was exciting but strangely nerveracking. I must've looked as wobbly as her going down the aisle! Phew!  Since then, as I mentioned in my earlier post, Pure hell is Approaching ( urlLink here ), I've been packed off to my Dad's in Sunny Norfolk. I've been doing absoloutely nothing since then, apart from hanging around in forums and watching  Big Brother "Live" .  As if to prove my level of boredom, my brain has switched off and I've run out of things to say. So you'll have to wait until Part 2 of "Unplanned" before you hear from me again! Love, TDR x
