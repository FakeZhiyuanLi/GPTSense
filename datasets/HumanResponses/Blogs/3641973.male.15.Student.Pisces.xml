      OMG..Endurance Camp!! Once i set foot onto the campsite , everything turned upside down. I learnt how to spell "H..E..L..L". It was like soo cool. "SHIT" was the alternative.Even though how tough it was , I went thru it or can i say WE went thru it..IT was like a BIG achievement for us.  Our skills totally improved in every way..
