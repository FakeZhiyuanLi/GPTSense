       not really certain what to put here today, chewing freedent gum.. have decided that it'll help .. addicted to the minty taste... mmmmm! it's so odd to think that this time last year, i was celebrating independence day with americans.. well, and aussies, poms and well, everybody really, in new york, running around the catskill mountains, so not ready for the possibility of bears and tornados, bad camp food, rain in summer (well, i live in the pilbara now, so i guess it's normal!) .. songs about mooses.. and rabbits.. and my american karen! (how i miss her!) HI KAREN!!! .. i guess i never knew then that i'd be singing tiny dancer on a roadtrip to woodstock, only to find out that the concert never actually occurred there.. uh.. thanks odd hippie guy outside the bank.. i never knew then how it'd feel to stand in the midst of what was left of the two towers.. or to run around those massive museums .. or look around and be surrounded by nothing but skyscrapers.. or to actually go to a broadway show.. on broadway!!! or.. or.. or to chase squirrels and pidgeons in central park!!!   Actually, what amazed me most was the inability of americans to understand what i was trying to say .. quite funny really, before going to the states, i watched an american documentary which featured an aussie speaking with SUBTITLES underneath him... geez! thought it was a joke til i actually got over there myself. tee hee! but i love, love, loved it. awesome! i think i might just chew my entire packet of gum at once. mmm. minty. fresh. mmmm.

       Mood: meh!  And love is only a feeling.. anyway! and so says the darkness. am wondering when my neighbours are going to finally complain about my recent obsession with this cd.    and what, say you, is a cat? it is similar to a little, loud being that never lets you forget its existance.. that you occasionally have to fill will biscuits and milk - or water, (despite it's own knowlegdge that it's clearly lactose intollerant) ! and that, say i, is a cat! and when does a cat like to prove its existance..? well, at five in the mornin ofcourse!! har har. and that.. is a cat.   And so, here i sit, dark circles under my eyes, due to it being day two, week ten of an eleven week term, due to owning a cat, due to being moi! and listening ofcourse, to the darkness cd, loving it, procrastinating at a disgusting rate, and wondering why i can never work at any pace beyond the ever so speedy 'oh golly, it's due tomorrow'.   missing the lack of responsibility that comes with uni... lovin the lack of crusty money, that comes with the real world! and now that my nails are a shiny shade of shine.. i shall sign off with an adios!  HORRAY FOR MY TRIP TO THE CITY... SO CLOSE, YET SO FAR!!!!

       doesn't that sound familar? doesn't that hit too close to home? it's sunday night, ten past eight already.. and where the hell has the weekend gone? it's been two weeks since the broome trip, three weeks since perth, and one night since roach racin. yes.. ROACH RACING!! i bumped into an old school friend, and we sat, amused, disussing the irony of moving from the city and finding ourselves seven years down the track, in a country town, watching cockroaches racing eachother in tiny little cylinders. mmmm.

       i want to keep this dang blog updated.  ARGH!  just like i want to wash up after dinner every night, and clean my house every saturday, and get to bed on time, and learn the guitar, and write a novel, and actually finish reading 'war and peace', and wash my car, and learn another language, and keep a pot plant alive (RIP ichabot), and .. and .. and. achievable says you - YES! says i. i have lots planned for before i'm 27. i'm certain that by the time i'm 26 and a half, my list will have moved from the 'every intention' pile, to the 'done'... i always have worked better under pressure!  read this fabelhaft quote the other day..  "Life should NOT be a journey to the grave with the intention of arriving safely in an attractive and well preserved body, but rather to skid in sideways,Champagne in one hand - strawberries in the other, body thoroughly used up, totally worn out, and screaming WOO HOO - What a Ride!"  so, here i am, up north, skidding along i daresay.. and having a ball. i've decided to live the philosophy that taking chances i cool, and say 'Yes!' to opportunity.. which is why i'm now on a volleyball team (we went to Broome, had a bloomin wicked time of it, and i did a real volleyball move and all!), i'm taking life drawing classes (drawing is fun! but i've a prude of a friend who won't look at my pictures!!), i'm up at 5:30 three mornings a week, so as to get to the gym down the road for the 6am pump class! (look at my muscles -aren't i sex-eh!!!) - oh! and i'm learnin how to latin dance (yes, yes i know - move my bottom half, not my top!!).  i'm lyin on the floor, typing on a lap top, listenin to 'train', my house is a shamble, need to clean, again. i only did it yesterday. geeees. .. And lovin' it.
