      while i don't suffer from the titular malady, i find it something that i should mention... i waited for my means of mass conveyance to arrive this morning, and as the ferry approached the slip, i watched the captain of the boat begin some nasal spelunking. he hit the dock and the sidewalls on his way in looking for that juicy booger... maybe this was how that staten island ferry incident happened.  is it too soon to make off-handed references to this incident, or is it comedically acceptable to use it as fodder?  well, i was a tad leary to board that boat, but as it was the last one that i could take that would get me to the city in time for the last bus that passes my office, i boarded. luckily there was a large barge piloting down the hudson, and so, we had to drive (float?) slowly across the resultant wake left behind. perfect! the u.s.s. snotcannon could continue on it's journey. i felt as if i were some further permutation of maynard g krebs setting sail into the unknown; all i was able to think was "it was only supposed to be a 3 hour tour!" luckily, the large boat sailed away, we floated on (hmmm... styx and modest mouse references in one sentence) and we made it to ny.   i hate mass transit, and i like the model that la creates for city life. no real subway system, no bus lines, only lots and lots of solo drivers. i saw more hummers escalades and excursions in this city than i have ever seen in a single location. with fuel prices at $2.199 on the low end, i couldn't understand why anyone would chose to drive a vehicle that gets 2 gallons to the mile, but it is california, where everyone is an alien, an idiot or a dope fiend.   does it matter how crazy this city is? not much because they are blessed with manna from heaven. you know what i speak of,  urlLink in-n-out , the burgers that make vegetarians want to eat meat.  from pickin' yo' nose to hamburgers... let's see tom wolfe make that leap.

      if you've just tuned in, you will realize that this blogging idea is, at least for me, a HORRIBLE idea... i mean self-publishing with no one to edit you... i can only begin to imagine the kinds of trouble that one could get into with one of these things.  since there is someone out there (i hope) reading this, i will post the following question; what is the deal with dreams? i am riddled with many MANY ridiculous ones that are just windows into the damage that my mind has experienced through years of abuse. so i ask, have you ever had one of those dreams... the kind where NOTHING makes sense, and not in the "why was j. lo and ben affleck such a major news story?" type of way, but more in the "salvidor dali colored my world" sort of way? surrealistic and fractured, like some sort of david lynch lunch meeting, with less chairs and more provolone? i do hope you know what i am talking about, because i was really hoping you could explain it to me...    (oh and get used to this, i will be posting a large number of bizzare stories and dreams, sometimes on an hourly basis)    so my dream... i was set up on a blind date, and i bought a pair of earrings that were blobs of metal... sort of looked like flapjacks (pancakes, griddle cakes, crepes, etc)... but they were oddly alluring... I get to my dates house, a log cabin, actually THE log cabin... when i ring the bell, i'm greeted by the most gorgeous looking woman I've ever seen... skin as dark as molasses... and glassy. she was an anthropomorphised bottle of mrs. butterworths... actually as i was dating her, i'm assuming she was ms. butterworths. i felt odd, but i gave her the earrings... she exclaimed, with great exhuberance "flapjack earrings! why, i do declare! these are lovely!" the odd thing was, when she took them from the box, they were no longer gold/silver/imanginarium or whatever metal they were supposed to be, but they were actually flapjacks! the warm toasty smell was coming off them and everything. i helped her put them on, and i must say, her being a syrup bottle and all, they actually looked great on her... she was damn attractive for an oversized hunk of glass filled with sweetened tree sap... but again, i digress.  i asked her what her name was, as i felt silly calling her ms. butterworth and her calling me helmut (again, dream logic prevails, so don't ask). it was as if i was courting her across a rift in time; one that required me to have good manners and to call her by her honorific, while she could call me any such thing she felt like. she tittered like a school mouse and said, "call me kansas... (i thought of that failed marketing campaign for the state from the early 80's "kansas is flatter than a pancake!" and giggled.) all my friends do." then she asked why i found her name funny. i explained the connection my mind made, and she told me that was a frequent taunt when she hadn't developed what made her butter worth something. i looked at her, perplexed. She said... "tits... i hadn't gotten them yet." oh!  the date was interesting... i had planned to take her to a bowling alley, but i feared bowling balls shattering her, so we went to a nice restaurant and drank several bottles of wine... i had planned to take her dancing, but she melted like butter, and I was able to get under her label...

      so, i have enough friends that create these online diaries, these internet journals, these blogs, and for whatever it's worth, i am going to make an attempt at it. who knows, it may be cheaper than therapy. i have, for lack or better words, problems and/or issues. some of my writings will make that clearer than others.  in order to get the casual reader up to date, i am going to, in the interest of science, provide some of my previous ramblings as a starting point for this thing, and to make it look like I write a lot. any casual reader will see that i am overly zealous for too short a period of time, rant on tangental topics and tell stories that aren't even based in reality...  and with this, i welcome you to the   waffle iron of doom ...
