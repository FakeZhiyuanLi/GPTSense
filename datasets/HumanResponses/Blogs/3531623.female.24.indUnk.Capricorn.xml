        Your soul is WILLFUL. You are determined and a little reckless, and you do whatever you want to do. You have strong opinions and are not easily swayed, and your headstrong resolve is not easily countered. You have few regrets. People find your refusal to go down without a fight formidable, and they respect you for it. You are a proud and content soul.

      I found some really cool quotes i liked, and decided to post them here. If you wonder about the anti-men theme i got alot of them from http://www.ihatemen.com.    *Men will always lie about 3 things: I love you...... the check is in the mail...... and I promise I won't cum in your mouth. -- Unknown  *Something tells me that Snow White is smarter than we think. Seven men at perfect height, all seven noses pink. - Tracy Bonham  *The trouble with some women is that they get all excited about nothing - and then marry him! -- Cher  *People ask me why I don't want to get married and I simply respond ' What's in it for me?  *A man can sleep around, no questions asked, but if a woman makes nineteen or twenty mistakes she's a tramp. -- Joan Rivers  *Don't accept rides from strange men, and remember that all men are strange. -- Robin Morgan  *A male gynocologist is like an auto mechanic who never owned a car. -- Carrie Snow  *A drink a day keeps the shrink away. (Edward Abbey)  *"Only two things are infinite, the universe and human stupidity, and I'm not sure about the former."  (Albert Einstein)  *Never go to bed mad. Stay awake all night and plot horrible REVENGE!!!! (Vince Lewonski)

      How many people can say they had a day like this? Yesterday my cousins whatever (bf, babys daddy, im not sure what to call him) brought my dad a rooster. Its really cute, and i promptly named him Mike.  No one told us that the rooster was someones pet, and im not just talking, toss it some food and keep it alive. This rooster apparently spent its whole life following its owner around. So now guess who it has latched on to?? Thats right me. It has followed me every step i make. It watched me bath my dogs, followed me on my porch. But the highlight was, when i left the front door open, and sat on the couch. It actually followed me in, and got on the couch.  Interesting day to say the least.

      Tonight as i sat watching/lusting over Discovery Channels Great Bike Build Off, i had a startling revelation.I spend entirely to much time beautifying myself.  Of course i made this realization when my face was lacquered with facial, and i was ankle deep in foot softening scrub. But between random drooling ove Chicco the builder, and now i have thought about it.  I spend hours upon hours each week doing the following things, soaking, scraping, painting, removing, buffing, filing, deep cleansing, scrubbing, toning, curling, shaving, plucking, detoxifying, and the list goes on and on and on and on............  But why? Its not like i ever see anyone? Who cares if my nails are pink sorbet or blaze. Who is gonna see if i go a week without shaving my legs, or dont use a facial again this week?  I could spend alot of that time doing other stuff. I could clean, i could look for a job, I could force myself to cook.  I may have possibly opened a whole new, not nearly as cute chapter of my life.

      I cant help but think that I am to easily influenced by the media. Not so much fashion/appearance wise. No my weakness is far worse than wanting to be a twig. I have a weak slang gene.  *sigh* Slang, that wonderful thing that makes english one of the most difficult languages to learn. For years i worked well with the seemingly regulatory "Cool". Then in high school "Dude" happened. The damn word was everywhere, then my best friend got lastched to it, next thing i knew every other word was "Dude"   I mean,dude, what was i supposed to do. It annoyed my teachers, it annoyed my mother, it even annoyed me. It took years to break the habit. I spent hours just spanking myself (but thats totally off the subject). Now i can safely say that only rarely does the word "dude" slip past these lips.   But lately my old weaknesses have come back to haunt me. Ive noticed that i spend alot of time typing/and or speaking the word "So". As in, " that is sooooooooo stupid", or "I am soooooooo hungry". "So" has become my word of choice for eye-rolling exaggeration.  But something more ominous lies in my slang weakened future. Im not going to lie, im addicted to "The Simple Life", i was the first season, and i am now. Today during an hour phone call from ashley at work, we were both making fun of Paris and Nicoles, repeated use of "Thats hot". Another hour passed and we were once again on the phone, halfway through it, we realized that "thats hot" had some how snuck its way into our vocabularies. Disturbing to say the least.  All this really makes me question watching those lil jon videos on mtv. I mean really does the world need a fat white girl screaming "WHAT" "OOOKAY" "YEEEAH".  Sure thats hot, but i sooooooo need a new hobby, dude.

      This is both the prettiest and the most depressing song ive ever heard.   KASEY CHAMBERS LYRICS   Not Pretty Enough  Am I not pretty enough Is my heart too broken Do I cry too much Am I too outspoken Don't I make you laugh Should I try it harder Why do you see right through me  I live, I breathe, I let it rain on me I sleep, I wake, I try hard not to break I crave, I love, I've waited long enough I try as hard as I can  I laugh, I feel, I make believe it's real I fall, I freeze, I pray down on my knees I hope, I stand, I take it like a man I try as hard as I can

      Today my aunt made me go put in a job application with her. It was at this data entry place in the next town. As part of the application process I had to take a typing test. Now i spend hours upon hours on the computer, you really would think i was adept at this whole typing gig. But i get there and they start with these rules, NO CAPITALIZATION, ALWAYS GO TO THE NEXT LINE!!! The whole time the woman was talking, this voice kept going through my head, "Its frigging typing bitch, ive been doing it for years now!" Well let me just say that typing test opened my eyes to painful case of smack bottom. It smacked me around, and kicked me out without paying. I apparently am addicted to capitalization. Who knew? Anyways i have 2 more chances to take the test, though im really not sure i even want the job, its more my aunts idea, and im just along for the ride.  The whole trip was painful anyway. Any time spent with my aunt that is more than 10 minutes is painful. She's the crazy cat lady with the cat smell to match. Needless to say being enclosed in a vehicle with her was an eye watering experience. I did anything i could to distract myself. You know playing with the cd player, flipping songs really fast when i heard " My neck, My back lick my.....". Not a song for the over 50 set. The whole town of Booneville proved to bring back memories that distracted me from my cd monopoly. Booneville has always been a "bad" town, or at least in my case ( and my friend ashleys). You go in a good girl and leave pure evil. I would look around and all these memories would just wash over me.  "Man, ashley and i once hid from her mom with two guys up that road"  "Geez, has it been that long since we took all those guys to the horse show, and had to wrestle a beer from ed the dealer"  "LOL last time i was on that road, ashley and i had picked two prison workers up at the fourth of july festival"  There were quiet a few of these on the trip, " Man i made out with (insert name) up there". Not to mention a few, "I lost that there" and "I did that there"  Keep in mind that none of that was actually said aloud to my aunt. If it had been, i think its safe to say i would never have left that town alive today.  It was actually a good boost to my lagging confidence, it served to remind me, that at one time i could have any man i wanted. Ive been alone for a long time now, but today did remind me that it was my choice and i can change it whenever i want to. Maybe i havent been ready since last year, but i know that i will be, maybe even sooner than i realized myself.

      Lately i have become fascinated with hot or not. Currently, after 289 votes, I am hotter than 32% of the women in my state. I actually think thats pretty good. Ive have been shocked by the number of people that have wanted to message me. Its a great ego boost to everyday go to your email and see "Amanda, someone on HOTorNOT wants to meet you! ".  There's only one really depressing thing about the site. As ive explored, looking for people i know, I have wandered into the gay male section. In it i discovered there are no unattractive men. The whole section is filled with total hotties. Its sad, I want them all, but im not packing the needed equipment.  I wonder where ugly gay men are. I have yet to meet one. Is beauty a part of the gay man gene? It makes me wonder, if i really want beautiful children, should i purchase sperm from a gay man? *makes note to look into that*

      Beauty they say is in the eye of the beholder. If this is true then i assume that the editors of Vogue must have to squint really hard (see photo above), to block out the rest of the world that is not a size 0-2. Not to mention having to stare skyward looking for that next 6'2 supermodel.  Its amazing how isolated a 5'3, @)) *ya wanna know me weight find the number that matches the symbol* chica can feel. Especially considering that a majority of the world is more like her than any covergirl.  I think i have been lucky, ive found my net niche. A group of similarly built hotties that make me laugh, make me smile, and make me feel good about the way im built.   Life is like a jigsaw puzzle, we stumble around alot trying to find that place we fit. Theres alot of places that we almost fit, and lot more that we dont even come close to.

      Its not easy being single in a world full of couples. When youre the lone single girl in a crowd you often get left out of a lot of things. Friends dont call, because they have significant others to talk to. Even when they do, you really dont want to go anywhere with them. I mean who wants to play third wheel with 2 people playing kissy face all evening. Call me crazy but if im not getting any i dont want to watch you. Its alot like drinking a bottle of water in front of a man in the sahara.   Its even worse with family. At family reunions people always ask " Well why arent you married yet?". Up to now my standard reply as been, "Because i have a life." Where upon i strutted off nose held high in the air, firmly cementing my role as family snob.  Tonight however i found a really good list of replies to the dreaded "why are you single question?". Courtesy of www.women.com   1. In the beginning, there were no stairmasters or low-fat-high-fiber muffins, and so people lived to only about 40-something. Maximum. Meaning? The pressure was on to get married before age 25. However, today, thanks to medical advances (and the fine line of SnackWell products) we can all hope to live to age 80. Easy.  Meaning? Even if we get married at age 40, that's still 35, 45, even 55 years to be with a mate. Plenty of time to be married. And divorced? What's the hurry?  2. Married people are not necessarily better catches simply because they were caught. I mean, have you taken a look at some of the married people out there? Hitler got married. Frankenstein got married. Linda Tripp got married. Obviously married people are not superior people?  3. Meanwhile, look at some of our cool single role models:    Catwoman: single.  Buddha: single.   Aphrodite: single.   Actually, all superheroes are single: Superman, Wonder Woman, Dudley Do-Right, etc.  4. Then there's The Ultimate Superhero -- God. Also single. And God is even a single-parent household.  5. It's easy to become married. 2.3 million people do it a year. If you want to pressure me to become something, hey, why not pick something a little more challenging? Like an astrophysicist.

      I have been asked alot lately who i am. Job interviews and such. Its a terrible question to answer. I am no clue what to tell these people. I wanna say, "Well im just me" but then they get all deep and say "But who is Aaaaamanda". They always draw my name out, like i wont understand them saying it. For god's sake youre from eastern ky, i understand your accent already! Since i dont know who or what i am, i am perfectly clear on what i am NOT.  1. I am not self-concious (in a crowd)  2. I am not a genius ( but i am smarter than your average bear)  3. I am not a ho ( im just friendly)  4. I am not a poor judge of men (im just easily impressed)   5. I am not picky ( i just know things could be worse)   Sure thats a relatively short list of things im not. But overall it covers the high points of what im not.

      Last night in a moment of desperation i posted a semi-enthusiastic, "Hey im kinda looking", thing in my kentucky personals group. This morning i had a reply in my inbox.  "i am from east ky, i would like to get together..what are you looking for ?hope to here from you soon mam"  My would be suitor goes by the lovely name, Big Sexy.  Somewhat curious i made my way over to his yahoo profile, this is what else i have learned about him.  Yahoo! ID: ******* I wont put his profile for fear of embaressment Real Name: big sexy   Location:  east ky ...floyd / johnson area  Age:  36   Marital Status:  Single   Gender:  Male  Occupation:                                More About Me  Latest News: I am Tan sexy man very attractive, single and ready. nice guy...clean cut , waiting to hear from you      Favorite Quote  "if it smells good eat it....."    I have been chatting for a long time now, 7 years i do believe. I like to think that i have come to interpret how people fill out their yahoo profiles.   Real Name: big sexy. Translated this means i have a mullet and lotsa gold chains and you are going to love cruising with me in my trans am.   Location:  east ky ...floyd / johnson area. Translated means, I really cant give any specifics on where i live, lest i be discovered my some secret government agency that is out to get me.  Age:  36  . Im guessing that with the other information i gathered, this 36 translates to i really look 56, but i want some hot 24 year old poontang.  Marital Status:  Single . Sure im single, just ignore the 2 ex wifes and 6 kids i pay alimoney for.  Occupation: (blank). Can we say hello unemployment!!!!!    Latest News: I am Tan sexy man very attractive, single and ready. nice guy...clean cut , waiting to hear from you . Really if youre that hot then why ya advertising?  Favorite Quote  "if it smells good eat it....."     The Quote is my personal favorite. I just really hope some poor, unsuspecting farm animals havent heard it recently.

      Currently it is 11:32 on a friday night. I am a 24 year old, reasonably attractive bbw. But am i out doing anything? No. Do i even have an opportunity to go anywhere? No.   Lately my life has become so tedious. Day after day its the same thing. I wake up, I clean house, I cook, I watch Tv, I chat, then the day comes to an end and i go to bed. The highlight of this coming weekend is that i get to mow the lawn.  It didnt used to be this way. It shouldnt be this way now. After the past year ive just become so wary of people that im finding it harder and harder to get out and meet new people, and make new friends.  Ive come to fully accept my part in the loss of some of my friends, though i realize that they dont make the same effort to see their own parts in it. I know that they were not hurt nearly as much as i was in the splits. Maybe i just hoped that our friendships together and the loss of them would have meant something to someone other than just me.  In the long run i have come to recognize the people who do care about me. Ashley is dedicated, but much like me cant really afford to go anywhere. Adarsh adores me, but is all the way in Minnesota.   As it is,  I am looking for new ways to meet people.I have come to adore all my friends in chat, but it isnt like being face to face with someone.   Looking for suggestions.........

      This is a copy and paste of an email i got a couple of days ago.   Hello,  I was looking for someone else in the Jackson  area and stumbled upon your profile.  There is something  about your eyes in the picture that caught my  attention.  I see a sadness and depth in your eyes.  I just  felt compelled to send you an email.  I hope you are  happy and well, and I wish you the best.  Steve   As of yet i have not responded to the email. Im really not sure what to say. I mean what do you say to someone who doesnt know you but thinks youre sad.  The bad part is I probably was sad when i took the pic, im sad alot. Not depressed as in "Woe is me", just sad that things in the world arent different.  Im sad that im not close to my old friends anymore, but I understand that we're all different people now.  Im sad that I am unemployed, but im taking steps to rectify that situation.  Im sad that Im not dating, but i know that i am a strong independant woman and i dont need a man to make me happy.  Life in general makes me sad, but at time its making me the stronger, happier person that i know i can be.

      It's strange. I dont consider myself easily impressed but as of late i find myself amazed at the smallest things. Just now, sitting at my comp i played a download of a Joey Ramone cover of what a wonderful world. It totally floored me, even though ive heard it dozens of times. The song, and the performance of it, was just beautiful.

      Its no suprise that i get more SPAM than i do actual email. Usual I ignore it but i found this one particularly funny.    From: "Rachel Craft" awzdtqyyjlh@videotron.ca   http://www.bigtogo.com/index.php? 1.0.0%_Money_Back_Guarantee!<>  Masses and moving shapes of shade,--Want as much more, to turn it to its use,The Lines, tho' touch'd but faintly, are drawn right.Let such teach others who themselves excell,   It's not often that you see an email advertisement for erectile dysfunction with quaint little words of wisdom at the end.  But i cant deny that it has touched me, and made me wonder do i need "íncreased s.e.m.e.n and s.p.e.r.m production up to 600%!" Of course call me a stupid woman but i always thought that they were the same thing. Maybe this ad wasnt for erectile dysfunction after all, maybe this was all a highly coincidental anagram (sooo not sure if thats the right word) for something totally not related.  S - Stop S - Stay E- Embaressing P - Placed M - Man E - enveloped (in) E - Eating R - Raw N - Nightcrawlers M - Man Juice   I really didnt know what i was dealing with. So i investigated. I went to the site, a href="http://www.bigtogo.com/index.php , whereupon i discovered a really disturbing graphic of what i hoped was a finger.  Eventually i forced myself to look away from the mutated finger, to read upon the product. Turns out to be a "sexual enhancement" product.  I was intrigued by this line "Men Can Enjoy BIGGER and INTENSIFIED Orgasms! While Women Can Enjoy MULTIPLE Orgasms!" I mean who doesnt that sound good too? Not only was it promising my imaginary Bf even bigger and more intense orgasms, but opening me up to multiple ones, a chance to us to revive our imaginary sex life.  I have decided to email the company, to learn more of this fascinating product. I will keep you all updated and i know you to are dying to know how to get " íncreased s.e.m.e.n and s.p.e.r.m production up to 600%!"

       I began to write this last night, but midway through it, broke down into irrational tears and closed the post without saving it. Now im attempting to rewrite it, in hopes that it will be some what theraputic.    &nbsp;  For the past year or so Ive had this whole feeling of being on the outside looking in. Its an odd way to feel, being in a crowd of people who are all engaged in a lively discussion, while you are sitting there with nothing really to say.     &nbsp;  When i was a kid i felt that way all the time. I was an only child, and never around anyone my own age. So when i would go to school, being around others just felt strange. I would spend alot of time just sitting and watching other kids, not really sure how to interact with them.    &nbsp;  As i grew the feelings of awkwardness dissipitated and i began to connect with my&nbsp;peers. I was still the shy, quiet, kinda weird kid, just not so much anymore. When i finally went to high school i felt like i was somewhere i belonged. It felt good. I had that feeling of belonging through a good part of my college life, up until this past year.    &nbsp;  This past year i grew away from alot of people i knew, they were all getting married and having kids and i just wasnt someone they could talk to about stuff like that. Same way with family all my cousins are now married and have kids, i see them at reunions and i dont have anything to contribute to a conversation centered around kids and husbands.     &nbsp;  I didnt want to feel this way again.

       Im so bored. My life has become so boring. I am in rut that vaguelly resembles a trench. I lay in my trench and wait for the schrapnel of BLAH to rain down upon me.     &nbsp;  Not that&nbsp;I havent tried to find stuff to do. I mean really ive had lots of ideas. But they cancelled my self defense class, and i realized i would probably get busted if i killed my cousin.    &nbsp;  The upside of my BLAH, is that our yard looks fabulous. I think i am substituting yard upkeep for sex. The riding mower may be my new boyfriend, he goes by the given name John Deere. Occasionaly i cheat on him with the push mower "Lawn Man".     &nbsp;  Hmmm... that is kinda weird, all my mowing equipment has male names, never realized that till now.    &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;

       The last few years have been good to us. We have had our ups and downs, and all arounds. But ive seen all the tell-tell signs the last few months, the unraveling edges, the broken ties, the stains that just wont wash away. I know our time together is coming to an end.    &nbsp;  I remember the first time i saw you, just hanging around the store. Your vibrant blue caught my eye, and drew me in. I looked you over, you were an XL, just the right size. I wanted you, desperatley had to have you. I wasnt sure I could have you. I was broke and alone. But i dug down&nbsp;deep, searched myself high and low, until&nbsp;I found what&nbsp;I needed to make you mine.&nbsp;    &nbsp;  I took you home that night. Held you against my body. I really worried that we wouldnt fit together. However, I knew when the moment came, that you were made for me.    &nbsp;  We have had good moments the last couple of years, youve been there with me through trips, tears, and other of lifes trials. You've been the comfortable warmth that i always come back too. Not the say that things have always been perfect. It still hurts sometimes to remember how I lost&nbsp; you in the front yard, and the time you fell away from me when i walked past a webcam. But the good has far over weighed the bad. Though i have others like you in my life, it isnt the same. None of them can ever replace the way to made me feel.    &nbsp;  I will miss you my old friend, I will miss you so much........................................    &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;  .......................................you have been the best pair of 6 dollar shorts a girl could have owned.

       I&nbsp;want to remind everyone, that i warned everyone earlier that i am a total narcist. I recognize the fact. Im not complaining, it took a long time to love myself, and to be comfortable with the way i look. Even now&nbsp;i still have concerns about my teeth. I just stop and remind myself that there are worse things in the world than having a gap.

       I had my interview today. I think the woman who interviewed me was way to comfortable with me. She is my neighbor, and she kept scratching her boob. I was worried, i thought about suggesting some ointment. Somewhere between her asking&nbsp; me, "What is your definition of teamwork," and "What would&nbsp;my former employers would say about me", i thought to myself, man i hope her boob rash isnt catching, cause she keeps touching me. Other wise i think it went well.    &nbsp;  My aunt got a me a new cd. Uncle Kracker, Seventy-two and sunny. Just adding to an already to larger cd collection.     &nbsp;  Damn I really want&nbsp;a job. Im tired of sitting home, broke.

Well it means i still think the same way, but i shouldnt be suprised or hurt by what people say. Just need to remind myself about that before i let it get to me again.

       Pink is my favorite color. Unfortunately this is more of a purple, but oh well beggars cant be choosers.     &nbsp;  Thanks to Clover aka Renee i am exploring the world of blogrolling. Though im still not even sure what it is. Now i want money for blogrolling gold.    &nbsp;  I had a job interview yesterday. To be a Program Records Tech. I have no clue what that is, but im desperate for a job and to lazy to hook. The woman who interviewed me really liked me, but she did have some valid concerns. For instance she didnt think it would be worth me driving approx. 50 miles to work for 6.15 an hr. I tend to agree. Her second concern (which is my favorite)&nbsp; is that i may be too cute to work with the mentally unstable. Her words not mine. To be honest i had to stifle a snort when she said that. Inside i was thinking, "Lady if you could only see some of the freaks i have slept with".&nbsp; I told her i had taken the receptionist tests to work at the Facility here in town. She told me to see if i could find out some more information, and then call her back if i was still interested. Anyway being the nosy joe i am, i did some calls and found out that I have an interview for that job next week! Im going up against 5 other people who are undoubtlably more experienced than me. If anyone out there has suggestions, im open to them.    &nbsp;  Ive been watching the newspapers here at home like a hawk. Im going to clip the article and the 2 obituaries about Shawn out of them. Put them in my little&nbsp;box of memories. Ive spent alot of this past week thinking about him. While i will always know that he had problems, im not going to remember him for them, im going to remember the Shawn that was my friend, the guy who protected me, and made me laugh. Damn waterworks are opening again.    &nbsp;   &nbsp;  *10 minutes later after a barrage of tears..........    &nbsp;  Im thinking of taking a Women's self defense class here in town. Not that we have an exceptionally high crime wave, more for just something to do. Plus you never know when you might find the opportunity to hit someone, at least i can make it look like self defense.    &nbsp;  The chat room is so quiet. I MISS MUH RAE AND ERGO!!!!!!!!!     &nbsp;  In the last two weeks ive developed a celebrity crush on Usher. I was never really into his music until the new confessions cd, and to be honest i only bought it cause he did the song with Lil' Jon and Ludacris. Since then ive seen the other video for the cd. I think i may have had to wipe some drool of my chin.    &nbsp;  Word has it that Jerry is coming back in August to go to school. Ive actually missed him terribly.&nbsp; He was my best friends boyfriend, and somehow i ended up spending more time with him. I remember he was always in my car, Jamie ( another guy friend) never far behind him. I am still almost positive they were gay. No two men who were straight would ever touch each other that much. I just hope if he does come back, that things dont fall into the old pattern. Ashley having to give him money, while i washed his clothes and fed him. I dont wanna be jerrys Mommy again.    &nbsp;  I almost shit a brick just now. My yahoo mail thing popped up. This girl that i havent spoke to in over a year fowarded me stuff. I hate fowards. Anyone she dropped me like a hot potato, and we havent spoken since.&nbsp; I assume i wasnt as "Cool" as her dorm friends, but i dont let it worry me now. It just bothers me that she feels comfortable enough to ignore me for months and then foward stuff.    &nbsp;  WHEEEEE, muh ergo just came online!!! Her, Rae, and Deli are all at Moonies, LET THE RAMPANT BBW NUDITY BEGIN!!!!!!!    &nbsp;  My thoughts are always so rampant on this page. But thats how they run through my mind. I write things as i think them. I pretty much speak the same way. I tend to lack the control that stops me from saying something stupid.    &nbsp;  &nbsp;

      My aunt bought a newspaper today. I wasnt going to get one, i didnt really want to read the obituaries (i soo misspelled that. But she did, and i did. Shawn not only merited an obituary, but also made the front page with an article. According to the article, he had been dead 8 hours when they discovered the body. Thats just royally fucked up.  Everything i find out about Shawn is from others. No one in his family bothered to call and tell me anything. I like to think that i should have at least been called about it. He died thursday, they buried him saturday. I didnt know about any of it till monday.  I had hoped that all the time i had spent with shawn, taken care of him, would have meant enough for someone to at least tell me. But of well.

Maybe we were naive, deep down both of us always kind of thought that shawn would overcome. Its a whole good vs. evil mentality.  I feel guilty, really guilty. I wonder if things would have been different if i had stayed around, maybe if he had me to call he wouldnt done so much. I feel guilty i dont feel as sad as i know i should. It isnt that im not sad, i mean i feel like my heart has been ripped out. I just feel like ive already been mourning him for a year now.   Now he's actually gone, and i dont know what to do.

      I feel like crying, but for some reason i just cant. At noon my friend ashley called me, told me that shawn had od'ed. I hadnt heard anything about it. But im not suprised. He had done it before, numerous times, the only difference was this time it actually killed him. I hadn't spoke to Shawn in awhile. A year ago I took a long look at my life and decided that I just couldnt take care of him anymore. His problems were greater than my capacity to help him. I still adored him like a brother, worried about him more than his mother, but i just knew that if i kept him in my life it would be my downfall. So all these months ive sat aside, not spoken to him, only sent him one dettached email. Now he's gone. His problems won the battle, and i cant help but wonder if maybe things would have been different if i had stayed.

      I wonder who all reads this blog? I know five off the top of my head, but who else?  I wonder why im attracted to men who looke like this http://meetme.hotornot.com/r/?emid=KEA8E8B .  I wonder how some people just fall into these really great jobs i know they cant do.  I wonder how i let myself be talked into this crappy haircut.  I wonder if anyone noticed i missused the word live, instead of Life, in an earlier post.  I wonder if nice guys really do finish last.  I wonder what happened to all the people i used to know.  I wonder if i am going to regret renting Eurotrip.  I wonder where Rae's tig ol bitties are.  I wonder if there really is someone out there for everyone.  I wonder if its evil that i cheat at Literati.  I wonder does Diedrich Badar have bit roles in every movie.  I wonder when Michelle Trachtenburg went from harriet the spy to super hootch.

      I felt strange all day. Like the world is spinning around me and im just standing there watching it all. I'm not sure i liked that feeling.  I need more of a direction in life. I need a job. I need something to focus on rather then sitting around the house all day watching the soaps, and talk shows.  I need some hobbies to. I spend way to much time doing my nails, i think the paint fumes are starting to kill brain cells. Any suggestions? Im open to them.  I made a deal with the devil today. My aunt got a data entry job to do at home. She wanted to take my computer back. I told her i would do all the work, until she could afford a new computer. I would do it all to keep the computer and for a very minimal fee. I think that im going to live to regret the deal.  The plus side of my deal, any funds i make will be put on her prepaid credit card. I will then be able to shop online again, and feed my addiction to hootchie clothes. Tube Top from size appeal here i come!!!  I got whoooed at today. But i am not flattered by the whooo. My whoooer was a boy named Morton, aka Booger. Bit of history about the Boog. I had never spoken to him, the closest association i have with him is i dated a few of his friends but never met him. Though while cruising one night, he did wave Mr. Winkie at me from the sidewalk. I wasnt impressed.   Like any small town, even if you dont know someone you still "know" them. I knew he had a kid with some chick, so on and so forth. Time went by and i totally forgot the guy existed. Then a few months ago during my receptionist gig, some cute guy came in. Acted like he knew me, knew where i lived, screamed "youre not so innocent" in front of my boss. Typical day. After some investigating i discovered Booger was the cute guy. Imagine my suprise.  Since then things have taken on a weird pattern. He broke up with his babies mama, came to my old work place asking about me, and i see him driving up my road every evening. All of this is met by cringes of horror. Well this evening i was outside, bending down to pick a pug up and i hear it, "WHOOOO! lookit dat ass!!!", I glance up quick enough to see the idiot driving by, waving madly. I was horrified, my father was horrified for me. I begged the pug to rip my throat out, to no avail.  Where can live go once you've been hit on by a man called Booger?

      Why is the world full of assholes? Tonight some ass started iming me demanding to know why  I  didnt let him on  my  webcam. To be honest, i was shocked. This was someone i had chatted with before and had always seemed like a nice person. It was the perfect cap to an already horrible evening.   My parents did the silent treatment all evening with each other. Im not sure what happened. I took a nap, and when i woke up no one was talking.  Its getting harder and harder to live here. I adore my family. I just also want to slap them all. I go for a job interview Tuesday. Maybe ill get it and things will be better.  The only good parts of my day were the new glasses, new shoes, and the usher cd.   Geez, is my life really that sad?

        I wasnt going to post tonight, but ehhh changed my mind.           Tonight as been strange. As ive mentioned in earlier blogs i am returning to school (in a sense). I am taking internet classes, because frankly id rather chew my arm off then go back to campus.          Downside to my return to student status, Im broke, and i need money to pay a fee and get some books. Im unemployed and my parents cant help me. So tonight i did something i really didnt want to do. I called Adarsh and asked to borrow money.           I mean i realllly didnt want to do it. I goes against every prinicple i have to borrow money. Im a giver not a taker. Even as i was dialing the phone i was midway to hyperventilating.           I called, got my usually greeting of "Hey baby, what you up too". Really you have to imagine this with a very heavy indian accent. In one rush of air i explained my problem, all the the while fighting tears. Ahhh Dashee, bless his little heart, took pity on me and is loaning me money.           I wept for 20 minutes after I got off the phone with him. Not just because i had to borrow money, but because I had forgotten just how sweet he is, I mean he calls himself "Amanda's Little Brown Man". I havent seen him in ages, he's been moving alot with his job (or hiding from the ins, anythings possible).           The second strange thing of the night, was an email i got. Shawn's ( my friend who died) ex-wife emailed me from his account. Talk about milding freaking out when i saw shawns address in my mailbox. Total Sylvia Brown Moment, Rae'll know what im talking about :D.           Anyway she had emailed me to tell me that Shawn was dead. Which i actually thought was pretty nice, considering she is the only person who has bothered to contact me.           I emailed her back, told her how shawn was like a brother to me, and how i was sorry for her loss. I really didnt know what to say. I mean i never met the girl. All i knew about her was that she tried to run Shawn over with her cavalier once.  But to be fair, there were many times i considered running shawn over.          Well thats been my night so far.

        Ive been working on re-organizing my cd collection for a couple of days. Normally i keep them seperated into genres, and then they are alphabatized within. But ive gotten alot of new stuff, and ive let some of my other stuff slip and now its at the point of "Where the fuck is my cd". Im finding alot of stuff that i didnt remember having. I mean really, who knew i was that into boy-bands at one time.           The boy-band fetish explains my title. I dont know if anyone else who reads this is as MTV obsessed as I am, but thats where it came from. A few years ago they did a boy-band parody movie called 2gether, well i thought it was cute and promptly went out and bought both cd's that went with it. Just as quickly i forgot about them, until now when i discovered them in my collection.  The songs on the cd's are cutely funny, for instance there "U & U &amp; Me", a song about threesomes. Really i ask you, how can you hate a song about threesomes. There's also "Rub one out", once again, how can i resist that.            Ive found cd's by bands i dont even remember. Who the hell is Lifehouse? Im listening to their cd right now, and i am still clueless. I also found a band called Everything. If anyone has a clue, hook me up!

        Ive been in chat for a long time tonight. Well really no longer than usual, just feels like its been forever. Im unbelievably bored. I dont know what to do, theres nothing to do. My hands have been hurting all day, but i dont wanna stop typing, if i do they will just stiffen up.          My parents went to a cook out tonight. I stayed home. Yesterday at the birthday party i noticed my cousin has lost one of his front teeth, if i had gone tonight i would have slipped and asked what the hell happened to it.          Im listening to the Counting Crows, the song "Hangin Around". I bought the cd three years ago because that song represented a good portion of my life at the time. I spent alot of time, just hanging around town with my friends. Strange how things have changed, now i rarely leave the house. I miss alot of the energy of that time. I dont really miss the people i was with, just the crowd vibe.           I know people, I know lots of people, I dont go to town without seeing or speaking to someone I know. I have hundreds of aquaintances, but very, very, few friends. Ive changed this past year. Ive forgotten how to talk to people, or even how to make new friends. Thursday a girl i went to high school with approached me in Sears, i practically had a panic attack. She was just so energetic and friendly and i didnt know how to respond. I mumbled a few replies, and beat tracks for the door. As i sat in the car, waiting for my aunt, I tried to figure out why i had done that, and couldnt.          When i was working, even for that short time, people never bothered me. I loved being around others. I cringe inside when my mother even asks me to go to town for her.          Of course im writing this, and some super depressing song comes on this cd.           I dont want anyone to read this and think im a super depressed melodramatic diva. Im really not. Im happy most of my life, theres just that 15%  of total confusion that im always in that bothers me.           Ive lost any understanding I ever had about why things happen. Ive lost the moderate amount of control i had over life. Everything just whips around, like leafs in a windstorm.

        My parents are amazing. Most of the time i forget that they are. Usually i just focus on how annoying/embaressing they can be.          My mom, this tiny, chain-smoking dynamo. She has so much energy, i dont know where she gets it all (maybe the 20 cups of coffee she drinks a day). She's managed to keep both my dad and i alive, and that in itself is a miracle.           My dad, this long-haired wild man.The man literally can do anything, even bounce back from the brink of death. Numerous surgeries and one 20 ft fall through a swinging bridge unto rocks has proved that. The man is still alive after calling me his "little piglet", that speaks volumes for is survival skills.          Sometimes i forget just how much they truely love each other. They fight, they scream, they throw things, and threaten to kill each other on a regular basis. But i realize just how little these squabbles matter to them, on nights like tonight. They sat on our deck, just talking quietly, " what are we going to do tomorrow, dear?" "Dont really know, we were invited to a cook-out, dear."          Right now, just thinking about it, makes me want to tear up.

        I love quotes and finding ones i really like....         As she lay there dozing next to me, one voice inside my head kept saying, "Relax, you are not the first doctor to sleep with one of his patients," but another voice kept reminding me, "Howard, you are a veterinarian." Dick Wilson  You can either watch me or join me. One of them's more fun. Peter O'TooleMy Favorite Year  He's interesting. But he's not Brazilian-bikini-wax interesting. Marisa Acocella  If I still had a cherry, it would have been pushed back so far I could use it for a taillight. Nell Kimball   We have reason to believe that man first walked upright to free his hands for masturbation. Lily Tomlin   The human comedy begins with a vertical smile. Richard Condon   It's not what you do, it's who you do. Ron Jeremy   If you get invited to your first orgy, don't just show up nude. That's a common mistake. You have to let nudity "happen." Jack HandleySaturday Night Live   I have only two temperamental outbursts a year - each lasts six months. Tallulah   Cinderella lied to us. There should be a Betty Ford Center where they deprogram you by putting you in an electric chair, play Some Day My Prince Will Come and hit you and go 'Nobody's coming, nobody's coming, nobody's coming... Judy Carter   I feel like a million today, but one at a time. Mae West    Ok thats enough for today, im sure ive bored everyone senseless.

        I wonder if its obvious that im running thin on things to write about tonight. I mean my boobs really dont merit a paragraph unto theirselves, but i was bored and wanted to write something.          Just another example of why i need a hobby.      I love my chat room, and i love my friends that i have in it. Occasionally i become depressed when i see that everyone's finding love. Amazing how i can feel "odd man out" in a chat room.          I dont begrudge anyone happiness. I just wish i knew when it was my turn.

        I love my boobs. My boobs fascinate me each and every day. I dont mean that in a strictly sexual sense, though i do consider my boobs to be pretty damn hot. No, im just amazed by them in general. I comfortable with my boobs, in a way that is only seen in men who scratch themselves in public. I find that they provide me many services. Theyre an exceptional hand rest. I can rest a drink on them. I can use my hands to make them hop up and down to the rhythm of Dolly Partons song "why'dyou come in here looking like that".

         Im doing something i dont really want to do. Im looking at classes to take. I havent been able to latch on to a job, and taking more classes may make me feel less useless. But at the same time the thought of stepping foot back on campus makes me want to poke sharp objects into my eye. Hmmmm, let's make that burning, hot, sharp objects.          I admire those people who enjoy the education process. Those people who never miss a class, always take notes, always know the answer. My college experience was always me stumbling in 10 minutes late, when i made it at all, sitting quietly in the back, trying to avoid being called upon.          So im looking for internet classes to take. I need something to occupy me, or im gonna go crazy. I really need to feel like im at least making some contribution to society instead continuing to leach.

        It's 3:30 in the morning and my hands are killing me. They feel like they are on fire. I cant even open them all the way. Im tempted to cut them off, but all the knives in the house too dull to cut butter.          I am so tired of hurting all the time. I was able to tolerate when just my back hurt. But now that its moving on to my hands and  legs i dont know what to do. I just want it to stop even though i know it never will.

        ...... and i have an addiction to the color pink. My father told me this today, as i sat ooohhing and aaahhing over my new Cotton Candy nailpolish. The words "Man, you gotta lotta pink stuff dont you." For the record, My daddy notices nothing. This is the same man who forgot to pick me up at school when i was 10. But now as i sit here in my room, looking at the list of stuff from my desk, the 3 pair of pink capris, the 2 pink tshirts, the pink tank im wearing, the pink flip flops, the pink hat, the pink watch, the pink blog.... well you get the point....... i kinda think he may have a point. But oh well... could be worse, my favorite color could be puke green. Makes pink seem not so bad now.

       I live in a town filled with churches and used car lots. When i was a kid the only time i ever went to church was im the summer to bible school, that was always a summer plan, How many different ones can ya go to this year??? My belief system is somewhat different then others. I have a list of beliefs that i hold on to strongly.      1. I believe in God      2. I dont believe in Church.      3. Charity is not getting stuff for the needy and giving it to your own family.      4. Lying, Stealing, and Killing are far worse sins then Fornication.      Three years ago my cousin was killed in a car wreck. After his death his parents suddenly became religous. They had never been before. I personally dont agree with their reasoning. Religion shouldnt be something you do because you feel guilty.       Now for some reason at every family reunion their church attends. The people creep me out in a serious way. They are "Holy Roller" to the ninth degree, and dont seem to care to brush anything (hair or teeth). There's usually a graveyard service at the reunion, something i try like hell to avoid every year. Instead of something tasteful, few nice words said, some flowers laid out etc, Their preacher gets up and starts screaming about hellfire, damnation, and all sorts of cheery stuff.       Since i refuse to be screamed at by any man, i usually stand outside the graveyard, and do some bonding with Deanie, the druggie.      I dont really know what im trying to say with this blog. Im really just writing stuff off the top of my head. I guess really all ya need to know is this, I believe in a higher power, Mean green with clean anything, and there's always room for improvement. :D

      Last year i found this article in a copy of Esquire at my gyno's office. Stop and ponder an esquire in a gyno office. Anyway, it made me laugh my ass off, so ive decided to put it on here. I know the ladies will get a giggle.     10 Things You Don't Know About Women             By Wanda Sykes    1. The quickest way to a woman's heart is through her clit.  2. When we say we want you to get in touch with your feminine side, we really mean you need to touch our clit.  3. When we ask you if we look fat, it really means “Can you see my clit?”   4. We'd love to meet your mom. Right after we introduce you to our clit.   5. Diamonds are forever, but touching our clit can buy you two or three years.  6. When we tell you, "We're not communicating," it really means you're not touching our clit.  7. We'd be happy to buy our own damn drinks if you touched our clit.  8. When we say, "Harder! Harder!" that means "Take it out and touch my clit."  9. The fact that women make seventy-five cents to every man's dollar won't bother us as long as you touch our clit.  10. "Go have a boys' night out" really means "I'll stay home and touch my clit."
