        Hello fellow Lambchop fanatics. It's nice to be joining you all at this wonderful blog. Sometime ago I posted a message at the 'Chop Yahoo Group regarding Kurt's artwork for  How I Quit Smoking . I was wondering about the inspiration behind the images, with particular reference to the amazing suit that Mr. Wagner and David Dunlap decorated. Anyway, I didn't get any response and was just hoping that someone might have more to say about it all. On the CD cover there are 19 numbered images and rather cryptic 'messages', some of which seem to refer to war or human rights issues (Biko, MLK, Sarajevo). Anyone know who Steve Owens is? The suit is a marvel, consisting of what seems to be many (or all?) of the images and epigrams featured on the cover. Do we know if Kurt still has the suit? Remember, 'Everything resembles something'.

      Here are some  urlLink Lambchop  photos I took last night at the  urlLink Summer Saturdae  at the  urlLink De Montfort Hall  in Leicester. Lighting conditions and my lack of photographic skill mean they are all of the 'atmospheric action shot' variety - ie. blurred and crap.  As usual, I can't remember what was played, though they started with  Moody Fucker  and  Up With People ,  Nothing Adventurous Please, Sunrise, Your Fucking Sunny Day , and  Nothing But A Blur From A Bullet Train  were all on the setlist.                          Taken with Nikon Coolpix 995. All images © Katie Fuller  I faced the biggest moral dilemma of my life so far when I had to leave  urlLink Lambchop  after  (Get A) Grip (On Yourself)  to go and see the  urlLink Super Furry Animals , another of my favouritest bands ever. They rocked, frankly, and whereas I've already seen  urlLink 'chop  once this year (at the Shepherd's Bush Empire) and twice more previously, I'd never seen  urlLink SFA  live before... God, it was hard, though.

      Are you a  urlLink Lambchop  fan? Then perhaps you'd be interested in contributing to this blog.   I'm going to add links to interviews, reviews, other websites, MP3s, photos etc, and write about what  urlLink Lambchop  means to me. Well, that's the plan, anyway. It would be great if other fans would like to join in.  urlLink Blogger  is very easy to use so don't worry if you're not a web wizard.
