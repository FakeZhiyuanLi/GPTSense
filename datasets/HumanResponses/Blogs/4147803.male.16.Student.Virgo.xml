       Hamara  "Bollywood " never seems to come of age. It has never been able to give any sorta competition to Hollywood, since there exists a yawning gap between da two. HW has always been far more advanced in almost every aspect of this job. The wackiest of wacky ideas and storylines have always been sparking off in HW.  Terminator, Matrix, Back to da future, Spiderman  et al are the quintessence of wild fantasy and fiction. The way they are picturized sets them apart from our BW. The picturization sends shivers down da spine since they seem so realistic. I guess, problem wit BW is dat da movie makers are never inclined towards experimentation. They target at ensconcing themselves rather than giving the sane audience somethin to cheer 'bout. They insert all kinda elements in da movie from steamy scenes, item numbers to cheap comedy aiming people of every age group and land up making a " khichdi " of a movie. Ironically, they are the winners since they are pretty aware of da fact that our country doesn't lack people, who actually love all da vulgarity and such stuff! On the other side, movies wit descent and realistic storyline are often seen fizzlin out and going pear shaped. Lakshya is an exemplar of this phenomena. This fact has encouraged the rise of such movies and has ensnared the industry. They have become inexorable and have tied chains around da BW. Theyâ€™ve stymied BW from seekin for imaginative ideas and have stopped its growth.

      What a day ! what a terribly screwd up dei. Nice weather but it hardly had any influence on my life . I'm totally pissed off...i'm rather teed off. Just keep on reading this damn blog even if i turn out to be abusive coz i've inherited this quality from my new school only recently, and it's tuff resistin it. I'm kumpletely outta sorts since I almost flunk'd in my exams... Got scolding from dad.. Life's playin dirty wit me . It basically sucks !! The idea of shoppin n dinin out wit my family this weekend ....seems no better than a joke.  nuke that ; Actually, wassup wit da world ...! Well, olympics 2004 is wat evryone's talking about. it's everywhere. Frankly, I have no interest in 'em and to me it's all crap. Its competitions n all are perfect yawners ! It's enuff denouncing and criticizing the world....I better look out for something else to fade my anger out !

      Hye folks ! this is for da first time I am writin a blog. It seems to be an exciting job. I feel I am inclined to it since I possess a very frank and transparent personality. I love people to get hanga me and bloggin is the best way to do so. I heard a lot about it in my new school DPS and was keen to give net bloggin a good shot. Yes ! I have joined DPS RK Puram after passing X from St. Xavier's with "fly(dy) ing "colours. I got into this school because I had heard a lot about its stupendous faculty, results, competitive spirits and Blah blah !! This school has 8K odd students. It is a huge school with many blocks which are perfectly crammed and is pandemonium of a place. On the other hand, St. Xavier's had unparalleled beauty. Its campus was huge and picturesque.  It's been a month since i joined it and feel that i was lucky to get into this school. I feel so because DPS has some kewl features - Least discipline , cell phones allowed , bunking's the child's play et al. The reasons why I feel lucky have just been said but why do my parents feel lucky ?? Well, the answer is da most expected i.e The skool has study-ish atmosphere and students have hell of competitive spirits despite absence of discipline. Sounds boring and "corny", ain't it ????
