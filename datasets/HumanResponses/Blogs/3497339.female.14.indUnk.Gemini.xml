"pooled" )).. and on July 7th i gotta get braces :(.. i wish i had straight teeth!!!  when i got home from school i watched "The Breakfast Club".. cuz allllll day me and Lindsay kept saying this one line from it (("Why does andrew get to get up? if he gets up, we'll all get up, it'll be anarchy")).. it all started cuz the fag that wears pinks shirts said it in class.. [[the anarchy thing]]..if you havent seen that movie then you should just be shot!! thats the greatest movie ever!! yes i said the greatest and it doesnt have adam brody or johnny depp in it!! :)  well i gotta finish my homework.. actually.. start it :)  write tomorrow.. hopefully
