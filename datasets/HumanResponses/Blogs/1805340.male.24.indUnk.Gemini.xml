       TiReD!!~!   Juz finished reading my case for a much-dreaded module... Investment Analysis. I think for the next few months, I won't be hafin any peace. All the readingz, cases, assignments, etc etc etc. By right it shouldn't be so hectic, but I still gotta work during the dayz tt I dun attend skol... meaning I haf to work on Mon, Thu and Sat. James (My boss) even asked mi to help him out after skol on Wed. Well, I couldn't possibly say no. I find it hard to say no. Anyway, I could put this extra money earned to good use, e.g. personal grooming... hee!! This time, I won't spend my money on alcohol anymore. It was a total waste of money!!  I think it's about time I adjust my bio-clock. Been staying up late and waking up early in the morning. Judging from the pathetic amount of sleep I get, it wouldn't be surprising if I collapse on the street one fine day.. choy!! But frankly speaking, I'm realli realli tired. Realli hope I can get a good nite's rest. I guess I haf to tahan till I quit the sickening job at Robinsonz. It;s been taking away much of my time and I can't even meet my project groupmates up for discussionz. Apologies for tt. Din want it tt way either, but no choice lehz.

       Human Nature Undefined   It was today that I realised how weak a bond between humans can get. Man are not forgiving by nature, however they are forgetful creatures. Why is that so? In times of need, you may be able to give their your fullest support to guide them through the rough patch; however the moment they can stand on their feet, they will begin to take the care and concern that you once showered them for granted. They will forget all the enduring times when they needed attention most. Isn't it so? To err is human, but how many of us are willing and able to forgive a person no matter how grievance his/her mistake is? To forgive is already not easy, but to accept the person as if nothing has happened is even a more profound knowlegde. It requires the generosity and courage that many of us are lacking.  I'm just wondering whether it's worth the while to commit yourself fully into any kind of relationship, be it love or friendship. End of the day, you may not reap what you sow. I mean it's kind of dumb to say you dun expect anything in return for the the effort that you have injected into the relationship. No one's a Saint. In any case, I suppose we should alwayz observe the market first before making any investment. It may turn out to ur dismay.  One good turn deserves another? I haf yet to experience...

       All About Mi!!   Finally my first public blog!! I shall begin by analysing myself, though keep having the impression that I dunno myself much... which is a sad thing. How could anyone be so unfamiliar with oneself? But that is me. i guess this is also the case for many people, losing themselves in the process of growing up. Really dread having to grow up and endure all the adult shit! Ok, back to the point. I'm basically a typical S'porean male who is going thru' the typical education system, from pri skol, to sec skol, to JC, and finally ended up in uni now. Personality? Erhmm.. I suppose I'm joyful, cheerful, fun-loving most of the time. To the extreme end, I could be depressed, negative, pessimistic. Split-personality?? Typical of Gemini rite?  Life in uni sux! Used to love going to skol intacting wif all my skol-mates but find it a chore now. Hardly find anyone who can understand me nor anyone whom I can confide in. Going to skol now seems like a mandane routine, attending all the boring lectures, n worse, mentally-torturing sectional tutorial!! There is no motivation at all! It could be due to my recent break-up. But is that the reason? I'm still wondering.  I know it's ridiculous to sound so depressing on my first go at the blog. But who knows? Mabbe thingz may turn out different as time goes by? Hopefully that's the case. Dun wanna live in uncertainty and pessimism all the time. Currently trying very hard to find my direction in life. Well, I'm already in my final year in pursue of a degree in Biz Admin. Haf to figure out my way sumhow. Sick of being a student! can't wait graduating n get to know life as it is. Reality may be cruel at times, but we haf to get exposed to it sooner or later. I guess life out there will certainly be intimidating, but at least it's a new horizon I haf yet to explore. Isn't it rite? I may sound childish in saying so, but I really need a breath of fresh air. Been trapped in here for too long. Know for sure that I will regret my choice in future... Who cares? For one, I'm finally independent. Dun haf to weigh my parents down at the very least.  Sad to say, I dun haf any decent hobbies as yet. I used to like ball games like soccer and basketball, but this is all in the past. Been trying to figure out what other interest that I might haf now, but alwayz arrive at the same conclusion... DRINKING! Over the past 2 months or so, I haf been drinkin in tremedous amount. Never in my life haf I drank that much! I know some pple would drown their sorrows in alcohol. For me, I dunno yet. To escape? But I'm fully aware that I still have to wake up the following day and face reality again. Then what is it? Not sure... Dun wish to know the answer either. In any case, promised myself not to drink so heavily in future unless there is a special ocassion. I will keep to my promise. I always do.   Rite now I'm quite persistent on a healthy lifestyle. In order to acheive that, I will follow an exercise regime which I drew up myself!! Hopefully, I can strike gold in the coming IPPT!!   Resolution in the new semester: Think positive and act dilligent!! Soundz crappy though.... Hee!

       LOST   I'm lost. After such a long time of searchin n ponderin, I haf to declare, I'm lost. I really can't find any direction in life. Initially wanted to get back my fitness, but gave up my exercise regime shortly. Intially wanted to stop clubbin for good, but discovered I'm already obssessed with it. Intially wanted to find my direction in life, but realised it was futile.  Anyway, I hafn't done anything much durin this period when I hafn't had any entries. I haf been tinkin wat might haf happened if I'm still attached. While it is true tt i couldn't stand being wif her anymore, I kept askin myself whether it was too rash a decision. I still dunno now. But in any case, I did not initiate the break-up. I was only a victim of circumstance though I was so tempted to initiate. Past experience had me badly hit. I did not wish to be a vilian; this time round, i want to play the victim. In this way, I won't regret my decision. In fact, I did not make any decision.  i watched the movie "Turn left, Turn right" on Wednesday. It was a great movie. Hafnt watched romance for a while since "My Sassy Gal". Actually I haf intended to watch with her but we broke up b4 the movie could even make it to the big screen. I think it must haf been a hint to mi. We are not fated. "even 2 parallel lines might meet one day", I dun tink so. Anyway, I enjoyed the movie thoroughly, all thanx to my companion, Yanling. Her giggles really added humour to the originally hilarious own plot!! HAha!! Come to tink of it, how could 2 parallel lines ever meet? I would concur wif the 2nd message though. "The kite in ur hand might juz break n fly away". Makes more sense to mi.  Hope everything will get better.

       MIA... BACK AGAIN!!   Gheez, forgetful mi.... completely forgot tt I haf a blog for the past few months when I was MIA. Dunno y either but I reali haf a short-term memory. It was until I stumbled across a forum discussion in www.funkygrad.com tt I remembered I "left sumthing behind", so I'm back!!  Sum updates: Final yr, final semester in NUS. Got a bit sick (in fact, damned sick!! :s) of skol life but at the same time I know tt this is my last chance to be protected. Afterwhich, everything will be ON MY OWN. Currently takin' 3 modules onli n thot tt it was supposed to be quite relaxin' this sem, however it turned out tt the UE, Japanese Languge, tt I haf chosen is tremendously hectic- 3days,7hrs/week!! Initially, Xikai took wif mi, but he played mi out n as a result, I'm now strugglin' alone. Aiyah, mabbe it may turn out to be a blessin' in disguise. It has alwayz been my wish to learn another language and Jap is definitely top of the list! Hope tt it will turn out fine. Other than tt, the rest of my Bizad modules are still manageable, but I'm afraid tt I'll be lettin' my group down (again??!?) coz I haf no more spark left in mi. As mentioned previously, I find no motivation in skol... lolx!  Hafn't done anithing worth mentionin' recently. Last X'mas was "celebrated" peacefully. Watched Ju-On2, had a gd fright n spent the rest of the silent nite @ RQ's place. New yr, we partied @ Zouk. Likewise for CNY eve, we danced to the blast of retro @ Zouk (not again??!? But indeed it was!!). Anyway, I got to know Weiguang's Australian friendz n hit it off quite well wif Min (A Korean-French ger, soundz cool!~!). It was then tt my perceptions of Koreans not being able to speak gd English (or at least proper, juz to be fair) and discrimmination of permed curly hair changed. Hahax! Her English is astonishingly gd (even better then Kok Boon's!!! Bwahahax!!). I used to think tt straight hair is in every aspect superior to permed curly ones, until I saw hers. Looks nice. :) Of coz, I still prefer straight, silky har... Hee!  Kok Boon has a gerfriend now. In fact, their reationship started last yr. Despite all the skeptism (or mabbe objections??) from "the rest of the world", I still give him my blessin'. He has nv treated a gerfriend tt nicely b4 n I could realli tell tt he loves her alotz. Hope their love will blossom.... realli... coz they would haf a tough road ahead if they want to maintain this relationship. When the going gets tough, fierce Kok gets going!! Way to go bro!!  Kenneth is still pretty much the same old him. Still livin' like a vampire. Sleepin' durin' the daytime, n huntin' for preys at nite. Hafn't seen him in the daytime for the past 4-5yrs. Weiguang will be flyin' to Australlia next Fri n I will definitely miss his absence. He has been such a terrific companion especially for Kenneth, in moments of fun n crime... hahahax! As for Ruiqiang (hereby known as RQ), he juz celebrated his 24th b'day. Actually, I haf planned to haf a sumptous dinner out wif him, but as thingz turned out, it flopped n we partied @ dbl-o (what?? not again??!?) Enjoyed ourselves aniway, so it was okay. Bro who is MIA- Teck Yong. Dunno how he is copin' n it is pretty obvious tt we r driftin' apart (mabbe coz of his mass?? more able to float??! lolx!) Nuthin' in common + lack of initiative + past conflict + different major = sad case. watever it is, TY will alwayz be a great buddy in my heart...  Update completed... till next time!!

       BoYcOtt LaSt JaP LeCtURe... KeKe!   Well, had hella a day 2day. Woke up quite early @ ard 8am... but my sleep was interrupted by a series of nitemares, n I'm referrin' to those supernatural thingy. EeeeK!! Can't exactly recall wat those dreamz were but  realli had a gd fright!! I tink I would like to dedicate my restlessness to who else but RQ who asked mi to send Jolin's album over. Had wanted to sleep earlier last nite, 'coz there r tons of work queuein' up @ my doorsteps n I can't seem to be able to handle them on time. But too bad. I'm such a worthy buddy. *haix*  Attended the Jap tut as usual. Then spent my 2-hr break in HSSML comp room lookin' for stuff relatin' to my project. *sighz* Yah, it was worth all the while gg there 'coz guess wat? I met VonnY!! But she was lookin' pretty haggard & worn-out then. So poor thing... if onli I was ard to take care of her... Bwahahaha! Anyway, I was hoping that my engine could get gg 2nite. Still haf got Jap oral 2mr. Wat a pathetic life!! How am I gonna survive??  Attended the last Jap lecture relunctantly. Couldn't possibly skip 'coz we were required to submit ALL the lecture quizzes!!! Luckili I finished everything in advance alr, includin' those lec tt I din attend. All thanx to the Vietnamese in my TA class!! Dunno her name till now, so forget it. Then being a frenly & approachable man, I volunteeringly lend my copy to Heather. This is the 2nd time I know sumone by this name... soundz beri unique wor. The other person by the same name tt I know is Heather Graham... but can't draw any connection between the 2 of them lehz...Kekeke!! Anyway, she's beri sweet-lookin' but alwayz put up such a stuck-up look durin' TB class. Surprisingly, she was rather chirpy when I tok to her juz now. Tink all along she was tryin' to attract my attention onli... H33! Oops! Tink I tink too much again! =P  If u were tinkin' I was such a gd student to haf attended the last lec, u r absolutely wrong!! I left half-way thru the lec, durin' the interval when the video clips were played (the lights were out, so I took the opportunity!!). This time round, I was out-witted 'coz the lights went back on as soon as I reached the exit. Everyone was starin' @ mi n sum were even gigglin' away... *haix* In the end, I juz got the hell otta the LT avoid myself from further embarrassment  or implications. Poor strategy for the "Great Escape" sia!! lolX!  It's alr 10plus now n I hafn't even got started. Can't blame mi. I skipped lec juz to take a nap. n it so happened tt I woke up @ 9pm!! Din want it to end up like this either. Guess I've better get crackin' now!! Today's target is to be as productive as possible!! Ganbate ne!@~!!  "Don't ever say that you don't have enough time. You have exactly the same number of hours in a day that were given to Helen Keller, Louis Pasteur, Michelangelo, Mother Teresa, Leonardo DA Vinci, Thomas Jefferson and Albert Einstein."

       tOwN oNe-DaY ToUR   Yah yah... went town 2day! Met Simin in RC for lunch first. I tink it has been quite sum time since we last makaned 2gether. Anyway, we went to Out-of-the-Pan in an Out-of-the-Place venue - the basement of Raffles Shoppin' Shoppin' Centre. Basicalli, the place there serves crepes. I ordered a korean pork crepes while Simin decided to go for the smoked ham. Both were juz as nice!! But the highlight muz haf been my stawberry milkshake!! It was absolutely fabulous (Woo.... Ahhhh!!!) n I hafn't had one for like... ages?? ^_^ Dunno since when, it has become my favourite drink other than iced lemon tea. Tink I prefer the former though.... H33!!  Then I accompanied her go shoppin' ard RC for her "interview attire". Wanted to look for Auntie Wee but unfortunately, she wasn't ard. Nevertheless, met my SOP platoon mate Melvin. He's workin' as Simmon's promoter now... Had a small tok wif him and left. As anticipated, we left the mall empty-handed... Keke! Followin' tt, we went to Funan to meet up wif her cousin (??) to teach her Econs. *Haix* Econs nid tuition one mehz? Juz memorise enuff alr mahz!! HahaX!! Speakin' from lame old experience. Initialli, wanted to give Jolene a surprise visit in Challenger, but later realised tt she's workin' in the office. Opps! Should haf asked Ken earlier... H33!  Subsequently, I went to Taka alone to return Jaslyn her vcds. The irony is, I borrowed for such a long time (4mths? 5mths?) but I watched onli the 1st two episodes. Keke!! Not my fault also, 'coz I dun like the plot n I haf no time to go down town previously mahz. Excuses again. =P Of coz alone in Orchard muz go CP visit all my " ancestors" lahz. I met up wif Micheal... and had sum casual toks wif Jessie(s), Ong peh peh, Cindy, DeLi, Mingfa, Irene(s). Tinkin' back, realli miss the good old dayz in CP. But I still prefer the time when RS was still ard... more fun, less politics. *sighz*  Feast of the day: I MET ROSALIND PHO IN PERSON!!! Oh my goodness!! She looks even better in person!!! Couldn't take my eyes off her. Tempted to take a photo wif her, but shyness got the better of mi... ohhhh.... Wat a shame! This was my 2nd time seein' her in Orchard. The first, she was wif the cast of Lightyears. Speakin' of which, dunno y it went off-screen. Mabbe last week was the finale of the season? This, I seriously doubt, 'coz it didn't look like the case!! *Haix* There goes my Elle... *Sob Sob* Always on my mind... gosh!  Watched the finale of Nezha... wasn't in time to watch but all thanx to my sis who recorded it!! H33!! Then now strugglin' to get my brains crackin' on the SIA case. If onli HuiShi can help us on this.. but atlas! Nvm, as the sayin' goes, all roads lead to Rome. We will handle it... sumhow or another. HahaX! It's realli quite "fatal" for mi, coz I haf Jap oral and prj mitin' on thu. Still decidin' which one to priorise... *3 x Haix* God! Bless this fine young lad (Read:Mi) pls!!! Amen.  "If you can't sleep, then get up and do something instead of lying there and worrying. It's the worry that gets you, not the loss of sleep."

       RaiNy DaY   Another rainy day. Dun understand y it rains so much this yr. It has been forecasted tt the amt. of annual precipitation would be the most in history. Wonder wat's wrong wif the atmosphere... global warmin'? Aiyah, who cares? @ least not mi. I'm seriously lackin' in social responsibility... Keke!   In the end, stayed home the whole day ytd. No choice lahz, they all dun wanna mit. So be it lohz. Anyway, had actualli wanted to haf a simple meal wif Kok 2day ('coz it's his b'day) but he hafin dinner wif his family... includin' June!!! Quite shocked when I heard this, but like wat he mentioned, "the ugly daughter-in-law has to meet her mum-in-law sum day". H33!! Juz hope she will be accepted, though it will be quite unlikely tt she would gain acceptance @ the 1st encounter... for sophisticated reasonz... Hahahax!  Other than Kok & Kenneth bday, it was oso Jinyi's b'day on 27th (sat). She distributed Rocher to the whole class durin' our "finale" lesson 2day. Fianlli got the chance to tok to her one-to-one. So all along, it's her father who drove her after lessonz. Initially thot tt it was her suitor.. h33!! Tink too much again...   But the conversation was short-lived 'coz her bus came early. Anyway, it was nice chattin' wif her. =)  Din prepare for my quiz, so hopefulli Sharon's answers were right. (Nid I explain more?) Keke! Had planned to study @ least a bit durin' the bus journey to skol, but slept thru'out!! H33!! Too much late nitez..  Later gotta mit online for R&I preoject. Sumtimes realli at a dilemma. Wanna mit for discussion coz Vonny would be ard; @ the same time, pressurised by her presence!! Her expectation does not tally wif ours... so haf to be on our toes all the time. Haix. Can't stand focused woman, esp. those doin' doing honours... *sianz*  "Remember that silence is sometimes the best answer."

       ReLak oNe CoRneR   Slept till 3pm in the afternoon. Long time hafn't had such a luxury to sleep till this late... h33! Anyway, was hopin' tt I can spend the rest of the day lyin' in the comfort of my own bed. Keke! It's now drizzlin' outside, so dun tink I will haf the urge to go out. Dunno wat else to do now. Japanese tutorial can wait... even the quiz can wait. So now juz hang ard, enjoy the serenity of the raindrops. Since when haf I become so sensual har?? H33! Beats mi.  2mr still haf lessons. Haix. The rest of them not gg to skol w.e.f. last friday. Onli I'm ill-fated. *Sighz*  it's not tt I mind attendin' classes, it's the company thingy. Go skol oso no kaki. All those Japanese classmates r onli those type of Hi-bye friendz n I'm skeptical tt we may still keep in touch after I graduate (which is soon!!). Nevertheless, still got to know quite a few gd frenz!! First & foremost is Xiaoming! My buddy in TA 1! Wifout him, my quizzes would haf been atrocious! Then his "homefolk", RuiMing, whom I believe is ard my level where Japanese is concerned... Bwahahaha! Next will be Sharon & Jinyi... they haf been so approachabe durin' lessons!! *wink wink* As for TB class, my closer palz r Ee-laine & Soo Qing. Both beri farnie one, so I alwayz make fun of them, esp. Ee-laine!! Keke! Lesson I alwayz arrange everyone's except her chair one... H33!! Sad to say, TC I dun haf any "better" friendz.. Not worth mentionin'.    Too bad beri few guyz in my class, otherwise, I would haf been gd frenz wif them!! Anyway, Juz brace myself for my probably last encounter wif them! Juz try to cherish my last of frenz in my education life. Soundz so depressin". Kekeke!  Later mabbe gg out when the rain ceases. Hopefulli can mit up wif Kok n Kenneth for a kopi session bahz. Wait & c wat happens then. Tata!

       YaWnZ   HahaX!! I survived last nite. Not too much booze though... 'coz I wasn't the lead role... h33! Kok n Kenneth were goners. The rest of them? I dunno. 'Coz I left earlier (Can't possibly say early since we left ard 3). Anyway, din wanna stay on too long. Kok left the earliest ard 12 plus. But he realli had a bit (in fact, alot!!) too much. Tink he left wif his beau, June. btw, she juz touched down ytd. So thotful, even bought Kenneth n Andy bday gifts. Given my gf, nah.... dun tink she will bother @ all... Keke.  Juz a brief description of the flow of events. Junping n I reached Zouk @ ard 8 plus for the stamp. Followin' tt, we went makan @ the kopi tiam ard tt area. Saw Kok n June while makin' our way back ... Met up wif Andy, Noman n the rest of their IA friends as well. Went back in together, had the complimentary drinkz, Gary came along, RQ n Sisi arrived shortly, then waited till 11 for the 1-for-1!! Eugene joined us, Ken came. B4 the clock struck 12, Kok was alr dipsy (or shld i juz say drunk??!!? lolX!). Kenneth? Needless to say, he was alr in his own promised land. H33! Luckily, Marcus was there to take care of him. I was in charge of distributin' the drinkz, so din haf much. Surprisingly, Qiuli turned up n both of us went home together 'coz she was complainin' of gastric pain; n I was too nonchalant to the atmosphere in the club. No drinkz, no babes, no motivation. However, I felt tt I had done Ken a misdeed. It was a mistake askin' him here... for obvious reasonz.  Dunno y still woke up so early this mornin'. Not sleepy? Nah... Slept for ard 3 hrs the nite b4... then last nite slept so late. *Yawnz*Tink gg to catch many-a-shut-eye later. Keke! Now watchin' my beloved Jolin on TV!! *Droolin'*   Gotta make the best otta this weekend!! :)       "Tomorrow may never come. Give and accept what you have today."

       Maybe   Maybe... We are supposed to meet the wrong people before meeting the right one so that, when we finally meet the right person, we will know how to be grateful for that gift.                                                                       Maybe... when the door of happiness closes, another opens; but, often times, we look so long at the closed door that we don't even see the new one which has been opened for us.                                                                        Maybe... it is true that we don't know what we have got until we lose it, but it is also true that we don't know what we have been missing until it arrives.                                                                                                                                      Maybe... the happiest of people don't necessarily have the best of everything; they just make the most of everything that comes along their way.                                                                                                                                             Maybe... the brightest future will always be based on a forgotten past; after all, you can't go on successfully in life until you let go of your past mistakes, failures and heartaches.                                                                                                           Maybe... you should dream what you want to dream; go where you want to go; be what you want to be, because you have only one life and one chance to do all the things you dream of and want to do.                                                                                               Maybe... there are moments in life when you miss someone -- a parent, a spouse, a friend, a child -- so much that you just want to pick them from your dreams and hug them for real.                                                                                                                Maybe... the best kind of friend is the kind you can sit on a porch and swing with, never say a word, and then walk away feeling like it was the best conversation you've ever had. We should all have one.                                                                                         Maybe... you should always try to put yourself in others' shoes. If you feel that something could hurt you, it probably will hurt the other person, too.                                                                                                                                           Maybe.... you should do something nice for someone every single day, even if it is simply to leave them alone.                                                                                                              Maybe... giving someone all your love is never an assurance that they will love you back. Don't expect love in return; just wait for it to grow in their heart; but, if it doesn't, be content that it grew in yours.                                                                                                                                                 Maybe... happiness waits for all those who cry, all those who hurt, all those who have searched, and all those who have tried, for only they can appreciate the importance of all the people who have touched their lives.                                                                              Maybe... you shouldn't go for looks; they can deceive. Don't go for wealth; even that fades away. Go for someone who makes you smile, because it takes only a smile to make a dark day seem bright. Find the one that makes your heart smile.                                                                                                                       Maybe... you should hope for enough happiness to make you sweet, enough trials to make you strong, enough sorrow to keep you human, and enough hope to make you happy.                                                                                                                                And the last maybe..... when you were born, you were crying and everyone around you was smiling.  Maybe...you should try to live your life so that when you die, you are the one who is smiling and everyone around you is crying.                                                            _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _   Maybe there is a God up above....who may understand, and be merciful.

Anyway, I know the best way to escape from a problem is to solve it... aiyah... easy to say onli... h33!  I wanna fly away. To a land where there's no tomorrow. I wanna live in the past 'coz I'm scared of uncertainty. I'm skeptical abt the future. I fear tomorrow. I juz wanna dump everything aside & get the hell otta here!!

       tHe eYe... KtV   Watched The Eye 2 last nite wif Yanling. Actualli, I din expect the movie to be such a flop. The plot was far from average, the cast sux (n I'm referrin' to Hsu Qi), the frightenin' scenes were ... erhmmm... hilarious??). Anyway, din realli enjoy the movie n for a moment, I even forgot that I've juz watched this movie.. H33!  After movie, I went to join RQ n Luchang for a KTV session, together wif PS, ah Lian n Sisi. Sang till ard 3am. But Luchang n the rest left earlier coz they haf other committments (work n skol) the followin' mornin'. Subsequently, RQ sent mi home. Damned tired... fell asleep as soon as I touched down for my bed.  I woke up @ 2.30pm juz now. Still feelin' abit lethargic. I tink this is one of the syptoms of gettin' old? kekeke!  Watched TV, went for lunch, then finalli got my butt down to stay online. Dunno y I couldn't log on MSN but in any case, tt'z not crucial.  I went to check if TY has accepted the testimonial on Friendster tt i wrote him. It turned out to my dismay. Sighz... I dun tink we can realli go back to the good old dayz. Moreover, our character has nv been similar, 'xcept for the bit that we like to tok. In fact, our personalities r far from close. Different expectation of life, different attitude towardz life etc. I tried alr, mabbe not hard enuff... but I tink tt could suffice, juz to make myself more at ease n less self-reproachin'.  Then, I haf been tinkin' if I should drop Kiki a testimonial as well. Habn't been in contact for such a looo...ong time. Dunno how she is now. Not tt I still can't get over her. It's tt I alr gave my promise to her late-mum tt I will take care of her. I know I've failed miserably. Now, I'm still guilty for not being able to fulfill my promise. Of coz I can still take care of Kiki, like an elder brother does onto his younger sis. However, She gave mi no chance @ all. She juz shut mi out!! NEVERMIND! As if I'm interested to interfere wif her "interesting" life!! I dun give a damn. Now, wat I can do @ the veri least is to make sure tt her younger bro, JX, is copin' fine. He's quite close wif mi, so I can find out thingz from him as well as keep an eye on him.   Dunno wat else to do now. 2mr got a kanji quiz, then after I finish my kanji assignment, there will be nth left to do. Or rather, there would be nth I feel like doing, e.g. IFM & R&I projects. Tink of these 2 I feel sianz. Anyway, watever has to come, will come. C how it goes bahz. Mabbe thingz aren't as bad as it seems. It could be worse!! Hahahax! Guess I will be online for the whole day... though sad to say, HS will be away from town for a holiday in Phuket for the next 3 dayz. tt meanz she won't be online. *SiaNz* It'z been such a pleasant experience tokin' to her.... n even ting, 'coz they r @ least willin' to accompany an eng man to waste his life away... Bwahahaha!!  Now I'm gg to take a nap. Later wake up watch NeZha... H33!! I will be back! Dun worry!!

       HaPPY daYz r HeRe aGaiN!!   Been quite an unusually hectic week. Finished my projects on time, completed my last quiz for IFM, flunked my Japanese mid-term 2, initiated our IFM project due on 26th March... but I'm delighted to announce, HaPPY daYz r HeRe aGaiN!!!!!!! Nevertheless, dun feel like partyin' @ all lehz, though it'z a "joint celebration". Kenneth n Kok's b'day comin' ya know? This time realli jiat lat sia... 26th--- armageddon? Kekeke!!  Watched a 'live ' telecast of a tragedy last friday (12th March) and I was partially guilty of it. No wish to mention it now. Anyway, sent my friend home and puked in his livin' room. OMFG!!! All my planz for tt weekend shattered as I've intended to utilise my time on academic stuff... it was all smashed due to this episode... haix!!! First time I encountered this sia... n hopefulli it's not gg to happen again.     Had a major hangover the followin' day... was scheduled to meet for project @ 2pm... but I turned up @ 4pm. Then on the way to skol, I could still "taste" the tequilla in mi, felt like vomittin' then... but managed to tahan all the way to skol. It was an "eventful" weekend. Notice the scarcism in the statement. lolX!  Followin' tt, nth excitin' happened. Got to know a tiNg tiNg from friendster... 18 yrs of age... beri ..... erhmmm.... articulative?? h33!! Beri spontaneous n intiative... tok to her over msn a couple of times and even thru' the phone. We r juz as crappy, mabbe she more, coz of age bahz, i guess. She dares to tok abt anytin under the sun... the moon in this case... n no topic is a taboo to her. n i was like a consellor mentorin' her... keke! Onli got the share of listenin to her so-called happenin' eventz.... e.g. catholic-turned-Christian-turned-taoist-turned-vegetarian; her enchantin' animal-lovin'-turned-scarifice story.... Bwhahaha! It was hilarious, but a pity, I wasn't in my rite state of mind. Too sleepy then... dun get mi wrong... the topic even extended to platic surgery, bust enhancement etc. Is crappy or is she crappy?? H33!!!  I volunteered to compile the IFM data coz I was too eng n I haf completed tt. Nth left in my agenda now, so I can afford to waste my time here writin' the blog... to help mi rem the events!!! Now waitin' for destiny to come onto mi... n I dun even noe wat I meant in sayin' tt. RoFL!! Anyway, juz waitin' for.... I noe wat.... She's online now. thump, thump, thump! WTF is wrong wif mi? Mabbe I'm infatuated... erhmm.. mabbe not. Juz empty?? Hahax! Loser!!  I nid a miracle, or mabbe wat I nid is courage? or.... ...

       BUTTERFLY EFFECT   Oh my gosh, it's already March n I hafn't done even any single bit of preparation for my projectz. Now the deadlines are drawin' now! The best bit is instead of doing research for my damned IFM (International Fcukin' Module) n R&I (Ridiculous & Idiotic), I'm actually spendin' my time writin' this blog!! This guy (Read: mi!!) really has got no sense of urgency. Dunno whether he realises one small thing he does now can trigger a hella consequences. Speakin' of which, I muz say this show (n i meant "tHe butteRfLy eFFeCt", duhz!) was terrific! Could easily be my favourite movie of the year!! Great plot, superb cast (Ashton Kutcher + Amy Smart). Shan't further elaborate on the story though. Can juz abstract from any movie review webby.   Been rather slacked all this while. Spent most of my valuable (or izzit?) time online, downloadin' movies, updatin' friendster, check mails, log in icq, log out icq, log in again, look (n literally lookin' only) for online job application. Haix... Really pathetic life sia. BTW, happened to come across this girl, HuiShi, when I sent Guang to the airport. Really coincidental tt I bumped into her, coz nv did expect her to become an air stewardess (but how the hell I know, coz I haf nv spoken to her). Another more interestin' thing is tt the gal who went wif her was from Saints too! N she knows mi! (Though I din know her, but got to know tt she's Janice). Anyway, found her familiar then, but din dare to approach, coz scared later I malu myself (again??). Then dunno how she managed to find mi in friendster! I was so stunned when she messaged mi. It's like, it has nv come across my mind tt I would make an effort to find sumone, esp. when I haf nv spoken to tt person b4, though we used to be in the same pri. skol.   I began to realise one thing. If I haf made the initiative to know her when I was in pri. skol, wat might haf happened. The "mystery" tt puzzled the both of us is tt though we did not know each other personally, we still remember each other's name! (well, sorta. Except I got HuiShi n ShiHui jumbled up. She's even worse, onli remember I'm sum "Yi"). But still ok lahz, at least we still recognise each other. If given sum other person from her class, I might not recognise him. Mabbe I was sub-consciously "payin' more attention" to her in pri. skol bahz. ttz the expaination I found so far. kekeke!  Okay, now to the point. This event set me ponderin'. If I haf the ability to travel back in time (juz like Ashton in the movie), wat aspect of life would I change? A. Get to know HuiShi? (which is pretty dumb coz of the vomit blood after-effect thingy); B. Do sth abt. my 'O'/'A' Levels? (then I can become a scholar, which I sacastically doubt); C. Hold back all the hurtful abuses tt I inflicted on a few individuals? (n I know there's quite a handful of them); D. Remain as it is? (it's onli a fictitious scenerio anyway... yah, i know, i'm a loser here); or E. Sum of the above/ Others? (n this option will look beri familiar to FM students. If u get wat i mean). My instinct would tell mi C. A rationale choice would haf to be D. If I'm dumb/crazy/stupid/lame etc, I would choose A. Lolx!  Being risk-averse (n I'm referin' to the typical kiasee type), D is my final decision (sorta expected). Dun wanna change anything, at least for now. Whoever I fail to know in the past, I will get to know them along the way. Thus, no use clingin' on to sumthing (be it anyone e.g. teddy bear on the shelf of Robinson's toy department or anything else) tt u yearned for so much (not referin' to anything/ anyone in particular. Any coincidences caused is deeply regretted) but not being able to get hold of it. I'm a strong believer of fate. Whatever belongz to u will be urs eventually; the more u hold on to it, the more it will slip away. I may not be a scholar, but at least I acheived the goal I made in sec. skol --- NUS Bizad. Here I m.... n the irony is, I din realli work towards this goal. Fate.   Comin' so far, I haf to confess tt I haf hurt sum pple. I do not dare ask them for forgiveness, much less to forget abt. wat has happened. Wat I want is to know the truth... coz I realli dunno wat was it I said tt inflicted such a "catastrophic" impact. I dun regret hafin said those thingz. An attempt to return to the past would be fruitless, coz I won't say it only once. Juz live wif it bahz. Juz like my philosophy in life: Live as the day passes. Everybody yearns for a perfect endin', but there isn't any perfect endin', is there? u can't please everyone, so f*ck it! Sumtimes, it pays to be selfish. A pity, I'm not. I compromise on the perfection. I'm not even close. Unattainable. Untouchable. Unlikely. Unimaginable.  I dun wanna go back in time. I scared of livin' life once more. I'm resistance to changes. I'm juz a traditional, old-fashion hermit livin' in a world of my own. Moreover, I found my life here. This dimension is where I met my best pals. Dun wanna lose them for anything. We haf come a long way n I really treasure this bond.  thinkin', thinkin', thinkin'.......

       FaCiNaTiN' FaCtS aBt. WoMeN!!   Wanna know how a woman feels? Wanna beat them to their own game?? Sorta got these facts (or opinions??) abt. women. Dunno whether they're true, 'coz I'm blessed wif a baton between my groin and discountin' the fact tt I can't langa pple wif my breasts (Read: Chest!!) nor can I long pang pple wif my butt. I'm a MAN!! How the hell I know how a woman feels?? Anyway, who cares abt women?? Erhmmm... actually I do.... Keke!! Ahem, Well then.... Presentin' "35 THINGS ABOUT WOMEN!!!" *cLaP cLaP cLaP* Those in italics are my comments... tink moz guyz will concur to those... Hee!  1. When a girl says she's sad, but she isn't crying, it means she's crying in her heart.  (Then go bloody show it lahz!! Is she retarded or wat??)    2. When she ignores you after you've done something wrong, it's best to give her some time to cool down before touching her heart with an apology.   (Moral of the story: Ignore her)   3. Never tell the girl you REALLY like about your "crush" on another girl just to get her jealous, it'll only give her the impression that you r not interested.  (Tell her abt ur crush on another guy instead. Mabbe thingz may work out. Keke!)    4. A girl can't find anything to hate about the guy she loves (which is why it is so hard for her to 'get over him'after the relationship's over.)   (n guyz will find every reason to hate the ger)    5. If a girl loves a guy, he will always be on her mind every minute of the day, even though she flirts with other guys.   (Erhmm... for mi, I won't even flirt... I beri devoted one lehz!!)    6. When the guy she likes smiles and stares deep into her eyes, she will melt.   (Yah, no wonder gers alwayz say they're meltin' on a sunny day when they're wif mi)   7. If you really like a girl, tell her, don't hesitate she might feel the same way. If it's just an infatuation, DON'T.  (n there's a higher chance tt she might feel otherwise. Dun bang urself into tt wall!!)    8. A girl likes to hear compliments, but usually is not sure how to react to them.   (Like wat I've mentioned, gers r retarded... :S)    9. When a particular guy flirts with a girl very often, a girl would start thinking the guy likes her. So if you treat a girl just as a friend, go easy on the smiles and stare ok?   (tt's y I dun alwayz  flirt wif onli one ger, get it??)    10. If you don't like a girl who likes you, break it to her gently.   (but still screw her if she doesn't mind *eViL gRiN*)    11. If a girl starts avoiding you after you reject her, leave her alone for a while. If you still treat her as a friend, talk to her.   (n reject her again!! HahahaX!!)    12. Girls enjoy talking about what they feel. Music, poetry, drawings and writing are ways of expressing themselves (which explains why most girls like writing journals).    (Hey!! I'm a guy n I like writin' journals!! LCB!!)   FYI, LCB = Lao Chee By  13. Never tell a girl that she is useless in any way.   ('coz at least she can fuck b4 givin' birth, n milk after givin' birth. Can guyz??)   14. Girls might sound uninterested when you ask her to be your girlfriend, it's their way of  playing hard to get, she doesn't want to seem too available.So don't give up.  (Or mabbe she simply detest u. So give up.)    15. Being too serious can turn a girl off.   (n SEX is supposed to turn them on!! Weee~~!)    16. When the guy she likes calls her for the first time, the girl may act uninterested during the call.  But as soon as the phone is back on the hook, she will whoop with joy and immediately start telephoning her friends to spread the news.   (I confirmed once again... gers are retarded  -.-'")    17. A smile means a lot to a girl.   (n SEX means alot to a guy)    18. If you like a girl, try making friends with her first. Let her get to know you.   (n try MAKING OUT wif her friends as well. Wordz of mouth count alot here.)    19. If a girl says she can't go out with you because she has to study, leave.   (unless she's not a student... tryin' to smoke u nia.)    20. But if she still calls you or expect a call from you, stay.   (in anticpation for some passionate moments... Hee!)    21. Don't try to guess a girl's feelings. Ask her.   (n she'll give u a spastic look & a retarded ans)    22. Hearing the words "I love you" is a great reassurance to a girl that she is beautiful.  (n sayin' "u r beautiful" is a great confirmation tt we want SEX!!)     23. After a girl falls in love with a guy, she'll wonder why she never noticed him  before.   (Probably she doesn't notice the guy even now... *SoB SoB*)    24. If you need tips on how to flirt with a girl,read romance stories.   (Pornography helps too!! Mabbe even more!!)   25. When class pictures come out, a girl would first check who is standing next to her crush before actually looking at herself.   (Told u they're retarded... now u get the pt??)    26. A girl's ex-crush will always be in her memory, but the guy she loves now stays in her heart.   (So juz be contented tt u get her body... it's hard to haf best of 3 worldz)     27. Girls love having fun!   (Guyz love havin' fun wif gerz!!)    28. A simple 'Hi' can brighten a girl's day.   (Similarly, a complicated 'Hi' can piss them off for the whole day)    29. A girl's best friends usually know best what she is feeling and going through.   (A guy's best frendz usually go thru wat he is feelin'... e.g. Drinkin' sessions when he's down n out... *HaiX* tt remindz mi)    30. Girls hate it when a guy pays attention to them just to get close to their 'prettier' friend.  (Then dun be so ulgy in the 1st place lahz!!! DuHz!!)   31. Most girls would wait for the guys to make the first 'move', so guys DON'T hold back.   (GO ALL OUT!! GIVE IT TO HER!! YEAH BABY YEAH!!)    32. Love means devotion, caring and happiness to a girl, in that order.   (Devotion, carin' and happiness means makin' love to a guy, in any order)    33. Some girls care about looks, some care about brains, but ALL girls want a guy who will love and care for them.   (But it alwayz happen tt those they chose r the rich ones... Keke!!)     34. Girls want nothing more than to feel loved  (tt explains y guyz constantly make them... So ill-fated hor guyz..)   35. Don't wait too long to confess your true feelings.Girls might end up moving on.  (Who doesn't?? Spastic remark!!)    So now u know how hard it is to satify a ger?? The root of it all is probably they r retarded moz of the time to notice wat u haf done for her, n usually take a century (or 2)to show u a spastic look to show her appreciation. No wonder pple alwayz say "It's alwayz hard to please a woman". I couldn't agree more. On the other hand, men r easier to please. Juz SEX n sum BJs, they will be totally in love wif u. If ever we leave u, blame it on ur poor skills n lack of innovation bahz!! HahahahaX!!   "It is our duty as men and women to proceed as though the limits of our abilities do not exist"

       FaTe aGaiN??   Went to an interview juz now. Actualli I was expectin' sum sorta MLM company 'coz I dun remember fillin' in any applications for any "unknown" job recently. But then, I juz went, probably due to the fact tt I haf nth better to do, juz to kill time bahz... HahaX!! b4 I stepped in (btw, it's call East Wing... Part of my WiNg'S clan.. Keke), I made up my mind to leave immediately if it's an MLM company. In the end, it realli turned out to my dismay. *SiGhZ*   However, sumtin made mi stayed on although my prediction came true. Surprise!! Surprise!! I realized tt the pple workin' there r actually those who worked in DW previously (n the coincidental thing is I haf attended a similar interview there!!) Well, I could haf left there & then, but then it was such a pleasant surprise meetin' these pple (Daniel, Corrine, Kelvin, Christ) again!! H33! Too bad, my mind was pretty much set, so regardless how hard (& long) Daniel tried to persuade mi, I rejected the job offer flat. Dun like the strategy and approach of the company... More imptly, it's a matter of pride. Workin' there does not require any paper qualifications, so any Tom, Dick or Harry can juz enter the industry. I believe I'm worth more than tt. n I trust tt I can crave a better future elsewhere. Anyway, got to know a new friend, Fiona... She's the one who rang mi up, but then we hit it off realli well. (aiyah, I haf gd interpersonal skills mahz... H33!) Even jio mi for KTV one of these dayz... Tink I'm gg to play disappearin' act again... lolX!     Initially planned to go Zouk, but then shelved the idea 'coz couldn't find any kaki. *HaiX* Nowadayz, beri hard to find clubbin' kakis. Dun understand y I so frenly, but it seems tt my social circle is contractin' sia!!! *ShOcK* Perhaps I know pple in quantity but not quality bahz, tt explains y I'm not realli close to most of them. But one thing I'm alwayz proud of is, I haf a family who will alwayz be there whenever I fall, and a group of damn lagi gd frenz who alwayz wants mi to be there whenever they fall otta love.... *HaiX* Nevertheless, I appreciate tt!! :)  It's alr 4.30am n I'm still awake!! HahaX! ICQin' wif Jialong now. He juz came back from work (in Zouk) n waitin for his hair to dry. Keke! It's been realli a long long time since we both last had a gd tok. The most recent one was probably the time when Huishi PMed mi in Friendster but tt was like decades ago??!? H33!!! Anyway, he's one gd friend (in fact, my most bestest friend in pri skol!!!) tt I can't afford to lose n I will definitely try hard to maintain this friendship!! =) Best piece of news I've heard all day: He's attached!!! Finalli, after 24yrs of waitin'!!! Now I can assure RQ tt no nid to fear no gf... it's juz a matter of time. Juz tt we haf to meet the wrong pple before we meet the right one. tt applies to mi too!! H33! n the wrong pple I met so far... Kok Boon, Kenneth, Guang, RQ...... BwahahahahaX!!! Anyway, Yeah for Jialong, n hopefulli his relationship wif Wei Wei will blossom!!!  Then I can attend his weddin' banquet!! H33!!   "The beginning of love is to let those we love be perfectly themselves, and not to twist them to fit our own image. Otherwise we love only the reflection of ourselves we find in them."

       SaTuRDaY NiTe FeVeR   Not tt I partied last nite, but rather, did lotsa unexpected stuff. We had originally planned to watch soccer match b/w Man United & Liverpool @ Cafe Cartel in MS, but later decided to change the venue to PS instead, in order to facilitate our dear Mr. Kenneth Lee (he's gg Orchard, u c?) Anyway, we settled down in Piazza (a cafe b/w Atrium & PS). HahahaX. Was supposed to queue up @ the entrance to wait to be served, but aH WiNg unknowingly went to occupy a vacant seat and asked for the menu!! Keke! The waitress was oso quite confused then... but wat could she do?? H33!! Blur mi!!! Then was feelin' pai seh durin' my stay there but who cares?? We've got the seat!! tt's all it matters.. BwahahahaX!   In the end, Liverpool won 1-0. Needless to say, Ken looked quite disgusted wif the score-line; the same could not be said abt Kenneth. H33! He's an Arsenal fan, tt's y... Keke! Anyway, guess most of the pple dinin' there were Liverpool fans (or anti-devil. Watever.) They would groaned whenever the devils had a goal-scorin' opportunity n cheered whenever Liverpool delivered a goal-threatenin' cross. The moz obvious was when the latter scored their first & onli goal of the match. The crowd was utterly exhilarated and sum even applauded. Din know tt there's so many Liverpool fan nowadays, or shld I say anti-devils? Keke! Haf alwayz thot tt bein' a Man U fan is a norm... but it definitely din look like the case then. Ken was an 'xception perhaps?? Or mabbe the rest of their supporters were bein' suppressed by the majority... lolX!  After the match, we were @ a loss as to wat to do next. I suggested gg for a movie, but we couldn't reach a consesus wat movie to watch. I wanted to watch "Into the Mirror" or "Dawn of the Dead" (Kenneth onli wanted the latter onli), but KB & Huiyng(?) preferred sth "Boxer" (Can't rem lahz... it's a Thai show.. Nahz... no interest either). Therefore, we ruled out watchin' movie. Then Huiying suggested gg East Coast Park out of the blue.... n sumhow, there was no violent objection abt her proposal. Damn farnie... H33! Reached there alr oso nth to do 'xept sittin' down, tokin' cock, but realized there wasn't realli much cock tt we can exploit... HaiX! Once again, Huiying came up wif an absolutely brilliant idea (n dun take my word for it.. -.-) We left East Coast Park in less than 15min n proceeded to CHANGI VILLAGE!!! OMG!! I haf no idea y we went there but accordin' to a reliable source (Jolin.. Keke!), they wanted to c the aH gua's there. Aiyah, wat's the big deal abt ah gua?? Watever they haf, we oso haf... mabbe they're bigger onli lohz. On the other hand, watever they used to haf, we haf it now, so it makes more sense for them to look for us instead mahz... H33!! Another one of those WiNg'S nonsensical theories. I'm more interested in the Nasi Lemak instead... Hehe! But, to my disappointment, they were all sold out, n Huiying got the LAST PLATE!!! Damit! Wat frustrated mi even more was tt she din finish it... Wah lau, wat a waste!!! #@$@#!@$ She will get her retribution... bWaHaHaX! Eventualli, the rest of us onli drank n watched her eat. *sNiFF sNiFF* :'-(  Followin' tt, tink it was alr abt 2.30am bahz. Huiying drove Ken & Jolin back, n KB no choice had to drive Kenneth n I home. Was feelin' abit hungry, so decided to stop over @ Clementi Teck Hin Kopi Thiam for supper. Kinda feel sorry for KB 'coz he picked mi up from JW, drove to Orchard, East Coast, Changi, Clementi then gotta send us back home 1st b4 gg back to Woodlandz. Muz haf been damn tirin' on his part... *HaiX* If onli I haf a car. At least can share his burden. Hopefulli, sumone can buy mi a car soon. Mabbe my wish can be fulfilled this bday... beri hard to say wor... H33!!!  Nth interestin' happened 2day. Had planned to maintain a healthy lifestyle by hafin a soccer game, but RQ played us out. We went to the soccer court alr, but he called mi to inform tt Luchang, JianYang & he din feel like playin'. Oh well, so be it. In any case, tink I'm gg for a run later. Go sweat it out!!  "The more you know the less you need to say."

       Friday    Can't tink of any appropriate title for 2day, so left it as "Friday" bahz... Keke! In the mornin' my beauty sleep kena interrupted by Jean, the job consultant. Damit!! Had wanted to sleep until 12pm, then prepare to mit Ken in town. However, my plan was foiled by the phone call. Anyway, she called up @ 8.30am to pester mi for my resume. *HaiX* Therefore, being god-damn responsible as usual, I got up to edit my resume n send her. Was 'xtremely sleepy then 'coz went to bed @ 4am.... *YaWnZ* Stayed online to look for potential movies to d/l 1st b4 I forced myself to take a nap @ 11am. Luckily Ken sms mi @ 1.30pm to check if I'm still asleep, otherwise, god noes wat time I'm gonna wake up.... H33!  In the end, reached Orchard @ 3pm. Went for a super, duper late lunch wif Ken @ my fav eatin' hse in Far Est b4 proceedin' to the Mac juz outside Shaw Centre for sum drinks. Had sum casual tok... sum not so casual though... regardin' relationships, graduation, job-huntin' etc. Hmmm... It seems like a long time since we last sat down to haf a nice chat... in fact, I could hardly recall any experience. lolX! In any case, glad tt at least I've found one miserably pathetic bastard whom I feel realli comfortable wif in NUS. Wish I had one in S.A. as well... but too bad... lost touch alr. *HaiX*  Left the place @ 5.30pm, then I acc  him to take a train to Somerset. (Yah, can call mi nua kia if u want... Hehe!) He was on his way to mit Jolin while I was mitin' Michael. Sumtimes realli, realli feel tt Ken deserves alot better treatment for the amount of commitment he has put into the relationship (n coz I noe he will be readin' my blog... HahahaX!). But, dun tink I shall comment much 'coz I dunno much abt. the details... moreover, I'm juz a by-stander, dun wanna get involved sia. I juz haf to get myself ready for the worst-case scenerio. Choy!!! Touch wood!! Touch wood!!   Followin' tt, went to Wet n Whistle for sum beer wif Michael. Muz comment tt the beer served is realli "gignormous"... tink abt the size of 3-4 regular beer glasses bahz... no dua Kang wor. Dunno y the waitresses there beri friendly... perhaps overly friendly towardz us. Felt pretty uncomfortable then. But on the other hand, shld feel honoured tt 2 of them were actualli payin' more attention to us... Keke! One of them even pinched mi on my cheek... *YuCkZ!!* tryin' to take liberty of mi... nv die b4... aRgHHhh! But guess they were juz doin' wat they ought to do bahz... retain customers... add to their satisfaction... make them come again another day. So I better not read too much into it. H33!! Anyway, they passed a similar remark tt I resemble JJ Lin JunJie... *aHeM* Lookin' like aH SiN from Mayday is bad enulf alr, now JJ??? Wat the heck were they tinkin'? Sumtimes dun understand these adolescenes man!!   Yah yah!! I haf a beri deep impression of one of the customers there sia!! Was totally captivated by her voice... more so for her personality!! She's got such a GREAT voice!! Mabbe can join Singapore Idol n easily emerge victorious man! I'm SERIOUS! Can't differentiate the original song from her singin' sia!! She's tt gd!! I was so attracted to her tt I completely ignored the card games tt I was hafin, includin' the waitresses... H33! Well, she's not exactly a beauty. In fact she's a distant from becomin' one, but her bubbly nature held mi breathless. To the beri least, she dared to express herself... unlike moz pple who wear a mask everywhere they go. She was not afraid to flare her talents wif all her rowdiness & craziness. To mi, she's not makin' a fool of herself, instead she was the centre of attraction. Could sense tt everytime she picked up the mic, all eyes were focused on her, esp. when she sang the opera part for "One night in Beijing". I idolize her so much!! Hope can get to c her again!! *EviL gRiN* H33!  On my way home, saw a group of TPJCianz in the same cabin. From the way they dressed, tink they juz haf had their prom nite or ECA gatherin' bahz. One of the gers shedded a few tears on the train sia. So dramatic. Realli can't imagine myself gettin' so sentimental when I left S.A. Come to tink of it, sorta miss the time I had in JC. Too bad, I din haf a sense of belongin' there, so din acquire any "genuine" frenz (or vice versa). *HaiX* So sad... Guess Junior College is juz a passin' phrase of my life, wif nth realli close to my heart (wif the ‘xception of Yen, mabbe?). It's kinda depressin', I noe.   "Self-esteem must be earned! When you dare to dream, dare to follow that dream, dare to suffer through the pain, sacrifice, self-doubts, and friction from the world, you will genuinely impress yourself."

       JoB-HuNtiN'   Woke up early this mornin' to apply for jobs @ the agencies in International Pacific. Now realli feelin' quite lethargic from all the walkin'... sleepy too.. *YaWnZ* Was supposed to mit Jean (The recruitment consultant of Supurous) @ 10am, so I went juz abit earlier juz in case I can't find her office. As expected, Ken turned up late. *SiGhZ* shld haf known tt tt was juz an agency, not potential employer, so no nid to be so concious of punctuality. *HaiX* Esp. when I knew Ken would be late... as usual. Keke!  Anyway, after tt agency, we went to several others as well, together wif Yanling & Simin. However, most of them required us to make an appointment or send our resumes to them. Obviously there were exceptions. A few consultants were more willin' to spare sum time sharin' sum of the job opportunities wif us . E.g. I thot tt Eryn (Nice name huh?) was quite helpful & approachable =) . btw, she lookz quite sweet as well, tt's y I was completely focused on wat she was tokin'... H33! Then the other 2 consultants from Adecco were pretty friendly too. But one thing I dun understand is y they started gigglin' the moment I toked abt. my career objective durin' the interview. They told mi it's their personal joke durin' lunch-time but still, dun haf to laugh thru'out the interview rite =(? Made mi look like a clown ('Xcept for the bit tt I dunno how to juggle ballz) ... *HaiX* Luckily, the prettier of the 2 (in fact, I was quite attracted by her... *BLuSh*) passed a flatterin' comment tt I'm a pleasant lookin' young man... otherwise.... otherwise... erhmmm... tink there's nth I can do either.. H33!! In all, went to approximately 10 agencies bahz, but like wat I mentioned, not everyone of them were keen on entertainin' us. Can't blame them either. So many fresh gradz recently... worse thing is we dun even know wat we r lookin' for... even lagi jia lat is, we r so damned picky!! Nevertheless, I feel tt the position of processin' officer in Citibank is a gd offer. Too bad it's in Tampines, otherwise, I would haf given it a shot. Currently I'm still considerin', @ the same time keepin' my options open. Hopefulli can get a suitable job soon. Prayin' hard.  Aiyah, now also quite troubled, 'coz my interview skills sux big time. I was even dumbfounded by sum of the questions posed durin' the interview... n I know tt they were the common yet tricky questions tt require sum "preparations" Anticipated these qns alr, but answerin' them is a totalli different story. e.g. "Wat do u c urself in 5 yrs' time?" DuhZ! I would haf given a one-word ans "RICH!!" or "Charmin'" if I wanna try to be farnie. But an interview is an interview. Being humorous doesn't gimmi the advantage over the rest. Neither does actin' cute... *BwaHaHaHaX* Tink realli nid to spend sum time evaluatin' myself. No employer would want to employ sumone who's not even sure abt his own strengths & weaknesses. tt I'm sure.  Went makan @ Amoy market after the job-hunt. Initialli was plannin' to stay out till evenin', but Dad called to inform mi tt sis not feelin' well n she's alone @ home. Therefore, being a totally carin' Bro (Sibei buay pai seh!! lolX!), I went straight home. Upon arrival, realized tt Dad came home alr. Guess his fatherly love also beri "powerful".... BwahahahaX! Fortunately, Sis alr feelin' better, otherwise, I wouldn't forgive myself for leavin' her alone @ home. *PheW*  Hmmm... tink I oso nid  change my image. Main thing is my hairstyle. I haf absolutely no idea how to style an executive look. Then my hairstylist specializes in onli funky designz juz like wat mine is... so dunno whether if I shld still patronize him for my next hair-cut. Forget it bahz, tink juz go n cut a typical crew-cut will do. @ the worst, onli kena condemned by Ken Lee nia... HahahaX!! It's not as if it's the 1st time... Keke!

       GeTTiN' FiT SooN?   Hey! I'm finalli back to my execrise regime tt I haf originalli planned to carry out in March. *SiGhZ* Looks tt I haf exceeded the start date by a great deal, but late is alwayz better than never, isn't it? Now wif less than 1 mth left to prepare for my IPPT, I'm hafin' doubts tt I will strike gold. tt's y my target has been reduced to silver instead. Used to haf no difficulty achievin' silver standard one, but *HaiX*... Look wat alcohol & tobacco haf done to a has-been IPPT gold reciepent. Those were the gd old dayz... *HaiX*  Then now my greatest worry is tt I won't be able to clear sit-up. YES!! SIT-UP!!!! Can't imagine rite? Indeed, a few yrs back, I couldn't visionize anyone not scorin' a perfect 5 for sit-up as well, but this perception changed when I took my previous IPPT. I did onli 38!! N the humiliatin' thing was, I attempted to complete the last 2 usin' my hands to reach for my knees!!! *PoUt* Despise myself to the max!! tt was then tt I realized tt "5" is not a so-called "default score" for sit-up. So far, I hafn't been able to do 40 sit-ups in one go even wifout time constraint. Tink I'm gonna had hella a hard time tonin' up my abs again. Miss my 6-pack man... Now they r so united tt they wouldn't bear to stay apart. Whoever sayz tt united we stand... hmmm.. definitely doesn't apply here. H33! Anyway, can't do too many crunches 'coz my abs' still feelin' the strain from the pathetic 40 sit-ups I did last nite. Sibei weak lehz...  The rest of the itemz, I tink I shld haf no problem achievin' the required standards for silver bahz. Chin-up, I can do 9 now, as compared to 6 last week. It's amazin' how my body conditions itself... to my delight! 'coz it seems like my fitness can be quite easily regained after onli a few trainin' sessions! Now, tt's gd news! Even for the runnin' part, last week was like a suicidal act to complete 2.4km, however, now it's pretty much a piece of cake. Keke! Damned hao lian. Of coz I'm discountin' the fact tt I din time myself. Nevertheless, tink I shld haf the endurance to clock below 11 bahz... tt's juz a rough estimation. Can't time myself 'coz I dun haf a digital watch wif stop-clock function now n I haf no intention of buyin' one... H33!   Juz now kena disturbed by a sms from Yanling in the middle of my sleep. Asked mi if I wanna join them to apply for job @ an agency. Not tt I'm not free lahz. But I was sleepin', dun feel like wakin' up then. Moreover, I'm totalli unprepared. Dun wanna give the impression tt I'm there juz to try my luck. Appreciate her invitation though. =) After replyin' the sms, sleepy-head ah WiNg went back to sleep again. H33! But, I was disturbed by a phone call not long after. This time round, it's James. Asked mi if I wanna work in Taka this comin' weekend. *HaiX* I dun feel like workin' @ all, but I'm bad @ rejectin' pple tactfulli, esp. James 'coz he's helped mi alot in the past. Now still delayin' my response & hopefulli, I can find an ingenious excuse soon.   All JX's fault lahz, wanted mi to ask James if got part-time job for him anot, in the end, James knew tt I'm available for work now, so asked mi work. *SiGhZ* tt's one of the major factors why I hestitated callin' James when JX approached mi. *BiGGeR SiGhZ* =S  It's wednesday lehz... feel like gg Zouk, or Dbl-O oso can 'coz it's free entry 2nite. Long time nv go mambo alr... so feel quite tempted. Once again, the problem lies in 2 factors: Kakis & money. If go Zouk, tink can onli ask Kenneth.. the rest of the world tink either hafin' exam or not keen. Then the thing abt Kenneth is he's too "task-orientated" & he prefers Phuture, so nvm. On the other hand, even Kenneth wouldn't wanna go Dbl-O, who else would be interested? So, tt's out as well. Even got kakis, I'm oso lackin' in financial resources to thoroughly enjoy myself. Mite as well adjourn till a later date... Oh well... =I   "Most people have no idea of the giant capacity we can immediately command when we focus all of our resources on mastering a single area of our lives."

       DaMn tHe WeaTheR !@~#@$%   It's damned bloody hot these few dayz... cannot tahan the heat @ all!! Watever is wrong wif the song tt goes "It's gettin' how in here, so take away ur clothes". Wat a load of craps!??! Can surely feel the globe warmin' up, but hafn't seen any babe takin' their clothes off yet... aRgHHH! Suddenly everytin' starts to get on nerves all thanx to the idiotic weather. *PoUt PoUt PoUt* Dun even feel like steppin' out of my condusive, luxurious, & most importantly AIR-CONDITIONED room for fear tt I may end up dehydrated once I exceeded the boundary of my own nursery. *HaiX* In case u tink I'm exaggeratin'... well, I am... to a great extent... Keke! But the heat is realli unbearable!! I believe 8 yrs ago @ ard this time of the yr, the weather wasn't as bad as it is now.. Damn urbanisation, globalisation, pollution, evolution... aiyah... watever "~tions" tt caused all these lahz!! aRgHhhh!!! I'm gg bersek alr!!! Sibei pissed off ah!!!  Juz now send Ken K off to the airport i oso beri pissed off by the heat. tt aside, I tink inside the airport itself was pretty okay... 'coz it fully air-con!! H33! Xikai picked mi up @ Clementi, then went Bizad to pick VoNNy, followed by Ken K @ PGP. the latter was late (Supposed to mit @ 1030am, but he turned up @ ard 1050am?), so we had to wait @ the drive-thru' near the foyer. Then one Indian female sercurity personnel "kindly reminded" us to wait elsewhere 'coz the car was obstructin' the "heavy traffic" which consisted of onli (Look... it's ONLI!!!) the NUS shuttle buses which arrived @ 6min interval. Well, not much of a choice, we had to drive to the basement carpark then back again. However, Ken K was still takin' his own sweet time (probably... keke), so we were "advised" by the Indian again. Gosh, We muz haf repeated the cycle 2-3 times b4 Ken K finalli showed up.  Sumhow, if onli we could stop these Indians by pressin' the red button... BwahahahaX! I'm such a racist!! Keke!!  Xikai is realli one beri worthy pal wor... went to fetch Ken (Lee) as well. No wonder, he's one of my most bestest kakis in Bizad!! ^^ Anyway, we reached the airport, helped Ken K carried all his barang barang (My!! They were so heavy man!), waited for him to check in, then went to BK for lunch. It was then tt I knew tt Taiwan is onli Ken K's 1st stop. Next, he would be gg to China (tink Guangzhou bahz), Japan, n finalli balek Kampong to US!! So envious of him, can go to so many places for tour... Well, sumtimes u juz can't compare urself wif others, lest u find urself realli pathetically mediocre. Instead, alwayz look on the bright side of life... n Ronaldo starts whistlin' (the Nike advertisement, rem??)... HahahaX!! I alr accepted the fate long ago... H33! But in life, u gain sum, u lose sum... the world may not be fair; but at least it'z alwayz maintainin' its equilibrium... juz like Adam Smith's "invisible hand"... H33!!!! n tink I will remember wat I mean in sayin' this :)  Now tt I'm back @ home again, tink I will keep to my rottin' schedule... Kekeke! Rottin' a little a day, keepz the doctor away... it will invite the sai gong instead!! Hehehehe!! Pai seh... Not farnie @ all... Lookz like i haf set the crows restless again!!! BwahahahaX!

       tHe MoSt ...    Suddenly got this impulse to record down the most significant incidents in every phrase of my life, from kindergarten (if I can still recall... which I doubt) till now. So here I am, tryin' franticalli to fill in to the best of my ability. Hope it won't turn out too borin'... HahahaX!   Kindergarten (Hope I got the spellin' rite, 'coz it's been almost 2 decades since I last attended.. Keke!)    Most memorable:  Muz haf been the time when we went on an excursion to the Singapore Zoological Garden. Then in the midst of the animal show, Johnny (I tink, wifout much confidence.. H33!) tripped & fell down a flight of stairs. Luckily he din sustain any serious injury except for a bad shock... n the rest of us mocked @ his acrobatic feat... so mean!! BwahahahaX!   Sweetest moment:  Can't tink of any... dun wanna damage all my brain cells for tinkin' too much. Keke!    Most bitter:  Probably the time when I couldn't finish my drawin' before the art lesson ended. (Dun be surprised!! I attended art classes when I was young!!) I cried so bitterly tt the art teacher promised to gimmi 3 stars juz to pacify mi. Of coz, i shut myself up lahz... 3 stars lehz!! HahahaX! Anyway, it was a potrait of cats, if my memory serves mi rite.   Primary skol    Most memorable:  Going to a junior class to get to know one of the gers call HuiNi. I alwayz ask JiaRui (Who was my best friend then) along 'coz I was too shy! H33! The relationship did not blossom for obvious reasons. But could realli c tt she liked mi alot!! Kekeke! ('coz I can say watever I want now!! H33!)   Sweetest moment:  There was this pair of sisters & the younger one was from my class. Well, I used to like her, n my brother liked the elder sister (juz my own deductions.. H33!) So the 4 of us used to play in the playground juz below where I used to lived. tt was so sweet!! Anyway, I haf alr lost contact wif them... n the playground is no longer in existence. Realli hope to c them again, after such a long time... H33! Yah... the elder one is call Weijun while my "beau" is call Weijia. ;)   Most bitter:  If realli haf to squeeze sumtin out, i guess.... erhmm... tink should be the day we received our PSLE results bahz. 'Coz was quite sentimental towardz my mother skol n we were leavin' skol soon.. *SoB* Realli hated to part wif my ex-classmates esp. Jialong, Zikai, Yingyan, Yinghao...  but, managed to get over it pretty soon... *Oops!!* lolX!   Secondary skol    Most memorable:  The most memorable phrase of my life wif lotsa thingz tt i can't seem to forget no matter how hard I try despite my poor memory... HahahaX! If onli can choose one incident... Mabbe it's winnin' the SPH 4 X 800m relay. 'Coz the rest of our relay teamz were completely wiped out n there was intense pressure for my team to win. Can say tt it was one of the most emotional competition of my life, involvin' both tears & perspiration. Could nv forget the exhilaration upon winnin' the race... n I meant 1st runner-up... H33! Thanx KB, guang & LingChe!! *MuaCk!!*   Sweetest moment:  The nite when I gave my precious 1st kiss away! H33! It was on the 30th May 1996 (aH WiNg'S b'DaY!!), along the causeway linkin' the then World Trade Centre & Sentosa, facin' the sea. All was calm & serene... the ambience was rite... I could feel the gentle sea breeze caressin' my face... then I fell into a moment of sweetness. Could never forget the kiss... not ever in my life.   Most bitter:  The day when we received our 'O' Levels results. Not 'Coz of gg on separate paths (We knew tt we would be palz 4ever then... WoaH!!), but 'coz of results. Mine's still ok, but KB & TY failed their English. Esp. for TY, he broke down in tears... & I fcuked a junior off for being overly inquisitive. I could realli feel their disappointment n I was in a foul mood as well. In the end, the 3 of us (can't remember if Kenneth was ard) went to Pandan reservoir (our fav haunt when we're depressed) to vent our frustration. Sad day. =(    Junior College    Most memorable:  Most memorable times are the times spent wif my "Xian Ren Zhang" clique, namely, Jiajia, Jiayuan & Vicky. Not tt I'm a buaya, but was on better terms wif them mahz. Anyway, dun tink we can be as good as we were now. So depressin'. *HaiX*   Sweetest moment:  Dun tink I haf any... Mabbe the amount of affection Miss Yeo showered mi durin' her Maths tutorial?? *YuCKs!!* =S   Most bitter:  I broke up wif my gerfriend of 11 months. Was terribly upset then n there was this period of time when I brought a teddy bear tt she gave mi to skol everyday (for companionship *SoB*). I was deeply traumatized by the incident n took 3 long yrs to get over the "phobia" of relationship. Did lotsa stupid thingz like waited outside her house for 2 full nites... witnessin' the construction of a road, from start till completion while waitin' for her... H33! But she nv did come out to mit mi... n tt was realli the end of this relationship. *WeeP WeeP* But hey!! We r still beri gd frenz now! Thank God!    Army    Most memorable:  Suffered from foot rot & was given att 'C' for 7 dayz!! Durin' tt period of time, there was an angel constantly by my side, takin' real gd care of mi!! She's such a carin' angel!! No wonder I was in love wif her!   Sweetest moment:  Definitely has to be this angel who bought mi a Braun Buffel wallet (which I lost less than a yr later... Keke!) on 09.09.1999. She was realli damned thotful & I was guilty to the extreme for not buyin' her anytin on this once-in-a-lifetime day. 'coz tt day signified 常常久久. *HaiX* No wonder our relationship was so short-lived... *Keke* Anyway, realli appreciate wat she's done for mi... *MuaCk MuaCk* ^-^   Most bitter:  Wat could be more bitter than losin' an angel? Dun haf to elaborate any further rite?   Uni Life    Most memorable:  I spent the most memorable part of my uni life in LT18 wif another angel whom I juz adored so much! We were both preparin' for examination n would mit up everyday in LT18 to study. It was also there tt she accepted my love for her... though not as romatically as I've originalli planned... all thanx to WK (Dun bother to find out who... H33!) She was a priceless gem in my heart then... n I could realli feel myself engulfed by intense love. So 幸福 then!!   Sweetest moment:  I was hafin' a realli bad cough n she was there by my side thru'out the nite, rubbin' my chest in order for mi to feel better . I was touched. Come to tink of it, she's realli one of the sweetest ger in my life, but too bad... Keke!    Most bitter:  I betrayed friendship for an undesired love. I was a bastard n I would nv forgive myself for tt. Wat's done cannot be undone. Hopefulli time will heal all woundz.  Well, tt's abt all! Dun look as if I haf a fulfillin' life, does it? lolX! Anyway, interestin' or not, u'll be the judge. I'm juz bein' too eng n decided to do sumtin more meaningful... GeeZ!! n i call this meaningful... Keke!! Anyway, up till this stage, I'm pretty much contented wif my life! Juz hope tt my future would be juz as optimistic or even better!! ^-^   "Look at a day when you are supremely satisfied at the end. It's not a day when you lounge around doing nothing; it's when you've had everything to do, and you've done it."

       oRcHaRd oRcHaRd oRcHaRd   Hey! Juz came back from Orchard onli. Been out the whole evenin' jalan jalan @ Orchard. Tink I muz haf covered the whole of the area... Started from Taka.... then Centrept... Far East... then PS!!! WaoH!! Can't believe we managed to "conquer" Orchard all in half a day's work... H33! Anyway, I met up wif Michael 1st @ Taka... Initially was tinkin of treatin myself to sum gd food 1st, but he suggested waitin' for Jenny... so no food for poor starvin' Mr. WiNg... *HaiX* Ke Lian ar!!! Then as usual, went to Taka tried findin' Jasling, but she's on off 2day... so hung ard there for a while, then made our way to our Cineleisure. Din know tt Michael is realli one Transformer fanatic!! He couldn't keep his eyes off the toys displayed in one of the toy shop in Cineleisure... H33!! Got to c the kiddish side of him!! Keke! Anyway, I managed to get hold to one catalogue and he was like analysizin' ALL the different models!! Amazin' man! Now, tt's definitely one of those traits tt I least expect from him... H33!  Followin' tt, we crossed over to Centrept. Can't seem to give tt place a miss once we're in town... HahahaX! As usual lahz... tok tok for a while then left the place... this time wif Jenny. Then once again, Mr. WiNg came up wif a brilliant idea... go Far East makan. So off we went ALL THE WAY to Far East ON FOOT!!! *HaiX* This muz haf been my longest journey on foot in Orchard... But at least, we finalli got to sit down to enjoy sum realli gd food!! ^^ Went to the usual eatin' house on the 4th floor (I tink) for sum HK cuisine. It was spendid!!~! Even when I'm not starvin' as I was then, I've alwayz found the food there todemo oishi desune!! One of my fav. eatin' places of all time!!  Had turkish ice-cream for dessert... n once again Mr. WiNg proposed sumtin beri interetin'... go arcade play photohunt. -.-"' It so happened tt there's no arcade centre available in the vicinity, so we had to travel all the way to Plaza Singapura. Well, it's not tt there's no arcade nearer than PS, but Michael strongly recommended there... Oh well, he's the boss anyway... Keke! Yah... almoz forgot... met Doreen in Far East (Peishi's younger sis). n surprise, surprise... she could still recognise mi!!! HahahaX! Tink she muz haf a beri gd impression of mi, if not, she wouldn't haf bothered to remember mi... BWahahahaX! 小翼賣瓜，自賣自誇！Sumhow, I thot tt she's grown taller... tink ard 174cm bahz... realli damned tall for a gal... but I realli like her height! Hopefulli, my next would be sumhow ard tt range.. H33!  After sum painstalkin' walkin', finalli reached PS... played a few roundz of Photohunt, n completed one of them... Yipee! But unfortunately, we din even make it to the top 5 scorers... so it was not such a big deal afterall.. Keke! Anyway, Jenny left earlier 'coz she has had an appt wif sum xiao didi ard my age... so left onli Michael & mi to "fetch" for ourselves. Settled down @ Starbucks for sum kopi... n of coz sum decent toks... mostly abt life in general, love, attitude.... well.... can't realli recall wat we tok... (n this shows how serious my short-term memory is... H33!) But of 'coz I still remember sum of the crucial thingz we discussed lahz. To summarise, the moral of the whole conversation is "As pple grow, problems grow too. The best way out is to get in; not to get out, 'coz they may juz snowball n the consequence would be devastatin'" Soundz not beri enlightenin', does it? HahahaX! I juz came up wif this crap... can juz ignore this piece of thrash. H33!    "When you plant lettuce, if it does not grow well, you don't blame the lettuce. You look for reasons it is not doing well. It may need fertilizer, or more water, or less sun. You never blame the lettuce. Yet if we have problems with our friends or family, we blame the other person. But if we know how to take care of them, they will grow well, like the lettuce. Blaming has no positive effect at all, nor does trying to persuade using reason and arguments.  That is my experience. No blame, no reasoning, no argument, just understanding."

       CaeSaR's   Was intendin' to stay home the whole of ytd but was "dragged" down to Caesar's by Michael & Ezen. *HaiX* Anyway, I wasn't realli coerced into gg. Juz tt I promised Michael to go out once our examz r over.... n there isn't gg to haf many chances 'coz he has to start work from 2mr onwardz. Had a couple of drinkz and we left @ ard 2am.  Now tt examz r over, I realli haf no idea wat to do. Enjoyment 1st perhaps? But it seemz tt I'm the onli one who finished this dreadful exam this early. Kenneth & RQ still havin' exam. *HaiX* Wanna watch movie oso dunno jio who... Been wantin' to watch "Into the Mirror" for quite sum time alr. Knew tt Kenneth's not into Korean horror anyway. In fact, no one I know likes Korean horrors... *SiGhZ*  Later gg down town to meet up wif Michael. Tink I'm gg to haf a sumptuous meal @ Far East.... 'Coz I hafn't had lunch yet... so poor thing.. Now realli feelin' 'xtremely hungry!!    "God, grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change, the courage to change the things I can, and the wisdom to know the difference."

       eXaMz?? WaT tHe HeCk??!?   Finalli overcame the last hurdle of my education life!! Yipee!! So glad tt I survived thru' all these yrs skivin' thru' this torturous education system!! *PheW* Realli admire myself for such a feat!! H33! Anyway, now tt it's over, gonna take a short break... b4 I slog again... HahahaX! Tink will spend sum time workin' on my resolutions for the future, such as jobs, interests, lifestyle, image etc etc etc.... soundz like alot of work.... *HaiX* Aiyah, it's a matter of time I haf to face it.... juz tt i decided on the embarkment later the the average Bizaders, tt'z all.... *BiG SiGhZ*  Well, after the last irritatin' paper, we went Holland Village for a feast! tt included both Ken's, Xikai n Vonny! Had quite a sumptuous meal @ Thai 'Xpress... to summarise, it was a total relief!~!~!! ^_^ From all the assumingly "hard work" tt we haf put in over the semester. Din know tt it would be so relaxin' to put aside all worries & juz enjoy the company of peers. This is especially so when moz of the time when 5 of us met, it's alwayz abt. work.... *YaWnZ* Finalli got the chance to discuss abt. sumthin' else other than the ever sickenin' R&I... Shitty SIA... *ULtRa BiG PoUt!!!* Yah... we proceeded to Wala Wala after our meal for a couple of drinkz. Took sum photoz there which I tink I'm gg to upload to my "Yahoo photo album". H33!! So excited 'coz seldom take photo wif they all. Tink I muz haf been "cravin'" for a photo-takin' session for a long time alr. Keke!   Had sum beer, mainly Kilkenny & Hoegarten... Gosh!! They taste GREAT! Fantabulous I muz say!!!  Muz haf been losin' touch wif overseas brewery for a long time!! It's alwayz Tiger or Calsberg... Now finalli sumthin' different!! The live-band was excellent as well!! Tink it's the kinda of feelin' &  the company tt blended in so well to the atmosphere tt made mi so at ease. It wasn't the moz enjoyable party I haf (In fact, it's not even considered a party), but it was definitely one of the moz enjoyable! Mabbe they dun feel the same way, but at least I do... 'coz I know chances like tt would be frequent... or even ocassional in future... *HaiX* If onli....  Eventualli, we went on our separate paths pretty early. No choice, Vonny wanted to leave earlier... n Ken was gg to join his friendz @ ChiJimes. Could realli see tt Ken couldn't bear to part wif us... He's gg to Taiwan on 20th.... followin' tt, he would be returnin' to the States. So sad. T.T He has been such a worthy pal... whether it's project or social life. Pple say unlike poles attract; I tink otherwise. 'Coz the 2 of us haf a common interest in drinkin'!!! H33!! n moz of the time, tt was our common topic too!! Partyin', clubbin', drinkin'!! Hopefulli, we'll haf a chance to meet up for more booze b4 he leaves... Keke!  Btw, comment by Vonny: I'm beri 自恋. I rebutted in sayin' tt's nth wrong wif lovin' oneself more than others. Erhmmm.... I guess she's rite. I realli love myself more than anyone else in this "compassionate" world. Mabbe 'coz I  dun wanna see myself hurt? Or perhaps, I juz wanna be in my best in order to please the world. Probably, both. In any case, tt's the way i am... dun expect mi to change... unless one fine day there's sumone who loves mi more than I do... then perhaps I will change my perception. Hmm... Juz my own imagination...   "You will recognize your own path when you come upon it, because you will suddenly have all the energy and imagination you will ever need."

       JaP PaPeR - iT's hiStoRy!!!   *PheW* @ long last... the "horrendous" paper is finalli history!!  Din spend too much time on the revision , but tink it would turn out the same anyway... H33! The killer part was the listenin' comprehension. It was realli zen zen wakarimasen!! No joke abt. it. Nevertheless, tink I'm not alone, 'coz I was on the look-out for potential "prey" but realized tt nobody was actualli confident of the answers! Keke! Wat agitated mi was tt in the midst of the examination, I had a stomach upset!! Of all time... shit! All pun intended. HahahaX! Had every intention to go to the toilet @ tt pt. in time, but scared couldn't finish the paper, so tahan lohz. In the end, finished the paper alr, but we were not allowed to leave the examination hall 15min b4 the end of the exam!! Wah kaoz... beri frustratin' one lehz!! Then the pain got worse and I had to constantly control my ass in order to prevent myself from fartin'. *HaiX* Irritatin'!~! Couldn't wait for the exam to end. Lack of concentration to check my answers too... *aRgHHhh!!* Upon announcement of the end of the exam, I was among the 1st to leave the LT... of 'coz headed for the toilet 1st lahz!!   @ the moment, everthing is pretty much cool. One down, one more to go. Afterwhich, ORD lohz!! Dun tink I will fare too badly for my Jap too. @ the beri worse, tink will get a 'C'; on the brighter side, predict tt the grade will also fluctuate ard tt range one... H33! I'm the weakest link remember?? Keke! Juz wanna haf a good nice rest now so tt I can cover abit of R&I 2nite. Otherwise, to complete everytin by 2mr is unimaginable, though possible. But wat the heck??!? Thursday shall be the nite!! Planned wif Xikai & Kenz to go party on Thu alr... lookin' 4wd to tt alr... lolX!  Btw, my favourite Xiaxue is alr otta the Singtel's bloggin' contest alr. So wasted... damn those pple who voted her out. Realli like her entries 'coz they were so real, so truthful, so forthcomin', so procrastinatin', so "Xiaxue"!! Keke! Idolize her attitude man!! Esp. like her blog on the top 15 pple she wanna fcuk... h33! Particularly the description on "Xiaoge" Fei Yuqing!! Quoted Xiaxue " If good sex could shut him up, I'll do the sacrifice." Woah!! Geez!! Did u see tt??!? So noble of her!! Anyway, key pt. is, can she give it to mi to shut mi up instead?? I'll be a good boy, I promise, I swear. RofL!! BaWaHaHaHaX!!! Xiaxue rulez!! Xiaxue reignz!! n Xiaxue is otta the contest!!! Fcuk the voters-out!! Her blog's so gd tt it's almost pron.. Keke!

       eXaM LoHz!! WaT tHe HeCk??!?   Oh my gosh!! 2mr will mark the start of my final sem examination n I hafn't started my revision @ all. Wat on earth haf I been doing all these dayz? Well, nth much... Mabbe too much T.V., too much online activities & too much fantasizes?? Probably, the most obvious thing is editin' the content of my friendster account!! Kekeke! Nth to be proud of anyway. H33! Uploaded sum photos & added sum effects to them. Looks beri nicely done!! A pity, I can't upload it here unless I pay!! (No way!!) Tink I'm too obssessed wif this internet thingy tt I haf the tendency to log on whenever I'm free or not free!! Eeekk!! I should do away wif this unproductive habit man!!  Initially, I had intentions to study last nite. but later decided to put aside my studies till this mornin'. As a result, I slept damned early @ 10plus. Woke up @ 8 plus this mornin' but made up my mind to go back to bed 'coz it's freakin' too early!! In the end, woke up @ 1.30pm... *SiGhZ* Now still hafn't get myself warmed up for my revision yet, but gettin' abit panicky alr... 'coz time is realli fadin' fast away... n I could sense my end drawin' closer & closer... aRgHHHhhh!!   U know, I've nv expected myself to be addicted to the internet... until recently. Discovered tt my eyes r virtualli glued to the monitored n my fingers practically stuck to the keyboard. Can't blame mi either. Too little outdoor activities make aH WiNg a dull boy... *HaiX* Moreover, got so many thingz to do online... e.g. Chattin', d/l movies, music etc., bloggin', readin' blogz, checkin' for job updates... too many to name all. No wonder I'm addicted to it... keke! But on a more serious note, tink it'z 'coz I haf no life bahz... otherwise, I wouldn't be livin' like a hermit... stayin' @ home all the time *sNiFF sNiFF*     "Sometimes when you think its the end, its really a new beginning"

       JuZ aNoTheR DaY... *SiGhZ*   It's juz another day. The past Friday wasn't realli good as it should be ('coz it's Good Friday). But any christians could haf told u tt Good Friday supposedly is a day when son of God, Jesus Christ, died on the cross for mankind. It's supposed to be a solem day. *HaiX* Wat am I tinkin? So selfish, keep tinkin' how unfortunate I am onli. tt's y i alr mentioned, n I will keep on remindin' tt I'm not a saint!! Suddenly, I seem so mediocre in front of the greatness of Christ... *HaiX once again*  Finalli finished my R&I project last nite. It has been a dreadful long nite. Din know wat to write @ all. Damned! Anyway, dun wanna dwell on it now since it's already past. *PheW* Juz feel a great deal of guilt towardz Vonny for my pathetic contribution, if any. H33!  Din do anytin worth mentionin' today (again). Sumtimes realli feel tt I nid a break in here!! DESPERATELY!!! Exams' gonna start in 3 days n I've done no revision @ all. Isn't tt frightenin'? Hahahax... to the extent of sendin' shivers down one's spine... lolX!! I tink I realli nid to get back to reality... can't alwayz remain in a dimension different from the norm. But who says the norms are alwayz correct? I tink otherwise! Mabbe 'coz I'm unique? Eccentric? Extraordinary? Exceptional? Or juz being plain lame?? Keke! Sumhow, most pple feel tt followin' the majority is the most rational thing to do. Erhmm... as for mi, I tink it may not be the most sane thing to do, but at least it will protect u from otherwise discriminations or scrutinizes. Agree? So if there's ever one day I can break free from this social barrier, I will practise wat I alwayz preach - Break the law, fcuk the norm!! RofL!!  Feelin' mildly depressed 2day 'coz I juz got to know sumtin I hate to know (n definitely hate to reveal it here!!) ... *HaiX* But life still goes on, doesn't it? Like wat Forrest Gump said, "Shit Happens" n it sure does; "all the time"... to add on. "Life is like a box of chocolates, u nv know wat u're gonna get". Yah... mine's pretty much like the expired one: Left on the shelf, wantin' to be disposed of. Such a miserable life... *HaiX* Could anyone send mi an angel? Or mabbe sumone did, but I rejected their offers. (Hmm.. Juz rem Shiney asked mi go church today, but I declined her kind gesture... so bad =s)     "Our deepest fear is not that we are inadequate. Our deepest fear is that we are powerful beyond measure. It is our light, not our darkness, that most frightens us. We ask ourselves, who am I to be brilliant, gorgeous, talented and fabulous? Actually, who are you not to be? You are a child of God. Your playing small does not serve the world. There is nothing enlightened about shrinking so that other people won't feel insecure about you. We were born to manifest the glory of God that is within us. It's not just in some of us; it's in everyone. And as we let our own light shine, we unconsciously give other people permission to do the same. As we are liberated from our own fear, our presence automatically liberates others."

       SpiN   Erhmmm... not the TV serial "Spin" but my head is spinnin' now. Slept too late last nite @ ard 5am in the mornin'. *Haix* Shouldn't haf watched the soccer match between Milan & Deportivo though it's realli excitin'. Got to wake up real early this mornin' for project discussion... *SiaNz* Anyhow, Milan suffered a humiliatin' defeat, 4-0, when they had the upper hand b4 the match by winnin' the first leg 4-1. Wat a pity. No thanx to their complacency which allowed their opponent to infilterate into their defence so beri often; Applause to the winnin' team which played 'xtremely well, almost dominatin' the entire match, grabbin' each & every scorin' opportunity. Well done!  Anyway, managed to DRAG myself to skol this mornin'. Makin' gd progress, tink can finish by 2mr (in fact, haf to finish by 2mr!!). Afterwhich, Xikai drove us to Harbour Front for lunch. Yanling tagged along as well 'coz she happened to be in skol & Vonny asked her along. Had our meal @ Yoshinoya then took a few snaps wif Ken K's & Xikai's HP. Well, a pity can't update them here, otherwise it would be real fun... keke! Subsequently, we went to the arcade centre. Din stay there long though 'coz they haf limited games. *BoRiN'* -.-"'  Now tt I'm back, feelin' damned sleepy n dizzy. Thot tt I could haf the fitness to go out later, but then dun tink so now. Tink I'm gg to bed straight after I'm done wif this entry... h33!! Wat a determined man rite? Anyway, RQ muz be cursin' mi under his breath now 'coz I actualli asked him to plan the prog for tonite... Kekeke! Sry lahz... Realli not feelin' beri well. Kenneth even more amazin', sms mi "home alone?", dunno wat he's tryin to express... Hahahahax!   Bed-time!!   "To be in time is to be asleep: to be awake is to be in eternity"

       MuGGiN'   Still muggin' for my R&I project. I'm now half-way thru' my part... but decided to give myself a break 'coz my mind is so freakin' saturated now!! Sumbody pls kill mi to end my misery!!! WAIT! I dun realli mean wat I say when I say "Kill", juz an expression to show how serious the situation is. The point now is, I know tt I haf had the easiest share of the pie, but all my arguements are so repetitive!! Oh gosh, dunno if I can finish by today (& I haf onli 43 min left for today; 40min after I finished this blog. *SiGhZ*)  Sumhow, I'm startin' to hate SIA (Yesh!! tt's our TOPIC!!!) But anyway, it's not sum personal grudges, juz tt I happen to be doing a risk analysis on it.... n it has to be my LAST PROJECT!!! If u get wat I mean. Thank you. Speakin' of which, juz discovered tt Lucia is oso a slave of SIA!!! She's now the inflight customer service executive and dun ask mi wat she does.... 'coz as usual, I dunno!! H33!! Tink tt's gg to be my catch phrase! Keke!  Recently no much events happenin' 'coz I alwayz coup myself up @ home. But managed to d/l a few movies and Jacky's variety. Hopefulli I can afford the time to watch them b4 the finals.. Heeheehee *eViL gRiN* n yah, KB juz flew over to Thailand earlier this afternoon. He's damned fierce man, took mc juz to go on a tour. Tink I'm gettin' more & more impressed + amazed by him. Nevertheless, dun tink tt's sufficient enulf to make him my role model... erhmmm.... I correct myself; He will NEVER become my role model... Bwahahaha!!   "One of the most tragic things I know about human nature is that all of us tend to put off living. We are all dreaming of some magical rose garden over the horizon-instead of enjoying the roses blooming outside our windows today."

       FuLFiLLiN' TueSDaY!!   It's been quite a fulfillin' day. Accompanied mum to SGH for routine medical check-up early in the mornin' (n I'm referrin' to wakin' up @ 7am!!). Nth serious abt. her condition, in fact, there's nth wrong wif her. As I mentioned, it's juz a  routine  thingy... sorta wayang wayang, go thru' motion process...  keke!  Then went back skol for project discussion. Wasn't realli productive, but at least we managed to make sum progress. At a critical time like this nearin' exams, who would bother to go the extra mile in contributin' to the success (or perhaps downfall?? lolX!) of this damned project? Not mi certainly!... Yah, mabbe Vonny, but tt's abt. it... h33!! Anyway, we will be mitin' on Thursday as well. Hopefulli this time round, we can wrap up the whole assignment. Stinky project... onli worth 20%. *PoUt*  Last nite I watched the last episode of West Side Story, in anticipation of a dramatic finale. The endin' wasn't too out-of-the-blue... sorta expected. However, the lesson learnt is ingeniously  thought-provokin'! Everyone has his own Buenos Aires. tt's the destination in life... n it holds the meanin' to existence. Where does my Buenos Aires lie? I haf absolutely no idea. *SiGhZ* Perhaps, my Buenos Aires doesn't even exist in the first place, tt explainz y i'm so clueless abt. my existence. Speakin' of which, I guess I still haf my own value of existence. Look at all the pple ard mi!!! Look at all the hearts I've touched!! Look at all the mess I've created!! Hahahax! Now u know y I'm here?? Kekeke!   "Spirituality means waking up. Most people, even though they don't know it, are asleep. They're born asleep, they live asleep, they marry in their sleep, they breed children in their sleep, they die in their sleep without ever waking up. They never understand the loveliness and the beauty of this thing that we call human existence."

       WHaT iS LoVe aLL aBoUt   Love can never be so beautiful without friendship, one leads to another and the process is irreversible, the best of lovers is the greatest of friends!  When you love someone, don't expect that person to love you back the same amount. One of you will be ahead, the other behind. It's either you catch up or the other waits.  Never be afraid to fall in love. It may hurt a lot, it may give you aches and pains, but if you don't follow your heart, in the end you will cry even more for not giving love a chance.  Love is not a feeling, it's a commitment. Feeling comes and goes.  Love doesn't have to have a happy ending, 'coz love doesn't have to end at all.  True love hears what is not spoken, and understands what is not explained, for love doesn't work in the mouth, nor the mind, but in the heart.  When you love, you must not expect anything in return, for if you do, you're not loving but investing. if you love, you must prepare to accept pain, for if you expect happiness, you're not loving but using.  It's better to lose your pride with someone you love rather than lose that someone you love with your useless pride.  "How can I say goodbye to someone I never had? why do tears fall for someone who was never mine? why is that I miss someone I was never with and I ask why I love someone who's love was never mine?"  It's hard for two people to love each other when they live in two different worlds but when these two worlds collide and become one, that's what you call magic!  Don't love a person like a flower, cause a flower dies in season. Love them like a river cause a river flows forever.   "Love may leave your heart like shattered glass, but keep in mind that there's someone who'll be willing to endure the pain of picking up the pieces so you could be whole again"

       SLaCk aS UsUaL   Haix... spendin' the whole of Sunday @ home again. I haf nth against it... realli. But if onli there's sumthing I can do which is not so energy-drainin', brain-crackin', nerve-rackin', vision-strainin'. Keke... onli arrive @ one conclusion -- SleeP!!! On 2nd thot, dun tink so. I would rather hang ard, wait for thingz to happen. Watever the "thing" might be... H33!  Din haf the mood to blog for the past few dayz, so here I m to fill myself in agin!! Hahax! Had my Japanese Oral on Thuday. Initially thot tt it's gonna be hella a torture, but all's well, ends well. Still not too bad, considerin' my past performaces (But i reckon tt it's not gonna be gd either!! H33!). Anyway, din do much preparation prior to the test, so any score is acceptable lahz, as well as i dun flunk. After the oral, went home, zoubo... can't rem doin' anytin constructive though. Hehe!  Friday, stayed @ home till evenin' time, then kena jio by KB to go out. I approached kenneth & RQ out of courtesy. Knew they wouldn't go... 'coz ... erhmm... can't explain concretely, but it's juz an instinct. *NaNaNiPuPu =p* Then I din wanna mit KB n June together 'coz I scared of communication prob sia. So I asked Junping along. At first, it was fine. We were @ One Fullerton (suggested by Mr. WiNg!! H33!) chillin' out @ Baker's Inn. Btw, i din know tt Gloria Jean has closed for Biz... but should haf seen it comin' 'coz the coffee realli sux big time... Kekeke! Yah.. back on track. We were sittin' in the BEST location in the whole of the cafe!! Exactly next to the sea where we can haf a panoramic, breath-takin' view of the sea!! All was so calm and serene. *Geeze* If onli we can do tt more often instead of clubbin'. Followin' tt, we went to Dbl-o (yayaya, again...) Dun wanna mention much abt the events there 'coz it's pretty much standard. In the end, Junping sent KB n June to OT & then mi back home. Feel sad for him 'coz went pub can't drink & still haf to drive us back... *haix* I appreciate tt though. =)  Watched Miss Singapore Universe last nite (nth spectaclar happened b4 tt... *yawnz*). I was captivated by No.7, Laura Tan!! No doubt she got into the final 5. A pity she wasn't crowned MSU... T.T She din even makit to the top 3!! Tink her Q&A muz haf been atrocious, otherwise, she could haf proceeded on to the throne, or 1st runner-up at the very least. Such a pity!! Had been expecting Joan Seah to win, but eventually Sandy Chua emerged victorious! Well,  couldn't say much. Beauty lies in the eye of the beholder. This time round, the panel of judges din seem to mit eye to eye wif mi. Hey, Haf to clarify sth... Nid to mention tt Sandy does look stunnin'... in fact, Sandy, Joan, Laura & Marilyn were the few potential ones who caught my eye. Esp. Sandy & Joan whom appear so confident & elegant in their evenin' gown. But, dun tink the former derserves the title though. Thot tt she wasn't the best in each segment alhough she was fairly consistent. Whereas for Laura, she was leadin' the pack durin' the parade segments but stumbled durin' the Q&A... ArGhhhh!! Wat a waste!!   Then Ken rang mi up, asked mi wanna go Caesars or Eigos drink anot. He was rejected flat. 'Coz I was too preoccupied by the on-gg paegent mahz. He called @ the wrong time.. keke! Anyway, Kenneth jio mi go town shortly after the show ended, so we went Orchard to haf supper. Met up wif KB... we proceeded on to Mdm Sultan. Went to Newsroom bar.. the rest self-explanary. Din realli enjoy... but nvm... nowadayz, clubbin' is not for enjoyment; it's more like a default activity of circumtances. Nth else to do, then club lohz... *sianz*...  Sleep, eat, slack, sleep........ slack....   "The only thing that you can be completely sure of is that you can't be completely sure of anything."

       当你   如果有一天，我回到从前，回到最原始的我，你是否会觉得我不错？  如果有一天，我离你遥远，不能再和你相约，你是否会发觉我已经说再见？   当你的眼睛眯着笑，当你喝可乐当你找。  我想对你好，你从来不知道。   想你想你，也能成为嗜好。  当你说今天的烦恼，当你说夜深你睡不着。  我想对你说，却害怕都说错。   还喜欢你，知不知道？    如果有一天，梦想都实现，回忆都成了永远，你是否还会记得今天？  如果有一天，我们都发觉，原来什么都可以，无论是否还会停留在这里？   也许可是让我想得太多。也许该回到没我。  梦里和相遇，就毫不犹豫，大声的说我要说。   当你的眼睛眯着笑，当你喝可乐当你找。  我想对你好，你从来不知道。   想你想你，也能成为嗜好。  啦～啦～  我想对你说，却害怕都说错。  还喜欢你，知不知道？   啦～啦～

       b'DaY: HaS-BeeN   Quite relunctant to write a blog for my b'day ytd coz to mi, it's juz another day. Hee!! Not blamin' anyone or anytin, but realli, wat's the big deal abt b'days?? I mean, everyday is sumone elses' b'day, so wat's so unique abt tt? Moreover, I haf at least 3 other frenz whose b'day falls on 30th May. So wat's all the fuss abt?? Anyhow, I'll juz blog for sake of bloggin'. Keke!!  On the eve of 30th, dined @ Ding Tai Feng in Paragon wif Kenneth, Kok Boon & Junping. Ruiqiang wasn't there 'coz he went to sum "Ji1 bu4" island wif Sisi & Co. So be it lahz!! Now I know who my true frenz are... Keke!! Anyway, subsequently, we went to PartyWorld Orchard for a ktv session. Initialli Junping & Kenneth suggested sumwhere sleazy... technicalli known as LSK (Lup Sup Karoake)... but I rejected the idea 'coz I've been there far too many times. Ooops!! Kiddin' onli... Chill chill!! So yah, managed to "pyscho" them to make do wif the decency of the lounge. Damn!! Regretted my decision... Hee!! We sang till dawn and settled down @ Mr. Bean for sum light supper. Had an enjoyable time catchin' up on good old dayz, esp when we were in Track.. Keke! Realli enjoyed tt bit. Gosh... if onli we could do tt more often instead of clubbin'. Hope Kenneth reads this. bWahahahaX!   Ken, Guoliang & Jolene "invited" mi out for a b'day supper on the day itself. Waoh!! tt was the 2nd time I went to chomp chomp and I was realli surprised by how much it's changed since the last time I came 5 yrs back!! The food was yummy too!! Had sum bbq chix wingz, stingray, fried Hokkien mee and cockles. Yah... realli thankful to Ken & Guoliang for initiatin' this outin'. Told them to postpone the meetin' till Xikai they all r free, but i suppose they were too eager to see mi. HahahaX!! Anyway, thanx dudes!! For spendin' the remainin' hours of my b'day wif mi!!!~! Frenz forever!!  Speakin' of frenz... I may haf rcv quite a few b'day wishin' but the person whom I wanted his wishin' so badly did not convey his wishin'. *HaiX* Not blamin' him... but juz damned disappointed. 11 yrs of friendship... yet... *SiGhZ*    Being 24 and still being financialli dependent is a fact I find it hard to accept. All these yrs of education, is it realli neccessary. I'm sure moz of u muz haf peers who haf not even completed their dilploma or degree but are currently earnin' big bucks. In constrast, I haf frenz who graduated a few yrs back but are sloggin' everyday juz to make ends meet. While society places a high emphasis on education, we should oso question the value of certification. Does it propel us further?? Faster??   There is onli this much a degree can do for us. Mabbe sum of us are comfortable wif a startin' pay of $1.8K as long as the prospect of the job is good. I'm definitely fine wif the amt. It's juz tt how do u define "prospect"? Earnin' $5k or even $8k per month 10 yrs down the road. Endin' up in a managerial level and receivin' peanut pay?? How would anyone be satisfied wif such so-called "acheivements"... n may I remind u tt we r in Singapore!!! Face it!! tt's the cruel truth!! Juz a reminder to those degree holders out there including myself tt hafin a paper certification can onli show tt we can study. It doesn't reflect our level of success in future!! So dun be too full of urself esp those "Honours" students!! Hee!!! It's no big deal!!!   "Many of life's failures are people who did not realize how close they were to success when they gave up."

       MaN vs WoMaN   I'm not a sexist in any way, but i do suspect my frenz r. So here u r, man vs woman once again!! However, come to read abt them, it surely makes a great deal of logic!!! Dun believe, then read on!!   1. NAMES   If Laurie, Linda, Elizabeth and Barbara go out for lunch, they will call each other Laurie, Linda, Elizabeth and Barbara.   If Mark, Chris, Eric and Tom go out, they will affectionately refer to each other as Fat Boy, Godzilla, Peanut-Head and Scrappy.   2. EATING OUT   When the bill arrives, Mark, Chris, Eric and Tom will each throw in $20, even though it's only for $32.50. None of them will have anything smaller and none will actually admit they want change back.   When the girls get their bill, out come the pocket calculators.   3. MONEY   A man will pay $2 for a $1 item he needs.   A woman will pay $1 for a $2 item that she doesn't need but it's on sale.   4. BATHROOMS   A man has five items in his bathroom: a toothbrush, shaving cream, razor, a bar of soap, and a towel from the Marriott.   The average number of items in the typical woman's bathroom is 337. A man would not be able to identify most of these items.   5. ARGUMENTS   A woman has the last word in any argument.   Anything a man says after that is the beginning of a new argument.   6. CATS   Women love cats.   Men say they love cats, but when women aren't looking, men kick cats.   7. FUTURE   A woman worries about the future until she gets a husband.   A man never worries about the future until he gets a wife.   8. SUCCESS   A successful man is one who makes more money than his wife can spend.   A successful woman is one who can find such a man.   9. MARRIAGE   A woman marries a man expecting he will change, but he doesn't.   A man marries a woman expecting that she won't change and she does.   10. DRESSING UP   A woman will dress up to go shopping, water the plants, empty the garbage, answer the phone, read a book, and get the mail.   A man will dress up for weddings and funerals   11 . NATURAL   Men wake up as good-looking as they went to bed.   Women somehow deteriorate during the night.   12. OFFSPRING   Ah, children. A woman knows all about her children. She knows about dentist appointments and romances, best friends, favorite foods, secret fears and hopes and dreams.   A man is vaguely aware of some short people living in the house.   13. THOUGHT FOR THE DAY   Any married man should forget his mistakes.   There's no use in two people remembering the same thing.   AND FINALLY...   A couple drove down a country road for several miles, not saying a word. An earlier discussion had led to an argument and neither of them wanted to concede their position. As they passed a barnyard of mules, jack asses, and pigs, the husband asked sarcastically, "Relatives of yours?"   "Yep," the wife replied, "in-laws."

       DaRL & Joo   Darl called mi early in the mornin' @ 7am to sing mi a song. Hee!! She's realli beri sweet... mabbe much too sweet for mi. Anyway, toked to her for roughly an hr or so... yah... overseas call real ex, so haf to hang up. *SaD* But at least I can hear her laughter, sense her happiness over the phonecall; unlike the cold msn... Keke!! She has brought so much sunshine into my life, but I am still not prepared to commit... seriously. We made a pact.. "No commitment, nth else matters." If love is commitment, I can onli say I dun love her hard enuff. Soundz depressin', doesn't it? Nature will run itz own course, no worries. Till then. Thingz may or may not work out, but one thing is for sure, she nids mi more than I nid her. So yah, will be by her side whenever I can spare the time.  Evenin' went for dinner wif Joo & Co. It was supposed to be a bday dinner for mi, How Kit & John. Dined @ this Hainanese resturant call Chin Chin Restuarant off Bras Basah Rd and had a realli nice meal there!!! Subsequently wondered ard tt area until it's time to bide farewell to one another. Not beri eventful rite?? lolX!! But realli appreciate them for celebratin' my bday wif mi EVERY SINGLE YEAR, though I dun even know when their bdayz fall... Hee!! So bad hor mi? In any case, thanx thanx thanx!!! Love u guyz!!!!

       BaSe CaMp   Hey!! Had the best of time when I was attendin' a BASE camp organised by my prospective employer, Peter's Tan's Organisation. Had initialli thot tt this would be like any other camp, puzzle solvin', team-buildin' activities, simulation assessments etc. Well, frankly we did sum of those, but the main factor that sets this apart from other camps is it actualli reinforcin' my belief, makin' mi actualise it and based on this belief, I'm able to self-empower. tt's the whole theme of the camp- Belief, Actualisation and Self- Empowerment.  Well, it was a totalli new experience! I might haf stumbled across bits & pieces of my values, belief and even dreams, but this camp has most definitely made a difference between "dreamin'" abt ur dreams and "realisin'" them. Now, I haf a clearer vision on where I'm headin' and why I'm headin' this way; instead of bangin' my way on whichever path tt appears first. Yah, pple may be skeptical abt this camp... I mean anyone could haf thot abt. these in their concious mind. But... it realli matters. 'Coz onli I was astounded by the effect of the camp, all the "freshies" were amazed by the twist to the camp.  Sum interestin' quotes worth mentionin':   "God, there are so many pple sufferin' in this world. Pls help them";  Now look at this:  "God, there are so many pple sufferin' in this world. Pls  send mi  to help them."  So u notice the difference? Instead of askin' God to help the needy, y not use ownself as instrument to help these pple. It makes a whole world of difference. If God were to ans to every prayer like the former, wouldn't he be damned busy?? The beri fundamental basis of this notion is that why not send the possible to do the impossible? But beri often in life, when u, & even mi, want to achieve sumtin in life, we do nothing abt it. We juz wait for thingz to happen. tt's why there's this word call "godsend"... Keke! We simply wait for thingz to happen!! For a fact, we know tt many thingz in life are not so-called "God-sends". There's onli this much he can provide for u; end of the day, it's still up to u to get the work done.  "Love is not a concept; it is an action"  Usualli, we tok abt the beauty of love wifout fulli committin' to it. tt's the fallacy of love. We spend too much time tinkin', ponderin', appreciatin' it, and seldom do we unconditionalli share this love wif our loved ones. Love is not a feelin'; it is a committment. Feelin' comes and goes. If u truely love sumone, make it known to them thru' actions. Start doin' so now, for 2mr may nv come. Live a life wifout regrets.   This is the beginnin' of a new day. I can haf this day to use as I will. I can waste it or grow in its light, and to be of svc to others. But wat I want to do wif this day is impt. I exchange a day of my life for it. When 2mr comes, 2day will be gone 4ever. I hope I will not regret the price I paid for it.      Indeed, 2day is a gift. tt's y it's call the present. The future depends on what we do in the present.  "If i can hold it in my heart, I can haf it in my hands"  How beri true!! Our desires prevent us from living in the present. There is nth fatalli wrong abt it... Realli. Juz tt desires will alwayz be desires unless u make the initiative to turn these into reality. It's onli then tt u can get wat u truely derseves.  Learnt realli a great deal durin' this short 2D/1N camp. All I can say is tt everyone shld join this camp!! Regardless u r considerin' gg into this industry!! Rather than callin' it "brain-washin'" or "psycho pple"  as most pple would put it, I would call it gettin' to know ur sub-concious mind. It is onli in this state of mind, call the beta state, tt u r able to utilise 80-85% of ur brain. Once released, everytin will become so vivid and clear to u. I know wat I want and I'm gg to maximise the time I haf to acheive them.   Like wat pple alwayz say "Slow and steady win the race." But does this hold true in reality. To a beri large extent, it does. But y choose to be a tortoise when u can be a rabbit who runs a consistent race?? In this light, "slow and steady, win the race??" Hee... wat do u tink?? I chose to be the rabbit... and I haf full confidence tt I will beat the tortoise to the game. Affirmative!!!  Considerin' and finalli decided to embark on this job required a series of mentalli torturous struggles. It wasn't easy at all. I'm a degree holder.. if I were to work in a bank and receive a fixed-pay, it would evetualli work out... erhmm... sumhow(?). Commission-based jobs, on the other hand, offer less income security. Sumtimes it may be high; others, low. But since it is recurrent in nature, there is less fear of fluctuations. FEAR is reduntantly False Alarm Appear Real. Once u r able to bridge this gap of fear between now and future, u will discover tt the so-called fear is unfounded. It's juz my belief... tt creates the distinction. When u believe, there will be miracle. I believe.   "Failures do not exist; Onli learners."

       JuZ mY 2 CeNtS WoRtH   Juz sum thots which haf been lingerin' in my mind for sum time. How come we alwayz say 2 cents worth instead of 1 cent, 10 cents or 20 cents?? Beri hard to find 2 cents nowadayz u know?? Hee!!! @@ ok, tt's beside the point. Juz wonderin' y when men are faced wif setbacks in life, be it love, career or relationship, we will resort to drinkin'. Isn't it better to tink thingz thru' in a clear mind, so tt u can c thingz better?? At least for mi, I know I dun fall into tt category. Not tt I'm not a man, but 'coz I've learnt along the way. It's no use cryin' over spilled milk; it would be better to clean up the mess & get urself another bottle instead. Agree?  Seein' Mingfa & Co. in their 18's, 19's, I'm sorta envious of thir youth. When u're young, u can afford to do anytin. Even if u commit any mistake, pple will excuse u for tt. Reason: U r still young. Moreover, they dun haf the worries tt we haf (though they will haf to face it sooner or later). Career is wat's most impt to mi now; ALL OTHER THINGZ r secondary. Sumhow, when u r approachin' mid-twenties (like mi!!! omg!!!), u would be panickly over ur bread & butter. Esp for guyz, we haf alr deferred our establishment for 2 yrs, all thanx to NS. Therefore, in this game of career, we can't afford to waste anymore time. Mabbe tt's the reason y pple sign on. NS no longer becomes their liability; it becomes their buildin' step up the social ladder. On the other spectrum, though envious, I'm pretty worried abt. these teenagers. Mabbe it's the change in society which makes them more protected, but there's a limit as to when these protection shields will expire. No cerificate = No future in Singapore. True so far? Definitely do not wish to c them in Robinson's sales floor workin' as a promoter in 5 yrs' time. n there's onli so much I can do to knock sum sense into them. Obviously not much.... Keke!  Pardon mi for bein' paranoid, but I can't help hafin' this feelin' tt my social circle is shrinkin'!!! Guess most pple r juz caught up wif their own work. Everyone is runnin' their own race.   Dunno if anyone else has this experience. U suddenly get depressed over no apparent reason and u feel like breakin' down n cry ur heart out. Well, I alwayz experience this. Mabbe juz feelin' realli empty... even when God occupies a thirdths of my heart. But each & every time, I hold back my tears. 'Coz I realize there is realli nth... & no one I can cry for. This makes mi even sadder... lolX! While bein' a "life-saver", the person tt I wanna save most is myself.   I'm a blessed man. But blessed man has his own worries. He will question the reasons why he is so blessed. He will haf doubts over his existence. He will wonder if he's gonna be blessed in future like he was in the past.

       iPPt   Disappointment!!! *tSk tSk* thot tt I could haf the chance to get gold in the IPPT juz now, but I wan't even close. I even resorted to cheatin' but atlas!! I still got a silver. Anyway haf to thank my buddy in sit-up for inflatin' my count. Hee! Otherwise, wat could haf appeared on the score sheet would be 20+ (probably) instead of 40!! Keke!! I overcame the rest of the obstacles wif ease. No pressure, no sweat... it was a piece of cake. n when I was tinkin' everytin was gg so smoothly for mi, my 2.4km run let mi down. *HaiX* CAn u imagine?? 11.05min!! Even a secondary skol ger could do better than mi. Damned demoralised, devastated and traumatised by this shitty result. arGhhHHhh!! tt muz haf been my worst timin' since sec one...  But at least I walked away wif $200. I guess I'm more fortunate than most pple. I haf the atheletic genes in mi, so I dun realli haf to train to get silver, not to mention juz a pass. Juz be contented wif my miserable "acheivement" bahz. Now I know wat to take note in my next IPPT. Haf sufficient trainin' for sit-ups (in case the next time round, there's no one to help mi... Hee!) and dun be complacent for 2.4km. Thot I could easily managed below 10.30min; I was proven wrong. So next time, it's better to train wif a stop-watch... so tt I won't overestimate my own ability... Keke!!

       JoB oPPoRtuNitY   Been tinkin hard & long whether to accept my destiny as a chartered financial consultant. The job title sure soundz glamourous, doesn't it? But a few months ago, I wasn't receptive to the idea at all. I was tinkin, wat the heck?? It's juz another insurance agent job... dun give a damn!!! In fact, I dun realli like those so-called persistent consultants who came buggin' @ mi to either take up a policy or join them. *HaiX* I tink this is wat pple call retribution? Hee! Anyway, the turnin' pt which made mi changed my perceptions was durin' the interview (I would call it discussion rather) wif Roland, Collin & Szer Khee. They made mi discovered tt pride is worthless if u r not even willin' to make tt small, little step to overcome ur fear. Yah, I'm a graduate, so?? Does tt make mi anymore superior than those who haf undergone a lower education level. To mi, it does. End of the day, it would be a total waste of time on education if I've chosen this route. It does not require u to possess a degree b4 u can become a financial consultant, does it?  Realli in a dilemma now. *SiGhZ* Actualli I've broken thru' my 1st hurdle. I'm willin' to put aside the pride in mi. I'm sure tt by doing so, my wing (Notice: not wingz... hee! 'Coz I'm aH WiNg, not aH WiNgZ mahz) could bring mi further & higher. I believe I could acheive much more if I'm able to let go of this "burden". Main issue now is, which agency? I was enlightened by Roland & Co. but then I juz wanna be sure. Definitely dun wanna end up in a NATO organisation. They've changed my perceptions to a great extent and I realli appreciate them for the amt of efforts and time they spent on mi. On the other hand, I hope to leave my options open to other agencies as well. I've had a not-so-good impression wif Peter Tan's Organisation but Meiqing kept singin' praises of it. Fact or fiction, I will find out on Friday. Now I haf more & more thingz to consider. While PTO is interested in makin' fast bucks & IN BULK (!!), Roland's vision of contributin' to society coincides wif my personal values. I've yet to find out abt PTO's culture... but to make a choice between money & values... aiyah... tough one there. On 2nd thot, the 2 nid not be mutualli exclusive rite? Yah... so c how it goes bahz.  Supposed to club 2nite de, but then 2mr got IPPT, so decided to dismiss tt thot. Hee!! Hopefulli, I'll be able to clear all stations and get at least a silver!!! Gold seems unattainable, but... I will try.... reallllll hard!!! HahaX!!   "Keep away from people who try to belittle your ambitions. Small people always do that, but the really great ones make you feel that you too, can become great."

       SuM uNiNteReStiN' eVeNtS    Sunday:  Too bored!!! Kok Boon proposed watchin' soccer matches @ the National Stadium. I agreed wifout givin' it much thot. Can't realli comment much on the games played 'coz they're supposed to be exhibition matches (tink it's sum Sultan of Selangor's Cup) so not much of competitive moves. Btw, the 1st match was played between Singapore veterans vs Mysia veterans. The latter won on penalty (5-3) after a 3-3 draw at full time. Realli applaud the veterans for their spirit 'coz sum of them haf alr reached their fifties and were still to display sum fine soccer skills!! *cHeeRs!!* The later match staged S League All-star vs Selangor MPPJ FC (Watever tt means... n i dun give a damn!! Hee!!). In constrast, tt was a more vigourous match and it din appear for moments tt they were in a friendly match. Nevertheless, agressiveness was kept to its minimum: Both players and fanz. *pHeW* I still rem the other time durin' the M'ysian Cup time, fans from both sides had to be segregated in order to prevent fans' crashes... Hee! Anyway, they drew 2-2 when we left. Wat's the final score?? Go check the papers lahz!! We had to beat the traffic jam b4 the match ended mahz... Keke!! Then went East Coast Park for sum drinks. Junping recommended one cafe call Summer Rock... but it sucked 'coz it wasn't even open!! Too bad, Had to do wif Mac... *HaiX*   Monday:  Nth interestin' today too 'xcept for the fact tt I went for an interview for the position of recruitment consultant for the thrill of it!! Hee!! Din want the job in any case, but juz to kill time n build up sum interview experience!! HahahaX! Followin' tt, met RQ for lunch (High tea considerin' the time... Hee!!) @ BK in Raffles City Shoppin' Centre. The 2 loners had no other better business to do, therefore went for a KTV session @ Suntec. OMG!! Definately not part of the plan, if any, for 2day. But, well, we did tt... 2 lonely soulz... *HaiX*  When I came back, I received a beri beri sweet email from my girl girl wor... so sweet!! *MuaCk MuaCk* HahaX!! Sumtimes it always so heart-warmin' to be missed, whoever tt person might be. But the sensation would be even greater if tt person happens to be sumone u cherish n dear to ur heart. For mi... erhmm... alrite onli lahz... otherwise, she will hao lian. Hee!! Kok Boon's policy.   Sumtimes juz feel tt women r beri dependent creatures (though I instated the title of predator in my previous entry... hee!!). Once they find a life buoy, they will cling on to it no matter wat happens; even if they know tt they can't hold on to it for the rest of their life. All these hold true untill they've found their shore. Soundz depressin' for the men out there (Yesh!! n it includes mi!!~! arGhhh!! %$$^%#$%$@~~... but... wtf.. be more gracious can?) Dunno y she missed mi... she doesn't know either. Mabbe she's startin' to rely on mi alr... Who cares?? I've got the gold award for Lifesaver course k?? n I'm supposed to save lives.. n HEY!! I'm beginnin' to love my mission!! HahahaX!! Since last July... if tt ringz a bell for sum pple... Hee!!

       UoB iNteRVieW... ScReWeD!!~!   *HaiX* Dun tink I stand a chance after I went for the UOB interview. It wasn't realli a tough one, but then sumhow, I din manage as well as I've anticipated. It was carried out on a group discussion format and the rest of the pple performed quite well. All, wif the exception of mi, probably.. *HaiX* Mabbe I wasn't so articulative afterall... or mabbe I could onli crap... For thingz like current affairs which require sum degree of thoughts, I usualli screw up. Damn.. there goes my chance! Not in the least hopeful that I could be short-listed for the next round of interview. =(  Then accompanied Ken (he attended another interview by sum swiss bank... keep forgettin' its name though... Hehe!)to Funan to mit his Jolene for lunch. I excused myself to go to coffee bean instead in order to avoid unneccessary inconvenience (for watever reasons). Anyway, Simin went to International Plaza n joined mi in Coffee Bean shortly after. After their lunch, the 3 of us left for Cineleisure for sum pool actions while Jolene got back to work. *HaiX* Was feelin' quite lethargic today, so anytin goes lahz. Moreover din wanna go home so early, might as well join them. But realli could not stand the tiredness. I had difficulty even keepin' my eyes open. Tink it muz haf been the effect of overdosage of kopi on an empty stomach. The caffine juz erodes into ur brain and corrodes all the functionin' cells. Keke!! From my experience, there might be sum truth to it. Hee!!  Hafn't had lunch the whole day... feelin' 'xtremely sleepy + hungry now. Ever heard of the sayin' "a lean and hungry man is a dangerous man"? So better not agitate mi now, otherwise I could realli bite!!! Then guoliang of all time arranged a supper session 2nite, therefore dun tink I would be able to get enulf rest. It's alr 7plus now. Guess if I realli mentally cannot tahan, will haf to call off the whole thing. *HaiX* Pai seh lahz.... let u all down again. Mabbe can invite mi out on my b'day (which is soon!!) and gimmi a treat. Then I would be most delighted to attend.. but a word of caution: no alcohol pls... Hee!!   "Quite often we change jobs, friends and spouses instead of ourselves."

       I Think Of You Lyrics   When I'm down and all alone When nothing seems to matter When I lose my hope When I'm sad and confused  When it all gets turned around and 'round  I can't seem to reach for solid ground When everything I've believed in seems untrue All I have to do  [Chorus] Is think of you  I think of you and it's gone Like you chase away the storm Making it all okay I think of you I think of you and I'm strong And I know I can go on It's like you set me free When life gets the best of me I just think of you  Now I know what love means And whatever life may hold for me Through the fire Through the rain I believe  Cause there's nothing I can't bear Knowing that you will be there If I fall I won't break Through it all I'll make it through Cause all I have to do  [Chorus]  And when I think I'm all alone I can't see the way to go Lost in the rain of my own tears To wash away the pain and fear  [Chorus]  For the good times and the bad times I just think of you Cause you know you get the best of me I just think of you   My FaVoRiTe aRtiSt NoW!!

       FoTo ShOOt!!   Finalli decided to get up on my butt to take a proper foto shoot for my interview wif UOB 2mr. Aiyah, so troublesum, still nid foto for wat? I yan dao means yan dao, dun haf to go thru all the hassle in order to get hold to my foto rite? keke!! But then, I realli hate my image now!!! Hate it!! Hate it!! Hate it to the core!! Even I myself couldn't be attracted by my new look, not to mention others... *HaiX* Dun believe refer below. So nutty.. toot toot one!! I dun care, I'm gg to revert to my original image once I get my job!!! *eViL gRiN*   WoaH!! WaT a YaN DaO MaN!! DuN CoMpLaiN iT'S nOt eXeCutiVe eNuFF NoW!! &nbsp; urlLink     urlLink     Then in the mornin' kena woken up by a phone call again. tt guy was actualli callin' from Charter... conducted an impromptu interview on the spot!! Oh my goodness!! I haf not even stepped out of my dreamland!! Anyway, I sorta made it and was scheduled for an interview this comin' Friday. tt makes it 2 interviews in a row!! Hopefulli, I can be selected for either one!! Pray for mi k??  Dun tink I'm gg to do any preparation for the interview 2mr since it's gonna be a group session. Tink I'll juz be myself, tt could suffice. Haf no wish to put up a false front to win the job juz to realise in future tt I dun blend into the culture of the firm. Erhmm... but come to tink of this, mabbe the onli culture tt suits mi is the circus wor... Hee!! A pity there isn't any job openin' for clowns, otherwise, I would haf been the most eligible candidate!! bWahahaX!!  aRgHHHhhh!! Realli hate my new hairstyle!! It sux!! BIG TIME!! even the quotation below won't make mi change my perception!!   "Darkness cannot drive out darkness; only light can do that. Hate cannot drive out hate; only love can do that"

       tHaiLaNd tRiP!!    Hafn't been able to blog this few dayz 'coz I went to Thailand for a 4D/3N trip. Yippee!! Finalli completed my graduation trip! (which is kinda depressin' 'coz I can't afford to travel anywhere else.. *HaiX*) Had expected a trip full of booze & "erotic" encounters but those were held to a minimum. Well, sumtimez u juz can't expect thingz to go in ur way all the time. It's all abt compromisin' esp when gg in a diversed group. At least there are sum thingz I've learnt from this trip which would be quite important when I embark on my next expedition. I shall cover tt later. Now juz briefly go thru' the daily occurrence.    Day1:  I woke up exceptionally early this mornin' @ ard 0730am. Dunno y, but was not excited @ all over the trip. Mabbe 'coz I din haf much preparation prior to the trip and so wasn't anticipatin' a realli enjoyable holiday. We took flight SQ69 and to my disappointment, found the service quality of the air stewardesses of SIA pretty bad. First of all, they were not beri professional and u could notice tt they were usin' Singish moz of the time. More importantly, they dun look phyicalli appealin' @ all!! Realli yucky!! *PoUt* Reached the Kingdom of Sex @ ard 130pm. Our tour guide picked us up @ the Donmuang International Airport and drove us to Asia Hotel (tt's where we stayed!! Hee!).  YanLiNg & I oN tHe sTaiRCaSe LeaDiN' tO tHe LoBBy iN aSia HoTeL. DuNNo wHeRe sHe WaS LuKiN' tHoUgH!! Hee!&nbsp; urlLink     urlLink     First day was pretty fine. Took our lunch @ a Jap restuarant and spent the rest of the afternoon shoppin' @ MBK Center. While shoppin', I made a phone call to Wakie (a Thai gal I know in Friendster) to inform her tt we've reached. The coincidental thing was, she was in MBK as well!! Wat a pleasant surprise!! Anyway, she's such a pretty, nicey, sweetie!! She pinpointed the various tourist spots in Bangkok and even volunteered to show us ard. No wonder Kok Boon said Thais are beri friendly & hospitable pple. Seein' is believein'... Keke! A pity she had to leave early for work, otherwise, we could haf spent more time together... *HaiX* Hee!  We oUtSiDe MBK oN DaY oNe!! NoTiCe tHe DeSCeNdiN OrDeR oF HeiGhT... KeKe!!&nbsp; urlLink     urlLink     Forgotten whether we took dinner... dun tink we had bahz. Anyhow, we returned to Asia Hotel to deposit our belongings b4 proceedin' to Suan Luan Night Bazaar for another round of shoppin'. Geez, it's realli warm in there. Try to imagine bugis village and u add the humidity by 20%. Afterwhich, we settled down @ an open space food center (can't find a more appropriate term) for sum refreshments. Aiyah, I dumb dumb, went to order beer.. Shldn't haf done tt 'coz I was delayin' our own restin' time. Shld haf juz gone back to the hotel to prepare for another round of "battle" the followin' day. *SiGhZ* Juz wanted to liven up the atmosphere wif sum beer mahz... HahahaX... juz creatin' excuses for myself!  RTU (Return to Unit) @ ard 2am. Waited probably one & a half decade for Yanling to finsih bathin' b4 I could haf mine. By the time it was my turn, could feel the cobwebs ard mi liaoz. Women will alwayz be women. I dun blame nor mind her for tt.. Hee!!    Day2:  Took our complementary breakfast @ the restuarant in Asia Hotel. Goodness mi!! Can't imagine mi wakin' up so early juz for breakfast. This goes back as far as when I was in NS.. Keke! As planned, we went to Siam Center , Siam Discovery Center & Siam Paragon to jalan jalan. Reached there too early, so we had to wait @ Starbucks to wait for the shoppin' malls to open. Damn!! These places hold a strikin' resembance to those malls in Orchard, hence we juz chop chop took a glimpse of the shops and departed for Central World Plaza (their WTC, but I suspect sumtin else 'coz I can't find the sign anywhere 'xcept for "Zen")   Aiyo!! The walk there realli was a torture!! I could feel myself meltin' sia!! Now I measure 3 cm shorter than b4 the trip... bWahahaX!! There also nth much, juz shops like those in Isetan. In fact,there's realli a branch there.. MNC ne!! Then frenly aH WiNg met a SGaporean peh peh there, so he made the initiative to tok to him. Horrors of horrors, he's such an extremist!! Totalli condemned the Government for overchargin' us and degraded the prospect of SG. *HaiX* Tink not everyone as patriotic as dear aH WiNg one, so I pardon him for tt. But on a more serious note, y do the elderly haf so many complaints and discontentment when the robust workin' population hold their breath to such issues? Or mabbe I'm too ignorant to notice. OppS!! Due to "fatique", we had to RTU again for a nap. Aiyah, the heat had the best of us, wat can we do?? No choice... No choice...  Wakie picked us up in the late afternoon (if my memory serves mi right) to show us ard Bangkok. e.g. Chitralada Palace (The King's place), Wat Benchamabophit (Marble Temple)etc etc... Aiyah.. those names I gave are wat I agar one... mabbe not those. Dun expect mi to remember all the names of the places I went rite?? Hee! But too bad, we din stop over to take any foto 'coz Wakie was in a hurry to go to work. But realli appreciate her for all the thingz tt she's done for us. Ask mi to 以身相许 I oso dun mind wor... bWahahaX!!  Subsequently, we went to Khao Shan for a shoppin' sphee again. Woah! I was quite fascinated by the stalls there. It's not as packed as Suan Lum Night Bazaar and it's not as stuffy as well. Juz imagine Mohd Sultan wif mobile stallsin between the pubs and u will get Khao Shan. Got alot of stuff to shop there sia!! Totalli at a loss as to wat to get. In the end, I oso din get anytin though the thingz there were dirt-cheap. *tSk tSk* Then we took a tuk-tuk to Somdet Chao Phraya Market. Gosh!! This is one shoppin' paradize wif lotsa clothin', accesseries, ornaments sellin' at a fraction of the price sold in SG. But it was quite congested, luckily we went @ nite, otherwise, could haf suffered from heat stroke... Keke!! I tink women go there moz probably will become mad, 'coz realli too many choices!! Anyway, Jolene & Yanling survived the ordeal... HahahaX!   After a hard day's work, we decided to go for a massage to pamper ourselves. Bein' a highly communicative person, I volunteered to ask the policeman there for a good massaging parlour. He recommended Khao San, so we returned to Khao San once again. The Thai massage fell short of our expectation. Mabbe 'coz we cheap skate, went for a half hour session onli. lolX! Could sense Jolene & Ken's exhaustion, so we agreed to split up: The two of them went back to hotel for sum hanky-panky (probably... hee!), while Yanling & I went to Suzie's pub for sum clubbin' session.   *HaiX* Again, it was a disappointment. We din even get to enter the pub 'coz Yanling din bring her ID along. *SighZ* It's heng tt I'm a forgivin' person, so din blame her @ all. Not even the least bit. Therefore, the two of us resorted to drink @ the bar counter juz outside Suzie's. It was pretty sianz initially, but a bartender offered to tah whisky dry wif mi!! Hey!! He's such a friendly & kind soul!! Knew we couldn't go in hence kept mi entertained!! So nice!! Anyway, I told him tt I'm willing to pay for our drinks if he's agreeable to tah wif mi, however he declined my offer. Instead, he treated mi to 2 more drinks on the house!! Woah!! Had a realli good impression of Thais then!! :) Would never forget tt cute chap who drank wif mi on tt borin' nite!! Keke!! Highlight of the day: I ate fried scorpian & grasshoppers!! Dun say "yucks" 'coz they were oishii ne!!! Tink the next time I go, I would try more of those!! One thing I found amusin' was when the police came to chase the food vendors away, they were still takin' their own sweet time, relak relak pushed their charts away. One of them even stopped to bbq food for mi. Wat the heck!!! Realli damn farnie!! RofL!!!   Day3:  Had the complimentary breakfast as usual. Today was finalli sumthing different from the previous 2 days!! No more shoppin'!! Gheez!! Not tt I was sick of shoppin', in fact I felt tt I nided more!! But then, I din wanna spend my time in Thailand shoppin' onli; I wanted sum sight-seein', sum local delicacies... sum other thingz tt we won't usually haf the chance to do in SG. If not, it would completely defeat the purpose of us comin' in the 1st place, esp when it's our 1st time here. At least get to know their culture better from their daily lifestyle, habits etc. Today Wakie brought mi to the theme park, Dream World!! Yanling tagged along... bWahahahaX!! (No lah, she brought the BOTH of us there)Ken & Jolene went to Chatuchak Market instead 'coz it's onli open on weekendz. Can't afford to waste any chances. For mi... Relak lahz... still got time after Dream World, moreover still got 2mr!! Hee!!  Had lotsa fun @ the amusement park!! Woah!! Was realli thrilled by the rides man!! If there's one thing other than sex tt could turn mi on, it would haf been these gravity-defyin' rides!! Totalli enjoyed thoroughly... but wished there were more!! Hee!! Anyway, Wakie wasn't tired out nor in the least affected by these rides @ all!! She was still damned energetic & kept hurryin' us to the next venue. Could sense tt Yanling couldn't make it anymore though.. Hee! Even I was pretty dizzy after the Raptor.. tink Wakie can realli bite man!! Then we watched a 'live' performance of SWAT team in action. It was like watchin an action flick wif all casts 'live' in action!! I was quite amazed by the pyrotechnic effects 'coz the onli time I had a close encounter wif them was when I was still a NSF. *SaD* Anyway, they put up a remarkable show though not realli spectacular... HahaX!!  Followin' tt, Wakie drove us back to Asia Hotel for us to wash up & to fetch Ken & Jolene. Had dinner @ a pasta restuarant @ Khao San. Then realized sumthing realli coincidental!!! I was realli amazed by fate!! The bartender who drank wif mi the previous nite is actualli Wakie's ex-bf!! Definitely din cross my mind... but... how could the world be so small? Sumhow, I suspect a conspiracy... Mabbe by God?? Hee!! After dinner, she brought us to the no. 1 pub in Bangkok!!! It was a great place wif a fantastic band, however, wat lackin' was our mood. So din realli had great fun. Nevertheless, tt won't be my last time there!! I'll be back!!  So we left the pub and went to a night flea market to do sum last minute shoppin'. I can't remember where but it seems tt the market opens from night time to the followin' afternoon. Beri interestin' place wif lotsa 2nd hand (or perhaps multiple hand) pdts like remote controls, spare parts, electrical appliances etc. Din stay there long 'coz sum of us almost suffered from concussion... HahahaX... no lah... juz tired... so din carry on wif supper, as planned originalli. RTU then. ZzzZZzz Realli can't wait to come back to SG...   Day4:  Our last day in Bangkok. Din haf the chance to visit Chatuchak Market the previous day, so die die had to wake up early juz to appease Yanling (Oops!!) as well as to make a desperate attempt to buy sumtin to pacify my family. Hee! She bought lotsa thingz sia!! Eventualli she even had to buy a bag to carry all the barang barang she bought. I was more of a maid, helpin' her carry all the thingz. Anyway, it was a fruitful trip and once again aH WiNg saved the day!! At least we haf achieved the aim of visitin' the largest market in Bangkok!! All in a mornin' work!! Yah... and Ken & Jolene were sleepin' all this while... Keke!!  Took lunch @  MBK and did sum casual shoppin' b4 returnin' to hotel. Reached the airport @ ard 430pm Thai time. Couldn't bear to leave such a nice place *WeeP WeeP* Took flight SQ65 and played the games on Kris World. Tink won't haf many chances to travel in SQ in future bahz. Thus though exhausted, I stayed awake thruout to enjoy watever was left. 1030pm: Finalli HOME SWEET HOME!!!    Sum lessons learnt:   1. The service quality of SIA left much to be desired. esp. the air stewardess... if all are like HS, then alrite liaoz. Hee!  2. Women in Thailand are not dark!! In fact 70% of them are tall, slender and fair-skinned!! e.g. Wakie!!  3. Thais dun smoke as much as SGaporeans despite low cigarette prices. Take a look @ their pubs u will know. The air is so much fresher in there. n the onli time we saw a group of pple smoke, they were a group of SGaporeans (My friendz) -.-'"   4. Men & Women are animals. The former are tamed ones while the latter are fierce ones. The former are prey to the latter. Sum of these predators bite while others gobble!!! bWahahahahaX!!  5. Like wat sum ladyboys said, "Girl more money". tt is certainly the case there.    6. I'm easily amazed, fascinated and infatuated. For instance, I'm obessessed wif Tata Young now!!  7. Dun go Thailand wif gers... u will end up being their slaves. Go wif guyz instead... gers will be ur slave!! lolX!!  8. Dun buy package tours. U will end up payin' more; go for the cheaper guest houses instead.  9. Contary to common beliefs, Bangkok is actualli a beri clean place. Though the dustbins are located beri far apart, u still won't find litter all over the place. In fact, u wanna litter, u will oso feel pai seh. tt's the dulan part... HahahaX!  10. Mabbe the myth abt gong tao in Thailand is true!! Inspite of hafin' a less than satisfactory trip, I've fallen in love wif the place!! I will be back!!     "Would any one of us undertake even a journey of a few hundred miles without knowing why, without having some purpose? And yet, so many of us live, undertaking not a chance task, but the great Task of life itself... and yet we ask not why."

       sCReWeD DaY   Been quite a screwed up day. Last nite slept late prior to the interview this mornin' 'coz I went to Wet & Whistle again. Left pretty late due to sum unforseen circumstances, so took a cab home in order to prepare for my interview today. Anyway, din prepare much 'xcept for the attire tt I was gg to wear. DaMN!!! Was supposed to sign the contract wif CitiBank ytd, but I had to work in Robinson's since Cindy applied for compassionate leave (her mum-in-law passed away). BoBian lohz, had to replace her. *HaiX* Sumtimes har, realli tink SnowDown is a jinx lehz... alwayz hinderin' my progress. On the other hand, it has helped mi alot too... esp. durin' my time of financial despair... Kekeke!! Aiyah, watever it is, I'm gonna wash my handz off the company!! Not gg to help out anymore!! HuMpH!!!  Could haf been employed now instead of waitin' for the results... aRgHHHhh!!!  Not onli tt, if I dun haf to help out, I could haf gone for a hair-cut instead of invitin' condemnation (Gentle reminder on the surface) by the inviewer (dunno his name lahz... can't be bothered by his pig face!!). Wanted mi to go for interview, but nv kept to timin' n still postponed the timin' to 1130am when it was arranged to be @ 930am. Made mi wake up so damn bloody early and drank double shot cuppaccino for nth!! Fuck him!!!~!~!   Sibei dulan by his remark, so immediately went for a haircut. Told Nicholas to style a more versatile design so tt I dun haf to keep a nutty hairstyle when I go out on weekendz. Lookz quite ok (@ least to mi.. Hee!!) but dun tink can attract as many xiao mei mei alr... Erhmmm... or should I say, in the 1st place  I alr cannot attract any gerz *SoB*; now wif my new hairstyle, mabbe I may even turn them off to the extent tt they refrain from guyz for a few dayz... HahahaX!  Feellin' unusualli sleepy now. Tink the effect of the double expresso is wearin' off. No, No!! I'm fallin' asleep!! aHHhhHH!!  *YaWnZ* ZzZZzzz *sNoReZ*   "Hard work beats talent when talent doesn't work hard."

Finalli, an opportunity to escape reality!! It may be juz 3D/2N but well, at least it's better than nth rite?  Wat we will be doing there... hmmm... GOAL SETTIN'! And yesh, I'm gg wif my company. *YaWnZ* So u can say tt it's not exactly a R&R trip. Main objective of the trip is to set objectives for the rest of the yr. Soundz chiam, doesn't it? Hee!!  Shall do my packin' later @ nite. Anyway, it's juz a short getaway, so tink the procedure would be quite hassle-free.   I will enjoy myself. Dun worry too much. lolX!!

       ReJeCteD    I was rejected!!   "Yah, tell us sumtin' new." u may say.  The point is, no one can get rejected so many dozens times in a single day. NO ONE!!! Unless tt person happens to be a salesman, tt is. Ahem... hmm... then mabbe I should feel more consoled now.  So far, I hafn't had any rejections from initiatin' a relationship wif a ger yet. Perhaps, it's retribution time?? Hee!!  Otherwise, How do u explain the number of rejections I received today?? Encounter wif the third-kind? lolX!!  Feelin' so dejected, depressed, despondent, disheartened, discouraged from all the rejections. FUCK SHIT!! It was such a gloomy day. Could almost feel the stormy dark clouds above my head. *SiGhZ*  Ok, enuff of complaints. I'm a green-horn. But sumhow, I managed to convince myself tt I shouldn't use tt as an excuse to pardon my incompetence.  By now, sum of u should haf alr guessed tt I din manage to clinch any sales today. Absolutely   NONE  !!!  I repeat.     NONE    !!!!!  Wat on earth could be worse than tt? Not closing any deals for a few dayz?? Keke!!  At least I realised tt sellin' insurance policies is not as simple as I've anticipated. It requires alot of optimistism, persistency and not to forget endurance. Lest u can't tahan the prospectin' nature of the job.  I should give myself sum credits though. I ought to. For keepin' a fine list of propectus for follow-up. Still, it's not good enuff. I know.   But hey!! Hold back ur skeptisim!! I can do it!! I'm WiNg remember?? I'm a born motivator. If I'm suppressed by this ill fate, wat's gg to happen to the rest?   No impact, I assume. HahahaX! As if they care abt mi. Keke!  The fact is, I failed miserably today. I will not despair. Instead, watch out for my revenge!! I will be back... Wif a vengeance!! Hee!!

       SuMtiN' sTuPiD   Ok, I haf to explain once again tt I'm not a sexist though I've been kinda condemnin' women in my blogs. Keke! Can't help it especialli when time and again, these women are proven less superior (notice tt I din use the word "inferior". Hee!) than us men.    This is one of the theorical example!! Hee!&nbsp; urlLink     urlLink     But, still I nid to clarify tt though it has been proven (well, from above, at least.. Hee!) tt women are evil, most of us men still fall victim to their "vicious traps". Shit!! Mabbe tt explains y I'm so easily mesmerized by them!! Keke!!  Anyway, I dun ask for much in a woman. She juz has to be tall, rich, beautiful, nice, smart, farnie, sexy, voluptuous, honest, sincere, helpful, patient, kind, independent and of coz willing to feed mi beer & chips while I lay ard and msn other babes.   So any volunteers?? lolX!!  To tell u the truth, I've fallen in love wif myself. I juz can't seem to understand y I'm lackin' in suitors. *HaiX* I'm such a humourous, amiable, compassionate, pleasant, charmin', cheerful, jovial, likable, congenial, fine young man, how come nobody wants mi?? *SoB* Izzit 'coz I like to lie?? HahahaX!! Sumbody, pls enlighten mi!!    Babe alert!!!    This is Lin. I may get to know her better soon. I hope not. Lest I get obsessed again. Keke! But how could I let her escape from my clutches?? WahahahahaX!!  &nbsp; urlLink     urlLink     Hey, chill man!! Chill!! Juz kiddin' onli. Dun get so worked up!! If u want to know her, we can alwayz come out 2gether!! No worries. Hee!!

       cHiLL oUt!!   Been on the hunt for chill-out spots in s'pore & haf been to sum of them recently!!   Went to Wala-Wala last nite wif kok Boon, Junping & Wakie. It's an easy-on-the-pocket venue in Holland Village where an exceptional two-for-one happy hour from 4pm-9pm lets you pre-order as many drinks as you think you can handle, to arrive one by one... Icy cold!!   Oh, did I mention the live band rox too?? Hee!!  Followin' tt, sent Wakie off @ the airport in the mornin'. Realli sad to c her go. *WeeP WeeP*   I begin to realize tt...   I can't live wifout her!!!      Why the fuck did she leave so soon?!!??    Relak lah!! Juz kiddin' onli!! Dun wanna smash the dreams of so many innocent gers. bWahahahahaX!!  Juz feel tt it's a pity she din manage to achieve her objective in comin' here. It's such a wasted trip. No wish to elaborate on the details though. Arghhhhh....   After sendin' her off, joined Xikai & Wenhan for lunch @ NUS. It's gown collection day!! Time realli flies. Before we know it, we're already graduatin'. Kinda miss those dayz we hang out 2gether after lessons, esp when Loon Kah was still ard. *HaiX*  Anyway, I juz came back from AlleyBar wif both of them. As I mentioned previously, I'm on a bar-hunt. So yah. Apparantly I've out-grown clubbin'. Now I prefer sittin' down & chit-chat over a few drinks.   I've no intention to discriminate, but clubbin' is realli for kids. Or should I say it's for pple who are more energetic and vibrant? No offence, yah? I'm juz too old for these.  Juz to round up...    Ice Cold Beer   Very affordable, but can be very rowdy at times, usually quite crowded.    Alley bar   Drinks are all at least $13 and above. Nice place to chill, and talk. Has two areas, one is at the bar side, the other is filled w/ nice cosy sofas.    Balaclava   Suntec. Very nice ambience, you can't entered w/ bermudas/sandals. Happy hour, I tried before, 2 pints of Hoee at $20.     Wala-Wala   Great place to drink and good food to eat. They have nice food like chicken wings and pizza. Their band is gd too. Check it out!  tt's abt all for these few dayz. Hope tt I'll haf the time (& of coz money.. lolX) to exploit more uncovered territories. It seems tt Westin Stamford and this bar in Bugis offer great ambience too. But tink I nid to build up my capital pool first.     Financial plannin', anyone??   Hee!!

       FaiLuRe!!   In my previous post, I quoted "There is no failure; there is onli learner." Okay, I lied thru' my pearly white teeth (when in fact, they're yellowish... *SaD*).  Failed my HI paper by a narrow margin... but sumhow figured tt it's still a failure. *SoB* This is unexpected of mi!! How could a genius like mi not pass such an easy paper!!!~!!  The fact of life is "Why not??"  I was too caught up in my own personal stuff tt I totalli treated the paper as a secondary concern. *HaiX* No one else to be blamed 'xcept myself. Shouldn't haf be so complacent. I should haf seen it comin'.   Then I began to realize sumtin'. I'm not realli a genius (when actually I should haf discovered long ago.. Keke!) I'm juz more focused. But too bad, juz a teeny-weeny bit of distraction usually renders my concentration void. This is one area I muz learn to handle.  Was pretty much demoralised by my paper. Subsequently cheered up upon meetin' Wakie. Guess in many wayz, we are quite identical. This is beside the fact tt we are born in the yr of monkey.  She's a beri independent ger, likes to socialise and alwayz haf a positive impact on her peers. However, @ times she will keep to herself in the darkness of the night reflectin' on thingz, events, watever. Quite sensible for her age and alwayz like to shower pple wif love and affection. This is one quality tt I find it hard to match.  Unlike typical Singaporeans, she's beri frank and upfront. She does not wear a mask; instead I was impressed by her "realness"...  if u get wat I mean. Watever the case, I haf definitely found a true friend to keep... perhaps for life. Most probably.  And hey!! It's Cecilia's 21st b'day juz abt 1 hr ago!! Bein' ever so sweet (or u can call it buaya if u want.. lolX) as usual, I bought her a stalk of pink rose. Actualli it's more of cheerin' her up, coz she flunked both papers. Anyhow, hope she's feelin' better now. Check out my best colleague  urlLink here !! She's a sweety too!!  How come I haf so few male frenz nowadayz har?? Beats mi too. Hee!      Another place to chill-out!! Balaclava!! Nice ambience wif live band!! If u like Wala Wala, I'm sure u'll love Balaclava!! No joke!! But u better get dressed up for the ocassion 'coz most of the patronisers are workin' executives. So dun haf to teach u wat to wear rite? T-shirt & jeans is a definite nono. Located @ Suntec City.

It's been such a tirin' day. Din cover as many places as I originalli intended. Anyway, went to Chinatown for the "famous" frogs' legs porridge and spent pretty much of the rest of the evenin' there, shoppin' for localities.  Met up wif Kok Boon @ One Fullerton. But din stay there for long coz it's a Sunday!! Nobody in their right mind would loiter on the street tt late on Sundays.. Keke!!  Now tt I'm home, decided to blog 1st b4 committin' fully to studies. Damn.. realli low morale. FYI, Wakie's soundly asleep on my bed now. Tink the flight had the best of her... lolX! Better restrain myself b4 I unleash the monster in mi!! HahaX!!

Anyway....  this is it!!     This is a freakin' cool place occupied predominately by ang moh expatriates. A nice pub to relax and chill out especialli after work.

Juz follow ur gut instinct and u'll reach in no time... or mabbe later. Hee!     Does it appear for a moment tt I'm the spokeperson for ICB?? To be honest, I'm not!!

       PennY FoR mY tHoUgHtS   DEFENCE Minister Teo Chee Hean announced on Tuesday tt all NSmen -with or without A-level, diploma or higher qualifications - will now serve 24 mths, or two yrs.    He explained tt two key factors haf made this cut-back possible: One is the rise of the 3rd Generation SAF - a smaller but potent fighting force backed by technologicalli advanced surveillance and battle-field systems as well as wargamin' systems and trainin' simulators.  The other key factor is the anticipated rise in the number of males eligible for NS in the comin' decade followin' the mini baby boom between the Chinese 'Dragon' yr of 1988 and 1997.  Put aside all the jeerin' and cheerin' for this new decision. Be honest to urself. The  additional 1/2 yr tt we served was one of the moz carefree period of our lives. Dun u all miss those days wreaking havoc together with your army buddies? Nonetheless, I still feel that the extra few months wasn't worth it... one bit!  I guess it depends on wat u do durin' the 6 months. Sum pple chiong suah until the end, while others spent their time doing sai kang. I relaked one corner!! Hee!! So it was a complete waste of time.   Watever the case, since they have 6 mths less and still need to maintain the operational readiness, mabbe their outfield tempo will be higher. Ok, tt spells field camp every week! bWahahahaX!! They deserve it!! Still envy them?? Keke!  Now, change in topic...  Haf u ever wonder whether there's this "sumone" out there who is destined to be wif u?? If so, how can u know for sure tt he/she is ur destiny?   I'm a strong believer of fate and I advocate destiny. Sumhow, I believe tt in this game of love(if it's ever a game to start wif), u will come to a cross junction where u haf to make a choice between acceptance or rejection. Whichever u choose, it doesn't necessarily mean the both of u r destined to be together or not. It juz shows tt u r already arranged by fate to meet.  Destiny... hmmm... hard to define. Webster's Dictionary defines it as an event (or a course of events) that will inevitably happen in the future. Such a simple definition; profound implications.  Isn't it assurin' to know tt there's "sumone" out there destined to be wif u? Of coz it is. But moz of the time, or shld I say all the time, we can't even identify the missin' jigsaw from our lives. Even Sun WuKong can't tell!! Not to mention Piggy like u nor Sandy... erhmm.... like Sandy~!! Hee! (p.s. read previous post)  Take a step back and tink. Even if u know u r fated to be wif this person for life, wat happens next? Hafin' the assurance of endin' up wif tt "sumone" might not be such a fantastic idea afterall. Complacency would juz set in and relationship might turn sour. Couples would be takin' each other for granted for they know for certain tt the both of them would eventualli be 2gether.  How beri sad!! Good intentions of fate bein' abused by mortal beingz. Can't help it... this is human nature. We won't feel the pinch till we've lost it... Love inclusive.  I'm not tryin' to suggest tt readin' into the future is no good. But if u dunno wat the future holds for u, wouldn't it be alot better? Man fear the unknown. Not exactly true if u live everyday as though it's the last. At least u know tt u r makin' every moment of ur life count. Even if 2mr nv comes, u still exist. Coz u realli do. No regrets. No shame.  Like wat I alwayz say, there's onli a limit to almoz everytin' in the world. Love exclusive. It is exhuastless & bottomless for love knows no end. I din put this down to provoke pple who's currently facin' a relationship crisis. Neither am I a love guru. Juz tt I find it a depressin' to find love fadin' over time. The basis of love doesn't work this way... not to mi.  Fate brings 2 persons 2gether; love bonds them 2gether. Destiny has alr done its part, how abt us? R we still trapped within our own matrix? If we dun break free, we won't be free! Likewise, if we dun wish to be understood, we won't be understood!! Love and u'll be reciprocated.   There's no point in searchin' for the "one". Often, we took too long lookin' for the "right one" that we alwayz miss the "one" by our side. No one can tell u whether he/she's the "one"... u haf to figure out for urself.   Hafin' doubt over whether he/she's the "one" is prefectly normal. Sumtimes it works out; sadly, most do not.    If love can be an economic equation, I will assume ceteris paribus- so tt love becomes alot simpler.  If love can be a mathematics equation, I will solve for a constant to the power of infinity- so tt love becomes eternal.  If love can be a scientic equation, I will create an irreversible reaction- so tt love can be treated seriously.  If love can be a language, I will choose hand sign- so tt we can use action to show this love.  If love can be a fairy tale, I will choose one wifout happy endin'- coz true love nv endz.   But we know that " if's " do not exist...  How I wish everyone can love one another. How I wish couples can hold on to their faith & prove destiny as a myth wrong. How I wish there is sunshine (not literalli though... Keke!) in everyone's  life and everyone can wake up happy. I was able to achieve these in my dreams, how abt reality?   "No man of woman born, Coward or brave, can shun his destiny"    "Fame comes only when deserved, and then is as inevitable as destiny, for it is destiny."

       MaTcH   Pple alwayz say "an invincible man is a lonely man". I've finalli met my match!! I no longer stand alone!! I haf sumone to take over my role as a clown!! She's none other than *DoNG DoNG DoNG DoNG DoNG DoNG DoNG DoNG* (Drum beatin' ferociousli)      MAPLE  !!!     She's damned farnie one lohz... Alwayz come up wif trautisin' stunts to terrify pple till they go bersek or kneel down to beg for mercy. Keke!! Birds of the feather flock 2gether, but I dun want to be associated wif her in any way...Keke... coz she would onli bring disgrace to our kind.. Hee!!    Then I thot she would haf sum form of dignity when I said tt she's a clown, but in the end, she rebutted in sayin' tt she's a walkin' joke. Isn't she freakin' farnie?? Cannot stand her man!! HahahahaX!!  Since I can't upload her foto (for dunno wat fuckin' reason), the link to her profile could be found  urlLink here . Check her out man!!  Okay lah. Despite all the humiliatin' thingz tt I've mentioned abt her, she's a damn nice gal. I realli enjoy her presence coz her behaviour is so comical!! Beri cartoon one wor!!  Classic joke of the day. We went to BK @ Suntec and ordered a Junior Whopper Meal to share. She requested for a knife to split the burger into 2. I obliged. Then she told mi she din wanna cut @ the place where we were sittin' coz it would be too obvious and she found it disgraceful.   Hence from the center of the restuarant, she shifted to the seat juz beside the glass panel facin' the main shoppin' mall. Dunno wat's on her mind man!!   Should haf shifted to the internal corner of the restuarant mah. At least those shoppers outside can't c us!! From the position she chose, not onli it's obvious to  ALL THE DINNERS , shoppers outside can oso look thru the  GLASS PANEL  as well loh!! Bird-brain!!  In any case, I personalli find tt the act of cuttin' the burger into halves to be perfectly alrite. And I have every reason to believe tt Maple is either a. Mentalli unsound or b. lame. bWahahahaX!!  But I haf to thank her for makin' my day so unbearably entertainin'. Couldn't stop laughin' when I saw her!! Keke!!  Yah, speakin' of laughin'. There's this Sandy in our company who's attendin' the same trainin' program as mi. Since I'm a hard-core fan of Sun Wukong, one fine day out of the blue...  Xindi casualli passed a remark,  "Hey Da Shi Xiong, Sandy is ur shi di leh."   Then all of us burst out laughin'!!! tt was realli ticklish!!    Btw, sandy is a hot babe loh!! HahahaX!! And u know I'm not referrin' to Sha Wujing rite?? Hee hee!!  Oops... I was abt to describe how nice Maple is... but in the end, I accidentalli revealed more foolish thingz tt she did. *HaiX* Feel so sad for her. Keke!!   Hey hey!! Got one more!! While sittin' there har, she unintentionalli knocked her head against the glass panel! Sum more, sum more!! She almost tripped when she climbed up the stairs to find her friend! It's realli damned hilarious loh!!!  Dunno wat the hell is in her brain.. Hee!! But her "gong gong" nature nv fails to brighten up my day, though it nv fails to amuse mi as well.  Aiyah, tink I dun be so bad. Keep sayin' bad thingz abt her... To sum up, Maple is realli a nice girl!! tt's abt all I can say abt her.. HahahaX!!

       CRoSS RoaDs   Oftentimes it is fear that keeps us form doing the things that we know we should do - fear of failure, fear of success, fear of rejection or ridicule, fear of intimacy or loss and fear of the unknown. Taking the narrow path is a journey into the unknown and it can be quite scary.   Action cures fear. Doing what it is that you are afraid of is really the only way to overcome your fear.   Fear is the great deceiver. Fear would lead you to believe that not taking action is the best route to take. After all, if you don't try you can't fail, if you don't take a chance you can't get rejected, if you don't open up and become vulnerable you won't get hurt, and if you don't move out of your comfort zone you will be safe.  What fear doesn't tell you is that if you don't try you have already failed, if you don't take a chance you will never reach your full potential, if you put up a wall you will never experience the fullness of love and if you don't move out of your comfort zone you will never live a life of abundance.   Remember F.E.A.R. as False Evidence Appearing Real.    "We must look for the opportunity in every difficulty instead of being paralyzed at the thought of the difficulty in every opportunity."    "Fear knocked at the door. Faith answered. And lo, no one was there."

Ok.. who cares abt the the prisoner of Azkaban?? He's juz a detainee afterall. And not forgettin' the fact tt his role is juz potato in the show. My main concern is...

The situation would be worse when their hormones begin to react adnormally to the opposite sex. *HaiX* gonna c them entangled in a love triangle soon...  Watever the case, it's alwayz good to see them so gd 2gether now... at least.&nbsp; urlLink     urlLink     And it's even better to see mi so hardworkin', workin' out on my spells now....

       WiNg   I haf no idea why I prefer "WiNg" over "WiNd". I remember when I was in JC, Yetty used to say I'm like the wind, alwayz on the move & nv seem to be able to stay put in one place. I guess tt's my personality. I dun like settlin' down. In other words, I love freedom. esp now, I do not wanna be tied down by commitments of any kind @ all!! Forgive mi if I've neglected anyone of u in any way. I can't even commit myself to the one & onli God, wat do u tink? Hee! Admit once again tt I'm a sinner.  But I nv like the nick "WiNd". Can't realli explain myself. Perhaps it's 'coz wind comes and goes wifout leavin' an impression (unless it's tornado or typhoon... Hee!!). I love attention. This might be the reason y I like to act silly or make a fool of myself. I would alwayz be the source of energy for my peers and loved ones. I dun like seein' anyone dear to mi gettin' hurt or sad 'coz I love myself more than anyone else. 'coz I know tt if they feel down & out, I will feel worse. I would rather give them wingz. Wingz to fly. Wingz to tide them over the troubled time. Wingz to help them overcome their difficulties. End of the day, all I want in return is juz regconization. Mabbe juz a frenly gesture to show tt I'm appreciated. tt would suffice. Realli.  In the proccess of growin' up, I've received a number of "wingz" from lotsa pple. I'm realli thankful for tt. One person I realli appreciate is Mel. I wanna thank her for being my first love, for all the beautiful memories tt we created together and for initiatin' the painful break-up tt made mi realised the importance of cherishin' watever I haf now. I've learnt to be more appreciative of thingz and be grateful to each & every moment in life. I've leant tt sumtimes to love is to let go of this love. More importantly, I've leant how to move on. Even when sumtimes I'm flyin' wifout wingz, I can rest assured tt I can still take off. I may not haf wingz, but I'm WiNg. My mission is become wingz for pple. @ the same time we soar 2gether. Isn't tt more wonderful than flyin' alone?  Durin' my selection camp earlier on last month, we were asked to write a letter to our loved ones. I wrote one letter for my mum, which is kinda expected. I've wanted to write one for Kiki, but decided to vanish the thot 'coz wat I haf for her is no longer love; juz guilt perhaps? Eventualli, I wrote sumtin for Mel and it goes exactly like this:   "Dear Mel,  Nothing impt. Juz tt I'm attendin' my propective company's selection camp and we are required to write a letter to our loved ones and the third person tt comes to my mind is YOU!!! So honoured rite? & please forgive mi for my handwritin' k? 'Coz I've written 3 full pages to my parents b4 I'm attemptin' this one. Bear wif it k??  Hmm... How do I start? Erhmm... Juz wanna thank you for being my first love. I still love u.. n u know I dun mean those BGR kinda love. I love u for all the sweet memories tt we shared. I love u for all the thingz tt I've leant durin' our relationship. I love u for bein' so kind & understandin' whenever I'm down & out. I love u for makin' mi realise the importance of other aspects of life. Thanx!!! Btw, dun get mi wrong hor!! I'm not tryin' to relight our flame. Juz tt, I realli (to power of infinity) appreciate u as a friend... my soul-mate. REALLI!! n u r realli so dear to mi in my heart.  U know sumtin'?? In this world, there is no one who understands mi as well as u do. U can realli read mi like a book. Then everytime when I'm depressed, the very first person I would tink of is u. So u can safely assume tt so far everytin's cool on my side!! ('Coz I hafn't been creatin' any trouble for u!!) Hee!! Gettin' hard to find soul-mates nowadays, but thank God I've found u!! Thank you Mel!!  Know tt u r leadin' a hectic life now, so I seldom disturb u unlike possibly RQ. Keke!! But HEY!! When u're free, can juz jio mi out for kopi or sumtin'. Yah??  Words can't explain how grateful I m towards ur friendship. Thanx thanx thanx!!! If not for u, there wouldn't be an optismistic WiNg as others see now. Realli thanx lots Mel!!  Love ya, 'WiNg"          Yah this is wat I wrote durin' the camp. Sumhow, the letter could haf been more sentimental or touchin', but I decided to leave these elements out 'coz I wanted her to feel appreciated for all tt she's done instead of gettin' emotional and all. Keke! Anyway, the letter was not delivered to her for sophiscated reasons so thot of postin' it here instead.   Other than Mel, I tink I've sum other pple to thank as well. Pardon mi if I leave out any names k?? 'coz I haf a realli bad memory (and it's certainly gettin' worse wif each passin' day... lolX!), and not 'coz u're not significant k??  ok... now. first up, i wanna thank my brothers, for bein' there whenever i fall; my 2 other ex, for bein' 2 extremely lovely angels when we were 2gether; Meng Seng, Dennis, Hairul & Co. for spicin' up my NS life; Jiayuan, Vicky & Jiajia, for all the memorable time we spent in JC; Jialong, Jiarui, Yinghao, Yingyan, Zikai, for bein' the first of my best frenz in life; Guoliang, Xikai, Loon Kah, Guoxing & of coz Wenhan, for all the projects we skived thru (Hee!!); Mike, Rongsheng, Audrey & co. for the 100% anti-dustmites quilt jokes and others tt we cracked on sales floor; the rest of the world whom I've touched or haf been touched by mi, for contributin' to the otherwise incomplete WiNg. Thanx trillion!!  Lastly, wanna share this song by Wayne Lin (who coincidentalli was my junior in SAJC). The lyrics realli rox!! Enjoy!! It's call  > aka "WiNg" in English.      翅膀   同样的机场　不同世界  同样的咖啡　不同味觉  同样的我和我　都少了一些  看飞机划过天空　不见了   用你给我的翅膀飞　我懂这不是伤悲  再高都不会累　我们都说好了  用你给我的翅膀飞　我感觉己够安慰  乌云也不再多　我们也不为谁掉眼泪   空气中藏着　你的香味  回忆里躲着　你的眼泪  最后拥抱的温暖还有一些  我拖着行李往前一直走   看一看回忆  是云朵　一朵朵的飘过  若想要回头　就无法翱翔,    "Old friends pass away, new friends appear. It is just like the days. An old day passes, a new day arrives. The important thing is to make it meaningful: a meaningful friend - or a meaningful day."

       CoNFeSSioNs   Come to tink of it, it's realli farnie. Guyz dun usually like pink, but it happens to be my favorite colour. Geez... and the person who pointed tt out to mi has to be Arisa. Keke!! Actualli I've noticed this "uniqueness" in taste long ago, but sorta gathered tt there was nth wrong wif associatin' myself to a more feminine colour.. Hee! Now tt sumone asked, tink I'll haf sum explanations to make.   Well, the reason y I like pink could be traced back as early as JC time. Durin' the time, I was realli close to this ger call Jiayuan. Ahem.. I dun mind disclosin' her name 'coz she won't be readin' my blog anyway. Hee! So yah, we were realli close then, but the weird thing is, we din haf any chemistry bondin' @ all, be it ionic or convalent... Keke! Everytime we went to Mac, she would order strawberry milkshake. U can say tt I was influenced by her, but this likin' for strawberry milkshake has been in mi till now. In fact, it's my favourite drink!! Too bad Mac no longer sells milkshake, not to mention strawberry ones. *HaiX* No idea why thingz din work out for the both of us, but at least I haf this friend for life!! The onli sad thing is... she forgot my b'day this yr... *SoB SoB* Anyway, so now u know whenever I order strawberry milkshake or the like, she'll definitely be on my mind!! Girls out there dun jealous k?? HahahaX!!  Yah... and so since the drink is pink, sumhow I developed a likin' for pinkish stuff. For instance, sum of u might haf noticed I'm not resistant to wearin' pink shirts, takin' bandung drink etc etc.. 'coz i realli find the colour damn sweet!!! Sumtin close would haf been purple.. but tt's so gay!! (n pink is supposed to be girly... lolx!!)   tt leads to another problem. Ok, this may not sound new to sum of u, but i've alwayz wanted to do medicure and pedicure!! Stunnin' isn't it? n if given the chance, I would certainly want to go for facial, spa, put on make-up etc etc... all the ladies' thingy, minus the shoppin' bit ('coz I'm still traumatised by wat happened in Thailand.. Hee!!) While bein' entitled to ladies, these are not even privilleges to us men!! To start wif, it's not even a social norm. I'll be despised, ostracized, boycotted. IT'S THAT SERIOUS!! 'coz they will be accusin' mi of bein' an ah gua or sissy.. *SiGhZ* Juz wanna try sumthin' different onli, can't be tt bad rite? Anyway frankly, I've not attain tt level of adventurousity (if there's such a word.. hee!) to initiate such an extraordinary project!! HahahaX!!   Sumtimes I haf doubts over my sexuality. I guess I'm juz bein' paranoid. 'coz I know for a fact tt I love women; on the other hand, men turn mi off!! *YuCkZ*!! Then other times I feel like becomin' a woman. Erhmm... definitely not along the line of a gender change, but juz an imagination. The painful truth is, we men haf nv experienced multiple orgasm b4!! The myth of multiple climaxes could onli be uncovered by the female species of man!! n speakin' of equality in rights... hmmm....  I admit to bein' guilty to all vices... well.. almost. But end of the day, I'm still a good man!! Yah rite... trust u to trust mi!! Hee!! The bottomlilne is, nowadayz good men are gettin' extinct. Those u find on the street are either bad or if they're realli good, chances are they're probably gays!! bWahahhaX!! I may not possess the best qualities of a good man, but at least I'm positive tt I'm straight!! Isn't tt reason enuff for mi to get the hell out of bachelors' club once & for all??? Can't anybody juz gimmi a break??? HahahaX!!

       JuNe 2Nd 2004   Dunno if it's Audrey's or John's b'day. But, anyway, I've alr wished them both, juz in case. Hee!! Haf absolutely no idea wat to do, wat not to do today. Supposedly it's a public holiday (Vesak Day, FYI), but keep hafin' this impression tt nobody wants to come out!!! Usually my phone would be ringin' non-stop like a toll-free hotline at this time. *HaiX* Guess pple nowadayz take each & every opportunity to rest durin' public holidayz. The same does not apply to mi. I get to rest EVERYDAY!!! Dun be envious, 'coz this oso meant tt I'm unemployed!!

       A tYPiCaL DaY @ RoaDsHoW   &nbsp;  I know I know, it has been centuries since I last blogged - and it's for an extremely logical reason. I've been busy wif my work. Makes sense?  &nbsp;  Juz to illustrate my typical day @ roadshows. In case anyone of u is not interested, u can close the window and log on to other porno websites as u deem fit. I'm gg to carry on anyhow. Hee! &nbsp;  Well, u can say tt my target market is generally young, single workin' women as well as skolin' gers. Of coz I'm referrin' to those poly and undergrads instead of penniless xiao mei mei lah!!  &nbsp;  Not tt I'm horny or anytin', but it seems tt this is the way thingz go in our line. We will usually approach prospect of the opposite gender so tt it will be easily to kick the conversation off. Sounds ridiculous? Ok. Imagine u are a man. Would u prefer a lady to approach u or otherwise? The answer is obvious.  &nbsp;  Anyway, back to the pt. Upon contact of a possible prey, I would dash out b4 anyone else to stop the prospect. All thanx to my athletic genes. lolX!  &nbsp;  WiNg: “Miss, can help mi do a survey? One minute onli lah… please??!?”  &nbsp;  Prospect: “Sorry, I'm in a hurry.”  &nbsp;  WiNg: “U in a hurry to go where? I go wif u lah! Dun walk so fast leh. I onli need one minute.”  &nbsp;  Prospect: “Dun want lah. No time.”  &nbsp;  WiNg: “I know u haf no time. But I onli need one minute mah. By the way, wat's ur age har?”  &nbsp;  Prospect: “20 lah!”  &nbsp;  WiNg: “Bingo!! That's the age I'm lookin' for loh. Help mi lah. The rest of the pple here all auntie. Onli u are eligible for the survey. Okok??”  &nbsp;  Then I would pester the person till she couldn't resist the temptation of tokin' to mi. And I know she's already fallen into my trap. Hee!! I would take down her particulars and @ the same time start to build rapport wif her.  &nbsp;  WiNg: “Still studyin' ah? Where?”  &nbsp;  Prospect: “NUS loh. Arts fac.”  &nbsp;  WiNg: “Oh!! Last time I oso from NUS. But it's BizAd. But I always go Arts fac canteen eat one. The food is good and the gers there oso beri sweet lookin' one wor.”   Upon hearin' this, the prospect would haf been flattered till cloud nine. Of coz, this differs from person to person. I juz haf to play by ear to respond to different pple. Once the rapport has been established, I would get to my main motive.  &nbsp;  WiNg: "Aiyah.! See lah. We get along so well tt I forget my purpose here.&nbsp;"&nbsp; &nbsp;  This is of coz not true.&nbsp;  &nbsp; Subsequently I would begin to survey the prospect. More often than not, I would inject humor into the conversation. Not tt hard though, juz haf to follow my instinct. Keke!  &nbsp;  Anyway, end of the day, once a solid foundation has been established, u are almost there. Apparently a good knowledge of the products is essential, however wat really matters most is ur soft skills. This is wat I'm tryin' to develop.  &nbsp;  Yah… faced numerous rejections already, but I won't let them dampen my spirit. Easy for mi to say, but seriously, my morale is quite low now. Coz I closed many, but some of them cancel the policies b4 they could even take effect. Tink I still haf to pull up my socks now. SiGhZ.  &nbsp;  Hmm… depressin' stuff aside. Now let's tok about sum lame excuses pple give for refusin'&nbsp;to do the surveys.  &nbsp;  Prospect: “Dun want lah. No time.”  &nbsp;  And she continued to stroll. Didn't sum bitch juz mention tt she's&nbsp;got no time? Duh!!  &nbsp;  Prospect: “No need lah.”  &nbsp;  I mean for a fact tt I know tt she did not need. But I need!!! Otherwise the role would haf been reversed. Bimbo!!  &nbsp;  Prospect: “I'm meetin' my frenz. Late already. Sorry.”  &nbsp;  WiNg: “Wat time?”  &nbsp;  Then she would frantically tink of a suitable time juz to get off the hook. Some would even look at their hands even though they did not wear any watches. So comical! HahaX.  &nbsp;  A few of them are even more extreme. Upon detectin' surveyors in the vicinity, they would make a detour to I-haf-no-idea-where. I haf even witnessed one of them went crashin' into a pillar!! bWahahaX!! Serves them right!!  &nbsp;  As a responsible citizen of Singapore, Sumtimes I might warn them, “Miss dun walk so fast hor, later fall down not nice. I'm not gg to ask u anyway.”  &nbsp;  Keke!! This would almost certainly slow their pace down,humiliate and make them embarrassed of wat they've done.  &nbsp;  I'm sure moz of u out there muz be guilty of any one of these acts rite? Dun pretend pretend hor. If u really dun wanna do the survey, no one will force u to do!! Simply smile and say “I'm sorry, no thanx.” Izzit too hard to ask of u?? U guyz ought to do sum soul-searchin'. Keke!!  &nbsp;  On the other spectrum, kind souls still exist. These are the pple who really make ur day and even if&nbsp;they walk away wifout takin' up any policy, I would still appreciate their attention.  &nbsp;  The bottom-line is, while many pple are skeptical of financial plannin' products (in fact, most would pass it off as insurance. No big deal.), there is a profound knowledge embedded.&nbsp;Financial&nbsp;plannin'&nbsp;is no longer&nbsp; used&nbsp;exclusively for protection purposes (aka insurance) onli. It can be used as an investment vehicle as well as aid u in ur savin'. Everyone needs financial plannin' and it's always better to start young. All of us know; few practise.  &nbsp;  I remember when I was abt to graduate, I told myself (&amp; sum other pple whom I can't seem to recall who... stm striles again.. Hee!) tt I'm gg to do a financial review once I found a job. I've already had&nbsp;an agent in mind and she is none other than Meiqing!! &nbsp;  As fate dictates, I became her colleague. Not @ all coincidental cosiderin' the fact tt I went to her (now oso mine) agency 2 yrs back. I guess whatever tt is destined would become reality. There's no escape.&nbsp;It's juz a matter of time. Soundz scary man.  &nbsp;  Does it appear as if I'm tryin' to offer my svc here?? Dun try to speculate any longer lah. I AM!! But dun come to mi 'coz u wanna support mi. I dun need monetary support. Approach mi if u feel tt u need to do sum plannin' for ur future (which means all u pple out there) and u trust tt I will handle it professionally &amp; diligently.  &nbsp;  In the meantime, thanx to all who haf showed mi moral support when u were informed tt I've decided to pursue this career. I won't name who. U know who u r. Thanx lotZ!!!  MuackZ !!!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;
