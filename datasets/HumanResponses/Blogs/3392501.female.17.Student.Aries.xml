      School's finally out for the summer. Yay! However I won't get too far away from my teachers because of marching band. Ugh! But Im excited about trying something new.  I did something really wicked last night. She deserves it tho. My mortal enemy. That bitch who has nothing else to do than to cut me down when we haven't seen each other in two years. She so two-faced. She's always copied me since middle school too. It's so childish of her. Anyway, I have an OD and she does to. She's been posting all this nameless crap about me acting all "I'm so awesome" shit. I set my diary to favorites could read only. A few days later she does the same thing. WTF? What a loser! ANywho, I hack in and find out her password. It was a really easy guess anyway. Lol. I consol my sempai and he teaches me how to handle this situation.  I deleted all of her entries, after I downloaded her whole diary to my hardrive. And left only one entry for her and her little friends (who can't decide for themselves who to be friends with) to read. "What goes around comes around, bitch" In the largest font they allowed and in yellow so it'll stand out the most. Then I got a fake e-mail and e-mailed her diary to her. That's how I deal justice. She doesn't have the internet at home so it'll take her a long time maybe to sign on.  I kno it's childish but it her fault for being this way. She just needed a taste of her own medicine. She just needs to get over herself and over her ideas. She's in quite a pickle I'll say. >)

      My nails are getting long, I need to either get rid of them or get a fill in. I spilt Sprite all over my keyboard a few weeks ago. Now it's starting to stick. I've been cleaning my room all day today. I dusted like one part of my room as well as the fan. Heh, I have so many trinkets in my room that I hate dusting cause it takes forever.  I took many books out of my bookcase. They were juvenile books. Now that I look at my newly recovated bookshelf, I need to start finding some good books and reading more. I like fantasy stories and romance. I kinda like Sweet Valley books, I only have a couple. I'm just a sap for romance. Lol. Also I read manga. I have collected all the SailorMoon and onegai! Teacher! and Chobits. I've started on Fruits Basket and Mahoromatic. My favorite writer lately has been Amelia Atwater-Rhodes. I love her outtake on vampries. She has such a great imagination. I smell food, but there is none. Are my sense playing tricks on me? *sigh* I'm so hungry. I'm going to be in the paper hopefully on being accepted to the Augusta Mall Fashin Board. I start my modeling training in July. I am so excited! Yay! Another volunteer job that I can add to my list. Mwa!

      Today was the beginning of exams...like I even studied for Algebra II. The worst skill to learn in high school is procrastination. And I have mastered it. Last night I went to see the Broadyway musical  Fosse  at the Bell. It was such an amazing experience. They were selling shirts and programs and eychains, mugs, magazines, pins, hats, etc. I stocked up! Not that many musicals sell merchandise at the Bell. (I made a RENT shirt. Fell thru though. ;_;)I had been looking toward this all season long! The dancers were almost flawless and the movements for every body part were spectacular. it just shows me again how big the world of dance is from the little Show Choir we have @ ST. Speaking of Show Choir, I heard that president was between Natalie and myself. And I saw the list and saw "President" beside Natalie's name. Of course she was best friends to the pres this past year so it's all about  who you know  not the talent. It really bugged me throughout the evening. However, I will choreograph my own dances (Fosse has really inspired me) and I will choreograph 3 numbers this summer not including the greatest idea to perform "Hey Ya." I will show them all. I'm not angry at Natalie or anything, it's just how she got there is what ticks me off like no other.  I had a date with Jack tonight. We went over to Berry's and Stephanie's house. There we ranted over the OD and made fun of one of my "ex"-friends. Long story. But it was hilarious hearing them talk. We hung out on the computer because they had all these cool black lights around. We watched a strange pantey obsessed anime called "Colorful," which was fairly odd but funny as hell.  Thank God! I finally fixed that damn virus on my profile on AIM. I just hope it stays. Here I'll recommend the service! http://www.jayloden.com/VirusClean.htm I checked around the site to besure it was a reliable source and it sure was. I am soooo happy that I do not have to get another screen name!  I miss Jack already. He was looking really good tonight in blue. It went good with his red hair. Hehe!  I'm tired. I really want to work on my ever so continuing Sailor Neptune scrapbook. It's pictures of accumulated pics of Neptune from Sailor Moon that I have collected for 6 years since my first year in middle school.  G'night all!

      This will be a place that I can come to to hopefully get away from school and review my days as I type away my life. This will be a place that I can rant and rave and become so love-struck it'll make you sick. This will be a place where I can talk about what I want and say what I wanna say. I want this to be a place that nobody I know will read this and become enlightened and understand that I am a person with my own morals and views and opinions. Kool beans. ^Stawberry_wine^
