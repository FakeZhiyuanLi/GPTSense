         friendship......lets look at that word and see what it meens, well it meens         trust        honesty        love         and prob more but i cant actually think of them, but basically i have about 4 friends that fit the job description and i really thought it was more....i cant trust anyone anymore they all bitch and why? I never did that to you, never stabbed you in the back and i wouldnt? Do you hate me that much that u have to keep stabbing?         You were my friends and what makes it worse you slag me off to my friends and your then so two faced about it! Only bitches do that to there friends and i dont really wanna talk to people who do that to me. Especially if we have been friends for so long.......I dont no what to say i feel numb, who do i trust now? Im so scared to trust anyone any more even those who wouldnt do that to me! I think the only one i can really trust is Abi and i love you so much for that!!! Although she doesnt no about this yet cause she has gone away and left me to face it all on my own!        I think actually that we have become very dependant on each uther now cause we both no that we wont get judged by one another and there is so much trust there! =D And yes i miss you so much baby!! Come home now! lol ok so you cant but still you will read this when u get back anyway so its ok, and also i no you already no i will miss you lol         Every girl is bitchy but its who your bitchy to thats the evil bit! Your evil to your friends and to the people who havnt done anything wrong. Do i have a kick me sign on my back? No? Well you might as well of put one there cause i no with or with out it, you would have knocked me down anyway and probably smiled as i fell! You cut me so deep............but its not the first and i will remain strong and, i promise you one day you will regret it, cause the only person who can make you feel inferier is your self and i will not weaken because you or anybody wants me to. Im stronger than you think...and also stronger than i thought.......        -x- My mind is strong, but my heart is weak-x-

        well tom has south england this week and he is playing okay i guess i have been a slight loner but neva ming. Im not gettin on well with the parents and the moment i just keep arguin with them (PMT 2004) majorly haha! especially my dad but im hoping that when we go to Spain everything will be ok again.           O u'll never guess what i did today? i dropped my phone down the toilet (clean water!) so its in the airing cuboard drying lol i was so worried as wel cause of my contacts (thats how sad i am!) but it was actually quite funny at the time though even for me and it was my phone! hahaha i just really wish i cud go and buy another one, but knowin my luck that wont happen!!          o and some bad news! Hawksi cant come down tomoz to Taunton to watch my brother play and i really want him tooooooo!! i need the company and the new sim card he has been kind enough to get for me (but i promise babes im noy using you just for the sim card!) although thats what you may think! well shame on you for thinkin so low of me!! Hmmm =D          I leave for Spain Friday and i cant wait its going to be so hot and i am really looking forward to it!! Although the sad thing is that the guy i met out there Alex (so fit!!) well he wont be there cause he is leavin the day i arrive and its so annoying, although probably for the best cause my family will be there and stuff. I was thinkin about it though and cause we own are place there now and cause Alex visits every summer all summer i will probably see him again next year! Or i hope to anyway he was really sweet!! Probably very over rated but yeh.           I had a dream last night and basically i was with like a group of friends and i was riting on this bored and i got told off and then i left my bag there and they has a go at me then Will appeared at the train station and he helped me look for my bag like really helped lol then i got it back and then it liked jumped scenes and there were loads of ppl at my house havin a massive, huge photo with me and Will was there again and ppl who i hadnt seen 4 ages were there and they were appariantly all there to tell me i got in to England for Hockey and i didnt no! lol and then i was at a hockey club buying a hockey stick.     Then the dream ended! hahahaha isnt that so random! lol =D          God that was such a random entry ooo and speaking of God he isnt very nice to me at the moment. I prayed two nights in a row amd he hasnt helped me at all. What have i done wrong?           -x-so many unanswered questions yet with one result....children-x-          P.S i have changed the font cause i so needed a change and i kinda like this one it flows better and i enjoy seeing it come up on screen as i type!!! hahahahaha =D

         i think in fact that for the time being negativity has taken over mi body causing any thought or movement to be slow and depressing! and i have decided that being positive only happens wat once a year...lol hmmm i can see the funny side to mi lazyness then i also get reminded of all the shit times i went through and pray that its not getting bk to that.           I dont really bother with mi family i just shut mi self away in my room watchin tv and pigging out on food! and when like my mum tells me that all i do it sit in my room i do feel bad but still i do nuthing to change the situation....im quite stubborn when it comes down to it actually. I also hate being wrong especially with Abi cause she always gloats when she is right so that makes it worse. haha but i luv her anyway!!!! =D          Also seen as im on a random high here, on the profile thing on here they asked me a question it was: Lionesses have no manes. How do they know when they've grown up? and me being a very sick person wrote: they have pubic hair!          now i think personally that shows something about my personality and although funny should be sumthing i must try and stop, so i wll let u no how that goes.          As i said last night i feel like second best well yeh woke up feeling the same but Pellie left me a comment and made me feel so much better, she has that sorta power i think! or she just no's me well, but yeh going to Tellies tonight so that shud be good and maybe if i turn my phone off for long enough i will become invisible again.......           -x-do you think the furniture dissapears when you turn off the light?-x-

         o god why is it all so confusing!!!!! fuckin shit i tell u thats what life is. But it also has its brilliant moments and a very wonderful and sexy person lol has reminded me. Tellie i love you, we always seem to understand each uther! tomoz im going to hers and i cant wait cause we can just talk about everything.......      lord make me invisible so no one can get to me so no one can upset me or make me laugh. I wish to be enlightend to have an understanding of everything so when shit happens or when sumthing good happens i understand why it happens to me......      life is just one shit afta another all u ca do is keep clearing it up, cause the longer u leave it the worse it smells!       i always feel like im not good enough for any one like im ok but then u can always see better and people find it just so easy to drop me..just like that! im not good enough for any bloody one. Not preety enough, not perfect enough, bum to wobbly, tits to small!! there is always someone with it all and people always seem to see through me......like im the 1st they see and they think its great then they meet like one of my friends and i just become a memory to them until they relise that the friend is to good and relise im all they can get......fuck the lot of them...i think i would prefer to be a lonely bitch than to always feel im second best to the world.....i dont think there is actually any one who understand me anymore =(          -x- let me be your memory-x-

         Ok so im back...well thats not exactly my fault its just sometimes i get these urges to write lol sad i no...well this morning i just sat on the sofa eating loads spoke to hawksi he is such a sweetie he is like sorting me out with a new sim card and stuff cause i neva have credit =) he is so good to me haha!!             *Bill text me today, i think he was trying to tell me he still liked me and i really like him so im kinda confused lol but i no nuthin will happen cause when eva something does it doesnt work although crazy for each uther at the time, others could never be happy for us and it just led to so many complications that both of us didnt actually need but still yeh lol as i said before things are always confusin in my world....also im starting to believe mi mate eddie that im a very complexed person!! lol funny times =D    (*names have been changed to prevent, more confusion, more questions and broken hearts!!)          -x- i wish i wasnt in luv with you so u cudnt hurt me - x-

         well i wudnt say this is the first blog i have written, but the last one i did became so personal. Well maybe thats cause that was my life at the time "personal"but i felt it was the easiest way to tell people that i cared about exactly how i felt. This blog will prob get just as personal but o well.......      secondly at the moment i feel like everythin that i do just seems to be wrong like in the last 6 munths i have had such a shit time with friends and stuff, so when i am with certain friends like my out side skool ones there are still ppl who arent happy with me they think that i have all my friends around my little finger and i really dont. They are ppl i luv and appreciate but thats appariantly not what it seems to some ppl.       why do things have to be so confusing 4 me. Im 14 i shud be invisible to everything and sometimes u no i am!! if i turn mi phone off for an hr no one can reach me and i feel like i cant get upset or worried...i luv it!!!
