       It happened again...i was as usual utterly confused. I was in that Shakespearean dilemna...to blog or not to blog...  whats the heck all this about. what am i going to get...? royalty? a raise in my salary? invites for blind dates? a blog doesnt seem to help me on any of the above...  forget any benefit....who will notice this little place of mine in this galaxy of blogs....? for all the time i will be spending in front of my laptop posting some insane ramblings here,  i  will be as good as the author of  "terms and agreements" document you see on an online registration form before clicking "I agree" button....no one cares to read you see...and worse, i wont be paid for even.    If no one reads them, what point in this verbal masturbation....???  but hey, the doctors say its a healthy practice...and some thing inside me prompts me to continue...Writing after all, has been the only love of mine that could withstand my rather overly passionate emotional ejaculations for such a long time.     And its only the second day in the life of my blog...let me keep it alive for some more time...and see if i can make it one of the brighter stars in this galaxy!!!

This makes me more excited about continuing this blog...the kind of feeling a software engineer trainee gets after delivering first bug fix and an appreciation mail from manager....!!!     Though i wont expect this hobby of mine to turn in to a big maintenance project, some thing inside me warns me against being over enhusiastic!!! Any way, let me enjoy it for the moment....!!!

       Here i am...at 1 in the morning, laying on my bed listening to a CD of classic oldies that my roomie just got. Not able to catch up some sleep and worrying about the early morning meeting i got tomorrow.    Not able to wake up early has been my incessant problem right from school days. What with this myth that early morning studies are more effective and concentration levels will be high. This has raked a havoc in my student life. Not that i really studied hard at any time...but things got worse after joining my junior college.       I joined a college in Vizag, where my uncle was a lecturer. He is an ardent believer in this waking up early theory and generally use to finish his breakfast by 4.30AM.    Massive efforts were launched to wake me up early and make me study. Two alarm clocks, those steel ones that produce high decibel rings were procured. And when i go to bed, these two monsters were made to sit on both sides of the pillow, with in touching distance of my ears. The alarms were adjusted in such a way that, once one alarm completes the ring, the other will start!!!    They scared me so much that i couldnt get any sleep at all. I use to stare at them till late in the night imagining them in the forms of various demons that i had read about in hindu mythology. Some times i use to dream of lord krishna coming back to earth and saving the mankind by destroying all the alarm clocks in the world.    One thing i forgot to mention was about my sleeping habits. God's grace bestowed on me such superhuman powers of sleeping. The effort required to wake me up was humungous. When ever i slept alone in the house, i had to sleep very near to a window with a long stick on the other side. If i have to wake up and open the door, it was only possible if some one pokes with that stick at me for a considerable amount of time.    With such sleeping skills, the alarm clocks were of no use. They use to ring for such a long time in the morning that they woke up everbody in our house and all neighbouring houses. But good god! I wont even move a bit. With increasing complaints from neighbours, my uncle stopped using these alarms. But Alas! that was no relief for me. He started using a mug full of water to wake me up in the morning!!!    I had to find new ways of escaping this trauma. With those splashes of water, i use to wake up only to find my self in a miserable state. After few days, i was struck with an idea. Complaining that it was very cold in the mornings, I started sitting in the kitchen saying its warm there. It was very cozy and with no one observing, i could happily snooze off with the book under my head.    It went well for few days untill one day when the boiling water on the stove has overflown and took my back as path to the ground. There were big boils on my back and i could easily bunk my college for 3 weeks.       People, thus ended those efforts to wake me up early. No one ever ventured again, atleast for academic purposes!!!       Enough of blogging for tonight.....now that i finished listening to the CD and with  even radio city playing songs that are best unheard, lemme switch the light off and get under covers.......!!!

        It can't get better...what a weekend it was! A perfect one. Packed with action, loads of fun and some unforgettable moments. A party, An outing on a river side, A journey on bus top, A trek that was terrifyingly adventurous, Yummy garlic bread & Pizza at jayanagar pizzahut, Three hours of badminton &amp; swimming and a ManU-Arsenal match to end with. No, i am not going to bore you people with details of all these things. But here are some of the things i learnt....      -If you are traveling on a bus top and the bus is stopped for a tea break, look around for monkeys before you get any eatables on the bus top. And once the monkeys have seen the food, never try to hide it unless you have special powers of surviving monkey bites.    -Before getting in to a river, check for red ants and other similar creatures that may get very intimate with you and gain access to certain parts of your body which even you can not see, smell or touch....    -Before climbing up a hill, make sure you know how to climb down!!! Mind you, mobile phones wont work on hill tops...and SOS calls are not of any use.    -This one is for girls. If you dont want to do some thing and every one around you is forcing you to do that, put up a tensed look and say aloud "I will cry!". This works. And I am the witness.    -And Guys, never go trekking wearing your low-raise jeans! High chances for some of the most sensitive body parts getting squeazed!!!    -Do not enter immediately in to a room just vacated by a bunch of girls after their make-up. Human noses are not meant to withstand the smell produced by a combination of various face creams, moisturisers, hair creams and nail polishes!!!    -Before making a dive in to the swimming pool, make sure your trunks are tight. Its not very easy pulling your trunks up while swimming in the 12 ft area!!!    And My God! whats this...a thorn in my finger. Remnant of the lot i picked on my Trek. Let me go and find a needle.......!!!

       My cousin sent me this link today...    http://acharya.iitm.ac.in/sanskrit/lessons/lessons.html     This is by some of the people in IIT Madras who have put in lot of effort to promote sanskrit. I got really inspired.  And they have put up all the slokas of Bhagavadgitha with their meanings in English. I chanced upon the following....   "Name Paarthasthi Karthavyam Thrishu Lokeshu Kimchana     Naanavaapthamavaapthavyam Varthe Yeva Cha Karmani"  There is nothing in all the three worlds that i need to do, nor is there anything worth attaining yet to be attained by me, Yet I engage in work - Lord Sri Krishna.       This one is for all the lazy people like me...Really explains the essence of work!!!   Finally i have some motivation to sit and code!!!

       It was my fault. I shouldn't have started from office when the rain has just stopped. That too when i have to cross the silk board junction and reach home. Silk Board junction in Bangalore has now become more famous and crowded than Times Square in Newyork. I knew it was going to be like that. But Alas! My hunger got better of my intellect.... And i got caught in the traffic jam.  My enticer was sandwitched between a monstrous truck and a college bus. A.P.S. college of engineering, it read. I raised my head and looked in...hoping to catch glimpse of some college chicks. Uff!!! no use...competes with the Atacama desert in dryness!!! Pitied those guys sitting in the bus.  This reminded me of my college bus in Hyderabad. It was a complete opposite situation. This college bus of mine started in my 2nd year BE. Bus number 6M/120 was converted in to Moulali HB colony - Ibrahimbagh college special. People started calling it "Tharnaka Special".  This bus route had all the beautiful girls, specially the first years. Me staying near the starting point of the bus, had the best chance of grabbing a place in the front rows...close to the girls... :) And with ragging strictly banned in college campus, the college bus was a god's gift!!! What else could give daily 2 hrs of un-controlled fun...!!! With the junior cuties doing what ever you want them to do...  All the guys in college wanted to travel in this bus only. We, "tharnaka special" guys have become the envy of guys in other routes. They all have started searching for rooms in this route. Rents for student accommodations zoomed up in this route...!!!  We enjoyed this journey for the next two years also. Thats something quiet unforgettable. I made so many friends, read so many books and more than that had so much fun. All, Thanx to the "tharnaka special".  Sorry for digressing. Bored you people with this nostalgia of mine. But nothing sweeter than college life....Ohhoyyy....me again!!! Let me stop here and not go in to that nostalgic mood again....!!!

       After an action packed weekend last week, this time it was quite a lazy one. Most of it was spent before the Idiot box. Of late, my weekends have become so hectic with things like swimming, badminton etc...that i watched very little of television. But this weekend gave me some updates on whats happening on the small screen!!!    For example, i came to know that Telugu television is following it's film industry and importing female anchors from other states. I was watching one of those "top 10..." programs, and was trying to figure out whats this "Shit...Rum" the Anchor was refering to!!! Though not an expert on alcohol, i am sure i never heard about this variey of Rum. Also it appeared too much against logic that any one would name a product as shit. After much analysis and thought process we deduced that what she meant was  "Chithram",  that means movie in telugu. God save my mothertongue!!!    English premier league started again and Arsenal began with a bang 4-1 win over Everton. But Man U disappointed with a 0-1 lose to chelsea. I am waiting for too long and its time the red devils rejuvenate themselves!!!    Apart from this, i also learnt why gals always get a drop from guys where ever they go. I always thought, it was only for the pleasure of riding bike with a pretty thing on the back. But now i know how difficult it is to explain directions to a girl!!! It will take much less time , effort and even money to take them than explaining them how to go!!!    Thats about weekend activities people, and its time i consider sleeping now. As it is, a Monday morning is already waiting for me... :(     As of now, lemme say good night to Mohd.Rafi and try catch some sleep......!!!
