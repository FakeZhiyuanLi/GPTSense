						   These days I feel lucky because I can get home earlier than before. At least by the time 8:PM I leave my office and go home.  When I think of my body and mental health, it's definitely a good thing. Overtime working threatens man's health, especially mentally. I know about it, but I can't say that I'm totally happy.  To be exact, I feel a little hesitated to leave office early. Because most of my colleagues and my boss are still working there.  My boss once told me that  " you should help your colleagues when you're not busy."   Usually I try to do so. They never force me, they say  "you should get home early if you think you can".   And finally I decide to get home, saying to myself that "That's all for today. My task is going on schedule. Overtime working produces another costs for the company, so I don't have to be here."  I'm disappointed what a coward guy I am. It's good to go home early, but...  Can anyone cause blackout in my office at 6PM every weekdays?

						   These days I come to think about the sense of "busy".  Personally, I don't like the word because it's normally a sign of refusal. (In other words, it's useful to use if you want to refuse something.)  But these days I think "busy" has two meanings.(Of course it's just my understanding.) One is physical, and the other is mental. For example, I worked 9:30AM-11:30PM last month, culcurated overtime was over 130 hours. But I didn't feel busy, physically very busy though.  I think "physically" busy is ok, sometimes it could be a good reason to refuse, or sometimes it would be a good word to describe your situation.  But I think "mentally" busy is dangerous. Mentally busy makes a person mad, dipressed, frustrated, or sometimes crazy. It's clear that mentally busy is not good for your mental health.  It could be said that I'm happy because I'm not "mentally" busy in spite of such an incredible overtime-working. But if I were, I think I couldn't stand it.  For deeper understanding, tell me what you think about it.
