       flying high, and life is good. and prolly will continue to be until 5:30 am, at which point i will hate everyone. =) man...considering what mood swings are engendered by too much caffeine/ephedrine/lack of sleep, it's no wonder that my evil ex was so incredibly evil. i think he had a different drug for nearly every day of the week...pot, meth, coke, opium, others...he was not a happy camper whenever he came down. innocent little me, i thought i was doing something to make him crazy.   at least when i'm caffeine-binging before deadlines, i hide my evil troll-self from other people.    &nbsp;  i just saw the funniest orbitz commercial ever. it's the one with the japanese martial arts competition. watch the little kid's face when his mom puts her hands over his ears. utterly priceless. good commercialz are so rare these dayz.

       i really really shouldn't have to call customer service more than once to get a straight answer. the cs reps should not get stoned before coming to work and give me the wrong information, such as "the server shouldn't be down for much longer" when the answer is actually "the server will be down til at least sunday." bitches.&nbsp; i'm so getting cable.    &nbsp;  so...i want a new car. already. somebody so needs to teach me how to drive stick...i lurv me car, but now i want to go faster. oh the humanity... never never satisfied...i so need to get outta skool and make money...    &nbsp;  by the way, for those of you who complained about tha utter cheesiness of my last post - you weren't there. u'd understand if u were. y'all can blow me.    &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;

       ahhh....what a great day hanging out with my not-quite-gay friend! just a gorgeous lazy day where i stopped worrying about skool and opp. cute little mediterranean restaurant; then to south coast, where i haven't been in years! got tha cutest shoes too. unbelievable: my guy frien' has such the great fashion advice, and he's mostly straight! then we went cruising down pch in true summer tradition, 'cept it was nice to have a friend along for once. went swimming at corona del mar...the water was great (altho it woulda been better if i could stop worrying about the sharks) and got a workout...then just lying on the sand, watching the long light shafting thru tha palm trees, the golden sand cupping the bright curve of light, rays shaking out across the blue water, out to the end of the world where the brilliantly blazing misty haze is being slowly blanketed by the azure dome...there is no place more beautiful than south oc beaches at sunset.   the long light shakes across the lakes  and the wild cataract leaps in glory  --tennyson   remember:  i'm either getting paid or i'm getting laid...while i'm chasing one, the other's gettin away...  - dialated peeples feat kanye west

       Yep, 4:15 the same morning aaaaaand i'm back.&nbsp; Just one comment 'bout dems. K, maybe 2. Back when i was politico-staff, i met one of the&nbsp;staffers for a prominent SoCal dem House Rep. This genius got up in a meeting and expounded on how war is a naughty sneaky vehicle for racism. His boss, sez he, is way concerned cuz of "the disproportionate number of latino-americans that will be sent to war." Funny - i missed the memo where we reinstated the draft. To apply to minorities. Also, my all-time fave Congresswoman, Barbara Lee (CA 9th, Bay Area)&nbsp;besides being the  only  Member to vote against retaliation&nbsp;against Al Qaeda immediately after 9/11,&nbsp;had this to say&nbsp;when asked about Iraq: "War is always bad, because&nbsp;the children die." (And I'm kind of paraphrasing, cuz&nbsp;I don't remember her exact wording, but that was basically it, guys.)   &nbsp;   Wow.   &nbsp;   Note:&nbsp;I only bash dems cuz it'z like shootin fish in a barrel. That being said, it also makes me feel better about myself because i have, like, one other reep friend. All tha rest&nbsp;are dems. My bestest friend, bless her traitorous heart, workz fer tha DNC.      &nbsp;   Oh yeah - on tha flip side, Orrin Hatch iz beginning to closely resemble the second cousin of the AntiChrist.

       please see title.    &nbsp;  with that said and done...i gotta tell ya, it'z rough bein tha three musketeerz when two of tha m's decide to shack up. even tougher when they're throwing chairs at each other. whoops, that was a revert to freshman year. for further definition, see: dormcest. kehehe. i'm scarred fer life.&nbsp;ah, college - so long ago! all of 2 years, but i think i'm goin thru&nbsp;dat quarter-life crisis peepz keep on talkin 'bout. y'kno. when ur middle-aged, it's&nbsp;maybe not so bad: u realize where u are, n' there's certain things holdin u in place, so u can say: "it's not my choice to be here. i'll gracefully relinquish&nbsp;thoughts of&nbsp;'could have been' and accept&nbsp;my life, and be happy in it." However, at tha quarter-life, it'z "oh god it'z rite here where i'm either gon'&nbsp;make my life or i'm gon' be a miserable worthless sack of *!%$ foreva." This iz tha point in our livez, kiddies, where u realize dat even if u da shit, dere'z someone out dere who'z gon' be more da shit den u are. so u gotta decide: should i be a good li'l law student (even tho my frienz scored 178 on the lsat and i didn't), or should i follow tha dream and write and sing (even tho i ain't even close to tha best singer/writer i kno, let alone out there)? it'z a helluva trauma to suddenly not be tha best. but u kno what? it makez u realize just how very important it is, at that point, to be a decent person. utterly hate quoting cheezy movie linez, but this one really opened my eyes, even tho it should be obvious: "It's not our abilities, Harry, that make us who we are: it's the choices we make." And so: judging yourself by your raw ability, mediocre or not, is a fool's game. It's like judging yourself by the color of your skin. IT IS SOMETHING THAT WE CAN'T CHANGE. So cut yourself some slack. It's what you do with your abilities, and who you touch. That's what's important in life, cuz ultimately that is what makes a difference and what lasts, cuz not much else does, lemme tell ya. Acourse, if you're me, and have minimal social skillz, and sometimes can barely tolerate people even while still needing them to function in a human way, i'd say yep: time to panic. ;) j/k. but IMHO strong friendship connections are things that are truly valuable when they last, and age like fine wine - the older u get, tha harder it iz to meet new people u kno u can trust close to you and yours. too bad fer lazy peepz like me, maintaining connection way harder'n jes' meetin new people...    &nbsp;  current gripe: people who keep trying to speak jamaican to me. stop mauling tha language, people. (as if i should talk.) and, as always,  those bastardz ova at da CHP.  oh, it's just your job to give out tix? u kno u love it, assholes. hell'z too good fer u. may u rot in one of those demon dimensions where they shove pineapples up ur ass many times daily. (whoops, ok shout-out to adam sandler there, even tho he'z pretty lame lately.)    &nbsp;  current entrancement: los lonely boys! yes, they're on the radio, so now they're mainstream and useless. sue me, i'm a sellout. i even like their spanish stuff, e'en tho for all i kno dey singin da macarena. 'cept they don't say macarena. so dey prolly ain't singing dat. ok i think i'm done now.
