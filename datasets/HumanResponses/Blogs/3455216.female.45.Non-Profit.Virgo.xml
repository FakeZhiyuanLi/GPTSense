      Date: Monday, March 15, 2004  Hello everyone please read this when you can.  Take a break, grab a tissue and as always thanks in advance for ‘listening’.  Ok I’ve written Adrian’s Final Days as a prologue to Our Cancer Story.    It’s the section that's meant to give the most strength, but you might not get it without reading what’s to come, rather I should say ‘what happened 5 years ago’ when Adrian became a miracle cancer survivor.  These final days churned inside me yet it’s the hardest part to share.  But now on the 15th of March 2004, six months to the day and date Adrian died (where I can feel his death, and his love so clearly) it’s the ideal time for me to write of that inconceivable day where my beloved husband Adrian took his last peaceful breaths (thankful beyond belief for the peacefulness of the end).  The memories of the final hospital visit appear so clearly, as I listen to Coldplay sing (the disc that played continually in Adrian’s small hospital room and daily at home all spring during dinner).  “For me all the movements are starting to fade.”     How do you capture death?  It is a part of life, true (though fortunately we don’t see death that often).  From death life grows, well we do see that with the seasons (but give me a break!).  From death we learn (the hardest and deepest of life’s lessons) so much we didn’t want to know.  From death the earthquake ruptures continue for a lifetime (but surprisingly the love continues too grow too).    When the person you love stops breathing, albeit peacefully, when you are holding hands, and saying how deeply you love the person that’s dying, how could that not be intimately special?  How can that not also be terrifying, but it wasn’t, for some reason (though later it seemed too horrible to believe).    Was I a lucky person to be alive, to be holding the hand of my sweetheart rather than those poor families of Sept 11th who never got to say goodbye?  Those who had love taken so violently, well my peaceful goodbye felt oddly blissful only in comparison.     “Nobody said it was easy, it’s such a shame for us to part”  (that’s for sure) but  “nobody said it would be this hard”  (unbelievably difficult to say goodbye).  The lyrics again weave through my train of thought.  I hear Adrian talking to me, saying these exact words; I can even hear his voice.  I truly believe this music is Adrian’s spirit talking to me now from the ‘other side’.    Thinking back to Adrian right now on Monday the 15th at 11:30 am, serene as you can imagine (laying on the hospital bed, without the tubes to keep him alive).  Breathing as though he were snoring.   Snoring for his last occasion in his physical body.    His body that had crashed on him, which had completely let him down (though he continued to be such a pleasant man), that no longer allowed him to do things in life he enjoyed.  Adrian’s strong spirit and our deep love, kept him going longer than most people could’ve in a body that barely functioned.    There is one major thing I learned from 'Adrian' during those painful last moments (something that became clear, which I’ll share with you now, so you can easily disagree).    All living creatures are so much more than just a Body!    We are actually in a body combined with a Spirit (that's everlasting too) which inhabits that body.    In death our Spirit remains behind, "crosses over to the other side" you could say, to borrow a John Edward term, and stays with our loved ones still here on Earth.  Of that there is comfort, just so much comfort when a loved one dies too young.    And I feel Adrian’s spirit and love alive with me 6 months later and ever so strong.  He just wouldn’t have made it these extra 5 miracle years in his body if it weren’t for his good nature, amazingly strong spirit and the love we shared.    And then I hear the lyrics  “come on in, my star is fading, I’m swerving out of control, I’ve got to get up out of this hole”  and I feel as though Adrian is talking to me about how he felt as he lay dying, as his spirit came free from his physical body.    I can feel him lying peacefully on the hospital bed, while I held his hand and stroked his forehead.  I hear him saying, though he couldn’t talk while he was in the final coma,  “Kathy, I’m at peace, take care of Rebecca, I know you will, I love you.  You’ve given me so much happiness and love.  And you must know that my spirit will be here with you and Rebecca always” .    And in my heart I know that was going through his mind.  Oh my love, my heart breaks for you, my heart aches for us, but that is a physical ache.  I now realize your spirit is here in our home and with me always.    But if the rational part of me could know that you are ok, could keep getting signs that your spirit is by my side, then I could be comfortable with the feeling that we are together forever.  And in my most connected moments I know our love is linked eternally (in my non-connected times I’m angry at you for leaving us).  The words (whose words?)  “Parting is such sweet sorrow”  so aptly describes saying goodbye to Adrian, the love of my life.  And now I understand the depths of those words, as though the words themselves are crying.  And again I hear Adrian talking to me in the lyrics,  “I miss you, I miss you”  and despite this being difficult to write, it’s also cathartic for my distraught system.    Trying to deal with reality, trying to learn a new way to live, missing an essential limb, but learning to tune into the Spirit.  And then the lyrics that talk to me most, making me think of that small hospital room  “come on in, I've got to tell you what a state I'm in...”  and I vividly feel those last moments (it’s happening now, isn’t it?).  To understand the loss, and the surprising peacefulness that Adrian’s death brought, you must peek with me into the 12-day Virginia Mason hospital experience.  Please stop and grab a cup of decaf (or whatever you drink) and take a break from your daily life.  It would be important to me if you please (while your reading and living) make an extra effort to appreciate your loved ones.    On a warm fall Thursday afternoon in early September, Adrian in horrible condition was transferred from Group Health Eastside (GH, where he'd been for 3 days, getting quickly worse) to Virginia Mason (VM, that had more specialty care).    This would turn out to be his last ambulance ride.  The terrific doctor on duty (the end of a weekly rotation), a strong middle-aged woman, eager to get information from me that she couldn’t read in the lengthy reports sent from GH.  But Adrian, in a ghastly state when he arrived around 1 pm, didn’t even know what was happening; he had retreated to an altered consciousness that happens when your body is experiencing too much continued pain.    The nurses said that his feverish condition, his excruciating pain, bruised body, and toxic blood were the worst they’d seen in a middle-aged patient (and these were well-trained older nurses).  To simplify it was beyond terrifying to see Adrian’s awful circumstances.    The memory is so scary (yet strangely comforting as it was the last days of Adrian’s life), and very difficult to put to words.  The situation seemed so terrible and to make matters worse Adrian was having trouble breathing (gasping and gulping for air), and horribly his mouth (and his whole body) was bleeding.    But it was so difficult because we couldn’t give him water (the likelihood of needing the respirator later in the night).  That period before the respirator is so horrendous with the discomfort and continual gasping for oxygen.  That was by far the 'worst' of the final days.  In addition to his full body bruising and bleeding mouth, he couldn’t bear to be touched (because of the bruises and the not yet diagnosed cancer). I’ve never in my life been so scared (having a gun held to my head in college, nothing!).  Seeing my most beloved suffering like that was like an 7.5 earthquake shaking below my feet and destroying the very ground I ‘barely’ stood on (literally it often felt as if the floor itself were caving in).  I can still remember the doctor getting tears in her eyes (how often does that happen?) while we looked at the x-rays and planned a battery of tests and treatment plan.  I felt brave, we had done this 5 years ago, and a person had to be stronger after 5 wonderful years, right?  (Well if I felt so brave, why was I desperately holding onto my reeling sides?).  Besides if I didn’t try to isolate the facts, and make sure things were being done right for Adrian, well then I would’ve ended up collapsing to the ground and falling apart like a hysterical person.  And there were just too many details to keep straight, that it really wasn’t an option for me to become a screaming banshee, not even late at night or in traffic.    ‘My’ treatment plan was to stay as calm as possible and make sure everything was being done right on behalf of Adrian (and hence our life together).   Certainly my calm attitude was a major change from 5 years ago, one of many positive changes that happened as a result of being a cancer survivor (but who needs that kind of shit to be strong, I could be strong with out it).  Well that first Thursday night after I got the call around 8 pm requesting permission to put Adrian on the breathing tube, I felt an enormous relief (which is a treasured feeling when the world is spinning out of control).  I mean the poor guy couldn’t breathe and was so uncomfortable; anything to sedate him, I knew would make him happy, even if it would hurt and make it harder to swallow later.  I also took solace in the fact that he had survived life support 5 years ago; I told myself “he can easily survive this hurdle again.”  I innocently believed recovering from the breathing tube was something he had conquered once and could do again.   Especially since he just lived through the extra 5 really good years after battling cancer and he had a fantastic relationship with Rebecca, how could he not have the ability to fight back?  Didn’t all the love we shared give him additional strength to do the impossible a second time?  Little did I know that his body had fought longer than most humans could have, he was really at the end, and his body was completely used up.  Friday moved along slowly with Adrian sedated on the breathing tube and I felt gratefully calm, as though there was a chance to recover, to breathe and rest.  Over the weekend Adrian showed some steady improvement while he remained thankfully under a golden haze of powerful drugs.   On Monday as they tried waking him up from the heavy medications (in order to get the breathing tube out), they encountered problems.  He skidded downhill quickly with sweaty high fevers and increasingly toxic blood.    Tuesday was our 14th anniversary (even then I felt grateful to be reminded of that special day and our love so true), and Adrian slowly woke from sedation in horrible pain and confusion.  It was so unfair to him (and honestly me too), I can now stomp my feet on the ground like an angry 6-year-old.    Remembering talking to Adrian, letting him hear my voice and calm him, but it seemed so futile, though my voice did steady the beeping monitor somewhat.  Adrian was so highly agitated it was stomach-churning scary; I kept gripping my sides as though I could squeeze away the fear (and assure myself of this awful reality).  Yet he showed me his true strength then, and I learned from him too as I had through all of our 14 married years together.  Thankfully Tuesday night the doctors agreed to put him back on “long term” sedation, and at the same time he slipped into a coma.  Again I felt relief wash over me at the thought of Adrian’s body being peaceful again.  How could you not separate from your body, when it was so flaking?     The coma, the only state Adrian could be in from that point forward, (his state of suspended relief) I could sense a greater peace about him.  This peace and feeling of love settled over his body, the energy so apparent upon entering the room.  He had given up on the most worthwhile fight of his life, and I believe he felt complete and peaceful for living a good life.  That energy I could feel from my home and upon entering his room.  And through the last tumultuous days I somehow stayed glued together, for Rebecca, to cope with the massive amount of information, to drive the 20 miles across the bridge to and from the hospital.  What if I had fallen apart and cried, hysterically like I probably needed to?  Then I would’ve missed so much about the care being given to Adrian but also I don’t think I would’ve heard what was in my heart.    Well somehow, though I did not think it possible, I found strength when I needed it most.  I mean who would have imagined me 20 years ago handling something like this with dare I say grace or dignity?  (I don't know about that?)  But somehow I stayed calm.  On the other side of the pendulum my eternal question has become: “How much did Adrian hear while in his coma?”  Since sound is the last sense to go, in my heart I believe (and hope more than anything) at some level Adrian heard me say how much I love him.    I do believe his spirit was present too giving us strength as he crossed over (just an unbearable situation). “Yes” some far more certain part of me shouts, “his spirit is still here with us”.  And somehow his spirit communicated the “I need to be free” feeling that was so powerful upon entering his room.    And it was that final Thursday I dramatically realized Adrian’s body would not make it, that this wasn’t an ordinary hospital visit.  After talking to Dr Lewis, and then the nurses, I realized that the newly diagnosed level of cancer  (T-cell Lymphoma) added an even greater complexity to an already enormous burden.  Despite the peaceful feeling in Adrian’s room, it slowly started dawning on me as I drove to the fitness center, worked out, and had a mini-meltdown in the parking lot (I started crying when someone pulled close to my car).    It dawned on me that we had to be realistic; there was no way on this earth, no miracle that would allow Adrian to survive this trauma to his body again (strong as I believe his spirit).  He was going to die very soon, I wrote in one of the last email updates, which prompted Martyn’s (Adrian’s brother) 6,000-mile flight to Seattle.    Most importantly I needed to find a way to make this easier for 6-year-old Rebecca.  Her and daddy were ever so close and had so much fun together.  I talked as much as she would listen about Daddy’s spirit being strong, but his body giving out.  She absorbed a lot really, kids are so intuitive, and my favorite comment became “so that means Daddy’s Spirit is on the school bus and at school with me?”  By his final Friday, Adrian’s body had completely crashed; overridden with cancer, he couldn’t tolerate dialysis (which can be pretty rough—all your blood essentially flowing out, through a machine and back in can do a number even on healthy people).  His body went into heart aneurysms when they tried to do anything to ‘help’ him.  There was a ‘do not resuscitate’ order, his doctors agreed that if his heart went, then the strongest part of his body had finally given out, it was time to let him go.    Friday night Dad and Nancy drove me to the hospital.  A second visit seemed like another chance to say my final private goodbyes.  The situation was so confusing; we thought he would die early that evening, then that night, then over the weekend, but he hung on. That Friday night at the hospital, I didn’t know if I should stay or go.  In hindsight it is one of the only times I wish I had stayed (I don’t wish for much these days, that’s a survival sort of thing).    At that exhausting and confusing time, I felt as though Adrian’s spirit had already separated from his body, and there was nothing I could do for his body by staying there, and after 30 some odd minutes of changing point of views, I decided it was best to leave (oh but part of me says why didn’t I stay there with your body, it was your body after all, and hold your hand, and listen to music with you, it was your body, just full of tubes and wires).   Somehow I needed to be strong and stay together during this uncertain period.  Martyn was arriving Saturday night (making the situation all to real) leaving his home Friday morning.  He traveled 6,000 miles from Guernsey to be there by Adrian’s side.   Martyn didn’t know what happened on Friday and how close to the end it was for Adrian, and I worried, actually I was one big knot.  I threw myself into therapeutically cleaning our house for a visitor (hadn’t been cleaned for over a month, before we left for Guernsey, a lifetime ago) and stepped away from the email updates.  Where once they were so helpful, at the end of Adrian’s life I had to be quiet and turn inward.  Well Adrian stayed alive for another sunrise, he knew really, always had an excellent sense of timing.  Sunday was the most emotional of all the hospital days.  How do I begin to convey the sense of solemn enormity?  We had a “family meeting” at noon planned with Dr Lewis (the oncologist was supposed to be there but the cancer was so far gone he didn’t show up).    In a solace room, with myself, Martyn, Sandi and Jeff there too thankfully.  The lights were low, the atmosphere thick with troubled and heavy hearts.  Determined to stay calm (maybe it was the book, Wrong Rooms, I’d just finished about someone who hysterically fell apart as soon as their loved one died?  I just could not let myself become a blathering fool, as I never would have stopped crying, but it was a natural sort of thing too).  My total focus was staying calm.    The doctors told Martyn that Adrian’s body had given out; a T-cell lymphatic cancer so severe over rode his system, it would be an injustice to even biopsy; there was no treatment, he was very close to death.  The fact that he couldn’t breathe, his organs didn’t work, his highly toxic blood was killing him, made keeping him alive inhumane.  What did Martyn want to do?  But Martyn had seen Adrian fight from the brink before and he had more unrealistic hope.  Really the question was posed to me, I “knew Adrian best, what would he want, what did he want?”   All eyes were turned to me, what did I say?  Gulp.  Well I knew the answer; Adrian did not want to live like a vegetable, which was one of those deep things we thankfully talked about over the years.  I believed he wanted us to continue on without him.  I knew he didn’t want to fight a cancer battle, with protracted time in the hospital and being sick.  He wanted quality of life, which we blissfully had for five years after his last cancer recovery.  He didn’t want to fight a battle that there was no chance of winning.  Better to have us all remember him as healthy and with us, rather than remember the last years as hospitals and sickness.  He had even recently pleaded, one night before the hospital experience started, after he had thrown up for the umpteenth time “please let me die” and he repeated this phrase.  At the time I thought he was being dramatic (he’d been through a lot over the years and never made that claim before), but no, this was his last wish.    I knew in my heart there was no way for his body to continue (though part of me desperately wanted a miracle turn around such as five years ago).  Yet I also knew Martyn was in shock, day seemed like night, he had traveled an exhausting rate.  I looked in Martyn’s eyes, and with as much kindness as I could muster, asked what he wanted to do with Adrian.  Everyone kept steering the question back to me, “it’s what you want Kathy, you know what Adrian would want”.  And because Adrian was such a pleasant and tolerant man, I knew we needed to give Martyn time, and give Adrian’s dying body one more try, hopeless as that seemed.  I authorized a ‘gentle’ dialysis run with a ‘do not resuscitate’ order (maybe his body would tolerate the needles, the shock, maybe his blood could get clean and maybe pigs could fly?).  I mean getting Adrian set up for a dialysis run seemed stupidity and cruelty at its finest.    That last Sunday, the thought of needlessly prolonging Adrian’s pain tore me up, very simply.  I was devastated, I felt horrified that I’d betrayed him.  I felt like we’d kept him alive beyond what was humane and far beyond anything he would want.  The thought of him lying wasted in the hospital room, totally connected to tubes, being kept alive by machines, just ripped me apart.  I was the most agitated I’d been in years, totally torn up.  The recent miracle five years evaporated like water in a desert.   “Come up to meet you, tell you I’m sorry, you don’t know how lovely you are”   is playing now, and I’m there on that Sunday.  The small hospital room (with ugly cream walls and a tiny window facing another complex; no amount of pictures and cards could warm the room) that housed Adrian’s body, so close to death, you could feel it from the hallway.    In the corridor, I sought out Dr Lewis and frantically told him   “I will not be there when it’s time to pull the breathing tube.  I want nothing more to do with this.  It’s just so horrible, and how can Adrian continue like this?  We are being so cruel to put Adrian’s body through another dialysis run when it won’t even do him any good.  Adrian’s suffering so and I don’t want him too and I won’t be there when he dies!”     To Dr Lewis’s credit he stayed calm, listened, and patiently told me what it would be like when we pulled Adrian’s breathing tube and let him die.  He talked to me calmly and in a comforting fashion.  There was to be a great deal of uncertainty, he emphasized we didn’t know ‘how’ things would happen or the ‘timing’.    Hospital time felt like a week for every minute and I felt as though time was moving in slow motion, with the minutes stretching through eternity.  Every minute seemed like interminable long days, time stood still, frozen.  I felt like I occupied some surreal place and time, where minutes stretched and filled with internal elongated horrible sobs.   “Come on in, I’ve got to tell you what a state I’m in”  and that’s what Adrian was trying to tell Martyn that long intense Sunday before Adrian died.  It’s what I’d heard Adrian saying to me over the last weeks at home and even on our trip to Guernsey.  It’s what I hear day after day as I listen to Adrian on this CD, talking to me through the music of Coldplay.    Sunday evening Martyn and I talked for hours as though we had some control about when Adrian would die, and what would be most humane treatment for someone you love who is already as good as dead.  We talked about what Adrian would want; I really think I had to convince Martyn of the right path, because Martyn had seen Adrian recover before.  But sadly Martyn had not been with us 5 years ago when Adrian learned to walk again and had to battle the ravaging effects of chemo on a body that already had 2 transplanted organs.  It was a tough battle, one that in my heart I knew Adrian did once, and that was enough.  We talked about things I hope you never have to discuss.  To make these decisions when it’s nature that has to flow its course is beyond ridiculous.  Yet somehow I found the strength to plow through the tidal waves of painful emotions.  I went to bed that Sunday so purely upset, feeling like someone was continually punching my gut.  The hours before Adrian’s death were such an awful and chilling time.  I awoke Monday morning with my period and some renewed inner strength. How was this possible given the intense situation?  Could period onset be this dramatic (never such a swift change from PMS to calm)?  By some means I felt the combination of Adrian’s and my spirit making me feel strong and capable.  Yes my hormones felt evened out, I felt level and able to deal with the death of my most beloved husband (though who is really ever able to deal with that day, what a sad joke!).  Yet as I woke, I clearly heard Adrian saying  “Kathy, set me free, I need you to set me free, I’m almost free of this body, I’ll be able to soar, and I’ll always be with you.”    And from somewhere, I have no idea where, I got strength to get up with my 6 am alarm that last day, shower (do all those things we take for granted that seemed a surreal effort) and speak out loud to the doctor my decision to  “remove Adrian’s breathing tube, remove him from life support” .  Intensely focused on calmly saying goodbye, that took an unbelievable amount of energy.  Very narrowly focused like a racehorse about to run her most important event.  If I allowed myself to wander, my thoughts would start  “it’s only 2 weeks since he entered the hospital and before our life seemed normal, not like it would end so quickly”.   Too terrifying to go there.  That mild Monday we arrived at the hospital around 11 am with such heavy hearts and a sense of the surreal.  The newly rotated doctor (who I didn’t have an easy familiarity with or any respect yet) walked us through “the procedure” again.  Very kind and gentle.  Lots of morphine.  They could not say how long Adrian would survive (hours or doubtfully days).  We left the room while the specialist took out Adrian’s breathing tube.    Time stopped (how could life be moving in the hallway when my love was on his death bed?) and I stood there uncontrollably shaking. I observed and tried to write in my notebook (I needed to ‘document’ the moment, I needed to ‘survive’ the moment and writing helped me somehow cope).  We got the word to come back into Adrian’s room.  I felt those stomach punches going insistently.  The nurse gave Adrian another morphine shot, and took the rest of his IV’s out.  It was the first time in 2 weeks (what seemed like 2 years in slow motion hospital time) that I’d seen Adrian without tubes in his body.  This was finally the Adrian I knew and loved, well the body of the man I loved, with his spirit hovering.  And he peacefully slept.  He snored, I held his hand, the music played, time stopped, I stroked his head, I told him how much I loved him.  The moments were intimately poignant.  Martyn was saying something I didn’t feel right about, “you’ll be ok” but it didn’t matter as long as I could hold Adrian’s hand and tell him I loved him.  When Martyn left the room to give us time, you could literally feel the bliss of our wonderful lives together.  And what I felt most strongly was the love, the love that we shared, and the love that could never die (I never knew love doesn’t die, that’s something else I’ve learned).  From 11:30 am when I stopped writing to 12:30 pm, I held Adrian’s hand, stroked his head, and told him how much I loved him.   That hour in the hospital was equivalent to a year in real life.  I didn’t break down, I didn’t scream “please don’t leave me, I can’t live without you”.  And do you know what, I didn’t consciously think of ‘not crying’ or ‘not getting hysterical’.    I suppose I could’ve screamed and gotten frantic, but I didn’t (which was out of character if I’m to be honest).  In retrospect I went in there with all I had, to be present in the moment, and ‘loosing it’ would’ve distracted me from being with Adrian.  And in looking back I’m so grateful that I didn’t fall apart, and I’ve the feeling that Adrian is eternally thankful too.  I repeated to Adrian, “I love you, I’ll always love you”.  I felt his peacefulness; I can still feel that peace about him months later.  Despite our bleak surroundings, I felt like all the mornings we had lain together, the mornings I had woken in his comforting arms, the many mornings we had intimately talked.  It felt like he was just sleeping (sans the beard that was shaved to make the vent easier) and we would be together for eternity (oh that comfortable good feeling I used to experience daily).    In reality his body had been letting go, but surprisingly I felt our souls would be together forever, I could feel that clear as day.  His last breaths were so peaceful; I could honestly sense his quiet loving spirit filling the room.  The part of me that thankfully surfaced days later, yelled “don’t go, Adrian I love you, please don’t go, I can’t live with out you!”    And by the time he took his last breath on earth in this life, we knew.  His heart rate had slowed to almost nothing, then gradually stopped.  I kissed Adrian’s lips one last time, then Martyn came to my side of the bed and we hugged and shed more tears.   My beloved husband had been such a pillar of strength, despite a body that repeatedly gave out, and such a remarkable man.  Once Adrian died, I did not want to be in the room anymore.  Lying there in the bed wasn’t the Adrian I knew, though it was his body (I’ve since learned of people who could not leave the room and their loved one’s body).  But his body was without life, without the essence of Adrian.  Adrian’s spirit though embraced us and moved us gently out the door.   I still needed to leave 7th floor CCU, but the business of disposing of a body takes effort and work and people.  As we stood in the hallway waiting to sign papers, why didn’t I go back in the room to hug Adrian’s body one more time?  One of my many unanswered questions.  The rest of the day was surreal, making phone calls, telling Rebecca (a whole other full story).  I loved Adrian so much, and this too I learned: Love keeps growing, despite the death of a body.  And there is comfort in this.    And simply I could feel Adrian’s Spirit finally free from his body, and his spirit was free to live on and be in our hearts and memories, forever.  If you listen to your heart, you might feel the spirits that are guiding you too.  We all have them with us.  If you are fortunate, one especially strong spirit is the love of your life, as mine is.  My husband Adrian was such a remarkable man, my light and my love and my inspiration.  I remain the luckiest woman alive to have been there and shared the last full 16 years of his life.    And I suppose in the process of one of the worst experiences of my life, it was all part of the plan.  Everything that happened makes sense and fits.  I even managed to develop some respect for myself for surviving in a calm and dignified manner (believe me, I never thought that possible).    And now I realize death is only the end of a life, not the end of a connection.  The spirit of our loved ones is here forever.  Listen and you can hear and see the signs.    To end with a laugh, as Adrian would want, hmmmm, that’s for you Adrian my love (I finally get to be as corny as I want, and don’t need to wash the bathroom rugs as much).  Life can be good again but I’ll always have a huge hole in my heart for you.  But you gave me so many gifts, our love keeps growing.  The gifts, remember and think of the memories.  Thanks so much for letting me share, helpful beyond belief. Thanks for reading.  Any feedback would help me in my healing.  What did you feel after reading this? Love and hugs to all, Kathy

      This is 'Our Cancer Story' blog.  It mostly happened 5 years ago and starts in Sept '98.  This blog includes my daily email updates in 1998 from when my beloved husband (Adrian, died Sept 15th, 2003) went through cancer, and really recovered!    I wrote the emails to connect with friends at the end of crazy and difficult hospital days (10 weeks worth) that made no sense.  I wrote so I wouldnt feel so alone and terrified.  As I wrote and got feedback I'd feel better (which was an amazing thing in the midst of cancer terror).  Now I want to share our story to help others.  Actually my husband Adrian inspired me to compile these, so he wants 'us' to share this with you.  I've decided to do this with a blog, though my original intent was to publish a book.  Now that I'm dealing with grief, all my actions are slowed.  But I want 'our story' to help others.  Adrian wanted his story to help others too, if it could (we were both to modest to think it really could).  As brave as Adrian was, it all happened so fast.  What's most important?  To appreciate your time with your loved ones.  This is dedicated to my beloved husband, Adrian (49 years old, a British engineer living 6,000 miles from home in the Channel Islands, pleasantly married for 14 years, battle against juvenile diabetes for 30 years, transplant and cancer survivor), who was my love, light and inspiration.  Thankfully his spirit of strength, courage and love are still here with us, despite his crossing over.  If you are taking the time out of your busy life to read this, thank you!    Please tell me what you think.  Does our story help other people?  Let me know what you think, please.  Also go ahead and pass this along.  Thanks Kathy G

      On this Memorial Day I feel that Adrian died in a battle like the soldiers we’re honoring.  Adrian’s battle against his body was one in which he fought hard, was brave beyond belief and he won for a short time.  He survived cancer for an extra 5 years, I’m so grateful for that!  Nice 3-day weekend here in rainy Seattle (that meant no yard work for me--good, and throwing balls in the mud to Harry--bad).  Not many dreams of Adrian, but Rebecca and I have actually had fun together!  So in that respect he's with us.  Saturday she got to have her friend Holly for a sleepover.   We built the tent Adrian got last year (frustratingly hard to put together, but I couldn't get too mad, because the tent was a gift from Adrian).    Rebecca also got to eat her favorite Sunday dinner: Tuna Noodle Casserole (blech) that she made herself!  She was a happy camper.  And she stayed up late like  “daddy used to”.    At our neighborhood garage sale this weekend (lots of memories from the hard work and togetherness of the past). Rebecca found a $4 pokemon cartridge and she’s delighted (phew).  Going today to buy some lego’s: “hard, age 8+ over 500 pieces.”  She’s been itching to build something.  Adrian was right after all: the way to her heart is toys and food (bah wah).  I’m thinking a lot of “5 years ago at this time we were in Hawaii, on our favorite island: Kauai, in our favorite elegant splurge hotel The Princeville".  A wonderful trip to celebrate Adrian recovering from cancer though he had just finished chemo, barely walking with a cane and weighing in at 50 pounds less than at his death”.  Really good memories though.  Thank you for reading.  I’m surviving somehow!  What do you think? Kathy G

      Ok no Adrian dreams last night (Thursday) but somewhat calmer today (thankfully).  It's mostly related to the good news that Rebecca doesn't have to do homework (for the next 3 weeks anyways) at home!  That's a huge relief to me, and really takes some self-imposed weights off my shoulders!  Had a talk with Rebecca's 2nd grade teacher (he is great, wow are we lucky!)  She is doing well today, and can do her homework at school (oh did I mention that's a huge relief).  Clearly if I'm happy and fun with her, she does better.  So I have to be less like my natural self (i.e less mean, less strict, more light hearted-- wait that's Adrian)!  Mr Logozzo also said it's good that Rebecca is finally expressing that she is angry with daddy for leaving her.  Well I'm just so broken hearted that she even has to go through these grief and loss feelings.  I'm going to try to be grateful that Adrian was a 5 year cancer survivor, we had 5 whole years.  At least Rebecca had such good time with him over that time, right? Thanks, Kathy

      Just in, email from MoveOn.org.  It's about time that somebody with influence (Gore) said this in a recent speech:  "The unpleasant truth is that President Bush's utter incompetence has made the world a far more dangerous place and dramatically increased the threat of terrorism against the United States."  I totally agree.  I always think of Adrian when I read true anti-Bush statements.  I miss our heated conversations about Bush being such a dork.  My strong opinion, we didn't need to go to war in Iraq!  Esp a war that the US President started!  Possibly the worst president in history, who's done horrible damage globally.  If Kerry doesn't win, I'm moving!  Kathy

      The only dream I had of Adrian last night was about him being mad at me!  He left me a cell message that I was too mean and he was leaving.  Then his car was stolen, gone and I had no way home.  So I awoke devistated that it's been 8 months and he's still gone.  My 7 year old daughter is making me nuts.  For spelling homework she didn't want to write the words.  Last night it took me 15 minutes to convince her to practice writing the words and she could’ve been done in the time she fought me!  Then her school project is doing butterfly research on-line (she loves butterflies).  But she thinks 'writing facts is stupid’ and she doesn’t like using the computer (which must be related to missing Daddy, she spent much time with him at our computer, I think it makes her too sad).    Last night Rebecca threw things and was mean to the dog.  I want my beloved husband back.  Our miracle 5 years as a cancer survivor have disappeared like a dream.  I'm frustrated today. Thanks for reading.  Kathy

      This is my first blog entry.  Very exciting.  Dreaming is my key to survival these last 8 months, but this morning I came up empty.    I've been dreaming that my husband (passed away September 15, 2003; a month to the date before he turned 50) is alive with us still.  Our 7-year-old daughter is certain Adrian's spirit is here, thankfully.    At various times I feel his presence but others I come up empty and sad and mad that he's gone.  Every long day without him, I work hard to connect with his spirit and the good memories.  I can only hope I see the signs he sends me that his spirit is here, because the hole he's left is huge.  So how did he die?  Condensing that to one paragraph sucks, because it is such a heart-wrenching story of love, courage and strength.  This year I would like to get moving on the book.  Adrian was a 5-year NHL cancer (non-Hodgkin's lymphoma) survivor; we all were, as the whole family went through the battle together.  He had a rough battle, on life support and almost died, but he fought back, learned to walk and live again. We had 5 really good years, I'm incredibly grateful for those.  But due to happy neglect we missed recent signs of cancer (a rare T-cell lymphoma) because he was waiting for a 2nd kidney transplant (his first, 12 years prior had been a combined kidney pancreas due to Juvenile diabetes).    Thankfully Adrian went quickly on this final hospital visit.  His body had fought so hard, and far longer than most, before it gave out.  He had gained all of my respect and love during our short 16 years together.  Now I still feel grateful for what we had, the subtle love everywhere.  Our 7-year-old daughter is our miracle, both through conception and as a living memory of Adrian.   Much more to say, I rarely write short, this will be a first.  More later?  Thanks for listening.

      I like this blog link b/c it is so anti-bush.  Adrian would like this too.  I can't stand our country, I'm so disgusted with a president who wasn't even popularly elected.  Hey isn't that called a dictatorship!?   urlLink Weblog

      A brief moment at the computer.  It feels too weird to look forward to things happening this summer (after all where is Adrian?).  Ok he died last September (how could I forget, memories of him consume my every waking and sleeping moment), so how can I actually be looking forward to anything?    But I am!  I’m really looking forward to the eventful summer ahead (those feelings seem surprising).  This excitment feels good yet totally weird because Adrian is not here (after 15 married years together I don't always understand why he's not here).  Well his spirit is here, but that’s just so different and again ‘weird’ is the word that fits best (for the moment).  I’m finding life so very strange (hey I thought of another fitting word) without Adrian.  Again I know he is here, I know we're connected still, but in such a different way.    I’m actually getting used to doing stuff without him, and finding that I’m having fun (I’d give anything to have him back, but I can’t so onward, sort of).    I’m looking forward to all of summer (already enjoyable and in process), even though it all seems so emotional.     I'm looking forward to :  * Rebecca’s laughing friends filling the house,  * my niece visiting us (but it will be so emotional) today from Columbus * my moms short visit (to bring Heather and Rebecca back to Cleveland) * 2 weeks without parent responsibilities while Rebecca is with my mom * flying to Guernsey (a whole month, what a gift) to be with Sue and Adrian’s family and the beaches) * meeting Tina’s family in Gsey.    All very nice, but how can it be that Adrian is not here?  (I still don’t always ‘get’ that!)  I've some cleaning to do before Heather arrives, I’m behind on lots of stuff in trying to spend time with Rebecca.  Be well all, I’m doing ok, really, I am, I am, it’s true (???).  Sort of like I’m balancing on a tightrope 100 feet above ground!  But I’m walking slow, balancing, surviving...Thanks for the support, Love, Kathy

      I went to sleep feeling awful (grief awful is awful magnified 1000 times) and awoke this fine morning feeling really good.  Some vague dreams of Adrian must have helped.  Time changes everything when walking our grief journey, though the feelings of loss will always be huge.  This morning my weight is down too, which makes me so pleased!  Adrian was glad too when I lost weight in 2003 (though he never complained when I was over weight, he accepted me no matter what!).  Weight loss is a great way to spice up a marriage.  I feel peaceful that we had extra closeness Adrian’s last 4 months.  I also awoke feeling peaceful about the way Adrian died.  I feel peaceful that it was his time and that he lived his life to the fullest.  I feel peaceful that I got to be married to him and that we had a miracle child together.  On this rough grief journey peaceful days are treasured gifts.  Adrian loved to give gifts.  I feel his loving presence guiding me.  I wonder how long this will last?!  Kathy  Oh and PS, this from the Seattle PI today “…Michael Moore has said he wants his latest movie manifesto, "Fahrenheit 9/11," to unseat the president...”    Now  that would really make my day .  I can’t wait to see the movie, but I might have to wait for it on Netflix, because it’s not something I’ll take Rebecca to see.  She certainly knows our views though.

      The overwhelming sad feelings are back today, but no surprise really, all part of the grief journey.  I dreamed of Adrian too (in some odd setting) he talked to me!  Told me even though he couldn’t kiss me any more, he was right here with me.  Comforting yes.  Lots of calls to make today.  I’ll do it slowly, but first share a great Rebecca comment from last Saturday.  On our way to the carnival she said, "when you find a penny do you feel daddy's love coursing through you?"!!!!   Too sweet.  Take care, Kathy

      Short blog today, still happy the clouds are out (and not the sun, enough already!), and happy that I played with Harry early this morning (got throwing the ball 100 times out of the way at 8 am).  I’m really a morning person at heart, I just love getting things done when the day is fresh and new.  Unlike Adrian (and now Rebecca) who preferred to stay up late.    Naturally my scheduled time to get our sunroom windows cleaned is the end of a 10-day sunny streak!  I got on my case (usually Adrian would be on mine, though he would say I was on his :-) in May for not looking up the number and picking up the phone.  But hey I’m thrilled to have accomplished something in the first place.  Even if the dog barked for almost 2 solid hours (enough to put me in the loony bin).  Everything I do without Adrian is traumatic; maybe someday in the next couple of years I will be able to function again?!   That’s a dream of mine now, a new dream.  We all have to make up new hopes for the future because our current ones are shattered (but those ramblings would be getting side tracked).  Now that I finally bit the bullet and had the gutters and windows cleaned it looks like rain!  I’m too cold to even sit in the sunroom right now though it looks terrific all cleaned.  Don’t get me wrong, I’d much rather have cooler mild temps of 60-70’s vs. the high 80’s of the last few weeks (ugh, it's been too wierd without Adrian).  Well at least I can sit in the sunroom (which is where I find Adrian’s spirit so clearly as we built that room late 1999 to early 2000, after he recovered from cancer) now and imagine Adrian proud of me for getting something done.  The cleaned windows make me feel good, especially with our neighbor’s bamboo trees growing so fully.    Speaking of bamboo, my book reading has slowed down dramatically, ever since I couldn’t stand reading  Anna Karenina  (early June).  Now 2 books later I’m reading a David Baldacci novel called   urlLink Amazon.com: Books: The Winner  .   It’s fast paced like I need, but I keep wanting to turn my thoughts to Adrian memories.    I’ve read over 50 books these last 6 months, it’s been a great escape up until now.  I suppose there is no reason to slow down my reading, except then I do think more of Adrian (maybe that's what I 'need' to do now?).  I’ve been trying to find the time to add another chapter to   urlLink Our Cancer Story   blog, and haven’t gotten too it.  Oh well (my 'to do' list is long).  I have wanted to share about the one Grief book (out of 8 maybe) I've read on this journey that’s really moved me deeply.  I keep this book in my bedside nightstand.  It’s by Elizabeth Levang called  urlLink Amazon.com: Books: Remembering With Love: Messages of Hope for the First Year of Grieving and Beyond   This book is my 5 star highly recommend for anyone dealing with Grief.  Each page has a title, a quote, a few sentences on the topic and then a message at the end of each page.  It’s written in nice easy to read pages, which is essential when you're grieving and not functioning.  I’ve post-it noted a few pages, and I turned to this one today (really says where I’m at) about  Expressing Grief : “ I will allow the feelings of grief to come from within me.  This inner healing will not be painless.  By expressing it, I will be sharing my love and pain with the hope that the future will be better. ”  With that said, enough for today!  Rebecca wants me to watch the movie “Lion King 1-1/2” with her.  Her laughter alone is enough to put me in good spirits (though sitting for more than 15 minutes is tough, even before Adrian died).    Thanks for letting me share my grief journey with you.  Hopefully some of these links work.  And thanks for helping me towards healing (though never forgetting the love) by sharing and feedback that I'm ok.  Ha?!   Kathy

      I’m doing well again today (an odd feeling lately), strange how feeling better works.  Also very thankful for everything (weather, home, vacation, Rebecca, Adrian, everything really).  Amazing what cooler temperatures and no school or job needed, will do for one’s outlook!!    I’m thankful beyond belief to Adrian for providing so well for Rebecca and I.  Thanks to him I don’t have to work until I’m ready (we've paid off our mortgage, saved for R's education and I'm good at budgeting).  Being allowed to grieve in my own 'slow' (doesn't come easy) time, is such a gift from Adrian.  Finally accomplished something today (doubly difficult while grieving) that’s sort of been hanging over my head.  I took Rebecca with me to Redmond to get the emissions test on Adrian's car!   It felt like a 150 mile drive rather than 15 miles (but at least I've the good memory of our Aug-02 3000 driving trip down and up the west coast)!  Back to the emissions test, the last time I drove there (Spring 2002), my life seemed normal and good (naturally I didn't realize how good).  Driving through 45 minutes of road construction was harder than the 2-minute test itself.    Yet I felt Adrian there with us, maybe because while Rebecca played quietely in back with her gameboy, I sat in traffic (something that usually makes me nuts) and   stayed calm   (staying calm is always a pleasurable surprise).   On the way home Rebecca and I went to a park that we used to go to with Adrian: Ferrel McQuirter (or was that our joke name for it?) in Redmond.  Walking through the park, Rebecca did that wonderful 7 year old hop-skip step and seemed so happy (that terrific way kids have of grieving where they can put their troubles behind them so easily).  She was thrilled seeing a big sow and 6 baby pigs, sheep, lambs, rabbits and ponies.  Plus we took a hike that reminded me so much of Adrian: the sun shining through the tall forest evergreens and ferns.  Just lovely.  A day where I could feel good about being alive; a real treat when going along this rough grief journey.  After dinner Rebecca and I stayed healthy by taking Harry for a walk (again Adrian was with us, as we always meant to walk in the summer but never got to it).    Then her new “Monster Rocket” replacement parts were put to the test.   We had great fun in front of the house, neighbors included, watching the kids pump to launch this 7 ft balloon rocket.    It literally went up 100+ feet in the air (Target sale purchase for only $23.77, of which Rebecca used $20 from her hard earned allowance to make sure she could get it).  So much excitement was created from this launched rocket; simple science at it’s finest.  The kids were jumping up and down and screaming, they were so excited.  Rebecca said  "it was better than the commerical!".     Adrian was there with us launching the rocket (kind of spooky).  First, unusual that I noticed the rocket in the Target circular.  Then Rebecca wanted it more than anything, because Daddy would’ve loved playing this with her (he did help inspire in her a love of science).  A funny aside: her science folder for school was labled phonetically a “2004 sins folder”.  Then the kids put so much effort to get this rocket launched (it often didn't work on the first or second trys).  Politics vent for the day, my (and Adrian’s) sentiments with a laugh.  From the PI Letters to the Editor of June 23rd (24 years to the day that I started full-time work right after college in downtown Atlanta):  “….If you listen carefully to the Bush administration's official reason for going to war with Saddam's Iraq, you'll hear this: Our objective was clear, we went there to liberate the Iraqi people from a despot.  This easily can be interpreted in another, more ambiguous way: Objective, Iraqi Liberation. The administration's unofficial mission acronym: OIL.”   Wade Boyd, Marysville  That’s the truth all along, OIL, and if they had just come out and said that.  Well hopefully with all these lies the administration will be burying themselves, but I don't know, the bushies have raised so much money it's disgusting (oh that's another vent another time).    Must be off to make sure darling Rebecca gets showered, which wow she just did and “scared me 200 feet” by not jumping up behind me (like she did about 10 times) but by turning on the shower herself).  What a kid, I only wanted to strangle her one time today :-)!    I love this life of leisure, though it’s really not leisure.  There’s lots of hard work and love every day.  Tomorrow I get up early as I finally got window washing and gutter cleaning scheduled (naturally that means the 8 days of sunshine is over and rain in the forecast).  Oh well, I’m feeling so thankful for the time with Adrian.  Be well and appreciate.  Kathy

      In a reserved sort of way today I’ve actually felt happy (and healthy too). That’s such a good feeling.  My weight is down and it’s summer; what more could I ask?  Except for Adrian back!  I’ve felt his spirit here today helping me enjoy this nice first day of summer vacation.  I do believe loved ones who’ve passed are with us.   I truly think if you look and listen you can see the signs too (a bird, a song, a person, a breeze…).  The signs are everywhere, in those things and people you love.  I believe now, after 9 months on this grief journey that it's the bonds of love that keep us connected, and I feel that all through my home.  In every room there are memories, pictures, and candles (which BTW on sale at Target this week for $5). The jar kind are my favorite, and the colors are excellent.  I don't like stores but Target does a such a good job.  Yesterday Rebecca and I stocked up!.  Now key is feeling Adrian’s spirit when we’re 6,000 miles from our home (but I’m trying hard to stay in the present and that’s a month away).  Plus when we're in Guernsey, that's the island Adrian grew up on, there will be meaning everywhere.  And the scenery (and family) are so spectacular, it will be a great trip (but then again grief can knock you to the ground so quickly and surpisingly).  I finally got some good photos developed of Adrian and Rebecca  (in our computer of the last 4 years).  Some I enlarged to 5x7 and put in the sunroom.  It’s made me so happy and connected to Adrian.    My favorite new picture is a close up of Rebecca and Adrian sitting on a jet ski rental boat in Lake Chelan in Sept 2000 (Rebecca was 4 then). Adrian's brother was visiting, and we had such a fun trip!! Lots of good memories, bad too though, don't get me wrong, it wasn't like we were always happy (I remember getting mad at Adrian for maybe walking slow or something irrelevant now).  I highly recommend pictures to help on the grief journey, they can tell full stories.  I feel so fortunate to have some, because at key times in our life our cameras didn't work (like when Rebecca was born!!!)   I often feel our family 8x10 photo I've printed and framed (of us on Mont St Michel in France in 2001) which is in the sunroom is Adrian talking to me.  Very comforting.  Oh and many of Adrian’s belongings have so much meaning.  Sometimes I just hold on to his ring, wallet, or watch.  Adrian's wedding ring story is good for another time, but thankfully I've got it on a necklace now.  Also Adrian's watch is in my bathroom and it's him talking to me letting me know he’s still here.    Ok for politics today, I’ve copied the end of this article by Helen Thomas (a columnist for Hearst Newspapers) who says it so well:   “One has to wonder what it takes for Americans to demand an accounting from the president when faced with the fact that they were deluded into going to war….”   Yes thank you!   I’m not totally tuned in to the news since Adrian died, but I do get snippets of things.  I don’t understand why so many seem accepting of bush policies.  If Clinton had done the same, the right wing would have hung him by now.  Just wanted to share some thoughts, too tired to write the cute Rebecca stuff from today.  She’s a sweetie and keeps me going.  Feeling good, what a change.  Thanks for listening.  What do you think?  Kathy

      School’s out for summer (remember that song from the 70's?), yes!!!! Adrian never liked a lot of exclamation points in my writing, but right now I’m saying “tough”.  Usually I try to honor his memories such as I'm finally growing my hair longer (as he liked it).    I’m so happy school is out!!!  The routine of getting me up at 6 am (and Rebecca at 7 am) gets a needed break.  I’m so grateful to be able to take the summer off with Rebecca, rather than getting up early like I used to when Adrian went off to work (or even the days when I went into work).    Actually I’ll only be with Rebecca at home for 2 weeks on both ends.  She spends 2 weeks in Cleveland Ohio with Grandma (going to camp) and we together spend 4 weeks to   urlLink VisitGuernsey    (being with Adrian’s family and going to the beach).    Why is it even when you are grieving that the summer seems too short before it even starts?  I told Rebecca that I was so happy we'd survived the school year (what with a new school and Daddy's death Sept 15th).  She said “ but mom I was the one that did all the work ”.  Ha!    Well that’s true but I stayed here with her, supported and guided her, and made it a full 9 months without Adrian's physically being here!  Many a time I wanted to curl up in bed and not move.  I got up every morning and woke her, helped with homework, made sure she didn’t turn into a TV veggie!  She did not miss one day of school or miss the bus once!  Now isn’t that the most amazing!?  Right now she’s downstairs building her graduation gift: Lego’s Harry Potter Train (Harry our dog ate her 5yo set when we first got him, Nov 2002).    Such a pleasing accomplishment to have survived a whole 9 months, and this new school year, without Adrian.  It seems surreal.  If you had talked to me 5 years ago (after cancer recovery), there is no way I would ever have thought I could survive without Adrian.  Even now it seems so weird.    When I said to Rebecca this was the hardest year she will ever have, she said, “ no fifth grade is really hard !”  (Really I ‘know’ this will be her hardest year, and she did it!)  We had a good weekend but today Rebecca’s so sad about school ending, I’m just trying to make things fun for her (always a stretch for me).  She cried saying bye to her teacher (shyly she told me), he’s been terrific, and we were so fortunate to have him and a male too (that helped Rebecca a lot).  He was a sign that Adrian was watching over, as Mr L's the same age as her most loved Daddy (not a concidence).    Anyways Saturday afternoon ‘we’ took Rebecca to a carnival at the Kenmore Safeway parking lot, sponsored by the school for cancer.   Burning hot (85, but no one here has a/c, at least we could see the mountains) but not too crowded and even not too bad.    Right before we left Rebecca found a penny from the year 2003, so she said, “Daddy is right here with us”.  She had a blast and that helped me.  My downfall came from walking into Safeway for sale cherries and red peppers.  We got stuff for Rebecca (chocolate donuts, that was so Adrian!) but I started feeling like I was going to explode from all the people, dodging carts, lines, beeping, time I'd spent from home, traffic, lights, heat, etc.  But once again we made it (when you’re grieving each minor accomplishment is big).  Sunday I bit the bullet and finally hired one of Rebecca’s favorite sitters to come over and play for 2 hours.  They played really rough (so key for Rebecca since I won’t do that anymore—that was daddy’s job) and Rebecca kept hugging Karen when it was time to go.  Seeing Rebecca happy is a   huge   relief!  2 hours break at the gym felt so refreshing (as I was leaving Rebecca said “ oh good you’ll be gone two hours, that means two hours of fun !”).  Also coloring my outlook for the better, I weighed in down another 2 pounds at 123!  The last time I felt like this, days before Adrian died, I was a wreck trying to be calm.  Now the calm comes far more often, thankfully (you couldn't live the hospital life forever, thats for sure).  Sunday evening my friend Mary Michael came over (her hubby died the same year as Adrian) and we watched “ Something’s Gotta Give ”.  Laughed really hard (anyone else like this movie?).   Laughter is such great grief therapy, I highly recommend the movie too.    My friend just got back from a 2-week trip to China.  I really want to go there sometime (I’ve always wanted to) and can’t wait for Rebecca to be old enough to enjoy it (what right before teen or right after?)  Need to go play with the kid before she goes out into the neighborhood to get soaked with her friend Spencer; I’m feeling ok.   That’s a treat.  Enjoy the summer.  I know it will go fast. Aaaah summer at last. What do you think?  Kathy

      I’ve survived one of the worst days since Adrian’s death, and I’m happy to say I’m feeling much better today.  Thursday was the pits, overwhelming sadness with a migraine and the shock of Adrian being gone hitting me all over again (what's with that?).    Actually the day felt like being tossed in the ocean with drowning waves of grief and I had to hold on until time passed and I could fall asleep.  But I made it and I’m really thrilled.  One step away from overwhelmingly bad days is comforting, in a strange sort of way.  So you ask what made Thursday so much worse than all the other day’s I’ve survived without my beloved hubby?  Simple, carry over from Wednesday when Rebecca and I went to the dentist.  Something as naturally frustrating as no parking spaces (I've never had a parking problem there before, and it made the whole time at the dentist hurt)made me realize what fragile ground I stand on.   As a treat after I took Rebecca out to dinner (a fun pizza and pasta place Adrian and I kept meaning to try).  At first she didn’t want to since it reminds her too much of daddy (I don’t think we’ve been out to dinner in 9 months since he died, oh once with Grandma Donna for Rebecca’s birthday in October).  The word 'pizza' was all I really needed to say and she became eager!  Dinner out devastated me (seemed totally weird without Adrian) plus I actually ate pizza and the cheese made me sick (not used to rich food, Adrian loved cheese though, and now we don't stock it at home).  The hole without Adrian seemed so wretchedly huge, and dinner out magnified our loss.    When we got home Rebecca ate some cookies and I started craving these.  She said something that sounded exactly like Adrian “go ahead and just eat one and stop talking about it”.  That broke me up (though really Adrian used to say it in a nice joking way and so did Rebecca).  For maybe the first time since Adrian died I really felt the need to overeat.  Almost to chase away the hole, which was the stupidist thing for me to do.  I was scared at how powerful my feelings were to overeat and fill the void.  I could've eaten the whole box but I stopped maybe at 8.  I had to go upstairs and go to bed; just a horrible out of control feeling.  But thankfully passed.     I weighed in this morning at 125 and felt so much better (dropped 2 pounds since the pizza and cookies) and actually felt a sliver of happiness.  If I develop a weight loss obsession (just joking), maybe I can cope better with the loss of Adrian (I still weigh 10 pounds less than last year and 30 less than 2 years ago).  Thursday we had a surprise newspaper delivered to our driveway (also pushed me further into drowning water).  Wow something as simple as the newspaper on the driveway reminded me of our life together, albeit in a good way, and how much has changed for me (plain scary).  I kept looking for messages from Adrian and this article, which I wouldn’t have found on-line, gave me hope in the future:  “A group of 26 retired US diplomats and military officers said yesterday that President Bush should be voted out of office in November for damaging US national security interests and America’s standing in the international community.”   Exactly!   About time some people of influence spoke out.  I'm tempted to move to Guernsey when Rebecca and I visit in mid-July (for a month!) but not really, as she is settled here.  Yesterday the sun shining (like a slap in the face) and forcing myself to work out didn’t help me feel ok.  Really I could not wait for the day to end, I never had these feelings when Adrian was alive!   Rebecca had such a rough time last night too, but woke in far better spirits.  She said things like “I wish daddy were the one here and you were gone” and “you’re so bossy” and “reading is so boring” and “I’m so mad at daddy for dying and it’s just too sad to talk about”.    I think all this stuff is so important to get out and I'm glad she was able to say it (instead of getting mad and door slamming).  She also said “I’m not a baby, so I can’t cry.”  Well I put that myth to rest.  She was in a great mood this morning though she is naturally sad about school ending (at least she can still see her teacher, but not Daddy--bah wah).  I still can't believe it's the end of the school year, but that topic is for another post.  I took Harry for an hour walk this morning (well he took me for the walk).  We are starting to train him to heel just for walk to the bus stop, almost 1.5 years after we've had him.    My walk this morning was nice with the sun shinning (I was ok with sun today, though it just feels so ‘mean’, which shows you how sensitive I am lately).  I tried hard to just appreciate being alive (not always good at that, but at least I make the attempt).    Key for me, I survived last night (despite some weird lightening storm); all I wanted was for the day to end (as fast as possible).  Yes I dreamed about Adrian and that helped (even though it was the scary repetitive dream I have about the ambulance taking Rebecca away from us).    One moment at a time and today is mow the lawn and massage day, and Friday thankfully!  I can do it???  Do you think??? Thanks for listening.

      Ok in honor of Adrian, and 9 months ago on the 15th, here is the link to   urlLink Our Cancer Story   blog, the Prologue: Adrian's Final Days.   I still have lots of corrections and improvements.  It's a work in process, like love really.  Wow I've hit a 'corny' day.  Ok today I’m also feeling wiped out.  Not like I felt wiped out and in shock 9 months ago (the day after Adrian's death) when we went to the funeral home and spent 3 hours (I made fast decisions too) planning Adrian’s service.  Martyn and I went to the gym after.  If this had happened 20 years ago we would’ve gone to a bar after!  Despite dragging I’ve had a surprising morning for getting things done: the usual getting up (a job!), getting Rebecca off to school, throwing the ball 100 times with Harry, weeding the yard, ordering photos (yes from last summer and early fall), setting up sunroom window washing and ordering a replacement part for Rebecca’s new “Monster Rocket”.  Wow, now I'm really dragging!  I felt Adrian with us last night outside while Rebecca figured how to build this Monster Rocket contraption.  Her friend (Holly) and her took 2 hours trying to launch it (pretending they were NASA mission control for jets).  They finally got it launched and we lost the f*cking thing into the trees!  Late yesterday I read some great Letters to The Editors on-line in the PI, from June 15th, but this blog is too long.  I could link, but I haven’t gotten this techno crap fine-tuned.  So here's a few that I'd be talking to Adrian about (I still did, saying “yes, it’s about time...”):  “Instead of tampering with existing legal tender to display the face of ‘Saint’ Ronald Reagan, defender of the poor and the downtrodden, why not create new money? Let us dedicate to him the $13 bill. It would go well with his voodoo economics.”  Zoltan Abraham, Renton  And also from the 15th:  “While it is true that Ray Charles was never president, it is also true that several of the people portrayed on our currency also never served in that office. Charles led us to sing, dance and accept others among us as being our brothers and sisters. He taught us through the example of his own life without the need for sermonizing or lawgiving."   "Granted, he never steered this country down the road of crippling debt or helped to erode the separation between church, state and industry, but I really don't think we should hold that against him when considering him for remembrance in our wallets."   "Where is it written that those who frequently nudge the sled of civilization toward the incline of the apocalypse get to be memorialized on our money while those who elevate our spirits are considered lucky to get on a postage stamp" Hal Colombo, Seattle   And finally I can’t resist, from the 15th:  “Whatever one thought of Ronald Reagan, the immediate aftermath of his death should put to rest at least one persistent myth.   “…all of the major television networks lavish revisionist praise on the Reagan era, when the major print media minimize possible Reagan era faults and boldly extol potential Reagan virtues, a different kind of truth begins to emerge…”  “…His legacy, now in its infancy, will eventually cohere. But we have learned a searing truth after a week of unending …praise.  It is simply this: The major media are definitely not liberal.”  Don Lee, Seattle  Isn’t that the truth.  The media is owned by those with deep pockets that finance the current bush administration.  The media is so very conservative (I want to throw up!).  I get sick reading the news and Newsweek these last 4 years especially. Thanks for letting me vent, comments would help me today (as long as you are nice to me!), Take care, Kathy g

      You won’t believe this!  I awoke to the  same  song that I awoke to 9 months ago (the day Adrian died).  This song (by Dido, thats all I know) gives me strength (now and then).    The lyric that means most to me is “I’m in love and I always will be”.  That totally describes how I feel today and how I felt 9 months ago with the difficult decision to take Adrian off life support.  The other lyric that keeps running through my head is “I will not surrender, I will not go down with this ship, I’m in love...” or something like that.  That gave me such strength 9 months ago.  This morning I’ve been thinking, “I am in love with Adrian and always will be”.  So comforting and makes me actually feel good.  As awful as I felt yesterday, exactly mirroring 9 months ago, I awoke with this new optimistic feeling.  As though there’s relief that I did the right thing by setting Adrian’s spirit free from his body (deep down I do question my decision, though in my heart I know it was right).    And I still feel so connected to Adrian, just in a different way than when he lived in his body.  He was such a good person, and I feel so fortunate to have shared his life and his love.  Today I've defined as Memory Day for Adrian (on my Clie gift from him) we light candles and tell good stories. Most of today I will be remembering what an amazing person Adrian was and how lucky I am to have his love always.    Also so fortuneate to have Rebecca (as hard as it was to concieve her) and all that we did as a family.  Our love, which can keep me warm even today, gives me such a surprising strength.    If you want to read what happened Adrian's final days (it’s long) visit Our Cancer Story blog (under Previous Posts on the left, because I can't get this link to show up).    Appreciate your loved ones and that you're alive!  That’s my motto today.  Thanks. Kathy  urlLink

      Dreaming of life with Adrian (those were the days).  Today I’m forcing myself to live, going through the motion while feeling detached, as though serious tears need to break through.    But I made it to the chiropractor, the bank (used the whole condo proceeds to pay down our HE loan), and even the grocery store (which still requires deep breaths because I’m not buying all the food I would when Adrian was alive).  I'm trying to appreciate this last week of Rebecca’s being at school.  It’s so nice to have privacy and quiet during the day (well except for our dog following me around wherever I go)!  As much as I love Rebecca, just having 8.30 to 3.30 without the TV running helps me stayed glued together.  That’s my 24/7 job since Adrian died: “staying glued together for Rebecca.”  I do know I can survive (frequently I wonder though) without Adrian physically being here; just sometimes I feel like I’m walking through thick molasses.  Compounded by the empty space of a Monday and the pending feeling of tomorrow, the 15th, being the 9 month marker of Adrian’s death.  It's so weird that we are in the month of June.  I can't really understand.  That’s my short blog for today.  I’m off to the gym (I’ll be ok as long as I don’t see any ‘happy’ people, hah).  Thanks.  Kathy

      Ok I've made the leap, I've done it and I feel somehow better.  Just click on my new blog and see the start of   urlLink Our Cancer Story   Again no direct Adrian dreams but I still feel his spirit here with me, thank goodness (otherwise far too empty to even contemplate).  I really believe that love lives on strong even when a person's body is gone.  For a change here, Rebecca had use of the computer most of the day.  I'm glad she's back using it again.  Daddy and her sat together a lot and found lots of fun games.  It's essentially taken her 9 months to be at the computer again. I'm glad she is because there are so many good Adrian pictures, and it feels warm and comforting here.  Do take a look at my new blog  urlLink Our Cancer Story  .  Not sure I'll have time to update as much as I'd like, but it's a start that makes me feel good and keeps Adrian memory more alive.  Now if I could get these blogging details worked out (like pictures).  I'm really enjoying this mild Seattle weather, with the sun peaking occasionally from out behind the clouds (bright weather is too depressing).  I actually had 'fun' tossing the ball 100 times to Harry.  I love yard work too, and there is lots of it to do without Adrian physically helping me.  Take care all, and appreciate what you have, really it can all go so fast.  Kathy

      No Adrian dreams but I do feel he’s here with us.  9 months ago today, while Adrian was in the hospital on life support, I finally realized he wouldn’t be able to have a 2nd miracle recovery.  Talk about difficult, beyond that.  Four days later he died, he was so strong and such a fighter.  He lasted far longer than most would’ve in his shoes, with his many health challenges.  Still he kept such a pleasant disposition all of his life, even towards the last year where it got more difficult.  So why do I feel relief today?  First it’s Friday and though the weekends are empty without Adrian, they are still a break from waking at 6 am and getting Rebecca off to school (and forcing myself to live).  Also sold and closed on our Lake Chelan condo (bought it in ’91 as a recovery from transplant incentive) finally.  We didn’t make money on the sale (we really lost money), but we had so many good trips up to the mountains that it was worth it, or so I'm trying to tell myself!    Now that money needs to go straight to paying the small balance on our home equity loan.  But I can hear Adrian's voice clear as day "Kathy you better take at least $100 of that and spend it on something for you and Rebecca!"  I'm not sure, "I'd rather get the HE loan paid off", and so my dialogue with Adrian continues today!  Also relief concerning medical insurance: after one full frustrating hour on the phone and on-line with Boeing’s medical and my current I’ve got a good plan worked out.  Well almost, still some details, but it looks like I can get by with about $500 less a month than I would’ve paid on Cobra.  Still all these details and grief do not go well together!  So I’m ok today.  Just lots of happy memories to keep me warm, though it’s not like we only had good times, there were lots of bad, it just becomes part of the picture.  And I'm thankful beyond belief that I've a picture to remember, and I live one still here.  Rebecca though is having a hard time with the fact that the school year is ending.  She is a lot sadder than she would be if daddy hadn’t died.  Thankfully her teacher is great, and aware of this, and helping her see that he will still be here next year when she goes into 3rd grade (yikes how does it go fast, even when grief makes time slow to a snails pace) and spends 5 years at this (terrific) elementary school.  I'm off to work out, just a cycle day thankfully.  But first a Bush Rant, a paragraph that I would ordinarily talk to Adrian about, from email:    urlLink MoveOn.org: Democracy in Action   “Revelations regarding Halliburton's unethical and at times illegal behavior continue to pop up at a regular pace.   But perhaps more worrisome are indications that the Bush administration isn't just turning a blind eye to Halliburton's corrupt business practices -- it's actively helping the company along.   For example, Time Magazine exposed last week that newly disclosed internal Pentagon emails suggest that the office of Vice President Dick Cheney was instrumental in sealing an $18 BILLION no-bid contract ...”  Be well everyone and thanks for reading.

      No ‘Adrian’ dreams last night, but that’s ok, two in one week seem like such a gift (that can sustain me for at least a week, lets hope)!    I’ve been thinking a lot about Adrian’s cancer story, well we called it 'our cancer story' as the whole family went through it.  I’m so unbelievably grateful that Adrian survived for 5 extra years.  We did so much together in that time, and appreciated much more (though I now feel I took Adrian too much for granted, when did that start, maybe 2002?).    I’m thinking of starting another blog about our cancer story, but it will go slow as my energy and time allows.  I can get the ‘basic’ things done in my life, but that’s it.  I already have all the compiled emails in book form.  Adrian had read it too.  So this book blog will just be a chapter a week maybe, as I will do lots of correcting as I go.  A writer friend said I ‘just’ need to do a proposal to get it published.  Well I’ll be my own web log publisher, because I can’t get into doing the ‘proposal’ these days.  One thing I must get first is the medical mess of health care insurance. Cobra thankfully runs 2 more years, but in September I’ll start paying $800/ month, unless I can research something better.    Adrian’s thankfully had excellent health care.  I’m so grateful Group Health covered his $200,000 kidney pancreas transplant in ’91.  Then in ’98 we had the $500,000 + cancer treatment.  GH just wasn’t good at ‘diagnosing’ but that’s ok, I’m relieved actually that Adrian died quickly the way he did, and not a year of brutal cancer treatment with no chance of recovery.  Back to the present, I must move forward, to the Boeing voice mail maze to get just to ‘view on-line’ medical options (a royal pain).  And my energy is so much lower since before Adrian’s death, though I’m much much much more calm and relaxed after my massage yesterday.    I’ll be ok, or so I try to tell myself. One moment at a time.  Hugs everyone, and thanks for reading.  Kathy

      I dreamed indirectly about Adrian last night, something about ‘being in a mall (which we detest) and learning to live without Adrian, I knew he had died’ type of dream.  But that didn’t stop me this morning from feeling shattered.  Absolutely and positively.  I had a sign from Adrian about being shattered, 2 months after he died (and now I'm almost at 9 months).  I didn’t quite see it at the time, as the clear sign I see it as now.  In November I had thought it 'could be' a sign, now I feel 'certain', again which is somewhat comforting, but it doesn't stop me from feeling shattered today, or as a way of life?  In November (two months) after Adrian died, I had been spending much of my time (when I was in the family room) staring at a vase he had given me for our 1st anniversary thinking “I need to move that vase”.  These were my thoughts in the midst of heavy grief.   Before Adrian died, I could think about things and get them done, but not two months after Adrian died, even now I’m slowed in my ability to think then get something done.  So one cold day I dragged myself home from the gym, threw my sweaty clothes into the laundry hamper, closed the door and I heard “crash”.  I turned around, and the top shelf of our new built in bookshelves and entertainment center (that Adrian designed while in his 5-year cancer survivor run) had fallen to the ground.    The vase he had given me was “shattered”.  That perfectly described the way I felt (but I hadn’t been using that word) and one of his model cars fell down making Rebecca really happy to have found that new toy (that they had played with together)!  To manage to shatter that vase that I was specifically thinking about is remarkable, and seems such a strong sign.  I salvaged half the vase, picked up the many broken pieces and put them in what was left of the vase.  The shape of the shattered glass was picturesque and I’ve put it in our new (circa May '02) dining room cabinet, that Adrian wasn’t alive long enough to even enjoy :-(.    This is corny: it’s the time you spend with people that’s important in the end.  It’s not the ‘things’ you get; though Adrian loved getting (and giving) things.  What I value most, now that Adrian has died, is the time we spent together, the good memories, the trips, even the fighting was interesting.    How lucky I feel to have had these 15 years (well since we moved into our new home and got married).  I knew Adrian for 16 years when he died, and we were married for 14, but I feel like time goes on and I still know him (we are still married in my eyes and always will be), so I’m getting really confused lately about measuring time.  Anyways I’ve got the perfect picture figured for this blog, because it highlights the best of times from Adrian’s surviving cancer (yet I have to download something first, and that's usually Adrian’s area of expertise).    The picture for the blog was taken in 2000 on my bday, in the summer, and it’s a rare family picture. We didn’t take enough of those!  Take pictures those of you who have complete families!  Not like I’m good about taking pictures of Rebecca now, but I need to, the camera just feels too heavy :-(  Ok I really must run and return to forcing myself to live.  When what I really want to do is curl up in a ball and just think of good Adrian memories, but I won’t do that.    I took Harry for a walk this morning that was challenging.  He weighs in at 75 pounds; he is so strong and pulls really hard, I don’t think it will matter that I’m skipping weight training today(for massage thank goodness).  My arms got a work out and I feel wiped out.  Must run, thanks for reading, do I sound loony?  Oh well.  Kathy

      Thankfully I had another 'good Adrian' dream last night, that’s extremely comforting (as opposed to a 'bad Adrian' dream about him leaving me which is still comforting in an odd sort of way)!    But I slept badly because Harry got into my room (he usually sleeps under Rebecca’s bed) but because Rebecca left her door open (gurh) and my bedroom door is broken, he can head-butt it open.    Well I kept hearing Harry's collar while he moved around, yet it made me realize how much better I sleep without Adrian.  Sad but true (he used to get up in the middle of the night, and snoring and just another person breathing—-but oh what I would give to have Adrian back) and now in some strange way I have it good because I can now sleep with real quiet that only comes from being alone.  I sleep better now than I have in 14 years :-(  Also a good sign (despite feeling crappy this morning) I awoke to a song on the radio that was a clear sign from Adrian (Coldplay, Clocks, which is not a 'new' song as is usually played at 6 am, and then that disc played in Adrian's hospital room continuously).  Only problem: I felt that was such a strong sign from Adrian now I’m obligated to believe that his spirit is here with me, in some direct manner, more than I can see with my eyes.    Instead I’d really prefer to bitch that I can’t live my life without Adrian (and complain that the TV is too loud, and Harry is too hyper, etc).  But it’s not true, I’m doing it, slow going as it is, slugging through high tides of grief and all.  Feeling Adrian's spirit does help, and I'm grateful I can, so why am I complaining?  Rebecca was very enjoyable this morning, she seems to be saying very cute and wise things (drawing a blank now) and the 1-inch gap in her toothless smile is totally heart melting.  Only minor problem with her is that last night she ate a bowl of garlic powder!  Gross I know, but she loves garlic and I didn't stop her (natural consequences but ugh I pay the price too).    This morning I went into wake her and the garlic now permeates her body!  Her whole room smells like garlic, where she walks smells.   I kept wanting (in my sleepless grouchiness) to throw up because she smells so bad.  I told her she might get teased today, and she didn't believe me!  Well another day of forcing myself, but also trying to appreciate time alone in the house.  School only lasts for 2 more weeks and despite having plans, it means non-stop parenting (make that non-stop "I don't want to be single without Adrian" parenting).    Last evening I tried slogging through Anna Karenina (can't get into it and I'm halfway thru) and finishing my 1000 pc puzzle (so difficult, a cat in red flowers) and Rebecca kept interrupting and wanting to play.  The one time she actually wants to play, I don’t (oh wouldn't you know!).    Usually our roles are reversed as I’m always trying to get her away from the TV.  Yesterday I gave up on that, and she wouldn't leave me alone.  The happy or easy solution is to get an hour of reading time before she comes home (which I couldn’t do yesterday).    What on earth will I do while she is on vacation?  No it will be fine, really, I’m sure, no problem, I can do it (I say with all the lack of conviction I've lived for the last 9 months without Adrian).  I'll stop and remind myself: Adrian's spirit is here with us (yeah right?). Thanks for reading.  Kathy

      In honor of Adrian I owe a comment on Reagan.  Adrian spoke strongly against the president; we had many interesting conversations where I would get worked up in agreement.  If Adrian were alive I would’ve highlighted these 2 Letters to the Editors snippets:  "When Franklin Delano Roosevelt died, poor people and minorities openly wept in the streets. Now that Reagan is dead and his legacy of blaming those same poor and minorities for their own conditions firmly in place as a tenet of his party, I doubt that the same emotional outpouring will be expressed by that sane segment of the population over the next few days."  Bruce Ellestad, Lopez Island  And even better Letter (from the Seattle PI):  "But we owe it to ourselves never to embrace the disastrous legacy of the Reagan years: massive budget deficits, falling wages, education cuts, redistribution of the tax burden onto the middle class, government secrecy, the Iran-contra scandal, out-of-control defense expenditures, environmental degradation, the costly S&L fiasco and the speculative frenzy, the domination of America's federal institutions by the wealthiest 1 percent, tax credits for segregated schools, the HUD scandal, the Star Wars missile program…" Deborah Diamond-Kim, Issaquah  After throwing 100 balls to Harry, and doing an hour of yard work, I feel ok.  Lots to do this Monday morning, and Monday’s are always especially hard (it’s the day Adrian died, 36 weeks ago, and he used to take every other Monday off work).  Can I actually continue to feel ok on a Monday is my question?  One moment at a time (and keep ignoring that huge hole ahead).  Thanks, Kathy

      Just a quick update.  Feel very appreciative of everything today (what a relief again).  Especially that Rebecca went to a birthday party for her friend named “Adrian” (yes it’s true).    I had a much needed 3-hour break as the mom picked up the kids, can you believe it?  Rebecca came home (they went to 'build a bear' at the mall) and didn’t stop talking, which I actually liked.  She was really happy, and later even did her homework easily (writing that she didn't finish at school) then built a pillow fort (with every pillow we own).  More in comments.  I’m thinking much of the excellent Harry Potter 3 movie and my favorite line when Dumbledore (I liked Richard Harris better than the new one) says something like, “even in the midst of darkness we can find a bit of happiness”.  That’s my motto for now and captures how I feel.  Well I don’t feel the kind of happiness I did when Adrian was alive, at all, but just a flicker.  I love Sunday’s and feel very close to Adrian today, for many reasons that I'm not quite sure why?  I try to remind myself that though his body is not here, his spirit is.  Almost another day that I’ve survived without Adrian.  Still the '9 month' thoughts make me physically sick, how can it be?

      Adrian is back!  Thankfully I dreamed of him last night!  It’s been since May 15th that I had a very specific Adrian dream and I feel so much better now!  Plus yesterday I got the worst headache (explosion type) and went to bed at 7 pm (Rebecca stayed up, naturally).   Thankfully because of the 'Adrian' dream and my ‘find’ I feel so relieved (deep sigh).  My find: On May 15th (8 month marker of Adrian’s death) it was no accident that I lost his wedding ring I'd been wearing on my right thumb.  I’ll spare the long story (unless you all really want to know?) but the ‘floor’ guy helped me move the sectional, where Rebecca had so easily dropped the ring.    Having the ring back makes me feel like Adrian himself has returned.  I feel relief beyond belief (a wonderful feeling in these grief times).  So much better than Friday! Anytime a grieving person gets relief, well it’s time to celebrate, or smile at least.  I took Rebecca to see Harry Potter 3 movie this morning, (packed at 11 am) the first showing.  The movie was terrific, that’s all I can say (well maybe not).  Simply outstanding.  Excellent and wonderful.  The part that broke me up (streaming tears which I really needed) was when Sirius said, “the people you love who’ve died are still alive in your heart” or something like that.  I bet Rebecca can really relate to Harry Potter, but she won’t answer for now.  Many elements of the movie struck close to home though.  Adding to the relief feeling: Rebecca’s front tooth came out this morning (her 6th tooth, she came screaming into my shower, scared the daylights out of me).  I absolutely love her gapping smile, tho I still wanted to strangle her later that morning.    She got stuck in her seat while we were waiting for the movie (she turned backwards and legs folded into a W at the bottom), I was really angry with her, and embarassed as other people had to help us.  But I felt Adrian was there because I somehow stayed calm.  Having his ring around my neck, on a necklace he gave me one anniversary (maybe our 3rd?) makes me feel much calmer.    Yesterday was just the worst day and I’m so glad it’s over and I survived!  That’s all my time for now, Rebecca wants me to watch Harry Potter 1 DVD and draw Pokemon.  Thanks for listening.  Does this make any sense? Kathy

      No Adrian dreams, making for a day where I miss him even more than usual (how is that possible?).  Plus the sun is shining for the 3rd day in a row, which makes me feel more overwhelmed!  Don’t get me wrong, it is nice to see the snow covered mountains in the distance.  It’s just too bright outside and my mood does not match the weather!  Today Rebecca’s school has a family picnic that I’m completely dreading.  I’ll go at 11.30 to eat lunch with her 2nd grade class then volunteer from 12 to 1 pm.   I’m sorry I offered to volunteer but it means a lot to Rebecca.  I do end up meeting such nice people (we’re still new to the school, just started this year, what a year to start!) and volunteering is always better than I imagine.  Still the idea of being around festive people really makes me sick to my stomach.  On the walk to the bus stop this morning I said to Rebecca “the picnic might be hard for you with other dad’s there”.  And she said, (bless her heart) “mommy I’ll be fine, daddy is always here with me every day.”  Statements like that really help me.    Kids manage grief so differently that adults, where it is all consuming.  Plus I often say to Rebecca what special times she had with her dad and how much good time they got together.  I think she too appreciates the fun 5 years after he recovered from cancer.  Also I’ve other things planned today that feel overwhelming.  A person is coming over at 10 to prepare for our hardwood floor refinishing (only reason I’m doing that is insurance and I’m sure Adrian would want the floors fixed if we have the chance) because when Adrian first went into the hospital in September we had a mini-flood that damaged our already worn floor.  Anyway this person is too cheerful, and that makes me sick too.  I really don’t care about the floors, but know this needs to be done.  Then I’ll do my usual work out at the Y.  Forcing myself yet I always feel better after, but it’s all so overwhelming without Adrian.    Also when I read about Tienamen Square 15 years ago, Adrian and I had the TV on to that when we were moving into the house.  We were so appalled, naturally, but I feel this awful stomach punch every time I think of it, not only did all those people die, but Adrian is gone too.  I’ll be ok, really, or so I keep telling myself.  I do feel Adrian’s spirit with me; I just wish we had more time together.  But his body gave out and lasted longer than anyone could’ve imagined.  I'm grateful for what we had!  Thanks for listening. Do you think I can make it ok? Kathy

      Awoke with a headache and no dreams of Adrian. Dreamed that at my former job (retail days) I was put in charge of ‘Security’ which I didn’t want.  Well that’s the truth in reality; Adrian provided me with such a good feeling of security, now I must do it alone. Feel really sad that Adrian is not here.  15 years ago we officially started our life together in this house and damn he is not here.     While Adrian was a 5-year cancer survivor, one of the things I did was circle editorials that we talked about when he got home from work.  We had some great discussions.  Below is something I found on-line (only get Sunday paper now) I would’ve highlighted and sort of helps me feel better now:  From Paul Krugman of the New York Times from June 2 about Bush’s lousy fiscal policy: “Of course, voters would never support this agenda if they understood it. That's why dishonesty -- as illustrated by the administration's consistent reliance on phony accounting, and now by the business with the budget cut memo -- is such a central feature of the White House political strategy."  Makes me feel better this is being written, but why aren’t people listening?  It's true, the bush admin says one thing and does the opposite.  And then this portion from a Letter to the Editor in the PI on June 2 about the war is spot on:  “For the cost of just one week of the Iraq war we could build eight $100 million energy research centers and staff those with 2,000 scientists making $200,000 per year. Doesn't it make more sense to do that rather than continue with a policy that creates more terrorists and that does nothing to solve our oil addiction? “ Tom Leurquin, Bainbridge Island  I get upset about how much money is spent in Iraq, what about education and helping the needy?  Ok and one other bumper sticker I read yesterday that actually made me laugh (a rarity believe me): “Campaign 2004: End of an Error”  Get it?!  Very good huh?  Lets hope, I'm not so sure.  Ok this has helped me feel marginally better.  Still overwhelmingly sad, but the world moves while I feel life has stopped.  Thanks for reading.

      I’m surprisingly doing better today.  No specific Adrian dreams, but I did dream that people tried to change my home after Adrian’s death.  Verbally I fought hard to keep his memory alive and I awoke feeling so much better!    I guess I got out some of my frustration through that dream?  More importantly, even though I'm barely functioning, I have this feeling that I’m doing everything I can to honor Adrian's memory.  That is so important to me.  Also a big key to my (temporary) feeling better today: 15 years ago Adrian and I moved into this house!  We were so pleased to have watched it be built over a 5-month period (well I had the builders fix all the mistakes!) We got settled within a week  because Adrian’s brother planned to make the 6,000 mile journey (what a great trip, Claire was 5, Lizzy only 2, we drove to Vancouver BC to pick them up).     We also got married in our home, 15 years ago September.   Today I’m looking at our house as though it's new and remembering how happy we were to have our own home.  Well Adrian was much more quiet about it than I was, I did all the jumping for both of us.  Yes I’m remembering the good, the happy times.  There were many despite the havoc diabetes created for Adrian’s body.  Rebecca is actually being nice today, the sun is shinning (I did a good hour of yard work, mostly weeding, but why aren't the bamboo and acubas planted in honor of Adrian growing?). I feel sort of happy, well aside from the big pit in my stomach knowing it’s been 9 months since Adrian hasn’t been home.  How can it be, no he is at work and about to walk through the door and greet us!  Thanks for listening.   Kathy

      Of all the coincidences, I don't believe it!  I just did a google search on "Anna Karenina" my newest book that I got for $1 at our neighborhood garage sale.  I'm on page 140 and wanted some insight and commentary.  Well turns out Oprah just picked it for her book club!  I don't believe it, because I thought I was being so terrific reading an old classic on my own.  Now millions of others will read it too, not that that is bad, just that it was my idea first!  (Amazing how grief makes one regress).  Guess I'm ahead of the ball game, in one element of my life.  This book will take me all of June because the print is too small to read while I cycle.  Just thought I'd share as reading (oh and raising Rebecca myself!) is the main thing I've been doing while adjusting to the absurdity of life without Adrian.  Thanks Kathy

      No dreams of Adrian directly, but did have an action-suspense dream about writing a book on pedophiles (of all horrible things).  So by no coincidence I feel horrible today (this first day of June) even if I awoke and felt Adrian's spirit with me.  Starting yet another month without Adrian.  He's been physically out of our home for 9 months (on Sept 1st he'd just been admitted to the hospital and I figured home in a few days).  Gulp, that’s very hard.  A baby takes 9 months to develop.  But 9 months without the one you love does not create a new self.  I don’t want to live without Adrian.  I will, don't get me wrong.  Nine months, I don’t like this, but it is the way it is.  And 5 years ago we were just back from Hawaii and appreciating our lives together and with Rebecca.  Adrian was learning to walk, but possibly driving to work on his own, maybe not.  We had 5 good years, really good.  Last June Adrian was alive!  I was working part time at the school and Adrian was seemingly fine.  I remember him frustrated with work b/c they had moved his team to the factory.  Our relationship was great as I’d lost 20 pounds and felt wonderful.  Now thankfully I’m 10 pounds less even, but the hole in front of me is too huge to think of even tomorrow.  Thanks for listening. Do I make any sense? Kathy

      This was in a "Letters to the Editor" in the PI, and ordinarily Adrian and I would talk about this, agreeing completely:  "I applaud, no, I offer a standing ovation to former Vice President Al Gore for Wednesday's courageous speech and clarion call to oust the Bush administration's parade of fools in their inept and disastrous handling of situations in the Middle East and their sinister activities to subvert the Constitution and Bill of Rights.   It is about time we all woke up from the shock of 9/11 and the subsequent attack on America from Oval Office fanatics that have left those of us who can think on our feet awestruck by their hubris, their doctrine of hate and their complete lack of leadership.   I can only hope that this may signal an awakening in us all to act now and in November before they bring the entire country to ruin, which certainly seems to be their plan. Way to go, Al."

      Hello all from Gsy!!&nbsp;&nbsp;   This is the first trip of 7 that I'm not jet lagged!&nbsp; Must be b/c I'm used to feeling miserable, or b/c Adrian isn't tossing and turning next to me in bed, I can actually sleep.   I love it here, so incredibly beautiful, takes my breath away.&nbsp;&nbsp; I've no energy, tho I do take a short walk to the sea every day.   For Adrian's ashes, we're just playing it by ear based on weather.&nbsp; Much more to say, but I'm using Martyns broadband (and it's late, Rebecca wants to leave) as Sue only has dial up and limited access, ugh.&nbsp; So I'll be way behind on email.&nbsp; Thats ok, whatever I'm trying to say.&nbsp;   must go.&nbsp; I'm still nervous about being away from home 4 weeks, but we got here.&nbsp; Physically getting here far easier (yet still a bitch) than emotionally.&nbsp; I'm shattered about Adrian, but the scenery and family help alot.&nbsp; Be well all.&nbsp; Kathy

      In honor of my beloved husband Adrian, I’m writing briefly.&nbsp; On this 15th of July, 10 months to the date since he died, I’m doing all I can to keep Adrian‘s love and memories alive, while I get ready for our 6,000 mile journey to his home, Guernsey.   Ten months ago today, I held Adrian’s hand, told him how deeply I loved him, and then, after an hour, let him go.&nbsp; Our love still echo’s clearly, beautiful from that last moment.  &nbsp;  I see Adrian’s gifts everywhere: from the 2,000-pound ($3,600) UK bereavement benefit to the surprise $280 eyeglass coverage.&nbsp; From the ease of packing for only me to 3 new framed prints (one, Adrian’s last gift now brightens our hallway).&nbsp; From the trees to the flowers, from the sun to the rain, everywhere, with me, here, I just can’t ‘see’ with my eyes (which gets incredibly frustrating).&nbsp;&nbsp;   Surprisingly I feel our love still growing (I couldn’t have guessed that 10 months ago).&nbsp; Comforting thoughts for all those who’ve loved and lost.   Time to pack, easier physically this year, but emotionally rough.&nbsp; I’ll be gone 4 weeks, lots being done to the house: new floors (covered by insurance) and new doors (covered by Adrian’s providing for us, we've talked about&nbsp;this for years).   I’ll come back to our comforting Pacific Northwest home, as long as  we fire Bush in November!   &nbsp;  I’ve so many good memories of Adrian and our time together. &nbsp; He’s still here with us, listen, I can hear him.&nbsp; You too can feel the love of those that have died; they still guide you and are with you, they don’t have physical bodies, but their energy is here.   Ten months ago today, my love left his body but gained a spirit that’s free to roam the universe. Love is eternal.&nbsp; I feel corny and sappy.&nbsp; But Adrian made my life wonderful.&nbsp; He still influences my every living moment.  &nbsp;  Back to packing (goal is done Friday and Sat take Harry to the kennel).&nbsp; I’ll blog from Guernsey once we’re settled.&nbsp; I leave Seattle Saturday night, get to see Rebecca Sunday morning (I apprehensively say goodbye to 2 weeks of freedom and no real parent responsiblity) in Cleveland, fly off to Gatwick (London) Sunday night, arrive Gatwick at 7am Monday, spend 4 hours in the airport, then take a small commuter airplane to the island, and then arrive Guernsey at 1pm.&nbsp; Can't wait!!&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Really looking forward to taking Adrian's ashes home.&nbsp; Looking forward to the ocean, to being with family, to the dramatic scenery, to seeing Tina and her family, to meeting Martyn's new wife, to everything really.&nbsp; I'm so full of love&nbsp;because of&nbsp;Adrian.&nbsp; Thank you for listening!&nbsp;        Love to all, Kathy

      I’m free!  Rebecca, Heather, and my mom flew off late Saturday night and returned home to Cleveland (Ohio).  My last update a week ago, surprisingly time is flying.  Another brief moment at the computer, I’ve actually been having summer fun, which is amazing really.    Today is 10 months since Adrian was last home, 10 months on the 15th that he peacefully died.  Yet it’s comforting to feel that he’s still here with us.  I feel his spirit all around and see so many signs that he's here, just on ‘the other side’.  As my darling 15 year old niece, Heather, said (as we were looking at pictures on the computer) “everyone loved Uncle Adrian.”  Yep that about sums up his warm and generous nature!  I’ve got a wonderful 2 weeks ahead where I get a break on my parenting responsibilities.  Ever so gratefully Rebecca is on her annual 2-week visit with Grandma Donna, going to day camp in lovely Cleveland Ohio.  What a relief for me, what a great break!!!    As much as I love Rebecca, wow do I need some space (single parenting is rough)!!!  It’s a relief to breathe and remember Adrian and get things done and loose weight and go slow and leave the windows open and the candles burning...  I feel like a teenager with the house to myself.  I love being a parent, but I also love getting a break.  Last night I read this in my favorite grief book:  Our Loved Ones Become a Part of Us .  This nails it, said by Helen Keller, “ What we have once enjoyed deeply we can never loose.  All that we love deeply becomes a part of us .”  That phrase gives me so much strength.  The page goes on to say “ the essence of who they are is the legacy we carry into the future. ”  I can only hope that I can carry Adrian’s legacy of love into the future (so often uncertain about my ablities there).  Also at the end of each page is a related saying which helps me a lot:  “…my loved one is with me.  We are joined and intertwined forever .”  Isn’t that beautiful?  That’s how I feel (though I sometimes need to push myself firmly in that direction).    Thats all for now. I must be off to shower, throw ball 100 times to Harry, work out (it’s been a whole week, I’m in so need of a gym visit), meet a friend for   Fahrenheit 9/11  , get my cell phone replaced (yikes new technology while I’m grieving) and go out to dinner.    I’m having fun, really I am, and as I’ve said above I have the deep comforting feeling that Adrian’s love is still with me (though I'd give anything to have him back with us).   Later, Love Kathy
