         No i didn't take part. i don't look like an aquathon-er anyway do i? Lilian and me went to blade, yes.. we went to blade when there's a freakin aquathon on the same day. But we didn't know! Too late.. we were already there right? so might as well go and check out the place.. maybe not the whole beach closed ma, being ever the hopefuls we are.  So we decided to chuck all our stuff, blades included into the lockers and trek down the beach to see where is blocked for the run, with camera in hand. Our first photo of the day..    urlLink     and then we went further down to the NZ ice cream/sakae sushi/billabong beachfront area.. quite nice and quiet now coz not totally ready, only NZ ice cream and billabong open   urlLink      urlLink     We realised the road is not closed lor, the marshalls anyhow say.. people still cycling and walking and pushing prams yes BABY PRAMS. But we still walk la coz wanted to go to 7-eleven. Then we saw a handsome! haha never take picture la. so paisay. So we walk walk 2 more mins and decided to turn back and take our blades (not because of the guy hor, because we wanted to blade and by now we walk very far already)  Then we FINALLY started blading. We very fit yesterday also.. we walk up and down then still blade from siloso to tanjong beach and back TWICE ley and in between still from dolphin lagoon go back tanjong another time. Then we stopped at 7-e on the way back and carry our blades and walk back.. like carrying two weights.. good la..tone my arms sial..and really today i weigh myself lose 1 kg! Must do this every week already got motivation haha. And we saw handsome 2 more times while blading woo! Funny thing is..i dreamt of him last nite..with 2 dark kids..pushing them on a trolley no less! me and my silly dreams haha!  Then because of the aquathon right..millions of ppl..and u know girls take millions of years to bathe and beautify themselves right..the bathing queue was damn long lor! so we went to lie on the beach and nua a bit (almost fall asleep haha) then bathe. nua finish also still got queue! so we went to eat.. at TRAPIZZA!    urlLink     Our yummy inferno pizza :) with thin crust! my fav   urlLink     Ya i know i eat pizza very unglam la..thats y i always use fork and knife!   urlLink     Especially when u look at the next picture..lilian eat pizza with hands still can look nice    urlLink     In the end hor.. i did something i NEVER thought i would do. We never bathe. gross right? After we blade and walk and lie on the sand somemore. But bo bian! after we finished eating the queue is STILL long lor, if we waited..9+ still in sentosa.   You would think we go home straight and bathe right? Get ourselves clean..but no..we actually went to the MANGO sale! at Orchard somemore! haha.. and tried on clothes (horror!) but i bought 2 out of 3 pieces i tried hor. But you see..that's why i ALWAYS wash new clothes before i wear them  MOS strawberries to reward ourselves after our "fit" day!   I love this picture! haha! sorry lilian!   urlLink     ****  Later that nite we went to the airport to fetch David.. at 235am. There was this FREAKIN IRRITATING ANG MOH at the arrival hall walking around with his girlfriend shouting his bloody head off. "WHERE ARE THE LOCKERS? LOOOCCCKKK-KKERRRSSS. Oh i don't think they understand simple english.. LOCCCCKKKERRRSSS CAN ANYONE TELL ME WHERE ARE THE LOCKERS????"  wah lao. damn irritating lor. Who the hell knows where he put his freakin luggage!! then he shouted loudly "SINGAPORE IS SHIT" like 3 times and then he and the girlfriend disappeared. He just bulldozed through everyone shouting like a madman! I should have taken a picture and sent it to the Newpaper, and maybe can win handphone somemore. I feel so embarrassed for his girlfriend. If i had a boyfriend like that i'd smack him upside down already.

        Didn't go swimming after all, postpone to next week. Instead i went out with Deb and Lil to nua and walk around.. what else is there to do in Singapore right? Squeezed in a little shopping, OP got 20% storewide..so i bought this cute little pink bag :)      urlLink      Happens that the stuff i like lately are all pink... happy coincidence?   So after hanging around Raffles city and Citylink for a while..(we're there every week cos church is just next door) we decided to go to the Esplanade to take some nice pictures.. and we came across this     urlLink       Some sorta art display.. a window display full of cotton.. seems like anything and everything is called ART these days.. interesting nevertheless.. Deb starting talking about playing in the cotton box like those "ball rooms" we use to jump about in when we were kids. Err.. i can only imagine the cotton in your mouth.  We hung around Marina park a bit trying to catch some dragonboat action.. unfortunately (didn't get to see any tall tanned hunks. boo!)..or fortunately (weather's too damn hot. can't do w/o AIRCON la)..whichever way u look at it.. we didn't.. Instead we rushed to catch the bus down to Harbourfront to meet Lilian.. and began nua-ing in AIR CON comfort (What else did u expect?)  We basically just parked ourselves on the armchairs at Mac's and took photos and did some synchronised glaring back at ppl who dared stare at us haha     urlLink      Guess who's who.. too dark right..and i can't lighten the photo..it just ends up getting orangey no matter what i do    urlLink        urlLink      Trying to see how big we can open our eyes.. but the only thing we succeed in doing is making our eyebags look bigger! Gosh.. it's a losing battle to get rid of them!  Notice how the photos have a nice cosy feel to them? (Actually i off the flash coz i thought otherwise too BRIGHT/WHITE..but now too dark.. I REALLY need to get more familiar with my cam's modes sial)   Damn sian..tmr gotta work.. and i wanna watch Spain vs Portugal tonite. what to do what to do?

         Woke up at 430pm today, damn shiok haha! really feels so good to wake up and have the luxury of lying around in bed.. not rushing to get up n ready for work.  I went shopping with my mom and sis today.. and got ANOTHER pair of shoes! heh.. my sixth pair this month.. i would have gotten another pair if not for my budget constraints.. gotta hang on til next sat PAYDAY  Realised after reading the article that day about ppl buying antennas to receive msia channels to watch EURO matches..that my tv CAN receive msia channels relatively clear haha! So i CAN watch soccer after all!   ***

        I'm so bored today. Went for a course in the afternoon and it ended at 430pm..but then everyone's working..no one to hang out with.. so i came home lor.. my life is so boring! Fri nite stuck at home..*big sigh*   Have no new pictures to post today.. except.. my new shoes ahaha! Only $14.90 from Charles and Keith.. adorable right! in nice pink :)    urlLink      Thinking of signing up for hip hop dance lessons at amore.. $180 for 3 months, 12 lessons with Kaili, quite reasonable. Need some form of exercise man.. too long never go blading.. wait til Sentosa renovate finish.. I miss blading.. i think i put on 2 kg.. damn jialat. Saturday must go and swim and tan.. laze around by the poolside at Kaili's condo.. our favourite activity, lazing around haha~   I wanto go to the Linkin Park concert this tues at the Padang..but the worst thing is.. NO ONE GO WITH ME!!! and i can't possibly go alone right. Last year when they went to KL i was telling myself if they come to Singapore i SURE go.. then now end up never go also. None of my friends seem to like Linkin Park enough to wanto spend $85 to see them in concert :( HAIZ

         Finally got in on the blogging craze. Wasn't even remotely interested in blogging when it started getting popular.. but yet.. here i am now  I'm still not sure why i would want total strangers to read and see photos about my life.. but hey.. seems fun :P since i like to rant and complain a lot hee  Just got a new digicam last week and i've gone crazy taking silly pictures of myself the whole week.     urlLink       Yes i realise i always tilt my head to my right when taking individual shots, and yes i DO know my left from right..it's a mirror image coz of the swivel feature of my cam.  This one's done using the multiple exposure mode, i went around super-imposing my face on lotsa stuff haha!     urlLink       A photo of me trying to look sweet! haha! Everyone says i look very dao, so..i gotta try to look less dao right!     urlLink       okay.. er.. i think thats basically all the nonsense i can think of right now haha.. so..how do i end this post.. oh well.. bye?

They have all sorts of quirky and fun gifts, accessories and what nots (and no, they do not pay me to advertise).  Guess what this is? It's a lamp! Looks like something stolen from a physics lab doesn't it?      Glam Girl glasses     Glass Balloons!!      Another lamp, the colour's reallly pretty don't you think?

         Didn't go sentosa today cos i'm sick. So here i am resting at home in front of my computer eating my new Blackmores lozenges. It's really nice! Bit ex at $8 for 24 lozenges, but it's worth it. Tastes like honey and it doesn't numb your tongue like most others do.   Anyway since i'm stuck at home with nothing much to do, i decided to take a quiz at  urlLink Quizilla .    Which movie do you belong in?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla    The Fight Club?!?!?!?!? HAHAHAHHA! According to this i hide my insecurities with mean words and toughness, and i break all the rules!! whoaaa  Heh, tough girl me is going to read Her World now, tata!

        New blogskin! I love this picture! i saw it on the cover of this magazine "Island destinations" and i HAD to buy it, just for the cover, to use in my blogskin haha! The contents quite boring tho, it's not a "fun" travel guide but a boring one, imagine that.  I saw this outfit in CLEO mag and i  absolutely  love it!       but i can't buy it.. you know why? because it costs $369!! Hai..wonder how much it would cost to tailor something similar though..  Went blading again yesterday, but quite nua, but nevertheless, covered quite a bit. We ended up eating at Trapizza again.     yes, me without makeup and with my horrible eyebags..sigh  This time, we tried their pasta       Smoked salmon with "a dash of vodka", and it really was a "dash" coz we couldn't taste the vodka at all haha! But i think we'll stick to pizzas from now on, coz the pasta really ex wor. We ordered that one pasta and after ++ it was $21   After that we wanted to go to Wild Wild Wet in Pasir Ris, so we didn't bathe (seems to be the habit now eew!), coz no point right, later get wet again. In the end we didn't go coz it closes at 7pm then by the time we reached there would be 5+. So..next week then go.     cool picture huh? reflection from the mrt glass    Ended up going to the airport to take photos since we had time to spare. The stupid viewing gallery in T2 was shortened so much due to some construction works that it was just plain silly. So many ppl somemore. T1 viewing mall was much better           wonderful angle of the plane hor? haha! Plane butt.

I *really* miss those days in the old house when the computer was in MY ROOM, can use anytime anyday in aircon comfort. Now.. HAIZ... I'll do it this Sunday, coz i normally wake up earlier than him ahha!  This week has been a "weird" week of ex-es, they just keep appearing! First i saw my first ex at PS, then yest my last ex called me out for drinks, and lately my almost ex has been messaging me. I should be meeting "new" men, not old ones! haha  ***  Bought the Kose Sekkisei Masks today! Can't wait to try it out, my mom bought for me actually, but i think i have to pay her back.. sigh.. $60.. i *really* should stop spending money.. i need to save up for my year end Aussie trip to visit fen! And then there's my CFA registration in Sept..which is going to cost me USD 600.. and the textbooks.. oh gosh.. i don't wanto think about it. i think i gotta lock myself up at home.. go home straight after work everyday, eat at home save money.

         Went for the wedding at the Singapore Art Museum today, never actually been inside before, so today's a first time. The glass house place is really very nice, the foood was there haha. The wedding was held at the chapel like place on the second floor, which had a glass wall thingy that i really liked   urlLink     The wedding was really very sweet, i teared a little. Quite paisay la, somemore not say my sister or daughter getting married haha! but then i cry very easily one la.    urlLink      urlLink      And this! haha! giant abacus. Saw this later that nite at C.A.N cafe i think they changed name now to what christy and dunno what but same thing la.. really like the place, cosy and nice drinks and lotsa rubbish interesting stuff to look at haha   urlLink     I realise most ppl dunno how to take photos with digicam properly.. u actually must press halfway and hold 1 to 2 secs to let the camera focus then press fully down. Otherwise the photos will not be very sharp lor. Then everytime ask ppl take photos for us always they dunno how to do then will be a bit off one, u see those ppl take one hor.. can see it's not sharp. damn sian.  542am now, im going to sleep the whole sunday and wake up go for the wedding dinner. woo! can't wait, the sleeping i mean. I love to sleeep in :)

Would have stayed overnite if not for my auntie (actually my mom's cousin..so sorta auntie la..26 only..not very auntie hor) church wedding.. @ Singapore Art Museum ley.. I wonder where got space right? Or.. more importantly.. where to park?   We didn't bring enough wine and liquor to the chalet.. finished all the wine quite quickly, then liquor only got 1 bottle cordon bleu. Not even high.. but also good la right..coz later got wedding to attend.   I really like my colleagues lor..everyone's so fun and friendly. Very comfortable environment. Office got cases of wine and liquor somemore, after 6 open wine heh. What more can i ask for right? Err..wait.. actually yeah i could do with higher salary! ahhaha.  I realised something.. today's post is very singlishy.. maybe coz it's 3am and i woke up at 620am this morning thats why.. grammar goes out the window  No pictures today.. tomorrow! Photos @ the wedding :) wearing my new Guess dress! hahaha! Ever since get digicam everything is a photo opp.  I think i better go and sleep before i start rambling.. or have i already..  ***

         My weekend was quite good heh :) Like tai tai life.. go for massage, shopping, eating, facial ahhaha whoaaa. EXCEPT no rich husband pay for me la :P   Saturday   Went for a full body massage, scrub and steam bath. Wasn't quite as relaxing as i hoped it would be, quite painful at times. I could do without it. Probably expectations too high, you know you always see those nice advertisements in magazines, newspapers etc where the surroundings is nice lush forests or the sea, looks so good and relaxing right? Maybe if u really go to those places for massage is much much better..but mine was alright only la.  After my massage i joined my mom and sis in Orchard to shop somemore! But didn't buy much, only a shirt and skirt from Zara. The skirt is really pretty! no pictures now though coz i'm in the office heh.. Also bought a bag for my mom for her birthday coming up next month.    Sunday   Woke up super early.. 7am on a Sunday morning.. haiyoh.. but no choice.. my sister's confirmation at the 930am service at Victoria Concert Hall.. and she has to be there at 8am..    urlLink     After lunch my mom and I went shopping again. This time i bought a dress from M)phosis and a skirt from Esprit. The Esprit skirt that time i saw it i already like it a lot but then $89 so i didn't buy.. $89 for a skirt damn ex can. then now 50%! You say must buy or not?? hehe By the end of the day my feet really ah.. damn pain.. cannot walk already.. too tired from 2 whole days of shopping.   Monday   Back to work..wah damn tired.. slept in the train..almost fell asleep while working. Then after work i went for facial.. painless facial!! haha. They use some aroma or essential oils thingy and supposed to "cleanse from within" so they don't steam open your pores to squeeze. They will only extract those blackheads which "come to the surface already", minimal pain only..i can tahan. So i signed up for 5 facials interchangeable with body massage. Compared to the MTM facial i went to the other time..this is much better. The MTM one damn pain..i kept tearing and the stupid light damn bright make my eyes very pain also. Although i have to say after the MTM facial your skin really feels VERY smooth, and the room is very cosy but it's too damn ex to go on a regular basis la. $290 for a facial ley. Heart pain thinking about it.  Photo of my new Chanel Glossimer! Pretty right! :) and new "bra" haha i wonder how it feels like.. haven't "worn" it yet.. will do for my aunt's church wedding this sat with my new dress. To no more strapless bras and feeling "freeeee" hahaha   urlLink

         Yes i'm spending Friday night at home AGAIN. hai.. This is becoming a habit.. not out of choice though. No one ask me out! haiya. Damn sad right. I'll just watch tv and read my magazines.. watch The Bachelor.. but aiyoh this Bachelor Bob.. i really don't understand why America's ladies voted for him to be the next bachelor..i mean..he's not even very eligible isn't it, compared to the previous few. And the next Bachelorette is Meredith from this Bachelor season *faints* Angmoh tastes and ours (or maybe just mine haha) really different. I mean.. Look at American Idol 3.. didn't really think Fantasia is all that great..but the Americans are like raving about her all the time.. and we're like HUH?? Oh well.. On the bright side.. Amazing race is coming back! My all time favourite reality show heh.  *****  Took leave yesterday to go shopping..  ZARA sale started! but then hor.. nothing much ley.. the nice ones only sale that $10-$20 dollars then still very ex.. then the few pieces that are cheap are damn ugly. Hope they slash prices somemore.  I bought lotsa stuff from Topshop though hehe :) and French Connection, and Chanel, and Blush! i bought the bra thingy which adheres to your clothes. No more strapless bras! woohoo! Strapless bras are soooo uncomfortable..they  always  feel like their falling off.   I have some pictures of my buys to post..but i'm too lazy to transfer them to my comp.. so.. no pictures today. But you know..since i got my digicam and started blogging.. I've got this urge? okay maybe thats too strong a word..but i always feel like taking pictures..haha.. of everything and anything and everyone.. but i guess that's normal right? For all blog owners? Maybe there's an exhibitionist streak in everyone! haha! We're putting photos and talking about our daily lives and happenings up onto the Internet.. letting the whole wide world of mostly strangers  in on your life. And then we're also kaypos.. coz we like to read other ppl's blogs!

         yup, it's a LONG weekend for me.. as you can see..it's tues and i'm at home blogging.. i'm on MC again. but more on that later. Kinda like a rollercoaster weekend.  Friday started off good, was thinking of going home early and have an early night kinda thing, lazy to go out la. Then my colleague wanted to have dinner, so went walk walk a bit then go eat coz we were v full from our dim sum lunch. Ended up having the dinner buffet at Kushinbo at Suntec. Really very good! But then didn't eat as much as we wanted too coz not that hungry.. haiya.. then those lobsters for first 20 always by the time we reach there the queue already so long. next time must reserve a table inside! After dinner we went to the hotel lounge at swissotel for drinks, then sit there chit chat til 12+  Saturday was my mom's birthday so we went to Harbour City restaurant or something like that for the a la carte buffet dinner. They have this fried honeydew thingy with milk..wah damn nice haha.  Sunday, went out with Michael and we basically just drove around with no place to go.. went to labrador park walk 1 round, went to this park outside his house sit n chat a bit, then he sent me to Alex's place for the bbq. So weird right..i mean.. just drive around the entire afternoon!! Hai..  And here's the worst part lor.. I brought a bottle of Baileys and Absolut Kurant to Alex's place.. at first thought cannot drink coz his auntie like not v happy. And i was bored throughout la..coz..not v close to most of the ppl there except a few, plus i was feeling a bit sian to start with, so didn't really mingle much. Later on we started drinking hor, didn't drink too much, but dunno y on the way home i felt v terrible already like wanto puke..then the moment i reach my gate fumbling for my keys i puked lor. Then a while later i puked again..damn jialat rite!? i never puked before from alcohol ok! Then i was quite scared also..like..oh no..my liver!   then next morning woke up, for 2 hours i cannot move.. like move a bit wanto puke like that. Then i really buay tahan i call my mom come home bring me see doctor.. Then.. get off the car at the airport i puke again. Damn gross can. Turns out it's food poisoning and not the alcohol. So the doctor gave me a jab and some medicine for stomach cramps and muscle pain.  What a great conclusion to a long weekend huh? So here i am.. stuck at home again.. eating plain porridge.. and i already lost 1 kg from all that puking and not eating. Supposed to go for facial today..but had to cancel.. wah i cancel and change my appointment so many times already, i hope they don't boycott me.  On a brighter note, i booked my ticket to sydney already!! So excited about the trip.. it's in Nov so i have plenty of time to plan hehe. But im damn broke now l0r, after buying my ticket..im going to starve for the next few months til my trip!!

         Our plan was to have a bbq at marina south and see the fireworks at the same time. BUT, as usual, brandon was LATE. and his late is always VERY LATE. so, at 8pm, when the fireworks was supposed to start, we were stuck in traffic outside the Carrefour carpark exit, and we had to settle for viewing the fireworks display from the car, partially blocked by the Ritz. Sianz right. I had to wind down the window and sort of lean out to take pictures, but good thing i managed to get some decent shots :)                        By the time we reached marina south and found a nice ulu and pretty corner along the sea, it was already 9 plus! But it was quite a nice place, next time can go there blade even haha!   The cute little bbq pit which Brandon and Lilian bought for $12, it's a totally identical but miniature version of my pit!      Our yummy food which lilian seasoned and the guys helped to prepare. Lilian is really very good with food, we keep telling her to start a catering business hehe         *****   Today Karen and I took leave to take graduation photos together, because we didn't take any together when we graduated last year, since different day convocation. She brought her bf Matthew's tripod and very pro camera. The two of us look damn pro can, adjusting this and that, carrying 2 huge cameras and a tripod walking all around city hall haha!  Our very first photo     Pretty little fountain         I think this is really cool rite! haha i even wanted to hold the tap, but a bit paisay i scared kena scolded by the staff haahaha     We have more photos taken in our convo gowns, but those in Matthew's camera, haven't developed the film yet, will post them up after their ready.  So anyway, we decided that since it was so hot in the gowns, we shall just take in chjimes in the gown, then we go take photos in our normal clothes at the esplanade. I mean..imagine if we walk all the way from chjimes to esplanade in our gowns, with tripod and all that? And its too troublesome to take off and put on again.  Singapore's cityscape actually not bad hor     This lion is so funky! haha      Different angles of the "durian"     I think this is a really nice angle     A bit dark, but the trees are really quite cute      Sunset     Alright, time to zzz.. gotta work tomorrow.. how i wish i was on leave the whole week like Karen

         Fridays i always no mood to work, spent most of the afternoon surfing the net for ticket prices, hot air balloon companies, and bridgeclimb price.. everything so ex wor! Somemore i travelling alone, ticket more ex, coz most promos are for min 2 travellers. Anyone going to Sydney end year??? But then, my colleague's sister works in a travel agency, so he's helping me to see if got any promotions, so hopefully, i can get a ticket for less than $800. Royal Brunei is $760 incl taxes and surcharges BUT minimum 2 ppl, you say sian or not?! But i so long never go for a real long holiday that im really quite excited preparing and planning for the trip haha!  My colleagues are all so nice, i always get free meals and drinks til i really quite paisay. We went to Villag'e during lunch and coz OCBC credit cards got 15%, my colleague signed first, then she say don't need to pay her back. Then at night we went to this place to see some salsa dancing and my other colleague bought quite a few tequila shots for me. I think next week i really must treat them lunch. Better do so now while i still have some money, otherwise mid month will be broke again.  I'm  still  sick.. not sure if the tequilas made my cough worse, but i woke up in the middle of the night, or morning..645am to be precise, coughing and coughing non stop for at least an hour. It was so horrrible, the minute i stopped coughing i could feel another cough coming up. On the bright side, my eyes seem to be getting better. The infection started on Tues, so its Saturday now.. hopefully on Mon will be 100% recovered and i can wear my contacts, or at least not red or swollen can already. Mon take leave go take photos! hee  So anyway, supposed to go for dim sum lunch with my mom, aunties and baby laeticia, but somehow, my mom was busy and we didn't go. I can sleep longer, woke up at 3pm, just nice to bathe and change go meet podders at Cartel PS. Shall leave you with some photos of the gathering.. need to zzzz.. nite!
