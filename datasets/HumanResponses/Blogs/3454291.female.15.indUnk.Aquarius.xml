      oh yes! last night was so great! ok so yesterday at about noon (i woke up at 10, so what seemed early to me, was really later haha) or so i saw sarahs away message asking if anyone wanted to come and i was like HECK YA! so just an hour-ish before i had to leave for my orthodontist appointment, we figured everything out. so then i left for my appt. and then right afterwards, i had like 10 minutes at home or something then i left to sarahs house. then we hung out then her friends ben and brian picked us up and drove us to del mar where the concert was. we got pretty good seats and the concert was great. maroon 5 was awesome and sarah knew ALL the songs haha so it was really fun! then afterwards we went to Chevys. then we drove home. it was tons of fun! it was a lot more fun than my bowling night.

      this morning was boring, then i went to amanda young's house and watched Chasing Liberty and ate ice cream, which was very fun and shes a really awesome person!  then at 7 i went to a church activity which was decently fun, even tho we were just making stuff for girls camp next week, but ya. and then afterwards me and aj and tahnee and scott and katie went bowling. it was decently fun i guess. but it was kinda pathetic how my moods changed within a few hours. at 8:45 when the guys picked up me and tahnee, i was so hyper and excited. then by like 10 something i was just depressed. it seems like guys only flirt with certain girls. i was kinda the 5th wheel and it sucked. i got home at 11, and its 11:10pm right now, and im just like... whatever... i dont even care anymore. but i dont really like being the 5th wheel. next time ill make sure what the situation is and maybe just say no......

      this morning i look at the news and find out that Paul M. Johnson Jr was killed (ya kno, the hostage in iraq or wherever). thats so sad. i hate when innocent people die, especially when its someone thats singled out individually and they have to live in suspense not knowing what'll happen for days before theyre killed. its horrible.  i went shopping with my mom today and then we watched Win A Date With Tad Hamilton. such a great movie...  the last couple nights ive been eating chocolate chips out of the bag. pathetic. did u kno that i read today that chocolate can help with PMS and doesnt cause pimples? so actually, chocolates a good thing!   oh ya, me and amber and tahnee hung yesterday. amber brought her CD of pics. so i went to her house a couple months ago or whenever and we took some pics. heres one of her lovely niece. she might look suicidal and insane here, but shes a pretty 4 year old.

      so at break, i wanted to get a pink lemonade but i only had a $10 bill in my wallet. so first i asked everybody at MoHill if they had $1 i could borrow. No body had a dollar. So i went to ask danny cuz i knew he was just around the corner. He didnt have a dollar and told me to just go to the food cart thing and get change. so i said fine and i went back to MoHill, got my wallet, and went to get change from the cart. so i got change and i went to a soda machine. it wouldnt take my dollar. so i walked to another one and finally i got my pink lemonade.

      Decided to start on a clean slate and just talk about what i love the most. Lately i've been into  urlLink Hudson River School  but I dont have their CD or anything, i just listen to the  urlLink ">HRSplayer  (its on my bookmarks). I also like  urlLink Hanson . Honestly, like last week or the week before i had this huge obsession with them.  urlLink Yellowcard  is also very good, and I had my little obsession with them, too.  urlLink Switchfoot  is an awesome band, my cousin Morgan got me into them. However, i'm totally off that obsession but they're still good. A wicked awesome group is  urlLink Straitaway , my friend's bro's band (but they're on a break for 2 years because 2 of the band members are going to be missionaries). Yep, i got an autographed CD for my birthday, the lead singer Cam autographed (ok so im friend with their families and i also got a free band t-shirt, im lucky haha). In addition, i'm also into  urlLink Hoobastank . Wonderful Davy burned me the CD. I used to like the song 'the reason' but it's old to me now, so im not as obsessed as everyone else is.  I could prolly come up with more great music, but i gotta leave like RIGHT NOW for a choir rehersal (it's tuesday and the concert is thursday and friday! i barely know the dances haha ya thats right, i sing AND dance)
