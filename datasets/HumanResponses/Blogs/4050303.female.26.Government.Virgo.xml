      Hi y'all,  Okay, this is officially my first time using the Blog. God, I hope there's spell check because I can't sepll without it :) I got the idea from Chris Wakelin (check out his Blog) a former colleague at LPC(O). He's super funny, so his blog is much more exciting than mine. Anyhow, I thought this was a good way to update people since we're all over the globe. I plan on putting funny stuff up and updates.  Later,  Shanna (aka. the ~~~~~)

      Hi y'all,  Okay...so I'm already stressing out about Halloween and what I am going to be. I know, I know - it's August 19th, but you can never be too prepared.  So, I address this to all the people that I will be hanging out Halloween night. I need 2 people other than myself - one to be an Ark, one to be a can and one to be a saw. Separately we are Ark-Can-Saw, but together we are Arkansas. Sounds awesome, eh?  Bill Clinton would be so proud!  Later,  The ~~~~~

      Hi y'all,  I'm eating a nectarine right now - yummy! You know, they totally kick peaches ass. See nectarines taste and look exactly like peaches but without all that nasty fuzz. It's like (and this is directed to all the ladies and gay men that read my blog) an ass without all the hair on it. Would you prefer a hairy ass or a smooth one? Exactly.

      They say that the first man a girl falls in love with is her father.  Although, I may be my father's third love - next to my grandmother and my mother, the bond between a father and a daughter is quite special. Unlike his first two, I am a product of his love and guidance. Thank you dad - for teaching me that it is okay to laugh at yourself, for living for the moment, for being able to speak my mind, for respecting myself and others, for teaching me family values and for humility. If it wasn't for you (and mom) I wouldn't be the woman I am today.  Am I daddy's little girl? Always.  Happy 60th Birthday Dad!  Love,  Shanna

      Hi y'all,  Last night after a Liberal function at the Fox and the Fiddle celebrating our "not-so-great" winning in the federal election, my work colleagues (she says in a Bridget Jones accent ) and I headed over to Hooters.  Monday night at the Hooters was all you can eat chicken wings. Which I don't entirely understand. You'd think that they would specialize more in chicken breast rather that chicken wings?????  Anyhow, being one of like 5 women there (not including the waitresses) , I feel it is my duty to share my experience with my sisters who have not set foot in this fine establishment.  Here are my following observations:  a) Any guy that says,  "But baby, I go there for the food"  is full of BULLSHIT. The food sucksass. b) "All you can eat" in Hooterville actually translates to: " You'll have to wait a dogs life time before you get your wings." c) The waitresses at Hooters don't have spectacular hooters. Not, to honk my own hooters, but they could give them a run for their money. Betty and Veronica can hold their own! d) They don't serve beer on tap on the patio - what's with that?

      Hi y'all,  It's the 12th Annual Left-Handers Day!  My people have come a long way over the years. I am reminded of those who have fought for our rights (I mean lefts - bad joke!) - Bill Gates, my dad, my grandmother, etc.  If you are righthanded, please I encourage you to walk on the otherside, use lefthanded scissors, place your mouse on the other side, etc. So that you will know the struggles of my people.  Now, if only we could work on a Small Handed Peoples Day! The world would be a better place....  Later,  The ~~~~~

      Hi y'all,  On Tuesday I went home and found a Purolator slip for me to pick up a package at the local postal office. My mind was wandering when I got the slip - Was it something from my parents? Was it something for my birthday? Couldn't be it's on September 17th. Was it anthrax? Was it underwear from Germany? (Don't ask. It's this mailing underwear thing I was part of.) Was it something from a stalker? (Please. I'm no Catherine Zeta-Jones)  So I went to the post office, stood in line for 15 minutes and my mind just wander some more. When I gave my slip, showed my ID, I finally picked up the package. You know what it was? Baby freak'n formula!?! Why the fuzz would baby formula be sent to me. I don't have a baby. I'm too young (bite your tongue) to be a mother. What do I know about babies???  So I went home and called my sister-in-law and asked her if she signed me up to pick up baby formula. But, how could that be? Katya is on the boob. She confirmed that she didn't order it.  Does anyone else think that is wierd? Is the god of "Hurry-up-your-clock-is- ticking" trying to tell me something? Please. I'm not even 30 yet!  Oh, I also thought of the case last week where the CIA found poison in baby food. Needless to say I threw out the package.  Later,  The ~~~~~~

      Hi y'all,  I dedicated this blog entry to Kevin Jacob (notsilla) - for his hard work and dedication to the Liberal Party.  For if it wasn't for him I would not know the meaning of Camel toe. (Is that two words btw?)  As some of you may know, I've been trying to be super active this summer. (Since last summer was a write off) As such I joined a rowing club and am learning how to row. Last Saturday I started my first lesson - at 8:30 in the morning NO DOUBT. (Take that Herman Ng!)  It was at the Argonout Rowing Club that learnt the number one rule in rowing was not that it is all in your legs, not the numerous safety types, not the techniques...but it's very important to sport your camel toe. I sported mine very proudly. Everyone was -guys and girls alike. Let's just say I know one of the instructors is circumsized. God, I love rowing!  To learn more about camel toe, type camel toe in google.  Later,  The ~~~~~~
