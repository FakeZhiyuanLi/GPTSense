       Hey,  I got my last exam coming up on monday (YYAYY). I finally get out of my dump of a school and out into the real world (not YYAYY) I finally arent 'attached' to anyone or anything anymore so thats a kinna relief from things, and it means that i can do my own thing without offending anyone in the process. I dont know if i want to be in anykind of 'thing' at the moment and to be honest i just wanna have my own time to relax after 11+ years of bloody educamactaion (i spelt that wrong on purpose)  DaveXXX

       Im abit bored so i though i would write this to let you know a little more about me and what i think.   -I am profoundly against war and conflict unless it is the only way to solve a problem -I like such music as Muse, Metalica, Iron Maiden, Kill Switch Engage, Fear Facotry, Switchfoot. -I hate falling out with people -I can be a late basturd when it comes to serious relationships and i can really screw it up (not a great advert for me really) -I like solving problems

       Hello,  Havent written anyhting in a while but here it goes i suppose  Its not a great day for me as ive fallen out with what i thought was a good friend. Little did i know that she then turned round and practically sed she hated me. So the moral of the story is that you shouldnt help people out and be kind to them if you dont fully trust them. and dont follow your heart if you dont know yourself as well as you would like  Ive nearly done my exams and im happy that very soon (3 more exams) and then ill be free and able to see my friends agian.  anyways ill add some more another time Dave XxXxX

       Today i found out that the girl i really like was messing with my head all this time. im pretty devistated but i think i can do without to be honest. Im listening to a realy old album of mine from bon jovi, i really think that some songs can really make u think about yourself and others aobut you. Just try nextime to listen and see if theres anything aobut your life that you can identify with.  Finding who you are has seemed really important to me inparticular and i think i have helped people with problems that they have had.  As you may not know, im a christian and i have been all my life

       Hey,  Im called Dave 16 years old and come from yorkshire. I decided to write this so that someone would find out about me even though they might not want to. At the moment im single and wish not to be, long brown hair, brown eyes and a bit of a individual (ie liking things my own way and being non-conformist and non-ordinary) My previous life has consisted of farrrr to many female friends.....but they are the best friends i cud ever ask for. So i wud like to say thanks to such friends as Kate and Ellie.I have good long term relationships with friends and prefer not to fall out with anyone so i am neutral in that respect.  Im doing my GCSE exams which im finding hard as im sure many other people out there are. So this is my first entry and i want to keep this up.  DAVE XXX

       Hello,  Aint wrote here for a while so i decided i gotta say somma sooner or later. Im well and i aint come up with any more sarcastic comments or and moans to the world......but im sure there will be some to come.&nbsp;I would like to say thanks to Dani for entering my last comment and to moaning at the moan i made last time, Keep it up Dani. Thanks to&nbsp;Clare as well, ive made a good home for&nbsp;her&nbsp;4 candels+stand, orange spray paint and Ikea light thingy which one of my weired freinds was jelous of.  Im going to Germany on sunday morning which is 2 days away. Im going with the York Youth Forum with 5 other people and we go for all the TV and Radio equipment so we can be on German TV and Radio. We get to use all the equipment whenever we want and we get to use professional recording studios and such like. The great thing is that its all payed for by the European Commission, God Bless Them, lol. We go for 2 weeks so i might send a blog from there just for the novelty of it all, im sad i know.  So ill write one then, but for now thats all

       When someone tries to find their 'inner self' and to try to discover who they are, what exactly do they mean? Everyone knows who they are, what their like and what their interests are by instinct, dont they? I know what i&nbsp;want to do and what i aspire to be...this didnt&nbsp;take me a long time to work out,&nbsp;its like a jigsaw puzzle designed for 5 year olds. all you need is to take you into account while making these desisons. Some people go as far as treking to the top of a mountain to find out what they want and expect from life, to find their 'inner-being'.  &nbsp; Even if i did find this vertue what could i do with this information when weve only got 60-70 years to take it all into account. i suppose we could make the world a better place, but i belive that this takes a special kind of person to do this and not anyone can walk into this world with the perfect answers. One man who made the world a better place was Martin Luther King Jr. He came into this world with a leading attitude and i think that he did his duty well. &nbsp; One thing that really ticks me off is Princess Diana, i know she may of done alot for us but compared to mother teressa she was a lay about. BUT mother teressa didnt recive such an elaborate memorial as Diana did. Princess Diana had a memorial made for her that cost in excess of 3.6million, Â£600,000 over budget. DO you think that she would of wanted the money to be spent on that instead of on the starving? &nbsp; I should add i do like Claires Hair &nbsp; Dave XxXxX

       What the flying shit am i doing these days. Im talking to a website and no one seems to be listening to what i say, its not like anyone would acctually sit down a read it. people seem to have a need to blurt out what they think to something that is totally anonymous at the best of times. its a bit like people wondering down the road and talking with raised voices into their mobile phone. theres no need but people think that others need to know. Im not moaning again because i think that writing this stuff is a good release even tho someone might not take any notice of it.  Well thats what i think to all this and yes you can expect me to write what i think even tho i have totally slagged it off.  Dave XxXxX

       I feel drained, totally drained. ive got all this freedom for the rest of my life and effectively the worlds my oyster, but i cant see past this mixture of tiredness and bordom. is this a example of what life has got to offer? i would love for someone to give me a answer to this quesiton but to be honest i half-expect the rest of you to be a bit like this and i expect you to be asking the same question. Its things like i cant see what money has to offer for people that make lots of it and i cant see why people want to carry on making this woven peice of material with ink enbossed onto it. Whats the point of it when u dont want to spend it on people you love and cherish?  What is the point of going out with someone when u dont expect to spend the rest of your life with them? Is it for the sexual benifit or just because you feel lonely and dis-satisfied? Of course it is, i should say i aint got a problem with it and i have a bias because i feel lonely too. But i think that if you go out with someone you dont truely love for who they are then whats the point of wasting your time?  Anyways ill stop my moaning for now and ill bore myself with it all  Dave XxXxX
