      Well the day I created this blog is the day I must leave. My dad just told me that we were going to go to the shore and that he wanted me to get my hiar cut before we went; it makes me look like a girl because old men with siccors and "style" don't mix very well, oh well it'll grow back (This whole haircut thing has to do with a long story I can tell you when I get back). Anyways, we're headed for the shore, Ocean City or somewhere on the Outer Banks, it's really not decided yet, but on the way we'll be passing through Washington D.C. and stopping to view Reagan's coffin.  Won't be back till Monday or late Sunday. Later.  urlLink My Homepage

      Yeah it's the days where there is absolutely nothing to do and your little brother starts annoying you. Right now I'm in the process of taking a room from bare dry wall into my new bedroom. I've been at it for about 2 years. I'm still on the drywall. The point of this is that I share a room with my little brother and he's about || this close to making me insane.  Anyways I hope your having  nice day.  urlLink My Homepage

      Summer. A time where you get better aquianted with your sibblings, if you live in the same house, yet a time when you draw further away from them because you notice how strange they are. It's also a time for relaxing and sipping that ice cold glass of lemonade tht so fondly characterizes the essence of summer. It's also a time when those of that have a job don't want it and those of us who don't have a job do because of money scarcity.  Well, summer has it's ups and downs, but on the whole we are temporarily released from the stench pit of our menial school attendance. Yes, no school is what summer is all about. And as summer begins I want you to take a lok back on the year you made it through and quickly forget it as your brain turns to mush and you dont have a thing to worry about, unless of course you have to take summer school. To you sad individuals I extend my greatest sympathy. Don't die on us.  urlLink My Homepage

      Toay I would like to ponder the question "What do you do when you see an endangered animal eating an endangered plant?". Yes, it's a very deep ethical question that delves right down into the annals of time for it's answer.  We'll begin by looking at The Endangered Species Act of 1973 that makes it illegal for Americans to import or trade in any product made from an endangered or threatened species unless it is used for an approved scientific purpose or to enhance the survival of the species. Also, the endangered species on this list cannot be hunted, killed, collected or injured in the United States. Um, who cares So, since one is being harmed in the process of the above said question we must therefore kill it and roast it over a fire. And thats when i discover that the plant was poisonous so I must therefore kill the plant because it was harming the animal eating which was endangered. So, in answer to the above question: We must kill the animal, and if the plant is poisonous we must also kill it due to the fact that they are harming one or both species.  urlLink My Hompage

      Well, hello again, I'm gald to see no one is reading this fascinating blog, but anyways I'm glad to be back from my 2 day back packing excursion down on the Laural Highland Trail in south-western PA. I must say the best part about the whole trip was that one of my friends packed in real potatoes and steak and mm-mmm was it good. We didn't even get rained on the whole time even though it was overcast and poured the night after we got bunked down for bed. Granted it was a little muddy. but what the hey, it's okay it's America. Later.   urlLink My Homepage

      Yes, I am back, but sadly I must leave again to go on a backpacking trip. But while I'm here and have the time let me tell you about my road trip. First, we drove down into the D.C. area, I was unconscious most of the way down and don't remember anything until we parked the car, we went down this way to go to the viewing of Ronald Regan's casket, so after we parked the car we, my dad and two brothers (no girls this trip), took the shuttle over to the line waiting to get in the capitol and began our waiting process about 10 till 2 in the morning. The line went all the way to the end of the mall and took us 5 1/2 hours make our way through, so it was about 7:30 when we finally got into the Rotunda. After that exciting experience (I have to admit that was probably a once in a lifetime opportunity) we headed to Ocean City, Maryland. It was raining and cold when we arrived, but we swam anyways, then came back to the hotel zoned out in front of the T.V. for a while and then went to eat at the original Phillips Seafood restaurant. Very Good.  The next day was warmer and the surf was up so we went swimmingthen we went parasailing which is a once in a lifetime thing too. After that we went to Asitiuge(?) and swam some there, and then we headed home and came back later Saturday night. All in all it was a fun trip.  urlLink My Homepage

      Ah, the story starts about 2 years ago when I first decided to move out of my current bedroom into an unfinished room. Well, in order to do this the bedroom must be finished. So, I started on it and 2 years later I am nearing the finish line and with most of the work done in the past week or so.  Hopefull I'll be up there by the end of the summer and away from my annoying brother who I currently share a room with.  urlLink My Homepage
