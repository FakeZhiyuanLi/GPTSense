      Some people never learn. They seem desperate to play Kindred Spirits, even after being told they are not welcome. I don't understand this, what is so wonderous about  urlLink Kindred Spirits  that we never get rid of people, we really want to get rid of? Are we really that special?  Lately we have this woman, early thirties, I would not trust my kid with, since there are kids playing on  urlLink Kindred Spirits  I really think this woman should not play here. Easy you might think simply ban the ip, problem solved. I wish it was that simple. No banning her ip means we ban half the United States, since she plays from AOL. Bad, bad, I am really getting supcious but I get the feeling "annoying people" play from AOL to annoy us, since AOL can't be banned.  Wrong we use newbie ban, a newbie can't play Kindred Spirits if he/she connects from AOL, of course if people really wish to play, they can always email  urlLink Kindred Spirits  with players name and password you want to use and we make you can play.

      We immortals did it again. We were unfriendly and caused a player to leave. Let me see, we never heard or saw much of this person, so we only can guess in how we could be unfriendly. Which leads to the following question: "What is unfriendly?"  "Are we unfriendly if we ban and delete someone because of advertising?"  "Are we unfriendly if we ban someone because of harassment?"  "Are we unfriendly if we don't jump and serve every mortals whim?"  "Are we unfriendly because we don't reimburse players losses?"  "Or maybe we are unfriendly because people have no clue on satire."  We can only guess. Luckily the person in question can return to his old mud. So at least he has a place to mud. As a matter of fact we "unfriendly" immortals usually tell people that if they have real issues, they should chose one of those other 1500 muds or more to play. Maybe there is a mud where immortals aren't human but replaced by highly intelligent mobs.   Yes that is the answer, write a good program where the immortals are replaced by mobs. Have the mobs tickle and pamper the mortals every now and then, while they kneel down in worshipping awe before the mortal, who obvious is in need of people boosting up their ego. (Look at some of the names, people create and you know what I mean)  Meanwhile keep mudding here at  urlLink Kindred Spirits , so we immortals can at least put you down, be as unfriendly as possible, because we don't like mortals.

      Allright for the time being I will publish the weblog here. I found out how to publish it on our site, but I need some time to figure out a better template that fits the KS theme of the site. Meanwhile you can check our site out.  Follow this link to see the website of  urlLink Kindred Spirits .  For now I am going to sleep. Tomorrow you will hear some more from me.  Thirzah

      Why do we punish people who advertise? The answer is simple advertising another mud is highly against the mud ettiquete. So don't do it. Here on Kindred Spirits we punish even players who log into another mud to advertise us. That does not mean we don't want people to advertise for us, but on the right places. Mud forums and weblogs like this are an excellent place.  For those people who wish  urlLink Kindred Spirits  to grow: spread the word, go to mud forums, find the right board, in most cases the promotion boards and write why  urlLink Kindred Spirits  is worth playing.

      The todays question is why does one want to be an immortal? Is it the power that is attractive or the fact that you can control games events? Maybe building, for some it's coding. Yes you can control a lot, but you can't control peoples behaviour.  In all honesty, there will always be a few 'mortals' who are not really breaking the laws, but so annoying that they cause others to not have fun. Yes fun, that's the most important thing on a mud, a good mud should offer fun for all, if you don't like to rp, you should have other fun in the form of runs or pk and with pk the following event occurs. The pk bullie; the pk bullie lives to pk and loot a victim at all price. He's selfish, mostly bragging and most important is he can KILL KILL KILL. He would cheat, do anything to get his loot and in the long run, you lose most peaceful players.  The other annoying factor is the so called social person. He or She talks and talks as usual nonsense, in the beginning you go into discussion, to find out you are talking against a wall. This person if he or she finds out that people quit listening can become annoying and starts stalking, yes stalking, no not spamming, spamming is the answer of the fourteen year old. These persons are usually a lot older. They start stalking to the point where guess what, yes you start losing players due to them.  To me it always seems that we have a nice mud when there are 4 to 5 people logging, when we reach 10 players we like it and laugh, untill somehow the above two types of mortals, who again are not breaking the rules except for being annoying and walking over other players. The player base gets down. To me this is ROT 1.4. ROT in dutch means rotten. Somehow the ROT code attracts the bad apples in the mudding community. The bad apples and slowly they affect the good ones, till one day you wake up, log into your favourite mud and discovers it's gone. What happened? The immortals got finally fed up with it.

      Sunday thirteen year old Wei Wei Hu got kidnapped and sexually abused by a 37 year old male who was on prohibation from the clinic he was treated for kidnapping and rape. Again and again you hear those shocking facts. Today an 18 year old murderer got only 7 years of prison for murdering sixteen year old Maya. The words of the judge, he will have life long for the knowledge of killing a person. Excuse me? He should have thought about that before he and his friends choked that girl.   Lately our society is getting worse and worse. Maroccan boys playing football with wreaches on the day we remember the fallen in World War II. Shocking? Yes. Teachers get murdered, taxi drivers get murdered, not a day passes or another shocking fact overwelms our society. Of course we dutch are politically correct. We belong to the four countries in the world where human rights are not violated, we share that honor with Cyprus (rather amazing considering the greek/turkish division), Danmark and Luxemburg.  A week or two ago, death penalty was given somewhere in the United States to a person with paranoid schizofrenia. There was a time when I would protest, now I feel maybe they are right. No I know there are persons who are really ill and you cannot really blame them for their deeds, but for crying out loud, lock them up for ever, don't let those individuals who are a danger for society, who will kill, who will abuse walk around free. Wei Wei Hu was a victim and it shouldn't have happened if we would understand that some people can't be cured.  Morally our society is in debt. We have more money, more stuff, we are all well fed and yet there seems to be a deep deep despair that is taking over society. People have no values and virtues any more. We all have a choice. We can live for ourselves, which is the reason of this outbreak of immorality, or we can chose to live our life to make other lives better. Something is wrong in our society and it looks like it's getting worse and worse.  to be continued
