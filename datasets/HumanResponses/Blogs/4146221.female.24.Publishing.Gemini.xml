      The woman next to me on the subway this morning was wearing the itchiest wool jacket.  It kept rubbing up against my poor little arm.  I think I have a rash now.  My friend sent me this email this morning talking about how he's recently taken to reading the DC Craigslist MC's and replying to the ones that seem to be from whiny, cock-starved girls.  He sent me the following links:  Problem:         urlLink http://washingtondc.craigslist.org/mis/39770185.html  BadAssAdvice:    urlLink http://washingtondc.craigslist.org/mis/39825938.html   Problem:         urlLink http://washingtondc.craigslist.org/mis/39675413.html  BadAssAdvice:    urlLink http://washingtondc.craigslist.org/mis/39688832.html   Awesome.  Now he's getting emails from people thanking him for his advice and telling him he's right on.  I'm not sure how I feel about this, but it's damn funny.  Roommate Kate was drunk last night and totally hilarious.  We were watching the Olympics and she kept saying how the boys doing the breaststroke reminded her of having sex and she was so drunk and out there, I had no idea what she was talking about.  She kept screaming and yelling and panting and rolling her eyes and drinking more beer.  When NBC showed underwater crotch shots, she was like, "Ohmigod!  Their undulating bodies!  Uhhh!!  It's just like sex!!!"  She was really into it.  Then her boy toy from DC showed up and they made grilled cheese and went to bed.  Alright, I need to finish at least one more Astrid Lindgren manuscript and sift through a few folders of crap we need to file.  The boss and the girl above me are both out next week and the RNC gets going so we'll see how much I accomplish.

      First off, I had to repost this because Blogger sucks nuts in hell lately. My apologies. I will try and recreate my witty insight.  Uh... check this out. It made me laff.  urlLink http://www.stereogum.com/nyissocool.mp3   Then I talked about how the spicy peanut sauce I made for lunch last night congealed and turned back into peanut butter with too much ginger when I had it this afternoon. God, that's not very interesting, is it?  Finally, I was just trolling Friendster when I noticed that everyone's testimonials are just glowing. I know for a fact that most people are vain, stupid, and boring. There is NO WAY that there exist as many clever, kind, gracious, funny, wonderful, good-looking, perfect, hilarious people as Friendster makes you believe.  Okay, I have a blog and a Friendster profile. And I related to that song. Shoot me. Shoot. Me.

         Insert foot in mouth, thrust, repeat.         I'm part of a reading group here at work. I was excited to get involved in it because I've had relatively little contact with children's books since I left them behind in 7th grade (okay, so it took me a year to read  Gone With the Wind  [I was a very cheesy kid] and I devoured the Weetzie Bat books when I was 15, but whatever), so this group gave me the chance to become familiar with contemporary, post-Harry children's fiction. It was my turn to choose a book and we read  Coraline  by Neil Gaiman. I was quite a fan of his Sandman series in high school and have read some of his adult stuff. Besides Sandman, his stuff's a'ight.  Well, the discussion was short and we still had about 30 minutes left in our lunch break and we're all friendly, so we started chatting about the Olympics, specifically swimming, gymnastics, and the bronze &amp; gold medal fencing matches. I was telling them, in my bossy, "here comes a funny story, I think" voice, about how my friends and I were watching Sada Jacobson and the Chinese fencer duking it out and how, ha-ha, isn't it funny that if China loses she will be killed when she goes back...ohmigod, Lisa's Chinese. And I knew that. And I realized it as I was telling the story and I turned to her and went, "No offense" and she laughed politely and I killed my story before I'd finished the thought and tried to make some asinine comments about hard working athletes, ha-ha. Her parents live in mainland China. I knew that. And she's really, really nice and always makes an effort to include me in assistant outings. I'm such a jerk.

      Why am I wearing a scarf? Because it's cold in here! Like, really cold, meat locker cold. I'm wearing a stiff denim blazer and my pashmina, which I usually wear like a blanket, is wrapped scarf-style around my neck. I just turned around to gnaw on some beef facilities came to store up here. You know I love that raw meat. (No, that's true.)  I see that someone has put up posters of our books in our packaging-slash-break room. They actually look festive and kind of nice. That room is generally depressing and kind of smelly (see previous entry -- also, the packing tape and wax machine have a really uncomfortable smell). I think a smile will bend my lips when I go in to get some water, heat up my lunch, or ship out 50 copies of a book.  I just can't get through the Astrid Lindgren manuscripts I have piled about me. They're nice and sweet but so whitebread. I have a hard time writing a negative report on something I haven't fully read and digested. So here I am, slogging through Bill Bergson's adventures with the White Roses.  I'm going to try and warm up and get more reading done. Perhaps I should burn all of the rejected manuscripts. Or get some Doritos.   5:10 pm.   They didn't have Doritos (damn!) and I didn't have enough change for the veggie crisps (damn!!) so I ate two servings of salt-free trail mix instead.  Good times.

      There's this woman I see every morning on my walk to the train.  She's one of those people that become a "regular" during your commute, but she isn't on my train.  She's walking, dressed business casual (in a frumpy, 40-something way), pushing her daughter along in a stroller, down the sidewalk away from the train.  She acts as my timeliness gauge: I know I'm running either early or late, depending where along my walk I see her.  Anyway, what I don't understand is why she insists on pushing her daughter in a stroller.  I know for a fact that the girl is 5 going on 6 (I heard this conversation).  I've observed the daughter closely to see if she is paralyzed or something, but she isn't.  Her legs swing and she can twist about by her own power.  But everyday, here is this woman, pushing her perfectly capable, old enough daughter around in a stroller.  I thought that maybe it's not that the girl is paralyzed, maybe she's sickly.  No.  The woman is just insane.  I came home from work early this past Monday because I didn't go to the gym.  To my surprise, I saw the woman and her daughter coming back along the sidewalk toward the train.  And even more shocking, the daughter  was walking .  Her mother had the stroller loaded with grocery bags and the girl was walking alongside it, holding on to her mother's arm, chattering away about the stupid stuff kids like to talk about.  I was surprised and I think the shock registered on my face because they both looked up at me and caught my eye.  (I know they recognize me every day because I've heard the woman comment on my outfits.)  The woman flashed a guilty look, or so I thought.  Passing them was especially awkward this time.  I must note that the sidewalk I always see them on leads to the local grocery store.  Perhaps this woman is pushing her daughter along every day just to load the stroller up with groceries for the day.  Most people just get one of those granny carts.

      I liked this, mostly for the second paragraph:  urlLink http://www.inthesetimes.com/site/main/article/i_love_you_madame_librarian/   Just enjoyed a lovely lunch with Robert and his not-so-little brother Andrew. We had Thai. Andrew hadn't had Thai before so we ordered him Pad Thai. He ate less than half of it. Anyway, it was great to see Robert. He seems well. His fall course load/work schedule/lack of a life made my head spin. Man, I remember those times. He wants to move to NY, which I encouraged. I wish everyone I liked lived here! I completely forgot to ask after his family, so I'll go and send him an email now.  On the way to lunch, I stopped at the ATM. There was a man with a sandwich-board on outside of the kiosk. He was ready: he saw me coming and snapped a flier at me. Like,  snapped!  It made that really satisfying noise where a floppy piece of paper suddenly becomes rigid, like the wood it was originally made of. (Remember that paper is made of wood?) He gave me a withering look and when I read the flier it was for a barbershop that offers free neck messages. Maybe he thought I needed a haircut or looked a little tense. My neck  is  sore...

      Shoooo.... I've been dragging lately. Probably because I haven't slept properly in months(sleeping properly = in). It takes me literally hours to fall asleep, so a 7 am wake-up call usually means I've only gotten 4 hours or so of sleep. The consecutive weeks of air travel, boozing, and tourism probably hasn't helped me much either. Also, I eschew caffeine because I don't think it really helps the situation in the long run, but here I am sipping a cup of jasmine tea. I can't wait until Friday. Half day from work, I'll go to the post office, clean the bathroom, and take a nap until Sunday.  And my blacks don't match today. Goddamn, that's annoying.  Speaking of the post office, I'm a voracious letter writer and I just read this article:  urlLink http://money.cnn.com/2004/08/10/news/midcaps/personal_stamps/index.htm  and now I'm excited!! I checked out the website and designed a stamp using the picture of Colin I've mentioned in a previous entry. The stamp looked awesome and I laughed, but at $16.99 + $2.00 for s/h, that's a lil' pricey for a joke. A joke no one will really notice. But, it's a really great idea. Hmmm... it would make a good gift for a few people I know. And speaking of stamps, I need to get some more stamps, since I'm almost out. I just checked the USPS on-line store and offerings are slim. Additionally, my local post office never has the cool stamps. I got these bat ones once that were so awesome because the background was black (very goth) and the bats on them were, like, so crazy. Man, I'm lusting after those now. I should've bought more. The current Reptile & Amphibian series seems kinda cool; I doubt my P.O. will have 'em.  For lunch, I'll be meeting up with the only ex-boyf I keep in touch with, which is fun. He's really nice and relatively normal, which is probably why we do chat. It was a high school "relationship" over the summer before I left for college. We broke up when I went to school and he was still in h.s. (Craddle robber!) His mom told him he was stupid for breaking up with me, which I just love. His mom is really awesome, actually. I wish she was coming to lunch, too. Anyway, Robert is a really great guy. Total rags to riches type story. His family isn't very well to do and when he &amp; I were seeing each other, he wasn't so into school. But, after we broke up, he got a new girlfriend who eventually dumped him and he started applying himself in school and ended up going to junior college and then being accepted to UCLA on scholarship. Now he is doing ... criminal psych? or something like that. (I'll find out at lunch.) I have a very serious policy of When the Relationship is Over, We will  Never  Talk Again, but he called me two years or so after the break up because he saw an article about me in the local newspaper and wanted to congratulate me and that rekindled a very nice friendship. Of course, because I'm a girl, I fret over my appearance when I'm going to see him (which is once a year or less), although it doesn't really matter. All girly insanity aside, I am very much looking forward to seeing him and seeing what other great things he's done so far! Yay, Robert!

       Always a guest, never a groom.   -B-dubs   I was in Columbus, OH this past weekend for Gina & Paul's wedding. Totally a good time. Bride &amp; groom looked amazing, food was awesome, drinks were flowing, guests were fun, dancing was prevalent (I'm using the word wrong, I know, but it was commonly occurring). Not much making out for people (unless your names are Pete, Margaret, Davin or Farah) so good clean fun abounded; histrionics were happily kept to a minimum. Neil Sumilas was hilarious, Brian danced alone and got the party started, raiding the bar at 11 was a class act and shout out to new best friend Thayer.  I am My Own Wife , anyone? Justin, E-roc, thanks for coming out! Sam Donaldson high-fives all around.  Pictures, a la Roje Gil:  urlLink http://www.ofoto.com/I.jsp?c=wrgihb9.3e3wt0nl&x=1&amp;y=952vzb   Krista, of Chicago fame, got married this weekend, too. Here is a link to photos from her wedding (thanks, Stef):  urlLink http://www.snapfish.com/share/p=443151092634980460/l=31778711/otsc=SYE/otsi=SALB  (there are 295 photos and you have to log in to see them....) SO sad I missed that one. Looks like a blast! Congratulations!  Weddings are really the greatest parties ever, even though all of the women seemed to have broken their toes.  The city of Columbus was not without its charms, as Brian and I discovered. We both came in relatively early on Friday and had a lot of time to kill until everyone got out of the rehearsal dinner. We wanted to go to the Ohio State Fair but didn't want to pay for a cab and couldn't figure out how to walk there, so we wandered downtown towards the German Village. We almost stopped at Chipotle on the way, but persevered and hit pay dirt. We ended up crashing the St. Mary's Church fund raiser, complete with moon bounce, bingo, and a live band. We ate delicious brats, drank a pitcher of Warstein Dunkel beer, stuffed Drumstick ice cream cones in our faces (have they gotten smaller or have we gotten bigger?), cruised for 16-year-old Midwestern boys (not so successful there), and watched a fat lady dance with a skinny, drunken guy while an older man with a pony tail danced around them with his cane. It was awesome. I can't even describe it. It was like an acid trip except .... wait, I've never done acid. Towards the end, with seventy-five cents in my pocket, we checked out the White Elephant aka tag sale inside. I purchased two small Kathakali masks for my seventy-five cents and Brian grilled a woman on why Henkel (a local guy) should be elected judge. In typical snobby East Coast fashion, Brian was impressed that she used "Google" as a verb. And in typical Emily fashion I said "fuck" loudly near some children and a nice lady in a kitten sweatshirt and made passers-by laugh as I loudly mocked everything around me ("What you've never  been  to a White Elephant?!" etc.). God, we're so affected.

      I am about to get on a plane to go to Columbus for a wedding. (Back to the Midwest!) I'm getting a little apprehensive since a few bad things have happened this morning. Namely, my boss broke her leg  through the skin  in two places and needs to get surgery and Julie Childs died. I feel like this could be a trying trip. What if this is my last missive and it's so trite? My poor mom.

      I was recently told that you should only post entries of 5-10 lines and then follow it up with a picture every 5 days or so.  Okay, here goes ....  Never mind, I can't.  I have to download some software and my company's security doesn't allow that, so I got nothin'.  I will describe the picture instead.  It was a picture of Colin (6'3", brown hair/eyes, skinny like a junkie -- loves ya, Col) standing in the living room of 1705 (college flop house/crack den) kissing and pinching the "nipple" of an African-American rag doll wearing a green dress with yellow sleeves and leggings.  He is making a really weird, snarky face.  Man, I wish you could see this.  Oh, well.  On to stuffing envelopes.

      I struck upon a clever idea for some jacket copy I'm writing. Actually, my boss told me to do something clever and I was worried I wouldn't think of anything, but I did. And it is  clever . Now I'm just wasting time as I figure out in the back of my mind how to do it. Let's hope this works out.  In the meantime, I will talk about toilet paper. My roommates and I are big consumers of the stuff, but seem lazy in the buying it department, so we've come to stealing it from our offices. Kate's office stocks the softest, velvetiest paper that's ever touched a tush (yeah nonprofit tree-friendly company!), mine is your standard 1-million sheet roll, and Cathy's yet to steal any, although she should since her benefits suck. Anyway, I was contemplating stealing an entire roll recently (unlike at Kate's company, we don't keep the stock readily available, so I have to steal 1/2 and 1/4 rolls that are laying around -- not like on the floor, the maids put the partially used rolls on top of fresh rolls when they change it so as not to waste any), when I noticed that one of the rolls in a dispenser had blue and pink stains all over the side. The only way t.p. could get stained in such a way was if it got wet and then laid upon a surface that was printed blue and pink. The ink, rewet by the wet paper, would bleed and be absorbed into the toilet paper, and admirably well, I might add, since that's t.p.'s job. Anyway, I couldn't figure out where those colors may have come from, since I've only ever seen the toilet paper go from the maid's bag onto the roll. The lone entire roll I was going to pinch wasn't resting on any colored surface so it's not like this roll was ever on something blue and pink ... except that it was. Well, ridiculously long, pointless story short, no one would use the blue and pink roll and today it's gone.  Maybe I should check the one at home a little closer?

       I just ran out to the bank to grab some cash for lunch (a bunch of the assistants are going out together).  I love being out in the city during midday.  It is such a different world.  You see all kinds of people you wouldn't see during the weekend.  Like:   Business men in suits, looking sweaty but still in their coat and tie  Bike messengers riding hardcore through traffic while talking on their phones  and  walkie-talkies (my favorite was the one on the red/yellow/green-taped rasta cruiser)  The Halal meat lunch stands  Construction workers and their heavy duty equipment  The cops standing guard all over this synagogue down the street -- why?   There is something strangely satisfying about being out in the city slightly before lunch time, when you get to see all of these people in action.  It's like a busy hive, thriving with activity.  On the weekends you only get to see the slow-walking tourists and the angry city folk pushing through them.  It's nice to sweat for two feet and then be blasted by the a/c pouring out of the shops and hotels along your walk.  It's also great to walk with purpose and have everyone else along with you.  I am not, however,  looking forward to what the RNC's influx of people and the people who hate them are going to do to the orderly activity of this hive.  That should be a trying week.

      I sit right next to the kitchen here at the office. Kitchen proximity sure has its pluses and minuses. For example, if someone brings in a tray of cookies, I can sneak in there 3, 4, 5, 6 times and steal as many as I want but no one can see me do it and think I'm a glutton. On the other hand, when people are heating up their lunches, I am privy to a melange of smells. And God help me if someone heats up fish or popcorn.  Today, someone has nuked something so nasty my nose is itching. I can feel a sneeze welling in my body as my head fights my nose in the battle to not smell something gross when there is an odor in the air. I'm sure you've fought in this eternal battle of wills before. Barf. I should throw in a salmon to cover up this stench.  Which leads me to this thought: why do people sniff something when someone tells them it smells bad? You know, the whole, "Ohmigod, this smells so bad! Here smell it" and then you lean in and take a whiff. You  know  it smells bad. Why the hell are you smelling something that you know will offend you? I have absolutely no desire to smell something stinky (see ?2) and refuse to smell something smelly if you tell me it smells! Unless it's cheese and then I might consider eating it.  People do that kind of stuff all the time, where someone tells them to do something they already know (because the command-giver has told them) is bad. I just don't get it. Lemmings.  Or, when someone puts a match to your face in a mocking attempt to light you on fire, why don't you just blow it out? Lighters blow out, too.  Which is why I think I don't like movies. They're just so unrealistic. I have a hard time suspending reality when it's clearly in my face. Why do people always run  upstairs!  when they're being chased by a bad guy? What in the hell are you going to do on the roof except maybe die?! I suppose movies wouldn't be entertaining (or suggestive of the human race as a whole) if the characters acted with common sense, simple common sense (I love that new Streets song). Apparently, I'm too pragmatic for all this nonsense.   4:35 pm.  I just saw a giant fly -- like GIANT -- walking around the 2nd floor. I don't get animals with wings that walk. Like pigeons. They can fly all over but they seem to prefer that goofy bobbing-headed walk. Stupid walking flying pests.  Also, just teetered over  twice  in my co-worker's office. Classy.  Finally, loving this underripe nectarine.

      Ugh... I am so tired this morning. The weekend in Chicago was fun, but I'm just dragging now. I woke up 15 minutes late and my roommate went in the shower first so I got to work at 9 am, instead of 8:45. And, sitting on the train, I realized that I forgot to put on make up so I look as pale as a rotting corpse. Very nice.  I have a box of manuscripts in front of me to read. They're all by Astrid Lindgren (of  Pippi Longstocking  fame). Seriously, a box. And I still have those two hamster novels, a WWII novel, and three picture books to read. Probably should get at it.  Olga might be moving around the corner from me! She starts law school this Sunday and needs to find a place in Brooklyn stat. Hopefully everyone involved in the share agreed that her moving in is for the best.  Alright, reading time.   11:07 am.  Rick James died!

       "You have fishnets, pointy shoes, and a blog. I love it."   -Pete   Blogs are so stupid. I think I resisted them for a long time because who really cares to read about whether you like fresh or frozen broccoli? I think Pete summed this up pretty well. Oh, the hubris. How dull.   addendum: 8/10/04, 12:35 pm.  Colin and I were just talking about how blogs are just public journals. (Of course, we made a joke about  pubic  journals and how our pubes are private, etc.) And I was saying how I have a love/hate relationship with this concept, just like my relationship with Eddie Vedder (omg, I HATE him with the intensity of 1,000 burning suns). Blogs are highly self-indulgent, but I want to wrap you all (who?) in the warmth of my random thoughts. And, I hate writing by hand so my actual journal keeping has slackened, so I'm really liking this typing and sharing thing, although it makes me feel awful that it seems like I'm presenting my worldview as the best one. That's a little boring. Which is why I was always a bigger fan of publishing a zine where I didn't write the content, I just put it all together.  But, c'mon, the smell thing was funny.

      Chicago is cool like whoa. (For some reason, I kept saying everything was ???like whoa??? or "awesome" this past weekend.) We ate Chicago-style hot dogs at Portillo's, Chicago deep dish at Lou Manatelli's, drank something like 6 pitchers of beer between two of us, met a really nice Chicagoan who told me of a Polish dance club to go to (sadly, we didn't go because I was really sick with Montezuma's revenge,  not  a hangover. Stefanie had imported it from Montauk and got us all sick with a horrible 24 hr bug; I???m fine now. But, that night he called me later and I went to save his number in my phone and put his name in as "Jnhn Sa8F"), hung out in Wicker Park at Angelica's Polish restaurant, pretended we were in Krakow at Cafe Lura's, went to Omaha Beach (where I longed for my bike) and laughed at everyone, had a stranger say "God bless you" to me on the street when I sneezed, reenacted the entire Eddie Izzard Dressed to Kill performance, forced my friends to take the El everywhere, and generally had an awesome time. The hotel was just okay, because they didn???t have a hot tub for us to wallow in and sip Champers, which had been one of the top activities on my list, but the beds were sumptuous and comfortable. I???m exhausted this morning -- too bad I didn???t spend more time in them!  The city was fun and hip. The people were attractive and interesting and nice nice nice, there was art and culture everywhere, and tons of good shopping &amp; restaurants (although we only ate low-brow Chicago food). I told Stefanie that if NYC blew up and I was forced to move somewhere, I would happily go to Chicago. It was like NYC if it was located in a Brooklyn populated by nicer people. And I hardly saw any fat Midwesterners in kitten sweatshirts! I call that a successful trip.  Stefanie took pics with her digicam, so I???ll post them when she uploads everything. For some reason, she took a ton of pictures of my feet on Saturday night (and it wasn???t because of the lovely pearlized orange nail polish I???m currently sporting). She seemed really fascinated by these fishnet stockings I was wearing ??? And she was really drunk.  On Sunday, while Stefanie and I were doing a public art walking tour, we heard that Snoop Dogg was in the area. We tried to get a glimpse of him but all we could see that alluded to his presence was a pimped out purple Cadillac adorned with white crosses (he's besties with that pimp The Reverend Don Magic Juan). Too bad we didn't blaze with him, I've heard he's really nice. Oh, never mind, he stopped smoking or something. Do you remember when he made that announcement? Laughable. I would, however, have liked to have seen his kid, whose name is something awesome like Lil' Woogidybo Joojoobee.  So, I think it was a successful bachelorette party. And it was really great to see my friend before she got hitched. She seems so in love, so happy, and so  ready . I'm so happy for her!

      So the commute in this morning was all kinds of f'ed up. The F train ahead of me had an "emergency break" situation so the other trains were being rerouted through Brooklyn into Queens on the G line, which is b-a-d for me. Hoping, like every other sucker who got off the train, that the next one would run properly, I waited on the platform for the next train.  Not so much.  I ended up having to take the glacially slow R train through a million stops in Brooklyn and up to my office. I got here one hour late for a half-day. Nice.  But, off to Chicago with Kat, Stef, and Krista for the weekend!! We're staying at this ridiculously posh hotel ( urlLink www.amalfihotelchicago.com ), with free cocktails and breakfast, etc. I've never been to the Windy City and I've always wanted to go, so this should be really great. It's also Krista's last weekend as a single woman before she gets married to her "Tater," Matt. I think a bender weekend celebration is in order.

      As I sit at my sad little cubicle, eating my sad little lunch, I've discovered that fresh broccoli is  so much  better than frozen broccoli. My roommate recently left for Peru and before she took off, she made a point of showing me her head of broccoli and telling me to eat it before she came back. I took her up on her offer the other day and made a delightful dinner of hot Italian sausage, yellow peppers, and her broccoli served over penne. So fresh! So yum! And today I'm back to my frozen broccoli (I can buy it in bulk -- which is a problem right there, I think) and it's just nasty. Ugh.  Maybe they have cake downstairs to cheer me up.   3:49 pm.  I was recently asked why I didn't have a boyfriend.  I didn't have an immediate answer, but I've come to realize that I suffer from a disorder that I thought struck only men. Best friend-itis. ...Wait, I can think of a better term. Uh... Well, anyway, it's where you befriend someone you think is cute with the explicit purpose of getting in their pants and then you realize that instead of them liking to make out with you, they'd rather joke around and talk because you're such  good friends  or  such a cool person . I'm not a person, dammit! I thought this only happened to those desperate, needy, doe-eyed, make-up-and-hygiene knowing boys, but apparently it can happen to cool, intelligent, relatively good looking girls too. Damn. Perhaps I should be less cool and more stupid and therefore better for the getting in the pants of.  Also, must give a shout-out to my dear ol' little bro:  urlLink http://mike.sanguinary.net . Plenty of stuff to do on there to kill time. (People used to read or do crafts, now we click buttons. I read -- yes, I still read -- that when humans evolve they're going to have like tons of fingers and giant heads to house their brains. Imagine being the first woman to birth one of these creatures? Talk about post-partum depression.)

      I can't believe I'm currently being paid to read two novels about a hamster James Bond. Is this really my job? Am I really drawing a paycheck for this?  If so, it's kinda cool and kinda not. On the one hand, I get to read all day -- sometimes for eight hours. On the other, it's lame because I'm not reading things I choose or I'm reading stuff that's horrible.  Yesterday, I saw the buttcrack of a homeless woman who was digging through her pile of things. I walked by her on my way to the bank and then back past her, still digging in the same bag, 20 minutes later. I wonder what she was looking for.  There is this man who gets on at the 23rd St stop on my commute to work. I love him. He sells "Duracel" batteries, double and triple A's. He has this great speech he makes about how he is an honest working man and then he talks about the batteries (he always seems to forget that he sells AAA's too) and offers them for $1 for 2. I want to buy some just because I think he is great -- he has this wonderful pinched voice and this strange pronunciation, like he's partially deaf -- but I never need batteries lately. Or have a dollar, for that matter. When he walks by me I like to see what shoes he is wearing. Today he had on these sparkly silver and gold Asics. They look really fast and awesome.  ...My coworker just came by and picked up this paper that came in. "Did this just come in?" she asks. I say, "Oh, I thought you saw that. It's dated 8/5." "It  is  8/5." "Oh, I thought it was the 8th." She must think I'm a friggin idiot.
