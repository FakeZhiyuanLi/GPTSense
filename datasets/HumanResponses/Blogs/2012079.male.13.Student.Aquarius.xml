       "Gasp!" exclaimed the Spencer as he turned the corner and read the boards on the front of the theatre. "Where be thy Dodgeball? Be it possibly gone?"   Indeed, it was so, the film dubbed "Dodgeball" by the neighboring peasants of yon village was not to be seen. Like a travelling troupe, it had packeth up and moveth away.      He was of much perplexedosity, but would not leave, lest the fair maiden Aubrey arrive and not see him. Catastrophic events would rain amuck did that happen. Instead, the Spencer leanth against a wall and re-read his copy of the Shizno News, issue of the number fifty.      Within fifteen minutes (since he had arrived at the time of 11:10 or so), an automobile parkth, and out did come the lady Aubrey. The two discussed the situation of not seeing Dodgeball on yonder boards, and thought about what they might do in alternation. They settled on watching the film Spiderman 2. The Spencer hadth already seen the movie, but as it was long in time and full in entertainment value, he agreed wholeheartedly.      As the film played, not much did the Spencer nor Aubrey do. The air conditioning, on the other hand, did more than its share. This did not ruin the movie, however, as both Spencer and Aubrey enjoyed it fully. By the time the movie was done, the lady and the Spencer were beginning to turn a most noble shade of blue.      As they exited the theater, with feet of blue and shivers playing havoc on their ability to stand straight, Aubrey remembered that she needed to call her mother, and promptly went outside. Spencer did remind her that yon pay phone was inside. Both of them. He pointed out yon smallish sign saying "Phone". The lady Aubrey made the call, and the two of them went outside and stood awkwardly on the curb, waiting.      As the mother arrived, the two bode farewell, and parted, Spencer walking the 15-minute walk back to his castle, where he consumed a most delicious peach. Mmmm, mmm.

       I spent the first two hours of my day trying to hold an online vow of silence. Last night, I became rather fed up with my words being misinterpreted, mistaken for insults, and made fun of, so I though that I'd stop talking. I knew that something this rational wouldn't last very long, so I planned it for only a day.     &nbsp;   Well, that didn't work either. Two hours into it, I realized two things:     &nbsp;   a) I was feeling much better than I did last night, and    b) it was getting increasingly difficult to imagine not talking to my friends for a day.     &nbsp;   Oh, and my away message sounded extremely childish.     &nbsp;   Now, certainly, I have managed to go for nine days without talking to friends online, but when it's pure choice, and the computer desk also occupies the rest of your day as your drawing space,  you  try ignoring the world*.     &nbsp;   So, around ten o' clock, I gave in, and joined the world of the online once more.     &nbsp;   I'm going to see Dodgeball tomorrow with Aubrey. It's not the top choice for a movie to see together, but hey, it works. I've been thinking through all the possibilities of what might happen... I might get popcorn in my face... I might choose the one seat that has no cushion... it's endless. And highly amusing.

        I slugged through breakfast this morning half-awake, anticipating a nice chance for extra   rest after my younger brother and dad left. Instead, I found myself   becoming more alive in the shower, watching the concept of a nice,   peaceful nap slip down the drain.  Oh well,  I thought,  a peaceful shower's okay too.      I didn't get that either. My dad called me in the middle of my shower.   I begrudgingly turned the water off, wove a towel around my waist, and   answered the phone. As it turned out, my younger brother wasn't   registered for the summer daycare program today, and so the only way he   could get in would be if there were any cancelations. They were eading   home to wait for word of vacancies.     It wasn't even eight o' clock yet, and my day was looking like a bad one.     I schlepped back into the shower, thinking of all the things I  wouldn't      be able to do if my brother and dad stayed home all day. Finishing, I   dressed, spiked my hair, and took the five steps to my computer.     Within an hour, there was a cancelation, and so the two extra bodies in the house were out the door.     I had to go get music for my violin, so I hopped on my bike and headed   down the highway to the music shop. After purchasing the book, I   decided to take a long way home, and rode a loop back to my house.     The ride itself was enjoyable, and rather uneventful. No psychotic   maniacs running after me, throwing knives; no squirrels dashing under   my wheel. For the most of the ride, I contemplated the feeling of joy I   got yesterday after learning that the girl I've had a crush on for the   last six months also liked me. While it was a rather childish reason to&nbsp;be overjoyed,   it's a rare one, and so I'm attempting to remember it before it fades.     By the time I was nearly three-fourths of the way home, my legs were aching like crazy, and my mouth was getting sticky from lack of moisture. I managed to pull myself home, opened the door, and made a beeline towards the fridge, where I poured and immediately downed a glass of cold, fresh water.   Upstairs, on my computer, I Mapquest'd my route, piece by piece, and found that it came to about 9.48 miles-- which I rounded to 10. I thought I had a good reason to be exhausted, seeing as I'd averaged about a pace of 10-15 mph.   I unceremoniously spent the rest of the day scheming a poster for my local highschool's mafia, and surfing the web. While my day had started off looking a bit unfriendly, it worked itself out by midafternoon.      &nbsp;    &nbsp;
