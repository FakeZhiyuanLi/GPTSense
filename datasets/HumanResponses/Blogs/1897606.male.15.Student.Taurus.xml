      is frickin amazing. I watched it (completely legally) today, and I am just in awe. Best film I've seen in a LONG time. Everybody go see it when it comes out in the US of A.

      "I watched Keanu watching and I suddenly felt it," explains Tarantino. [Warning: what follows is definitely an 18 rating verbal explosion] "You know, my guys are all real. There's no computer f*cking around. I'm sick to death of all that sh*t. This is old school with f*cking cameras. If i'd wanted all that computer game bullsh*t, I'd have gone home and stuck my dick in my Nintendo." and later continued; "This CGI bullsh*t is the death knell of cinema. Movies are far too f*cking expensive at the moment and it's killing the f*cking art form. The way it's going, in ten year's time it will officially be killed."

      and I realized that laugh tracks are just absurd. Do we really need to hear fake laughs to identify the jokes? I'd hope not.  And I have a proposition. Cry tracks for dramas. At peak dramatic points, recordings of elderly women crying and saying "Ooooh lordy!" will be inserted into the show.

      Well, my idea is, y'know, I want a name -- I want it so it can cut glass, y'know, razor sharp. When I close my eyes, I see this thing, a sign, I see this name in bright blue neon lights with a purple outline. And this name is so bright and so sharp that the sign -- it just blows up because the name is so powerful... It says, "Dirk Diggler."

      My dad brought home some McDonald's today, and I thought to myself, "Mmmm, I am going to  enjoy  this tasty burger." But beneath this innocent-looking burger, there was a  dirty little secret . As I sank my teeth into the hunk of processed cow, a surge of sheer malaise overtook my body, and my throat broke into an uncontrollable fit of spasm and distress.   Onions.  I will never do business with the sunzabitches again.

      There was an announcement on the school news today that just reminded how much I HATE queer little nicknames. "If you have any questions, just talk to John, Maxi, Arugato, Steve-o, or Smeagol!" Yeah, seriously, some idiot at Oak Park High School has  Smeagol  for a nickname. What a cool guy. And another thing: I am convinced that at every high school, there is a super cool kid named Tripp. I have no bloody clue why. But there is.  People think that having an awesome nickname makes them special in some way, but it really just makes them look like total jerks. I have heard people trying to in invent their own little names. There is nothing worse than a self-imposed nickname.   Ah who am I kidding. I'm just jealous because nobody ever gave me one. If you are reading this, call me Scat from now on. I'm begging you.   ~Scat

      Assume that he is singing to an ex-boyfriend.  Example:   I'm missing your bed I never sleep Avoiding the spots where we'd have to speak, And this bottle of beast Is taking me home  I'm cuddling close To blankets and sheets But you're not alone, and you're not discreet Make sure I know who's taking you home.  I'm reading your note over again There's not a word that I comprehend, Except when you signed it "I will love you always and forever. "  Well As for now I'm gonna hear the saddest songs And sit alone and wonder How you're making out But as for me, I wish that I were anywhere with anyone Making out.  I'm missing your laugh How did it break? And when did your eyes begin to look fake? I hope you're as happy as you 're pretending.  I am alone In my defeat I wish I knew you were safely at home  I'm missing your bed I never sleep Avoiding the spots where we'd have speak, and This bottle of beast is taking me home.  Your hair, it's everywhere. Screaming infidelities And taking its wear. {Repeat Four times}     What a faggot.

      If you talk to me much, you have probably heard me use some of this wicked lingo. I am excessively serious about the future of this terminology. These words are coming back dammit, whether you like it or not.   DYNAMITE  - This word just rocks. Mind you, it always must be spelled in all caps, or said with excessive emphasis.  righteous  - Some great old school slang. Undeniably fun to say.  The Pirate Collection  - Pirates rock, so pirate language rocks as well. Yarr, aye, avast, matey, these are all beyond cool.  indeed  - Beats "yes" any day. Just some rockin! stuff.  rockin!  - Translates roughly to "cool stuff!" The exclamation is an integral part of the word.  If you don't use these words, you're a loser.

      Today during health class we had to do this bloody "Wellness Test" run by a local hospital. I wasn't going to do it, but my teacher threatened us so I got the paper signed. So after doing a worksheet and some reading out of my propaganda book, it was my turn to go through. I got my height (5' 7.5") and weight (152) measured by an old lady who really just needed somebody to hold her, and tell her everything was going to be all right. Next station: blood pressure, and a barrage of insults. Finally: the BIG ONE. CHOLESTEROL AND GLUCOSE. They used this little poker thing and then made fun of me for bleeding a lot. She puts the samples in the little machines. And it says my cholesterol is bloody 157. I know for a fact it is at least over 200, probably closer to 250.  I have high cholesterol and am damn proud of it. I feel sorry for all the kids who have been raped of a proper diagnosis (well actually I don't). I sit down, feeling utterly drained, and pondering the true efficiency of the health system in the wonderful United States. Bang. My friend hits the floor up on stage. He now lays dead in a mausoleum. They killed my only friend.

      Pretty typical day today. I found out that my History class is 50% special ed...that explains why most everybody seems to have a 3rd grade reading level. Ah well, stupid kids are cool too.   I've pretty much spent my evening converting my MP3 collection to MP3CD format, so I don't get sued by the RIAA bastards. This basically means renaming every one of my thousand files (not fun). So I'll go ahead and get back to that.

      The reading was lots of fun. It took a while to get to Unity Temple (me and my dad got a bit lost), but we finally got there at about 6:30. It was pretty weird seeing about 400 fans all in the same place. There were even a few people from Oak Park.   So we got inside and found a seat. We were one of the first people to go into the actual church, so we were able to get some pretty good seats. The 45-minute wait didn't last too long, we just listened to the pointless conversations of jaded pseudo-intellectual college kids.  Finally at about 7:15, the Rainy Day Books lady came out and said we had to wait for the stragglers, and it would be another 15 minutes, but Chuck was here. Applause. Ah well, I'd made it this long.   25 minutes later...enter Rainy Day Books lady. Pretty much just a shameless plug ("Come check out Al Franken!" Suck it!).  Finally , Chuck emerged from backstage, to a standing ovation. It wasn't as shocking as I had expected it to be, he pretty much seemed like a regular guy. He gave a little introduction/sound check, then got to his short story work-in-progress, "Guts." Definitely an "interesting" story...it's essentially 6 pages of repulsive but hilarious masturbation stories. Seriously. So repulsive, they were rejected from PLAYBOY. To give a sample, a boy got a carrot stuck in his anus, another a stick of wax melted inside his urethra, another is disemboweled by a swimming pool drain. Yummy. It's not surprising there have been people passing out as a result of this story.  After he was finished, he had a Q&A session. He gave out prizes to the people that asked questions, mostly goofy hats and hand made rosaries. There were some pretty interesting questions, a few idiotic ones (one girl insisted on giving him a noogie), but Chuck gave a complete, usually funny, answer to all the questions he was asked. You got the feeling he had been asked them all before. After about 30-45 minutes of questions, he had to cut it off (there were still plenty of hands up), and start the signing. Unfortunately, I had ticket 237...meaning I had to wait about 2 hours to get my books signed. But it wasn't too bad, I just hung out and talked to a few fellow geeks, and before I knew it I was up on stage. I went up, shook his hand, and asked him a question about Diary (I don't want to spoil the book), and we had a brief conversation about it. He signed Diary and stamped it on a few pages with "PLEASE RETURN TO WAYTANSEA PUBLIC LIBRARY." Haha, what a jerk. Then he signed my copy of Fight Club and stamped it with "PROPERTY OF SHADY MOUNTAIN MENTAL HOSPITAL."   Anyway, it was a really great time. If you haven't checked out any of his work, do so! And maybe next time he's in town I'll catch you at the reading.

      Hmmmm, came home from school and finished  Diary , after a couple solid hours of reading. Good times, definitely an interesting evolution for Palahniuk. Can't wait to have a little chat with him about it.  A few minutes ago, I decided to go downstairs and spend a little quality time with my family. I figure I'll watch a little TV and make them think I actually like them. I only made it 2 minutes. They were watching the bloody new show Whoopi, which happens to be  insanely  racist. In the few minutes I saw, they insulted just about every race (except black people, of course, because they don't allow THAT on TV. I get so pissed off about this crap. Don't even get me started on Oxygen or Women's Entertainment. I can't wait until there is a WMET: White Men's Entertainment Television. I will die a happy man.

      A sign that my life has finally hit rock bottom: I created a blog. I am pathetic. For the record, I hate blogs, and I am being forced to do this against my will. Don't beleive anything you read.  Alright then. Wednesday, I'm going out to the Plaze for a Chuck Palahniuk reading/book signing, and I'm pumped as hell. I've seriously never talked to a celebrity in person, let alone one who I admire. I'm going to pick up the hard-back copy of his new book  Diary  and have him sign it. Then sell it on Ebay for twice what I paid. Just kidding. I have to think up something cool to talk to him about...  In other news, I saw Matchstick Men today (don't ask me how, it just showed up on my doorstep). Awesome movie, everybody should check it out when it opens. Coolest ending since The Usual Suspects. Also, Nicolas Cage gives another great performance. That guy's on a roll (rent Adaption if you haven't seen it).  Check out my new piece at deviantART  urlLink here .  Bye.

       urlLink  Ladder Theory   -- the truest thing I've ever read. A good excerpt:     The first thing to notice here is that a woman has not one, but two ladders. This is becasue in addition the normal ladder, a woman also has a friends ladder. The friends ladder is where a woman puts guys that she considers "just friends". More to the point where she puts guys who don't get to have sex with her.  The problem arises because a woman never lets a guy know which ladder he is on. Obviously there is a huge difference, or gap between these two ladders. It is in this gap that kisses of death are delivered and intellectual whores are made. All a man can do is "go for it" and make a move on a girl; ask her out, try to kiss her, write her a love note or whatever. If he's on the good ladder fine. If he is on the friends ladder this is a case of ladder jumping. The man is trying to jump the gap from the friends ladder to the real ladder. The girl has two choices at this point: she can let him on the ladder and all is well, or, more likely, she can kick him in the head, and off the ladder. If you look you'll see that below the ladder is the Abyss(what was it Nietzsche said about a man being on a rope stretched over an Abyss?....well it's worse than he thought; there is no rope.) So the man falls into the Abyss. The Abyss isn't really as bad as it sounds. Mostly it's a period of self-loathing, embarrassment, and of course utter awkwardness with the girl in question if they are talking at all.  To fully illustrate the point I'll now examine some common scenarios and their ladder theory explanations. For purposes of these examples Tom will be our boy and Jane will be out girl.  Scenario 1: Tom meets Jane. She's pretty and seems interesting to talk to. Tom and Jane start haging out and talking more and more. Tom develops an attraction to Jane, and one day tries to kiss her. Jane tell Tom she doesn't think of him that way and she wants to remain friends. The next few weeks contact between the two falls off. Jane starts fucking an outlaw biker.  Ladder Theory Explanation: Tom met Jane. Tom was immediately placed on the friends ladder. Tom didn't know this. Tom tried to jump ladders. Jane kicked Tom in the head rather than let him on and sent him hurtling to the Abyss below. The oulaw biker was not on her friends ladder (they never are) but rather on her good ladder.    Scenario 2: Tom meets Jane. She's cute and seems smart. After an appropriate amount of time he asks her out on a date. She acccepts and they have what seems to be a perfectly nice date. Tom thinks he has a chance with Jane. He asks her out again. She says no, either explicitly or by never returning his phone call. Tom has no idea what the Hell just happened. Jane starts fucking an unemployed alcoholic.  Ladder Theory Explanation: Jane misrepresented which ladder Tom was on. He thought he was on the good ladder because of her acceptance of the date. Mistake. This led to an unintentional ladder jump. He was kicked into the Abyss. In this situation, Jane often wants to stay friends becasue you are so interesting and funny or some shit like that. If this happens you are most likely an Intellectual Whore. I'm sorry. This is most likely to be a ninja-bitch.    Scenario 3: A girl says any of the following to you:  "You're like a brother to me"  "You're like a big teddy bear"  "I feel like I can talk to you about anything"  "You're so nice"  "Can you help me with my homework"   Ladder Theory Explanation: You are on the friends ladder. So Sorry.    You can see that a lot of problems can be avoided(though sadly not problem two) by declaring as soon as possible to a girl that you will not be friends under any circumstances. You can explain that she is too attractive or you can be blunt and say you don't want to bend your "friends" over a table and fuck them, but would rather play poker and go to the races with them, thus disqualifying her from friendship. As long as you are clear. This may scare a girl away. But if it does what would you want with such a skittish little twit anyway?

           Old people   - what the fuck do they do for anybody? Jack shit. Old people should be eaten.Get rid of anybody involved with the AARP while you're at it.  Priests  - how do these people lie through clenched teeth day after day? These pricks are only in it for the bling bling. And the ass. Sweet, tender, 8-year-old ass.  That kid in math class who "doesn't get it"  - am I the only one who has one of these fuckasses every year? "I don't get it!" "I'm stupid!" Here's an idea - end yourself!!! Nobody gives a shit, dick head.  Fat kids who laugh a lot   - yeah, I stole that from George Carlin, how about you go fuck yourself. If you're of hefty stature, please control your humor response.  Skaters  - fuckers. I've been asked if I skate so many times, I now answer with a simple, "Fuck you." Really.  People who don't speak english  - get the hell out of my country. I hate the US but it still pisses me off for some reason I won't even begin to discuss.  People who chew popcorn too fucking loud at movie theaters  - I hate popcorn, god dammit. I get this uncontrollable urge to pop a cap in their arses.  RIAA  - these fucks are constantly probing my computer and it pisses me off.  More to come. Many more to fucking come.

           You appear to be moderately to severely depressed from your responses to this self-report questionnaire. You should not take this as a diagnosis of any sort, or a recommendation for treatment. However, if would be advisable and likely beneficial for you to seek further diagnosis from a trained mental health professional soon to rule out a possible depressive disorder.   Shit...I actually took it honestly. I'm fucked up.

       urlLink  I just ran across this excessively intellectual blog.    "Hey Guys, i'm Lauren. Yesterday, and today, have been the worst! Ok, this guy named Brandon and I were goin out a lil while back, and we broke up..which is fine and all...b/c i'm cool with it! Well, i've liked him since like the 6th grade.and i still have feelings for him, and i mean, who wouldn't...likin somebody that long!..but, my feelings for him aren't like...be his girlfriend feelings, they're more like...ok, put it this way, the physical attraction is there...but, the chemistry isn't! Well, it turns out that my best friend..likes him. And honestly, that's fine and all..but, it hurts....bad...b/c she's my best friend...and i have feelings for him! I don't want to feel like this, honestly, i don't, but, I do, and i can't do anything, but accept them. And it's like, ever since she started likin Brandon, she's got no more time for me, and it hurts. Guys, (that means girls too); you just don't understand how important she is to me, and if i lost her, i don't know what i would do, but, i don't wanna say anything to her...b/c i would much rather me suffer than her suffer...anytime! And i was talkin to brandon yesterday, and was like..yeh, im a lil upset with Kasi, and he's like, why and i was like..b/c it's like..she's got not more time for me and stuff, and then, he tells her...the one person, i thought i could trust...tells stuff..and that right there hurt me...b/c he promised me that he would never tell anything i told him..and he did, so now, i can't talk to him anymore about stuff. And then, i've got another friend, jonci, who i love with all my heart!..she's like my other half!...well, it just seems lately, that we're drifting apart, and i do'nt know what to do to stop it!...i mean..i try talkin to her more.but, sometimes, she just turns the other way!..and corey...i love corey to death, but lately, we just haven't been clickin as good as we used to...and i don't know what to do to stop that one either! It's just crazy. And it seems like everybody's turnin against me. And, austin, my hot chocolate, yelled at me today, and i started cryin!...it was bad...b/c he's never yelled at me before...and i just..lost it..i went up to david and said ima cry..and he hugged me..and tears started flowin! i dunno what to do anymore..i mean..i guess i need to find new friends?..but, it's goin to be hard replacing the ppl that i love! But, on a happy note, i think i'm goin to go meet this guy from hillcrest this weekend....but, i'm not sure!...Maybe i could replace brandon with him...haha...i'm crackin up....sorry, that was mean....but, i could'nt resist....wow, that's one of the only times i've laughed today...thanks...but, i guess i better go now, bye bye....love, LaUrEn  Alrighty guys, i'm back, to tell you some more bad news! It turns out, that a girl named Kayla has been tellin ppl some stuff about me, behind my back, and it's really pissin me off....sorry to cuss, or whatever..but, it is! She's been sayin all this crap...about how i'm mad at kasi..and she's been sayin that one of my best friends is tellin her this..and everything..and then she's goin to get mad at me for somethin i said earlier today...ok, lemme tell you what happened:...ok, so, she went out with brandon's younger brother, Jordan, well she broke up with him and was like..i like brandon, and then...she goes up to brandon today, and was like...i don't like you nemore b/c i like jordan..and i heard about it..and i was like..haha...it crossed over on you..big deal..well, she goes behind my back tellin ppl that she's soo mad at me and everything..but, when i'm talkin to her..she seems like there's nothin wrong..and i'm sorry..but, if i'm mad at somebody..and they start talkin to me...then, ima let em know i'm mad at em..not necessarily by tellin...but, more than likely by my tone of voice..and it gets on my nerves..and let's hope that lauren doesn't get too carried away...but, i'm sure i'll be fine!...but, that's all the news i've got now..oo..and by the way..please don't think that all i think about is brandon..b/c it's not...honestly..it's just that he's the one causin soo much crap right now....hah.bye bye...Love, LaUrEn  ¶ 1:53 PM "   Wow...just, wow.

      Just a bad day. I got approximately 3 hours of sleep last night...bad times. Nothing really bad happened but nothing good happened either. I got home from the party and watched the Chiefs...pretty good game. Then I wrote a half-assed letter to "God" and went to confirmation...what a fucking waste of time. So I get home and my friends invite me to the movies but I couldn't go because I'm a poor fuck. So shit, I'll just sit at home and cry.

           urlLink  Link    We've all heard that inventors can get rich by "building a better lightbulb."   Fuck that. Lightbulbs are cheap, and I can pick 'em up in the grocery store. Takes about twenty seconds.   What inventors should really be focusing on are the things that piss us off in our everyday lives. In order to get them started, I've come up with a helpful list of inventions that just about everyone would like to see.   #1 Electroshock feedback devices on telephones.   All phones should come standard with these puppies. For 25 cents, you should be able to dial *187 and send an electrical shock right through the phone to zap the person on the other end. Think about what this would do to the telemarketing industry! Call me during dinner will you? It would have countless other applications too... ex significant others who won't take the hint, people calling for charitable contributions. You know those automated systems that have the nerve to call you up and then ask you to hold until a telemarketer can get to you? *187 bitch! Fry their whole goddamn computer system...   Of course, there would be the potential for abuse. Zapping people unneccessarily would have to be punishable by law, but "he really deserved it" would be a legitimate legal defense.   #2 DNA full body reconstruction like in "The Fifth Element"   OK so I suppose it would have some candy-ass uses like bringing folks back to life who have died in some tragic manner... but we're neglecting the true benefit of this kind of technology.   Murder would only be an inconvenience.   "Oh, you think it's ok to drive 57 in the fast lane during rush hour because you're 'over the speed limit'? Eat rocket propelled grenade, motherfucker!"   The possibilities are limitless. Paintball would be a thing of the past, we'd be able to do the real thing!   Not only that, but we could keep track of how many times each person has been reconstructed, and after so many goes, tough shit sherlock. If you've been blown up 37 times you probably deserve it.   Sure, we'd do some damage to the economy with missed work time, but think about it... everyone would be buying weaponry at almost half the rate of the average Texas redneck... so many jobs would be created that unemployment would vanish almost overnight!   Of course, someone would have to go around collecting DNA to reconstruct people, but I'll get to that later.   #3 Bodyfat content tests at vending machines.   This would be a major step in taking care of America's obesity problems. I mean, we tax the living shit out of cigarettes and alcohol, and those are fun! Everyone who goes to a vending machine would have to submit to a quick test, and the price would be adjusted based on body fat. Sure, some people would stay really obese, but it would be a step in the right direction. Of course, this invention would be rendered obsolete if they would get to work on...   #4 Excercise machines from the Matrix   Remember when Neo got unplugged? They hooked up all his muscles to some little device on a table and they electroshocked him into buffness. The dude had never even opened his eyes, and within a day he was ready to knock boots with Trinity... not that I'd reccomend that. Can you say "manly"?   I guess this means that I want to be lazy, but what the fuck did we invent technology for anyway? I mean, back in the hunter gatherer days, they say we only worked about 4 hours a day. I say if we can't get ourselves back to that point, we should abandon the whole thing.   #5 Robotic Labor   What the fuck? How long have sci-fi writers been going on about this shit? Get it together already.   Sure, robotic labor may be the pipe dream of the typical lazy American, but I say so fucking what? They could take on all kinds of useful jobs that the average human being just doesn't want to do... like mortican, proctologist, or DNA collector (see Advance #2).   Besides, if robotic labor was taking care of all of our manual labor needs, humanity would be free to do nothing but white collar work... we could focus our time on important things, like making better video games.   #6 That "force baton" from Minority Report   OK this one doesn't have much practical value, but it's fucking cool. Being able to fling people around on a whim would be really awesome. Mix in the technology they use for those "Moon Bounce" things that kids bounce around on at carnivals, put some goals in, and you've got yourself an awesome fucking sport.   #7 Cybernetic eye enhancement   Maybe then we could get some good refereeing in the (*&%#@(* NFL.

Speaking of gays: with regards to the  disgusting  image I posted yesterday, I in no way condone homosexuality or individuals who partake in such actions. The people photographed will undoubtedly rot in hell for all eternity, for they have sullied the Lord's sacred word.

      500 channels of a day-dream stimulation helps me to resent my life and raise my expectations. Locked into re-runs, your memories repeating, and all your ideals seem so self defeating. For you and yours, the pepsi generation, and when you're discontent, you change the T.V. station, And when you hate your life, no qualtities redeeming, a million brainwashed zombies will always be heard screaming...  And when there is no hope, "I'll smoke some crack, I'll shoot some dope!" When theres no enemies, "I sit and stare at my T.V. and in my ignorance, I'll be a slave and sycophant!"  And in a perfect world devoid of all temptations, the good leftover crizack could unite the nations. But now the war machines are mapping our destructions with poisons over flowing in the chemical seductions.  With my credit and my bank, my mind will draw a blank. I'll block out history, and stare at my T.V. For me there is no way. 500 channels waste my life away...

      Down the road, that's where I'll always be. Every stop I make, I make a new friend. Can't stay for long, just turn around and I'm gone again. Maybe tomorrow, I'll want to settle down, Until tomorrow, I'll just keep moving on.  This is my boss, Jonathan Hart, a self-made millionaire, he's quite a guy. This is Mrs H., she's gorgeous, she's one lady who knows how to take care of herself. By the way, my name is Max. I take care of both of them, which ain't easy, 'cause when they met it was MURDER!  One for all and all for one, Muskehounds are always ready. One for all and all for one, helping everybody. One for all and all for one, it's a pretty story. Sharing everything with fun, that's the way to be. One for all and all for one, Muskehounds are always ready. One for all and all for one, helping everybody. One for all and all for one, can sound pretty corny. If you've got a problem chum, think how it could be.  Ulysses, Ulysses - Soaring through all the galaxies. In search of Earth, flying in to the night. Ulysses, Ulysses - Fighting evil and tyranny, with all his power, and with all of his might. Ulysses - no-one else can do the things you do. Ulysses - like a bolt of thunder from the blue. Ulysses - always fighting all the evil forces bringing peace and justice to all.  Just the good ol' boys, never meanin' no harm. Beats all you've ever saw, been in trouble with the law since the day they was born. Straight'nin' the curve, flat'nin' the hills. Someday the mountain might get 'em, but the law never will. Makin' their way, the only way they know how, that's just a little bit more than the law will allow. Just good ol' boys, wouldn't change if they could, fightin' the system like a true modern day Robin Hood.

Everybody want to beat up somebody else who likes someone who likes someone else who doesn't like them back because they don't like the other person's dog...it's just getting ridiculous. Kids, this is your life and it's ending one day at a time. Everything will be okay, I promise, so why do you have to be depressed pussies.   Which brings me to my point: we gots to stick it to da man. If they would legalize weed, everything would be alright for everybody, and I could talk on AIM without getting caught up in these little dramas. While he's at it, the man could go ahead and get rid of alcohol. That shit never did nothing for nobody. Yeah. That's what I'm really trying to say. Fuck alcohol. And you.

Fuck squeegee men dirtying up the clean windshield of my car. Get a fucking job! Fuck the Sikhs and the Pakistanis bombing down the avenues in decrepit cabs, curry steaming out their pores and stinking up my day. Terrorists in fucking training. Slow the fuck down! Fuck the Chelsea boys with their waxed chests and pumped up biceps. Going down on each other in my parks and on my piers, jingling their dicks on my Channel 35. Fuck the Korean grocers with their pyramids of overpriced fruit and their tulips and roses wrapped in plastic. Ten years in the country, still no speaky English? Fuck the Russians in Brighton Beach. Mobster thugs sitting in cafés, sipping tea in little glasses, sugar cubes between their teeth. Wheelin' and dealin' and schemin'. Go back where you fucking came from! Fuck the black-hatted Chassidim, strolling up and down 47th street in their dirty gabardine with their dandruff. Selling South African apartheid diamonds! Fuck the Wall Street brokers. Self-styled masters of the universe. Michael Douglas, Gordon Gecko wannabe mother fuckers, figuring out new ways to rob hard working people blind. Send those Enron assholes to jail for fucking life! You think Bush and Cheney didn't know about that shit? Give me a fucking break! Tyco! Inclone! Adelphia! Worldcom! Fuck the Puerto Ricans. 20 to a car, swelling up the welfare rolls, worst fuckin' parade in the city. And don't even get me started on the Dom-in-i-cans, because they make the Puerto Ricans look good. Fuck the Bensonhurst Italians with their palmaded hair, their nylon warm-up suits, and their St. Anthony medallions. Swinging their, Jason Giambi, Louisville slugger, baseball bats, trying to audition for the Sopranos. Fuck the Upper East Side wives with their Armani scarves and their fifty-dollar Balducci artichokes. Overfed faces getting pulled and lifted and stretched, all taut and shiny. You're not fooling anybody, sweetheart! Fuck the uptown brothers. They never pass the ball, they don't want to play defense, they take fives steps on every lay-up to the hoop. And then they want to turn around and blame everything on the white man. Slavery ended one hundred and thirty seven years ago. Move the fuck on! Fuck the corrupt cops with their anus violating plungers and their 41 shots, standing behind a blue wall of silence. You betray our trust! Fuck the priests who put their hands down some innocent child's pants. Fuck the church that protects them, delivering us into evil. And while you're at it, fuck JC! He got off easy! A day on the cross, a weekend in hell, and all the hallelujahs of the legioned angels for eternity! Try seven years in fuckin' Otisville, Jay! Fuck Osama Bin Laden, Alqueda, and backward-ass, cave-dwelling, fundamentalist assholes everywhere. On the names of innocent thousands murdered, I pray you spend the rest of eternity with your seventy-two whores roasting in a jet-fueled fire in hell. You towel headed camel jockeys can kiss my royal, Irish ass!

Well listen, how do you think I feel about it?! ... Can you *imagine* how I feel about it, Dmitri? ... Why do you think I'm calling you? Just to say hello? ... *Of course* I like to speak to you! ... *Of course* I like to say hello! ... Not now, but anytime, Dmitri. I'm just calling up to tell you something terrible has happened... It's a *friendly* call. Of course it's a friendly call. ... Listen, if it wasn't friendly ... you probably wouldn't have even got it. ... They will *not* reach their targets for at least another hour. ... I am ... I am positive, Dmitri. ... Listen, I've been all over this with your ambassador. It is not a trick. ... Well, I'll tell you. We'd like to give your air staff a complete run-down on the targets, the flight plans, and the defensive systems of the planes. ... Yes! I mean i-i-i-if we're unable to recall the planes, then ... I'd say that, ah ... well, ah ... we're just gonna have to help you destroy them, Dmitri. ... I know they're our boys. ... All right, well listen now. Who should we call? ... *Who* should we call, Dmitri? The ... wha-whe, the People... you, sorry, you faded away there. ...

I'm very sorry. ... *All right*, you're sorrier than I am, but I am as sorry as well. ... I am as sorry as you are, Dmitri! Don't say that you're more sorry than I am, because I'm capable of being just as sorry as you are. ... So we're both sorry, all right?! ... All right.   If you can tell me what that's from, I'll, uh, give you something.

      This is exactly what the little card says:   Dear Friend,  How are you? I just had to send a note to tell you how much I care about you.   I saw you yesterday as you were talking with your friends.  I waited all day  hoping you would want to talk with me too. I gave you a sunset to close  your day  and a cool breeze to rest you--and I waited. You never came. It hurt me--but  I still love you  because I am your friend.  I saw you sleeping last night and longed to touch your brow so I spilled moonlight upon your face.  Again I waited,  wanting to rush down so we could talk. I have so many gifts for you! You awoke and rushed off to work.  My tears were in the rain.   If you would only listen to me!  I love you!  I try to tell you in blue skies and in the quiet green grass. I whisper it in leaves on the trees and breathe it in  colors of flowers , shout it to you in mountain streams, give the birds love songs to sing. I clothe you with warm sunshine and perfume the air with nature scents.  My love for you is deeper than the ocean,  and bigger than the biggest need in your heart.  Ask me! Talk with me!

      I was sifting through one of my gigantic wads of cash when I came across an interesting message on a dollar bill: "Rich, Service was Great! 237-2757 Call Me." Kind of makes you realize that there's this whole world out there that you'll never know. I don't know. A moment of zen, I guess.

          I just kind of blindly checked out this book from the library the other day, and damn it, it's too cool. I've seen the movie before, but it was a long time ago. I'm going to memorize all the crazy slang, and make people think I'm a fucking loser.    I viddied this real sladky ptista, I'd like to razrez those groodies after a dobby bit of lubbilubbing.

          So I went to this confirmation retreat today, basically 8 hours of hanging with and listening to fuckin Jesus freaks, namely Willy, as seen on www.WillyPutty.com. And I heard the words "God," "Love," and "Jesus" so many effing times, I'm no longer an atheist, I'm a fucking sadist. I began my sadist duties by inserting a purple slip of paper reading "HAIL SATAN" into one of the hymnals. I do what I can.

          Excuse the bad grammar. Obviously, I didn't write it.   "this goes out to the more homophobic of the uberusers out there, so that they can know how to act when this, that most awkward of cultural institutions; the Man-Hug, occurs.   it is important to know how to correctly execute a successful man-hug, as they are utilised in various occasions throughout our lifetimes, certainly, to greet male family members, but also for other purposes; to share joy at a sporting teams' success, or at a friend telling you he is going to get married. it is usually advisable to perform a man-hug whilst under the influence of a gutful of alcahol, but with these instructions, hopefully you will be able to painlessly snap off a quick hug while sober as a judge.   execution:   as you approach, the arms should be extended and raised, in pre-hug readiness. the right arm should be higher than the left, however it is important that the right arm is not too high, and vitally important that the left never, ever be too low. nor should the arms embrace the recipient on too similar a latitude; thats how you hug your girlfriend, and we dont want to confuse anybody, especially yourself, now do we? try and have the right hand 8-12 inches higher than the left.   as you approach, with arms raised and extended as shown, it is usual to omit a long vocal exclamation: "aaaaaaayyyyyyy." as the hug continues, it is proper that this vocalisation assumes a questioning tone: "aaaaaaaayyyyyyy?"   it is at the point of this questioning tone reaching its highest note, that the most important part of the man-hug occurs: the ritual back-slap. THIS IS THE MOST CRUCIAL PART OF THE CEREMONY.  the back-slap is important, because it is where you retain your masculinity whilst in an embrace with another man. see, youre hugging somebody, and this is giving love. in public. (if you are fuzzy about this, i refer you to the "public displays of affection" pamphlet you were all handed in high school) to counteract this possibly homosexual act, you need to cause pain. not much, but just enough, in a ceremonial kind of way that says while you are giving love, you are also giving pain.   i advise the trusty three-beat slap, with enough force to push a little air out of the hugee's lungs. many people also go for the closed-fist beat on the back, and i am one of these people, as it is far more masculine to punch someone, than it is to slap them; and you can never be too careful in this circumstance.   just as both the back-slap (or punch) and the vocals conclude, it is advisable to punctuate your man-hug with one more vocal: a loud, short "aarggh", said with as deep, and as growly a voice as you can muster. after this, you should disengage from the man-hug and contiue whatever it is that you were doing.   so there you have it, the Man-Hug in all its steadfastly heterosexual glory. i hope i have been of service to some of you reading this today, so that you can proudly go forth and hug to your hearts content.   but not too much, mind. that might seem a little gay.

      "What then is truth? A mobile army of metaphors, metonyms, and anthropomorphisms -- in short, a sum of human relations, which have been enhanced, transposed, and embellished poetically and rhetorically, and which after long use seem firm, canonical, and obligatory to a people: truths are illusions about which one has forgotten that is what they are; metaphors which are worn out and without sensuous power; coins which have lost their pictures and now matter only as metal, no longer as coins.  We still do not know where the urge for truth comes from; for as yet we have heard only of the obligation imposed by society that it should exist: to be truthful means using the customary metaphors - in moral terms, the obligation to lie according to fixed convention, to lie herd-like in a style obligatory for all... "  Werd, Nietzsche.

      Instead of just copying shit from IMDb, and shit. But I think my life might be too boring, you know? I don't really do anything, ever. But is that really a bad thing?  I get the feeling that kids feel like they have to be kids. Like they're not going to have a full life if they don't go to a movie every Friday night, or if they don't have a big reserve of humorous anecdotes to tell to their families on Thanksgiving when they're old and worthless. It's think people are trying way too hard to fit this fucking mold that is layed for us in American Pie, on fucking MTV. I don't know, it just seems a little trivial to me. I'm perfectly happy sitting at home by myself and watching a DVD's or playing video games.   Am I wasting my life? Do I care?

          Today, I thought of a man who is without a doubt the single most manly human being on the planet; a man who has slipped into obscurity as of late, but still personifies pure testosterone and studliness. This man, of course, is Emilio Estevez.   Surely you remember him as the almost-too-manly coach in  The Mighty Ducks, D2: The Mighty Ducks , and let's not forget,  D3: The Mighty Ducks . They called them misfits, they said they would never go anywhere, they called them "ugly ducklings," but Emilio, he said, "You may be ducks-- You MAY be ducks! Sure, you might be ducks! But you are MIGHTY!" And so it went. Emilio and his children conquered the world of pee wee hockey, THEY WON THAT FUCKING CHAMPIONSHIP! No, not without determination. Not without pain. Not without the help of Lasso Boy and that fucking kid. But damn it, they did it. They pulled it out.  And at the end of the day, isn't that what it's ALL about? Pulling it out? (unintentional pregnancy is a  plague ) So much hatred couldn't put a dent in the resolve of these little people. And--ahh, I'm getting carried away. What I am trying to say is that Mr. Estevez is the greatest man on Earth, and everybody should send him a large sum of money:   Jimmy Cundiff/Cassian Elwes C/O William Morris Agency 151 El Camino Dr. Beverly Hills, CA 90210   (90210!!!!!!)

      I was walkin' down 73rd last Tuesday, rainin' like a bitch. This little skanky hoe waddles up to me, tryin' not to irritate her gonorrhea infected vagina. She called out from under her obnoxiously massive boa, "You lookin' for a good time, chief?" I turn the other cheek and responded with a simple reply: "Fuck you, you dirty slut." She retorts: "Don't you know who I am?" I pulled out my .44 magnum and said, "Shut the fuck up bitch!" So she says, "Don't you know who I am!?" Then I shot her in the arm and she bled like a fucking nigger. Unbeknownst to me, she was Lindsey Lohan's stepsister. Once I uncovered this fact, I shot her twice in the head after requesting that she return the favor to her sister. In hell.  Danke, danke.

             When I become a pimp, my shoes are going to have SPINNERS, because spinners make everything better. If I had it my way, everything would sport some wicked spinners. Watches, hats, children, light switches, televisions, pocket calculators, stop watches, Kleenex (R) boxes, cars, damn it, EVERYTHING would have a cute battery powered spinner.   Whut can ah say? Playaz gotz tah get they spin own.

      Their basic idea seems to be "We're tired of everybody dressing the same, so...uh...let's all dress the same!" I've seen enough fucking kids who think that they're cool because they shop at the thrift store and wear torn clothes and 152847 bracelets and they listen to emo and they totally rawk every Friday night. Modern "punks" are seriously no different from jocks or preps or anybody else. All these kids try to be cool by breaking stereotypes, but all they really do is switch over to the cookie cutter of oh-my-god-I-dress-so-crazy-I-must-be-uber-hardcore. Whatever. I think everybody just needs to grow up and realize that clothes really don't fucking matter at all.

          What happened to this place? Me and Ashlee hung out there all day yesterday and had a really good time, but the place was  crawling  with black people. I'm not saying this is necessarily a bad thing, as I love people of all colors, but it is definitely a change from previous years. I mean, you couldn't go anywhere without seeing a guy with his pants down to his knees wearing a lame basketball jersey that says something witty like "GHETTO" or "PLAYA." Oh well. We shall overcome.  The coolest thing happened at Worlds of Fun, three times. On the Zulu, Cyclone Sam's, and the Ferris Wheel, everybody got into the whole Chappelle's Show "What, yeah, okay!" thing. You would think this would be old by now, but it's incredibly fun. Good times.  A good thing about the arrival of the black man at Worlds of Fun is the black kids. They're pretty cool. Ashlee dropped her quarter, and a black kid runs over to it and yells, "Somebody dropped their cents!" then promptly returned it to her. What a cool kid!  Spinning Dragons is an okay coaster. It looks pretty tame, and it kind of is, but it's fun and really smooth. Definitely worth a ride or two.  No DDR yet, they better get them in soon.

      The book...it's divided in to several chapters. For instance, Chapter 1 is entitled Excellent Foods. In this chapter, poetry is written about food that I find  excellent . As the volume continues, chapters are found which are called  Foods With Speed or: Fast Food, Tasties from Taiwan,  and  Rations of Russia , for example. The poetry...it's all about food. It is  poetry , written about nothing but  food . "Hamburger?," "Steak Sizzle Party," "Hot Dogs in the Sky," "Suchi Sushi!" All, poems, about, food...the poetry is written about consumeables. The texture, the taste, the heat and the cold, the ecstasy, the state of mind, the aroma, the sights and sounds, the  food ! It's all about food. And it's all POETRY.   Just a thought.

          I am so sick of fucking druggies. My bus was taken over by the fucking poor shit heads today, with the whole bus combination thing. WHAT A BUNCH OF FUCKING ASS HOLES!!! The only phrases I heard on the way home were "Fuck, I fucking need a fucking cigarette," "Fucking smoke party at my fucking house, dog!" and "Look at this fucking rich neighborhood." That's right fuckers, I'm fucking rich. I whipe my ass with 20's.  It's so comical how people just NEED to fit in somewhere. I seriously think the only reason people smoke is so they can bitch about how they need a cigarette and sound like such an uber-badass. And they succeed! Whenever I hear a kid talking about how he's going to get hella stoned, I think to myself, "I wish I could be that guy. I wish I could be cool enough to get high all the time. Since, you know, drugs are so cool." Totally. Ahh it's just funny. There's this whole group of people who hang together just because they all...like...smoking? Yeah...doesn't get much cooler.  If you're going to get high, keep it to yourself. Nobody gives a shit except for your equally pathetic stoner friends.

      switching off every other word.   I don't think that we are ready to do each other, but I think oral is possible, but I don't know! I want to make love all fucking year long. Giving head is very questionable in many societies, but in my country it's encouraged. Anyways, squirrels look at bitches poorly. I piss on children. Our sex-life is very slowly progressing. It's very good to be careful with things when it cums to fucking. We still need oral before going all teh way. Head isn't bad, and I want to give it soon, but I don't know. I fucking hate Troy McClure. You ought to suck his ass. Masterbation kills, man! Breasts feel sexellentwhen groped. Music makes sex feel hard. I wonder why my vagina is so wet! Beats me in the crotch. Fuck cows in barns. Sometimes I wonder if children like pictures of children. Family guy is fucking amazing. Children eat semen everytime I cum. This is almost gay that we must not shit on the children. Playgrounds make children very sexually aroused around me. White niggers are black elbino. Skins of chinks are quite ugly, but I enjoy porn featuring them. I must seem like a horny, dispicable lesbian, but kissing Daniel is terrible. JK Not, haha JK, not. Fucking Danny is so awesome! JK, not, JK. I love Danny! JK teh end.

          After school on Thursday, I hung out w/ Ashlee and her friend Lauren. We went to Sunfresh and I basically watched them mess up the store. Silly kids. We ran into Shane, Brad, Allison, and Ben. Well me, Brad, and Shane were just minding our own business and got kicked out. So we all head over to Ben's for a bit, us via an automobile, them not. We chilled over there for probably 10 minutes or so, until Ashlee and Lauren decided to leave, following an incident involving bean launching, and me, being the devoted boyfriend I am, go with them. So I spent the rest of the day over there. Me and Ashlee had the greatest time lying on her bed doing nothing. Seriously.  Friday, me, Ian, Brad, and Brad K filmed most of our movie that may or may not work out. We had a pretty good time, but I had a bit of a reality check regarding authority. Namely that I'm a stupid teenager that no adult could possibly be expected to give a shit about. We walked up to Quick Stop to ask if they'd mind if we filmed a couple seconds of our film, and this is her exact response: "No, not at all...I mean, I do mind." So we were all like, "Uhh...k." So we walk down to Oak Grove Park, right? We decide to film a scene of me freaking out on that amphitheater, for no particular reason. Yeah, this silly Gladstone Parks and Recreation guy bitches at me for kicking the gate. Come on, man! That thing is fucking sturdy! So we film some more stuff in the park, finishing most of it, but we have to wait for Knoch to get there to film his shit. Well a damn police officer comes up to us and says how there are people saying we were going in and out of the fucking bathroom with my camera, and how she thought we were filming the fucking kids playing on the playground. YEAH BITCH, I'M A FUCKING PEDOPHILE! But I'm a whore so I didn't say anything and put away my camera. We finished up at my house. But...not cool, man. Ashlee got really mad at me for blowing her off. It's cool now though.  Saturday...Ashlee came over. We played some Lemmings, watched some S&M...good times. I had to go to the ridiculously long Easter Vigil at my church. I'd never realized just how phony my damn church is. My priest  read every single prayer out of a fucking plastic binder. How can anybody take that seriously? After 3 hours of that, the only thought going through my head was FUCK RELIGION.  Today I went over to my grandma's house for an Easter "dinner." I love how people try so hard to keep things traditional. At some point you need to just accept that things aren't how they used to be. It was my family, my grandma, my uncle, and two cousins. The entirety of my dad's side of the family. Why do we even bother? Communication/eye contact was kept to a minimum. Luckily, my uncle brought his pirated Chappelle's Show DVD, and we all had a good time with that. Best show on TV.  And tomorrow. My mom is making me go to the doctor because of a blister I have on my foot from DDR. Not too sure why. Me and Ashlee are going head over to Oak Park's track and do a little running. Since she has her meet there and stuff on Tuesday. Should be fun.  Anyway. Happy Easter. I was just kidding about the religion thing. Jesus was good people.

       urlLink  Woman attacked at home, then told to cook     Call at 3 a.m. starts strange series of events  A Prince William County man is facing charges after a bizarre incident in which a Stafford County woman was beaten with a pellet gun and a hockey stick, then forced to prepare a meal.  Jesse B. Muckenfuss, 37, of Woodbridge is charged with attempted breaking and entering, malicious wounding, driving under the influence of drugs and/or alcohol, refusal to take a breath test and driving on a suspended license.  According to sheriff's Maj. David Decatur, the woman let an acquaintance come to her Quarry Road home after he called about 3 a.m. Sunday and said he needed to talk to her about something. They are not romantically involved, Decatur said.  Shortly after the woman answered a knock on her door, the man slapped her across the face and accused her of saying bad things about him, Decatur said.  The woman told police she had no idea what the man was talking about. He pulled out a pellet gun and struck the woman in the head several times with it, Decatur said, then hit her arms and legs with a regulation-sized hockey stick.  Eventually the man got inside the injured woman's home, where he forced her to prepare him a meal.  Decatur said the man proceeded to play "mind games" with the victim, telling her that he was high on crack cocaine and not sure what he might do next. He also brandished a steak knife toward the victim as he ate the meal she'd fixed, Decatur said.  Police said the woman tricked the man into stepping outside to smoke a cigarette, then slammed the door behind him and ran to press a panic alarm in her home.  The man banged on her door with the hockey stick for several minutes before leaving, Decatur said.  Deputy C.P. Roach spotted the suspect's vehicle on Quarry Road and stopped him. He later found the pellet gun and the hockey stick outside the victim's home.  Decatur said the victim had visible injuries, including what appeared to be a couple of broken fingers.  Muckenfuss was placed in the Rappahannock Regional Jail.

      I have been very slowly drifting away from the whole idea of punk music. It's kind of an impossibility in today's world. I mean, the origin of the genre was a deviation from the era's popular sound, a frustration with conformity in the music scene. When "punk"  is  the popular sound, it obviously isn't really punk anymore. The spirit is sort of lost.   Also, I would never want to be associated with the "punk" clique at my school. They are just as bad as any other clique. I never hear anything from them but a bunch of gossip about their other hardcore individuals who happen to all dress exactly the same. Every REAL punk rocker has a Xanga Online Diary ©! If you want to be REAL PUNK, go buy some CHUCK TAYLOR ALL STARS ©. Fucking whores. And do you ever notice that a REAL HARDXCORE PUNK ROCKER knows the words to any song by Britney Spears, 50 Cent, or N Sync?  I don't know, just fuck it. I'll listen to whatever bands I like. I feel pretty stupid for putting so much emphasis on labeling bands in the past. I'll take my MUSIC and you can keep your hypocrisy, your fashion, your hollow political revolutions, and your bullshit scene.

      I got up after a couple hours of sleep. As in 3-4. I went to Science and took a final and then listened to a CD. Then I TOTALLY went to Seminar and listened to another CD and I was all tired. Then I went to German and listened to ANOTHER CD and watched Nazi Toy Story. Then I went to PE and listened to ANOTHER CD. That was my awesome day at school.

       Stand-up comedy quoter:  You know the type. They have no social skills so they feel the need to repeat ridiculously long comedy routines that nobody wants to hear in order to try to get attention. They frequently enter a conversation with, "Ahh dude I just thought of something funny." Grr.    Truck Trader  reader:  Why are kids always reading this damn thing? When they don't even have a license? Yeah...it's a magazine...where people sell trucks. They look at it in pairs, saying what they see: "Dude, it's an F-150!" "Dude, it's a Dodge!" That's right. Same for paintball people, reading their silly  P8NT  magazine: "Oh my god, Angel!" "w00t, Phantom!" Grr.   Guy who has heard of every band imaginable:  No matter what band you mention, no matter how obscure, no matter if they even exist or not, this person has fucking heard of them and been to one of their shows. Sometimes they'll get real clever and throw in a "Dude I moshed so hard" or something like that. Grr.   Spontaneous Rapper:  Some of these African Americans (C) just HAVE to be rapping some horrible fucking song at ALL TIMES, with their headphones around their neck way too loud. Nobody wants to fucking hear it. Grr.

      "When we hear the ancient bells growling on a Sunday morning we ask ourselves: Is it really possible! This, for a jew, crucified two thousand years ago, who said he was God's son? The proof of such a claim is lacking. Certainly the Christian religion is an antiquity projected into our times from remote prehistory; and the fact that the claim is believed - whereas one is otherwise so strict in examining pretensions - is perhaps the most ancient piece of this heritage. A god who begets children with a mortal woman; a sage who bids men work no more, have no more courts, but look for the signs of the impending end of the world; a justice that accepts the innocent as a vicarious sacrifice; someone who orders his disciples to drink his blood; prayers for miraculous interventions; sins perpetrated against a god, atoned for by a god; fear of a beyond to which death is the portal; the form of the cross as a symbol in a time that no longer knows the function and ignominy of the cross -- how ghoulishly all this touches us, as if from the tomb of a primeval past! Can one believe that such things are still believed?"

      What the world needs is a remake of the song "Glycerine" for a Listerine commercial. Just imagine it: "Listeriiiiiiiiiine, ooooooooh Listeriiiiiine." Fuck yeah.
