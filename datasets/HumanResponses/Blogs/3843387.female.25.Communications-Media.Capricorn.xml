       * My name is Amrita Das, Amrita Mathur, Amrita Das Mathur, Ammu.&nbsp;  * I was born on January 8, 1979, in Cuttack, Orissa. In the eastern side of India into a dysfunctional family.   * I am Indian - a half Punjabi, half Oriya married to a Rajasthani Kayasth.   * My only sibling is my pain-in-the-arse elder brother who is married to a rather nice lady.   * I am passionate about reading: currently reading - Don’t stand too close to a naked man – the autobiography of Tim “the tool man” Allen. Did you know his last name is “Dick”?   * I love summer sunshine, clear blue skies and green grass.   * I like it when it rains coz then I can have pakoras with my chai and get gooey in the head.   * I am very fat, I have always wanted to taller and thinner.   * I hated school coz no one understood me – I was always the weird kid.   * I actually studied in college and got a scholarship. Egad! College is also where I met my security blanket – Apoorva.   * I am an official law-school dropout.   * I have made a career out of nothing at all. I trade words for green paper.   * The person who got me into writing was my college professor – Dr Mukesh Williams, who also made the world’s best green ginger tea.   * When I dated Apoorva I used to be so nervous I could not eat in front of him. So he would eat and I would watch.   * Later we swapped roles, now I comfort eat and he watches.   * I am obsessive about socks – especially coloured ones with funny graphics – my favourite one right now is a dark blue pair with a black white cow on the side and it says - party till the cows come home.   * I play Scrabble online and offline. I love it!   * I love taking pictures with my little digital camera – because there is no reel or processing charge just need to charge the batteries and I am good to go.   * My Nana used to take me to the British Council Library during my summer holidays and I still am a member even here in Dubai. Every two weeks I like a good child go return books and rent books.   * I used to like drinking beer till Vodka happened to me.   *&nbsp;I have had some crummy jobs and then a yummy boss and a dream job at Netaphase.   * I love to paint. I am not good at it and feel sheepish about my creations. It is a compulsive disorder.   * I like to drink lots of chai – Lipton Yellow, English Breakfast or Makaibari Bio-dynamic when I am truly feeling haalloo. Especially after my meals.   * The only coffee I like is Starbucks – Café Mocha – for that chocolaty zing.   * I have a sweet tooth. I also like all baked products – croissants and lemon tarts. No wonder I am fat.   * I am moody and can be quite nasty when I am down in the dumps.   * I am a cleanliness maniac who once in a while sacks out only to come back with a vengeance.   * I have an acid scar on my right arm and a wax burn on my left leg – both very painful experiences. They say I would be considered brave in Germany.   * I remember things in minute detail – yes, you are so-and-so, born there-and-there and when I met you - you were wearing pink shoes, if you get the drift! Especially the details and plan of the house I grew up in SO.10, Cantonment Road, Cuttack.   * Sadly I remember birth months rather than dates.   * I love dogs and can get extremely emotionally attached to them.   * I write long letters to my Nana, who writes back equally long letters to me.   * I adore some of my cousins to bits.   * People with no sense of humour and a value for money attitude tire me.   * I like colour. Does that make me rangeela? Aha! Everything in my world is colourful. – Vivid bright shades, especially of the blue, green genre.   * I enjoy watching funny meaningful movies like Raffoo Chakkar, Golmaal, Dil Chahta Hai, Bend it like Beckham, Lost in Translation. Humour should be used to communicate a host of emotions including loneliness and loss.   * I’ve quit smoking. I’ve quit a few times before - my longest non-smoking stretch was a year and a half and hopefully this will be forever. But every once in awhile I get extremely tempted.   * I enjoy cooking and baking – I like the radio playing in the background when I am in the kitchen.   * I am very particular about my shoes and bags. Always spend on that and on perfumes – Narcissus, Red, 7th Avenue, Green Tea, Woman…sigh!   * I love herbal skin care products by Clarins, Body Shop and Biotique. I have an entire ritual before I sleep and Apoorva loves imitating me.   * I love stationery shops and bookstores. I like buying sharpeners, erasers, notebooks and pencils.   * I love Ikea and their furniture. That is one shop where I land up spending loads of the green paper.   * I like marmite on toast. It works for me especially well when I am all sulky.   * I am emotional, sensitive, protective and possessive with my close friends.   * One of my fears is my computer crashing. It has happened to me once and it ate lots of my work.   *&nbsp;I am scared of heights, the dark, ghosts and clowns.   * I grew up reading the Sesame Street Dictionary and Walt Disney’s Fairytales. On television I used to watch Tom and Jerry (VHS) and Chitrahaar on Doordarshan.   * I want to learn Arabic to know what the lyrics in the songs, how to drive without banging into things and swim like a fish.   * I have coloured my hair several times and am sick of it now. Planning to stop colouring.   * I have three holes in each ear. My Masi says you can hang me in the clothesline with my ears.   * My favourite possession as a kid was my blue teddy (given by Masi) that is now with my Mum.   * I am very sentimental about anything that Apoorva has given me. I still have all his letters, cards and notes. When I die, bury them with me.   * I have chronic pollen and dust allergy. I am supposed to be on anti-histamines every day but take them SOS. I break into hives and sometimes choke when my allergy breaks out.   * Still, I love flowers – carnations for me symbolise romance.   * I like smelly things (Aha!) like aroma candles, incense and pot pourri, have lots of it in each room of our home.   * I do not have any credit cards. I do think I should never be given any. I am an impulsive compulsive shopper.   * I love Hugh Grant and all the movies he has starred in.   * I like long tub baths with lots of salts and foam. With some background music and time to reflect.   * I cannot stand close-minded, orthodox, racist folks who give no room for speculation or re-considering fixed notions.   * I am judgemental with judgemental people.   * I like watching water. The sea, the creek, lakes, ponds, just sit there and stare at the water, I can do that with lava lamps as well.   * I do think I am very lucky to have Apoorva.   * I like Vincent – the song, and Van Gogh the painter. I think his brushwork is truly amazing and the colours he uses are very striking.   * If I could go back in time I will definitely change a few things in my life. Smack myself for every time I opened the fridge door for starters.   * I love Putti. My nanny-cum-loyalist. She brought me up when I was little and constantly told me I was the best, which has led to some truly deviant behaviour on my part.   * I like things labelled, organized, neat and in their original place. Or I bite.   * Random acts of kindness touch my heart.   * I like Maggi. There I have said it - hydrogenated oil, cornstarch and all. I like those damned instant noodles. Also like Wai Wai.   * My first guy was called Vimal Bhagra who I truly cared/care for and that ended in a tragedy, completely my fault.   * I love writing – as you can see, also write poems, stories and articles.   * I like messing around with Photoshop and other picture software. Make collages etc.   * I have had imaginary friends and I have spoken to air/myself.   * I am grateful to have some people in my life. I hope they know that.   * If I have kids, I’ll ensure they learn to play a musical instrument before they’re 10 (only if they enjoy doing it, of course) and read a zillion books, i.e. if I have kids, not sure about that as of now.   * I like watching several shows on TV – That 70s Show, Fraiser, Oprah (when she has them on interiors – which I am obsessed with), Zoe Buisek – Wild Card, Drew Carrey etc.   * I have had two dogs – Cherie – who died in childbirth, the pups died too and Mischief, who screwed my brain and now lives, with Mum. I do not think I am getting any more pets or living things e.g. plants, kids into my life, too much responsibility and commitment.   * I prefer summer to winter, sunshine to moonlight and football to cricket.   * Someday I shall have my own book with “me name as the author’s name”, it will be something funny and sad.   * When I was ten, a goose in Hyde Park London once attacked me. It wanted my lunch burger. I was saved by a bobby and have ever since had something in my heart for men in uniform.   * I used to write diaries. Now I have a journal and yeah a blog!   * I was a vegetarian by choice of ten years before becoming a non-vegetarian after landing in Dubai. Blame it all on the blasted shewarmas! (Is there anything called a He-Warma! Sic!)   * I am a dreamer. Have it all in my head and expect each one of my close friends to follow every silly little detail that happens in the misty haze.   * I like solving jumbled words and crosswords.   * I worry that my reflexes are slower than normal.   * I once climbed a water tank on my Nana’s roof to see Ravana burning during Dusshera.   * I love going to Neemrana hotels, and I like hotels in general – all that room service, spa and pampering.   * Got a soft spot for wall-to-wall carpeting.   * I have a hyper active imagination.   * I like songs like Avril Lavigne’s Happy ending, Alicia Keys’s Falling, Prince’s When doves cry, Chitra Singh’s Jab naam tera pyaar se, Jagjit Singh’s Hothon se choo lo tum and Tumko dekha to yeh, also Hindi film songs – Hum tumhe chahte hain aise.   * Apoorva and my song is: Yaaron Dosti by KK   * I need money to buy Apoorva, close friends and myself things and travel.   * I collect pebbles and things from the sea from my various travels.   * I have shoeboxes full of memories.   * I cannot do without my cellphone and email. I need to stay connected.   * My favourite Lord of the Rings (Yes! I have read it) character is Sam Gangee. I can identify with him. Apoorva would be Frodo – anyday, only he could trust a Smeagol.   * Forms of expression and expressiveness interest and impress me.   *&nbsp;I completely, fully, absolutely hate cockroaches.   * My favourite comic strips: Calvin and Hobbes, Cathy, Peanuts, Pooch Café, Hagar the Horrible, Garfield, Lockhorns, Marmaduke, Heathcliff and Ziggy.   * I like recycled paper products a lot!   * I do believe what goes around comes around.   * There is so much of me – MY God! And there is still more – literally!&nbsp;

        Absolutism    There are no absolutes for something so relative as a human life.  -Hugh Prather, Notes to Myself  Funny how it seems true when you read it in a book. When I say, at the age of 40, I want to write a book. When I say I want to be a hair dresser for 2 years. When I say tomorrow I want to meet this person, go this place, finish this much work, wake up at this time, and wear this. So how often have things gone the way I wanted them to? And how often have the results been exactly the way I wanted them to be? And how often, when the result has been the way I wanted it to be, have I been as happy as I thought I would be?   Has it happened to you that you wore this outfit that you never imagined yourself wearing 6 months ago, just because you had nothing better to wear, and got more compliments for it than on a day you meticulously planned your dress code? What are the chances of you making more close friends in 6 months of working than you did in 4 years of graduation? Has someone else's question ever given you answers and shown you realities that were always in your face? How often have things been perfect? When you do come across things that ARE perfect, how often is it that you planned them? Have you ever been bitterly disappointed that perfection was too perfect and lacked spontaneity, and hence, wasn't perfect after all?   So is symmetry perfect? Is asymmetry not beautiful? Isn't the now more important? Aren't mistakes more important than failures? So would you really like a spate of winnings and no losses at all? Is what I dream to be tomorrow, stopping me from being me right now? Is the life I am leading what I want? Am I living or existing? Is it wrong to want to live? For that matter, is it wrong when at times, you want to give up and don't want to live? Is it wrong that you don't want to be strong? But if you are, does that mean you are superior? Does that make you a better person? So who is a good person? If a social worker, who helps unknown people improve their lives, beats up his wife, is he a good person or a bad person? Are you a good person? Are you bad? Are you never bad? Does bad mean wrong? If you are being bad in self defense, is that wrong or correct? Did God put you/us on this Earth to make a point? Does he have to? Is there a point to everything? Should there be a reason for living? If you don't achieve all that you dream of achieving and are still content, are you a loser because you didn't get what you wanted or are you a winner because you don't want no more?So are dreams really important? Am I really important? 200 years later there will be no trace of this magazine or the person who wrote it. But the ideas will persist. That makes the thought important, more like significant, than I, the creator or thinker of these thoughts.   I may get two minutes of fame in the future, when I am 40 and dying of lung cancer. Is that worth wasting my youth doing what I don't want to do then? Is doing what I don't want to do really a waste? If not, am I gaining something here?Should you gain something from everything you do? If you gain nothing, is that an experiment that went wrong? So how can an experiment, where you cannot really predict an outcome, ever go wrong?   If you gain a lot, and you think you gained from a mistake, will you repeat the mistake, even if you know making it the second time would be harmful/hurtful/stupid? But if you do gain, isn't the mistake much better than all the corrects you have done in your life?So can you really control your life? Can you say with certainty that at 9 am tomorrow you will wear a red T-shirt and eat eggs for breakfast? So what is definite? Is anything? Does definite give you a sense of security? Is security tantamount to safe? Do all these questions merit answers? Does anyone have the answers to them? Are these questions really questions or statements with a question mark at the end?Does that matter at all?  ************************************************************************************* I am a question mark reincarnate. This is my mind being me. As for the time, I wrote this after I read the book Notes to Myself by Hugh Prather, at a particularly complex and crossroad-ical juncture of my life.  ] d e e p a [

      Silence of the Crowd  It's not enough. Or is it?Flowing water. Curbed thoughts. Expression suspended. Spiraling smoke.An amulet encircling my thumb. Uncomfortably numb.I want more. Or not. Will I stop looking?This is the beginning.Or the end?No I am not stoned.Blinking cell. Blue and white.Disgusting noise. Eclectic psycho-babble.Long hair. Unfinished looks. Bald man; doesn't smoke.Spiraling smoke.Crystal ashtray. Pen moving. Thoughts astray. Crumpled tissue..Non blank cheque, enclosed inside. Uncashed yet.Trying to hide or reveal.Noisy water. Crowded train. Beaded nose ring.Not too bored. No motion, of thoughts or feet, or things, living or unmanifest, just water.Silence in words. Words of silence. So who defines natural? Conservative courts? Closed minds?Filthy, rotten books, wormed into by aging decay.I don't want to be Jesus. I don't want to be an angel.I don't want to be anything.  Being John Malkovich. I don't want to be him.  ********************************************************************************** I wrote it partly on a crumpled tissue paper and partly on the backside of an ICICI credit card bill envelope. I put down the first thing that came to mind when i saw&nbsp;OR felt anything.   ] d e e p a [

       The Birthday Speech  I don’t know why Shona has asked me to speak at her birthday. I’m not good at these things. Don’t like giving birthday speeches. I’m afraid that I’ll come out to be too critical or my jokes will fall flat. I’ve known Shona for such a long time, and there are times I feel that I don’t know her at all.   Shona likes her space. I’ve never known anyone who likes quiet time so much. She likes her quiet in the morning just when she gets up. She reads a lot. She likes interesting people. She has her mood swings. Does one talk about such things at a birthday party? Remember, I will be competing with the wine for attention.   Shona’s friends are a mixed bag. There are those that have 9-5 jobs in financial corporations. I met another group some time ago. They were second generation Asians discussing the body as a space for cultural identity. I know that Shona’s interested in culture. She did a degree in it. She grew up in three different countries. I don’t know what she calls home. She says that she’s a cultural anomaly. She smiles when she says this. Must be hard not fitting in. Making friends knowing you will have to let them go in a few years. Having to explain your life over and over again to people who nod their heads but don’t quite understand.  I don’t understand these discussions on space and identity. For me space is full of stars and planets. I know that Shona wanted to be an astronaut when she was small. She was one of those chubby Indian kids in England. Her mum used to dress her up in frilly dresses with white knee high socks. If you ask her now, she will tell you that the 1980s was the era of bad fashion. A well-meaning family friend told Shona that she was too fat to be an astronaut when she was 7. Shona lost interest in space after that. Exercise is something Shona caught on to since she started university. Now, she’s in India and her relatives tell her that she’s too thin (and too dark) to bag a husband.   Life is full of contradictions. I never thought that Shona would end up in India. I know that she was scared when her parents decided to move to Kolkata into the arms of a conservative family. She moved with them. A concrete jungle for a girl who grew up in a small English town, a tiny rain forested equatorial country, and ended up in the leafy suburbs of Sydney. She misses her green space. She misses her independence. Her snot has turned black because of the pollution. She has also grown up.   There are a lot of things about Shona I could say. I don’t know how appropriate they would be for a birthday. I know that she wishes her clever/quirky younger sister or that her best friend/boyfriend were here. Neither of them will be. One remains in London and the other in Sydney. Maybe that’s why Shona asked me to give a speech. I sit here racking my brains. I’ve never written a birthday speech before. What does one say?&nbsp; &nbsp;  ~shona~

						    urlLink    Every morning I wake up - not to the twittering of birds but the grizzly sounds of motors. Sounds that sound like a witch's wail, like wind caught up in a valley. I do not blame them. Eh! Them...the poor construction workers who are slogging their butts off in this heat nor the company that supports the millions that they hire. After all there will be a shiny new building and lots of people will have nice rooms to live in. Now that I have put my most sucrose foot forward - hand me the friggin ear muffs! At the rate at which they are digging - they will hit oil - and I shall be drenched in the grease.  Ode to the Oil  Dig away Bob the Builder thou shalt ruin every morn with thy gut wrenching howl thou shalt unearth the heart of the earth by thy gutter-goo gutter-goo in my imagination I shalt think of it as the pigeon that did the doo in my balcony sill  Someday! Someday!  I shall wake up ....to Norah Jones's sunrise sunrise....and the sweet smell of jasmine, sparrows shall chirp and I will step out into green grass and squint my eyes to see the day leaking out of the clouds and swamping my world with a warm fuzzy feeling.  Today! Today!  When I walk passed you I shall smile and think of the dreams in my head. ~And know for a fact that insanity is a blink away~

						   The past few days have been hectic. Gosh! I could never have imagined that I would be wishing for more hours in a day. But then here I am blogging away to high heaven. Well, I got a job offer – with a company based in Dubai called CPI. There are into corporate publishing. I am going to be writing on IT and IT developments. I feel happy that I got a chance to work out of the country. I am apprehensive about starting on a line that I have no clue about, but I am excited to the very bone. The boss lady told me that I would not be attending, as much to my personal emails and projects online coz now I would be working fulltime. *Nay* I do not think so. It’s been awesome online blogging, there were times when I felt like a pirate on a ship keeping my log – spaceships make me pukey so we will stick with the water ship eh! I will be starting on Sunday. Will keep updating on what all has been happening. As of now – there have been many new additions to my wardrobe – a business suit, shirts, trousers, black socks but I could not make myself buy plain black ones – these have coloured heels and toes atleast they do not say “I am in love with some bunny” *sigh*. My social life too has become very happening. We went to a party last night, loads of vodka and good food. Also been invited for another party – I am doing good! Planning on getting a French manicure tomorrow, zindagi ki chotti chotti kushiyan, cannot wait to get my first pay-check and treat Apoorva at Thai Chi. I am going to be working from 8:30am-6:00pm and will be off on Fridays and Saturdays.  Wish me luck.  ~~Cheerio~~

						   BCL day today, the books were a day late but the nice lady smiled, did not put a fine and said "do not do it next time" - now haven't I heard that before. Apoorva will be off to India soon and I need to think about whether I want to join him or not. I want to go. But then there is work here. ~Damn~ Need to get this sorted before I miss this chance.  I watched Ek Hasina Thi and I must say it is a bloody good flick. Very fast paced and gripping. Good choice of actors for the roles. Saif has got such a good body to carry of those tight fitting suits *yum*. Even if it is a remake of a Hollywood film (I doubt it though, perhaps inspired) it is a real good attempt. There are some really good flicks coming on TV today to combat the India-Pakistan match TRPs. Good for me.  So off to TV watching I go.

						      The SIMHW (Stuck in my head word!) : Dandelion  Dandelion: any plant of the genus Taraxacum; especially : an herb (T. officinale) sometimes grown as a potherb and nearly cosmopolitan as a weed.  Word History: Dent-de-lioun, the Middle English form of dandelion, makes it easy to see that our word is a borrowing of Old French dentdelion, literally, "tooth of the lion," referring to the sharply indented leaves of the plant. Modern French dent-de-lion, unlike Modern English dandelion, reveals to anyone who knows French what the components of the word are. The English spelling reflects the pronunciation of the Old French word at the time it was borrowed into English. The t in dentdelion probably disappeared early in Old French, having been absorbed into the related sound of the d. The earliest recorded instance of the word occurs in an herbal written in 1373, but we find an instance of dandelion used in a proper name (Willelmus Dawndelyon) in a document dated 1363.

That woman rocked she is like the icon for all wives out there. She could have between the crap out of thirty aliens and forty ninjas. Poof! She could easily have raised the dead, someone call the medics and enroll her under CPR traumatic shock therapy. Apoorva I still think you should thank the Lord for me.  And Raghubir Yadav, someone please hug the guy and tell him he will always be our darling Mungeri. Theatre talent going down the drain ...the ways of this world!  It pains me to see people like Raghubir doing Gayab and people like Shah doing Asambhav. The Asambhav&nbsp;Literally! 2. Godbole: How can you go through life looking the way you do? You made me feel good about myself.  Godbole: To mein complaint kiske baare mein likhoon – jo dikhayi nahi deta, woh bat, bhagwan, ya tum dono ke baare mein, agar tum yahan se do minute mein nahi nikle to mein tumhe gayab kar doonga. &nbsp;3. The RGV fixation: We have a lovesick pup in our hands. Had RGV (Ram Gopal Verma for the uninitiated) an ounce of courage he would have convinced Antara Mali to have plastic surgery to look like Ms. Matondkar. Each frame, each outfit, each look, each dance step and you can see the oomph queen pouring forth, it is Urmilla all over. And poor dear Ms. Mali who has to earn a living needs to pander to such obsessions. Maybe she wants to cater to them - aha!  Kinda cute was the fact that she was called Mohini. If all of us remember the not-so-long-ago flick called Mein Madhuri Dixit Ban Na Chahti Hoon and Madhuri's name in Tezaab we can sure make a connection, is Ms. Mali trying to say something?  Well, RGV is sure not listening, Madhuri can go raise her family and colour herself green, but it is only Urmilla who gets RGV's testosterone rocking. Why is this a redeeming feature, coz we ALL love masala!  The movie's verdict: A damp squib  My favourite scenes (yes, there are two): Mohini mein bhagwan bol raha hoon and Tusshar topless in the end – Oh! I could have died!  Least favourite scene: Robbing the bank that was so lame.  I do not mind Tusshar Kapoor but he needs to seriously work on his diction and delivery.  The movie is nicely shot. Some nice angles used by the cameraman.  All in all a below average product please do not waste your green paper on it.  No points for guessing that the viewers were Gayab from the theatre even before the movie ended.

						   I have had the most blissful weekend ever. Apoorva has spent two days simply being by my side. We went shopping yesterday - browsed and looked, debated and talked, walked hand-in-hand.  Then I had to sit and gulf down grilled prawns from the Japanese place at City Centre food court. Got sick. Worshipped the porcelain. Felt crummy. Apoorva made me hot tea and at night cuddled me and tucked me in *bliss* even read a book for me. Gosh! What is happening? I did start thinking is he like having an affair, then I said what the fuck, lemme just put my feet up and soak in the sunshine.  This morning the tummy felt raw. But my head was on cloud nine. We had a strawberry milkshake breakfast made of fresh strawberries *yum* watched a Hindi movie Inteha. (Movie: Stupid story, great outfits though!). Then twiddled my toes, got the laundry sorted, had lunch - chicken, dal and roti *yum yum*, then Apoorva made me tea again&nbsp;and now am feeling ultra smug. My mailbox was brimming, and that makes me so-so pleased. Nice long mails from nice people. Sigh! My life is so peaceful if I want it to be...  Still stuck in my head is Sunrise sunrise..looks like morning in your eyes.  I finished reading Tim Allen's auto-biography - funny but&nbsp;hardly an auto-biography more of a stand-up comedy act. More like a monologue.  Modhesh, have you seen Modhesh? That smiling yellow caterpillar at all the roundabouts, malls, the truly huggable mascot ever! Modhesh, modhesh....looks like smiling&nbsp;little Modhesh... I want to see Gayab? Has anyone seen Gayab? Can anyone see Gayab? :p When will we have a rain shower? Soon soon...  &nbsp;

						   It is 1:38am. And you know what is buzzing in my head - mera naam calendar, mein chalaa kitchen ke andar ball maango bhaiya, zara zor se. I am slowly but surely loosing it. Current state: AC draft on my head, nose is running, allergies are active thanks to me being around the carnations, basking in the glory of love and affection, feel the need to reply to letters, yet been lazy about that, want more effective time in my day, so looking forward to the weekend&nbsp;- that from a person who is&nbsp;not working full-time, sick of reading blogs about Kerry, Bush, Martha Stewart, what not - why why why - do this to yourself, want to hit the gym big time,&nbsp;thinking about the Rajasthani girl at Antique Bazaar&nbsp;who is so much better than Ms. Vanity Fair, thinking also about&nbsp;when I can get a good back and neck massage (sigh!), hoping that I find hidden treasure,&nbsp;twiddling my&nbsp;toes&nbsp;and so to bed I go.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;

						    urlLink     Swami came rushing into the room – “yeh toot gaya, sorry”  I smiled, “arre, kaanch ka hai, tootega nahi to kya hoga?”  Reassured he chugged along.  It had knocked against Swami and had shattered.  Just like that! It broke…  A wedding present that had been with us on many a night of merry making with friends.  Now no more, just like that.  Time for me to lay it to rest in the dustbin, without a eulogy, without an epitaph, next to the spent tea leaves of the morning and the crushed beer cans of last night.  Time for me to say goodbye to it and sit and mull over the non-existence of the sixth glass.  It is just an object. A materialistic possession and that too one that had been utilized for whatever it is worth in green paper. And I am but human to have attachments.  So all this is very normal.&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;

						   I used to hate surprises. They really bugged me to no end. You know something is up in their sleeves. Yet no one would tell you and in the end you land up with something you did not want, did not need and there you were grinning and saying “thank you” when you really could not have cared a rat’s arse.  This week Apoorva and Kapil surprised me. Standing in my pyjamas. I could not believe that Kapil was actually here in Dubai, in this blistering heat and for three days I could talk like I had verbal diarrhoea. I felt like a kid, in a huge candy store. What bliss!   Now I have changed my mind I like surprises. When they constitute of people that make me smile. It feels so darned good, good to the very bone, and my laugh lines are now neck-deep in trouble. I will be the happiest wrinkled old prune around the block. And I really do not care.

						   Requirement. Met up with a provision wrapped up in slush. Soaked and torn. Ink leaking the edges. Of a once remembered address. Raindrops. Satiated earth. Wind caught up in gusto.  Leaves trying to erase the memory of dust. Dust trying to cling to its dear life. Remembrance. Nights of rain. Wrapped up in the arms of warmth. Passion trickling out of the windowsill. And into the local drain. Reality. Wind, Earth, Water. Evocation to a muse called fire. Lost in the midst of return. Realization trapped within parameters of dust.

To resolve the pain For my solitude lies in your answer

						   "Everything in moderation." See, now this is my biggest problem.  I think that there are probably no wiser words than "everything in moderation" to keep you healthy and well-grounded.  After all they came out from the mouth of Buddha and the great wise honest Mathur boy around the house.  But, you see, that just ain't me.    I live my life (and always have) in much more of a Lazarus Long-esque style -  "Everything in excess! To enjoy the flavour of life, take big bites. Moderation is for monks". I can just hear you all cringe as you read this.  Sorry man! I know I should put that chocolate brownie back in the fridge or the garbage but then it is only just a brownie and my tummy could sure do well with one of these.   I have always tried to enjoy.  "Enjoy what", you ask?  Well, basically everything.  I never want to sell myself short on any experience.  I want good bed linen for when I sleep (after all you spend most of your time in bed – ahem!).  I want real butter in my meals.  I want laughter everywhere I go.  I want big pastel balloons up in the sky saying “I am alive”.    There are certainly drawbacks to this type of philosophy.  I'm much heavier than I should be and I don't have nearly as much money saved as I'd like or for that matter at this moment I ain’t hearing much of that familiar “kaching”.  But on the other hand, Apoorva and I are a happy family and my laugh lines just get deeper and deeper.    Personally, I think it's a fair trade-off. So tell me, is that really so wrong?

						   Pehla ya Doosra?  Let’s face it. We today cannot live without the idiot box. It is after all our biggest link to the outside world and at times to home itself. But then the term home has become relative over the years.  The local television channel service we opt for is called Pehla. We fall into the bracket that is called the Pehla Silver Subscribers that offers the same bouquet of channels we watched when we were in India – well almost.  Anyhow the due date for the payment was July 6, 2004. Here goes what happened.  July 3, 2004 Apoorva the diligent honest boy that he is calls Pehla.  Apoorva: Hello, I need to pay for my subscription Customer Care: Sure, we will take care of it. We will send someone to collect it Apoorva: Yes please do that (gives details)   July 4, 2004  Apoorva the diligent honest boy that asks me if anyone from Pehla has come. I say “no” and hop along like a careless care bear. I am caught in the neck and told to call them and remind them.  July 5, 2004 I call Pehla I: I need to pay please send someone asap or you will chop off my connection. Customer care: Well, you are calling after 5pm we can only send someone tomorrow. I: Well, we called earlier as well Customer care: Only possible tomorrow I: But you will cut off my connection Customer care: Well, I cannot say anything about that it is not my department I: Then whose is it? Customer care: You are calling after 5pm no one is here to help I: Well, you are there Customer care: Yes  I: What’s your name? Customer care: Eithaad I: Please leave a message Eithaad that we called  Customer care: Ok  July 6, 2004 No sign of Pehla, the connection gets cut off Apoorva calls them up, by now smoke is curling out of his ears.  Apoorva: What happened guys? This is just not acceptable. This is truly bad customer service. We have been calling for ages please take your payment.  Customer care: Sure sir, we will be sending someone asap to collect payment after which your connection will be restored. Apoorva: I have been calling for ages. Customer care: We will be sending someone to collect your late payment. Apoorva: Just do it fast ok.  July 7, 2004 Man comes, collects money, no sign of the connection coming back. Apoorva calls customer service.  Apoorva: I paid restore my service. Customer care: Your payment is late so wait till our systems get updated. Apoorva: When will that be? Customer care: I pray to God and hope it shall be soon. Apoorva: Soon is when? Customer care: Inshallah soon.  July 8, 2004 No sign of Pehla. Apoorva gets SMS saying - thank you for paying. He cribs, complains, but is sick so crashes out in bed and blames life!  July 9, 2004 No sign of Pehla. Apoorva completely looses his cool. I am watching him become a raving raging monster all violet in colour. In this state, a bit short of gun in hand, Apoorva calls Pehla.   Apoorva: If my connection is not restored I am going to…. Customer care: Please press two buttons on your receiver  Apoorva does that and the connection comes back We go about our day with a renewed faith in the Almighty.  P.S. The mentioned dates are not completely accurate. After all this is written under the influence of half a bottle of vodka and a lot of grilled chicken. However, the sequence of events is completely authentic.

						     CrankyCritic: When Woody Allen phoned you did he tell you what the part was?  Hugh Grant: It wasn't a phone call, that would be too intimate. [laughter] It was a fax that said "I'm doing a movie about such and such and there's a part of someone who appears to be incredibly charming, well bred, nice englishman who turns out to be a shallow bastard and I thought you would be perfect."

						   Dear Mr Grant, Sigh! What would the content of this letter read like? I have watched each one of your movies with the anticipated glee of a six-year-old watching a Ferris wheel or better still a hungry two-year-old looking at a chocolate chip cookie ice cream that too with extra chocolate sauce.  What can I say ...errr...write...Oh! Sod it you blubbering fool. Oh! That is just I talking to my other self. The point, the pointless motivation - meet me at Starbucks for some Mocha and arbitrary conversation!  Perhaps I could sink deeply into those blue pools you call eyes. And watch you as you lean back your head and clasp your fingers behind your divinely brown hair. Ah! Yes, I am a fan. A huge one, ever since I have been through the reels of About a boy, Four weddings and a funeral, Notting Hill, 9 months, Mickey blue eyes, Two weeks notice, Love actually and the absolutely awesome Bridget Jones’s Diary. When one – errr…the two of us heard of your English Masters degree from the New College, Oxford University, one could not help but sigh some more. Wish it were the same year. We could have sat on the hemline of green reading poetry to each other and watch the ducks paddle along, what merry mirth it would have brought? What a pity!  We heard of your leanings towards all that is brown, often being called a brownie because of our origins being in the oh-so-brown part of the world, one could but help feel it would be celestial destiny, karmic caper or twisted fate if we were to bump into each other accidentally.  A tryst. A tale. Perhaps even a tongue ‘n cheek tête-à-tête. Who knows? But then nothing can be left more to the meanderings of life.  When the rooster crows hour five and the first earthworm gets picked up for breakfast by the cranky crow, and the old café guy opens his outlet, coffee mug in one hand, cigarette in the other, I shall wait.  And you shall stagger along to where I sit and look me in the eye and say, “eh! Have you seen where the loos are?”… Awaiting your response, Sugar-coated Brown.

						   And, before I sign off for today and say good night to the template and this hot room with no ventilation I would like to add a special note for Apoorva Mathur. Who is an overworked, helpless soul living on the hope that weekends would someday be holidays.    It is not Apoorva's fault how can you blame a person who was called Hanuman the minute after he was born.    Apoorva. He is the kind of guy you wake up in the middle of the night and say "water" and he mindlessly (if there is such a word) walks to the kitchen and gets you a glass and falls right back to sleep and remembers nothing in the morning. It is a pity there is no difference between his days and nights. A classic case of brains in your calves.    Apoorva. Powerpoint presentations and Excel shortcuts. Apoorva is the kind of guy you would like to introduce to your parents. Sweet and nice. And, let him stay with your parents while you go out and party.     Apoorva. The less said the better. I will save some more for later.    Arhar dal and steamed rice. Mishu treadmill a new escape route to China. Badde log badde log. You never starch my collars. Apoorva. Appu. Oopie. Oopsie. Oopinder dhak dhak dhakinder. Hot Maggi and Horlicks Milk. Bright sunshine on Andrew's Court. Would you come to Creek Park with me? Say something nice to me na. Apoorva I think I have lost the ring. Tora Tora rides. Running away from ghosts in the middle of Coorg. I feel scared to tell you I will be travelling again. I do not want this life for us. I want to be home with you. Sigh! I am still sitting near the LCR, Wuthering Heights in hand, staring at your window....with your undies hanging there drying in full view....I will always love you my soulmate.

						   The night catches up with me  There are those silences Long and dark I wait for daylight to stay a bit longer And let out a squeal of pain As light goes out of my brittle bones  There is no hope in my world There is no need for a helping hand My cries shall not be heard from this dungeon And finally those silences Will be crowned king of my land I have no reason to wait  The sun has set There is no moon The clouds wary of every passing bat There is no inclination left 		 The soul sold needs no salvation	 There is nowhere to escape  I wrap those silences around me like a shawl Holding them close  When sun shines again  I forget to notice How can I think of anything else Draped in those silences.

						   Hello, Wizard.  Character Stats:   Rogue (2) Warrior (8) Wizard (28) Paladin (7)  Your Profile:  You're intelligent, educated, and just a bit superior to everyone you know. If you're still in school, you probably make A's, if you're not too bored to waste the effort. If you work, your annoying boss relies on you to solve the problems no one else can figure out. You've never met a puzzle you can't solve. When it comes to leisure, you'd rather read, play a strategy game, or surf the 'Net than run around getting sweaty. You're a brainiac, and you're not ashamed to admit it.  Above all, you're a mastermind and a great thinker. You see the unknown as territory to be conquered, and the mysterious as something to be systematically unraveled. You don't have time for fools; you only spend your time with people who can comprehend your obfuscatory convolutions. You enjoy amassing knowledge, both useful and trivial.  Your Mission:  You were put on this earth to enlighten people. They will listen to you, because they are impressed by your vocabulary, your erudition, and your ability to grasp concepts that invariably elude them. You are the one who has to figure things out, because let's face it - you're the only one smart enough.  Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to Discover Something. Something small, or something big. Find an unknown insect in your own backyard. Discover a cure for sunburn. Develop a faster way to get the dishes done. Calculate the number of molecules in the Andromeda galaxy. Discover a comet. Discover SOMETHING.  And do make it a priority. The Famous Adventurer of Silmaria has a crystal ball trained on you, and will be noting your progress.  A Warning:  Try to remember: you're not infallible. If people around you are all nodding and smiling, it may just be because they don't have the faintest idea what you're talking about. Check your facts and admit the possibility that even you can make mistakes. Loosen up. Make friends with a Rogue and have him or her try to poke holes in your theories. Who knows; you might actually have fun.  On another note - making plans and formulating theories can be quite stimulating, but at some point, you are going to have to actually DO something. Employ a Warrior, if necessary, to put your brilliant schemes into action. Just be sure your instruction manual is written in very small words.  On my way to Hogwarts to re-educate Harry Potty :-)

						   I have a friend. Great writer and a helpful sort who got me into this online networking jazz. Lots of time at hand. Doing only 8 articles a month - thought what the heck -- let's give it a shot. It says atop the page - online business networking - Rotract - Lions - several names whizzed passed. Thought oh cool! Now here's something "oh-so-professional-I-cannot-breathe". Till. Till lo behold alas.  Testostrone-driven purile creature infested. It shone for all its worth. I sat there - short, fat, married (that too happily), middle-aged and balding and wondered --- ahem! in some virtual world I might convince myself that people still want to date me. But in reality I am good. Doing good - and being happy in my normal mundane ways -- it is called being SMUG! I laughed. I sniggered. I had fun. Then revulsed and regurgitated. No! I did not puke just wanted to use the word regurgitated - it sounds so cool na! Now I have something to write about ...I am like Sam the Wise in LOTR - I am in Book Three and yeah loving it!! Greece won - Apoorva is sulking. I have no comments. You need to know something to comment na! I think I am so naive when it comes to sports like the other day the semi-finals were over and I did not even know - how DUH! is that huh?!? But then I am good. Yes, that is my latest tune. You see I have realised I am not weird. Yeah! I remember I wrote everyone is someone's weirdo but I am not...not me ...naay (Apoorva Brit style) no way....you got to see what freaks move about...no kidding!!! Watched Bridget Jone's Diary for the nth time. God! Grant me my wishes. Coming up letter to Grant. ~~Toodles~~

						   Pril - A concept  Two days ago while doing the dishes I could not help but think (blame it all on the heavy lunch I had had) -- my dishwashing liquid smells divine. It is Pril in a strawberry and vinegar fragrance and one cannot help but think of strawberry shortcake each time you pour it into the cleaning sponge.  That got me thinking further (tic tic tic)…. Why did Pril not really click as a mass product in India? I though of a plan - a concept and put it in words. This is very amateurish and childish. But then I have justifications at hand and plenty of free time that permits me to do such pointless projects. And you have the sorry status of undergoing my inflictions.  Brand name: Pril Product Category: Dish washing liquid Company: Henkel Region: India  Urban concept The urban woman in India (and yes a majority of women still continue to slave over the sink while the so-called stronger of the species sit in front of their idiot boxes newspaper in hand demanding a cup of tea with that extra dollop of sugar) mostly has a lot to do.  In between going to the office, getting that manicure, visiting the gallery and attending that networking party it is tough for her to cope with all the housework errr… homework. This is where the vacuum cleaner-grinder-mixer-cooker-and-cleaner all rolled into one comes into play. Oh! Yeah baby, the Bai, the grumpy stoic woman who comes in every once in while and ponders over the state of your shabbiness. The Bai is essential. The days she does not come in - you lie there like a hapless helpless distraught soul with no purpose in this world. So making your Bai happy ought to be a paramount purpose.  The campaign is: Make your Bai happy today - and she will come everyday and say what a fantastic super woman you are.  The Play : Making Laxmi Bai a happy Bai Players: Laxmi Bai and You (a 28-year-old working woman who looks 18 and wears trousers, got shoulder-length hair and have the cutest smile any angel could possess). Running time: 2 mins Script: *Ref* Laxmi Bai walks in Laxmi Bai: kal ka party kaisa tha memsahab mein suno bahut log aaya bartan bahut hoga hum kitchen ko jaata *Ref* Camera wheels into the pendulum movement of Laxmi Bai's butt as she moves into the kitchen space You: Party was a hit Laxmi Bai aur ab aap bhi hit hone waale ho Laxmi Bai: Kya bolta hai re tum memsahab mein hit nahi flop ho jaayega abhi itna bartan *Ref* You produce Pril  You: Yeh hai tumhare liye  *Ref* Laxmi Bai uses Pril and is amazed Laxmi Bai: Yeh kitna achcha hai - kitna fast aur yeh khushboo ekdum mast. Ab mein top Bai bann jaayega memsahab tum kitna achcha hai. Hamara kitna dhyaan rakhta hai uss khaddos Mehta memsahab ki tarah nahi. Is mahine I take no chutti *Ref* You amazed You: Kyunki Laxmi Bai bhi insaan hai *Ref* Both hug Jingle: Laxmi Bai ke muskurahat pe ho nisaar, Uska dard le sake to le udhaar - Pril iski naam hai  Rural concept The rural Indian woman is not different from the urban one (she too has to add dollops of sugar to the much demanded tea) only with one itsy bitsy difference she is the Bai and obviously cannot afford a Bai so lo behold why should she use it. Now this is where the ab jaan ke liye kaise jaan rahe kicks in. She uses it to keep her hands soft because hands are essential to her love life (ahem!)  The campaign is: So what you are a Bai - you too have dreams and desires.  The Play : Laxmi Bai is after all a sexy Bai Players: Laxmi Bai and her husband - Pati Dev (think Rajpal Yadav), Voice over (think Raza Murad) Running time: 2 mins Script: *Ref* Laxmi Bai does a catwalk across the room to a corner where her husband is lying on the cot resting Laxmi Bai: Aaj saare bartan ho gaye aur jaan ke liye jaan bhi *Ref* She winks at him and puts her hands on his cheeks *Ref* Pati Dev screams Pati Dev: Yeh haath hain yah kaanta ka jaad Laxmi Bai: *distraught* kya karoon Voice over: Ja beti memsahab waala Pril leke aa yeh tere suhaag ka sawal hai *Ref* Laxmi Bai buys Prils and realises that it is not that expensive Laxmi Bai: Bas 50 rupai aur yeh to teen mahine chalge mera doosra detergent to 15 rupari aur who to 15 din chalta hai - isse to bachat ho sakti hai *Ref* Doing dishes smelling the detergent and getting in the mood *Ref* Done the dishes and cat walking across to Pati Dev Laxmi Bai: Aaj to na nahi bolne doongi *touches him - wherever client wants* Pati Dev: Sach much kaafi naram hai *Ref* Pati Dev covers blanket over both of them. Jingle: Kitna pyaar vada hai do matwali boondon ka. Pril masti mein dil jume yeh kya kar dala hai mujhe sambhal   *End*

						   The huge banner over Gulf Greetings (a store) at the Burjuman shopping mall read “Happy Father’s Day” the tiny fine print below it said --- send a card today. Father’s Day, Mother’s Day, Sister’s Day, Brother’s Day, Kiss my dog’s butt Day – what next I thought as I shrugged my shoulders. I got the cards and the letter paper I needed to write back to all the folks who had written to me and I came back home. On the way, sitting in the stinky cab, the Afghani cabbie hitched up the volume of the radio “kaisa jaado dala re” …I sighed, I shrugged my shoulders as he checked into the rear view mirror to notice my reaction. I looked out of the window still thinking about Father’s Day and all the Dads I knew or friends of mine who are soon going to become Dads. The pansies whizzed passed. Pink, white, pink again.   Play: Swami –That’s why   Characters: Swami – A magician, who comes to my house twice a week magic wand in hand and makes things sparkle. Me – Ignorant lonely soul aching for good conversation.  Setting:  My bedroom. Swami is wiping the windows and I am sitting on the bed with my correspondence in front – writing paper, letters, cards etc.  Dialogue: Me: Kitna saal ho gaya Dubai mein Swami Swami: 15 saal ho gaya na  Me: *Sigh* Achcha tumhe ghar ka yaad nahi aata Swami: Aata hai na isi liye apne paas mobile hai na woh log phone karta hai Me: Kaun log, tumhara biwi Swami: *Smiles* Me: Achcha ghar mein kaun kaun hai Swami: Biwi hai, do bachcha hai, ladka, ek 6 saal ka aur ek 3 saal ka Me: Kitni baari milte ho unko saal mein Swami: Saal mein kahan, do saal mein ek baari company bhejta hai Me: *Shocked* Kya baat kar rahe ho, do saal mein ek baar Swami: Kya karega, hum log 5 bhai, 4 Dubai mein Me: Aur panchwa Swami: Woh ghar pe, usko bola tum sab biwi, bachcha log ka sirf dyaan rakho hum sab paisa idhar se bhejega Me: To kitna bhej pate ho mahine mein Swami: Bhej deta hai sirf apna biwi bachcha ke liye 1000 dirhams (Rs 13,000) Me: Kaafi achcha hai na, par bachcha log ka yaad to aata hoga na Swami: *Smiles* Chotta waala baby to mujhe pehchanta bhi nahi hai Me: Arre Swami: Nahi nahi pehchaan ke bhi kya karega, Papa to wohi hota hai jo bachcha log ke liye kuch kar sake. Woh engineer ya doctor banega ya idhar ko aayega to uske paisa to hona mangta hai na. Me: *Sigh* So to hai  Swami: Par yaad aata hai na kabhi kabhi Me: Sirf bachcha ka Swami: *Smiles* Ab hum kitchen karne ko ja raha hai.  I put my correspondence away.   Wishing all you proud daddies and going to be daddies – Happy Father’s Day – and for all those who got this and are not all that daddy-like what the heck ….have a blast of a summer and if you are wondering – Swami does exist and he continues to be the wizard of the moment – beating Dumbledore and Gandalf hands down!  Cheerio, Ammu

						   Apoorva is just back from his first trip to Europe - Amsterdam and London. He visited the Van Gogh museum. Promised to take me there. I am speechless. Wordless. A pilgrimage. He has got me loads of reprints and a poster. Just the thought of being close to Vincent's palette. Sigh. The more I think of it - the wider my smile gets. The poster is of the Yellow House in Arles. ~Gosh~ Will go and swoon some more. ~~Cheerio~~

						   Pangs of Plastic was written after I came to Dubai for the third time. Anyone who has been here would notice the pink and white pansies on the roundabouts and the plastic-ky look of the Paris Gallery girls.  Well, it is open for interpretation and is what I call my "lesser known works".  I am off for the day now ...will catch you later. ~Toodles~

						   The pansies are nodding. I think it is the heat that motivates them to doze. As though taking the cue the sprinklers burst into what looks like a monsoon shower. However, it is artificial. Just like the smile of the air hostess who serves you sweets. I miss the smell of rain pouring over dry earth. A scent that I will always associate with home, Mom would then run helter-skelter trying to save the distressed laundry on the clothes line. I would watch. Sitting there in the verandah as the battle between her speed and the drops would ultimately lead to a draw. The frogs and earthworms used to seek shelter in the house making the dogs seek shelter under the bed. The memory of a German Shepard trying to escape from a mutant slithering worm is an image that still brings a smile onto my lips. The fragile sequence of my thoughts is broken by the sound of the nearing bus.   The bus is sparsely populated. A fat balding man with a wart on his chin tries to leer at the pretty girl who sits with her wicker shopping basket on her lap. Her friend stares back at the fat balding man making him look away sheepishly. A lady hollers at her enthusiastic excited children to calm down. The driver whistles a popular tune. The pansies are now a whirl of pink and purple.   My destination has arrived. The new plaza smiles and gleams in its capitalist hue. I sit at my desk trying to entice people to try the new perfumes gracing the shelves of the store. It’s just another day. Perhaps, a trifle different, I do not think it really matters. I look at you glancing at the store window and ask you to come in. “Would you like to smell our new perfume sir?” As you smile I take out the tester.  You decide to purchase it. “Gift pack it will you”. I go about my assigned errand with dexterity as you pay the cashier “yes, it will be paid by plastic”. You make the relevant signatures. I smile the air hostess smile and hand over the bag.  I watch you as you walk over to my counter. You perch the bag over it, slip in a note and leave it there. I run across, open the packet and find a pansy stapled on a white piece of paper. Was it in the bus, or in the plaza, maybe on my walk to the stand, or perhaps at the park, is that where you had seen me, noticed me, scanned me and made adequate conclusions on an intimate front. I will never know as I watch your black overcoat slip out of the main door.

						   Does moonlight have any color? I can sense it in the skies It is not a silver grey as they say But a blue sun-kissed hue Of days forgotten Of nights remembered Of the smell of jasmine thick in the air And burnt out lanterns that smell of kerosene The skin burns The mind becomes a hollow An incessant endless pit Of senseless notions The inky blue overtakes the corner sign And awakens the memory of a once loved address It is all bundled up Tight and curled  Knotted and kept  And as I turn around the kerb The blues take over my mind!

						   I have been so shameless about the writing on the blog bit. But atleast I make amends. We are now in Dubai . Apoorva has settled in well into his new job. I am still writing for Netaphase. I do not think I can ever stop writing. Now have this violet journal that contains some fifty-odd poems.  Apoorva's new role is called the Assistant Vice President of Human Resources, I have been hiding ever since.  Mischief is now with Mum. There is not a single moment when I do not think of that stupid dog. Damn! She screwed my brain. Aditya is coming over this weekend for 2-3 weeks.  Dubai is splendid. Party city. I just need more hours in my day. Been reading Lord of the Rings - Completely in love with Frodo. Will write more later. ~cheerio~

						   News Apoorva and I have been given an opportunity to relocate to the land of sun, sea, sand, surf and shopping (what more can a girl ask for!) - Dubai. He will be joining ABN AMRO Bank as the Assistant Vice President Human Resources(my my doesn't that sound important) so there is lots happening.  Think will keep updating once in awhile till the time I get there and my computer is shipped after that one shall put all bloggers into the Hall of Shame with my blogging capacity.  I have also been working on this scrapbook and I must say it is turning out splendid. All these bits and pieces of memories joined together into one space. A slice of life itself. Guess, when we are ancient we can flip through it and smile and kick ourselves in the butt that why did we not do it differently. Sigh! Zindagi ki chotti chotti kushian.  Cheerio, toodle doo, till next time guys have fun and keep the faith.  Oh! Before I forget ummmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmuah to one and all! Shall write next time till then "sheikh it baby!"

						   Ahem! Eventful weekend, not-so-eventful weekday. Apoorva is the patient sweet one. I am the impatient sour tout. What to do! I feel claustrophobic. Frustrated. I want to draw, paint, write, jump, scream, dance, run round and round. And, all I do manage to do is sit on my desk and type inane insignificant garbage. Sigh! Well, this is karma. Whether one likes it or not, one has to do it. Blue skies, green grass, yellow daisies nodding their heads, pink sash, a wagging tail, plain white paper, a drop of ink....a picture, stuck in my head yearning, struggling, fighting to get out. Life is tainted. Life is what happens when a dream is squished. And, you can hear the squish every single day, each moment when you do something you had not imagined yourself doing. Work that clogs your mind. Play that locks doors, shuts windows and throws the key into a placid lake. What is meant to be will be. What about what was not meant to be? Does it just lie there in a black silent hole? A place called nothing. Only time will tell.

But, then the quote - Everyone is Someone's Weirdo, comes to mind! There is this soul I know and there is nothing I desire more than wanting to take a run-up and kick her in the butt. Sigh. Zindagi ki chotti chotti kushiyan. Satan. Devil. Lazarus. Stay away. Keep your hands of me. Evil thoughts. Pure Mischief. Chewing gum in hair, pin in seat, chalk powder on the rear or plain imagination - what fun. Being evil is such fun and so fulfilling.

						   Every day I am bombarded In each direction that I turn By those who claim that EXERCISE Causes flab to crash and burn!  I did jumping jacks and sit ups Went out and bought that darn machine The one that guarantees in 30 days I'd be trim and fit and lean...  I put it in the extra room That we affectionately call the "gym" With all the other paraphenalia That will one day make me slim!  Ab mats for doing crunches A small tramp to run in place That awful, go-nowhere pedaling bike That only leaves me red of face!  I have workout clothes and sweat bands Even a "get-fit" coffee cup! But that scale hasn't budged an inch So, I'm on the verge of giving up!  I've just about convinced myself That it's true what some folks say... You have heard it too......Eat Right! Get Fit? Die anyway!!  So for those who are devoted To trying to make me over, PLEASE! If God wanted me to touch my toes He would have put them on my knees!  I believe He loves us as we are That includes both big AND small So when I reach the gates of Heaven It will be with flab and all!

						    Rebellion and Romanticism     The night - limitless darkness, A black hole engulfing all thoughts, The picture of James Dean on the table.    The clothes yet to be ironed, yet to be washed, scattered on the floor,  a floor that loves to be walked on, the rug eaten by many Winters.    The arena for some poetry, Wordsworth and his daffodils, Shakespeare and his Adonis, Sidney's Astrophel and Stella, sources of inspiration.    The smoke from the last drag of a  cigarette end, an air of solitude, I cough,  trying to focus on romantic thoughts,  as a fly tries to grab a bite from  the sandwich leftovers.

						   Pause. Think. Blink.    I have a pet. A dog to be precise. A mongrel.    White with black patches. Black with white patches.    A cross between a Border Collie, an Apso, a Toy Pom. and a Daschund with some Terrier blood thrown in. She is not noble.    Mischief is a mistake of nature. There is no way to aptly define her. There is nothing right with her. Though there is nothing wrong with her either. If you can overlook the breath problem that is. Very cat-like is some ways and very unlike a dog in other ways.   Perhaps the dog world's answer to Alicia Silverstone. For Mischief sits on a tartan cushioned cane basket. Sipping on her Cerelac Milk and dabbing her face with only the best of dog hair care products.    The life of a star. And, yet her talents lie primarily masked. No one sees her legal aptitude or for that matter no one bothers to check beyond her sleek body. She has a brain. A pea-sized one.   Someday she will shoot to fame and her treadmill-taut body and kniving brain will beat the hell out of all headlines....move over CSE, Coke, Pepsi, Salman, Arbaaz, who else and what not....Mishu is on her way....so what if it is in the wrong direction and potty training was not on the cards...no one is perfect not even Shilpa Shetty.

						   Posted on 06/08/2003 16:17:13 Blog. Frog. Dog. Hog. Nuts.    No, that does not rhyme. It was not meant to. It was a statement.   I am still trying to figure how this work. Forgive me for being so tech-illiterate. But, people like me do exist and techy snobs have to just live with us. Hopefully by tomorrow I ought to have this figured out...if not then too bad!    I do want to have a simplistic format which provides me certain creative freedom. What the heck! Who knows! Read a couple of intellectual blogs. Some of them about sensitive issues. Judgemental. Sentimental. Some where just plain Mental...anyway...to each his own and God for all. Cheers to the world and a kiss for the roses.

						   For all those who wondered why the carnations picture never got uploaded, well I have some issues with my computer. It does not seem to acknowledge the fact that I have a digicam. This is a new phenomena so bear with me till I sort it out. And don't even think of suggesting using the installation CD coz I lost that two years ago. ~Mega grumps~ *Though still basking in the glory of Mamsa*

						   About an hour back a little darling called Mamsa came and kissed the life out of me. There I was with Swami minding my own business and about to open the house, fidgeting with the keys and mumbling like an old man when I spot this white tuft running along straight at me. Kaboom! She went for me and I had to succumb! There was the miniature, pure-white Apso licking me to high heavens. Bliss! Paradise! After 6-months of not having touched a dog – there I was relishing each moment. Damn! You should have seen her – soft and cuddly, I could have hugged her for hours. Then came along Mark and wanted to take her away coz she is his and she ran into the house and didn’t want to leave. Omigod! By then you can imagine my state - I was like a pool of gooey liquid on the floor. So we said our fond farewells and promised to meet again. Mamsa babes you sure made my day! And I so hope Mark has many a party nights to attend so that you can get some time with me. Talking of adorable pooches, the Mathur boy (ahem! I am going to be kicked in the rear) is currently in Ajmer and shall catch the night train back to Delhi. Sigh! Miss him like MAD! After Swami the house shall be empty only Mr Fry for company and the thoughts of another work day up ahead. Kya yaar! Hmpfh!

						   Mummy nature was belting it out over the weekend. Whether it was Charley boy over at Florida or for that matter the Himachal lake that is warning residents to get outta the way! Why mummy, why art thou so cross? Then there are the Olympics and I can’t tell you how bad I feel about the shooting team. I can understand that it is a sport that is based a lot on luck (I would know) but Ms Bhagwat – please you could have made it to the finals. I was so excited about you. I am sure you too feel mega grumps. Anyhoo, that happened. Then misery and dismay and I got over it as Mayoites galore flooded the house to meet up and I must say it was great fun meeting up with folks who had seen Apoorva in his knickers when he was 10-11 – time for me to turn around and say “cho chweet”. Apparently the Mathur boy was a harmless creature even then! Apoorva left for India last night on official work. I am mighty upset man! He will get to meet all our buddies while I type away about hard disk drives and memory chips. Sigh! But I shall keep my spirits up, the hot tea brimming and shall face this week in a newly found (sic!) enthusiasm. The Hippopotamus promises to end within a day or two and I got Mrs Dalloway the Woolf book – never read any of her writings so really looking forward to that and also to do some hardcore scrabble sessions. Song that is stuck in my head is “kaisa jaado daala re” thanks to the cabbie who gave me the cheesiest smile and said “good Indian mujick” – yeah great! Oh yeah and have I told you how many folks have wished me happy independence day – real sweet! Can’t help but feel for folks in India who missed a holiday coz it falls on a Sunday – my heart goes out for you man! And Apoorva in case you are reading this, you remember the crisp white t-shirt you have – the collared one – yeah! The one you have great sentimental value for – it turned pink and I had nothing to do with it. The damned mutant washing machine – not me, not me, nay it wasn’t me! Happy Independence Folks! Off to type away I go. ~toodles~

						   Apoorva and I had one of our silly little tiffs this morning. And, guess what, he sent me a big bunch of red carnations at work with a very sentimental note. *sigh* I am so goddamn lucky! Cannot wait to get home and upload a picture of these really pretty buds. *smug*

						   The weekend was fantastic! We watched - Around the world in 80 days – Jackie Chan is brilliant! “Action is not all about I beat you, it is about telling the story”. We ate like pigs and slept like hippos. Please note all are rather large creatures! Well, realisation did dawn on us and left us giggling and doing our “oh my god’s”. You see, all this while we thought our front door was locked but ahem! It was not. It was an open door. We have had road trips, night outs, I lived alone, all thinking I am safe and there my front door lies unlocked waiting for all evil to creep in. None did. And we are fortunate. Also, made me conclude that we live in a rather safe building, in a rather safe Dubai and luck is definitely by our side. Imagine had my CD collection been robbed or for that matter my Van Goghs (now, don’t they sound like originals – well for me they are!) *shocking* I would have been lost. Totally and completely. We met up with Andy who gave us more shocking news about how BIG companies were lying to their employees about what sort of work they would be doing in Dubai when they join. Very sad indeed! Why? Why? For green paper, to get the most of green paper, is green paper that relevant? To change lives? To destroy lives? Why? Apoorva also made classifications between being pampered and being controlled that was helpful in solving some unresolved issues. My mission today: whirled peas! Rest as they can chug along in their vile wicked ways.  Apoorva is off coming weekend. Me home alone, me with tissue box, me sniffing, me curling up with Stephen Fry’s Hippopotamus (a shocking yet funny book! Chose it coz of the identification with the title! No Apoorva this is not self-depreciation not after the last two days, this, my dear, is reality). I also discovered a ‘dream’ tailor. So, shall indulge. Also had the nice people at Clarins gimme a call for a facial *bliss* Went for it, and as always it was very relaxing, shopped a little, now how can I not do that! It is the first day of the week for me and I just am still, so smitten about writing. Clickety clack, clickety clack and so my keyboard goes. And so to work (errr and so to cater to my word addiction) I go.

						   Those anti-biotics are taking their toll. I am so tired. Apoorva just cleared the entire laundry, cooked and cleaned and I am still sitting here holding onto the computer, avoiding reality in a huge way. I just hope the doc does not ask me to continue with them *sic*. I also hope this weekend I catch up on my sleep. There is a surprise birthday party coming up and I am keeping my fingers crossed that I do not start snoring rather than wishing. Now I shall go and say nice things to Apoorva. And so to maska-maroing I go.

						    "Félicitations!" as it is said in France or "Mazoltov!" which is how the jews say "Congratulations!"Not far from where I used to live two years ago, there is statue of the great french writer Honoré de Balzac. This work of art was made by Auguste Rodin. However, the sculpture was at first refused by the authorities. It was showed only in the middle of the 20th century because Rodin had represented the Balzac not wearing a suit but in his pyjamas or rather in a dressing gown. The latter used to write during the night. One day, there will be a painting of Amrita Das-Mathur in her pyjamas somewhere in a National Gallery or a Guggenheim Museum...I will fight for the its right to be shown!

						   Today, a colleague said he had read my blog. *shell shocked* *I could have choked on the friggin hot tea* Felt strange, yeah I know, that this is for the whole wild wide world to see but then hey - it still did manage to make me think....what had I written...lemme hide my drinking habits ....those dirty dark secrets ....what next?...what now?....talks on corporate ethics, policy...etc etc... Then I remembered I needed to breathe. Took a deep breath, said something redundant and highly silly and ran for cover (well, as fast as I can in my size). Well....damn! I ain't giving up blogging....I gave up on the website...and anyhow this is now a compulsive disorder. Well, to prove the point, I am blogging from work - aha! Wicked! No ya, just finished work, about to get home. Apoorva has already gone and I am mighty jealous. But then I had loads of new work that I need to understand. And that takes time!  Well, work is good - a bit tedious coz I dunno my topic too well, but I am getting there! So far smooth sail. No, I did not trip and break my incisor on the first day itself. It's allright. It would be wrong to say I do not  miss Netaphase - I miss it like MAD! But then this is good in its own place. Plus, I have a feeling it will get better with time. Like today I was speaking to this colleague who has a passion for modern jazz - man! It made me miss Sundeep all the more... There is so much happening in my head. Apoorva is off next week to India. I was scheduled to go but then the job happened. I will be home alone - that sucks! No one to listen to my sermons. Ok! Time to get home, pour a drink, curl up on the couch and give my views on the ways of the world. So to home I go.

						   It is  official ! I am no longer unemployed. That means I am employed. I actually  am ! I shall be joining a company called Corporate Publishing International (CPI) tomorrow as a Press Writer. I went today and signed an employment contract that told me so. My timings will be 8:30-6:00 with an hour-long break around midday to twiddle my toes and have lunch. My off-days will be Friday and Saturday giving me a 5-day work week *bliss*. I have been informed that my work shall entail both writing and editing mainly about Information Technology. For more info about the company (oh! My) please visit the corporate website:  urlLink http://www.cpilive.net/  Wish me luck. It is going to be tough waking up at 6 rather than my usual between 10 and 10:30 – plus ….it would mean not wearing my pyjamas for a majority part of the day – now that is sacrilege. From now onwards life in Dubai shall be divided into two time eras. Before Employment (BE) and After Employment (AE), the rest as they say has already made retail history! So now you have the official info...yes, once you sign a paper that says Employment Contract, its got to be official. Tomorrow will be my first working day after my last working day at Netaphase that was January 15th. Now I know I continued writing for them but then that ain't the same as smashing the alarm, getting grumpily dressed, eating breakfast in the car and running to your desk and replying to a gazillion mails. And coming home in the evening like a lump of tied knots. That is heaven. Going back to it after 6 months. Months of house shifting, getting sick, going to Al Ain, cribbing about the sun, shopping my heart out, having house guests, throwing house warming parties and getting depressed over change. *Sigh* life is what happens to you while you are busy making plans (betcha Apoorva would said "na re, it is wife not life"...*apprehensively smug*
