       My study break starts today till 13 June 2004. Final exams come thereafter, for a week. I need to cover four units this semester - Computer Engineering 203, Physical Electronics 203, Linear Systems 201 and Mathematics 277. So most of the time, I'll be at home doing my revision. For not-so-most of the time, I'll be going to university for two practical tests and a drink or two with friends on Saturdays. Darn it, I still have one last Linear Systems assignment due on 4 June 2004. Caution: Most likely I'll be hostile during this period...

       Guess what? I've been through hell and back for two weeks straight!  Last week, me and my other 4 team members were busy with our Computer Engineering assignment final assembly and finishing touches. We were given around 2 months to come out with a detailed proposal that involves building consumer electronics using microcontroller system and low-level programming. Curious with what we proposed? We did Robotic Vacuum Cleaner. With a push of a button, it will starting vacuuming its way through your room. And we'd Christened it with KonChiang. Before that was Vacky and RVC. We didn't include the motto that we came up with in the proposal though - 'cleaning has never been this easy without KonChiang'. By the way, 'Kon Chiang' means 'clean' in Hakka. For the uninitiated, Hakka is one of many Chinese dialects.  This week, I'm to hand-in two laboratory reports for Computer Engineering and Physical Electronics on Thursday and Friday respectively. So there goes my beauty sleep session. My bed hasn't feel any warmth from me as of now. Didn't get proper sleep for the past weeks and worst, I'm haven't slept for the past 50+ hours. Well, I did some quick few minutes nap but that's it. On top of the laboratory reports, I'm to demonstrate a working program to simulate a real life lift control system. It was fun though albeit the tonnes of hours debugging works in the laboratory.  Luckily, it's all over now but then here's the unlucky part... I'm down with fever now... with  one last Linear System assignment due on 4 June 2004 before finals come knocking my head in two weeks time... *sigh*... :(

       My dad got us a new  urlLink Xerox Phaser 3115  laser printer recently. The 2 months old Epson Stylus C63 is still working but dad has long for a laser printer. Since then, I have had love-hate relationship with this new device sitting next to the family desktop PC. Love it for its high quality and fast print-outs but hate it for its user-not-friendliness. I'd wasted 30 minutes earlier (papers and toner as well) trying to get it to print double-sided page, multi-pages per page, etc. Hate the paper feeder too. Went to Xerox web site to look for new printer drivers but to no avail. If case you're wondering - no, it has nothing to do with printer driver. It's just me always trying to have the lastest in everything software/drivers/updates. Bah... never all that now. At least I got all my 80+ pages of lecture notes, assignments, etc printed out already. Thanks for wasting my youth and giving me frustration, Xerox Phaser 3115!

       Went to watch  urlLink Troy  with my friends last night. It's a good show with lots of fighting scenes. Good news for the girls because they get to watch Brad Pitt and Orlando 'Legolas' Bloom sweating their way out. But bad news for the guys because no cute girls. It's supposed to be a 2 hours 45 minutes show but 15 minutes of it got censored off. Obviously the sex and gruesome scenes were filtered out. Maybe I should get a DVD version of Troy just to check out how babies are made in the ancient Greek, hehe... *evil grin* I don't get much of a surprise when watching Troy because I do know some Greek mythology - meaning I know what's gonna happen next at every turn (well, almost). For more info on Greek mythology, go to  urlLink Mythweb  or  urlLink Greek Mythology Link

       Went to watch  urlLink Around The World In 80 Days  with friends last Saturday. Didn't really wanna watch this one but then I was bored at home. Well, you'd guessed it - it's another one of those Jackie-Chan-save-the-world movie. Man, enough already!  This time, Jackie has to 'steal' back the Jade Buddha that was stolen from his village. Along the way, he met a scientist and a young female artist. And no, that girl didn't fall for Jackie but instead, fell for the scientist. Together, they travelled around the world but each of them has their own agenda. Jackie to bring back Jade Buddha to China, inventor to win a bet and artist to seek inspiration. And of course, a smooth ride doesn't make any sense, right? We get to see only London, Paris, India, China and United States. Hey, where's Malaysia?  One nice thing to note about this movie is that it features a lot of stars cameo appearances - Karen Mok, Sammo Hung, Maggie Q, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Rob Schneider, Kathy Bates, Owen Wilson and etc. I heard "hey, isn't that 'so-and-so'...", throughout the movie as people around me trying to show off their knowledge of celebrities. As always, Jackie Chan's movie wouldn't be complete if there's no kung-fu scene. The kung-fu scene that I enjoyed most was when Jackie and his 'Ten Tigers' brothers (yes, ten of them including Jackie) fought with The Black Scorpions dudes. Another thing, what's Arnold doing in a movie? Shouldn't he be busy with those political stuff now?

       Went to watch  urlLink The Chronicles Of Riddick  with my classmates the night after my last final exam. Actually we wanted to watch Shrek 2 but then the timing wasn't right for us. I mean, who would want to watch movie at 5PM or 7PM? Was having dinner with classmates at Pizza Hut at that time. Needed a good laugh to celebrate but then... *sigh*...  Anyway, The Chronicles Of Riddick is a science-fiction movie. It has Star Wars feeling to it but then it's not the average good-versus-evil thingie. Here's the twist, it's about fighting evil with another evil. That another evil being Riddick of Furya (Vin Diesel). If you don't remember who's Vin Diesel, maybe the mention of XXX and Fast and Furious would help? Lord Marshal of Necromonger was main evil. His main agenda is to conquer every universe and convert all other races to his supposedly more superior Necromonger race. Lord Marshal and his huge fleet of soldiers wanted to kill Riddick because he was a Furyan and didn't want to convert. Apparently, Furyan is the only race that Necromongers afraid of and Riddick was the only descendant of Furya.  Riddick is a loner and didn't want to have a piece of all this action but because Lord Marshal somehow pissed him off and also has his long-lost female friend in captivity, he has no choice but to kick Lord Marshal's ass. Long story short, the girl died and yes, Lord Marshal died too. And Riddick became the new lord of Necromonger. What an ironic ending eh? By the way, you would notice some repetitive, catchy phrases throughout the 2-hour movie like - 'Convert now or fall forever - Lord Marshal', 'Just passing through - Riddick'. The way they said it and the situation that they were in made it sound corny.

       I'd finished my final exams last Friday. And again, I've been sleepless for few days. Hopefully it's worth the sacrifices that I gave in for the past three weeks. Results will be released on 16 July 2004. Wish me luck. Next semester starts in 2 August 2004. So now I'm having my holiday break *yay* and I can feel that my social life slowly seeps back into my life. I can sleep, watch TV, online, clubbing, hang out and enjoy myself for however long and whenever I wanted to. First thing first - need to built my body back. Haven't been doing any gym since March 2004. Also in the list are spring cleaning on my notebook, Pocket PC, bedroom and car.

       Got this from a friend. Tribute to all engineers or engineers-to-be...     Today's Lesson  Girls must be convinced, so learn to promote yourself. Convince them that 'Engineers are the Best Boyfriends'. Let me tell you why girls should eventually marry an Engineer over a Law, Management, Arts or Medical School Graduate. He has three distinct advantages over the rest of the graduates.   Advantage 1: Secure Lifestyle  An engineer boyfriend can provide you with a secure lifestyle. At 27 years old, an engineer probably has a respectable, stable job that gives him a high income to own a car, invest, have a comfortable life, and get married and buy a house too. Law graduates are still working as a lowly apprentice in law firm, most management graduates have just failed on their first business plan, the arts graduate is still looking for a job, and the medical school graduate is still living in a hospital.   Advantage 2: Unmatchable Industriousness  An engineer boyfriend will dedicate an unimaginable amount of his time and effort to understand you. Engineers strain really, really hard to understand their work. You can believe that they will try really, really hard to understand women too, just like how they understand their work - once they believe that you are the one. So even if they don't understand you initially, they will keep on trying. Even if they still do not understand, they will figure out the correct method to keep you happy (e.g. buy diamond ring = 1 week's worth of happiness). And once they find out the secret formula, they will just keep on repeating it so that the desired results appear. Unlike the lawyer who will argue with you, the management graduate who will try to control your spending, the arts graduate who will 'change major', and the medical school graduate who will operate on you. And you know what, it's really so easy to make engineers believe that you are the 'one'. Say that you like one of their projects and they will be hooked to you forever.   Advantage 3: Trust  An engineer boyfriend will never betray your trust. Let me first tell you what is wrong with the rest of the others - the lawyers will lie about everything, management graduates will cheat your money, the arts graduate will flirt, and you probably just look like another cadaver to the medical school graduate. Your engineer boyfriend is either too busy to have an affair, and even if he does, he is too dumb to lie to you about that.  Hence, an engineer is the most secure boyfriend that you will ever find, rich enough, will keep on trying to understand and please you, has no time for affairs, and too dumb to lie to you. So girls, why procrastinate? Get an engineer for your boyfriend!

       Went to watch  urlLink King Arthur  with friends on Saturday. Days before the movie, I'd read few reviews and heard sayings that King Arthur is not a good show. Oh well, everyone is entitled with their own tastes and opinions. For me, it was quite a good and inspiring movie.  I guess everyone is familiar with King Arthur and his Knights of the Round Table being elegant and all dressed up in their shiny armors and huge arsenals. But in this Jerry Bruckheimer's remake, Arthur and his knights are being depicted as errant knights entrenched in years of territorial battle for the Roman Empire during Dark Ages (circa 450 AD). And Guinevere is no cute princess either but a fearless warrior.  Before Arthur (Clive Owen) became king, he is a Samartian knight at Hadrian's Wall, along with his six best buddies cum knights - namely Lancelot, Galahad, Gawain, Tristan, Bors and Dagonet. They are bonded for 15 years to the Roman Empire since young. Their only enemies are Saxons and Woads.  Evil and ruthless Cerdic and his son, Cynric command the Saxons. They wanted to take down Roman Empire and make Britain theirs.  On the other hand, Woads are led by Merlin. Woads are native British tribesmen. They protect Britain from both Roman Empire and Saxons invasion. Merlin has a daughther and her name is Guinevere (Keira Knightley).  On the eve of their freedom, Arthur and his knights are given final assignment before they are liberated from Roman Empire. They are to rescue a Roman priest and a holy child before Saxons could capture them. When they got there, they find themselves having issues with the priest's ill-treatment on people. Arthur also rescues Guinevere from the priest's captivity.  At first, it was a battle between Roman Empire, Saxons and Woads. Then Arthur and his knights realised that the greatest treasure is not freedom itself but the freedom to choose. In the end, Arthur and his knights teamed up with Woads to eliminate Saxons and regain their land. After their victorious war, Arthur marries Guinevere, becomes King and reunites Britain. Too bad three of Arthur's knights weren't able to reap the fruits of their bloodshed hardwork. Lancelot, Tristan and Dagonet died in the battle.  Some of the scenes are comedic - like the scene where Bors addresses his five kids as bastards, where Arthur discovers the priest's secret chamber and how the strayed servers-of-the-God scream at Saxons that they serve God and cannot he harmed. Somewhere in the movie I heard heart-warming phrase like, "fighting for 15 years, in a land not of our birth, in a war not of our own choosing and in a cause of not our belief". And what's a good movie without any 'hot' scenes? But too bad, there's only one between Arthur and Guinevere. The worst thing is you don't get to see it as it was censored out.

       I've got my workout plan done - finally! Gym on weekdays and cardio on weekends. As a matter of fact, I'd just done my cardio earlier today. Went jogging at 5:45PM for an hour at Luak Esplanade Beach. It's only five minutes drive from my house. Proper parking lots are all occupied when I got there. And even finding an illegal parking spot was hard.  There are lots of people during weekends - from babies to elderly. Most people come here for a walk and spend time with family and love ones. It's also a hot spot for love birds. Youngsters come here to show off their new or modified cars too. Hungry or thirsty? No worries, petty traders are here as well selling drinks and food - from junk food to grill items. Anyway, hopefully I won't get bored with this new exercise regime.  Here are some shots on Luak Esplanade Beach, taken using my Sony Ericsson T630.

       Went to watch  urlLink Spider-Man 2  with friends last Saturday. It was full house when we watched the 10:15PM show. I think most of the session were packed since its premier on last Wednesday.  The story of Spider-Man 2 starts after two years when he first put on the red and blue webby spandex. Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) struggles with his 'gift and curse' as he lives a dual-identity lives as Spidey and college student plus part time worker. Because of this, he's always late and appears exhausted everytime. This has negative impact on his relationship with his yet-to-declare-love, Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst) and also his best buddy, Harry Osborn (James Franco).  For awhile, Peter declares he's Spidey no more as he wants to live a normal life and to protect his love interest with Mary before she ties the knot with astronaut John Jameson (Daniel Gillies). No worries, he goes back into the Spidey business after he notices disasters during 'Spidey no more' period. Aunt May somehow talks some sense to him as well. My guess is she knows Peter is Spidey. The plot gets complicated when Harry wants Spidey dead, to avenge for his father's death. He isn't aware that Peter is Spidey and the truth behind his father's death. Anyway, in the end everyone gets to know who's the man behind the webby mask.  Like all superhero movies, there's at least one supervillain for the superhero to have fun with. Dr. Otto Octavius (Alfred Molina), a scientist working for Harry's Osborn Corp. survives a freak laboratory accident and transforms into Dr. Octopus, a multi-tentacled menace. The fighting scene between Spidey and Doc Ock was breathtaking. Spidey's attempt to save trains from crashing is stunning and heartfelt. Lots of CGI.  While Doc Ock is a menace, he died as a hero when save the city by sacrifising himself and goes 'kamikaze' with the 'trilium' energy ball thingie. He also reliases that the tentacle attachment that he created has been messing around with his mind and made him a villain.  This sequel delivers some important lessons in life. The one I like best is when Aunt May goes, "I believe there's a hero in all of us. Gives us strength. Makes us noble. Eventhough sometimes we have to give up the things we want the most". The funniest part of the movie is when this Asian lady on the street starts singing the 80's version of Spider-Man theme song while plucking her violin as-a-matter-of-factly. Know what's the best part? You get to see the Asian lady doing her version of Spider-Man theme song on violin twice! Haha... :)  I guess we can expect to see the next sequel of Spider-Man with Harry succeeded his father as the Green Goblin.

       Got this from one of my favorite website -  urlLink MyPDACafe .    Dear IT Support,  Last year I upgraded from Boyfriend 5.0 to Husband 1.0 and noticed a slow down in the overall performance, particularly in the flower and jewellery applications that had operated flawlessly under Boyfriend 5.0. In addition, Husband 1.0 un-installed many other valuable programs, such as Romance 9.5 and Personal Attention 6.5, but installed undesirable programs such as Formula One 5.0, NBA 3.0 and World Cup 2.0.  And now Conversation 8.0 no longer runs and House Cleaning 2.6 simply crashes the system. I've tried running Nagging 5.3 to fix these problems, but to no avail.  What can I do?  Signed, Desperate    Dear Desperate,  First keep in mind that Boyfriend 5.0 is an entertainment package, while Husband 1.0 is an operating system. Try entering the command 'C:\>I THOUGHT YOU LOVED ME' and download Tears 6.2 to install Guilt 3.0. If all works as designed, Husband 1.0 should then automatically run the applications Jewellery 2.0 and Flowers 3.5.  But remember, overuse can cause Husband 1.0 to default to Grumpy Silence 2.5, Happy Hour 7.0 or Late Night Teh Tarik 6.1. Late Night 6.1 is a very bad program that will create 'SnoringLoudly.wav' files.  Whatever you do, do not install Mother-In-Law 1.0 or re-install another Boyfriend program. These are not supported applications and will crash Husband 1.0.  In summary, Husband 1.0 is a great program, but it does have a limited memory and cannot learn new applications quickly. You might consider additional software to improve memory and performance. I personally recommend Hot Food 3.0 and Lingerie 6.9.  Good Luck, IT Support
