      Its fucking cold in here. I'm tired today, so tired. I tried to get some sleep last night, it was the best sleep I've had in a while. I've stopped going on messenger now, It's a waste of my time. I've been going outside more often, I love the early fall weather. The smell in the air is indescribable. My dad is cranky in the morning sometimes. I hate that. Yesterday, I had this awful dream. Some crazy abusive bomb maniac kidnapped me and threatened to kill me if I told. I escaped by telling the police, he tried to blow up my school, but I found out and the teachers evacuated everyone. The police caught him and arrested him in the end of the dream. Things like that scare the hell out of me. The internet is a terrible thing. Its a deathtrap, almost. Some people know nothing other than the internet and they stay in their homes all day. Somebody out there pray for my brother, his name is John. He needs someone to reach out and help him. I'm trying, someone please pray for him. I would really appreciate it. Today is nice, I woke up early today. I love mornings, they are beautiful here. The sun shines just right. I don't think anyone close to me knows about this blog. I'm keeping it a secret pretty much. I think it would be awkward sharing this to my family.

      I feel so gross and squirmy I want to cry. I hate messenger and chat rooms. The men there are assholes. They want to ogle my body and be nasty. I witnessed thirty year old men naked on web cams. They are like ravenous dogs fighting for a scrap of meat. I tell them why I don't like cams, and they keep asking me to do one. That shows that they have no respect for my emotions and that they weren't listing when I told them that I didn't want to. My life will forever be lonely, and I am cursed to wander the desolate streets of heartbreak and loneliness. Ha ha I am so dramatic. Enough of woman hate men talk, it is all too common. My poor messenger crashed because it was clogged with stupid people IMing their perverted messages to me. I am not that way, I respect my body and I am not reckless with my sexual behavior. It is all to common. I don't think the chat rooms should be like this. I am sixteen, and I have ample access to this filth. Parents, think of your sixteen year old daughter. The threats of internet are disgusting. Its terrible that we Americans are exposed to high amounts of filth each day, and we continue to tolerate it. In my opinion, sexual promiscuity is not okay. There are risks like pregnancy and STIs that I am not willing to deal with. How long are we going to live like this? How far will this go? The drinking, the drugging, the hate... I have witnessed it all. This is not a world that I want my future kids to live in. Its gross and sick. We have to work together and stop this!

      I'm so bored. It gets lonely here. I talked to the dogs for half an hour. I am tired. I cant remember how late I stayed up. There is Subway waiting for me in the fridge. Its my favorite kind.   I ordered it last night. The dumpster man is supposed to be here. My parents were arguing over it this morning. I had a weird dream last night. I got drug tested today, I passed. Some guy comes over and tests me. Mmm this sub is soo good...

           You are reading this sentence, this very one. And you will continue to read it until it ends. But, that hardly makes sense when you read about what you just did after you just did it. And you are still reading. Thank you.

       I stayed up too late last night. When I woke up, it took me ten minutes to read my watch. The numbers didn't make sense at all. I've been cleaning around my room and stuff like that. I have to turn my life around or Ill be headed for relapse. When I first went home I just lazed around. Now I have to pay attention to life. Its hard. I have school and meetings, I have to step up and take care of myself. I had a monster craving for some Subway last night. I wanted a chicken, Swiss cheese, tomato, and black olive on wheat bread sub. Then I wanted a cup with that southwest sauce in it. Mmmm... That sounds so good...   Last night I ate this Mexican dish. It had beans and rice, it was from that cafe I went to. It was pretty good, not better than the sub. Oh god I want a Subway sub. I've been eating crap food ever since I got here. We don't have regular meals here, so I make my meals myself. Usually I'm too hungry to make something good, so I end up eating something like Rice Soup. I should put some peas or chicken in it. I don't eat Ramen Noodles anymore. If you've heard how MSG fucks with your brain, you wouldn't eat it either. Soup sounds really nice too. I haven't had that Progresso canned stuff, but it sounds good. The picture on the can looks yummy. I'm usually too paranoid about raw meat, so I don't cook it. I'm fucking starving so I got to go. Life is good, and I'm still clean. 5 months! whoop whoop!

        I had a dream that this fourteen year old chick tried to take my lover away from me. It pissed me off. She was blonde and acted ditzy. The man was twenty one, I told him that she was fourteen but he wouldn't listen. Damn fourteen year olds they make me feel old. They're always trying to take our men! They're just like parasites, latching on to one man until he is sent to jail and then moving on to the next. Have you ever seen the movie  Crush ? I'm talking about crazy fourteen year old bitches like that. That pisses me off SO much. There was this one fourteen year old girl in rehab and she was a flirt. Fucking jail bait! Damn fourteen year olds. Its usually the blonde haired ones. I'm eating this rice soup I made. Try it, its pretty good.   Rice Soup   Follow the instructions for cooking rice, then add a little water and chicken soup base. Don't use Ramen Noodle Seasoning because it supposedly has some MSG chemical that fucks with your brain.

       Hey all you rebel kids! I'm back home for good, no more alien abductions and other crap like that. No, actually I graduated from rehab yesterday so I got sent home. I saw this movie called  Wrong Turn  yesterday. It was a suckfest. Don't watch it unless cheesy horror movies frighten you. I had a scary dream last night. There were cannibals and zombies in it. I was trying to escape from a group a cannibal men on a jungle island. In the end I saw the cannibal group leader standing on the ground below me. I tried to tackle him, but he shot me in midair and I landed on him. We both fell into the river. I died, but the cannibal used my corpse as a flotation device. I woke up after the zombie part. I drew a lot of pictures, Ill post them someday. I'm going to go to AA meetings now. Yesterday I thought about things that go together. Salt and Pepper, Peas and Carrots, Ketchup and Mustard, spaghetti and Garlic Bread. Beer and Pretzels? Or is it Nachos? Or Pizza? I don't know. Cheese and Nachos go together. Watch this movie called  Bang Bang you're Dead . Its a good one. I got to go.

       I'm moving colonies on Friday. I'm afraid of the change. Want some good advice? Don't eat green grapes after you eat watermelon. They taste really sour if you do that. I have aqua teen hunger force stuck in my head. No one has heard of it up here. I painted Tupac on the wall, like I did Kurt Cobain. I guess they look pretty good. I'll try to get a picture sometime. (LIE) Nothing new today. I called the tard school yesterday, but I don't know if I'm in. I don't know what to write about. Yesterday I wrote a lot. Nothing exciting happened. My watch was exciting this morning. On a long ride, I entertained myself by synchronizing my watch with the clock. I wrote a worksheet today. That's pretty fun. I printed it out. It was five pages long. I have a good band for you punk rockers, its called Billy Talent. Its also some comic book name. But its a good band. Go search for it on the internet. There might be a website with more information. Before I publish posts, I use spell check. Its pretty useful. I heard that muffins have a lot of calories. Like eggs, its in that category of foods that switch between healthy and unhealthy. I don't think potatoes are healthy, that's crap. I read an ad yesterday that tried to tell me that potatoes were healthy. I don't care, they have a but load of carbs. Doesn't meat have a high amount of cholesterol? Wouldn't the Atkins diet be high in cholesterol? I remember reading a nutrition label for ground hamburger, it had 30 something of cholesterol. I don't eat hamburger anyway. Cows eat their own kind. Their food is made from ground cow. I'm such a rebel, not eating cows and all. I haven't heard anything bad about chicken yet, so I eat chicken. I played this game at   urlLink  www.the-n.com    it was fun. Play it, its called avatar high. I like to make love triangles. I'm a sick person, but its fun controlling the fate of others. I know that you like it, Everyone does. You get scored on what you do, that's the suck part. You need a certain amount of points to do this and that. Hey, find some crazy web sites and tell me about them, I'm always up for that. Give me a URL so I can post it for others to see. I keep having this thought that there is a spider with a big butt that will explode if I squeeze it. I had a dream about it too. Some kid and I were squeezing spiders and making their butts explode. It is disgusting, I cant eat sometimes because of that thought. I mean, just think about it. Imagine a tiny spider with a big butt. Now squeeze its body/head and watch its butt explode. Its disgusting! I hate thinking about it! Just image many small and black and crawly things flying from the exploded spider butt! I think that the spiders are in my food sometimes. It sucks. My mind does crap like that to me because I have a huge imagination. Don't swim in water you cant see in. Watch aqua teen hunger force on adult swim on cartoon network late at night! That's when its on, usually 10 p.m. or later. On certain days too, Try Monday.

        This post is a tribute to the post I tried to do last night, it was a good one. Im at school in another land, another dimension. The alien abductors brought me here I kid you not. Im tired I had to sleep on a love seat last night. Has anyone ever tried to sleep on a love seat before? It's fucking impossible. I went to a fair yesterday. It was so much fun. I wanted to stay forever and eat leftover fair food and ride the rides all day. I KNOW its not possible, I know you people who make things boring would say so. The only memories I have now are the bruises on my back from the fair rides. Im here at this other land, with limited internet accesss. It sucks. Its a big suckfest. God, Im such a loser with no friends. I wish I had friends. I get crazy sometimes, Im not sure if I do. But I wish that I could meet someone, like a special someone who Id be eternally happy with. There was a camel at the fair, a CAMEL! And this girl at Subway was wearing yellow pants with purple socks, like she was trying to be spontaneous.   LOOK AT ME IM SPONTANEOUS! BOW TO MY SPONTANIETY!   I wish that I could die, like by cancer. Then I would know when I would die and I wouldnt have to be afraid of dying without my knowlege. Unless, a freak accident happens, you cant ever be prepared for those. Im an immature person.
