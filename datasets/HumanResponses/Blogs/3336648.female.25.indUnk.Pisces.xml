      I promised a story about something goood happening...Well, I've come to accept my dark as night hair! I'm still going to try to get highlights in it. My Mom will disown me once she learns her Texas bred daughter doesn't have blonde hair anymore. I'm hitting my teenage rebellion late! Or is in not rebellion anymore, its being an adult making my own decisions. Either way, she's gonna flip, oops!  I had another perfect San Francisco night last night. I went home, shampooed my hair 3 more times, cleaned my room, discovered my computer has some fatal virus (okay thats not good, can anyone help me with this?), and put on my jeans and a tshirt to go over to Kelly's sweet pad in North Beach. Just as I was leaving, Jen came in the door, and we took my baked ziti and salad in a bag and headed for the big time.  Our collective good karma resulted in an ideal parking spot immediately.  We got to Kelly's, the wine was already flowing, and we sat back watching the American Idol finale, all while cracking inappropriate jokes.  Later Viet called and we had a nice little talk. Then Jen and I hopped back into the Taurus, gave the spot to some other good karma-d person, and headed back to studio 154, where I was in bed by 10:30. A perfect evening!

      I thought it was such a good idea to make my semi permanent brunette hair fully permanent, and I thought Cocoa Infusion (medium brown) was even a better idea, considering my love for all things cocoa. The color should have been called "Sharpie Permanent Black Marker" or "Midnight Sky with no Moon" or "Poopie Patrol." Its totally black! I freaked out all morning, now I'm trying to reach the next stage (what is the next stage? acceptance?) Hopefully Jeanie of Jeanies Dream will make my dream of normal brown hair come true. So far no one thinks it is bad as I think it is, so that is good, maybe I will even come to like the goth look. Except I know I never will. So lesson for everybody that I will share: always dye your hair a lighter color because its much easier to go darker thank lighter.      I'm glad all my peeps are now hooked on blogs. Its very entertaing ya'll! I will try to keep trading my stories for yours. My next one will be about something good that happened, instead of traffic jams or witch colored hair.

      Driving back from Carmel, Kelly and I drove 5 miles in 3 hours. We totally went whacky together, reverting to our younger selves, listening to gooshey love songs and playing Truth or Dare. I licked the car window like a dog, which was a lot better than calling Jen and telling her I like my a$# licked or calling my mom with that information.  Kelly had a few conversations with other delirious drivers with their windows down.  The traffic forced me to appreciate the pine trees, all seven hundred million of them we passed.  The stretch we were stuck on had no turnoffs, no gas stations, no restrooms. Kelly and I must have had good karma, because we stopped for that before the parking lot we encountered on highway 17.  Other highlights of the traffic jam from hell include catching up with all the people in my phone list, and learning that in addition to Megan and Ianâ€™s engagement, Dan and Karen are also getting married. I bonded with everyone in my family, and got to talk to Viet on the phone a record amount.  Thank you Viet for sending the helicopter with ice cream sundaes and grilled cheese to come save us. Really, thank you for the life saving philly cheese steak. Sorry Jen for not listening to you about taking the 101, and for me and Kelly being so sure of ourselves.  It gave us the chance though to slow down, think about the freedom of not being stuck in traffic, and appreciate the little things, like even though I am now stuck in a cubicle, I can still get up and do a lap around the office.

      I love meatballs. I try making  my mom's italian meatballs, and they are the size of a baseball.  There will be no room in your tummy for the pasta after you work on the meatball. I'll even divulge the ingredients: ground beef, egg, garlic, italian bread crumbs, and onions. I had dinner with some of my mom's True Italian friends, and the Italian grandmother made her specialty meatballs with raisins...supposedly the true secret! Ideally I would have mine with roasted potatos, asparagus, and tiramasu. And some tasty chianti!

      Happy Hump Day Everyone. I wish it was 111 Minna time right now! But first I have to wait out the slowest hour of the day at work and then tutor. Then the fun begins. I bet the same ole crowd will be there, maybe even Jen's south African friend. Sorry peeps, my mind is blank, but I thought I'd keep the blog streak rollin.

      To My Houston Rockets fans, today is a great day! Tracey McGrady and Yao Ming are now together as the Rockets look forward to becoming the dominent team in the West (Just read ESPN.com if you dont believe me!) Waa hoo, that makes up for the pain of my menial tasks at work, which included taking papers out of binders and recylcing the paper while reusing the binders and being the third person down the chain forced to make fed ex labels. Does this matter in the grand scheme of things. No, it is a proton next to the mount everest news of the Houston Rockets line up.   Tonight I am going to watch Girl With  A Pearl Earring, and I'm really excited about it. I'm pumped for the two weeks I will have in August to run, read, watch movies, paint my toes, go to museums, ebay, ect. It has been three years since I've got to kick back like that. But I suppose last time was enough for a decade (months of unemployment). Now I'm going to see when those Celtics Rockets tickets are on sale.

      Well well, another Monday. I had a *hot weekend! When I got home Friday I saw crazy smoke rising from a few blocks away. LIke any concerned citizen, I took my camera phone and followed the smoke. It was nuts, a whole apartment building up in smoke, figherfighters everywhere, chopping away at the building, and many onlookers like myself staring in awe. It was totally amazing at the time, but no body else seemed much amazed, and I guess looking back at it it wasn't the most memorable part of my weekend. I had a good Sunday; managed to get a seat to see Farenheit 911 and see some really funny bush moments and then go to gay pride festivities. There were these sexy hip hop guys rapping this great music on the main stage. The lyrics though were like "i'm out i'm out, scream and shout" or "i'm gonna flirt i'm gonna flirt, until it hurts." Then the wave your hands in the air was actually a flamboyent flip of the wrist. Good stuff. Shakakan was about to perform but I said hey, I'm ready to be cozy at home, and I busted outta there.   I had some gimlets Friday night at Last Supper Club. Yummers. Viet and I checked out Zeitgeist and Living Room, two totally oppostite kinds of place, and I hope I make my way back to both. I need that beer garden. Mmm mmm. So whatchyall up to this weekend. I think I will have a small little bbq on july 5. I'm craving my own hamburgers. Thats it!

      So my revelations for this friday. I'll pipe down on the ebay after this, but let me just say, i suck at it. I charged people like $2 for shipping, then they buy something for like $3, but when I go to the post office it costs $5 to ship, not to mention the price of the envelope. So officially I have made $7 on everything I have sold so far. Oh wait, I just spent $11 at the post office, so I am down 4 bucks! After this intro period I"m sure things will pick up. I already went in and jacked up all the s & h costs.   My other revelation is something I've known for a long time, I will go nowhere in this job except maybe down. I mean now I am sorting through old files and listening to these long dumb messages to wait for the person who called number, but then I miss it the first couple times so I listen over and over to messages about tycos earnings and stuff like that. The reason is to call the person back and say please dont call us anymore. Today its feeling like both business ventures are asi asi to mal but at least I'm in the black, right.  Well maybe not in ebay.   But there is lots of good stuff in the world of Celeste. It's gonna be a fun SF weekend even though I don't know what I'm gonna do, hopefully I'll squeeze some movies in though, like Farenheit 911 and Notebook. Maybe they will offset each other as far as cheesieness goes. I think Viet and I are gonna give Slanted Door a shot tonight. I hope to see lots of gay men and women this weekend as well. Kelly just sent me some fish/ man porn, thanks Kell!

      Hey Bloggers. I made a song for Kelly yesterday:  Blog blog blog, blog blog baran. Went to a dance lookin for a man saw blog baran and I knew I had a chance. Blog blog baran. Blog Ba-raaan! Please take my ha-aaand. That is for you Kelly. I know it's not as awesome as you singing I Touch Myself to all of Jens coworkers, but I think it is pretty good.   My new song for myself is "ebay is addictive/ the best part is/ when the money flows in/ the worst part is/ packaging and sending and all the details / but i think / it is educating  me/ about having a business / with only $8 overhead for the envelopes I bought/ and it makes me think of things/ like how to ship blazers or cheesy craft kits / lalalalala"  I consider this my experience to help me thrive in my HBS class. I will be able to raise my hand during a case review and say "well on ebay i learned that shipping and handling are a pain in the butt and you need to charge more for that because I forgot to add the price of packaging." Life is one big classroom isnt it.  I tried Pho last night. Viet remember how it took me a couple sushi tries to really embrace it? I liked what I tasted so far and I know Pho will continue to grow on me. I like beef, I like soup, I like noodles, and I like you, so I know Pho will soon be on my list of things I am craving.    Tomorrow is Friday and Jeans day! Viet and I might try to get a seat at Slanted Door. Or at least sit at the bar and have some cocktails.   Tonight I'm just gonna take pictures of things to post for those suckas on ebay.

      Perhaps blogging in the morning will reveal my true blogging brilliance. I am brunette and in glasses today so watch out those who doubt! I missed my bus for the second time in two days. So I walked down to the next stop in hopes of getting a seat for the later bus, but to no avail. I was stuck next to this man I've talked to on the bus before but I felt like pretending I don't know him, so I was a total snobhead. I tried the standing while cramped and smothered and reading my San Francisco magazine, but that didn't last past Presidio Ave. Instead I remained subject to the only two morning chatterheads sitting below me and standing next to me and their not so engaging conversation about if it snows in China. The Indian woman apologized to the Chinese woman for having to ask if it snows in China. In fact, my friends, it did snow when the woman visited China. See the things I learn on my morning commute. Additionally, getting off the bus was a btch, everyone pushing and shoving to leave the sardine can. That is the blow by blow of a Celeste morning commute.  What happens next. Well it is totally okay, I realize after two and a half years of being here, for me to be as much as twenty minutes late because that is how late my boss and cubicle neighbor are daily. I was late but still in the office before them. I checked my morning email, blogs, bank account, and ebay...now two of my items have bids! This was inspirational enough for me to post three new books on ebay! Now that that is done, I turn to my blog for amusement, and as this concludes, I realize there are seven hours left before I can head out for the evening bus.

      Happy days of summer ya'll. I went to the North Beach Street fair this weekend, which was basically the Union St festival, but sitting down in a fenced in park.  Maybe I'll get to catch gay pride this coming weekend. Either that or party with my wild 55 year old uncle in LA. I finally have a bid on ebay. Tomorrow my first auction ends, so I'm expecting fierce bidding. I'm trying to keep my blogging everday streak going. Work totally sucked the creativity out of me today. Tomorrow, just wait.

      Friday afternoon, Part II. Friday afternoons at this job are so painfully slow and excruciating. The whole week is boring but that compounds on Fridays. Productivity is zip for everyone. At least we usually get out early, but man, every minute goes tick tock tick tock...  Jennifer is cookin up something yummy tonight, I think chicken and brandy are involved. Maybe the night will beckon us all out, especially after not getting out last weekend. North Beach fair tomorrow and a movie with that chick Celeste on Sunday (unless anyone is around on sunday?).  I am pausing to take a walk to get me through the afternoon but I will be back inspired, just wait.  OK Blog Peeps I am back. I told Viet on my walk "I feel alive!" So even though my walk did not give me blog motivation, it gave me life motivation.

      There have been a bunch of things lately that make me think "I should blog that." One of them I described in great detail to Jen and Jessi and Viet. I told them about the Poo-off. Do I need to explain? Well it happens in the ladies room of the office. It only happens when you are in a multi-stall restroom with other people you know. I think the rule is to defer to whoever has been sitting there longest and let them have thier privacy.  Some sucka in my office thinks the rule is whoever can sit there the longest and wait the other person out has poo rights. No respect for the who was there first rule.   The other story I should blog I think I will save for another day. About me getting this uhaul stuck on my apartment building and a cast of characters trying to "help." Yeah this is a good story, I will save it for later.   For now, time to go see the Giants and get a bratworst and beer.

      I'm venturing into the eBay world, but I'm not sure it is for me. I'm very enticed by the cash, even though nothing I'm posting should sell for more than a few dollars, but I kinda like all the things I have. I have books I've never read and will never read, but I like to have them there, maybe one day some one will want to borrow one or something. But then I think cash cash. It could add up...I'm still not sure though if I signed up for paypal right and if the money will ever get to me. I figured I'd jump right in, soon enough I will figure that out (6 days 2 hours 33 minutes actually). Yep, I'm pretty attached to all my dumb things. We'll see how I feel after my first big sell though (the only To the Lighthouse Audio book CD on ebay!).    So it totally sucks I am the chirpy smily receptionist today. Man never again.  Reception blows! I'm entertaining myself with the ebay world (thanks to brookeandevan), email, IM, little bit of news, and uh, thats it. I've been out of college for three years, haven't I passed the threshold of having to do reception crapola?? Just a moment. Just a moment. Hold please. Just a moment. I'm sorry he's not available, would you like his voicemail? Just a __ ___ moment!!

      85 in San Francisco today...a perfect gourmet fro yo day. There are two options for the ideal frozen yogurt: mini chocolate and mixed berry in a cup with oreo pieces, or chocolate and mixed berry in a cone, no topping. Don't get me wrong, there is only one reason for the mixed berry, which is the same reason I would ever eat vanilla. Because it makes me realized JUST HOW GOOD CHOCOLATE IS! If it was only a chocolate ice cream I might not realize how it dulls the competition. I saw Courtney Cox named her baby girl Coco. Oh I get it, it is narcissistic, like me naming my kid Cefo. Oh this is fun: Viets kid would be Ving. Kellys would be Kele, or better yet, Keho.  Adams would be Adfi. Jen's would be Jees.  Oh man this is so cool. Matt Damons would be Mada. Cynthia's would be Cyfl. But before I realized this I was thinking...I will name my kid Cocoa! But now I that I realize what this is really about I guess I will consider Cefo.

      Yoyo party people. It was a great summer weekend! Haight Street fair consisted of lots of beer, people, sunshine (I am now a tomato head), and one ear of roasted corn. Good times were had by all, including Kelly bo Belly, Angela fo Fangela, Jessi mo messy, and Viet so sweit.  (you have to say it all like it rhymes).  On Friday night I saw some mutant ninja shrimp (does that name still apply?) at Betelnut. These things could eat a lobster. It was scary, but the lamb redeemed it. I've been reading Life of Pi and the Introvert Adavantage. I think this Introvert book messes with my head, like it makes me think I should stay inside to recharge my batteries, but that just makes me home alone doin nothing. Either I'm not so introverted or its a trick to keep all introverted people indoors while the extroverted people go out and have fun with less traffic or crowds (because the introverts are home ya know). I'm glad I've recognized the brain washing for what it is. I guess I could still recommend this book but you just can't take it too seriously. Why am I reading this, well, it was recommended to me by a coworker, and I at first thought it was an insult, then maybe a compliment, but I don't know. It's all because of my blushing problem (which I think I'm over). Maybe I should write a bestselling extrovert book to trick all the extroverts to leaving the country so I will never again have to stand on the 1AX. But how many extroverts live in the Richmond anyway.  Back to the weekend...got to meet Viet's charming family on Saturday and wear my new dress. Ate lots of yummy sushi Sat night and I have this new fav roll...its eel and avacado on top with genuine nonmutant shrimp inside. mmmm mmm!

      Hello! So Reagan, who was 93, has died and half of America has the day off, including me and my man. Thank you Ronald! In tribute I think I will go see the Marin headlands and have lunch in Marin somewhere. Tomorrow I plan on further contributing to my studious look by getting new thick glasses in addition to the brown hair. Jen says I am smarter as a brunette and I am right a lot more often! So no more saying I don't know what I am talking about people. Those days are done. Especially with the Clark Kent glasses. Did I tell you guys that Texas IQ levels surpass any other state? And that my muscles are stronger than Viet's? And Mediteranean food is only from Italy? Trust Me! Plus I am a wicked Vietnamese cards (T.L.!!) player. Es Verdad! I have been very productive today; it must be the fancy fried chicken I had at the Purple Plum in oakland last night. Driving to the East Bay afterwork wasn't as bad as I imagined. I listened to my old Party mix, got to buy cheap east bay gas, and saw the city at dusk. Life is good!

      This weekend had the perfect mix of doing things and not doing things. Not doing things is a rare treat for me lately. I had a leisurly Sunday morning; woke up at 9 to a sunny day, walked down Geary to the ATM, went to the fruit market to load up on California summer fruits, grabbed a Sunday chronicle and read it at the yummy Royal Ground Cafe on Clement. When the paper bored me the people on Clement Street entertained. My hot chocolate was damn good. The rest of the day I spent napping/ watching movies (Love Actually is Actually Really good!) and went to Baker Beach with Melissa's crew. I like that San Francisco is a little decieving; the whole city was hot, but at Baker Beach, the cold wind blew sand at us and we hastily left the beach.   Saturday was one of those days I felt in love with San Francisco (sorry for all the sentimentality, a cynical post will follow). I had a nice little lunch with volunteers that made me very gung ho about volunteering.  Then Kell and I crashed the Union St fair. Where do these people come from?? They must have loaded on barges from Southern California. We enjoyed ourselves despite the beautiful yet annoying people all around us. I think this is why the Union St fair goes first, because it sucks the most, so it seems all great at the time, until the fun-ner street fairs begin (this sunday: haight street!!). Like I said though, I like that San Francisco is decieving, Union street was like the cold wind at baker beach. (follow?) But Man, the views we caught walking around Pac Heights of Marin and Alcatraz and downtown, I just couldn't get over how beautiful this town is!

      I've come to accept this won't be an overly creative blog, it will just be one short stop a day for other people stuck behind computers bored out of their bazookas. For my own entertainment I'll write what I have been doing, even though I have probably told all two readers already. So dinner. I tried making a paella dinner for Viet, and it turned out oh-kay...I'll have to really pay attention next time my mom cooks this stuff. Hers has so much flavor! Mine was more like, well, flavorless fish. I made mussels, clams, scallops, and shrimp. Well, God made them, and I cooked them.  Can you believe albertsons ran out of saffron rice. I mean, who else knows about it! It's the best deal ever (saffron is a very expensive spice!) at 99cents a pack. And you all know, I like a good deal. Sometimes I neglect deals though, like today, when I went crazy at Banana. I remember when my first job offer was in the 20s and this recruiter was trying to convince me to take it by saying I'll be fine, I just can't shop at banana republic every week. So its satisfying every time I go there. This weekend might have a lot of Mission in it; tonight tapas with Kelly, Andre, Viet, and then tomorrow Elbo Room with SFMOMA Tracey. Union Street fair tomorrow and a free lunch from project read. Sunday hopefully I'll get to see Megan's new rock. A packed weekend ahead, I will fill in the details monday. Have a good weekend!

      I'm lacking anything creative to say, so I will catch my one reader up on what I have been doing. (Does anyone besides Viet read this?) There's not much to say about my work day, if it was a song, it would go la dee da la la la la zzzzz la dee da ho hum.  My house has been very quiet lately because Jen is doing who knows what in Germany and Melissa has been falling in love in Argentina. And Kelly, who knows what that girl does.  So quiet house and empty fridge. I tutored Monica at project read last night, but I was being a lame tutor, I just sat there making little comments while she cruised through a computer game. I like when we play Wheel of Fortune, I need to own that game. I do have something to report! Viet and I went to Godzilla Sushi and I went godzilla crazy with the sushi. I ate some rolls, but amazed myself and viet and anyone who knows me by eating sashimi and anything else that was in front of me. Some pieces were just way too big, like the tuna and octopus, I thought they were eating me. But it was all a-ok. To hear about my trip to the O.C., I will refer you to V's blog. I am going to try to cook tonight, I'll let ya know how it turns out.

      I woke up this morning like wow, this is my last day at Harris Bretall. I actually felt pretty excited about it. Jen was leaving the house the same time as me, so I went to Peet's on California with her. We saw our friend Gaza who works there and I got a Assam Extra Fancy tea in a large cup, so I wouldn't spill. Jen took me to the last 1BX stop at Fillmore and California. I missed the bus by 10 seconds, so I just stood on the corner with my tea. My coworker Kari showed up just as late as me (it was already 8). We stood on the bus and made it in to work. As soon as I got to my desk I noticed the three&nbsp;big marks of tea on my yellow sweater. Nope those aren't coming out. I am such a mess. Wendy said to me that there were bagels in the kitchen for my last day. Rock on, that made me happy, so I went on in to get a poppy seed with light plain cream cheese. Ms Marketing Queen was in there, talking about the exclusive marketing party at her house last night and how wasted everyone was. Okay fine.&nbsp; Then she started telling another manager Bill about how everyone was telling Mike, the National Sales Manager, about interoffice dating that was going on. She rubbed it in my face, saying cmon Bill, look around. Okay fine. I'm leaving this job anyway. So I happily went to my desk with my tea and my stains and my bagel and I did a big thing, I paid my tuition for the semester. Cool dude. Then Felicia rang me, saying Harry was on the phone. Okay cool. He said sternly, Hello Celeste. I Was Thinking Last Night That I Need You To Make Four or Five More Investment Books For The Quarter. My voice dropped and I was like Okay. He gave me a Good Luck. So fine, that's how he is. Then Bill had me send a Fed Ex for him, because that is what I do around here, whatever crap other people don't want to do. Okay Fine.&nbsp; So, it's been fun, but I'm ready for a new adventure. Farewell HBSS!

      I'm scratching and clawing to finish out my last week of work. My biggest obstacles are the painful boringness I'm subject to each afternoon and my latest injury, a strained trapaziod. Yes just like the geometric shape. My muscle relaxer has relaxed my brain considerably. All I can think is nap nap nap and respond to people with an I dont know or oh okay or something along those lines. My cubicle neighbor won't drop this mouse/rat story (theres always a struggling dying one caught in a trap on her fence) and I just respond with an oh or a haha. I'm not sure if I'm always like this or if I just notice it today. But what would you say to that kind of story anyway.  This weekend Viet and I visited Hall winery. We thoroughly analyzed all the modern art on the property.&nbsp; If you ask me I'l give you the recap. The wine sipping was good too. We went and saw babelicious hcj at the greek theater. It rocked. I mean, jazzed. Thats all I got to say about that.

      Whenever I drive over the bay bridge towards the city I feel famous. I think about Dustin Hoffman in the Graduate driving over that bridge (going the wrong way if&nbsp; you watch closely).&nbsp; It's like the top of the empire state building to me, or alcatraz, or just one of those places that makes you feel like you're somewhere special. Driving back late last night the fog was so thick I couldn't see the lights above me&nbsp;on the bridge. It was weird, the bridge that went to nowhere, me just suspended in the cloud on a floating highway. I had to turn on my windshields because the fog was actually tangible.&nbsp; When I finally did reach the city, I got to drive through the city almost uninterested, and I had that weird famous feeling like I own this place.&nbsp;   My feeling going the other way on the bay bridge is totally different. Traffic was at a standstill yesterday, and it took an hour and a half from my house to Emeryville. It took almost 30 minutes to get from Battery and California to the bridge.&nbsp;Once I do get&nbsp;to the bridge&nbsp;my disaster thoughts kick in, I suppose because I'm&nbsp;on the lower level, and I think about the guy who died a few months ago when a section of the bay bridge collapsed on his car, or about earthquakes and the bridge after the top portion collapsed in '89. I try to drive fast on the lower level. Just get me safely to land with no hovering highway above me. But on the way back, I drive slow.

      Get it?! Get it?! I am blogging from the reception desk today. So lets calculate. Everyone has heard my whines about sitting up here and I'm sick of it myself. But lets just see how much time I have actually spent up here. Okay: 1,350 hours. Can that be right? 2 hours a day for 30 months? Okay lets compare that to my chocolate intake. In the same about of time: 4,500 chocolate units. (5 a day for 30 months)&nbsp;In any case. I am planning a little Napa excursion for Viet on Saturday. I can already feel the napa I am going to need after a day in Napa.&nbsp; And we are going to see Harry Conick Jr on Sunday night. Additionally, I am going to be a movie star tonight at Kelly's wrap party for Catwoman.   I just finished this book that I was really into,&nbsp;now I forgot the name, but it was another disappointing ending. It really hooked me with this love scene at first&nbsp; and all these chapters from different people perspectives. But can you believe these people never popped up again in the whole book, and every love scene then on involved a promiscuous gay 17 year old boy. My last book was Life of Pi, with no texas two step at all, so I guess this book was a little more intersante.&nbsp; I just need a new book that when I finish it I will be happy with the ending and glad for my whole experience of reading it.   Oh here is one of my talents. When I sit at the reception desk, I know every single persons walk at our office. I look placid, like I'm into my own thing, but my heightened sense tell me who you are by 1)your walk and 2) the reflection in the computer. So don't think I'm just sitting here doing jack. I am monitoring every one of you.

       Yo,  I havefailedastablogger    Can anyone read webdings font? I will let that sentance be a mystery except for those webdigns readers out there. People it is Friday! I'm bored at 9 am but I won't be discouraged. This has been a long week because I resigned! Total emotional toll. I was all headachey and worn out after it, even though it went pretty well. I almost started crying when I announced it to my boss, but he started clapping so my tears went away. My time here will have been February 13, 2002 to July 30, 2004. Those are some significant years of my life. When I started I was just a baby, but now I am a mature woman. HAHA I am trying to work on my image before I go. We all know Celeste is no mature woman. I'm not quite a lady, but not a chick. Perhaps a gal? I guess it depends what mood I am in, which ranges from psycho crazy woman to naive chill chick. So Gal is a good middle point. See this is why I haven't been blogging much. No brilliant insights to share. Today is a very good day at work because we get pizza for lunch. It makes up for all my boring moments all week. Well I won't be a blog hog. Later ya'll.

       I wish I wrote this essay on summers in Houston, but Susan Choi did.  I will blog further on summers though.      Why had it never occurred to me that summer was for the outdoors, for nature, until I was more than 20 years old? Maybe because it wasn't â€” not in Houston, where I grew up.  Houston is fantastically unnatural, and its summer is the season for embracing all that is contrived, ameliorative and just plain fake about Houstonian life.  Every domicile is its own organism, smoothly sealed, afloat in a hostile miasma. In Houston, we air-condition all 12 months of the year, but it's in summer that our air-conditioning achieves the stature of art, that it can feel like a gleaming Brancusi or a well-mixed martini. It seems incongruous, but Houston does actually have vast public parks full of plush grass and trees. Why?, I wondered when young. What did one do in such places? Sitting outdoors on a blanket, or risking heatstroke by trying to jog, struck me as a sign of insecurity, the same strivings that led Houstonians to tell visitors how "culturally vibrant" and "global" the city was. These were people who didn't want to admit that Houston is an unreasonable city, a "port" city without a harbor, a "space" city 900 miles from Cape Canaveral's launching pad. These were people who didn't relish the fact that Houston doesn't make sense.   And so what did we do in the summer, when Houston's senselessness reached its apex? True citizens of our city, my friends and I were drawn to its artificial â€” by which I mean its most genuine â€” places. We loved the park at the base of the Transco Tower, with its manmade ponds garishly lighted from within. All of us fell in love, or consummated love, or ended love there, in that fairyland of concrete and electricity that, I realize now, was a rapturously useless elaboration of our city's two most fundamental constituents. We loved the art cinema which after the last show became our own private clubhouse, a dusky balconied cube of cold air. We loved the 24-hour Kroger grocery store and the 24-hour House of Pies. We loved controlled atmospheres of all kinds, because these were the essence of home.  In 1984, the Talking Heads concert film "Stop Making Sense" came to spend the summer at our art cinema and we loved it, too, and made it our Dionysian summer ritual. "Stop making sense:" yes, exactly, we thought â€” we, the children of a city begotten by unscrupulous real-estate speculators on an infernal swamp, the children of a city in which the buildings downtown are connected by air-conditioned tunnels so that no one need venture outdoors. We attended every midnight screening of the movie and then, since we knew him, made the projectionist show it again after the public had left so we could dance ourselves into exhaustion in the carpeted aisles. But I remember one night becoming almost febrile with excitement, and suddenly needing to be alone. I was heading away to college that fall, and I was already overwhelmed by the bewildered homesickness I would suffer my first year away, along with its more brutal flip side: stark disillusionment about the place I'd come from. Perhaps I already sensed that I would never live in my hometown again, or at least, would never want to. In another city, I might have coped with this crisis by going outdoors and gazing at the stars, but in Houston, that wasn't an option. What outdoors? What stars? Our sky was always a strange shade of salmon, light pollution bouncing off air pollution. Instead I crept through an employees-only door that led to the cavern behind the huge screen, and I lay on the dusty floor watching the movie from behind, letting the beams of light that made up David Byrne and his oversized suit stab and shift and pass over me. I remember that moment as one of awful, paradoxically self-annihilating self-consciousness. I also remember it as the end of my summers at home, although there would be more of them; but they would be visits from another world â€” one where lying outdoors and gazing at stars wouldn't seem like a joke.   For me coming into adulthood was a process of realizing that there is a unviverse that the world of my childhood in Houston had erased. You could call it the stars beyond the smog, or, less romantically, the heat beyond the air-conditioner.  I moved to New York after I finished college, and my first home in the city was a closetless 8-by-10 foot room that got so hot I could have baked bread. And yet one day, sweating it out in that room, I looked out the eighth-story south-facing window and saw an egret gliding east with slow wingbeats along 110th Street, as if there was a subway at that height just for birds. Was I fooling myself to think that New York, as exuberantly artificial as it is in its own way, somehow feels more real than Houston?   The other evening, more than nine years after that first New York moment, I sat in a splendid 19th-century church in Brooklyn and listened to David Byrne singing. There he was, the looming idol of my adolescence, a human-size man in blue jeans with a brush of gray hair, peering at his set list through wire-rimmed glasses, and performing without electric guitars. My life had more than doubled in length since that last Houston summer, when the future seemed to yawn like an empty abyss, while at the same time the present was closing its doors. And yet here I was in an ornate old church that was not air-conditioned, and the night was uncomfortably hot, and I was nine months pregnant â€” and in tears, I was so wildly happy. Not because life was finally "real" where before it had been "fake." I was in tears because a cherished long-ago summer had unexpectedly meshed with this summer, and produced something new: a broader sense of beauty, perhaps, or perhaps just a span of years brought into focus, in a way that provoked no regret.

      Tonight I'm having my first Korean BBQ experience with Cynthia and Viet. Ever since Viet explained all the food...man...I'm salivating. I'm on an eating out streak. Angelinas turkey sandwich yesterday, A16 crazy polenta and sausage lunch on Sat, Ethiopian yummy treats Sat night, KFC friday night. Food is just so exciting! In addition to all my eating, I bowled like a 95? on Friday. I stinkaroo at bowling, and my forearm is still tired. I saw some live Jazz as Rassala's Sat with Viet. We were jammin in the front room since we couldn't get into the rocking retirement party in the really sweet looking back room. Oh well, someday. Sunday Kelly came over from lunch til dinner, good times, right Kell! Jen made -- drumroll please-- bbqed drumsticks. Aside from Food, Movies have been big on my list lately. Okay the recent viewings:  Pieces of April- B+, Cold Mountain- B, Big Fish- B-, Notebook- B+, Farenheit 9/11- B, Monster- A-. See I am a very tough grader! I have unlimited movies for the next month so watch out for my critic reviews.  Maybe I can figure out a career in movies and food. Or maybe its best just to keep those in the fun catagory.

      I totally finshed all my work-work and all my bosses are gone, so I think it's time to go home! Okay its only 11:47. But if I were in charege... Tonight I have to rush to the bowling alley for the 7:00 start time, so I don't waste one cent of the $75 this lane costs (it is coated in gold and sapphires I presume). More exciting news about today: I get to redeem my Metro Crepes card. Yup, I filled up all 10 squares with M stamps, and its time to cash in. I'm thinking a large chicken ceaser salad, which retails at $7. And a Dr. Pepper. Time to head to "Body Conditioning".

      Here comes the blog, da da da da, here comes the blog. More like here comes the fog. There has been no sun shining in San Francisco for days!! Weeks!! When will it start to feel like summer. Will I miss summer? That would be such a drag. I want to feel the sun on my skin! Tank tops, flip flops! Summer, what a misnomer for San Francisco July, Winter is more like it. I'm sure the hot days will come. Anyway. So I've been getting ready for the great migration East. Trying to get my car settled with a auto transporter. So many details about everything, like I need to be applying to internships and get my parking permit and lots of little things. Maybe I should start following the Red Sox, but I'm not sure if I'll go that far yet.  Did I mention the fireworks in San Francisco were hidden in the fog. Viet and I sat on this cold bench watching the fog and the people around us, all pretending there are fireworks going on. Its like in the limey, you could see the sea if you could see it. You could see the fireworks if you could see them. That was my Fourth, along with the fillmore jazzfest and a nice long afternoon nap. The whole weekend was fun, at Royal Oak Friday night and Cloud Nine on Saturday. Oh Check it out. Tonight there is a little Wesleyan gathering on 30th Ave. I am RSVPed and ready to go! Go Wes!

      Partytime, excellent, at minna last night. So much fun but so tiring the next day. I'll just have a big yummy lunch to energize me through the afternoon. That'll be the homestretch, cuz tomorrow is half a day laced with chocolate cake and weekend talk, then its the three day weekend. So what is going on on the Fourth!! Looks like it will be a fun spontaneous kinda day. Just as long as I see fireworks. I'll be missing the parade in Maine for like the first time ever, but I don't mind! It's not the same without Kelly riding a decorated bike in a clown outfit. I mean, the Wiscasset parade considers John Deere tractors a major part of the parade, in addition to the small town middle school bands, new kids in clown suits, a wood chopper, the Ford guy in his old Fords, and of course every fire truck in four counties. Okay maybe I will miss it, but just a little, and just because I always get so much candy (I'm bigger than my opponents fighting for tootsie rolls). Plus it goes by our house and there are lots of left over starbursts and things if you look hard enough in the grass and bushes. Nighttime is where it really gets crazy, the dance down at the docks. All the kids in town are down there and a little out of control, thinking they are so cool, and this is the biggest night of the year. Some local band plays oldies. The bugs are always out, but that doesn't matter, because the fireworks way outdo what small town fireworks should be. Well, Happy July Fourth ya'll.

      This is so much better, blogging from my own desk and the comforts of my own home instead of out of desperation for something to do at work. I can't believe how fast time goes by even when I have nothing really to do! Doing the little things I want to takes up whole days, and almost a whole week. Movies are the big way I'm spending my time. I drove to San Mateo for lunch with Jen and I felt like, hmm,like a lady who goes and has lunches with her friends. It was pretty neato. We had a fancy lunch too. Last night Viet and I had some fantastic Kitaro sushi. Tonight, Slanted Door! Tomorrow is the big party and I'm expecting to see all ya'll there. I'm thinking Bambudda lounge. So get your party clothes on and cmon out! If I'm good and get all my errands done this morning, I'm gonna go to a movie later. This is the big time, not just blockbuster, but a real theater! Well I just wanted to bring my blog back to life, but you'll be hearing from me soon! Adios
