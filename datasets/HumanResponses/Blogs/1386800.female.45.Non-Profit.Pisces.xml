      I told my doctor I get very tired when I go on a diet, so he gave me pep pills. Know what happened? I ate faster. - Joe E. Lewis  I’ve been on a constant diet for the last two decades. I’ve lost a total of 789 pounds. By all accounts, I should be hanging from a charm bracelet. - Erma Bombeck  I feel about airplanes the way I feel about diets. It seems to me that they are wonderful things for other people to go on. - Jean Kerr  I’m not into working out. My philosophy: No pain, no pain. - Carol Leifer  My doctor told me to stop having intimate dinners for four. Unless there are three other people. - Orson Welles  I like long walks, especially when they are taken by people who annoy me. - Noel Coward  Whenever I feel like exercise I lie down until the feeling passes. - Robert Maynard Hutchins  The trouble with jogging is that the ice falls out of your glass. - Martin Mull  My advice if you insist on slimming: East as much as you like - just don’t swallow it. - Harry Secombe  I am not a glutton - I am an explorer of food. - Erma Bombeck  I exercise every morning without fail. One eyelid goes up and the other follows. - Pete Postlethwaite   The odds of going to the store for a loaf of bread and coming out with ONLY a loaf of bread are three billion to one. - Erma Bombeck   Be careful about reading health books. You may die of a misprint. – Mark Twain   Grandma started walking for her health when she was 60. She's now 97 and we don't know where the heck she is!

      A few weeks ago I had started a new exercise routine...actually...I just added walking everyday to my existing one.  I am eager to see results but they are slow in appearing.  I just have to stick with it and keep the following tip in mind.   Everyone who starts a fitness program is eager to see results  – on the scale, in a favorite outfit, in the mirror. But keep a lookout for benefits that may not be immediately visible. By sticking with an exercise plan, you’ll not only look better; you’ll FEEL better in several ways:  - More energy - More self-confidence - Less stress - Better sleep  And the best part of this all: These less visible benefits ultimately do make you look better too.

      Although the number of single-parent families has increased in recent years, many  inaccurate beliefs persist.  This posting is meant to dispel some of the myths and help you cope with some of the realities.   Some of the myths include:    MYTH:  Children who grow-up in a single-parent household are more likely to struggle in school, get into trouble with the law and develop serious social problems.   FACT:  Single parents have raised many well-rounded, successful people. Many negative predictions for children raised by a single parent have more to do with economic hardship than the lack of one parent. With hard work, love, positive discipline and good parenting skills, single parents can raise capable, content, successful children.   MYTH:  Children from single parent homes will never have healthy relationships themselves.   FACT:  Children of divorced parents seem to put more energy into maintaining their relationships. A recent study of more than 6,000 adults found that 43 percent of adult children of divorced parents are happily married—about the same percentage as those who grew up in two-parent homes.   MYTH:  Children of single parents need role models. The sooner the parent remarries the better.   FACT:  Children benefit from the presence of both men and women in their family life provided those men and women are emotionally healthy. Children actually suffer more harms by living with conflict and unhealthy role models than by having one healthy, effective parent. A single parent with good parenting skills can raise children successfully without a partner by building a good support system—a circle of friends, relatives and neighbors.   MYTH:  Children of single parents have lower self-esteem.   FACT:  Children of single parents are no more likely to suffer from low self-esteem than their peers from a two-parent home. Studies indicate that income level can be a deciding factor relating to a child's self-esteem. Parents need to emphasize to their children that who they are is not based on what they have. A strong sense of self-esteem helps children resist negative peer pressure and gives them the confidence to face challenges and try new things.   MYTH:  Single-parent homes are "broken" homes.   FACT:  Most parents who divorce or decide not to marry do so because they want to create a stable home for their family. If there is a great deal of conflict in a marriage or relationship, a change to a single-parent family can result in a reduction in tension, hostility and discord and an increase in family solidarity and consistency. It is the children of parents who remain together despite constant conflict who often encounter problems. When anxiety is high between parents, children's emotional needs are often ignored, rules are not consistently enforced and children feel less secure. When the tension is alleviated, however, single parents can focus on their children's needs. Effective parenting skills and healthy relationships are what make a family whole.

       The Lighter Side of Birth Order (Continued)    Diaper disposals   First child: You buy a Diaper Genie or other specialized container and use it religiously to dispose of all of your baby's diapers.   Second child: You still have a Diaper Genie, and if you happen to change your baby in its vicinity, you use it.   Third child: You ran out of replacement bags for your Diaper Genie last time around, and instead you keep a lot of old plastic shopping bags on hand to cut down the smell of the diapers in the household garbage cans.    Monogrammed baby clothes   First child: Your friends throw you a big party after the baby is born and you get the cutest little monogrammed baby outfit.   Second child: You decide to spring for a similar monogrammed baby outfit for your second child so that she can have a baby picture that matches your firstborn's.   Third child: Your baby is still decked out in a monogrammed outfit--it's just pink and bears his sibling's initials.    Onesies   First child: You look in a book to find out what a "onesie" is and then make sure to buy one for each day of the week   Second child: You go through your old onesies and sort out the ones in the wrong color or that are too stained. You also make sure to buy enough to have a week's worth of onesies (which you now realize is closer to three per day!)   Third child: You figure that color and spit-up stains don't show through an outer layer of clothing, and if one of the three snaps is functional, hey, it's acceptable.    Stocking up on baby clothes   First child: Full price.   Second child: You still spring for full price for special occasions, but you basically outfit your child off the sale racks.   Third child: Hand-me-downs and garage sales. Can't beat 25 cents a shirt, now, can you?    Dealing with tantrums   First child: You question what you've done wrong, get out the parenting books, and ponder how to best handle the situation so you don't damage your child's fragile ego.   Second child: You yell at your child when she throws a tantrum, but give in because you don't want her shrieks to wake your other child.   Third child: Your calm response to your child's tantrum is to ask "OK, so whom do you want to go live with?"    Baby books   First child: You record every coo and hiccup, and the pages are so full of memorabilia that the book won't shut.   Second child: You keep your baby book in a big storage box along with all of the important notes, scraps, and photos in hopes of one day finding time to record all the memorable moments.   Third child: Memorabilia gets hung on the refrigerator with a magnet and the baby book is still in its original wrapper, which proves to be very fortunate when you are invited to a friend's baby shower and find yourself at the last minute without a gift.    Feeding supplies   First child: Tiffany silver spoon and Royal Doulton Bunnykins cup and bowl.   Second child: Matched sets of plastic, compartmentalized kid plates and utensils with cute designs.   Third child: A motley assortment of free souvenir plates and cups collected from countless meals at family restaurants.

       Home Exercise Machines and Child Safety   More than 25,000 children are injured each year by contact with home exercise equipment.  Hand injuries are among the most common, occurring in situations like these:  - An adult is on a treadmill and the child, unnoticed, comes up from behind and injures a hand on the machine’s moving belt. - The child plays with the pedals and wheels of an unattended stationary bike. - The child catches his or her hand in the pulleys of a strength-training machine.  Here are some ways to protect children from accidents around exercise machines:  - Choose motorized equipment that has a safety key or switch. - Keep exercise equipment in a locked room. - Don’t wear headphones while working out. - Explain to children that the machines are potentially dangerous and are for adults only.

      In winter, it’s snow shoveling. In spring, it’s gardening. And in autumn, the task that leaves many a home-maintenance enthusiast sore and regretful on Monday mornings is – yes – raking leaves.  Don’t underestimate the exertion that raking can require. It’s a repetitive movement that can lead to muscle strain if you don’t work those muscles regularly. Some advice:  - Warm up and stretch before starting. As with any exercise, you should warm up your muscles with light activity, such as walking, and then perform gentle stretches. And remember that raking is a full-body experience; be sure to stretch not only your shoulders and arms, but also your neck, upper and lower back, thighs, and calves.  - Take regular breaks – every twenty minutes or so.  - Stay hydrated. Drink plenty of water before, during and after.  - If it hurts, stop. Rest and wait a few days before attempting again.

      By the time the Lord made woman, he was into his sixth day of working overtime. An angel appeared and said, "Why are you spending so much time on this one?"   And the Lord answered, "Have you seen the spec sheet on her? She has to be completely washable, but not plastic, have over 200 movable parts, all replaceable, run on diet coke and leftovers, have a lap that can hold four children at one time, have a kiss that can cure anything from a scraped knee to a broken heart and have two pairs of hands."  The angel was astounded at the requirements. "Two pairs of hands!  No way!  And that's just on the standard model? That's too much work for one day.  Wait until tomorrow to finish."   But I can't," the Lord protested. "I am so close to finishing this creation that is so close to my own heart. She already heals herself when she is sick AND can work 18 hour days."   The angel moved closer and touched the woman. "But you have made her so soft, Lord."   "She is soft," the Lord agreed, "but I have also made her tough. You have no idea what she can endure or accomplish."   "Will she be able to think?", asked the angel.   The Lord replied, "Not only will she be able to think, she will be able to reason and negotiate."   The angel then noticed something, and reaching out, touched the woman's cheek. "Oops, it looks like you have a leak in this model. I told you that you were trying to put too much into this one."   "That's not a leak," the Lord corrected, "that's a tear!"   "What's the tear for?" the angel asked.   The Lord said, "The tear is her way of expressing her joy, her sorrow, her pain, her disappointment, her love, her loneliness, her grief and her pride."   The angel was impressed. "You are a genius, Lord. You thought of everything! Woman is truly amazing."   And she is! Women have strengths that amaze men. They bear hardships and they carry burdens, but they hold happiness, love and joy. They smile when they want to scream. They sing when they want to cry. They cry when they are happy and laugh when they are nervous. They fight for what they believe in. They stand up to injustice. They don't take "no" for an answer when they believe there is a better solution. They go without so their family can have. They go to the doctor with a frightened friend.  They love unconditionally. They cry when their children excel and cheer when their friends get awards. They are happy when they hear about a birth or a wedding. Their hearts break when a friend dies. They grieve at the loss of a family member, yet they are strong when they think there is no strength left. They know that a hug and a kiss can help to heal a broken heart. Women come in all sizes, in all colors and shapes. They'll drive, fly, walk, run or e-mail you to show how much they care about you. The heart of a woman is what makes the world keep turning! They bring joy and hope. They have compassion and ideals. They give moral support to their family and friends. Women have vital things to say and everything to give.   Pass this along to your women friends to remind them how amazing they are; because if there's one flaw in women, it is that they tend to forget about themselves.

      People always come into your life for a reason, a season and a lifetime. When you figure out which it is, you know exactly what to do.  When someone is in your life for a REASON, it is usually to meet a need you have expressed outwardly or inwardly. They have come to assist you through a difficulty, or to provide you with guidance and support, to aid you physically, emotionally, or even spiritually. They may seem like a godsend to you, and they are. They are there for a reason,you need them to be. Then, without any wrong doing on your part or at an inconvenient time, this person will say or do something to bring the relationship to an end. Sometimes they die, Sometimes they just walk away. Sometimes they act up or out and force you to take a stand. What we must realize is that our need has been met, our desire fulfilleed; their work is done. The prayer you sent up has been answered and it is now time to move on.  When people come into your life for a SEASON, it is because your turn has come to share, grow, or learn. They may bring you an experience of peace or make you laugh. They may teach you something you have never done. They usually give you an unbelievable amount of joy. Believe it! It is real! But, only for a season. And like Spring turns to Summer and Summer to Fall, the season eventually ends.  LIFETIME, relationships teach you a lifetime of lessons; those things you must build upon in order to have a solid emotional foundation. Your job is to accept the lesson, love the person/people (anyway);, and put what you have learned to use in all other relationships and areas in your life. It is said that love is blind but friendship is clairvoyant. Thank you for being part of my life.....   Written by Brian A. "Drew" Chalker

       Where Were You Lyrics   Alan Jackson    Where were you when the world stopped turning that September day Out in the yard with your wife and children Working on some stage in LA Did you stand there in shock at the site of That black smoke rising against that blue sky Did you shout out in anger In fear for your neighbor Or did you just sit down and cry  Did you weep for the children Who lost their dear loved ones And pray for the ones who don't know Did you rejoice for the people who walked from the rubble And sob for the ones left below  Did you burst out in pride For the red white and blue The heroes who died just doing what they do Did you look up to heaven for some kind of answer And look at yourself to what really matters  I'm just a singer of simple songs I'm not a real political man I watch CNN but I'm not sure I can tell you The difference in Iraq and Iran But I know Jesus and I talk to God And I remember this from when I was young Faith hope and love are some good things he gave us And the greatest is love  Where were you when the world stopped turning that September day Teaching a class full of innocent children Driving down some cold interstate Did you feel guilty cause you're a survivor In a crowded room did you feel alone Did you call up your mother and tell her you love her Did you dust off that bible at home Did you open your eyes and hope it never happened Close your eyes and not go to sleep Did you notice the sunset the first time in ages Speak with some stranger on the street Did you lay down at night and think of tomorrow Go out and buy you a gun Did you turn off that violent old movie you're watching And turn on "I Love Lucy" reruns Did you go to a church and hold hands with some stranger Stand in line and give your own blood Did you just stay home and cling tight to your family Thank God you had somebody to love  I'm just a singer of simple songs I'm not a real political man I watch CNN but I'm not sure I can tell you The difference in Iraq and Iran But I know Jesus and I talk to God And I remember this from when I was young Faith hope and love are some good things he gave us And the greatest is love  I'm just a singer of simple songs I'm not a real political man I watch CNN but I'm not sure I can tell you The difference in Iraq and Iran But I know Jesus and I talk to God And I remember this from when I was young Faith hope and love are some good things he gave us And the greatest is love  The greatest is love The greatest is love  Where were you when the world stopped turning that September day

       Safety Tips for Homeowners:   1. Replace burned-out bulbs in exterior lights. Leave your exterior lights on later than usual -- perhaps even all night.  2. Clear the pathway. Make sure the path to your door is well lighted and your lawn is clear of things that could be tripped over, such as jack-o'-lanterns with lit candles, ladders, garden hoses, flowerpots, bikes, and animal leashes.  3. Sweep wet leaves from sidewalks and stairs.  4. Keep excitable pets away from the door. You'll have a safer and calmer house if you keep Fido away from where you are dispensing the treats.  5. Put your car in the garage. Lock your garage doors.   Alternative Treats: Instead of candy, offer these treats:   Halloween stickers Halloween pencils Halloween erasers Sugar-free gum Plastic spider rings Small toys Temporary tattoos Miniature boxes of raisins Coins -- how about a new state quarter? Individual packages of cheese or peanut-butter crackers or pretzels Boxes of fruit juice Gel pens Fast-food coupons Key chains Foot bags or squeeze-foam balls

       RULES OF LIFE    Sometimes we need to remember WHAT the Rules of Life really are.   1.  Never give yourself a haircut after three alcoholic beverages of any kind.   2.  You need only two tools: WD-40 and duct tape.  If it doesn't move and it should, use the WD-40.  If it moves and it shouldn't, use the duct tape.   3.  The five most essential words for a healthy, vital relationship are "I apologize" and "You are right."   4.  Everyone seems normal until you get to know them.   5.  When you make a mistake, make amends immediately.  It's easier to eat crow while it's still warm.   6.  The only really good advice that your mother ever gave you was: "Go!  You might meet somebody!"   7.  If he/she says that you are too good for him/her - believe them.   8.  Learn to pick your battles.  Ask yourself, "Will this matter one year from now?  How about one month?  One week?  One day?"  9.  Never pass up an opportunity to pee.   10.  If you woke up breathing, congratulations!  You have another chance!   11.  Living well really is the best revenge.  Being miserable because of a bad or former relationship just might mean that the other person was right about you.   12.  Work is good, but it's not that important.   13.  And finally; Be really nice to your friends and family. You never know when you are going to need them to empty your bedpan.

      This came to me via e-mail shortly after September 11.  I think we could change the word Afghanistan to Iraq.  What do you think?   Take all American women who are within five years of menopause - train us for a few weeks, outfit us with automatic weapons, grenades, gas masks, moisturizer with SPF15, Prozac, hormones, chocolate, and canned tuna - drop us (parachuted, preferably) across the landscape of Afghanistan, and let us do what comes naturally.  Think about it. Our anger quotient alone, even when doing standard stuff like grocery shopping and paying bills, is formidable enough to make even armed men in turbans tremble.  We've had our children, we would gladly suffer or die to protect them and their future. We'd like to get away from our husbands, if they haven't left already. And for those of us who are single, the prospect of finding a good man with whom to share life is about as likely as being struck by lightning. We have nothing to lose.  We've survived the water diet, the protein diet, the carbohydrate diet, and the grapefruit diet in gyms and saunas across America and never lost a pound. We can easily survive months in the hostile terrain of Afghanistan with no food at all!  We've spent years tracking down our husbands or lovers in bars, hardware stores, or sporting events...finding bin Laden in some cave will be no problem.  Uniting all the warring tribes of Afghanistan in a new government? Oh, please ... we've planned the seating arrangements for in-laws and extended families at Thanksgiving dinners for years ... we understand tribal warfare.  Between us, we've divorced enough husbands to know every trick there is for how they hide, launder, or cover up bank accounts and money sources. We know how to find that money and we know how to seize it ... with or without the government's help!  Let us go and fight. The Taliban hates women.  Imagine their terror as we crawl like ants with hot-flashes over their godforsaken terrain.  I'm going to write my Congresswoman. You should, too!

       What Hallmark doesn't print:   1. So your daughter's a hooker, and it spoiled your day. Look at the bright side, it's really good pay.  2. My tire was thumping. I thought it was flat. When I looked at the tire... I noticed your cat. Sorry!  3. Heard your wife left you, How upset you must be. But don't fret about it... She moved in with me.  4. Looking back over the years that we've been together, I can't help but wonder. What the hell was I thinking?  5. Congratulations on your wedding day! Too bad no one likes your husband.  6.

       Girlfriends...   I sat on the porch overlooking a beautiful mountain lake on a summer day, enjoying a glass of wine with my Mom. Older than me, mother of four, experienced and wise.  "Get yourself some girlfriends," she advised, swirling the wine in her glass. "You are going to need girlfriends. Go places with them, do things with them."  What a funny piece of advice, I thought. Hadn't I just gotten married? Hadn't I just joined the couple-world? I was a married woman, for goodness sake, not a young girl who needed girlfriends.  Nevertheless, I listened to my Mom and I got back in touch with my old girlfriends of years long gone.  As the years tumbled by, one after another, gradually I came to understand that Mom knew what she was talking about. Here is what I know about them:  Girlfriends bring casseroles and scrub your bathroom when you are sick. Girlfriends! keep your children and keep your secrets. Girlfriends give advice when you ask for it. Sometimes you take it, sometimes you don't.  Girlfriends don't always tell you that you're right, but they're usually honest. Girlfriends still love you, even when they don't agree with your choices.  Girlfriends might send you a birthday card, but they might not. It does not matter in the least.  Girlfriends laugh with you, and you don't need canned jokes to start the laughter.  Girlfriends pull you out of jams.  Girlfriends don! 't keep a calendar that lets them know who hosted the other last  Girlfriends will give a party for your son or daughter when they get married or have a baby in whichever order that comes!  Moreover, girlfriends are there for you, in an instant and truly, when the hard times come.  Girlfriends listen when you lose a job or a husband. Girlfriends listen when your children break your heart. Girlfriends listen when your parent's minds and bodies fail.  My girlfriends bless my life.  Once we were young, with no idea of the incredible joys or the incredible sorrows that lay ahead.  Nor did we know how much we would need each other.  Share this with your girlfriends (that includes sisters) and even to women you are not quite friends with. You never know, someday they may end up being a dear old friend. Let them know how much you appreciate them.  I'm sharing this with you because I appreciate you more than I could ever express.   "There are many things in life that will catch your eye, but only a few will catch your heart . . . pursue those."  ~ Author Unknown

       EXCERPTS FROM A CAT'S GUIDE TO HUMAN BEINGS   1. Introduction: Why Do We Need Humans?  So you've decided to get yourself a human being. In doing so, you've joined the millions of other cats who have acquired these strange and often frustrating creatures. There will be any number of times, during the course of your association with humans, when you will wonder why you have bothered to grace them with your presence.  What's so great about humans, anyway? Why not just hang around with other cats? Our greatest philosophers have struggled with this question for centuries, but the answer is actually rather simple:   THEY HAVE OPPOSABLE THUMBS.  Which makes them the perfect tools for such tasks as opening doors, getting the lids off of cat food cans, changing television stations and other activities that we, despite our other obvious advantages, find difficult to do ourselves. True, chimps, orangutans and lemurs also have opposable thumbs, but they are nowhere as easy to train.  2. How And When to Get Your Human's Attention  Humans often erroneously assume that there are other, more important activities than taking care of your immediate needs, such as conducting business, spending time with their families or even sleeping.  Though this is dreadfully inconvenient, you can make this work to your advantage by pestering your human at the moment it is the busiest. It is usually so flustered that it will do whatever you want it to do, just to get you out of its hair. Not coincidentally, human teenagers follow this same practice.  Here are some tried and true methods of getting your human to do what you want:  Sitting on paper: An oldie but a goodie. If a human has paper in front of it, chances are good it's something they assume is more important than you. They will often offer you a snack to lure you away. Establish your supremacy over this wood pulp product at every opportunity. This practice also works well with computer keyboards, remote controls, car keys and small children.  Waking your human at odd hours: A cat's golden time is between 3:30 and 4:30 in the morning. If you paw at your human's sleeping face during this time, you have a better than even chance that it will get up and, in an incoherent haze, do exactly what you want. You may actually have to scratch deep sleepers to get their attention remember to vary the scratch site to keep the human from getting suspicious.  3. Punishing Your Human Being  Sometimes, despite your best training efforts, your human will stubbornly resist bending to your whim. In these extreme circumstances, you may have to punish your human. Obvious punishments, such as scratching furniture or eating household plants, are likely to backfire--the unsophisticated humans are likely to misinterpret the activities and then try to discipline YOU. Instead, we offer these subtle but nonetheless effective alternatives:  Use the cat box during an important formal dinner. Stare impassively at your human while it is attempting a romantic interlude. Stand over an important piece of electronic equipment and feign a hairball attack. After your human has watched a particularly disturbing horror film, stand by the hall closet and then slowly back away, hissing and yowling. While your human is sleeping, lie on its face.  4. Rewarding Your Human: Should Your Gift Still Be Alive?  The cat world is divided over the etiquette of presenting humans with the thoughtful gift of a recently disemboweled animal. Some believe that humans prefer these gifts already dead, while others maintain that humans enjoy a slowly expiring cricket or rodent just as much as we do, given their jumpy and playful movements in picking the creatures up after they've been presented.  After much consideration of the human psyche, we recommend that cold-blooded animals (large insects, frogs, lizards, garden snakes and the occasional earthworm) should be presented dead, while warm-blooded animals (birds, rodents, your neighbor's Pomeranian) are better still living. When you see the expression on your human's face, you'll know it's worth it.   5. How Long Should You Keep Your Human?  You are only obligated to your human for one of your lives. The other eight are up to you. We recommend mixing and matching, though in the end, most humans (at least the ones that are worth living with) are pretty much the same. But what do you expect? They're humans, after all. Opposable thumbs will only take you so far.

       Remember when...   Some parents NEVER owned their own house, wore Levis, set foot on a golf course, traveled out of the country or had a credit card. In their later years they had something called a revolving charge card. The card was good only at Sears Roebuck. Or maybe it was Sears AND Roebuck. Either way, there is no Roebuck anymore. Maybe he died.  My parents never drove me to soccer practice. This was mostly because we never had heard of soccer. I had a bicycle that weighed probably 50 pounds, and only had one speed, (slow). We didn't have a television in our house until I was 11, but my grandparents had one before that. It was, of course, black and white, but they bought a piece of colored plastic to cover the screen. The top third was blue, like the sky, and the bottom third was green, like grass. The middle third was red. It was perfect for programs that had scenes of fire trucks riding across someone's lawn on a sunny day. Some people had a lens taped to the front of the TV to make the picture look larger.  I was 13 before I tasted my first pizza; it was called "pizza pie."  When I bit into it, I burned the roof of my mouth and the cheese slid off, swung down, plastered itself against my chin and burned that, too. It's still the best pizza I ever had.  We didn't have a car until I was 15. Before that, the only car in our family was my grandfather's Ford. He called it a "machine."  I never had a telephone in my room. The only phone in the house was in the living room and it was on a party line. Before you could dial, you had to listen and make sure some people you didn't know weren't already using the line.  Pizzas were not delivered to our home. But milk was. All newspapers were delivered by boys, and all boys delivered newspapers. I delivered newspaper, six days a week. It cost 7 cents a paper, of which I got to keep 2 cents. I had to get up at 4 AM every morning. On Saturday, had to collect the 42 cents from my customers. My favorite customers were the ones who gave me 50 cents and told me to keep the change. My least favorite customers were the ones who seemed to never be home on collection day.  Movie stars kissed with their mouths shut. At least, they did in the movies. Touching someone else's tongue with yours was called French kissing and they didn't do that in movies. I don't know what they did in French movies.  French movies were dirty and we weren't allowed to see them.  If you grew up in a generation before there was fast food, you may want to share some of these memories with your children or grandchildren. Just don't blame me if they hurt themselves laughing. Growing up isn't what it used to be, is it?

       SETTING STANDARDS   Time, warmth, intimacy and love are all fundamental to our children’s happiness and well-being. So are standards. Letting your children know the standards that are most important to you, and expecting them to be honored is a critical step in creating a peaceful home. This doesn’t mean autocratic rules and an unwillingness to compromise; what it does mean is deciding what’s most important, being completely clear on what it is, and following through.   When I was raising my kids as a single mom, these were the standards I held highest: - We treat each other with love and respect. - We don’t hurt each other physically or verbally. - We listen to Mom and speak to her respectfully, whether or not we agree with what she has to say.  At our family meetings, when we put together guidelines for a peaceful family, these standards were interwoven with guidelines my children suggested. Being clear on what was important to me, helped them understand what I expected. We can never assume that our kids automatically know what our expectations are. Expectations can change from day to day, mood to mood, so it’s essential to get clear on what yours are in your own mind first.  The majority of parents I’ve talked to who’ve had trouble with their kids’ behavior admit that they’ve been inconsistent in conveying what their standards are. They’ve also been inconsistent in sticking to them. If one of your standards is “There is no physical fighting,” be one hundred per cent clear that this is non-negotiable. Then even on bad days when your nerves are shot and you’re energy’s drained, don’t ignore a physical fight. Physical fighting, like put-downs, has no positive purpose and does not belong in our homes.  Explain why your standards are important so your children don’t see them as arbitrary. For example,  “Physical fighting only makes things worse. Can you imagine if your dad and I belted each other every time we got mad, or if I punched my boss punched each time we had a disagreement?”  Try this exercise: What standards are most important to you? Reflect on this, and write about it. Brainstorm a list of standards and then choose the top three or four. As much as possible, frame them in the positive, e.g.: We treat each other with kindness and respect. We work out our differences using words, not fists. We listen when Mom and Dad ask us to do something. Now have a family meeting and tell your children what your standards are. Find out what’s important to them too, and come up with some guidelines for a peaceful home.  By having clear, consistent standards and limits, you’ll cut back power struggles and extended periods of nagging. When I was teaching first grade many years ago, I still remember one child turning to a boy who was used getting his way by badgering his parents, and saying, “Nagging doesn’t work with Mrs. Drew so you might as well forget it!”  Children learn very quickly not to waste energy nagging and whining when they don’t get what they want from it. By honoring our own standards and sticking by what we say, children start to see that manipulation doesn’t get them anywhere.  Our standards and limits create the firm ground that our children walk on. Each time we ignore our own standards it’s like the ground beneath our children’s feet opens up and their foundation becomes shaky. Renowned child psychologist, Haim Ginnott once said, “Children depend on the adults in their lives to set limits for them until they are old enough to do so for themselves.”  By consistently setting fair limits and honoring our own standards we teach our children that the ground they walk on is solid.  Does that mean never compromising? Absolutely not. The trick here is to compromise when you think it’s the best thing to do, not when your children have worn you down. In fact it’s a good idea to think ahead of time about areas where you are willing to compromise. This is particularly important with teens and pre-teens whose growing independence is nurtured by a balance of compromise and limits. Discussing decisions and hearing out your kids is so important. Even if you don’t plan to change your mind about a decision you’ve made, give your child a chance to air his or her feelings (respectfully). Listening, more than anything gives kids a sense of being respected. What we give out, we get back.  I remember talking with a spirited teen named Quinn when I was writing my last book. Her words have always stuck with me. She said, “I’ve learned by my mom’s example to do what’s right. I completely respect her. She negotiates with me instead of just telling me what to do. She helps me understand her reasoning. I want to do what she asks because I love her so much. You do things out of the heart.”  Positive discipline requires us to walk a fine line between laying down the law and negotiating, sticking to our guns and compromising, being caring and being firm.   In this regard, here’s an exercise you might want to try:  What current discipline issue are you dealing with? Go to a quiet spot, close your eyes and take some slow deep breaths. Ask your wise self (your most intuitive place) what to do about this particular issue. Breathe deep and invite the wisest part of yourself to provide insights. When you are finished, write down whatever came up.   Peaceful parenting requires true intentionality, just a peace in the world does. As we know all to well, peace doesn’t just happen spontaneously. It needs our help. And it’s critical that we nurture it on every level - within ourselves, our families, our communities, and the world. Home is the place where peace starts, and the person it starts with is you.  From the Peaceful Parents Newsletter.

       Bless you, kitty cat   With Friday the 13th upon us, you may feel especially leery of black cats, who in the Middle Ages were believed to transform themselves into witches after so many years of companionship. There is hardly a culture that doesn’t regard cats as holy or diabolical creatures. For example,   • A strange black cat on your porch brings prosperity. – Scottish   • A cat sneezing is a good omen for everyone who hears it. – Italian   • When a cat washes behind its ears, you may expect visitors. – Dutch   • A cat sleeping with all four paws tucked under means cold weather ahead. – English   • It is bad luck to cross a stream carrying a cat. – French   • Dreaming of a white cat means good luck. – American   • To kill a cat brings 17 years of bad luck. – Irish

       Yoda statue stolen!   What is this world coming to!  Someone lifted a 170-pound bronze statue of Yoda, the "Star Wars" Jedi master.  The theft from a flatbed truck was reported to police last weekend and artist Lawrence Noble has offered a $1,000 reward for its return. The limited-edition bronze is worth up to $20,000.  The statue was one of four bolted to a flatbed truck parked overnight Jan. 17 at the Westway Inn on Colorado Boulevard. Police said someone grabbed Yoda that night or early the next morning. Lucasfilm Ltd. commissioned the statues, a part of a planned series featuring other "Star Wars" characters.  The statues were being transported from Artworks Foundry in Berkeley to DKE Enterprises in Los Angeles to be sold.

       Lessons hide behind failures   It is unrealistic to expect to have the success in anything you do without the expecting failures along the way.  When those failures happen look at them as lessons, lessons not to be repeated, lessons showing you how to do it right the next time.  Any experience you have can be transformed in to something of value, it all depends on how you look at it.  If you remain focused and determined those lessons become the stepping-stones to the success that you seek.  From  urlLink Meditations for Women

       “Fulfillment comes from developing your own talents, not wishing for someone else’s”   Talent does not have to mean you paint masterpieces, talent can be found in much more than that.  Caring for others is talent, teaching is talent, making people feel welcome is talent, solving problems is talent and parenting is talent.  Don’t underestimate your own talents, try not to compare your talents to others.  Focus on what you can do, accept the talents you have.  That is where the fulfillment is, in your talent and nobody else’s.  From  urlLink Meditations for Women

      I read this over at  urlLink Bruderhof Communities  and found it interesting enough to share it with you all.  Have a great Thursday!    Being a Woman   Margrit Meier    What is the woman’s task in this world? Today, more and more emphasis is placed on the idea that the woman should make strenuous efforts to put herself on the same level as the man or even above him so that her being is complete. Struggle for power. Strife…   God’s creation —“and God saw that it was good.” Man alone. That was not good. So God sent the woman to be his helper…   Man the head, woman his helper:  love in both. Man may be stronger, but he needs help. If he thinks he can make it without help, doesn’t he set the stage for the woman to compete for power? And woman fights for her rights because she fears defeat.   If love is missing, things go wrong.  Man needs a loving counterpart, which his wife provides for him as her head. That is God’s will. Then there will be joy in the family. Then there will be peace on earth.  Man  urlLink and woman have different tasks, which complement each other.

       "Awareness gives you the Power to take control"   Throughout each day you are constantly talking to yourself.  It's completely normal, we all do it.  In fact we do it so much that if our self talk is negative our subconscious mind accepts it as truth and all that negative thinking becomes who we are.  When you scratch just below the surface of the areas in your life that are not working, you will find negative limiting beliefs.  Take the time to identify precisely what those beliefs are, bring those beliefs to your conscious mind.  The awareness you gain may just be enough to stop those beliefs dead in their tracks.

       “Learn the art of compromise and collaboration”   With harmony in your life, you can find peace and serenity.  You can be at one with your inner child and with nature.  You can see more; feel more; hear more.  Harmony is a beautiful thing.  And it has one enemy: conflict.  When conflict arises, don’t allow it to grow and fester in your life.  Recognize that those with differing views are not out to beat you down but merely approaching things from a different direction.

       “Let go of your world long enough to see the beauty around you”   Most of us are too occupied or too involved in what must be accomplished today or tomorrow to notice the beauty around us.  We rarely look up from our daily tasks to appreciate the beauty of our environment.  Take a moment from your hectic schedule today and smell the flowers, watch the graceful soaring of a kite or even marvel at the stars in the sky.  You will be amazed the freedom you feel and the peace it brings to your soul.  From  urlLink Meditations for Women

      All pet owners, dogs or cats, can appreciate this one!  Dear Dog and Cat:  When I say to move, it means go someplace else, not switch positions with each other so there are still two of you in the way.   The dishes with the paw prints are yours and contain your food. The other dishes are mine and contain my food. (Please note, placing a paw print in the middle of my plate of food does not stake a claim for it  becoming your food & dish, nor do I find that aesthetically pleasing in the slightest.)  The stairway was not designed by NASCAR and is not a racetrack. Beating me to the bottom is not the object. Tripping me doesn't help because I fall faster than you can run.   I cannot buy anything bigger than a king size bed. I am very sorry about this. Do not think I will continue to sleep on the couch to ensure your comfort. Look at videos of dogs and cats sleeping.  They can actually curl up in a ball. It is not necessary to sleep perpendicular to each other stretched out to the fullest extent  possible. (I also know that sticking tails straight out and having tongues hanging out the other end to maximize space used is nothing but sarcasm.)   My compact discs are not miniature Frisbees.   For the last time, there is not a secret exit from the bathroom. If by some miracle I beat you there and manage to get the door shut, it is not necessary to claw, whine, meow, try to turn the knob, or get your paw under the edge and try to pull the door open. I must exit through the same door I entered. (In addition, I have been using the bathroom for years...canine or feline attendance is not mandatory.)   The proper order is kiss me, then go smell the other dogs or cats' butt. I cannot stress this enough. It would be such a simple change for you.

      Welcome to my new page.  Well...it's not really new.  After having problems with the layout over at Thoughts of the Day I decided to start using this one.  Besides the problem with the layout there where other reasons.  I was getting tired of how the other one looked.  And the title on this one suits me better.  That is how I feel at times, I feel as if I'm standing at the edge of the earth searching for answers.  I hope my blogging friends will change their links to this new page.  As you can see, I'm still adding links to some of my favorite blogs.

       “Walking is a moving mediation”   Walking allows you to slow down, and notice what’s going on around you.  If your life is going in a hundred different directions and moving a million miles an hour, walking will allow you to focus on being fully present.  It will provide you with an opportunity to mull over something that may be on your mind, or simply to notice the beauty and bounty of what surrounds you.   Walking can be a time for self-discovery, a time to reconnect with yourself.  Take 15 minutes today and just walk, your mind will settle and you will gain the physical and emotional benefits of moving your body.  From  urlLink Meditations for Women

        A Cat’s Prayer     I ask for the privilege of not being born...not to be born until you can assure me of a home and a master to protect me, and the right to live as long as I am physically able to enjoy life...not to be born until my body is precious and men have ceased to exploit it because it is cheap and plentiful. ~ Author Unknown   I'm sure you have seen them in your neighborhood, gathered around dumpsters, in parking lots, in parks, trying to cross busy streets -- they are homeless cats who flee from humans. They are domestic cats, referred to as "feral," the result of both the failure to spay/neuter and cat abandonment. Ferals are erroneously labeled as "wild cats." A mountain lion is a wild cat, a feral cat is a homeless domestic cat.  A group of feral cats living together in one area is called a "colony." Trap-Neuter-Return (TNR) is an effective, internationally recognized program to reduce, and eventually eliminate, feral cat colonies. Cats are trapped, vaccinated, spayed/neutered, and returned to their original location. In a TNR program, a feral cat colony caretaker, who is usually a volunteer rescue worker, feeds the cats on a regular basis and brings them to a veterinarian if they require medical assistance. The resultant group of cats, including any new cats entering the caretaker's sphere, is known as a managed feral cat colony. This program is also referred to as TAR (Trap-Alter-Return). Along with TNR, caregivers promote public education about society's responsibility to our community and to the domestic animals we have created.  The safest place for domestic cats is indoors; cats who are lucky enough to have a home should be kept inside. However, because of the overpopulation crisis, there are not enough available homes. The next best thing for feral domestic cats born outdoors is a managed colony where food, water, shelter, and medical care are consistently provided.  Here are some things that you can do: * Become involved with feral cat rescue. * Help educate your community -- become a spokesperson for ferals. * Make sure all cats in your care are spayed or neutered. * Support TNR efforts in your community. The biggest obstacle for most caregivers is fighting with hostile neighbors. * Always choose to adopt, rather than purchase, companion animals.* Ask your shelter to implement a feral cat program based on Trap-Neuter-Return. * The humane management and reduction of feral cat populations requires a community’s effort. Get involved. Help end the suffering of these cats and prevent future litters. If you cannot do it on your own, volunteer with a local feral cat rescue organization. Remember: Do not attempt to handle or trap a homeless cat without first consulting with an experienced rescuer.  * If you are unable to help feral cats in your area, please seek assistance from a rescue group or individual rescuer. Ignoring homeless animals is precisely what perpetuates the problem.

       One cat just leads to another. ~ Ernest Hemmingway    My friend Jane is a volunteer for  urlLink TAILS Humane Society  in DeKalb, Illinois. She does everything from hands-on interactions with the animals to fundraising. She fosters kittens until they are old enough to be adopted. She is also involved in (TNR) Trap-Neuter-Return, an effective, internationally recognized program to reduce, and eventually eliminate, feral cat colonies.  During the "kitten season" the shelter is overwhelmed with kittens. The season comes between May and September, with peak months for kitten births in June, July and August. During these months, the number of kittens and pregnant cats at shelters multiplies. This shelter is prepared to handle 60 cats and kittens at a time. As of June 1st there were nearly 100, I’m sure that number has drastically changed since than.  The shelter accepts as many animals as it possibly can, it also places kittens in foster homes while searching for permanent homes for them. The shelter provides its 10 to 15 foster cat owners with the medical supplies and food they need to care for the kittens. My friend Jane now has 15 kittens residing in her home.  Jane is deeply committed and speaks to me often about this problem. For every litter that comes into the shelter there's two or three that don't make it to the shelter, they are dumped at farms, parks, homes or in the wild. These kittens face the dangers of other wildlife, vehicles, bad weather and exposure to viruses their immune systems can't handle. If they survive to adulthood, they will likely mate, creating more homeless animals.   The problem has an easy solution: have pets spayed or neutered.   A common reason people don't get their pets fixed is because they claim it’s too expensive. There are veterinarian clinics that offer low cost spaying or neutering, information that is easily obtained from a local shelter, the humane society or  urlLink Love that Cat  website which provides a great listing.    REMEMBER PLEASE DON’T LITTER! SPAY AND NEUTER!

       "I should get that done, I’ll do it later"    Procrastinate, we all do it, but for some women it rules their lives. Procrastination has a way of making them feel weak or indecisive and later on, guilty for not doing what they said they would.    Sound familiar? "I should get that done, I’ll do it later." These are the sirens of procrastination.    Next time you’re faced with a project and these words of procrastination enter your head, take a look at what you want to accomplish, examine your reasons for resistance, then ask yourself, is it something that I can start now. If so, then start.    See yourself as someone who makes solid decisions. When you commit to something, honor it.    urlLink From Meditations for Women   How many of us are guilty of procrastinating?&nbsp; Take me, for example.&nbsp; For the past two years (geez, has it been that long) I have been putting off editing the novel I have written.&nbsp; You may ask yourself why have I been putting it off?&nbsp; I wish I had a good enough answer for you.&nbsp; I'd like to blame it on not having enough hours in the day but in truth I just keep putting it off, saying "I'll start&nbsp;it tomorrow."&nbsp; Two years of tomorrows have passed by.&nbsp; It's time for me to stop putting it off, roll up my sleeves and get down to some serious editing.  What have been putting off doing?

       TRUE HAPPINESS    We all want to find true happiness.&nbsp; More often we look to others to find that happiness, never realizing that the key to happiness lives hidden within each of us.    urlLink Leslie  has a&nbsp;wonderful post today titled  A Personal Test .&nbsp;&nbsp; Her words have struck home for me.&nbsp; If you haven't already, you should check out what she has to say.    10 Steps To Finding True Happiness    The Hidden Key Within Ourselves    1. Accept yourself and acknowledge both your pains and your joys. Honesty within yourself will free you from inner conflicts and allow you to grow.   2. Nurture yourself as often as you can, be it with a daily personal ritual, a regular massage or simply a few hours with a good book.   3. Contemplating your weaknesses inspires fear, but focusing on strengths will bolster your mind. Self-improvement is a noble goal, yet it is important to recognize your contributions to the world. Revel in those activities that empower you.   4. It is written in the Bhagavad-Gita that "the highest happiness comes upon the yogi whose mind is calmed." Choose pathways in life based on the peace they inspire within you and happiness will follow.   5. While money counts, true happiness lies elsewhere. Ask yourself what paths you would most like to follow even without financial gain. Immerse yourself in beloved hobbies and they may evolve into more.   6. Open your mind and increase your imagination. Use your intuition as a guide.   7. Deep inside ourselves, we understand the actions that will make us happy. When doubt begins to creep in, take it as a warning and examine your actions using your heart as your guide.   8. Intense, joyful effort should not be a struggle. When it becomes one, it is time to retrace your steps and ask where happiness lies.   9. Never lose sight of your emotions. Your own reactions are signs clearly marking the way to happiness, but there are other, less obvious clues. Be open to new ideas that may contribute to your well being.   10. New experiences are a pathway to joy and wisdom, not an occasion to win or lose. The loftiest successes are often achieved through a simple leap of faith.

Let no one deceive another,    Let no one anywhere despise another,   Let no one out of anger or resentment   Wish suffering to anyone at all.   Just as a mother with her own life   Protects her child, her only child, from hurt,   So within yourself let grow   A boundless love for all creatures.   Let your love flow outward through the whole universe   To its full height, depth, and broad extent,   Then, as you stand or walk,   Sit or lie down,   As long as you are awake,   Strive for this with a onepointed mind:   Your life will bring heaven to earth.    - Translated by Stephen H.

       “There is nothing more that shapes your destiny than your decisions”   All the decisions you have made throughout your life have brought you where you are today.  You control your life by the decisions you make.  If you let others make decisions for you then you are giving those people the key to your destiny.  Take charge, take control, keep the key locked in a safe place.  You are responsible for your life and you need to be the decision maker in the decisions that affect your life.  Look to yourself first, look to others for guidance but ultimately there is no one better than you to decide.   urlLink From Meditations for Women    Tip of the Day:   A positive attitude may not solve all your problems, but it will annoy enough people to make it worth the effort. ~ Unknown

       WHEN THE WINDS BLOWS ..   Years ago a farmer owned land along the Atlantic seacoast. He constantly advertised for hired hands.  Most people were reluctant to work on farms along the Atlantic. They dreaded the awful storms that raged across the Atlantic, wreaking havoc on the buildings and crops. As the farmer interviewed applicants for the job, he received a steady stream of refusals.  Finally, a short, thin man, well past middle age, approached the farmer. "Are you a good farmhand?" the farmer asked him.  "Well, I can sleep when the wind blows," answered the little man.  Although puzzled by this answer, the farmer, desperate for help, hired him. The little man worked well around the farm, busy from dawn to dusk, and the farmer felt satisfied with the man's work.  Then one night the wind howled loudly in from offshore.  Jumping out of bed, the farmer grabbed a lantern and rushed next door to the hired hand's sleeping quarters. He shook the little man and yelled, "Get up! A storm is coming! Tie things down before they blow away!"  The little man rolled over in bed and said firmly, "No sir.  I told you, I can sleep when the wind blows."  Enraged by the response, the farmer was tempted to fire him on the spot.  Instead, he hurried outside to prepare for the storm. To his amazement, he discovered that all of the haystacks had been covered with tarpaulins.  The cows were in the barn, the chickens were in the coops, and the doors were barred. The shutters were tightly secured.  Everything was tied down. Nothing could blow away.  The farmer then understood what his hired hand meant, so he returned to his bed to also sleep while the wind blew.   MORAL: When you're prepared, spiritually, mentally, and physically, you  have nothing to fear. Can you sleep when the wind blows through your life?   The hired hand in the story was able to sleep because he had secured the farm against the storm. We, as believers in Christ, secure ourselves against the storms of life by grounding ourselves in the Word of God. We don't need to understand, we just need to hold His hand to have peace in the midst of the storms.  I hope you sleep well!  REMEMBER: Good friends are like angels, you don't have to see them to know they are there.

       Hugs   We have all heard that we need four hugs a day for survival, eight hugs a day for maintenance and twelve for growth.  Hugs have a healing effect on our bodies, they improve our immune system and they help us feel special.  Hugs have a way of nurturing the little child within us and helping us feel close to our family and friends.  If you are not getting your twelve hugs a day, reach out and ask for the hugs you need.

      This pretty much describes the weather here today...   STORMS    Pretty soon it darkened up, and begun to thunder and lighten; so the birds was right about it. Directly it begun to rain, and it rained like all fury, too, and I never see the wind blow so. It was one of these regular summer storms. It would get so dark that it looked all blue-black outside, and lovely; and the rain would thrash along by so thick that the trees off a little ways looked dim and spider-webby; and here would come a blast of wind that would bend the trees down and turn up the pale under-side of the leaves; and then a perfect ripper of a gust would follow along and set the branches to tossing their arms as if they was just wild; and next, when it was just about the bluest and blackest--fst! it was as bright as glory, and you'd have a little glimpse of tree-tops a-plunging about away off yonder in the storm, hundreds of yards further than you could see before; dark as sin again in a second, and now you'd hear the thunder let go with an awful crash, and then go rumbling, grumbling, tumbling, down the sky towards the under side of the world, like rolling empty barrels down stairs--where it's long stairs and they bounce a good deal, you know.  ~Adventures of Huckleberry Finn   I wish I could write like that!

        "Adventure can be as simple as just stepping out your front door with no definite plan in mind"      Too often we think of adventure as this big thing we have to plan way in advance. We think arrangements need to be made, schedules coordinated, flights booked, time off secured, etc. With such planning the adventure in the adventure is easily lost.    Adventure is really a decision to do something to inspire awe in yourself. It can be simple, when you take your daily walk today try not to look at it in the same old way, approach it with curiosity. See something new, smell something new, don’t be afraid to explore.     urlLink From Meditations for Women

        The Tonic of Wildness    We need the tonic of wildness, to wade sometimes in marshes where the bittern and the meadow-hen lurk, and hear the booming of the snipe; to smell the whispering sedge where only the wilder and more solitary fowl builds her nest, and the mink crawls with its belly close to the ground. At the same time that we are earnest to explore and learn all things, we require that all things be mysterious and unexplorable, that land and sea be infinitely wild, unsurveyed and unfathomed by us because unfathomable. We can never have enough of nature. We must be refreshed by the sight of inexhaustible vigor, vast and titanic features, the sea-coast with its wrecks, the wilderness with its living and its decaying trees, the thunder cloud, and the rain which lasts three weeks and produces freshets. We need to witness our own limits transgressed, and some life pasturing freely where we never wander.   Henry David Thoreau, Walden

      "To find you have to seek"  What counts for you?  If you are not sure then it's time to rediscover your passion.  Start by simplifying, quit doing things merely out of habit.  Try turning off the TV for a month, and listen to your thoughts.  Notice what you think and what you read.  When you find yourself saying "I love that" or "this is fun", stand up and listen.  That voice inside you is leading you to your passion.  As you discover what you like to do with your time you begin to find answers to what counts for you.  And that is what being passionate is all about.  From Meditations for Women

Cherish the music that stirs in your heart, the beauty that forms in your mind, the loveliness that drapes your purest thoughts, for out of them will grow all delightful conditions, all heavenly environment; of these, if you but remain true to them, your world will at last be built."   ~ James Allen (1864-1912), English author of As A Man Thinketh   As you can tell, I have been playing around with my page and I'm pretty happy with it.  I'm still trying to get my Haloscan comment up and running but I'm still having some technical difficulties.  I'm waiting for  urlLink Dorothy  to return from her 10 day vacation before asking her for some more help.  In the mean time, we'll have to learn to live with the blogger comment.

       As Homer Simpson once said...    "Remember, as far as anyone knows, we're a nice, normal family."   I know that I have posted that quote before but because it cracks me up everyone time I see it, here it is again.

       "But angels help us remember, when the urgencies screaming for attention make us forget, when we feel so estranged by stress or worldliness that we miss the many-splendored things. They remind us to look beyond our everyday circumstances or stress."  ~ Timothy Jones, "Celebration of Angels"

       Everything we call a trial, a sorrow, or a duty; believe me, that Angel’s hand is there, and the wonder of an overshadowing presence. Our joys too: be not content with them as joys. They too conceal diviner gifts. ~  Fra Giovanni

       "Friends and family are the foundation from which your successes are built and nourished"   From the very first breath you take your mind, body and soul is nourished by the friends and family that touch you.  Imagine what it would be like to reach your ultimate goal and have no one there to share your triumph and success.  The triumph and success is so much sweeter when it is shared with those that mean the most to you.  As you march through the peaks and valleys of your life allow your friends and family to share in your journey, the sense of accomplishment and satisfaction will be just that much greater.   urlLink From Meditations for Women

      Do you ever feel rushed?  Ever feel as if you are doing a balancing act?  If you are like me the answer to both questions is YES!  Here are 9 steps to help simplify your life.  9 Steps to Simplify Your Life  1. Take a walk after your evening meal to clear your mind and aid digestion. 2.  Post chores on a bulletin board in a central location. 3.  Increase precious personal time.  Say “no” more often, even to family and friends. 4.  Free yourself from perfectionism.  In most cases, good enough really is. 5.  Use checklists to simplify shopping, traveling and entertaining. 6.  Get out of debt.  Be happy with less of what you’re told you need.  Enjoy what you have. 7.  Keep a list of fun activities and be sure you do at least one of them each month. 8.  Get enough sleep and exercise. 9.  Remember you don’t have to answer the phone just because it rings.

      Sorry I haven't posted in a few days.  I was hit hard by a nasty strain of the flu on Tuesday and have been feeling pretty bad since.  My daughter had this bug last week so it was only a matter of time before I came down with it.  Axel is in Minneapolis this weekend for the  urlLink Metris Uptown Art Fair .  Check it out if you happen to live in the area.  Well, that's enough for now.  Time to lay back down.   Words of wisdown:    Life is a roller-coaster. Try to eat a light lunch.-  David Schmaltz

       Do Good Anyway   Dr. Kent M. Keith Quote    "People are unreasonable, illogical and self-centered. Love them anyway.    If you do good, people will accuse you of selfish, ulterior motives. Do good anyway.  If you are successful, you will win false friends and true enemies. Succeed anyway.  The good you do today will be forgotten tomorrow. Do good anyway.  Honesty and frankness make you vulnerable. Be honest and frank anyway.  The biggest person with the biggest ideas can be shot down by the smallest person with the smallest mind. Think big anyway.  People favor underdogs but follow only top dogs. Fight for a few underdogs anyway.  What you spend years building may be destroyed overnight. Build anyway.  People really need help but may attack if you help them. Help people anyway.  Give the world the best you have and you might get kicked in the teeth. Give the world the best you've got anyway."     The Paradoxical Commandments   by Dr. Kent M. Keith

        Simplicity, Clarity, Singleness...     In the end, what affects your life most deeply are things too simple to talk about. ~ Nell Blaine    Enjoy the little things, for one day you may look back and realize they were the big things. ~ Robert Brault    Simplicity is making the journey of this life with just baggage enough. ~ Charles Dudley Warner    I believe the art of living consists not so much in complicating simple things as in simplifying things that are not. ~ François Hertel    Simplicity, carried to an extreme, becomes elegance. ~ Jon Franklin    Simplicity, clarity, singleness: these are the attributes that give our lives power and vividness and joy. ~ Richard Halloway    It is the sweet, simple things of life which are the real ones after all. ~ Laura Ingalls Wilder    To know when you have enough is to be rich. ~ Lao-Tzu
