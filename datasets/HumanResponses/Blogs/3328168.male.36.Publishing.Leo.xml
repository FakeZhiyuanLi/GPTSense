         May brings the first of the big movies for the year, so there are several that I'm really looking forward to.       I was disappointed with Van Helsing.     Troy shows promise, but I'm not going in with high expectations.  We'll see if Brad Pitt can pull this off right.     Shrek 2 looks good, and it helps to have all of the primary roles are returning, so it should be decent.     The Day After Tomorrow is a huge movie with special effects galore and one of my favorite actors, Jake Gyllenhaal.       Speaking of Jake Gyllenhaal, they are re-releasing Donnie Darko this summer.  It's a very dark movie about a high school student who talks with a tall rabbit name Frank.  Yes, it's a little off the beaten path of the typical movie.     Vin Diesel's latest, The Chronicles of Riddick, looks interesting.  This is the sequel to the great Pitch Black.  I hope they can pull it off.     Garden State looks very interesting.  It's another low budget film that isn't getting much attention, but I think it will end being a sleeper.     The Village is M. Night Shyamalan's latest flick.  As with all of his movies, it looks very different than everything else out there.  Unfortunately, it has Joaquin Phoenix in it.     Open Water looks to be the next Blair Witch Project without the shaky camera, or at least I hope so.  It's based on a true story about two divers who get left behind and must spend their time surviving the deep blue sea and everything in it.     This is nowhere near my full list, but it's at least the movie's I'm starting to psyched about.  -Chris

         It has to start somewhere, so here goes...     I saw Van Helsing over the weekend.  It's the first of the big movies to open this month, but I wasn't impressed.  It was cool seeing all of the monsters in one movie, but the ending totally sucked.       Taco Bell Home Originals had a promotion running where specially marked boxes had one of five taco holders shaped like cars.  I bought three boxes and ended up with three Kenseth cars.  Ugh.  And I don't even use the taco shells.     Kraft also had a promo with some cheese jars that have Martin on the jar itself.  I, of course, couldn't find any.     A fan emailed me earlier this week with a picture of the jar.  I got to talking with her through email, and she said she has both a Martin taco holder and cheese jar that she will send me.  In exchange, I'm sending her a Martin bobblehead with a Mickey Mouse figure with it.  Finally, I can stop checking out every grocery store for this stuff.  -Chris
