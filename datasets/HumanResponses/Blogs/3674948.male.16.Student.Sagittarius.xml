      "Calm down.  It's just a commercial."    Wise words.  We think not.  Continuing the barrage of demonic advertising that we are subjected to Esure decided to advertise by making a random (at least to me) old guy try and act and drive all those men and women crazy.  But, thankfully, he had those lucky words to say that saved him from his acting.  Oh lucky words...and it turns out it wasn't a commercial, it was a waste of time- I now have absolutely no idea who esure are.

      So youd think that the brains at microsoft can keep the simplest games working for just a short while, during which i can beat the pulp out of friends at Nike Ole.  But no.  THey're useless.  Everytime you try log in or try to play a game all you get is unavailable or try another time.  I'll try another frikin time but with AIM or Yahoo.

      So here at YGY? heard that we had competition from the likes of the Stupidity Police and we would like to post our formal statement about the matter:  "We couldn't care less" quoted from the editor himself.  Anyway in other news Google   fans out there can get their very own G-mail accounts that have a Gb of storage.  Does that seal the deal.  I don't think so.  Apparently you can't delete any of your mail, ever.  Crazy- yes!  Also Google will constantly search your 'private' mail and send you appropriate spam!  Madness but some may say it is worth it for all that storage.

      So the greatness that are the gods of advertising have decided that we are docile, programmable animals and the only way we buy stuff (elephant.co.uk)is by repeating (elephant.co.uk) the same name (elephant.co.uk) over (elephant.co.uk) and over (elephant.co.uk) a-bloody-gen. So it comes to no surprise that when seeing an advert with an elephant and the words elephant.co.uk being repeated so many times my head hurts, that all I could think of after the ad was why don't elephants ever forget...it certainly isn't with the help of (giraffe.co.uk).

      So this is the time of year that the powers that be decide to create a mass shortage of watchable TV resulting in a line up that is as funny and interesting as Channel 5's intellectually stimulating string of 'evening entertainment.'  Firstly those who thought it would be a great idea to end Friends have done so and unfortunately, in my opinion at least, not in the best way (killing off the chick and duck was unforgivable!).  So after Friends ended came a weekend of brand spanking new serieses; more than 20 episodes of old (but very funny) episodes on Friends on Channel 4 for the whole weekend....what fun.  So Friends ends and the good friends at Big Brother return for a summer of light entertainment, jilted love and kraziness..or not.  Big Brother decided to stick a politically minded / misguided lesbian, a few homosexuals, a Muslim homophobe, a few girls and guys and a questionable transexual into a pot and stir things up by getting EVIL...or not.  The tasks are useless, the people mad and boring and the TV is unwatchable.  Even the housmates are so wound up that they decided to take it out on each other in a fight that brought 'security' in and the police so we may yet see the end of Big Brother!  So we win some and lose some right.  Wrong.  Friends replacement, new episodes of Simpsons, is scheduled for autumn so a long and very hot summer of no comedy ensues.  It doesn't look as if we will ever get the greatness that is Scrubs back, and with have I got News For You being a bit off without the discredited presenter to laugh at there isn't much going on.  I watched the fantastic Hannibal for the first time and Silence of the Lambs that premiered and then the 'critically acclaimed' (by some friends as well (A.S u know who you are)) Jurassic Park 3 that is a fantastic joke if only it were a comedy.  And now the end of GCSEs and the beginning of A levels.  Hopefully we can start driving, at 17 apparently to those who don't know.  Anyway this is the end of this short rant so well till next blog.
