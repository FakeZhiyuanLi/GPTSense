      Zach emailed me today. he added me to his list that gets sent out to like twenty people. when i checked my email and saw his name on the return address, it scared me. then it just pissed me off. i can't believe the nerve of that boy. that scumbag, lowdown, disgusting human slime boy. i can't believe the nerve. i was going to write a one-liner response--something like, "go fuck yourself." or "don't ever send me your fucking emails again." or something. but i decided it was juevenile and just blocked him. i had tried to block him before but it didn't work for some reason.  it's 10:12 and i'm researching Mary Wollstonecraft. who, as i just learned, was one of those scary feminists. which i guess was pretty radical in her early day of 1760. she sounded pretty hardcore--had illegit kids and everything. lesbian affairs. menage a trois. pretty sexually liberated. i cannot belive that i have to PLAY HER. it's going to suck. i'm bringing in Shellina and she's going to be my prop (playing my daughter, Mary Shelley). since we've made so many movies and plays together AND since we've known each other since we were babies, our chemistry is good and we can work well together. improvise. it's going to be kind of SNL-ish with a dash of Meryl Streep high drama. but mostly a farce. i can't even believe that i'm putting this much effort into it. probably because weaver knows i want to be a movie actress and filmmaker---the pressure's on, baby. it feels like a fucking audition.  i should probably go to bed. or at least get in bed and pretend tp be sleeping. but as sam would say, "she's and individual." hahaha. what a laugh.  i got my haircut by Cabbage Patch cheeks. i look like one of the fab for--a dirty blonde one. my hair sucks. but i put spray-in wax (wahoo--first cosmetical luxury in years) and am going to attempt SOMETHING. the Czarina also got her hair cut. the woman told her to stop dying it with henna, cause it stains the hair and dries it out. the Czarina got pissed and we left. her hair still wet.  after that we went to aunt Verushka's just like i reluctantly agreed to do. it sucked as usual. aunt Verushka had the Czarina change her sheets and hang up flowers. i sat there drinking black tea (Verushka adds NOTHING, not rum, sugar, milk). she lets the bag steep for like ten minutes until it looks like ink and then she puts fennel and cloves in it. nasty poison. Verushka asked me why i'm such a "glum." which i guess she thinks means "brat". i smiled a little bit and said that i was tired. she raised her eye brows. i raised my eyebrows back. she refilled my tea. i drank it defiantly. then--  aunt verushka got out this box from under her hideous hospital-like bed. wooden, and carved with chickens and eggs on it--standard soviet design. she opened it. ugly marroon velvet interior. but filled with incredible stuff. chains and gold pendants and a gold egg. beaded and coined earrings and big jewelled rings and stuff. most of it was fake, but some of it wasn't. she sat there picking through it with her hideous pepto-bismol fingernails and i almost thought that she was going to ask me to have something. you know, kind of like a peace offering. no such luck. the woman is like an old leather sack. no matter how hard you try to rip it, it's so tough and leathery you can't get in.   she put on some of the jewellry and admired herself in the mirror and applied red-scare lipstick that was probably left over from Stalin years. the Czarina finished with the sheets and we were ready to leave and Verushka said,  Verushka: Misha. Misha, Misha, Misha. Me: yes? (is she having a seizure?) Verushka: turn around. Me: (now totally scared for my soul. i turn around.) Verushka: pull up your pants. they're by the floor. Me: (dutifully pulling up my pants---they did kind of look rapper-esque, but i couldn't help it--they're too big) Verushka: turn back around. Me: (i feel like fucking eliza dolittle by now) Verushka: (face cracking into Cruella Deville evil smile) there.   pause  Verushka: you ever thought of...of (she grabs this old fashion magazine and there's a picture of some girl walking down a runway, pretty standard) Me: no. (hah) Verushka: oh, that's good. i mean, you're certainly tall and thin, but...the face...(she sighs, points to my face, frowns, smiles sacchirine) Me: yeah. i know what you mean.   that's the extent of Verushka's compassion. pretty powerful stuff.   she should just go the fuck home to her shitty motherland.                             i wish i were beautiful--   everything would be so much easier.
