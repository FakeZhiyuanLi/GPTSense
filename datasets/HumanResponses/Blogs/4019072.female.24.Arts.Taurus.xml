      year 2002 when i graduated from college, to this date never had a job (i have private patients though). i've been tempted to go in to field somewhat deviated from my profession (call center, lecturer, lady guard, tindera ng 1st quadrant ect...) my hopes and dreams were once close to reality, then failure came in... the biggest i've ever had in my life :( i knew it... God is teaching me a lot of things... no 1 is not to take things for granted... two years is long enough waiting but im learning to trust God's timing and perfect will. now another one sets in agen, still, i'll let Him do things for me. just want to share this mind bugging situation i'm in. and the bottom line is... pag-pray nyo po ko!!!tanda ko na la pa ren akong "career", frustrating talaga...kaya BAHALA KA NA LORD!!!  p.s. posted it last july from my previous blog site, which i think is now closed!

      felt so tired and lethargic during the whole week, i have to wake up at five thirty and go straight to the Hospital i am serving in (but only for a month, good for me!) im gaining strength now.... though its draining, i like myself.... when i wake up early when i'm not late (so most of the time, i hate me. but i know God is in the process on changing my attitude) when im with busy people when im occupied by some things that would let me grow... as an OT, and as a person i just hope that i'll enjoy my stay in Cardinal Santos, its always a privilege to help people in need....
