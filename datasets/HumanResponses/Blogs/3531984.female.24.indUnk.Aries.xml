      GUYS!!! I've never ever been to any Free Standing Open concert...PLUS this being LINKIN PARK...really rocked the whole Padang man i tell u guys who din go there!!!   It was jus awesome....but first all thanks to my Boss cos he let me off at 4pm to rush down to Padang to queue cos i had to now act like a kiasu sporean in order not to lose out to those young punks who were already there like the wee hours!!   Luckily i wasn't too far back from the stage...By ard 7:30pm the entrance was free for us all to enter man...I was really glad that we were not far off from the stage at all! Boy was i glad to have gotten the 150 bucks tics cos the 85 bucks were really far back dude!! Haa...prob could only see the 'matchstick' of Chester or 'hair hormone disorder'(cos he was growing so much of hair on his head and face that he resembled jesus for a moment!) of Brad!  Oh well..the only upsetting thing that happened was that Linkin Park flew over thier fav band PIA, a Korean band....a really metallic..crap...kinda music to do a so called OPENING ACT....but hey that was not the worst....they actually performed 7 freaking songs!!! The fans were kinda pissed so they couldn't care less abt thier music and even started chanting "LINKIN PARK"..."LINKIN PARK"...so on and so on..and also "F*** OFF"...some even showed middle finger and blah blah blah...abit rude and stuff...but hey dun blame us come on!! We were here for Linkin not PIA!!   Hey hey...when Linkin Park came on....woah the crowd was rocking the Padang...we were practically jumping and rocking to the music!!! They were fantastic! But the heat and the dehydration nearly got to me...but i held on...haa..The crowd was jus wild with all the screaming and stuff...i wish that they could stay longer and i could just jump on stage to take pic with em!!!  Nevertheless the wait...it was al worth it!! I was glad i went...at least this is a story i can pass on to my kid...like ya see Mummy was HAPPENING back then! haaa...oh then wat abt Daddy?? Oh well...let's leave it to the future shall we....haa....Boring!  Chows....

All becos we're shifting to a new office!! Yipees! It's been a long awaited moment for me man...all the way back&nbsp;in April (when i first joined & when the renovation were driving all of us nuts!)&nbsp;Yohoo...But well&nbsp;just last week i had this stupid suggestion from my other boss that we might not be shifting to that new office, but rather to another office which was totally much smaller and not pratical and there it was a receptionist table waiting to be allocated for me!!! Oh wat the F***!!! The biggest mistake a boss can ever make to make the staff feel that way man! Really this insensitive freak! Hey i don't get paid to do a job of that alritey! Damn...but luckily lady luck was on my side...we WILL still continue to shift to the original office venue! Ok..now i'm like just waiting for the shifting proper to be done and vo la! I'd be decorating it nicely and comfortably like i always love to...of cos afterwhich i'll be taking some shots of our new office for your viewing! So...stay tune for it folks!     &nbsp;   As for my weekend...it was nice...cos i went shopping with my galfren on sat...woah was it a satisfying day man!!

      Ok...besides the bad dream that i had...there is this funny joke that i like from the 'chee na' variety show hosted by jack neo and another guy who was prev known as 'bao mei li'.   haaa...okie there was this part of the progm where the contestants had to imitate the singing voice of someone...Erm..ok don't ask me sing like who cos this guy was prob popular at the age when i wasn't even born!   Well...the compere was like telling the contestant that he should raise one of his legs up when he was singing (cos that's what the original singer likes to do) & this action should be done when at a LAMP POST...   ok here comes the funni part) Reason was becos..in the past, the singer had an accident hat crippled one of his leg..so they replaced one of the leg's bone with that of a dog...and thus whenever he sees a LAMP POST...he will raise up one of his leg as if he was pissing like a dog!  Haa...lame leggie joke...but if u guys saw the action, it would be so damn funny!

      Oh man....i could record yest nite as one of the worst nite ever!  First i had this super never ending horrifying dream...but the most unimaginable was that i saw the Nemo shark that was in the same amusement park as I am!! Gosh and it nearly ate me up!   *^@^*()%&$@ In the midst of my dreams....i had this stupid stomach ache...not sure if its the super spicy tom yam soup that i had on an empty stomach for lunch yest...  Not only these, i had a super BLOCKED NOSE that was blocked on both nostrils...that i could not even breathe thru em and had to do it thru mi mouth and the mucus was just not helping me at all man! So i ended up walking up and down so that i could generate some heat and feel better and be able to breathe...  That sleepless horrible nite caused me to take haf day and waste it on bed to catch some good rest...  ayes....  Wat a nite...  Miss Drowsy (with medication...)

Haa...finally they've done something like tat...Mm...let's see..they should then start doing a movie out of our Sunday Life section where all the comic strips all come to life!!!hahaha...my fav would be  "Dilbert" ...sarcastic office politics and management rules yeah!! so damn funni...not all are but if u catch one...it really tickles u man! Haa...imagine Dogbert start his stupidlogy abt management issues and how he should be treated and how brainless are the ppl...that be something to really laugh at in the movies!   Also...the local  "Life's like that" ..where all the local 'pattern' of S'porean comes to life...all the theme of jokes are pretty much real and close to our hearts.

But luckily being in a skool...u have wat students who love surfing and dun have a comp called the 'Computer Lab' hahaha....so yeah i could still reply to some stuff...

      Woah wee...today was the feet SORE-ing day haaa...cos well i went wif Boss to a few hotels to view which was more suitable for our conference to be held on Nov...  I must say that Grand Hyatt was pretty much impressive and it really caught our eye...Grand Hyatt was so GRAND...(coincidence?) the setup and decor was so beautiful....it had to be it....oh well no intentions for advertising jus in case u might wonder so haaa...Grand Copthorne was not too bad but a lil too modern and not 'season' enuff so erm...mayb not...Marina Mandarin was actually our 1st choice but then it got cast to 3rd choice after Grand kinda outshined them in the POSHness and AMBIENCE and Lightings and Feel...haaa...Regent wasn't too bad too...the lobby and stuff was great but the rooms were like Mandarin man...so ney tink might pass that...So u guys noe where to hold ya weddings or conferences! Grand Hyatt (Grand Ballroom) & Grand Copthorne (Grand Ballroom) is a HOTSPOT!   So practically spent the entire day outside like salesppl calling at diff hotels with a similar greeting: "Hello, I'm Meixin from XXX, I've made an appt with Ms XXX, is she available right now...I'd like to discuss some XXX stuff with her...(oh haaa,..not X-rated stuff lah...)"  Tho it was tiring...but haa...Boss decided we call it a day at 3:30pm!!! GOsh how wonderful hor....so yep i got home super duper early! Moi happiest and most energetic day out in the course of being the slavery of employers hahaha!! All cos my Boss is also no GOVERNMENT...how nice...but no i don't wish to have it everyday..man...See I still wana somehow be noticed as "The Good Employee" sometime..and "The Best Employer" in time to come...hahahahaha!!  Adious...Love...
