      May 31, 2004  I just thought that I would write down to tell about something new with Mercy. Lately her daddy would play with her and do the war cry on her, she loves it. Every time we would pat our hand over her mouth she would make noises. And she loves attention, I think all babies do but whenever someone would notice her, her face would shine and her eyes gets bigger and a big smile opens up. I am grateful for a happy baby. This morning after I took my shower, I was cleaning out my ears with the q tips as I always do, Mercy was crying. I checked on her and she was laughing at the q tip as I was playing with it. She is very easy to please. And so sweet. I look forward into the days of being separated from her daddy and moving on our lives without him. I just hope that I will have the courage to be away from him and to fight him off when he begs for forgiveness. I am willing to give him another chance but not living with me, he won’t have that kind of chance. Paying me child support and visiting with the kids, fine. And setting up dates like normal couple should do.  But so far I am chatting with another man whom seems to be really nice and sweet. He has a lot of good sense of humor, not to mention dirty mind!

      Today was not a good day. I had to get up early, because my husband goes to work at 8am every Tuesdays. However, it started raining later on, so the morning had started off with gloomy day.  For some stupid reason I have been in a bad mood for the last two days, not to mention my head hurts. My daughter squeals all the time and it can hit a nerve every once so often, especially when your head hurts like hell. She can piss me off without meaning to. And I always felt bad when I got mad at her for being innocent.  Well when we dropped my husband off at work, we came back home and took a nap. But it was a fitful nap and I ended up tossing and turning for three hours, having too much on my mind. I wondered, since being deaf I have to depend on the signaler that flashes whenever she cries or make noises, if it was on and working. Because I ended up wondering if I would keep sleeping and she cries so loud and hard someone would call the police and they break in my house and wake me up. I sleep naked for God’s sake! Next time I am taking a nap, I will test the damn thing to make sure it works before going to bed. Then we slept for a couple of hours, until almost 12. She did make a noise once but ignored it for a little bit then went back to sleep. When I decide it a right time to get up, I had a headache. Ian called me several times and accused me of leaving the cell phone in the car, when I was at home taking a nap. As I was on my way out to meet him for lunch, he called.  I got there and they have this place where they hire you for your opinion. They offered me five bucks. So I took it and went to McDonalds. Ian met me outside and we ate for half an hour.  He brought in the boxes he promised to save for my best friend because she only has a week left to move. Then after lunch was done, I went right over to her house and stayed there until Ian got off work at 4:30pm.  Not much changes since we got home… except I forgot to take home the Tylenol that my friend gave me. The usual starts, we ate dinner but we actually get to watch a little of tv, then he started playing his game. So here I am now, relaxing as my ass get sore. My daughter is in bed sleeping for the night. I want a glass of ice tea!!!

      My daughter is like an angel when she stops crying and eventually falls asleep. How could people just ignore the special moment with their child, complaining that they are busy, making excuses not to pay attention? Like my husband, for example, he rather spends all his time and wastes his life over a game that can last long time. Yet, this moment, with Mercy being 10 months won’t last long. He wouldn’t even notice if we were gone. I began to hate men with PS2. I am going to make sure next time I start dating, if I ever work up the courage to leave Ian, to watch out for their obsessions. If they are hooked in drugs, then it a no-no and if they are alcoholic, then there won’t be a chance. I think that I would even ask, what would they be obsess with and if they answer with even one thing, innocent enough or not, I won’t give them any reason to trust them. Then again, obsession can start anytime. They may not even have any kind of obsession now, but once they try something they like and gets hook into. That’s scary.  It makes me so sad. Look at all the wonderful things the baby can do to our lives and yet, nobody cares. Only rare do we care. Most of the times we make excuses, like myself, I will admit I make excuses sometimes.  My excuses are so lame, yet can be understandable if you’re in my shoes. It so hard to love someone, escspecially when you’re not being loved by someone so important. But I do love my daughter, it just I don’t know if I am giving her enough.  Doctors do tell me that  I am a wonderful mother, and that by the looks of her happiness and her vocal actions, they tells me how great I am taking care of her. But how do they know? How do they know I am even doing anything? What if it just because that who she is and because of other people I hang out with, she gets what she wants. My daughter loves children and animals. I am in a great hurry to move out into a fenced yard so I can get a dog and cats for her to enjoy. I can even imagine her being a proud sister to the next kid that comes in the family. Maybe she will go through the normal stages, jealousy, anger, fear, wants momma… that kind of things. But then again, all kids go through that with the new babies. Honestly, I can’t wait. And I can’t wait when it finally just me and my kids. I know I will feel lonely and wanting someone to love and take care of me, but my point is, I can’t wait to be free from this loneliness and abuses.  I know I have to leave but it isn’t that easy.  I am afraid. That how we got married in the first place. I knew if I tried to leave, he will stalk me. Call me every day, on and off work, demanding me to tell him where we are and what going on.  He did that the first time I left him. My children do not deserve to watch me being tortured. My children do not deserve to watch me hurting and then believe it the only way of life and that is normal thing for a father to do. Because God knows, I will never forgive myself if my daughter married to a man exactly like her father. God knows I will never forgive myself if I have a son that he will follow his father footstep. *sigh* we all deserve a better life.

      sometimes when nobody is listening, it seems as if you dont even exist. so why bother breathing another minute? for so long i wanted to die, but lately i dont even think about it anymore. sometimes i get really sad or depressed, still i never thought of hurting myself. i finally have someone to depend on my survival. she is only 10 months old. plus another one is on the way. still seems like nobody is listening. espeicailly my own husband. well, we have been married for only two months and i am not surprised that the saying comes true, "after marriage, everything changes." actually he got worse. and basically i am on my own with our children.  it is so much better if he wasnt around, though. so much easier to live the life we deserve without him breathing in our house. it is so useless and hard living with someone who dont care or do anything at all.  things were at least okay before we got married, not better. at least, he gets bored with the game after a while. but this kind of game he got, is like drugs. he tried it once and inhales it every moment he can get his hands on.  we have been together almost three years. the only good thing came out of all this is having a child. she is a blessing and a beauty to life. she makes me see things i never seen before.  well, now im gonna stop here and clean out my desk. it been ages since i went through the drawers. i say, at least two years now... i wish it that simple, cleaning out the drawers. and life should be that way too. negative things can be thrown away. and they needs to be thrown away before WE get screwed for the rest of our lives......

      Mercy, remember if you ever feel alone If you ever feel like nobody loves you That God is always there, looking out for you If it seems like you’re lost with nowhere to go That your bedroom is the best place, to pray  I can’t promise to be there when you need me But God will always be available It will seems like he is not answering Just look out and you will see he is talking to you All you have to do is listen and look for him Open your heart and be patient  I want to be all you need, but I can’t I am only a human We will make a lot of mistakes Only God is perfect All I want for you is safety and happiness But the world is not safe And happiness is not always possible  Just remember, my girl, that I am your momma And always will be and because of that I love you!  You are exactly what I hoped to have You have been my dream that came true The joy you carried in your face Brings all the smile to our lives Laughers we heard brings light in the darkness  I thank God everyday For the joy you bring Laughers we hear everyday And the smiles you put on our face I thank God for a happy baby So cheerful that lightens the burdens All just in one smile you had By a simple laugher for no reason Thank you, Mercy for being a happy baby!  I love you

      I wish I am brave enough to face the truth and walk away. I wish I am confident enough to bear the pain and move on. I wish I am not afraid and take the risk. I wish I could accept the reality and live. I wish none of this happened and some that will happen. I wish I remember how I survived in the darkest moment and do it again. I wish to stop making excuses and do it. I wish to do something and not worry. I wish to quit being scared and find happiness. I wish it all can start over and be forgotten of pain but remember the mistakes to avoid next time around. I wish to listen and agree with friends. The world is spinning and I am getting dizzy. Anger inside hides the pain and tries to fight it way out, giving me tears but I ignored my feelings. I am too proud to know what is wrong. I am too proud to even care. I am sorry for my little girl, knowing if I stay this way, she will suffer. But I am awfully too proud to admit that my friends are right. Someday, when I feel better, I will do the right thing for my little girl. I promise. I have been in the ugly situation before and I almost fell and couldn’t get up, but I did. Right now I need friends and support but then again, I need to be left alone.

      Help me through the night Help me through the trials Help me through the sufferings  I have been broken up I have been abandoned I have been hurt  Stumbling into the confusion Here I find myself deep in tears Where do I need to go to hide? Should I just fly away?  Now I understand the meaning of Heartbrokenness Here I feel my chest aching Heart throbbing in pain  My soul, where did it go? It left me empty and alone. Crying out, nobody hears me I feel forsaken My mother, my lover, my friends And now my baby  What good am I to her now? She is so happy, but I am sad She deserve better And because I feel like nobody How can I be a mother?  I so much want to die in heartbrokenness And let it all be as if it was natural death Nobody would have to know the difference Suicide or not…..  I owe my daughter apology Don’t ever hate me for my pain Forgive me for what I have done I am sorry if I ever hurt you, Mercy Maybe I shouldn’t have given you a life  But even if I don’t feel loved And it hard to love someone else I really do love you.

      Mercy Love Herrington-Kelly was born on July 18, 2003 at 12:50pm. The contractions started on Tuesday and I went to the hospital on Wednesday, thinking this is it.  But they let me go home saying it not time. Thursday morning I had the appointment with my doctor… and I was crying because of the contractions. She said I was in the early stage labor, but because Mercy wasn’t born yet, she sent me over to St. John for an ultra sound to measure the baby to make sure she can fit through my pelvis and birth canal.  My friend was with me, who also was my coach through the labor. She took me to St. John and waited for me while I was having the ultra sound. We found out we are having a girl that time.  But I didn’t have time to call anyone or to even email anyone the good news, because I went to stay with my friend for a while and then at almost 5pm, I wanted to go back to the hospital.  For a few hours, I stayed in the triage, having signs of labor… but it was too early… and they let me go again. My friend was going to drop me off at my house but then we decided it would be a good idea I stay over at her house because it seems that I am in labor.  Ian, the baby’s father and I went to bed at about 10:30pm. But I was tossing and turning, like the last three days before that with bad cramping (contractions). I couldn’t eat anything either.  I was exhausted and frustrated with the pain. At 2am, I gave up. I cried and cried, saying this has to be it. I told my friend to take me back to the hospital. I was doing the breathing, deep in and slowly let it out.  When I arrived at the hospital, they put me in the labor and delivery room. My contractions got stronger and closer together. When I reached to 4cm, the doctor came in with the epidural.  I didn’t want to have one because I really want to try natural. But I am so glad I had it anyway, because if it wasn’t for epidural, I would have just given up and may have ended up in the c-section.  Even with the epidural, it was really hard. I can feel the baby’s head in my pelvis. I wanted to push her out so bad but they told me it wasn’t time yet. Every once in a while I freaked out and panicked.  12:40pm, it was time to push her; I was somewhat about 9 and a half cm. With only three push and ten minutes, she popped out. But when her head was out, as I was later informed, I wasn’t supposed to push her out yet.  But I wanted her out fast. And I found out, hours later, that the doctor wouldn’t tell me at the moment that they had to get Mercy out anyway. Her head was purple, because the cord was wrapped around her neck twice.  We were lucky the cord was long, and that it only happened at that time. Before she was born, I was told her body was facing up. She was supposed to be facing down. So I was suggested before she came out to turn positions to help her turn the right place.  That could be when the cord wrapped around her neck.  But she made it. You can see her picture on the website at WWW.CoxHealth.com, and just enter July 18, 2003 and look for Mercy H.  She got daddy’s hair ( alot of it. the doctors told me she is the first that need a haircut), his eyes, his chin and his ears. She got my nose, my mouth and my chubby cheeks. The doctor told me that there is a chance of her having a down syndrome. But as soon as she told me that, I didn’t care. What does it matter if she has one or not, she is my baby and I made her for ten months. (she was born two days overdue.) And what really is matter is that she made it out alive and healthy.  I tried to breastfeed her for two days, but it was not a very easy task. Yesterday I came home at about noon. And every time she cried, I tried to feed her. But I was frustrated with her rejecting me, pushing me away and crying, squealing every time I tried to feed her.  I began to cry and finally at 9pm, I had given up. She had same dry diaper since she came home with us. I was concern and got to thinking that, I would just have to feed her formula. I don’t want her to starve and not have any dirty diaper.  It was hard, because I felt hurt and discouraged. But I did my best and I told myself that when I gave her the bottle, she was happier and knocked out.  So I just thought you all want to know. Hope you can find the picture and enjoy seeing her as much as I do. I thank God for having her. Every babies are precious.

      One night I woke up Tears in realization “What am I doing here?” All the thoughts came crashing Aches my heart more than knives could What is going on? What can I do? Where can I go?  Friendships fade, love disappeared Myself turning invisible Over a hope of a man Who would be everything I need  Nothing to compare I see in him, a blank Where our commitment? Where our attention? Where our love?  Children we share He didn’t seems to care All the love I want Goes into the children I borne  Tears, flowing down my cheeks Heart breaking as the rain falls Thoughts crashing as the thunder roar Standing in the window I watch the storms Feeling what God might be feeling  Abandonment, I turned the other way Knowing what to expect One day, tears stopped falling Smiles shone on my face Because I am free at last  I left the hopelessness, met the joy Friendships appear, love return Realization was I met a wrong man…..

      Whew. Last couple of years all blurred into one day, or so it seems. Having a child changed a lot in my life. But having a 8 months old daughter didnt seems to change my husband's very much. Up until a few weeks ago, things were rough and life was going through like a roller coaster. Ian and I went through a lot of shit, despite that we have a beautiful daugther. He accused me of things I never did. And because of that, I grew doubtful of him.  One day, I had enough of his lies and being hurt. I decided to let him to go to work, saying good-bye for the last time. I asked my friend to pick me up and drive me over to his work, and took the car and came home... I started packing and left him. Stayed with a friend for three days. In the meantime, I "cheated" on Ian. How can you cheat on someone if you already dumped him?? I reported him to child support to pay me and my daughter. But then he called me several times, threaten me and then suddenly asked me back. He missed us. He cried when I told him I cheated on him. But never in 20 months we have dated have I ever seen him cried. I like it when he did, it shows how he really feels. He begged me back.  But I asked why he would want us back, especially after that I "cheated" on him? Why take me back, after being insulted that I'm a bitch? He hated my attitude. He can't stand it when I complain.  I caught him going into prono websites. I caught his profile saying he is single and wants to meet someone in private to have "fun".  That hurts. And that gives me no reason to trust him. He wanted to take a girl from the mall where he works out to have sex. (or whatever that was on his mind)  But then he said he will change. He will do anything to have us back. He was going to surprise me on his payday to get a marriage licesne that week I left him.  About time. But why now? He always find excuses to put off the wedding. First it was bills. Then it was car.  When my friends found out we were getting married, they all told me not to. They warned me, and was not happy or supportive. They asked us to wait a couple of months before getting married.  A few days after our marriage ( oh by the way, we got married the day before my 23 birthday ) we found out we are having another child.  Now it all seems to be going alright, though I have lost a very good friend who accused me of being careless getting pregnant again and reject me because I am marrying to the "wrong" guy. But I suppose now that I am getting along with Ian better, everything will be fine.

              The heat! How can anyone stand it? I had a hard time being out on the street without thinking I was going to die. Nobody even walked to the store in that weather. It was so unbearable and I would think how lucky the people were that had cars or air conditioners. They could either stay home and enjoy a glass of iced tea or go out for a ride to the store without having to be caught in the sun. 	It was unfair. But nobody seemed to care what I thought. I would be outside working in the garden with my momma for five minutes and find myself hot and sweaty. But it was cool with me if there was a wind going. On the other hand, it was not easy for my momma. 	What could I do about it? It was my fault. Wait, I will get to the point in a minute. Let me relax and search for the right words to explain. Dr. Scone, I had a friend in the city. Her name was Sharon and we met the day after momma and I moved to the country. My whole life was in the city and I had never experienced country life. I went crazy living five miles out of town. Being new and not knowing anybody didn’t help to relax me. I never had a real friend. This one girl used to be a friend of mine but we didn’t get along anymore. 	I didn’t know how to be a friend. People would try to get to know me but I wouldn’t let them get too close with me and later on they would get the wrong impression and not bother with me. It’s kinda sad because it isn’t what I meant. I couldn’t relax and trust strangers. Only if I had a way to get in the middle of friendships. I hate the beginnings; nothing is easy after the introductions. 	Sharon and I went to the same school. She would give me a ride. One day on the way to school, I broke down. I was crying and complaining about being so far away. I told her how it would be easier to live in the city. Everything is right in town. 	Sharon agreed with me and started encouraging me to help momma find another place to live in town. 	I didn’t see the disappointment on momma’s face when I told her I hated living in the country and I wanted to go home. 	Momma didn’t argue and started looking at the ads. Within a month later, we moved. I didn’t notice how depressed momma was until it was too late. 	With all the excitement about moving, Christmas and my brother coming to visit, it all happened so fast. Momma and I didn’t start to complain about the house for the first few weeks. Then we started to miss the country, the peace and freedom. 	On the first week back to school after Christmas vacation, Sharon wasn’t anywhere to be found. All that day I couldn’t wait to tell her that we live closer to each other and now we can do a lot together. 	For three days I couldn’t find her. I was getting ready for gym when I heard girls laughing on the other side of the lockers. Sharon was in the middle of the group. 	She sat with her legs crossed, her back straight and hands neatly folded on her knee. Brushing back her long black hair over her shoulder, she continued talking. Curiosity got the best of me and I stepped in closer without being seen. 	Tears came to my eyes as I covered my mouth with my right hand. Sharon was calling me names and the girls were laughing, making fun of me. 	The real side of Sharon stunned me and I was numb. I didn’t make it to the gym or the rest of the classes. I was hiding in the bathroom stall, crying. 	I stole momma’s dream for someone that never exist. All the pain and sorrow was for nothing. Now I was really sorry and I missed momma. I had never cared about her. If only I knew. And that’s what I meant when I said it was my fault. 	Later, Sharon was alone in the bathroom, taking a hot shower. I got out of the stall and found her. When I did, I grabbed something sharp and was screaming above my lungs as I went for her. Sharon jerked around, startled and was frowning.  When she saw me, her mouth dropped open to silent scream and she put up her arms to protect herself. 	After I stabbed her, she let out a quiet moan and fell to the floor with a splat. I watched her blood blending with the water as it went down the drain. 	I stood there numb and dropped the scissor. And I cannot explain how I felt killing someone. I wasn’t relieved or happy. I wasn’t sad or hurt. I wasn’t scared or worried. I wasn’t even confused at what I did. I didn’t feel betrayed or used. I was in shock and something I never felt before- empty. 	The gym teacher followed my scream and found me kneeling next to the lifeless girl, my clothes soaking from the shower. 	Then he called the police and they took me away. 	Momma was crying when she came to visit me, along with my brother. The trail date was set and I was found guilty for second degree murder. As part of my sentence, I was sent to jail for fifteen years and I have to visit a shrink. 	And I hope they’re happy, Dr. Scone. 	But can they do something about the weather?

      Those five years were tough, having to figure out where you’re going on your own. Being married and giving birth to children were a great and interesting experience but not when it comes to the wrong guy. Being married was supposed to be special and exciting. Not to be forced or afraid into marriage.  Then again, I guess that what growing up is all about. And that what it is about being young and learning. Making mistakes as you go along the road. As the saying goes, “Go with the flow.” Even though I don’t think this have to do with anything that I am going to write about. This is my life.  It’s just something I have gone through and wants to get off my chest. Otherwise, I tend to go crazy thinking about what I have gone through and get depressed over it. I want to go back to the beginning. I was 18 years old when I moved out of my mother’s house. I didn’t exactly have a wonderful childhood. And it was a long time before I got over it. But eventually I did. I went through a lot of odd jobs that were supposed to be permenantly but I kept getting screwed up. Either I walked out or get fired for not showing up. And I met a lot of wrong guys I thought would be my boyfriend. None of them wanted to be my boyfriend, except to have sex. Unfortunately I gave them what they wanted just to feel good about myself. I guess for a while I kept on leading a wrong life, picking the wrong path. For my mental sake, I was visiting a counselor. She was a great help throughout my early adulthood. And now that I have grown up, she stopped treating me as a kid. Meanwhile I was still seeing one same man for two years until he moved away.  He was a player, big time. I liked him a lot. We had good conversations, we had fights a few times and some good and bad times… like normal couple people.  He would have been a perfect guy, if it wasn’t for being a player. Then again, he wasn’t perfect, and definitely a wrong guy. A few months after he moved away, I was really glad.  But then I wasn’t having a good life going. I see several stupid guys and working in a tough job. I finally managed to hold a job for 15 months before getting fired.  That one year, my roommate and I were seeing a lot of friends from out of town. Most of them were her friends from school, and friends of her friends. But I have to say that time was a great moment, until things fell apart from ugly rumors that were going around in another city.  Then I met my daughter’s father from the internet. We chatted for a while before meeting in person. He was going away for a camping that weekend and he wanted to meet me before I went to work that night. We met at a gas station, for safety reason. I just got out of ugly relationships, if that what it was called… and thought about being wise the next time I met a guy. And I promised myself not to get screwed over again.   I didn’t have a car and because he did, he offered me a ride. So he took me to work and then was off for the road.  We didn’t get to see each other for a week, and I forgot about him until he caught me online one night and we chatted again.  My roommate was having a long distance relationship at the time I met Thomas. So there been time she would be gone out of town for a while and there would be a time he would be in town. Just when my roommate and I was fighting and having disagreement, she decided to move out into her boyfriend’s apartment and I asked Thomas if he wanted to be my roommate. Four months after we met, I wanted to have kids and thought about asking him if he would like to have kids with me or not. I was trying to decide if I should take birth control or not and Thomas told me not to and agreed we can have a kid. But we never got married, even though he did ask me a few times. I didn’t want to get married.  I wasn’t ready. I just wanted to have kids.  Before we became pregnant, I lost my job for taking an early vacation. My friend wanted to go out of town early and I agreed into going with her. I explained to Thomas a long time ago that we were going out of town for a while.  When I came back, he wasn’t very happy about it but happy to see me.  I didn’t realize since then, our relationship has gone sour. We lost our apartment and we ended up living in the homeless shelter for six months. Right before Mercy was born, I managed a job for a month but it didn’t work out very well but fortunately out of that, we were able to get a house. And I learned one thing about Thomas is he doesn’t know how to do his budget very well and we made a deal, since having the house that I would be in charge of his paycheck and keep up with the bills.  We agreed and for over a year and an half, I kept paying the bills as much as we could afford. Mercy was born in July the following year we moved into the house.  But things got uglier since she came in our lives. I found out Thomas was very angry at me and wanted to have revenge on me for “cheating” on him, though I never did that. And he tried to hook up with several women behind my back but I caught on. We had a lot of fights and couldn’t get along anymore. February 2004, I decided we had enough and packed all we could and left him. With the tax income, Thomas bought a car and so with it, I took the car and everything I owned, except for the bigger things that doesn’t fit in the car. Three days he called me, threatening me on my cell phone and warned me with cheap craps. Meanwhile, I cheated on him because I was very angry at him and thought that would be the message to say it was over between us. But he called me once more and begged me to meet him so we could talk and asked to bring Mercy with me. But I explained to him that he cannot see Mercy until he starts paying child support. We met, and talked for a while. Then he begged me to come back home, but I told him it was over.  He cried when I explained that I slept with someone else.  Still he asked me to come home that night and have someone to watch Mercy until the next day so we can try to figure out what the problem was. “I have been under a lot of pressure. This Thursday I was gonna surprise you for getting married.” Since I wanted to go back to my house, where I really live and owned a lot of things, I didn’t argue with him and agreed to go home that night. Of course, I wished I never did that.

      A one phone call can changed a lot in our lives, either damages or the good things. Since our marriage was never uplifting, already on a thin ice, it only take a small lie to destroy everything we barely have. It was Tuesday morning when a girl called from Louisiana. She announced the possibility of my husband being the father of her son. Five long years, he knew she was pregnant but never admits the possibility. Her words were cheap, “He is not your son.” What broke my heart is not just because he has a son with someone else, but never telling me he might.  If he have known she was pregnant, why didn’t he want to take the DNA test just to make sure he is the father or not. Apparently, he doesn’t care. It doesn’t matter how long or short they dated, or how much sex they had, it only takes one to get pregnant.  But he chose to believe the child is not his, and never shared this possibility with me. We have been together for three years. If he can hide something like this, what else should I expect? He already given me no reason to trust him or to believe this is the only “secret” he have.  I tried talking to him, asking if there is anything else we need to know that might come back at us. Either he denied or just wouldn’t tell me.  That broke my heart. All year long, I believed Mercy was his only child, when he knew the girl was pregnant, maybe with his son. If I have known, it wouldn’t have bothered me. But because he never told me, it makes me wonder if he would ever tell anyone about our family after we split up. Like I said, I guess he doesn’t trust me or doesn’t love us at all. He wants to use us. I overheard him saying “She was mean, and she wouldn’t take care of me.” But yet he said they were only going out for two weeks? He is capable of taking care of himself but he doesn’t want to.

      Lord, I seek for your face But everywhere I go, I sin And you hide your face in shames Lord, I only want to make myself feel good And in all the things I do Are wrongful in your eyes  I know you are forgiving God A loving and patient But Lord, I got no love or patient I am hurting in all over the places  You have given me what I needed And what I have always wanted But Lord, I still feel sad Because I know I am not saved  You provide what I need just in the nick of time Almost when I was about to give up You always answer my calls Either when I do cry or not Oh, Lord, I want to be with you  But in everything I do Are wrongful in your eyes You protected me otherwise And stood by my side Heart aching, you walked with me Shameful, you stayed with me  Why do you love, God when so much are hurting you? I have two children now I want them to know what is right But in doing so, I have to set the example Already, they are learning Crawling, standing and feeding themselves  Help me to find my way back to you Lord, I want to be saved again Forgive me And give me what I have needed so long I want them back Your love and protection! 				- Kaytee ‘04

      Mercy is finally catching on things. Crawling, for she watches her friend, who is three months older than her. It seems to me that she likes to learn by watching and motivated to do things when she sees others doing it. She been exploring now since she realized she was capable of getting to places. It means I will have to watch out where she goes and what she gets into now.  I doubted her ability of crawling and thought she would skip the crawling stage and go right on walking. But I was shocked and excited, seeing that she was dragging her legs across the room. Then finally getting on her knees and making a few steps before falling to her stomach. It so great watching them learns. But what I wish is that her father and I share the moment together gleefully and joyfully. Thinking of the day we got pregnant with her and feeling love…. But that will never happen. Hopefully I will find someone like that later…. If not soon.

      So sad I see, world crumpling around me My friends, seems to be avoiding me What have I done? My family, I don’t know if they care  My own children, gets on my nerves I hate them sometimes But, my heart beats so hard I am so hungry My head hurt  What does it matter for the things I do? Nobody cares, I want to feel good The only friend I find comfort in with Is inhaling smokes that get me high  Ah the world seems to disappear All my problems are gone My heart beats hard, breathing short and fast The heat rises in my flesh  It feels so good God, it only last so short. I want more!! Give me more, I don’t want to live And deal with the problems that shouldn’t be mine  Anger rises, desperate for the escape I hate the world My friends are horrible, I don’t want them anymore I know they love me but I feel they are annoying.   Waste of time.   What do they want from me?  My mind, whirling till the darkness falls And my breath, coming shorter and faster I can hear my children calling me But I don’t know who they are What could they want from me?  I hear the soft voice calling,  “Momma? Are you okay?” But I can only feel her tiny hands Shaking my shoulders  Darkness closing around me Silent falls I can still feel the surrounding Sense the activities Cops, firefighters, paramedics  My children, I loved them I am so sorry What have gotten into me?  Brightness come, blinding me Where am I standing now?  I see my self laying in the hospital room   Feeling people removing tubes and needles from me  Yet I feel nothing. I could hear.    Those soft  whining voices, My kids.   I could hear  my friends who stood by me and I pushed them away.    They stayed by me   even in passing.    I never  will forget the look in their eyes  Watching   the door to my room close.    Watching my blanket covered body  moving through like slow motion .    The cold  hospital air  dancing  about my lifeless self.     I'm lifeless ....   My children cried, family huddled in the waiting room Oh, I am so sorry  							-Kaytee and Amia ‘04

      Sorrow I know you The pain that sting Every thought it brings With guilt I decide What must I do? Love I am starving Longing for attention Affection, I crave Oh, must I even try?  Danger, I fear you Chasing me into the wall Worries, I cried Running til the day I die  Choices are there Risks are everywhere My babies needs me He may even kill them Emotionally, mentally and spiritually Just like me  I only want what fair Family, is that too much to ask for? We share children They have our blood But do they have his love?  It not easy to decide If you’re not in my shoe Then you will never understand  May he never leave a mark Anywhere on my body Doesn’t mean he isn’t dangerous  Look at my heart It’s breaking, I have children My love drains me  So needy for many Only if he’d understand  I want to love him But with what? Only he gave me fear My babies, we must go On the run Away from this world  							-Kaytee ‘04

      when the darkness falls it drinks the life out of you the dreams you had, began to die with nothing left to care or to hope you're afraid to sleep knowing tomorrow will come back again starting over  you know it is forgotten for short time until the day ends and the night begins the pains opens like a book and you read all night the sorrows the pains the regrets the book opened to another page waiting to be filled with new sorrows new pains new regrets when reading is over you close the book with invisible tears and silent cries then you sleep again forgetting it in the morning until the cycle starts you can't sleep it away you can't write it away you can't live it away you can't&nbsp; get rid of it and you cannot dream another life to hide until one nightyou reached to the end and close the book with final chapter and a sigh of a good night with a bottle of pills.........

      Words are&nbsp;strange  They are on both sides  What I am trying to say You probably won’t understand Just like everyday You never know where to land All of misunderstanding and pains  I will just walk away Hoping you won’t follow me It hurts to know the right things to say Because you’re always on the flee  So I have given up hope And finally decided to leave Watching my life like soaps Shaking the faults off my sleeves  Baby, I loved you But you have hurt me I tried, really do Still inside, I bleed  Good-bye, love Don’t shed a tear I am flying like a dove Without you, I dared&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Kaytee '04

      Hearing my lover  say, “I love you” Thrills to my heart When he shares with me My world is full Secrets and lies are not known in our lives Children gleefully play around us We watched with love  Let remember the days When we said “let have a baby” And never forgot the miracles Of succeeding to bring God’s gift in the world And be proud to have children as our own  My children calls me “momma” Because they know they can count on me In their eyes, I am their world  Like God calls me His child I don’t mind calling Him a King If it means I can count on Him For everything I need  My children don’t mind calling me momma For they know they can depend on me For everything they need They come first in my life And I am the last  God comes first and I am the last For it was Him, that gave me what I want I made a lot of mistakes But He stood by and waited As my children watched and learn  It was wonderful to hear my lover say “I love you” But he didn’t care about us And left us high and dry, still in our lives I see him everyday and cry  But I never can see God and I smile Knowing He will always be there And never leave me and my children He will always say “I love you” In many different ways May I never hear it, but see is enough May I only feel in my heart and children It is enough to know God will always be there  My lover, a human with mistakes and weakness Can never complete like God God waited on him, but knows there may be no hope I waited on him, never giving up for hope But while I waited for hope I began to give up living my life Children cried and begged for momma But I feel like I don’t exist  One day, I woke up crying Knowing this may be the end Took my children in my arms Walked out of the house and never came back I never gave it another glance Got in the car and drove away Getting away from the life I was dying to And driving to the life I am living for  God calls me His child And I call Him my King My children call me momma And I call them my children  In every sense, I began to understand God’s love for all children The mistakes they make and when they fall Still God stood by and watched As I stood by watching my children  All making mistakes and they fall I waited for them to come running to me And I remember to go running to Him  My lover was only a human as we all are Nothing perfect and full of failure I couldn’t let my children see and suffer And instead, I ask them to watch and learn  All from me and I will show them the way As so did God  								-Kaytee ‘04
