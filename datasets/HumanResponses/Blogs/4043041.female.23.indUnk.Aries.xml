      met up with miumiu tdayy.. started chattin about boyys n sturff as usual over drinks.. we both have similar inclinations towards tall lean boyys, her ideal build being that of abc twnese singer+songwriter+hotbodcutiEEE  Lee Hom ; tw moosic wunderboyy  JayChou  ** drool ** happens to be me current yardstick..&nbsp;   however as irony&nbsp;would let happen, we usually&nbsp;end up more often than not with the   opposite   of what we wish for.&nbsp;in fact the&nbsp; more  fervent our desires, the  more  of&nbsp;the opposite we&nbsp;seem to&nbsp;end up with!!   surely this theory does  nOT  bod well in relation to boyys?!!  in answer to me panickie wails about endin up with the opposite of wat i look for, miumiu amidst chokin laffter shrieked " Ur gnna end up with an   SFB  !!! **giggle giggle more giggles**   &nbsp;  the term   SFB   is miumiu's clever abbreviation for&nbsp;description of me nitemare guyy type based upon&nbsp;Bald lawyer guyy Charlotte from  SexAndTheCity &nbsp; yEUCHHH  ** esp since (a) Charlotte&nbsp;iz sO gawdessly prettie&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;he is an   SFB  !!!   &nbsp;  am not gnna define abbreviations   SFB  .. itz nuthin rude tho' reckon wud be&nbsp;bit&nbsp;insensitive if u were an SFB readin this??&nbsp;i'm ashamed of me shallow self&nbsp;in bein caught up by physical&nbsp;traits and am disgusted&nbsp;by&nbsp;others who are..   society isn't forgivin, neither am i.. tho' again by the rules of irony, i'd prob fall head over heels for an   SFB   in the future but get snubbed by him&nbsp;for bein.. an   ahLian   or sumth?? kekeke ;P&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   &nbsp;

       internet connectn's surpassed itself yet again, progressin from takin&nbsp; eons  to load a page to  flat refusal  to load a page?! bAhh this is consequence of livin w/l broadband n&nbsp;not gettin lazie arze down to reformattin ailin comp..&nbsp;     when comes to dealin with errant electronic gadgets, my standard&nbsp;protocol of behaviour is much similar to that of patient mom&nbsp;sighin resignedly&nbsp;at latest kiddie pranks n mishaps, acceptin&nbsp;fact that  child is juz gnna be naughtie,&nbsp;any effort required to correct behaviour involves too darn much of an effort to bother considerin .. but surely there comes a time when tolerance threshold is crossed n u juz have to lift bumm off comfie parkin&nbsp;n  whack  the lil prankster on the head to get him to  cut it out ??!    &nbsp;    have allowed comp behaviour to get ridiculously outta hand.. to demonstrate simply, this is wat actuallie&nbsp;appears when i type noww:       bloURDÎE hEC{K u glo6in 6insane       wat dlo u th6in[k u r dlo6in clomp6in lout 2 [keys at a t6ime u p6iece lof !#&%$   ))**wHAC{K)*)*&nbsp;      (certain keys r comin out 2 at a time in case u haven't figured)    &nbsp;   laziness still prevailed afterall in me case: have adopted&nbsp;practice of patiently goin back each sentence typed to erase xtra incoherance..      "woAH this muz&nbsp;be takin&nbsp;u an aWFUL lOTTA time&nbsp;to type?!!  "     i hear u squeak..     yeahh well it sure does takes wayy longer than usual, but in me case as always,   laziness  n  procrastinatn   have yet again proven to prevail over   common sense  n&nbsp; healthy normal&nbsp;human behaviour .. &nbsp;     &nbsp;   ** laziness kills..    but if not..    juz slows n inconveniences time.. i sppoze?? **
