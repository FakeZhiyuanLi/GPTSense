      I can't wait for my vacation in Cancun next month.  I really look forward to leaving the area for a few days after this week especially.  I'd swear there was a full moon if I didn't know better.

       I'm almost 100 percent certain someone has placed a hex on my beloved home......first up...the paint is not chipping off of my house......IT'S FALLING OFF!  I have that old pressbpard siding...it shouldn't be falling off like that...only a house that I'd own would do that.  However, that's not where the curse begins...it begins last Tuesday night, when I worked a 4 hours shift at my store and came home to hear running water.  Upon investigation, I find that my water hose on my washing maching broke, spewing water for what was probably 3 hours(given the amount of water present)...it flooded my laundry room, bathroom and later I found my bedroom and basement.....lovely!(NOT)  So, I proceeded to turn the water off and tried to sop up all the water.    Oh but the fun continues....a couple of days later, I find that I have a mailbox full of mail for the church next door...I get online and find that the church also shares my street address..I call the post office who directs me to our local 911 coordinator's office...I find that, yes, through some bizarre mistake, I share the same address with the church...and that I'm going to have to CHANGE my address.  Anybody who has had to do this knows what a total PAIN this is.......  Of course, that leaves the ANTS...they love all the water in my house...they also love all the so-called "Poison" that is supposed to get rid of them....I hate ants, I hate water and I'm not too fond of our 911 system right now.

      I've worked so much lately that time has completely gotten away from me.  I was staring at the calendar this morning and thinking "hmmm, June 7....what's important about June 7?.....OH MY GOD! MY ELECTRIC BILL IS DUE!".....luckily I can pay my bill at our local drugstore.....  I'm also going to Cancun in exactly ONE month.  I need some time to go take care of a few things for the trip.  I don't like to procrastinate..I like to get things done early so I don't have to worry about things at the last minute.  However, since we're shorthanded at work.....which hopefully will be remedied this week as 2 people are starting training......  Back to the trip...I'm looking forward to it, but the 'Ol worrier in me is kicking in.....what if the plane crashes, what if I can't get into Mexico once I get there......WHAT IF I CAN'T GET OUT if I do....what if I get a horrible sunburn....what if..blah blah......I swear, I've forgotten how to enjoy anything.  But, believe me, if you had my luck...you'd worry too(ha)

      Well, it doesn't help that a few of my old classmates(Christopher Community High School Class of 1985) had kids that graduated HIGH SCHOOL this time....plus the passing of former President Ronald Reagan.....all make me feel really old.  I was mostly a kid during the Reagan administration.  I was only 13 when he was elected in 1980 and in 1984 only 17(missed that election by one month..turned 18 that December).  As far as well defined personalities...the man was a comedian and impersonator's DREAM.    I've not had much sleep as I'm writing this, so if my thoughts are somewhat disjointed, this is why........

      Well, I've threatened to do this for awhile and now I have.  I've decided to do this finally.  I'm a bit P.O.'d this evening, due to some remarks hurled at me over the weekend from people who have NO idea what they're talking about...so this could get ugly.

      ...and let her fly, I say.  It's exactly 3 weeks since I arrived back from Cancun!  It was a great trip and we had a great time...wish I had a couple of more days there, but I was ready to get back home when it was time, really.  It was quite an experience and it was strange being a stranger in a strange land.   The water there was BEAUTIFUL and the weather was similar to weather in July in Southern Illinois.  I wasn't too fond of the food, wasn't too sure as to what I was eating at times(ha)......give me steak and potatoes ANY time!  The plane trip was a new experience for me as well.  I handled it well.  Had awful seats on the trip there, but going home was wonderful!   I took some great pictures.......  I was glad to get home......AND I was glad I missed the train derailment on highway 57!  All the traffic was re-routed to end up on highway 148 which goes right by my store(business was UNBELIEVABLE!) and is just one street from my house(you couldn't get to the other side of Christopher)....things were back to normal by Saturday night when I got home.  Like I said, I've been back for 3 weeks now.......and it's back to normal(whatever that is) now.......sigh, I can't wait for Halloween.........got to get through August, the DuQuoin State Unfair and September though.........it'll be here before you can say.......BOO!
