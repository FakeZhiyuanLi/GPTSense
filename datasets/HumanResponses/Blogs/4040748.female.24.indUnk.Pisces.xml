       urlLink C'mon test yourself and see how fast you read!    This is moi   You read between 250 - 300 words per minute. Above-average reading level. (The average rate is between 200 - 250 words per minute.) It is assumed that you did not skim the words nor fail to understand the meaning of what was read.  Okay but I didn't comprehend shit... I can remember it but comprehend... not a chance.

       I was woken up with a shower of kisses and "C'mon mama, g' mornin baby". No complaints there. I followed Tookie to the kitchen and suddenly the worst thing that could have happened to me on a Saturday morning, happened. I was out of sugar! No sugar = NO COFFEE! I contemplated going to the store looking like a mad woman to get some but thought better of it since it's never really good anyway. I thought of going out to my parents but figured I'd never make it those 3.7 miles without a dose of caffeine. I open the fridge. NO Diet C0ke! Can we say spastic? Then being the inventive soul as I rummaged through the cabinets double checking for sugar, I saw hot chocolate, the lil' instant packets and the feeling of brilliance washed over me! I would mix a pack of that with some coffee and it should come out somewhat sweet, or at least enough to get me going and in the shower. Instead it came out a thick gooey stinking mess that would have been undrinkable even with sugar. And now here it is 4:14 and what am I drinking? Coffee! I had my folks bring me sugar. I swear tomorrow I will go to the grocery store.... Really... I will...

       It's finally Friday. That's the good news. And also in my favor, my supervisor comes back today, so that will mean no more running rampant between two offices trying to do two jobs! I have a yummy lunch of MORE chicken and dumplings waiting patiently in the lounge fridge. I admit I keep running in there every thirty minutes to make sure they are still there. We seem to have a starving theif in the building who sneaks in a various points of the day and eats the food others have brought. I have had a whole container of chicken salad go missing. Then I had some yummy BBQ chicken one day I was anxiously awaiting lunchtime and then I find my chicken had been nibbled, then placed back in the tinfoil just as it was... guess they didn't like my dad's BBQ skills. I have had at least four sandwiches eaten, a thing of tapioca pudding, two frozen dinners and almost every bottle of water I bring. It is to the point that I have surpassed pisstivity... And since my mom's dumplings are an all time fav I must keep close watch over them today. I just have... 7 and a half hours left until I can hop on the interstate and fly home to my Tookie. Then sweet urlLink  nothingness   all night long.

            Pluggin the family here... my lil' cousin   urlLink Prissy Chrissy   is Lil' Miss Sneads and in October she will be competing in the Lil' Miss Peanut pageant in Dothan Alabama. It's costing her poor parents every dime they can scrape together but she's worth it! Her mom, my cousin Pam, said the other day to buy a good luck ad in the program for Peanut, the black and whites are $650.00 and the colored ads are $800.00. So now would be the opportune time to get that red light to put out front announcing the opening of "Pam's Loveshack". I see no other way I'm afraid. And you know all these prissy lil' things will have several ads. I mean hell our family is small, if we ALL pitch in she may can get one B & W ad. Maybe we can put her to work washing cars on the weekends... Too much for a princess? Or perhaps we can rent out her older sister Popular Em to babysit. I do have a multi-talented family so there are many possibilities here... Any ideas from the crowd?        One more shot of my princess!              Isn't she an angel?

        I  urlLink heard  the strangest thing this morning on the radio.  It seems as though it is now illegal to buy "adult toys" anywhere in Alabama. Yet not illegal to possess them. Though I would assume it will be like head shops and you can still find your kinks in the back of certain novelty stores eh?     In other news I have come to the conclusion that my latest attempt at medicating myself is not working out as I had hoped. A little over a month ago my doc put me on Ativan. I thought whoo hoo a narcotic (yes that IS sarcasm) because I figured it would leave me so doped up and out of it that I would be unable to function. I actually was for a few days but then it was like taking a sugar pill. So last week he changes me to the time released version and I have noticed after say, four or five hours, I start getting bitchier than ever. Which is fine by me, but not those around me. I do enjoy the onset of it all though. After an hour of popping one, I am the nicest friendlist bitch you'd want to be around. I just don't understand why the hell meds loose their effect on me after a month or two. I have been through so many types of meds that I may as well be a damn lab rat for what the FDA has yet to approve seeing as how I have tried everything the local pharmacy has to offer. I am seriously thinking of trying some of that herbal crap and seeing how if effects me.     At any rate I am trying to be a nice lil' bitch today. I am sitting here at my desk ignoring everyone with my head phones on listening to *blushes* Ashlee Simpson. Hell if I know why. I have an obsession with her song 'Pieces of Me'. That and 'One Thing' by Finger Eleven. I have issues... deep issues.

        Being A Bitch    When I stand up for my beliefs,   they call me a Bitch.   When I stand up for those I love,   they call me a Bitch.   When I speak my mind, think my   own thoughts, Or do things my   own way, they call me a Bitch.    Being a Bitch entails raising   my children to be strong people   who have a solid sense of personal   & social responsibility, who   are not afraid to stand up for   what they believe in & who   love & respect themselves for   the beautiful beings that they are.    Being a Bitch means that I am free to be   who I am, with all my own utricles,   contradictions, quirks & beauty.   It also means I won't compromise   what's in my heart.   It means I live my life MY way.   It means I won't let anyone step on me.    I am proud to be a Bitch!   It means I have the courage & strength   to allow myself to be who I truly am   & won't become anyone else's idea of   what they think I should be.   I'm outspoken, opinionated, & determined.   I want what I want & there is   nothing wrong with that!   If that makes me a Bitch, So be it!   I embrace the title & am proud to bear it.    I didn't write that. It was sent to me thru email.   So, don't be a bitch &amp; sue me. :)

       That is howbored I am!And I still have 4 hours til I can head home. Damn. I did eat a yummy lunch, chicken and dumplings (my mom made) and fresh field peas (she made those too). So I am noseying around other blogs. I found two that I love, so I swiped the buttons for anyone interested. I have so got to get my ass together on the whole blogroll thingy. Anyho... I also need to do the little nine layers thingy... *sighs* so much to do. Ok. Work first. Then play. Ah hell. scratch and reverse that.       urlLink       urlLink

        I am so sick of dieting. I am ill. I am cranky. I think I know every damn thing, well actually I do, but that is not the issue here. At least my week is half over thank the gods. I think I may actually be left alone today. What a novelty. This morning I had the best send off from Tookie yet. I take him to my mom's every morning before heading off here to my hell hole. Well today he was out on their front porch to tell me bye as usual and he decided to walk me to the car. What a lil' gentleman he is now! Then he opened the door for me, gave me several slobbery kisses and a hug or two, then shut my door only to reach up for one more sloppy kiss. Ah... I am so enjoying this stage. And who ever said the two's were so terrible?

       Okay I am a snaggin, siggy loving thief, I will admit that. And several months ago I somehow went to the wrong link and my eyes first rested upon a "BLOG". Well I was fascinated... and next thing I knew hours had passed, and I had several blogs bookmarked in no time! I became obsessed with reading them (yes more obsessed than with pitas). And then the final straw was   urlLink project-blog  , so now here I am, the proud, yet shy and unsure southern bitch, attempting a go at her first blog! And now you know the rest of the story!

         My mom is so un-momlike sometimes! She was here in the city where I work today and she just up and calls for me to have lunch with her! Big woot! So she swung by and rescued me from the hell that has now become my job and we went to Schlotzsky's Deli! I wasn't in the sandwich mood due to the fact I am currently healing from my pita fetish. So I had a double cheese and pepperoni pizza. And now I face the undaunting task of more work. Pah!

        I am... I am too young to be this stressed out. I'm 24 for gods sake. I work, I go home, I play with Tookie, bath him feed him and myself on occasion, we go to bed, wake up do it all over again. It wouldn't be so horrid if right now I wasn't attempting unsuccessfully to do two jobs here at work, but unfortunately for moi, I have no choice in that either. So congratulations to me! I'm bitching once again *applause from the audience* And it's only Tuesday to make matters worse. And do I have anything to look forward to? Hell no. Oh well if you want to take into account that I get to see Cher with my boy chica in September but big woot that is since it's two frickin months away! I need some excitement in my life damnit! Ah hell... back to work... the bitchin will continue...

Big woot! Still since my boss is out on vacation, there is no harm in leaving a tad bit early right? Right!     I have this huge fountain outside my big purtee office window and I swear, one look and I'm galloping to the bathroom. Well I suppose all the coffee I ingest daily could play a small role. I am bored here... I could go find some me me's to post, and alas I don't yet have a huge following to answer goodies and questions asked to me yet. But if someone, anyone out there wants to know something leave it in the comments and I'll gladly respond to it. No holds barred! Ask away! I'll answer anything...

I had happily planned to sit here and type my lil' heart out telling ya'll all the goodies of being the bitch that I am but nooo.... Mr. Whiney Ass over there can't shut up long enough for me to remember what the hell I was doing! Tomorrow is another day.       ~What does not destroy me, makes me bitchier~

       A Southerner is having his breakfast of coffee, grits, biscuits and jam,   when a Northerner, chewing obnoxiously on bubble gum, sits down next to   him.     The Southerner ignores the Northerner who, nevertheless, starts a   conversation.   Northerner: "When you Southern people eat bread, do you eat the whole   slice?"   Southerner: "Yep."   Northerner: (After blowing a huge bubble) "We don't. Up North, we only   eat what's inside. The crusts we collect in a container, recycle it,   then transform them into biscuits and send them to the South."   The Northerner has a smirk on his face. The Southerner listens in   silence. The Northerner persists: "Do you eat jam with biscuits?"   Southerner: "Yep."    Northerner: (Cracking and smacking his gum between his teeth and   chuckling) "We don't. Up North, after we eat fruit for breakfast, we put   all the peels, seeds, and leftovers in containers, recycle them,   transform them into jam, and then send it down South."   Then the Southerner asks, "Y'all have sex up North?"   Northerner: "Why, of course, we do." He pops another big bubble.   Southerner: "And what do y'all do with the condoms once ya use'em?   Northerner: "We throw them away, of course."   Southerner: "We don't. Down South, we put 'em in a jar, melt 'em down   into bubble gum, and sell 'em to Yankees."

       Get this.. So birdlady, who lives next door, says her house is haunted. I have known this for a while. I have never personally encountered the ghost.. Don't necessarily want to. Its a little old lady that lived yhere for the last 6 months or so of her life. She died here. Nothing major.     well, I stayed the night last night.. just cause I wanted to avoid the 2am "wake up call" telling me to get my ass over there and sleep there. anyways, so at like 1:30am.. I was laying on her brothers bed.. and, I was just looking at the 2 mirrors in the bedroom.. and I felt this.. I don't know HOW to explain it.. but, it was like an evil presence. and, it was just weird. I stayed the night the night before last, and I didn't feel anything in there...    so, I woke up this morning. and I told her that I felt that something BAD was going to happen, not necessarily with her or I, but just something really REALLY bad was going to happen. She told me that she felt the same way too. I told her that room I slept in.. theres something evil in there. but it wasn't that it was JUST the room... More like the whole upstairs.     Her brother and his daughter have been staying there for a while now and it just... It just hit me all of a sudden. It's her niece. SHE is the one that has brought the evil in. And its freaky. So anyway I said a quick prayer, grabbed Tookie and hauled ass across the yard to the house.        this stuff.. is getting just too heavy. I know I'm not hearing things, I know I'm not making these "feelings" up...

And I got a call on sat.. telling me that I now have brother # 2. They got another dog!! She wanted me 2 go over on sat. but.. yeah.. Wasn't a good day.. lol but, I'm gonna go see him on Friday!! They are sticking him w/the name the pound gave him.. malcom.. Reminds me of malcom x. According to my mom he is house broken.. house trained. Whatever. He responds to NO. AND he does NOT pee/poop inside the house. The dogs are getting along fine.. He is a jumper.. not a barker.. and instead of 2 dogs &amp; 2 humans on their bed.. he first discovered the "friend" (which was buddy's carrying case thing..) 1st night he slept in the friend.. (went in all by himself) 2nd night buddy must have been jealous lol cause he slept in there.. and the 3rd night.. he found this cedar chest thing @ the end of their bed.. been sleeping on that.. so my mom made him a little pillow/dog bed type thing..

       I don't know if I should laugh or feel pity for this poor man. This was in an advice coloumn I read recently...     I am writing to you for help with my problem. My wife has custody of our seven children. They were awarded to her when she divorced me for desertion.    My mother has been confined to a mental institution of insanity since I was three years old.I have two brothers. One works for my company and the other is now awaiting electrocution for murder. My two sisters are prostitutes and my father is in the rackets selling narcotics. Recently I met a girl who has been released from prison where she served time for smothering illegitimate child. I love this girl very much and want to marry her. My problem is this, should I tell her about my brother who works for my company?    Very truly yours,    "Worried"

       My friend just told me that he's going to Texas, then being shipped to Iraq.. For at LEAST a year. And he's leaving in a few weeks. I told him no, that I wasn't allowing him to go... But, obviously, that doesn't mean a damn thing.. A year. A year in Iraq. A year in Iraq w/all that SAND. Stupid ($*$_)#@(%* war. STUPID WAR. Taking away my friend.. He had BETTER come home in 1 piece.. If not.. Someone will feel the wrath of Rin. This is bullshit. Why does he have to go? He has a baby girl (she's a little over 6 months old).. God, STUPID STUPID WAR!

       Alright.. Can someone PLEASE tell me how to CORRECTLY put tin foil on my window? (not the window that opens up.. But the OTHER 1/2 of the window..). I just threw some up on my bedroom windows.. You know. I get the early morning sun in my bedrooms & the evening sun in my livingroom/kitchen windows.. But, I had no problem putting it on the part that opens up.. But when I put it on the other 1/2, and opened up the window. LOL OOPS!!!! My tin foil got ripped to shreds!!! And.. Does anyone know the best colors to put up.. I mean.. For shears. Cause, IM going to put them up in my kitchen &amp; lebensraum windows.. Just so I can open my drapes w/o my neighbors peeping in.. I'm thinking of putting up a few layers. But, at target.. They have from white, to a pretty maroon color.. Just trying to think of the best colors... I officially look like poe white trash. hehe

Bonnie will be here tomorrow and there shouldn't be much to her. But Charlie is expected to become a hurricane. My only hopes for him is that he waits until Monday or later to arrive so that I can get a day off of work. It wouldn't be as enjoyable if he makes his entrance over the weekend. If given the opportunity to have a day off I won't be spending it as lazily as hoped. I need to get my ass set on this wedding drama. So far it's a triple tie. I could rent out this boat that goes on six hours cruises in the Gulf of Mexico and have my wedding on it, at sunset. That's romantic right? And they provide a band and a seafood buffet. Plus an open bar! My next choice is to fly to   urlLink Hawaii   and get hitched under a waterfall in one of those caves. I am loving that idea. Or my last choice is to get married like a princess at   urlLink Disneyworld   in Orlando. If I'm not mistaken you can get married in the castle there. Or in front of it. Something like that. Decisions decisions.. .

       Tookie has been having issues at night. He rubs his nose red and wants to pick it and then starts demanding I put saline in his eyes cause they   huwt.   So yesterday my mom took him to the Dr. for me and come to find out he has a sort of stationary sinus infection. It has been sitting there for a while just annoying the hell out of Tookie. His breathing was fine, no runny nose or anything. So he gets some yummy medicine and in a few days he will be able to go around sniffing people farts again (yes he does this). So last night at around 1:30 I am lulled from my darvocet induced sleep (the toothache) to the sound of a child hollering   HELP HELP.   I get myself together enough to realize it is not Tookie, who by this time was in my bed snoring peacefully. I pull myself up and manage to open both eyes only to realize there is no child outside yelling help. It is the strange sporadic noise coming from Tookie's nose. With my heart then thumping in my chest, adrenaline rushing through my body (I was prepared to save a small child here), and my eyes wide open, I laid back down and stared at the clock until 4:21. Nine damn minutes until my alarm was to go off. What a bitch.    Then despite how I love nursing on the darvocets, I am trying to find a dentist who speaks English and is accepting new patients. And apparently there are NONE in North Florida who are doing either. Anyone have a pair of pliers I can use?

       And so it has come time for the infamous dive of insanity. To take on yet another responsibility, to forever wane my exsistence with another and to share my bed with a fourth person (if Tookie and Speedy will allow it). I am getting hitched. Amou and I have decided enough blah blah, we need to to do do. So April 23rd 2005 I will be a Mrs. Whoo hoo! That is all fine and good. What is not fine and good is I want to get married under a waterfall in Hawaii or out on a yacht in the gulf at sunset, then you know, cruise around for a few hours and go home. But suddenly my mother has started telling people and now my 12 people have turned to 37 in less than 24 hours. I don't even want to venture what the list will be in a month. Then she doesn't want me to move off and leave cause she won't be able to see Tookie and what got me and hurt me was last night. She calls to tell me that if I have more children she won't love them. At least not like she does Tookie. That down right pissed me off and hurt me to the core. Hell I could move and go to fuckin' Antartica and not a damn soul would care. But if Tookie moves 5 miles all hell breaks loose. I swear I quit exsisting when he popped out. I did. Vegas is looking better and better. Then we can come back and have a nice reception for our family and friends! Yep... Viva Las Vegas. Sparkle and Shine...

       So yea my perfect weekend shot to hell all. fucking. ready. I get home, throw open my mailbox and inside is a lone letter. No not from Amou, from Tookie's Dad Methman. I nearly fell into the road but due to the fact of an oncoming car I merely grabbed for the hedges instead. I am pissed. Not happy. There is no word or description for how I feel right this moment. That is all.

       urlLink      Appetizer   Who are 3 actors/actresses that you think are totally overrated?   1. Julia Roberts is a good actress but she earns $20m every movie but only a few of them are worth watching. She is a pretty woman but certainly not America's Sweetheart.   2. Lindsay Lohan. Until she plays a role that isn't a bubbly teenage girl in movies made for bubbly teenage girls, I'm not impressed.   3. Gwyneth Paltrow is famous because of Brad Pitt and nepotism. Simply an actress of very little talent and excellent connections.    Soup   Admit something. Anything.   I'm suffering through a rough spot of depression right now yet no one has noticed.    Salad   If you could take back one thing you've said in your life, what would it be?   Just one? Damn. I guess telling this one person I hoped they suffered a miserable life. Cause well now they are!     Main Course   What symbol would best represent your personality?   The Celtic Spiral knot. It represents the increase for strength and courage. Both of which I lack but strive for more of.        Dessert   Choose a free gift: a daily back massage, dinner at a restaurant twice per week, or a brand new book twice per month.   Oh hell no contest. A daily back massage!

       No clue why but this memory came back to me. See I use to work for this non-profit agency where my job was to go out with individuals who were mentally handicapped. Take the eat, shop etc. However I had this one lady, named Jeanette, who was pretty bedridden. She was kind of a big lady, and I weigh all of 121 lbs. Since she was so sick, there were days when moving her was kind of like trying to move a walrus. So one day, she really had to get up (bathroom call) and I was actually up on the bed with her, with my knees on each side of hers, (kinda straddled over her knees) and as we struggled to get her sitting up, we looked at each other, and suddenly realized how ridiculous we looked. She started to laugh, and I said "If anyone walked in here right now, you KNOW what they'd think, eh?"And she said "IMAGINE! AT MY AGE! If people suddenly thought I'd turned LESBIAN." Well I started to howl with laughter, because she was married for like 57 years, and she was a church lady to boot. I didn't even think she'd know the word "lesbian"! Then she got real serious and she said to me, "You know though, had I known that I'd spend the last ten years of my life sick and alone (widowed), and cared for ONLY BY WOMEN like you, I would have paid MUCH MORE ATTENTION to my women friends!" I've never forgotten that. Because, ladies, it is a sad fact of life, that men die a good 10 or 15 years before we do, usually.    So, moral of the story?   Maybe we should work a little harder at female friendship, instead of female competition. 'Cus in the end, more often than not, it's only women who take care of us! The only man at the end of our life, will pop in with his stethoscope for 5 minutes at most, and wander off writing on his stupid little clipboard, too busy to CARE about us!

       It's at a Pennsylvania pub that serves the   urlLink world's biggest burger   - weighing in at NINE lip-smacking pounds! That's no whopper - you can actually get this meat monster for $23.95, loaded with all the "fixins"...    Two whole tomatoes    A half-head of lettuce    12 slices of American cheese    A full cup of peppers    Two entire onions    Plus, a river of mayonnaise, ketchup, and mustard.    Denny's Beer Barrel Pub is renown for its 6 lb. burgers.  National and   local newspapers have reviewed the burger and its main appeal seems to   be... NO ONE HAS FINISHED IT!! Huh... I bet my fat ass could!     Check this out! GAwd!     Oh Hell yea! I could do it!

I call to make an emergency appointment and the chicky on the other end, who could barely speak english told me "sawy we no have time for you to come in soon". Well lady I think I have an infection in my gums and I'm in excruciating pain here. "Sawy we see you Otubur tweny neent a twee tank you" click... can we say pissed?

       this is not. I just learned that a co-worker passed away last night at the hospital. His name was Chuck. He was always so quite but damn smart too! He worked in our computer systems dept. and I relied heavily on him many many times! He called yesterday morning telling his supervisor that he wasn't feeling well and was going to rest and would be here today. Then he called his supervisor who was also his best friend, George to tell him he thought he would head to the ER, this was about five yesterday. George said to let him know if he needed him. By nine he had heard nothing so he went to the ER and was told Chuck had passed on. He was only 32! 32 years old. I know I may not have known him well but he was such a kind person to everyone. And he never got irritated at me and my dumb computer illiteracy issues. He will be greatly missed by everyone here...      IN MEMORY OF CHARLES LEECH

       I'm fat. There I said it. So did Tookie. Last night I was pondering over what to wear today and as I made an honest effort to squeeze myself into a pair of pants I plopped back on the bed and just covered my face in utter humilation and shame. Tookie runs in to ask "What da matta mommy" in which my reply was   I am fat and ugly sweetie  . He in turn found that to be the most humorous thing I have said to him in his two and a half years. He runs to tell Speedy that his mommy is fat and ugly!   Lovely.   I call my mother to whine and she too finds it funny, not as funny as Tookie did yet still funny. And here I sit in a dress that use to be too big for me yet now fits too comfortably if you know what I mean. I just need motivation here and I have none! NONE! I weigh now what I did the day Tookie was born. Seriously. 146 lbs. When he was six weeks old. I weighed 121. How is that fair? It's not damnit. It's not! I have a weakness when it comes to food. I can't help myself. It's not even a sweet fetish, just food in general. Good warm, comforting food. I really do try to follow the whole Weight Watchers® thing but I get side tracked by yummy temptations. Gawd I'm pathetic and fat and ugly! I need a lasagna.

       I was thinking that maybe I will start posting a few of my yummy gourmet delights once a week. I actually am a great cook it's just that I don't do much of it anymore since it's just me and Tookie. No sense in wasting. Though Tookie can eat his weight he is a finicky eater. Lately I have been on a Mexican kick. Experimenting with new dishes and ideas. One because I love Mexican food and two because it's so damn quick and easy to prepare. So without further ado, I present to you (hey that rhymes!) my latest attempt at something new.    Chicken Enchilada Casserole   Oh Yum, this is SO good and no way around it - this is PURE comfort food! *lol* I do not use the pimento and I use fresh cilantro instead of the parsley - but use whatever you are comfortable with!    4 chicken breasts, poached and diced   1 can (4 ounces) chopped green chilies   1 medium onion, chopped   2 cloves garlic, chopped   1/4 cup chopped Italian or curly-leaf parsley   1 jar (2 ounces) chopped pimento   2 cups shredded fat free Jack or Cheddar cheese   8 flour tortillas   1 can (10.75 ounces) lower fat cream of chicken soup mixed   1/2 cup skim milk    Preheat oven to 350 º. In a large bowl, combine the chicken with the chilies, onion, garlic, parsley, pimento and 1 1/2 cups of the cheese. Divide the chicken mixture among the 8 tortillas. Roll tortillas and place seam-side down in a 9- by 13-inch pan. Spread soup mixture over roll-ups and top with the remaining cheese. Bake 30 minutes.    Makes 8 servings.

       Swiped this over at   urlLink Bitchalicious   a sec ago...    Of everything in your wardrobe what do you feel the most comfortable wearing? Why?   Ahh... my pair of Nautica lounge pants. I will be buried in those things! They are so damn soft and cool. Perfect in summer or winter. How could you NOT love that?    How would you describe your style?   Eh. comfy mostly but I have to look nice at work. If I could I would just live in an old tank top and my Nautica pants...     How many pairs of shoes do you own and do you wear them all?   Ah... um 5 pair of heels. One pair of tennis shoes. Three pairs of flip flops. Two pair of boots. So what's that 11? Yea... 11    Where do you buy most of your clothes?   Goody's, TJ Maxx, Bealls outlets, whatever is cheap and on sale.    What was the last piece of clothing you bought?   Hell I can't think back that far!

       I had the great epiphany last night. I am moving. I am. It has come time once again for me to go. I have lived in N. Florida all my pitiful life and I am tired of my surroundings. So by the first week of January I shall be easing my way further south of here. I am scared as hell but I need to do it. Not only for me, but for Tookie also. He needs a more stable and humbling enviroment as well as a father figure. With that said we will be meeting up with Amou somewhere. Wherever he can transfer to actually. Right now he is in Miami and there ain't a chance in hell I would or could live there. I am a small town girl so wherever we go we must live on the outskirts. Our choices are Jacksonville or Orlando right now. So we have a great deal of discussing and research ahead of us. But what I do know is we went ahead and decided to take the big plunge. Yes I am talking about marriage here. Maybe in May. I don't want to be a typical June bride. So we'll have to see on that as well. I could hardly sleep last night for thinking of so many things I will need to do before December. A huge yard sale is a must. On a sadder note I think I like to gave my poor mom the big one this morning when I was telling her all about it. But I hope she will be able to come to terms with it sooner instead of later. I promised her we would come see her once a month and we will. I do have family I would like to stay in contact with so that's a given. Now I'm off to look at job opps and houses etc. Toodles.

          Eh it's a tad late for brunch but I'm always hungry so here ya go.    Amusement Parks    1. Which amusement park is your favorite?   I'm not a far off travler so that would be Busch Gardens in Tampa .   2. Are you the kind of person who loves to go on most rides or just a select few?   As long as it doesn't stop upside down, I'm on it.    3. What is the scariest ride you've ever been on?   Nothing now, but when I was four my mom tricked me into getting on this submarine ride at Disneyworld and I freaked out. I guess I thought we were going to drown. Nothing scares me now tho.    4. Do you prefer rollercoasters, water rides or the kind that go round and round?   Rollercoasters are my all time favorite ride.    5. What is the longest amount of time you would stand in line to get on a ride?   Depends on what it is and the hype around it. I know I did stand for near an hour for Kumba at Busch Gardens, three times in a row!
