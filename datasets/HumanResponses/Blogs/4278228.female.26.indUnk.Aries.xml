      It's the first day of school! It's bittersweet, it's fun seeing Jeffrey grow up but I can't believe he's a FIFTH GRADER!!!  I made him biscuits and gravy, his fave. I was not totally happy with the gravy but it was passable.  Last night Susan said goodnight to me FOUR TIMES!!!!! I was about ready to **SNAP**, it gets soo unnearving to say goodnight to her and turn around and THERE SHE IS!!!! Not just once, but again and again! AArrgh.  She even turned off the computer that I had just turned on because I left the room and she couldn't remember if she had turned it off or no. I had been in the room for half an hour before I turned it on. She had sat IN FRONT OF IT for all that time (while I used the other puter).    I had started the all out bed chant in my head (go to bed, go to bed, go to bed bed bed!!!)  and was five minutes and one more goodbye from hauling out to smoke when she finally DID go to bed.   Bowling was fun, our league did well. Then Nat and Dawn and Caleb and I played a game of euchre, C and I winning (and then goofy me not remembering that FIVE minutes later. Oye!). We are playing again tonight and Tuesday is P*O*K*E*R  the most wonderful night of the week.  Jeffery is all ready for school and it's SEVEN!!! I am SOOO proud of him, he so kicks ass, there are still 45 mins till the bus comes! Here's to an awesome school year!!!!  SMOOCHES BUBBY!!! I LOVE YOU!!

      Happy Sunday Earthlings!!!  A bright sunny day looks at me through the window. I am having  little urges to go ahead and go out to smoke. They havn't won yet, there is plenty of time in the day left to smoke.   Yesterday was full.  Worked in the morning helping Donna clean her old house to ready it for sale, then went home and helped paint a bit, then was lazy for a long time.  Judah stopped by and we hung out for awhile and started a campfire.  He and I went over to Dawn and Nats and Will and his boys were over there, we hung out over there and played poker.   The boys were definatly being boys,  I wonder if they know just how much it bothers me when they deal harshly with the boys. I doubt it.  I always end up walking away with a nasty feeling.  Like I love them, but I continually end up of a night deciding how badly I want to see them. Whether it is worth being upset if a situaiton comes up where the kids are hurt or threatened by thier adults.  I wish I could talk to them and know they were openly listening. But no, they LIKE being able to go with their misguided instincts because they get a twisted satisfaction in smacking the children they love so dearly.  I don't understand it at all.    Not like they are LOOKING for that satisfaction, but they feel the punishments need to get increasingly worse so they KNOW the boys know they mean BUSINESS!!!! Well from the boy's behavior apparently IT ISN'T WORKING!!!!   Here's how the hypocritical parenting dance goes, Kid upsets parent, parent reacts, deals with the kid (often in a way that inflicts pain on the child).  Kid becomes upset in day to day life (with sibs, friends) kid reacts in the way they have seen/felt their parent reacting to them, kid deals with those frusterating them physically.     The parents are trying to teach a child NOT to do something by doing it to THEM.      Children are never going to be perfect angels, no matter what parenting methods are used. They are going to scream and cry, they are going to break the rules. They are going to smart off and be little brats at times.  ALL children will do this.  Beating them, whaleing on them, taking a belt to their ass, and hitting them will do nothing to correct these ordinary child (hell PEOPLE) behaviors. They just provide a release for the frusteration in the parent that the child causes and teaches the child when somone frusterates me or pisses me off to react in a physical way, often resulting in pain and harm for the object of the frusteration. It's a nasty cycle, because then the parent will deal with that indescrection with physical violence and the lesson is reinforced for the child.  You deal with people who are pissing you off by being forceful and physical with them.   All spanking teaches a child is that if they piss off Mom or Dad, Mom and Dad will hurt them.      Which is why I will never spank.  There are a world of other ways to let children know they have displeased you without hitting them.

      The gray has dominated the day, it's been wet and cold and chilly since I woke up. The drywallers had been making quite the racket the past couple days and Jeffrey and I went to the chinese buffett for lunch for the last day of school and to get away from the chaos, it was good. There was a hottie sitting by himself on the other side of the booth. Yuuumy ;) Then we went to the library. I got several books on poker and one about the history of playing cards and some movies and DVD's, one that I have been wanting to see called Devil's Playground. It's more a documentary of Amish youth in their wild time. There is a reality show made by the same person called Amish in the City, I havn't seen it yet but the documentary looked interesting.

      Hello Earthlings,  My happy little green blog has taken right off:)   It's a gray and wet morning here in the Hoosierlands.  Wet, wet wet.  I need to go and buy my cancer sticks. I am trying to quit, but not today. Tomorrow looks good. Next week looks even better.   The fire last night was lovely, older brother said he was coming back, but never made it.  I didn't expect to see him again really.  He used going to see his buddy that he's working for as why he needed to go, but I know where he ended up.  Last night he was bitching about having to be in the "re-educaiton" classes he's required to take because of his DUI. Said he didn't do anything wrong.  Ooookay.  Last week he said he recognised that he had made a mistake and the fact that he was there was his fault. Now he's flip-flopped. He'll probably be back to "it's my own damn fault" in a week or two.   I did make him think about being punitive though!!!! Wohooo!!!  He was bitching about how he has to go to the classes for 12 weeks + when he learned everything they had to teach in the first three weeks.   I said that that was because the government thinks like a punitive parent wanting to make the punishment as painful as possible in the hopes it would stick in their memory and they wouldn't mess up again. Problem is I told him, it doesn't work. From the look on his face he seemed to understand what I was saying.   Must go, Dad needs the puter.

      Time is rollin on, I had some lovely marshmallows over a gorgeous fire. My older brother J came out and sat by the fire for a bit and he and I actually conversed!!!  Usually I can't get a word in edgewise, but I had pleanty of chances to talk and he was actually listening to what I said.  I missed seeing the moon tonight, it had already set by the time I looked for it.  It's almost done waning I believe, about to be new, or the new moon has just passed and it's just started waxing. I'm not totally sure but I think it's the first.    I have been thinking alot lately about what a shame it is that people arn't allowed to farm hemp. It's been such an American tradition that you would think there would be people wanting to preserve that part of our history. As it is we have cops in helicopters looking for the plants in the wild and those people have sowed to destroy them.  And we wonder where the destruction of America is coming from, it's coming insidiously, from the inside.   I'm writing later on hemp and how un-American it is for it to be prohibited, but not tonight, too much thinking for this time of day!!   I thank thee Goddess for this night, And for the blessings of the day, Bless all who reside within my heart, Shine upon them each day, I thank thee for thy loving, and for thy guidance true And may the light that shines through me Always be from you. As I will it so it shall be. Bright Blessings Earthlings

      The smell of a good campfire is intoxicating. And no I'm not on drugs right now;)  The weather has been cool, but that just makes the fire nicer. I've hopped in to check the boards ( urlLink www.theparentperspective.com ) and to get marshmallows. I am arguing with myself whether I need the grahams and hershey bars too.... too yummy.  A WWYD I started earlier on the board EXPLODED to over a hunderd posts, blew me away! I didn't expect some of the responses I initially got.  I love that place.    I'm out to the fire now. I might hop in and add to this yet tonight. I might just play poker though too.  Ya never know :)  Bright Blessings to all Earthlings

      How cool is this shit? Alright, first I am Tad, but you can call me Tadpole for short. I am twenty-six, female and I live smack dab in the middle of the hoosierlands (cental Indiana for those unfamilier with the term). I enjoy outdoor activities, camping, hiking, canoeing, sitting around campfires and enjoying the beauty of Nature.I also am an avid reader. I just read Stephan Kings Dark Tower VI, Song of Susannah and SK From A Buick 8. Buick 8 was good but SOS was OUTSTANDING. I am both dreading and eagerly anticipating DT VII. I don't want to see my friends die, but I want to know what happens at the Dark Tower. I don't expect to see Roland make it, but I'm sure Jake at the very least will. Right at this moment I am reading Black House (also by SK), Wizards First Rule (Terry Goodkind) and Letters in the Attic (Bonnie Shimko). I will finish the last book today, it's a young adult novel and I tear through those like a PMSy woman tears through chocolate!!!My best friends are my younger brother J, my cousins who are like brothers N and C, and N's SO D. We (D, N, C, myself and others) play poker (texas hold'em) and euchre and watch poker and talk about poker, right now we are all. I am pagan, I call myself a flaming pagan due to the Celtic pentecle tattoo I have. I also have rune tattoo's and a dragon and a leaf (a very pretty leaf ;) as well. I wear my beliefs like a billboard! I have found (seriously here) that it is a very efficient way to weed out the people who are not cool with my beliefs. I personally respect all beliefs, but I have found few respect mine. I am not wasting my time in this life with people who have no respect for my beliefs, or for me because I hold them. Hopefully this will get me started on a daily writing habit. When "my" boards are dead or I've exausted the new posts (  urlLink www.theparentperspective.com , it ROCKS!!!!, I am greenfrog there BTW) I can come here and write.
