						   Yesterday was awesome. My mum, Parima, Jessica, Nicholas, Vic n myself, we headed down to Cineleisure to watch Shrek 2. The movie was fantastic.. it was so funny and de-stressing. We all enjoyed it.  There was this ReaLLy fat guy sitting beside vic, n he kept making fun of him, saying "there's an ogre sitting beside me, anyone got any happily ever after potion for him?" Poor fellow..  After the movie, we all went to Ramen for dinner. The food there was great, n the time we had there was even better. We were laughing and gossiping. It was one of those moments, where everybody's at ease, n u don't want the night to end. That made the day awesome..   Today though, was entirely different. Went to the dreaded dentist after work, together with my mum n dad. He did e usual, then commented that i wld have to floss everyday without fail.. hrmph!  on a positive note, the nightmare's over..

						   I just turned 23 yesterz! Vic was so sweet.. on the 19th, sat, we went out. i had to go for threading, n he followed. As we were laeving, we met hazel, aunty cecilia n nicole.. so we sat with them for awhile.   Afterwards, Vic brought me for lunch at this really excellent place called Nooch. Its a noodle house, n its at City Hall. The food was fantastic n so was the service there. Vic's Unagi tasted heavenly..   Then we went home. Vic told me that i had to get ready by 11 the next day, cos he was bringing me to the beach. i was really excited.  So yesterz, i got ready by 11. Met vic, n all of a sudden, we're not going to the beach anymore.. (?) i was really curious as to wat he was planning. We went to Compass Point, n he was pampering me all e way.. hehe..  Then we left to go back to my place n .. i had a real surprise there.. jess, my grandparents n everybody else were there! n they popped this loud popping thing when i entered.. ahhhh...  it was a blast! We played lotsa games. N in the evening, parima, jess, vic n myself, we headed to the mall to get me some shoes. But i'm famously known for being ultra picky, therefore mission was unaccomplished. But we had dessert there, n that was just fine n dandy.  Hazel's family came in the evening, n they brought Nike along. Was funny, watching Misty n Nike together.. hurhur.. They looked really cute. Everybody left by 12 am..  Verdict: The party was fantastic, the food rocked big time n i was the happiest 23 yr old female in the world yesterz.. i'm one really lucky girl, n i'm glad i got to spend my day with the people who are closest to my heart.. i wouldn't want it any other way..

IT WAS HELL.. she'z so tiny, but her hands are like rocks!! By the time she was done, i had FIVE soggy tissues.. she told me to come back in 2 weeks time... Yeah rite!  anywaz, vic n me, we had a fight.. wat's new? well i think i totally screwed up his plans for my birthday surprise.. i don't know how i did it, or wat i did wrong. But i was honest with him, so there! Oh well.. another fight means another make-up session n dont we all LOVE making up...  Just watched Ms Congeniality like for the 1000th time.. cracks me up all the time.. Texas was gorgeous. she should have won.   2 days to my big day.. 23.. hmm.. sould i be happy about this? i seriously don't think so. 24 in another year... ACK!

						   went for gaya's wedding.. was held in Bayview hotel. Went there with Suganthi.   Yesterz, i brought Misty to Vic's house to surprise them. They had no inkling that i was coming.. They loved her, from the looks of it.. n she looked pretty comfortable there too.. Vic's mum is really good at cooking, she made chilli crab n pasta. i only had stomach for pasta, n then i made a move home.   I miss yuen n has.. work isn't the same anymore. There isn't much laughter in the centre.. can't wait to run away..

						   Last friday, i took leave n had so much of fun with vic. We first went for the lord of the rings exhibition, which was way cool.. n the guy at the ticket booth was hot..   anywaz, there were like figures n videos abt each character which was really interesting. Then we went to vicz house, coz it was his mumz b'day. he bought her a cake..*awww*.. we made plans to dine at pastamania, so we brought e cake there. Kamz, prakash n siva came too.. so it was quite fun.. vicz mum was really sweet, cos she bought me a bag of assorted belts..  the nex day was full of excitement..why? cos me n vic, we were at Great world city.. for the harry potter show! vic is like e best, he booked e tickets online, as a surprise 4 me..   Oh.. but alas.. the show was a slight disappointment. Sirius looked bad, n so did ron.. the dementors looked..err interesting.. they reminded me of a ring wraith..dunno if that had anything to do with e lotr exhibit.   The End

						   I feel so absolutely stressed, bout watz been happening in e damn centre. everything's turning out all wrong. Has juz resigned today, n they're pushing us to our limits with their dumb demands..argh!  Thought i was good with patience, maybe not. I can't stand to stay in that place for a moment longer. Looking at her face, makes me feel like a hypocrite...but why? Coz i'm putting up an act in front of her? Like i really like my job n all, but actually i'm cringing at every thought of it!?   Vic's been supportive, but sometimes you don't feel like listening to someone go on about what you didn't do before, u not listening to past advice n so on..   I hate thunder, i'm terrified of them, but funny.. how well it coincides with my mood..

						   I had such a good time yesterz. started out cranky actually. met vic n we went to shop for shawls to give mdm lau n auntie. i was feeling a teensy bit hungry, n vic wasnt.. so i waited, grumpily i might add, for my romeo to get hungry too.. but it never happened.  n that took us both to ochard emerald foodcourt. i ordered crispy noodles, which must have looked really good, coz within e nex 5 mins.. he got hungry.. heheh  note: crispy noodles sucked big time.  Today though, was an emotional day.. has's last day in dino.. n yuenz leaving this sun.. so that leaves me with.. me.. me n me. sighz..   am i a bad owner to misty..? i wonder..

						   i have got loadz to catch up on.. kay, here i go..  Let me start with my mumz b'day. i bought my mum a gold anklet.It's really cool n unique.She's prob the only person in S'pore that has that, cos it was oringinally a chain. We had to order it to be made.why gold? coz she's ze best! It cost $180, but i only paid $100.. On her b'day, 21st July.. parima, jess, tata, amachi n vic surprised my mum by coming over for dinner. I told them to come late on purpose, so that she'd think there were no plans.. hehe.. It was fun! We ate K.F.C, n ordered Pizza. Sadly though, i wasn't feeling too well.. But the night turned out good. Now gotta start planning next years'.. coz she's hitting ?0!!! hurhur..  Next week is my dad's b'day.. he's turning 53. Have absolutely no idea what to get him.. hmm..   I had a FANTASTIC weekend last week.. Vic n myself, we were at K.L, for his soccer n netball championship. We stayed at Hotel Equatorial, n it completely rocked! There were 3 couples altogether. 3 girlz, 3 boyz.. that wld me premi, anand, rathika, raveen, Vic n myself..  We had loadsa fun. The 1st night, we clubbed till 5 am in the morning. Rathika n myself were forced to wake up for the breakfast buffet. We spent the morning at the field, watching our men play.. n guess wat.. they cinched the championship!! vic scored THREE goals.. everybody was praising him. Tom said i shd treat him like a king.. hahaha..   That night, we went to this seafood place to pig out. It was just the four of us.. rathika, raveen, vic n myself. We ordered chilli crab, tomyam soup, veg, pepper chicken, prawns n fish. The food was gOOd! Then we headed to bangsar, to club. Raveen brought us to this club, that resembled naughty nine. The music there was good, but we were dead sleepy. We just had a jug of bourbon, that tasted funny, n we headed back.   I was sad to leave K.L, cos i totally destressed there. forgot abt my tuiton, my flu, n most of all.. my job. But i missed my family, including misty. Hanging out with the other couples were so fun. We promised to do it again sometime soon. We're already planning a BBQ right abt now.   Work is crappy at the moment, coz there's so much of unhappiness there. I'm juz glad that i've mapped out wat i would like to do in future, n it sure as hell does not include DINO!   Got lots more to tell, abt vic n me n future plans..hurhur.. but am really tired.. so will pop back soon to update..see ya!

We ordered Hawaiian Pizza.. tasted totally delicious- minus the gross onions that is. He was telling me about his gf, n abt how he wants to be a pilot when he comes back here.&nbsp;We also chatted alot about religion.&nbsp;We really had a good conversation..  After dinner, he walked me to my train n i left.&nbsp;I was glad that we met n caught up.. i really missed him.. as a friend that is..&nbsp; we'll probably be keeping in touch thru emails n stuff.  &nbsp; Vic n i.. we're ok.

We then headed to the mall to get me a pair of sports shoes.. n i'm not known as miss fuSSy for nothing, therefore we headed back empty handed.  He later went for soccer, n i had tuiton.

Later, vic n myself went to my grampz place, it was his b'day celebration. Was quite fun, with Misty there n all. Then we all headed home. The End.   School tomorrow.. crap!

						   My comp is so totally slow. It's kinda giving me a lesson on patience, n it isn't going so well.  The past week have been interesting. Yesterz was FANTASTIC!! I met vic at Kovan mrt. He bought a Giordano top for himself. Poor thing, he bought this really nice top in K.L, n it was ruined cos of ironing.. But his white Gio top looked good.  We then headed to Harbourfront. We went walking from floor to floor... and then... i fell in love! With this ToTaLLy GORGEOUS jacket from ELLE. i was ga-ga over it. It was pink and so adorable. Vic, being the sweet person that he is, BOUGHT me the jacket... heheh...  Note : I Love My Boyfriend.  After a while, i got a teensy bit hungry, so we sat at pastamania and had soup n coleslaw. Then we headed to Raffles, to meet Raveen n Rathika. It was so good, meeting up with them. We chatted n stuffz, n soon, we found ourselves in Marina, together with Prem n Premi.  We took a bus, to the seafood place, found ourselves a good seat, n had LOADZ of fun, eating, talking, gossiping, more eating... n stuffz.  After the meal, all of us got an ice-cream, n walked to this hidden secluded beach. Gawd was it romantic! The six of us sat down n spoke abt our relationships, past n present n abt loadz of other stuffz. It was ultra windy, n with the four of them there, perfect.  Before long we had to leave. But soon, we'll be planning something new. And it's gonna be juz as fun. .  Today, we went to my aunts place for some prayers. Was alright. The food was quite good too. I'm now all alone, waiting for my parents to come back. They went to ashoka, to dance the night away...hehehe. They went in a large group, so i hope they have loadsa fun dancing n de-stressing.  Note : Misty's with me (thank god!)  Justin's at wk now. He's getting more mature n responsible now. I'm glad. He's really tired sometimes, i can tell. But he never gives up. Never knew he had that streak in him. Not everyone's like that. I hope everything pays off for him in a fantastic way, cos he deserves it. Vic was telling me last week, that it was so obvious, that i meant alot to justin. That made me smile, n made my day...  Nite..
