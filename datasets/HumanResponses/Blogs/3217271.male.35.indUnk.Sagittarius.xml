      Ok so here I am in a historical part of the ol USA Valley Forge. You know I should have learned more about this when I was in school. I didn't. Why? Becuase I was a stupid kid much like the morons that parade around me now. They have no care for the history of this place. I don't really blame them too much. They are young. The young can't understand things that happened to other people yet. They are still WAY too stuck  on themseleves. Kristine, my girlfriend, is near her home town as well this weekend. She went on some cave tour and appearently she deems me more knowledgable than the tour guide. While its granted I know more than a masters and less than a PhD on the subject of geology I am not perfect yet.   Who knows perhaps I will some day learn all I like on many many subjects.  HAve a good Memorial day and remember those who fought and die or served in service of our country.

      Well the thing is this.... I have no clue why I am depressed.  Ok that is not totally true. I know one thing is I miss Kristine and if I was with her I would have something to do.  Such is love and distances.

      I truly feel that it is the RIGHT.. Yes, the right of those of us that are mentally superior to rule those who are inferior. The world would do much better run by logic not hate and insanity   This is not how the world is no matter what you say. The world is run by the morons.. Should I give you examples?  Reality TV that is NOT REAL!!! The Jackass Show Jessica Simpson MTV that has little to NO music or anything related to music Lottery tickets.. (Tax on those bad at mathâ€¦. ok not all bad) Boy Bands Brittany Spears Trailer Parks  Shall I go on?   I could but the list would be enormous. Now I will admit I am very bad grammar so I have those that are my better in that area check things for me. No they have not checked this so shove it low brow!  Any way these are the reasons those that are smart should rule those that are stupid..
