      The boys over at  urlLink JibJab.com  have outdone themselves. Check out their version of the classic American anthem  urlLink "This Land is Your Land, This Land is My Land"  and try not to wet yourself from laughing.    urlLink   &nbsp;   // J

      Hey everybody! So I figured: "I'm good enough, I'm smart enough and, gosh darn it, people like me" -- enough to want to know how I feel about things. All kinds of things! And people! And places! Golly-gee,&nbsp;it'll be swell!&nbsp; And they all frolicked through the daisies and lived happily ever after with  urlLink puppies  and  urlLink kitties  and little baby Jesus...   Yeah, enough of that Mr. Rogers crap. Here's the real deal: I just wanted a place to ramble and gripe and pontificate on the thousand random facets of living on this planet. Like why doesn't the toilet paper&nbsp;ever (EVER!)&nbsp;tear along those nice little perforations? Whether using a dainty tug or a quick rip, you always get an  urlLink imperfect tear . One of life's mysteries, and something  urlLink Martha Stewart  would never stand for...   So check in from time to time. Write a note. Leave some feedback. Or don't. Whatever.   // J

       I hate cops. Hate them. Believe me, I can separate the man from the badge and understand that these people must operate on some other level when in uniform. It's the only thing that explains why a perfectly decent human being can become such an asshole for 40 hours each week.  What really burns me is when these people take the tiniest sliver of power and authority they've been granted and abuse it. Like when a cop hassles you on the beach for no reason other than the  urlLink perfectly legal  beer in your hand. Or when they wrecklessly speed around in their cruisers without cause. Or when they ticket or even  urlLink shoot homeless people . A lot of times, after seeing local police officers "in action," I have to ask myself: "Don't these bastards have something   better   to do?"  Case in point: Yesterday, Abby and I were walking to the gym. It was about 6pm and we were just crossing the parking lot of the adjacent Robb Field Rec Center, when we passed a group of three cop cars parked together. The officers were just getting out of their cruisers as a fourth cop car came flying in to the spot next to them.  All of this peaked my curiosity. Was this a meeting before some sort of bust? Were they planning the evening's patrol routes? Were they discussing the best place for donuts? No, no, no. They were standing around smoking cigars. I'm sure there must have been some cause for celebration -- but honestly. In uniform? On the job? With your cruisers running? ON MY FRIGGIN  urlLink TAX DIME ?!?  I know it's been said a millions times by thousands of fed up "civilians," but this shit has gone too far. The police need to be policed. Someone needs to be out there to truthfully "SERVE and PROTECT" not to "HASSLE and INTIMIDATE" -- until then, you're all just pigs to me.  // J

      Check out the  urlLink new Strongbad email  at  urlLink homestarrunner.com . Funny stuff.   urlLink   &nbsp;   And if you ever played  urlLink King's Quest  as a kid, you'll love the faux-intro to&nbsp; urlLink Peasant's Quest  from Vitrelecix. Need a loan? Try  urlLink Senor Cardgage Mortgage .    HYPE ALERT:  Anyone have $13,500 I can borrow? I want to buy 100 shares of  urlLink Google stock  when it opens. At just $135 per share, that's a bargain. Right?   // J

      This one's for all the guys: How many times have you been standing at the bar, waiting patiently for the bartender to give you the nod and ask your order, when up prances some girl, all tits and smiles and flippy hair and lip gloss, and she gets served first.  Ok, whatever, you take it in stride, you don't want to be a block, you don't want to fuck up the guy's game, ruin his shwerve. So you wait. Then suddenly there's another girl being served before you. You think: "Maybe I didn't make it   abundantly   clear that I wanted a little bit of service. Maybe my leaning forward on the bar, a twenty in hand,   staring   at the guy -- maybe I was a bit too subtle."  So you gesture, hand up, you catch his attention -- finally -- and he takes the order of the nice D-cups sitting next to you. At last, with no female in sight, this neanderthal asks "What can I get you, buddy?"  WHAT THE FUCK?!? Do you honestly think that by giving preferential treatment to random women, you actually have an increased chance of scoring -- with your customers? Did you ever stop to think that maybe, just maybe, this girl might be using you to get what she wants, and you probably don't even care that she didn't tip you.  Oh no, but after being bar-snubbed not once, not twice, but THREE FRIGGIN TIMES by your ignorant bartender ass, when   I   fail to leave a tip, you give me the hairy eyeball?!? You must be kidding me. And I say: "Fuck you,   buddy  ".  Never one to bitch without offering some kind of rational solution, here's my proposition: All bartenders from here on out should be Eunuchs. That's right, geld them all.  You see, back in ancient Egypt the kings used to take strapping young males and castrate them, leaving them utterly passionless. Useless for most things, but perfect for guarding the palace harem. And perfect for serving our drinks, men and women alike.  // J

         Thanks to everyone who joined me in celebrating my 27th birthday this weekend (Abby, Krak, Novak and parents, Krystl, Neil, Amy, Driscoll, Helena, and Katy). We had a blast at the  urlLink Karl Strauss Brewery  in downtown San Diego. They offer a private tour of the brewing facility and a comprehensive (that means you get loaded) beer tasting session with your tour guide.  After a quick drink at Rock Bottom, we stumbled over to the  urlLink Shout House  piano bar where they have dueling pianos. These guys cover  EVERYTHING  from Beastie Boys to Styx to the Uncle Fucker song from South Park. Needless to say, they had me up on stage performing  urlLink Pee-wee's Tequila dance , catching bras, and doing the Chicken Dance.  Sweet. Good times.  // J

       urlLink     I never knew  urlLink Transformers  were brothers... With  urlLink moves like this , they could have easily started their own Robot Boy Band and made millions in album sales on top of their millions in toy sales. Who knew?  (thanks for the link  urlLink Donnie )  // J
