      Hey everyone! This is my first little "diary entry" so far so I think that I will tell you about myself. I was given the name "Jennie Elizabeth Miltenberger" on April 6, 1988. I was born to Dianne and David Miltenberger, who had already happened to have had 3 other children. My oldest brother, Shawn David, died in my mother's stomach by choking on the imbilical cord. Wasn't it nice for the doctors to tell my mom as soon as they found out rather than waiting for him to be born?! Yeah, it would have been. Anyways, my other brother is Jason Michael. He was born on Saint Patrick's Day and is 6 years older than me. I have a sister too and her name is Rebecca Dianne (referred to as Becki or fatass haha), who is 5 years older than me. Yeah growing up with them wasn't too cool since they liked to make fun of my ears and the way I did things....so what if I colored with my mouth open, you know?! I live right next door to the Dicks'. Good 'ole Greg, Patty, Matt, Mike, and Jenn. I have known them all of my life. Jenn and I are so close that we seem to be more like sisters. I always felt like I needed to be there to protect her from the bad things the world produces. Mike is like my best friend other than Jenn. He is just so fun to be around and always makes me laugh. I had the biggest crush on him when I was little and it was awkward to even be around him. That changed though when Jenn got sick one day and I had no one else to hang out with. Since that day, Mike became my other best friend. I don't think anyone can even imagine or come close to how much fun we have all had together. The tents we used to make were amazing. I mean we each had our own bedroom/bathroom, there was a living room, kitchen, dining room..I mean come on here! Unless you made a tent with us, your's sucked ass! haha! We had our occasional fights but who doesn't? I loved it most when we would make up songs and make videos...or whenever EVERYONE in the neighborhood would play "Kick the Can" or "SPUD" on those weekend and crisp summer nights. PRICELESS. There is another person who played a big role in my life. Lucy Roderick. One crazy mother facker but a really good friend. She would come down at like 6:30 am and want to play. I never really appreciated it then but boy what I would give to have her do it once more....or for her and her family to move back into their house that was only 2 houses up from mine. We would do everything together and we were pretty much inseperatable (Did I spell that right? haha). Then she moved and it changed my life forever....I don't see her or her sister Neena (Neener) that much anymore and I wish it wasn't like that...Lu if you are reading this just please remember how much you meant and still mean to me...awwe man..now this subject has made me pretty sad...so I am going to try to move on...KATRINEY! geeze I'll tell you something about Katrin Hubbard (Kathryn Huber). She is just one cool gal. I was 4 when she was born and we both went to the same babysitter (Barbara) who made this kickass meal- chicken casarole, mashed potatoes, green beans, apple sauce, sometimes cottage cheese and the traditional green kool-aid to wash it down- YUMMAY! Yeah Kathryn's dog also attacked me when I was about 3 or 4 and I still have the scar on my left arm...RIP Heidi- I love you babes. You see, they had to put her to sleep a few weeks ago because she was sick...what a good dog though I tell you. One of a kind that Heidi was, always there to protect us and she would never let anything hurt us. It is kinda funny though because the one day Kathryn didn't bring Heidi with her a dog chased her around and was biting her pants. She didn't get hurt and it was a bit humorous...I mean..it wasn't...haha! The saying is true though, you don't realize how much something or someone really means to you until they are gone. It sucks doesn't it? Yeah oh by the way...I sing and I love to act. My mom has video tapes of me from when I was about 2 with me singing and dancing up in the living room. Music has been in my life since I was little and I just love it. Also, I love to be the center of attention...just ask my siblings....well it is late so I am going to go, night!
