      I know what you're all wondering.  How do you follow up a posting declaring your love for a special girl?  The answer's simple, follow it up with a posting about the pin-up girl of your dreams.  If there's any girls who are currently reading this (*snickers* I'm sorry, I just can't see any girls actually looking at my website.  Anyway...) they're probably thinking 'If you already have a special girl in mind, why do you need a girl of your dreams?'  It's a valid question, so I'm going to answer it before my lead in to my actual posting.  The special girl in your life is someone you meet anywhere.  Shopping mall, work, restaurants, gatherings, etc.  Dream girls are girls that are notorious.  Girls that where ever you go, at some point there's going to be another person who knows who you're talking about.  They're usually celebrities or facsimiles of celebrities.  So, the difference is you have more of a chance with the special girl then you do with the dream girl.  So, my dream girl is a girl named Szandora.  She's a model, hair-stylist, and make-up artist.  I could go into detail about how I discovered her, but I'm not gonna.  Anyway, I spent a few hours today looking up stuff on her and found various items.  A few in particular, an online journal.  I spent a couple hours reading the old entries (hey, I read Paul's a few nights ago, why not hers too?).  It's very interesting.  Anyway, I just think she's nifty.  I found and email address during my search, so I took a chance and emailed her.  The email was brief and to the point, I just stated that I was curious if it was still active or just a dead link.  To my surprise, when I arrived home after work, I got a reply from her: 'Yea. it's alive.'  So, it's kinda like getting a boost in life.  A boost of confidence, which will hopefully come in handy when / if I come into contact with Sarah again.  So, it's cool that my dream girl can help me with my special girl.  All I have to do is not let one know about the other.  Wait, I guess that's only if I was dating both.  And I'm not dating... either.  *sigh*

      There's this girl, her name is Sarah, and I really think she's special.  To me, she's a lot of character and a lot of spunk.  I met her in High School, and there I fell for her.  I never knew how to talk to her or act around her, so I just rambled and stumbled around her in the meantime.  Then I went off to college and I lost track of her.  This was something I regarded as a hugh mistake on my part.  I had girlfriends before, but Sarah was something (as I said before) special.  Every so once in a while, a couple months to a few days, I would remember her.  But mostly, I would remember what I had lost.  Then she came back into my life again.  She was, ironically, in Madison.  She worked just a hop skip and a jump away from where I worked, too.  Every so once in a while, I would stop in and see her.  But I felt imposing going into her workplace just to see her.  I asked for her number, but she just gave me her work number.  So when I called, I felt like I was a pest to her other co-workers.  The whole situation was awkward, so I limited my contact with her until I could figure out a way around it.  But I never did.  One day I found out that she was saving up her money to move away.  Heartbroken, I first just thought it would be best to just cut the loss and move on.  But a few weeks later, I realized I was making the same mistake as I had made the first time I let her slip away.  In the final days I tried to spend some time with her, but I just got 2 hours which we spent watching American Wedding at my theater with one of her friends.  I never got to tell her how I feel about her.  After that, she was gone once again.  A few months passed.  I stopped into her workplace once with some friends.  I curiously asked them if they had heard from her.  They said she calls every so once in a while to let them know how she's doin'.  She was in Washington (state) last time they called.  So you may be wondering, why do I remember all this now?  Well, Paul has class with this girl who's a friend of Sarah's.  When he talked to her, she mentioned she was in contact with Sarah.  I asked him if he could, through the girl, get Sarah's number for me, and if not that, give her my number to give to Sarah.  Tonight, Paul told me that he found out that Sarah may be back in the Madison area again.  So, here's not to second chances, but the rarely occuring third 'Don't-Fuck-This-Up-Yet-Again' chance.  Maybe this time things will be different.  Maybe this time I will do things right.  Maybe I should stop analyzing this and just make it happen.  Maybe I'll do that...

      I had posted something on here earlier, but I decided to change it.  Why the change, you ask?  Well, I just sorta rambled through the last one, then I was gonna go take a nap.  Then I stopped and started reading  urlLink Paul's blog .  I went all the way back to when he first started writing on it and worked my way to the present.  About half-way through it, I realized that some people (mostly Paul in this case) gets out and does a lot more then I do.  Mostly, that's my fault, but I don't really know where to go by myself.  So I just stick to what I know, and I know how to be by myself.  I think I live a lot of my days pretty much the same.  I confine myself to a little section of my efficency apartment and pretty much make the day of being in that one place.  I mostly watch TV, write on my computer, or read stuff.  I drink a lot of OJ now.  I think about relationships more then I live them.  But I had a lot of bad experiences with relationships in the past.  None of them were very pleasent experiences, so that's been the kinda impression I get with dating.  I'm a negative person, I know that.  I look at other people around me and all I see is what I lack that they all have.  In fact, when I started writing this thing, I was gonna have a positive message be the backdrop of the theme, but it is turning out to be a depressing sob story.  Oh well.  I do want to get out more, but I have some sorta fear of being in busy places alone.  That, and I hate driving around in areas I'm not familiar with.  I like to be around other people, but I always have the feeling that other people don't want to be around me.  I used to be a nice guy, but so many people have taken advantage of my kindness that it made me bitter.  But, I am going to do something cool by the end of the night.  I'm gonna call up Timmy and leave him a funny message on his phone.

      Police are always suspicious of you.  This sometimes pisses me off, especially around 2-3 in the morning (bar time).  They follow you very closely and just try to find a lame reason to pull you over.  My lame sister says this is an okay thing, but I think it's bullshit.  Unless you're really causing trouble, and I mean really causing trouble, that's a good reason to pull someone over.  One night I was returning to B'ville to do laundry and I debated about putting gas in my car now or doing it in the morning.  I decided that I'd rather do it now since I'm up.  So I went downtown and started gassing up my car when I saw headlights coming towards me.  I turned and saw it was the town's cop, who then turned up the street.  After I was done, I pulled out and saw him coming back down.  I waited and let him go by and I pulled out behind him.  He then pulled off to the side and I passed him.  He came back out onto the street and followed me.  When I turned up the street my sister lived on (the cooler sister), the lights came on.  I just sat there wondering what the fuck this guy could possibly be pulling me over for.  He pulled me over because I had no light above my licence plate.  Okay, I understand certain reasons why cops utilize little excuses to pull people over, but come on.  All I wanted to do was save a little time and energy and instead I get pestered by hickville's finest.  Even the cops in Madison know better.  Unless you're seriously doing something, all they do is follow you until you've proven beyond a doubt that you're not gonna be a threat to anyone else on the roads.  I had a cop that followed me from the beltline all the way to where you turn off on County M.  Before, this kinda ticked me off too, but after the B'ville incident, I don't feel all that bothered by it.  There was another time when I was speeding down County M (60 in a 45), but the cop just gave me a warning.  I figured that all he was looking for was drunk people and he must've thought that I was just not being a very observant driver (which I wasn't).  So, I now know that apparently being up late and on the road is a crime.  More so if you're in a small town because all the major violators are there (especially at 2 in the morning).

      We're trying to get into the routine of playing cards every Monday at The Apartment.  The game of choice is Texas Hold 'em, others include Blackjack (sometimes with multiple decks), Euchre, and regular Poker.    Tim's Tell: He bets everything, gets up, and turns his back to the table.  He does this to hide the  smirk on his face, hoping that no one will notice that he's bluffing.  If you so much as have an ace in your hand, you're still good, but have at least 1 high card.    This week's players: Chris, Paul, Timmy, Schober, & Smoe.  Winners: Timmy & Schober  The game was cut short when Paul answered 50 phone calls.  He then had to go fix a friend's computer.  In the meantime, Smoe joined and I learned how to play 'Pepper... something'.  It took me a while to get the hang of the game, but after we (Timmy & Me vs. Chris & Smoe) lost, I had a good grasp of the game.  Upon Paul's return, we adjourned to The Green Room for some pool playin'.  Teams rotated, but Paul ended up on the winning team more then the rest.  The interesting part came in one of the last games (maybe it was the last).  Timmy and Paul were passing each other and Timmy slapped Paul's stomach and Paul instinctively punched back, hitting Tim in the junk.    Paul's Psyche-out: when the shooter lines up his shot, stand at the end of the path and place your finger randomly on the edge of the table.  This is to make the shooter unknowingly aim for where your finger is.  Results vary, but the longer the shot, the better it works in your favor    Timmy had a hard time hitting the cue, walking, and standing in general.  On the way out, Timmy chased after Paul and the two began to resort to snowball fighting.  This was quickly found to be fruitless as the snowballs disintigrated upon becoming airborn.  Chris tackled Tim while Paul unlocked the car.  Tim pulled Chris away from the passenger seat and took it himself.  Chris paid Timmy back with snow in his hood (which was then made to trickle down his back).  The hijinx then turned to verbal fights.  Upon arriving at Perkins, Paul received the upper hand when he started describing in vivid detail about Tim and a certain girl having 'mistaken identity' sex in the dark.  This proved to be the last of that.    Chris's Challenge: 1000 Island Dressing, 3 types of syrup (maple, blueberry, peach), & ketcup.  Stirred into a brown mixture, then dip a french fry into it and consume.  If vanilla shake is added, make sure it is still frozen and not melted.    The night drew to a close and we headed back to The Apartment.  Timmy got one last shot in at Paul and took off.  Chris followed, but then started to test the slickness of the ground.  Tim thought he still had pursuers and tripped on the curb trying to get away.  Everyone laughed.  Timmy then shut the door on everyone and acted all pouty.  Chris and I played Enter The Matrix for a couple hours, Timmy crashed for the night and Paul did some homework and studying.  So, as you can see, Monday Night is Poker Night.  Althought little poker was played this week, the games and hilarity was a good substitute.  Plus, we learned some things.    Schober's Lesson: Always carry a tape recorder on you so you can record the story that Paul tells at Perkins so you can listen to it later.

      My brother-in-law stopped over and updated my computer the other day, so there was no posting yesterday.  I had this old modem and the new system didn't recognize the obsolete POS.  So the next day we went and bought a new modem.  He added more RAM, updated to Windows XP and hooked up a CD burner (my first).  So I've been playing with my new toys since I've been back at home.  I'm gonna put more things on CD, so I can save on hard drive space.  I download a lot of crap, most of which winds back up on my own webpage.  But I keep some of it as back up, and I used to keep the backups on floppy disks, lots of floppy disks.  Then I stopped using them and my hard drive started to fill up.  Well, that's pretty much my story, and I'd like to point out that from now on I'll have titles at the top of each posting now.  YAY!

      Our theater has a gremlin in it.  I don't mean the car, but a real, mythological-come-real gremlin.  The little bugger does random things all about the theater.  He causes brain wraps (which is when the movie binds and can no longer flow through the projector), he steals things, and he makes noises in the middle of the night which would normally scare the piss out of a regular floor staffer.  Recently, he made this one eerie thing happen in our projector.  Now, I won't expect anyone to understand what happened if  I described it.  So let me just say that we had 4 people, 1 of which is an expert of sorts that can explain anything that happens in a projector, that saw everything running fine and then completely wrong with no way to explain the transition.  The little fucker also stole a manager's English book and another employee's manual for her cell-phone.  On Thursday, he stole the keys for the poster case and we all searched for said keys for 40 minutes before giving up.  Those keys were found the next day, out of the blue, on top of the soda tower.  No one can explain how it got there.  Jon, the theater's head manager, was setting up a movie in the booth.  Suddenly, there was a sound that was sorta like a little creature had jumped up onto the roof of the theater and ran down the entire length of the booth.  The booth is as long as (I'm guessing) half a football field.  It kinda creeped him out because he said that it reminded him that scene in Signs when the aliens were running around the farm.  One day, the gremlin will leave the theater.  And in his wake will be a trail of havoc he wrought upon the theater.  And he will laugh his little gremlin-y laugh and disappear from our lives.  Either that, or the managers will devise a plan to catch the little fucker and turn him in to the government for testing.  We'll be millionaires!  Until then, we wait and shall be tricked by his little games.

      I've decided that every time I post something on my blog, I'm gonna have a general theme.  Keeps me to one subject a day.  I'm also keeping a little list on my desk for things to talk about if I come up with no topics for the day.  Anyway, I concidered many topics over the course of today, but I'm gonna write about what I'm doing at the same time as I'm writing this right now.  I asked my co-worker Michelle if she knew what the outift in  urlLink this picture  was called.  She said she didn't know off the top of her head, but she would look it up in her book she has at home.  When I watched Elf that night (which was another topic I was concidering talking about), she came in and told me that the best description she could find is 'body harness'.  I kinda thought that, but I wasn't really sure.  Anyway, I came back to my apartment after the movie and looked up pictures with that description.  JACKPOT!!  I found a whole slew of them and I started to collect a frenzy of pictures.  I'm gonna make a page dedicated to this kinda wear.  Stay tuned.  In the meantime, I just wanted to tell you all about my discovery.

      Quantum Leap was on SciFi today.  I don't know about you, but that show kicked some serious ass.  It was ahead of it's time and it's run was cut too short.  When I first moved to Madison, it was playing on a daily basis.  Now, it airs once every few weeks in the daily rotation slot.  THAT SUCKS!  I read somewhere that the first season is coming out on DVD near the end of 2004.  Here's to hopin' that's true.  Anyway, the show hasn't been on TV for a few months now.  SciFi took it out of the rotation and I've been deprived.  Now it's back and I'm alive again!  How sad.  I keep reading every so once in a while that they're going to revive the show, but it'll be horrible if SciFi does the series.  I mean come on, look at their movies and other original series.  Could you imagine what they'd do to the show, too?  So, I sit here watching the first five episodes, which I'm thankful for.  SciFi used to show 5 episodes every few months then another 5 episodes that were either later or earlier then the previous ones.  So it was hard to watch all those episodes together and then watch a different part of the series.  Grr.  But now they're showing the series in order, so rejoice!  Hooray for Quantum Leap!

      I went into work today after my weekly two days off.  I asked my boss, Jon, if I had missed anything since the last time I there (as saucy things tend to happen in my absence).  He told me that something did happen yesterday.  A church group had come in to the theather to watch Matrix 3 (I choose to drop the Revolutions part).  Most of them arrived on time, but there were a few who arrived 20-40 minutes late.  After the show, the theater cleared out, except the late-comers.  Now our theater doesn't allow hold-overs (people who come in late staying for the beginning of the next show), so they were told to clear out so we could start seating for the next show.  A woman, who was the leader of the group, came out and talked to the manager.  After a while, the manager allowed them to stay just for the beginning.  After that, she came back out again and said to our manager "If I was a white person, would you have said anything?"  This pissed me off upon hearing, and I wasn't even a part of the situation (although a couple years ago, I was involved in a similar situation).  I hate this fuckin' playing of the race card.  Now I'm not saying that the world is a perfect place, there are racist people in the world.  But when people like me and the manager that night are accused of being racist, that's a racist thing too.  I mean would she be accusing us of being racist if we were actually someone of her race?  No, so she's being more racist then I was or ever will be.  My job, as a manager of the theater, is to do my job as the manager of the theater.  And part of the job is to charge all customers equally for admission into the theater.  This admission is signified by the ticket presented to them entering the theater sold to them at the box office.  The ticket shows where they are to be (the movie) and when (the time displayed).  Once that time is up, your admittence in the theater is over and it's time to leave.  And the manager must maintain that rule.  And that my friend is common sense, not a racial issue.  My rant is done, but I would like to end saying this:  My parents raised me to believe in equality.  I want to believe in equality.  But when there are people in the world who want there to be racial tension, no matter what your race is, it makes it harder to see the better world.

      I just signed up to do this blog thing. I was surprised that I could have it published directly onto my website. Anyway, before I signed up for this, I wrote this little page, but didn't know where to put it on my website. Then I decided to check out Paul's blog and signed myself up. So, here's the piece I wrote beforehand:   ---   Isn't it sad? I've been sitting here and I wanted to add onto my website for the last 4 hours. I wanted to add something that was original, new. But then I sorta realized something that I've suspected for months now: I'm not very original when it comes to putting things on here.   I mean, think about it and examine with me. Open a seperate window with the main menu of this website. Okay, here's the original pages I've made: The About Me Page, Quest for World Domination, Lawn Chair Party, Hatemail, Ask Carol A Question, Cool Words, Animation Page, Beautiful Girls, Jim and Fred, Gothic Appreciation, Cornfield Story, (Asylum), Tape Trading, Game Systems, and Movie Posters. That's.... (counting) 15 pages out of the 35 pages (including the pending ones). That's less then half the pages. You can possibly add the Friends and Links pages, but that's your call.   So where did I get the other pages you ask? Well, most of them are compiled with information I've collected from other websites. I believe that my website is a part of me, and I want to put these things I've collected along the way on my page because they're a part of me now too.   But then I sit here and I want to add to me (through the website) and I'm lost. Maybe tomorrow will provide new possibilities.   ---   Well, seems I didn't have to wait 'til tomorrow, it's got fixed in about 20 minutes. Who said it's best to sleep on these kinda things? Anyway, now the real challenge is to keep writing on this thing. Wish me luck!

      On Saturday, I went to Tim's birthday party.  I had to work until around 7:30, made a quick stop back at my apartment to get my boots, and I was off to the party arriving around 8-ish.  Upon arrival, I noticed that Caddyshack had just started (DVD) and was playing on TV.  Little Dude was leaving and a few minutes later, Chris left too.  I felt like I had just missed the party because everyone was filing out.  But there was plenty of other people still hanging around.  Beginning Party Patron List: Timmy (of course), Smoe, Wilson, Nate, Beth, & Shawn.  Smoe's mother had prepared a whole slew of hors d'oeuvres.  Mini-weiners, meatballs, deviled eggs, & these little pickles wrapped in meat.  I was heavily sampling the deviled eggs and pickle thingies.  Then I started to dig into the hot dogs they had.  I think over the course of the night I had eaten 6-7 of them.  Shawn at some point said that as a precaution, if by chance the cops do by chance show up, the truck that belongs to him has just been sold to Timmy.  This would explain the guns inside (which legally Shawn can't have in his vehicle since he's not 21), and all the paperwork is in the glove compartment.  Yeah, Tim does seem like the gun-totin' type.  Paul arrived back at The Apartment.  He wasn't there for long, he said he wanted to go get Steph and bring her back.  At one point, Heather was randomly flashing people.  She then even suggested that she and Beth flash the guys without bras on.  Beth wasn't all too keen on the idea, but Heater removed her bra (without taking her shirt off) and threw it at Smoe.  Now I walked away from her at this point, and went and watched Slap Shot, because I'm not one who wants to see too much of your own co-workers.  I have my limits and my standards.  Tim came over to the TV after a while and said he would never be the same.    Smoe wanted to have a the game Passout.  So, since I was the only sober one, I volunteered to go purchase the game at Spencers.  Smoe gave me $20 and I was on my way.  I walked into the mall and into Spencers.  Thank god Chuck wasn't working there, if he even does work there.  I looked around the place trying to find that game.  I had no luck.  I looked some more, still no luck.  Finally, I asked one of the employees and he showed me that it was right in the doorway when I walk in, I walked completely by it when I came in.  Humbled, I grabbed the game and brought it over to the counter.  He rang me up, then pointed out that the game was water logged, and allowed me to go get an undamged game.  I walked back over to the boards and looked.  The next two were also damaged, so I grabbed the next 3.  I told him two more were damaged and that the 3rd game was the one I wanted.  He seemed frustrated that there were so many damaged games.  I never really saw what the cause was for getting them all wet.  Upon arriving back at The Apartment, I was greeted by three people.  One of them was Balch.  He had come to say hello and wish Timmy a happy birthday.  Balch was just stopping by for a while, then he was off to a party his sister was holding.  I think it was some sort of engagement party.  I told him a joke (Why can't Helen Keller drive?  Because she's a woman) which he thought it was funny.  He asked me to tell him a few more good ones that he could tell at the other party.  I had to dig around in my brain to remember some of the good ones.  A few of them always pop back to the top, but some of them aren't all that great.  I used to be an encyclopedia of jokes.  Times change.  Little Dude returned at one point in the night, but this time with Danielle.  Later, Chris arrived too.  Chris got a call from Paul during the night (I had guessed he was dead in a ditch, Tim guessed he was baking potatoes before serving them).  Hours had passed since his departure, and I was almost sure he wasn't returning for the night.  But, now he apparently was on his way back.  Nate had disappeared at some point.  I went in search of him and found him in Tim & Paul's room playing Yahoo's Texas Hold'em online.  I joined him a couple of times to see how he was doing.  He pointed out that when the money isn't real, the game gets less interesting.  You can go in the red and it doesn't matter.  When the money isn't real, no one cares if they lose $100.  But when the money is real, people bet less or can be psyched out of the betting game.  Plus, if you have nothing, you can make people think you do.  But not when the money isn't real.  At some point, someone wanted to play Texas Hold'em.  I hadn't played this in a while, so I was in.  The other two players were Nate, Wilson, and first time player Shawn.  It was during game play that I realized that Wilson is a very loud and rude drunk (or alcoholic, which ever term you find acceptable).  He kept insulting Shawn who was just learning how to play the game for the first time.  I wasn't all into that, and several times I wanted to just get up and leave, but I had to stay in the game because I volunteered to be dealer.  At some point, Paul had finally arrived back at the apartment.  He and Tim (I think, I had my back to them for the most part) were drinkin' up a good deal.  At another point, Heather disappeared.  Tim went searching for her, and disappeared himself.  Finally Paul went looking for them.  He came back though, saying (well at least I thought he said) he didn't find them.  So I got curious and went looking for them, and found them hugging each other behind the second floor hallway door.  I don't know what that was about, but I high-tailed it out of there.  I reported to Paul my findings, but it was this time around that I heard him say he found them in the same place doing the same thing.  Later, while Tim, Little Dude, & Danielle were watching Slapshot; Paul & Chris were downloading some nasty porn stuff onto Tim's computer.  I was look-out, keeping an eye on Tim to make sure he doesn't come over in the middle of the operation.  Shawn came in to see what was up, Heather followed up the rear.  They were all working on the project when suddenly Tim dropped his beer onto the floor.  Some of it got onto Little Dude's coat and the two of them got up to clean the mess.  I signaled everyone to scatter, so they all jumped over to Paul's computer and pretended they had been there the whole time.  Tim never even cast an eye into the room.  Then, Paul got really drunk that night.  Everyone wanted to attack Paul's crotch for a while.  Tim and Chris kept getting their shots in.  Paul was in pain, he spent a good while curled up on the floor in pain.  I was laughing at him for a while, and then accompanied him on the floor to give him some company.  I thought it would be cool to bring out my tape recorder and record some of the conversations that would happen that night.  But it didn't turn out to well, what with so many people talking at the same time, and of course Wilson constantly talking very loudly.  So drunk that Heather decided to both take advantage of it and aid it.  She always had her arms around him or was sitting in his lap at different points.  We decided to play Indian Poker.  For those of you who have never played, here's a basic strip-down of the rules.  You deal out a card to each player, then you take your card and without looking at it, place it on your forehead.  You can see everyone else's cards, but not your own, and based on that you make a bet if you could beat everyone else.  Now we were playing without chips or money, so it was purely for fun.  Around 2 AM, Michelle arrived at The Apartment, but the party had all but finished at this point.  Everyone was either gone, sleeping, or tending to a very drunk Paul.  But Michelle had a phone call and relocated herself to the then empty room of Tim & Paul's.  Shawn challenged Paul to a sort of punch fight.  He said to Paul I'll punch you once and then you get to punch me once.  But, Paul really wanted to do that.  Shawn kept bragging that if he hit him in this one part of his body, he would pass out immediately.  Paul was overly confident that he could take it because he was a black belt in karate (or something).  Shawn kept hyping that he would do it in such a way that Paul would never get a chance to do his punch back.  I could see the pure masculinity forming in the room.  It was like watching a pissing contest, but without getting The Apartment all wet with urine.  The fear in Heather's eyes was evident, but I didn't care.  They were reverting back to their most basic instincts of humanity.  I was getting a kick out of it, as it was just so primal.  But they had their conscience get the better of them apparently because no one every followed through on the punchfest.  But everyone decided to get Paul down for the night, so a whole group of them grabbed Paul and dragged him into his room.  Michelle was then frustrated as she had to relocated to the kitchen.  But once everyone came back out into the living room, she really didn't have a place to go.  Paul then went into the bathroom and just sat on the floor.  He felt like throwing up and he wanted to be ready for it.  I decided to go and give him some company.  We talked about stuff, then Heather went into the bathroom and sat with him.    Finally, Paul threw up.  He asked everyone to leave the bathroom because he felt very embarassed to have everyone watch him.  I remember I wanted to go check on him and Shawn pushed me away.  That was something that ticked me off.  Chris and I were exchanging a few jokes, the Helen Keller one popped up again.  Michelle made some comment on how that joke isn't funny.  If it wasn't funny, then people wouldn't laugh at it.  God, that girl ticks me off so much, most girls I know do.  They're all a bunch of whiners, complainers, bitchers, and unappreciative people that thinks the world owes them more then what they've worked for.  The number one thing that pisses me off about people is that they think that since the people before them did all this hard work, that changed the way people act and think.  Then there's my generation that doesn't even appreciate   I'm sorry, there's a rant in there somewhere, but I choose not to go into all the details at this time.  I plan on making a webpage that goes more into it.  It's just getting around to doing it.  But I left soon after this.  I watched Chris roll a ball around the cover of a huge bin.  Unproductive, but brain-dead-ingly entertaining.  Yeah, that's right, I just made up my own word!

      I never really know what to write in thie thing, sometimes I just don't have anything of real interest to write.  Nothing really substantial ever happens in my life, and when it does, I pretty much write it down (refer to the Monday entries for Guy's Night these past few weeks).  So, anyway, I write today because of a certain email I recieved today.  Here's how it went:   Hey!  I keep checking back on your blog to see new and exciting updates, but there are none.  I know, I know... you did yours for Thursday, but I want more dammit!  -Paul  So, as the title depicts, this one's for Paul.  I met with Paul late tonight, and I asked him what he wanted to read on my blog.  His answer was a direct and simple one: Big Black Bonners.  So, not to disappoint, I wanted to make sure his dream came true tonight.  I went through my files and found the perfect picture for his needs.  I present to you:      So, I hope I helped deliver him the goods, and what goods they are that got delivered.  I'm tired now, I spent about 30-40 minutes trying to figure out how to get those pictures to display then another 10 getting it just right.  So next time, be sure to watch what you ask for.  Unless you really want what you're asking for...  A little update: there used to be 3 pictures, just a cropping down of the original.  But I decided to take down the other pictures and just leave the main one.  Just wanted to let all of you who read this know that you missed out on some major cock-age.

      Tonight, I'm gonna spent a couple hours looking through some of the tapes I have that I've never taken the time to see what's on them.  They're mostly ones I recieved in trade, others are ones I mark as 'Special' as in TV Specials.  The first tape I'm looking at as I'm making this posting is The A-Team.  I have 5 tapes of it and I've never even seen the show before.  So this is fun, I'm watching a show that was pretty cool back in the day.  It's actually pretty decent.  Not at all like MacGyver crappy.  I remember watching MacGyver and thinking it was so cool.  Then I started to watch it again when it came on TV Land and it was crap.  I couldn't believe that at one time I thought that show rocked.  The Murdoc episodes still kick ass.  Tough fucker.  I'm never gonna buy a jug of apple juice ever again.  I got so sick of it halfway through drinking it.  I just downed the rest in the last 20 minutes, I hated every other minute of it.  Mr. T rules!  Man this guy could kick so much ass!  If I made a movie that had a lot of mild violence, he would be the hero in it.  I remember when I was a kid, Mr. T was so cool.  He's still cool in my mind.  It's kinda like how I used to like Michael Jackson when I was a kid, but the difference is Mr. T didn't become some sideshow freak (with the exception of his role as 'the bearded lady' in the movie Freaked).  Well, after The A-Team tapes, I gotta go over 6 tapes of Thundercats and 7 tapes of Beavis & Butthead.  But there's no way I'm gonna do all that in 1 night, this is gonna be a project held over the next few weeks.  So I have something to look forward to in my free time.  Beats watching the same episodes of South Park over and over and over again.

      But the night didn't end there (If you're just logging on, read the entry below first, this is the continuation of that story).  When I got back to my apartment, I found I had a call from my mother.  I had asked her to give me a call when a package arrived in the mail.  I had made a deal with a guy to send me some Beavis and Butthead tapes and they were expected in sometime this week.  I decided to get them tonight since I was awake and up.  And this trip was probably the most organized I have ever been in planning my return to B'ville.  I boxed up some stuff I didn't want at my apartment anymore to take back with me.  I then made a list of things I wanted to get while I'm there.  So I left and drove back, I got there and helped my mother move all these boxes upstairs so she can move them easier later in the week.  I then loaded up my car with stuff to move over to the new house.  So I went into the house and unloaded the car right away.  I then went downstairs and found that the electricity was out in one section of the basement.  I think it had something to do with the fact they were remodeling the bathroom.  So I spent about 10 minutes: looking for a fuse box, finding nothing wrong with the fusebox, being thankful I had brought a desk lamp with me in this move transition, and even more thankful I found an extension cord laying about.  So I moved all the stuff into the room and half-assed organized it.  It was darker then I would've preferred, and the lighting was harsh on the eyes, so I did a little work and then went home.  I grabbed my stuff there and returned to Madison.  This may not sound all that interesting, but it was great to me!  Man, and to think earlier this week I was so angry at stuff.

      I switched my shift today with another employee, so I had the whole day to myself.  I woke up around 11:30 in the morning and watched the same 2 episodes of South Park.  I was basically burning time until 3, in which Guy's Night was decided to start this week.  The earliest to date.  Well, it got close to 2:30, so I logged offline and started to get ready.  I drove over to The Apartment and found no one there.  It was 2:50 and I just stood around in this kinda awkward silence waiting for someone.  I don't have a cellphone, so I couldn't call to see where anyone is.  On top of that, The Apartment doesn't have any phone as all the current tendents just use cellphones.  So the only choice I really had was to drive back to my apartment and call someone from there.  But while going back to my apartment, I realized that I had forgot to check for any messages before I had left, so this might be on my head.  I arrived back at my apartment at 3:05.  The only message I had was from Paul and it was placed at 2:59, so there would've been no way I could've got that message before I had left.  He explained that he forgot to call me earlier to inform me that he had to fix someone's computer for a while.  So I was pissed.  I decided to torchur Paul if he called to let me know when he's back.  I decided to pass the time by playing 1 1/2 hours of Command and Conquer, a game at which I rule.  After winning 2 games and then getting my ass kicked (non-strategic start position, followed by ill-attempt (meaning pretty much none at all) at building my defense.  I decided to take a quick nap, not knowing when Paul was gonna call.  When he first called, I didn't answer.  I decided to pretend I was sleeping, and he called the second time and I answered.  I was talking like I had just come out of a deep sleep.  Paul felt awkward, or at least I think he did.  I kicked, he believed every minute of it.  I then went back to The Apartment and we started to organize a game.  It was just Paul and me at this time, Smoe was there too, but he wasn't participating.  He was all excited to go out and buy some beads for the Marti Gras celebration tomorrow.  That's right, Smoe wanted to see some boob-age.  Paul and I were playing a game of Magic, he kept getting phone calls.  Finally he put his phone on silent.  I don't remember who won the first game, I'm pretty sure it was Paul.  Chris was on a date with Whitney, so we waited for his arrival.  When he did, we had ordered 2 pizzas from Pizza Hut.  We had a Large 1 Topping Pizza for $6.99, & Good for 6 Uses.  Chris gave us a run-through of their date.  Now, I'm not an expert on dating (far from it actually), but Paul and I thought it was the most random date anyone could go on.  Here's a quick overview (and I mean quick).  Coffee, movie, golfing, her place, mall.  This was all accomplished between 2PM and 5PM (I'll give him 'til 5:15PM just to be fair).  If you ask me, that's the most done on a date in the shortest time I've ever heard.  In all fairness, they only watched 10 minutes of the movie.  Anyway, back to the real night's events.  We then went out to Pegasus Games to buy more Magic cards.  I spent another $30 on 2 decks and 3 boosters.  We then backtracked to Pizza Hut and picked up our pizzas.  Upon returning to The Apartment, we feasted upon the pizza and drank until our hearts exploded.  Then I felt sick.  Nothing I did made it better.  Chris and Paul were surfing the net, while I recouperated.  We then cleared the table and set up for another round of Magic.  We spent quite a while putting together new decks.  Smoe and Tim had left to buy those beads with the promise that when they return, we were playing Monopoly.  We finally had our decks together and I think we played two games.  I don't recall winning either of them.  I know one Paul went out on immediately.  He discarded his entire hand of 7 cards and I had a 2 damage for every card discarded spell.  It pretty much killed him.  I think Paul won the next game, though.  I'm surprised I don't remember, I just remember having fun playing.  Finally, it was time to play Monopoly.  The players: Paul, Timmy, Shawn (a friend of Smoe's), Smoe, myself, and Chris (as the banker).  I started out strong, and for a while, I was ahead by a long shot.  I had a Monopoly, but on a weak side of the board.  But it was pretty much the only developed part of the board, so I was kicking.  Paul went out because he bought property from me for a huge price.  That was his downfall.  Timmy went out next, he hardly had anything.  Chris was soon to follow, only because he had one monopoly (and a very good one at that).  But no one landed on any of his property, they kept landing on the community chest (located between his property) or they moved right over it.  Finally, I made the biggest mistake in the game.  I got cocky, and I made the same mistake Paul did.  I bought property for a price bigger then I could really afford.  I just wanted 2 monopolies, but all of them were on the weakest side of the board.  Everyone was pretty much staying off it.  I lost all my property to Shawn.  Now here's where the game took a twist.  Smoe, who basically barely ever had property, was now by far in the lead.  He had control over one side of the board, and it was working in his favor.  Shawn had control over 3 sides of the board, he owned almost the entire thing.  Yet he wasn't making it work for him.  I think it had something to do with him making a prior deal with Smoe that when he landed on certain spaces, he wouldn't charge him the rent.  I think it was on the most expensive side.  Chris was still active in the game as the banker, and I was bored, so we both took on the role of accountants.  I represented Smoe, Chris represented Shawn.  They just played the game, we handled all transactions.  Soon, Shawn was out of the game, Smoe was the ultimate victor.  It was fun.  Tim was killing Nazis.  Or, it was more like Nazis were killing him.  He had a tough time getting through the game.  Sucker!  Paul, Smoe and Shawn were all talking around the table.  I think it was mostly about cars, so I wasn't involved in it much.  Actually, pretty much not at all.  Chris and I were harassing Josh online, that was fun.  Then Timmy got sick of getting killed all the time and went to bed.  Loser.  Shawn went his way, and Smoe was off to bed.  Chris, Paul and I played a couple more games of Magic.  Paul won the first game, then I seriously kicked it in the last game of the night.  We then lounged around for an hour or two, just letting the night drain away.  Finally, we called it a night and I went home.... (to be continued)

      Misery loves company, yet I like to spent it alone.  It's that time of the year where I hit a low point.  I just don't feel like doing much of anything.  I feel worthless, I feel unloved, I feel depressed.  I don't want to go anywhere, I just want to isolate myself in my home and just wait for this whole thing to go away.  I'm not gonna eat anything until it does either.  I have the next 3 days off too, what a waste.  I wanna die, I just want it all to go away.  I want to be taken out of the element and tossed into oblivion.  Why the fuck do I feel this way!?  Why one minute I'm fine then for the next week or two I'm so very angry and sad?  I wanna crawl into a hole and be buried alive.  I want to suffer.  I want to be dying.  I want to have meaning to my meaningless life.  No one has ideals in the world anymore.  Everyone's a sell out.  Conformity is everyone's idea of living.  Those who still want to be different, unique, special only isolate themselves from the herd.  They grow weak, then sick, then they die.  I wanna die.  My way of life screams for love, all I get is false friends and back stabbers.  Deaf ears and mute words seem to be all I turn up.  I'm going nowhere and I feel like I'm getting there the fastest.  I want things to change, but they only do for the worst.  Death, money, friends, love, hope.  It all turns to shit on me.  I hate people!  I hate everyone!  I hate all those who are so much more happier then I am!  You don't appriciate happiness, you take it for granted!  I work for it, I get none of it.  You treat people like trash, you get respect.  I treated people equally, I got nothing.  I started to treat people the way you did, I didn't care about them in the least.  Now I have more then nothing, I have everyone hating me.  But not for being you, they hate me because I'm still me.  A lesser me now, because I've conformed to your methods.  I lost something that made me who I am, just so I could be something I wasn't.  I wanted to be you.  WHAT MAKES YOU SO GODDAMN SPECIAL!!??  Why do your mind games work on the innocent?  You take all that is good and turn it into shit!  You take so much beauty out of this world and make it into this bi-product that once used to mean something.  Why do you not care about those you hurt?  Do you not see the pain you cause them?  How can you be so callus?  Why do you not think about anyone other then yourself?  WHY, WHY, WHY!?!?  FUCK YOU!!  FUCK THE WHOLE LOT OF YA!!  I'LL GO AWAY AND I'LL NO LONGER COMPLICATE YOUR LIFE!!  Who am I kidding, I'm already dead and gone.  I might as well be.

      I decided that I'm gonna write about websites.  Just random websites that I happen upon while writing this.   urlLink http://www.schober.com   I put this one in first, and it's a German website.  I saved one of the pictures, I'll just stick it somewhere on my current website as a joke.  Wish I could read it, so I could report what it is.   urlLink http://www.hell.com   Nothing Stays The Same.  That's a cool intro to the site.  But there's not much else.  It seems to be a search engine that's powered by google, but google doesn't work on my computer, therefore the site doesn't work on my computer.   urlLink http://www.privatehell.com   This looks like it would've been a cool website, but there's nothing on it!  Well, there's something on it, but all it is is a pre-made webpage template that you just write over the old text.  I coulda used that website better then that person did.  I better see improvements in the future.   urlLink http://www.justin.com   Okay, this is the first really cool site to have found.  It's all about the name Justin.  I mean, literally, it's pretty much just about the name.  Everything you didn't know about the name you can learn about it here at justin.com!  I'm so coming back here again!  Ooooooh, that is so flippin' cool.  For those of you who want to check out Justin.com, go to the webcam and just run your cursor over the image.  I'm so trippin' over that experience!   urlLink http://www.omega.com   Some business site about some business product.  Didn't look interesting enough for me, so I'm moving on.  Sorry I wasted time not only looking, but writing about the disappointment.   urlLink http://www.omegaredd.com   Okay, now I'm jealous and pissed.  This was supposed to be  my  online atlernate persona.  Now I find that there's someone else who's using the same name as I!?  Dammit!  Oh well, I'll give this guy some credit, he's out making the name work for him.  I just made up the name (or so I thought) and just use it.  He's a musician, hip hop it looks like.  He has an album circulating on the street titled "Y'all done Fucked up Now".  And, thanks to this website, I now have a new nic-name for Paul: 'PL' for 'Paul Love'.  Wait, that sounds kinda gay.  Maybe I should just stick with Paul.  From the best I can tell, this guy has his own domain, but all his stuff loads from geocities.  Strange.   urlLink http://www.pizza.com   Nothing here, just a guy offering the website for sale/rent.  What a disappointment.   urlLink http://www.innerear.com   I actually didn't expect anything to pop up when I typed this one in, but it produced some sorta doctor's website.  I'm betting it relates to ears (didn't read into it).   urlLink http://www.dirtyshirt.com   Again, a website I didn't expect to find anything at.  It didn't look intersting, but since I found it, I'm just gonna copy and paste the website's purpose below:  Dirtyshirt Adventures is an outdoor activity social club coordinating trips and instruction rock climbing, paddling and hiking.  Typically, the participant is responsible for transportation and equipment unless otherwise noted.  Safety is always the highest priority and all proper safety equipment is utilized.  Every participant can expect an adventurous, challenging and personally rewarding experience.    urlLink http://www.trashcan.com   This is a cool website, but there's once again nothing on it!  It's just a title with picture, and a picture that links who the artist of the picture is.  That's it.  Wish there was more because what little I see here is pretty cool.   urlLink http://www.godseye.com   This one is pretty simple, but I like the picture when it loads.  It's like a birds-eye (or, as the webname dictates, god's eye) view of this city.   urlLink http://www.blanktape.com   This is a pretty cool site.  Beings as I use a lot of blank tapes in my day (referring to my growing tape collection found at my  urlLink Tape Trading Page ).  I'll have to stop by here again when I have time and see what's new.  Would like to apologize, I originally posted it as blanktapes.com, but that one is an Earthlink site that's 'coming soon'.   FAILURES : Websites that when typed in didn't produce any results.  nailclipper.com - produced an ad search oldsocks.com - Forbidden webpage pictures.com - Search engine, not a website ceiling.com - Nothing notebook.com - directed me to some bank website shelves.com - same result as nailclipper.com earhair.com - Network Solutions website armpit.com - A casino search engine... wait a minute... lickingtounge.com - Nothing lightsocket.com - Nothing eatbugs.com - Nothing bottlerocket.com - Nothing sockdrawer.com - Nothing wienieman.com - Nothing theapartment.com - This would be a cool website to have that and... theschober.com - Nuff said carcrash.com - same result as shelves.com kickass.com - Nothing lookatme.com - redirects you to "http://www.geocities.com/hostster/99/" but nothing there. paperorplastic.com - Forbidden godssleepy.com - Nothing godsbadday.com - Nothing   Well, that was fun.  Maybe you enjoyed it too.  Maybe you didn't, but if that was the case, then why didn't you just skip over this entry?  I don't want any excuses!  Anyway, hopefully I'll do this often.  It's something to do on a rainy day.  It's like web browsing but with more fun and critisizing.  Maybe I'll make a webpage about doing this.  Either way, I'll post it here, either in detail or about updates on the webpage.

      I guess now would be the best time to bring up a little side story.  Around New Year's, Paul and I wrote our New Year's Resolutions.  We decided to write an equal number of them, and then hold each other to those resolutions.  Anyway, Paul just posted his on his blog, so I'm doing the same because I'm not feeling very original at this moment.  1.) Pay off credit card bill  I have only 1 credit card, and I'm always maxing it out.  Thing is, I just have a tendency to flash-spend my money.  So, I'm gonna pay it off, then try to keep it paid off.  That will be the replacement resolution for this one once it's achieved.  2.) Savings account of $500  As I mentioned in an earlier entry, I had a Reserve Fund that I always had to fall on in case of emergencies.  Well, since I got myself into a mess and didn't have one to fall back on, now I'm fucked.  So it's best if I get this one achieved before it happens again.  3.) Theater (attending more theatrical preformances)  Paul and I decided to get more cultured, so we're gonna go see more plays.  Pretty much self-explainatory.  4.) No Fast Food  This one is just to see if I can do it.  But it's also the one that gets tested frequently.  We debate about what's fast food and what's not.  Now, you can bitch all you contrary to what I'm gonna say, but we decided that fast food is anything that's prepared seconds after it's ordered.  Now, I'm not doing it for health reasons, which people always associate with this.  So just because something's fatty doesn't automatically make it fast food.  If I eat a burger at my home, it's better then the burger at McDonalds.  Anyway, I lost my footing a couple times, but not in severe cases.  Here's what I did:  1) 3 fries from McDonalds, offered to me by a co-worker 2) Biscuit from KFC.  Other then those, I'm all good.  5.) No Delieveries (to the theater)  It originally was just gonna be 'No Deliveries,' but we decided to add the theater part because if I'm over at a friend's place, deliveries would be okay.  Plus, I used to order a lot of food delivered to the theater.  In 2002, I did the math and figured that I bought over $2000 for of delivery food.  This is why I decided to cut back.  6.) Write One Script  I always have a lot of ideas running through my head, and I share them with other people.  But actually putting them down in writing is another thing.  So I'm gonna try to put an effort into at least one.  7.) Vacation Out Of State  I have been wanting to get out of Wisconsin for a while, just to go somewhere else.  Not to leave and never come back, but to go for the sake of going.  Seeing someplace else.  It's like living outside the box.  But sadly, I don't see this one being achieved.  I don't really like going away to places I'm not familiar with without some friends.  An I don't really see people wanting to go far away with me.  But I have the whole year to think about it.  8.) Lose Weight  This one would be easy to report on, but here's the thing.  I haven't weighed myself yet this year, so I have no real 'start weight'.  So, as soon as I get this information, I'll keep you posted.   So, that's the list.  I'll keep you updated on it's progress as the year goes on.

      Not much of a post tonight.  I just got back from watching Texas Chainsaw Massacre.  I didn't expect it to be much, so when I actually watched it I wasn't disappointed.  It was made pretty well, but I'm not gonna run out and buy it anytime soon.  I wanna make my own scary movie, but in my opinion, to make a truely good scary movie, you need to plan out everything in every detail.  That's my dream project, to truely make a great movie that would scare the shit out of groups of people.  Some people just can't be scared, but to get a majority of them, that's a feat.  I should take the time tonight to figure out some details for that project.

      We went to the Dry Bean the other day.  There was a $7 cover charge, which I thought was ridiculous.  The price, not the actual charge.  Anyway, I had $24 on me (a $20 and 4 $1 bills).  So I gave the guy the $20 and 2 $1 bills.  For those of you who are lost at this point, you're in the same catagory as this guy was.  The guy stared at the money I had given him, then handed the 2 $1's back.  I took the money, then handed it back to him saying 'I want you to give me $15 dollars back'.  What the Hell is wrong with people?  Math isn't that hard of a thing to understand.  It's logic!  Common Sense!  If you can count to ten, you can do any form of math.  Just fuckin' apply yourselves!  I'm remembering High School (where the winners grow, fight, and on occassion breed).  All those people who said they hated math class and didn't get accounting.  Those two classes to me were easier ones to tackle.  Now if you feed me that bullshit that some people just get it better then others, that's bullshit!  I don't care how hard it is to learn, the hard fact is YOU  CAN  LEARN!!  All you have to do is find a way to make it make sense to you.  If you just say 'I can't', I want you to go down to a river and drown.  You're useless to me, and I don't want you near me.  You lack thought, and you suck.  That's my rant, and I know it's controversial.  But so what, I want those stupid fuckers out of my world.  I want common sense to be #1 in America.  I want people to appreciate their intellectual potential.  If you don't go out into the world and learn something today, I hope you rot in Hell.

      I was originally gonna put this on the previous post, but I decided halfway through writing it to just make it a seperate one.  This is for those of you wondering what happened to the 'reserve fund' I mentioned in the previous post.  It happened back in November, the day before Veteran's Day (the 10th).   I had returned from B'ville and did a 'quick stop' at the theater before I went back to my apartment.  My visit took longer then I had originally planned.  Anyway, since my return from B'ville, I had unknowingly left my passenger door unlocked.  While I was away, some FUCKER went into my car and stole my backpack.  In it was practically my entire life.  Books with ideas, a planner with my checking accounts and savings accounts, a picture of Sarah.  Basically, there was a lot of things in there I didn't want to lose.  I spent all night looking for it, mostly in dumpsters located in a 4 block radius from the theater.  It was not fun, and it was a very emotional night for me.  The next day, I couldn't close the accounts because it was Veteran's Day so the banks were closed.  When I did, I decided to just put everything into one account.  Today, this has cost me more then I ever concidered (because I'm practically broke).  The only thing that's going to help are 3 (or 4) things: Federal & State tax returns, moving in with other people thus cutting back on expenses, my annual raise, and (this is the unsure possiblility) my grandpa's inheritance.  But all these things are futher down the road then what I would like them to be.

      I never really minded paying bills.  To me, it's kinda like I'm conducting business with various companies on a personal level.  Makes me feel like the entrepreneur of my own life.  Sure, it depleates the revenue (my salary), but that's the whole cost of the creature comforts that befit my home.  Right now, I'm kinda in a bind.  Remember when I wrote about my car accident (going in the ditch)?  Well, that set me back.  See, every 5-6 months there's 3 pay dates for the current month (For example, this year there's 3 of those kind of months: Jan. 2, 16, 30; July. 2, 16, 30; Dec. 3, 17, 31).  Anyway, when those months come along, it's usually time to pay the car insurace bill.  So that 'extra check' pretty much goes into paying for that.  Well, I don't have to draw this one for you.  The $300 sum dollars I spent then was supposed to be the car insurance payment.  Now, I have no reserve fund anymore (read next post for details), so all the money has to be scraped together with money I was going to use in the future.  It's not favorable in the least.  So, that's where I'm at.  I'm gonna weigh my options for a while, then make a decision.  There's 2 choices I can make, neither of them are completely favorable.  I won't share, this my little problem.

      I learned how to play Magic The Gathering tonight.  Paul & Chris taught me.  The game they trained me on lasted longer then games normally last.  But Paul prevailed.  The first game I played, I used one of Chris's decks.  We played for a while, then Chris got out.  He went and played Wolfenstein until Paul and I finished.  I won in the end.  We played again, this time I used one of Paul's decks.  Paul quickly slapped together a new deck for him to use.  We played, and I was bullying Paul.  He went out first, and then went to do homework while Chris and I finished.  However, Paul never started doing homework, he instead started listening to music.  Me and Chris played until I won.  We then took a break to play some Wolfenstein.  Timmy got home and we just watched Chris play the game.  Then Chris wasted all the ammo and saved it on TIm's file.  I secretly wanted to lose a game, so I played against Paul one last time.  I choose the same deck I had last time (Paul's).  We played, and Paul got all these good cards and murdered me.  I had nothing.  I think my luck was tainted because Chris was helping me (heh heh).  I wanna go buy some more decks, now.  But I first have to find a place that sells them.  I thought Pegasus Games would, but Chris and Paul told me that they all only sell in pre-arranged decks.  That's lame.  I wanna get decks that are totally random.  Until then, I live on in shame.

      Between 4 and 9 AM, I spent the whole time moving things from my room in my mother's house to my new room in my mother's new house which she inherited from her recently deceased father.  I have to say, it turned out to be more fun then I expected it to be.  I'm only moving things into this small walk-in-closet-esque room.  In there, I'm going to make a sort of archive room where I store all my stuff.  My many magazines, collecting cards, video game consoles, Compiter CDs, books, comic books, celebrity pictures, porn, beta tapes, old cassettes (they still make those?), TV Guides, issues of The Onion. and much much more.  Did I say porn in there?  Man, that's funny.  I made 4 trips back and forth, each time filling my backseat, trunk and passenger seat.  I was surprised by how much I cleared out of my original room and got over there  and made it all fit in that small room .  I have to give a lot of the credit to the shelving system I so love.  Shelves Rock!  The biggest accomplishment was getting the make-shift shelf my mother had set up in my old room to fit on one side of the small room.  I was skeptical, it seemed too big to fit length-wise.  But it just made it.  The shelf is made up of a few wooden boards and milk crates.  I wonder if there's a store that just sells shelves.  That would be so cool.  In the end, I thought it was a real accomplishment.  The room is incomplete, need more milk crates and boards.  Once I get those things, I could really make the room supreme!  I can't move much else, the furniture has to wait for new carpeting to be put down first (the small room's carpeting was fine, so that's why I concentrated on moving everything in just that room).  Will let you know about what happens to it in the future.

      I didn't post on Monday, so I feel guilty.  Here's the new post:  Guy's Night wasn't the usual Monday Night.  There was no Texas Hold'em, but we still entertained ourselves.  Upon arrival, Chris and Paul were looking at video clips from  urlLink eBaum's World .  It had various items on there, like a bunch of guys pulling a car out of the snowbank only to tear out the entire trunk of the car, a wrestler chick that gets her top completely ripped off, and a real old video of Vin Diesel (then Mark Vincent) doing a video on breakdancing.  Chris was playing Return to Castle Wolfenstein, kicking some woman ass!  The level he was playing required him to take out an entire 'elite squad' of super women, clad in black non-the-less.  Then he had to kill a super boss that wasn't all that super.  Tim arrived finally with a vacuum cleaner (hes gonna be sleeping happy tonight!).  Paul started to cook a pizza and we decided to go get some Mt. Dew and bread.  Paul had to make a quick stop over at their landlord to pay their already late rent (10 days isn't bad).  We all piled in Chris's car and drove over to Woodman's.  In the parking lot, we drove to an empty area and threw on the emergency break and almost collided into a cart rack.  Inside, we got the Dew and pretty much forgot about the bread.  I bought some pens and a notebook.  The notebook was all I planned on buying, but when I saw the pens I've been meaning to buy for months now, I decided to buy them too.  We then drove through the parking lot at Sam's Club to find Little Dude's truck, but we didn't see it.  Even though he told Chris and Paul that he had to work tonight.  Paul then called him to see what the deal was and he was busted!  Someone was making a booty-call a higher priority then work.  He's so fired.  We had reached The Apartment, and decided to race down the incomplete street section and slide to a stop.  The first time was fun, but then we got the idea of calling Tim.  The original plan was to say we were stuck at the bottom of the hill and if he could see us.  When he looked out the window, we would come barreling down the road and slide to a stop once again.  But we got impatient and went ahead and did it again without him looking.  We looked up at The Apartment window just as he was pulling the blinds to the side.  We decided to do it again, just so he could see it.  So we raced back up the hill and came barreling down for the third and last time.  We slid to a stop and got a little stuck, but it was easy to push the car free.  Tim claims he saw sparks fly on the last time.  We ended the night with a little pizza and soda.  Soon, the three of us (Paul, Chris, and I) got into debate about time travel, evolution, and genetics.  It was fun, and I wished I had recorded the conversation as a lot of good points were made.  I could drum up some excerpts, but the complete idea would be taken out of context.  Then we called it a night and I set out for B'ville... (see next post)

      Today, at the theater, we implemented a sting operation.  Some kids came in today with a guy who was clearly not a parent of any of them.  He said he was going to just buy a ticket for the kids and let them go see Gothika (rated R).  We don't subscribe to the rule of 'as long as the parents buy' policy.  Mostly because we have a lot of neglagent parents who just drop their kids off for the next 5 hours to entertain themselves at the expense of the working staff.  Babysitters without the baby-sitting fee, how can some deadbeat parent not pass that up?  So anyway, the parents are either with them or they don't watch the movie.  So our cashier, Steve, told them this.  They all left to decide what to do.  The kds then came into the theater and bought tickets for Elf, which had started 5 minutes ago.  They all bought concessions then went into the game room, which seemed odd.  Odd, unless you have already guessed that they're agenda of theater hopping.  Steve kept his eye on them and eventually the kids went in the Elf auditorium.  But after a while, two of the kids decided to venture back to the game room.  I was talking to Steve and we both guessed the kids were going to try to pull a fast one by us and sneak into the theater.  We kept a sharp eye on them for a while.  They kept nonchalantly looking out into the lobby at us, but they even did a bad job of doing that.  Finally, Steve suggested that I go into the auditorium and wait for them in there.  I then suggested Tim, which prompted Steve to want to do it himself.  So Tim and I stayed in the box office, Tim watched them out of the corner of his eye while I kept my back to everything.  Steve made his way back into the concession stand and into the scullery (which leads back out into the lobby by where Gothika is playing).  Tim was doing commentary, telling me that the kids have moved from the game room and are now 'admiring posters', which lead down to the theater.  Then, they entered the theater.  Steve heard the auditorium doors open and came out of the scullery and walked in right behind them.  When he got in there, the kids darted for a seat and tried to act like they have been in there the whole time.  Steve walked over to them and asked to see their ticket.  Caught in their own lie, the kids acted like they were looking for a ticket and tehn said 'I think we threw them away.'  Steve then reminded them that he had sold them a ticket to Elf, so either go back to that movie or get out of the theater all together.  Me and Tim were still at the box office.  The two boys came walking out, heads hung down in shame.  They walked all the way back to the Elf theater.  Steve came over to us and we all laughed at their pity attempt to trick the masters of the Market Square Theater!    Second Story    After the incident, me and Steve were swapping other stories of catching people doing things around the theater.  Steve recalled a day when two asian people (nationality doesn't matter, but there's a part of the story that it's crucial to know this) came into the theater to see a movie.  They set two big McDonald's bags on the counter and started to fish for their money.  Being this blatant about the fact they're bringing food into the theater, Steve informed them that this was not allowed.  The two then started talking to each other in their native tounge (see, I told you).  The woman bought her ticket and the man went back outside and kinda walked off to the side, even though Steve had observed earlier that they had originated from the other side of the parking lot.  He knew they were up to something, but it started to get busy and he couldn't go police them.  Turned out, she was letting him in the side door, where people go out at the end of the movie.  Luckily, our projectionist was coming down from the projection booth after starting a movie to close the doors and caught the two in the act.  She then escorted them back to the box office, where Steve confirmed that he had barred the entrance of the food earlier.  The two were then asked to leave, and no refund was given.    Third Story    There was a time when we had Not Another Teen Movie and we were told to keep an eye on it.  One day, three kids bought tickets for the movie next to it (Behind Enemy Lines).  I knew what they were up to.  I went and stood in the auditorium and waited.  Two of the kids came back first, and they saw me right away and went into the right movie.  The third had bought concessions, so he was a little behind the rest of them.  He came around the corner and saw his two friends in the  wrong  movie and said 'What are you guys doing?  Our movie's over here'.  He then saw me waiting for him and he did a major curve back to the  right  movie.

      I worked today at the theater.  The day was going along nicely paced, and then I had to fix a small problem.  While I was working on it, an employee said a customer wanted to talk to me.  I said I'll be down as soon as I'm done fixing what I was working on.  They then informed me that it was regarding my car.  So now I'm wondering if they had hit my car or if I had done something wrong with my car.  Anyway, I got downstairs and I looked around for someone waiting for me.  I glance out to my car and see nothing wrong with it.  I asked the employee where the person went.  Apparently the person was going to the movie 'The Cooler'.  So I wandered over to the door and didn't see anyone.  I started to walk back when this lady came out of the auditorium and asked if I was the manager.  I told her I was.  Then, she got very smug.  She started off by saying something to the effect of 'You did something very very unthoughful.'  Right away, I was thinking 'dear god, she's being over dramatic.'  The story was she couldn't get in her car because my car was parked too close to hers. Then she had to go around to the passenger's side and that didn't work, so she had to climb through the hatch in the back.  I didn't really get the whole story because I was tuning her out.  She then went on to say that she's 60-something and couldn't get around as well as she used to.  I can agree with this, my own mother can't get around as well as she used to.  I then made a comment that with the recent snowfall the parking stalls are affected, so it's harder to fit into certain places.  This didn't sit well with her, as she went off on a rant about how there's dozens of other places for me to park, I didn't have to park where I was.  I like how people talk about things as if it's possible to go back and change actions.  How they describe all the possible things one could've done, and then return to what was done.  Do we ever really take in how much could've been done?  No, we just do what we need to do at that moment.  On top of it all, if it was really a problem, she could've come back into the theater and asked an employee if they knew whose car was parked up next to hers adn then lucked out when it was pointed out to be mine.  Why didn't she do that?  I guess this drumming up the past thing doesn't work.  Now, don't get me wrong, she had a legitimate reason for being angry.  But she handled her arguement with aggression, bullying, and a hint of condescension.  This I don't (and won't) stand for.  So, I quickly start to counteract it.  I smirk, I laugh inappropriately, and I even tend to let my eyes wander.  But also, I'm in my work enviroment, so I have to becareful how I portray myself as it could be taken as a reflection of business practice.  Overall, no one should ever be automatically angry at a person.  There should be a grey area that can lead the conversation to the extreme emotions.  You know what I mean?  Angry people are (in my opinion) worthless.  They don't contribute to anything, they just make the world a tougher place.  So in the end:  Fuck her!

      I don't care if it's controversial or whatever.   Art is meant to be shared, so what the Hell is wrong with sharing music online?  I don't care if Lars Ulrich is not getting his $1,000,000 from all the people in the world who want to hear just one, JUST ONE, song on their whole album.  You know, not everyone likes just one band and all their crappy songs.  People have ecclectic tastes, they need to mix songs to fit their personalities.  Dick Clark once said 'Music is the soundtrack of our lives.'  And I agree, that's why we have to mix it up a little.  Analogy time: Art Museums have free admission (as far as I know, all Art Museums are) Van Gogh doesn't ask for $10 every time someone looks at his paintings.  Most art museums will ask for donations, but donations are completely up to the patrons.  See, that's how I view the art.  If you like an artist, you buy their album.  You support the arts, you support the artists.  If you suck as an artist, but have one good piece of work, why do I need to buy an overpriced album with that good piece of work with 10 other bad songs?  Maybe I wanna sample all your work before running out and buying it.  Welcome to real life, the world of the straving artist.  This is what art should be about.  Pouring all your time and effort to make a work of art that really speaks to people.  Then, hope it really does something, sparks a revolution, or just makes at least one person feel good.  Besides, forget the millionaire artist who's ass-raping the wanting public.  What about the smaller people who are struggling, garage band musicians?  If they make some of their work into music and put it online, it can spread like wildfire.  Everyone's an artist of some sort, you just need to find your calling and excel at it.  To be a greedy fucker is just wrong.  Movies are somewhat the same thing.  I work at a movie theater, and if there's anything that's truely sad is that fact that a lot of hack writers / directors seem to be making a lot of movies that don't speak to anyone, or a very small group.  See, that's the problems with distributors, they have a general market that they're always trying to appeal to.  Some movies do better in some places then others.  But this is a little off topic.  That's my 5 cents.  This one may change over time, but I've said my piece for now.

      Well, I had a story for last night, but it was before the ditch incident.  So, I would like to use tonight's entry to tell that story.  Monday Night is now Guy's Night.  We decided to change it to that title because we sometimes play pool or other activities besides cards.  So we started out the night watching Storm of the Century (which we all know I finished watching the next morning).  Then Paul and I made a run to Oregon (Paul is a much better driver in snowy conditions, btw).  Upon returning, we then started playing Texas Hold'em.  Tim really sucked that night.  For the first 3 rounds he got out on the second hand dealt.  Showed him for going all in right away.  It was more or less Paul's and my night, Paul started out with a winning streak, but it soon proved to be short lasting.  Soon, Paul was the first player going out and 1 round ended with me going out first.  Anyway, here's my story.  I was dealt a Ace of hearts and a Jack of hearts.  The first 3 of the community cards were 2 (unimportant) cards and the King of hearts.  The next card turned up was the Queen of hearts.  At this point, I was thinking to myself 'I have a possible straight if the next card is a 10'.  Then it dawned on me, if the next card is a 10 of hearts, I have a royal flush.  But I thought the odds are too great for that to happen.  Then the 10 of hearts was turned up.  I remember a surge of excitement racing through me, but I didn't make any real movements.  I may have raised my eyebrow, as I half-unknowingly tend to do.  I had a hand that has the odds of 1 in 30,940.  But the hand was hardly worth having since Tim folded immediately.  Between Paul and me, I tried to bluff my way.  But I got over confident and went 'all in', which tipped Paul off that I had a really good hand compared to his.  I think I just won 32 chips out of the whole thing.  But I still had a Royal Flush.  There's a side of this story I almost ommited, but I ethically am deciding to keep it in.  After the game playing was done, I counted the cards before putting them away, like I always do.  I came up with 51.  I counted again, again 51.  I asked Paul if he has seen any cards on the floor.  He looked around and then grabbed the card box.  Inside was the 9 of hearts.  I immediately realized that technically the Royal Flush I had was in reality supposed to be concidered a 'dead hand' because we weren't playing with a full deck.  But to me, it was the idea that counts.   Quote of the Night:  You can't whistle with crackers in your mouth. (there's a story to that, but I'm not going to tell that one on here).   Last Night's Epilogue:   For all those wondering, I did get out of the ditch.  I called them around 8:15, he came and got me at 9:15.  We spent a while pulling the car out.  The tow-guy started to pull me out of the ditch when his cell phone rang.  He was talking on it and not paying attention to what was going on behind him.  He pulled my car to literally a foot within a road sign post.  He took this simple job and just made it into a hassel.  Fucker charged me for the whole time he spent fixing the problem he himself further complicated, too.  The towing was $105.50.  I wanted it towed to my preferred service station for a good checking for problems I created during this whole incident.  I bent the rims and I made the decision to replace it.  Total: $203.72.  Overall spending: $309.22.  That amount of money was supposed to be spent on my car insurance (liability, for those of you wondering), but now I have to scrounge up money for that another way.

      Well, I finally did it.  The annual 'Schober in the Ditch' festivities.  Like last year, I over-confidently drove down the road on my way to B'ville.  But unlike last year, I didn't have a phone to call for help with.  Let's start at the beginning, which I've learned is the best place to start stories.  I was driving down CTY M, following the path the plows had made.  But plows make paths that dip into medians.  This I found out in a fraction of a second.  I started to pump the break, but this was futile to even attempt to do.  The rest of the trip, I was just there for the ride.  My car jumped over the median, landed back on the road, spun completely around and slid into the ditch and almost (but thankfully not) rolled over.  My car came to rest at a surprising 45 degree angle and I was afraid the slightest thing was going to tip it the rest of the way.  After sitting there for a second taking all what happened in (and man that was a lot to suddenly be taking in), I got out of my car and climbed out of the ditch.  I had hit the median pretty hard, so I was worried that parts of my car had come loose and / or broken off.  I got onto the road and immediately saw two things laying on ground.  But upon closer examination, I discovered it was just a road cone which I had ripped in two.  I stood there on the empty road pondering what to do.  I had heard before that you shouldn't leave an accident until you talk to an official of some sort.  So I stood there wondering if I should just wait for someone or start walking.  Thankfully, I was a hop, skip, and a jump away from Timmy & Paul's apartment (emphasis on extended hops, skips and jumps), so I had somewhere close to go.  A truck with a plow was finally headed my way.  I stood on the median to see if he would stop to help me.  The fucker just flew by me.  I watched him get further away, wondering if he at some point was going to turn around and get me on the way back.  No luck.  I once again waited, unsure of what to do.  Finally, a city transportation plow started to head my way.  This guy stopped.  I was thankful, up until i heard his first words to me 'Dude, you hit my cone!'  From that, I was just apprecitive that he stopped.  I had asked him about my concern that I had to wait at the accident site was just and he said 'I think it's okay, unless you've been drinking.'  I assured him that since I don't drink, I don't think that's going to be a problem.  He then asked if I had a phone and I replied no.  I never got a cellphone, but when I hopefully move I will get one.  He then offered me a ride, provided it wasn't too far.  I just asked him to take me to the stoplights just down the road.  I just wanted to be off the main traffic street and onto a sort of backroad.  He then took me there.  I walked all the way to The Apartment, thinking to myself how awkward and embarassing it's going to be to wake everyone up to help me out just because they're closer to where I went in the ditch.  Then I was trying to figure out how I'm going to handle everything.  I had to call my brother-in-law (Russ) for advice, had to somehow get my laundry cleaned, and I had to (any guesses?  Time's up)... get my car out of the ditch.  After the whole hiking was over, I arrived at The Apartment.  I walked up the stairs and entered.  I was surprised to see Paul still up, saving me the embarassment of waking him up this early in the morning.  He lent me his phone to call Russ, who told me to call a towing service, but to be aware that towing in the night is going to cost a lot of money.  Paul looked up a bunch of numbers online, I choose Smart Motors.  My mother had recommended them in the past, but Russ said Mike's Towing.  We went with Smart Motors.  I had to call again at 7 in the morning, which was his business time.  Otherwise, as Russ had said, it was gonna cost more.  Paul then offered to take me back to my car to get my laundry and offered their machine to do all the cleaning with.  We drove out there and retrieved the clothes, then headed back.  I kept thanking him the whole time, especially concidering the fact that he had to go to school at 11 in the morning (maybe earlier?).  So here I sit now, Paul had lent me his computer for the night.  He's a great guy for helping me so much.  I'm staying at The Apartment for the night, gonna watch The Perfect Storm, dispite the fact that I'm somewhat tired right now.  I don't wanna fall asleep, because there's no way for me to wake up on my own.  I want to get that car out of the ditch before it gets ridiculously busy on the roads.  People drive crazy, you know.  So that's my story.  Hopefully, by this time next year, I'll have my own washer & dryer where I am living.  This will help me in avoiding those trips that help me do my laundry cheaply (my current laundry facilities cost money to use) and keeping me out of ditches.

      I decided that once a week, I'll take a break from writing in this thing.  Doing it everyday is hard enough as it is, so a day off would be good mentally.  Anyway, I write today about the Super Bowl.  Hasn't it gotten too commercial?  It's hardly about the game unless you it's your hometeam playing.  And that's only two states every year.  The rest of us watch for the love of the game or the commercial aspects of it.  Me and my co-workers were watching the half-time show, and we couldn't help but notice that all the songs were from years past.  I'm not current on today's music as is (I don't listen to the radio), but I knew all those songs they were singing, meaning these songs were old enough for me to know them.  I have nothing against the singers, I like P-Diddy and Janet Jackson (and yes, even Justin Timberlake).  Not enough to want to just rush out and buy all their albums, but not put off enough to turn off the TV when they pop up on the screen.  Me and Jon were commenting on the halftime show, and how really annoying it was to drag all this stuff onto the field, have them preform, then drag it all off again.  And during the second half, we noticed there was a thin layer of fog that kinda lingered on the field.  That somehow has to affect the players and the overall game play.  If you want to know why the game gets more interesting, that's because pyrotechnics and it's residue are affecting game play.  Anyway, the commercials are pretty much what people really watch the Super Bowl for every year.  The witty ones make us laugh and we talk about them.  Personally, everytime I talk about one of the commercials, I never really remember the product.  My favorite commercial didn't even air during the Super Bowl (at least, I didn't see it in the sections I watched).  It's the Pepsi commercial with the girl in the hot dog costume handing out fliers, and she is walking down the street and she meets a cute boy in a pepsi costume.  And in the backround, Blind Melon's 'No Rain' is playing.  That's the greatest commercial EVER!!  I want a copy of that commercial.  Hot dogs like Pepsi, Pepsi likes hot dogs.

      Paul emailed me this morning demanding that I write more, so I wrote this little update.  Well, it's official - I'm moving into The Apartment.  We moved the entertainment center in and I hooked everything up.  It's a kinda complicated system, but once you get used to it, it's gonna be alright.  Then we watched The Rundown followed by some fun rounds of Magic.  Since I've moved furnature out, a lot of things I had resting on them are now laying all about the floor in piles.  I spent a good portion of last night putting things in boxes to be taken home and sorted out.  I'm such a pack rat, it's just silly.  Gonna move just a little at a time.    Yesterday when I woke up, I finally balanced my checkbook.  I recieved my statement a few days ago, but never took the time to check it.  Turns out I had $20 more in the account.  Would've been $30, but I forgot about a $10 cash withdrawl I made about a month ago.  The $20 is from 3 things: 1) the ending balance in my old savings account, $1.00.  2) the ending balance in my $3.62.  3) The Whopper: $27.49.  I accidently thought I charged it to my checking account, when I acutally charged it to my credit card.  So I debited the wrong account.  It's always a pleasent surprise to find more money in an account then you expected.  What I'm not happy about is that my credit card.  It's over drawn by $59.  That seriously pisses me off.  I just sent $100 to keep the bill collectors at bay until my tax return, now this.  I kept trying to think of what would've shot the bill up so high.  It wasn't until last night when I think I pin pointed it.   Market Plaza .  My mom told me about this offer that was sent to her home that was for me.  She read on there that it says 'If you don't call and cancel the offer, we'll bill you automatically.'  My mom seriously hates it when people do that.  She had a bad experience.  I'm working on my artifacts deck.  I'm almost finished.  What I can't get right away, I'm gonna send away for at  urlLink abugames.com .  I also decided to try and collect the entire Mirrodin card series in foil.  A nice little hobby.  I also was trying to keep an eye on the inventory of my cards, but I fell off the horse and pretty much have to go back and sort everything out again.  I gave a few cards away and I got a bunch of new cards.  Oh well, it's not the end of the world, but it was nice when it lasted.  I assure everyone that once I'm moved, they'll more then likely be more frequent updates.

      I recently borrowed Timmy's PS1, with the mini-screen.  I didn't know what to play on it, so I played a little Command and Conquer at first.  Boring.  Then I tossed in the Resident Evil games.  Played them.  Then I threw in Final Fantasy Tactics, a game I never really finished, but I did get through the whole games by myself.  It's fun, a little game you play on a little screen and it seems viturally cordless (even though you have to plug it in still).  It's just so compact and tiny.  So, that's how I've been passing my time these days.

      There was a time when I used to believe in the expression 'A Good Day's Work Earns A Good Day's Pay.'  I used to work for A Dick, his name was Duke Goetz.  He operates the Goetz Theaters in Monroe, WI.  I list all this information on here because if you ever want to see what a real Dick looks like (virgins, sorry to disappoint if you stumbled onto this website looking for a 'real' dick) go to the Goetz Theater in Monroe, WI.  That's the Goetz Theater in Monroe, WI.  Goetz was not a people person.  He belittled his employees, but not for his own sick amusement, but because he knew in his blackest of hearts that he was better then God himself.  Actually, there was an upside of the 'Goetz Experience.'  The Head Manager.  His name was Gerry, and he ruled.  Gerry grew up in the same town as me, so we knew each other's families.  Gerry was the definition of 'hard worker.'  Without him, in my opinion, there was no Goetz Theater.  The theater would just be another shitty theater located in Boondocks, WI.  Then I went to work for Star Cinemas in Madison.  I was a janitor there.  Why a janitor, you ask?  Because I half wanted to take a break from the customer service aspect of the theater business and half because of something my father told me when I was gorwing up.  It will always stick with me, and it's helped me be a better manager:  "When you hire someone new, make them clean the toilets sometime soon after they start.  You can tell everything about a person by doing this.  If they obliged and do the job, they're good workers because they'll take the challenge set before them and tackle it.  If they whine, complain, and / or refuse to do the job, they are not hard workers.  They may not even have a work ethic, and they need to develope one."  So I was hired as a janitor.  Star (at the time) hired their own janitorial crew.  To put into perspective how much work this all is, here's our job duties: sweep all debris out of auditoriums (14, sizes vary, plus mop when needed), clean bathrooms, vacuum lobby (huge), vacuum hallways (long, x2).  We had to do all this, plus at 3 AM, I had to leave because I had my paper route in B'ville.  I didn't mind this at all, in fact I was pretty eager to do the job.  The thing that got in my way during my employment was that I had to drive back to B'ville to do a paper route in the morning and then drive back to Madison to go to MATC.  That's a lot to do in one night / morning.  I was a night owl then, still am today actually, so I didn't mind doing all that.  The manager of the theater was a trainee manager, Dickless, and he sucked at his job.  I heard people talk about him all the time, both janitor and customer service employees alike.  When he made bad decisions around the place, he always retreated behind his excuse 'Well, I'm still learning to be a manager, so this is a lesson for both of us.'  I knew a time when someone made a bad decision, they apologized for it and all was forgiven.  To give an example of why this guy sucked as a manager, I use this example.  One night it was just me and another employee doing all the cleaning.  The other workers had requested the night off in advance, and it just so happened that this night was just down to me and this other person.  After hustling all I could do by myself in the time I had, I set out to do the route and the schoolin'.  By the time the next night came along, I tanked out.  I called work and said I was too beat to come in.  I was pretty confident that everyone would be back for the night, so my absence wouldn't be the end of the world.  When I called up and told Dickless, this is what he said to me 'You know, if you don't come into work, you cause the work load to increase for the other workers.'  A very true statement, one I agree with entirely.  But let's really examine this.  Take this statement and again remember why I'm taking the night off.  Nuff said.  But, just like Goetz, there was a true drive of persistence.  His name was Joe, he was the janitorial supervisor.  And he the coolest work ethic on the planet.  Now before I go praising Joe like a demi-god, I have to confess one thing quick.  Joe was a big talker, and I never really realized it until I was done working for Star.  Sometimes I remember one of his stories and I have to really ask if they were the truth, or just a story he told to get people to follow him.  Drama over fact.  Joe was a hard worker, he never wanted to settle down.  He was close to 60, and he had a work drive like no one else.  He firmly believed in doing his fair share to get his fair share of pay.  He worked hard when at home, at work, and anywhere else.  He was also a patriot (don't see many of them these days).  He didn't work on 3 specific days a year: Memorial Day, Veteran's Day, and The 4th of July.   Side Note: I believe the 'two people' night fell on one of those days .  I was proud to work under Joe and Gerry.  They're of a few select people left in the world who take their job seriously and with pride.  No one really does that anymore.  We lost something along the way, and the few of us who still know the ideal find it hardly in practice.  I now bring you to the present.  I work at the movie theater and I have a lot of employees who just don't really give a shit that they even have a job.  They have this crazy ideal that the job owes them for giving up their time.  Something more then the paycheck, apparently.  None of them want to really put any effort into working, but sitting on their asses is high up on the list.  That and talking, either to each other or on cell phones.  That will change, though.  The blame can't go any further then myself.  I haven't been the most iron-fisted manager in the world.  I can't bare to sell that part of me that wants to be friends with the staff more then my need to be their boss.  It's not that big of a sacrifice, I don't know why I cling to it so dearly.  But once it's gone, I will be a better person.  I've worked hard to turn some things around already, just a little more effort and I'll be back on the right track.

      Today, my brother-in-law called me and informed me that I am going to get around $790 in Federal and $230 in State.  I'm pretty psyched.  Now I have to plan on what I'm doing with that money.  Invest, or spend?  Long term, or short term?  Only time will tell.

      Tonight's blog entry is just gonna be a few random things that come to mind.  Things I've said, things I've heard, all funny (at least to me).   Bumper Sticker:  Life is an experience to live, not a mystery to solve.   Me:  Hey Paul, let's go get some of that St. Louis weather.  Paul:  Hey, I have a friend who has a truck.  Me:  And I have a cooler!  Let's go!  "You wanna put your penis in her (nose / ear)."   In Russian accent  Your mother is a good woman.  Punching chest every time  Lord have mercy, lord have mercy, lord have mercy.   Tim:  Go home Chris.   (Everytime you end an otherwise boring story, tack on...)  AND THEN I STABBED MYSELF IN THE EYE!!  "You're my hero!"  "Drugs?"

      Today, I needed to run some errands.  Errands, that's such a weird word.  The dictionary defines errand as 'a short trip taken to do something.'  Anyway, I decided to wear my boots for the day.  Nothing like doing some running around in my most badass outfit that screams 'don't fuck with me'.  Now all I need to do is not look like a nerd in it.  I put in a blank tape in my Duel Deck and started to dub a copy of my 'Cracking Up' tape.  Danielle wanted to see an episode of it that had Zooey Deschanel guest star.  I just decided to make a copy of the whole tape for her.  Then I was off.   1st Stop: Post Office  - I went and delivered the video tapes I needed to send to a guy.  The lady who helped me needed a serious attitude adjustment.  It was like she woke up on the wrong side of the kitchen she belongs in.  She threw my tapes into a box and didn't pad it at all.  The tapes are gonna bounce around the box nicely.  Hope they don't fuckin' break.   2nd Stop: Monroe Street Shops  - I then went down Monroe Street where the Health Food Store was located.  I had to pick up a couple of cans of brewer's yeast for work.  Popcorn flavoring.  Then I ventured over to Capital City Comics.  I talked to the owner who I've always thought as being kinda... off?  He's one of those you think is geeky, but he's not geeky looking or really acting.  He has a level of antisocialism to think he's the superior and you the lesser.  I don't know, he does have a certain likability to him, but sometimes that line is obscured.  I haven't been keeping up on my collection of Futurama comics, so I needed to do some catching up.  I knew they were up to issue 17 and the last issue I had was..... 8.  Plus, I missed out on the Simpsons / Futurama crossover issues (2).  So I bought all of those for the hefty sum of $27 and some cents.  I then got engaged in a conversation with the owner about comic book movies.  We talked about Hellboy and Captain Sky.  I mentioned The Punisher and he said he hadn't even heard it was being made.  I'm thinking to myself that I knew about it all the way back to last summer.  Why hadn't this guy heard of it?  Then I left.   3rd Stop: Office Max  - Ahh, Office Max.  The obsessive complusive's home away from home.  I don't know about you, but I spring the biggest blackest boner when I am around office supplies.  Yeah, I said it, without any care that it may make me sound geekier then my previous mentioning of the comic book collecting.  But the real reason I was there was to buy some office supplies for the theater.  We haven't had any tape in the place for a couple of days, so it was getting pretty unsticky around there.  So I bought some rolls of tape.  Then I eyed some glue sticks and decided to purchase those too.  We don't use glue at the theater at all if ever, but there has been a time or two when someone asked if we had any and I always have to say 'no, we've never really needed it before.'  Now we do for when we do.  I then looked around the place for a while, trying to decide if we needed more of anything that I meant to remember but always forget about.  I saw some mini-legal notepads and I wanted them.  12 for under $5.  I then threw in two for the theater.  When I checked out, I told the guy that I needed to make two seperate purchases.  I think I confused him with my mad math skills.  In the end, I got what I wanted, but I probably pissed the guy off for being so difficult.  First, I get an already pissed off postal worker, then I piss off a happy go lucky Office Max employee.  Oh well.   4th Stop: My Apartment  - I decided to swing back to my apartment and pick up 1) Danielle's tape, and 2) my latest issue of Entertainment Weekly that showed the upcoming cast of the new Batman movie BATMAN BEGINS!  Me and Jon had the cast list already but didn't remember who most of the characters were.  So when the new issue came with detailed descriptions, I wanted to share.   5th Stop: Market Square Theater  - I dropped off everything, gave Danielle her tape, and lent Jon the magazine to read for the night.  Jon and I talked work for a few minutes, Danielle tasted the Brewer's Yeast and voiced that there was no taste difference.  I called Timmy and asked him if he wanted to go purchase the Tony Hawk Underground video game.  He said that sounded like a nifty idea.  I said my goodbyes and was gone.   6th Stop: My Apartment (Redux)  - I stopped home yet again to grab all my DVDs and GameCube games.  Might as well move some of my stuff since it's mostly official that I'm moving in.   7th Stop: The Apartment  - I arrived at The Apartment just as Paul was pretty much leaving.  Chris soon followed to go to a birthday party.  Timmy was playing Galaga on his PS2.  He was trying to top his high score.  Then he topped his high score for Pac Mania.  Then we took off.   8th Stop: Best Buy  - Upon arriving, Timmy got a phone call from Nate that we're to meet him at his apartment before going out and partying for St. Patrick's Day.  We walked in and looked for the game.  We couldn't find it at first, so we asked one of the employees to look and see if they had any still in stock.  I concidered buying a video switch bow thingie, but backed out deciding that it would be better if I just waited to buy the more expensive one that allows a lot more stuff to be hooked up through it.  They were out of THUG, so we decided to check someplace else.  We looked at the latest Zelda game, then exited the building.   9th Stop: Game Crazy  - Located inside the old 'Hollywood Video' rental store.  There were some really obnoxious kids playing some boxing video game.  Timmy and I looked for a cheap copy of THUG and then browsed some of the other games.  After turning up nothing, we headed back to The Apartment.   10th Stop: The Apartment  Part 2: The Brief Revisting   - We dropped off the game, Timmy changed, and we were off.   11th Stop: Nate's Apartment  - I didn't know that Nate (and co.) had such a cool apartment.  At least, I didn't know that it was any different from Tim's apartment since the basic design was pretty much the same for all the buildings in that area.  We waited for J.J.'s arrival before we could leave.  Nate was browsing the internet & Timmy was resting before his night of drunken stuporness.  Finally J.J. arrived and we all piled into Nate's car and took off.   12th Stop: State Street  - We parked in a parking ramp that was currently being patrolled by some parking police.  Nate put money in the meter to keep the rent-a-cop at bay.  Nate told me that for over a year he never put money in the meters and never got a ticket.  But lately he's had a streak of bad luck.  We walked up State Street and I seriously regretted the choice of wearing my boots.  They started to dig into my heels.  Nate met up with a bus load of his co-workers who were going to all these bars and getting free beer.  They were a beer distribution business, so that was okay.   13th Stop: City Bar  - Down a flight of stairs and through a door.  There we were, in a bar.  I grabbed an Onion on the way in for me to read.  Timmy bought me a soda to drink.  I sat at a table and read the paper.  Timmy got a call from Smoe who said he was coming to join us soon.  Nate pointed out a retro arcade game of Pac-Man / Galaga.  It was a 20th anniversary edition.  AND IT COST $1.00 TO PLAY!!  What the HELL!?  Smoe soon arrived, with beads on for extra lovin' that night.  We stayed around for a while then Smoe, Timmy and myself left to get some food.   14th Stop: Buffalo Wings  - We went in and ordered food.  We stood waiting for our orders to process, and for a place to sit to open up.  Me and Tim thought the guys with Qdoba should leave sinec they weren't even eating food from the place they were in.  But a guy and his girl soon up and left and we sat in their places.  I ordered a Bacon Chedder Burger and a soda.  Timmy & Smoe ordered a basket of 12 Buffalo Wings, some Chicken Strips, and Potato Wedges with cheese.  We then piged out while trying to guess the trivia answers on the TV screen.  We then left full and happy.   15th Stop: Wando's  - There we met old schoolmate Kip Jackson, Preston Bollerude, and Tim Ovaldol (Anyone wanna correct me on the spelling of their names?).  We stood around, looking.  I was enjoying the total boobage from the nearby chicks and Tim was 'enjoying' the smoke from the chick standing near us.  Smoe lent me his camera and I took a picture of this chick with major boobage (well, not really major, but the most majorist of all the girls in there).   16th Stop: McDonalds  - I helped Smoe drive to our next location, but he wanted to stop at McDonald's to grab a bite.  He bought me a Shamrock Shake, which I drank.  We discussed living arrangements present, future and distant future.   17th Stop: Old Chicago  - We arrived at the place, and pretty much left just as quickly.  Which was good for me, because I was drinking my Shamrock Shake in this place of business.  Felt awkward and fun.  Tim, Smoe and I left; but we had Smoe's truck which only had room for two, unless you counted the two tiny backseats.  Timmy immediately climbed into the back and layed down.  We then drove back to The Apartment. and took the last turn very sharply to see if Timmy would slid out.  He banged on the back window to express his appreciation (or lack of).   18th Stop: The Apartment  Part 3: THUG and Simpsons   - We played  T ony  H awk's  U nder G round.  Timmy and I were switching back and forth.  I kicked majorly, and I sucked sometimes.  Timmy went off to bed and Chris wanted to play my Simpsons Hit And Run game for Gamecube.  We played the entire first level, then Chris called it a night.  I called it a night  too and headed back to my apartment.  Thus concluded my day and night out.

      Me and Paul started Guy's Night early.  Me and Paul met up around 1:45 at The Apartment.  Me and Timmy played Wolfenstein for a while.  Paul and I then went to Aldi's and bought some groceries.  We returned and Paul suggested that we have a big feast tonight.  Timmy didn't seem too enthused.  I had a meeting with Jon today at 4, so me and Paul both headed to the theater.  I stopped at my bank to finally cash my check and then at a mailbox to mail the payments for some of my bills.  We arrived at the theater and waited for Jon.  He wasn't there and I got impatient waiting for him.  Me and Paul made a quick stop at Pegasus Games and bought some Magic Cards.  Then we back tracked to the theater and I did my little meeting thing.  Paul then wanted to go back to Pagasus Games and buy more cards.  We then went back to the apartment and played a few games of Magic.  The feast begins!  We grilled some burgers and Paul cooked some potatoes.  It wasn't a table full of food, but it was good.  Nate and J.J. stopped by.  Me and Smoe talked about my moving in and other various living arrangement decisions and stories.  We then played Magic until our hearts exploded.  Chris and Josh left at one point to get Taco Bell.  We played some more, and I think I lost.  I don't believe I won at all that night.  I should just spend a few weeks just watching people play, see how strategy plays out in these games.  I have a tendency to just want to build up an army, but never really use it.  The only time I really recall fighting big time is when no one else has any creatures and I have some sort of advantage.  But once I lose said advantage, I just focus on building my military.  The night eventually concluded and I watched a couple of battles of Battle Bots before I went home.  And, just to let all you avid readers know, I updated last week's Guy's Night, too.

      When people come up to me and say 'Happy Birthday Schober', I never really know how to respond to it.  I just say 'Thank you.'  I know it's a very nice and courteous thing to say to someone, so don't think I'm some unapprecitive bastard.  I think it's great, I guess.  It just kinda seems awkward and forced.  I kinda said this all yesterday.  But then there was today.  I spent the first half of the day pretty much just sleeping.  Then I went into work where I got a barrage of 'Happy Birthdays' from all my employees.  Then, later that night (around midnight), Deana (our projectionist) asked her husband to bring in a cake for me.  We ate a little of it while we waited for these two girls, who were still in the lobby waiting for their cab, to leave.  Then I had to drive back to B'ville to pick up my brother-in-law and bring him back to Madison so he can take his van back to B'ville.  Finally, the day ended with something I wasn't expecting.  I got home and checked my messages.  I had 4 messages and 1 saved message.  The saved one was from Whitney pretending to be Jenna Jameson wishing me a happy birthday.  The second one was from David, who is living in Arizona and remembered it was my birthday.  The third was Colin, who called from Germany to wish me a happy birthday.  I had talked to him at the theater earlier tonight, but the message was cool.  The fourth was Balch, who just wanted to wish me a happy birthday too.  I liked the phone messages thing.  It was kinda like voice birthday card.  It said what it wanted to say and summed up who it was from.  That made my day when I got home.  Listening to all those people, it was neato.  So for once, I have to say that this birthday year was pretty cool.

      I found out last night that the person I was interested in went out on a date with someone else.  Once again, that little interest I thought was there is gone.  I was really looking forward to just something being there, too.  Oh well, it's not like I'm not used to the way things are.  Today is my birthday, and I could care less.  Ever since I was in High School, I kinda always thought it would be cool to have people just forget it is my birthday.  I don't know why exactly, but when people remember I'm always irked.  That's all I really have today, so we'll end it here.

      I don't know how many of you remember my old post about the 'Special Girl' and 'Dream Girl', so I'll just reiterate the concepts.  A Special Girl is the girl that you could meet anywhere, at anytime, and has the possiblity of being someone in your life (if you take the first step).  A Dream girl is someone who you would like to have, but there's no possibility of ever getting with them because they're famous, a model, or so far out of your league it's never possible.  So here's my new concept: Current Interest.  It's someone who is like a Special Girl, but you have more of a chance with (all the patterns were there, and you feel a kinda connection).  Tonight, I met someone who I found very attractive.  I went to meet a friend and they were going to meet this person there at the same time.  I had met this person before, but I didn't really feel as much of a connection as I had last time, but I did have some feelings.  So when we met, I was surprised they remembered me from last time.    Am I being vague?  Good, because I know some people who read this and I'm not sure if I want to tell them who this person is... yet.  If nothing ever becomes of this, then it's for the better anyway.  So we're all sitting, talking.  I ordered some food because I was hungry.  (btw, my sister gave me $15 for allowing her and some of her friends come and watch the movie for free, with soda and popcorn too).  I thought all my feelings toward this person would be forced to just linger in my mind forever.  But as the night proceeded, I started to notice little things.  Behaviorisms, the small talk, stealing glmipses of me when they thought I wasn't looking.  It coulda just been me, but I'm pretty sure I was picking up on something.  But nothing proved more telling then the ride back.  They had left their vehicle back at the place we had originally met up at, so I drove them back.  We talked, and it was that kinda awkward talk.  You wanna say something, but you don't know what, so you say anything and sometimes regret saying that.  It was all very innocent.  Then we finally arrived, and it seemed like they were gonna beeline it out of my car.  But they stopped and said it would be great to see me again.  I agreed and they told me that our common friend had all their information and that they would stop into the theater and see a movie sometime.  I said that would be really cool and we said our goodbyes.  Man, they walked away from my car and for the first time in a long time, I just sat there thinking to myself 'god, they are so fuckin' hot.'  I was actually hoping that once we had left to go to their vehicle, we coulda stopped and made out for a while.  For a while, I actually thought we were gonna do just that with how they walked with me to my car.  Oh well.  There was a lot more that happened tonight, but it's 5 in the morning and I have to work all day tomorrow (noon to midnight).  So, I'm gonna call it a night now, and fall asleep thinking of this person and analyze if I missed any true opportunities I coulda acted on.  Aw, shit.  It was a pretty fuckin' sweet night anyhow.

      Magic, Aqua Teen Hunger Force, and gangin' up on Little Dude is just a sample of what happened this week on Guy's Night.  I brought over my Aqua Teen Hunger Force & Harvey Birdman Attorney at Law tapes.  We watched pretty much all episodes of HB, and then we watched about 3 hours of ATHF.  Maybe more, I don't know.  Wilson stopped over at one point.  When we played Magic, it was a 5 player free-for-all.  I believe in every game we played, everyone ganged up on Little Dude.  He never stood a chance.  And whoever dared to aid him, fell just as quick.  I'm surprised I don't remember as much from this night.  I think at one point we went to Woodman's to get soda and I bought some chips with $1.00 and some change that Chris gave me.  Then the guys picked up some job applications.  Sorry, anyone else remember what happened this week?

      I watched The Last Samurai on Thursday.  I'm posting this fact now because I didn't earlier.  You see?  I coulda lied and made some lame excuse, but I chose to tell the logical truth.  I liked the movie, with or without Tiny Tom.  I liked the story, I liked the scenery, I liked the dialogue.  It was like watching a poem.  Okay, that sounded kinda gay.  But I did like the movie.  I liked that little village most of the movie took place in.  If I had a choice, I would live in a little villa like that for the rest of my life.  Even if that means I have to leave all that I have right now.  I would even do that right now, but I would have to be dragged out of modern civilization.  But if there was some cataclismic apocolypse, I would be glad to give up my material possessions.  I would only like to live in a place that was as peaceful as their place (tribe?) was.  Plus, I would totally obey my leader, especially if it was Ken Watanabe.  He's gonna be in the new Batman movie.

      I spent $5.01 on Mac & Cheese from Noodles & Company.  I don't know how many of you are totally interested in my financial status, but I find my handling the situation facinating in such a nerdy sorta way.  If everything goes well, I might even post other things about the different situations I go through and the status of them, like eating a burrito and the subsequent bowel movements I experience.  Sound exciting?  I didn't think so!

      Well, I took the blog away, I give it back now.  But why the disappearance?  Several reasons come to mind, but which one is the real reason isn't even known to me.  It's complicated to explain, and I've only explained it to one or two people.  Anyway, I took the blog away because I wanted to write some long-ass entries that were gonna take a while.  Or, I took it away because some one was pissing me off and I wanted to get back at them and I did so by taking away the blog.  Or, I wanted to test my friendship boundries by taking away something people used to connect to me and wait to see if people wanted it back.  All of these passed through my manipulating mind, it even confused me.  We'll never really know.  So, here it is again, the same as it was before, just different in terms of what was last on here.

      Well, it was more like $32.71.  Thanks to my little ditch accident, I'm now more broke then I have ever been financially.  It's a scary concept and the only real way for me to not think about it is to keep myself busy and not in situations that tempt me to spent money.  I've never been without a safety net of cash, which is where the reserve fund would've come in handy.  So now, I sit here without much food in my home.  I have two cans of soda and a half a jug of OJ.  I also have a box of Mac & Cheese, a few packages of Easy Mac & Cheese, Campbell's Chicken Noodle Soup, and less then a dozen bags of Ramen Noodles (beef flavor).  Ah, Ramen Noodles, the poor man's food.  Mac & Chesse is the other poor man's diet, but I live in Wisconsin so it's more a second then a first.  Cheese is god.  Behold, the power of cheese.  Anyway, I am doing pretty good at keeping ahold of my $21 physical dollars, and $11.71 in my checking account (which pretty much is gonna go towards paying the minimum of my credit card bill.

      After work, I swung over to Bob's Trading Card shop.  It was more expensive then I remembered it being when I was last there.  I bought 3 booster packs of Magic cards (Nemesis, Onslaught, and Odyssey).  I stopped at the apartment to call Paul.  He declared that he needed to go to sleep at midnight, and no later.  I then asked Paul if I could do a batch of laundry at The Apartment.  I then grabbed a work shirt, pants, and a pair of socks.  I just needed to do enough to get me through tomorrow.  I was completely out of my black clothes.  He said that was fine.  When I arrived at The Apartment; Josh, Chris, and Paul were already there.  Paul had all his Magic cards in a box and was randomly going through the massive piles.  I later suggested to him that he invest in some rubber bands to wrap the cards into little, organized stacks.  Paul and Chris gave me some cards that I could use in my own deck.  I've been trying to assemble 2 different types of decks: Myr & Slivers.  I got 3 Myrs and a sliver.  These decks are gonna rule.  After a couple of games, Paul had to go fix a computer for a guy named Al, who was a friend of Turk's.  He left and was gone.  We took a break for a while.  I brought with me the first season of Six Feet Under on DVD.  Tim and Smoe had arrived back at The Apartment and Timmy wanted to watch it again.  We popped in the first disc and were well onto watching it.  Josh started off asking a question every 5 seconds.  I thought it was curious ambition at first, but the questions kept coming.  Soon I stopped answering them.  Then Tim started to answer them, then he stopped.  When Josh asked another 18 questions, I finally turned to him and said 'Why don't you just shut the fuck up and watch the fuckin' show and you'll find out the fuckin' answers'.  I don't get angry at people very often, but inpatient people annoy me.  We only watched the 1st episode together.  Then Timmy wanted to watch the 2nd episode while on his computer.  I told him to just take the DVD into his room as Chris and Josh didn't seem all into it.  Tim watched the next 7 episodes that night (or later).  At one point we ordered pizza from Pizza Hut.  I had my usual coupon 'Large 1 Topping Pizza for $6.99'.  I offered it to the group for the usin'.  Josh offered to pay for it.  Then we needed to talk over what we wanted on it.  Josh (originally) wanted pepperoni.  Chris said he wanted mushrooms.  I'm not too keen on the mushrooms alone.  I can stand them if they're mixed in with other toppings.  I suggested that we order the two larges, but on one we get 2 toppings half and half (green peppers and mushrooms).  Chris ordered it over the phone.  Now Chris, no offense dude, but I'll do the order next time.  I only say this because I do all the ordering for people at the theater.  I just know the sequence people want to hear the information in.  Yeah, I'm a nerd and a loser for knowing that, but I'm good at it.  Chris started to play Wolfenstein 3D, the classic game.  This prompted Tim to play the game, which he had on his computer, too.  I was watching Tim when Chris came running into the room saying I needed to see something on TV.  I came into the living room and saw Josh watching some home movies show that started out pretty funny.  Something about Snowmobiles attacking and machines going crazy.  The highlight, in my opinion, was this sheep that got stuck on a cliff.  Rescuers were coming to save it when it freaked and fell down this steep incline, rolled a little, then bounced off the ground and landed on it's feet and trotted away.  A SHEEP FUCKIN' BOUNCED!!  That's so COOL!!  Paul called and said that he was about to return.  Chris, Josh, & I decided to play one quick game before he got back.  Only the game we played lasted a really long time, long past Paul's return.  Paul was bored watching us play a game where we didn't do much of anything.  We just kept playing cards and not attacking each other.  It just kept getting built up and built up.  Finally, someone ended it.  I didn't win.  Then finally Paul got in the game and we played against everyone.  I think we did teams, but regardless of whose team I was on, it was always the team that got it's ass kicked.  To the best of my recollection, I never won a game that night.  I got a kick out of the fact that at one point, both Paul & Chris had their laptops (or whatever the correct term is for them these days) on the table and were browsing the internet while we were playing a game.  Paul sat on my left and Chris on my right.  I was almost like I was a spectator watching two guys play a game of battleship.  It finally dawned on me that I still hadn't done my laundry.  I threw my batch of clothes into the washer.  Around midnight, Paul announced that the midnight deadline has been pushed back to 1AM.  Around 1AM he announced again it had been pushed back to whenever he felt like going to bed.  I brought up the topic of moving.  This seems to be the topic I can't get anyone to really give me a straight forward answer to.  The only person who actually gets me the answers I ask for is Paul.  Paul wrote Syse a letter to see if he had any plans on moving.  Paul and I were talking about me being the editor for TV Tome and how I just got the Maniac Mansion page.  I described the original game to him and he said it reminded him of the Kings Quest games.  I told him that I had the complete series of Kings Quest, Quest for Glory, & Space Quest.  Chris and Josh were watching TV when the TV shut off.  Chris told Josh to turn it back on.  A few minutes later, the TV turned off again.  Chris yelled at Josh again, so he turned the TV back on and set the remote down to not accidently hit any buttons again.  Then the TV went off, and the lights behind me went off.  Josh proclaimed his innocence and pointed out the fact that the remote was right in front of him on the coffee table.  Paul then told Chris to quickly open Tim's door.  Chris hopped up and opened the door.  Tim was laying down, but the fusebox was wide open.  He had been flicking the switch that killed the TV's power and he even hit the light's switch.  Well, that was the night in a nutshell.  There may have been more, but that's all I can recall as the highlights.

      Yeah, you're all probably wondering it, so I went ahead and wrote it.  I've been in the complete transition of moving.  I've been making my grand move to The Apartment.  My accomplishments: Assembled my desk, put stuff on my desk, hooked up my almighty powerful entertainment corner-center thingie, got my own phone line (cell phones can wait, especially since the cellphone reception is shitty during certain times of day).  Maybe more things have been accomplished, but I don't remember them at this moment.  The other place is getting more and more empty, which is cool.  Everytime I take something out fo it, it's like I'm saying a figurative FUCK YOU to Gregg Shimanski of Gregg Shimanski Realty.  More or less, they suck.  It's too warm there anyway, BECAUSE IT'S HELL!!

      Tonight was a typical night of business at the Market Square Theater.  That is, until the last show for the day got out.  What followed both freaked me out as well as insulted me.  When the last two shows let out, it was pouring rain.  Michelle, Deana, Heather & I were all waiting for the last of the customers to file out.  But no one really wanted to go outside because it was raining.  And everyone knows the harmful effect that water has on people and their souls.  It's the devil's work, you know.  There were those brave souls that ran out to their car through our side exits.  But then there came this one customer.  He came up to the box office where we all were seated.  His daughter was perched on his shoulders.  He then started to insist that he go out the front door.  Deana denied him passage, as was store policy (because the front doors don't self lock, which deny potential criminals immediate access into the theater).  The man insisted that he had to exit through the front doors as his car was 'right there'.  He was again denied.  Then, in a fit of what I can only describe as total selfishness and insanity, he lept over the velvet rope that are for physically barring people from going out the front doors (still, I might add, with his daughter on his shoulders).  Deana yelled after him that the front doors don't self-lock.  He turned and yelled back that she can 'just lock them behind him, then'.  What follows also mortified me.  After unlocking the door, he literally bolted across the parking lot.  Again, I remind you that his daughter was on his shoulders when he did so.  And for his car being 'right there', 'right there' apparently meant clear across the parking lot.  At this point I got up and locked the doors behind him, because they need to stay locked for the night.  Now, I would just like to take a minute from this story to say something.  Some people might be reading this right now and think that we're being too strict with enforcing this rule / policy.  Well, we pretty much have to.  There have been a few theaters in our chain that have been robbed and unkind things happen to the managers closing.  There has been many reminders to follow the 'After Hour' procedures to prevent these things.  And when they aren't followed, they're usually followed by terminations of the managers on duty.  So you bet your sweet ass that I will follow the policy so I can keep my job.  So, this guy is now out of the theater and, in theory, out of our lives.  Suddenly the fucker comes flying across the parking lot in reverse.  He then spins around and stops along the curb.  He then jumped out and ran up to the doors and started rattling them.  We just stared at him because we didn't know what he wanted.  He seemed deranged and crazy and overall unstable.  So he's standing out there in the rain, which apparently doesn't seem to bother him now then when it did when he first needed to go outside.  He started yelling things through the door.  We guessed what he was saying was something to the effect of 'can I talk to the manager on duty'.  Finally, I opened up the interior doors and asked him 'What?'  He just stood there staring at me, so I asked again 'what?'  Again he just stared, so I asked him one last time 'what?'  Nothing, so I walked away.  Then he started yelling through the doors again.  We called MPI at this point.  Asked them to come and get rid of this guy.  The guy stood outside the door for sometime, then retreated back to his car.  Then he spun around the parking lot so that his headlights shone in through the front doors.  Then he started to drive around to random spots all about the parking lot and parking for a few minutes.  We found out later on that what he was doing was getting licence plate numbers from all the cars.  Finally MPI showed up and it looked like our guy had vanished.  But then he came roaring around the corner and I quickly jumped back onto the curb for safety.  MPI talked to the guy and then he went home.  MPI came in and talked to me next, which I pretty much told the whole story.  Seems our side of the story (the truthful side) had more details in it then the other guy's story had.  Figures.   Jon's Take On The Whole Event:  What did he think?  That he was made out of sugar and he might melt?  HE WASN'T THAT SWEET!!  Well said, Jon.

      I came so close to not writing a new post, but then I decided to put something on here that might clear up a few things.  I know I bitch, whine, cry and pretty much overall make a big deal out of it.  But the one thing I never really have done is explain it.  It is her, her is she, she is Sarah.  To begin at the start (which I'm told is always the best place to start stories), I never really noticed Sarah, until one day she kinda stuck out to me.  Art Class, around the 5th day of it.  This was around the same time that Colin and I started to become the good friends we are now.  I just remember looking over at Sarah more then I normally did to any girl.  She just stuck out more to me.  A quick side note: Around this same time I was coming off a bad relationship (which, to date, was the last relationship I was ever in).  Combine that with the last two before it made for one messed up Schober.  So I didn't really do much about Sarah.  Over time, I would talk to her little by little.  Never more then a few minutes.  The only thing that jumps to memory now (and as corny as it may sound) was when I was walking down the hall and she was walking the other way and I said 'Speaking of beautiful, it's Sarah.'  She thanked me for the compliment, but I can't ever recall if she took it as sincerity or weirdness.  I asked around and found out that she liked angels.  So I went and bought her a music box statue of an angel and gave it to her for her birthday.  She loved the gifts.  But two days later she gave it back to me.  I was bitter and I was going to move on.  But this would be the first time in a series of times which I could not stay away from Sarah.  Over the course of the Summer, I tried to get to know her.  I was around her and her friends.  Her crowd was different from the crowd I was used to.  But I did get used to it, even though I never really agreed with it.  But over time, I felt being pushed further and further to the side.  Finally, I wanted to be rid of her once and for all.  I decided that it wasn't for the best to cling to this relationship.  It didn't seem normal or natural.  So I severed all ties and pretty much left her behind.  Two and a half years would pass.  For the last six of it I would come to realize the mistake I had made.  If anything, Sarah was a girl who would listen and well as the girl I would listen to.  I threw it away.  It was gone, and there was probably no chance of ever getting her back.  Then fate dealt me one more 'get out of your Private Hell' card.  I was reaquianted with her during her sister's graduation ceremony.  I found out she was living in Madison, just like me.  I found out she was working in Madison, just like me.  And I found out she was working just down the street from me.  For the next few 5 months would be the most challenging months I ever experienced with a girl.  Unfortunately, I didn't do any of the right things.  I didn't say the right things.  I didn't take the nerve or the energy to do any of the things I should've done.  When I found out she was moving, I made the same mistake I made before.  Because I didn't learn from the first, so I was doomed to repeat it.  I cut my losses and severed all ties with her again.  But near the end, I snapped out of it.  I tried in vain to recapture that which I was on the verge of losing again.  I tried to get something that wouldn't allow me to lose her once and for all yet again.  And I failed at even doing that.  Wanna know something?  After writing all this and really looking back at everything I've done with her, after re-examining the story and going over some of the details, after reliving the few good moments along with the overwhelming bad ones; after all that, I have to say that maybe this relationship isn't meant to be.  I never get the backbone to do anything, I always end up losing her, and to be totally honest, I don't think she really wants anything to do with me.  Maybe, in my mind, I just wanted her to be something that she can't or couldn't really be.  Maybe I should just give up and let go of the idea of ever forming a relationship with her.  But there's no way I'm making that fuckin' mistake for a third time.

      Ah, yes.  Once again I see the pattern between me and money.  Once it's in my possession, it's just a matter of time before it's out of it again.  What with my Federal Tax Return arriving and my depositing it in the bank, there was no stopping me.  Well, actually there was a stopping me, but there was no one around to do it.  First, I picked up the check and digital cable box I bought on eBay.  Then I cashed the check at my bank followed by the purchasing of subs at Cousins.  Then I drove for a while, thinking how I needed OJ.  Then I thought about going to look at some Nintendo games at Game Stop.  So I went to GameStop and they, get this, don't sell Nintendo Games anymore!  They're solely the newer game counsoles (X-Box, Gamecube, Playstaion 2).  I looked and saw they had 'used' X-Boxes for $120, and they had the game 'The Suffering' which I have been looking forward to playing.  So I bought the system and the game... and a memory card... and a membership to GameStop so in the future I'll get 10% off all used items in the future and a free subscription to Game Informer.  I then drove over to Aldi's and quickly ran in and bought some OJ.  I wanted something to drink over the course of the day.  Then I drove to The Apartment and cleaned up the living room a little before setting anything new up.  Took out the garbage, too.  Then I finally ate my sub and drank some OJ.  I tried out my Digital Cable Box with disappointing results.  Finally I started to play with the X-Box.  It was cool.  I played for a while, then Paul and Chris came home.  They watched me play for a while, then I handed the game off to Chris.  Paul and I then went to play Magic and Chris wanted to get in on that.  After getting my ass kicked, I went back to play my game again.  Then we took a break and went to run some errands with Paul.  He stopped at his bank to cash a check and then we went to Target.  Paul had to talk to someone there, I went and checked out the movies & games.  OPaul and Chris caught up to me later and they were debating who should buy the Kill Bill Vol. 1 DVD.  Chris ended up doing so.  We went back to The Apartment and watched the movie.  It was okay.  I liked the directing and the story, but I was disillusioned by the scenes where blood sprayed out all over the place.  Sure, violence and blood spatter are cool things, but when blood sprays out like a hose with a hole in it, then the movie magic feels cheaped.  Otherwise it would've been a really kick ass movie.  If it was just people getting slaughtered with the normal amount of blood spurting out of them, the movie would've really rocked.  (And yes, I do know that it was done this way intentionally as a homage to old martial arts / kung fu movies, but I still didn't personally like it)  After the movie, I went back to play the game.  Then my mind started to work the self examination process.  This is how the routine goes: What happiness have I derived from purchasing this?  Was it worth it?  Then, when I realize it wasn't, I start to really break it down.  Playing video games makes you stupid, playing video games makes you fat, playing video games doesn't score you chicks.  Then I started to get depressed.  So I called it a day and left for the night.

      Here I sit, before another work day.  But this is not just another work day.  Today is the weekly double shift work day.  Since the company cut hours during the week, and I'm a salaried employee who needs to work a certain number of hours each week, both me and Jon have to do these double shifts each week.  Tuesday ones are easier, because Wednesday ones start off with having to put the stock order away.  So hurray for Tuesdays (or should I say 'huzzah'?).  My alarm clock is set to remind me every 10 minutes that it's soon time to prepare for the new work day.  Curse you clock and your purpose in life.  I should stop over at Pegasus and buy some Magic Cards to tide me over for the day.  My mom called me early this morning to tell me that my Federal Tax Return came in the mail yesterday.  YES!  She's going to drop it off at my apartment tomorrow, so I have that to look forward to.

      I was in the grocery store the other day and they had a sale on cereal: 4 for $8.  The options were Cheerios and kix, but the Cheerios had like 4 different kinds.  First, there was the Original Cheerios I grew up with and, until now, pretty much the only one I knew of.  Then they had Frosted Cheerios, Mutli-Grain Cheerios, and Apple Cinnamon Cheerios.  WHAT THE FUCK JUST HAPPENED?!  Okay, let's put aside if the new choices things are good for you or not.  Here's my beef: Why?  Why did General Mills, the same people who brought us these beloved cereals: The celebrity of the week Wheaties & the G-Rated Undead Trio Count Chocula, Franken Berry, and Boo Berry.  And such lovable characters / concepts as Betty Crocker, Pillsbury Doghboy, The Green Giant, & The Hamburger Helper  I grew up with these names, I know these names.  Why do I know these names?  Because they were installed in my head when I was a kid.  Am I pissed off because of this?  No, it has now transfered from brainwashing to just plain nostalga.  So why am I so bothered now?  Because these old concepts have been bastardized and ruined.  Cheerios used to be this thing I hated, because I had to add sugar to them in order to get a boost of energy I needed to not only get through the day, but to make it hard for my parents to get through the day with me.  But as time went on, I began to like Cheerios more and more.  Cheerios became an icon of maturity, that in order for me to grow up, I have to enjoy eating them and find that healthy foods also make for good eating.  I'm going to pick on the Frosted Cheerios first.  Okay, they're frosted.  Just like Frosted Flakes.  Oh, wait a minute, that's a Kellog's product!  Let me get my index card quick and see what General Mills has that's frosted.... Sorry, couldn't find anything right away.  Unless you count non-marshmellows in Lucky Charms cereal.  I know I didn't.  The #1 thing I fear is the children.  WHO WILL THINK OF THE CHILDREN!?  When I grew up, I knew all the cereals and the different choices.  Each brand had it's own triumph in a particular field.  Now, it's all criss cross.  When a child grows up, will they even care?  It's all about corporate apathy.  And there you have it.  I said the dreaded 'C' word that pops up in rants and now I have to stop.  Because all crazy ranting people go off the deep end once corporations are blamed and challenged.  And I'm not crazy, not tonight at least.  So I end this posting with this:  I bought a box of Apple Cinnamon Cheerios, Multi-Grain Cheerios, and (classic) Cheerios.  FUCK FROSTED!!

      Not entirely true.  Timmy has cable, but not digital cable.  But, I have to be at their place to watch it, and right now I'm sitting here in my apartment with nothing but this computer for entertainment.  And if this leaves?  Well, I have Timmy's PS1 with the little screen and Final Fantasy Tactics.  It's okay, but it's no Sopranos.  Actaully, these past few days have been somewhat cool.  I haven't watched much TV.  I don't feel controlled by the boob tube any more.  But I've hardly put a dent in the addiction I created.  I can just get away with it right now, but I do need to get things in gear with getting the Digital Cable hooked up.  The reason I put it off is because I want Timmy to help and he's trying to pawn the whole job onto me.  I'll trap him yet.  But for now, I sit here and write these words for you, the reader.  And for Paul who says I hardly write in this thing anymore and when I do it's mildly refreshing.  Actually, he's never said that last part, but I think he'll find it amusing to read it along with all the other things I'll try to write in the future.

      Today I helped my mother move things, both around her house and her new house.  Never in my life have I been in so much pain.  No, not from all the physical labor, but from watching my mother work too.  She's been getting worse with each passing day.  I don't want her to have to walk around more then she has to.  She's so stubborn and gun-ho.  She complains about how hard it is to even stand in one place, but she won't sit down unless she has to.  When she asks me to do a job, if I don't do it fast enough, she starts doing it herself.  Grr, she makes me angry.  I hate it when she constantly complains about how much it hurts to do things but then goes and does things that she knows I'll do for her.  She never had the patience for me, I'm too slow for her liking.  I'm methodical, I have a process on doing things.  She wants it done when she wants it done.  All day I watched her move around, supporting herself with a cane in one hand and a crutch in the other.  She commented on how using both may be a bit of an overkill, but she finds using them both takes some pressure off.  At one point, she asked me to move things from a closet on one side of the house to the basement (located through the bedroom, down a hall, around 2 corners, down a flight of stairs [watch your head] and setting things on a table).  She said she wanted to take a break quick before she was going to help me.  I said to her to just sit and I'll do everything.  She then suggested that she'll just move things from the closet to the top of the steps.  I went into the closet to get the first load.  The closet was practically stuffed.  I grabbed a box or two and made my first haul.  While passing, my mother asked 'how much is there?'  Surprised she didn't already know, I just said 'a couple trips'.  I then moved 3 more hauls when she asked again 'almost done?'  I said, 'yep, just 2 more loads.'  I then moved 4 more hauls, she asked again 'Is that it?'.  I said 'yeah, just 3 more boxes.'  She then started to get wise to what I was doing and said 'You said a couple more 8 trips ago.'  I laughed and said I was serious this time.  I moved more stuff, I was almost done.  On my second to last trip I moved one more box to the basement, she asked if that was it.  I said 'yep, that's all.'  But on my return upstairs I said 'last one after this last trip.'  So I helped, as I always do.  This new house will be better for my mother because everything she needs to use at home will be located on a single floor.  The basement will be my home away from home when I need it.  And if my mom needs my help on one of my return visits, I'll be able to move stuff around for her again...  ... if she can stand the short wait.

      Where ever we go, who ever you are, what ever may be; there will always come the time we face the worst point of our lives.  A time when the good times end and the worst part begins.  It's frequent in our lives, but when the occurance becomes overwhelming, we feel the sting ever more.  I speak of course of loss.  It's the time when the cable is disconnected, the time when our phones become disconnected (because we didn't pay the last bill in full or on time), the time when we're $1 short at the checkout line and you soon realize you're not going home with everything you planned on buying.  These, of course, are the examples I refer to when loss is the least harmful.  But then there are times we cannot see through.  The times when everything in your life seems to stop and you're convinced that life is worth stopping as well.  The time when you found out the one you loved is leaving you for someone better, the time you lose a paternal member of the family, the time the dreadful realization that a girl you really cared about slipped through your fingers because you had no backbone when opportunity was not only knocking on your door, but kicking it in, stealing your TV, and leaving a note with all his information on it; and yet you still did nothing.  Loss is something we blind ourselves with.  We focus on what was lost and thereby lose sight of what could've been gained.  Another tragic loss in itself.  It envelopes us, it consumes us, it sufficates our will to live.  And if it's not overcome, we soon no longer see the good things in life.  Instead we just focus in on the bad.  Yet again, a loss.  This loss digs a hole in our determination, and soon it becomes so deep, so wide, so endless that it becomes a void in who we are.  The abyss calls to us, wanting us to call it Home in it's hollow existence.  Where the pain is more soothing because we have lost touch with that which once gave us comfort.  We then focus in on ourselves because we have abandoned the external solutions.  Another loss.  Many problems soon follow: The selfishness, the social isolation, the lack of humanity and compassion.  We no longer see how we can help others, we look at how we can survive mentally, physically, & spiritually.  And as all things easy to come by go, we soon find no comfort in this sad state of mind and being.  We soon pain for the days when we felt one with everything.  Back to what we refer to as 'better times.'  We then turn our gaze up to the sky and see that or new Home is nothing more then a pit you've trapped yourself in.  It's then when we want to get out of the eternal hole of self damnation  But the bridges have been burned, the eggs were counted before they were hatched; and though we have warmed up our shoulders to others, the cold one we have given them has left it's mark.  Soon, we realize that it's either determination or desperation that will be our key to setting us free.  For the determined, they will go strongly forth, taking on the challenges that they come upon with a will so powerful (no matter how tough the challenge) and shall prevail with their new life.  But the determined rarely have come to this Home already, so this rarely is the final outcome.  This leaves us with the desperate, who find the way out the hardest... if ever.  We seek out friendly faces where ever we can get them.  We become social whores, pawning our friendship to who ever takes an interest in us.  Some may be kind and caring, but others find us amusing and a means to exploit.  We no longer feel alive, for our spirit and will has faded.  That which was the fire in our life has flickered and died.  And that is truely the worst loss of them all.  It's time to realize that external loss is a thing of life.  We have to take the good with the bad.  If you like feeling so good during the good times, then you have to feel bad during the worst.  It's the yin and yang of life.  So keep your head high towards the sky looking towards tomorrow.  Because if you don't, the next time you do look up, you'll find you've just become another victim to fall into the eternal abyss that you've come to call Home.

      Yesterday, my brother-in-law helped me move some things.  I originally planned to move everything out of my apartment, but then I backed out of that idea.  I wanna arrange and reorganized some of the smaller items in my apartment first.  Luckily, he brought a small truck, not the huge truck I was expecting.  We just threw my chair, loveseat, and an end-table into the truck, all of it was going to B'ville anyway.  We then swung over to Wal-Mart (sorry Paul), where I looked over some shelves.  I decided on one and bought two of them (About $62.00).      New Year's Resolution Breach    My Brother-in-law and my niece ate at McDonalds.  After I was done looking over the shelves I came and waited with them.  My niece got full fast and didn't finish her food.  My brother-in-law then offered me her food.  I only took 3 fries, and politely refused the rest.   3 Fries   We then went to The Apartment and dropped off the shelves.  Russ looked over the place, and was protective of his daughter and what she saw in this place of sin.  It's a bachlor pad, after all.  We then dropped off Tim's key with Tim at the theater.  Then drove back to B'ville and unloaded the stuff.  Then we drove back to Madison.  Later that night, I wanted to assembled the shelves, so I went back to The Apartment and started to put one together.  I had to stop, though.  Chris had come home and I didn't think it appropriate to be working on the shelf when he was going to try and sleep.  So I left and called it a night.

      Penn & Teller's Bullshit is back on TV for it's second season, so believe you me that I'm pretty much gonna be writing a blog entry about each new episode.  Am I a bandwagon jumper?  I have to admit, yes I am.  When Dennis Miller was on the air, I used to wrap my opinions around every word he said.  He's off the air now, and Penn & Teller have pretty much taken his place.  These shows pretty much mold my opinions of everything.  Why?  Because they sound so true.  Dennis Miller was always expressing an opinion every week in a comical and humorous way.  How can I not listen?  The thing with Dennis Miller was that he was always using analogies.  Comparing one thing to another.  Penn & Teller take is one step further.  The aim of the show is to ask the questions that no one bothers to ask.  It's goal is to take the wind out of alarmists, fanatics, and (ironically) bandwagon jumpers.  They go about doing that by taking facts, scientific studies, legal paperwork, public record, and the law and applying it to some bullshit concepts.  They tackled some interesting subjects already: Enviromental Hysteria, Alien Abductions, Second Hand Smoking, Near Death Experiences, Ouiji Boards, End of the World Hysteria, and much more.  This week, they tackled P.E.T.A.,  P eople for the  E thical  T reatment of  A nimals.  Interesting things were said, and once again my view is changed.  The thing is (as always), I now know why I'm against it, but when the time comes to defend my stance, will I be able to recall anything I've learned?  Probably not.  But I do know now that I'm not going to support P.E.T.A. if I'm ever asked to.

      Today, I woke up and ran some errands.  First, I went to the bank and cashed my State Tax return.  From that, I withheld $48 for spending cash.  The rest went into the bank.  I then went to Bob's Trading Card Shop.  I wanted to buy some Mirrodin Magic cards, but they were out.  So I just bought 5 pages of card holders (don't know the proper term).  I'm going to use them for my Mirrodin foils.  I then drove over to Pegasus Games and bought 2 Mirrodin packs (+150 cards) there.  I should've asked about the additional 5 card containers I'm supposed to be getting from there.  Maybe tomorrow.  I had to wait until Paul and Chris got back, so I hung around the theater until about 2:30.  While there I looked over my new cards.  Then I back tracked to my apartment and found that Chris and Paul were going to be taking longer on re-arrival.  So I waited at my apartment, cleaning and organizing.  Finally I headed over to The Apartment and Chris and Paul were just arriving.  We hauled up Chris's TV and I hooked it up to the system.  The thing that sucked is that Chris's TV has mono sound, so until we get a stereo system hooked up, the sound is a little whack.  Paul and Chris then set out to do what they've planned to do for almost a week now: buid a setup for statium seating.  They aquired some cinder blocks and 2x4s a few nights ago and were going to elevate a love set behind another love seat.  The end product was a marvel, and we loved it.  Paul then took off for karate and Tim came home.  We played Tony Hawk Underground for a while.  Eventually at some point in the night we conquered the game.  We ordered some pizza and got some pepsi.  I also came into possession of index cards.  Sweet.   Quote(s) of the Night  1) Nice legs.  When do they open? 2) Yeah, it may be just a needle, but it moves like a sewing machine.  Played a bunch of Magic.  I kicked and I got kicked.  It was awesome.  I need to buy some shelves.  Then I can move some tapes over now and that's going to be a process.

      Holding her in your arms.  She finds comfort being so close to you.  Gently caressing her cheek, gazing deeply into her eyes.  And for a moment, maybe longer, you concider stealing a kiss.  Tilting your head slightly and pressing yours to her anticipating lips.  Connection.  Something I believe most people take for granted.  The ability to truely enjoy such a personal bond of not only the physical, but emotional and spiritual.  A kiss, an embrace, a hug, or holding hands.  Yes, something as old fashioned as holding hands.  Just breakdown what it's like to hold hands.  Feeling someone's warmth, the gentle caressing made by the slightest of finger movements.  It's like your very being wants to explore another soul.  The ordinary hand is such a complex (and ingenious) design.  And to communicate such desires, affections, and feelings with them is beautiful.

         Lion King!    urlLink   What Movie Do You Belong In? (many different outcomes!)     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla     Taking quizzes are fun.  Not so much to see how I score / rate on the quiz, but more because I'm asked questions that no one really asks me any other time.  Like somehow I'm mattering because someone wants to know about me.  To bad it's just a tiny survay that no one knows what I type.  So much to me, so much unknown.  But who am I to complain, I don't like it when people know too much about me.  Too much information about someone in anyone else's hands is dangerous, you're exposed.  So I sit here content with being mysterious Schober.  The guy everyone knows but knows very little about.

      I just want to lie in the grass and watch the sun glide across the sky.  I want to bathe in the purest of waters and soak in it's essence.  I want to fall down a bottomless abyss with no worries to disturb my thoughts.  I want to be smothered in a room full of the most fluffiest pillows.  Stress, the #1 thing that tests our strongest of strengths.  It makes us panic, it makes us worry, it makes us breakdown in fits of dread.  It's being in charge but having no control.  It's having your dreams ripped out from under you.  It's feeling angry but nothing to be angry at.  Overall, you just shouldn't let it get to you.  It consumes the work-a-holic, it destroys the weak, and it tests us everyday.  When you see it coming a mile away, you can you prepare for it.  When it happens suddenly, you have to be on your feet.  But it's certain that once it passes, how it was handled defines how you will handle it the next time.  Such is the feeling today.  It seems where ever I have been, there's a challenge waiting for me there.  The only place I have been today is Walgreens where I actually had a nice girl (the cashier) strike up a conversation with me.  Sweet and kind, it felt like something I haven't felt all day.  That feeling: Relaxation.  Being at ease, content.  I now hold onto that moment as I write this, as it was really a great way to escape this otherwise stressful day.  Stress never really bothered me before.  I guess I just shrugged it off in the past.  But not really acknowleging it doesn't make it go away.  Maybe today I'm just seeing it for the first time.  What lies ahead of me for the next few hours that remain in the day will define how stressful it really was.  I have overcome worst and survived.  One thing is for certain: I'm not going to let it get to me.

      Tonight at the theater the power went out.  10:15 PM, ZAP!  At first it came back on, then it went out again and stayed out.  The following was a bunch of work.  But I'm not gonna tell that story.  Not tonight anyway.  I'm just glad to be home.  I sat around The Apartment all day and did pretty much nothing.  Not productive in the least.  Not entirely relaxing either, because about 2 hours before work I was tired again.  I was gonna take a nap, but I didn't.  So then the power outage thing happened.  There was so many times that I wanted to just pawn the responcibilies off onto someone else.  But then I just sucked it up and said 'just do it'.  Telling all the customers the problem, calling Jon, calling MG&E, instructing people, paperwork, the counts, accuracy, money, etc.  But I'm glad I did it all.  Tomorrow I won't have to do it.  Just a little, but not all of it.  I did a lot of it today, which will soon be yesterday.  And the greatest thing about yesterdays is that you're no longer living them, you're no longer awaiting them, you can just sit back and forget or admire them.  Tonight I will forget about it, tomorrow I will admire it.  Maybe in a week I'll laugh about it.  But I can sleep tonight knowing I was at my best.  Half awake, even...

      I know I'll probably go to Hell for saying this, but I just find it totally hilarious.  There's a backstory to this, but I just want to clearify that for safety reasons I'm going to rename the person the story involves 'Vanessa', because I don't really care for that name (sorry to all the Vanessa's of the world).  Anyway, Vanessa is a friend of mine who has had a dream or two about being fucked by the devil.  And having a real good time I might add.  She's also found every picture of Jesus totally sexy and hot.  So right there she's infatuated by both sides.  Today, I was joking with her about these old memories (This was brought up when a Jehovah's Witness stopped by to drop off some literature at our place).  Then the thought crossed my mind of her fucking both of them at the same time.  After laughing at the idea to myself, I shared it with her and she got a kick out of it too.  Then I started to kinda break it down.  What if Jesus is this real romantic who likes to wine and dine a girl (turning water to wine makes the job a whole lot easier, too).  He enjoys strolls along the beach, cuddling, and giving backrubs.  The Devil, however, is a real stud.  He likes to get with all the ladies.  He's into all the crazy shit (like whips, chains, cuffs).  He likes to ride a girl like his badass motorbike.  And he's tough.  Together, they're the ultimate fucking-duo.  One that not only fulfills a girl's (or in some cases, a guy's) every lustful need, but also one that tends to her emotional and tender side.  The sex would blow you mind away like a shot of pure adrenaline mixed with speed.  Man that's a rush, and one Hell (or Heaven) of a climax!!  Now I'd like to take the time to apologize to every bible thumper and sincerely request that you don't mow me down and / or kill my local abortion climic doctor.  Let's all grow up, okay?

      I ended up buying a Playstation 2 Hard Drive with Final Fantasy XI.  I like the game, but it takes so long to do things.  If I had a whole week off to myself I would dedicate the whole gaming experience.  However I am working pretty much every morning, I have roommates and I feel it's rude sometimes, and I feel like I should be doing something else.  Once again the sadist in me emerges.  I now am going to torchur myself with trying to get Sarah to (at least) go out with me.  It's a sad state of being, but I seem to like it.  I kick myself for the failures and I never enjoy the success.  And what little success there is.  Now some people would look at me and say I could do better.  I look at me and say I can't.  I have to chase a dream that I can never capture.  I have to because I feel I can never settle for 'anything less'.  To do so is like giving up.  Then again, someone settling for me is like giving up.  It's a catch-22 that I'm stuck in.  Analyzing everything is kinda deep.  I pick things apart until there's nothing to really to live through life experiences.  I rarely take chances anymore and I never give myself any credit.  Mostly because I think I've burned all the credit I've ever had in life.

      These past few weeks I really turned things around.  I reclaimed some confidence I long since thought I lost.  I interacted with more complete strangers more then I have ever done in years (e.g. greeting them, light conversation, giving them a helping hand).  I looked at things in a more positive light and I didn't let a lot of things that aren't meant to even bother me bug me.  So now I present the story that I lived through this morning.  It's a story I write now so to remind me of sadder times to make me feel better in the future.      Then I Woke Up This Morning.   I was in my usual pleasent mood.  I woke up around 8 in the morning, way to early.  Today is the day I've been looking forward to.  Today is the day I'm getting together with Sarah.  I'm weary to use the word 'date', because there's so much misconception that comes with it.  I said I would call her around noon, so I had 4 hours to burn.  Paul had Bunny over the night before and Chris had Michelle over as well.  I listened to the two talk to their others.  The old me would be really bothered by this, but it doesn't bother me anymore.  I then showered and overall readied myself for today.  I then waited patiently for noon to arrive.  But in the final hour, the old self took over.  My mind went numb and I couldn't stop it.   She's not going to be there.  She forgot about you.  She double booked buddy, and guess what?  You're hardly priority.  You don't even rate.  You're that guy you see that wants the unattainable and can't face reality.  She won't settle for anything more then friends, and friends in her book are people unlike you.  And another thing...   I tuned it out.  I didn't want to believe that anymore.  I'm a nice guy and nice guys matter too.  She'll see past the exterior and see me.  The part of me I never really show anyone because...   It's weak.  You're weak.  There's nothing to you.  Everyone only wants the style over your substance.  Too bad your style is a temporary thing.  You make people laugh?  You don't make me laugh.  Except for the fact you're a joke.  Remind me again why you believe she even wants to be alone with you?  Because you think it will bring her closer?  Because you think she'll see something in you?  Because you believe you can offer her something that no other guy has been able to offer her yet?   I once again became two people:  The Pessimist  and  His Slave .  The Pessimist is my mind, it's in control.  It tells me things that try to pursuade me to lock everything up inside, to not externalize.  He hides my confidence and and erradicates all hope.  He doesn't believe in happy endings because he's a realist.  He desires failure because it makes him more right and more powerful.  He feeds off negative energy and lives to bring people down.  Even those around me.  The Slave is my body, it wants to be free.  Except, he has no control.  He's desperate, he's clingy, he's obnoxiously annoying.  He has no social skills & he has no power.  The Pessimist has taken everything away from him and he's suffering from the lack of tools.  But he tries, he tries to the very end.  Only to end up back where he started: The Slave.  It was noon.  Actually a few minutes before.  Fear in my heart.  I called Sarah's to see if we're still on.  I got the machine.   I told ya, she forgot about you.  She probably knew it was you and didn't answer.   No, it's too early.  She's sleeping in.  I'll call her again.  Maybe the ringing the first time woke her up and she'll answer this time.  One more call.   You're so pathetic.  Look at you, you're desperate.  In less time then it takes to nuke something in the microwave you're calling her again.  You're clinging to someone who probably doesn't like to be clung to.  Who wants a desperate man when they could have some cock of the walk that at least looks good.   Again the machine.  It did seem like a little too much to be calling her again and again.  Maybe watching TV will take my mind off it.  Nothing really on, but I can fake interest for a while.  5 minutes, they went by fast.  I'll call her again.   Dear god, look at you!  This is so sad.  Now it's a thing of not wanting her to answer.  If she does the first thing she's going to ask is 'why are you calling me over and over again.  What are you, some kinda freak?'  Then she'll hang up on you and you'll have to go hang yourself.  Nothing worth living for when you can't have the #1 girl in your life.   This is non-sense.  Leave a message.  One with your phone number.  I don't remember the number, I never have to call myself.  You wrote it down, it's in your backpack.  Call again and leave a message.   We have a record.  4 phone calls in under 20 minutes.  That's the most you've done in years.  Hardly a record to your old accomplishments.  Didn't one night you call someone every 5 minutes for 3 hours?  Is your life really that empty?  Is it really that hard to come up with something better to do in your spare time.  Well, I guess you have to call them over and over again, because no one (and I mean absolutely no one) would ever return a call from you.   Okay message left.  Time to kill.  30 minutes, I call.  Another 30, I call.  Another 30, I call.  Why won't she answer?   Time to face facts, you're out of your league.  Time to settle for less, nothing good will ever come to you.  You don't deserve happiness, you're shitty at spreading it yourself.  People like you are good for only two things: work force and being dead.  So either be a dedicated employee or six feet under.   I just got done making my last phone call for the day.  A guy answered, I think it was Sarah's brother.  He said she wasn't home, so now I don't feel like anything.  The Pessimist in me is right.  I made today out to be something more then it could ever be.  Something impossible and something unattainable.  I once again relied on someone else, or something external to achieve my goal: That today I could be happy.

      Today, I did a lot of stuff today, so I'm just gonna condence it.  I am sore and tired.  I moved a lot of things from my mother's place to my mother's new place.  I called Sarah and asked her if she wanted to get together and do something on Wednesday.  She accepted.  I did a load of laundry and came back to Madison.  I moved some things from my old apartment to The Apartment.  I arranged some things then went back to my old apartment to clean up (they're showing my apartment tomorrow).  Moved more things from there to The Apartment.  Went grocery shopping and did another load of laundry.  Played Starcraft, too.  That's all for now, more details about the Sarah thing later.

      What can I say about the infamous, multi-million, mini-mongul twins that someone else hasn't already thought, said, or fantisized about already.  And in a few short weeks, they'll be of age and on every Dirty Old Man's mind.  These two girls caught our attention starring in the single role as Michelle Elizabeth Tanner in  Full House .  They then made many children's videos, sing-a-longs, and CDs.  In their mid-teens they once again wanted to rekindle the sitcom life with 1998's  Two of a Kind , 2001's  So Little Time , and  Mary-Kate and Ashley in Action!  (voice only, also 2001).  None of those lasted more then 1 season.  So why do I bother acting like I know the complete Olsen Twin history?  Because today I went to see  New York Minute .  Now when I first heard about the movie, I was like 'eh'.  Then I realized that in a few weeks, the twins will be of age.  18 baby!  And I think more people are excited about the passage into adulthood then the twins themselves.  So then I decided to accept the Dirty Old Man within and get excited to go see the movie.  I hyped myself up and kept thinking about all the other dirty guys who were gonna be flocking to the theater just like me.  But after taking my seat, I realized the truth.  The theater was being filled up with little kids of various ages, mostly pre-teen.  Something that I think Tim would be having a hay-day by being involved in.  But for me it was now accepting the kid in me.  Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen probably hold a nice embrace around the kids of America.  They're sweet and funny.  They're beautiful and charming.  They're strong and charismatic.  They're the Olsen Twins, and they enjoy being them.  All dirty talking aside, they really are something.  So to them, I humbly accept them as the cutsie power figures that they are.  They worked their way to be everything they wanted to be to get to where they are.  And they deserve a lot of respect for getting there.  Plus, they're pretty fuckin' hot too.  EIGHTEEN, BABY!  JUST AROUND THE CORNER!!

      Well, it's taken me over 6 months to muster up the courage (not counting the time in Feburary, Valentine's Day to be exact, when I wanted to wish her personally a Happy Valentine's Day), but I finally called Sarah's parents to see if I could get her number from them.  After 3 failed times where all I got was the machine, I finally got through.  Sarah's mom answered and I asked the million dollar question.  Now here's the kicker: I didn't expect the 10 million dollar prize.  Turns out Sarah just moved back in with the rents just yesterday!  I was so elated and beside myself.  Sarah's mom asked if I wanted to leave my number for Sarah to call.  I was frantic because I don't know my new number since I've moved.  Instead, I offered to leave my work number since I was gonna be at work all day tomorrow.  Here's to hoping for a call back.  Anyway, I just got done doing all this not more then 10 minutes ago.  It was so cool (if only to me) that I had to post it.

      Girls.  Girls, girls, girls.  Where to start?  Who doesn't like the girls?  Men, lesbians, doctors.  We're all a curious breed.  I chased after Sarah, then right after I lost the steam for chasing her any further, she told me to back off (refer to previous posting).  But such is the case with me.  I don't even know how to go about getting a girl.  Why must I be so awkward?  I'm an old school romantic.  I just want to hold a girl in my arms and enjoy her company.  I like to listen to girls talk.  I like to just have someone to embrace in my arms.  It gives me confidence, it makes me feel important.  No sex, nothing immediate.  Just someone to cuddle up next to.  Someone to share a common bond with.  A guy told me last night that the way to get girls is to treat them like shit.  That chivalry is dead and that there's no room for romantics anymore.  I never wanted to believe that.  We had the movie Kate & Leopold (starring Meg Ryan and Van Helsing himself, Hugh Jackman) and girls were constantly coming out of that movie in tears and saying 'why can't men be more like that?'  So I start wondering, 'what the fuck?  I've always been like that and women don't care.'  What they really want is the prince charming looks to go with the personality.  That's where I'm out.  I'm not a good looking person.  Sometimes I just wanna go somewhere and die.  Just dig a hole and have someone bury me alive.  That's how frustrated I am.  It's like I don't really matter.  I feel like I'm in some sort of competition that I'm not only losing at, but I'm so far behind that there's no way I can catch up.  It's like I'm just here for everyone's amusement.  No one even makes me feel good about myself.  I'm riddiculed & I'm constantly being left out of things.  How can I be motivated to really make something of myself when all I have is negative vibes hitting me all the time.  Throw in the constant feeling of inferiority I feel all the time.  It's like I exist when it's necessary.  However, when I'm not important enough, I'm pushed off to the side.  It's like this constant contest that gets tiring to play.  I just want a constant in my life that I can feel comfortable with.  But it's not happening.  Everything's changing and even though change is good, some of the things that don't are comforting.  Girls just end up going to the good looking ones who already know they're good looking.  They just treat the girls like a little prize they play with until they're bored.  It's so sad and frightening.  What happened to people's self-respect, their pride, their sense of self-importance?  Shouldn't someone want more?  Desire more?  Why can't anyone demand more and not give up for something less?  Take the chances, make people work for something you want to work for.  That's the true race, not one where you start off running and give up after 100 yards.  Go all the way before you go all the way.  But who am I kidding.  I say all this and I can't even do it myself.  Maybe someone will hear me and see I'm trying to spark something.  Oh, and if you're wondering about the guy who told me chivalry is dead?  Up until he left, he had this girl on him he met at the party.  Kinda depressing, and even though I wanna congradulate him on his success, I can't help but feel I give something up by doing that.

      Today was an nightmare.  Just a lot of history and previously bad experiences cultivating to a climax.  A mental breakdown along with some psychosomatic reactions.  What was the original cause of all this?  Sarah.  I woke up this morning saying I'll try to talk to Sarah.  Main reason of motivation?  To invite her to Paul's going away party.  So I woke up and called Denny's.  She was busy, which I pretty much figured she be.  She'd always been busy when I called her there and she's there.  The guy told me to call back later.  I had to work today, so I decided to just stop by Denny's and get some breakfest for work.  A long time since I've gotten breakfest during breakfest time.  So I went in and ordered my food.  I sat down and started reading a book on Bonsai gardening.  I heard Sarah somewhere in the place, but it looked busy so I just kept to myself.  My food came up and I left.  I arrived at the theater and Jon was there.  We were assessing the place, especially after the tornado scare we had last night.  Going over various things and joking around.  So far, an anjoyable day.  I figured business might have died down and she might be free.  They told me she was on her break and they couldn't find her.  No biggie, try again in like 20 minutes.  Twenty minutes later, I called and finally got ahold of her.  I asked her when she was getting down with work.  She wanted to know why, and she asked in such a way as if to say 'what business is it of yours?'  I then said she should swing over here when she's done.  Here referring to the theater.  She said that was a bad idea.  I inquired why and she said...  "I'm not comfortable anymore."  I was kinda stunned.  It was like that dream I had, but more realistic and impersonal.  I just said 'okay' and hung up.  I kinda wandered around for a while, stunned.  Thoughts just started to flood in.  Emotions and all my previous failed relationships just started to re-emerge.  Even though Sarah and I were not a relationship, just a friendship (at least, that's how I moved on with it), it still conjured up how some of them ended too.  The first time a girlfriend called me 'a nightmare'.  Three relationships where she left me for another guy.  How there are people I know who can get a girl at the drop of a hat, numerous and plenty.  Failure, failure, failure.  I'm such a loser I can't even get a girl to think of me as a friend.  And if she thinks it's more, then what the fuck?  Do all women view me as some sorta fat sexual preditor?  A guy who's so lonely he'd trick you into copulation?  When the Hell did everything get so much more complicated?  I know this kinda thing isn't easy, it's hard work.  But everything I do doesn't work.  At all.  Ever.  Then the physical conditions started in.  Through out the day I had:   1) Loss of breath.   I couldn't breath sometimes.  I got light headed.  I felt like I was gonna pass out.  It came and went frequently, so it never escalated out of control.   2) Shakes.   I kept shaking.  My hands couldn't keep still sometimes.  My legs felt like rubber.  I wanted to fall down and/or collapse.  And finally, the most scariest of them all which seriously freaked me out:   3) Nose bleed.   I was doing the paperwork, after mulling over this whole thing for 4 hours, my nose just started to randomly start bleeding.  And it wouldn't stop.  I just kept coming and coming.  It was at that time I had to let it all go.  I just took a deep breath and started to look toward tomorrow.  So where does this land us?  It takes us to the place where good things happen.  After all that, a day that was a living nightmare, there's peace.  And that's really the end of a chapter of my life I'm now glad I'm able to close.  For all those of you who said 'move on' & 'you're so much better then her' I succomb to your advice.  If you scan back at some of the old postings, there was one thing I definately wanted to know.  Did I ever have a chance with Sarah?  Would I have to live my life living in the 'what coulda been'?  No, simply put.  I did something, I acted on my feelings.  I got hurt, and I take the bad with the good.  I now know the answer and, even though I have to live with this disappointment, I don't have to live with the feeling of a loss.  And believe me, no loss there.  Bitch.

      Today, I did absolutely nothing.  Except survive.  A tornado touched down in Madison today.  It killed a million people and a car dealership.  You decided which is the lesser tragedy.  Me and Timmy watched the clouds, and we watched the spot that would eventually turn into the tornado that touched down.  It started right outside The Apartment.  It was crazy.  Ever have that feeling that everyone hates you?  I'm the only person here in The Apartment that has a PC and not a Mac.  A land line and not a cellphone.  An uncomfortable bed and not a comfortable one.  A crappy TV with all the settings messed up.  And almost every other day I have everyone telling me 'Schober, you should invest in getting the better of your current possession.'  Well, fuck you!  I'm sorry, but not all of us has money bursting out of our pockets.  Not every one of us can go to someone and ask for money.  Not all of us work jobs we do little or nothing at and get paid more then we honestly earned.  My family never gave hand outs.  We learned early on you sink or you swim.  You fend for yourself.  And when you lend or borrow money, you make damn sure you get it back.  Money is an issue with me.  I never have enough, but whoever does?  I live life at it's simplest right now.  I work a job I enjoy doing for a decent amount of money.  Some may say it's hardly enough to live on, but I say it'd be a perfect amount to live on if there wasn't so many frivolous things I'm tempted to blow it on (i.e. video games, cable, snacks).  I heard the word 'commitment' today.  Made me think about a lot of things.  I always said I'm a man who prides himself as a person able to commit to someone.  Basing this entirely on the idea that I'd commit more to someone then anyone else I've ever met.  But I have to say I was iffy.  There's more to the situation, none I'm willing to go into here.  I still hate people.  Everything, I just hate them.  But now I'm just venting.

      Nope, it's not a TenThirteen Production.  Instead, it's me coming up with the most cleaverest line of the week:  'Awkward silence, acknowledgement of silence, a nod towards the acknowledgement, and finally returning to the conversation as we had left it, but one sentence later.'  Add it to any conversation to get a reaction.  It's like a craft project for online people, just cut and paste.  It's that simple!  Move over macaroni mosaic.

      I've been away for a while, wasn't connected to the internet for a while.  Then when I reconnected I wasn't motivated enough to post anything.  It's too warm in the loft.  Add the fact that the bed I sleep on is too hard.  The mattress is so thin I can feel the metal underneath.  No matter what angle I lay on it, I always wake up stiff and sore.  I've been losing sleep and I feel groggy all the time.  The next purchase is gonna be a mattress, next to the work shirts of course.  I had a weird dream last night.  I saw Sarah driving down the road in a car with a friend (maybe her sister).  I followed them, because I really wanted to talk to her.  I caught up to them eventually, because for some odd reason Sarah had gotten out of her car to get something.  I approched her, and she started to freak out.  She told me to get away from her.  I asked her why and she just got more defensive.  I asked her if she was afraid of me or something and she said 'yes, you're a freak'.  I then spent a few minutes trying to convince her that I was a normal guy and I deserve a chance.  After a while, she broke down and decided to give me another try (which is a joke in and of itself because she never gave me a try in the first place).  I then asked her for her number so I could call her since the only contact numbers I have for her is Dennys and her home phone number.  Both of which I can never get a hold of her at.  She got out a piece of paper and wrote a number down.  She handed it to me and I asked her what a good time to call would be.  She told me and walked back over to the car.  I then looked down at the sheet of paper and saw she had not written a phone number, but just some word.  I don't remember the word, maybe Freak or some other word with the same meaning.  I looked up to say something, but they peeled away.  Funny how dreams work.  They're messages we're supressing in our subconscious.  People are always telling me that I'm too good for Sarah, that I should forget her and move on.  But move onto what people?  Girls don't flock to me, girls don't even care about me.  How can I move on from something that (maybe I do admit) could never happen to nothing?  Some people have better luck with women then I do.  And it's usually those people that really don't give a shit about the women in the first place.  They're luckier then me and they definately take it for granted.  Old school romantics like me don't have a place in this world.

      Here I sit, right before work.  I sit here and want to write one entry for the books.  One entry that allows me to say I have posted once before a week after the last posting.  So I present that posting to you now, and you may read it.  We just found out a couple days ago that there's future plans to tear down the Market Square Theater and replace it with condos.  Our lease is up in Dec. 2005, so there's no immediate worries.  But there's no way to see how this is gonna effect the business on a whole.  We've hit a stride in business, the best consistance we've ever done since I've been there.  We've hit high points followed by a drop off.  Anyway, I'm particularly angry about this situation.  And a tad bit scared.  The theater has always been 'my job' and one that I could always rely on.  If this whole thing goes through, I'm out of a job.  I could probably go work at another theater (I've already worked at 3), but I'm not throwing in the towel now.  I like MST, and I'll be damned if I lose it now.  That's another thing, what I've been getting angry at is when I talk to any employees about this, they immdiately start telling their plans about moving on from there.  There's no will to survive, no perserverence.  It's just throwing up your arms and saying 'oh well'.  Goddammit, NO ONE CARES ABOUT THE PRODUCT OR THE SERVICE!!  Then again, I should talk.  There's a few employees that I want to leave, so maybe this will scare them off faster.  No one cares, except (at least it seems like) just me.  And I care because I think that theater is good for the public.  I think it's a good idea, it's a good escape, it's a good alternative.  I think we should fight for it and I've been told it can be fought!  It's not a losing battle, it's a battle that has a chance at succeeding.  Right now I'm preparing for tomorrow.  We have to be prepared, that's for sure.

      I really wanted to post something right now, but everytime I started to write something I didn't like it and I deleted it.  So in it's place I leave this pathetic posting.  I would post more, but my roommate is always naked with his girlfriend in a bed I can always see out of the corner of my eye.  That, and they have sex a lot.  And since my computer is in our room, I never get a chance to go near it.  And when I do it's only for a few seconds.  On top of it all, now that I have pretty much all the time I could ask for posting a blog entry, I draw a blank.  There have been several times in the last few days that I had a really good idea, but once again the lack of accessability postponed the thought until it was gone and forgotten.  This was all I had.  I'll figure out an entry in a few hours, when this room is once again occupied and emitting sounds that put Cinemax to shame.

       He wandered down the road, aimlessly.  His thoughts disoriented.  One foot sluggishly forced it's way in front of the other foot.  His arms hung loosely on either side of him.  His gaze was fixed straight ahead.  Everything felt heavy and it seemed like an effort to just move forward.  But move forward he did.   I need to write more.  I haven't posted a blog entry for like over a week.  I've been writing this story for a while, so I decided to mix it in with a blog entry.  So if the entry isn't interesting enough, at least the story could provide a sense of entertainment.   "What time is it?" He thought to himself.  He guessed it was late due to the lack of sunlight.  Darkness sneaked all around him.  He felt it was trying to trick him, trip him, fuck him up good.  A lightpost was in view.  He trudged forward.  His hands reached up to grasp the cool metal.  For the first time, he felt the pain.  It shot up his arms and shocked his senses.  He leaned into the post, embracing the cold.  Then he noticed how there was blood stained on his fingers.   Whenever I write a story, I usually like to keep a sense of mystery to it.  I never go into complete detail and even might end it abruptly.   He stared at his crimson red fingers.  They told a story that even he didn't know.  Or wanna know.  Or did he want to know?  Why doesn't he know already?  The street was dark all around him.  No details could be made out, just himself under the lamppost.  He looked down at his suit, in a state of disarray.  Half tucked, half untucked.  A few buttons were undone.  The blood only seemed to be on his hands, and nowhere else.   I always liked writing stories where someone has absolutely no control over his current situation.  It's like a powerless trip.  Trying to regain that which was lost, but having no means to do just that.  It's easy to write those stories because you can relate to the character easier since both of you don't know what' going on, unless you already have a story in mind.   He slumped down at the base of the lit pole.  This is when the pain in his stiff legs shot into him.  Everything hurt.  His arms, legs, and his mind; which was a blur.  And nothing bubbled to the surface.  It just swirled in the abyss of his head.  For a while, he couldn't even recall who he was.  And even when he did, it disappeared just as quickly.   Well, that's my story, I'll just let this write itself out now.  Hoped you enjoyed it.   As he sat there in the illuminated corner of the dark surroundings, everything seemed to feel comforting.  The whole world was so distant.  The silence that occupied his mind made everything more relaxing.  The pain in his legs and arms didn't linger if he just sat still.  He rolled his eyes to find something, but what he never knew.    "I'll just close my eyes for a few minutes.  It'll just take a moment to make the pain go away.  I'll figure things out when I'm more coherent.  But right now, I'm just gonna close my eyes."    He sat there, is silence.  He almost could make out the sound of someone calling his name.  Or was it his name?  He didn't care, it just felt so good to sit there.  Everything melted away from him.  The burden of his body seemed to fall behind him.  His mind just echoed his last thoughts...    "I'm just gonna close my eyes... gonna close my eyes... my eyes..."

      Various papers, piles of books, strands of wires.  Jar of change, bottle of aspirin, stacks of magazines.  Box of assorted items, packages of light bulbs, writing utensils.  Sand is over-rated, it's just tiny rocks.  Comfy couch, warm blankets, soft pillows.  TV sets, random images, video games.  Fresh air, outdoor activities, walks along the street.  People need to smile more, so much negativity.  Holding hands, casual laughes, relaxation in someone's arms.  Beating hearts, sweaty palms, smelling her intoxicating perfume.  Shared connection, strong bond, eternal love.  No one ever says 'You're welcome' anymore.  I even find it hard to say these days.  The simple taste of chocolate, fizziness of soda, frozen treats.  Dinner served to you in a restaurant, preparing food on your own, mom cooking when you're home.  Bread, meat, a simple sandwich.  Misery loves company and we sure like to share it with those who already feel good about themselves.  Getting letters in the mail, reading a good book, gazing at the stars.  Drinking with friends, sitting in front of a fireplace, smoking a cigarette.  Having exact change at a toll booth, paying the final payment off of a loan, finding a penny.  Everyone is beautiful, the imperfections make us who we are.  A hug, a kiss, intimacy.  A child, their mother, father.  A man, a woman, their relationship.  Just taking a moment in the day to think of some of the things in life we take for granted makes the day more managable.  Remembering these things seems like a sort of nostalgia.  But why are we so unfamiliar with these things?  Are we just that ungrateful?  During the bad times, it's helpful to remember the good.  On a smaller scale, the good things are so many in number.  A handful of them can balance the equation.  The bigger problems can be erradicated by most of them to.  If life is really just that bad, why can't we see the smaller things?  Do we just want to be miserable?  I complain, I bitch, and I am one of the most annoying whiners.  But it's remembering these good times that bring me back to a better state of being.  I hope this helps you to.

      I went to The Inferno Saturday night.  Michelle has been trying to get me to go for almost 2 years.  It's not that I didn't want to go, I just wanted to go with someone else who I could be more down to Earth with.  This is Michelle's scene, so I'd be out of the loop.  It'd be nice to go with someone who was just as out of place as I would.  So until that day came, I passed the opportunities.  But Saturday was the day.  I met David at the theater, Heather was just getting off of work.  We all drove to Heather's in our cars.  At Heather's, I left my car and got in with her.  David and us then drove to Michelle's.  There we all loaded into David's car.  And we were off.  Once there, I found myself in Heaven, or at least a darker section of how I envision it.  Lot's of women with hardly anything on.  Black, everywhere.  Body Harnesses and skin.  Ooooooh, the skin.  Here's my ideal social scene: Sitting down, talking, getting to know someone.  Sharing, laughing, flirting with the person you're with.  Stealin' a glance, caressin' a hand, maybe even a kiss.  But this place goes against all that.  It was intense.  Women dancing, men walking right up and groping them.  Random make-out sessions.  Some people were even on leashes.  The whole thing was one major turn on.  But I was way too shy and timid to get involved.  On top of that, I don't dance.  I did when I was in high school, but even then it was just as a joke.  I locked my eyes on this one girl dancing.  She wore this very slinky outfit that covered her front, but teased from behind.  I would look up a picture of it to show on here, but I have no internet right now to search with.  I stared at her for sometime, then some guy in a body harness started getting with her and I pretty much lost her for the night.  There was this huge guy walking around the place.  He was a tank, he reminded me of Ethan Suplee from The Butterfly Effect, only creepier.  He was all over the place, and trying to get with many women.  Heather said to me that she got the eye from him at one point and she looked away.  I had the honor (you decide if I'm being sarcastic) of watching him seduce this one girl.  He was holding her, then kissing her.  He then started to feel her up.  She was totally craving his hands on her body.  I was like, 'Damn, if this guy has a chance with women, I might have one as well.'  Too bad I'm not good at acting on impulse.  Plus, he had the look going for him.  I was a tad bit dressed out of the loop.  Soon after, Heather pointed this one girl out to me.  I had seen her before, her outfit stood out in the whole place.  But when she described her to me, I saw her in a new light.  It's so dark in this place it's hard to make out some details.  How I missed this one is a mystery to even me.  She wore a fluffy red hat, for starters.  On her legs, knee-high white boots.  Wrapped around her, a white vinyl coat-tail jacket.  So you can imagine why she stood out so well already.  Here's the topper, a string bikini.  She was pratica-fuckin'-ly nude.  And men would come up and just start feeling her all over and she just let them.  I felt hungry.  Heather texted message Paul about this woman.  Paul immediately called her and asked where she was.  She filled him in on all the details, he cried because it was +21.  After she told this to me, I knew that I had a destiny for the night.  I found a barstool to sit on and sit on it I did.  I just took in all the women.  I usually don't stare at people, but it seemed to be totally accepted here.  So everytime a very sexy lady walked past me, I followed her with my eyes.  Not many noticed, or cared, or were interested.  But I still let them know that I was into them.  I kinda wanted some random girl to just come over and talk to me.  It never happened.  I did however, come close to one chick.  She hosts this website, the name eludes me now, but it's a sub / dom website.  Me and Michelle did some research on this website, for Michelle's curiosity.  Anyway, this girl was walking around handing out her business cards.  She walked over to me and held it up to me.  Curious, I went to take it, but she pulled it back and walked away.  This confused me, as it did David.  When I found out later from Michelle that she was the girl from the website, it made sense.  She held it up to my mouth, and that's what I was supposed to take it with.  When I went to reach for it, I wasn't doing what she wanted me to do and punished me by denying me the pleasure of her business.  Sneaky sneaky.  We concluded the night and started out of the place.  I saw the White Coat Tail Girl and had to fulfill my purpose.  I walked up to her and in my first impulse of the night, said 'Can I ask you a favor?'  She looked at me curiously and I continued.  'I told a friend of mine about your outfit, and he's jealous of only me getting a chance to see it.  But it'd really make my day if I can brag that I got to get a little physical with her.'  She laughed and asked 'Oh yeah?  What'd you have in mind?'  I said, stepping even closer to her, 'Something like a nice backrub.'  And with that, I reached around her body and started to caress her back.  She was a little sweaty from her activities from the night, which kinda surprised me since she's hardly wearing anything that is containing any heat.  I was so close that I could kiss her, but I wasn't that daring.  I then gave her a half-hug and said 'thanks'.  She gave me a little kiss on the cheek and I rejoined the others as we walked back to the car.  Okay, that whole last paragraph wasn't true, but I know Paul reads this and I wanted to rub it in his face for a minute.  I know some other people who read this too who'll get a kick out of it.  But that is my story of my first night at The Inferno.  It was fun, but I felt out of place.  I wanted everyone there, but I don't think anyone there would want me.  It's just like looking at pictures, there for the pleasure of seeing, but not for enjoying it's company.  Like I said, I like more one on one interaction.  And this place had very little of that.
