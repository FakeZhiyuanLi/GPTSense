      This really pisses me off!  I fork out $180 for my pool membership, look forward to spending Memorial Day lazing in the sun with a good book, and lo and behold, it's pouring with rain!  I guess it's still better than being at work...  Last night we saw a god awful movie called  Raising Helen  - with Kate Hudson. As charming as she is, she could not redeem this boring, soppy, stupid movie. Americans really don't have a clue how to make a good movie...occasionally there is some fluke and they bring out one good one, but movies should be left to the Europeans!  My weekend definitely was not the same without The Sopranos! HBO decided against screening the season finale on Memorial Weekend, so we have to wait until next week to see what happens!  I am positively plutzing to find out what transpires - it's undoubtedly the best show on TV!  The Mouse Spouse thought he had to work today (he is an engineer for CN8 cable TV station) but he called earlier to say he had been incorrect, and CN8 was not doing live shows. Yippee so we get to spend the day together!  He is due to arrive soon bearing tasty treats from Giovannis - triple deck sandwhiches, cheese hoagies and other delights. Weather is so shitty I guess we'll just chill, play our newest Play Station Hockey NHL pro game (I beat him yesterday!) and relax.  Tomorrow it's back to work, urgh!

      It's almost 1am but I'm not sleepy, so I thought I'd pen a few words before I push off to sleep.  I just returned from "the mouse spouse" (my boyfriend) after a fun evening of playing hockey on playstation and watching the movie  21 Grams . I didn't know what the fuck was going on for the first half hour - I hate movies that go back and forward in time so you are left confused and irritated. There were interesting moments, especially enjoyed seeing Sean Penn's ass - he's a great actor. Loved him in  Mystic River  too.  Today was the unveiling of the new WW2 Memorial on the Mall in DC. I find it a bit odd that it took sixty years to pay tribute to the men and women who fought in the war, but nevertheless, I guess better late than never. It was moving to see all the old toppies in their medals and regalia, and trying to imagine the horrors they had been through so long ago. I know this is going to sound trite, but war is so fucking stupid! All the death and injury and misery it causes, why don't people learn from history and stop trying to constantly destroy one another. Doesn't every human being at the end of the day really want the same thing? To have people/family to love, to eat, to work and to get on with their lives in peace?   But every once in a while, far to often, some prick somewhere (apologies to bona fide pricks - I don't mean to cast dispersion on penis's everywhere) arises which stupid fucking ideas on world domination or destruction, masses get sucked in by this asshole's promises or grand aspirations, and BOOM, innocent young men and women go marching off to war and either return in body bags or return emotionally scared for life or (and this never ceases to amaze me) return spewing the glory of war - proud to have fought for land and country.

      I am full of wonder at the amazing life of the little cicada. Here in DC, particularly where I am, in an Arlington suburb, there are zillions of cicadas buzzing around. I didn't know anything about the amazing lifecycle of the cicada until coming here. Apparently every 17 years, the creatures emerge from the earth, fly up to the trees, mate (male dies immediately - typical! no hugging or holding post sex) and then the female lays hundreds of eggs in the tree and then she too dies. When the eggs hatch, the little larvae go back underground and stay there for another SEVENTEEN years! What is so enchanting about these bugs is the incredible noise they make. When you go outside here or drive in wooded areas, you hear this deafening buzz!  I have grown to really like it, it's somehow soothing.  Washington is saturated in cicadas, you are constantly stepping on little corpses...there were even some in the Holocaust Museum yesterday! Symbolic? (By the way, if one should fly into you - they are blind - while rather unpleasant, they don't sting or bite.) Here is a picture of one:   .   I'm off now to Union Station to return to Philly and my sick, much beloved boyfriend who has had some horrible virus for a week.  SM

      I've been visiting a friend here in DC the last few days, my first time here. Interesting city, but I chose a crazy time to visit - it's memorial day weekend and there are thousands of veterans and others in town to unveil the new WW2 memorial that was 16 years in the making - never mind that the war ended half a century ago!  Washington is really full of memorials honoring poor men and women who went off to horrid wars for god knows what reason or purpose, and never came back alive. The Vietnam Memorial was very moving, that black granite, full of names of young men and women who lost their lives, and for what? I also visited the Lincoln memorial. Can't say I knew much about Abe, I'm horribly ignorant of American history, so the museum adjacent to the monument educated me and I learnt to appreciate old Abe and his sentiments against slaverly etc which seemed way ahead of his time.   Today I spent 5 hours at the HOlocaust Museum - very powerful and draining. My head is full of horrific images, brutality and suffering that I will never ever understand or fully fathom. I found the exhibition a lot more powerful than Yad VAshem in Jerusalem, somehow the museum here seemed more holistic, comprehensive and had a greater impact on me. I could have spent a few days there, there was much I still would have wanted to see, movies to watch etc....  What was most moving for me were the images of the shtetl in Poland - a tower of photos of lovely people enjoying their lives in Pre-War East Europe, a shtetl that was reduced to ZERO after the war. I kept looking for faces of my own family who were murdered in the forests of Riga - only my grandfather left Riga for South Africa in the early 30's - the rest of his family - his parents, 7 siblings, their spouses and children (my grandpa was the youngest) were all slaughtered by Latvians - only my uncle/cousin Julius survived after years in the camps. He passed away last year, I never did learn of his war story, how he survived etc... I wonder whether he saved his memoirs on tape, I would very much like to hear it.   Anyway, I'm totally exhausted from the Holocaust museum and walking my feet off around the mall - we had to park a mile away...  Off to sleep though i'm sure my dreams will be full of horrific images....  SM

       May 15, 2004   Greetings, and welcome to The Scarlet Mouse Blog! This is my first foray into the Blogsphere!  I'm pretty psyched.   It's a muggy Saturday morning here in Center City Philadelphia. Thank God the weather has warmed up, I cannot tolerate the east coast winters!  I am used to warmer climes as I hail from sunny, tempestuous South Africa. I grew up in Johannesburg and left in 1995 at the age of 25, after completing my law degree. I traveled to Israel where I thought I'd hang out for a while, but it turned into a 6 year sojourn - a mostly great time in my life when I got into computers, met great people and lived the Jewish dream for a while. I left in July 2001 mainly because I became an anxious wreck living in Jerusalem and constantly fearing becoming a terrorism statistic. I set off for Florida, USA where I had an ex-boyfriend. Dumped him but adopted Florida. Stayed there for a year and then landed a job with visa sponsorship in Philly, so off I went, to a city I'd never spent more than 4 days in...  Mostly my life here has been really good. I work for a Jewish non-profit, live in the city and have a wonderful boyfriend who we will call the Mouse Spouse.  The big news today - or should I say positive, happy news as opposed to all the ongoing shit with the Iraqui detainees and American baddies - is that South Africa won the Soccer World Cup bid for 2010!  This is so great, South AFricans are crazy soccer fanatics and the whole country is celebrating wildly!  This is the first time the competition will be on African soil - about time if you ask me!

      Every day I read the news I find myself feeling more and more angry at what is going on in the world. Sometimes I think maybe I should stop being such an insatiable newshound (mouse?), wouldn't I be happier if I just kept my head buried in the sand, blissfully oblivious to the daily parade of horrors around the world? I have a few friends who live like that...it's not that they set out to do this, they are just genuinely not very interested in the daily news. Growing up I always felt different from my friends in this way - long before the Internet I was reading the morning and evening newspapers. Part of this was an indescribable feeling of social responsibility to know what was going on in my own country under Apartheid. I knew shit was going on that was hidden or masked in the media. Every Friday I would religiously read the  urlLink  Weekly Mail and Guardian   - the so-called leftist publication that attempted to reveal what was going on in the townships and elsewhere. When I would inform my schoolmates that the SA army was murdering people just 30 minutes from our safe, white neighborhoods - they'd look at me as if I was crazy, label me "the liberal" (ha!) and repeat the crap their parents would tell them. In truth, my dad would tell me the same stuff, but I had my older brother B around to educate me about the real truth. For that I will always be grateful.  Anyway, today it occured to me that I needed my own color-coded barometer akin to Rumsfeld's pretty Homeland Security Advisory System - only mine would reflect my level of "pissed off-ness" based on daily events around the world.        Today is an elevated green day. A 49 year-old man and a three year-old child were killed in a missile attack next to a kindergarten in Sderot, near Gaza (the child's mother was critically injured). The attack on Sderot is the first in which one of the hundreds of rudimentary rockets fired by Hamas from the Gaza Strip in the past three years has proved fatal. This came after an attack on Sunday in which Palestinian terrorists dug under an Israeli army post in the Gaza Strip and blew it up, killing a soldier and wounding five others.  Then CNN is now reporting that the American Army Pfc. Keith "Matt" Maupin, held hostage in Iraq since April has been executed. Video released by his murderers show him being shot in the back of the head.  In the next two days, five more innocent hostages (three Turks, a Pakistani and another American soldier) held in Iraq will probably be beheaded as no country is willing to give into the demands of these scumbags. (The handover of power from the US to an interim Iraqui government took place today - BFD - like the violence is going to end now!)  The American soldier, Cpl. Wassef Hassoun is a Muslim Arab marine who worked as an Arabic translator. Hassoun's father pleaded from his home in Tripoli,  "I ask them for the sake of God, Prophet Muhammad and their children to release my son, and I thank them and they will have a great reward from God."   Wake up Mr Hassoun, these bastards are not going to spare your son's life because he is an Arab Muslim! He is an American first. An American-Arab Muslim - no doubt perceived as a traitor to Islam and his people. And with all due respect Mr Hassoun, these guys won't be getting any rewards from God, even if your son is spared...  SM

      Tonight I met the son of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg - Robert Meerpohl (he was adopted a few years after their execution). He spoke at Robin's Bookstore about his parents, his traumatic childhood (he was only 3 when his parents were arrested), post 9/11 America (McCarthy-era lessons for Ashcroft's America), and the amazing work he does now as head of  urlLink The Rosenberg Fund for Children . The fund was established "to provide for the educational and emotional needs of children whose parents have been harassed, injured, lost jobs, or died in the course of their progressive activities and who, therefore, are no longer able to provide fully for their children." This was an eye-opener for me, I niavely believed there were no "political" prisoners in America, or that there would be no kids who would need this kind of assistance in today's America.  I bought Meerpohl's book, " urlLink An Execution in the Family " and look forward to reading it.  This morning an amazing child passed away.  urlLink Mattie J.T. Stepanek  the young poet whose four volumes of work courageously detailed life and death, love and loss, faith and hope, has lost his own battle with the rare form of muscular dystrophy that had taken his three older siblings lives as well. He was thirteen years old. I have often seen Mattie on TV and marveled at his amazing bravery and optimism despite having to live with his awful muscular disease that kept him confined to a wheelchair, hooked up to oxygen, respirator and trach tube. As someone who was born with a very mild neuro-muscular disorder (Spinal muscular atrophy), I have always identified in some way with Mattie and other kids with muscular diseases. I always think how fortunate I am to have been born with only a very mild atrophy, able to live a normal and productive life save for having had scoliosis and dealing with respiratory challenges. Rest in peace Mattie, you were an inspiration to many. You will not be forgotten. The Muscular Dystrophy Association has established a  urlLink memorial fund  in memory of Mattie.  And now to the absurd. Saudi Arabia promised Wednesday that terrorists in the kingdom will be safe if they surrender within a month -- but after that they will face forceful consequences.  "If they give themselves up without force within one month maximum from the date of this speech, we can promise them that they are going to be safe."  Crown Prince Abdullah said all such people would be dealt with fairly, in accordance with Islamic law.  Now that just cracked me up!  I laughed out loud - "in accordance with Islamic law!" Last time I checked Islamic law (Sharia) you could be stoned to death for adultery. Sharia calls for punishments such as the severing of limbs, stoning, hanging and flogging, or beating. Countries that do practice Sharia include Saudi Arabia, Pakistan and Malaysia. Saudi Arabia is perhaps the most well known practitioner of strict Islamic law ( urlLink source ). So come on all yea terrorists, turn yourselves in and face the "fair" penalties under Islamic law.   My guess is there won't be a queue of terorists outside the palace...  SM

      Iraqi insurgents have killed the South Korean civilian they were holding hostage - his beheaded body was found earlier today. The murderers have the audacity to call themselves the Monotheists! How bloody preposterous - thugs commiting atrocities in the name of God.  In another show of moderation, tolerance and humanity so common in Iraq, Saudi Arabia and other Islamic outposts - CNN reports that the dean of law at Mosul University and her husband were found dead Tuesday morning outside their home in the northern Iraqi city of Mosul. The dean was the only woman to hold such a prominent position at the school and voiced moderate opinions, she therefore deserved to die.  What is Bush doing with himself instead of setting out to destroy these militant extremists who are cutting off heads with gay abandon, killing US soldiers and murdering civilians? Let me guess, he's out playing golf! It's time to stop sitting pretty and merely spewing pathetic condemnations every time someone gets beheaded or murdered. It's time to fucking do something! (Sorry mom, I know you don't like my swearing, but I'm just fucking furious!)  SM

      There is a lot to be said for dying young.  Don't misunderstand me. I am not suicidal or ready to exit this world. Not by a long shot. I love life and living every day. I just don't want to ever be old and helpless.  I spent the afternoon today visiting the Mouse Spouse's 91 year old grandfather at probably one of the nicest Jewish old age homes around. It has manicured lawns, caring staff, decent accommodations, daily activities and entertainment and none of that obscene stench of "decrepitude" you usually encounter in hospitals or old age facilities. However, anyway you dress it up - it is still a place where people go when they are too old or frail to take care of themselves. It is full of people with blank or dazed expressions on their faces, people in wheelchairs or with canulas of oxygen up their noses, and sadly, some forgotten people left alone to die while their children occupy themselves with other things.  As I sat there, listening to the afternoon's entertainment - a young women singing golden oldies to an assembled crowd of ambivelent looking old people, I was filled with a deep sadness. It is impossible not to imagine oneself living in such a place. I pictured myself, 3 foot tall, frail and helpless sitting in a wheelchair listening to some young woman singing Madonna songs...It was too painful to think about, and I could tell the same thoughts were running across the minds of the other visitors there to celebrate father's day with their aging parents/siblings/family.  By the looks on their faces, they too were thinking, just shoot me. I don't want to ever end up here.  SM

      Let's start with the sublime. Last night I trekked off to the Free Library to hear Helen Fielding - author of Bridget Jones's Diary - speak. It was great - she is just as witty as you'd expect. Although she denies vehemently that she is Bridget Jones, it was clear to me that she IS indeed her character - it shone through in her humor and funny stories.  I met my new friend Veronica at the talk - the first women I've met through Craigslist. What a pleasant surprise - a lovely, intelligent woman. After the library we headed to the Rose Tatoo Cafe for drinks and dinner. We hucked like old friends and had much to talk about. Cool.  And now to the horrific. I had just sat through 5 hours of meetings this morning (no, that was not horrific - tiring and tedious perhaps...) when I came back to my computer and invariably clicked home to see if I had any new Yahoo mail. I caught sight of the news headlines to read that Paul Johnson (of NJ), the Lockhead Martin guy kidnapped in Saudi Arabia, had been beheaded. First Berg, now Johnson.  I just went cold. I thought of his family. I thought of how terrifying it must be to know you are about to be beheaded...But mostly I thought of what fucking bastards, scum, these murderers are. How does one human being do  urlLink this  to another  (Warning: clicking on "this" will take you to the horrific pictures of a beheaded Johnson.  Sometimes I believe we need to see horror to really understand who we are dealing with and how urgent it is to wipe these vermin off the face of the earth.) I'm sick of Bush's cowardice, I'm sick of the world condemning these terrorists but doing fuck all against them. I'm sick of the hypocrisy!  Fifteen of the nineteen hijackers on 9/11 were Saudis and Saudi money has always funded Al Qaeda.  And yet America still calls Saudi Arabia "our friends"? Don't you find it rather convenient that the Saudis claim to have killed  urlLink Al Qaeda chief (and murderer of Johnson) in Saudi Arabia Abdul Aziz al-Muqrin  as he was dumping the body? Hmm, sounds just a wee bit suspect to me!  Michael Moore is on Letterman tonite - I'm going to stay up and check it out. I'm not too fond of Moore the person, but I do have great respect for his work. I thought  Bowling for Columbine  was fascinating, and I can't wait to see  urlLink  Fahrenheit 9/11   in which, among other things, reveals the connections between Saudi Arabia and terrorism - and the dubious relationship between Saudi Arabia and the Bush administration. I dig the movie poster of Bush and Moore holding hands like great pals of yore! Brilliant.  SM

      Tomorrow night Helen  Fielding , author of  Bridget Jones's Diary  is speaking at the Free Library. I absolutely loved that book, it was hilarious from cover to cover, and I'm pretty excited to have the opportunity to meet Helen and hear about her new book. This is one of the reasons I love being in the USA - in Israel or South Africa I never had the opportunity of meeting "famous" people. Well not exactly true. I guess there aren't many people who can say they've seen Nelson Mandela in person (I was at his graduation at my alma mater, The University of the Witwatersrand) - can't get much more famous than that!  Not only will I be meeting Helen, but I am also hooking up with one of the women  friends  I've met through my ad on Craigslist. She sounds lovely and interesting, and it should be a cool experience meeting someone new!  Today I recieved sad news that my friend lost her father to pancreatic cancer. He was only 61,  funeral  was today in NJ. My friends, his daughter, live in Israel where I met them both although they are both American. My heart goes out to my friend, one of my deepest anxieties/fears is losing my own dad. I mean I worry about both my parents, but my dad is 13 years older than my mom so I naturally worry more about him. He turned 80 in March. It's hard to live so far away from my family, I constantly worry about something happening there and having to fly out suddenly. Joburg is so frigging far (16-22 hour flight), it was so much easier when I lived in Israel (9 hour direct flight). I'm hoping to go home (SA will always be home) with the mouse spouse in January.... I love seeing my friends and fam, but it's such an intense, unnatural thing, to see people you love more than life itself for 2 weeks and then to not see them again for a year or two. God it sucks.  Anyway, back to my friend, I was contemplating making a sympathy call, but they are in North NJ and there is no train from Philly, and I'm not a long distance driver...So I thought until I figure that out, I should express my sympathy somehow (seems to early to call...they are probably still in shock etc) - and in America, that is done primarily via a condolence basket. No such thing exists in Israel or SA - I only discovered this phenomenon when the mouse spouse's grandmom passed away a few months back. All these baskets of food and goodies arrived at the house -- the house was positively drowning in cookies, cakes and candy. In South Africa food is also a part of a shiva house - but people tend to bring meals not send snack baskets... I found the whole practice rather weird. Similarly, at the shiva I was at, all the mourners ate a big dinner BEFORE prayers. Another major departure. Practices may differ globally, but one thing is true everywhere in Jewish house's of mourning: Death and Food are inextricably linked!  When in America, do as the Americans do. I sent a sympathy basket.  SM

      Phew, what a busy weekend, it's 10pm Sunday and I'm ready to hit the sheets. Yesterday me and the Mouse Spouse went to Rittenhouse Square to browse at Barnes and Noble, and then we walked 18 blocks to the Ritz Cinemas to see  urlLink Super Size Me  - a really interesting and disturbing documentary on the causes of obesity in America. The movie focused on the fast food industry with the director/writer undertaking a fascinating experiment: eat McDonalds for 3 meals a day for 30 days straight. The results were horrific - significant sclerosis of the liver, huge increase in cholestral levels, impaired energy and sexual function, and gain of 25 pounds!  Other disturbing facts quoted include the estimate that 60% of kids born post 2000 will have diabetes - and a dimunition of their lifespan by 17-27 years!  A really thought-provoking movie, and one that every American should be forced to watch!  (I have to confess however, after the movie I had a craving for a Happy Meal...:-))  Today I went with the Mouse Spouse's sister and niece to Willow Grove shopping mall -- in the two years I've been in Philly, I have been to ONE mall, ONCE - so this was somewhat of a novelty. Unlike most Americans and most women, I hate malls, and don't particularly enjoy shopping. Perhaps this is because I seldom leave a mall laden with exciting purchases!  Being a super petite, really skinny (read Freak in America) woman, finding attractive clothes is always a challenge, finding shoes is nothing short of a fucking tribulation! Clothes shopping is predominantly undertaken in kids' clothing stores - Limited Too, Kid's Gap, etc...but of late I find myself almost fitting into a size zero petite. Indeed, today I was thrilled to fit into a size zero slim fit jeans at The Gap. V-I-C-T-O-R-Y!!  Sophisticated Petite is also a store I often find clothes that  almost  fit (ie. need some tailoring).   But shoes, alas, is a hideous nightmare!  I am saddled with size 1 1/2  feet - forever sentenced to shop in kids' stores only!  Yes, American kids are pretty sophisticated these days, but I think more 12 year olds now wear adult shoes...so I'm stuck with a pretty poor selection.  Sometimes, when I pass adult shoes stores, I get this painful pang...what must it be like to be able to choose any shoes your heart desires? I guess I'll never know... **sigh**  SM

      It's been a few days since I last wrote. I am happy to report that my niece Noa has made a miraculous recovery. Four days after major surgery, she is  HOME !  This is all credit to her amazing strength and fortitude - she has flabbergasted not only all of us, but her doctors as well who had expected her to remain in hospital at least a week, followed by a stint in rehab to treat her lungs.  Kol Hakavod Noa! Thanks also to everyone who mentioned Noa in their prayers - I truly believe that this also led to this postive outcome.  Since I last wrote Ronald Reagan died. Ray Charles died. Brittney Spears had knee surgery. Tony S killed Tony B. Two people who I've never heard of won the French Open. And, researchers say they've found a dog that understands more than 200 words and learns new ones as fast as many children. In other words, it hasn't been a terribly exciting week.  As I've stated before, I'm very content with my life in Philadelphia. The only thing I've felt lacking every since I got here was the absence of female friends to hang out with. I have the greatest group on girlfriends on the face of the planet. But that's just the point - they are dispersed all over the planet - London, Israel, Canada, South Africa, NY, Atlanta, LA, DC - and not a single one of them resides in Philadelphia!  I have long whined about this predicament and feel it's rather pathetic that in close to two years I haven't managed to find some girlfriends. The truth is I haven't made much effort. At 34 I haven't really felt like investing my time to nurture new friendships especially when I have so many close friends who have known me for years, who have shared my childhood, high school and the ups and downs of life.  I have some lovely female colleagues at work, but we seldom socialize - most of them grew up in Philly and are not lacking in family, and a social life.  This week, I decided to stop whining and get proactive. No, I didn't walk around the city ambushing hapless females!  I did what you would expect an obsessive techie in 2004 to do. I placed an ad on  urlLink Craigslist  website announcing my willingness to meet intelligent women interested in friendship. The response has been wonderful - I have had great replies from interesting, educated, worldly women from a myriad of different backgrounds. Many are also not American, who found, like I have, that they don't have terribly much in common with the Americans they've met. I hope to meet some of these women next week. It's sort of weird, it's like online dating in a way, only different of course. Hopefully meeting them won't be as hideous as blind Internet dates!  Watch this space for more...  SM  PS Happy Birthday to my wonderful friend Croc in South Africa!

      It is after midnight and thousands of miles away, in Jerusalem, Israel, my beloved 14 year old niece Noa is about to undergo a spinal fusion operation to correct her scoliosis (curvature of the spine). Seventeen years ago, in January 1987, I too had a spinal fusion operation to correct my advanced state of scoliosis. It was a horrible period of my life, but like all of life's hardships, one gets through them and soldiers on. My thoughts are with Noa right now. I am unable to stop imagining her lying in her raised hospital bed preparing to be wheeled in to the operating theater for her 5-7 hour surgery. I know just how she is feeling - it was a mixture of fear, weary anticipation and a sense of just wanting to get it over with. I think harder than undergoing the surgery and recovery, was watching the suffering my parents endured seeing me suffer so. That and the helplessness, being exposed and unable to do a thing for myself for about 10 days after surgery. I couldn't move, I had to lie on my back and rely on nurses to turn me and give me painkillers. It was bloody awful, the memories still linger.  I pray that Noa will have an easier time, medicine has advanced in the past 17 years...kids tend to be up and walking after a day.         B'Hatzlacha Metukah, B'Ezrat Hashem hakol yehiyeh beseder.     Update (Sunday, 3:50pm)  Thank God the operation was a success and Noa is on the road to recovery. She is in a lot of pain and discomfort, but hopefully in time this will subside as her body recovers from the surgery.  SM

      Reuters reports today that  "Philadelphia, the City of Brotherly Love, has launched the first U.S. television advertising campaign to promote the city as a gay destination. The spot emphasizes the city's historic attractions and its friendliness to gay travelers and is part of a three-year, $1 million campaign using the slogan "Philadelphia - Get Your History Straight and Your Nightlife Gay."   Hopefully this will bring greater economic prosperity to the city, and attract not only prospective tourists, but residents too. While Philly's many top universities attract hordes of students nationally and beyond, for some reason, the great majority fuck off after getting their degrees... I'm sure Philadelphia isn't the most beautiful city in the USA, but it's a pretty cool place to live, the standard of living is more affordable than other east coast cities like NY and DC, it's diverse and has a lot to offer.  News that saddened me today concerns the  urlLink closure of the synagogue in Vilnius , which celebrated its 100th anniversary last September. No, it was not the victim of some anti-semitic attack. No, this was not some communist plot. No, it is not because there are no more Jews in Vilnius courtesy of Hitler. The synagogue was  "closed after fist-fighting broke out during Shavuot services between two groups of worshipers who wanted to have the other’s rabbi removed from the shul. The service also was interrupted by police, who were called in by one of the groups."   This situation really disgusts me. Who needs the Nazis when we can fight eachother and destroy our very own religious life? The Jews of Vilnius need to do some serious introspecting me thinks!  SM

       urlLink The View from Here blog  (written  by my friend Harry in Israel) alerted me to more craziness in the Holyland. In the religious enclave of Bnei Brak, they are now  urlLink segregating streets  - women on the one side, men on the other, and never the two shall meet! Let alone look at eachother. Of course the word "segregation" automatically gets my hackles up - segregation, apartheid...etc...and the joys of my childhood in South Africa.  Sometimes I feel that religion is the curse of the world - it's a tyranny - zealots killing, wreaking terror in the name of God. How many people have died in the name of Religion?  Still on the topic of religion, I had to give a chuckle at this article in the  urlLink NY Times  (I've given the Maariv link so you don't have to subscribe). It seems there are tiny crustaceans floating around in the NY water supply. If you know anything about Judaic dietary laws, then you know that all crustaceans are not Kosher - no shrimp, lobster, crayfish etc for we Jews!  Anyway, this latest discovery has the collective tits of all NY Jews in a tangle - and water purifying system sales are soaring!  I particularly laughed out loud at the statement describing these organisms as "little armadillos" - I guess armadillos are not Kosher either? Hmm, I should check! Anyone know if they chew the cud or have cloven hooves? They do have long shnozzes..does that help? :-)  Back to the topic of things South African. Ousted Haitian President Jean-Bertrand Aristide is now living it up in South Africa with his family - at the cost of South African taxpayers! I have to agree with this from the SABC (SA Broadcasting Corp):   The Democratic Alliance says South Africa cannot afford to host a leader whose country is "far removed from our national interest". Objecting to the arrival of Aristide in Johannesburg, Douglas Gibson, the DA spokesperson, said the money spent on hosting the deposed leader would have been better spent on poor people's needs.   With one in five South Africans HIV positive, and in dire need of medical services, the idea of hosting Aristide at the country's expense is offensive and unconscionable! Go home Aristide, wherever the fuck home is or pay your own way!  Finally, today's  Brave Woman Award  goes to  urlLink Ines Perez , who is believed to be the only woman known to have performed a successful caesarean section on herself.

      So, yawn, the Democratic Convention is underway in Boston.&nbsp; I have watched snatches of it - and I say snatches because it nauseates me to watch more than about 5 minutes at a time.&nbsp; I don't have the vote here as I'm not a citizen nor a green card holder (kind of ironic that&nbsp;I now get to experience what it is like to be disenfranchised like so many of my fellow-South Africans were for decades)&nbsp;- but as usual, I am fairly interested in what goes on around me, so I've tried to learn what I can about Kerry and Edwards.&nbsp; I'm still not sure what to make of them - I am quite put off by their pretty-boy looks (especially Edwards) and their huge personal wealth. How can someone with millions of dollars truly appreciate the needs of the average American?&nbsp; I sat and listened to speeches, the promises, Edwards tonight declaring "there is HOPE" and I just don't buy any of it.&nbsp; Has there be any improvement in access to healthcare here in the last 50 years? Is homelessness dead? Are the impoverished less impoverished? Are American children better educated now? My guess is that nothing really changes&nbsp; here, not for the masses.   It nauseates me to see the rapture on the crowds' faces as they take in the speeches, the loud music, dancing, glitz and glamor of flashing screens etc....I think about what this circus must cost - couldn't the money be better spent?&nbsp; I hate the fact that you have to&nbsp; have money to get into office in this country...   If I'm sounding communist or socialist, so be it. I don't see either as&nbsp;a dirty word. There are up sides to all economic systems, and downsides too.&nbsp; Lately I'm seeing a whole, ugly side to capitalism, and it upsets me profoundly.&nbsp; Take for example how the quality of one's whole life in this country is dependent on a number. Your credit score.&nbsp; Take for example how credit card companies continually try to entice people into obtaining new credit cards, then get you into a hole of debt that you cannot get out of because of crippling interest and other 'hidden' charges. I think it's criminal!&nbsp; And then you have me who can't get a fucking credit card because I have no credit history due to only having a social security number for 2 years.&nbsp;&nbsp; So I have to do ridiculous things like give my bank half my savings in return for a bank loan that I don't want or need, purely for the reason of trying to establish my credit. So I gave the bank x amount, they then gave me the same amount, and now I have to pay off the loan at interest of course, so I'm losing money doing something I really didn't need to do, but for the chance that it MAY help me establish credit. The only up side of all this crap is that it is practically impossible for me to get into debt cos I can't get a credit card!   I am happy to be in America, and like many aspects of life here, but the above just sickens me to the core.   SM

      Since celebrating my birthday last week, life has been more exciting than usual!   On Thursday night I went with my friend Veronica to see Cirque de Soleil. V won a CityPaper contest and landed two ace tix to the Cirque, free dinner at Christians and a limo to shlep us about. What a great evening it was. It was so cool to have a long, black and sleek limo waiting to take us to our various destinations - we got to sample a bit of the celeb life, and we liked it baby!  Cirque was unbelievable, and anything I write here really cannot do it justice.&nbsp; Many of the acts defied what we would expect human beings able to do,&nbsp; and gawking at the fabulous male specimans was a treat.&nbsp; Besides these two irritating blonde idiot woman sitting next to us who didn't shut up for one minute, the show was fabulous!   Other excitement this week revolves around progress in my writing endeavors.&nbsp; I saw a freelance job ad on Craigslist for a Grant Writer at U of Penn, and decided to apply.&nbsp; Turns out the job is for the biochem dept and the man in charge is quite an extraordinary character!&nbsp; His name is Dr. Britton Chance and if you google him, you'll see that he is the pre-eminant authority in everything to do with bio chemistry. He has three Phds, a gold Olympic medal, and at the ripe old age of 91, still works 6 days a week from 7am-7pm and cycles to and from work!&nbsp; It was an honor to meet such a man, he has the gentle manner and wry sense of humor, and one cannot but be inspired by his dedication to his field. When I asked, amazed&nbsp;how he manages to work six days a week at his age, his eyes lit up and he exclaimed, "I love it!"   So I landed the gig and spent much of yesterday editing a 48 page grant proposal on a hand-held breast cancer detection gadget.&nbsp; Besides the fact that I am the most unscientific gal around, I really enjoyed the work. I think deep down I am a wannabe school teacher, I get a kick out of correcting people's mistakes! I am hoping Dr. Chance will like my work and this will open up more opportunities with him and with the U of Penn in general.  Thanks to Craigslist I saw another post this week about a new neighborhood newspaper coming soon to various areas of Philly. They were advertising for writers, so I replied.&nbsp; Yesterday I got the email I have been wishing for ever since arriving in the States. The first line read, "Daniella, I really like your style of writing, I want you to write for us!"&nbsp; Woohoo!&nbsp; The first edition comes out in September and I'll be covering my Art Museum neighborhood - my first article will be restaurant reviews - rather ironic given my physique!&nbsp; This is the answer to my prayers, the opportunity to write freelance for an American publication - a means to get experience and get my name out there - the money, if there is any, is secondary!   So, so far, 35 is turning out to be great, full of new and exciting opportunities!  Onwards and upwards!   SM

      I can't believe it. Tomorrow I will be 35 years old!&nbsp; It's not that I feel or look old (some people still mistake me for a teenager - why is it that people always assume that petite people are young!?), but I do feel a bit down at the thought of approaching my 40's. Maybe I would feel less down about it if I felt I'd accomplished a lot in my 35 years. I know I know, I'm being hard on myself...there aren't a lot of people out there who have survived SMA, scoliosis, and two immigrations. I should be pretty proud of myself. It's just that in mainstream society accomplishment is measured at my age, in being married with a few snotty nosed kids in tow, a house with a picket fence, a golden retriever and a successful career.&nbsp; I'm not too depressed at not having the huge responsibility and 24/7 burden of caring for kids, but I would like to be settled down, own a nice comfy home (with or without the picket fence) and the dog. I want the dog more than anything, lol. &nbsp; AT least I have the fabulous Mouse Spouse in my life, being alone at 35 would really suck. I have great family and my health. I have a decent job, great friends (albeit not in Philly) and a good quality of life. What more can a gal ask for at age 35?&nbsp;  &nbsp; Happy Birthday to Me - I look forward to a great year ahead. Wow, blogging is great, I managed to cheer&nbsp; myself up!&nbsp; This is better than therapy! :-) &nbsp; SM

      Last night me and the Mouse Spouse went to the Keswick Theatre to see  urlLink Johnnie Clegg and Savuka  - probably the most well known South African band. It was so unbelievable to sit there and hear all my favorite songs, to hear South African accents in the audience and to get up and dance and scream!  He played many old favorites and some songs off his new album - it was so cool!  For those short two hours, I felt connected to my South African roots and it felt so damn good!  I will definitely see him again when he comes back next year! Rock on!  A few days ago, the International Court of Justice ruled that Israel's security fence is illegal and should be dismantled. The ruling was no surprise, to me anyway, the UN minions are consistently anti-Israel. I have tried to define my own feelings about the security fence, but I find myself "sitting on the fence" in this issue. I can totally appreciate the wisdom of Israel's trying to stop terror attacks in Israel - and largely, until today (a woman was murdered in a bomb attack in Tel Aviv), the fence has succeeded in significantly halting terror. What bothers me about the Fence is how it impacts on the lives of ordinary Palestinians - cutting them off from their land, schools and making their lives very difficult.  Should I care that "my enemies" lives are inconvenienced and made intolerable? Should I give a fuck when the bottom line is the Fence seems to be saving Israeli lives? This is what I struggle with.  I always try to distinguish between terrorists and ordinary Palestinians -- surely there must be Palestinians who do not support terror, who just want to live ordinary lives with family, jobs and food on the table? Sometimes it's difficult to believe their are "good" Palestinians, but to believe otherwise would be counter to my humanistic beliefs. I always think of Anne Frank's famous quote, that despite everything, she still believed that people were basically good.   Finally, congratulations must go to one  urlLink Phillip Rabinowitz  of Cape Town, South Africa, a 100 year old who set a new official record yesterday in a 100-meter sprint.  Way to go old geezer!

       In my last post I expressed how content I am living in America. After just having returned home from the July 4th Parade on the Parkway (literally a few steps from my door), I feel really euphoric to be in the USA. What I so love about living here is the diversity, shown so beautifully today in the Parade.   First of all, I had trouble deciding whether to look at the parade participants or just the hundreds of people milling about the Parkway. Both were rivetting. During the parade, representatives from every imagineable community strutted their stuff in their unique national or festive get up. There were the Irish, Polish, Philipino, Sikh, Indian, Pakistani, Chinese, Falun Gong, Bolivian, Italian communities to name a few. They all danced or pranced or marched to the general joy of all gathered. The Parkway was overrun with families and kids -- especially African-American kiddies with their hair in elaborate braids decorated with red, white and blue barette (American for clip fellow South Africans) - you can just eat them. Also in evidence were many many obese Americans, young and old, dressed in skimpy shorts and tank tops, sans a care in the world. I could sit out there all day and just people watch.   America fascinates me!  And I love to be fascinated :-)

      I just realized that three years ago today I arrived in America.        When I landed at Miami Internation Airport I had no idea that I would be permanently relocating from Israel to the USA. Initially I came just to check it out, to visit my ex-boyfriend who I was still close to, intending to stay two months. But I fell in love with south Florida - the tranquility, the beautiful beaches, the sparkling ocean and the complete lack of fear, anxiety and terror that was a part of my everyday existence in Israel. I also fell completely out of love with my ex. Despite the latter, I decided to return to Israel, sell or pack up my belongings, and return to the USA, full of hope that I would find a job and start a new life.  Things didn't exactly work out that way. 9/11 happened. Could not find a job in south Florida - luckily I still had work doing web stuff for an Israeli company, so it kept me going. I lived a vacation-like existence in Florida for a year. It was a wonderful time, but also a worrisome and lonely time too. I missed my friends in Israel and worried about my very tenuous legal status in the States. With two weeks left on my visitor's visa, I made a trip to Philly to visit family, and totally lucked out, finding a job at a Jewish non-profit. And so once again, I packed up and moved North to a city I was totally unfamiliar with, where I had no friends and little family. But two years on, I can look back and feel really proud of the life I have made for myself here. I really like living in America - I feel happy, secure and safe, I've met a wonderful guy and his equally amazing family, I like my job and enjoy everything this city has to offer!  Happy July 4th!  SM  PS If you don't hear from me again it means I've won the  urlLink megamillions  lottery - $290 million - and gone on an extended vacation! :-)
