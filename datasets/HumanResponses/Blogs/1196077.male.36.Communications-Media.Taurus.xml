      The text of the email I sent today to Vons/Pavilions:  Your policy requiring cashiers to address customers by name is MORE ANNOYING than I can properly express. My last name is long and difficult to pronounce, and I find it incredibly aggravating to have to stand at the checkout waiting while the cashier butchers it, stealing precious moments from my life while I answer their inevitable questions about pronunciation. I just want a quick thank you and my receipt, I don't want to give a Polish lesson every time I walk in the door of your store.

      I've recently applied for a job that would be perfect for me. I mean, you couldn't design a position more well-suited to a person with my background. It is a job at the Getty in the publications department. I would be preparing the guides and brochures for the newly restored Getty Villa in Malibu, which will house the Getty's Greek and Roman antiquities. If you know me, you know that I am all about Greek and Roman archaeology and publishing. But how do I go about making myself stand out in the crowd of applicants when they provide you with nothing more than a general HR email address, a snail-mail address, and a emphatic "No phone calls, please" on the web site? Suggestions?

      She had shaped a point through repeated grinding, dragging the end of the once first-day-of-school fresh pencil against the cinderblock wall far below the edge of her mattress. Day by day, she had honed it during the break between group encounter and art therapy, until it was as sharp as the period in an 18-point font.   If the housekeeping staff had been more diligent one of them would have noticed the flecks of yellow paint on the porous gray. But the orderlies never flipped the mattress, and they didn’t seem to care that the sheets never clung tightly under the wall-ward lower border of the bed. The cobwebs and dust bunnies beneath the frame were proof of their negligent sweeping and mopping. The only job they appeared to give their all to was tightening restraints; they liked that.  Lying in darkness long after lights out, Alma rolled the pencil back and forth between her flattened palms mesmerized by the dim flicker of moonlight reflected off the whirling sides. Years before she had seen an instructional Boy Scout video her brother had brought home. On the video a plain-faced young man in an eagle scout uniform had demonstrated various wilderness survival procedures. Her favorite was the fire. With a similar hand motion, the Eagle Scout had twirled a thin stick on a small flat board. The first curls of smoke snaking up from the tip of the spinning stick had thrilled her. When the camera moved in for a close-up of the technique, Alma watched breathlessly as the first licks of flame sprouted through the smoke, only peripherally aware that the action was framed by the young man's sturdy, khaki-clad thighs.   That was the morning of the day she had barricaded the door of her parents’ bathroom while her mother was inside showering and called 911, screaming hysterically to the operator that she had trapped an intruder in her home. She still smiled now replaying in her head the scene of her mother sprawled nude and sopping wet on the bedroom floor, her hands clasped behind her head as a police officer stood over her with his gun drawn, screaming, “Lady, don’t you fucking move!” When you’re seven you can do some pretty serious things without getting in serious trouble.  She put away the pencil, burying it deep in the mattress through an invisible rip in the ticking. Now she would watch time pass in the ten second blocks of blue illumination provided by the digital watch her mother had brought on her last visit. The gentle depression of a small button on the watch face activated the light. (Press) 27…, 28…, 29…, 30…, 31…, 32…, 33…, 34…, 35…, 36…, 37 … darkness. (Press) 39…, 40…, 41…, 42…, 43…, 44…, 45…, 46…, 47…, 48…, 49 … darkness. Her nights passed like this; Alma slept very little. She had lots of time to plan.

      I get sucked into Friendster because I'm bored and I'm pretty much burnt out on my job right now. And because I am really irritable, I end up disliking everybody; I'm overwhelmed with the desire to message certain people and tell them what utter dopes they are, never for a moment losing sight of the fact that I am also a total dope.   One thing good about Friendster is that it makes me glad that I don't live in San Francisco anymore. Sure, I love San Francisco, but the San Franciscans on Friendster remind me how utterly retarded the hip contingent is there. I hate the hip in LA but they're so mentally deficient here, it's like hating pre-schoolers. In San Francisco, most people are smart enough to be rudimentally self-aware, and therefore, lack any excuse for their adolescent poseur bullshit.

      The Shrub  I attracted the first of my many stalkers during my freshman year of high school. We'll call her Katie Shrubber. (What are the chances she could ever come across this? Hmmm.) We met in Latin class. I was a foxy bright-eyed 14-year-old scholar, all excited about learning the language of the dead Romans. She was the bespectacled temptress a row over and a seat forward with the back-brace and mannish clothing. Katie probably targeted me that first day while I was busy impressing our instructor, Miss Cheff (R.I.P.), with the first inklings of the genius that has distinguished my Latin career from that very first class onward. "Roma est in Italia." "Italia est in Europa."   She didn't make her move then; she bided her time, overcoming her shyness (or was it coyness?). Unwittingly, I gave her the opening she had been waiting for: Anne McCaffrey's dragon books! Up until then she was simply a curiousity or an amusement. (For example, I remember seeing her drop her pencil one day. It rolled a few inches behind her chair, within arm's reach of me if I leaned over a bit, but I was so tired. Her desk and her brace together created a physical quandary Houdini himself would have been reluctant to attempt. I was transfixed by her struggle to reach the pencil; it was truly epic. I was such an asshole.) After that first discussion about dragons and fantasy/sci-fi, the regular vain invitations to her swim practices began. I think she wanted me to see her outside the cage, so to speak.  Fast forward a year or two. Pretty much the same story. Sci-fi and comic book talks followed by frequent declined invitations to swim practice. But by Fall term junior year she wanted more and she grew bolder; she asked me to the Sadie Hawkin's dance. I was fucked! I didn't want to go but I was also way too big a wuss to actually tell her no. So I lied. I told her I couldn't go because I was going out of town with my parents. And then, of course, I quickly made plans with one of my fag hags to go to the dance together.   The evening of the dance there we were in the school lunchroom, disco ball spinning, Wham!'s "Careless Whisper" pouring out of the speakers. Karolyn and I were dancing; I was facing the stage, she was facing the crowd behind me.   "Oh my god! Katie's here!" she gasped.  Shit.  "Does she see us?" I asked.  "Yes."  "What is she doing?"  "I think she's crying ... or laughing ... I can't tell. Wait! She's got something in her hand ... ohmigod! LOOK OUT!"   That's when a cookie smacked me in the back of the head. Outraged, I turned to see Katie standing on the side of the dancefloor with an absolutely insane expression on her face. That face still haunts me in my dreams. Her eyes were wild and they seemed to glow, or maybe that was the glare from the discoball on her large plastic-frame glasses. Her short sensible hair seemed to have suddenly become unmannered, medusa-like and dangerous. Then she ran into the bathroom. The end.

      In high school, I was the hopelessly sheltered, socially retarded product of a Catholic home. I wore glasses held together by tape and wire, I was moderately anorexic, and I was incapable of speaking when approached with spontaneous greetings. I responded to a "Hi, Tom" in the halls at school with an unintelligible reply that was not language, merely a panicked series of grunts. I hoped people would think that my words had been lost in the clamor of the hallway as I skittered away. Since I did not have fabulous telekinetic powers, I guess I was less Carrie White than Ally Sheedy in Breakfast Club.   Every day Junior year, I drank a quick Diet Coke for lunch and then retreated to the library, where I hid next to a heater behind the stacks and read books that were usually about robots or dragons. Gawd, I was pathetic! If I could travel back in time, I would slap me. Maybe if there had been actual attractive males in my high school I would have had some other interests, but my school was full of dowdy Catholic youth. I really wanted a hopeless, obsessive crush but the guys were simply too plain. There were a few cute lower-classmen when I was a junior and a senior but ogling them felt way too trollish for me.   The only suspected fags in my class were the ridiculously effeminate Paul Ketty (who wore pink oxfords and brown penny loafers with, get this, dimes where the pennies were supposed to go!), the slightly less effeminate Nick Junco (who fled out the backdoor of a Detroit gay bar when I walked in the front door a few years ago. Pussy!), Brian Hurley (now Fr. Brian at some parish in Detroit. He was in my Brownie Troop, aka Indian Guides, when I was 7), dog-faced jock Bob Goodrich (despite his gorgeous body, he was too hideously ugly to consider), and freako Rob Kaye--he was the kind of kid who tucked his shirt into his underpants and ate his earwax.

      Back in the late '90s I worked at the Union Square Borders bookstore in San Francisco. I have endless stories of customer insanity. This is the first of many.  I dreaded working the cash registers more than anything. Not because operating the hopelessly outdated machines was difficult; I was in fact quite the virtuoso on the register keys--no one could ring faster than me--it was the people I hated. I was not user friendly in those days. I hated everybody. Everybody, of course, except Michael and Ronnie.   On the weekends, the afternoon lines would snake across the first floor. "Next," I would bark as I finished each transaction. Not "Next, please" or "Next customer" just "Next!" This generally unsettled the customer and gave me the upper hand in case they tried to get uppity. I was like an executioner on a busy day at the chopping block, hurrying the next person in line on their way to his or her decapitation.   So one Saturday in February, during our annual calendar sale, a woman appeared before me with a stack of calendars 5 inches high. There were signs everywhere in the store screaming "ALL CALENDARS $1!" The woman held up the first calendar in her stack and said, "This calendar doesn't have a price tag on it how much is it?"   "All calendars are $1," I replied.  "This one here, it's so big," she said, holding up a medieval manuscript-themed calendar, "it can't be only $1."  "All calendars are $1."  "Well, this one's so small," she said, producing a tiny calendar decorated with angels, "this one can't be a dollar."  "All calendars are $1."  "The plastic on this one came off and there's some wear om the edges ..."  "Every single calendar in that pile is $1."  That seemed to irritate her ever more. She pulled a book out of her basket and held it up at arm's length from me.  "How much is this book."  "I'm sorry, I don't the price of every book in the store. Why don't you look on the back."  She didn't like that at all, but I didn't care. If it had been up to me, I would have slapped her and chased her out the door with a can of Hag-Be-Gone.

      I know this will likely get me in trouble (or would if anyone actually read this) but I think homosexuals are filthy. Being a mid-level germophobe and an avowed homosexual, I can't help but be aware that the gays love to get themselves into lots of germy trouble. I know I shouldn't be shocked anymore, but I am everytime some acquaintance or other fills me in on some microbe-spreading mischief he's gotten into. "Oh, so you rimmed a guy in the underground parking lot before we met up at the movies? Couldn't you have told me that before you kissed me 'hello'?" Anyone who puts his tongue up a complete stranger's ass is living an utterly logic-free life.

      Our crazy old news editor is squawking to everyone that "the server's down" to justify the past hour she's spent lurching around the office talking about her cats to the newly hired designers in the art department. She can barely grasp Microsoft Word and suddenly she's an expert on the server.

      Tom Hanks, how do I hate thee? Let me count the ways. Has there ever been an actor more smarmy and cloying than Tom Hanks? Or a leading man more doughy-faced? I hated him long before his Oscar-acceptance speech for Philadelphia. I remember watching him on Bosom Buddies when I was a kid, thinking "Ick, where did they find this one?"   People rag on Julia Roberts and Halle Berry for their on-air Oscar meltdowns, but what about Tom Hanks? I  enjoyed  Julia's freakout; and even more than Halle's freakout, I enjoyed Cintra Wilson's description of it on Salon.com:  "Halle Berry made history last night, not so much for being the first African-American woman to win an Oscar in the best actress category, but for freaking horribly, uncontrollably out and making the worst, most hysterically rambling, discomfiting and liquefied acceptance speech in Oscar's 74-year history, and I thought Julia Roberts was going to hold that title for a long time. I know it was a big deal for Halle, who claimed her award for All Black Women Everywhere Ever, but her acceptance tantrum had such an alarming cringe factor, I had to leave the room. When they tried to pry her off the stage, she made that screeching Bilbo Baggins monster addiction-face when he Wants the Ring. It was a heavy, strange, grand-mal meltdown. America squirmed." (From Salon.com, March 26, 2002)  I'm prone to digressions. Forrest Gump cemented my deep disdain for Mr. Hanky. I've always hated the myth of the beatific idiot, whether it's a popular actor playing retarded or some mother of a Down Syndrome child declaring, "Personally, I find these children to be truly angels. You may not see it just yet but your family has been blessed to have such a child. You will come to see that as time goes on. They bring such joy to your life. They are sweet, innocent (all of their lives), mischievous, funny and give unconditional love." (from about.com) This idea that these extra-chromosomal people are idiot sages chock full of love and wisdom is offensive. Hanks fell for this hook line and sinker when he decided to play the role.   In his new movie, which I have not seen and never will, it appears that he plays another incarnation of "The Retard": the confused foreigner who bumbles his way into everyone's hearts (and Catherine Zeta-Jones' slutty stewardess' panties it appears). I'm sure by the end the pidgin-English-speaking half-wit teaches everyone some heartwarming lesson about the "power of the human spirit," or some Amor-Omnia-Vincit-language-as-no-barrier-to-love bullshit, or some other awwww-inducing hugs-and-puppies nonsense.   I think the only thing certain that can be said about the retarded (and Mr. Porky, Tom Hanks) is courtesy of "Retardation: A Celebration":   "Hi. This is Wilford Brimley. Welcome to Retardation a Celebration. Hopefully with this book I'm going to dispel a few myths, a few rumors. First off the retarded don't rule the night. They don't rule it, nobody does. They don't run in packs and while they may not be as strong as apes, don't lock eyes with 'em. Don't do it, puts 'em on edge. They might go into berzerker mode, come at you like a whirling dervish, all fists and elbows. You might be screamin' 'No! No! No!' and all they hear is 'who wants cake?'. Let me tell you something, they all do, they all want cake. That's it for the celebration. Guess the most important thing to remember is: they're just like you and me."  Yes, Tom Hanks wants cake, and as America's most beloved pudgy hack, he clearly gets lots and lots of it.

      My pet peeve du jour is entirely justified I think. My area at work is a four-desk space with a central aisle and openings on the east and west sides, which might resemble doorways if you were completely retarded. The new rocket scientists in the art department have been passing back and forth behind me on their way to the restrooms all week long. I've had to restrain myself from stabbing them with the plastic forks I have in abundance on my desk. Because I have a certain intensity, shall we say, I can't just say, "Can you please stop doing that." Even when I try my best to be pleasant and polite it doesn't translate. Either I make the person cry or I have a new enemy for life. It's my mutant superpower. I'm just not a pleasant looking person. I mean, yes, I'm stunning and gorgeous and all that, just in a rather severe way. My tennis-ball-sized eyes seem to broadcast reprobation on every frequency of the electromagnetic spectrum, whether I want them to or not.   Pet peeve two would have to be the IT Bear. All I did was ask to have Filemaker installed on my computer. You'd think I'd just killed his little cub. (Noooooo!!! Boo Boo!!!!) Bears like to pass themselves off as soft, fuzzy, and easy going, but it's all a big lie. When I think bear I don't think Teddy, I think Grizzly, so I've always been instinctively distrustful of the Bear "community." They like to act all comfortable with their obesity and hirsuteness—"I like being fat and hairy!!"—but secretly they're bitter and they take it out on everyone around them, sniping bitching and being generally unpleasant.

      Lucky you! You get a preview of a review I've written of Buffy the Vampire Slayer Season Six DVD collection.  When Buffy Summers claws her way out of her grave in the first episode of season six of Buffy the Vampire Slayer, the question that immediately came to my mind was: ‘Who buried her in that horrible dress? You’d really have to hate someone to put them in that awful rag for all eternity.’ I think I was meant to have deeper concerns. And that’s the problem here: I’m supposed to care about the existential angst besetting the Scoobies throughout this season, but I don’t. Their doubts and fears are intended to seem real and organic but instead they feel forced—dictated by plot rather than characterizations faithful to their established personalities. But, there are high points in the set. “Once More With Feeling,” the famous musical episode, is on par with the series’ best, like “Hush” and “The Body.” The special “making of” featurette and Joss Whedon’s commentary illuminate the fascinating origin of this delightful work of art. If nothing else this makes the package indispensable.

      I want a Stepford Wife. Against my better judgment I went to see the film with my friends Denny and Brantley this weekend. (When I want to see decent films I go alone. When I want to take part in a group activity, I'm willing to take in films I wouldn't normally choose to see.) The movie was bad but I've seen worse. Critics can parse it's many structural and artistic flaws, I don't have the energy for that. I choose instead to tear apart the actors involved.   Nicole Kidman is totally believable as a neglectful mother. In the first ten minutes of the film the children run upstairs to check out their new digs and are seen only once again for maybe ten seconds at a town picnic, where they're told to run off and play. I spent the rest of the film wondering if the kids ever returned from their picnic adventure or if they were nabbed by a pervert neighbor and entombed in a secret sub-basement dungeon. I can easily envision the former Mrs. Cruise bricking up her adopted brats in a disused wing of her mansion, with a nanny, some powdered milk, and a headshot of her Scientologized Stepford ex-husband to frighten the children into silent obedience. She might also force them to watch a video loop from "Magnolia" of their father exclaiming over and over "Respect the cock!" I'm sure Tom has done his share of cock respecting.  Glenn Close is now transforming much more quickly into the Borg Queen. I believe the nanobots are nearing critical mass. Yes, she's supposed to look frightening and strained in this film, but she's more terrifying here in pearls and a flowered dress than she was 15 years ago springing out of a bathtub with a butcher's knife.  Matthew Broderick inflates and deflates throughout the movie. Blech! I think Matty's sublimating his desire for hot throbbing penises by stuffing himself instead with Krispy Kremes. Either that or he's bloated from drinking, and who wouldn't drink having to wake up next to that horse-faced girl he's married to.  Christopher Walken Dead is as annoying here as he is in all his roles. I was sooo happy when he got his head knocked off in the end, too bad that doesn't happen in the first two minutes of every film he's ever made. The most overrated actor alive. I once saw him in Book Soup back in 1992. Really tall and femme wearing totally fruity black stretch pants.   Bette Midler is fine and underused as "The Jew" and Roger Bart is cute. Yes, I said cute. I don't understand it either. He minces and squeals and fashion-name drops but I felt all warm and fuzzy about him. I even think his eyebrows were plucked. What's wrong with me?!  So, the movie was bad but it made me realize how wonderful it would be to have a robotic slave to clean up after me. All of the non-robotic ones have fled after realizing that they weren't going to change me. (Really, if you want your bed made a particular way or your towels folded just like so, then do it yourself!) She could cook and clean for me and I would hide her in the closet when she wasn't actively engaged in making my life better. In my world, there's nothing more beautiful than a woman cooking and cleaning.   Random Notes:  Someone brought in two pies today from Marie Callendar and left them in the lunchroom. These people do not need more pie. Leaving out pies in a lesbian-infested office is like throwing out buckets of chum at the beach. Someone is likely to lose an arm or a leg.

      Here are some old entries from my now-defunct blog, Sins of Omission  Thursday, November 13, 2003 Halloween 2003, West Hollywood This is from a magazine feature I wrote. This is the unedited superfluous adjective/purple prose version.  The first raindrops to splatter Santa Monica Boulevard in West Hollywood in several months fell just as the first costumed revelers hit the streets on Halloween. The irregular sprinkles descended from a sky that in recent days had been darkened by smoke and haze from the legions of fires besieging Southern California. The deluge that followed was a godsend for the communities menaced by the firestorms, but the rain that poured from the long-quiet sky threatened also to extinguish the annual West Hollywood Halloween Carnaval.  On account of the inclement weather, attendance was significantly lower than in recent years and those who did brave the soggy conditions enjoyed a somewhat dampened fete. Out on the Boulevard, carnaval attendees in street clothes and black garbage bags noticeably outnumbered those in Halloween get-ups. Those in costume traveled most often singly or in small groups of twos and threes, frequently accompanied by plainly dressed friends who were insulated with coats and scarves and were huddled under umbrellas. Spectators and celebrants alike took advantage of every available shelter along the Santa Monica corridor, crowding closely together under the storefront awnings and the waterproof canvas of the food vendor booths lining the street. Hordes of sodden onlookers watched from the sanctuary of the Santa Palm Car Wash as the occasional drag queen shimmered by, shining through the downpour like a phosphorescent deepsea fish glowing in the featureless murk at the ocean's bottom.  Hamburger Habit at the corner of Robertson became the setting for an impromptu costume parade as dozens of colorful carnaval-goers took advantage of the haven provided by the restaurant's covered patio to preen, pose, and display their clever creations. Some of the costumes on exhibit were particularly unsuited for the rain-drenched Boulevard. A life-sized Oscar stood statue-like in one corner oblivious to the good-natured crowd roiling around him. His highly soluble gold-glitter body paint had sentenced him to the patio for the duration.  As usual current events inspired some of the Boulevard's more interesting ensembles. "Don't you know who I am, dahling?" cried one garishly outfitted woman from behind a semi-transparent plastic mask that was accented with painted red lips and rosy cheeks. "I'm 'Politics as Usual'." She was dressed in black form-fitting jeans and turtleneck sweater, her arms and legs festooned with pink plastic leis and long ropes of fuchsia flowers. An elaborate spangled bow ornamented each breast, and the strands of pink Mardi Gras beads circling her neck were hung with a ridiculously muscled, plastic action figure. On top of her head sat a flowery pink hat crowned by a red heart that read 'Politics as Usual.' It matched the larger, cut-out paper heart pinned to her midriff that exhorted: "Honk if You Were Groped by Ahhhnold!!!"  A ghoulish Dead GI stood nearby posing for bystanders with an unsettling rictus disfiguring his mouth. He was free of signage, letting his ghastly wounds and mirthless leer provide the commentary. The Right Wing Crusader who was sheltering in the doorway of the optometrist's shop on the corner of Palm was a strange mix of allegory and the just plain gory. He was dressed in the garb of a medieval Crusader and adorned with a hodge podge of severed rubber body parts and photos of right-wing luminaries, such as Trent Lott, Pat Robertson, and Patrick Buchanan. And while an imitation Roy Horn beset by a plush white tiger was clearly inspired by very recent news, the jailbird Martha Stewart and the Michael Jackson walking a pet pre-teen boy were obviously drawn from less current events.  The usual shirtless men were in short supply for most of the evening, but a few hardy souls partially disrobed and braved the elements. A troop of boyscouts adhered to that organization's chief tenet, "Be Prepared," by traveling en masse with a tent-like canopy of black umbrellas, stopping often to pose for photographs. Between shots they crowded together in an ultimately futile attempt to stay warm and dry--their wet olive-drab short pants and goose-pimpled flesh broadcasting their failure on both fronts.  Jesus the Son of God was present both in the flesh and the Word--the flesh was happily munching a Hebrew National kosher hotdog, apparently non-plussed by the rampant cross-dressing and the ad hoc paganism, while the Word was being joylessly proclaimed by two of his typically dowdy followers, who were carrying large banners threatening Hell and damnation for the assembled masses. A counter-demonstration erupted from an unexpected quarter when a dozen or more puffy-suited sumo wrestlers engaged the protestors, running in circles around them chanting "sumo, sumo, sumo!"  As the witching hour neared and the rain slackened, a well-dressed quartet of top-hatted calaveras appeared strolling silently arm-in-arm down the Boulevard. The garlands of bright yellow marigolds draped around their necks stood out against the stark monochrome of their old-fashioned black suits and floppy lace ties (jabots). The simplicity of their painted faces and the dignity of their bearing contrasted sharply with the colorful and ribald characters who had walked the street before them. They ambled slowly westward down Santa Monica Boulevard, seemingly as inexorable as the dawn, heralding the imminent arrival of Dia de los Muertos as midnight loomed.  Posted by: Tom / 5:19 PM  I went to a birthday party last weekend at a friend's house and there were two rabbits in the backyard hopping around on the lawn grazing, seemingly oblivious to the fifty homosexuals hopped up on Red Bull scattered around them. The bunnies were clearly tame; they must have escaped from their former owners and (luckily) wandered into Dan's backyard.  Dan feeds the bunnies fancy Spring Mix salad greens. He lives in an area my Cuban friend Damian affectionately calls "Taco Town", and is part of the first wave of sodomite gentrification. I have a vision of the bunnies in their former lives in a nearby home, trapped in a dirty wire cage filled with shredded newspaper and rabbit turds, happy if perchance a small Spanish-speaking child should toss a stale cornchip their way.   At Dan's party they were hopping around free at our feet munching grass and the edamame pods that some of the partygoers were tossing to them. It made me think of a family my friend G. knows. A rich Hollywood homo adopted these three kids whose mother was a messy drug addict. The kids have gone from skid row to Hancock Park like that. It's so Diff'rent Strokes. No more days alone locked in a squalid apartment with nothing to eat but ketchup packets and salt while Mom's out turning tricks for crystal meth.  I was following the bunnies around making little bunny noises and talking baby-talk to them when I suddenly stumbled upon a huge conflict, something I have with no other animal: I love bunnies, they're cute and cuddly, but I eat them, not often but when I do, I eat them with great relish. I can think of no other American food animal that is quite so adorable. I mean, I object to veal calves on principle but I have never had the urge to snuggle with one. I felt like Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde. Those poor bunnies had no idea that at any moment I could have snapped and twisted their little necks and popped them in a pot of boiling water.  Last night I looked at Neko as she was tormenting me while I did a crossword puzzle, and I tried to imagine eating her, but she's just too darn cute and far too opinionated to eat. I'd say, "It's time for you to go into the oven." And she would respond in her sassy little soprano, "Mwraaaoooww," which translates to "Whatever, you big loser! Now I'm going to sneak up behind you and bite your ankle!"  Posted by: Tom / 5:18 PM Tuesday, February 11, 2003  I applied for a position at UCLA library yesterday cataloging new acquisitions. I got an email this morning from the woman in charge of filling the position. She wrote:  "Dear Tom, I loooked over y our resume and I am not sure you have had any real experience with cataloging - however your familiarity with ORION and the UCLA system might be in your favor." (the typos are hers not mine)  Sometimes the stupidity of human resources people astounds me. What does it take to catalogue a fucking book? It's glorified data entry as far as I can tell. Does this woman, who has my resume in her possession, imagine that someone like me who has learned the complex systems of Ancient Greek and Latin in a very abbreviated period of time would have difficulty learning to enter information in a database? I'm certain there are some very talented chimpanzees who could be taught to do a no brainer job like this. I get the feeling that placement for this position is being handled by a company outside UCLA. Did she really expect that all of her applicants would have had prior experience in cataloging books to UCLA's database standards? I mean, how many people are walking around with such specific qualifications.

      Everytime I try to shake up my routine and do something new it seems I am thwarted by fate. Today I decided I would take a relaxed post-prandial stroll down to LACMA to buy notecards at the museum gift store. I imagined I would browse the goods, taking deep easy breaths as I rubbed elbows with school children and Junior League volunteers. I would enjoy the calm I generally feel when I am surrounded by intellectually stimulating merchandise. I can be such a museum-fag. But fucking LACMA is closed on Wednesdays, so I had to settle for the lesser pleasures of the La Brea Tar Pits museum next door.   I knew I was going to be disappointed when I passed the weatherworn fiberglass mammoths in the pond outside the building. Daddy Mammoth and Baby Mammoth stand on the shore stretching their trunks toward Momma Mammoth, who is caught in the tar. (Of course, these statues have no obvious genitalia, so what does it say about me that I would assume the doomed mammoth is the mother? Wishful thinking?) And, indeed, I was dissatified with the gift shop. Natural History museums are the red-headed step-children of museums as far as I'm concerned. They're akin to the sad roadside souvenir shops full of taxidermy and turquoise you see on Indian reservations ... without the drunk Indians behind the counter, of course.   After I left the museum empty-handed, I wandered over to the picnic tables set along the eastern edge of the park and tackled the the Los Angeles Times crossword puzzle. After about twenty minutes, I realized that the picnic tables were right next to the bathrooms. I had seen an older black man walk by me staring rather hard but I'd assumed he had a problem. Of course, I got paranoid. Maybe somebody might think that I was there to cruise the park restrooms and I was doing the crossword puzzle between blowjobs to keep my mind sharp. What's a 6-letter word for "head cheese"? S-M-E-G-M-A.

      I got up very early this morning. 5:30 a.m. Although the DMV doesn't open until 8 a.m., I knew I wouldn't make it there at all if I didn't get my ass out of bed then. I had time to kill, so I cleaned the bathroom obsessively for a half an hour after my shower. Of course I came back from the kitchen a few minutes later to find dirty little paw prints and hair everywhere. I scrubbed and wiped for another ten minutes. Why can't I just clean like a normal person? I'm either Joan Crawford or the filthiest man alive.   On the way to the DMV in Hollywood I stopped in at Starbucks for a latte and an NYT, and then I walked over to the line at 7 a.m. I was maybe the tenth person there. Everyone else was Mexican and they were all chattering away in their spicy, south-of-the-border Spanish. It was very festive. Hola, Maria! Hola, Jose! For a moment, I thought I was at a United Farmer Workers rally. But seriously, did I miss the memo explaining where the white people go to register their cars? Or do they all have their maids and gardeners do it for them? I'm confused and perplexed. The last time I was at the DMV it was the same exact thing. Very eerie.  The line grew very quickly. At one point, I felt light-headed and I was sure I was going to have an anxiety attack and pass out. I was mortified. I imagined all the Mexicans staring impassively at me lying on the sidewalk for maybe three seconds before they all cut in front of me in line. Perhaps I'd have awoken in time to see all their short, sturdy legs shuffling past me.  I didn't pass out, however. I finished the crossword and then finally they let us in and I was out in five minutes. Mission accomplished! And I was only two months late this year! That's a record.

       I am so in love with this group of chicks from Brighton, England. They're called Electrelane. I'm not even going to try to describe them. You should check them out at www.electrelane.com/site2/home.htm.      I'm also enamored of the Ditty Bops. Their sound is a sort of melange of modern ragtime/vaudeville/dream pop with tinges of Irish folk and the occasional '60s American/French girl-group pop sounds. Check out their web site www.thedittybops.com.      Another new favorite is Let's Go Sailing. They kind of sound like the Vaselines. See their web site at www.letsgosailingmusic.com.

      "Eating Disorder May Humanize Mary-Kate." That's the word from the Associated Press. Is this level of analysis really neccessary? Ronnie ( urlLink sublethal.net ), I'm sure you're similarly perplexed. Jack ( urlLink www.fauxjob.com ), I've no doubt you're intensely fascinated by this important observation. I too have been worried for a while that America may not be perceiving the Olsens as the prototypical girls next-door. It's been keeping me awake nights and edgy and distracted days.  How about if this were the world of "V," the sci-fi miniseries from the '80s in which rodent-eating bipedal lizards from outer space masquerade themselves as the nearly human neighbors from the next star system over. My favorite alien "Diana," one of the leaders, had a bit of a PR problem also--she was a real ball-buster; kinda hard to warm up to, sort of like Hillary and Martha. I think she probably needed an eating disorder too. "Eating Disorder May Humanize Diana?" What do you think about that?  My friend G____'s father is the Svengali behind the Olsen Twins' frightening global dominance. He is a truly fucked up guy. Think of Reverend Jim on "Taxi" only he's weirder and he's got million and millions of dollars. After sitting in the same room with him and fifty other people every Saturday morning for a couple of months, I've never seen him speak directly to another human being besides G_____. No wonder those girls have humanity issues.

      My brother called me yesterday to tell me that my father has prostrate [sic] cancer. I've been wondering if something like this was going to happen and I've been curious as to how I'd feel about it. Now I know the answer: I don't really give a shit.     Right after he gave me the news I gave him a stern lecture about the proper pronunciation of prostate. (I guess we faggots know how to pronounce it because that little gland figures more prominently in our lives.) "It's not a 'prostrate', it's a prostate. 'Prostrate' is when you're lying flat on your face on the ground. Repeat after me, 'prostate.' " I could just see my family sitting around the kitchen table talking about Dad's 'prostrate cancer,' or worse having discussions with  doctors about it.     I know my brother pronounces it that way after my father's example. For whatever reason, we've all had a lot of conversations about prostate troubles; I think maybe some of his heart medicine has affected his. My dad has always called it a "prostrate" no matter how many times I've corrected him. As if I don't have enough evidence already to refute the claim he's made to me as long as I can remember, "One day you're going to realize that your father is the smartest man you've ever known." Obviously, he realized early on that I've always thought he was a complete fucking retard.

      I'll bet you can't wait to hear about Carol Channing.  You know, I'm less excited about writing this than I was right after the show.  The opening act, Toni Morrell, was utterly bizarre. She was this amazonian singer from northern England wearing a spangly bodysuit and a matching blazer. She kept doing these high kicks while she sang Shirley Bassey and Liza Minelli covers. She also had these really annoying vocal effects

      Something is seriously wrong with me I fear. I can't stop sleeping. Every night when I get home from work I collapse onto my bed with every intention of lying down for a few minutes to recoup my energy levels and end up falling asleep for the rest of the night. Is it cancer? Mosquito-borne encephalitis? MS? Narcolepsy? A friend thinks I'm depressed. Hello! When haven't I been depressed? I am not inordinately depressed. I am in fact less depressed than my lifetime average.

      Smack the shit out of me, please!    Here's a random musing: I found this silly S&M magazine in the mail at work. Inside are pictures and reports of all these people spanking and flogging each other, wrapping each other in rubber, tying each other up, etc. There are dozens of pictures and announcements of parties. It's a glossy little B&amp;W digest that is of fairly high quality. So obviously there are a lot of people out there like this who get together and hang out and have fun beating on each other or whatever. I, however, have always have trouble finding likeminded people to hang out with. You like getting tied to a scaffolding and beaten with a wooden spoon and people are lining up around the block to be your friend and share experiences; but if you like books, music, art, science, politics, pop culture, blah, blah, blah and you're shit out of luck. Consider this flogging: not really so kinky after all. Thinking: really kinky.

      "Spider monkeys they don't have sphincter muscles so when they have to go they just go." That's what the news editor just said to the news writer. Don't know what they're talking about and that's all I heard, so you figure it out.     What I do know is that I'm crossing spider monkeys off of my list of potential cross-species love interests. Sure there might be chemistry, but without the sphincter why waste my time?

      The people in our art department, although for the most part well-meaning, are not very bright. Each week they have their departmental meeting in the lunchroom at lunch time. They sit there for two hours occupying all the chairs and I doubt it's occurred to any of them that they may be inconveniencing others. Realize that we also have a conference room.     You'll remember of course that I recently had a problem with the art department folks cutting through my workspace on their way to the restrooms. I put up a sign saying this is my workspace not a walkway and amazingly they stopped. I left the sign up for a couple of weeks to let it sink in. on Friday last week I took it down. Within an hour the new lesbian one walked through. What is wrong with these people?

      The other day a friend asked me if I've ever fisted anyone. The funny thing is I had to stop and think about it for a second. I said "no" but I'm still thinking "am I sure about that?" What's that all about?    Memory  (read "blackouts") is weird, I guess. More than one person has told me that I behave like someone who was sexually molested as a child. (?!?) Of course I have no memories of anything like that. But I've added that to the script of the imaginary Lifetime movie of my life. I see myself as I am now, lying in bed tossing and turning, muttering "no! no!," my arms flailing about as blurry dream images flash on the screen: assorted naked body parts (a thigh, a quick shot of buttocks, perhaps), a goat's head, a bloody dagger, a handsome shirtless man leering (hot!), a pentagram, people in red hooded robes chanting.     Of course in the film I trace it all back to the satanic sex abuse cult that operated in the woods around my family's summer home in northern Michigan. I figure I'll make the ringleader the creepy former army-chaplain who was the priest at the Catholic church we went to in the nearby village of Elk Rapids. He wore a military-style haircut, horned-rim glasses and had huge square horse teeth. Since Elk Rapids was truly a village of idiots, I guess I'd have to fabricate a character to be the sexy, tall-dark-and-handsome molester.

      I've fallen in hate and it makes me feel like singing! We have this new graphic artist working here who bugs me. Yes, I know, everyone bugs me, but he's extra-special. He's a short, over-muscled Hawaiian circuit boy who is always wearing too-tight t-shirts and hip-huggers. That's annoying enough right there. But, then, he walks by my desk every day and makes a point of catching my eye and says in an overly sincere tone, "Hi, Tom. How are you?," with this look on his face that says "I'm gonna share some of my inner sunshine with Mr. Grumpy," or "I'm doing you a big favor by saying hello to you," kind of like the expression I imagine the retarded or the crippled see when someone deigns to pay attention to them.     This makes me think of the people who used to approach me in bars and blurt out, "Smile!!!" I don't really go to bars anymore, on account of my dipsomania, but if I did, those people would not simply get the sneer I used to give, they'd get a punch in the fucking mouth. I've been taking boxing lessons for several months now and I'm all set to Take Back the Night.    -----------------------  Who else has noticed this ridiculous produce trend "Grapples"? They're apples that taste like grapes. I think if I wanted to eat something that tastes like grapes, then I'd buy grapes. As it is, I eat several apples every week because my office is next door to a Ralph's and they have good apples. Now every time I bite into an apple for a split second I taste grape. Weird.

I was supposed to go on a gay press trip to France yesterday, but the trip was cancelled a few weeks back. I was pissed off at first but honestly what did I expect from the French?     There are a lot of things I'd do for $5000. Considering the things I've done for free, the sky's the limit  , really  . So if you've got the cash and you're interested in making a hard-working nerd happy, let me know.

      I just read a news report of an 80-year-old man who was driving and confused the gas pedal for the brake pedal. He drove through the front of a Subway sandwich shop and killed a 27-year-old man, who was standing in line about to order one of their new low-carb wraps, which I think are totally delicious. The poor guy was practically decapitated.  But still, I don't think we should make any special driving restrictions for old people. I'm serious! I think we should simply gas them when they hit 70. Really, what good are they doing anyone? Driving around killing people with their cars and talking everyone's ears off whenever they get the chance. After a lifetime of exposure to old people I've discovered they do not in fact have any special wisdom to share with the rest of us.  I waited for years with bated breath, like a supplicant before the Oracle at Delphi, anticipating insight and guidance, but it's always the same old stories: "When I was in the Navy I lived in a trailer with my friend Paul...," "I jogged around Belle Isle six times every morning and there were no coloreds there then...," "your great-grandma took the puppies and put 'em in a bag and whacked the shit out of them with an axe."  My dad is 65 and the last time I drove with him I was terrified much of the time. We took a cross-country trip together a few years back. I thought I would be able to relax and study during his turns behind the wheel, parsing difficult passages of Ancient Greek while America slid by my window. But I ended up watching my Dad and the road like a hawk. I was afraid to blink even.  He would randomly weave from lane to lane, drifting across the highway while he fussed with his cellphone, or the automatic seat, or the visor, or his sunglasses, et cetera. He would usually pretend that he'd meant to switch lanes: Mid-swerve, just before we went onto the shoulder, he would snap back to attention and regain control of the automobile.  When he wasn't attempting to steer us to our deaths, he was driving straight down the middle of the white center line, blocking both lanes of west-bound traffic. The stress level of spending a week in the car with him was not on par with a year at Guantanamo Bay but it was definitely up there.

      We've had a big shake up at work today. The two top dogs here have been deposed. The coup was swift and sneaky and I loved it! A company-wide meeting was held this morning during which the big announcement was made. I had to work very hard to keep the satisfied smirk off my face. I didn't hate the former bosses, I just had a sort of dull resentment worked up against them. I think one of them meant well but she was simply incapable, the other was neither capable nor well-meaning. Schadenfraude? I wouldn't go that far. Yes, I do enjoy the misfortunes of others for the simple pleasures they provide, but most of my happiness in this case comes from the possibilities this shake-up provides for our magazine.

      I'm clean out of ideas so I thought I'd air a small commercial for www.sublethal.net, which is written by someone who is much funnier than me. I won't tell you his name because he's prefers to remain anonymous.   " Signs of Trouble  * You announce to the room that you just don't feel like yourself today, and a small murmur of relief reverberates amongst your loved ones, including the cat and the dog, who look at each other and then look back at you.  * In the bustle of the farmer's market you overhear a voice say "...that pugnacious faggot..." and your first thought is that maybe it's a friend of yours talking about you. You look quickly in the direction from which the voice seemed to emanate, but all you see is a brittle grandmother palpating melons and a moody teen presiding over a wooden crate full of vaguely extraterrestrial-looking root vegetables. Later after a couple of rejuvenating Odwallas you incorporate the boy into a vivid sexual fantasy, a sweaty vision in which you are thumbing his perineum like someone impatiently pressing for a sluggish elevator, but then the melon hag makes an uninvited cameo appearance in the daydream, putting strong deflationary pressure on the economy of your southern states."  See www.sublethal.net for more. "Niggling concerns" is a recent entry that will have you giggling to yourself and nodding your head.

      IN THE MANNER OF G.S.  Wherever I travel Greece wounds me.  On Pelion among the chestnut trees the Centaur's shirt slipped through the leaves to fold around my body as I climbed the slope and the sea came after me climbing too like mercury in a thermometer till we found the mountain waters. On Santorini touching islands that were sinking hearing a pipe play somewhere on the pumice stone my hand was nailed to the gunwale by an arrow shot suddenly from the confines of a vanished youth. At Mycenae I raised the great stones and the treasures of the    house of Atreus and slept with them at the hotel "Belle Helene de Menelas"; they disappeared only at dawn when Cassandra crowed, a cock hanging from her black throat. On Spetses, Poros, and Mykonos the barcaroles sickened me.  What do they want, all those who say they're in Athens or Piraeus? Someone comes from Salamis and asks someone else whether he "originates from Omonia Square?" "No, I originate from Syntagma," replies the other, pleased; "I met Yianni and he treated me to an ice cream." Meanwhile Greece is travelling and we don't know anything, we don't know we're all sailors    out of work, we don't know how bitter the port becomes when all the ships    have gone; we mock those who do know.  Strange people! they say they're in Attica but they're really    nowhere; they buy sugared almonds to get married they carry hair tonic, have their photographs taken the man I saw today sitting against a background of pigeons    and flowers let the hands of the old photographer smoothe away the    wrinkles left on his face by all the birds in the sky.  Meanwhile Greece goes on travelling, always travelling and if we see "the Aegean flower with corpses"' it will be with those who tried to catch the big ship by    swimming after it those who got bored waiting for the ships that cannot move the ELSI, the SAMOTHRAKI, the AMVRAKIKOS. The ships hoot now that dusk falls on Piraeus, hoot and hoot, but no capstan moves, no chain gleams wet in the vanishing light, the captain stands like a stone in white and gold.  Wherever I travel Greece wounds me, curtains of mountains, archipelagos, naked granite. They call the one ship that sails AGONY 937.     -- MIS Aulis, waiting to sail. Summer 1936    --Seferis

      On Akrokorinth  The sun set over Akrokorinth burning the rock red. From the sea a fragrant smell of seaweed now began to intoxicate my slender stallion.  Foam on the bit, the white of his eye bared fully, he struggled to break my grip, tight on his reins, to leap free into open space.  Was it the hour? The rich odors? Was it the sea's deep saltiness? The forest's breathing far away?  0 had the etesian wind held strong a little longer, I would have gripped the reins and flanks of mythic Pegasus!  -Sikelianos

      I've figured out a new criteria for how I evaluate people and the place they may occupy in my life. I don't go to potlucks, but if I did and if I would choose not to eat the dish you brought, then I probably wouldn't want to be your friend. We're not talking about the general yumminess or lack thereof of the food itself but rather the ookiness involved in imagining eating anything you made in your kitchen out of sight. Does this make sense? Of the four people who I know are reading this on a fairly regular basis, I'd eat the dishes three of you brought to a potluck. Number four, I think you know who you are.

      I'm reading "Colossus of Maroussi" by Henry Miller, in which Miller recounts his travels in Greece immediately before WWII. I started reading it once before when I spent the summer in Greece in 2001. I don't remember why I lost interest but I never finished it. I like it ok this time around but sometimes Miller is an overwrought, hysterical romantic and a lot of his observations about the Greeks are either silly, dehumanizing or both. He depicts them as the noble savages of Europe. Over and over he compares them to animals, trying I think to highlight their unspoiled passionate natures, but he totally fails and instead makes them seem base and subhuman. For example, he goes on and on about this six-toed woman's "teats" and more than once he calls certain men "baboons". Charming, really.  A lot of his other observations are interesting, however, and I'm a big hellenophile so I've kept reading. Out of the blue he floored me with a total non sequitur. He's in Heraklion on Crete talking nonsense about Knossos, which he had just visited (he admits he knows nothing about the actual history or archaeology) when suddenly he says, "I got the jitterbugs and made caca in my pants." I read that at least three times, trying to figure out if I had missed some sort of marker in the text that would have prepared me for this infantile announcement, but there was nothing. Miller repeatedly disdains Americans (he's one himself) for their immaturity and oafishness and then he drops this whopper. Bizarre.

      I was reading my friend Ronnie's blog (www.sublethal.net) today and in it he mentions waking up too early with too little sleep and going to a kitchen filled with "sickening morning light." I instantly felt as though I had been retracted 6 years into the past to the apartment in San Francisco I shared with my ex-boyfriend. I remembered the kitchen filled with sickening morning light during those days along with constant feelings of dread and reproach. When the memory hit, I had a stomach full of two bowls of Special K and an apple; I nearly vomited all over my desk.   The way some crazy old veterans recall Vietnam, I remember Brad. While they scream and cower when a helicopter or airplane flies overhead, I recoil whenever I see a short fit balding man with a patch of hair on his lower lip. The veterans' one-time nemeses in Vietnam were small and relentless like weasels and so is Brad. He had the amazing talent for seeking out bits of ego to crush in an individual like me at the time, someone who had long since determined himself to be utterly free of self regard.   I was surprised a few years back when his father died and Brad traveled to Colorado for the funeral, surprised enough, in fact, to blurt out, "Why?!" when he told me he was going. He hadn't spoken to his father since he was 16 or so. From all reports the man was a sadistic, abusive alcoholic who hated fags. Brad had never said a single kind word about him to me and here he was dashing off to beat his breasts, rend his clothing, and pull out his hair alongside his many sisters. He was outraged at me for asking this simple shocked question. He used it as a convenient excuse not to repay the $800 I loaned him for his failed homewares store. Thanks a lot, asshole.

      Later on I'm going to write about the new traffic circles that have been installed in my neighborhood.  The Land of Entitlement is not the place for traffic circles. A few blocks south of Sunset and a few blocks east of Doheny lie two very busy intersections within a residential neighborhood. They used to be four-way stops, but now the geniuses in West Hollywood City Hall have installed two mini traffic circles. Undoubtedly, they think they are being trés European, but in reality they are being as retarded as usual. But really what do you expect from a city whose last two mayors have been respectively a sexual harasser and a drug addict?   First off, these intersections are too small for a traffic circle; you're on top of them before you can see if there are any other cars heading into them. Secondly, this is L.A. at the border of Beverly Hills and West Hollywood. The sense of entitlement here is stronger than almost anywhere else in the world. No matter the evidence to the contrary, everyone thinks they deserve to be first. There's another car already in the circle? Who cares! I'm going first. Thirdly, the intersections are located a few blocks from the fag bars on Santa Monica. That equal drunk queens behind the wheel. And finally, add a liberal dash of crazy Russian cab drivers, who follow no rules of the road, and you have two incredibly dangerous vortices.   This is the same city that hides cross walks behind lush stands of foliage and decreases the available lap swim hours at the city pool during the summertime. If you want something dolled up and made pretty, hire a fag! If you want a well-run, efficient city, do not call Mary!

      I saw the Ditty Bops at Largo the other night. Those girls are severely talented and utterly adorable.

      I have no time for half-hearted friendship.

      I know it's passe but I still spend entirely too much time on Friendster. It was inevitable, I suppose, but I've developed a list of Friendster pet peeves.  Guys who claim that they're not the typical gay guy and then they totally are. It's like tattoo, check; fauxhawk, check; Confederacy of Dunces, check; David Sedaris, check; Bjork, check; et cetera. Who do they think the typical gay guy is?  People with a series of pictures that either do not clearly represent them or are deliberately oblique--you know, pseudo-arty nonsense. You know what? If you're gonna send me a message, I want to know what you look like; I'm shallow that way. I got sober a year and a half ago, so I never have to fuck another ugly person again. And if you think you're going to trick me into falling in love with your beautiful insides before I see your hideous outside, you are misguided. People need to own their ugliness.  Men who claim to be "laidback" or "drama-free." I'm sorry but you're gay and whether you recognize it or not, or like it or not for that matter, you are a drama factory.
