      When those bastards let me go, they actually insulted me by trying to escort me out.  I say 'trying' because the moron who let me go stopped in the reception area to talk to someone and I guess he actually thought I'd wait for him.  Yeah, right.  I went downstairs, left the property and then came right back up as a visitor to talk to some of my friends.  They were as, or even more, freaked out as I was.  For quite some time after, months even, I thought I might actually get a call back from them.   Denial - it's what's for dinner.   I was gone, toast, history, but still hanging on to the hope.  Pathetic.  They paid me double the legal amount it costs to let someone go without notice, and were done with me.  I had some cash, and EI coming, but I had to get a job eventually.  So I thought, hey Dude, you got's some serious experience there, go see the competition.  Next: The Competition

      How did I get here.  Not a question, a statement of dis-belief.  I worked for a security company, for 13 years, first in the field as a guard and then in the office in various roles.  I did my job as best I could and by all indications the powers that be were very happy with my work.  Like most people I believed all the corporate garbage spewed out by the HR department about how we "value" our people, and how our employees are our "greatest resource".  Yeah, so was coal, and like a lump of coal they expect you to burn bright all the time until you are used up or they find a new source of power.  Then you are nothing to them but something to be disposed of as efficiently and quietly as possible.  Bitter?  Me?  Oh, fuckin yeah.   Apparently it came down to money.  The investors wanted more profit in a very short time so myself and about 30 others were let go.  FIRED- Downsized, restructured, position-made-obsolete, no matter how they slice it - FIRED.  Using a buzz word just made it legal to let a couple dozen people go without cause.  Well, fuck 'em.  I moved on.  Unfortunately, when you work for only one company for so many years moving on isn't all that easy.  You find your contacts are useless (everyone you know works/worked with you) and your job skills are fairly specialized to that one company.  You spend some time in suburban Denial and then move into a lovely flat in I'll-work-for-the-competitorville, then you finally find yourself in a basement apt in the outskirts of TempLand.  And that, my friend, is the real Hood.   More to follow .........
