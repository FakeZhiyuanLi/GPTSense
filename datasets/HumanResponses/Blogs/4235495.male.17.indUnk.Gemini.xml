      I feel like I'm ready to hurt my brother, badly. The kid has a friend over for the day, he's not a bad guy, but all he can talk about is those hot girls on the olympics, is there something in life that he would not tap? I understand he's 14 but not even I was that bad, the kid needs a life and fast.   My life continues as a constant workout, I wake up, eat breakfast and im up to the gym near my school for 2 hours, the place is empty, the way I love it, i'm not social when im there, I do my shit and I get the fuck out, the girls at the front desk are extremely attractive, they know me as that tall guy from school, usually a little chit chat, oh how long u been going here things like that, nothing to be excited about. I get in there and im a different guy. There's something about it that i love, i just love to lift weights ya know. I want to be about 230 pounds, thats my goal, ripped to shreads without losing any speed or power. I want to be quite the basketball player by the end of the year, thats my ultimate goal, its what i desperately need.  You ever wonder what it's like a year from now, because right now i have no clue about anything. I want to do something business related at university, whether that university be in Canada or the United States i dont know, basketball scholarship or not, I feel like im not even smart enough to leave her, its a big city that i want to get out of, I want to live in new york, thats the dream, be a broker or a trader like my dad, thats something i want to be, and i believe that basketball is the way to get me there. Sometimes i just hate the sport, the politics, and everythign that comes with it, other times, especially in a championship game when the pressure's on then i really love the feeling. Playing in front of 3000 people was the most exhilerating moment of my life, and thankfully i dropped 30 and my team won in double overtime, one of the best moments in my life that i'll never forget.   Ive been watching the olympics, i dont see how people just can't love it, i mean its increadible to watch, to me theres nothing better then the games, somethign just gets to me, i'd love to go to one, they seem so increadible, something i would never get tired of. These sports that u rarely see, there increadible to watch, basketball is more like second rate compared to sometin like weightlifting or track and field, its exhilerating really.

      For once in my life I actually feel like the normal person in my family.  You have my brother, the annoying little 14 year old whose just realized that he actually has a penis.   The kid can't do anything without saying that oh that girl is babealicious or babetastic or any of that crazy crap, the kid desperately needs a girlfriend, I doubt he's ever kissed a girl.  For those who don't know me, which is all of you, i live in a suburb of toronto, mississauga, a big ass town where anything and everything can happen like that.  I live in a nice neighbourhood, quiet full of old people waiting for Matlock to come on.  I have my friends, but im not attached to any group or people ya know.  Kinda strange i've never had a serious girlfriend, at 17 i have issues, the girls say somethin like oh but ur so cute u'll find someone, ya sure there baby.  Im a different guy, im 6'9", i get alotta looks ya know, people wondering what the hell i eat and all that crap that you ask when you see someone my size.  I play basketball, apparently im considered a division 1 prospect to coaches, but I suck if you ask most players that know me.   Im not well liked on the court, i have an attitude and confidence level, although sometimes i have no confidence at all, which makes no sense.  Im skinny, at about 190 i need some weight, but im a workout feind, lift 5 days a week, just to get that scholarship ya know.  I live through basketball, i dont feel smart enough to get a good degree without it, i can play ball here in canada i think but the states will be tough, but i might just be able to do it with some work.  I hear it alot that oh ur tall so u hafta be good, being skinny is even worse than being short, its so tough but its something i have to get through.   I got a little brother, he's 6'5", the family's preferred child, because he went to summer school after he failed grade 9 math and got a 81 in summer school, all of a sudden i should've gone even though i passed everything, thanks alot.  He's too afraid to do anything risky in his life, he will never do anything that is considered against the rules or anything, my parents raised him to be like that, with me i developed a mind of my own rather, and started to talk back using clever comebacks usually ending up with a smack in the face.  He's never had a girlfriend, i doubt hes kissed a girl, but at the same time the girls think hes cute.  He listens to my dad, does whatever he says and salutes, if it has to do with anything outside the house, inside hes lazy, cant get off the tv to do anything, but hes been given natural talent, something ive been jealous of.  People like him for him, they like me because im different.  Its strange.  My parents call me lazy, but not him, and im out lifting weights and playing basketball 5 hours a day every day, but its because while he plays pool in the basement im on the computer reading about things i can learn.  I have a passion for learning, i want to know so much more, i feel like if i just sit there all day ill know nothing by the time i die, what's the fun in that.  I want the best in everything in life, and I feel that knowledge, along with basketball will get me to that point.  Life is complicated, i love to learn about different things and different people, its something i have a passion for.  I love to talk about training athletes, theres just something i ike about that, im a moderaotr at a forum, and know just about everything there is to know, but at the saem time, like everyone else im a student, still learning after a while.   Today came with my parents screaming, my mom, the scary french canadian, wants a schrub cut off, my dad says no, my mom cannot handle that.  5 hours later their yelling, pushing and shoving each other, it was sort of sad to see it, my father is the self sufficient man who constantly tells himself he needs nothing and no one to get by through life, and i bet he could, he's a smart man who got far with what he had, but at the same time he's had plenty of breaks including a rich father but who was never there for him, he blew 20 million in his house in newport beach california and is now in an apartment on jane street in downtown toronto, now begging for my dad to add minutes to his cell phone so he can phone his wife in chicago some more and talk to the kids he has that are younger than me.  he sends his entire pension fund to chicago to her n the kids, he has nothing, no money and relies on my dad, a stockbroker, and my uncle, an accountant, to pay for his way, and always demands more, my grandfather has never done anything in his life, never really worked hard, jsut stumbled on money, especially after my grandmother died before i was born, leaving him millions in a hairdressing fortune in toronto called JCA hairdressing.   My life's a weird one, im gunna post more and more about this as it goes on, what happens and all that crazy shit i call a life, till then the olympic road race is on.
