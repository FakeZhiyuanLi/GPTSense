        Hello Children.... I'm bored as hell today. I've done nothing. I walked to my friend Lisa's house last night and had a talk with her, haven't seen her in ages. This was just after I stormed out the house because my mum and her boyfriend Jimmy were being cocks. So anyway, that's all I've been up to really.   6 DAYS TILL I GO TO READING....  And get my GCSE results too. Uh oh.          Jack

        So, I told her. Thank god. She took it well, she's been acting the same with me since, and I'm really happy about that, it's just like normal. I'm so lucky to have her as a friend.  I went Leicester shopping yesterday for clothes for 6th Form...came back with one pair of trousers :( Paul, Gemma, Charlotte, Ruth and Gemma's sister Jessicca went.  I went home but then I went for a walk, and cried my eyes out, I've had a lot on my mind recently. So anyway, I rang Gemma and she came out and comforted me, which was good of her.         Jack

        Bugger.  Gemma just came to my door, accompanied by Sir Jerermy of Tosspot, and his townie twat of a mate Scott. So anyway, I was going to give her the letter, but I chickened out, I just looked at her and thought 'I can't risk losing her as a friend'. Fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck. I'm annoyed to hell now. I'll see her tomorrow though, so I'll give her it then hopefully. :(          Jack

        Boring boring boring day. It's 20:06 as I type, and I haven't spoke to Gemma today, and if I don't by midnight it would've been the first day in months that we haven't communicated with each other in some way :( Still, I've been writing her a letter explaining how I feel and I'm gonna give it to her tomorrow, unless I chicken out, which I probably will.    Other than that I've just had a normal Sunday, went to see the Bourne Supremecy at the cinema's, which was no way near as good as the Bourne Identity.    Gemma's friend Emma told her yesterday that she's moving away in a week or so to Bournemouth in a few months, so she's pretty upset, which is why she's not out with me today, cos she's spending the day with Emma. Emma's a lesbian by the way, not that it matters. Gemma's a bisexual, and experimental. They used to spend a lot of time together. You do the math ;)    Anyway, gotta go wallow in self-pity, Man Utd lost earlier :(

        Went to a family party with Gemma last night. Well, I was meant to a 7 o'clock, but we went to the chippy instead, and went back to my house and ate them, then we got drunk on Martini. We then went out into the park by my house and just sat on a bench till ten. There were several moments when we just kind of looked into each others eyes... it felt like we were going to kiss, but it never happened. I was luckily not drunk enough to not know what I was doing, so I didn't tell her or anything.  We got a taxi up to the party, and we were bought more drinks by family members, which made me a little bit more drunk. We just sat there with my sister Francesca, my friend Erin and my cousin Joe. It was fairly fun, and eventually we had to leave, so Gemma went off in her taxi and I got a sleepless night at home :(  She text me earlier to say she was spending the day with Jeremy, and I literally feel physically sick at the thought of them doing stuff. It's horrible. It's pathetic because I know it's never going to happen but I can't help it. I might write her a letter to explain how I feel.

      I'm knackered. This morning was the first time I'd seen 9am for months. I've had a lie in every day for the past 4 months. So anyway, I went out, bought Striker, came home, had a bath, then went out.... with guess who? Gemma and Paul. So anyway we just had a chat, which mostly involved me and Paul lecturing Gemma on Jeremy. He's hanging out with us on Monday, so I get to meet him formally for the first time. Ugh. I don't want to associate with people like that. Paul kept bringing up the fact that he's a bad guy, and Gemma said she just wants a bit of fun, so Paul said 'Bad guys always get nice girls, why don't you have a bit of 'fun' with me or Jack?'. D'oh. I wish.  Somehow we ended up talking about ears, and Gemma mentioned that she loves biting and licking earlobes softly..... okay, I thought, but she did it to me and .... well, it's orgasmic. Holy shit it's good. Screw sex, I'm just going to sit there biting and licking earlobes for the rest of my life. Seriously, it's fucking good.  Apart from that I haven't done much, me and Gemma are going to a party tomorrow night, so I'll no doubt update you on Saturday, so until then, bye bye :)       Jack

      I went out with Paul and Charlotte all day. It was okay, but it was weird for Gemma to not be out with us. She said she was 'At her grans with her mum'. I texted her later on to ask if she was coming out at all today, but she said she was 'with Emma'. Emma is her lesbian friend...but I'll probably write about that in a future entry. Anyway, eventually she rang, and she seemed really quiet... I asked her what was wrong and I knew something was wrong, but she said no, although it was reluctant. Then I heard a deep male voice. It was Jeremy. I asked her if it was, and she said yes, so I just said 'Gotta go, bye' and hung up. I then sent her a text saying 'If you were going out with Jeremy today you should've just said...instead of making excuses. It's your decision who you see'. She sent one back saying 'I know....it was wrong but I didn't want you two (me and paul) to have a go at me. I'll talk to you about it tomorrow. x.'. So I sent one back saying.... 'I wouldn't of had a go. I would've been disapointed but I wouldn't of had a go at you. At the end of the day it's your choice who you go out with, not mine and Paul's.'  Yesterday we did nothing but say how wrong he was for her, so we obviously pissed her off, but still, was there any need to lie about what she was doing. I'm really sad that she'd rather spend time with a druggie than me and Paul, who she claims to be best friends with.  :(      Jack

      I spent the whole day with Gemma and Paul today, which was great. Me and Paul were both constantly trying to make Gemma realise that Jeremy isn't right for her... She knows he isn't, but feels some sort of connection... and she's making excuses for him... I'm just so frustrated. He's not right for her, she's way too good for him. She's a beautiful, amazing girl, and he's a dirty druggy. I just can't believe how naive she's being...  She was on the phone to me last night crying about Daniels death... I was so glad that she felt the need to ring me over anyone else, but it was really upsetting hearing her get like that. I'm gutted about Daniel, he had his whole life to live for. :(  Tomorrow I'm going out with Gemma and Paul again... so I'll update you tomorrow.       Jack

      He was just 16 :( He went into hospital for a heart operation (he had a hole in his heart) and he caught and infection and died yesterday. I never really knew him that well, infact, the only time I spoke to him was when we had an arguement about whether Muse are a good band or not (which by the way, they are). But it's still horrible. I just got off the phone to my best friend Gemma, and she was in a bad state.... life's just a fucking piece of shit. My friend Rachel has had to go through her Grandad, her cousin and now her ex-boyfriend and best mate dying too. This fucking sucks. It just hasn't sunk in. He was really intelligent, and he could've done anything with his life, but it was snatched away.... I can't believe it :(     Jack

      So, y'know Gemma? Turns out her new boyfriend, Jeremy, is a pill popper :( She knew he did hash and smoked before, but he said he'd never do it around her, which I thought was okay, but yesterday he told her that he does cocaine and ecstasy. Gemma's completely anti-drugs, and she says that she's scared to be around him now, because she's afraid of the date-rape drug and stuff like that. She went to see him at 6 o'clock, so hopefully she's dumped him. :( I feel really low now, she thought she'd found a guy she really liked but now it doesn't seem that way.  I spent the rest of the day hanging out with Gemma, and my two other best friends Paul and Charlotte. Didn't get up to much, just chilled.     Jack

      Went to see I, Robot at the cinema today. It wasn't the best film I've ever seen, but it wasn't the worst either.  Some ignorant asshole brought a  BABY  into the film, and it was kicking and screaming the whole way through, so my dad complained and we got a refund. Result :p  I got a text from Gemma at the end of the film. She said she was with Jeremy (Her new boyfriend; kind of) and his mates, and she said she was having a shitty time, surrounded by stoners, so she text me for, and I quote 'some intelligent conversation'. I love that girl.  Other than that, I've not done much today, it's been cool though, just relaxing.  Oh yeah, I got my  READING Festival  tickets through the post yesterday, which I'm incredibly happy about, because I was scared they wouldn't come. This time in 3 weeks I'll be seeing Placebo, Bloc Party, Supergrass, Morrissey, White Stripes, Libertines, Ash, The Hives, Secret Machines, Graham Coxon, Razorlight, The Stills, 22/20's and Modest Mouse. YAY!     Jack

        I woke up at about 11.30am today, pretty late by my standards. I did nothing all morning as usual :p I didn't do anything all day, until I went to my Grans at 4pm. So basically, didn't do anything. Uneventful day. I've just been sitting here thinking of Gemma, wishing she'd come back. She's only away till Saturday, but I miss her so much. I'm counting down the hours until she comes back.  Jack.

        I went to my Uncle's funeral this morning. He was just 49, died from throat cancer. Not nice. I never really knew him, he was always living away, until the last two years of his life. It hit me really hard though, because my gran and grandad were both really affected by it. They seemed to have aged by 10 years in just the last 2. The service was really sad, but afterwards we all went to a pub and it was quite fun. I got served my first ever pint, which I'm pretty chuffed about. :p  I got home at about 2pm, and I went on the computer. I had a convo with my best friend Gemma. I've been in love (well, I don't know if it's love, but it seems like it) with her for over a year now, and it's frustrating the hell out of me.  She's going on holiday for a week, she's going early tomorrow morning, and I already miss her like crazy :( This really sucks, I just wish I could talk with her :(  Jack...
