      Hey Everyone!  I've just started this Blog.  Hopefully, I'll have more interesting things to say soon, but right now I am just feeling boring.

      What's going on?  A whole lot of nothing folks.  I thought that not having a job would be a decent amount of fun, but it is just plain old boring.  Went camping this past weekend.  The people at the site next to us played ghetto music from 8am until 7pm at which time, they played the entire Waiting To Exhale soundtrack followed by Luther Vandross's Greatest Hits.  One word: brutal.  But we made the best out of it by making a drinking game out of it.  Anytime we heard "baby" or some sort of moan or "hmmm" we had to drink.  All I can say is: we got loaded in no time at all.  Tonight I am gonig to a party in Chicago - BuckTown area.    I also have a very serious addicition to Dr. Phil.  I can't stop watching.  It's like a train wreck.  Someone needs to stop me.    I picked up golfing.  Something I can do with my father.  I am crappy at golf as he is, so we make a good pair.  He's happy so I'm happy.  Besides, there are a lot of cute guys on those greens.  The only thing I didn't expect were the blisters.

      Yesterday was my last day of work and some work friends took me out.  It was a late night, but it was a great night.  Who knew Tuesdays was Karaoke night.  I got up there and rocked the bar with a rendition of "Looking Out My Back Door" by CCR.  When the song finished I drunkenly announced to the entire bar that..."as of today, I have no job.  So, I am available for weddings and batmitzvahs."  I have never gotten so many strange looks in my life.  We didn't home until bar time.  So, I am dragging a little today.  I've decided that I'll start looking for a job tomorrow.  I needed just one day.    Inspiration?  The guy who tried to hit on me at the bar.  The stats: age 32   occupation: dogwalker.  Seriously.

      I just went into this huge rant and didn't save it.  Ah well, just par for the course.  Went Milwaukee this weekend and was in bed by 11:30 because I am an old quitter.  The decent people were at Summerfest and when that got rained out, they went home.  The rest headed to Water Street were we ended up.  Not by choice, mind you.  One of the girls in our group wanted to dance all "club style".  She wanted ghetto and I gave her Mels.  It was brutal.    Some guy came up to us and asked if we ever watch Sex and The City.  We answered yes.  His response? "Yeah, I kinda thought so.  Now I know what you guys are thinking."  What a bastard.  Was he trying to tell us we were too old to be there?  Did we look desperate?  Which one of us was Samantha?  Whatever, fuck him and fuck the horse he rode in on.      We left soon after that and ordered PIzza Shuttle - some of the best pizza ever created and went to bed.  Very old lady style.  Fuck us too.  Erin, if you get chance, I've found a great little show on the Oxygen Channel called "Good Girls Don't..."  It's wonderful.  Watch it.  Love it.  Make it your own.  I have my last day of work tomorrow.  Yeah for me.  Unemployment is hanging in the horizon.  What should I do next?  Bartend?  Hook?  What?

       I used to smoke back in college.  Actually is started in high school.  My best friend Michelle and I would take her Dads cigs and smoke them while we rode around in her jeep.  Good times.  By that was something I did to look cool.  College was a whole 'nother thing.    I didn't start again until my junior year and I took my job as a newfound smoker very seriously.  I started smoking P funks and switched to Marlboro Menthe Lights my senior year.    Smoking was great!  I smoked when I was bored, or when I was tired.  I had some of my best conversations over a smoky treat.  My college roommate, Jess and I bonded over cancer stick.  Jess was a non-smoker, but on occasion she would pony up and have one with me.  That's just the kind of friend she was.  The best was 'the walk'.  Say you had to be on the other side of campus and it was cold and rainy.  I could have very easily talked my self out of attending class for that reason alone.  But I'd eventually make it.  Why?  Cause you could smoke almost an entire 100 in the time it took to leave my apartment to get to the science library.  Vawalla!  There you have it folks.  When I graduated I worked on The Hill and we used to smoke in the Congressman's office.  That was fun, but my suits would stink and so I stopped and it was then that I became the non-smoking smoker.  Because, seriously, who could afford that kinda dry cleaning bill?  The non-smoking smoker is that person who really doesn't have an addition.  The one who smokes when they are in the company of a full-time smoker or at a bar, but otherwise doesn't need the fix.  The non-smoking smoker doesn't smoke in their car and they sit in the non-smoking section in a restaurant.  That used to be me.  Until I quite my job.  Now I am a full-time smoker and I hate it.  I got hooked in 2 weeks.  I smoke in my car.  I smoke for breakfast!  I haven't done that since college.  It's a damn shame.  Really it is.  Now I am a smelly girl.  Gross.  I should be ashamed of myself.    I spent yesterday at the beach with Nat and she insisted that I not smoke -- cause she is a good friend who cares about my 27 year old lungs.  But tonight we head to BrewTown for her bachelorette party and I know I will smoke way too much.  It's becoming that nervous habit you hear so much about.  I don't like it.  Let's see if I can stop.
