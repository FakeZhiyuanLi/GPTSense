      You entered into my life when I least expected it. I thought of giving up hope, But you were there to help me cope.  You pulled me through the good times and the bad. I feel no need to be sad. You're here and it makes me glad.  I now know the meaning of love and it soars like two white doves.  I too, will be here for you. My feelings are as true as the skies are blue.

      Me and him had a real good relationship. Since we met we got along well. When people were around he wasn't boyfriend material, but when we were alone he was very sweet. It's like he didn't want anyone to know that he could be a good boyfriend or that he felt something for me. We had a lot in common. We liked a lot of the same things.   At the beginning everything was going fine, it was as if I was dreaming. Unfortunately I woke up. He started to act weird, he tried to control me and tell me what I should and shouldn't do. He was a jealous guy and if he knew a guy liked me he would tell me I couldn't speak to him again. Of course I didn't listen to him and I continued to talk to them. He got mad at me and tried to ignore me. So, one day after things were calmer I told him that maybe 'we' weren't working anymore, and he said that it might be that we didn't spend enough time together.   The reason we broke up was because I couldn't deal with he's attitude and I couldn't help getting hurt every time he ignored me. And that was it.

      i can't explain my feelings for you  it's just too much to say,  but all i do is think of you day after day...                    you don't understand how much i wish  that you could be just mine,  and maybe it will happen  it might just take some time...                    i don't know how or why  my feelings are so very strong  but i do know that  in my arms is where you belong...                    i know i've only known you  for just a little while  but ever since i met you,  i can only think of your beautiful smile...                    i wish you would look me in my eyes  and say you want me, too  but until then- i just want you to know  i will wait for you

      I thank God he sent you to me,   For you and I were meant to be. We have a bond too strong to break,   We have a love no one can take.  In you, I have found a love so true,   My heart is filled with love for you. Well... Every time I look at you, my heart would skip a beat or two ,   You make my life so whole with glow, you make my life complete with gold.  My love for you grows more with each passing day,   The thought of your gorgeous face takes my breath away: Those brown eyes fill my soul with happiness,   Those luscious lips I love to kiss.  The day when I become your wife,   Will be the happiest day of my life. Even thinking of that day makes me smile,   I can't wait 'till I walk down that aisle.  I dream of that day when we'll both say, "I do"   For always and forever... I will love you.   with love to melvin,                    Fion

      The four-letter word everyone longs to hear To have that special someone whisper it in your ear We wait our whole lives for the real thing Many times mistaking what was only a fling  When you find that someone, you'll know it's real Because in your heart, it will be love you feel When you look in their eyes and feel your heart beating You'll know it's the love that is never fleeting  Unselfishly you give your heart... Hoping and praying it will not be torn apart If ever this love proves not to be true He'll leave with something belonging to you A part of your heart forever he'll take You will get over this, for your own sake  After all, you must still go on  For it is not your whole heart that is gone Many believe in love at first sight If you find that someone, hold on tight  Work on the relationship to make it grow And in time you will know If this is the love, you've waited your life for You will never want or need... anything more

      All of my life,  I have longed for someone like you,  So warm and tender,  with a love so true.     You light up my life with each passing day,  Now that I have found you,  I will never let you get away.     The beauty of your smile, and  the warmth of your heart.  The great inner beauty you possess,  is what won me over,  and did from the very start.    As I sit here and think of you,  the memories of how we met  are ever so strong.  You came into my life  at a time I felt so alone.     All of my life I've longed  for someone who would love me,  for whom I am and nothing more.  You captured my mind and soul,  so you, my love, you are the key  to my heart's door.     Each day we are together,  is another day in paradise.  Knowing I've finally  found someone to love me,  surely does feel so nice.     No more lonely days and nights,  for they are gone forever, never to come again.  Since you came into my life,  I have so much love to  give to you from within.     The birds are flying high in the sky,  singing melodies of love found for you and I.  My body, soul and mind  are yours until the day I shall die.     And even after then...  the memory of love we have for each other  will speak to us for all eternity.  And another page of love  will be written in history.    As days go by let's you and I  keep this love we have between us alive.  As the hair on our heads grows gray,  we will look back at these precious memories of love  with a smile.    There will be no one who  can take this love away from us.  Because in God and each other,  we will forever put our trust.     All of my life I have dreamed  of a love so true and pure,  like yours.  Now that I have found you,  throughout all eternity this  love of ours will always endure.     I know we both are human  and are prone to make mistakes.  All of our mistakes, we will work through,  for true love is our fate.     This day I pledge my love to you for always...  for better or for worse, until death do us part.  Our hearts will blend into one heart.  You and I will always be  the reality that dreams do come true.   All of my life I have dreamed of you,  Now my soul is at peace forever.  For you are here finally.

      I can’t cope any longer, The pain I hide inside, To my friends I have lied.  I told them I was fine, When I really felt defeated, The pain is too much, I want to be needed.  No one wants me, It’s the truth, I know, No one needs me, I should just go.  The knife, it whispers to me, "Do it, end it all!" I know I won’t be missed, Just let me fall.  The uncontrollable pain, Makes tears stream down my face, I’m sitting in the corner, Like a delicate piece of lace.  You make me suffer, Day after day, You’ll never love me- That’s what you say.  I hide the pain, With smiles and laughter, I put on an act, Because I have to...   i had done tis poem when i finish e below post so feeling abit down.. dun worry abt me and i'll be fine *winkz*

      When the bus come, you look at it and  you said  to yourself, "eeee... so full...cannot sit down  one"....... So you said to yourself, "I'll wait  for the next one." so you let the bus go and  waited for the second bus.   Then the second bus came, you looked at it and  you said, "eeee.........this bus so old...surely  very uncomfortable one." So you let the bus go  and decided to wait for the next bus.   After a while, another bus came. It's not  crowded and not old but you said, "eeee... no  air-con one...and the weather is so warm, better  wait for the next one." So again you let the bus  go and decided to wait for the next bus.   Then the sky started to get dark as it is  getting late.   You panicked and jump on to the next on coming  bus. It is not until much later that you found  out that you had boarded on to the wrong bus! So  you wasted your time and money waiting for what  you want!   Even if an aircon bus came, can you ensure that  the aircon bus won't break down or will the  aircon be too cold for you?   So people...(mostly girls but guys too!) want to  make sure that what you want is not wrong. But  it wouldn't hurt to give other people a chance,  right? If you found that the "bus" doesn't  suit, you just press the red button and get off  the bus!   But wait...I am sure all of you have this  experienced before. You saw a bus is coming (the  bus you want of course) you flagged it and the  driver acted blur by pretending not seeing you  and zoomed pass you!   The bottom line of being loved is like waiting  for a bus and whether you want to get on the bus  and give the bus a chance depends totally on you  and walking alone is just like being out of love.    Remember to always say what you mean.  If you love someone, tell. Don't be afraid to  express yourself.   Reach out and tell someone what they mean to  you. Because when you decide that it is the  right time, it might be too late.   Seize the day.   Never have regrets.   And most importantly, stay close to your friends  and family, for they have helped make you the  person that you are today.   The difference between doing all that you can or  having regrets which may stay with you forever.   Friendship is never an accident. It is always  the result of high intentions, sincere effort,  intelligent direction and skillful execution. It  represents the wise choice of many alternatives.   And remember.... Keep Smiling....coz... "Of All  Things You Wear, Your Smile Is As love returns  to me, As I return to you, As love returns to  us.   I guess this is really wondeful and make a lot  of sense.

      my life is starting to get boring.. although i gt alot of fren who share e same interest as me and a angel who is alway by my side lo.. they r very nice to me but i can't help thinking abt e life i m having.. maybe cos i m grounded too long le..   I always wonder why Do I get so lonely day after day,  Sometimes I even wonder  If I exist.  The only one that ever cared for me  Has been taken away from me. Sometimes I feel so lonely  I just want to break down and cry.  Sometimes I need someone  To talk to, to laugh with,  To share my dreams and emotions with,  But there's nobody there for me.  Sometimes I sit all alone in the dark wondering if I'm always going to be so lonely I have worked so hard to change my life But it seems my loneliness is here to stay

      okay.. let start.. me wake up early in e morning at 5 plus yest cos of e stupid rain, thunder and lightning.. then lie on e bed until 6 plus and wake up to bath, blow dry my hair and change into my clothes.. then, melvin call.. he's coming.. then i pack my bag ready... then he call again saying he reach le... so i went down and he drove a white mercedes.. not too bad... but hs driving is abit too rocky la... not too much stable lo.. hahax.. but not too bad la..  hmm.. anyway reach his hs.. saw his father.. look quite strict.. his dad is quite particular over alot of things.. saw his mum.. i like his mum alot.. she gt a nice character.. and one thing i like abt his hs is his room.. i like his room alot cos when i open e window i can see e mrt station clearly and e bright sun shine which make e room nice and cosy..  then i went to e supermarket w him lehz... first time i went to buy grocery w other ppl except my parent and sis.. and his phone start to ring from e time we started shopping.. not tat i mind.. cos i noe it hs lifestyle and i hav to accept it le..  then we went back to his hs and gt all the ingrediet ready..  we r meeting nic but his is damn late and like to make unecessary assumption which is one bad thing abt him.. while meeting for nic, thing started get kinki and ............. hahax... he is a very shy boi u noe?? ke ai de lehz.. alway wanted to use e pillow or e blanket to cover his face..  then met nic and we went to suntec to register.. then go bugis find serena and go back to heeren again to look for shoes which melvin need for his hosting.. hmm.. then pei him go for his classes at guiding stars.. he is practising singing w another gal.. and i learn guitar from nic.. then i went home without sending me home.. (humph~!!)  gt stuck and went to my grand ma hs.. (stupid~!)  a poem for my dearest melvin,  If I knew it would be the last time  I'd see you fall asleep, I would tuck  you in more tightly and pray the Lord  your soul to keep.   If I knew it would be the last time  I'd see you walk out the door I would hug you and kiss you and call you  back for one more.   If I knew it would be the last time  I heard your name lifted up in praise I would video tape each action and word  so I could play it back for days.   If I knew it would be the last time to  spare an extra minute or two with you  I'd stop and say, "I love you"  Instead of assuming that you know I do.   If I knew it would be the last time  I would be there to share your day...  well, I'm sure you'll have many more,  So, I'll let this one slip away.   For surely there is tomorrow  to make up for an oversight  and we'll always get a second chance  to make everything alright.   There will be another chance  to say our I love you's  and certainly there's another chance  to say our anything I can do's.   But just in case I might be wrong  and today is all I get I'd like to say how much I love you  and hope we never forget.   Tomorrow is not promised to anyone  young or old alike  and today might be your last chance  to hold  your loved one tight.   So if you're waiting for tomorrow  why not do it all today?  For if tomorrow never comes  you will surely regret the day   you didn't take the extra time  for a smile, or hug, or kiss  and you were too busy to grant someone  what turned out to be their last wish.   So hold your loved ones close today  and whisper in their ear  Telling them how much you love them  and that you'll always hold them dear.   Take the time to say, "I'm sorry"  "Please forgive me," "Thank you, or, It's okay"  And if tomorrow never comes  you'll have no regrets about today.

      When you find someone you love  It's so hard to tell them how you feel  But even harder to explain it's real  It hurts so much to hear that person say,  "You're wrong to feel this way."   What can I do, what can I say  To make you understand  How I feel about you each and every day  Is it that my heart skips a beat  Every time you pass   Or how the walls around my heart  Came down with just a glance  I toss and turn all night in bed  Thoughts of you running through my head   I don't know what to say to prove it's real  Words can't express the love I feel  Just hold my hand and look into my eyes   If you see tears falling to the floor  Then you will know it's true  I do in fact, love you

      Love is a strength and courage that hides the flaws. Love is a dupe that deceives and tortures.  The sight of the crowd with huge numbered opposite sex was beyond imagination. The sudden despite overwhelmed. Someone robbed off the memory.  It's nobody's business but tell me how I should feel. Is it love or illusion? I wonder if I've been hypnotized.  Enlighten me I'm wrong all these while.  Where's the urge? Has it peeled off? Or has it been washed away by the laughters in the jealousy heaven?  Yes, I hope so.

      &nbsp; 那一份着急究竟是幻觉或是爱情的压力？  明明是关心，却要忍着。我远远望了她的挣扎，在那一瞬间心中沉重悲哀。  如果是半年前，我不需装聋作哑。但是现实就是不容纳如果。在无奈中，我只能怒火。  明明是忘记了，我却忘不了伤心。
