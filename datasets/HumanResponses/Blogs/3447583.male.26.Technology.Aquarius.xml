						   A response to the article written by Meera Nanda in the hindu on 22nd May. Refer URL : http://www.hindu.com/2004/05/22/stories/2004052201691000.htm Please find that article pasted as the first comment below.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------  In the Article “Calling India’s freethinkers” dated May 22, Meera Nanda’s point of “commitment to much thrashed scientific temper” is well received. There is indeed a need for the government to just govern instead of being a thought police. But I strongly disagree with the approach she proposes for attaining this objective and differ with her views on Indian spirituality and Hinduism.   To ensure that people are receptive to any idea one should understand their psyche. People should not ignore the entire argument by considering it as a mere intellectual gymnastic.   She proposes “In the case of Hinduism, secularization must involve a critical engagement with those aspects of Hindu sacred teachings that make empirical claims regarding the presence of a disembodied spiritual element in nature “seen” in the minds eye for the mystics and the yogi’s”.     The pre-requisite for a scientific attitude is an open mind which means a mind free of presumptions and the curiosity to explore the unexplored.The lack of emperical evidence does not mean the evidence of the lack.           Such a solution would never work.Such engagement with people’s beliefs will evoke fury and make the targeted audience defensive and thus apprehensive about your intentions, however noble they may be and in fact will lead to disastrous repercussions on two grounds.   First, It will increase the divide between those who believe in a faith and those don’t. Meera Nanda apparently doesn’t believe in the “minds eye” or in kundalini yoga. How then does she to hope to establish a channel of communication with those thousands or lakhs of Indians who meditate ceaselessly on the “minds eye” and practice yoga everyday? The message of secularism must percolate to the masses. How does she assume that they wont discard her arguments and understanding of Indian scriptures and Hindu philosophy as unacceptable and baseless?     According to her “Hindu gurus and god men stake claim to extra ordinary and extra constitutional powers by invoking gods commandments or by reading sacred books.” And she appeals the secularists to offer an honest way to reconcile Hinduism with modern science.  The intellectual Hindus will argue that this apparent mis-understanding and the misrepresentation thereof of the message propagated by the realized masters itself is an explanation of why it doesn’t appeal to the intellectuals who haven’t made enough attempts to understand the significance of India’s spiritual heritage. The hindus will argue that science should be looked upon as work in process and not as absolute truth. That there are subtler laws that rule the hidden spiritual planes and the inner realm of consciousness. That these principles are knowable though the science of yoga. And they will provide proofs of mystical phenomenon demonstrated by the realized masters time and again amidst the various scientist and doctors.   Such discussion will not help us bridge the gap. The need is to bring about a consensus on this concept of secularism in governance and in administration. Let people believe and follow their faiths. Let us not make the mistake what the politicians are already doing. Being a thought police.        Secondly, such attempt will give rise to creation of yet another political party, a group of fundamentalist, intolerant brutes who will shout loud and provoke the common man to support them in saving their religion from intruders. Lets us learn from the history. The strength of such political parties is the approval from the common man. The only way to enfeeble them is to withdraw this support. For it we have to attack the root cause of this problem. How?      Meera Nanda's calls upon the scientists, writers, intellectuals, and the liberal, forward-looking clergy of all faiths to join the battle for a deeper secularization of the Indian society. And I doubt if this call would have had any appeal amongst the intellectuals of this country. The reasons are understandable.   The greatest of the scientists, sports men, philosophers, mathematicians, doctors and academicians that our country has produced have been deeply religious or spiritual. Wasn’t Ramanujan deeply religious? Weren’t Aryabhaat and Chanakya rational and scientific enough?  Wasn’t S. Radhakrishnan religious and scientific? Were the academicians of the ancient nalanda university not religious? Scientific temperament Religion and spirituality can and has coexisted seamlessly in India. We must realize that religion, spirituality and scientific temperament are not mutually exclusive components in the fabric of Indian society. They are tightly intermingled threads that define and unify this diverse nation.  The problem is neither with religion nor with Indian spirituality. Indian spirituality has percolated the western world deeply. So deeply that that have begin to teach the same philosophy to us now. Its presence doesn’t bother them not does it create any problem in their politic. In fact they are reserching the effects of faith in god on medical healing. Indian scriptures are all about universal love, goodness, being kind and using your power of discrimination at all times. The problem is the anarchy and confusion caused by the dogmatic opinions supplanted in the philosophy by the intolerant selfish pedants few hundred years ago and which are still being preserved rigidly by these myopic obscurants, the VHP and Bajarang dals for their own vested interests. Its impact on the Indian society has been so grave that its virtually impossible to cast off that veil of misunderstanding unless these fundamentalists are prevented from propagating and carefully nourishing their nefarious intentions. This has happened in all the religions. Reacting to the chaos and maligning the religions is no solution. We need to seperate the wheat from the chaf.          Why is that the uneducated poor is the victim in the riots and not the educated class. The educated intellectuals of this great nation realize that there is an essential unity in all the religions; that there is no difference in the faiths expounded by the various faiths and that there is but one goal admitted by all the scripture. Of love, tolerance, selfless work, devotion and universal brotherhood & self realization.   This is the only message we need to explain to the masses again and again through various channels and in detail by systematically comparing the scriptures of various faiths. It has already been done, but not advertized properly.  Unless the masses decide not to get aggravated by the provocative rhetoric of these mean politicians & deceitful sadhus there is no way to counteract their attempt at leveraging political advantage and safforonising the politic.   Convey they the message :    "Love does not delight in evil,but rejoices with truth. It always protects,always trusts,always hopes and always preserves"        Corinthians XIII 6-7     and tell them what krishna said :    ahankaram balam darpam kamam krodham ca samsritah mamatmaparadehesu pradivisanto' bhayasuyakah     (Gita : XVI:18)      "Given over to egotism, brute force,arrogance,lust and anger,those malicious people hate Me,while dwelling in their own bodies as well as in the bodies of others"    If this is the only topic that appeals to the masses then why not take help of it.This is the only message on religion to which one hundred crore people of this country will be respond to.You need snakes venom to cure snakebite. We require the help of the unfathomable goodness of the scriptures of all religions to clean this induced dirt. We need the help of spirituality and religion to make India peaceful and secular.

						   Reuters. Washington bureau.   From our special correspondant vardhan kale in Hyderabad.    The software industry has invented the next generations of frustration busting technology, which not only helps us live in complete harmony with nature but also helps the industry serve their customes better.  “We have found the next generations of frustration busting technology, which not only helps us live in complete harmony with nature but also serves our customers and helps us fulfill our mission statement of a “customer centric approach for a social and environmental cause”.  Says Mr Ghochu, CEO of Ghochus.com   Mr Ghochu also claims that the developing countries are an emerging market for this next generation of technology. The developed countries have already adopted it long back and we expect the market to grow in developing nations like India, in which the outsourcing business is flourishing. Mr Ghochu says. “There are early adopters and the signs are encouraging.” Says one of the implimentaing parteners of Ghadheys & Ghadheys.    The customers love it too. One of the IT pro Niranjan Daroopeeke says : “The correct question is what happens when you don’t get humans to interact with?. Now I no longer have to bang my head on my wodden desk. There is no need to replace damaged wood in the office resulting in reduced costs, improved bottomline and better valuations of our products to the customers.”    Our special correspondant also observed the lateral thinking this new technology fosters.One of the employee in the IT industry asked him : “I have an Intel inside and I share my feelings with her, what about you?”  The pre-requisites of this technology are minimal interaction with humans. The more you interact with them the more inutile it gets. But considering the surge in the next wave of information technology the chances of its getting inutile are remote.

						   The Americans and Britons seem to write and read a lot.  What puzzles me when I visit these bookshops is the number of  #1 international bestseller's at display. How could there be multiple books at the #1 slot?  And before I expose the obfuscated philosophy of writing  #1 bestseller's let me tell you one thing. This article is based on my wild imaginations and by categorically stating this; I hereby absolve myself from all the legal implications that you may beget by misinterpreting and misrepresenting it thereof.  ...and yes dont take my buffoonery seriously. :-)  So how do you write a #1 international bestseller?  You don&#8217;t have to have that maneuverability in your style of writing. Writing in prose can do. The mass, people like me, who you should target, would anyway not appreciate your phraseology. Don&#8217;t target those book reviewers or intellectuals. One way is to strike a deal with them to share revenue based on the quality of their reveiews. Impressions matter. Its ok if you don&#8217;t earn from your first book. Once your brandname is established, people like me will will buy your books and after completing reading it and feeling proud about having read it (at least having completed yet another book in their lives) they&#8217;ll invariably rattle about its contents to their friends.   Concentrate on the content, but don&#8217;t worry about the quality of it too much. The more varied it is the better for your readers to converse on the newly discovered information. Don&#8217;t go deep. Don&#8217;t make them work hard. Serve everything on the platter. Understand their psyche pal. They need something to talk about; to show that they know and to prove that they are not hollow within. That they are more than X kgs of emotions and flesh. So concentrate on the content from this perspective.   If it&#8217;s not good they&#8217;ll talk about how bad it is. Anything will do. But something has to be there. Most of them don&#8217;t watch their thoughts and don&#8217;t care about the quality of what enters within. They are congenitally predisposed to ingest any and every thought that&#8217;s predominant of that era. Remember this, and remember that they are unable to conceptualize something out of the box.    A little mental stimulus is a human need. But offering too much of it is a recipe for disaster.It should do good enough to their ego&#8217;s by making them feel that they are intellectually more evolved after having read yet another book. But don&#8217;t go deep. Don't try be a historian. They just need an assurance that you have gone deep enought form them to be able to quote your work during their evening get togethers. Don&#8217;t expose your acemadic interest. Remember your objective, to be a #1 international bestseller.     This is a big world my dear friend.Some will read you for they have the habit of reading and a curiosity to explore and know others.Some will read because they have fought with their husbands, some will read because they are depressed and some will read because they want to do something more worthwhile in their life that reading newspapers and watching TV. Some will read to increase their reading speed and some will read because the feel that they should read more.   Your books should satisfy all of them, at least to a certain extent. People want something to do. At at the end of the day they&#8217;ll want feeling of accomplishment. Something that gives them Joy. They are all the same and strive for the same objective, joy; eternal Joy. And these humans have devised innumerable ways to find that joy. One of them is competing with each other and striving hard to prove in some or the other way that, their choices, their habits, inclinations are superior to others. The intensity of this desire varies in individuals. So you need to figure out how to relate with most of them. Remember your objective, to be a #1 international bestseller.     Give them what they want. And don&#8217;t you live under the illusion that it should be something out of this world. And if you have come till this point you know what i'am saying is right. People are interested in nonsence. They love wasting time.But dont get offended. Your objctive is important.Writing a #1 international bestseller. Don't get distracted.     Then the question arises, what should you do to write a #1 international besseller ?   ...More in part 2... :-)  till then take good care of yourself !

						   Excerpt from the second volume of  "The complete works of Sawmi Vivekananda"  "In various upnishads we find that this vedanta philosophy is not the outcome of meditation in the forest only, but that the very best pearls of it were thought out by brains which were busiest in the everyday affairs of life.   Bhagwat Gita - most of you perhaps have read it, it is the best commentry we have on the vedanta philosophy.Gita is intense activity, but in the midst of it. eternal calmness.  Inactivity dosent become activity when its combined with passion. Real activity ,which is the goal of vedanta is combined with eternal calmness, the calmness which cannot be ruffeled,the balance of mind which is never disturbed,whatever happens. And we know from our experience in life that that is the best attitude for work.   The less passion there is the better we work. The calmer we are,the better for us , and the more the amount of work we can do. When we let loose our feelings, we waste so much  energy,shatter our nerves, disturb our mind and accomplish very little work. The energy which out to have gone out as work is spent as mere feeling, which counts for nothing. It is only when the mind is very calm and collected that the whole of its energy is spent in doing good work.   And if you read the lives of great workers which the world has produced, you will find that they were wonderfully calm men. Nothing, as it were, could throw them off their balance. That is why the man who becomes angry never does a great amount of work, and the man whom nothing can make angry accomplishes so much. The man who gives way to anger,or hatred or any other passion, cannot work; he only breaks himself into pieces, and does nothing practical.   It is the calm , forgiving , equable well-balanced mind that does the greatest amount of work."

						   The incidents picturized in the movie passion of Christ were indeed brutal, barbaric & inhumane. Something unimaginable has been picturized yet again, and this time it was impossible to bear it.We just saw the first half.   What struck me most about the movie apart from the violence was its intent. Yet again an attempt has been made to highlight an incident and glorify a person instead of the focusing on the message. And that&#8217;s understandable. How could the message be conveyed in two hours when two thousand and four years haven&#8217;t been enough?  Judas betrays his masters by revealing his location to the priests. When the soldiers come to arrest the master, Christ tells Judas &#8220;You have betrayed the son of man&#8221;. Now that sentence attracted my attention.    Jesus does not say, &#8220;You have betrayed Me&#8221; instead he used &#8220;son of man&#8221; and that&#8217;s important. Masters like Jesus don&#8217;t identify themselves by their physical bodies. For them &#8220;Me&#8221; is the soul, the omnipresent spirit and not the gross body or the mind. For them everything is one, themselves, presenting itself in its different manifestations. And since good & bad are part of that omnipresent spirit itself it would have been meaningless for him to say &#8220;you have betrayed Me&#8221;. There is no way of betraying him, for he is the good and he is the bad. He is the doer and he is the sufferer. So who betrays whom?   Isn&#8217;t that the advaita philosophy? One hundred and ten years ago, in 1894 a realized master, Yogawatar Swami Yukteshwar giri had systematically illustrated how there is absolutely no difference in the message conveyed by Jesus and what is conveyed through the Indian scriptures. Though Jesus conveyed the message, few were prepared to understand the hidden meaning in that era. One needs the help of a realized master to understand the meaning conveyed in terms of allegory.    So how does the &#8220;Son of man&#8221; any different?   &#8220;Son of man&#8221; is the Ego. From one of the Sanskrit verses explained by swami Yukteshwar:  Chitsakashadanormahatwam tacchitwam, tatrasadhyavasayaha Satwam bhudhihi tatastadwiparitam manah charamayabhimanoahankarastadeva jeevaha   &#8220;The Atom under the influence of Chit (universal knowledge) forms the calm state of mind, which when spiritualized is called bhuddhi, intelligence. Its opposite is Manas, Mind, in which lives the Jiva: the self with Ahamkara,Ego, the idea of separate existance&#8221;            He explains further: &#8220;Chitta, the Heart; Ahamkara, Ego, the son of man. This Atom, Awidya, the Ignorance, being under the influence of Universal Love, Chit, the Holy Spirit becomes spiritualized, like iron filling in a magnetic aura, and possessed of consciousness, the power of feeling, when it is called Mahat, the Heart, Chitta; and being such, the idea of separate existence appears in it, which is called Ahamkara, Ego, the son of man.                     Sri yukteshwar also speaks about the another incident which has been depicted in the movie.  &#8220;All creation is governed by law. The principles that operate in the outer universe discoverable by scientists are called natural laws. But there are subtler laws that rule the hidden spiritual planes and the inner realm of consciousness; these principles are knowable through the science of yoga. It is not the physicst but the self realized master who comprehends the true nature of matter. By such knowledge Christ was able to restore a servant&#8217;s ear after it had been severed by one of the deciples&#8221;.     what is the true nature of matter ?...and more ...coming soon...in part 2!. Till then,take good care of yourself !

						   From the complete works of Swami Vivekananda  We are all beggers. Whatever we do we want a return. We are all traders. We are all traders in life,we are traders in virtue,we are traders in religion , and alas! we are also traders in Love.  ....  We get caught. How ? Not by what we give, but what we expect. We get misery in return for our love ; not from the fact that we love, but from the fact that we want love in return.  There is no mysery when there is no want.Desire , want is the father of all mysery.  Desires are bound by the laws of success and failures.Desires must bring mysery.  The great secret of true secret, of true happiness, then is this. The man who asks for no returns, the perfectly unselfish man , he is the most successful.  Ask nothing ; want nothing in return. Give what you have to give ; it will come back to you, but do not think of it now, it will come back multiplied a thousandfold.But the attention must not be on that.Yet have the power to give ; give and there it ends. Learn that the whole of life is giving, that nature will force you to give, so give willingly.Sooner or later you'll have to give up.You come into life to accumulate, with clinched hands you want to take.   You are a machine for talking and giving : you take in order to give. Ask, therefore, nothing in return ; but the more you give the more will come to you.  The quicker you can empty the air out of this room, the quicker it will be filled with  external air; and if you close all the doors and apertures, that which is within will remain but that which is outside will never come in, and which is within will stagnate , degenerate and become poison.   Be therefore not a begger; be unattached !
