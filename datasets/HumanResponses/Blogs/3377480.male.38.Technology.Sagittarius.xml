He went from west texas to santa fe new mexcico last weekend, to one of my sisters college graduations, his transmision in his 50k denale got sick and died, he had to rent a car to get home, local gm dealership "fixs' transmision, he drive the 7 hours back there today, get car, gets 4 hours away and stops to check, and fluid in trany is low, takes to local dealership they freak, say that the gm dealership didnt fix what was truly wrong, but tell him to stop and put fluid in every hour or so and he can make it home.  at that points is when i talk to him.  He is pissed.  wellll it just got worse for him  he calls me at the house a hour half later, and i cant hardly hear him for some god awful racket.  he is driving in a fricken hail storm!  In his beloved Denale, that fng GM did not fix correctly anyway, and he is now in the middle of bumb fricken new mexico that is flater than a driveway with no place to hide!  with a truck that is still fd up!  I made myself another drink and drank it for him!

       urlLink    Unibomber poker kid.&nbsp; urlLink     First things first.       The weather has been rainy all week, but today on the way home the sun came out.  We have a chance of thunderstorms the next few days.  It they miss us the ground will be dry enough to work this weekend.  I am hoping for the best!       The son, daughter, wife and I are playing a family texas hold em "poker tour" at the house.  Son and daughter came up with the rules.  My son takes his games very serious.  That is him, trying to hide himself so we wont be able to "read" his expressions and figure out what he has.      The daughter, the first night, bluffed a huge pot out of me and the son "the profesional" players.  She had nothing, but played the giggly "I got a pair of aces"  and we fell for it.  She didnt win the tourny but that one hand made her night!  Its the little things that make your day more often than not!  (holly cow, hearsedrv the philosipher?)      Me and the wife went on a double date last night with her brother and his wife.  My kids baby sat his 15month old.  We have not been on a date in ages.  I am a grouchy old fart that hates people and hates eating out, that is why its been years!     Met at bro-in-laws house after work, went to dinner. Now I hate restraunts.   Last night our waiter is "Todd".  some young punk, earings in both ears, half a brain, happy how the hell are you buttwipe.  I hate that crap.  This guy wasnt too bad, but most I cant stand.  "HI, MY NAME IS STUPID, HAPPY, DUMB, GOOD LOOKING, YOUNG, BITCH, AND I WILL BE TRYING TO MESS UP THE WHOLE MEAL FOR YOU TONIGHT, AND I EXPECT TO GET A 20% TIP WHEN I AM DONE!"   I waited tables and never acted as bad as they do.  To me a waiter should never be seen or thought of.  A good meal is when you dont know for sure if your waiter is a guy or girl.  The best restraunt I ever took my wife too, the waitress/waiter?  was awesome.  She or he took our order, brought the right drinks and brought the food.  thats all, and damit that is all I want.  If I wanted some young female to flirt with me I would be at a topless bar, hell!  Just bring the food and drinks and stay away from me.  Leave your "flair" in the toilet were it belongs!     Now "todd" did mess up in the worse way though.       My drink.     I drink bourbon and coke.  I love the taste of bourbon mixed with coca-cola.  Not pepsi,not Dr. Pepper, but coca-cola.       BUT, NOTICE I SAID BOURBON?  FOR THOSE THAT DONT DRINK OR DONT WAIT TABLES.  BOURBON IS MADE ONLY A CERTAIN WAY AND ONLY IN KENTUCKY.  NO WERE ELSE.   JACK DANIELS IS NO BOURBON  JACK IS A WHISKEY.  HUGE DIFFRENCE.     Well stupid, who I have been calling "todd" brought me a "jack and coke"  when I sent that crap back, he asked what was wrong.  I asked "what is that?"  he said Jack and coke like you asked for, "no I asked for Bourbon and coke"....."ohhh well its the same thing"   Susie were is my 2 x 4?       http://www.straightbourbon.com/  That link above,  all waiters and waitress's should read.  Its in english.  Learn it, live , be it! Other than stupid not knowing crap about his job, it was a really good dinner.  I didnt say bad things to the waiter, and enjoyed the company.  The meal was ok, nothing like my wife cooks but slumming once in awhile is ok.   BUT IT GETS BETTER!   We goto a 8:10 movie.  The stepford wifes.  Now the movie was ok. nothing bad nothing great, I enjoyed it, sitting next to my hottie!  but the fun part is, we go in, and just after they take our tickets, they have a ropped off area.  Little sighns, "line for 12:01am showing of spiderman 2 is here.  and damned if 4 hours before midnight there are uhhh there are, well there are, ohhh hell,  there are some freaking geeks sitting down, waiting for the midnight showing of the premier of spiderman2. Not kids mind you, but people over the age of 16. And it gets worse. There is a guy, probably 18? 17?  and he has a spiderman uniform on!! I kid you not!  He is wearing a spiderman outfit, sitting in a roped off area, in a major metorpolitian area, waiting for the premier of spiderman2!  Made me wish I had my spiderman undroos on!  Me and bro in law got a great laugh out of it! He is a police in that city and does security at that theatre, and he said "you should have seen the re-release of star wars!, all guys my age, waiting hours dressed up like star wars characters!" dont ever call me a geek again!  I may know alot about computers but Im no GEEK dont put me in the same cat as them freaks!  Well, I am hoping that I can get alot done this long weekend on the pool.  May the rain gods move to west texas were its needed!

      Soooo One of my sisters wrote a little blog about the pc help desk guy she had to work with other night. Now her point I believe was that she couldn't understand the language the guy was using, he was talking "geek" talk, but by end she was thinking she could talk "geek" She was not bad mouthing him, but me being the type of guy I am, slammed her for calling the guy a geek, or rather talking in geek etc.  And of course I threw in my 2 cents on what I think of DR's. Now mind you, I was just at the DR a few weeks ago when I hurt my back, but hey I can still say there all a bunch of idiots cant I? Anyway, someone else commented after I did. Now I thought he said about what I did.  However, my writing style is such, that its hard to take me or think that I'm serious.  This other one was, lets say you could tell I didn't write it.  She kind of got upset about it and pulled her blog down for a few day, but lucky she is a girl and got over it and put it back up.  (not only is she a DR., she has a 2yr old, and she's 18 months pregnant on top of all that, can you imagine being a male in that family?  That is why men invented everclear!)  Heck, I have one that is a Dr. Another that has a PhD, another that is a nurse, another that is adopting Russian children (I am a former marine, that last ones pretty tough for my brainwashed self to handle) another studying acting in college, but maybe the worse is one that is in law school. I have plenty of sisters to throw mean cuts at.  Although, they all have college degrees, heck I bet they have average of 7 yrs of college each between them. Do I really want to get into a war of words with them online?  I don't fricken think so!  So I try to chill, not say to many mean things, like Dr's are idiots, phd's are dumb, lawyers are scum sucking pigs, Nurses dont do nothing, actress don't live in real world (gonna leave the Russian kids alone, don't mess with kids, I do have some morals buttheads) but I don't say them things very often and if I do, its said in a loving, joking brotherly manner!  Now in person, no problem, they get outline, remmeber the 2x4? that's what I'm talking about! but online they would think they would whip my skinny butt! cant have that now can we.      Edited:  I want to point out that the Dr. sister and the lawyer sisters, husband drink bourbon with me!  so, I really dont want to get the girls upset less they wont let the guys come out and play anymore!  Hearse.

      The average monthly rainfall in my area is 3.41 inches of rain for the month of June. Now coming from West Texas that is alot of rain.  Here that is not alot.  We average about 32 inches of rain a year.  I started my pool the first weekend of the month.  Area lakes at the time were about 13 feet low.  Water rationing was a given, for the 9th year in a row.  Drought conditions etc.  All of DFW would suffer once more.  As of today we have received about 8 inches of rain in the dfw area for the month. 8 @#$#%$^$% inches!  Every lake is 100% full, and this will be the first time in 8 years that we wont have water rationing.  All because I started digging a damn hole in my backyard for a pool.  It rained about 2.5 inches since friday afternoon.  My backyard is a mud pit.  the pool did not fill all the way up, just about a two feet in the deep end, that I already pumped out. suppose to rain until wed?   Really pisses me off. I had laborers lined up to do cement work today and tomorrow, and next weekend was gonna install the liner and all the plumbing. That is shot to hell.  The only part that has been hard on putting in my own pool, is the fng rain! Hell if i wanted this kinda rain I woulda moved to Houston.

       urlLink    Panels from stairs view.  &nbsp; urlLink     The Picture above shows what I have finished as of Thursday the 24th.  I have 4 panels left to do. This saturday, I should put in the cement "coller" and get insdie the pool ready for the mason cement bottom.  Let me explain about this pool.  It is a vinyl liner pool.  The top 42" are a polymer plastic, with a polymer brace at each junction of the panels.  There are 20 panels plus the walk out stairs. On the outside of the panels, you put in cement, 8" thick and approx. 2' wide.  this is called a collar, it adds support to the walls.  once that is in the pool walls are not moving!  Each brace has a 2' long 4" sq brace that is drove into the ground before the cement is pored.  Then you plumb in the main drain in the deep end.  After that is done, the bottome is made from mason cement and sand wet mixed and leveled 2" thick.  this provides the smooth, none moving bottom.  The deep end, is made by coming off the back wall 4' and is dug down to 6'2" and is a 4'x6' rectangle in center, with slopes up to the bottom of the 42" walls. Its kinda like and upside down pyramid with top of the pyramid cut flat.  After the bottom is put in, plumbing is run for the pool.   As soon as plumbing is done, you put in the liner, and fill it up.  While the pool is filling up with water, you backfill on the backside of the walls with sand.  The backside is were the color is and the black braces are.  the bottom has the coller, on top of that you fill with sand to the top as the water rises, to create equal presure on both sides of the walls.  I have allready bought 12 yards of sand and will buy another 6 yards next week, that should be enough.  once the pool is full of water, check pumps and filters make sure they all work, and you could swim.  Of course without any decking, be litte hard to ge in and out!  so I am poring deck all around it also.  That is the last step!  My goal today is to be filling it with water on the 5th of July.

      Got all the back fence back up.  Looks ok from inside my yard, because most of it is hidden by shrubs and trees.   Its not straight, but it is level until it drops to my neighbors yard.  today I should get going hard on putting the panels up.   the way this pool works, is the sides are a polymer plastic with big braces, with a 8 in by 2 foot concrete color around the outside to keep them in place.  the bottom of the pool is a sand mason mix. then you put the vinyl liner in place.  for those that went to destin the pool at that house was same type of pool.

      Wife and I cemented in 6 post yesterday.  First time to use my new cement mixer. I bought a cement mixer new for 204 bucks tax and all, had to put it together myself. I could have rented one for 222 bucks for a week!  hummm what to do what to do!  wife figured out the best way to mix the concrete, as in what order to put the ingredients in!  If it comes to it, for the concrete for the pool and decking, she could mix while I pore it in.    we make a good team!  should get the fenc up today and start on the sides.  Bro in law is coming over after lunch and I am working half days this week, we should get alot done!

       urlLink    The dig is done!&nbsp; urlLink     Finally finished the dig!  Saturday, me and my brother in law spent 12 hours working with a skid steer loader (bobcat is brand and the one I rented was brand new, it was a big SOB) and got all but the hopper end done.  The hopper is the deep end, its 6 feet deep, 4x6 sq with the sides sloping down to it.  I hired some hands today to finish out the hopper end. It all needed to be dug by hand.  It would have taken me about 3 weeks to finish, what 3 guys plus myself did in 5 hours today!    I also have all the post for my fence dug, wife and I have 4 set ready for concrete, tomorrow will finish the other 5 and pore concrete around them.  tuesday we should be able to put the fence back up. What the deal is, my backyard sloped as much as 2.5 feet from my patio to the back fence.  we used the dirt from the pool to level it out.  Thus I had to remove a big portion of the back fence, raising it up as much as 2.5 feet.  This week we should have the fence done and sides done.  And one of my 3 inspections done!  I will update later this week.

      What better choice than me? Im a democrat. but i appeal to all the redneck republicans. I speak there language, literaly! If you listen to me talk and goerge bush, we sound alike, make no since, dont say nothing of importance, and think a 2x4 upside someones head is way things should be done.  I'm serious now. Im driving to work, someone cuts me off?  Get my gun and shoot them!  Terroist crash planes into World trade center, Goerge, gets a gun and wipes out a country!  Same thing, both pretty dang stupid, dont make since, but by golly, we fell alot better!  so I apeal to the gun totting people!  (mostly redneck republicans)  We both are from midland tx.   we both had failed buisness. (although, I didnt close mine oweing people money)  Now reason dems like me, I believe in social service, I believe in helping the poor (unless its the sob that cuts me off!) I dont mind paying taxs.  (for yall dumb rednecks, how do we pay for the roads you drive on?  the guns we use to kill the millions of innocent people in foreign countries?  taxs stupid!)  I believe that since I am a male I cant tell a woman what to do with her body (although there are a few I would really...oh never mind, thats bad!)  so yea, i could apeal to both side a little, Id make a much better president than george although, a turd in a punch bowl does that!  so call kerry tell him to pick me, and I can quit my job, funnell billions of govt contracts to friends and family, and all will be good in the world!  If you can think of some more reasons why I would make a good running mate, put em down!

      Talked to buddy yesterday.  His youngest son had birthday, so he was gonna take the little one out for all that is wanted by a 4 yr old. Chuckee cheese, laser tag and toys are us.  Now he ended up doing this, but it started off  pretty bad. Heck for one guy was probably worse day he will have in a long ass time. His older son, comes in from playing outside, he is about 7 I think, and goes straight to bathroom, to take bath.  This kinda odd, as is fact he don’t want anyone to come in.  Well momma finally gets in, and    This is hard to write about sorry.    The poor guy got into poison ivey and guys were is the worse place you can get poison ivey?  You got it!,  that is were he got it! Momma had to take him to the DR.  They might think about going ahead and inrolling him in counseling as I don’t know about you, or him, but that would mess me up for long time!  So next time your having a chitty day, just think, you could have poison ivey on your dingus and be sitting in a dr. office wondering if things are gonna keep working!  Have a good one!

       urlLink    pool is about 2 foot deep, to 3 foot deep full of water&nbsp; urlLink      This picture does not capture the whole thing. Basically, I am putting in my own in ground pool.  Now most say "ohhh we put in an inground pool, we love it!"  Well your a wimp and I dont want to here how you had an inground pool put in.  If you did not have a shovel in your hand digging it yourself you did not put in an inground pool.  you paid someone to put in an ingound pool.  when I say I am putting in an inground pool, I mean I am doing it all, from digging it myself to putting the water hose in it!  (I do accept help from friends and family! so I will change it to "we are putting in an inground pool".  we being me and my friends and family.  I was going to subcontract out the digging of the hole, but lazy drunk white trash fers didnt show, didnt call etc, so I rented a backhoe and got after it! Now my grandfather convinced me that I could do it, and he was correct!....that brings up a point, if as we get older we realize our dads were not as stupid as we thought they were, does this mean that there dads are even more smarter?  (more smarter?  is that like more bigger?  ahh you know what i mean so shut up!)  well, 3 days into it, it started raining, finally tally, rain gage 8 inchs, pool 3 feet of muddy water!  wooohoo dont need no water hose now do I?   I did get all the water drained and most of the hole dug.  This coming weekend I will be renting a skid loader to finish the dig, me and my brother in law decided that doing the last 2 to  6 inches by hand was to dang much work!  (2 inches is alot when it comes to dirt, some might think 2 inches is small, but they would be wrong!  Thats perverted humor for those that dont get it!)  Now if you have read this far, you might wonder how is asshole hearse able to stay in a good mood or rather how has he kept from going postal? I will give a cronological order of things.  bear with me.  sat, dad shows up, i rent backhoe, friend shows up, we dig all day. sun. dad, me and bro in law dig.  get about 70% done. sun night rains 1/2 inch. monday, 4 pm able to start up dig again by myself  (i had taken the whole week off work) tuesday, black tuesday, it starts to rain at 7 am, ends up stoping thursday evening. I           Call my boss ask if i can work the rest of week, since i cant do anything on           the dig, no problem he say. i am pretty pissed but what can you do. Wed., goto work in rain, bad drive, pissed whole time, get to work, and find out friends        dog had died, while his wife and kids were out of town!  family pet, kids are 3           and 7 or some such, had the dog 11 years he is bumed.  so my little rain not to        bad. thurs.  talked to friend about his dog tell him that sucks (Real guys dont show emotion          duhhh) he says, "I was felling sorry for myself, upset i had lost my dog, called          my wife, she is crying, she is back in town she grew up in with visiting family           and friends, and her good friend from high school, 2yr old had cancer and they           had just 'unplugged' him, and he passed away, so my dog dying is not nearly as          bad as that"   KINDA PUTS THINGS INTO PERCPECTIVE, WHO CARES ABOUT SOME DANG                          WATER IN A HOLE!  Friday, get back to dig after work,  Sat, get going on dig, but its slow, hard work, starting to get mad cause so muddy, so slow etc, wife talks to her sister, and gets the news that a fellow policman that works and is friends with her brother was killed by a drunk driver on a traffic stop in the town they work in.  again, puts the pool into the place it needs to be in!   I am taking it easy most of this week, gonna hopefully finish the dig this weekend. Kinda worried though, every time i get going on the dig, something unpleasant happens!

      one of my many sisters has her own blog. now a few things. I should not have graduated high school, she is in law school! When I was a senior in high school, she was like 7 yrs old, and had already read more books than I ever would!  so she can communicate just a little better than I can. Well maybe that is not is 100% correct. she can write much better than I can, but that does not mean I cant get someone to understand what I mean. a 2x4 upside the head gets a point across pretty good.  for some good reading check her site out.

      Well I figured I might want to clarify or explain (is that the same thing?) some things. I just sent email to whole family about my blog, and I realized a few things. 1. I am the worse speller in the family. 2. I do not know enlish, I know redneck speak. 3. I do not have the cleanest mouth. 4. I am damn honest in what i write. 5. I did not capitalize the I in the above! 6. My profile is called mikey humor!  so take it with a shot of tequila!  If I make you upset with my blog, remmber whos it is!  If you want to say something about my english usages, send all complaints to goergebushisanidot@whitehouse.gov! I talk as good as our beloved president! (but i have a bigger ______  so I am better off)  Mikey!

      I watch alot of the history channel and the travel channel  On one of them the other day, they did a special on Dolly Wood. Dolly Wood is a theme amusement park in tennesse.  Themed on Dolly Parton.   urlLink Dolly Wood   So, Friend that lives in Tennessee take the white trash quiz and scores under 30%.  Now, first, he drinks wine from a box. That by itself should make you 30% white trash.   But he also has family season pass to DOLLY WOOD!  He says it for his kids, but I know better.  He is into the grand ol opera stuff. I bet he even goes to the grand ol opera 3 times a year!  If that is not 100% white trash I dont know what is! heck he should have lifetime membership in the redeneck white trash society of tennesse!  Dolly Wood Jeez!

      One of my bros has been coming over and helping on the pool on weekends.  He is deaf so our communication is not the best.   I sighn worse than I type.   So he comes and helps saturday, about 4pm I thought I asked him to drive me to the hardware store.&nbsp; Guess not.&nbsp; about 30 min later he calls thru relay texas asking what kind of cement I wanted.&nbsp; he just took off without me to get what I needed.&nbsp; and he did get what i needed. was cool.   So sunday, we are working hard on putting down cement, and he tells me his legs are tired from dancing the night before.  Me being the big brother ask the only good question.&nbsp;   "So did you get lucky?"   he says "arghkdighh"&nbsp; (i dont know what the hell he said)  I said did you "get with a girl?"   at this point I think we had some more poor communication.&nbsp;  I think he said 2 girls.&nbsp; I know thats what he said.  I said, "you got with 2 girls same time?"  He said,&nbsp; "no 2 diffrent girls"  me,&nbsp; "oh so you got with one girl then got with another in the same night?"  he said something i didnt understand,  something about 2 girls same time, or something.  i then told katy, and he started yelling, stuff i didnt understand.  so i just said to him, "ok you got with 2 girls same time then 2 diffrent girls diffrent times later?"   at this point &nbsp;he quit talking to me.   so im wondering just what the hell kind of party he went to.  and next time he should invite me!   &nbsp;  editors note.   after reading this after i posted, thought i should clarify.&nbsp; Just picture said brother, and i think you know who it is, getting mad at me, then really getting mad when i said something to katy.   He said some choice words outloud!&nbsp; I think i embaressed him&nbsp;somehow!    &nbsp;

       urlLink    cement bottom day one&nbsp; urlLink     This is about 6pm sunday.&nbsp;  wife, her sister, my brother and me mixed cement most of the day. was a big team effort. Katy mixed it, her sister wheeled it to my brother, they scooped it into 5 gallon buckets my brother carried it to me and&nbsp;I put it in place. Notice the sticks sticking up?&nbsp; that is were the top of the cement goes to. most of its about 1.5 to 2 inchs thick, but this one spot is 4 to 5 inches thick, that takes alot of mixing to fill.&nbsp; I just smooth the cement so the top is even with the sticks, then i take the sticks out.&nbsp;  Also the main drain is in as is the nych for the light. The wife and I are going to do about 2 hours an evening on cement, should be done wed?&nbsp; or so. and during breaks I will finish the plumbing and run the electical. should be putting the liner in sat. with working pumps and filters. In other words, no deck done, but sunday we could be swimming.  &nbsp;

      &nbsp; I will be putting cement in the bottom of the pool sometime tomorrow. I still have to put in the main drain, shouldnt be but few hours for that early in the am. then its cement time. if i get all the cement in tomorrow, I will install the liner sunday and start filling with water.  that looks doubtful, as i still have some electrical to run.&nbsp; Might have to put the liner in next saturday. probably will plan on that but we will see.&nbsp; I have plenty to do even with liner out so wont rush things.

      I can do a lot of different titles for this post.  &nbsp;  My car will do 94  were is a cop when you need them?   White  trash should be shot!  Black lady helping a  white  guy!  &nbsp;  after you read threw this you will see what I mean.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I leave for work at 5:50 in the am. Its still dark.&nbsp; I drive 174 to I-35.&nbsp; At I35 174 is 2 lanes and the interstate is 2 lanes, after they merge its 3 lanes.&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The lane all the way to the left next to the concrete barrier is called lane one, middle is called middle and far right is lane 3 or far right.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was coming down 174 in lane "4", one to the right of lane 3, after about a 1/4 of mile it has to either exit, or merge with I-35.&nbsp; So each morning for last 6 years, I merge,&nbsp; I look over my left shoulder, check traffic, look again in mirror, use blinker, and merger, and most days I go ahead and merge all the way to the #1 lane, since I take it for the next 35 miles!  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This morning, I looked over my left, there was black expedition or suburban, about 150 feet back, plenty of room for me to merge to the #1 lane, I used blinker and did just that.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Next thing I know,&nbsp; I am being hit on my left side of the car, by a small green pickup!&nbsp; It knocks me around a Little, takes my Mirror completely off!&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Evedently he was behind the black truck, and as I moved over he had switched to the middle lane, then back to the #1 lane, about the time I was in the #1 lane.&nbsp; He was speeding.&nbsp; I know this since I was doing exactly the speed limit.&nbsp; (more about that in a minute)  &nbsp;&nbsp; My first thoughts were all bad words!&nbsp;&nbsp; but then he just keeps going.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Were is a cop when you need em?  &nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Well for all you butthead thinking hearse had done something wrong let me set you straight.  Reason I know I was doing the speed limit and was perfectly legal, is...  &nbsp;  I was following onto the Interstate a Texas State Trooper!  &nbsp;  This a-hole passes me on the shoulder, hits my car, takes my mirror off, and there is dps trooper in the #3 lane!&nbsp; course he didn't see it, as I pulled up next to him, the dps trooper that is, he just gave me a blank stare!&nbsp; so I took matters into my own hands.&nbsp; This white trash red neck SOB was not going to get away with this crap!  &nbsp;  I dropped the 4 cyc.&nbsp; hearse turbo charged, triple cross threaded header 2001 RED ford focus into 4th gear and went into High pursuit!  &nbsp;  Got my little boy up to 94MPH and guys that is all he had!&nbsp; Lucky the guy that sideswipped me, saw me and the black expedition on his ass!&nbsp; He realized, he had been fingered!&nbsp; I pull up beside him and motion for him to pull over!&nbsp; He shoots me the finger.  Now normally in DFW traffic someone shoots the finer, you just say to yourself, "oh well"  but I knew that the dps trooper was right behind us!&nbsp;  so I went into his lane.&nbsp; In all seriousness I was read to put that SOB into the wall.  When I was younger I drove some stock cars, plus played car tag with old cars, and I was in a demolition derby before I had a legal drivers license,&nbsp; If I wanted him to stop he was going to stop.  &nbsp;  I guess the figured he was fingered, between me and the black expiation, so he followed me to the shoulder.&nbsp;  I get out, he gets out, and I ask him "what the hell are you passing me on the shoulder for?&nbsp; you wrecked my car, took out my mirror"  His reply boiled down to "f you and nothing you can do about it, I am leaving"  &nbsp;  WELL&nbsp;  Ok asswipe, but first you might want to wait for the dps trooper.  &nbsp;  Him "I am not waiting for jack, @#$#% "  &nbsp;  Me&nbsp; "you don't need to, he is right there!"  as the trooper pulls up.  God that was sweet!&nbsp; to see his face, as he realized, there was a witness sitting there and a state trooper!  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  An hour later,&nbsp; local police finally show up,&nbsp; after ambulance,&nbsp; and 2 fire trucks, &nbsp;they couldn't figure out the "jurisdiction"&nbsp; it happened in Bureleson, we crossed into fort worth, and were sitting in Everman.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Burleson cop on bike takes over.  witness in black expedition had left her name with me, and said she needed to goto work.&nbsp; I completely understood.&nbsp; Was grateful she stopped.  Especially grateful, since I am white, the guy that hit me was white, and she was African American.  &nbsp;  I wonder, how many white women would stop if it had been 2 African Americans males?&nbsp;  I am thinking.....  ZERO!  If nothing else I am getting police report so I can call her and tell her thanks for stopping!  &nbsp;  so, cop is cool, but guy messed up big time.&nbsp; At one point I thought cop was going to arrest said a-wipe.&nbsp; If cop was not on bike 4 miles from his hometown I think said a-wipe would be in jail.  &nbsp;  He claimed I passed him and side swiped him.&nbsp; cop pointed out that My mirror that broke off left marks on my hood, so unless I was going in reverse said a-hole had to be passing me.  so guy changed story.  I never got the 4 different versions he claimed but he kept mouthing to cop.&nbsp;  Never mouth to cops.&nbsp; Even if your right.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  At one point I told cop, "look, this mirror cost under 150 bucks, I am not worried about the money, if this is a big hassle and nothing can be done, Ill chock it up to driving expense, not worth the headache to you to hassle with it I understand."  &nbsp;  this was awesome part.  &nbsp;  police said  "This guy has made me mad.&nbsp; He has lied to me half a dozen times, He shouldn't be driving and he is an asshole, I am writing this up.&nbsp; and I am calling the guys insurance co. To see if His policy is good like he claims it is,&nbsp; if its not, I am filling with the state to revoke his liscene.&nbsp; I will do this at 8am this morning....This guy is going down."  &nbsp;  evidently , his insurance card was expired, but guy claimed he had renewed.&nbsp; cop was hoping he hadn't.  In Texas, Driving without insurance you automatically lose your liscene for 6 months and the cop was hoping for this, especially after I told him I could care less about the insurance!  &nbsp;  so anyway, I get to work, leave early, pick up mirror on way home and install it in about 30 minutes.  Mirror cost me 65 bucks with tax.  not a big deal, chock it up to cost of driving.  &nbsp;  I will get police report and call his "insurance" co.&nbsp; if its valid, ill ask for my money.  If its not, ohh well.&nbsp; Life is to short to worry about the little things.  &nbsp;  But for sure I will call that lady that did stop and thank her.&nbsp; I am not going to ask her what she saw, or get her side of it.&nbsp; I am going to tell her I was the guy in the red focus and that No Matter What She Saw, THANKS FOR STOPPING AND GIVING YOU NAME AND NUMBER.  &nbsp;  her stopping and all was worth the 65 bucks for my mirror.&nbsp;  its worth a lot to see that there are good people out there in this world, that don't just go around bombing countries because they want to get re-elected!  &nbsp;  also liked it that now I know my focus can top out at 94mph!  &nbsp;  &nbsp;

           This weekend I decided to take a break from the pool and go to the lake with the inlaws.  Big mistake.        Saturday about 1pm I twisted my foot jumping from the shore to the boat.  Twisted it bad.  Finally about 4pm, I gave up and told them to take me back to the dock and to the emergency room.  It took an hour to get to the dock and that was a long hour, unbleivable pain, foot swelling up, every little bounce hurt.      So my sister in law and son take me to the emergency room in Dennison Texas.  Sister in Law was the days designated driver so lucky her!        Now mind you the last emergency room I had tried to get into was 17 years ago, Parkland hospital in Dallas, the worse emergency room in Texas at the time for a Saturday  at 1am.  (was appendix's, and they never did see me, finally left and went to a Catholic hospital across the street and they "saved" me! huh and you thought only right wing religous nuts saved people!)      So I was expecting the worse.        We drive up and sis in law goes and gets a wheel chair sitting outside, and wheels me in, they have a triage set up right at the entrance, no one there, but someone at the reception checking someone in.  sis in law goes and ask if anyone is working triage, "yes let me buzz them" Soooo, female nurse comes out.   Now mind you I have always had the most respect for the nurses in a hospital over anyone. they have the "crap" jobs.  they in my opinion are the ones that do the hard work.  Like a construction worker, the bricklayer lays the brick, but the architect gets the credit. so this nurse comes out starts the 50 questions.  Now I dont have a problem with the 50 questions, I would want someone to know if I am alergic to something, so they dont kill me,  Although she did ask one silly one.     Nurse  "so do you have any medical history?"    Me     "No, I am 38 years old and this is the first time I have ever been to the Dr."         Here's your sign!  actually what i said was, "well I am 38 so yes, can you be more specific!" Nurse  "have you ever had a Heart attack, diabetes, aids, head cut off, that kind of thing!" Me     "well no, unless you count the first time I saw my wife and I sure thought I had a Heart attack!"  Ok I didnt actually say that, I just said "ohh no, nothing like that" the nurse was nice and laughed as did the male nurse that was taking my blood pressure.  The blood pressure, I was thinking with all the pain I was in and all, that it would be real bad.  NOPE,  125 over 72   Little high for me but I guess itll be ok!  so then we have to goto the receptionist.  What a bitch.  If she had been my waitress I would have asked for the manager.  Why is it that people that work in hospitals are so damn mean and rude?  I wish I had brought my 2 x 4!  Even my son thought she was rude. I thought about it along time on why she and others that are not nurses or Dr.'s are so mean and rude and can come up with no acceptable reason. Do we think that the waitress at chillies likes waiting on drunk a-holes all day?  no, but she keeps a smile on her face all day.  Is it because they get paid nothing?  if that is the case leave and become a waitress!  She was having a bad day?  Hello bitch, i just messed my foot up, hurts like hell and ruined a vacation, but I was polite to you!  hell me being polite to anyone wether I am hurt or not is something!  but i treated you and everyone I met that day with respect, unlike you!  hell that wench she dont desereve the 2x4 she deservers the 2x6 with dung dipped nails sticking out of it!    she sucked!   anyway, they get me back to emergency room area and take my wheel chair away.  sis in law and son go back to lake since she is the designated driver and everyone else would need ride back to house, plus I figured I would be along time getting fixed up. so, Dr. Franklin, comes in we chat, he sends the x-ray technicians (some more rude a-holes, I hope that wench that moved my foot onto the x-ray board got athletes hand, from my athletes infected foot! she was another beatch!  I guess she was having a bad day also.) so seemed like forever since I was in such pain, but they had to take more x-rays but finally dr. says several hairline fractures and bad sprain on foot. walking boot, crutchs, some nice drugs and take it easy on foot. Now one thing I have learned in the last 2 years is,  ask, many many questions, "ok, take it easy how?  can i still do the chandelier and leather with the monkey or is that out?"  "what is the name of that drug your prescribing?  let me write that down, and what does it do?  can i drive after taking it?  the nurses got a little tired of me asking 1000 questions but I kept at it, (one nurse said it will be on the prescription bottle, I said thats nice but I want to write it down myself,   she gave me a pen let me write it all down and I am glad since my med insurance had em change name brands to some off brand stuff)   so i take some good drugs, and they release me.  I crutch my way outside, and no one is there waiting on me,  I find a chair outside and sit, drugged up in the cool shade and reflect on.... hell i dont know what i reflected on,  kind of drugged up, no pain!  total time from talking to triage nurse to sitting outside, half stoned, under 2 hours! I was very impressed!   Nurses all nice, and Dr. was very informative.  shocked is a good way to put it.  Now mind you,I told myself I was going to start paying attention to the medical stuff next time I went.  since sister and sister and bro in laws are DR's and Nurses, and I always bad mouth them, I wanted to be specific on what they did wrong.  Maybe It has always been the receptionist and the technicians that are rude beatchs, and I just blame it on the dr.?  One key is ask the Dr. anything you dont understand.  I mean anything.  I had him get specific on alot of stuff, yes I could tell he was kinda tired or frustraded? with me but once I got it i let him know.  and I thanked him, not for treating me so much but for explaining all that I asked.    No more vacations this summer, I am just gonna finish my pool and go take one in it!  And Dr.'s are still not that smart!  (thats for you Suzz)

Hey, what do you think of the whole Iraq thing? georgeb@whitehouse.gov   You know what my wife said to me last night? Her name is Laura and she’s real cool.

It keeps the panels from moving.  Next is running all the plumbing and pouringn the 2" thick concrete insde floor.  I am taking this weekend off from it, going to the lake! Im tired.

OOPS.  if I had read them earlier I would have noticed that it says to put on the copping then square and level pool.  What this does is help line up the panels and level them.  would have save alot of time and effort!  we are ok, but it would have helped to know it before we fought with it for hours.

       urlLink    Is it level?&nbsp; urlLink     It took several hours to get the walls level and square.  Dad and I argued for ever, not so much with each other but ourselves on how to get it square.  Both trying to remmber geometry.  I passed out from the heat about 2pm,  dad went in and took a nap, as he was falling asleep, he had a brain storm, so him and the my son went out, and squared it up.   Me i was really passed out.  The heat got to me (something about wearing or not wearing a hat, I will wear one for now on) Katy woke me up about 4:30 said, "your dad and chase have the pool squared up!"   I believe the walls are within 1/4 of an inch of being level and square. most are dead on, one corner gave us fits, its probably within an 1/8th of an inch from one corner to the other.    I checked after the concret collar was done yesterday and it looks right on.  close enough for me anyway!

      G. W. Bush was very depressed that people were saying he is stupid. So he calls his good friend Queen Elizabeth, who says, "Now George, what you need to do is to surround yourself with smart people. Let me show you."  She conference calls Tony Blair in and asks, "Tony, your parents had a baby. It isn't your sister and it isn't your brother. Who is it?"  Tony Blair replies, "It's me!" and hangs up.  G.W. Bush then calls Dick Cheney and says, "Dick, your parents had a baby. It isn't your sister and it isn't your brother. Who is it?"  And Cheney says, "Wow, that's a tough one. Let me get back to you."  So Cheney calls Colin Powell and says, "Colin, your parents had a baby. It isn't your sister and it isn't your brother. Who is it?"  And Colin Powell says, "It's me!"  So Cheney calls Bush and says, "It's Colin Powell."  And Bush says, "No, you idiot! It's Tony Blair!"

      The sun came out  yesterday after 6 days of rain! I was able to work on the pool yesterday evening.  Today should be sunny, and also all weekend.    I should be able to get all the walls up, and concrete collar around them done.  Its suppose to have a heat index of 104 degrees today. And I am happy as hell!  I can drink alot of water, get in shade for breaks, but at least I will be working on my pool.  For those that are interested,  as of now, I should have 7,500 in cost for the pool when Im done. That is for a 14 x 28 foot pool with a 6 foot deep end and 6 foot wide stairs.  and that also includes all the concrete decking im doing.  That same pool made with gunite with me being my own contracor,  would cost about 16,000 to 18,000  and if I had just hired a pool company would have been about 25,000 to 30,000. Also I leveled my yard, and did not destroy any of my shrubs or plants.  A pool company would have ruined alot of them plus tore up my grass in the front yard with there tractors.  It does pay to do it yourself.  Dad might be coming to help this weekend, I sure hope so, I need it.  I will post a pic I have of him driving the backhoe.  He was like a little kid on that thing, quit funny to watch.

      a few people have asked the cost so far on my pool.  Pool kit                      4730.00 backhoe/skid steer            1050.00 sand and sand gravel          1200.00 pipe/wire/concrete             250.00 laboreres once                 190.00  total to now.                 7420.00   I still need 300 in sand and 150 in bobcat rental=  450.00 concrete                                            100.00 gravel/pea                                           60.00   also going to upgrade to a salt water chlorinator for 704.00  this does not include the 200 for concrete mixer.  The only tool I didnt have. Also, I borrowed a wheel barrow froma friend along with 2 of his shovels, his wheel barrow is cheap plus he has helped so I am going to buy him a new wheel barrow.  also borrowed several digging tools from my sister in law, one , the pick ax is dang old, so going to buy her a new one since they loaned me all there shovels etc.  One good thing, is my bourbon drinking has gone way way down, you dont drink and work on pool, that is all you should drink is water so i have saved a few bucks there.  my goal was under 8,000   without the salt water chlorinator i would meet that, but i do want it as it will save me money in the long run.  a pooll this size built by a co. would cost about 25,000 to 30,000.   so we have alot of sweat payment to ourselves!

      wife son any I got another 4 foot of the pool floor done yesterday. Heat index of around 100 when we started late in the afternoon, early evening.  we have 8 feet left to go.  we can get 4 foot done today and 4 foot done tomorrow.  even with the heat index of over 100.  Friday evening will be spent cleaning up the bottom, (it still has mud and dirt in the deep end from the rain last week)  clean up sides, finish electrical and plumbing.  will either put the liner in sat or sunday, more than likely saturday afternoon. will spend sat am finallizing the cleaning and getting ready.  still have along way to go, after the liner is in, have to get all the forms built for the deck, that includes getting another 10 yards of sand, and 10 yards of dirt to level everything with the top of the pool.  Once the deck forms are done, i call for another inspection.  they inspect bond wire/electrical at that one.  when that passes we can start pooring the concret decking.   We will have to pour approximatly 525 sq. foot of decking.  that will take some weekends!  we are doing exposed aggregate.   i found a guy that did it himself and posted the how to on the web.   urlLink  link to how to on concrete
