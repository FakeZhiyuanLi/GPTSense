      23:21.   Opened my computer,&nbsp; to take a look at a list I made just a few days ago:    "Things to do before I leave."    that is, before I leave Israel. I'm going to China. Yep. It's gonna happen, believe it or not.   My name is Ittai. It's a very common name here, in Israel, and I guess in many ways, I'm a very common guy. Or maybe not?   Just until recently I was a student in Tel Aviv university, in the center of Israel.&nbsp;Working on a BA in&nbsp;East Asian studies and Computer Science - What a mixture, ah?&nbsp;   Besides that I had, actually still have, a job as a development manager in my dad's startup company, Motivia. Things are not clear about whats gonna happen with that job, and I have a lot to say about that, but not tonight (baby, I'm tired).   Anyways, that's really not what I came here to talk about. As I mentioned before, I'm leaving Israel for a while, I'm going to Beijing, the capital of China, and I'm going there to study Chinese. The place where I'm going to study is called Beijing Language and Culture University, we'll call it  BLCU  to save some keystrokes, allright? Or maybe we'll just call it  Beiyu , as the Chinese do.   Enough about me for now, let's go back to discuss my list.  The 14th item in the list was  "Open B-Log." &nbsp;        &nbsp;  So here I am, opening a blog. I hope it would be interesting, exciting, blah, blah..  If not exciting, then maybe it'll help me improve my English.  If not improve my English, then maybe help me meet women,  If not meet women, then   well,  who knows ? :-)   Till later   Yi Tai  איתי  伊太   (That was my name in 3 different languages - How many can you recognize?)

      Pack yourself in a bag Look,  You're bigger than you know.  Pack your thoughts,  pack your mind,  pack your sadness  and let go  Cause when you pack Your all existence  becomes a little bag!  And you're free, yes you're free from all those things you did and said  Free from your possession, free from rent and reallocation getting established in your profession improving technic of masturbation  So, pack,  as long as you can,   pack and disappear.  --  I'm not so good with rhyming in English, next time I'll write without those rhymes.  Till next time,  Yi Tai.

      Hi, it's me again.  On the 16th is my flight, and so many things are already happening..  So let's try to organize everything:  I sold my scooter today. The guy who bought it is named Ido. He seems like a nice guy, I hope the bank would think thesame about his check. When he finally took the scooter away, I looked at them both, leaving me alone like that. That scooter was inseperable from me, and it didn't even occur to me that I would be needing to find some method of transportation later on the day.. I managed somehow, though.   Same day, later on. I gathered all my friends at my favorite place in Jaffo, called Pua (Pronounced Pu-A). My sister came, and also two of my x girlfriends.. You know how it is when you've got mixed thoughts about stuff? It felt a little sad, it felt a little happy. If I knew for sure that I would come back in 6 months, I would have felt better, but I don't know nothing right now. That's what I like about the situation, and it also terrifies me, deeply.  I'm working on a seminar about Japanese films. That's where all my writing energy goes (Sorry, my dear blog, you'd be my favorite when I'm done with the seminar, promise). I'm really working at full speed on this seminar. I wanna finish it by Sunday, and I only did about half of it, and still need to see two more movies. Damn. Pressure, pressure, pressure.  What else? I've started to look for a flat ib Beijing, Currently through the net. I already got two offers, one of which is somewhat kinky - Living with this woman and her 7 year daughter, and she offers to cook for me (God knows what).  I'm experimenting with my new digital camera, it would take some time (Possibly, forever) before I manage to create nice photos.  Anyways, this is the park in the rear of my house.  Till next time  Yi Tai
