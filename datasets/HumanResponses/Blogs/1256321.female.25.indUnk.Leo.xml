      So Fantasia is our new American Idol.  It's nice to have someone two years in a row showing the world that NC isn't full of morons!  However, I do have to admit that I wish Diana would have won.  I do like her sytle a bit better.    My head still hurts, but at least I had a fun day today.  I love my road days.  I get to see tons of old friends.  :)  If I thought a couple years ago everything would work out this good, I would have switched jobs a loonnnnnnnnnnnngggg time ago!  Now it's time to hit the sack.  I have a friend coming in from out of town to say the weekend with me so I need to get some sleep.  And I also need to get up early to swing by Target to pick up my copy of Return of the King.  Shame on me!  I didn't get it on the release day.  What the hell is wrong with me?  G'night :)

      My head is pounding still... like it has been all day.  I seriously think I sleep standing on my head at night.  Someone, make it go away!  It's probably stress related and has a lot to do with the fact this morning I was woken up 6 different times.  I finally gave up and just got out of bed.  If it wasn't the rommie's kids, it was the dog, or someone calling me about something.  Why can't people just shuddup for a while a leave me alone?  I do like to have private time every once in a while.  I'm in a terrible mood, and don't really give a shit about much of nuttin.  I'm really getting sick of all the stupid drama that surrounds my job.  It's always he said that she said that my brother's half cousin twice removed's uncledaddy said blah blah blah.  I want to tell them all to grow up and just do their damn jobs.  *eye roll*  Okay, I must go to bed before I rip my head off to make it stop hurting.  I have affiliates to go play with tomorrow so I must get my beauty rest to be spunky for them!  Perhaps there will be more positive mumblings from me tomorrow.  Good night.

      So I've come to realize that I am never going to update my other website simply because I don't have time to sit down and write tons and tons of code, and because I'm just lazy and don't want to write tons and tons of code.  This, although cliche as hell, is much much easier.  So here I am, once again, back at blogger.  Perhaps you'll see some UPDATES!  But don't put money on it.

      Been cleaning all day.  Damn the man that invented dirt.  Three mop water buckets turned black, and I must have swept up a full coat of hair off the dog AND cat.  YUCKKKKKKKKKKKKK.  We won't talk about the kitchen!  Now I'm off to enjoy some pizza and a well earned night in the bed.

      Ahh, I'm really getting used to this whole walking routine at night.  I have wobbly jello legs at the moment.  It really does make me feel better to get out and walk.  Today marked my first official diet day, and I failed absolutly miserably flat upon my face.  But hey, it was a bad day to start considering I started that female thing today.  MUST HAVE CHOCOLATE!!!!!  Something has to keep me sane!  :)  Wish me luck on this diet adventure.  I've never really been serious about it before so we'll see how it goes!  Off to do some sit ups so my Princess Arwen will stop batting at my fingers while I type.

      After a tour kick off party for  urlLink IYF Pork , a friend over for the weekend, a birthday party tonight, all while working my ass off... I'm a little on the exhausted side.  The tour kick off party was great.  Lots of old friends over and some new as well.  We all had a good time.  We all had a drunk time.  :)  My roomie brought me home a small furry present a couple days ago.  Yes, I have a new kitten.  Her name is Arwen.  >^..^  *snore*

      After a long day of going to Albemarle for my cousin's wedding shower and back, then shopping with mom, and then shopping with my roomate, I'm realllllllllly tired.  But first, I'm enjoying a nice very LARGE glass of wine to better put me to sleep.  :)  I did get to go to  urlLink Dennis Vineyards  today for the first time ever.  I LOVE their wine.  Yum-a-licious!  Go buy some if you live in the Charlotte area.  I promise you won't be sorry.  I recommend their Spring wine.

      It's been hectic for the past couple days around my house.  I went to see a production of Grease at the  urlLink Blumenthal  in Charlotte Sunday night.  I throughly enjoyed myself.  Grease is one of my favorites.  Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dream Coat, and Hairspray are already in the plans for next year's Broadway plans.  Yay!  Yesterday was spent washing clothes and running around with a friend of mine.  Went to Lowe's to pick up some potting soil and mulch.  Finally, my front flower beds will look like they should!  And of course, I couldn't leave without another orchid.  Damnit, orchid are addictive!  We finished up at Lowe's, picked up my roomie's kids from daycare, and came back to the house just in time to for it to start pouring rain.  It stormed for about 30 minutes or so and we left again to eat dinner.  Glad we did, because evidently the power went out right after we left.  So yea, I spent most of the night without power.  Although, it is nice to be reminded how fortunate you are to have such luxeries.  Reading Harry Potter by candlelight isn't so horrible now is it?

      I'm happy to announce that Princess Arwen is feeling much better after a couple days of antibiotics in her system, and some serious TLC from her human.  She is up, running, playing, and begging for chicken again.  Glad she survived this!  I had my doubts.  Guess this is one tough kitty!  On a side note, go see  urlLink The Notebook !  I don't cry often at movies, but this one is a real tear jerker!  Wow.  Nicolas Sparks is my hero.  I will marry him one day.  Also, in screwing up last night and ending up in the wrong movie (that stupid Michael Moore movie about the president) trying to see The Notebook, I saw a trailor for  urlLink The Phantom of the Opera  movie that will be coming out around Christmas.  I'm stoked!

      My Arwen kitty is sick.  She's been sleeping and dumpy for a couple days until I noticed she wasn't really eating or drinking.  So this morning, I haul her and my exhausted self to the vet office before work.  90 bucks later, she comes home with me with an antibiotic, dewormed, and with a 105 degree temp.  She is *not* a happy camper.  Poor baby has had so much stuff shoved into all of her orafices today.  I'm sure she is severly traumatized and will never look at me again in the same way.  I have to keep on eye on her temp to make sure it doesn't spike back to 105.  She's at 102 now, thank god.  Still not sure what is wrong with her, but the antibiotic, worm med, and flea stuff seem to be helping her out.  She is still sleeping all the time, but looks a little better than she did this morning.  Everyone say a little prayer for her and hope to god it's not distemper or worse.

      Forget Calgon, take me back to the mountains where the air is free and the temperature is 60 degrees! I enjoyed Sunday night and Monday freezing my ass off in our mountain house.  It was a much needed get away where my cell phone has NO signal, and nobody has the phone number to where I am.  God, how lovely.  I'm returning July 1-4th, and I can't wait!  I plan to sit on the porch, watch the waterfall, drink wine and read my books.  Anybody know how to speed up time?

      It is *so* hot right now.  There is nothing more miserable than it being really close to 100 degrees with 100% humidity.  I have poured sweat for the past 2 days.  I feel disgusting, tired, and bitchy.  I really want to go lay in the bathtub with ice in the water.  My internal body temperture must be about 105 degrees.  I dispise summer.    On the better side of Sumer, my cousin... she got married today!  It was a very pretty wedding and everything seemed to go very smoothly.  I was in charge of taking non-formal pictures in black and white.  Let's just pray that my photography skills have heightened as of late and these pictures turn out good.  I took 6 rolls of film, so odds being 50/50, at least ONE of them has to be a good picture!  *crosses fingers*  I'm off to finish unpacking all my crap, and start masking off the bathroom so we can get to painting.  I'll post pictures at some point.

      I managed to scoot into a free screening of  urlLink this  movie tonight in Pineville.  I do have to say, it was rather hilarious!  Go see this film.  It will keep you giggling about all those high school geeks until it ends.  Vote for Pedro!

      I'm finally back in town after spending 4 days in the mountains.  Wow.  What a nice trip.  When can I sign up to go back?  I managed to read the 3rd Harry Potter book, and Fellowship of the Ring while I was up there.  I can do some serious book damage at the mountain house.  Nothing better than curled up on a couch, under a blanket, with a cat in your lap, and a book in your hand.  Ahhh.  Our evening was spent shooting off fireworks.  We got the crappy kind from the grocery store and about 100 spaklers and had a blast.  We managed to score some bottle rockets from our neighbors as well.  Glad I kept that empty Duplin wine bottle!  I knew that sucker would come in handy!  Everyone have a happy and dangerous 4th of July!

      The last couple of days have been hectic trying to get everything in the house done before my birthday party.  The bathroom has been painted a beautiful shade of purple.  There's places I need to go back and touch up, but that will come later.  I did make a boo boo and manage to forget to paint a whole strip of wall where the wall light went above the mirror.  Thankfully, I just moved a mirror bracket, and remounted the stupid thing.  Worked like a charm!  :)      Yesterday, I took $30,000+ of inventory out to my affiliates to stock them up for rental season.  After loading and unloading all that after painting my muscles were screaming.  But when I got home, late I might add,  it was cleaning time.  I started on the kitchen and did the dishes, cleaned the cabinets and appliances, and wiped them down with clorox.  I finished up the kitchen with a good sweep and mop job.  Then I swept the hallway after picking up stray stuff, and mopped.  Then, I got in that nasty disgusting bathroom, got on my hands and knees and proceeded to scrub the floor by hand.  *shudder*  Just thinking about it makes me wanna barf.  Ew.  I cleaned dirt and human/animal hair from every corner.  Wiped down the counter, cleaned the mirror, then mopped the floor.   The toilet and tub were cleaned right before I laid in the bath rub full of hot steamy water for an hour.  There is nothing like a long hot bath, with candles, a mud mask, and a kitten to keep you company!      So now were here.  Gotta get ready for work in a few.  And tomorrow is my birthday!  Big party tomorrow night and you're all invited.  I am going to eat lunch with my mom and a friend at Carabbas, and then going to get my drivers liscence renewed at some point.  Fun fun.  I'll let ya know how it goes!  ;)

             I challenge all of you to broaden your music horizions and purchase  urlLink Honey Child's  CD from  urlLink CD Baby .  I am amazed that this band is not rich and famous.  It's probably one of the best local bands I have ever heard in the Charlotte area.  Wow.  It is rumoured that there are free downloads from their CD Taller on their website.  I say, just buy it.  With it's musicial diversity, there is something to please every craving.  This CD is bound to live in my car CD player for many many months.    Mad props to the guys and gals of Honey Child.  You've earned my respect.  And Steve, if you ever seen this, you are such a rock god! See you at work. ;)

      It's cold!  Someone stop the presses!  This fortunate change in the weather has been MUCH appreciated.  Someone is finally hearing my cries about it being just too damn hot!  *does a little jig*  Not much to write about.  Work is getting busier and busier, and I think I feel the twinges of a cold coming on.  Let's just hope it's allergies.  I really don't need a cold right before I start working 50 hours weeks.  Got new pics of Arwen kitty to post as soon as I yank them off my camera.  Totally cute indeed!
