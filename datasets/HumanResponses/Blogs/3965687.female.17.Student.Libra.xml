             I suppose I should have seen this coming. A little cliche, true, and overplayed in both movies and books, but there it is. I like him. I've heard it from everyone..."Aren' t you getting a little close, Axe?" and "That's a little unprofessional, don't you think, Axe?"  They won't come out and say,"Axyl, you're a friggin' idiot" the way I would have by now, were I in their position(s). And it's amusing as well...divine irony, as it were. I have thought him attractive since I first encountered him; I was amused and intrigued by his intellectual capacity, and enjoy speaking with him. But the night before last, I realized that I like him on a more personal level. I was looking at a picture of him and smiling...this is insane. I don't understand. I don't intend to let him know...of course, in that case it's a little silly of me to post this, but whatever. I don't believe he reads these anyway.   *sigh*                                                                                      Axyl

       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Finally. I am getting ready to leave, having registered for college and whatnot. I have twenty-six more days before I leave; for the last three or four years, I've been hanging on...every time I got frustrated or hurt by something one of my parents said or did, I'd tell myself, "Only a few more years, dear, just hold on for another two years." And now...I'm telling myself, "One more month, dear, just one more month before you move out."&nbsp; But all the money required...it's an insane amount, and I feel like my life revolves around nothing else. Everything that I need....I never thought that I could be in need of so&nbsp;many trivial things. I was under the impression that I would have just accumulated these things, the way that I had for high school.&nbsp; My head is going to explode.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Axyl

        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Last night, I had a dream about my ex. It wasn't anything special; it was actually very commonplace...the normal,emotionless sex that we always seemed to have because it never mattered to me whether or not we did. Every time we were together, that's what we did, regardless of my desire to do other things. I'm glad he's gone; but the sound of him crying and whining on the phone to me, and the memory of our relationship before it all became wreck and ruin still hurts. Today at work, I was pensive and slightly sad because of it. My silence and the absence of customers gave me some time to think, and I tried not to dwell on that specifically. I thought instead of the times before I dated some of these fools...when the guys in my life were almost completely comprised of those I knew in martial arts. Back when I used to have fun with the guys I knew. Especially when Mr. B wasn't there. The lesson would be taught either by myself or Tommy, and mostly would be spent sparring amongst ourselves. There is nothing better in this world than lying in the warmth of the afternoon with friends after physical exertion, skin pressed against the coolness of the grass, feeling the heavy heat in your muscles and knowing they'll be sore the next day and loving it. Our belts and do bak tops would be thrown to one side due to the casual nature of the lesson, and I'd be nestled in the shade while everyone else was in the sunshine-- about twenty minutes in the sun is enough to burn me pretty badly, and after the painful process of peeling, my skin is just freckled...I can't tan-- making sure that everyone was hydrated, that Wes's nose was okay, that the crack I'd taken with the staff was really&nbsp;only a bruise. It was even better when Kyron was still there, because behind his perverted immaturity     he was my intellectual and physical equal. Every one of them was my rock in some capacity. I counted on them, on their sweet, brotherly honesty, and I thought that I could get that from any guy; I thought it was a given, took it for granted. Friends and neighbors....times like that, men like that....are so unspeakably rare. Next to men like those I've been friends with, those I've dated hardly bear mentioning. It's not often you can beat the hell out of a guy, have him knock you on your ass, and then hug each other like nothing happened. At one belt test, when Wes almost liberated one of my teeth and busted my lip, I think we even shocked our grandmaster by hugging afterward. Men like that aren't made for dating, sadly. I wish they were.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Axyl

        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are, actually, a few victories to celebrate. A*'s problem seems to have been solved, the Cuddlesluts (that's our coffee-shop group) although we're one less in number are for the most part back in contact, financially everything seems to be on schedule for me....But today blew like no other. I was almost late to work because I'm lazy, and I made myself a peanut butter and honey sandwich; since I'm hypoglycemic, going anywhere without eating is a bad idea. So, sandwich, book, and hat in hand, I get in the car and prepare for my first ten hour workday. Unfortunately, I dribble a lot of honey on myself, and all over my hands. That was mildly frustrating. I just went into the back and scrubbed off my hands. The next four hours were uneventful....maybe even pleasant if one can say that about work. Then....oh, then....one of my friends at work, who goes by Potter, has been training me on register. The day before he had blown up at me for doing something incorrectly; it made me angry, but I accepted it because he was having a horrible day, and because he's simply a meticulous person. Telling him at that&nbsp;point that, had he wanted&nbsp;me to do it a&nbsp;certain way, he should have trained me accordingly would have just been unfair and cruel.&nbsp;But today I was doing him a favor, did something else incorrectly because he was once again not doing his job, and he (again) got angry. For some reason this made me furious...I had to go outside to avoid completely losing my temper. I eventually got over it, as my discipline helps me to do, but for the rest of the day, little things irritated me. The light refracted off the tile floor and into my eyes; I've always been highly sensitive to light, I suppose because they're blue. A young woman had her perfume on very heavily; likewise, I'm sensitive to scent, so that as well bothered me. And above all, I hate whiney fuss pots, which today included myself.. so even I frustrated me. But ah...praise John, he let me come home early, and there is nothing in this world that a scalding shower cannot cure. And curse him, too, because I have to go and do the same thing tomorrow...&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Axyl

        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Strange....A*&nbsp; is having some problems. I haven't asked many questions regarding the fine details, but he's told me that he and a certain individual are clashing. For his own privacy, I won't go into any more detail than that, but what's really getting me is that I'm honestly concerned for him. I barely know him. Heh. I guess I'm a nicer person than I originally thought. Another thing that gets me is the fact that I'm not even thinking about including this in my story. I'm learning a bit about the psyche of the vampires he's describing through the travail A* is experiencing, but I feel no desire to make a tale or documentary of it. It's rather like taking a picture of an old woman stumbling inelegantly; it would be a blow to his pride, I'm sure, but patently indecent. I've known about my inner set of morals, but I hadn't believed that they extended this far.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Axyl&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    Finally. After all the time that I've spent looking, I got my interview. For about a year now, I've been attempting to write a semi-accurate (how accurate can fiction be, anyway, and especially on such a disputed subject?) novel on vampires. I have been looking for something completely nouveau and interesting, a theory/idea/reality (phrased as such to satisfy all parties) totally unheard of. I have found that (and a little more...add a quick wit and a dash of nihilism) in a man, referred to herein as A*.&nbsp; Thus far he has answered every question that I've asked with honesty and some humor, and I have never heard anything on the subject as interesting and plausible as what he tells me. Everything else I have gotten from every other source has been crap: i.e., the subject knows how to fly, has been in the same body for hundreds of years, subsists on nothing but blood, knows Dracula, has real fangs, is telekenetic, can read thoughts....but when asked for proof or a demonstration on any of the above, gives an answer along the lines of&nbsp; "It isn't allowed/it would drive you insane/this is the wrong time or place," etc, etc, etc. You see why I'm so joyous now...In addition, this A* has an engaging personality, and does not put on airs; he is genuinely intelligent, and it always refreshes me to see another sentient being on earth, human or no.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Axyl

        My hand is basically hamburger from the middle finger to the thumb, but the box of flour I was beating fared much worse. Tonight I was more angry than I have been in a long time, and since I have my father's Irish-Italian temper, that truly is an achievement. The cretin responsible was one of those bottom-of-the-barrel     blue-collar rednecks who drinks copiously and often for no other reason but that he can. He was standing at my counter, looking at the menu board. His son, a cute little blond kid of about ten, was doing likewise, but simultaneously spinning the coin-catcher situated to the left of the second register, and had to raise his right arm up to do it. His father, having made his decision, came up behind his son and shoved his finger into the boy's side, just below the armpit, right at the gland; in martial arts, I've been trained to aim at that pressure point to induce debilitating pain and vomiting. The kid flinched, and so did I. I knew that had to hurt at least a little, for his father had done it with a none-too-gentle hand. He then proceeded to grab the boy's hair and pull him foreward. The boy uttered no protest, and since the man was just dragging him rather than yanking at his scalp, it couldn't have been too awfully painful. But my left hand knotted itself into a fist nonetheless, because of the mere action, and I thought: if he does this in public, what must he do to the poor boy in private? The man caught me glaring at him and said,"You have kids? Well, this is how ya do 'em..drag 'em around by their hair." It took everything I had to just glare. I don't believe I took my eyes off of him unless I was talking to the little boy. The broom was so close at hand....while not the ideal weapon, it is roughly the same size and weight as an escrima, and after training with my jo staff, swinging that would have been nothing. I wanted so badly just to knock this man down to prove a point, but I didn't, and I managed to hold my peace. I caught bits and snatches of their conversation as I cleaned the dining room, and the father would say something in one of those harsh, terse undertones that I could tell was unpleasant, and I even heard him break off in midsentence a few times when I came near enough that I would have been able to distinguish his words, then continue when I moved away. There are few things in life more despicable than hurting a child, and I wanted to run up to the boy and shake him, to say "You don't have to take this bullshit, you know." But it's easy for me, a spectator, to have such thoughts. And earlier than that, an even younger boy had come in with his father. This kid's pants were too short by about three inches or so, and his shirt was worn through in some places. His father was a rather large man with long greasy hair, badly mended glasses, and what seemed an aversion to bathing. He seemed, however, to be a pleasant enough man...rather quiet, bashful. The boy had a resentful quality; he was about seven or so, and he wouldn't look me in the eye. Probably because I was a stranger, but I got the impression that he was perhaps embarrassed about something....I wish, and always have, that I could make up for all the wrongs in someone's life, correct them somehow...especially with children. I know how much it hurts not to have confidence, and think that everyone who criticizes you is in the right. I wish that just a few words, one person believing in you, could be enough. I used to be That Kid, the one who dreaded school, who walked with a bowed head, wearing a hand-me-down windbreaker gotten at one of the rich kids' yard sales, the one who laughed quietly when everyone else said their lives were screwed up because their parents never gave them enough lunch money. But I had that one person to encourage me, at various times in my life. I wonder what would have happened if I'd been like one of these two kids, and had not had that single accepting voice.

              I have been warned by many of my male friends against working in a predominantly male-populated establishment; I expected, because I am much younger than the other women working, the flirting and offers of sex whenever it is "convenient" for me. It doesn't offend me, because I know how men work up to a point. And all of this, plus everything that has gone on with Van --my ex, for all two of you who don't know-- has made me realize one simple truth: I am never going to be able to obtain my dream. Again, for all two of you readers (about whom I care, at any rate) who don't know my dream, it is this: a well-paying and stimulating job as a Ph.D. with my own office, a large house in New Orleans or Charleston, a good and dependable husband with a steady job, two girls and three boys, and hopefully a set of twins somewhere in that number. I can get the job I want, provided I can pay off the next three years of college, and can in that time come up with the money for graduate school...but I don't believe I'll ever have the kind of married or family life I want. I don't know that I will have either of those at all, in any condition. As time goes on, I believe less and less in love. I am actually beginning to question its existance, something I have never before done...and what is worse is that I feel justified in my lack of faith. I have been told that everyone experiences a time like this, and that something extraordinary happens to prove their atheism of love wrong, yet to a majority of the people I know precicely the opposite has occurred. I don't know....I'm waiting for something to change my mind....although, at this point, I don't know that anything can.
