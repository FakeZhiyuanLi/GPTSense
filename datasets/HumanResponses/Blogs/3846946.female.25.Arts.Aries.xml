      I am promptly going to bed after I write this... harrowing day, PMSing & feeling cranky, not enough sleep and too many thing to be in charge of.         We did a test shoot this afternoon at Punggol Park for next Sunday's early morning shoot. Rain made everything mushy, so we got what we needed and retreated to Bliss for drinks before I went to do sunset mass.         7th month has started! Yes, its that wonderful time of the year. Hougang is a very traditional (read: heartlander) estate and people here are really into this stuff. There was the tentage set-up for prayers and stuff in the big open field next to Hougang Mall, and a 'ge tai' that's planted itself in the open space near my apartment, which is fully in the wake of its blasting music. People earnestly burning stuff everywhere and the place reeks of ash and camphor.   Anyway, tomorrow is St Anne's feast day and some of the choir folk who are a little more sentimental about their ties to that parish are popping by for the mass celebrated by Archie.   Was feeling very distracted during mass actually, my mind was not fully where it was supposed to be. I get that sometimes, thousands of thoughts racing thru' my head for no real apparent reason... I did hang around to have dinner with the choir folks who I didn't see much of last weekend. That's always nice! :)

      Some of us celebrated Leon's 24th birthday with dinner at Marche and then Leon's choice of film, 'House of Flying Daggers' as the night's entertainment. It was indeed... entertaining, but not at all as intentioned. I think the 9 of us guffawing and making snide remarks about corny oriental film conventions probably did not go unnoticed by the rest of the evening's audience.  And Leon was a good sport to don the LEON LIM t-shirt I had made for him... well, not made, but bought and decorated. When one has a name with 4 letters, personalised gifts are a possibility worth consideration. Well, that and I like to personalise gifts rather than buy them off the shelf...          And that's them assuming 'Flying Dagger' stance...         With their damsels standing by...  Left off their bubbly company to pop by a friend's place and wound up leaving for home at bloody 4am in this morning... was not entirely good for energy level in facilitating this morning's workshop, but it went well. This being the 3rd of 4 sessions I have with them, the next being scheduled for end-August while they have other facilitators come in with other segments of the course.  Working with AWARE to package the programme for sale to schools on a massive scale. My involvement involves concretising the lesson plans and facilitator training, and it looks really challenging and fun.  I like playing games, but they are indeed dangerous things to do, for people will always cheat, and there will be those who will somehow, get left out when too many people want to play at the same time. I am admittedly, not a good sport.

      I find myself purposefully obtuse to the obscure. It is not to say I do not appreciate multi-layering of any sort, but to those who package the truth so deftly that they evade any level of commitment from making the remotest statement for a fear of rejection or of illiciting ill-will. The folks who bear judgement on those they deem lowly, hidden behind their tight-lipped smiles. They who sidestep honesty with the dexterity of a tango dancer, safe in their ham-fisted world.   Why embellish for embellishments sake? It is harder to say simply, what one thinks, in blatant honesty, than to decoupage the truth until clear visibility is marred. Conversations become riddled with double entendres and layered meanings, all to what aim? For tact? For courtesy's sake? For the illustration of literary deftness? I am not won over, I am put off!  I find myself increasingly washed over with cynicism these days. That is well and good, I could do with a little more jadedness as my foolish soft-heartedness gets me in situations where I come out scathed. Let me make full use of my theatre training to mask my true feelings... it will ultimately be to my benefit.   I am no longer a child playing adult games, and I should not tolerate the antics of those who still are. My tantrums are no longer for the eyes of others who cannot endure human expressiveness and emotion because they have their own bottled up, like a pressure cooker about to explode. I will not partake in that pent-up world but neither will I fall victim to its wrath.

             Got cajoled into dinner at Hougang Mall and chanced upon this, a speciality stall making ornamental wax hands moulded on the spot, with the customer's own hands. Hand is dipped in ice water, and then in hot wax. Hand is eased out, and then wax hand is duly decorated in colors to the desire of the customer. Pretty interesting tho' absolutely useless, tho' there were people who used it to make hooks for their keys, handphone holders, and (gasp!) praying hands and joss stick holders for their altars.  I wonder if they do other appendages... It would be cool to be able to literally put my feet up on my desk everyday at work, even if they are wax feet. :)  And today was Fr Barthoulot's funeral at St Joseph's Church. He was 88. I shall always remember his sparkling blue eyes... The photographic memories of the mind far outweight the clarity of photographs or wax mouldings.

              Had my virgin ceramics class this morning at NIE... feels like I've enrolled myself in art school rather than teacher school and I think I'm going to quite like my classes. The various studios are awesome; state of the art, spacious, very new&nbsp;and well-equipped. The Art faculty members are&nbsp;relatively laid back&nbsp;but dead&nbsp;serious about art... an attitude I really like.&nbsp;           And just a side note... try this if you're in the vicinity of Tampines : Herbal mutton soup. I am an absolute fan, and while this isn't the sort of thing to indulge in too often for its cholesterol content, the ride is worth it. Other good versions of this dish&nbsp;can be found at the Geylang Bahru Market (my old office lunch place of choice), and Chomp chomp. Very different from the green indian variety which I'm not particularly fond of.

               We were at the Yamaha showroom at Plaza Sing coz Amery wanted to check out the grand pianos there. The organ I had my own eye on however, was the spanking new incarnation of the Electone series. Since there's absolutely no point for me&nbsp;having a good&nbsp;expensive instrument at home (I don't perform or teach at home), I am resolved to attempt tp persuade Fr Tay to get the nice metallic toy, while I shall invest in a nice 88key weighted keyboard I can hook up to my computer. Can't wait for my first salary from MOE in mid-sept already!   Baden baden's a nice little watering hole in Holland Village opposite Wala Wala, which I visited today with Amery and Claudia. Basically Eisenhoff beer and pub grub, but laid back enough for my liking. 1 for 1 on the booze which meant... more booze! Haha!   This week feels like a whirlwind ... At times I catch myself and worry where its all headed, and then I realise that the point of it all is not to analyse or agonise, but to play by ear, go with the moment and enjoy it, and not place expectations or emotions in things that really do not deserve the weightage I tend to accord them. I shall try to take life easily... not be hung up on my insecurities and just let loose and be free... switch off and just be. As long as I look after myself, play safe and work with clear understandings in all parties involved, and healthy moderation in everything ... I am OK, and having a great time at that... really! Whee!!! :)    P.S.:   And yes, this entry's been slightly censored... I am resolved not to kiss & tell. Better for the reputation.... hee!  :)

      Was out shopping for appropriate&nbsp;presents for the various weekend birthdays (lots of Leos feature prominently in my life, mother included) when bumped into Len and ended up wandering Raffles City with him.   Left Len at bus stop and promptly walked into path of Richard my choir member, on his way between work appointments... turned the corner again and bumped into Eric, my ex-boss just outside the Substation where I was headed to hold auditions for Nine Eleven, and ended up having impromptu dinner with him at Food Plus.            The auditionees were none so spectacular, but I reckon suitable for the performance...           I somehow ended up having drinks and then midnight supper with Amery, from the auditions, together with an impromptu visit from german class Vanessa who I haven't seen for donkey years, and who was looking mighty fine as usual...            I reckon this will be a pretty interesting production to work on after all...&nbsp; realise also my utter knack for making people open up! ;)

             Was taken to dinner at this wonderful herbal charcoal steamboat place near Kovan Centre on Lim Tua Tow Avenue... tis one of the foodie places in an entire street of food and where the choir's favourite durian spot, 'Emicakes', is.

      In the midst of a quiet afternoon after waking up at 12noon from 14 hours of sleep to recover from an&nbsp;exhausting&nbsp;weekend. What makes this week's idleness all the sweeter is that today is my 1st official salaried day from MOE, tho' NIE term proper starts the following week (2nd August) due to NTU orientation frivolities.   I have to reorientate my schedule around my NIE schedule, get into the mental framework to handle readings, assignments and tutorials after 2 years of post-uni brain atrophy. Meeting&nbsp;new&nbsp;people&nbsp;and worrying about how they'll take to me is another harrowing but welcome ball game. It IS hard to meet people after you leave school...  That being said... I shall do what I damn please, at least for this week! :)

             Spent the whole of my lazy Sunday afternoon with Leonard after my choir committee meeting scheduled too early in the morning and wandered the flea markets at Clarke Quay for curiosities and popped by the Hotel Otani rooftop for a look-see at the skyline...          That rooftop's one of my favourite nooks on the island... nice view too, of the skyline. Haven't been there since I used it for&nbsp;2 film shoots about a year ago and was reminded of how utterly hot it can get up there. Needless to say, we zipped back into aircon comfort in Starbucks for overpriced coffee and to watch the toy collectors gleefully walk by with their&nbsp;finds from the flea market and a couple with a dressed-up pomeranian with the most bewildering expression Len mimics to a T.         Had a bit of a rehearsal with Nanda and Kwanghan (who Nanda and I have aptly christianed 'Gollum', unbeknown to the aforementioned individual) at the Esplanade 'breakdancing area', which is a wide expanse of indoor space joining the Esplanade to Citilink Mall.   And surprise surprise, a post-rehearsal supper at Komala's in Penninsular Plaza saw us witnessing yet another brawl, this time involving an indian national and counter staff.

             Watched I,Robot at Junction 8 with David after church today... Quite liked it actually, awesome cinematography and special effects, but with a nice plot to boot. Was thoroughly engaged and especially appreciated the attention to detail. I also can't help but think that Sonny looks remarkably like Fr Luke Fong, but that's just me! :)   Am determined to keep next week for idleness and indulgence. It will be mental space I know will be appreciated, for it'll help me rewire my brain to get back into the academic frame of mind. I shall fill it with afternoons at the pool, time with friends, movies, sitting at cafes reading, staying home and watching tv, wandering, photography, beach time, chilling out at pubs of choice...   And Fr John Bosco seems nice. Had our 1st mass with him today, and a welcome party by the liturgical ministries which I didn't attend.   Gee... this weekend's been so chock-full with so many things that I'm actually looking forward to Monday when I have nothing to do.

      I had my second workshop with the PGH girls today. I had no real lesson plan but decided to play by ear on things today. It worked rather well, in that I could play off their participation when moving from one thing to another. Today's session explored identifying the obstacles in the way of achieving ambitions. They are indeed, engaged, and I guess, probably more mature than other teenagers their age for their experiences.  Arrived at the centre in tremendous rain... having dragged myself unwillingly out of bed at 7.30am after reaching home and falling asleep close to 4 in the morning. Funny, I seem to do my best work when I'm utterly&nbsp;spaced out and sleep-deprived. ;)

      There are days when I want to die, not have to care, or bother about my future, or my past... not feel, not have to bear hurt or rejection, or failure... I want the numbness of a high... the heady feel of an intoxication... the sting of pain on skin as intense as ultimate pleasure&nbsp;itself, distracting me from emotional turmoil within... I want to not think, not feel, not be, and to just float, float, float into oblivion... where I am weightless, formless and undefined.   He says he cannot love me, but yet I know he cares a great deal. After all, friendship and love are two very different things, as I've painfully learnt, and thru' my rose-tinted glasses, I mistook one for the other and now I still can't get rid of feelings that have built up over the months. It all just gets me down... not that I'm depressed, or gone alcoholic&nbsp;and wallowing in self-pity, but that I just feel generally out of spirits and really really tired of searching for love because each time I'm dead sure I've found it, it shirks from my touch.&nbsp;   Spoke to Nanda about my need to wrap the production as soon as possible. He understands more now and we'll work together to get it done to the best of our ability.&nbsp; Very exasperated with Kwanghan... he can be very obtuse.   No, I don't want to die today... so many exciting things are starting up and I wish I could be as happy as I am exhiliarated about getting into things and getting my hands dirty.

      I have a lot of pent up rage, I realise. Rage that makes me want to cause pain, to suffocate and badly hurt those who hurt me.&nbsp;I am unable to act on that rage though. I cannot scream and shout or tell it as it is when I'm angry... I retreat and implode. My instinctive reaction is to go silent and cry rather than to confront. In public, I forcibly detach myself from emotional instinct when I need to be strong and dominant, but when the confrontation is over, and I am alone will I&nbsp;burst into tears when no one can see me.   I teach kids to channel that rage into art... why can't I do it myself?&nbsp;I realise with irony that I, a person who teaches communication skills and conducts drama workshops on self-expression... is almost incapable of expressing negativity.

      Things feel tense, with forced proximity. I thought I was OK but I don't think I am. I don't know if he'll ever want to see me again after tomorrow,&nbsp;I may have&nbsp;put him off completely by my neuroticism and my flaws. I miss what we had... but I don't know if it can ever be the same and it feels like a part of me has died.   Romance is an annoying thing that gets in the way of good friendships.

      After rehearsals, we decided to go for supper at the coffeeshop next to Allson Hotel. We took the backlane behind St Joseph's Church and the Tan Chong Motors building. Whole lot of bengs and lians there, it looked exactly like a scene out of Royston Tan's '13'. About 15min later as I was ordering food at one of the stalls, I felt someone run by me, and I saw him fall and scramble. Realised he was being chased by another and when I turned to look in the direction they came I saw the whole lot of teens that had been standing in the alley running in their direction. Common sense made me realise the need to wait for the mob to pass before I zipped&nbsp;back to my table. Amid shouts from the stallholders, a huge brawl ensued just outside the coffeeshop. Several men stepped in and broke up the fight after a good amount of trying, not before having everyone up in arms about the commotion, and the police being called.   Cops arrived 10 minutes after the fight had dispersed. By then all the kids had disappeared but we did see a few linger around. Things looked really planned, it didn't seem like something that had just 'happened' but that they had laid in ambush. There was a plan,&nbsp;their people were planted in specific places&nbsp;in the vicinity, they had&nbsp;eyes watching.&nbsp;All of them were kids, teenagers probably still in Secondary School, and there were at least 40 of them in the alley, girls and boys.   I hate knowing that such things happen in sterile Singapore, probably on a daily basis. I feel pretty disturbed by the whole thing... being in such close proximity to what may well have resulted in death. Today has been a&nbsp;reminder of the extent that teenagers may fall by the wayside, teenagers that I will be teaching. Are they all going to wake up tomorrow, put&nbsp;on their uniforms&nbsp;and go to school? What's going thru' their heads as they sit in classrooms, being washed over by formulaes and facts?   This was no movie, or magazine article... this was as real as the splattered blood and broken chairs we passed on our way to the MRT station. An act of violence had been committed by children and what we saw was merely scratching the surface of what lies beneath, shrouded in darkness and secrecy of a world I will thankfully never enter.   I suddenly feel very inadequate and inexperienced for my years.

      This guy sat next to me on the bus all the way back from Changi Airport where I went to meet Claudia for dinner. He sat really really close to me, legs against mine; hand practically on my thigh.&nbsp;I got off at my stop and he follows me all the way thru' the dimly lit void deck to my lift-landing, and then starts talking to me then, saying that he's a sports therapist and notices that I have tight muscles that he can do something about.  &nbsp; He gave me his number, and told me to call him. He lives in my block, or at least, in my cluster of blocks. Is reasonably OK looking, speaks OK english, sounds educated, and was friendly and all, looks like he's in his early 30s at most, but I don't know, I get a funny feeling about him...&nbsp; &nbsp; Then again, he may be for real... and I might just be jumping the gun thinking he was hitting on me. I mean, I'm seriously not the&nbsp;pretty thing&nbsp;that gets hit on tho' I do get my share of wierdoes trying to get up my skirt.&nbsp;Perhaps I looked particularly nice today, or particularly vulnerable and open to being misled. I don't know... I'm in a strange mood, feeling rather down, rather spaced out too, coz I'm running a flu and am on sleep-inducing&nbsp;medication.&nbsp; &nbsp; Getting burnt too many times... I should know better but in the face of such things, I tend to not be the strong, assertive woman people think me to be. Such things prey on my insecurities, and as much as I know I should tell him to fuck off, I end up being nice and sweet, acting like a complete idiot when alarm bells are going off in my head.

      Nailed 2 scenes for the film with  urlLink Leon  today. It was a lot easier than I had envisioned too, and we wrapped by 5pm. Was suppposed to be nice in one scene and an utter bitch in the other... guess which one I had more feel and fun with? *grin*            Kwanghan's floodlight made my dark messy bedroom look very ethereal, like a set constructed specifically for the film, clutter included.            And that's Leon &amp; Shaiful, who was our grip today. Shooting in the house is really comfortable, coz I AM right at home after all! :) The boys got to entertain themselves with my copies of cosmopolitan and glamour magazines&nbsp;in between takes.          &nbsp;  And this looks like a parody of a cosmopolitan fashion shoot... utterly hilarious! Then again, when&nbsp;one does multiple repetitions of the same scene in different takes, one tends to find the strangest things hilarious...

      The large part of the day was spent at NIE Orientation in the mammoth-sized Nanyang Auditorium. Apart from logistic information on modules, schedules, exams, grades etc, the gist of today&nbsp;was primarily:    I'm in a&nbsp;noble profession responsible for other people's lives  Don't slack off like in university, we're paying you to be there  Behave! ... at least as long as we're watching, that is...  Take this seriously or we'll make you pay us a lot of money      And that's  urlLink Justin ,&nbsp; who came equipped camera and Ishiguro for entertainment during the multitude of talks, video screenings and performances. Pleased, as always, to network and know more people in my courses, if anything for my&nbsp;' blurness ' prevention when it comes to going and signing up for this and that. Met some friends of old as well, who I was pretty surprised to meet in NIE since we're all not entering with our NUS cohort.     I&nbsp;went for RI's Symphonic Ensemble performance at the Esplanade Concert Hall. Good stuff but was primarily there because Mummy wanted&nbsp;my Dad and me&nbsp;to&nbsp;go support them with her. Always room for good live classical music in my evenings anyway.

             &nbsp;  I was pleased to make the acquaintance of this lovely cat while having dinner with the folks in Queenstown. At least I think it was Queenstown, for I was driven there and back. We popped by Ikea, the happiest place on earth, and I got me some great stuff including a super funky huge &nbsp;pink clock that now hangs suspended in the middle of my room. Love the  S$6.90  price too!&nbsp;  &nbsp;  I love cats... would have one, or two, or several if I had my way. Very intelligent,&nbsp;affectionate and sensual creatures who are graceful and awfully cute at the same time.

      I woke up at 6.30am today, and went to soak in the morning at Punggol end. I forgot how beautiful and absolutely untouched this part of Singapore so near my home. It was starkly serene, with sparkling white sand and a peaceful ambience of&nbsp;absolute quiet and tranquility.  &nbsp;          &nbsp;  This is what remains of rural Punggol as the new towns of Sengkang and Punggol 21 creep closer and closer to this quiet beach. Soon, condomiums with seafront views will engulf it all.&nbsp;   &nbsp;     &nbsp;  Kwanghan, Nanda and I also&nbsp;met bright an early as well, for a recce of Punggol Park, which we've designated for a&nbsp;film shoot for 'Joan&nbsp;&amp; Jay'.&nbsp; &nbsp;  Feels funny to have done so much all&nbsp;before 10.00am in the morning! :)&nbsp;

      "Eat less than you want to, work more than you need to, sleep well."   SM Lee   &nbsp;  PM Goh relinquishes his office on August 12th 2004, the same day new PM, Lee Hsien Loong will be sworn in at the Istana. I remember being in Australia on holiday when PM Goh was sworn in on the 28th Nov 1990 and hearing it broadcast on CNN, with immediate comment from SM Lee that he would be indeed, watching in the wings.  &nbsp;  I used to eat breakfast in the Avenue 10 market in Ang Mo Kio every Sunday before church. Lee Hsien Loong would make regular visits to the market as it was his constituency, visiting the stalls and shaking hands with the residents and shopkeepers while trailed by his entourage who would run ahead of him, prepping residents of his impending arrival.  &nbsp;  Some folks really liked it and would great him with big grins, but I used to find it more of an interruption to a nice Sunday breakfast. I remember his handshake was weak, his palm sweaty, and that he never looked us in the eye when he smiled or spoke to us.  &nbsp;  This is the son of the man who put Singapore on the world stage. What is to become of us when Daddy is no longer around? My generation will see the demise of many of&nbsp;its world leaders who have shaped modern society's political climate, including LKY. Will their children be able to hold the reins of a world in flux or will they ride straight into the Bush?

       Busy day! I only ate one proper meal today, and that was dinner. Was just too preoccupied by stuff to realise it til I sat down for dinner after mass and realised I was absolutely famished.&nbsp;        &nbsp;  Massive 'pasar malam' happening next to Hougang Mall which I reckon, is in line with upcoming National Day. I quite like wandering these makeshift street markets for odd bargains, its people and the street-style food reminscent of Malaysia. My absolute 'pasar malam' favourite from childhood happens to be the 'ang ku kueh', which is a steamed cupcake/muffin that comes in various pastel colours which I eat sans the coconut and&nbsp;orange sugar dip.  &nbsp;          &nbsp;  And that's us, deciding where to go eat after Sunset mass....&nbsp;Kenneth (who is supposed to be&nbsp;Sandra's husband and father of their tot) came up to me after&nbsp;mass asking for responsorial psalm scores, which I did not give him. Should have asked him&nbsp;how his wife was since his new girlfriend was in tow just now.&nbsp;Sandra deserves so much better than him... tsk!  &nbsp;          &nbsp;  Today was Fr Fred's last Sunset mass at Nativity... he's off to another parish and the choir had a little send-off party for him a couple of weeks back. We get Fr John Bosco Pereira in exchange for him.  &nbsp;  My 1st&nbsp;session under AWARE for the Pertapis Girl's Home seemed to go down pretty well. Was heartened to see them genuinely engaged in the workshop and I had not pitched things too high or low to get them and set them thinking. Today's workshop centred around identifying their ambitions and making them tangible. I basically know how the remaining 2 sessions will play out, now that I have a better sense of what I can do with the girls.  &nbsp;  Final class with Pasir Ris... we ended up&nbsp;playing 'Capture the Flag' and 'Charades', which was hilariously fun since the kids always cheat at 'Capture the Flag'*. The 2 classes are distinctly different, my class kids are EM1, very focused, attentive and quiet. The other class kids are EM3. Playful, very rowdy, not terribly studious and easily distracted. The other class won the game by a score of 3:1, with my geeky uptight ones indignant about how rampantly the other team had plotted to cheat and win the game. The point of playing this game as an education tool is not about winning the game, but in exploring concepts of teambuilding, thinking out of the box and yes, learning lessons about life and the fact that people are going to cheat and that one simply has to find ways to deal with it as a team.  &nbsp;   *How the game works:   2 teams with 2 clearly marked out 'countries. Each country has a 'flag', which they have to guard. Teams have to run into the other country to seize their flag and to successfully bring it back to their own country. If they get tagged while in the other country, they have to stay there as 'prisoners' til they are freed by another of their team members. Its a very exciting and fast paced game thats a lot more difficult than it sounds on paper, and its interesting to watch different age groups play it.

               Amazing that Singaporeans are flabbergasted at an out-of-the-blue 1 hour blackout, but will blissfully sit a super stuffy coffeeshop on sticky chairs at grimy tables waiting the same amount of time for a plate of supposedly famous chai tow kway on a regular basis.  &nbsp;  And I found my complete set of vocal scores from the 1997 cantata,&nbsp; which means I can make use of the hard work Audrey put in unknowingly on our behalf. Now if only everyone would come on TIME for practice... tsk! :)

      I've just been taken on board the nine11 production as its stage manager. The performance will, undoubtedly be, on the 11th of September 2004, and is a collaborative performance work between artistes representing their Catholic and Muslim faiths.  &nbsp;   Everyone must come hor! :)   &nbsp;  Quite keen to delve in and get my hands dirty in this. I haven't SMed since October (Mandala with In Source Theatre) last year... no, I'm not masochistic, I quite like stage management, different thrill from performing but exhiliarating in its own&nbsp;kooky&nbsp;way. I get an adrenaline buzz from calling a show, its all very exciting!  &nbsp;  I've got an audition for a dramatic reading in August with TNS on Tuesday. Woohoo! Projects like these are always great, short and sweet and good for my CV, networking with the&nbsp;other arts practitioners, and being right in there, alive&nbsp;in the scene where I feel most at home in.  &nbsp;  My daddy's in the process of converting the spare room in our apartment into a wine cellar for 1000 bottles of vintage wine currently&nbsp;stored in various nooks and crannies in the house. Knowing my father, this process can take anytime between a week, to longer than its taking Barcelona to complete&nbsp;its' Bascilica de Sacre Coeur.

       I will definately miss my KC girls... sigh!  &nbsp;  When teaching them, I can't help but see them as little versions of myself and the classmates I used to have at that age. Being a ex-convent girl myself, I feel nostalgic about it all, the prayers before school and recess, that they say 'Thank you and God bless you...' when they greet you, that the classes are not called 'A,B,C,etc' but 'Emerald, Mocha, Tangerine,etc'... its all so very cute! :) My pri sch classes in CLGC&nbsp;(Cooling Close Convent in Serangoon Gardens) were called 'Faith, Hope, Charity, Love and Peace' in true-blue convent style. &nbsp;              &nbsp;  And that's one of my P1 classes preparing for their year-end concert.&nbsp;     It really feels like I've closed a chapter of my life now. Teaching at KC's been awesome and I now understand what my old school song meant by, 'With you we spend our golden days happy and free'. How aptly put.

      Am tickled to find out that the funeral choir at CTK has been called the 'Lazarus Choir'! And yes, they do sound like they could possibly... wake the dead! The choir consists of well-meaning senior citizens who are available to congregate for funeral masses on weekdays, and who at the very tops of their shrill voices, will belt out old funeral favourites in a tearful, imploring manner that will bring tears to your eyes if one's affinity for the deceased hasn't already.

             New sculpture outside the Orchard MRT Station. Its entitled 'Taiji Arch' by artist Ju Ming from Taiwan. The medium is a metal alloy sculpted by a hacksaw. The artist is an avid taichi practitioner and realises its philosophy through his work.  Nice that we're trying to make Singapore more arty... now get rid of those goddamn graffitti lions! :|         I bought this, believe it or not, for S$4.50! (Don't tell my Mum!) This being from Tanglin Mall, where I met Brian for wine at Regent Hotel's bar. I had a really great time actually! :) He's working with the Brit high com, is 37, and uncannily, used to commute home from school with Dom (!) when they were in SJI coz they lived in neighboring blocks in Bukit Merah.   What IS it with me and SJI boys!? :P          And that's my friend Bernard's fish tank. Had a choir meeting at his house in Pasir Ris about the advent presentation. We're taking the cantata set I did with Fr Terence and the Lumen Christi Choir in 1997, and I'm extremely excited about bringing it back to life again! And I get to conduct it... yippee!  Bernard had a bike accident 2 weeks back... turned out to be a lot more serious than his negligent GP and Mindef doctor ascertained, and he had major shoulder surgery last week to put in a steel bolt to join his arm to his torso. Apparently did not work so they sewed it on instead (!?) Is disgruntled that he can't cycle for a while.

             My 1st rehearsal in almost 2 weeks! On my suggestion, we reblocked a scene with Nanda changing a confrontational fight to a passive aggressive quiet but intense exchange. It clicked and it feels right now. Its not easy switching between the 2 actors playing Jay, because they really are very different people, and bring different things to the character. In that way, it is definately more composite, but more challenging for me as co-actor.          And that's Nanda & Kwanghan showing each other how little they know about yoga to my utmost glee! :)         Oh, and I met Claudia for tea at Brekos Cafe across the road from Bugis Junction to talk about a Youth Choir she was excited about starting, amongst other things. Sounds like a great plan!  Had last class with Casuarina; my helter-skelter P3 class who can't keep still and who in learning to handle, I've learnt classroom management. They are sweet, warm, expressive, eager and bursting with energy, and some of their antics absolutely crack me up.

      2 years ago, I wrote the theme song for a church feast day at my ex-parish, St Anne's Church. It proved to be a rousing encore finale and amply served its purpose there. Hearing that song sung by thousands of voices was tremendous, and I knew then, that I had found a new home to serve God in. Politics at St Anne's made things less than a haven and the following year, just before that same day, the choir was kicked out of the parish. I didn't really give the song another thought til a couple of weeks ago when my choir suggested singing it this Saturday in line with the service being of the same theme as the song.   I am deeply touched to learn that they had been waiting for an appropriate occasion to include that song in the mass. A lot of people were touched by that song, and I suddenly had so many parishoners coming up to me telling me that they liked it. I had been in the parish for less than 3 months! Things didn't stop there. After the feast day, the song found its way into other parishes through members of my congregation. Someone who was there that day approached me for the score to bring home to his parish in Auckland where he is choral director. My choir had welcomed me with open arms and had enabled me to shine at a point in my life where I had been told I was unworthy of making music for God.   It was most humbling, and yet one of the highest points in my life.  It is this, that I want to empower my students to attain... I have often been filled with a burning desire to light fires in hearts and minds. How does one  teach  passion, or confidence, or inspiration when indifference reigns supreme in the adolescent mind?   Light the fire within, and everything else falls into place. Create desire within, and that person will do what it takes to achieve his desire to the best of his ability. I don't want obedient students, I want students who are alive, on their feet and fired up enough to intellectually challenge me. I want to shake them out of their passivity, make them speak out, make them fight for what they want.   I have done remarkable things merely by believing in myself and going the distance. I want to show my students that they can do the same and I wonder whether NIE will show me how to do all that.

             Frog porridge at a new eatery in Thomson Plaza. Really good stuff! Food to rival Crystal Jade at food court prices, served Hong Kong restaurant style. Can't remember name of restaurant except that it was next to BK and the sushi place.

      Just found out from Sara that Pertapis will be having an MP & CNA news crew visit the centre when I facilitate this Saturday's workshop and that she'll want to pop in for a look-see. AWARE is extremely pleased for the publicity, as am I.          The sun's not cooperating with me. Left house in bright sunshine for swim. Reached pool in cloudy weather, did my laps, got out coz it started raining, read while waiting, wanted to continue when rain stopped but end up leaving as pool was filling up with kids for their classes. I got on the bus and reached home with hot sun on my back.   Maybe the sun's better in Boon Lay :) Will have to acquaint myself better with the NTU campus to see if there's a better option to the half-olympic pool in the PE dept.

      Spoke to Antoinette who made me feel very bad about leaving them. Still, Voiceworks is ultimately a business, and they would probably terminate me without 2nd thought if it was about the bottom line.   That's the problem with freelancing; its uncertain. With no security, I would be a fool to give them precedence! I can't tie myself down because of sentimentality, no matter how nice they are or how attached I grow to the kids I teach. Yes, I have no financial responsibilities now, but when I do, I want the assurance that I can earn my worth for my qualifications, experience and skills. My parents did not send me to university and I did not study for a life this sacrificial. Yes, I am all for art and drama education, but not this way.  To stick with them and freelancing, I'd stagnate. Yes, I'd accumulate a portfolio, but in my long term goal, its not enough. I need to be qualified as an educator to be respected as one.   Bottom line, I need capital to invest in my dreams.  Speaking to Dorothy had the opposite effect. She's glad I'm chasing my dreams, understands why I have to leave... that I've been a great teacher and that I've got tremendous potential to really do stuff and not to worry about moving on. Makes me feel all warm & tingly inside. :)

      Men are exasperating creatures... torn between 3 primarily:     Specimen A  is 24, gone silent on me, and one who despite his kooky antics, I have grown very fond of. Doesn't want to date me because I don't give him a buzz. I reckon he's probably right and I really miss him because we haven't spoken for 2 weeks. Don't quite know how to get thru' to him that the silence is killing me and that I need to engage with him if I'm going to work thru' this to be friends.     Specimen B  is 27, my ex and who I have affectionately deemed the frisky cute one. We have excellent physical chemistry and genuine care and concern for each other, and he's seen me through a lot. He's oh-so-hot, and he wants to see me again, and while I *want* to, I don't know if I want to.     Specimen C  is 39, a friend of 4 years and an absolute flirt in text tho' in person absolutely prim and proper. Did not touch him before as was attached then but now we're both single and he wants to meet me for drinks and possibilities. I don't know if there are...   Leonard's right... cold turkey is probably the detox my heart needs.         The combination of a lively icq list, nocturnal friends with cars and good appetites, and the abundance of good 24hr food in the vicinity of my area had me tucking into duck mee at 2ish in the morning...

      I'm trying out a new powerful weight-loss supplement that's making me feel really strange... and hungry all the time! Its supposed to curb appetite, rev my metabolism and zap oil out of anything I do eat. So I feel strangely light-headed, my pulse is racing for no reason and I have a funny feeling in my gut.   Also did myself a slight injustice... unless in a social dining situation, I eat bran, oats or granola for meals and have given myself an annoying sore throat I must eliminate by Wednesday. Drinking a lot of water to flush out the 'heatiness'.   Please please let this work... :)

             My decision to wear my Timberland boots proved wise because NIE decided to include a mandatory stair-master fitness programme along with its other benefits. Registration was a simple process hindered by inefficient administration.          I got a couple of freebies to boot, including a 500ml nalgene bottle and a SARS toolkit (Why?). I also found the pool, canteen, art gallery, library and bookshop. The campus is actually very pretty; the atmosphere feels definately different from the particular NUS Arts Fac culture. Its quieter, elegant and the carefree college kids and sleepy-eyed hostelites in flip flops are replaced by post-grad students who will hopefully morph from eager fresh-facedness to professional educators.          Experimenting with transport routes: I left the house at 8.55am, took a 27 to Tampines and rode the green line from there to Boon Lay where I hopped on my 199 into campus. I arrived close to 10.00am. Not good. On the way home, I boarded at Boon Lay, switched to the Red line at Jurong East and rode to Woodlands where I got on a 161 into Sengkang at 5.00pm. I can fly to KL and back in the time I take to get from Sengkang to NIE. Sheesh!    Feeling wistful at the thought of having to tell Dorothy I can't teach for her anymore. Telling the kids will be even harder... its been 7 months and one can't help but grow fond of even the most hyperactive tyke.  Oh, and I saw Spiderman 2. Good stuff! I totally dig the elevator scene.

             A particularly pretty sunset over the HDB estate of Bishan.         These funky party balloons from NTUC have hilariously freudian connotations. I think I need to start doing other things with my weekends apart from wandering malls, watching movies and eating out with various groups of friends. All these malls are  exactly the same ! Same shops, same eateries... you'd think people would be sick of Breadtalk by now! Nevertheless, we loyally pop by in our bossini t-shirts and giordano jeans, charles & keith shoes, accessoried by 77th street, wearing swatch watches and munching on Old Chang Kee curry puffs wondering why Singaporeans have no creativity whatsoever!         This local franchise however, I have to admit I actually quite like. Java thats perfect for chatting over, sans the overpriciness of Starbucks.

            Each time I walk into my church compound, I never fail to be amazed at how pristine Nativity Church looks. Its gleaming white facade catches the sunlight most radiantly, and by dusk, the colours of sunsets play off it like paint upon a canvas. The lure of its sparkling white interior is its classic cruciform structure, foregrounded by its simple white walls, pillars and high ceiling that radiate warmth and a sense of tranquility.   It is definately a beautiful church.   Have been told I'm one of the few 25 year olds around with an actual long term life plan that's not imposed by scholarship bonds or parental pressure.... and who likes eating chicken feet, fish eyes and frog. Choir coffeeshop talk tends to feature our brand of non-linear logic. We missed Bert today; he had a tremendously bad cycling accident last Saturday that saw him in 7 hour shoulder surgery mid-week at Changi Hospital. Has since been discharged but requires physio-therapy for recovery.

      Met the girls and my co-facilitators of my PGH AWARE workshop series for our pilot session this morning. It was good to put real faces to the concept of the project, and it feels immediately a whole less daunting. The girls were mostly well-spoken, mannered, shy but on opening up, very eager to talk. We were warned by the PGH management of the need to maintain professional distance because the girls crave 'surrogate parents' and will lap up any affection shown to them.  Most of the girls have not completed school and have a problem getting back in. One girl stopped studying at Pri 2. Many are expelled, orphans, children of abusive parents or guardians and are in the home by circumstance. Schools don't accept them because of stigma and a consciousness of ranking.   I can't help but feel for them. Not in a 'oh, poor thing!' condescending way, but in the way that I want to get to know them, befriend them, love them... make a difference in their lives. I felt the same way when I met the Marymount Girls Home orphans. I wish I could do something for them that won't be merely token to make  me  feel good for doing a good deed. I could volunteer at these places, but it doesn't solve things at all; they don't need another weekly visit by people with pity and charity in their hearts, they need real friends and they deserve to experience real love.

             Have found holding choir practice in a round more effective when working on SATB arrangements... makes them more aware of harmony. I'm currently teaching them a bit of theory & solfege as well so I can eventually do more with them. Varying age groups, levels of exposure & musical knowledge make working with them rather challenging, but at the same time, very rewarding.         Discovered new curry rice place that's better than the 'Midnight Curry Rice' the choir always goes to. Also on the Upper Serangoon Simon Road stretch of food places near Kovan MRT. This is a group that absolutely loves to eat! :)

             That's my co-facilitator, Faustina. She is of the opinion that the photo captures the very expression of a lizard getting run over by a lorry. We drama people are very... drama. :)  Leading 7 groups of 40 7&8 yr olds to perform 7 different items for year-end concert at KC in November, and 1 group of 20 9 yr olds at Casuarina for another concert item middle of next month. Unlike my co-teachers, I find all this quite a breeze... performance is my element and I've seen too many of the worst stage management crises to be immune to the bulk of performance anxiety triggers.   Theatre thrills me and no matter how much of it I do...

      I've just confirmed that I'll be facilitating 4 workshops at the Pertapis Girls Home for  urlLink AWARE  starting in a fortnight. The workshops inculcate skills in creative self-expression, oral communication and presentation skills, and drama and I'll be working with 20 teenage girls aged 13 - 17yrs on Saturday mornings thru' July and August. These girls come from problematic backgrounds, and live in at PGS.  I'm incredibly excited about this! I'll be using theatre to help these girls address issues that matter, I can give them a voice and an medium for catharsis... this is the  very reason  why I do art.   Yes its voluntary, but I believe its well worth my time and energy because I believe fervently in feminism and in education through the arts. It is also portfolio and experience building for me in my long-term plan to start an company/organisation that will use arts as a means of education and outreach.

      I really liked  urlLink Morgan Spurlock's   urlLink 'Super Size Me' . American obesity is horrific... the film proved to drive home what I gleaned from perusing Eric Schlosser's 'Fast Food Nation', and seeing first hand, the gluttony of Americans on a luxury cruise with unlimited food.   Spurlock's film was of the low-budget, indie, DV variety shot documentary-reality style. Moving shots tended to pixilate, making it hard on the eyes. Still, it was captivating and definately worth my wait.

Then again, I can't feasibly see myself living anywhere else and being truly at home. I have a love-hate relationship with my national identity, I rant, and gripe like any other Singaporean, but let any foreigner insinuate anything remotely negative about my island and I will be the first to set them right.

      Aye... now I feel guilty, he IS a dear friend after all.   Casting stones seemed the better thing to do rather than tying stones around one's ankles and jumping headlong into deep waters. Still, Gerard and Claudia are right, he  really  doesn't deserve my wrath.   My mom tells me I  always  presuppose everyone else has ulterior motives and I really have to stop thinking the worst of people. She also tells me I pin blame on everyone but myself and that I am ace at playing the guilt-trip game when things don't go my way. Spoilt brat syndrome?  I wish I could apologise, but we're on a time-out.   I sometimes think I possess the emotional maturity of a teenager. I don't always make the best decisions in behaviour, and I should be the last person to cast stones.

           Dinnered with Gerard today at Plaza Sing's Bakers Inn this evening. Always enjoyable, and the conversation's so wonderfully bitchy it sizzles with utter finesse. I like that with him, we can pick up right where we left off, even if we haven't seen each other in weeks or even months.   Talking to him makes me realise how far we've come from college days. Conversations that comprised academic musings or bitching about lectures have become rantings about work. We're all growing up, forced to be adults because our age stipulates it.

             I'm enjoying a shortlived tai tai lifestyle for this and next week. I'm living it up and going out, meeting friends, clubbing, movie-watching, cafe-hopping, attending gatherings and events and having a pretty good time by keeping a busy social schedule.   It is exactly a year from quitting the corporate life, that I embark on my civil service adventures. I wonder if this year of exploring my artistic aspirations has mellowed me, or unleashed the rebellious wild child in me.   Everything from here on feels like its geared towards the year's end. Plans for Christmas, for year end performances and events, for christmas choir involvments, for gatherings, projects, trips abroad... it feels like 2004's gone by in a whoosh! I want to do everything, but I know I can't, and making choices is always hard when you really want to do is get away with doing it all.

            I had a cantor training session tonight. Christmas preparations commence officially on Thursday when the core group meets to discuss the Cantata we're spearheading. The next 6 months of 2004 are pretty much in the bag for me and I like having things all planned out. Control freak? :)  Toggling between scalding hate and wistful sentimentality all at once that I feel utterly confused and unable to act in any coherent manner. I frighten myself sometimes and I don't trust myself when I'm like this. I'm scary when I'm angry...   Is sentimentality a good basis for friendship? I did walk away from friendships of 10 years to preserve my sanity and to praise God again and I painfully learnt that not all those friendships stood the test of time. I'm glad for my circle of friends... people I can trust, who are there when I need them, and who can make me laugh... who knock me on the head when I've done silly stuff, and who can meet me on my wavelength and understand why I do the things I do, as silly or outrageous or mundane as they are.  If only I were lucky in love, as well... then again, life is fair.

      I believe I'm acquainted with Singapore's equivalant of Frasier and Niles...   Still feeling bloody upset, but thankfully better.   Was in a place where someone who means the world to me has very little regard for me. How can the knowledge of that not get one down? We are entirely impossible and all I can do is sit down and cry because all possible causes of action have been exhausted and there is nothing left to do.

            After waking up really late for a meeting with Sara about an AWARE project I'm involved in, I met Claudia for lunch at Plaza Sing, had sushi from a sushi train, then very sinful chocolate cake at Secret Recipe. T'was basically a very laid back afternoon... been a traumatic weekend for me, but one that I was getting over, and getting some semblance of sanity back to my so-called-life.          I met David for dinner at Taglio in Wisma, and then drinks at the very posh Living Room with Justin and Leonard. Would have indulged in more alcohol if not for cash constraints imposed by wanton spending spree in the US on my Alaska trip last month. Sat in a Jalan Kayu prata place with Leonard chatting til the wee hours of the morning over prata and comforting cups of teh tarik.  Felt appeased for the company... Sleeping off things was a good remedy, and I feel ready to face people and situations again. Yes, still wounded, yes, will take time to get over lost love, but I think I'll get by.   I did not tell Leon about the absolute panic that settled in when we decided to give the relationship a go, and a part of me is perhaps relieved that things are as they are. I don't think my feelings are any less true in admitting that, but the truth of the matter is, I'm fucking afraid of falling in love, especially when I've been hurt by so many. I'm afraid to trust, and I guess, I'm not as grown up as I like to think I am. I've decided that he was right, that I am not meant for him, nor he for me, at least in the romantic sense. I guess I'm too stubborn for my own good, or just too full of pride to accept rejection or defeat. Damn my hungry ego! :)

      I find my weekends more hectic than my weekdays, such that I actually get that TGIF feeling on Sunday night when Monday's on the way. The last 2 days have gone by in a blur of a lot of activity, and not enough sleep.   The Parish Pastoral Council (PPC) is forming up as the new system of organisation within current parish structure, making things community-centered as opposed to 'top-down regiment'. The concept of ministry is no longer supposed to be that of volunteerism, but that of owed servitude as children of God and the responsibility of the baptised. The PPC is imposed in all Catholic churches by rule of the archdioscese and all parishes are to implement the council by the end of 2004. I don't know if it'll really effect any change in things on the ground level, but it makes a difference to those of us who have to work closely with the parish council as leaders of the ministries, when it comes to getting things done.

      My attitude in the past couple of days has been that of utter 'bo-chup'ness... I can't think of a better word to describe this utter blaze take I have on the stuff that comes my way. Funny, I'm normally easily excitable and raring to go.  I feel unchallenged. I'm not entirely engaged in what I'm doing right now and I'm too exhausted from long hours to really do stuff apart from it without hindering my ability to concentrate on what I have prioritised. So many things I want to do... if anything, breaking off from the Arts scene for now has shown me the multitude of people I have yet to meet and things I have yet to do in my life that has, for the most part, been unhealthily one-track minded.

      An uneventful Saturday seems the best way to wind down a hectic week. 2 scenes to shoot bright an early tomorrow, and then perhaps I'll pop by the beach to soak in the sun.  Choir had a little gathering to celebrate its 1st year Anniversary, which was a simple little do with the members on church premises. Left early coz my eyes were starting to hurt from sleep deprivation. Had the option of joining friends for late night drinks but declined in lieu of my alarm clock going off at 6.00am. Film shoots on hangovers in past experience, are the most agonising things to live thru'...  Dad is watching Kill Bill 2 in the hall with the sound turned up. Bah...

      Yes I am Catholic. No I do not subscribe to evey single edict of my faith or feel the need to justify my personal choices. I believe in a personal relationship with God. He understands me, and why I do the things I do, or don't do the things I do. I will go to church as long as it has meaning to me. I am no Sunday Catholic. I am ministry, and that puts me under greater scrutiny than most in my parish community, but as long as I am upfront with myself and true to my calling, I will call myself 'Catholic'. I am not Catholic because I have to be... I don't have to be. I want to be because of what I derive from the faith and in return, what I can give it. I see the church as an entity almost divorced from God. Churches are run by people, and are fallible and bent on tradition and regulation. Yes, we all go to church 'to see God'... but I think the two entities are at times, almost autonomous of each other and it is idealistic to think that an organisation bent on hierarchy, constitution and rigidity can ever be entirely, a manifestation of God's love which in itself, is unbounded and undefinable in its immensity.   The concept of sin foregrounds guilt in the Catholic psyche. We are raised with emotional blackmail and in turn, instill guilt in those we influence. Guilt plays a major role in church politics and issues of rivalry soon turn into issues of 'morality', when they are nothing at all concerned with Christian ethics. It is why I often get utterly put off by such nitty gritty, but they are obstacles that one can overcome simply by divorcing one's own knack for succumbing to all-encompassing guilt.   My social circle is predominantly Catholic, particularly due to being the product of mission schools, that I am involved in ministry, and because I am artistically inclined and prefer that my friends be so too. In that I am cloistered. Up to the age of 16, people were either Catholic, or non-Catholic. Leaving the faith, has never been something I've seriously thought about. It is so much a part of me that I would feel that something was missing if I did walk out.   No, it is not why I am still there.

      Got paid by MOE on Thursday, my Voiceworks cheque arrived today, and I have a couple smaller cheques for miscellaneous involvement in the post... life is good! :) I think financial independance matters to my self-esteem and my spirits have recieved a much needed boost.  A hilarious incident of missing socks has impressed on me the need to clear up the chaos of my bedroom of precariously piled clutter. I believe springcleaning will help me locate several other objects that have been swallowed up in the abyss. I don't spend a tremendous amount of time at home, much less in my room and clutter doesn't so much get to me as it does to most people. I like having things where I can see them. When I keep things up, I tend to forget I have them...

             These blocks are going to be torn down at the end of the month. If you're familiar with the Punggol area you'll know that these blocks have been standing along Punggol Road before Sengkang and Hougang existed, its people previously relocated from the Punggol kampungs.

      Woohoo! I am finally connected to the wireless network on campus! :) That such things make me happy just shows you how much of a geek I am... that I have logged on to blog it, shows I am beyond salvation! *grin* No Lit class this morning, tutor is on MC. Bah... meaning I braved rush hour traffic for nothing, but that's fine because I've got the INTERNET! Hahahaha!

             Thank God its Friday... at least! :)  I toggle between bliss and frenzy a lot these days. My highs and lows have increased in extremity of late; and there are also more interim periods of utter disinterest in everything and when I just want to bury myself in my sheets and sleep. That I go through these highs and lows in the span of a single day is not a good sign.

             Did anyone notice that Mrs LHL was horridly dressed in an ah-soh batik pyjamas outfit to her husband's big day? Despite the grandeur of the ceremony, everyone looked sloppy despite their nice outfits, and the chairs seem to have been placed too near each other for they all looked squashed together and terribly uncomfortable.   I'm not into politics. If I felt I could make a difference through my efforts, I would make the effort to champion my causes. My take on current affairs is a pretty blaze one. I don't bother them, and they don't bother me. If the day comes when my toes are stepped upon, I will go out of my way to bother them. Til then, I'm happy to let life evolve around my own little personal sphere, making small differences where I see fit. I do things in a big way these days... none of that small time crap for me. I'm either head over heels in something, or not at all. I believe my time is better spent that way.  Feminists say, that the personal is political. The way I live my life is in essence, my political statement, by the choices I make, democratic or otherwise. There are causes I feel for, but which I do not go all out to champion because I know I will effect little change.

      Today makes for a gloriously lazy afternoon... Ceramics class is off this week due to Hasan being out of Singapore for an exhibition, and I got to while away the time with Monty Python and 'The Holy Grail'... utterly hilarious! :) Daddy bought a new DVD player that does a multitude of things from jpeg scrolling to mp3 playing, tho' I've been using it a heck lot more than he has.  Meeting Faustie last night was great! We seldom get to really sit down to chat since we're always seeing each other before or after classes, and I think we both enjoyed the catharsis of comiseration... well that and she's an absolute riot! I reckon I will see more of her more than a few times. I find myself gelling better with friends who come from no particular sphere of my life : floaty friends, if you'd like.   And I've got art homework due tomorrow which I've procrastinated doing til tonight, and which I may well procrastinate doing til the break before the art class tomorrow afternoon. Oh, and feeling remotely gleeful since MOE has paid me! :) Woohoo!   Judging from the number of exuberant smses that arrived close to midnight, I reckon my friends and I will, as a team, boost the retail sector this weekend! :)

      Pleased to realise that they don't really pick up on how we dress for classes despite the countless notices on dress code adorning the campus walls. Also realise that everyone's getting increasingly casual as the days go by, and the flip-flops, midriff baring tops and sarongs have all come out of hiding. *grin*  I find myself increasingly retrospective towards the end of the year, and I've realised its to be my annual cycle of psychological state. Realising it makes me more aware of what happens in my head and less prone to being truly affected by the strangeness of my moods. I think tho' that I am growing increasingly numb to the nagging need I used to feel, to be emotionally tied to other people.  And today, I don't feel old. :)

      I know I'm easing into school mode when I find myself constantly bumping into newly-acquainted friends as I make my way around campus. I've realised how reclusive the corporate working world makes one, since there's not a lot of opportunities to really socialise when one has to maintain the semblance of a professional front.   To clear space on my desk and in my room, I am giving my old computer to ACRES and my pda to Leonard now that they are no longer of use to me and will be attain new leases of life with new owners rather than gathering dust in my spare room. Doubt I'll be able to go to Cambodia with ACRES tho', but I'll help where I can. I'm admittedly not terribly fanatical about animal conservation, but I want to do stuff apart from drama and music, since I can afford to devote my time to charitable causes now that I'm not so self-reliant on projects for income.   I must be exceedingly blur for my lack of sleep... I took bus 30 to Teban Gardens yesterday, not realising it was uni-directional and ended up busing back when I found myself passing NUS's Fong Seng's. Same thing happened again this morning when I took bus 143 in the wrong direction. Bah! I shall have to get used to orientating myself around my new secondary residence.

      Am incredibly pissed with the NIE IT people who won't set up my ibook for the school wireless network because its a mac.  Am supposed to download software and install it myself, but how the hell am i supposed to do that when I have no network? Am sitting in coffeebean at Jurong point hoping to get the email out and may well end up sitting here again early tomorrow morning before classes so that I can download what I need to get online. Bah! :(  Spent most of my long break today first with Joshua, Raphael and Pamela for our Literature project discussion, then Len dropped by NIE and kept me company til Joshua finished his *other* project group meeting to meet me to discuss our presentation for next week. Seems like everyone's got a flurry of group meetings and deadlines, and we're all frazzled for it.

      Despite being constantly surrounded by people all the time I feel immensely lonely. I don't really have a 'best friend' per se, but rather, several who I update every now and then, on the happenings in my melodramatic life but who are detached from me, and its not their fault or mine, because we all have our own busy lives to get on with. There are times when I'm bursting with news, joy, anger or sadness, and I scroll thru' my cellphone's phonebook, undecided as to who I can talk to, who will listen to me and reciprocate, or give me council, or just listen.   I wish I was in love sometimes... but I don't know who with. I am socially selective, and there are many people I dislike upon sight or upon speaking to. My social circle consists mainly of off-beat folks with individualistic personalities, who speak well, who carry themselves with confidence and who are point blank honest in their unique opinions and choice of lifestyle. They are also normally artistic, tempermental and I guess, the sort that in feeling for, I often end up getting hurt because they themselves are, like me, time bombs waiting to explode.   I do not want to get hurt by other people's problems.  I fear I will be away from home for the next 3 days. The commute is simply too tedious and I will put up at my temporary residence at Teban Gardens to ease the journey until Thursday morning.

      Happy National Day, to the patriotic and non-patriotic alike! :)         I am gladly resolved to frugality til my 1st paycheck from NIE because I'm typing this entry up with my new G4 ibook connected to the net by wireless bb access.  I'm forcing myself to take a mental time out, and to think about the things that I need to get ship-shape. Primarily, refining my long-term plans for greater clarity of vision. I fear I tend to regress into these moments of self-doubt and questioning every now and then. Depression follows suit when I feel less than accomplished, because I always feel I haven't done enough even when sitting down and rationalising that things couldn't have gone any other way.

      I'm feeling woozy. Did a hour-long shoot involving me riding this contraption that suspends me upside down by my ankles. Its supposed to be a spine-aligner, and its pretty fun to rock on, except of course, that I now have a funny floaty feeling.

             We cleared 3 indoor shoots and 1 outdoor shoot in the course of today. Am feeling majorly accomplished, as is Nanda. We are getting somewhere... finally! :)  Oh, and I'm absolutely gleeful... I'm going laptop shopping tomorrow, have decided that I shall indeed invest in the G4 i-book. The folks are coming with me, and it'll be an afternoon on the town since Dad really wants to watch the National Day Parade in the evening. I figure it will encompass all the little gadgets I'm thinking of getting, like a new PDA, a mp3 player etc... figured I might as well make 1 lum sum investment in a cool new toy that can do everything rather than seperate things over the course of the year which will probably end up costing about the same and doing a heck lot less.  The house we're using for the shoot's in Peggy's side of AMK. I seldom venture into the old estate these days, no reason to, I guess, plus I don't miss it all that much anyway.

               This particular shoot has been a long time coming, because of conflicting schedules. It was generally a long drawn out affair, since Gollum does work rather fluidly. We started at 7am and ended round about noon. I had a quick lunch with Nanda at 401 while Gollum packed himself off to this evening's venue with his tonne of equipment.  We are, essentially, doing him a favor by participating in this film, and while he is not beholden to us for that, he could be a lot nicer, and I could be a lot less nice, since I realise I have been foolishly accomodating in this. Well, I learn as I go along... I am at least glad to be able to say that I have acted in a lead role in a feature film. Whether I do it again, I don't know, and I don't particularly have ambitions to do so anymore.

             I fear I am one again in a deeply troubled state. Stumbling thru' mass half-dazed. Talking to Len all night in an attempt to make sense of my strange low didn't so much dissipate it as increase my melancholy... Battling with lots of stuff, my new identity as an educator, albeit in the making, with being 'employed' an accountable to someone else who CAN force me to do things if they so please, having to exercise patience and discipline in seeing myself thru' to my long-term ambitions, feeling lost and alone in a world that defines your worth based on attractiveness and status, and the fact that I simply don't have it together, as much as I'd like to think.   I get these down times, completely inexplicable but simply overwhelming and which put me in a frame of mind where I am unable to concentrate on anything. I am deeply distracted, but by no one thing in particular. I want to just do nothing... I'm not particularly depressed, in fact, I feel more like I have a burning hunger I cannot distract myself from, and that I don't know what it is I hunger for.   I feel very invisible. My greatest fear is that I will lead an insignificant and forgettable life. I am capable of making a name for myself, if not in history, then at least in the hearts of a good many who I will cross paths with. I tend to think more of people than people think of me, literally and figuratively. I am too sentimental... I tend to forget the rest of the world isn't.   I have a free afternoon tomorrow after Tai Chi, which I intend of making full use of tomorrow, to be still. To reflect, meditate, if I so choose... My primary concern is to get myself in the right frame of mind, to focus.   There is too much at stake to not do so.

      My NIE coursemates (non-artsy ones too) tend to be  slightly  more articulate than the normal fare. I guess because those who veer towards teaching as choice career tend to be comfortable speaking up. Good! I always want to create a ruckus and to rile lecturers up when people are submissive and non-opinionated.  And you know its a different campus culture when you have NIE students who are married and with children bringing their families with them on campus on Saturday mornings... saw quite a few about as I was having a mid-morning coffee break with 'Uncle' Fu, Santha and Su-Ann... who I today realised was in my Anthropology tutorial 2 years ago (hence the vague familarity we both sensed when we 1st met)... oh, and who is also Catholic and an ex-IJ girl.

      Excruciating art lesson today reminded me how absolutely out of touch I am with drawing. Its been about 6 years since I did any, seriously... I am in dire need of practice!   Getting to know my art classmates is fun, and had a chat with Yi Lin on the MRT on my way to Bishan after classes. She studied art in London on the MOE scholarship, and specialised in digital video and photography. I like the diversity in this class... we also have a converted architect, and lots of folks with foreign Uni art degrees all with very diverse backgrounds, specific areas of interest in the arts, and ages.   Justin on the other hand... cracks me up with his artsy antics...          Feeling a bit out of it, where church is concerned. I get these spiritually low phases every now and then that come and go. Part and parcel of the whole church ministry thing... I guess its mostly because I feel tired.   And guess what!? Fr Richard's paid Fr Tay a visit and said something about the choir that was not nice at all. We are immensely pissed off, understandably. That man is vengeful, bitter and petty, and not someone who deserves my respect at all.   And speaking of being haunted by wierdoes... I bumped into Ibrahim from my Theatre Studies class in NUS, who is seriously repressed and off his rocker in so many not-so-wonderful ways. I shall always remember Ibrahim for his glorious rendition of 3 Fat Virgins in my Year 1 Practical Exam which made Dr Seet shriek with horror! It became the stuff of urban legends in NUS (along with the existence of Chinese Camp).  My 1st proper week at NIE's almost over, and I feel absolutely drained! Its the long days, the hours of sitting in MRT carraiges, the heaps of assignments I will soon have to get cracking on... the fact that campus is in the back of beyond, and that it takes energy to be perky and friendly to everyone when I sometimes feel like stoning in a corner and switching off. I reckon its just me needing to settle into the routine and lifestyle.

      I'm starting to get used to these gloriously long days...  Popped by Jurong Point with new friend from Art class, Santha to get the necessary stuff for the afternoon's ceramics class... which was loads of fun, but helluva messy! :)          The last time I handled clay was 10 years ago when I did ceramics for my O' level exams. Anyway, I made that in class... 4 hollow spheres made thru' the method of 'pinching'. It literally means shaping the clay with hands and fingers and is an age-old reliable technique that Ng Eng Teng is famous for. Hassan called him 'Singapore's greatest pincher' but I fear that has other connotations ;)  And Riza is hilarious! :) Very PE teacher to the core! I realise this is my 1st time with an actual Art class. I've always studied it on my own, with Uncle John and then my solo classes with Nellie because of my subject combi. This is really cool... I love the class dynamics! :)         I knew this would not be a good evening at the symphony when I saw groups of teenagers outside the VCH taking photos and being ... teenagerish. The orchestra and choir was at best, clumsy, and unrealised in potential. Still, was there to support a friend who had given me tickets, and I dragged Amery along to join in my agony.   My silly choir mate thought that Victoria Concert Hall was located on Victoria Street and mistakenly alighted at Bugis MRT to realise that it was a good deal off. I was still laughing by the time he rectified his transport decision...   T'was relieved of enduring the agony to the end by a message from Len that he was in the area, and we wound up kopi-ing at 401 since we reside in pretty much the same vincinity. Was duly informed by kopi woman with big grin that my regular kopi choir group had been there just a while before I left... Apparently she thinks I'm Elvie's sister, which is hilarious since we are not at all related or alike. Yes, I knew they were there... meeting with Fr Tay about whether the cantata I proposed would be approved and executed. Yes it will, and I have 2 months to make magic happen.

      I asked the girls to write or draw about when they felt angry, hurt or sad and when they felt trapped. I spent this evening looking at what they had done, and their papers  seem to cry out with so much sadness, rage and anger that I feel overwhelmed. That what is written or drawn here only scratches the surface, gets to me even more.  This girl, aged 17, is in the home because she was living with a non-local man who gave her refuge and love after she ran away from an abusive home:    "You're only nine or ten, and you wake up to find the living room in a mess. The tables and furniture are oveturned. Broken porcelain everywhere and there are shattered glasses beneath your feet. I went to school with bruises and the logo of a belt buckle on my back. My hair was pulled and cut haphazardly due to someone else's rage. My mother told me she would pray to God to take my life away. I was then 'living in sin'. I have not committed any crime. No reason for me to be here!!!"    In all my experience as a drama educator, I have never met a group more intent on opening up and learning to make sense of life. These girls are hungry for affection and attention, and it shows in their eagerness to interact, in and out of workshops, and I have to consciously detach myself from feeling too much from them for I need to maintain professional distance.  I know a lot of my coursemates are eager to jump into top schools. I wonder if I will feel more fulfilled working with those at the other end of the scale. If my long-term goal is indeed, to work my plan of starting a drama-in-education company to run my brand of workshops, then my experience would be better gleaned from the kids with issues, who are defiant and frustrated and fed up with life. If I can learn to handle them, I can handle anyone, and be better-equipped for it.  I am not in NIE merely to be a school teacher. Being a teacher is to me, training ground for what I want to do subsequently. After the Pertapis workshops, I know more than ever, that this is really what I want to do... and that it will be worth the journey getting there, even if it will take the next 10 years of my life.

      Alan C. Purves writes:      "Literature is a complex and artistic use of words that stimulates readers' imaginations. Reading and studying Literature should make readers aware of the beauty and power of the language, and the richness of the cultural heritage from all parts of the world. Literature has the ability to take readers out of their world and into other worlds, to make them laugh or cry, to challenge their beliefs, to make them wonder...      Literature and its teaching should offer our students intellectual challenges such as how they interpret and evaluate words and language and poetry. Literature and its teaching should bring our students the pleasures of emotion and of the mind. Literature and its teaching should open our students to the beauty of words and expression and ideas."    Pedagogy is terribly idealistic. All of us in my Lit class seem to share one main concern... that we while we love literature, we have absolutely no idea how to impart a similiar enthusiasm for Literature given that many of our students may well be struggling with the basics of the English Language, that they are completed honed in exam-smarts and will hate anything as undecided as Literature where there are no 'model answers', and that we are bound by a syllabus that may make achieving the aforementioned ideas, a tad difficult.  We told our Lit tutor today, to simply cut to the chase. We did not want to go through sessions expounding ideals in teaching literature. We presented classroom scenarios from our shared experiences and talked about them instead. We spoke up, because if we didn't do so now, we would be let loose on an unsuspecting world, still clueless about what to do, or say, or think... while young minds would be thrust in our hands for us to do something about.  On hindsight, I reckon she was a bit miffed at not being able to execute her lesson as planned... but it will be our heads on the chopping board if we turn up clueless at Practicum.

             I watched 'Ella Enchanted' with Nanda at Jurong Point over my ridiculously long break. Had my ridiculously simple 'Using English in the Classroom' session, which consisted of me being taught the stuff I was teaching the kids thru' Voiceworks. All the phonetics and intonations, and voice projection etc... Piece of cake!          As mentioned, spent night at Uncle's house in Teban Gardens after having a gossipy dinner with Justin at a Japanese restaurant called 'Hoishi' in IMM. Trip to school next morning was relatively OK, except that upon arrival, I was floored by major major cramps, which took a bloody long while to subside. Absolutely horrid! I hate that time of the month for this especially... and how naughty I've been during the month somehow seems to correspond directly with how bad my cramps are! :(         Meanwhile, incidentally reunited with 'Joshua of Sengkang', who's in 4 of my classes every week and currently in 2 of my group projects.

      I found the nice shiny computer lab! Woohoo! :) Have internet, can gladly stay on campus for long hours...  Had 1st session on 'Teaching Art in Secondary Schools' this morning. Discussions got interesting in challenging the way (1) MOE selected those of us who wanted to teach art (2) Those who want to study/teach art but who were not chosen for certain reasons (3) AEP schools being not too easy to get into (4) Art teachers hating art. The class is reasonably animated, gutsy and expressive, as are most artsy folk. I for one am all up for spontaneous debates... so yippee!  Am quite settling into campus life... feels incredibly good but am apprehensive of how well I'd cope because it has been 2 years and university, my A Levels and school feels far far away.

      Am bunking over at Uncle's place tomorrow in Teban Gardens. Its not terribly near NTU, but its nearer than bloody Sengkang and he's putting me up for free on nights when I end late and need to be up in campus early the following morning.

             I dragged myself out of bed this soggy morning, braved the persistent drizzle to get myself to the NIE campus for my 1st official week of classes. After 2 years, it feels wierd being in a classroom again as a student, having stood in front of classrooms since then, as a teacher or facilitator myself.  Made 3 new friends in Lit so far: Pamela, Felicia and Raphael, and found dear Joshua from NUS Lit days in my tutorial group too! :) We already have our assignments for the rest of our semester laid out for us. Its kinda' good that we know exactly what the workload is, and after working my ass off in the private sector, I'd gladly do assignments and sit in classes and get paid to do so.   I have 1 more workshop to facilitate for AWARE's programme at Pertapis. I wonder whether, a month on in immersing myself in pedagogy and what-nots, whether my approach will be any different from the 3 sessions I completed as of last Saturday. As an 'educator' left to my own devices, I've found myself constantly innovating, picking up things from observation, experience and my own reading and research. As much as I see my charges develop, so do I see my own teaching style emerge and evolve; partly from trial and error and partly from playing off my students the same way I'd play off my audience as an thespian.          The schedule for the remaining film shoots is more or less concretised and it really does look like we will be done by the end of August... if not by the week after National Day. Nanda and I are in arms in pushing things along as quickly as possible. Working with Gollum has been getting increasingly ... trying. He plays the emotional blackmail card on me, and it gets to me that he does give me a lot of flak I do not deserve. Our tempers have been getting the better of us these past few weeks especially, since overly-prolonged production time has induced shorter fuses in us both.   Ugh! I feel like it can't be soon enough... I'm very weary in this. :/

      I've been in a strange mood all weekend... Various things coming to a head. Idle week has *not* been idle! I wince at the workload I will undertake in subsequent weeks, but thats work, its tangible and can be handled with appropriate method and practice. I can handle that...  Its people I never know how to handle. Those who say one thing and do another, those who are like still waters that run deep, those that misunderstand me, those I misunderstand, those with problems I have to overcome to work with, those who are untouchable, those who malign me, those who unknowingly hurt me, those who I unknowingly hurt... People are never textbook cases of black or white, or predictable or readable in any sense. One can never really 'know' another, but only predict his/her actions more accurately over proximity of contact.   Sometimes a time out is the best thing. But sometimes friendships that take a time out for too long dissolve into nothingness, eroded away by time. I am in a strange place, not in love, not in pain, not angered or upset. I simply can't put my finger on it and I don't think I even want to try... definitions have gotten me no where.   Impatience is my Achille's heel. I trust too quickly, I tell too much. I submit all too willingly. I think my friends know more about me that I them. That's not always a good thing, since I'm not the best judge of people at all.

             Family dinner at Shima Restaurant at Goodwood Park Hotel to celebrate my Mom's 50th. They specialise in teppanyaki and at $88.00++ per person, your party gets its' own friendly cleaver-wielding chef cooking up a storm as much for your entertainment as for your appetite. Meal comes with free-flow salmon sashimi and soft-shell crab. Very nice indeed...

      Today is the Feast of St Anne, and I dropped by the old parish for its 'anniversary' mass in the late morning particularly to partake of the celebrations and to use the funfair tickets my friends purchased and passed to me since I live near the church.  To the less initiated, St Anne is the mother of Mary, mother of Christ. Some of us affectionally call her 'Ah Mah' in true Singaporean-fashion. There is an old English prayer that goes, 'St Anne, send me a man!', and she is accoladed as the Catholic intercessor for the needs of women.
