      My life is usually pretty dull, but today I feel like the Crocodile Hunter.   I was on the last half mile of my morning bike ride in Cherry Creek Park, when I heard a "Hisss...rattle" from directly under my right pedal.  I screeched to a stop and whipped around, thinking "That couldn't be a rattler!"  Yep, a tan and brown prairie rattlesnake, and quite a little beauty.  I'm guessing a 4-footer, though its hard to tell when they're coiled up and "grumpy".  Thick-bodied and healthy, too.  Apparently, he was getting ready to come out of the weeds and cross the path when I zoomed by and nearly smushed him.   What do you do when there is a pissed off rattler sitting on the edge of a very busy bike trail?  Either he's going to get hit, or someone's going to get bitten, or both.  Danger, danger, danger!  I got a long, brushy stick and tried to encourage him to go back into the weeds, but he wasn't having any of that.   So I tossed the stick on top of him.  It didn't improve his mood, but I figured that people would dodge the plant and miss the snake as well.   Pedalled back to the condo and excitedly relayed this to Scott, since neither of us has ever seen a wild rattler.  On the off chance that the snake was still there, Scott and I biked back down the trail.  About halfway to the rattler site, I had to slam on the brakes to avoid running over a big bullsnake, who had stretched out for a nice sunbath in the middle of the trail.  Several other bikers pulled up, and we shooed the snake into the brush.  It was pretty mellow for a bullsnake, as it barely made a fuss when I stroked its tail.  Sadly, the rattler had disappeared by the time we got there, so Scott still needs to see one in the wild.  He was happy about the bullsnake, though.   No pictures, though.  From now on, I take the camera when I run or bike.  To round out my snake day, I thawed out a big, fat mouse and fed it to Little Girl.  She gobbled it right down, so I regretted having only thawed one.  Maybe she just doesn't like wet fur, which is what she usually gets (quick thaw in warm water.)

      My parents do even stranger things than I do.  I called Mom today just to say "hi", and caught her as she was preparing for an emergency trip to Canada.  No, not for prescription drugs.  Dad is presenting a paper at a conference in London, Ontario and left just a few hours before I called.  Turns out that he left the presentation poster at home.  Mom freaked out and was getting ready to drive it up to him.  She said she had her passport and the dog's vaccination papers, and...  Me:  Mom, you aren't taking the dog to Canada.  What if they quarantine her at the border?  Or refuse to let you cross? Mom:  Oh, I guess she could stay alone.  It's a 4 hour drive each way. Me:  Can you call Dad to let him know you're coming? Mom:  No, neither of us have cell phones and he didn't have a number for the dorm he's staying in.  He was going to call me with a number when he got there. Me:  Do you know where you are going?  You have a specific address? Mom:  Well, Mapquest wasn't very helpful, but I do know the name of the town, the university, and the dorm, so I should be able to ask for directions. Me:  What if Dad calls for you at home? Mom:  I'll change the answering machine message so that he knows I'm on my way, and that he should call you.  About an hour later, Dad calls me.  He arrived at the dorm, realized that he didn't have the poster, called home, and got the answering machine.  Dad says that he doesn't need the poster until Tuesday and that it could have gone FedEx, but Mom didn't know that.  Dad gave me the phone number for the dorm lobby (the rooms don't have phones) in case she called me back.  I'm still waiting to hear back from somebody on how this turned out.  It's now 9:30 pm EDT, so Mom should be in London.  No call from anybody.  Moral of the story:  I'm going to get TracPhones for my parents.  I have a cell phone specifically for situations like this, they need at least one, too.  Or else I'm gonna be tearing my hair out when they are actually old!  At least Dad didn't realize that the poster was missing during the trip.  I had visions of him turning around, and the two of them passing each other in Niagara Falls or something.

      I've tried to be creative with my passwords, since it seems like I have a zillion of them.  I have a special secret notebook just for accounts, logins and passwords.  But I forgot one important fact:  I'm a lousy typist.  I had changed my blog passwords to "LestatBites!", thinking that it would be easy to remember but hard to crack.  Unfortunately, I can't seem to type that sequence of characters unless I can see the words.  After being unable to log into my own account, I had to re-think and change it again.    I've come up with a great way to randomly select a password.  Open a blank word processing file, and just type several comfortable letters with each hand.  Don't look at the screen until you are done.  Next, look at your selections, and see if you can rapidly type the same thing over again without looking at the keyboard.  Bingo - new password.  Unless you are a REALLY cruddy typist and your password is fffjjj.

      My former student/doctor friend Brenda sent me a CNN article on a guy who is over 1000 pounds who has recently been hospitalized, and is finally losing weight.  Whenever I see something about a person who is THAT obese, I want to smack their enablers.  Someone who can't even turn over by themselves certainly can't cook or shop.  If they lived alone, it would be a self-solving problem: can't obtain food, burn up the stored fat, walk to the grocery store.  Have you ever seen the Johnny Depp movie "What's Eating Gilbert Grape?"  The mother in that is grossly obese, and she has to be taken care of by her kids.  But kids feeding an overweight mom is understandable: she is the adult and should know what to do.  When someone has a wife or husband or parent feeding and caring for them, there is a psychological control issue buried somewhere.  If that half-ton man loses weight and survives, I'm willing to bet that his wife will feed him back up again.  "Oh honey, you look wonderful after your diet!  Here, have another cheesecake to celebrate."  Something in her psyche likes caring for her helpless mate, and she's probably going to sabotage him if he is too independent.  Part of the reason I joined the weight loss study was to thwart MY enabler.  Scott loves to cook and make treats for me, and fusses when I skip meals.  I have to take the initiative and say "Just one little slice of that marvelous tiramisu."  Even when the tiramisu turned out to be 4" high and about 15" in diameter, and it took the two of us a week to eat it all.  He also knows what foods I like best, and buys them.  Now I've got him buying me things that can be made in small servings, or calculated in calories/cup.  As long as I don't skip meals, I can get him to go along with it.  The hardest part for me is eating small portions.  It is a lot easier to just not eat than to eat a small amount.  That sounds like food addiction, doesn't it?  Some practical hints for anybody who wants to lose weight:  (1)   Write down everything you eat.  Even if you aren't counting calories, you might look at the list and say "I already ate two of those?  I guess I can skip the third."  Include all drinks, since most of them contain calories.  This also lets you see if you are drinking enough water.  Write down the times that you eat as well.  Again, you look at your log and say "I had lunch at noon and its only 1:30.  I can wait a while before I have that granola bar."  (2)   Measure all portions carefully.  Buy cups, glasses, bowls, etc. that have cup gradations on them, or measure your dishes.  Get silverware (or plasticware) with spoons that are really 1 teaspoon or tablespoon.  Don't ever eat anything directly out of the package!  That is the kiss of death.  For example, low-fat peanut butter is healthy if you eat a couple of teaspoons.  If you eat it straight from the jar, you can easily consume too much.  (A small jar of peanut butter is about 2700 calories, enough to power two average human bodies for 24 hours.)  Make yourself eat in increments.  If you eat a cup of cereal and are still desperately hungry, have another... but realize how much you are eating, and ask yourself if you really need it.  (3)   Keep track of your calories.  This is so easy to do these days.  Every food package has the nutritional data listed somewhere.  No exceptions:  I've found English nutrition labels glued onto packages where everything else is in Korean or Arabic.  There are dozens of books and websites that have comprehensive calorie lists, including those for specific fast foods.  Start by eating your normal foods, and see where all those calories are coming from.  (4)  Adjust your eating habits to reduce calories.  Stop putting butter on popcorn at the movies.  Drink water instead of cola.  Use skim milk instead of whole (which is only 4% anyway).  Don't supersize.  Drink plain coffee instead of Frappucino.  Make small adjustments to begin with, and see how it affects your total daily calories.  (5)   Set a calorie limit and stick to it.  Start slowly.  If you are currently consuming 4000 calories per day, try limiting yourself to 3000.  Once you get used to that, try 2000.  Then 1500.  If you think you can stick to it, go to 1000 for awhile.  In the long run, an average person is moderately active can survive nicely on 2000-2500 calories per day.    (6)   Increase your physical activity.  Start gradually.  Get a cheap pedometer (free at some fast food restaurnants) and wear it all the time.  Keep a log of the number of steps you take per day.  Try to increase your totals by parking farther from your destination, using the stairs instead of the elevator, going an extra lap around the store or mall while shopping, taking a stroll after dinner, etc.  Every little bit will burn more calories.  The accepted amount of daily activity for long-term good health is 10,000 steps per day.  Once you can do that, you are ready to move up to running or biking or working out at the gym.  Don't expect too much of yourself.  If you've always been sedentary, it will take a long time to build up to hard workouts.  (7)   Find some new hobbies.  Look for something fun that involves physical activity and doesn't focus on food.  This is very personal, since one person's chore is another person's joy.  Join a club.  Take lessons.  Volunteer.  You don't have to like everything, but you should TRY a variety to see what you DO like.  You may hate going to the gym, but love running on backroads.  Skiing is out, but you like snowboarding.  Try activities that give you a workout and a sense of accomplishment.  Mow the lawn with an old-fashioned pushmower (no engine).  Help build a house for a low-income family.  Clear brush on your favorite hiking trail.  Take your elderly neighbor's dog on long walks.  My current progress (at about 1 week): daily calories between 1700 and 1900, daily steps between 8000 and 14000, down 2 pounds.

      (If you didn't get that subject line, you need to go watch "The Two Towers".)  I just got online and looked up calorie values for sushi.  Pieces of regular rolls (California, others with rice on the outside) average 25 calories per piece.  Nigiri sushi (slices on rice) average 60 calories each.  Dragon rolls are 75 calories per piece (ouch).  Amazingly, ramune is only 75 calories per bottle, probably due to the fact that there is more glass than liquid.  Motivation for this calorie search?  Scott and I went to the Pearl Street Mall sidewalk sales in Boulder today, and I discovered just how many tempting restaurants are in that part of town.  I twisted Scott's arm and we had dinner at Hapa, during happy hour when they offer 2 rolls for $2.50 each.  I was really worried about blowing my diet, but it looks like I'm still in my target range.  Even with the fried calamari.  So I guess sushi parties are still okay during my diet!  I just have to avoid the tempura stuff and go easy on the dragon rolls.  And I need to go to the Asian mart for seaweed salad, because it is really yummy, no fat, and very low calories.  Expensive, though.  In other news, I just applied for a chemistry position at Overland High School.  I'm going to bike to the post office tomorrow to mail my resume, and then pedal on to Overland to see how far it is from here.  Chem is always a good place to start, because you get fewer yahoos in the classes, and fewer people apply for the job.  Keep your fingers crossed for me!

      Hokay, so... I need to lose weight.  Specifically, I need to lose about 50-60 pounds.   (Current official digital weight of 216 lbs, or almost 100 kilos.)  I'm pushing toward a size 16 and most of my good clothes are 12's, which affects my budget as well as my appearance.    The first positive step was quitting Mullen so I can spend more time on my bike and less time in the car.  The second step was signing up for a nutrition/weight loss study at the University of Colorado Health Science Center.  The study is testing a new soluble fiber drink (from the makers of Splenda) that will be released on the market in spring 2005.  This is a double-blind study to see if consuming this fiber drink decreases appetite and makes it easier to stay on a reduced-calorie diet.  Test subjects (us pudgy guinea pigs) will be put on a low-cal diet by a nutritionist, and then drink the fiber twice a day.  Nobody knows how much fiber they are getting, or if they are drinking the placebo (no fiber).  The doctors will analyze our diets and current eating habits, then calculate the amount of calories we need to consume per day.  They are adhering to a formula so that (in theory) we will all lose weight at the same rate.  Guinea pigs have to attend six weeks of a diet/exercise class, sort of like Weight Watchers.  I probably won't learn anything new, but I'm treating it like a required college class: pay attention, take notes, see if you can ace all the tests.  The class will include weigh-ins and collection of our food diaries.  We are also going to be given a pedometer and told to walk for exercise.  That part should be the easiest, since I'm currently alternating running days (3-5 miles) and biking days (10-15 miles).  I'm trying to steadily increase distances, in the hope of running a marathon sometime before my birthday in April.  (I promised myself I'd run a marathon by the time I was 40.  I say it still counts if I do it before 41.)  The diet time frame is 5 months, with a projected weight loss of 2-3 pounds per week if all goes well.  So I should be able to wear my clothes again by Xmas.  The down side: the diet is probably going to be 1000-1200 calories per day.  That means that eating out, including sushi, will be forbidden until the study is over.  If I don't get a teaching job soon, I'll need that restaurant money to pay for things like health insurance anyway.  Oh, I almost forgot.  Because we are devoting lots of time to this study, we get paid.  That's right, instead of shelling out bucks to Jenny Craig or Weight Watchers or whomever, the company marketing this new product is paying us $600 each to test it.  Get paid to diet... whoda thunk?

      I've never liked being called "Gracie".  When I was a middle-schooler, there was a Keebler TV commercial where an elf would say "Dance for a peanut butter cookie, Gracie".  The "Gracie" was an elephant, and I was a fat kid, so I endured a lot of taunting due to that ad.  It didn't help that "Grace" was such a weird name.  It always bothered me that I could never find my name on personalized merchandise, like bike license plates or pencils or jewelry.  (I still automatically buy anything that has my name on it.)  Even famous Graces seemed like lousy role models: Gracie Allen was a ditz, Grace Slick was a rock n' roll lunatic, Grace Jones was just odd, and I was too much of a tomboy to be interested in Princess Grace.  The play "Say Goodnight, Gracie", about the life of George Burns and Gracie Allen, is running in Denver right now.  Frank Gorshin, best known as "The Riddler" on the 60's TV show "Batman", is getting rave reviews in the lead role.  It isn't the kind of play I'd normally go to, but I may have to consider it now.  To quote the newspaper ad this morning:  "Calling all Gracies!  Bring your ID showing 'Grace' as your legal name and your ticket is free!"  Wow, there is a benefit to having an oddball name.  They couldn't make that offer to the "Georges", since there are way too many of them.  I'd love to find the person who thought of this promotion and thank them.  Maybe it's another Grace.

      I already have a personal blog on LiveJournal, but I thought it might be good to have one that is more professional.  My friend and former student Brenda has one at this site detailing her experiences as an intern, which was a good enough recommendation for me.  I taught in a public 7-12 school in Nunda NY for five years, then moved to Denver CO and spent 7 years in a private Catholic high school.  I'm currently unemployed (voluntarily), and hunting for a new position close to my condo.  Denver traffic is about as bad as Chicago, NY or LA, but our public transportation is far inferior.  As a result, most of us waste tremendous amounts of time sitting in the car.  I couldn't take it anymore, and have vowed to teach in Cherry Creek, the district that I pay taxes to support.  I am within easy biking distance of all 6 high schools in the district.  Now I just have to find the right position.  I'm a science teacher by training, with my BS and MA in biology.  In NY, I have permanent certifications in general science, biology, chemistry and earth science.  In CO, I have provisional certification in middle and secondary science.  NY requires more initial training (Master's degree), while CO requires continuing education and recertification.  So far, I've taught Regents (NY) chemistry, 7th grade computer science, CP (college prep) biology, honors biology, CP chemistry, comparative anatomy, human physiology, ceramics, intro to art, and pastel painting.  I developed the curriculum and all materials for the computer science, anatomy and physiology courses.  I write all my own tests and quizzes, design my own labs, draw diagrams when I can't find appropriate clipart, and pretty much create all the stuff I use in class.  I prefer MacOS, but I can handle Windoze.  I coded in Basic and Cobol on a PDP-8 in junior high, and learned how to type on an Apple III.  I'd like to learn UNIX, but haven't had the time.  I'd love to teach a science class in Spanish, since that would force me to brush up.  Guess you could call me a Renaissance gal.
