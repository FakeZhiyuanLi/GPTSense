						   Hi   I do not known if i will be able to write about my life all the time. I am not used of speaking a lot. First, let me introduce myself. I am 26 year old, i am french ( yes nobody's prefect) and my friends says that i'm prbably one of the less down-to-earth guy they've ever met !!!   What coul I add. I'm playing guitar, have a idea on everyting (eh pal, i'm French !!!) and i'm gay. Well, i have to leave you today but i'm determined to come back very soon. See you later on the great world of internet.

						   France and the Allies celebrated last week end one of the most fantastic military operations ever made in the world. Never so much depended on so few courageous soldiers wo sacrified to free a continent they didn't know. I'm 26 and i knom i'm living in a free land thanks to brave young men who fought for what they believe to be right. I will always love this America but i can help thinking that today America is on the wrong way. America's grief is justified, America is right to launch attacks against a faceless ennemy who wants to burn the whole world but this fight can be boiled down to a fight between evil and good, to a crusade against barbarians, it will be dangerous and counterproductive. Europe knows how complex is the world, europe knows how high is the price of blood and Europe doesn't want to be part of the wrong war. The United States are our closest friends and friends don't have to agree on everything. On the contrary, i will be happy if my friends tell me that i'm about to make a huge mistakes, that i act like a fool. I will be very thankful and i will accept this lend hand... because i don't want to stumble and fall in the Depths

						   I was recently watching one of my favourite movies, the wizard of Oz and i realized that you can only move on if you learn that dreams don't necesseraly come true, that pain don't necesseraly pass by and that you have to lock your dreams and your hopes somewhere deep in your soul. It is hard to find out that you will not be necesseray happy, you will not find someone who loves you the way you love him. But it doesn't matter, you learn to come along, you learn to get tougher and tougher. I'm afraid, afraid of waking me up one day and find out that i'm feeling anything. I prefer to suffer, because it means I'm alive...
