        Whoo! I finally got a blog!   Shalom everybody who might be reading this.... just so you know that's a Hebrew greeting, but i'm not Hebrew. I just like say it.... anyway, hi. My name's ryan and im a freshman, so the whole horomone/emotion thing makes for an interesting life.  now to describe myself.... i have red hair, brown eyes, and am fairly tall, and a little bit athletic, although i doubt anyone else would say so.  i seem shallow most of the time, but i can be really deep. most importantly, i'm Christian. that about sums it up....  On with the blog!  todays kind of a fun day to start... our school singing/performing group did a valentine's day show and it was HILARIOUS! just wanna say hats off to tommy for sliding up to sam and doing the breakdance thing, to guzzo and marc for bein you guys, and last but definently not least.... to brandsasse. that takes guts to get up in front of people and do the half chick thing... that was awesome. u have my undying respect.  anyway.... today was pretty much uneventful, except for that. i spent a lot of time wondering about my loneliness and the stuff i'm feeling. it seems like i'm the guy people say hi to in the hall but dont really want to spend time with... for those of you who are blissfully ignorant and say that alone is the best, u are wrong. i admit it's great at first, but it gets old real fast. in about 3 hours. maybe thats why ive been thinking about my crush so much... ill talk more about her later on, but just as a start, she's pretty, deep, and smart, which is rare and good.   my poetry writing rate is at an all time high, its like one every 2 or 3 days, compared to the previous month or so in which it was like one a week. by the way, if anybody wants to read those, e-mail me or AIM me or somethin, and ill try to get some to ya.  well, im out of things to say, so i guess this is it for tonight. hope this was half decent, keep reading. Shalom all!

        Time to get deep...   it's the same day as the last post, but i really need to write.... so much to think about. my best friend feels like trash, because he had the opportunity to but didnt stop one of our friends from potentially screwing up her life... HOW DID THE WORLD BECOME SO BROKEN?! so much is wrong in so many lives... it just shouldnt be like this. i wish we could fix it.... those who don't know what i mean, please try to be kind, even with just everyday things. you never know, the smallest things can rip a person apart.  Goodnight, everyone.

        Happy Valnetine's Day!   Happy Valentine's Day, everybody! i feel soo much better than i did last night, but my friends have varying moods.... brad's still upset about not stopping our friend, tj still feels horrible about his girl troubles, and sam's upset cuz she thinks she has fault in it... just to let you guys know, i love you all deeply, and i hope you can all get thru the tuff stuff... you're in my prayers.  -irony-  i'm officially not crushing on anybody, which is odd, cuz its v-day, and i dont care if u guys know about my previous chrush. for all u sig-people, it was alyse. if u read this alyse, i hope ur havin fun with jeff rite now.  best wishes for u guys!   its such a relief... i dont have to worry about liking anyone, thats all over. im gonna be flyin solo for a while. WHOO! it feels good...  anyways, happy valentine's day, and for brad, sam, & tj, i love you guys. i'm here if u need help. Shalom!  later that day....  wow. me, tj, sam (who i will now refer to as "buffy" for privacy issues) and tori were at this show for a charity for a disease that i cant remember the name of (somebody wanna help me out??) but anyway, i spent some quality time with good friends (once again, brandsasse and guzzo, u guys are awesome), and tj and buffy got a little close.  i looked down once and somehow realized that they were holding hands.... she started leanin against him and he put his arm around her. it was emotionally intoxicating for me, cuz i want the best for both of them, and all of u who know them know that the best for both of them is each other... tj was so happy, i could feel it coming across the room in tides.  me however, on the other side of the scale, am livin the happy soloist's life.  i know, i know, i said it sucked earlier, but i was wrong.  i guess it was seein tj and sam that made me happy, as previously stated.  wow... thank you, Jesus, for making life so unbelievably great and beautiful.... shalom!

        The day after Valentine's Day....   Shalom all! Today was yet another good day... went to church first thing today, and it felt great to worship.  the day got a lot better after that, my grandma and i went birthday shopping (yes, a week before my b-day... gotta love grandmas) i wanted pants, she got me a laptop. (once again, gotta love grandmas) so ive been playin around with it, and its pretty derned cool.  i got so mad at my dad today... hes goin thru his "midlife crisis" i think, and hes bummed about bein old, but he always takes it out on me. he got mad and started yelling, kicking things, and slamming doors because i disagreed with him about the net setup on my laptop. he does stupid stuff like that a lot. oh well... man, youth group was intense... we were playin dodgeball, and i was lucky. i only cut my knuckle up a little bit, but some people got soar joints and stuff, which is never fun... and i come to now, where i'm writing this.. well, i guess i'm out of stuff to say. once again, best wishes to tj and buffy... shalom!

        The end of the 4-day weekend   Shalom everybody... its been kind of a frustrating day. i had to do mindless chores from 11 to 4, and then i tried to fix the net hookup on my laptop. after talking to a lady with a  very  thick german accent for like half an hour, i figured out that either my modem is configured wrong, or its completely broken. the latter means that i'll have to take it back to the shop for like a week, which isnt cool.  then my mom and i got into this argument about taking it to school. may i note that this is one of the stupidest possible arguments to get into in this situation, considering that the only reason i got it was to help with school stuff. so then she decides that we have to put it on the insurance if i do take it to school, which can take days. why, i dont know, but its stupid to do that anyway, it cant get stolen, considering it will not leave my side for the entire day!!! so now i have to talk to my dad about it, who always disagrees with me and sides with my mom on this stuff.  im gonna have to take it back if i can't bring it to school, cuz theres no other reason to have it, since i have a pc at home.  my parents always have to disagree with me, and i hate it!!! it bugs me really bad when people say "your dad's cool!"  and all that. no, he smokes, he throws fits if he doesnt get his way, he overcriticizes me on mistakes that he made, and there are a few other things but i dont wanna list them all. its so  FRUSTRATING!!!   anyways, i hope everybody's day was better than mine.. shalom!

        Just another day   another day of laptop maintenance.  i spent about 5 hours on the phone with a lady who sounded like she was born in japan. she had a real pretty voice, as most oriental people do.  anyways, i was tryin to fix the laptop, and naturally, my mom gets mad.  *short argument ensues* so now they're sendin me a new modem, which i hope will fix the problem.  today was an okay day, kinda boring... i wanna make a shout to tj:  ok, just to get this out, i don't really care if we're not best friends anymore, i'm still here to help you out and talk to you. i really hope all this stuff passes you without serious damage. no matter what you think about her right now, though, dont give up on her.  you two are supposed to be together... 1 Corinthians 13:5 "love keeps no record of wrongs." so i guess you'll know. you're in my prayers.  Shalom, everybody.

        MAD/SAD/HOROMONES   sooo sorry about not writing lately, but its not like anybody cares... life has seriously SUCKED in the last few days.  im sooo depressed lately, its got a lot to do with my parents, *her*, and just... i dont even know.  my parents keep making me so frikking mad... i have an F in english cuz i bombed 2 big assignments, and naturally my parents got mad... this time i was about to punch my dad.  he started picking on my best friend, who i swear he has a problem with, even thought he says he doesnt.  i would so much ratherbe with my friends than my parents... and if you ever happen to read this, mom and dad, the answer to your "why" is that   GEE, MAYBE CUZ I'M GOOD ENOUGH FOR MY FRIENDS, AND THEY DONT HATE ME WHEN I DO SOMETHING WRONG!!!!!!!!!!  just as a side thought... unconditional love?  no. not from my parents.  on a -- well, not actually too much lighter, but -- note, i feel completely unwanted because of *her*, i don't think she even thinks of me as too much of a friend.  she's so amazing in even the littlest ways.  the way she talks, walks, thinks, even smiles... she's beautiful.  and i'm stuck here listening to songs like "I'd Do Anything" by Simple Plan (score) and thinkin.  i guess.. somethin will happen and have some effect, as these things always do, but i have no idea when, why, how, or what its gonna do.    So, i close with this quote:  "Let your anger be like a monkey in a pinata: hiding among the candy, hoping the children do not break it open with a stick."                                       -- Master Tang, from Kung Pow: Enter the Fist

        St. Meinrad!!! Score!!!   Wow... this entire weekend has been awesome.  8 people from the scout troop went to St. Meinrad Archabbey for a religious retreat.  I'm like a Meinrad veteran now, this weekend was my 5th year.  as always, it was great.  there's nothin better for a person than to spend a weekend with God.  It was great on Friday night, cuz i was sittin in the dining room when they were about to announce the theme -- ok, lemme skip back here.  i've been havin some faith problems lately, and one of the cool things about Christianity is that the lessons always apply. So, i'm listening to hear the theme for this year, and it is... "I want to see Jesus". so me & tj turned to each other and were like "wow"... yeah, the weekend was great. friday night, we were chuckin change randomly across the gym, and we hit quite a few targets.  so i being myself, turn to brandon and go "hey, gimme a nickel." so he gives me the nickel, and i'm like "heh heh.. watch this" so i *try* to throw it up over the balcony above us... it smokes the balcony, makes a huge noise, and clatters to the wooden floor, making another huge noise. i swear, i prolly woke up like 3 people.    *sleep*  so we wake up in the middle of the night, cuz the heaters there are really crappy, and to turn on they have to make some really annoying loud noises.  some kid says something about it being too loud, and tj, being half asleep and irritated out of his mind, told the kid something along the lines of "shutup or i'll make you feel like sat on a corncob."  so me and brandon are laughing for about 20 minutes, and then we go to sleep.   we got up at the buttcrack of dawn, around 5:30.  being awake before there is a trace of sun should be illegal.  *yay meinrad breakfast* tasteless "just add water" eggs, and some other stuff that i cant remember.  then we start the conferences. those are pretty cool, we break up into small groups and discuss some religious topics, there were some deep thoughts there.... then comes pilgrimage time. we walked prolly 2 1/2 miles to a chapel on top of a big hill, and me, one again being stupid, run up the hill and refuse to stop until i reach the top.  so i almost pass out at the top of the hill, and we have to go back down like 15 minutes later.  wow... i need to work on my stupidity.    after more conferences comes ultimate time *score* and movie time *double score*.  i finally saw finding nemo!!!! it was so great!!!!! just for katie here: "I'm a pirihana.  I'm from the Amazon."  gill is the coolest of the tank gang, although pierre is a close second.  lol "mount wannahochaloogie".  that movie's awesome... lol dory tries to speak whale... "oooheeeohohee..." fun stuff... good movie.    then comes sunday morning.  by the way, i've been thinkin about *her* all weekend, she's pretty much always in the back of my mind.  just thought i would throw that in there... *sad sigh* anyways, mass happens, which is cool, i've always liked meinrad services.  then the handing out of awards, then home.  the ride home was... er... i guess the word that goes here is "tribal".  so i wont say anything more.. yeah.  well, fun weekend, Thanx, Jesus.  one shoutout here: to rachel garrett, for keeping my comments section alive. *voice breaking* what would my blog be without you?  Goodnight everybody!

        Proof!   So they  don't  care.... this sux. it was a crummy day to start off with, so i come home and it doesnt get any better or worse, until like 10 minutes ago.  let me go back about a month here.... the last time my parents got really mad at me, i tried to tell them that i would appreciate not going to a counselor, since it's hypocritical, a waste of time, and it doesn't particularly make me feel good about myself.  i  thought  i had made a point, until today.  i was wondering why i had a doctors appointment, since i have nothing but a slight cold, so i asked.  bad move.  mom says, "you don't have a doctor's appointment, you have a counselor's appointment."  Absolutely   wonderful  .  So now, on top of my pile of things that i really don't like that are happening to me, i put "mom and dad completely disregard any opinion i give them." ive had some strong ideas because of scattered similar happenings, but i've got proof now. hoo-ray....

        C'est la vie...   Is french for "that's life".  kinda how i've been lately... not necessarily bad, not necessarily great, but overall good.  spring break started, which is good, but its gettin kinda boring, so i guess i'll have to do somethin about that.  3 days of brad staying over just ended, that was great, we were really mean to a friend tho... basically what happened was she im'd us on a new sn, and we asked who it was, only we were mean about it, but thats kinda what i do to new sns... anyway, she asked which one of us it was, and i thot of something... so i said i was "james, a friend of brad & ryan's from reitz," and we kinda went with it.... she was buying the whole thing, and naturally, we thot it was hilarious, so we kept goin... she was kinda overly honest with "james" tho, and it got bad when we had to tell her it was us.. she blocked us twice, amid "grrrr"s and insults and our apologies... then she got over it. (props, you know who you are) for those of u who want to know,  "james" was basically me, only more mature, sensitive, and less sarcastic.  i should be more like that, actually, and so i shall.  i promised myself i would act more like that, and so far i've been upholding it fairly well.   thinkin  A LOT  about *her* lately, talkin to her a lot at school.... man, she's amazing.  friday she was leaning against a window sill lookin out the window (absolutely beautiful) and i went over and asked her if she was ok. she goes "yeah, im just thinkin about somethin cool.." "what's that?" "see that tree?" (looks at a tree outside the window) "Yeah" "It's amazing, isn't it? I mean, how every branch is different.  Look at those buds. that one on the top of the tree probably thinks it's completely alone, but really, it's got every bud on the tree backing it up, and it doesn't even know it." "Wow, that's really cool.." As i said that, i was thinking "she's completely and totally perfect. amazing..."  so....  i found the near perfect song to describe how i feel about her... Here Without You, by 3 Doors Down.   i should put up the lyrics....  anyways, its good to be back!

        My nickname rocks.. but no one knows why.. heh...   ok,  ignoring the title and moving on.  today was tiring... i got up at 9 after staying up til about 4 talkion to rachel *much fun* and i had 3 hours to get ready to go to cincinatti. my cousin turns 5 tomorrow, so i kinda gotta be there.    as i planned, this is gonna be a really short entry, cuz i did almost nothing today except for play with my extremely hyper cousins.  i did, however, read most of andrea's story,  re-start a really old story idea on my laptop, and play video games. so, basically, i kept myself minimally occupied.  not that i dont like my cousins, but sometimes they get to be a little much to handle...   rachel, i was right.. i do miss you

        Well...   These past few days have been... different.. a few things happened that made me get over *her*, and ive actually been happy for a while.  somewhat confusing, tho.... i told a few friends that i was thinkin about asking out a close chick friend (aaah! taylor, me saying "chick" is your fault) and, naturally, the inqusitive natures of rachel and andrea bugged the crap out of me.  so i was planning to ask this girl out next week, but due to certain happenings while i was talking to her online, i kind of took action then.  i pretty much asked her out, and she was very happy, for reasons i wont go into.... anyways, i'll be going out with rachel on sunday (technical reasons), which is really cool.  lol... right now im actually having a conversation with her thats the single longest continued convo in my life.  we've talked about near everything... fantasy books to where to buy strawberries.  fun stuff.... this has been the happiest day i've experienced in quite a while.... so of course, i have to pay my homage... thank you, Lord, for this great day.    hope everybody is doing as well as i am, maybe even better... goodnight!

        OK... Posting Now   been a long time since i posted.. a lot has happened, so i guess i'll just talk about the last few days.    we got the show done.. that was stressful, but really fun.  no, i didnt have a part, but i was stage crew, and i was supervising the sets.. we almost had a drop collapse, and someone almost got hit with one, but nothing else big happened.  from what i could see, the show was great.    orienteering with scouts.  for those of you who dont know, orienteering is working with a compass and stuff.  the leaders dropped us off at a random spot in the woods with a compass and a map and we had to find our way back to the camp complex.  that was fun.. and muddy.. and wet.. but even though our boots were wet the next morning, its all good.  there were also pants-less races down a hill, which were fun.. EXCEPT FOR WHEN TOMMY KNOCKS YOU OFF BALANCE AND YOU TRIP OVER YOURSELF AND HIT THE WET GRASS WITH YOUR FACE AND ROLL SIX TIMES DOWN THE HILL!!!!!! lol.. that was fun..  other than that, nothing happening, except for once i have a full mind.. but i wont release the contents...

        the Maverick's back   "maverick" means loner, by the way...  broke up with rachel on monday nite.. yes, we're both ok, yes, we're still friends, no, don't ask.  being alone again... a curse inside a blessing, really.  people are like "oh, yeah, its great" but after a while, it gets old.  especially when one of the friends you frequently hang out with has every girl at sig hanging all over him.. yeah, that doesnt help, at all.  i figured out why the one part in "Here Without you" brings me near to tears.. the part where it goes:  Everything I know, And anywhere I go, It gets hard but it won't take away my love.   And when the last one falls, When it's all said and done,  It gets hard but it wont take Away My love..   its cuz i feel like i'll never have anyone that i can honestly feel that way about.   the stars are out tonight.. im gonna go drown my sadness in them

        Song for today    Don't Wanna Think About You Simple Plan   Can you leave me here alone now? I don't wanna hear you say That you know me,  That I should be Always doin' what you say.    'Cause I'm tryin' to get through today. And there's one thing I know: I don't wanna think about you Or think about me Don't wanna figure this out. I don't wanna think about you Or think about nothin'.  Don't wanna talk this one out.   I won't let you bring me down. 'Cause I know... I don't wanna think about you.  I don't wanna think about you.  When I wake up here tomorrow Things will never be the same, 'Cause I won't wait And you won't change.   Things will always be this way. Now I'm gonna get through today. And there's one thing I know: I don't wanna think about you Or think about me. Don't wanna figure this out. I don't wanna think about you Or think about nothin'.  Don't wanna talk this one out.   This time I won't let you bring me down. Won't let you shut me out. This time I know I don't wanna think about you.  Run away, run away! I'm running as fast as I can. Run away, run away! I'll never come back again! Run away, run away!  I don't wanna think about you, Or think about me, Don't wanna figure this out. I don't wanna think about you, Or think about me, Don't wanna talk this one out.  I don't wanna think about you, Or think about me, Don't wanna figure this out! (figure this out!) I don't wanna think about you, Or think about nothin', Don't wanna talk this one out! This time I won't let you bring me down! (bring me down!) Won't let you shut me out! (shut me out!) This time I know... I don't wanna think about you!  Run away, run away! I don't wanna think about you! Run away, run away! I don't wanna think about you! Run away, run away! I don't wanna think about you! Run away, run away!

        Now that poetry time is over...   the last few days have been crappy, put nicely.  Girl confusion.. i really dont want to lose my friendship with rachel, but it almost seems like i am.. im going back to my old way of things, in which when someone finds a fault in me or insults me, i just block them out.  it works in theory, but its got a lot of flaws when i actually use it...  oh well. things will work out. if they dont naturally, i'll make them.  goodnight, everybody.

        The Other Side   Here again in desolation Alone, with them The ancient friends, yet ancient foes Solitude Anger Rejection Heartbreak  I walk in solitude Along this flooded creek Skipping rocks that never seem to reach the other side Where I can call for help, fill this nothingness  So I keep walking, hoping for a bridge That will take me back to the other side.

        2 songs I wanna post   first of...    Away From the Sun: 3 Doors Down   It's down to this I've got to make this life make sense Can anyone tell what I've done? I miss the life, I miss the colors of the world, Can anyone tell where I am?  'Cause now again I found myself so far down, Away from the sun that shines into The darkest place, I'm so far down, Away from the sun again, Away from the sun again...  I'm over this I'm tired of livin in the dark. Can anyone see me down here? The feelin's gone. There's nothin' left to lift me up Back into the world I know.  'Cause now again I've found myself so far down, Away from the sun that shines into the darkest place, I'm so far down,  Away from the sun that shines to light the way for me, To find my way Back into the arms that care about The ones like me, I'm so far down, Away from the sun again!  Oh, no, yeah, oh, no...  It's down to this I've got to make this life make sense And now I can't tell what I've done. Now again I've found myself so far down, Away from the sun that shines to light the way For me...  'Cause now again I've found myself so far down, Away from the sun that shines into the darkest place, I'm so far down, Away from the sun that shines to light the way for me, To find my way Back into the arms that care about The ones like me, I'm so far down, away from the sun again!  Oh, no, yeah, I'm gone...   and second.....        Iris: The Goo Goo Dolls   And I'd give up forever to touch you, 'Cause I know that you feel me somehow.   You're the closest to heaven that I'll ever be,  And I don't want to go home right now.  And all I can tase is this moment,  And all I can breathe is your life. Sooner or later, it's over,  I just don't want to miss you tonight.  And I don't want the world to see me, 'Cause I don't think that they'd understand. When everything's made to be broken,  I just want to you to know who I am!  And you can't fight the tears that ain't comin', Or the moment of truth in your lies. When everything feels like the movies, Yeah, you bleed just to know you're alive!  And I don't want the world to see me,  'Cause I dont think that they'd understand. When everything's made to be broken, I just want you to know who I am!  And I don't want the world to see me,  'Cause I dont think that they'd understand. When everything's made to be broken, I just want you to know who I am!  And I don't want the world to see me,  'Cause I dont think that they'd understand. When everything's made to be broken, I just want you to know who I am!  I just want you to know who I am!  I just want you to know who I am!  I just want you to know who I am!     those are good songs... goodnight everybody

        Here goes nothin   for some reason, i've been inspired to pour my heart out onto this insignificant little internet speck that no one reads anymore. so...  here goes nothin.  What do i feel? pain. pain and anger at nearly everything. im becoming immature again for some reason, just how i was at the beginning of the year.  seems like im losing friends again, too.  i hate the way i do things! it always seems like people are finding problems with me and criticizing me, so what do i do? block them out and pretend i dont care.  hell, i nearly blocked brad out today, which is really bad, cuz we're the best of friends.  lately, though, it seems like we've been drifting. why did he criticize me? we'll say... *her*.  you know what? i dont care, im so sick of hiding stuff.  *she* is alyse(taylor).  yes, i've had feelings for her ever since before Christmas. its the longest amount of time ive ever felt this way about a girl.  yeah, i know. i dont have a chance. go ahead, tell me.  i wont care. its gotten to the point where even the stars cant blur out my feelings for her.  everytime i'm near her, it hurts so much... for those of you who don't know how much it hurts to look into someone's eyes and   know   with an unexplainable certainty that they don't feel the same way about you as you do them, you're the luckiest people alive. again, go ahead and tell me that i dont have a chance. that i, this sarcastic-voiced, immature, farmboy-looking   loser   doesnt have a chance.  i know i dont.  but i can still hope.  and so i will.

        Oops   forgot to put up some lyrics.  here they are....   Over My Head: Lit  I'm in over my head!  They wanna try and build me up So they can tear me down. I wish that I could be back there, But I'm right here right now.  They've taken everything that I've had to give, and They say it's over, but Man, I'm still here livin'. I don't know what to do. I think that maybe I'm in over my head! Stuck in the red. Somethin' they said Makes me think that I'm over my head, Over my head, Over my head!  I've gotta get away from here And it couldn't be too soon. 'Cause i see the stars when you're with me Like rockets to the moon.  You take me everywhere that I've never been, and Show me the meaning of what I've had to give, and I don't know what to say. I think that maybe I'm in over my head! Lyin' in her bed. Somethin' she said Makes me think that I'm in over my head,  Over my head, Over my head!   They've taken everything that I've had to give, and They say it's over, but Man, I'm still here livin'. I don't know what to do. I think that maybe I'm in over my head! Stuck in the red. Somethin' they said It makes me think that I'm over my head, Over my head, Over my head!  I'm in over my head. I'm in over my head. I'm in over my head. I'm in over my head!   whoo... that was fun.

        Well, that was a good run.   ah, freshman year is over... it was pretty good, id have to say.  tommy threw his birthday/schools out party last night.  no offense to tommy at all, he did great with it, but i just dont like parties very much.  there are too many people, and everyone's off doing something with someone else, so i always feel like the odd man out.  this was a decent party, tho, as parties go for me. we watched school of rock (awesome movie!) and then just kinda did whatever.  taylor couldnt make it, which made me kinda sad, cuz i was gonna tell her about everything at the party. speaking of her, brad says she likes me... i  severely  doubt that.who knows though?  the night of the party there was an  awesome  storm.  rain was comin down in sheets, lightning, thunder... it was great.  for those of u who dont like storms, sorry, i thot it was pretty cool.  well, at the party i was mean to a couple people, just so you know, i didnt mean it.  it was a mood thing, nothing more...  something that never happens to me happened to me at the party.  Jenny was takin pictures of everybody with her digital, and she came up to me and goes "smile!" so i figure why not.. she takes the picture and was like "wow you look hott!" i was taken by surprise.  then sam & sarah said the same thing about the pic... strange stuff.  it boosted my self-esteem tho, so its cool.

        Spillin my heart out   wow, ever since earlier on today, i've been really depressed.  why? im the kid that everyone just says "hi" too in the hall, but no one wants to have any kind of relationship with.  its annoying as hell when your friends have girls all over them and no one pays attention to you.  and i know im incredibly immature, too.  i say and do completey stupid stuff that no one thinks is funny, but they pretend to laugh so i dont get mad or somethin.  they think i dont see it, too. andrea, if you read this, the very last thing i am (other than a chick magnet) is unobservant. sometimes its all i want just to feel the happiness of loving someone.  but of course, everyone just smiles akwardly and keeps walkin.  it makes me wonder if the majority of people really do care about others.    and even tho i like to think im a loner, i would give near anything to feel a mutual love for someone, especially.. well, you guys know.  as tommy said on his blog:  what do i want?  i want to be the next cole and katie to have someone to be with to fuse into a carbert to live happily ever after with to care about to be cared about to talk to at 3 am to love  thats exactly how i feel. so maybe we're not all alone.. who knows, really?   --- Now that she's back in the atmosphere, I'm afraid that she might think of me as Plain old Jane told a story 'bout a man who was too afraid to fly so he never did land. -Train, Drops of Jupiter  --- And I don't want the world to see me, 'Cause I dont think that they'd understand. When everything's made to be broken, I just want you to know who I am.  -The Goo Goo Dolls, Iris  --- Everything I know, And anywhere I go, It gets hard but it wont take away my love. And when the last one falls, When it's all said and done, It gets hard, but it won't take Away  My love. -3 Doors Down, Here Without You

        Lyrics for the day     Matchbox 20: Unwell  All day Starin'at the ceilin', makin' Friends with shadows on the wall. All night Hearin' voices tellin me that I should get some sleep 'Cause tomorrow might be good, Or somethin'... Hold on, Feelin' like I'm headed for the Break down, And I don't know why.  But I'm not crazy, I'm just a little unwell. I know, right now you can't tell, But stay a while and maybe then you'll see A different side of me. I'm not crazy, I'm just a little impaired. I know, right now you don't care, But soon enough, you're gonna think of me, And how I used to be.    Me.. talkin' to myself in public,  Dodgin' glances on the train. And I know, I know they've all been talkin' 'bout me, I can hear them whisper, And it makes me think there must be somethin' wrong With me. Out of all the hours, thinkin', Somehow,  I've lost my mind.  But I'm not crazy, I'm just a little unwell. I know, right now you can't tell, But stay a while and maybe then you'll see A different side of me. I'm not crazy, I'm just a little impaired. I know, right now you don't care, But soon enough, you're gonna think of me, And how I used to be.   I've been talkin in my sleep. Pretty soon they'll come to get me. Yeah, they're takin me away.  But I'm not crazy, I'm just a little unwell. I know, right now you can't tell, But stay a while and maybe then you'll see A different side of me. I'm not crazy, I'm just a little impaired. I know, right now you don't care, But soon enough, you're gonna think of me, And how I used to be.   Yeah, How I used to be. How I used to be. I'm just a little unwell. How I used to be. (A little unwell) How I used to be. I'm just a little unwell.  good song

        Word of the day: ouch   Holiday World was today, that was craploads of fun.  we rode the raging rapids at least 7 times, we were all soaked.  lots of dirty conversations, too.. lol.  Im happy for Marcus and Emily, they seem to be doing great.  perfect song for them is "Dont Want to Miss A Thing".  those of u wo get sad from thinking about romantic songs like that, too bad. so do i. and that was really insensitive, but thats not the point.    now for the reason for the blog title. I was completely ready to talk to her about it. then, the worst possible thing happened: i figure out she and jordan are dating. boom.  right there, i just kinda stop doing things.  the pain of that actually numbed my senses for a good number of seconds, im not kidding.   so why talk to her, ask her out? just as i  knew , not thought, it would have been a no.  oh well, she knew about it anyway. i wonder if she really understands how much it hurts when she friendly says "i love ya". i dont think she does. it doesnt matter...   someones gotta be alone, why not me?

        and of course, the lyrics...     Ocean Avenue: Yellow Card  Theres a place on Ocean Avenue Where I used to sit and talk with you. We were both sixteen and it felt so right, Sleepin' all day, Stayin' up all night. Stayin' up all night.  There's a place on the corner of Cherry Street We would walk on the beach in our bare feet. We were both eighteen and it felt so right, Sleepin' in all day, stayin' up all night. Stayin' up all night.  If I could find you now, things would get better! We could leave this town, and run forever! Let your waves crash down on me and take me away, yeah!  There's a piece of you that's here with me, It's everywhere I go, It's everything I see. When I sleep, I dream, and it gets me by, I can make believe that you're here tonight. That you're here tonight.  If I could find you now, things would get better! We could leave this town, and run forever! I know somewhere, somehow, we'll be together! Let your waves crash down on me and take me away, yeah!  I remember the look in your eyes When I told you that this was goodbye. You were beggin' me not tonight, Not here,  Not now. We're lookin' up at the same night sky, And keep pretendin' the sun will not rise. We'll be together for one more night,  Somewhere,  Somehow...  If I could find you now, things would get better! We could leave this town, and run forever! I know somewhere, somehow, we'll be together! Let your waves crash down on me and take me away, yeah!    awesome  song. not really aimed at anyone, but it does make me think of somebody. and no, its not taylor...

        Odd    hmm... i possibly have a new crush, but i doubt it. probably just rebound from taylor.  i wonder...   i bought 2 songs today: "the reason" by hoobastank and "ocean avenue" by yellowcard. both really good, but im gonna put up the lyrics for ocean avenue. also thinkin about writing a poem, which i'll likely post here.   new book to read: dune.  my dad's read it and says its awesome. well, i guess i'll know soon.

        today's revalation: no more stupid mistakes.    ok, reason for the title:  we were driving home from cincinatti, and my cousin asked us if he could eat somethin he had in his hand, seeing as he's deathly allergic to peanut butter. heres the dialogue: travis(my cousin): is this caramel or peanut butter? me: thats just carmel, you can eat it. mom: no, that has nuts in it! dont eat it! me: *sits there in stupor*  wow, i could have killed my cousin because of a stupid mistake. hence the title.  in other news... -there are no comments on my entries anymore.  this gives strong evidence to my suspicion that most people just tolerated me for the year and now are ditching me over the summer. -still got the new crush, also adding to loneliness. oh well.  again i ask...  someone's gotta be alone, why not me?

        again with the lyrics     Hoobastank: The Reason  I'm not a perfect person, There's many things I wish I didn't do. But I continue learning, I never meant to do those things to you. And so I have to say before I go That I just want you to know:  I found a reason for me To change who I used to be. A reason to start over new, And the reason is you.  I'm sorry that I hurt you, It's somethin' I must live with everyday. And all the pain I put you through, I wish that I could take it all away, And be the one who catches all your tears. That's why I need you to hear:  I found a reason for me To change who I used to be. A reason to start over new, And the reason is you! And the reason is you. And the reason is you! And the reason is you!  I'm not a perfect person,  I never meant to do those things to you. And so I have to say before I go That I just want you to know: I found a reason for me To change who I used to be A reason to start over new, And the reason is you.  I found a reason to show A side of me you didn't know, A reason for all that I do, And the reason is you...

        bored out of my MIND   well, now that summer's set in, im facing a severe lack of things to do.  With that comes a lack of emotion. never mind about the crush, it was most likely just a quick rebound from taylor. good thing i didnt do anything this time... if u read this, dont be offended, youre still an awesome friend.  So, i guess ill be content practicing bo and sitting here at the computer for the rest of the summer.. well, maybe not, cuz current river's comin up on saturday, and thats always awesome.   dont know why, but i really like this song. im gonna put up the lyrics in a few minutes. its dedicated to all the friends that ive hurt, pas and present.

        CURRENT RIVER RECAP    wow. i got home from current river like 2 hours ago, and it was awesome. let me tell you, though, 4 days out on the river with a huge group of guys makes you miss a lot of things, namely girls, especially a specific few, but im not gonna go into that.  soo...   day one: got up at like 7 and went to church, then hit the river.  after much cold water and swamping (flipping a canoe), we got to the little cliffs.  it makes no sense... it took me like 15 minutes to jump off of a 12 or 13 foot cliff. a fear of heights and a fear of drowning are not a good combo for cliff jumping. nonetheless, i jumped, and it was fun. then more canoeing, and into the cold spring.  the water there is about 50 degrees. if you stay in that water long enough, youre gonna be sterile.  and that was it for the first day, we went back to the campsite and were all cool and stuff with our home-made duct tape wallets (me & tommy) and me with my random 40 dollars.   day two: BIG CLIFF! YESS!!! nothin like jumpin 30 feet into a cold current to wake you up. which i did four times, and ran off the cliff screaming random things like "pasta" and "wangberry".  then off to the next feature.. the cave in which the water is extremely cold. jumping into that is like being stuck in an ice cube.  lol.. good job tommy and brandon, getting swamped in the cave. revenge is oh so sweet.  more swamping,  which never fails to be fun.   the stars were   awesome   that night. theres nothing better than laying out on the grass in complete darkness, no one within 10 yards of you at least, just watching the stars go by. i saw a satellite, which ive never seen before, and a meteor, and the milky way, which ive seen only twice before. sometimes it would be great to just pick one of them and go explore it, and then explore all the other stars around it, until you've seen the entire universe.  damn our stunted technology! pardon my language...   day three: the last day. went to the other cold spring, didnt really jump in at all.  instead tommy & brandon & i went to investigate the nearby cabin. this resulted in tommy saying "wow, the floor's a lot farther down than it looks." nice one, tommy...  there was a cave-y spot in the cliffs where we stopped for lunch, and about 20 chicks our age went by on canoes.  lol.. we were discussing how they would be divided up, and tommy got about ten. (yes, thats extremely pig-like and sexist, i know, but we're guys who havent seen women in 3 days, give us a break.) steve is awesome for being able to get out of that cave, i didnt think he could. and after that, finally, a warm spring.  tommy & brandon & i tried to find the source, but it was too far back. so we turned around, helped some kids dig a tire out of the beach, and got dinner before everybody else. fun stuff. when we got back to camp, tommys tent fell over just enough to get his and brandons stuff wet.. oops. tommy & brandon & i slept on the bus for no real reason that night, i guess just because it seemed fun. i got cold and woke up and 4:30, got my sleeping bag, and slept for like 2 more hours. then we woke up, had breakfast, did some packing junk and went home.  a crapload of inside jokes came from that trip, here are some:  -"where the hell are all my crawdads?" says the wangberry. -the "cheese-gasm" project -the taylor project -"whoa! that was close!"  "what?"  "that spear!" -the "sam-slayer"  well, goodnight guys.. its all good!

        Iris   i know ive already posted the lyrics for this, but i dont care cuz it applies.    Iris: The Goo Goo Dolls  And I 'd give up forever to touch you, 'Cause I know that you feel me somehow. You're the closest to heaven that I'll ever be And I don't want to go home right now.  And I can taste is this moment, And all I can breathe is your life. And sooner or later, it's over, I just don't want to miss you tonight.  And I don't want the world to see me,  'Cause I don't think that they'd understand. When everything's made to be broken, I just want you to know who I am.  And you can't fight the tears that ain't comin', Or the moment of truth in your lies. When everything feels like the movies, Yeah, you bleed just to know you're alive!  And I don't want the world to see me, 'Cause I don't think that they's understand. When everthing's made to be broken, I just want you to know who I am.  And I don't want the world to see me, 'Cause I don't think that they's understand. When everthing's made to be broken, I just want you to know who I am.  And I don't want the world to see me, 'Cause I don't think that they's understand. When everthing's made to be broken, I just want you to know who I am.  I just want you to know who I am.  I just want you to know who I am.  I just want you to know who I am.  I just want you to know who I am!

        Are you suggesting coconuts migrate?*   ah yes, the perfect sentence to desribe the random-ness of my day. i got up at 7, and got ready for VBS (vacation bible scool) at church, and had a good long talk with my dad, mostly about women. i think its awesome that we can talk about stuff like that, i know thats a subject to be avoided in most families, especially the over-protective ones. but no, my dad gives me advice. maybe thats because he's  awesome . so anyways, i leave for VBS, and the fun begins.   first thing that goes on is a girl there who ive never really noticed before starts flirting with me, so i strike up a conversation, and within 2 hours i'm teachin her how to slowdance. (yes, i can do that, but none of you have ever seen it.) so theres possibly the beginning of a little romance there.   anyways, she had to leave for her class while i worked on the skit with a couple guys from VBS. i have the coolest part, im the puppeteer for "Rick the Brick" who, you may have guessed, is a talking brick. easy skit today. so the littlest kids (3-4 yr olds) come into the church early to sing a few songs, and of course, the "rick the brick song". so whenever the song says "rick the brick" i stick the puppet up from underneath the table and make it dance.  me and nic (sound effects guy) are under the table doing this song, and theres a *thunp* on the other side of the curtain that sheilds us from view.  me: what was that? nic: i dunno... *more thumps, and something tries to push through the curtain* me: aah!  so the table was being swarmed by small children, and very violently. they were all trying to get to my puppet. it ended up so that i was flinging my fist up against the curtain, tryin to get them back. finally, the adults broke it up.. very scary.   after VBS, i decided to walk home, and i almost made it, but my pastor gave me a ride for the half-mile that i had left. its always good to just walk for a while and check out your surroundings. there were some really pretty scenes, somethin that you'd find in one of those scenic calendars. so, not getting enough athletics for the day, i went out and rode my bike for half an hour, so i got my cardio today (not that i particularly care all that much, im lean enough)   i hate my infection. 4 pills a day, 2 bandage changes a day, along with hydrogen peroxide and neosporin on one of the most itchy spots on the body (no, rachel, not like that) and i cant swim for 2 weeks. oh well, ill be fine. goodnight, guys!  *continuation from top: arthur:not at all! they could be carried! castle guard:what?! a swallow, carry a coconut?! A:of course! he could grip it by the hask! CG:its not a matter of where he grips it, its a simple matter of weight ratios! a five ounce bird cannot carry a one pound coconut! A:supposing two swallows carried it together?  and on, and on, and on...

        Jack Handy is my friend    Anytime I see something screech across a room and latch onto someones neck, and the guy screams and tries to get it off, I have to laugh, because what is that thing.  If you ever fall off the Sears Tower, just go real limp, because maybe you'll look like a dummy and people will try to catch you because, hey, free dummy.  One thing kids like is to be tricked. For instance, I was going to take my little nephew to DisneyLand, but instead I drove him to an old burned-out warehouse. "Oh, no," I said, "DisneyLand burned down." He cried and cried, but I think that deep down he thought it was a pretty good joke. I started to drive over to the real DisneyLand, but it was getting pretty late.  Laurie got offended that I used the word "puke." But to me, that's what her dinner tasted like.  When I was a kid my favorite relative was Uncle Caveman. After school we'd all go play in his cave, and every once in a while he would eat one of us. It wasn't until later that I found out that Uncle Caveman was a bear.  I think a good gift for the President would be a chocolate revolver. and since he is so busy, you'd probably have to run up to him real quick and give it to him.  If you're robbing a bank and you're pants fall down, I think it's okay to laugh and to let the hostages laugh too, because, come on, life is funny.  If you're in a war, instead of throwing a hand grenade at the enemy, throw one of those small pumpkins. Maybe it'll make everyone think how stupid war is, and while they are thinking, you can throw a real grenade at them.  I hope life isn't a big joke, because I don't get it.  Even though I was their captive, the Indians allowed me quite a bit of freedom. I could walk freely, make my own meals, and even hurl large rocks at their heads. It was only later that I discovered that they were not Indians at all but only dirty-clothes hampers.  thank you jack.. you make life fun.  anyways....  VBS was cool today, i didnt get swarmed by small children. me and nic could NOT stop laughing, cuz in the middle of the "rick the brick" song, he stuck up a wood block from under the table, and he goes "look! its woody the wood!" really really loud. absolutely hilarious.   me & beck were talkin about VBS online about half an hour ago.. heres a good chunk of the convo:  pyropirate08(becky): how was rick the brick today?? lol pyroboy130(me): lol pyroboy130: flirty pyroboy130: not the brick, me pyropirate08: lol pyropirate08: i was gonna say.. lol pyroboy130: yes.. a brick puppet flirted with the 3 year olds  becky, youre awesome. you make me smile  sam, i know its rough stough, but i guess ya gotta stick it out, cuz thats the way things are... just remember, im always here.  goodnight guys!

        lyrics    wow, 3 songs today. here goes   Trapt: Echo  Close my eyes, Let the whole thing pass me by. There is no time To waste, Asking "why?" I'll run away with you By my side. I'll run away with you By my side! I need to let go, let go, let go, let go, of this pride, yeah.  I think about your face And how I fall into your eyes. The outline that I trace Around the one that I call mine. Time that called for space, Unclear where you drew the line. I don't need to solve this case, And I don't need to look behind.  Close my eyes, Let the whole thing pass me by. There is no time To waste Asking "why?" I'll run away with you By my side I'll run away with you By my side! I need to let go, let go, let go, let go of this pride, yeah.  Do I expect to change The past I hold inside With all the words I say Repeating over in my mind? Some things you cant erase No matter how hard you try. An exit to escape Is all there is left to find.  Close my eyes, Let the whole thing pass me by. There is no time To waste Asking "why?" I'll run away with you By my side I'll run away with you By my side! I need to let go, let go, let go, let go of this pride Until this echo, echo, echo, echo in my mind, Until this echo, echo, echo, echo can subside, yeah.   So I Close my eyes, Let the whole thing pass me by. There is no time To waste Asking "why?" I'll run away with you By my side I'll run away with you By my side! I need to let go, let go, let go, let go of this pride Until this echo, echo, echo, echo in my mind, Until this echo, echo, echo, echo can subside.    3 Doors Down: Changes  I'm not supposed to be Scared of anything, But I don't know where I am. I wish that I could move But I'm exhausted and nobody understands. (How I feel..)  I'm tryin' hard to breathe now, But there's no air in my lungs. There's no one here to talk to, And the pain inside is makin me numb.  I try to hold this Under control. They can't help me,  'Cause no one knows.  Now, I'm goin' through changes, changes. God, I feel so frustrated lately! When I get suffocated, save me! Now, I'm goin' through changes, changes.  I'm feelin' weak and weary Walkin through this world alone. Everything I say, every word of it, Cuts me to the bone. (And I bleed..) I've got somethin to say, But now I've got nowhere to turn. It feels like I've been buried underneath All the weight of the world.  I try to hold this Under control. They can't help me,  'Cause no one knows.  Now, I'm goin' through changes, changes. God, I feel so frustrated lately! When I get suffocated, save me! Now, I'm goin' through changes, changes.  I'm bound and breakin', bound and shakin'! I hope I make it Through all these changes!  Now, I'm goin' through changes, changes. God, I feel so frustrated lately! When I get suffocated, save me! Now, I'm falling apart, Now, feel this!  But I'm goin' through changes, changes! God, I feel so frustrated, lately! And I get suffocated, I hate this! But I'm goin' through changes, changes...    and now, the grand finale:   Switchfoot: Meant to Live  Fumblin' his confidence and wondrin' why the world has passed him by Hoping that hes meant for more than Arguments and failed attempts to fly, fly..  We were meant to live for so much more! Have we lost ourselves? Somewhere we live inside, Somewhere we live inside! We were meant to live for so much more! Have we lost ourselves? Somewhere we live inside!  Dreaming about Providence and whether mice and men have second tries. Maybe we've been livin' with our eyes half open, Maybe we're bent and broken, broken..  We were meant to live for so much more! Have we lost ourselves? Somewhere we live inside, Somewhere we live inside! We were meant to live for so much more! Have we lost ourselves? Somewhere we live inside!  We want more than this world's got to offer. We want more than this world's got to offer. We want more than the wars of our fathers. When everything inside Screams for second life, YEAH!  We were meant to live for so much more! Have we lost ourselves? We were meant to live for so much more! Have we lost ourselves? We were meant to live for so much more! Have we lost ourselves?  We were meant to live! We were meant to live!   awesome songs.   someone's gotta be alone, why not me?

VBS rocked today.  it was the last day, easy skit, everyone loved rick the brick. when we were idling between rehearsals (actually we only practiced once, so basically whenever we were idling) kelley (the girl i mentioned earlier in the blog) and i were cuddling. thats always good.. too sad for me, it wont last. she, her cousin, and i went to see dodgeball today, awesome movie.  i recommend it for people who like comedy movies (so, basically, everybody). anyway, kelley and i got kinda cuddly, and out of nowhere she goes "i shouldnt do this, i dont wanna hurt my boyfriend." ok, so theres a boyfriend involved. oops. oh well, respect to kelley for doin what she did, even though it hurt like a mother. again, the loneliness sets in. hello, my enemies, im back again....

        thoughts for the weekend    well, i was gonna write something about the party, but everybody who reads this knows all about it. fun stuff. anyways, on with the thoughts...  -someone asked me how you could appreciate happiness without sadness, and i responded by asking how you could experience happiness if it was momentary and fleeting.i mean, is sadness the only true human emotion? if you think about it, sure, we get happy and all, but things always seem to come crashing back down, fading away into the black.  -why do people pursue things even if they know (or convince themselves) that they cant have it? is it simply blind drive, or something more?  answers and opinions are welcome in comments

Leaping from tree to tree, As they float down the mighty rivers of British Colombia, With my best girl by my side! The larch! The pine! The giant redwood tree! The sequoia! The little wobbly fruit tree! And Sing! Sing! Sing!  Oh, I'm a lumberjack and I'm okay, I sleep all night and I work all day!  *background* Oh, he's a lumberjack and he's okay, He sleeps all night and he works all day.  *lumberjack* I cut down trees, I eat my lunch, I go to the lavatrine! On Wednesdays I go shopping, and have buttered scones for tea!  *background* He cuts down trees, he eats his lunch, he goes to the lavatrine. On Wednesdays he goes shopping, and has buttered scones for tea.  *lumberjack and background* I'm a lumberjack and I'm okay, I sleep all night and I work all day!  *lumberjack* I cut down trees, I skip and jump, I like to press wildflowers! I put on womens' clothing, and hang around in bars!  *background* He cuts down trees, he skips and jumps, he likes to press wildflowers. He puts on womens' clothing, and hangs around in bars?!  *lumberjack and backgorund* I'm a lumberjack and I'm okay, I sleep all night and I work all day!  *lumberjack* I cut down trees, I wear high heels, suspenders and a bra! I wish I'd been a girlie, just like my dear papa!  *background* He cuts down trees, he wears high heels, suspenders and a bra?!?! *background singers walk away, yelling disgustedly*  *backgrounds walk quickly back, joining lumberjack* Oh, I'm a lumberjack and I'm okaaayy!   yess... thank you, monty python. may you live on forever in the heart of comedy.

        50   as the title says, this is my 50th post, which i guess is pretty cool. and, for those who would argue that the only point of this post is to reach 50, *coughrachelcough* its not. theres other stuff i wanna post. such as:  listening to awesome music lately, (such as nirvana) has made me decide im gonna take up guitar. so, probably tomorrow, im gonna head downtown with my dad and get myself a half-acoustic guitar, and start takin lessons as soon as i can. along with that, im growin my hair out, longer than i did last time. so, for those girls that read my blog and like shaggy hair, u can say "yay" if you want, but if you dont it doesnt matter to me. also thinkin about an ear piercing, i dunno tho, maybe, maybe not.   secondly, something rare happened the last 2 nights. *no bad thoughts* i dreamed 2 nights in a row. now i usually dream once or twice a month, at least thats what i remember. anyways, the really weird thing is, i dreamed about the same thing both nights. this thing was a specific person (not gonna say who) and, also odd, i kissed her in both dreams. wonder what that means...  questions / opinions / comments welcome

        lyrics    old song this time   Kansas: Dust in the Wind   I close my eyes, Only for a moment, and the moment's gone. All my dreams Pass before my eyes in curiosity. Dust in the wind, ALl they are is dust in the wind.  Same old song, Just a drop of water in an endless sea. All we do Crumbles to the ground, though we refuse to see..  Dust in the wind, All we are is dust in the wind.  Now, don't hang on, Nothin' lasts forever but the earth and sky! It slips away, And all your money won't another minute buy!  Dust in the wind, All we are is dust in the wind.. Dust in the wind, Everything is dust in the wind....

        got shrimp?    in case you're wondering why the !@#$ i named this post what i did, its cuz im wearin my "got shrimp" shirt from bubba gump's in NYC. anyway..  the weekend was awesome.. brent and brad stayed the night for 2 nights, we had a bottle rocket war. lemme tell ya, that is  the  best redneck game ever. brent got hit in the forehead with a rocket, but it bounced off, so he wasnt really hurt. brad, on the other hand, got a rocket stuck in his shirt, so it exploded on his chin and took a small piece of skin off his face. that was his fault, tho, he was loading in the middle of the field, so i  had  to shoot at him.. lol. the 4th was even better, my dad spent a hundred bucks on fireworks, so we put on our own little show. did anyone else catch the storm that afternoon? man, it was   perfect  . light rain that turned into a downpour, but the sun was still visible the whole time.  there was a double rainbow like 600 feet from my house, it was absolutely beautiful. made me wish somebody was there.. sam and rachel, you know who im talkin about.   went to drivers ed today, passed the test, but it wasnt the big test, so it doesnt matter all that much. watched a very gory movie, it made me think.. a lot of lives are wasted, and theres really nothing we can do to stop it from happening. of course, us being humans, we still have to try. i dont think its in the human spirit to just give up without one hell of a try. so, thats what ive gotta do.   goodnight, guys.

        thoughts and junk   &nbsp; ok.. this week i learned that there are 100 million stars for every grain of sand on every beach in the world.   WOW.   so, ive come to the conclusion that there absolutely has to be civilization somewhere else in the universe. then, i get to thinkin.. and i come up with an idea. my idea is that there are certain things that are so important that every civilization must invent them. some of these: &nbsp; -language -some form of religion -music -fire -trading/sharing of goods -the wheel -government/class system -written language -some form of storytelling -electricity -radio &nbsp; arguments/additions welcome

        poetry   &nbsp; this ties into the deep thought i had a while back.. hope you like it &nbsp; &nbsp;  Odd Man Out  &nbsp;  Standing against the wall  Life beats in the background,  Nameless dancers weaving in and out of the crowd.  One by one, my companions step off the wall,  Finding someone to dance with.  They walk away silently,  But their eyes whisper  "Thanks for the help."  Some come back,  Some never do.  Regardless, each one leaves some of themselves  And takes away some of me.  No matter how many are with me, though,  It always seems  That I'm the odd man out.  It always seems  That I'll be stuck on the wall for  But deep down,  Something tells me  That someday,  I'll have my time.  I smile and think  "When it's my turn to dance,  Will I miss where I am now?"

        emo trip    wow, if that trip was a movie, thats what i would call it.. it was probably the most emo 8 days ive ever had.....  so we left church at about 1 in the afternoon on friday, and took an uneventful trip down to louisville, so we could meet the other church to go down to florida with. we were sitting in this other chruch, waiting for everybody to be ready, so i went onto the bus to get some cashews. as i was coming off the bus, i saw her. far and away the most beautiful girl ive   ever   seen. light brown hair down to about the bottom of her shoulder blades, perfect shade of skin (just a hint tanner than my normal) and amazing blue eyes, just a little shorter than me (about taylors height), slim.. just completely amazing. too bad for me she lives in louisville.  anyway, i was lookin forward to spending the week with her, even tho at that point i didnt even know her name. so when we got to the hotel, i was expecting their group to get off the bus too.. oops. they went to a completely different hotel, and we werent gonna see them until thursday. so i was bummed about that for a while.. then we started to be busy and i didnt have enough time to conciously think about her. subconciously, yes..  wow, 35,000 people in one room.. that was some crazy shtuff. granted, the room was bigger than the entire roberts stadium complex, but still.. there were live bands, speakers, a whole interpretive dance show, and a drama every night. it was a really contemporary style of worship, i liked it a lot. lots of screaming..  the first day, i met some people from washington, that was cool. talked to them for a while.. i should make the point that this entire experience is a romantic's worst nightmare. thousands of girls, no chance of anything even remotely long-term. anyway...  it was monday that things started getting rough. there was the whole thing with the cell phone.. basically, id been wearing my swimtrunks all day, cuz i went swimming in the hotel pool that morning. so, i had the cell in the pocket of my trunks. so, after i came back from where the gathering was, i jumped in the pool. i was in the air, doing a cannonball, and i thought, "oh,  crap , theres a phone in my pocket." so, yeah, it was completely fried. then the others from my group started having problems with me.. i guess its my sarcastic/immature nature. anyway, i started talkin to a lot of people from far away who didnt know me.. i found some odd kinda comfort in meeting new people. it was pretty cool. speaking of comfort, i found one of the most peaceful, serene things i can do this week. i would go underwater in the pool, then blow some air out, and just kinda lay there on the bottom for a while. very calming...  the next day, i broke my cd player.. that was a fun day, tho. i accidentally got separated from my group, so i was by myself for like an hour and a half, and then some people from michigan invited me into their group. it was kinda weird, tho, cuz they reminded me of my 4 closest chick friends... 2 even had the same name. 1 was taylor, a lot like alyse, another, sam, was pretty much just like sam.. and then there was one that was a lot like rachel, a little like jen. it was cool, almost like being with really good friends. i kinda fell for taylor.. heh.. irony... anyway, some poetry came out of that. here it is..    Old Pain        You'd think that by now It wouldn't hurt anymore. Or at least that the pain Would have numbed a little.  But thats not the way things are. After countless replays Of the very same situation: Boy meets girl Boy falls for girl Girl doesn't feel the same, The wound is just as painful As the very first time.  What makes it worse Is the hope of success. For some reason, There's always a little chance That things could work, Just once.  So the hope builds Into a wonderful masterpiece Which goes up in flames As you realize once again That things can't work out.  But we can't ever give up, Because without hope, What's left?    next day.. the youth gathering ended, but our trip wasnt over. we went shopping at this strip mall in downtown orlando. i got a bunch of books and a new cd player.. the girl in our group got 5 bags of clothes. wow. anyway, that night we went to eat at the hard rock cafe, that was pretty cool. good food, good music. after that was awesome.. we went to this awesome improv comedy theater.  if you watch whos line, its the theater where wayne brady started his improv legacy. man, they were good.. i got on stage at one point, i was doing a moving body scene. for those of you who dont know improv, its where the actors can talk, but they cant move on their own, someone has to move them.. that was hilarious. man, fun shtuff.  that night, i was looking forward to waking up and finally seeing her again after 5 days. i even had a dream about her that night.. we slept too late, and the group we were going to be with the next 2 days (her church) came into our rooms to wake us up. so, the first thing i woke up to was her hand on my shoulder and her smiling face... that was probably the most pleasant dream ive had in years. the part i hate is that i actually woke up to an evil-sounding alarm clock. grg... oh well, i was still glad to be up so i could see her again. and there she was.. still amazing.  so we get to orlando studios, and im havin problems with my group again, so i tell my youth leader im gonna go with the others, making sure i was with her. so, i introduce myself to her group.. her name's natalie. very cool name. we went on the spiderman ride down there, it was pretty cool. there was a dj off to the side, so he kept people entertained thru the 90 minute wait. lmao.. the next thing we went on was a coaster called the flying unicorn. yeah, it was pretty puny.. but fun anyway. natalie got a headache after 2 rides, so i stayed with her as the 2 other guys in the group rode the coaster another 5 times. a little conversation, but i was mainly trying to describe my feelings in writing. tried 3 different poems.. wasnt satisfied with any.  we went over to the dr seuss place.. that was where i got my  awesome  "thing 1" outfit from cat in the hat. dont worry, guys, ill wear it to the back to school picnic. i promise.  that was also where i had my arm around natalie for like 2 seconds. if you asked me, it was a perfect fit...   anyway, we talked a lot later in the day. i found out shes gonna be a senior this school year. ok, i missed. i thought she was either going into high school or gonna be a sophomore.  oh well, so shes 17, it didnt dim my feelings for her at all. i got separated from that group after dinner, so i rode the hulk (oh yeah) and the fire part of the dueling dragons. that was some crazy shtuff. right before the dragons, i found my original group.. yeah, they thot the whole "thing 1" suit was pretty cool. for some reason, girls  love  it. i got like 15 girls screaming "thing 1!!" very admiringly.. it was cool. then we left for home, doin a little improv with my group.  at one point, i was talkin to my youth leader, and i quoted family guy...  lois: why did they make  you  president of the company? peter: maybe because i can name all 50 states in under a second. *makes a random, obnoxious noise similar to "angk!!!!!"*  funny shtuff.  next day, we head to cocoa beach. i didnt see natalie most of the day, she was shopping, and anyone who knows me knows that i wouldnt pass up the chance to be in the water, and thats exactly where i was, boogie boarding, body surfing, and wave hopping. it was really cool, cuz the waves were awesome but there was almost no undertow. at one point, i hopped like a 10 foot wave.. it was cool. very cool. plus... i saw cape canaveral!!!   yesssss!!!!!!!!   ive wanted to see that since i was like 3.  started writing about the way i felt for natalie on the way home... heres the stuff.   I don't understand how one girl can be so amazingly beautiful that words fail to describe her. Even for me, supposedly the "poet".. I've tried 5 different poems, and none of them have worked. At least with SJ, Taylor, and Sam, i could describe how i felt.. It's not that way with Natalie. Theres no feeling I can compare this to. But let me try to describe it... Every time I see her, I have to smile, because she's the only thing that makes me completely at a loss for words. As deep as my love is for the stars, I can still describe it. The thing is, after about 12 more hours, I'll never see her again. I really don't want that to happen.. Just my luck. And, as usual, it doesn't seem like she feels anything for me. If there was some way I could make one relationship work, this would be the one. I've gotta tell her how I feel, before it's too late. There's always hope.   Now comes the sad ending. i never told her how i feel.. and yes, i kept that in present tense for a reason. i just.. choked, and when i realized how big of a mistake i made, i almost cried. whats worse.. i didnt even really say goodbye. all i said was, "well, maybe i'll talk to you again sometime," and i was gone.  odd part.. i dont want to let this go. i want to miss her, because then i'll at least remember her. i don't want to forget about her... and more than anything, i want to see her again, and tell her all this. i dont want to ruin my memories, but.... what if...?   I close my eyes, And I see your face, If home's where my heart is, then I'm out place. Lord, won't you give me strength to make it through somehow.. I've never been more homesick than now. -Mercyme: Homesick

        to my friends        it feels weird posting after the last one.. that just seemed like the end-all, be-all of my blog. and if i think about it, there are decent reasons for that..  anyway, ive gotta say "thank you" to all my friends. you guys are always there.. always tryin to help me out of all this pain and confusion. you've totally carried me thru everything that i cant quite handle myself. just the simplest things help so much.. becky's "i feel bad cuz theres nothing i can do", sam's "love ya"s, everyone's "im still here"s and "youve still got me"s... even a "nice to meet you" can be comforting. thanks so much, everyone.. i love you all.

        unexpected results.. kind of..        freshman orientation today.. pretty cool overall.  less freshmen than i expected tho.  a lot of people i hadnt seen in a while.. i cant say much specific, at least emotion-wise, but i can say i wasnt feeling the best. theres stuff that involves specific people. let me add that foot powder burns when its in your eyes. thank you addison. i went to sleep first.. always a bad idea. so he takes his foot powder and pours it on my face.. little does he know, i sleep with my eyes open. so he drops the stuff on my face, and it goes straight to my eyes. i wake up and my eyes are burning uncontrollably, and addison and tommy are laughing. good cover, guys. so i start goin crazy on addison, throwin my shoes at him and stuff.. he got pegged in the nose by a sandal goin like 30 miles an hour. it was fun. yay revenge. wow, i did that post backward.. cool.  figures that the people i really want to be talking to arent online. oh well, schools comin soon, ill see them.  later.

        last days of freedom?        while at tommy's today, alyssa says "enjoy this, guys, this time next time this weekend, we'll be doing homework." kinda depressing. but true.. anyway, the picnic was today.. not a lot of people were there. pretty much the same crowd at orientation, but there were a few other people i got to see, which was cool.  some people i really wanted to see again..  wow, i need a private blog. something where i can really vent.. it kinda risks people knowing what i  really  feel about other people. hmm.. maybe ill get one soon, or maybe ill just write.  i need to finish mythology, bad. so i guess ill have to do that pretty quick..  later.

        i missed.    as a note before i start.. ive decided to ditch the idea of getting a private blog, and instead be incredibly blunt, sometimes even insensitive on this one. i trust those of you who read it well enough to do this, so feel happy. if i hurt anyone in any way, im sorry.  ok, now for the entry. i went to school today thinking it was gonna be a great comfort and a load off my chest. i was wrong. due to my retarted choice of clothes, (yes, im admitting it was stupid) the day got off on a bad start. then, when i realized that the press box had been opened  only  to juniors and seniors, i got a little upset. can we say "class discrimination"? but i eventually shrugged it off and just kept goin. i was doin ok in english, until taylor says "i love you, you're so psycho." thanks, taylor, but thats not what i was goin for.  this was the point that i realized that i'm everything i  don't  want to be. thinking about it.. i'm sarcastic, non-sensical, dim-witted, shallow, fairly weak, not the handsomest guy, a procrastinator, never really great at school, and in a lot of things, a coward and a failure. as much as i would love to, i'll probably never get into astronomy. 95% of the time, what im saying makes no sense to anyone, but of course it makes sense to me, so i just keep talking, oblivious to how stupid im making myself look.  none of these are qualities i want. i want to be sincere, well-spoken, smart, deep, strong, handsome, someone who gets things done on time and effectively, a great student, brave, and successful, a world-renowned astronomer, and perceptive of how people feel about me. most of all, i want to be accepted.  so, basically, who i want to be is the exact opposite of who i am. thats always a blast... doing the "emotional health scale" from the book today, i found out that my emotional health is "good, but can be better." hooray. thats what ive heard in every aspect of myself for my entire life: that i could be better. at least this thing stopped to point out the fact that even though it could improve, my emotional health was still  good.  everything else i hear is just "get better." and its starting to appear in my parents again..  wonderful.   social problems, too.. it seems like the vast majority of my female friends find me stupid and annoying, and seem to be avoiding talking to me. which there's likely good reason for..  speaking of girls.. this'll be a  great  year! (dripping sarcasm) so far, ive been on the wrong end of a relationship triangle and realized im completely not over a girl i had feelings for last year.. guess. kinda upset with tommy about this, too. he called one day for somebodys phone number and then goes "hey, do you like laura?" me: "yep." tommy: "well, in case you didnt know.. i like her.. and she likes me too.." me: *sounding unaffected* "ok" tommy:"i dont wanna offend you or anything, sorry." me: *sounding unaffected* its ok, dont worry about it.  honestly, i cant say that im not offended. maybe thats not the word, but i'm not entirely happy about it, since the exact same thing is happening with a different girl and he has yet another crushing on him. but whatever, i just gotta keep movin.  someone's gotta be alone, why not me?
