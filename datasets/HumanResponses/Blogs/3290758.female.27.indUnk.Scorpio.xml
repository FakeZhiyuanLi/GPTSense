						     &nbsp;  I meant meanest meanie I have run into in a long long time. Meanest, most hateful man. Wow. Why would an organist be so ugly? Maybe he is loveless and wishes he were dead. But it's still no reason to treat me like dirt. I came out of the meeting with the musical director of the church feeling like complete ass. This guy made me feel so bad in such a short time...people that have that talent really amaze me. And I tried to hold back the tears once I got out to my car, but they poured out anyway. Do I really want to sing at Maggie's wedding now? Can I stand to be anywhere near this man again? I've decided to confront him and ask him why he is being so hateful to me. How else will I know? I've called a couple of times and can't get him, so I'll keep trying. And if it means that I won't sing at the wedding then so be it. But there's no reason to treat me like trash when I am doing this as a favor to my friend and for such a happy occasion. I shouldn't feel like ass on that day. Or any day leading up to it.

						   This is true for two things today: 1.)Angel and 2.)Nursing school.  Just attended orientation today for my last semester in nursing school!!! :)  Angel's series finale begins tonight with part 1 of a two part finale. :(  I'll be watching tonight most likely. I've been trying to get started on the reading material for the class I attended today, but ohhhhh, it is so boring! I now know exactly what to read when I'm lacking in sleep. I've just awakened from the best two-hour nap I've had in awhile!  I certainly hope the reading for our leadership class is better than this material on community health nursing.   I also performed my last duties as the outgoing sga president of the nursing school today. I spoke at the orientation of the new nursing students. They don't make words that quite warn those students enough of the uphill climb, but hopefully they'll catch on rather quickly.  Oh, and I bought the shoes I'll need for Mag's wedding. Pretty, sexy, silvery, high-heel shoes. I hope I don't fall. :)  Off to try to read again now that I've napped.

						   Wow! What is wrong with people?! I just spoke with the accompanist that is playing Mag's wedding and he was the BIGGEST JERK EVER! Apparently he is the GOD of music. Gee, I can hardly wait to meet him and sing alongside his music. I won't go into details, but DAMN what an asshole. I'll be really glad when this wedding is over and this guy is out of my life forever.

						   I called him on Friday morning before heading back to Birmingham. Got voicemail, just as I did the two times I tried him in December. No word as of yet. No call back from him. I can only assume this means that he is not interested in my friendship.   Certainly cuts deep to realize that. I believe it's going to take time to sink in; that he truly isn't interested in having me in his life. After the fun we had so many years ago, the music, the river, the days I'd skip school and we'd hang out. I remember him so fondly. With such love. Not that I could tell him that directly, but I'm sure he read it in my eyes back then. And that's fine. I'm glad he knew how I valued him.  Funny how life is generally the opposite of what I desire when it comes to such situations, though. But I have to hope this is fate. Fate has been good to me in many ways, and I do believe in it; that things happen for a reason. Like moving to this place, for instance, and meeting a guy that has turned out to be one of the kindest and closest friends I know. But I'd have never moved here if it weren't for the problems that arose while I was living at home. So you see, I have to believe in fate.  But back to the call.   I do wish he'd return my call...this guy from my past. He - well - he's unforgettable. Even when I haven't thought about him for months, he'll show up in my dream or a song or a place will trigger a memory of him.   But logic tells me this one is not the answer to my fairytale. Hell, if he can't return a call...what am I thinking to still remember him lovingly? Silly girl. Silly, misled romantic with hopes beyond what the truth holds in front of me. I mislead myself. And wonder why I am crushed in the end. Hah. How foolish.  But yet part of me still wonders, "What if...?"

						   This is the first post to my new blog. A short one, though, as I'm running late to try on a bridesmaid dress for Maggie's wedding. Eeep! Only two weeks till the wedding. I certainly hope I fit into that thing after my recent bout of chocolate binges. Gotta run. More later!

						   &nbsp;  I want a love I can feel.  That's the only kind of love I think is real.  Don't want to be going by something I heard.  Oh baby, actions speak louder than words.  &nbsp;  I want a love that is mine.  In the rain it's always sun, sun, sunshine.  A love to keep me warm when it is cold.  The kind of loving that will never grow old.  &nbsp;  Don't you know I want a love?  Don't you know I want a love?  Don't you know I want a love?  Don't you know I want a love?  &nbsp;  I want a love I can feel.  The kind of loving you could give to me.  The kind of kisses that will make me melt.  The kind of loving that will really be felt.  &nbsp;  Don't you know I want a love?  Don't you know I want a love?  Oh baby, don't you know I want a love?  Don't you know?  Don't you know?  &nbsp;  &nbsp;   A Love I Can Feel,  &nbsp;  urlLink  John Holt

						       Thank goodness for my silly neighbor and our Arby's excursions. Hey! And thank goodness for Arby's COUPONS! Oh yeah! Can't beat a 99 cent jamocha milkshake!!   I have such fun with him. I'm fortunate to have moved to these apartments or I never would've met him. Such a good friend. But ya know, these apartments are SO DAMN LOUD!   It's going to be a good day when I can move to a quieter place. Come on December!!!

						     &nbsp;  Don't choose me because I am faithful.  Don't choose me because I am kind.  If your heart settles on me, I'm for the taking.  Take me for longing or leave me behind.   I would be, for you, a fire in a rainbow,  I would be, for you, an opening door.  Time and hard lessons are one kind of wisdom.  Try to forget them or love me no more.    I'm not asking your heart to believe me.  I'm not asking for promise or pledge.  Whatever the answer, it's yes that's the question.  I am the fool dancin' over the edge.    Don't choose me because I am faithful.  Don't choose me because I am kind.  If your heart settles on me, I'm for the taking.  Take me for longing or leave me behind.    urlLink   Alison Krauss     Take Me For Longing

						     &nbsp;  It is thrilling how talking with someone can spark new energy within me.  And I know it's not just me. It's a shared energy.   I've noticed that it can arise out of one encounter.  And that it builds or fades as the encounters multiply.   Conversing with someone can go either way, really. It makes the process a gamble. I wonder about things such as: How long can the interactions go on between two people before the energy is depleted? Or the image is shattered?   Responses lead down various paths of communication. One person can provide all of the correct responses, in turn making me feel glorious about him. Meanwhile another person, just as nice, may converse with me in such a way that makes me uncertain of his intentions. But this can happen with few visible differences between the two conversations. Just the small things that occur throughout the course of the communication. Small hints. Reactions. Questions.   But the one with the correct responses is intoxicating. I'm sure you must know what I mean. It's beautiful to find someone that doesn't offend. A person that mixes charm with legitimate conversation.   I could go on. But this is enough pondering for now.  I'm just thankful for this energy now. Positive, happy energy.  But I must get some sleep.

						     &nbsp;  Taking myself apart.  Struggling for a glance.  The depths of me are puzzling.  Should I take the chance?   What I want melded  With obligated "need".  Creating indecision twixt  Choices tempting me.   But better that I risk the future  So I might live right now?  What pain it causes to confront  That both bring sacrifice.

						   &nbsp;  Been so busy with school that I haven't been able to blog here like I wanted to. Nearing the end of nursing school. Graduate in August finally. So ready to finish. Of course, I'll probably take a chem. class this fall even though I should just take it easy. Who knows. I'd like to replace some of my old bad grades with some much better ones. Just for my own happiness. And because a grad program may look at those old grades and wonder if I could hack it in a program. But I really could use a break.   Finally going to have a somewhat free weekend this weekend. It'll be nice.  Hanging out with M &amp; J, plus their friend that's coming in town for the weekend. Hoping we go for pizza or sushi. Mmmm.   And OF COURSE going to see Spidey 2 with Mom, Dad, &amp; sis if we can get tickets this weekend. Woo hoo! Love me some Spidey action.   Otherwise, just studying. And chatting online. In fact I've made friends with someone online and have been chatting quite a lot recently with him. Hoping it's a real friendship because I like him, but of course only time will tell.   For now, that's all the update I have. Now back to your regularly scheduled schedules.
