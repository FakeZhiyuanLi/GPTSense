        In life, we are all bound to be hurt by certain memories, feeling or thoughts,even by people.ETC. Commonly, it's what the most common yet sacred thing that leaves a scar deep enough in us.{"Relationship."}Everyone is given a special innate ability,and it's all real up to us on how one interpret it. Being empath at times, flashes and thoughts of emotion do seek out for me.It hurts.Really. When the first light was shone out of the dusty cloud that seems to shroud every single negativity within,True feeling's also being spurred out in search of those who are hurt.Deep and subconsciously. It's to heal them.Certain phrase of our lives do make an impact on us,especially our love's not being reciprocate back.But deeply, there lies a Will.A Will to both love and care, and to protect the ones from all danger, always lingers between our inner sense.  *Have you ever felt hurt when the ones you really hope for's hurt? *Have you ever felt pains from the ones whom you hope for? *Have you ever had a sudden urge to really hug and tell the ones you hope for, the 3 sacred words? *Have you ever had a sudden urge to "save" them when trouble brews? Well, I have. All this experiences are what's present in every single human. ~There lies a golden 'lock' deep in one's heart.It is what it is to find the real 'key' and that's to release the passion and desire within and send forth to the ones you really hope for. Flowing with it, comes along 'pain' and 'tears'.It's hard to avert it,but for as long as you know, there always lies a pair of hand out there, waiting to help you up and giving you strength.To move on. My life was filled with every different possible emotions and feelings for you can ever imagine.* There is a boy,a boy with extraordinary life. Yet,he has found the right key,to say. But sadly,it's a key that seems impossible to hold. From then on,there's always memories and flashes about this unique girl and the most important phrase that keeps him holding on :"There's always hope as nothing's impossible." Up till this very moment,this very time,this very month, this very day,this particular boy still preserve the urge to protect,to love and care for 'her'.And for one thing he hopes to get this to her ears:   Cry if thou will, but stand up once again from where you have fallen and lead a whole new life,with light and transformations for thou's greatest good and highest joy.It is what it is,and what it is to be.

      Every phrase of life leaves behind a foot step for Reflection and rememberance.Dont think about the past but focus on the present as it concerns the future.It's ain't wrong to think of the olden times{past}, but remember,it should only act as a lesson learned, and not a regret. We all have a pair of eyes, it is what it is to look far beyond the superficial, and deep into the silence Heart of others.That's the true Way of understanding them, their beauty and bright perspective. Beauty is indeed in the eye of the beholder. A Phrase of Advice," don't ever let Regret devour you".Sometimes, we underestimate or even overlook the importance of some people in our presence.The true values will then only surface when the one is gone...forever.And deep down, we all know that certain things when gone, is never going to be back.Even if it is, the once warm yet familiar bond will change,perhaps to certain extent that's impossible. Every one of us is special and unique in certain way,each of us contains innate gifts that's waiting to be awaken and embrace.Thus, find yourself.Your 'True Self', don't let time flies anymore.Grab It. You Will. We have our own life to walk,and this once ina life time opportunity should be handle with pride,besides Dreams and ambitions are waiting for us to catch with 'them'hence,all the more we should bring out the best in ourself. Treasure all those that's true and important to you. Cherish the times spend with them. Remember, Don't let regrets and sorrow devour you..Take care. It is what it is and what it is to be...

      Dreadful things often happen during period of uncertainty.Well, just received some news that it's up at it again.It is often some miscommunication and misconception that actually give spark to this" Trouble Fire".I mean, look friends, there's always a solution for all these seemly unsolvable problems.Indeed indeed, gone are the days when "FRIENDS" got together.Perhaps some of us need a break, a break from one another?certainly. The situation around here just got better a little.but, it seems to me that they have just being their once again trouble journey.Why?. Reflect upon the great times. You know what I mean.

      Have you ever had the feeling with someone who seems distant from you yet there lies a invisible but deep,strong friendship, to the extreme extent? Believe it or not, this case of relationship do exist. It's pretty much magical to really accept this bond as part of you.I mean,you do not seem to have anything to do with him/her,yet Your heartbeat accelerate whenever something's amiss, that at the same time, concerning him/her.Perhaps even to the extent of shedding tears base on the smallest mishap that could ever possibly befall on him/her.It's a warm and strong emotion down there, but do not let these theory lead to the misconception.[supposingly if both are of the same gender]It's really there, deep down that this pure friendship do lingers. Well, but as they say, not all fairy tales end with a positive ending. At certain times,things do change a little, that just because of this little minor change, it might possibly cause depression due to the fact that the invisible friendship's dimishing. That is why, people feel  down out of the blue. Both positive and negative influences are out there in the world awaiting for us to explore,just imagine, should him/her walk towards the negative sector, and for example take up the art of smoking,What would you feel? But of course, heartbroken!{with the heartbreaking level to the maximum}Once more, theres no reason for this.Actually there is, but it's base on the pureness status of the friendship between both of you. The purer it gets, the more excruciate the pain feels.

      Yes, "Procedures" certainly are still fine this days.Well, but one particular arising issue seems to threaten the peace and serenity around here a little. Disappointments between friends? Why do such things exist.Perhaps, there in this time, still a solution?.Disagreements and disputes seems to be soaring all around that =|once familiar area of our lives|=.[You know what I mean]Maybe there still some light for all of us? ~certainly there is~. why should the same kind turn against each other in a both unfavourable manner? Please,calm down, it's only turning out to be a lose-lose situation. Have we all forgot those great times we had? The memorable feelings and thoughts?. I hope not so {but it may jolly well proved me a little wrong.} Let's get back to the golden days.There might be different sortings of "groups" and people just simply obtracize those who are against them or something, and honestly, this doesn't feels good. As a matter of fact, this case 's still existing till today.With the only simple reason, that would be, one unable to take notice of this situation. Will there be a tomorrow for all of us?[Think for it]

      It's just another boring day.Things still goes the same way.Nothing much.Well, there's one little tinky winky thing that actually marks today.Ask me? That would the oral version of Geography memory test.Well, guess that was so "nice" of the teacher to actually think such method to implement.Anyway, guess what? I flaunk my math test again, as usual.Honestly,I belong to the anti-mathematic organization. Perhaps the effort wasn't high enough. hello? Anyone care for a counseling for me?  It's really terrible to received the 25/80 paper first thing in the morning when it is supposed to be wonderful for me.In the end, the result hit me like a bolt of blue.Unexpected! But it wasn't that bad afterall,I mean at the very least, the lowest score wasn't me.{ Ok, trying to optimist around here.} Minutes after that devastated period in the morning, well, my spirit seems to've astral projected to the other dimension, leaving with only a depressed smile. Friend? He 's wonderful[guess?]Not only did he not gave me a weird look due to my "excellent" result,instead,words of encouragement reached my ears.He's really one of the friend that me, really treasure and cherish.Alright, his words and warm touch gave me strength and it actually lifted my spirit! Wonderful! Cheers to him!Thanks a lot.Currently, This 25/80 boy's trying to get out of the A.M.O.  [well, that's just being optimist]

       Well, actually it's kind of weird that certain thoughts come searching for you.Maybe it's regarding the future? Different people really do have different perspective point of views. Sometimes, we do have dreams to realize and that would means starting from now? "Stories" emerged from different phrase of our lives and some of them do cause great emotions emitting out of our mind/heart/soul.Maybe that's what they called "experience". Tears and happiness, pain and fear, Cries and laughter, all of'them'once came up to us , guess it's time to have psychological preparations from now for the "Time".

        ShadowLand my feets are on, Boundry seek no barrier fond. Dawning Light i seek no more, Misty Dark 's end for all? Heed no soul my heartache be, Who's always there for me?? Verbal for they only knew, Heart's content ever conseal. Trouble cauldron brews for me, Lonely path i walked through free. Questions ask of me I say, "Why is always in this way?!" Tears and blood and fear conseal, heed no voice my mind should feel. Orbs of path by vision's array, Pain no more,my fear shall sway. Golden dawn my path there is, Challenge expel through my Fist.

      Time have clearly shown the truth, before my mind's eyes. A truth that implies simply only on one particular issue.Well, at the very least, I do know there's someone out there.Maybe it's better for me to be in this way for a period of time. ="It's alright to leave me out,it's alright to neglect me"= , but have you ever experience this? So what if you did?, have I not?!All "you" does, is come searching for me with all those inner cries, and you know that there's surely someone there for you.You know something, a thing which is always conceal within? I 've never voice out any grievance! Impressive, no one seemly even care about this.Good bye. Gone are the days.Good bye!

      Are they actually even there? So, all those words and phrases are  whole lots of boof?!Yes,things changed but not till the extent of this situation!Gone are the days, at the very least, there's still someone for me to hang on. Perhaps that's just me, the way my life was meant to be.There are ways indeed to solve this matter, but are there anyone who cares? "We"[refering to a huge amount of people] talk about everythings under the sun often, and yet at times miseries from you[refering to individuals] could be heard.Have anyone thought about mine? Even if there is, do they even care to pour your feelings out like I do? There's not much time left for eveyone,so it's better for me to be left alone.For a while.Sorry for any inconvenience cause.Accept it, the way it works.

      Under the scorching sun, walking about aimlessly, that's how the day passed. Throughout the time of 13 hours,my mind was constantly reflecting upon those abstract questions. =Do they really seem to be the ones that knows you inside out?= =Are they the ones who actually really go through thick and thin with you?= Sometimes, in our lives, I mean OURS, we tend to be hurt, but do they, what you termed as friends, feel your pain that's excruciating? even from afar, it might not work.Some of them would just reply you" Dont't dwell too much on this particular issue" or even " things are fine" Have they not thought about the real pain that seems to be conseal within you?. Maybe it's just normal to them. isn't it? I might have failed in some of the above, but at the very least, I thought about it, with the right state of mind. Certain issue's too much diffcult to express verbally,even between  bossom friends. Now, this stage requires the telepathic skills.[but looks like nothing seems to work out fine.]This is how the way it works, for me.{nothing much to express. For the simple reason, I've already gotten used to it}

      Again, a new discovery on me. After much observations on the surrounding,finally a almost accurate conclusion's out.Indeed, I am just a free flow-er.A person who "flows around easily, with not really a group to finally ground the feets on. It's pretty much normal for me as I 've got used to it, lets say since the beginging of march? yes.Companies of friends are always within my area of vision, and honestly, this doesn't felt good. Perhaps these are the reason to solve the self contradic question impost on ourself,:"Why Am I so down suddenly, or recently?" As they say,life still flows.Of course it's ever flowing but with the only exception, That is being a Free flow-er in all walks of life. My everyday process was seemly quite peacful.[that's a good thing to celebrate.] why? Why is it happening on me?, really, is it the only reason for me being weird? as in unable to blend in? Being a optimist, I would certainly never allow myself to fall in a never ending pit of ALMOST excruciating pain.  Indeed, The days are fine  and wonderful experiences are often around, so much in being a epicurean of fine daily simple food and laughter.

      Part1=The passing of time seems to inject some sense into me.For the only thing that's what I am talking about. Yes, recently, indeed the "strife" have been unknowinly resolved,but there still lies a hidden emotion in everyone.  Part2=Remember those time when some of us lost our most precious belongings? Well I did recover those things, but with the addition of a feeling, "heartache".=Why do you have to lied to me for not taking 'them' with you last year?= Things are often out of our expectation.The news did really hit me like a bolt from the blue.Why is the prime suspect you?!! Please!, don't make me have a second view on you. Enough of this.  Part3=Bonds between friends seems to be dimishing as well.Days are no longer the same anymore, Not as close as ever and those telepathic skills are slowly grinding to a halt.Why?!
