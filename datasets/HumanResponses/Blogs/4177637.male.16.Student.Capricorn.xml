      First full week of school. I seriously need to consider getting my locker switched. It's currently at the end of the 200 hall towards the commons, and I'm convinced it's impossible to get anywhere using the 200 hall. I'm going to credit the traffic in that hallway partly on stupidity and obesity. First of all, you have people who stand in the  center  of the freakin' intersections, talking to their friends as if they wanted the entire school to know what they wore to so and so's house. Wow. Really? That's so interesting. Now, move you retard. Not to mention the fact that a lot of people are so large, they take up the entire hallway and roll over everyone else. Please lose weight in consideration of our safety? Thanks. One day this week, I was at my locker and this enormous black guy just shoves me aside so him and his 3 chins could get through. Well, I obviously didn't do much since I really didn't want to be sat on, but I sure did take comfort in the fact that he'll probably be bagging my groceries a few years later anyways. Of course, he's probably an idiot too and will end up putting the eggs on the bottom. Damn.  Really, if anyone wants to switch lockers with me and you have one in the 300 hall (or even the other side of the 200 hall) I would pay you. Not really. But I'd be thankful.

      Yep, it's 10:50 Sunday night. Which means one thing: I get to attend 5 consecutive days of Hell Hole fun at school. On a brighter note (yes, not kidding), I just checked out my horoscope for today:   (Capricorn) Your personal thermostat is turned all the way up, which can only mean one thing:  passion . You'll see it in everything you do and hear it in every word you speak. You won't be the only one!   Therefore, tomorrow, I'm going to be   passionate   about learning! And see what it says? I won't be the only one! (Horoscopes are never wrong). Kickass, who wants to   sizzle   with me over some Pre-Cal? Mmm... oh baby, I'm hot just thinking about it.   Ok, I realize some of you may say that the horoscope won't apply since it's actually for today. But since I'm not reading tomorrow's, this one is going to carry over. So screw you. Hah.

      Well, I found out this morning that Bellsouth is gay (well, actually I've known that for awhile) and there's something wrong with my DSL connection on their side. Soo, it's really slow and I can't really do anything more than "surf the web". Which is really such a dumb phrase if you think about it, surfing is done on water; furthermore, spiders don't surf on webs, they crawl... so, technically that's what it should be. Although that's pathetic too... how about "click-on-random-website-in-search-of-something-interesting-in-hopes-that-you-don't-hit-a-porn-site." Or do hit one. Depending on your preference.  Anyways, I tried to think of what people do on the internet who don't play games. So, first I went to get my daily horoscope (I'm certain this is done alot) even though I think horoscopes are the epitome of crap. But regardless, here's mine for today:   (Capricorn) - Turn off your cell phone, beeper, or anything else that might distract you from paying attention to one particular person. Every now and then, even your diligent sign gets to take an evening off.   Oook. Since my cell phone's already turned off - to save batteries - I'm wondering who I'm supposed to be paying attention to. I think I finally came to the original conclusion of "horoscopes are pieces of crap intended to waste your time". Yes. That's it. I win.

      Not. First day of school, I stayed up until 11 PM doing homework (mainly Pre-Cal), although that could have been partially credited to the fact that I went to fencing from 5-8. Second day, though, I stayed up roughly the same time - doing again, Pre-Cal and Statistics. Guess I shouldn't have been surprised that I got a crapload to do this weekend as well.  The usual enthusiasm that normally comes during the first week of school was basically non-existent for me. After going to Taiwan and Japan over the summer, going back to school to see my fellow classmates - most of them having grown dumber over the summer (which I didn't think was possible) - really didn't seem to hit the spot. And besides the massive homework attacks, nothing eventful has occurred as of yet. Unless you count Ms. I. Johnson's grammar assessment that raped me today:  "What is a complement and list and describe the different kinds" Uhh... 10?  To top off my wonderful week, my internet's become really slow for some strange reason. Swell.

      I finally got around to uploading the pictures from my digitial camera to my computer. Most of the ones I'm about to post here are from a trip to a waterpark somewhere in the southern/middle portion of Taiwan, which was the only time I left Taipei during the summer (except of course, to go to Japan). The two people with me are the college students that pretty much took me around and kept me company since I can't read the language and probably would have gotten myself killed had I tried to wander around on my own, plus it would have been extremely boring without company around my age. (You'd think I was still in school with that South Aiken shirt and the bookbag).   urlLink http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v425/Spets1/PICT0477.jpg    urlLink http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v425/Spets1/PICT0504.jpg  This was after a very wet ride (not a sexual innuendo -_-)   urlLink http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v425/Spets1/PICT0467.jpg

      This is pretty interesting  urlLink http://www2.memlane.com/jmilner/stairwaybackwards.htm   Get a chance to hear some interesting things when particular parts of songs are played in reverse. I especially enjoy the Britney Spears one ^^

      School starts Wednesday, August 11, 2004 at 8:00 AM EST. And I will be there because I am forced to attend school by our wonderful South Carolinian government (which on a local level consists of several old, old men who are on the brink of death yet rendered with the responsibility of managing our everyday lives - democracy owns us.)  So anyways. Today, I prepared for my first day of school by purchasing some very crucial items from Staples such as binders, folders, and paper. Then, I have the fortune of bumping into my Spanish teacher while in one of the aisles, and you know, the usual conversation about going back to school begins and ends and we both say good-bye and part ways to hunt down various school supplies. Well, guess who I bump into while in the check-out line? Nothing like seeing the same person twice within a 10 minute time frame. Having already squandered the usual polite conversation, we're stuck feeling really awkward and looking around trying to ignore each other's presence while the old guy ahead (probably a member of the city council) has trouble with one of his purchases. Finally, though, as if someone felt pity for me, we're all spared further embarassment when a new check-out line opens.  Moral of the story: Old people suck.

      I'm bored. So I made this. To cure my boredom. Which is a good thing.
