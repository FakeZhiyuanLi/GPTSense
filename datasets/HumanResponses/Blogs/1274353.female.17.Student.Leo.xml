      Jenny kissed me when we met, Jumping from the chair she sat in; Time, you thief, who love to get Sweets into your list, put that in! Say I'm weary, say I'm sad, Say that health and wealth have missed me, Say I'm growing old, but add, Jenny kissed me.         ~Leigh Hunt~

      That's where I went today with my Mom, one of the best days I've had since coming back. I love the city. I love that city. So, we headed down (compliments of my driving, naturally) and after visiting my Great Grandma at her "older-people's home" (which was so nice, she's such a sweetly forgetful queen) we headed up to the heart of Toronto, via Queen St. East. Then drove by the university I want to go to next year...if I'm accepted. And around that area, checking out possible houses and stuff, since I won't be living in residence (that university has none) and I won't be living at home (commuting is NOT an option). I was so excited to see where I'll hopefully be in a year. I'm so excited to start "life"! (or mine at least) And then we went up to Spadina and Kensington area, which is one of my favourite parts of Toronto (plus the Harbourfront, memories...and Queen Street West), checking out stores/deals/whatever. We found an excellent wok for none-other-than Japanese cooking, and an excellent knife just cuz we need a new one. Then we just wandered in and out of stores on Spadina, which is incredibly close to my aunt's condo, and my cousin's, but he's in Yokohama right now. We also drove past my (different) uncle's house and cafe. My family is awesome. Anyways, we checked out some sweet textile stores, and Asian food stores. Not to mention, my favourite, a Japanese store, with everything shipped straight from there. It was crazy to walk in and see all the products, edible and not, that I'd spent the last year familiarizing myself with, it almost seems more 'normal' to me than some Canadian foods. So we bought some, POCKY, and continued on our way...which lead to a wicked art store, where I bought a cute little palette, cheap but handy. This summer I want to experiment with oils. I've already got some books from the library and we'll see how it goes. Anyone want to volunteer to model? Actually, I work better from photos anyways. I can't stop thinking about university, but I'm not even accepted...I haven't even applied, wait, not even in Grade 12...aaaah, all this excitement energy better be focused into making a sweet portfolio. And if I don't get accepted at Choice A, then I'll hopefully get accepted somewhere else. I can be a light anywhere. Righteo then, sometimes I wish I had a British accent, or Australian, like back in the day...oh well, I could always pick it up again when Australians visit my house this summer (old old friends, I'm so excited for that too!).  EXCITED IS MY THEME. IN LIFE. (imoto e, sore wa watashitachi no jodan desu!)   and now for the reason I titled this post what it is titled. After being in a single culture country for so long, I appreciate Toronto's (insert adjective here that I can't think of cuz all that's in my head is Japanese-tatoeba kono tango: hontou) multiculturalism. I was in a store where the Asian (Korean to omou) storekeeper was conversing with an European (I thought she was Scandinavian) customer, both talking in English, both with thick accents from wherever they were from, both understanding the other perfectly and the whole situation seeming so natural to me. We take it for granted cuz we grow up with situations like that. I really appreciate our spectrum of cultures. I am a part of it. EXCITED!

      is the day on which I will finally see my brother! Who I haven't seen in a year, might I add. Yaaay, except he's only home for 5 days before he leaves for his summer courses. He leaves on the 6th day. I knew it last year, but it didn't seem for real till this year. My "full family" life is over. From now on (well, last year on) my brother is constantly going to be away save for holidays. And this is my last year at home, but I'm so excited to get out, no disrespect, but having life away from home is awesome. (see last year). And we're going to be all over the globe. Cuz that's how I want to be, always traveling. This is my list: Japan (mou ikkai); Europe-including England, Scotland, France, Italy, Greece, Spain, Sweden; and I want to go to Papau New Guinea, and Fiji. We'll see how many I actually get to. Oh yeah, and Korea (as in South).  Lalala, today was productive. It's always the productive days that make me feel the fullest at the end of it. Tomorrow will be productive also. And on Sunday: church! Second time this year...this month... I always post at night. I wonder if I blogged in, say, the morning, if I would have a different attitude...less "night-y"? Omoshiroi! haha I can't keep a steady stream of thought, I'm going to bed. Oyasumi nasai.

      I just watched a program on CBC called "Screw the Vote"...some random guy who went all over Canada to ask 18-34 year olds why they don't vote. The number one reason being that "our votes don't count". (Note: by saying 'our' I mean 'their' because I won't be 18 till August...unfortunately). So, they had some interesting things to say. One girl/lady from Montreal (an artsy type) said if she was American she would vote, just because she'd either really like or really hate Bush. She would have a reason to vote. The American President, regardless of your personal opinion of him, causes a reaction in most people, thus creating the desire to either support or not, vote or vote for someone else. Canada's PM isn't known for being especially charismatic or anything, just kinda a middle-of-the-road guy. If he was someone who caused reaction in people, (ex. Pierre Trudeau), he/they would have more younger people voting. to omou (I think). That is one of my opinions on this, not that I can affect anything until August, after the election. This makes me want to run for something, just to try to change the system. Maybe one day I will, after I become legal age...

      A year late. I guess you're right, Dan, in saying a year late related to what. There is no late, as long as there is no comparison, and I guess I'm actually graduating "on time" but just a different time. Sweet.  If I hadn't gone to Japan I would be missing alot of experiences. Not to mention that's where I decided what I want to "pursue" after graduation. ARt. I'm so excited for life right now. Life in general. This summer will be sweet, next year doing grade 12 with sweet classes, and I'm so hyped for applying to university, and hopefully being accepted at the one I want to get into. And excited for going back to Japan, hopefully in 2 years. And excited for getting a job. Excited about being back with [Canadian] friends. My family, excited to see my brother on Monday (getting back from Scotland). Excited. But why this excitement? Why is everything so peachy keen? I will tell you. It's because I'm excited about God. He's the One who has given me so much peace about my future goals (art...). He's the One who has given my life purpose, and a purpose I'm excited about. Like a cycle. Everytime I hear a worship song, I am just excited because I know He has a purpose for me, my time here on earth. And I'm so excited to be back having good times, good conversations, with my Christian friends. Encouraging each other, questioning, praying for each other, laughing; this is what I missed in Japan. This is a real life. And I know it's just begun.   watashi wa mada juunana sai desu, kore made wa hajime dake. kore kara wa tanoshimi desu yo.

      This was the first year I've ever picked courses and not had a conflict. I appreciate that. So, the verdict is...no commencement. Until 2005, that is. I can't take English during summer school cuz I have my G2 test on the first day of the classes, and I can't transfer Japanese credits as easily as once thought. Apparently, if you go on an exchange out of "free will" (as opposed to being "forced"?) your credits don't count for much, unless you have some sort of test score or other internationally recognized official document saying that you can speak another language. So, luckily, I wasn't counting on those credits to graduate, and it looks like I'll just have to paste my picture to the wall beside all your graduating photos, and have my real photo a year later. Oh well. But the happy news, is that I love my classes next year. I love school... Sememster I:  -Drawing/Painting  -Writer's Craft (online)  -World History  -Biology Semester II:  -Weight Training  -English  -Visual Art  -Chemistry And all I have to do is actually hand in my 40 hours and I get my diploma. And a Gifted Certificate. And then I commence. A year late.

      I type, post and write in this blog just because i like to have somewhere to put all my thoughts (of the moment). So, it could be assumed that I type not really caring who is or who is not reading this. But that strange part is, after I find out people are reading it (like the Itariajin, - yoroshiku - and other friends of mine), I will probably post more often just because I am entertained by the idea of an audience. I am not sure if that actually is ironic, but it seemed ironic a few moments ago.

      Wow, the more I talk to people I haven't seen in a long time, the more I'm glad to be back and around them. Wow, the more I talk to people I haven't seen in a long time, the less I'm glad to be back and around them.  People have changed, though they may not have noticed, it's the abscence that highlights the differences in now and last June. I never saw a gradual process, just the 'before' and 'after'. And then there are the people who have stayed the same. And then there are the people who just make me laugh and smile so much that I can't imagine how I didn't cry myself to sleep every night in Japan.

      that's what she said, but in english "a bird pooed on me [my head]". some people just make me laugh...charity...these are the reasons it's great to be back.   not to mention seeing a strange "lion" today. why do all "lions" have manes? that seems to be a cross-continental pattern. long beach. utsunomiya. ajax. everywhere.   AND, Charity was ever so helpful in brainstorming how I could graduate from high school, either this year or next. a) get Japanese credits transferred, take ENG 12 during summer school. commence. b) get Japanese credits transferred, take one semester of next year. work. c) get Japanese credits transferred, take one semester of next year. enter unversity during the winter semester. d) get Japanese credits transferred, take ENG 12 during summer school. commence. do the rest of Grade 12 next year.  I think I'll do some stirring and get Japanese credits transferred, perhaps take English in summer school, and then do at least one full semester of grade 12 and then the second semester as half days only, so I can work in the afternoons (the root of that being that university equals dollars). We'll see what guidance has to say about any of this. Tomorrow.

      Which was amazing, to be back within my "God Family", seeing people that I know are sincere about growing closer to God and encouraging me to do so, but...there's always a but. Everything seemed exactly the same. The social cliques, the stares at 'strange' worship. While the church is a place to worship God freely and meet with other Christians, whose purpose it is to do God's Will, there is still so much humanity that it will always have faults, which is what separates us from God. However, I would really appreciate it if some of these people would grow up and see how petty their differences are.   And then --> take out the log from your own eye before trying to remove the speck of dirt from someone else's  I will never stop growing. (2)

      "...Do not arouse or awaken love until it so desires." I'm so tired of seeing people "go out", "dump", "see each other", "break up"..."waste"-ing time, perhaps.

      almost best friends, but the farthest possibility. itsumo waratta. itsumo. and now, we never laugh because we can't. i wish time wasn't, but since it is, i deal with what it brings. what is the most taisetsu? nani ga ichiban important? kangae ni, i know it doesn't matter, time will cause me to forget, or at least disattach myself. sukoshi zutsu, mainichi mo chotto. the more experience, the more complicated. but i'd rather have something to think about than nothing to know. mada warau yo, i am still laughing; we'll meet again.

      To make a long story short, concise and to-the-point: I will be away from Saturday, July 24th to an undecided date at the end of the summer. Maybe I'll come back for a week in August, still undecided.   I am going to Camp MiniYoWe! To be a camp counsellor for my 3rd year running. I am so excited, and I get to drive the van up (it's kinda "my car"). So that's that, and I hope to see some people at the end of the summer and if not...till commencement, and best of luck in university! or wherever the next chapter goes.   PS--> I turn 18 on August 17th! Think of me on that most delightful of days! PPS--> If you'd like you can send me a letter/note/postcard/card/anything in the mail to where I'll be (I'd smile) this is the address:      Jenny Nasmith (Tuxedo)      Girls' Camp      Camp Mini-Yo-We      1878 Muskoka Road #10 West - RR#2      Port Sydney, Ontario, Canada      P0B 1L0

      What an excellent weekend! As summer goes by, somewhat non-thrillingly, there are the times when you just need times of good times. This was one of those times. Driving a snazzy car, having some pretty great conversations, meeting some new people, being at the cottage, boating, tubing, laughing like mad with my sister, watching the stars, watching the lake, thinking, being with parts of my extended family, cruising back in the same snazzy car.  And my birthday is coming up...less than a month! The big 1-8, which isn't all that big, but I'd like to point out that I'm now 5'7" (170 cm) which makes me happy. Also, I'm going to be a bridesmaid! Other random news:   Wow, I suppose it seems all I can talk about is Japan, Japan, Japan...but after having Japan be my life for so long, it's strange to have that part cut out. However, I will be returning soon (a couple years?). Anyways, what I think is strange is how much I was looking forward to seeing all my friends when I got back to Canada, but how little I've seen any of them. I mean, I've said 'hi' to a bunch of people, but not really 'hung out' (for lack of a better term) or talked to them. This is a little saddening, because most of them are moving away this August/September and time is fleeting. So, hopefully I'll call some of you up soon, and we'll do something. Actually, maybe I'll have a party...  Lastly, I must say I must do some art for my portfolio. I keep having all these great ideas, as I fall asleep! I should start experimenting with some of them. After all these personality/intelligence strengths/what-have-you tests we did in various TAG and Careers class, I realize I do alot of plan and not much 'doing'. But tomorrow I will do. Good night.

      post. post-adventure. the opposite of pre. and that's all there is to it. stuck here in this endless web of suburbian ideals. can't we break out? it's already been done, but unfortunately not being done. when do i get to go back...the meeting of the NGC CEOs need to commence ASAP. and then some. sleep evades time and it all keeps passing. the drone of summer, the last of 17. all i can remember is the trip to the conbini. the surreal and ethereal mist of that one long moment that lasted 17 minutes and then i was back inside. who else was outside then? no one important. and as it fades it grows stonger, more intense. one person, and all rules broken. laughter cuts the silence, shatters it, and the pieces are dissolved. koko, watashi dake wa nihongo wakaru. nihongo dake jinai, nihon. sono koto wa jibun no desu, mada aru. all i want to do is speak swedish.   he has been left behind, to be met on the road ahead. he told me so. He will never leave me, nor forsake me.

      That's right! Sitting here playing on the computer of the Director of the Durham District of Young Driver's of Canada (he's late and the nice office ladies let me use it). And when he gets here, I am having a driving lesson...to refresh my once excellent driving skills! Yay! The office ladies are so cute, they just asked if I wanted a cup of tea! They are all so sweet. Well, back to playing on the director's computer! Haha.

      Awesome time.....party with barbeque (Canada size...can I make it?), fireworks at Kinsmen (hitting children/dogs with a soccer ball, but obviously, "not really"), hilarious friends, which obviously preceded the immense amount of laughter and on it goes. The not-really-but-kinda highlight: meeting random people who read my blog, because it's connected to Dan's? ...Hi Todd and Phil, whatever happened to YOUR sites? there's no link...not to mention props and all other things related to cool kids. And the hours of amusement from the ring tones. In Da Club.   and I haven't blogged for forever. Cuz I was at my cottage for a while and then just never got around to it really...busy doing not much of anything. It looks like the search for a job will be hopeless. Everyone I've talked (that's looking) hasn't found one, and everyone I've talked to that has one says there aren't any...like we just ran out of jobs? We'll see. All the more time to work on my portfolio, (oil painting? haha) so I can apply to OCAD and make my own clothes, as the story goes.   Tomorrow I'm going to cancel my G2 test (it's "on" Monday) and reschedule for a later date... I'm setting myself up to fail, I really think I will at this rate. But I'm going for a special lesson from YD tomorrow. Whoop dee doo! (that was meant sincerely, i love driving. haha)   So, about that portfolio...anyone have juice? Creative juice that is! I have some ideas floating around, but I need to catch them and then represent them, with mediums. Ah, I need to get some sleep, too much energy. Actually, I'm hungry. I want to change my blog colours...everything is so complicated! Haha!
