      Hi.  Man, what a Friday. I thought that I would have a pretty boring day sitting at home doing nothing, then all of a sudden I am frantic because most of my close friends were now staring at a major storm. Luckily all of my friends are safe. They have a lot of cleaning to do, but at least they are alive. I would be completely beside myself if anything happened to them. I still haven't been able to get in touch with my friends in Key West but I will try again tomorrow morning.  Okay, with that little bit out of the way I can talk about myself now. I was born a poor black child in Milton Florida (insert joke here). For you people that need a geography lesson, that's 20 miles east of Pensacola or 200 miles west of Tallahassee.  I am the youngest of 3 children. I was raised by my mother as I didn't have my father around for all of my childhood. My mother is a VERY independent person. My brother has autism, retardation, and non-hodgkins lymphoma and my sister was diagnosed with extreme diabetes and almost died, but was able to make it to my wedding. I have a very strong family. We didn't have much of anything, but we were truly loved.  My mom raised us well and also went back to school to get her degree in Social Work. Sometimes we had to take care of ourselves, but we understood the greater good in all this. What we didn't have in material possessions she made up in love. For that she taught me that there is good in everyone, even the worst of people.  People always tell me, "Well you don't  ACT  black...". What the hell does that mean? Most of my schooling was with white kids and I do have white friends, but just because I was among those surroundings that doesn't mean I wasn't raised by black people. I was raised that stereotypes are for idiots and you can be so much more if you just apply yourself and BE yourself. People act a certain way because they might think it's cool, or it might get them what they want. Believe me, acting "ghetto" would get me nothing in Milton, but just being "me" would get me a long way in life.  During elementary school I got good grades, was in the Gifted classes and since that was the case most of the kids I hung around during school were white. After school I had the kids that I played with in the neighborhood, but since we were near the projects we all didn't have much, but we all played together. My mom wouldn't let me play with some of the kids around because their parents either did drugs or they were just plain bad. At the time I didn't understand it, but now that I am older it's all clear to me. She wanted better for me and hanging around them wouldn't get me to where I needed to be in life.  In Middle and High School I was good in sports, but I figured it was easier for me to play an instrument, so I joined band. I picked up instruments pretty easy, but since there was a need for tuba players I played that and it stuck with me till this day. I was a pretty good baseball player and I even played spring football and wasn't a bad quarterback, but when it came down to what I wanted in life, I didn't want to use my strength I wanted to use my brain, so I stayed with band. It got me a full ride to Southern Mississippi and Alabama (I still don't know WHY I didn't take it), but I was waiting for Florida State to give me a look. I never got a scholarship, but I did get accepted, so off to FSU I went.  I could talk about my college years, but it would take at least a month of typing, so I'll save that for different stories off an on as the situation warrants.  Just to ramble more, but I think the main reason people gravitate around me is because I am nothing more. What you see is what you get and I am loyal to the end. It's an awesome responsibility being Toker, but I don't mind. Oh, and for you new readers Toker is my given name. My father's middle name is Toker as well. It's a family name passed down from the Cherokee in Oklahoma where my father's people are. I get kidded so much about the middle name because people either think my parents are hippies or that I am a complete stoner.  Black Hippies.....get real. And as far as being a stoner...don't even go there. Not even close.  Man, I could talk about so many things, but once my mind starts wandering, I tend to get angry, so I'll save some of that for even more ramblings later.  Well Law and Order: SVU is on so I am going to jet. I hope some of my ramblings are interesting to you and I'll be writing more and more as the days go on.   urlLink

      Good evening.  I just decided to get on for a bit and talk before I hit the hay. I might have a busy day tomorrow because of Bonnie....(I hope not)  Well I felt so good after starting this last night. I've been wanting to do something like this for a long time, but not had the courage to do it. It's kinda like doing it for the first time. You're going to be awkward and not know what you're getting yourself into, but after you're done and you sleep you feel SO much better... :)  Today was a pretty boring day at work. Everyone is on pins and needles because of this storm, but Tally always gets worked up over nothing. I am not even buying batteries or water or any of that crap "they' want you to buy. This place hasn't seen a real storm in like forever and tomorrow will be more of the same.  Talked online to my normal group of friends and also a new person that I met a couple Saturdays ago. She seems really cool. We really don't have any "deep" conversations yet, but maybe that's because I am not ready to give in yet.  I always give in...My friends can tell you that.  Didn't get a chance to much to talk to my really cool friend online. She probably was busy. I like talking to her...She really brightens my day. When I was really down back in October it was kinda like she was sent to me to bring me out of my funk. I owe her a lot, but she already knows that... :)  Sitting here watching Law and Order:SVU. I don't know why, but I really like the show, but I am a Law and Order junkie. This one is a repeat, but I still watch them religiously anyway.  Oh, I guess I was supposed to talk more about myself and let you into "my world", but I am too tired so maybe I'll save that for tomorrow. I just needed to clear my head before it hit the pillow.  Anyway, the "bong bong" noise just came back on so I better get back to the Idiot Box. It was nice writing tonight and I promise I'll write more tomorrow.  Peace.

      Hi.  I been looking at so many blogs and I've had so much to write that I decided that I am going to take a stab at this. I'm not going to tell an awful lot tonight because I just wanted to put something down so I wouldn't forget. I'll start writing more usually in the afternooon before I go home or maybe before I got to bed (Most of my best thoughts come out then)  Well that's it for tonight. As time goes on I will add more and more items and hope that you tune in....if not, it doesn't really matter in the end.  Toker

      Hi.  What a great wrestling show. After a great Beniot/Orton match, Evolution completely punked out Orton. It was refreshing for wrestling to go back to the old days when the beat downs came after a new champ was crowned. Looks like Orton will be turning into a good guy sooner than I expected...anyway back to my ramblings....  Well, I did it. I sent that email that I was talking about yesterday. It was something that I didn't want to do, but I felt it was needed. Like I said, I was tired of being blown off and either I will lose a friend or at least the lines of communication will start up again. We'll see.  When I do things it's either hard and fast or nothing at all. Life is way too short to beat around the bush. Now don't get me wrong, I am not blunt when it comes to people, but I don't like to play games. Before my divorce I was a lot different, because I was more about "we" and not "me". Maybe if I would have paid attention to "me" a little more back then things would be different. I doubt it.  Why am I talking about this? Well there is this girl that is a friend of mine. We met back in October while I was playing an online game during a work break (hope no one at work is reading this...) This one guy was hitting on her and I was basically trying to stir the pot and get them together, but then we ended up talking. We hit it off really quick and we started talking daily. She helped me so much after the divorce to realize that the world is not coming to an end and there is so much to live for. She showed me that the passion that my ex wife told me that I didn't have wasn't true. With that I started dating someone here at work and was able to show her passion that I thought was gone. Even though that work relationship didn't last I knew that I am still "good".  Not even seeing this person I knew that this was someone that I could fall for easily...and guess what..I did. Well I figured, nothing ventured nothing gained so I let her know how I felt. Thinking that a rejection was soon to come I was pleasantly suprised that she didn't completely reject me. I did understand that there was a distance thing between us and she also started to becoming interested in a guy that lives near her. But I would rather have her in my life as a friend or nothing at all. Maybe someday we'll finally get together. It could be at her wedding or it might be on a trip she comes to Florida or I go out to Oklahoma. All I know is that she has done something for me that not to many people have done. She's really made me happy and for that I love her....(see I told ya I would write about you..) So like I said, I do things either hard and fast or nothing at all. If you don't take a risk in something you can never really know what you're made of.  Well enough mushy shit...time to bitch....  What a f**king long day at work. No only have I been here since 6:45 this morning, when I went to lunch I saw the girl I used to date....ugh. I don't know if she saw me, but I saw her. Sometimes I wonder what I even saw in her. I really cared about her and I was starting to have really good feelings about persuing something further, but I think she pushed and I wasn't ready to commit.  All I wanted was a little time.  Sure I had a crush on her for a long time even before I was married, but I valued my relationship with my girlfriend/wife more than anything,  (don't you kinda wish everyone could do that?)  we started dating after the divorce, the sex was awesome, but what really possessed me into getting involved with her? Maybe it was that "nothing ventured, nothing gained" attitude that I have, but it's also gotten me into trouble as well. I don't regret ever dating her. Maybe we broke it off all wrong. Maybe I shouldn't have started seeing her so quickly after the divorce. Maybe there are a whole lot of reasons. Maybe I still have feelings for her?? I dunno.  I know something I am missing.... :)  I think if I don't.....soon I am going to go bonkers....  Well I have paperwork to get off my desk. I need to write more, but I want this to sit for a while. Maybe after I read it I will write more later.

      Hi.  I figured I would take some of my lunch hour off and write a little in here while it was fresh on my mind.  Work has been very busy. FEMA has come in and taken over our building to help coordinate the relief efforts in the central part of the state. Since my job is Telecommunications, I've been down there off and on checking on whether they need anything or if I can be of assistance. By the looks on all their faces, things are not going very well down there. Pray for them all.  I also just found out that one of my online friends lost a friend this morning. She died in her sleep and was only 23. Please say a prayer tonight for her and her family as well.  Okay on to my ramblings.....  Don't you hate people that are fake? I sure do.  Lately it feels like more and more people I have been in contact with are just so...fake. Now I don't mean fake as in their appearance (I've been to Tampa too many times, so I know what fake is) but I mean fake in their personality or the way they act towards me. I have more people that I talk to online that are more honest than the people that I consider close to me. That hurts because I really try to treat people as I like to be treated. Being hurt so many times in the past couple years has almost gotten me to the point where it would be easier to just shut down and not even deal with anyone, but that's not my nature. I love people, but I guess I need to reevaluate on who I consider a friend because I am TIRED of being hurt and I am tired of being mistreated.  Today I am going to do something I really don't want to do, but I have to. I  HATE  when I try to be a friend to someone and they basically blow me off, so I think for my sake I am going to have to cut them loose until they want to be in my life as a friend. Everyone knows that I give  ALOT  of people the benefit of the doubt on a lot of shit, but I think I know that I have met my limit. It really sucks because I liked her as a person, but when you try to talk to someone and they might answer your IM for a second and then no contact and then put themselves as busy...well F that. I am over it. I might get a note, or maybe a call, or maybe nothing...we'll see.  Well I better get back to work. The director of FEMA is across the street with our Governor right now and I think they might be over sometime. I better make myself look good. Good thing I got a haircut.  Peace.
