      Joan Pujol, was born in Barcelona in 1912 to a family of "moderate means" and liberal political beliefs.  He reluctantly fought in the Spanish Civil War, managing to do so on both sides and, according to his own account, without actually firing a single bullet for either side.  He emerged from that experience despising totalitarianism in general but with a particular loathing for Nazism.  This was accentuated by the onset of war in 1939 at which point he decided he must make a contribution, as he put it, “to the good of humanity”  Garbo worked against the Germans because of his dislike of Spanish dictator Francisco Franco. He believed that only an Allied victory in the war could depose Franco. After offering his services to British intelligence and being rejected, Garbo was accepted by the German Abwehr. He departed Madrid in July 1941, obstensibly en route to England, carrying secret writing materials, lists of questions, money, and accommodation addresses.        Garbo actually went to Lisbon, where he tried unsuccessfully to contact British intelligence. He told the Germans he had reached Britain, and in July 1941 he began writing reports about British naval and shipping matters, which he sent to the Abwehr. He also told them of the network that he was establishing in Britain.      In Jan. 1942 Garbo, still in Lisbon, finally met with British intelligence officials and once more offered himself to the British as a double agent. After fighting between the British Secret Intelligence Service (M16) and Security Service (M15) over who would control him, Garbo arrived in Britain in April 1942 and remained there for the rest of the war, operating as a double agent under the control of the Twenty Committee. (His wife and young son went with him.)       In London, he established a paper network of national agents to improve his credibility with the Germans. He told the Abwehr that he had 14 agents and 11 well-placed contacts. He also gave himself a deputy, a substitute radio operator, and several assistants scattered around the country. One of Garbo's imaginary agents was a "Wren, " as members of the WRNS (Women's Royal Naval Service) were called. Garbo said the Wren was sent to headquarters for the Southeast Asia theater in Ceylon, where she passed information to him for the Abwehr. The Germans in turn passed the phony information to the Japanese military attached in Berlin to be passed on to Tokyo.       The Germans were extremely impressed with Garbo's reports, most of which were sent by post to Abwehr addresses. One report, obstensibly written before the Anglo-American landing in North Africa in Nov. 1942, reached the Germans after the landings. The Abwehr responded that "your last reports are all magnificent but we are sorry they arrived late, especially those relating to the Anglo-Yankee disembarkation in Africa. " These postal delays led the Germans to establish radio links with Garbo.      Garbo's activities forced the Germans to reveal several of their real agents to British intelligence. And the Germans paid for the deceptive operation, clandestinely sending about $340,000 to Garbo to pay for his network.        The Germans awarded Garbo the Iron Cross (In absentia) for his information on the D-Day Allied invasion of France (June 6, 1944). The British government made him a Member of the British Empire for the same phony information, which he sent to the Germans by British-controlled radio.

      The day of the book and rose This is one of the main important days in Catalonia. Is a very typical one, may be the most typical.  We commemorate the Saint George’s (the Catalonia patron) day.   It’s some kind of the Sain Valentine’s day. Every man must give a very pretty rose to the woman. Now a days even the shops and the friends give that kind of roses (with silver paper and the catalan flag and one big and fresh ear (spike).  All Catalonia is full of roses that day. In every corner you can find people who sell them, and the windows of the shops are full of roses too.  At the same time we commemorate the day of the book like in all Spain (we commemorate Cervantes  ( the most important spanish writter) day.  In the rest of Spain they only commemorate the day of the book. In Catalonia we join the “day of the book” with “the day of  the rose”. With the rose is a tradition to give a book, and this day all the book shops of Catalonia make some reduction in the prize of the books and everybody buy books cheaper than the normal price.  he tradition is that in all the streets there are long tables with the catalan flags selling all kind of books and roses.  Is a very pretty day  (usually is  very sunny, warm and glad )and the catalan like and feel it very much Sant Jordi was a Roman and christian military man. Because he was loyal to his faith, he was tortured in the reign of the Roman emperor Diocleciannus, around the year 303. One of the legends attributed to Sant Jordi, and the one that became quicklier popular, explains that a dragon frightened the people in a town. In order to calm the dragon, they had to give him a lamb and a maid chosen at random. One day the King's daughter was selected and she was carried in front of the dragon. Sant Jordi, miraculously, saved the princess maid and defeated the dragon. The maid, the King and everybody were converted to the christian faith.  The Catalan Kings frequently showed their devotion to Sant Jordi and requested his help in their fight against the unfaithfuls. In those times, countries so different as Georgia, England, Greece and Catalonia chose Sant Jordi as their Saint Patron. The Government of Catalonia was the main promoter of this devotion. The States General, meeting in Barcelona, decided to build a Chapel in the Palace of the Generalitat in honour of Sant Jordi. In 1456, Sant Jordi's Day was declared holiday in the city of Barcelona. At the end of the XIX century, Sant Jordi became a Catalan symbol. His fight against the dragon to free the princess maid was understood as a symbol of the Catalan fight for its freedom. The Rose's Fair is celebrated also during Sant Jordi´s Day. This traditional fair is being held since the XVth century. Since 1926 Catalans also celebrate the Book´s Day during Sant Jordi´s Day.

        Com se sap els tertulians de les ràdios son aquells professionals especialitzats en saber parlar de tot una mica, encara que sigui en detriment del coneixement en el sentit mes ampli. De fet hi ha un determinat perfil de tertulià que es dedica de forma compulsiva a repetir els errors que altres  col·legues seus no fan mes que repetir sistemàticament.   Un dels paranys mes clàssics consisteix en atribuir a Bertold Brecht uns versos que mai va escriure i que diuen aproximadament així:   Primer van agafar els comunistes,   i jo no vaig dir res perque no era comunista.   Després es van endur els jueus,   però no vaig dir res perque no era jueu.   Després van venir a buscar els obrers,   però no vaig dir res perque no era obrer ni sindicalista,   Mes tard es van ficar amb els catòlics,   i ni vaig dir res perque jo era protestant.   I quan, finalment, em van agafar a mi,   ja no quedava ningú per protestar.   Dons be, l' autor d' aquest vers es el pastor protestant d' origen alemany Martin Niemuller     Pol Weissman
