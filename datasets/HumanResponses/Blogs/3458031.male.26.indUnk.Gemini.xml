      You aren't born a writer. Never attend any courses on writing. You HATED school. Bad vocabulary. Lousy grammar. No professional training in singing and dancing. But you yearns to be a writer? Keep on dreaming!  Dreaming..? Heck no! This is a start. I'm telling the world I'm not dreaming. I will start writing. I  am  writing. And as such I  am  a writer. Not sure for how long, but this is a start. Not as good start as many, but still a start.  Maybe my writing sucks, but who cares. I know I'm illiterate, but I'm not stupid either. Who knows I might improve my writing in time.. Don't believe? It's a long walk and plenty of time for that. Cheers!

      The legendary Tyler Durden once said to me, "It's only when you have lost everything that you're free to do anything."  I never looked too much into it. It never occured to me that words from a self-destructive imsomniac would make pretty much sense in my life. But then later I realised why he is such a legend.   I had a vision. Not really another "Project Mayhem" but it would still be as destructive. To me at least. This is one vision that I am pretty much sure would really make it for me. It's about my future. My destiny. What is to come out of me.   But as great stories go, there are choices to take. And also sacrifices to be made. Nobody have to die for me, mind you. But being on a journey that's set up for you with free petrol to boot, changing destinations means all the privileges taken. You might end up walking the rest of your journey.  No guts, no glory. I've been blinded by my vision. I can almost see my destination, and it feels very near. I thought, even if I got lost, I sure can learn a thing or two. So I taken my choice, I changed lane. Definitely made the sacrifice too. A big sacrifice I would say, as I was walking barefooted. It's a long journey. No breathtaking scenery. I got lost too, and learnt it the hard way. My life has changed.  that is when Tyler's words become clear to me. I've lost almost everything. But I'm free. Free of the burden that's been thrust upon me. I am no longer under the obligations that others expect of me. Now I can go anywhere I want. Doing whatever I feel like doing. I'm getting somewhere. Set my own future. I'm going to make it. No turning back.  I had more visions now. Some are crisp clear. Some seems blurry. I'm already somewhere, but the visions kept me going. Don't really know where's the next stop, but I trust my visions. Even the blurry ones. Or maybe it's just some illusions, and I'm delusive. But so was Tyler Durden.

      I hate school! I hate school then and i hate school now. Always has been. I don't really have anything against anybody that loves to go to school, but to me school is overrated.  Actually it's not the idea that going to school and learn things that bother me. I mean I like to learn something new. Everyday i learn new things. But not in school.  Nothing really interests me in school. Nothing much to learn too.   The teachers, do they really teach you? I mean the things you really want to know, they teach you that?  Or they just quote something from the text book and give you tons of homework? Not that I get punished for not doing it everytime (managed to escape occasionally), but it seems that is the thing teachers look up to, every single day. Most teachers also have biased view of the students. The girls are likely to be on the good graces, while the boys, no matter how good, is considered a nuisance to the class.   Do they try to make their class interesting? Do they even know that the students no longer able to concentrate after 15 minutes? Why is it wrong for the students to adapt to their own style to learning? Why the students have to copy pages of notes that is already in the text book? Then comes the revision books, is it really neccessary to buy? Why even bother with the tuition anyway?   I know i'm not the best in my class. But i am still in the top ten most of the time. Thats quite an achievement for someone that hardly pays attention in class and always in a dispute with the teachers. I haven't had any good rapport with my teachers. They always feel they are right to instruct me to do things, whereas i tend to question them. I don't go to school to have someone boss me around! The learning process is supposed to be much more simpler and fun than what they perceive.  In the end, I made my decision.. I quit! Never liked school anyway. School made me feel stupid. And probably will make me stupid. Too stupid to even do my own thinking. I don't want that. I'd rather learn things on my own. And I did.   Come to think of it, are they really smart after all- the guys who went to school and have no idea what they really learnt? After all what they know probably just the things that are in the text book. How many can think for themselves? How many made full use of the things they learnt in school? Take a look around, see if you can see what I mean. Now, who are you calling stupid?
