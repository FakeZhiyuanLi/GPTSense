      I stumbled upon SP2 quite by accident, and was lucky enough that our dearest Heidi had decided not to limit the number of participants. Had she done so, there would have been no way for me to get in... and I feel sorry for the people that didn't know about it and didn't get signed up by the deadline. After exchanging a couple emails, I decided that I would like to host Secret Pals III. This blog is designed specifically for SP III... any comments, updates, etc are going to be posted to this blog. Please link back to this blog and check in from time to time. If you send me a comment with your blog name, etc I will link to your blog as well. If you'd like to get to know me a little better, my regular blog is  urlLink here.    Please read ALL the rules before you agree to participate!     Who is this for?    This swap is for crocheters and knitters. The  only real requirement is that you have a website or a blog. I state this preference that way the person who is your pal can look at your site and get a general idea of your likes & dislikes, etc. There will also be a WebRing set up for SP III, and all members need to join the ring with their blogs or websites and include a valid, active code on their websites. If you need help inserting the code when it is given to you, please email me. If I can't help you, I will find someone who can.  International Secret Pals are welcome to participate!  If you would prefer not to have an international pal, please say so in your signup email. There are no guarantees that other people in your country will sign up, so if you are an international pal, you may have to pay international postage. Please keep that in mind when you sign up.    Timelines and Due Dates    SP III will run for  three months , starting from after  September 4th, 2004 and running until December 4th, 2004 . The reason for this is so that people will not have to worry about sending things over the holidays.   Signups  will be from August 8th to August 27th, and signups will *end* at midnight Central Standard Time. I will not take signups before August 8th or after August 27th.    Matches  will be distributed by September 4th, 2004. Please make sure that my email address,  Vidardottir @ cox dot net  is approved for your mailbox, so the matches will not end up in the spam filters.    Rules     Minimum Contribution  is $50 in U.S. dollars over the course of those three months. To quote Heidi, "This can include the value of your time if you make something, and it can also include any postage costs. Why did I set a minimum contribution level, you ask? Because some people in the first Secret Pal felt they had given gifts that were much more valuable than what they received in return. Establishing this amount should make it clear to all what a fair commitment should be, and no one should expect more, or less. $50 over three months is just $16.67 a month; if you feel this is too much or not enough, I'm sorry, this is not for you." -- I could not have written this any better.   What to give?  You don't have to send just knitting/crochet related items. Any nice treats will do, such as candy, soaps, candles, etc. This is another reason why every participant needs to have a blog or website, that way their preferences will be easier for you to see. You will need to set up a secret email acct to send questions, etc to your secret pal to find out allergies, dislikes, likes, color preferences, yarn preferences, etc. If you have that email forwarded to your main account, don't forget to reply from the secret one! It is *not necessary* to send me the email address you are going to use to keep your secret from the person you are spoiling!   A note on email addresses: You have a regular email address. That's the one that I want, so that the person spoiling *you* has it to email you through. You can start another "secret" email address to use to send email to the person that you are spoiling in order to keep your secret. For example, my email address is Vidardottir AT cox DOT net. If someone were to google Vidardottir they would find my blog, that would be the end of my secret. So I send emails to my Secret Pal using a hotmail address not linked to any other account that I use. That's it... nothing special. You don't have to start one if you don't want to, please don't include your "secret" email account in your signup email.    When to give?  I would prefer that you send *something* to your secret pal  at least  once per month. What you send is up to you. If you want to send your gift(s) all at once, send a small postcard or something at the beginning, your gift, then another small postcard, or however you want to do it. If you want to split up the gift(s) over three months, then you can do that as well. The only thing that I require is that you send some kind of notification, either through email or snail mail, when you receive your match in order to alert them to your existance.   Please, NO DEADBEATS  I will not hesitate to publically humiliate a deadbeat by posting their information on this blog for every member to see. What I consider a deadbeat is someone that doesn't send anything in a reasonable amount of time and has given no reason for doing so. I understand that there are emergencies, etc... but your secret pal should not have to suffer because of you. If you are a deadbeat and are caught, I will remove you from the swap, and find someone else to spoil your secret pal.    Notice to all participants    I will try to always respond to your emails in a timely fashion, usually within 24 hours. However, there will be some times when I will be unable to. I am a full time college student, a mother of a 4 year old child, and the wife of a military man. There might be a time or two that it will take me longer than 24 hours to return your email... please be patient. If you don't get a response in 72 hours (3 days) please email me again. There is always the possibility that it was mistaken for spam.    Still want to sign up?    Please send an email to  urlLink Vidardottir@cox.net  In this email you  must  include your name, address including zip code, email address, and website or blog address. This is required information. If you don't include any or all of that information, I will reply to you once asking for what's missing.

       The signups for SP III officially kicked off today, and as of right now I have 22 signed up. I was trying to email each person individually, but since it looks like this will be getting "up there" in numbers, to conserve on time I'm simply blogrolling your sites. Please link to the SPIII blog and check the right sidebar 24-48 hours after you email your information to me. If your blog is there, I received your information and added you to the list. If it's not there, send me an reminder.  *Please*, indicate whether or not you do NOT want an international secret pal. If you don't say anything, I will assume that it will be *ok* to set you up with an interntional secret pal!  Also, if anyone knows how to make buttons and wants to design one for SP III, I would really appreciate it! It would be nice for y'all to have a button to put on your blogs or websites showing participation in SP III.   Also, if you could comment on the blog and tell me whether you would prefer to just blogroll this page or if you want a webring, I'm taking votes :-)

      If you don't receive yours within the next 24 hours (always assume slow ISPs... happens sometimes), let me know. I did get a few returned, but I figured out the errors and re-sent the email out to those people.   We are currently at 119 participants!

      Right now we're sitting at *90* members. If you want a button for SP III it's located below, and a larger one will become available at a later date. I'm so happy this is taking off! We need more international secret pals... I have 56 stating they want to spoil an international pal, but only 16 international pals!   Please doublecheck the right column's blogroll after 2 days to make sure that your blog shows up there. If it doesn't show up email me a reminder! I know there are one blog missing... there are 90 signed up and there are 90 blogs listed but one of those blogs is mine (and I'm not counting myself in the signup list, though I am signed up to spoil someone)... there should be 91 on the blogroll. It is very hard for me to check, because the names of the blogs are not usually even close to the web urls. If you know your blog isn't on the blogroll, please email me ASAP!   I just received an email from an anonymous source asking to be my Secret Pal, that way I don't have to sit out! How awesome is that? Thank you so much!  Happy bloggin' all. I hope this is as much fun for you as it is for me!
