      Today was a wicked fun day for the most part..we went to Rachael's for a little while for this cookout thing which was a pretty good time. Then Steve, Allie, Katie, and I came back here and partiedddddd..well actually we roasted marshmallows but its the same thing. Then Allie put marshmallow in my hair..that was a bitch to get out.  Then me and Katie and my mom and brothers went out to get ice cream at Friendlys. Katie dropped half of her ice cream in her lap then put it back on her cone then dropped it in the parking lot..she's such a klutz :-P but that's why I love her :-p  But more important than most of that, Nomar is gone.  Yes, we're losing offense. And a lot of it. Between Doug and Cabrera we get half of Nomar's numbers, but we get the Gold Glovers we need to get us into the playoffs. It's a great trade. Think about it....  We also got Dave Roberts (.253 BA, 33 SB). Not bad numbers if you ask me. He'll add speed to the top of the lineup and can fill in in the outfield for Nixon while he's out being a pussy for the next 50 games.  The Yankees traded Jose Contreras for Esteban Loaiza today. If you ask me, this improves the White Sox but not the Yankees...but we'll see.  And if you're smart you'll go download Stinkfist by Tool..

      I got home from Katie's camp today..that was a lot of fun :) We didn't do a whole lot lol but what we did was fun..like sit around. We went to Frye Island for supper last night and waited for like an hour and a half to get our food because theyre retarded, but oh well. Then we went for a boat ride and that was a good time. I'd never been boating after dark cuz I live such a sheltered life. Then I slept in some rich guy's house my dad knew from back in the day. Small world isn't it....  I just mowed my grandmothers lawn and played wiffle ball with Ryan and Gregory..I won 7-4. Wiffle ball haha..  Now I'm watching the Red Sox lol. It's 2-0 in the 2nd inning. It's great stuff really lol  As for Major League Baseball, FUCK YOU!  Penalties for brawl against NYY:  Jason Varitek-4 games Gabe Kapler-3 games Trot Nixon-3 games Alex Rodriguez-4 games Tanyon Sturtze-3 games ^smell any bullshit there? Schilling and Ortiz got fined "undisclosed amounts" Whatever. FUCK YOU BOB WATSON. YOU SUCK. KILL YOURSELF

      Yeah I failed. We sucked. Danny sucks. We lost. 4-2. To Bonny Eagle no less and they suck too. It's a joke. We're a joke. Oh well we'll be back to our dangling ways during the season and win the state championship without much difficulty. We're gonna be nasty cuz coach is giving us a training program from the Maineiacs lol  Red Sox are on now..it's 1-0 baltimore in the 6th inning..Schilling had retired 13 in a row before that faggot javy lopez hit one out..while I'm writing this Bill Mueller is doubling into right field! Woo!   So you should get 3 things out of this:  1. Danny sucks 2.&nbsp;I love the Red Sox 3. Javy Lopez is a faggot  ~Churnovsky, the Italian dangler extrodinaire

      what a crappy day...  as red sox fans we're getting all kinds of great news uch as trot nixon might be out for the season and Pedro pinched something in his hip.  As for some really good news theres a 4% chance Jason Giambi might die! He's got this parasite in his stomach which is fatal 4-5% of the time which is pretty cool.  Tomorrow is our big playoff game. Semi finals lol..you better go and watch me dangle :-p We're playing Bonny Eagle..should be&nbsp;difficult. I think we played them one other time but I can't remember if we won or not but we beat them both times last season.   Well the Red Sox are on now so I could go watch. They better keep winning or else I'm gonna..do something. Dunno what but I'll do something. Wakefield is pitching tonight. What a hunk!  ~Sincerely, Churnvosky the Italian dangler extrodinaire

      That's right folks! We beat a bunch of freshmen from Scarborough! Now we're into the 2nd round of the playoffs. Ohh, and Churnovsky played well, adding two more goals to his season total of five, all of which have come in the past three games. Trickey had some pretty ill dangles as well tonight..so yeah we're awesome. Well my Red Sox are on now so I gotta go watch that I guess..  ~Sincerely, Churnovsky the Italian dangler extrodinaire

       Yeah it's time for Churnovsky to dominate tonight vs. Scarborough. I've promised 3 goals so we'll have to see..but I'm a nasty dangler so we shouldnt have to worry. Today has been boring as hell but whatever. I'm still settling down from last night's Sox-Yankees game. That was insane and now we're just 7.5 back. Yeah  just  7.5. Life is good too cause the Thrashers signed Scott Mellanby today..yeah he's a wash-up and 38 years old but he's the veteran guy they need in the locker room. He might be 39 when they actually play a game though cause of the CBA..god I hate the NHL. Well I have to get ready to school up Scarborough and I have to work on my dangles and watch extensive game footage to prepare. Peace out    &nbsp;  -Churnovsky, Italian dangler extrodinaire

Yesterday was boring except we played some wiffle ball and cards. Stas chris and steve played. Then I had hockey tryouts which i failed miserably in. Oh well.........  Red Sox vs. D-rays tonight. Should be a thriller lol

      Well yesterday was my birthday. Alex, Steve, Zach, and Tyler came over and we played some wiffle ball and some poker. I won poker and took home the nice zamboni, then we split the series in wiffle ball 1-1. Me and steve dominated the first game but butts and alex beat us on a walk off Hr in the 2nd game.  This morning we played the rubber match..me and steve won in deciding fashion like 26-12..yeah we're nasty.  Red Sox lost last night. Fuckers. I hate them. They suck. Damn. Mother fucker it's not even worth it. But we gotta KEEP THE FAITH  Now we're having a cookout and Cam is spending the night tonight. Should be fun lol

      What a nice day outside..I should probably go out. The Red Sox won last night, 6-3. I'm very impressed. Dave McCarty hit a 3-run homer which is nice.  Katie came over last night. We tried to pay-per-view a movie but my TV was fucked up. So my mom went and rented 3 terribly shitty movies..so we ended up not watching movies and not doing much at all. It's okay cuz it was still pretty fun.  I bought the new Breaking Benjamin and Crossfade CD's yesterday. They're both incredibly good. It only cost me $18 for both which was pretty sweet too since they were both on sale. I love Bull Moose.  Well I'm probably gonna go swimming. I'm expecting Cam anytime now to show up and swim with me. Slam ball:-p  And the highest point in Montana is Granite Peak..12,799 feet!

      Kill Embree. Kill Timlin. They both suck. Pedro K's 11 only to fuckin lose because the bullpen is a bunch of BJ givers.  Oh well it's on to Tampa now..  Last night was fun. Cam gave me a surprise visit that I knew was coming because he said "I'm biking over to your house be there in 20." We played poker and such til like 3.  Other than that..the Red Sox suck
