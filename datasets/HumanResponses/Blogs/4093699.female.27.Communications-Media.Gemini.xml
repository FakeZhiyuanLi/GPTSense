      Hi Everyone,  There's been some complaints, completely justified, that I've been a complete bitch for not keeping in touch with everyone back home in Australia. To be fair, I've been called a complete bitch for not keeping in touch with everyone in London! So here's my attempt to keep everyone informed with my hijinks and escapades in London in one place so I can concentrate on the little things in my emails to individuals.  What have I been up to, you ask. I am still working for that damn media monitoring company. I am trying really hard to move on, honest! Just been taken over by a bigger company so now's a good time to get the hell out of there. Working on a few job ideas, maybe even a complete career change..... So, excuse the stream of conciousness but I am going to put my career ideas out there and get some feedback as I can rely on you lot to tell me whether I am being an idiot or not!  When I was back in Brisbane in February I was talking about training to become a teacher. But when I did some work experience sitting in on a few classes I quickly realised that was a BAAAAD idea. I have a lot better handle on my temper than I did as a teenager (thanks Dad for repairing those walls I kicked in) but I don't think I'd be able to hold it for long in a London school. The kids here are horrible! Back home I wouldn't think twice before telling off some ten year old boy for littering but here you run a risk of getting stabbed. The schoolgirls dress in a cross between the chorus line of Moulin Rouge and Kylie Mole (that's going back a few years I know, but I am sure some of you remember her). And that's the nine year olds. Even if I lasted through a year of training, I certainly wouldn't last long on my own in a classroom!  So - any suggestions on what I should do? Several months back I was talking to my friend Graeme about what our ideal jobs would be if training and money and time was not a consideration. I've always had this secret idea of becoming a midwife, have thought about it for years but I didn't do science past year 10, even though I loved biology. To study midwifery back home I'd need good science marks.  But a few weeks later we were talking to another friend of ours, Mich, a nurse whose mother happens to be a midwife. Graeme mentioned to Mich that I'd been talking about being a midwife but had the whole science problem. Mich said that if I wanted to I could do a diploma over here, basically an apprenticeship, and only needed GSCE or Year 10 science, which I have. I looked at the courses on offer, and once I have been resident in the UK for three years the government will pay for my training, plus pay my basic living expenses and some spending money. I have lined up some work experience with the Royal College of Midwives to test out the waters. All my friends over here have been really encouraging, saying I have the right personality and temperment for it, mainly based on the fact I am always the sober responsible one nursing them at 4am when they're in a right emotional/physical mess and need sorting out!  I am not considering this idea based on some airy fairy earth mother beliefs. There aren't enough qualified midwives, particularly in England. I think it's a vital role, providing medical and emotional support to a mother during pregnancy and birth. I think it's disgusting that due to a shortage of midwives many mothers barely know the staff taking care of them during this important time. I know it'll be hard work, and obviously messy, but I think I could handle that.   To be honest, I don't think I was ever cut out to be a journalist or working in the media industry. Law was a big mistake, based on me thinking it was time to get serious and get a career. I was rubbish at it! I want to put something back into the community, that was why I considered teaching. So maybe midwifery could be the way to go? This time I am not going to rush into making any decisions. I have a good place to live, a job I dislike but one that pays well and with some really good workmates to keep me going. As I only work one week out of two, I have a lot of time to really research career options and make sure I am doing the right thing. So, what do you think? Be honest. I know I have sprung this idea on you, but I've been really hesitant about discussing this idea until now, feeling I'd better really think about it first.   Anyway, enough of that. What else have I been up to? I am dating a film editor called Gareth Evans. He's English and getting quite tired of Australians saying "did you know we used to have a politician with the same name?" so he goes by the name Gaz. He's an interesting character, we've been seeing each other a couple of months now which is a bit of a record for me. He's really kind and incredibly smart but a bit too much of a party lad I might just throw him back and catch one of the other fish in the sea. My uncle Jim met Gaz when he came to my birthday party in May. He was a bit of a mess that night thanks to birthday champagne and probably didn't make the best impression that night. Gaz didn't either. Boom boom. Thanks for donating the cassis that night UJ! I better not tell Gaz about this website considering what I just wrote!  I have also been pretty active with the Australian Labor Party over here. I am helping out with the campaign over here. There's a hell of a lot of potential voters over here, and the London polling station has helped decided several key seats in recent elections so it's important to get them voting for us. Doing the political thing is my way off keeping touch with what's going on back home in a way. It's the only time I really express my identity as an Australian, I am not really one for going to Aussie bars. It's better for the liver too!  I have some really good friends over here, obviously none as good as you lot, but that's not their fault. There's Graeme, who conincidentally I know from Brisbane in the mid 90s when I spent all my time seeing indy bands at Ric's. There's Sarah from Melbourne, a fantastic girl I met in Stuttgart when I was with Markus and who really helped me when I moved back to London (I will call you more often mate, beer next Thursday???). There's Scotty, the mad Tasmanian bastard who got me all tangle up in politics and takes turns making me use my brain and destroy it with beer (Glastonbury a case in point). There's Don from Canberra and Cambridge and a smart guy. Then there's the whole Belfast Road mob who I party with, the mad Scotsmen Marc and James. Marc is a talented musician who plays in this band with an amazing singer/songwriter called Adem ( urlLink www.adem.tv ), you heard of them here first! And James is basically James Bond - he works in a mysterious job in the Foreign Office. He's on tour at the moment in Australia with the Scottish Fiddle Orchester, supporting the Three Tenors, just for something different to do. On most Saturday nights I hang out at Belfast Road where they run parties, sometimes with live bands, mainly with DJs. I have so much fun working behind the bar or dancing like a maniac. There's a party tonight, Graeme and Dave are Dj'ing so I'll take some photos of them and me in action and post them on this site so you can see what I am jabbering on about! There's also Justin the mad pirate lover and work colleague who makes me laugh so much I feel less like strangling my boss with a computer cable! And Sam his flatmate who I shared my birthday with. And there are so many others, but they're the main ones I will mention in these blogs so now you know who they are!  I share a house with a lawyer called Ralph Smyth pronounced Raif Smith. He's dead posh, went to Winchester and Oxford. Most definitely a single child, but I'm used to him! My other flatmate is Jay, a Swedish songwriter/music producer. He's new, still getting to know him, but he fits right in.  I am back behind the wheel - of bike that is! I am a more careful cyclist since landing in hospital all those years ago, you'll be glad to know! Except for last Monday when this idiot opened his car door without looking - was on anti inflammatories for my neck for the rest of the week, nice bruises too! I've turned into one of those anti-car pro-cycling militants and really lost my temper at the driver. By a stroke of luck I nearly landed in the path of a police car so the nice policeman stepped between us and stopped me clubbing the man with my bike lock!  Anyway, time to go! Look forward to hearing from you, I'll post lots of stuff, I promise, and not all about me! Just tell me when I get boring.  xxxxxxx Dani

      Forgot to mention that I dumped Gaz last Friday.    I'm was bit pissed off that the bugger didn't put up a fight.    I said "can we just be friends" and he said "sure, want to get a coffee".   He didn't even want to know why!  I had been warned by Graeme and Mich to stay away from the Birdcage (local hangout) until a week or so have passed so as to avoid giving him the idea that there might be hope, but as that seemed a bit redunant seeing as he didn't seem to think there was hope I went up there for Sunday lunch.     I saw his flatmate up there and apparently Gaz went home and went into meltdown and is actually quite upset.       That's better!

      As I mentioned before, I am quite heavily involved with the Australian Labor Party over here.   We've just become the first party in Australia ever (as far as we can tell!) to launch a website aimed at getting Australians living overseas to exercise their right to vote.      The UK is essentially the largest Australian electorate, with 20,000 expats and short term visitors voting last election at Australia House in London.      We've made a big difference to results in previous elections and want to do the same this time.        Our greater aim is to link Labor-leaning expats across the world.    It's really important to me to be able to vote even if I am living overseas.   I might not be back in Australia for another several years but I am damn sure I don't want to return to a country that has been weakened by poor government.     Even if you don't vote Labor, please forward this website to friends living overseas.  There are links to the AEC website where you can check your enrolment status and electorate.     In the end, the party you vote for doesn't matter.  What matters is that you vote.       urlLink http://www.alpabroad.org/

      Sitting on the beach just the job for the work-shy August 5, 2004  Unemployed Britons with an aversion to the office grind are being tempted from their sofas with a range of more unusual summer jobs, including being a Roman centurion or spending all day sitting on a beach.  The posts are among a series of jobs available this summer via government-run Jobcentre Plus offices, according to a list compiled by the Department for Work and Pensions to tempt the work-shy.  Perhaps the most unorthodox is dressing up as a centurion, a job that involves taking guided tours around the town of Cirencester, central England, once a Roman stronghold.  Those of a more leisurely bent might be tempted by the post of "machine operator" on Eastbourne beach, southern England - essentially watching beach equipment to make sure it does not get moved or stolen.  Other unusual positions include a bugler in the Royal Marines band - although this requires applicants to join the Royal Navy and complete basic training - a rickshaw driver, juggling teacher, pall bearer and bird scarer.  Finally, for those really looking for a talking point in the bar, a business in Norfolk, eastern England, is looking for that most glamorous of posts, a chicken sexer.  AFP

      Well, the feedback so far has been encouraging. And I guess "testing the waters" is not the best term to use when considering midwifery. As for law, all I can say is that if I was a lawyer I would be sued so fast for malpractice that I'd be out of a job in days!  For those of you that don't know, I got dobbed into organising the school reunion over here. Ten years since St Aidans! OK - Liz is the only ex-St Aidan's girl who will be reading this so I am going to let rip.  Although I am really grateful to my parents for paying for me to go to a good private school instead of throwing me into the state school system, I don't know whether St Aidan's was the best school for me. I had some great teachers, especially Mrs Clarkson-Smith, but I didn't agree with the curriculum or some of the advice I was given when at school. I was also horribly bullied right through school, but maybe I was just the type of person to get bullied anywhere at that point in my life.     I think that university was the making of me - especially UQ.   So many of you are my friends for life after meeting you through the sailing club or classes.  Anyway, the point is that after I finished year 12 I never wanted to have anything to do with my classmates or the school again.   Except for Liz, sorry Liz!      But curiousity gets the better of everyone.  No matter what they say, everyone is dying to see what happens to their fellow students ten, twenty, fifty years down the track.      So I was a wee bit gutted when I realised that I was going to be over here for my ten year reunion.    I was therefore easily convinced by Edna Brown from St Aidan's that I should organise one over here for all former students.    Well, I won't bore you with the ins and outs of organising it, but it's done and in just over two weeks I will be catching up with several girls from my year and another dozen or so who graduated as early as 1976.    It's going to be great fun but I am a little disappointed that my greatest nemisis, Carla Crooks, will not be at the reunion despite being in the UK.   I don't want to tell her what a cow she was to me, I just want to let her see what a great person I have become over the years despite her efforts to destroy my confidence.    Another former student, Jemma Petrie, has asked us all to fill out a questionairre on what we have been up to, our hopes for the future and what the school meant to us.    And I am having horrible problems trying to decide what to write.    I really wanted to be there in person to face up to some of these girls and say "you were a real bitch to me, you have no idea how miserable you made me feel but look at me know!" but in reality, that would have been childish.      I guess it would be childish to commit my feeling on paper.   I will just have to write something bland and "vanilla" and wait to the 20th year reunion to say something.      I guess there was also the physical side of things I wanted to show off.  I look fantastic now, in my own humble opinion.   I have lost around 20kgs over the years and feel so much better for it.   Looking at photos back then, is it any wonder that I didn't have so much as a kiss until I was 18?   I've certainly made up for the lack of early kissing and this has really given me confidence.     In the end, all I can say is have you noticed that almost all my friends are male? That's what an all girls school does to you.   Bitchier than that movie Heathers.    Except for you Liz!
