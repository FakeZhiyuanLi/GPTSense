      So, HE called me yesterday on my cell phone.  Didn't answer though, cause I was on the other phone with my mom.  I did try calling him back a bit later though, but he never answered, and didn't reply to my email from yesterday.  It's kinda weird.  He hasn't answered any emails for a few weeks, so I just put him out of my mind.  But that's like him...he'll basically ignore me (at lease it looks that way from here), but if I'm not like a program running in the background, he's on the phone or the computer asking me where I've been lately.    And so the rain comes, falling heavily from the sky.  I've tried so hard to put all of the past behind me, but part of me won't let it go.  I just don't know why....

      You know, I've got to say that there is not much in this world I detest more than job interviews, especially with employment agencies.  It has to be one of the most stressful, demeaning things a person can do with their afternoon.  Ask me, I would know.  That would be how I spent this afternoon....on one of the truly WORST interviews I've EVER been on.  I believe this is the first time I've been meeting with the owner, and had the receptionist put two phone calls thru, for the purpose of the woman to tell her friends about a going-out-of-business sale.  I'm sorry, but that is one of the most unprofessional things I've seen yet.  And the woman was easily twice my age.  There is just no excuse for that.  The number of jobs available also magically shrunk from five to just one...luckily it's the one closest to me.    I just hated being grilled.  After a certain point I feel like I've met with so many people that it would just be quicker to have one agency call the other...might be quicker than trying to get me in Tacoma from here (about an hour drive).  Who really gives a shit what four words I use to describe myself?  Is anyone really honest there?  Uh yeah, I'm lazy, sloppy, tardy, and hate working.  HELLO!!!  And then a more stupid question....Do I like accounting?  Let's see...you're interviewing me for a bookkeeping job.  No, I hate accounting, but I'm willing to do it if you'll give me the job.  DUH!  Of course I LOVE accounting (big fake smile).  The thought of working in accounting again makes me cringe because I know I'm going to get stuck doing collections (ugh!), and probably at the very least being the back-up to the receptionist.  Double-gag.  Like I don't have enough work to do in accounting, now I have to answer the phones too.  Lovely.  If it was back to happy old A/R in my own little office like at ASF in Phoenix, I'd be happy as a clam....even with the collections.  Damn, that was one of the best jobs I ever had, and had to give it up :(    Oh well...No journal copies today....I'm done thinking about that for awhile.  In a spot where it has zero impact on my life at this point.  If anyone reads this and feels otherwise, lemme know and I'll post more next time.  Otherwise, thanks to good ol' Blogger for letting me vent at 3:30am on Saturday.  See ya'll later....

      Taking a break from programming.  Got the hang of the lessons, just needing to do more reading about what the hell I'm DOING.  So what does one do on a spectacular, warm, sunny March day in Puyallup?  We have our sister come over so we can spend all day inside coloring her hair.  Such fun.  She really should have picked a crappy, rainy day (like any day next week will be) to do this.  Oh well, such is life.  Steve (hubby) is working again today, so didn't really have anything but the normal house cleaning to do anyway.  It was that or go to Target again and spend money redecorating my house.    One quick note...hope I have my dates correct.  If so, happy birthday to my old "flame", Whit Bazemore.  I'd tell you in person, but we don't get along well in person.  Alrighty all...another chapter of the "As The Stomach Turns" will be headed your way Monday, March 15.  Take care and have fun.  Kitty

       I guess I'll post another page of "As the Stomach Turns".  I've spent this week trying, finally successfully, to get the Java Development thingy installed and running properly on my 'puter.  Took three days, but at 11pm last night, I finally made it all happen.  And of course I was up at 6am today trying it out...now that it's 10:30am and I'm getting a headache, I think I'll stop learning for a bit.  Just to let you all know, it will be a glorious springy Seattle day here...low 60's and sunny by this afternoon.  Enjoy the read... :)   "Ha!  I didn’t dream about you last night.  I thought for sure, with everything that happened yesterday, that you would be tormenting me again.  But alas, maybe my head finally beat my heart out this time.  Just in time too.  I was starting to feel like I was going to jump out of my skin yesterday.  I feel so much better today.  No climbing the walls.  It really helped to vent to a friend last night.  Well, I just cleaned off all the emails from (and to) you.  Partly trying to save my butt, just in case someone ever saw them, and partly because I’m hoping for “outta sight, outta mind.”  Ok, well better until you wrote back.  Sucks that you’ve been sick, and now I understand why you’ve not been reading email (this time).  I wish I could come up with some new, witty things to say, but I still feel the same, so I just keep writing variations of the same stuff.  Sucks.    Alrighty…here’s a good one for ya.  Getting myself fired up for July.  I’m getting used to the colder weather, so I’m thinking it’ll feel really warm by then.  I’m thinking my plan is to see just how miserable I can make you.  I’ve got those great little gray shorts, and they’ll look cute with the Vans.  Just need a cute little crop top and I’m set.  I want to make you ache like I do.  I want to frustrate you, remind you that you want me, and why.  I want you to forget what you’re “supposed” to be doing, and do what I want you to.  I’m going to torture you so much worse than I EVER did in Phoenix.  You just have NO idea…..(evil laugh!!).  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~   Well, I know I dreamt of you last night, but I don’t remember it.  Just remember rolling over and thinking of you.  So, it’s not so bad.  The edge is worn off now.  Although I am still plotting much evil and misery for you in July .  However, I’m worrying myself a bit.  I’m afraid that I will be so concerned with torturing you that I miss getting to spend time with you.  And then it will be another whole, long year.  Ok, so maybe I’ll just look really good, but maybe act a little nicer.  I guess first we’ll have to see if there will be any spouses.  AAAWWWW!!!!!!!!!  I just want to write.  I don’t know what, and I don’t know why, but I do.  I’m tired of talking about you.  You are all I talk about, think about, write about.  It’s quite annoying.  Like I wish someone would ask me a really good question.  I am having writer’s block trying to start from scratch and it’s bugging me.  But if someone would give me a good topic, I feel like I could just keep going and going today.  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  Handwritten 1/14/04  Tired of typing, feel like writing now.  It seems to make it more personal.  Part of me just wants to torture you, make you ache.  I want to look really nice, make you want me; then ignore you.  See, I can pretend you’re not there also.  Because you do.  But I don’t really want to waste the one chance this year I get to see you.  So, I guess I’ll just be a little evil.  Can’t be too bad with Michelle around.  You know, I’m actually not mad, just in a funky mood today.  My boss is having a really bad day; I’m wondering if it’s rubbing off on me.  I guess I just wish you could understand how frustrated and confused I am.  If you don’t want me anymore, that’s fine and I could handle that.  But it would sure be nice to know.  Then I could just obsess from afar without always bothering you.  What would really make life nice right now is just a few nice, normal conversations between us.  Considering all the problems it caused and other troubles at the time, I guess I just wish things could be like they used to be.  All around, just frustrated and really wishing I had a crystal ball; cause I’m really needing an answer to the “what if”.  There have been other people I’ve wondered about, but the feelings were never so strong, and never lasted so long."

       So, here is part of the huge journal that I started writing a few months ago.  This is written to someone, someone that means a lot to me.  I am married...mostly happy...but I've had some feelings for this other person for many years...since the time I started dating my husband...so there is very much a feeling of "what if".  Enjoy....   You've been haunting me lately.  Realistically, I know I probably won't ever get to have you, at least any more than a fleeting moment.  So I have resolved not to think about it so much, to think about YOU so much.  And about the time I think I'm doing better, I start to dream about you, and a lot.  Last night it was the whole night.  I'm amazed at how well my subconscious remembers every detail of your face.  Last night's dream was so much like every time at the track - I stopped just long enough for you to acknowledge me, then I moved on.  But when you turned your head, it was like everything in that dream was real, you were so real.  I know I'm not crazy; I know enough about psychology to know that the dreams are my heart's way of not letting you go.  I try to forget you because I need to, not because I wish to.  And so by dreaming, part of me gets to hang onto you.  It hurts, and I'm very confused by why I still feel like this.  I almost feel like I left part of myself behind in Phoenix.  What I do know is that all things aside, you and I have unfinished business.  And it might take drastic measures to find out, but I'm willing to take that chance.  When I think of our "play" time, I am constantly filled with regret.  But it is for what did not happen.  I think I missed something very special, and that eats at me daily.  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  Oh boy, do we have unfinished business.  Lately, I’ll be sitting on the couch watching TV and suddenly, during a commercial, I’m taken back to 18 months ago, standing in your office.  It’s a Wednesday afternoon, you’re leaving the next morning for a race and won’t be back until Monday afternoon.  We’ve managed to have a few moments when no one was around.  You sneak the door closed, making sure your dad is really gone.  You walk over and hug me, telling me that you wish I could go with you, even if just to keep you company.  How I would love to join you.  We could make such a team, such a talented man with a caring, supportive woman by his side.  But first you are running your hands along my waist, because I was kind enough to wear a short shirt today.  As you press your body against mine, kissing me gently, yet firmly, it makes my mind wonder with the possibilities.  You surely would make the most amazing lover.  All I ever wished for was that we had more time to explore the possibilities.  I will never forget our first kiss; the night the planets aligned and all was right with the world.  I have never wanted anyone like I want you.  It’s been almost 18 months since we spent any time together, yet sometimes it feels like last week.  I just can’t believe that whatever I’m feeling is still so strong.  It makes no sense to me…except that maybe I’m right, I missed something very important.  That also hurts, like nothing else.   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  I see you online.  I want to say hi so badly, but I’m resisting the urge.  How am I ever going to let this go if I can’t stop talking to you?  I guess I’m just in one of those spots where the memory is too fresh again.  I know if I can get thru the next couple days, it will begin to fade and I’ll be alright.  Until then, I ache.  I hate it so much…I wish it could just be like you don’t exist.  I know you go thru life without thinking about me.  I envy you for that.  I wish I could stay as busy as you do…too caught up with my “real” life to worry about the fantasy, the “what might have been”.  I thought leaving Phoenix was going to help, because I wouldn’t be driving by you everyday.  Both it almost seems worst now, because I don’t have you so handy.  Before I could just stop by any time I felt like it.  But no more.

      I have pages and pages of stuff to post on here, so I will do a little at a time, along with adding notes, poems, etc, on a (close to) daily basis.  Nothing new for today...just rambling as I'm up "late" due to Steve's never-ending snoring.  See, this is why I never started one of these things...I don't feel like I ever have anything to say.  Guess we'll find out.

      I wrote this over a couple of days, mainly sitting in the bathtub one night, just thinking.  I tend to write best when I have a thought come to mind, then mull it over and start writing it down...it just seems to flow after that.   "A body that captivates me A face that haunts my dreams A soul that stirs me to higher things  You – Are the one I treasure You – Are the one I long for You – Are my lover, the only one for me  Yours is the only face I want to see when I awake And although not before me, you are in my sights the whole day through You are my muse, my inspiration It is for you I write these words  My blood runs like fire, through my veins, with a touch of your hand My body becomes like clay, waiting for your skilled touch to mold it My mind wonders with all the possibilities at the mere sound of your voice  All the things you mean to me, I wish you knew But this secret love – it is mine alone You have made another yours, to have and to hold So this love I feel,  you will never know"

      Well, now that I seem to have a fair portion of my day free, although I'm at work, I think I'll start posting a little more often.  But if I suddenly stop, I probably actually have something important to do, somewhere.  But until then, here I am.  Still waiting for my real computer at work.  I've been working off a laptop for two weeks now.  The glamour has completely worn away.  I don't want to see another laptop for months, unless it's attached to Herb.  Stupid little screen, no music except for MSN radio, and this shitty little keyboard.  Thank God for real mice.  And I have this huge chair, and huge desk, and for once nothing to put on it.  Oh well, I'm not too worried about it.  Jeff (of turning my poem into song fame) says I should tell both of you that read this about my boss, namely because I think after a week he's already sick of hearing about Herb, and assumes you do too.  So, about that best thing I can come up with is that his last name is Farris, so naturally I call him Bueler.  How COULDN'T you??  Of course he is not aware of this nickname, as that would really take the fun out of it.  But after only two weeks, it's hard to come up with more dirt than that.  But, I urge you to check back often, because I'm sure that I will have more material before too long.  He is my boss, afterall.

      Just a link I thought I'd share with you all...this is if ANYONE reads this thing.   urlLink Here  is the link for the previously mentioned photos by my buddy David.  I won't expressly point out the "Herb" photos, but it's not too hard to miss, as there are more pics of him than any one other person....thanks again David!!!

      Back at the very beginning of my Blog, I posted a poem that I wrote one night.  Something deep, and powerful, and summing up everything I've felt in the last two years.  I actually dared to share it with another living sole yesterday, someone I work with who is considerably more musically-minded than myself.  Very much to my surprise, Jeff thinks it would make a great song.  I'm kinda torn between "wow, it would be cool to hear a song I wrote on the radio", and "wow, I can't tell my husband about this because it would be obvious who it's about".  I guess I'm getting way ahead of myself there though.  Actually, I think it would make a great Lifehouse song, but I HIGHLY doubt that is even earthly possible.  I'm also borderline sorry that I asked David to take those pics.  I just sit here at my desk all day, staring at that fabulous body that drives me wild.  I feel like I'm not getting any work done again, just sitting here obsessing.  I know it'll be three months until I see him, and that seems like forever from here.  I'm so afraid....afraid something will happen, afraid nothing will happen.  Part of me wants to tell my husband, "I'm going to this race, whatever happens happens, we won't talk about it, it doesn't mean anything to our relationship, I put up with way too much of your shit everyday and get nothing in return.  Just give me this one weekend for myself".  Yeah, and I think we all know how well that would go.    I'm also still very frustrated about our fight the other night.  I think I'm getting near the point where I'm just not sure how much more of this I can do.  How many more times I can hear "get out" and still somehow manage to get beyond it?  I promised myself last time we did this that the next time he said it, I'd do it.  But I couldn't.

      Ugh...what a week it's been already, and only mid-day Tuesday.  My good friend David was nice enough to send me some truly excellent photos of my little buddy Herb.  Not quite what I need to continue on in a happy, health marriage, but sometimes a girl needs a little desert on her diet.  Of course he's just looking as damn yummy as ever...something will never change.  Hell, his dad still looks damn good at 50-something, so I know there is something to look forward to there.  But it's funny how simple pictures of someone can evoke some really weird emotions.  Things I've worked so hard to bury in the last few months are right back at the surface again.

      Much to the great shock and sadness of the two people that read this, I am going to admit something.  I love Herb.  I may not be IN LOVE with him (although that point is certainly up for discussion).  But I love him.  He is the kindest, sweetest man I have met in a very long time.  When I need him, he is there for me.  Now, you will be asking, is he doing this because he knows he's always got "some" coming to him whenever we happen to be in the same town?  Hard to tell is my answer.  I can't get inside his mind, but I find it hard to believe that a man would be that kind just on the off chance that I WILL get time alone, on the one day of the year we'll be near each other.  To be perfectly honest, I don't really give a shit either.  I don't measure or rate a person's friendship on their desire to bed me.  If you're my friend, then you're my friend.  If there is more, that's different.  On that note, I can also freely admit that I detest my landlord.  To say she most certainly is smoking crack is a compliment.  She must stay up late at night to find new and exciting ways to make my life hell.  Like I told Herb, I just can't understand why I can't seem to make life work correctly all at once.  Just about the time I get one thing fixed, something else is wrong.  Why is this still happening?  Why do some people have it so easy, and others have to fight so damn hard?

       I will now list my most recently seen favorite sayings.  Most I have found on various racing message boards, within other lists.  I guess this is kinda like David Letterman's Top 10 List...but it's not Dave, and there's more than 10.   I can see your point, but I still think you're full of crap.  How about never? Is never good for you?  I'm out of my mind, but feel free to leave a message.  Ahhh...I see the screw-up fairy has visited us again...  I have plenty of talent and vision; I just don't give a damn.  I'm already visualizing the duct tape over your mouth.  Any connection between your reality and mine is purely coincidental.  Do I look like a people person?  This isn't an office. It's Hell with fluorescent lighting.  Sarcasm is just one more service we offer.  A cubicle is just a padded cell without a door.  How do I set a laser printer to stun?  I thought I wanted a career; turns out I just wanted a salary.  Well this day was a total waste of make-up.  Do they ever shut up on your planet?  Not all people are annoying. Some are dead.  You look like crap. Is that the style now?  Earth is full. Go home.    Hope you enjoyed.

      That was, without a doubt, the WORST birthday in my memory.  I spent several hours holding back the hair of a puking 6 year old.  My birthday cheesecake was terrible.  My husband bought me nothing.  And I had to cook dinner.  So woohoo, I'm 27 now.  Still not feeling real well, but now I'm just tired from being up until 2am.  Staying home with the kid today.  Yippy.  At least she's feeling better.  The race this weekend was both good and bad.  TJ didn't qualify, which so completely sucks.  The race was in Chicago, which meant both bad weather and amazing new records.  It was awesome to see a funny car run 330, and then 333.25, but it wasn't anyone I give a crap about (you guessed it, Whit Bazemore).  Herb's race didn't go so well either, they qualified last and lost first round  :(  What a bummer.

      I posted a pic of myself on my profile, if there is anyone at all out there reading this thing.  Not too much going on today.  Pretty quiet here at work, so I figured I'd just take a moment and jot down a few quick lines.    Not feeling well again...dropped off taking my Celexa for a few weeks cause I was switching pharmacies, and now that I'm back on it, it's kicking my ass all over again. Hopefully after a couple more days I'll be feeling "normal" again.  Loving the hell outta being a redhead.  I almost feel like I should have been born this way.  This must be the way my sister feels about being blonde.  I'm completely looking forward to showing it off at the racetrack.  Most of my friends there had not seen me red before....should be interesting :)  So glad it's Friday.  I'm tired, it's been such a long week.  Not really wanting to do anything for my birthday this weekend.  Steve doesn't believe me, but I'm just so tired and I'd just like to spend a nice quiet, relaxing weekend hanging out at home.  My leg aches so badly today...I know it's going to rain tonite or tomorrow.      It's later now than when I wrote the first part.  I'm so glad I'm not is sale.  It looks like life as they know it is just self-destructing.  I hate talking about work all the time, but this is where I do all my writing.  I feel like I need to get some creativity going again.  I'm not sure if I have something like writer's block, as I'm not really writing about anything.  Maybe it's just because I'm not dealing with problems at home, or Herb-related issues.  For the most part everything is settled.  I guess that doesn't lend itself to being very creative.  There are a lot of things I could talk about.  Not sure if anyone would care to read though.    Let's see...there are a couple of races this weekend, so I guess I'll talk about that.  I know there is something there I have a few strong opinions about.  Namely, the fact that I realize that the NHRA (National Hot Rod Association) is going to dump the hard working men and women who compete in Top Alcohol Dragster and Funny Car in favor of the Pro Modified class.  I have NO problem with Pro Mod, they are some bad-ass cars.  But the way the NHRA has been systematically screwing over the racers who travel the most miles, still have full-time jobs at home, spend the most money getting volunteer crew members into races, and generally are the most local and hard-working people you'll ever meet.  What the hell??    I think that's about it for right now.  I might post later, depending on how I feel (which now at 1pm is still like crap).

      Yippy....got my "big people" computer today.  I love laptops, but they are NOT made for working at the desk all 8 (or more) hours a day.  I got a nice 17" flat screen monitor too, so now I have super-sized Herb :D  Just missing a sound card, so no music :(    Steve's job is coming along nicely, so far.  It would be SO nice to really get back on our feet.  Pretty sure we're gonna have to move, but I think if we can start everything off current, we'll be much better off and able to maintain it.    We're now down to just about two months until raceday, and I'm completely stoked.  I've now gone totally red with my hair, and I think it looks amazing.  Still not sure if Steve is going, but Michelle (my sister) and I are planning to have a good time, either way.

      So I've spent the past three and a half days answering something like 80,000,000 phone calls from various minorities and other white-trash, redneck people who just haven NOT figured out that because we're in America, we should ALL be speaking English.  We are hiring four "monkeys" out in the warehouse, and it's just the most awful thing ever.  My office has looked more like the newest local free clinic then an actual professional place of business.  I'm so ready for a break.    Our friend/roommate left this morning.  Poor Hubby cried...I felt really bad.  He is lonely up here, as I am too, and when you have someone live with you for 4 months, they become like family.  My husband is, I guess, a typical guy.  Big tough exterior, loud and obnoxious sometimes.  But when this guy is losing friends or family, whether death or moving, he gets very sad.  So, it is a bittersweet goodbye, I guess.  Mike became like a fixture in our home, and he will be missed.  BUT, I am happy to have my home back, to use as I please.    And my birthday is Sunday.  Yippy.  Looks like Steve will probably work Saturday....maybe the kid and I will go get our hair cut and nails painted.  Goody, another girls day out.  Although, I think he'll have the truck, so maybe I'm just stuck at home.

      Different day, same beef.  I am now tired (it's all of 1:30pm), there are 2-1/2 more hours of work, and if I didn't come back, it wouldn't be too soon.  The Moron Boss reigns supreme.  Far be it from me to keep a little thing like NOT HAVING A CLUE WHAT THE HELL TO DO HERE WITH YOUR NEW DATABASE/WEBSITE keep me from working properly!!!!  Not a happy camper.  If it weren't for the fact that this place is SSOOOO close to home (for now, at least), I'd be outtttaaaaa here.

      Ok, so I have this beef with my boss right now.  Namely, that this company is 25 years old, and I'm the first receptionist....EVER.  And secondly, this is NOT the first time I've been a receptionist.  Although you'd never know it by the way I'm treated here.  I am never let to do my job....if you are the sales manager, and you've hired me to answer the phones, LET ME DO IT!!!  I have a person on hold because I need to get info, not because I'm lazy.  If you do not want to take the time to let me know who people in the shop are and which dept., then don't get pissy when I DO have to go find out.  He makes collection calls with a mouth full of food...he is simply one of the most unprofessional "managers" I've seen in some time.  My 23 yo previous boss who used to do her hair and makeup at her desk, while coming in hung over, was still a better manager than this.  His other employees include a salesman with 15 years at this company, and a bunch of still-in-school kids that play with computers.  This is getting frustrating, and I've only been here a month.  Steve is back working on this end of town, and I don't wanna be too far away, but....

      Steve got laid off Friday, and this is sending the relative calmness of the past week into a total tailspin.  He tells me when this happens, his thoughts wonder to moving "back home"...Orange County, NY (of Orange County Choppers/American Chopper fame).  When he first said it Friday afternoon, I reacted with my usual feeling of "oh crap, lets run away again".  I kinda stiffened up to the idea.  But as we talked more, and he began to finally open up to me, I rather warmed up to the thought of it.  And once he started to see my acceptance, he put the brakes on.  I'm rather confused.  He is too.  But now I have a problem, and that is that I kinda wanna move there too now.  There are so many things back there that interest me.  So much history, family, even better schools than we have here, things like that.  I am a big history buff, so that issue is HUGE with me.  He is looking into work back there, and I'm seeing what's available both for my own work, and rentals.  So, I guess only time will tell....

      Yeah yeah, so I already posted today....so what?  Ok, feeling a little tension here.  I've started writing in my "Stomach" journal again.  "Why bother when I have this handy Blog that I already use", you ask?  Simple, this is for venting in general, that one is write to and aimed specifically at Herb.  So when I feel the need to "talk" to him, I write there.  So, I'm actually writing in both places, and I'm not sure if I'll be posting that part.  I know there was something really good and worth-while that I was going to say here, but it escapes me now.  The phone has rang WAY too many times this afternoon, and it's frying my brain.  Oh well, ttfn.

       Ok, so it's been almost two month since I posted anything from "As The Stomach Turns".  I figured it was about time (that and I found which email addy I sent it to months ago).  I went thru and read some of this, and I guess it works out that I post this section now because I'm feeling a lot of these feelings again.    "You must really get tired of spending so much time in my brain.  I mean really….don’t you have anything better to do these days??  I know full well you were busy working on the car last night (unless of course you were still sick, then maybe not), but you sure managed to find enough time to visit my thoughts for a couple hours.  And in talking to my friends, I keep finding excuses for why I want to leave.  It’s getting really bad.  You know, I think if I just really knew what to do, it would be easier.  Having a hard time thinking of parting with someone I’ve been with for almost a decade now.  Especially only being 27ish.  That’s a big chunk of my life that I’ve committed to one person.  But, you know, when for the last two years you’ve been saying “when” I leave, not “if”, it really makes you start to wonder.  If your list of things I can do in exchange for race tickets is that long, there must be something there worth going after.  This is just ssooo weird.  I just can’t let it go.  I feel like I’m seeing half of something, but know the other half…just can’t see it.  I guess it seems stupid of me to leave if there is nothing to leave for.  There can’t be that many other wonderful guys out there that are so much better than what I have now, can there?  Although I just don’t know.  There are a couple people who think so.  I just can’t stand the thought of going through that loss, then have you turn on me also and being totally alone.  I guess we’re at this point where we’re dancing around each other, waiting for the other to make a move.  Neither one of us wants to make it first though, because that would mean giving up the other person in their life.    So, until the day that I just cannot take anymore, it looks like I am staying right where I am.  Ok…that is just too depressing to think about.  I had a great lunch with Sandy today, and I don’t want to think about problems.  You are not replying to my reply, so I’m just not going to worry about it until you do.  In the meantime, it’s giving me a lot of good writing and typing practice.  And a great place to vent.  Nice to know the computer won’t talk back.  I want to know if I suddenly became single, whether by choice or not, if you would leave.  I guess this comes back to my question a couple months ago.  Are you really WANTING to marry her?  Personally, I believe you are comfortable.  Plain and simple, nothing more to it.  The only reason you ever gave me was that “she was good to you”.  What the hell is that supposed to mean?  Your dog is loyal to you also, but I doubt you’re going to marry her.  That’s just not a good enough reason to make that kind of a commitment.    There is a song by Nickelback that’s being played on the radio right now.  It’s called Figured You Out.  It is quite the sexual song, and sadly it reminds me a little of you and I.  It is a man singing about a woman he is with.  She is a little on the wild and kinky side, and he totally loves that about her.  I could just see you enjoying this song.  There is nothing soft or sensual about it, just raw and animalistic.  I find it very erotic.    Sweet and tender….not two words most people think of when they see you.  Although you might work in an office by day, I know you are happiest working with your hands, building things.  I have seen your handiwork, and you are quite the craftsman.  But those beautiful hands are magical beyond crafting steel and aluminum.  Although I did not get to have all the experience with them that I wished for, it was enough to know you are gifted.  And you thought so highly of my own abilities.  It was amazingly rewarding.  Everything about us made me feel like a whole person.  While I know you would have enjoyed a home-cooked meal, it was nice to be thought of as something other than a maid or personal chef.  I would gladly cook for you because I know you wouldn’t take it for granted.  I am just at that point where I feel like it’s assumed that I will be there all the time, ready to clean up a mess and cook a meal.  What if I don’t feel like it one day?  What will become of my little family?  What if I want to go somewhere that no one else does?  It means nothing to anyone else.  I feel like I have made no choices of my own for so long.  I think that is why being with you was so exciting and empowering.  There’s the word I was looking for …“empowering”.  By giving me that nickname, you gave ME the choice of when to go to lunch, when you would kiss me, everything was up to me.  It was amazing.  For me being Mistress Kitty was never about cheating or beating people, although maybe somewhere in between those two.  It gave me the power to make my own decisions.  You let me decide what I wanted without having me feel guilty about any of it.  I never felt like I was taking something away from you by me choosing.  When you said you wanted whatever I said, you actually meant it.  I think it is very easy for other people to view our relationship and think you did everything that you did just to “get into my pants.”  However, I guess that didn’t ever happen, so now I tend to believe you were very honest in your desires.  I never felt like there were things that were totally my responsibility.  Not that I shy away from that.  Just that I was never burdened by something I had to do for you.  I never felt like I had to earn or work for your affection.  You wanted me for ME, not for dinner, or a clean bathroom, or giving a kid a bath.  It wasn’t about how much of the housework is left to do, or if the dishwasher needs to be emptied.  These are all the things that are bugging me right now.  I’m starting to feel like the maid again.  He just sits and watches TV or cruises eBay all evening.  Granted, I spend two evenings a week on the computer.  Two out of seven really isn’t that much though, I think.  But in the meantime, I’m making coffee, lunch, dinner, cleaning up dishes, make sure Adrienne’s homework is done, etc, etc.  It just seems like a never-ending slew of chores and tasks that continually bog me down.  I think I’m ready for a vacation."

      Got everything moved over to the "new" house this weekend.  Still have to clean though...yuck!!  I am SO sore and tired....been sleeping like crap.  Been without a computer or TV since Friday night, so I was quite excited to get into work and find out how the race in St. Louis went this weekend.  Immediately upon booting my computer up, I logged onto www.nhra.com to check it out.  It was then I learned that we lost Top Fuel racer Darrell Russell.  He was racing Scott Kalitta in the second round.  One of the rear slicks came apart, taking the wing down, and sending shrapnel into the cockpit.  The NHRA's Safety Safari says he was breathing when they got him out, but he was air lifted to the local trauma center, and died shortly thereafter.  Like most others have said, this reminds me a lot of Blaine Johnson's death.  All I could do was sit in front of my computer and cry.  Since starting this post, I've found a video clip on espn.com.  Like so many others, I too have seen worse wrecks, and wonder how they can be so bad when you've seen people walk away from worse.  Godspeed to you DR, guess you and Blaine can do bench racing up there.

      I have to admit, as much as I don't like to, that I enjoy being someone's "Little Kitty".  I mean something more to someone that to just be a "hey you".  That's one of those little proddings that no matter how much I remind my husband, he just can't seem to remember the small things like that.  Why then is it so easy for someone 1,500 miles away to remember?  He'll probably say force of habit...but I've been with Hubby for 8+ years now..shouldn't we have that figured out by now?  Getting all set up for moving this weekend.  It's kinda sneaking up on me fast, and I'm hoping I'm ready for it.  I was afraid this was going to happen.  We also decided to just get the move over with this weekend instead of dragging it out all week.

      How many times can I ask "what might have been" before I get tired of it?  How long will I feel this way?  It's been almost two years since I last worked with him, and still the smallest hint of something just sets me off.    I find that men say things, and sometimes have no idea what they are saying.  Or, maybe I just have a really sick mind...LOL!  Things like hearing a good-lucking guy talking about discussing what he wants.  Is it just me?  Must have hot and funky on the brain.  Or maybe it was the thought of a hot and sweaty Herb painting a friend's house.  Bad Kitty

      So I started to write this big long post about loving men who drive big trucks.  Then work took over and I totally lost my train of thought.  Oh well.  That doesn't change the fact that the bigger the truck, the more I love it.   Old Herb drives a spectacular machine.  At lease he used to.  I've heard he's traded in the one we used to drive to lunch in.  That sucks.  I would have traded a lot of what I own to have that truck, even if I do only drive a mile to work.  She sat so tall and proud, it always took just the right amount of effort to climb up into her.  Well, in jeans at least...getting into that truck in a skirt could have been slightly obscene.  Ok, so you get the idea...I loved that truck.    T-minus 9 days until we get to start moving...but I'm not counting.  My sister is coming over Saturday.  I am FINALLY getting a haircut.  This mop is getting all ratty looking again.  Also gonna recolor it.  The red's almost completely faded now, and with five weeks until race time, I figure this gives me enough time to color and touch it up.  Other than moving, nearly everything I do in the next two months will revolve around the race.  Yes, I'm staying red.  I have to.  Whoever said blondes have more fun has obviously never been (or been with) a redhead....

      Not much new to write about today, except that, once again, I would like to congratulate my sister who, in 6 hours, attends her commencement.  Kiddo, you've done a great job, and we're very proud of you.  Plus, I promise I'll be at the BIG one in two more years.  Just received a Breaking News email that Ray Charles died.  That would be the second famous person now this week.  On Saturday, our 40th President, Ronald Reagan pasted away.  Tomorrow, America will lay him to rest, and we will observe a National Day of Mourning.  Since I've been in Washington, I've heard a lot of liberals bad-mouthing the Reagan Years.  Kinda pisses me off, but that's another story.  Most of my childhood was spent in those Years, and I remember them fondly.  There were some hard times in there, but also a lot of opportunities for my Dad.  We made the move from Seattle from Phoenix in that time.  It has been sad to see his mind and body deteriorate over the past few years.  We are happy to know that he is of sound mind now, with his Father.  Rest in peace, Mr. President.

      Upon further thought regarding my excitement about leaving Phoenix, I rememebered that we left most of the utilities turned on because the house was still for sale when we left.  That explains why it felt like I was doing twice as much work this time around.    I have also discovered the possiblity that karma exists.  I look at it as "do unto others..." as I was raised.  Well, I know it's totally true now, and thankfully, I'm on the happy end of it.  The buyer for the rental we are leaving did not get financing, and now the landlord has no buyer.  I try not to glory in other people's troubles, but talk about somebody asking for it.  Had she just kept her mouth shut, she wouldn't be in this problem.  Oh well, it's outta my hands, and I'll have her out of my hair in less than four weeks.  Early congrats to my sister, who graduates getting her Associates degree tomorrow.  She is the first of the three kids to get any degree.  After the summer, she'll be onto the university for her Forensic Sience degree.  Oh fun.

      Holy crap, I forgot how much work was involved in a "simple" move.  I finally have all of the utilities ready, except for the electric.  I don't remember going thru this much hassle when we left Phoenix.  But maybe I just didn't care.  In fact, that's probably why.    So, now I'm down to changing addresses with magazines, credit cards, etc., and house cleaning.  I spend half an hour scrubbing my bathroom floor....a grand total of maybe 3 feet wide and 8 or 10 feet long.  It was NASTY.  Hubby and I both have long hair, and he's a daily hairspray user (I'm outta that phase).  We've just been really bad about cleaning the floor.  But it's done.  That was the big one.  Now it's just three weeks of maintenance, plus some other cleaning.  But that's what I have a sister for ;)

      Good news...we got "our" house!!!  Despite being sick Friday on, this was an amazing relief.  We start moving stuff over in less than three weeks, and I can't wait.  We even did a little packing Saturday night, when I felt a little better.  Our current landlord did not give us the great reference she promised....big fricken surprise.  And now she wants half of June's rent because we were late in the first half of our lease.  We are also not surprised by this, but still pissed about it none the less.  My feeling is, if you were that adamant about it being on time, you either needed to write in a clause charging a late fee, or don't accept the money and evict us.  Don't offer to make arrangements if you're going to punish us with them later.  We are trying to work something out, but we just don't have the money to give her right now.  But, I'll less than freaked out about that part...just realizing that I have to pack up, clean everything, still take care of showers, getting arrangements with the new sitter worked out, homework for Addie, and everything else in life taken care of, in three weeks.  Eeeekkk!!!!

      I haven't even turned in my credit app for this spectacular house, and I'm already feeling a lot of stress about it.  I'm getting that feeling I used to have, for example, when I used to see Herb at the track and he looked so amazing, but I never felt like I wasn't good enough for him. That's how I feel now...I love that house, I want it, it's beautiful, but I think it's too good for me.  I hate feeling like this....

      Ah, another wonderful day in paradise.  I love these spring days.  I'm also loving the fact that it's not gonna be 110 here today, as it will be in Phoenix.  But alas, at it will be a fabulous 72 here, that makes today a skirt, stockings and heels day.  I enjoy these days of looking more like a woman.  I'm all for the comfort of jeans and sneakers, but this is a boost to the old self-esteem.  On the housing front, I've found my next place to live.  She is a sweet 2,247sf house, 3BR, 2BA, on 1.34 acres.  It's got the biggest family I've seen...and a most awesome bar!  There is a gazebo out back, plus a hot tub in it's own little building.  And all for $50/month more than I'm paying now.  Can do!!!  So, everybody keep their fingers crossed that we get approved, and I'll be sure to invite you all to the big 4th of July party!!!

      Oh boy, what a holiday weekend.  Had a few folks tromp thru the house...I have now come to the determination that realtors sell houses because they have no other real life or job skills, including being able to read.  But alas, it appears we shouldn't have to deal with them much longer.  The landlord claims she has sold the house (although she also admits to not having a written offer yet).  We have also been looking at other rentals.  It's just too soon for us to qualify for a purchase yet :(  Looks like we might go with one of the brand-new ones we looked at in January.  This would make me happy.  I loved that house.  And we'd save $200/month on rent.  That's a ton for us.    Not too much else going on though.  Other than showing the house, and the startling bomb of it selling suddenly, there really was not much happening.  Race at Topeka, which mostly sucked.  Did spend some time in the backyard shooting again (archery).  Enjoyed that.  A hobby is a lot more fun when you don't suck at it.

      It is Monday morning, and my mind is filled with a thousand regrets.&nbsp; There was so much I wanted to have happen, and almost none of it did.&nbsp; Will I ever again have the pleasure of feeling his lips on mine, of his body pressing me against the wall?&nbsp; For all our talk, our teasing, our flirting, all I have to show for the time spent with him is two hugs.&nbsp; Two hugs, and memories of the man who makes me weak, makes my blood run like fire, makes me think of leaving everything behind just to be with him.&nbsp; It was just like old times.&nbsp; It is painfully obvious that the desire is still there, burning strong after nearly two years apart.&nbsp; And yet at the same time, I had fun with him, laughed with him.&nbsp; There is something about him that makes me feel like I'm 18 again, like anything and everything is possible.&nbsp; I guess I can't complain.&nbsp; I was lucky enough to have almost an hour alone with him, just to sit and talk.&nbsp; And, I did get those two hugs.&nbsp; Lord how I've missed him.&nbsp; This will be the difficult part, getting back to life without him, for another whole year.&nbsp; I will try harder next time to spend more time with him.&nbsp;

      Oh boy, less than 48 hours (approx 42, in fact), until I set foot on the property of  urlLink Pacific Raceways , and back to the sport I love dearly.&nbsp; I doesn't really seem like 16 months, but I guess with all the moving and other crap happening, it's kinda been busy in the meantime.&nbsp; I'm really looking forward to seeing some friends that I haven't seen in some time.&nbsp; People like  urlLink Tommy Johnson Jr. , who mysteriously stopped returning emails after his now-wife moved in with him.&nbsp;   And yeah, I know that the two people who read this are sick to the point of death of hearing about  urlLink Herb , but you're just gonna have to endure some more torture.&nbsp; You HAVE to know that I'm completely and thoroughly excited about seeing him again.&nbsp; It's been a long time, that same 16 months.&nbsp; But that time span seems like forever from here.&nbsp; One of my friends asked if I was nervous.&nbsp; And I can honestly say "no", at least right now I'm not.&nbsp; I imagine that about the time I walk up to the ticket counter and plunk down my $32 and head inside, there's a good (read "excellent") chance I'll be shaking like a leaf.&nbsp; I can see myself having to walk thru the entire pit area before working up the nerve to head over there.&nbsp; It'll take me so long to gather my composure that he'll already know I'm at the track.&nbsp; But I'll act all cool...just hang out by the trailer, maybe make a comment to my sister that the view sure is nice from here :)&nbsp;   Speaking of that sister (not that there's more, she's the ONLY sister), Hubby and I had a very interesting conversation yesterday.&nbsp; One in which Herb's name was mentioned in Hubby's presence for the first time in WELL over a year.&nbsp; Sis has been hanging out with a kid she went to school with last quarter.&nbsp; They were lab partners, so it's cool.&nbsp; Except that more and more, she's doing things with him, and not her hubby.&nbsp; Had her over last weekend for dinner and to watch the Denver race.&nbsp; Normally you'd bring hubby or come alone.&nbsp; She brought the other guy.&nbsp; He also helped us move.&nbsp; There is just something about they way the act around each other.&nbsp; Even Herb and I weren't like that, but if we were, it was when we were alone.&nbsp; And I sure as hell didn't bring him over for dinner with the folks.&nbsp; My hubby is completely convinced she's having an affair.&nbsp; I, on the other hand, said that I have my suspicions, but I'm not going to throw accusations around as I know the feeling of being accused of something that's not happening.&nbsp; Hubby actually agreed, and mentioned that "he" (Hern) and I hadn't carried on like that.&nbsp; I totally agreed, and said something about "Kev and I planning church around each other's schedules" (which is what Sis and Other Guy are doing).&nbsp; Weirdness...I mentioned "that" name, and Hubby didn't freak.&nbsp; Maybe we're FINALLY getting somewhere....???

      Well all, we're now only 8 days away from race day.&nbsp; I'm so excited!&nbsp; Making plans to try and maybe go to dinner with Herb.&nbsp; It would just be so cool to hang out and have a meal again.&nbsp; Yeah, I miss the playing, but we enjoyed so many lunches just talking and getting to know each other...I'd really like to do that again.&nbsp; So, I'm hoping the weather will be nice.&nbsp; It seems to rain at damn near every race, except Seattle, of course.&nbsp; There's irony at it's very best.&nbsp; And this year looks to be no different.&nbsp; Some are saying it will be 85 and sunny.&nbsp; That does not make this kitty happy.&nbsp; I'd like to spend one race that I don't have to try and change into shorts at 11am, then back to jeans at 5pm.&nbsp; Bad enough I'll have to bring a warm jacket for morning and evening.&nbsp; So keep your fingers crossed for me that it'll be 72 and partly cloudy :) &nbsp; Not too much else going on.&nbsp; Just working and enjoying the new house.&nbsp; All but done unpacking, finally.&nbsp; I guess that's about it.&nbsp; Hope to post again before next weekend.&nbsp; If I don't, everyone stay safe, and I'll fill you in on all the fun after I get back.&nbsp; Take care!!!

      Today, we buried one of our own...one of our friends, one of our competitors.  He showed us what a good sport was, a gentleman.  My only regret was that I never took the opportunity to meet him.  So many that are gone I never met.  DR, Blaine Johnson, Gary Ormsby, and so many more.  I guess that means I'll just have to take some time, and get to know a few more people at the race in a couple weeks.
