      I am working on a Poem, and I havent finished yet because I have to go to the movies, but heres what I've done (I will probably be doing some rewording):  I live here You live there Here feels nowhere near there I want you here, with me  We may be a few miles away but that doesnt mean I wont travel to come and spend my days, with you   I may play sports to win a trophy But that doesn't mean I won't spare strength to try and win you too  You like diffrent things than I do But that doesn't make me feel a diffrent way about you Because...I love you

      Well one of my best friends thats a girl is mad at me. Which really sucks because she has me and herself confused. I finally get to go see Spider Man 2, today at 3:30. Life sucks being single, though getting dumped is worse, so I can't really tell you if going out is a good idea or not. Just be careful that you stay friends (if you want to) with someone you break up with. Also, your friends are not worth losing over a Gf / Bf. And besides, you have a much better chance of staying friends with your friends than staying together with your Bf / Gf.

      Had an interesting dream last night. I had girls yelling at me about a kid leaving, but I can't remember who the kid is. Scary I guess. I am sick now, so I had to abandon going to see Spider Man 2 at midnight tonight. Going to have to resort to flurting with girls on AIM. ;) No but seriously, I am sick, gonna go lay down, ttyl.

      Ya, well, a commercial for Disneyland came on while I was watching North Shore so I walked out of the room and decided to get on the computer. Life sucks right now. Girls are trying to get me to leave one girl hanging and run off with another one. Which is a real pain, because they are cool, but they refuse to believe that I should try and go back to being friends with my Ex (she just dumped me) before I possibly hook up with this other girl.  Life will be cool tomorrow. I might go see Spider Man 2 at midnight, and that will hopefully help me get away from everything. Life has been a mess lately, I screwed up alot (sort of) and now everything has gone wrong.I have resorted to listening to music since its easy to pick a good style that fits my mood. *snore* good night

      I just woke up at 11:30. Was up till 1:30 AM last night. I finally saw spider man 2, good stuff. I would say it and the last one were the same because they were both good in a diffrent way. I will probably be seeing it again. 4th of July will be fun. I am going to Angel Stadium to see an Angel Vs. Dodgers game. Emily will be there too, I think shes stalking me. (hahaha *pokes emily*) I am still working on that Poem. Going to write a love one, a sorry one, and probably some more love ones.
