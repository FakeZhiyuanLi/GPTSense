      This morning as Daisy andI walked to Majda's, I had an idea for a book. Recentl I've been trying to examine myself to learn what I am capable of writing. Obviously I can write about technolgy as I have been for the the last three years, but can I write about other subjects?  I want to write outdoor adventure articles for magazine and beleive that I can do that, and do it well. As I've been thinking about other topics, I've been asking myself repeatedly what else am I knowledgeable about? It occured to me that I know a little about everything and lot about a few things. Is that not typical of your standard under-achiever?  The idea I had to write would be about stuff. Just stuff. I am confident I can have a conversation on just about any subject matter. Want to to talk politics over breakfast and then about software development at lunch? Each chpater would be a different conversation. With who you aks? I don't know. That part is still under development in my head.  I have not told Majda this idea yet as I think she may not understand or think it is off the wall. My current plans are to write a synopsis on index cards for each chapter of my new bestseller. Who knows.I may be the Jerry Sienfeld of the publishing world.  I called the notary today and made arrangements to transfer the house to my name, then to Gord's. It caused some anxiety and distraced me from the column I should be comleting this morning. I emailed Gord and updated him (not much to tell him,) and emailed Paula's lawyer confrming that was indeed using John's office for the property transfer.  Majda and I saw the movie Troy last night. Majda really enjoyed it. She informed me that she loves fight scenes, especially ones that involve swords. Perhaps I can have her watch Gladiator without falling asleep. I know she would that blackbuster too.  We had a good time, the two of us. Other that a cold theatre,we enjoyed each others company; exchchanging smiles and kisses throughout the movie.  Anyways, I should get back to some real writing.

      I've been wanting to start ablog for awhile now. I' ve been thinking it might be fun,if not therapeutic. I will make an attempt to jot down my thoughts and perhaps a journal of the events of my days and weeks. I won't say months yet. That is too much of a comittment.  The other reason I thought starting a blog would be good idea is it becauseit provides me with another medium to pratice my craft. Afterall I am a writer now. like most craftsmen, I must refine and perfect my craft. Meaning, practice a lot.  Wish me luck.  C
