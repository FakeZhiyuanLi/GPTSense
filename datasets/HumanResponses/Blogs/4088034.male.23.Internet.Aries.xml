       I've been noticing a recurring theme in movies and philosophies recently. "Find your life", "Live the life you were born to live", "You've already made the choice. Now you have to understand why you made it". From "The Sound of Music" to "The Matrix" to Buddhist philosophy and good business practice, it is suggested that we think ahead and look for opportunities to get us where we want to be.  I am beginning to think that whether or not I believe in fate, this is a good way to live. It is yet another way of having a purpose. If you have a goal for the future, then you simply need to keep it in mind, discuss it with a few people, and see if you are presented with opportunities that will get you closer to your goal. Your goals are your self-determined purpose. The only thing keeping everyone from making and meeting goals simply seems to be motivation. I suppose it's the same reason that some people don't exercise -- you don't see any results until you do it. We don't exercise and don't try to meet our goals because we have a desire for instant gratification.  I, for one, am trying to shed my desire for instant gratification. One of the things I've realized recently is that there is a price for pleasure. That price is hard work and sacrifice. Call it good times and bad times, happiness and misery, pleasure and pain, or simply the vicissitudes of life but there are, inevitably, times when you will not be enjoying yourself. You don't always get to choose these times but sometimes you do.  Obviously, if we never had to pay for anything, we wouldn't. So it's not that we want to pay but we have to. Of course, getting money out of your wallet and handing it to someone is much easier than say public speaking for a shy person or mowing the lawn when you're tired. Every day there are things that need to be done and most of us don't do them because we choose idle pleasure that is free or can be bought over true pleasure with a cost that can't be paid in cash. Sleep, sex, movies, drugs, food, alcohol, video games, and others are often used as a distraction from things that need to be done.  There are other things that we don't need to do but that we should do. The example of public speaking for a shy person is perhaps the best I can think of. A shy person may tell themselves "I'm shy and that's just the way I am" but there will inevitably be times where that person will want to speak up or do something that requires them to be confident. Whether or not they do it is entirely up to them and most people chicken out in situations like these. We fail to challenge ourselves. For me, I've realized it's the possibility of failure that scares me.  In "The Way of the Samurai", Tsunetomo Yamamoto gives us the following passage:  "I have found the essence of Bushido: to die! In other words, when you have a choice between life and death, then always choose death: this is all that you must remember. It is neither troublesome nor difficult. You have only to go on with a clenched stomach. Any other ideas are unnecessary and futile." ... "It goes without saying that every person would prefer to live rather than to die. Accordingly, people will try to rationalize for the choice of life."  This is perhaps my favourite passage in the whole book. It also applies to the choice between grabbing a life-altering opportunity and sitting idly by because you want to stick to habit. Choosing death does not always mean that you are going to die. It simply means that you are going to make the choice that you are only afraid to make because of the chance of failure. Not approaching the person of your dreams because you're afraid of rejection is another good example.  Another favourite line of mine is from a Goo Goo Dolls song called Acoustic #3. Most sites have the lyrics saying "What's the point in ever trying, nothing's changing anyway". I don't believe that this is what the lyrics are meant to say. I think they're meant to say "What's the point in never trying, nothing's changing anyway". If you never try, you will never know whether or not you would have succeeded. And if you try and fail, then not only will you do better next time, but you will learn about your own limitations. The trick is to never stop trying. So go out there and live the life you were born to live.

       My father recently had a heart attack and, if nothing else, it allowed me to confirm one thing which I had long suspected -- near-death experiences aren't always as life-altering as movies make them seem. It is true that humans are creatures of habit and that old habits die hard. But changing habits doesn't necessarily change who you are or how you approach life. So is sudden enlightenment a myth or just a temporary state of mind that is washed away by the waters of habit?  I know I've experienced sudden enlightenment. The resulting changes lasted about a year and then I started slipping back into many self-destructive habits. What is it about our culture that leads us to self-destructive behaviour? Why all the junk food, alcohol, drugs, tobacco, caffeine, promiscuous sex, and self-destructive social behaviour? Honestly, I think it's due to the faith vaccuum that's been created by science. Science has explained away God and replaced him with a few technical answers and a lot more questions.  People who believe fervently in God are never without purpose because they believe that God has a "divine plan". People who truly believe in fate have a similar sense of purpose. So I suppose people who believe in nothing, especially those who vehemently believe in nothing, have no purpose. It is undoubtedly this lack of purpose that causes us to engage in self-destructive behaviour.  If you have no purpose, you simply distract yourself with your senses. You eat even when you're not hungry just so you can taste. You have sex with no intention just for the pleasure it brings you. You say things you don't mean just to get a reaction. You do drugs because you find no pleasure in reality. There are many self-destructive behaviours we engage in each day. With no moral authority to follow and sense of self-accomplishment, you  just kill time until you die.

       Growing up, I was always curious and observant. I tried to absorb as much as I could so that I could come to understand the things I did not. I have noticed in recent years that although I am still curious and observant, I do not have the same drive as I used to. I have concluded that the search for truth and knowledge must be made by each individual into a quest.  When you have nothing to do, it is because you have no purpose and when you have no purpose, you are idle. Some read, some play video games, some sleep. The question I've recently been asking myself is: "Why should I wait to be assigned a purpose?" It seems to me that if I have any control over my own life, it is in choosing the purpose of my life. At this point, I am not sure what purpose I can serve but I do know that I am still very ignorant. Therefore, the most immediate purpose I can assign myself is learning. I find it fitting that this immediate purpose is also the one purpose that will remain inexhaustible.  This blog is, therefore, a journal to keep track of what I learn in such a way that I can refer to it and in such a way that others can learn from it as well. That is not to say that if I am learning Spanish, I will type up grammar lessons et cetera but I may link to a page where such lessons can be found. Although most of the learning I wish to discuss here is self-learning. Learning about observable phenomena within myself as well as phenomena observable of friends, family, co-workers, acquaintances, and strangers.
