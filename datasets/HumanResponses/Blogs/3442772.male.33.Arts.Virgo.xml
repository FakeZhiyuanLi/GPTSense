      It's very frustrating for the rest of us who know what we're doing and have to instruct those who dont time and time again. THERE ARE ONLY 2 IMAGE FORMATS YOU NEED TO WORRY ABOUT: .gif and .jpg (JPEG) - Please stop with the BMP's, .exe's, etc, etc. THEY ARE NOT UNIVERSAL TO ALL COMPUTING PLATFORMS!!!  - For images: (ie: photos and other "graphics", etc) just use gif's (for flat color images like simple logos, etc) or jpg's (for images that contain more variants of color like photos). Anything else is open for trouble and probably not universal to ALL computers and software. ANYONE with ANY web browser can open a JPEG or a GIF! Of course if you are an AOhelL user, you're shit out of luck because AOL likes to convert jpegs on non-aol users often by turning them into a bunch of useless garbled text(MIME format) and unfortunately, Amateur.. ...oops I mean America Online users are not given the functionality of being able to set this in "properties" or preferences - go figure. - For movie file formats: please stick to MPEGs, they seem to work for everyone more than most the others (avi, .exe, etc)   To learn how to properly save a jpeg or a gif (especially from Adobe Photoshop) I have made a page on how to format images for print or web.This will give you better luck with dealing with images to and from people via the internet. ~ MS

      Shame on you. Shame on you for taking the ex-patriot route. Shame on you for taking such an extreme line against your own country who's trying to do for the welfare of the rest of the planet. You should not be allowed back to teach in your schools. What will you teach or report to your students? Biased, extreme leftist angles of view, or the truth? You should at least be chastised by your public upon your return. ~ MS

      Ok, so you're sitting there crudely typing out shorthand-like messages to your friends who are sending & receiving vice versa. YOU BOTH HAVE PHONES IN YOUR HANDS SO WHY DONT YOU PICK THE FRIGGIN THINGS UP TO YOUR EARS AND TALK TO EACH OTHER FOR PETE'S SAKE??? You are the type who need a lil' slap on the back of the head.

      .......something I've taken a step towards cuting down!  I am downgrading from my un-economical, unnecessary, gas guzzling, 4.8L V8 Magnum Dodge Durango and just purchased a much more economical 2004 2L 4cyl Chevy Malibu.  It's time for the SUV trend to END!  ... so I did my part! I DO NOT want to support O.P.E.C. any more than we already do! Everyone these days buys an SUV for social status and out of trend. Of course we all know MOST of those trucks out there will NEVER be used for what they were REALLY designed for, and just end up being a glorified shopping cart for yuppie moms, etc. I can't help but laugh out loud when I see some rich bitch yuppie soccer mom load her groceries into her hi-tek Humvee. HELLOOOOOO!!!...    ..that monster of a truck was designed for climbing mountains and traversing rivers, not bringing home groceries!!! Gimme a f___g break!!  That really ticks me off. That thing will be bright and shiny for good and NEVER see a SPECK of offroad dirt!  Maybe someday when I own a boat or some ATV's or whatever and need some power to tow a trailer, or, if I sincerely need it for an actual real utility, THEN I might consider another one again.  BUT.... until it is absolutely necessary, economical is the way to go. I'm not veign, I don't give a flying crap WHAT you see me driving!  I need more money in my pocket,  and less for the evil creatures of the middle east!

      Yeah, that's right... I said that whiney, sissy, crybaby, loveyduvy, all-about-a-girl, lovestory punk rock they call EMO just plain  S U C K S   Bands like Simple Plan, Brand New, Good Charlette, Yellowcard, New Found Glory, Dashboard Confessional... ok... Got the picture?  I can almost listent to country easier than that crap. ...and I grew up on punk rock to boot!  However, the "punk rock" that I chewed on as an adolescent was more like Agent Orange, Faction, Descendents, Fear, Black Flag, Minor Threat, Dag Nasty, 7 Seconds, Clash, Ramones, Bad Brains, Hogan's Heroes, Murphy's Law, Gorilla Biscuits, Token Entry, etc, etc, etc....  Why am I barking about new school emo-punk?  Because now it's all about the vid on MTV and crap like that.  It's all about crying over some girl breaking up with you and other sappy shit.  They dress like they're some kind of badasses yet their their lyrics and the way the whine-n-cry them paints them as a bunch of PUSSIES.  PUHLEEEZZZZZ!  Punk was SUPPOSED to be about not conforming to what the 'establishment' wanted you to be and proposed for you to be individualistic. Now all the young emo punk bands look EXACTLY like each other. Nothing individualistic there folks. It's as if there is a uniform for it or you're "not cool". Gimme a break. From what I remember, Jello Biaffra looked nothing like Ian McCaye who looked nothing like Henry Rollins, who looked nothing like Kevin Seconds who looked nothing like Mike Palm... and so on and so on. Git the picture?  Ok, finally got that off my chest.   :-)

      It's a Jerk, It's a Vandal, It's Superman! Another from FOX News.....   A 21-year-old man dressed as Superman was arrested Sunday in Ann Arbor, Mich., for allegedly attacking a carful of other young men, reports WDIV-TV of Detroit.  The victims had just stopped their car outside a house party to talk to some friends on the street when the savage Superman jumped out of the bushes.  "I guess this young man jumped in the back seat of the victim's vehicle and just started hitting him," said Ann Arbor Police Sgt. Angella Abrams. "When the victim attempted to call using his cell phone, [Superman] grabbed the cell phone and he stomped on it."  The men all got out of the car, and as the victims confronted the caped crusader, a large group of the would-be Clark Kent's friends came out of the house.  A street brawl broke out, according to the Ann Arbor News. Superman's friends didn't appear to have any super powers, or perhaps the car's occupants were armed with Kryptonite (search), because cops had to come break it up.  Two of the men showed police digital pictures they'd taken of Superman, and cops easily picked him out of the crowd.  "He was in costume, and it was a pretty terrible Superman costume at that," said one witness.  Superman's motive was not known. His name was being withheld pending assault charges. ...........................................  Ya just gotta love having at least SOME wacky people in this country!  Makes for god news.  :-)

      Train Taunter Hit by Locomotive FOX NEWS: Thursday, July 22, 2004  An angry, wheelchair-bound Wisconsin man who enjoys flipping off freight trains may have to cut back on his hobby — one of the trains hit him.  Leland Laird, 54, was at his customary position, middle finger proudly aloft, next to the train tracks in Appleton at about 7:30 p.m. Tuesday evening, reports the Appleton Post-Crescent.  That's when a Canadian National (search) engine's gas tank clipped Laird's wheelchair, sending him tumbling to the ground.  Laird, who suffered only mild cuts and abrasions, told police he was paralyzed by a train that hit his car in 1989 — but that wasn't the reason he liked shooting them the bird.  "He was upset by the horns," Appleton Police Lt. Pat Matuszewski told the newspaper. "He lives right near the intersection. That's his way of addressing the loud horns blowing."  Engineers and conductors are apparently used to seeing Laird's finger flag flying high and consider him a "regular."  The Canadian National train stopped after hitting Laird's chair while police responded. Laird was given a ticket for being a pedestrian in violation of traffic signals. ....................................................               I have one thing to say.......   DUMBASS!

      NEWS FLASH!.....  World Even More Fucked Up Than You Thought, Studies Reveal 07/19/04   REBEL HOLLER, Georgia  A scientific analysis of literally thousands of recent government and university studies reveals that the world is even more fucked up than you thought.  The studies demonstrate that most people are dishonest, lazy, and have at least one body part in dire need of better hygiene.  Just under half of all people are stupid, approximately a quarter suffer from undiagnosed mental illnesses, and roughly four in ten enjoy disgusting sexual fantasies on a daily basis.  Organizations fare no better than individuals in the studies, beginning with the world's corporations, which squander billions of dollars annually on luxurious perks for executives and Internet porn for everybody else.  Governments at all levels waste even more money, primarily on Internet porn-blocking software and worthless studies that are highly critical of corporations.  Meanwhile, religious organizations waste less money than corporations or governments but are responsible for the majority of the world's violence and child molestation.  The most disturbing findings, however, center on the world's Internet users, who spend inordinate amounts of time surfing worthless crap on the web while touching themselves inappropriately through their clothing.  On the bright side, the studies reveal that business is booming for handbasket manufacturers worldwide and for real estate developers in hell.  ©2004 RealStupidNews.com

      WELP......I'm back from another surf adventure in Central America! PHEEEW! And WHAT an adventure!  This was my second time visiting a remote jungle camp off the Pacific coast of Panama, about 80 miles east of Pavones Costa Rica. Although there were some improvements to the camp, the "roughing it" feel is still 100% eminent.   Truly 3rd world in that region, when I say 3rd world, I mean as in the local indigents live with no electricity, live off the land and sea, etc... full on jungle living comparable to the way the American Indians lived 250 yrs ago during the threshold of being modernized with actual clothes, modern irigation and building construction. I mean they are still living under thatched roofs down there.  This doesnt parallel with the majority consensus of typical Central American society though, because a quick jaunt to Panama City, Costa Rica, etc will display otherwise, with nice restaurants, modern shopping malls (the "MultiCentro" mall in Panama City was NICER than most of the malls in my county here in NJ!), etc.  HOWEVER, these people dont have a damn complaint in the world, and smile MUCH more often than the average american, they are SOO much more at peace with ther surroundings. Us Americans, ESPECIALLY ones who have never been to 3rd world country, NEED to take lesson from this: they have so much less but are so much more happy.  Other than the culture shock of coming BACK to metro-NJ and sinking back into this overweight, over-indulgent, materialistic, jaded, hypocritical society we call America (but dontchya just LOVE it? :-), the trip was yet another success! Like the last time I went there, we scored excellent waves, beautiful WARM water, and generally beautful tropoical paradise.  Next trip?  Indo? Peru? More Centro? .... dunno, but something new for sure. NOTHING beats the adventure of experiencing a new destination.... ESPECIALLY when the waves go off!
