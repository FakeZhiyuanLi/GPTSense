      I went to my dads funeral today. I was a Pual barrer, I think that is what it was called... In other words I carried the casket along with some others. It was depressing, as most funerals are.

      Woot home from texas. Fun time. I drove a scooter into a couch then nocked a table with a plant over. I didn't even get in trouble. However kirk got in lots of trouble all the time. For not doing much at all. The rodeo we went to was fun, they were very mean to the animals and yeah... six flags  was cool.  (The blog dates are wrong.. had to remake the blog. So I posted the actual dates for the topic.)

      I haven't updated news in awhile, been to busy. Well, good news first. I got a job, I started working. It's an awesome place to work there is so many extra benifits and such working there. It's Byerly's btw. But yeah bad news. My family is depressed. Mom and G'ma espesually. Mom locked herself in room today scared rest of us to death. Police were called to break in. Sucked ass. This is all due to stress coming from the huge legal battle of my dads funds after he died, and how we have NO money left at all. Every bill is becoming late. Even worse, my mom can't take it anymore. She has been put thruo so much she is bursting. Now it is up to me and my brother, 16 and 17 yr olds to fight our grandfather(Dad's dad) in court for the rightful money that is ours. The hatred between certian family members and others is at its peak. Shit is hitting the fan. On top of that our lawyers trust is in jepreody. I am sure tomarrow will play a major roll in My mom's, Borther's, g'ma's, and My future. If I dont post for awhile it's becuase we will need to cut internet to save money. We'll see what happens.
