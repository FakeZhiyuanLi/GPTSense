      Yep, we finally have some warm weather in Winnipeg!&nbsp; We're taking advantage of it by hitting the beach and going to the&nbsp;cabin to waterski and spend time with folks.&nbsp; Lots of fun-all the muscles in between my knees and my neck hurt from all the kayaking and skiing!&nbsp; It's a great feeling:-)

      I love Last Comic Standing-Gary Gulman rocks! I hope he wins, he's way more funny than anyone else that is on the show.&nbsp; Amazing Race is awesome too-I'm not a person that generally likes to watch a lot of TV, but Tuesday nights are quickly becoming a favorite at our house.

      I am frustrated. There, I said it.&nbsp; I've been going through lots of inner turmiol lately in regards to my relationship with Christ.&nbsp; I've been lacking in passion and motivation, and really dissatisfied at where I'm at in my relationship with Him.&nbsp; I want so badly to be back in that place of being in close communion with God.&nbsp; We've just left the church that we were involved in because it met Sunday nights, which is the only time we see Stu's family.&nbsp; His family is going thru a rough time at this point, and we think that we should be there them.&nbsp;&nbsp; We felt that it was unfair to the church if we couldn't completely commit and&nbsp;be able to serve there.&nbsp; I read this and think that it's a completely petty and selfish.&nbsp; So now we're looking for new church family.&nbsp; Boy is it hard. Especially when I don't feel super close to God at this point.&nbsp; It's so AMAZING to know that God won't give up on me, and to have the hope that He and I will be in that place of awesome closeness once again.

      Lots of great movies out this summer.  We're off to see "The Bourne Supremacy" tonight.  For awhile now, we've been trying to be more picky about the movies we watch.  There is so much garbage out there that really does have an impact on our thoughts and how we live our lives.  I don't ever want to be a legalistic person, but I really think that as Christians we need to be careful about what we are feeding our minds.  It's really crazy that the media has major influence when it comes to making decisions, our ethics, and our walk with Christ.  At the same time,  art and the media can be an awesome and powerful way to reach people for Christ.

      Yep,  I have a connection to Shane Wiebe from Canadian Idol.  Never met the guy, but he's the nephew(or something like that) to my grandmother(OK, Step-Grandmother actually) I did my part by voting for him this week-ain't I a sweetie!
