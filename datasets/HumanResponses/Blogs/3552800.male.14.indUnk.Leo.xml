      what is zxcv? i don't really know, but in zxcvology, this question comes up again, and again, and again, and again, and again, and again, and again, and again, and again, and again, and again, and again, and again, and again, and again, and again, and again, and again, and again, and again, and again, and again, and again, and again, and again, and again, and again, and again, and again, and again, and again, and again, and again. an EZ way to explain this turning up of the "What?" again, and again, and again, and again, and again, and again, and again, and again, and again, and again, and again, and again, and again, and again, and again, iz couse that is the main point of "zxcvology." break it up:      zxcv  our topic, of course     o  a connector     logy  Study of     zxcvology  the study of zxcv     now that that is here, we shall start our deelie  ACRONYM  the acronym may help us in our journey of finding out the truth of zxcv, it will be a good starting point     Z  zigzag     X  xenon     C  Canid     V  varied      Okay, "zigzag" is a zxcv scrambled? Possibly a lost soul? "Xenon" xenon is a gaseous element. does this mean that zxcv is gaseous? or possibly more than real? is it... spiritual in some way? "Canid" is a zxcv a canine being? a fox, or wolf perhaps? "varied" is zxcv a something that's not always the same?  mebbe the answer is beyond an acronym, but for now, we will not delve further at this moment...

        alot ov thingz r lime, theres Limewater, Limes Desiese, Electric Lime, Limegreen, and Matrix. this, i believe, iz largely due to the fact that Lime soundz cool. there, of course iz an exception for Limes Desiese, but, then again thatz "Limes", an' not "Lime".  I believe that the color "Lime" would be the best color to represent the sacred letter-conjunction of "zxcv"   ********** *Peace out* **********

      As my friend mentioned earlier, many websites and blogs have delved deeply into the concept of Zxcv, so we are going to delve deeply into the concept, past all those pathetic fools who are still mucking about in their pit mines and quarries, until we delve straight through the concept and break it, which will make the world be filled with anarchy and chaos, which would be kind of funny, but frankly we don't care, so we're just going to get on with the delving. Most people would believe that Zxcv is lowert in the hierarchy of letter formations than Asdf, because, on the keyboard, Zxcv is directly below Asdf, but it is quite the contrary. In the quaint world of simple four-unit letter formations Qwer is the warlord/king. Zxcv, being his thane (personal bodygaurds of the Dark Age in northern Europe were referred to as thanes) is placed  high above any other four-letter formation in the hierarchy, as therebeing no heir to the throne. Now Asdf, being a salt merchant, acquired a small fortune from selling salt to the rich formations. Unfortunately, for him, there came a decline of rich people in the Universe, as noted in  The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy , which caused his overall sales begin to wane. Eventually he was cast onto the streets, all his petty businesses having failed. He then tried his luck as a pickpocket, but was terrible. He was eventually cast into a local prison for stealing turnips. He claimed at his trial that he was not going to eat them, but throw them at little mushroom guys, but then he was also sued by whatever company owns Mario, for violating their copywrights. Zxcv, however, remained a faithful thane to his king for the next seven or eight coming millennia. Qwer and Zxcv remained youthful and strong by manner of the golden apples of youth, suppliedby Odin, in exchange for helping keep the frost giants at bay.

      many sites have dolve deeply into Qwerty, and Asdf, but none(at least not many... okay, a sizable amount... okay a... just leave me alone...-*wounded expresion*-) have dolve so deeply into it as us- or at least will be some time from now. well any way, we r currently working on it -me and my friend Æthelbert aka Jiminy Fitz aka Stefan- that is.
