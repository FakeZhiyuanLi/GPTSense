       urlLink    JOE&nbsp; urlLink     Average_Joe is the avatar of the week because he's kind, funny, and everyone loves having him around. He's definitely MORE than average as I have never heard a bad word said about him! Joe is the leader of the group "Joes in There", whether or not your name is Joe, you should take a look at it. Thanks for being such a great person to be around, Average_Joe!  You can view his There profile  urlLink HERE .

      'sigh...I like blogging too much! rofl! This is my THIRD blog and I think I'll probably end up forgetting about my Geocities one, as the java client to make it SUCKS. ANYWAYS, I'll hopefully write in this blog every day and use my other blog for what it was made for: There Events, articles, and the like...but that means I'll actually have to attend events...nahhhhhh. Might keep this blog a secret that not everyone knows about: I have NO idea as to who reads my newsletter!  My other two Blogs can be found here:   urlLink Andorra's Newsletter for There events    urlLink Emily's Site  (This one was supposed to be for rl stuff but...that didn't work out too well because I didn't want to talk about rl in the end.)   urlLink    It's ME...yeah...I couldn't find a place to put my picture for the url for my profile so I had to post it so I could take the url *hangs head in shame*.&nbsp; urlLink

      I don't know who to pick for this week in There because no one has logged in! Well...except Gbcue...but I was saving his avie for a special day! So, depending on what I choose to do, Gbcue might have a write up in this spot tomorrow.  HOWEVER, here is an update on Avatar of the Week from last week, Average_Joe. Joe has a new page on his website for recipes.  urlLink It's worth a look!

       I'm going to be taking a break and I will not be back until at least after the 31st (the time of the next full moon). I feel that I need to just escape things and "die" so to speak. I will be working on my main website perhaps, but I'm not going to log the updates until my return. A similar article can be seen on my xanga  urlLink HERE .   Be well.

      I skipped a few "...of the Week" days but I'm not without my reasons. Thursday I was having a horrible day and decided against making a post and Friday...well on Friday I can't remember why I didn't post. Anyways, I'm going to make a big post on Monday with all the things that I SHOULD have posted, along with the usual "Picture of the Week".

       urlLink    .BatteryPoison.&nbsp; urlLink     Ok, first I'm going to tell those who don't know what an "avatar" is. Avatars have many uses, but the ones you'll see here are for forums. They are the little pictures you see that represent the people posting their comments in the forum..."What is a forum?" I hear you ask? A forum is like a message service where people can log into and post comments about certain topics. Anyways, my favourite forum avatar for the week is by the one known as .BatteryPoison. from the forum Gothic.net.  The particular post from which I took the picture can be found  urlLink HERE .

       urlLink    PristonTale&nbsp; urlLink     PristonTale is a free  urlLink MMRPG  that has been out for a while. There was *sniffle* boring because no one was online *sheds a tear* so I decided to look at some MMRPG reviews. Searching in vain for a good, free MMRPG I remembered about a game my friend David Woo (a.k.a. Wavid_Doo to you Thereians) called “PristonTale”. I had wanted to start the game long before, but I was unable to, as I was using my dad’s computer and even after that my computer had no Internet hooked up for a while. Anywho, I started playing this game not too long ago and I’m very impressed, although, as explained in the title of this post, the game is very much like Diablo 2, mixed with Lineage 2, anime style. However, the game is amusing and is 100% free! Another good thing about it is there is no  urlLink PKing  by people of your “race”, the group of people you are allied with. There are two different races: Tempskron and Morion. Each race has four different character classes. Tempskron’s character classes are the Mechanician, the Fighter, the Pikeman, and the Archer while Morion’s character classes are the Knight, the Atalana, the Priestess, and the Magician. You can find complete information on these two races and their classes in the beginner guide on the  urlLink PristonTale website .  The controls for the game are quite simple, child’s play…it’s the camera controls that are a bit tricky, even if you use the auto camera lock, which controls your camera automatically so you don’t have to. You’ll find that when you get the camera controls down pat you’ll enjoy the game much more, and you will have an easier time in battle.   Like all games, the difficulty of the monsters grows as you wander further away from your home city. At first, you are attacked by cute little monsters, and then eventually mean, ugly goblins, and so forth, but even the cute monsters can kill you if you’re not paying attention to them. You can find a list of monsters on the main  urlLink PristonTale website  under Guide > Game Info.  All in all, I believe this to be a good game! The screenshots  urlLink [1]   urlLink [2]   urlLink [3]  I have do not do this game justice…as they suck…so if you want to see the game in all it’s glory for yourself, you’ll have to get in game, because even the screenshots on the main website are not sufficient.   System Requirements:  Minimum: O S : Windows98/Me/2000/XP CPU : Celeron 300 RAM : 128MB VGA : 3D Acceleration Video Card /w 16MB RAM ETC : DirectX 7.0 or above, 56K Modem  Recommended: O S : Windows98/Me/2000/XP CPU : Pentium III 450 RAM : 256MB VGA : 3D Acceleration Video Card /w 16MB RAM ETC : DirectX 7.0 or above, ISDN/ADSL/Cable

      Ok, I have three blogs related to There...why not make at least ONE for real life. I have one that will be a bit of both, but this one is STRICTLY for other things. So, if you find anything related to There on this blog TELL ME and I'll remove it a.s.a.p. I'll post here about other games and such, or about how my day went. I have Live Journal for that, but hell, why not make a blog for it too seeing as I have Blogitis.

       urlLink    Cheshire Cat from American McGee's Alice&nbsp; urlLink     I have some quotes for you, my faithful reader, directly from the Cheshire Cat himself. Bask in his wisdom, for it can help those who are in a time of darkness.  - Whoever says too much of a good thing is not enough speaks the truth.  - Those who say there's nothing like a good cup of tea for calming the nerves never had real tea. It's like a syringe of adrenaline straight to the heart.  - Threats, promises, and good intentions don't amount to action.  - Every adventure requires a first step. Trite but true, even here (Wonderland).  - Only the foolish believe suffering is just wages of being different.  - Only the insane equate pain with success.  - Every picture tells a story. Sometimes we don't like the ending. Sometimes we don't understand it.   - Cats are colourblind, you know. Kaleidascopes hold no interest for us.  - A reflection sometimes exposes more reality than the object it echoes.  - Look staight ahead, or askance. Whichever way you choose you must always look in the right direction.  - Bravery and I are not on intimate terms. My natural curiosity is tempered with caution. Thus I've lived long.   Next time, a little bit of knowledge from Alice herself.

      Today after school, I recieved an e-mail from my dear friend Allison Clarke:   Someone asked me whether goths thought that death was the ultimate experience. I didn't think so, but I figured best to ask you. You know a ton more than I do.   My reply:   Interesting...well some do and some don't. It depends on what kind of Goth they are and their personality. To me, death is just another adventure waiting for you after life...except a much more pleasant if you lived your life well. Anyways, about the different types of Goths; you have the mopy Goths who are sitting around waiting to die or else speeding up death because well...according to them "life sucks", they would agree. "Death Rockers" the original Goths are...well you could almost call them punks digused as Goths because that's what goth branched from, they might agree depending on their personality. The perky Goths (probably me), the Glitter Goths...the list goes on...and those ones "live life to the fullest" (a cliche, *cringe*) and would not agree. Vampyre Goths...yeah they'd agree with that statement, and then you have "Manson's little followers" who would also agree with that statement...but Manson isn't Goth! OMG I'm going to stop there, I could go on and on...   In summary: NO, N-O, nope...and so forth.

For those of you who read my blog or blogs, you may be wondering why I have not been posting as planned. Well some things have come up that have made my life very depressing *cough* my dad *cough* and so, until I fix things, I will only be posting when I feel I am able to work on anything at all.&nbsp; urlLink

      Last night I said to my good friend Nigel, "I am SO happy!" because I had gone to the carnival with my friend Stacey and Brent and had a great time. Nigel said he had never heard me say that...he also said that he thought I was dying. My friend Stacey once logged into MSN and IMed me and told me I had died. X_x  &nbsp;  Odd, odd people. Perhaps I was dying...or perhaps I died...or what if I'm still dying and this happiness is just fake...who knows for sure...will I ever truely be happy? &nbsp; I&nbsp;haven't decided yet, ask me again in a month if I live that long.
