						   Well, I wasn't sure I was going to do a blog today, but I guess I will, seeing as how I'll be leaving for vacation Friday afternoon and won't return for a week. I'll post how it was then. And then I'm off again, to help out at a summer camp for younger boys, grades 3rd through 6th or something like that. I was in the group that's going when I was that age, so it might be nice to go.  Well, I wrote a new song today, although I'm not sure its as good as "Forgive Us", but I kind of like it. Basically, its just about people (especially those in authority) who try to put us in some sort of conformity box, to try and make us be what THEY want us to be. Its a nice little ditty, with a pretty keyboard part to go with it...OK we all know I'm joking there, but what the heck. Its not my fault keyboards are boring. OK, maybe they're not boring, but most songs that feature them are just not my style...I'm just gonna post the song and shut-up already.   The Box  I can smell the concrete and hear the mixing in your head Thinking of what's to come, I wish I was dead I strike out at the plywood stands, but I'm beat back You pretend to give me everything I lack When, in truth, I can get those things myself, alone I see your blind conviction and it chills me to the bone Stop it now, before we're both locked in our pain Can't you see there's nothing to gain?  (Chorus) You'll never keep me in a box Build it for yourself You'll never keep me in a box I don't want to match you You'll never keep me in a box Don't put me on the shelf  What am I to do now that the bricks are stacking up? I should not, will not, cannot, shut-up! A hammer to the structure only does so much I'm crippled, without a crutch Blackness is closing in as the ceiling is built I can feel my spirit begin to wilt My box, my home, is a dark place now But still, I will never bow!  (Chorus)  My scream lets out and the concrete begins to splinter I'm in for a very frigid winter I push my bleeding hand through the hole I've made And the walls begin to crumble and fade I'm in for so much more, I can see But in the box I'll never be! So the choice is now yours to make Do you want to live a real life, or continue this fake?  (Chorus)   Well, while you stew on that and come up with all the reasons it suck/rocks to then put in a comment *hint hint*, I'll ramble some more. I wasn't joking in the title, most of this post is just random stuff that comes up as I think of it.  Well, the Algebra class is over. I escaped with a B, which made me happy. I could take the final and try to get an A, but I'd have to get a 96 or better to do it...not gonna happen. It was kind of depressing today, because we were only supposed to go if we wanted to get the review for the final and only 8 people showed up from a class of about 20. And tomorrow, only about 5 will be there, because the rest of us are happy with our grades and are exempt from the test because we came to class!  David and I have been working hard on the freeform RPG we're working on, and its coming along nicely. I was a little disappointed in the logo he drew up for it, but the lettering he did was nice and I'm going to use it in the site. The game will be on the server at www.mysteryandmagic.com. I'd suggest to ANYONE who likes RPing to check out that site and look at the different games: they're all FREE!!! If you want more information from someone who plays one some of them, or anything like that, leave me a comment and I'll email you. *Another hint about leaving comments...*  I'm not the only one writing up a storm of songs, Warlock has come up with some too. I won't post those though, since I didn't write them and they're not my material. It wouldn't be cool.  Well, I recently visited the city library and happened across one of my favorite books: Flowers for Algernon. Its amazing, I've got a really good memory for books and I knew EXACTLY what would happen in the book, and yet I couldn't stop myself from getting it and reading it for what I think is the 4th time for me to read it. If you haven't read the full novel version, I would suggest you check it out. It honestly makes you think. Its the story of a retarded man who's given a surgery to increase his IQ to such a level that he becomes a genius and then...well...I think I'll leave it at that before I reveal too much. This is one of the only books I've ever read that I actually felt emotional while I read and I'll admit that the first time I read it, a few years ago, I almost cried. Its a VERY sad story, quite a tear jerker but not in some sappy stupid way. Beautifully done.  Painting sucks. Beautiful recently decided to paint her room and all the furniture in it and I, of course, offered to help. She'd already started when I got there, so I helped her paint some of the walls, and then I had to leave. The next day, the walls were basically done except for one, and we moved on to furniture because we couldn't get to the wall effectively without getting some furniture out of there. So, we did that, and finally I had to go AGAIN! So, the THIRD DAY, we finished...FINALLY! Of course, Beautiful did most of it because she had to be there constantly, so she got to have more 'fun' than me. Truly, it was a lot of fun, because we got to hang out and talk a lot while we painted. That's probably why it took so long. Either way, it would have been a lot worse had we not done it together, but since we did it together, it was fun.

						   OK, I know its been a little while since my last post. It'll probably be like that for a while until stuff starts happening again, like school and all that. So, without any further time wasting, my first subject: Happy Returns.  Beautiful has returned! Arriving at 1:05 on Friday, I picked Beautiful up and we had quite the adventure! After getting her bag, which was packed tight enough that we had to handle with care, rather we blast the nearby people with clothing, we headed to what I will simply refer to as the Can. The Can is my truck: a silver 1991 GMC side-step...or step-side...I don't know cars! Either way, the Can is not a very...reliable source of transportation, considering the AC has gone out on it twice, the gas gauge seems to randomly decide when to work, and the CD player is an absolute piece. OK, I know the CD thing isn't a "major" thing to most people, but if you didn't notice by "The Sound of Music", its a big deal to me.  I might as well talk about this now, the Can actually looks much more like the junker I consider it to be since I recently had an...accident in it. I've told this story about 30 times to various people who always say the EXACT SAME THING. "What happened to your truck?"  I realize this is the most obvious question to ask when there's a rather large and oddly shaped dent on the front left quarter panel, but it is a pretty annoying question. So, I look at them, and tell the story I'm going to tell now. There's an S shaped curve near where Beautiful lives and as I was heading home one night on it, it was raining very hard. As I took the last part of the curve, the back end of the truck began to slide! Being the quick-thinking individual I am, I effectively turned into the swerve. Which would have straightened the truck out and I would have been fine. But, as my luck goes, I ALSO reached up to slam the brake...which is a no-no when your car/truck is sliding. The best part is, however, that my foot edged the brake, and slammed down on the accelerator! That's all I remember, except for the sound as my truck slammed into a 50-pound sand filled barrel. Lots of fun.  Skip about 2 months later, to the airport. On the way there, I'd noticed that the gas gauge said it was empty. But this was crazy, because I only had 107 miles on the tank! It would later turn out that the genius who fixed my AC for the second time hit the button that resets the mile counter. Either way, as we approached Beautiful's home, my truck died. At an intersection. With a huge Mac truck behind me. Oh, the fun. The best part was that there was a gas station DIRECTLY ACROSS THE INTERSECTION, but trying to drive on fumes just wouldn't do it and I was effectively stopped right there. So, I got out, and asked Beautiful to steer the Can once the light turned green. I was going to push the Can up, onto the street, and across the intersection whether it was in the way of other people or not. This proved to...not work. The Can had to roll UP a rather large bump before it could get into the street...and it apparently didn't feel like it. So there I was, with my truck stuck at an intersection with about 5 cars lined up behind me, all of them having to wait through an entire green light to watch me weakly push a truck about half a foot, to have it roll right back into the starting position. It was probably entertaining, but they no doubt had somewhere to be.  Then, entered the Good Samaritan. The Good Samaritan in this case was a guy who resembled the classic stereotype of a smoker. Dark sunglasses, messy clothes and a sort of twitchy motion, all mixed in with a voice that told a story of its own. Either way, the Good Samaritan walked over, and hopped behind the Can. I thanked him before we even started pushing, and we were off! With his help, we were on our way...and then the light turned red again. It probably changed green again as we pushed the Can through the extremely bumpy intersection. We finally got across, and we were able to put some fuel in the Can, which was more than enough to get us to Beatiful's house. Her return was even more wonderful than I'd anticipated, and that night was made even better by dinner with Beautiful and her family that night!  Now, onto the next subject: Moral Question. The band, CrossFire, has officially changed its name. Wanting something a little cooler, and a little Latin, the band is now known as "Tri-Septum", meaning 3 Sevens in Latin. Why? Well, its a simple play off the Number of the Beast, 666. Either way, the band got together and we discussed many things, and among this discussion was the subject of songs. We attempted to write a couple of songs together, but it was quickly discovered that it wasn't going to work, so we went on to other things. The next night, the same night Beautiful returned, I was hit by a bus-load of inspiration and I wrote an entire song in 10 minutes. The thing that worries me is the song is...rather "edgy". And by that I mean dark. And harsh. The song also questions the United State Government and its morals, so I consider this to be a rather difficult Moral Question. The song discusses an event known as the Firebombing of Dresden. During WWII, the US firebombed this city, killing approximately 20 thousand civilians. This German city contained almost no soldiers, and the ones there were guarding OUR P.O.W.s. I have issues with this occurrence, and that's what the song is about. I just hope my church doesn't mind...Eh... Well, I'll just post the song and people can post their thoughts. Keep in mind that the song is written for a metal band, so the lyrics are supposed to be rather...dark.   Forgive Us  Give the command with no thought Giving the innocent all you've got Never ask the public, ignore you subjects Crush them like they're mere objects! Fan the flames to burn out life Might as well kill a man's kids as you slay his wife!!!  (Chorus) We don't want any more blood stains to our name We don't want any more pain 	X3  Take out your own as you wipe away the guiltless Never was there a move more spineless! Now you ride through the sky Its time to make the few survivors die! Is this the way you fight a fair war? How can you look at your kids anymore?!?!  (Chorus) 	 Everyone acts like this incident never occurred They choose to believe the state's written word Evil is never necessary, no matter the gain It all comes back to Abel and Cain But the Truth is the Truth no matter the spin And thousands of children are lifeless because of our sin!!!  (Chorus)  God, forgive us for Dresden! X10   And for the final subject: Karmic Luck. Considering the size of this post, I'm sure you're glad to see the final subject is up. I promise this will be quick. I'm really just basking in my own luck. I arrived home tonight about 10 minutes past curfew and I knew that I would receive a MAJOR thrashing from the parents...Imagine my delighted surprise when I discovered that they were still out! So, I slipped under their parental radar and was *not* late...nice.

						   Well, like I said, this blog is going to be a place for stuff that I like, for stuff that happening around/to me, and for rants about stuff that ticks me off. This is a "rant blog". Today, readers, I'm going to talk about something as simple as music: and how stupid people can be about it.  I understand that everyone had their own tastes, but why does that mean that people are allowed to trash other's tastes?! I'll admit, even I do it sometimes, but it seems like some people make entire rules for their lives out of musical tastes or something! For instance: the "punk movement". All of these teens (and I guess adults...) who ONLY listen to punk and anyone who doesn't is a "prep" or just a loser, and anyone who listens to punk but doesn't look/act/be punk at ALL times is a "poser". Doesn't that defeat the point of being "punk"? Last time I checked, being punk was about not listening to other people's rules, and about questioning authority...and yet they make rules about how to be punk. I think the stupidity speaks for itself.  Of course, its the same with most other music types, this one just kind of stuck out to me recently (I spent half the day listening to my MxPx CD) but the same applies to most of the stuff I listen to. For instance: Christian metal. This little listening choice has gotten me more grief than anything. For a couple of reasons:  1. Christians who are anti-"Christian music". These people seem to think that it can't be true God worshipping music unless there's a fricking organ and a choir of old folks belting it out. They say that the lyrics are sacriligious and the instruments aren't "proper" for worship, even though hundreds of years ago, the EXACT SAME THING was said of worship music with those organs and choirs that the old people prop up now. Again, I think the stupidity speaks for itself. And it probably will for most of this stuff.  2. Christians who are against Christian Metal only...these people infuritate me. I don't understand them at all. They go off and listen to their Relient K, or their Dogwood (Both bands that I am fricking addicted to, especially Dogwood), completely blowing off anyone else's likes just because there's some sort of lame stigma on metal in general and Christian metal specifically.  3. "Secular" metal listeners who don't believe that Christian metal can be as good or hardcore because its Christian. As if their faith somehow keeps them from playing the guitar or the drums as well as a secular musician...the stupidity, oh, you know the drill!  4. People who ignore the lyrics or influence of the Christian metal band and assume that they MUST be evil/Satan influenced because they're metal. These are the people that wear me out the most. I simply don't understand how they can concentrate so much on something as dumb as what OTHER bands in the same genre have to say! I don't go around screaming about how all country songs are about either drinking, objectifying women, or a combination of both....even though this would be a MUCH easier argument to make.  Finally, I just want to say that I'm NOT trying to say that metal is the best music, or that country music sucks or anything like that. My opinions are just that: mine. And your's (the reader) is just that: yours. So, please, lets try and keep them to ourselves or at least be civil about it when we're discussing them. It makes things easier for those of us who don't feel like having a debate over something so simple.

						   Don't let the title of this post fool you: I detest math almost as much as I hate "boy bands"...and I won't begin to talk about how much I hate THEM! THEY DON'T EVEN PLAY INSTRUMENTS!!! What kind of band doesn't play ONE LOUSY INSTRUMENT?!?! And I'm sorry, one of them banging on an old acoustic guitar in a music video doesn't count! But that's not what this post is about.  This post is about one thing: the danger's of taking an algebra class while under the influence. Not under the influence of drugs or alcohol, but under the influence of...BEAUTIFUL!!!  First, let me set up a little background. I've already explained Beautiful, so let me move on to why I'm taking an algebra course during the summer. Because I am fricking stupid, that's why. This isn't a remedial class, actually much the opposite. This is a college level algebra course that I took with the idea of "getting ahead" before I had to deal with it when I graduate from high school. Now that I've set up the basic background, lets discuss the class a little more in depth.  The Teacher: referred to as Sonic because he seems to frequent a certain burger drive-in, Sonic is a 24 year old mathematics professor. An OK guy, if you can get past the fact that he teaches the devil's language for a living. Sonic also has some great "guy stories", including one about the time he snapped his thumb back 90 degrees while skiing down a mountain and trying to avoid an old man. I personally would have turned the old geezer into road kill, but Sonic is the sentimental type...unless he's grading a test. Then he likes to smash people into the ground, stomp on them, then ask them to take notes on a formula of some kind.  My Neighbors: The people who sit around me in the class are all cases for their own blogs, but I'll try to sum them up in this one post.  Smasher: Smasher has some aggression issues, which he seems to get rid of by smashing plaster at his job (whatever that is). Smasher scares me a little, but he also has a funny side...that borders on verbal assault at times. He is also not unfamiliar with the bottom of bottles, seeing as his comment on refrigerators was, "All mine does is hold beer..." The scary thing was, I never doubted that statement for a moment.  Webster: Webster is a 40 year old web designer who is rather comical considering he's about 6 feet tall, almost that wide, and carries a little blue backpack that he can't wear strapped over both shoulders. Understand, I have nothing against overweight people, and that's not what I find funny about Webster. What I find funny about Webster is that he actually knows less about algebra than me, and basically announces it to the class every time Sonic leads a discussion. Its...interesting, having him there.  Veteran: Veteran is a 20 year old female who has apparently taken ALL of Sonic's classes...yet all he teaches is algebra. He teaches three remedial classes, Beginner, Intermediate, and Advanced Algebra and Veteran has apparently taken them ALL! Veteran and Sonic are basically PAST the first name basis now, having moved on to their own nicknames...  Well, that basically sums up the people who sit near me in the class. Now, on to the TRUE point of this post. A warning.  DO NOT TAKE AN ALGEBRA CLASS (ESPECIALLY IF YOU SUCK AT IT) WHILE UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF BEAUTIFUL!!!  "What exactly do you mean by 'under the influence of Beautiful'?", you ask? Well, I'll tell you. Imagine, you're sitting there, listening to Webster harass Sonic about some formula for the third time, and someone walks by the window. Its a 6 foot tall black guy who's obviously there on a basketball scholarship. But now, he doesn't look like a 6 foot tall black guy, but a 5'9" girl of Italian/Spanish heritage and a MUCH more appealing face and body. You are, of course, entranced...only to snap back into consciousness two hours later when your class has left and Sonic is teaching the next group of victims about some horrible formula or something. You scream, throw you book at him, and run out the room. Its completly understandable.  This is, of course, just a dramatization of the horribleness of that can come from being under the influence of Beautiful. But it should be taken seriously. You never know when this could happen to you! Sadly, there is no cure, so if you do become under the influence of Beautiful, you might as well just give up. Resistance is, as they say, futile. May God have mercy on your soul. Amen.

						   I thought I should clarify WHY I refer to my band, Cross Fire, in quotation marks. Well, its very simple. We're just four (used to be five) teenage dudes with nothing better to do than attempt to put our mediocre musical skills together to makes something that will *hopefully* sound like music. We practiced for a long time, and we finally came up with a tune. First, I'd like to clarify a few things. Warlock came up with a tune. With no words. Because we don't have a vocalist. That's another reason I refer to us as a "band". We don't have a vocalist. And its not that we INTEND to not have a vocalist, we just can't find anyone who can and is willing to sing for an amature metal band. An impossible idea, I know...why would someone NOT want that opportunity?!?!  So, here's the lineup:  Warlock: On lead guitar with his SWEET amp and pedal for great distortions, playing his B.C. Rich New Jersey Warlock.  Me: On back-up guitar on my sweet amp (maybe a better amp than Warlock, but no pedal) and my B.C. Rich Bronze Mockingbird   (For those who don't know: New Jersey means that the guitar is higher quality. Bronze means that some Korean kid made it in a sweatshop for 4 cents an hour. Thanks kid!)  Red Rage: Lead (only) bassist, on his PRE-AMP (A.K.A, baby amp) and his Squire whatever. I don't know basses quite as well as guitars, especially the cheaper stuff. RR, like me, is just starting and wasn't looking to blow a ton of cash. We used to have another bassist, thus named Old Bassist but he had to move. Good guy.  Drummer: Obviously, on the drums...if he OWNED SOME!!! This is where the band hits a snag: we use to practice in the church youth sanctuary, but we experienced some...technical difficulties. I'll tell that hilarious yet scary story in a moment. Either way, because of what happened, we cannot practice at the church anymore and therefore we can't use their drumset...the pain...  OK, now on to the most memorable story about the band that I have.  We're practicing the ONE song we had at the time (we now have one and a half) at the church and Warlock's headstock (the end you tune) kept hitting the mic stand when he would turn. I may not have mentioned it, but Warlock considers his guitar to be...well, more important than HIM. So, of course, he reaches up, grabs the mike stand (by the mike) and proceeds to try and move it. And he freezes.  What we didn't know at this time was that there is a short in that room...feeding through that mike. So, Warlock (because he's holding the STEEL STRINGS OF A GUITAR) is basically creating a circuit straight to the ground. The only person that knew what was happening was a person I will refer to as Philly Steak from now on. Philly Steak is our youth's worship dude and a very cool guy, but he kind of took the little joke of letting Warlock shock himself a little far...unintentionally.  Here's a transcript of what happened:  Warlock doesn't move for a few seconds, seems to be shaking. Philly Steak: Hey, dude! Let go of the mike! Warlock, through tightly clamped teeth: I...can't!!! Everyone: What? Philly Steak pulls a Matrix quality move, kicking the mike stand from Warlock's hands....to only knock the stand and not the microphone itself. Red Rage: Oh, crud! Old Bassist: Holy crap! Then, Philly Steak runs over and rips the cord out of the floor, stopping the flow of electricity. Warlock: OW!!!  So, anyway, that's why the story is both hilarious and scary at the same time. I was so stunned by everything going on that you'd have thought I was being electrocuted as well...except I wasn't! Warlock now has a scar from the metal of the microphone on his hand...but thats a good story for him to tell the girls, so he doesn't mind.

						   Those are the three topics for this post, just in case you're wondering.  First topic: New York City. Why am I, some kid from a tiny town in Texas, writing about New York City? Because the love of my life, my girlfriend if you will, is there right now visiting her father. And it sucks for me. Because I only get to talk to her on AIM and the phone. I don't want to put my girlfriend's name, so I will refer to her as Beautiful for this blog. I haven't asked her if I could talk about *us* so I'll keep her name secret. Anyway, Beautiful and I are what I would consider serious, although I can't really explain it. I guess its because we're both kind of outsiders in our own respects. She is AWESOMELY beautiful and this alone seperates her from other girls. It also doesn't help that she thinks for herself on such things as politics and sexuality. She has a brain. And that makes her different. Me, I've always been kind of "out there" because I'm the kind of kid that prefers books to people in a lot of cases and the friends that I do have are all different in their own respects. While I'm doing this, I think I'll talk about my different friends. I apoligyze now if I miss a couple, I'll explain why I'm not typing a whole lot later in this entry.  Like I did with Beautiful, I am going to substitute my friend's names with things that have to do with them.  Warlock: Part of my "band", Warlock plays: you guessed it, a B.C. Rich Warlock and he fricking rocks. I love listening to him play, especially stuff he made up himself. He and I are awesome friends, mostly because we're a lot alike. He loves music and guitar about as much as I love books and writing. It doesn't hurt that we both love (and are quite skilled at) Halo, an FPS for the X-Box. Anyway, we're good friends and I can tell Warlock just about anything. Its funny, because I'm into metal music about as much as he is, but we don't listen to ANY of the same stuff. He listens to Slip Knot and Hatebreed, the "secular" groups, and I listen to Demon Hunter and Living Sacrifice, Christian metal groups. Even though we can't talk about specific bands much, we seem to know EXACTLY what the other is talking about when we discuss music for our band or just in general.  Drummer: ALSO part of my "band", Drummer is the infamous "drummer without drums"...I can't totally explain this, but because of some crazy parents and some damage to his truck, Drummer can't buy a set of drums. This is a SERIOUS drain on the rest of the band, but we try to be patient with him. Drummer and I get along well, but not for any apparent reason. We don't really have anything in common, although I think we have a certain understanding when it comes to some stuff. In things such as moral dilemas and ethical situations, we typically agree on the same course of action, which is a good thing.  Red Rage: Red Rage is our "band's" bassist...and a red head. Infamous for NEVER letting ANYONE borrow ANYTHING, RR is still a good guy...even if he is a little stingy with his change. RR and I agree on just about EVERYTHING having to do with music and its really good that those anti-music sharing people haven't seen how many CDs we've burned for each other...there's about four years of jail for both of us right there.  David: I can't think of a good nick-name for David, so I'll just call him David. Its not his name, so no big. David and I play on M&M (Link in last entry) together and we've become VERY good friends through all of our comunication. We're both heavy into sci-fi style movies and stuff, so we can relate easily on books and such.  That's all I'm going to do for now. Expect to see these names again. LEARN THEM WELL! LEARN THEM I SAY! Or don't...its cool.  So, back to the stuff about Beautiful. We are missing each other horribly while she's in NYC, and seriously awaiting her return next Friday.  On to my second topic: short hair. Why do I need to talk about short hair? Because I HAVE BEEN BUTCHERED!!! I went to the usual barber shop I always go to except this time there was a guy there who I'd only let cut my hair once before. Before I go any deeper, let me explain something: this isn't a "regular" hair salon place. This is one of those places cowboys and "real men" go to get their hair cut. Either way, so I let this "newbie" cut my hair...and he butchered it! I wear my hair spiky on top with sideburns, and medium height hair on the sides and back. Now, I have almost NOTHING on the sides and back, no sideburns, and the top is short enough that if I wet it, I could spike it with a brush of my hand! THIS IS MESSED UP! I think I'll stop now...before I break something. My hair doesn't even really matter to me, but incompetence does and there was NO WAY that a good barber would have done this.  And finally...jammed fingers. Jammed fingers suck. Bad. I was feeding my dog (minature weenie dog) and as I was turning to go back inside, I brushed my knee on the door frame. This caused me to trip, and planting ALL OF MY UPPER-BODY WEIGHT ON MY FINGER!!! My finger has proceeded to swell to double its size...quite painful. Its amazing I have been able to write this post, seeing as how I can't extend the finger far enough to touch the number keys...Note the lack of numbers in this post.  Well, I think this is how I'll do most of my posts: just talk/comment on various stuff happening to me and around me. I think this place will fill up pretty fast once school starts back up...

						   Hey, this is my first post on a Blog ever...so I'm not TOTALLY sure what to put...so I guess I'll just tell a little about myself to start.  Name: Jordy Williams Age: 16 Sex: Male Stuff I do: I'm a writer, I do some fictional stuff and some poetry. I might post something here. I don't really practice enough, but I try. I also invest a LOT of my online time here: www.mysteryandmagic.com. I'll probably post some stuff about that  too, so if you plan on reading my blog, you might want to check that out. I also play guitar with my "band", Cross Fire. I'll probably post some stuff about that, but we can't really do much until our drummer BUYS A DRUM SET!!! But, that's another blog altogether. Other Details: I'm a soon to be Junior at my high school (its summer vacation right now) Purpose of this blog: I'll probably use this mostly just to get my own thoughts on paper (digital paper that is) Sometimes I'll talk about stuff that's going on, and sometimes I'll just rant about whatever I feel like ranting about...comments will ALWAYS be allowed and I'd love comments, so that I know SOMEONE is reading this stuff...

						   Well, the first thing I thought I would do is explain why I haven't posted in a bit and then explain why I wont be posting for about another week and a half after this. And the reason is quite simple. Summer. Oh, how I love thee...and yet...you stab me in the back. Summer is both a great and crappy mistress because during summer, I get to lounge about and chill, something that I don't get to do as much in the school year. However...vacations and such that take me out of town are quite the annoyance. I'll begin with the reason I haven't posted in a week.  My family recently embarked on an odd and wondrous journey known as a 'cruise'. For those not in 'the know', a cruise is a journey taken on, big surprise, a cruise ship. A cruise ship is, basically, a  BIG FREAKING BOAT . Although I knew it would be big, I was not prepared for the pure size of it. For a good idea, just imagine a hotel, with a casino, several real-life sized restaurants, and a half-dozen real-life sized clubs and lounges. All rolled together, add a pool, and you've got the cruise ship. We drove for a total of 10 hours  (Go ahead and read that again. Yes, 10 hours. Let that sink in for a moment.)  to get to the city of Galveston, where the boat left, and we departed. The cruise went to three places: Progresso, Cozumel, and Belize City. There was plenty to do on the boat, but I think the best thing were the stops. In Cozumel, we hit the beach, which was great, especially the snorkeling. Tons of cool little fish and such. And in Belize (Turns out that's NOT in Mexico. Who knew?) we took a city tour and also visited their zoo, which was a fun experience.  Well, that's what kept me away from blogging and such for the last week and a half. Now, I'll go ahead and explain what will be keeping me from blogging for the NEXT week and a half.  I'm volunteering to be a counselor with a church group for boys ages 8-13 and that will keep me busy for about 4 days. Then, less than 12 hours after I return, I leave to be a camper at my own church camp! Fun. Then, (The fun doesn't stop there!) I go FROM the camp, to my family reunion! Should be GREAT. Although, that means I'll be gone for home, Internet, and Beautiful for another week and a half. Cruel summer.  And now, movie reviews. I've got two movies that I've recently seen and feel the need to post my thoughts on. Dodgeball, and Spiderman II.  Dodgeball: AWESOME!!! I recommend this movie to ANYONE who liked Ben Stiller, because he is the funniest part of the whole movie and it should NOT be missed by a fan. Also, you'll never understand just how cool Chuck Norris is until you see that movie.  Spiderman II: I must say, Spidey II is BETTER than the first one, and I considered the first one to be a masterpiece. So you can imagine how I feel about this one. Doc Ock is played terrifically, the special effects are INSANE, and in most cases you cannot tell when its Toby *Peter Parker/Spiderman* and when its not. If you're on the fence as you watch the movie, I guarantee you will agree with me on both the greatness of this movie AND the awesomeness of the special effects when you see what I lovingly call "The Train Scene". PURE BEAUTY!!! I honestly consider this to be THE best comic book movie to ever be released.

						   Well...its coming. School begins in EXACTLY ONE WEEK! I'm scared. OK...maybe not scared...but...apprehensive, definitely. To be honest, I'm tired of summer, but I'm not sure I want to fix that by going to school...hmmm...bleh. That's my thought on it all:bleh.  Well, the schedule is looking alright, mostly because they've added a new class to our choices: Guitar. That is the coolest thing I've ever heard of and I 've already signed up for it. So, once a week, I get to go to a guitar class. Awesome.  Well...that's really all there is to say about school coming up. Nothing big happened today when I went to get my schedule, so there ya go! However, I've got some other stuff that's been rolling around the old 'noggin that I think I'll talk about. That's the 'Some More Ramblings' part of the title. Kudos for those of you that were observant enough to already figure that out.  First on my Ramblings List: Books. I've recently purchased (and read) The Catcher in the Rye by J.D. Salinger. Its awesome. It's written in 1945, and yet this book curses more than Pulp Fiction! Now, most of the cussing isn't very bad, but its still bad for coming out in the mid-40's. However, the book is really just very interesting because its one of the few books I've ever read that's told completely in the first-person past tense. It tells the story of a 16 year-old guy names Holden who, after dropping out of his 4th private school, has a nervous breakdown. It also includes some very interesting comments on human behavior and what we hold to be important in our lives. Very nice, but there's one bad thing about the book. Holden is the biggest downer in the world: he hates EVERYONE and its hard to not look at people as HE looks at them when you read it. Which...could be bad. Especially if you develop his tongue as well.  Next on the list: Outside Views. I've realized that often, looking at situations from an outside perspective, forgetting about your place in the situation, can help you look at things a lot easier. Its amazing what you can see in yourself when you look at how you react as someone else. And kind of depressing...but if you find it depressing, then you can see that some changes need to be made! That's something I'm trying to do now and I think its going to help me out a lot.  Up next, The Can: No Longer the Can. Yes, the Can is being repaired! It shall be returned to its original truck-beauty, and as such, it shall receive a new nickname...but I can't think of one yet. I'll have to see it in all of its mechanical glory first. Should be...by Thursday. Hopefully.  A New Addition to the Family! Sorry, I'm not talking about a new child or anything like that, I'm talking about Warlock's new ride! I was amazed at myself that I didn't mention it sooner, but Warlock recently came to own a Dodge Neon...with a 4-Disc CD player. That's just awesome. And, of course I have to give it a nickname. Although the Neon is a 'car' and therefore this doesn't totally fit, I will hence forth refer to Warlock's ride as the Warlock Wagon. I'm a sucker for alliteration. Cherish her, buddy!  Final Thought: After reading Beautiful's blog post regarding her views on homosexuality, I left my mind to thinking about what  I  thought on the subject...which wasn't a good idea because my mind tends to wander when I do that. But, luckily enough, I did come to my own conclusions. As a Christian I do believe that homosexuality is wrong, that its a perversion of the Truth laid down by God that sex is for a married man and woman. However, to excommunicate people who have a problem with that sin, would be the same as excommunicating people who have trouble lying, cheating, stealing, gossiping, looking down on others, killing, being disrespectful to those in authority, and a number of other things...so...you see...that's everyone. There is only one person that's ever NOT committed one of those acts: Jesus Christ and he's therefore the only one with a right to judge. Its funny (funny in that sad, ironic way) that we have problems with Christians who judge others for sins such as homosexuality when they're as guilty for just as bad (the Bible says that all sins are equal in the sight of God). Now, does this mean that I accept that homosexuality is a 'lifestyle' and that I'm not going to say something if someone asks me? Absolutely not. But if I believe that I am as guilty of sin as everyone else (which I am) then who am I to come down on them? So, there is only one solution. To love those people as I would anyone else. Again, does that mean that I'm 'OK' with their sin? No...but I'm just as 'not OK' with my other friends sin: because sin hurts us. I'm also just as 'not OK' with my own sin. Its at this time that its good to remember an old saying: "Love the sinner, hate the sin". The bad part about this saying is that people often put it in the opposite order. I should always love PEOPLE, because they are direct creations of God. Now, the things we do...that's a different story.  Well, I spent a lot more time on that than I probably should have...hope I didn't bore anyone with my incessant ramblings. Oh well; that's ok. Well, like I said, school starts next week and I'll do my best to post updates on that often.

						   Well, to make up for not posting for like 2 weeks, I'm going to go ahead and do another post! Although, I don't have anything to really talk about...so I'm doing CD reviews! This should be fun, since I love listening to tunes. I've got four CDs I'm going to review. Pillar: Where Do We Go From Here?, MxPx: Let it Happen, East/West: Hope in Anguish, and John Reuben: Professional Rapper. Yes...professional rapper. I know, that's not really something I'd probably listen to, since I usually can't stand to listen to anything without heavy guitar distortion, but its insanely cool! I'll talk about it in a bit.  Pillar: Where Do We Go From Here? Well, this is Pillar's new CD, following their big hit: Fireproof. For those that liked Fireproof, this is a pretty good CD, but it doesn't feature ANY of the awesome rap-core sound featured there. This is album is pure rock and roll, nothing more. The lyrics are pretty good, especially Simply, which is just cool. Especially the scream at the end ;). My only real problem is that ALL of the songs seem to have the exact same form. They open with a set of verses, break into the chorus, verse, repeat chorus, some sort of break, and chorus. That's about it it. I don't know, I guess I'm just kind of spoiled since I've been listening to my old Dogwood CDs, on which most of the songs don't even HAVE a chorus. Anyway, the CD is GREAT for Pillar and standard rock fans, so check it out if you fit one of those.  MxPx: Let it Happen: This is actually an older CD, but I love it anyway! MxPx is a sort of 'bubble gum punk band', meaning that they mostly play the happy punk music that people like to listen to. If you want their more political/hard stuff, check out Teenage Politics. For Let it Happen, the group covers just about EVERY facet of teenage boy/girl relationships, from attraction, to dating, to making excuses for missing dates, to breaking up, to getting over breaking up, to getting back together. Its great. It also features the MxPx classic, "Chick Magnet" which is just a hilarious song about a guy who's a 'chick magnet'. Funny lyrics and some sweet guitar sounds can keep the 'punk heads' entertained for hours.  East/West: Hope in Anguish: I can't seem to stay away from this CD. Its amazing. For anyone with East/West's first CD, The Light in Guinevere's Garden, you know that they are HARD, and this CD doesn't disappoint. They're not metal, but their brand of rock is definitely some of the hardest I've ever heard with a singer that you can 'actually understand'. If you like that sort of thing (I do) this is a CD to go and buy! Actually, I'd suggest you buy both of them, just to enjoy all of their screaming goodness. My only problem with the CD is the insanely stupid last track, which is literally nothing more than some jungle sounds for 13 minutes...yes, 13 minutes. Its an utter waste of space on an otherwise great CD.  John Reuben: Professional Rapper: OK, this is a first for me. This is my first rap album, but I must say I'm not disappointed in the least. Well, ok, just a little. Because its not long enough! John Reuben isn't the stereotypical rapper, though, and maybe that's why I like it so much. He's white, and he looks like he should be in MxPx or Relient K. Reuben's voice is instantly recognizable and easily understandable, both important to me in something like a rap album where you're basically going to be listening to the same guy for 40-50 minutes. The beats are insanely cool, and there are even a few tracks with guitars :D. I actually found myself learning the lyrics after only a few listens, even though the lyrics are much longer than anything I've ever listened to. The opening track, 'Move', is a great opener that will have you rocking if you're into the rap sound he has. However, Reuben shows more than just his rock on side in this CD, with tracks like 'Free to Feel' and 'Five Years to Write'. There is also a 'funny side' when at the end of a track, you can hear John talking and some woman starts yelling things like "Get up there and dance, rap-boy! Come on! Do that little arm thing!" and then a new song begins. Its just funny. Flat out funny. Of course, as many times as I've said that now, you probably think I'm full of crap. But that's OK, cause its my blog and I can say what I want. So there.  Well, there's my CD reviews. Hope I didn't bore you too much, as I rambled on about four of my most played CDs right now. I'm hoping to pick up the new Zao CD, but our Mardells (Christian CD store) doesn't carry them anymore!!! I believe I'll be leading a boycott soon, so watch your news for that ;).

						   Jeez I'm bad about posting on this thing! I'd like to thank you guys (if you exist) that check this thing occasionally to see if I've updated it. I'm sorry that I don't do it more often, but I've been here and there so much that in the past three weeks I've probably only been somewhere with access for a week or so. I'll try to update you guys on everything, and then maybe I can keep some sort of regular schedule for this thing. Like I keep saying, once school starts back up, I promise to post more often. I promise...really...no, seriously...no, SERIOUSLY! You've gotta believe me! Oh well...I don't care if you believe me or not!  Well, stuff has gone pretty nuts. I volunteered at "R.A. Camp", which is basically a church-run Boy Scouts...and I'm not exactly the nature type if you don't gather from my posting. But, anyway, it was a lot of fun. Got to teach a Bible lesson, which was pretty cool. On the last day, I had a really short lesson and at the end, instead of just leaving like they usually did, a group of about 6 kids just started asking me questions? The lesson had a lot to deal with Heaven, so I can understand how that got their minds to running. Their questions were actually very well thought out, and I had fun having this sort of little discussion time with them. I'm not exactly a "Biblical Scholar" but I know a lot of it, so I had most of the answers, although I kept stressing that most of the answers were just 'my opinion or my thoughts' and that they should talk to their pastor and parents about such stuff. Good kids, though...at least most of them. Some of them were left behind, but we didn't mind (I don't think their parents did either).  Well, after that, I had a one day rest at my house before I went to Youth Camp, and a lot of things happened there. I've made huge leaps in my faith and some major changes in the way I'm living my life, although most of those won't show up in this blog, since they're more private. But one thing I'm going to make an effort to do is to reach out to people more and to be more friendly, because that's the only way things can get better. If we're always looking to the inside, what good does that do? I've also started reading my Bible a lot more, and I find that I understand it a lot more and it makes a lot more sense. Anyone who want to read the Bible but has trouble understanding it should check out "The Message" translation. Its a complete Old/New Testament Bible written in modern day vernacular (every day talk). Very cool.  Well, either way, I guess I can't post ALL good news. I also have to report the bad. Beautiful and I have broken up. The whole thing just really wasn't working out, but we've talked and I'm happy to say that we're still going to be good friends. There's really no reason to NOT be friends, since nothing *big* happened. Also, I'm happy to say that I've passed on my 'blog-bug' to Beautiful. You can now see HER thoughts on life at this address.  urlLink http://www.angelfire.com/emo2/s_damico/knicknack/  I will continue to refer to her as Beautiful, because our breaking up doesn't change that.  Well, the family reunion was...interesting. Actually, it was just boring. I spent most of it reading in my Bible or listening to tunes on what I believe is one of the single greatest inventions of mankind, the portable CD player with headphones. I know this kind of contradicts the whole "reach out to people" thing I've got going, and that's something I'm going to have to work on. I'll post how that works out.  Well, no band stuff to report on, although Warlock is hard at work on coming up with parts for two songs he's written, mine, and a cover for dc Talk's 'Jesus Freak'. We, as a band, always agreed that we would NEVER do covers, but we decided that the song has just been too important in our musical lives. It was, literally, the first Christian rock song I ever heard and when I got the entire album, I must have listened to it...20 times? Easy. I would suggest to ANYONE, Christian or not, to check it out...although it'll mean a lot more if you're a Christian. I can still listen to the entire CD through and not get bored or skip a song. Especially Jesus Freak, since it talks about martyrs and living in the faith. The song is actually about John the Baptist, although most people don't know it.  Well, I've recently gotten some new CDs, so I think my next post will be CD reviews. That's always fun. I'll listen through them once, then listen to them again as I write the reviews. Also, I saw The Bourne Supremacy yesterday, and its awesome! Very sweet, but it helps if you saw the first one, The Bourne Identity.
