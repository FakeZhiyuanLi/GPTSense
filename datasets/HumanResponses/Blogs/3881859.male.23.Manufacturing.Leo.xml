      I talked to my friend today. His girlfriend is trying to become a flight attendent. Yup,&nbsp;he's realizing the dream of many men. While I know I should feel happy for the guy, I am also overcoming with this weird sensation of wanting to kick him down a cliff and take his place.......Geez, wonder what you call that?  Ok, let's do a little test. Think of the first thing that comes to mind: Dog...............CAT! Pizza..............FOOD! Taiwan...........SMALL "My girlfriend is a flight attendent"..........................she must be good looking, you must get cheap tickets, I hate you you lucky&nbsp;SOB, and she must be good looking.  The thing is, while this girl probably has many suiters, she is head over heel in love with&nbsp;my friend&nbsp;and i don't know if&nbsp;the strong feeling is completely reciprocated. Guess some guys just have it.

      The following is a conversation between me and an buyer for a electronic device manufacturer:  &nbsp;  We sat beside each other on a plane. It started with the usual "how's it going?"  &nbsp;   Stranger:  So what do you do for a living?  &nbsp;   Me:  I'm an account executive for a company which manufactures connectors. We manufacture second rate products and market it as the best. Out of the two major&nbsp;deals I've done, the products went horribly wrong. We later refused any responsiblities and since we had good lawyers and received the&nbsp;payments from customers&nbsp;in advance, we&nbsp;succeeded in screwing those guys.  &nbsp;   Stranger: &nbsp;Damn.....what company do you work for?  &nbsp;   Me:  ...........a major one....and&nbsp;chances are you have been or will be a victim.  OK, so it didn't really happen that way, but I AM pissed about selling crappy connectors. &nbsp;

      I read somewhere this quote: "The only normal people you know are those you don't know very well." This quote struck a cord with me because I never considered myself normal. I always felt a little "outhere". This quote helped me put my metality into perspective. I was not alone in the world. It was very likely that we "abnormal" individuals are the majority of the human race. Which very interestingly raises a question: If what the quote said was true and we are in fact all considered abnormal in someway; and if we take the definition of normal to be that exemplified or agreed upon or shown to be true by the majority; then by deduction, shouldn't abnormal be normal? So it is perfectly normal to be abnormal!   Yesterday, as I laid awake in the deep of the night, I began to ponder yet again my of normalcy. I felt I lost something. Somehow, somewhere, someway, from grade 10 to present, I sidetracked from the normal growth pattern. Mentally speaking. While everyone was getting girlfriends, I continued to wage the war between grade 1 boys and girls when liking someone meant ignoring that person, laughing at that person, or worse, pulling their pigtails. What should have been dropped long ago I had continued. I was a man perpetually entrapped in the first grade. When I liked someone, I act as if I didn't give a rat's ass. Then there were the comments about their hairstyle being awfully awkward or just plain awful. It is always after they walk away with a look which blends anger and disgust, that I reminisce about my stupidity and begin banging my head on the wall.

      This is it. This is how I'm gonna become famous. Some publisher is gonna read what I have to say and be shocked at what I have to say and he or she is gonna publish what I have to say, and what I have to say will be published for millions to read, despite it to be meaningless mumble jumble crap with no structure or meaningful content. Or maybe I'll just settle for using this as a new channel to vent my frustrations and share my thoughts.  For anytone who might stumble onto this blog. A little about myself. I am God's most beautiful creature to date. I live in a mansion, have cash to burn, sleep with different supermodels, drive a Ferrari with the license plate "2RICH4U", and hang out with the best of the best. And if you believed anything I just told you, then I have a bridge to sell you.  Fact is I just wanna write without thinking too much. I don't care if my spelling is purfct or not. I just wanna share my thoughts.   I'm a young adult who just entered the work force in Taiwan. I read somewhere that we (Taiwanese) are the hardest working people in the world. Guess I'm one of the ones who deviate from the mean. While my salary "sucks shit" (for a lack of better expresion), my boss is still overpaying me :). When I see half a cup of water, more often than not, it's gonna be half empty. I wanna be optimistic but only find it difficult. I love the opposite sex and i like to drink scotch. Like so many, I am very materialistic. Crime, poverty, these things don't concern me. What concerns me are supermodels, televisons with 500 channels, some guy's name on my underwear. Cars, clothes, new gadgets, tables in the shape of an Ying Yang.   Ok I'm tired now. Until next time.
