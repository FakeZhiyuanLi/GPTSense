      Right, so, Mike and I are on this bogus field trip, OK? We're wandering around the Copley Plaza Mall and decide to check out the local EB Games. He says, "Hey, I wonder if they have Magic cards." and I'm like, "Nah, I don't see anything and even so I don't think they'd sell 'em here. It's all electronic stuff." So he ignores me like he's prone to and goes up to the guy there and says, "Hey, do you have any Magic cards?" The guy goes, "Lemme check." and so he unlocks this cabinet and shuffles around for like, 5 seconds, and then pulls out 4 Onslaught boosters and an Onslaught deck. I'm all thinking, "Whoa, they actually have them!" and Mike's like "How much are they?" The guy's like "$1.99 per booster and 5 something for the deck." We're both floored. I'm all digging in my pockets for cash and Mike's kinda laughing. We both grab 2 boosters each (I woulda bought the deck but I had no more money) and check them out. I got this rare land which I'm using in my next deck and I forget what Mike got but it was like  2 bucks for 15 cards? Whoa!  I'm deffinately looking up the nearest EB.

      AHH! It is so very hot in here. And out there. All over the place. I really need to get my AC unit in quickly- I'm sweating up a storm here. Also- I made a map for Starcraft but it turned out like a big version of the "Island Hop" scenario. I'm going into Boston tomorro to see an exhibit on something about the Japanese and WWII. Funfun. Afterwards we're gonna hang about Copley Plaza and the Pru. Stuff and things. fun. tata for now.

      Heyhey, so soon, so soon- yes, but it's another topic. ;) I am a Magic: The Gathering fan. I play at an intermediate/advanced level leaning towards intermediate.(my scale, not the Wizards') I currently have a White anti-artifact/control/assault deck, a Blue creature-denial deck, and a White/Black anti-creature/I've-got-creatures-and-you-don't deck. On Saturdays my friends and I are trying to get people to hang at his house and do Magic like a weekly thing. Yay for Magic. Chill, I'm out for now.

       urlLink Adventure Quest RPG  is a flash-based game with quite an imagination. I am currently lvl. 36, i think. Lots of fun, but it's hard to up one's stats. All in all, I reccomend to anyone who's comp can handle it. ;)

      Okay. I got really bored in math today so I wrote a little program on my graphing calculator. I call it PLUS1. So, I get it to pick a random number from 0 to 100. If the number is greater than 99 it displays OOH. No reason, just a random interjection. Then, each time it repeats, it cumulatively adds 1 to the result so it becomes less and less likely to be less than 100. Once it becomes impossible to be less than 100, it stops. I'd write the code here, but I don't want to.   Also, if you're strapped for memory, you can archive the problem simulator and it won't change it's useability. Lots of fun.

      Heyhey. Memorial Day weekend has just left the building. Speaking of which, Yesterday i got to hang out with a good buddy of mine, and during our excursion we stopped by the not-so-recently moved Your Move Games in Davis Square. Lots of capitalized letters. Anyway, they have wicked cheap Magic cards there- $1 for a rare or uncommon that you pick out or $1 for randomized homemade booster packs that are guaranteed to have either a rare or "prize card" in them. The prize cards (i got one of them) are for a free extra booster or store credit. I got a free extra pack. It's a pretty sweet deal. Check 'em out. Peace.

      School is 1:51. Time is to go. Not yet. What is the reading over shoulder, is it good? Yes I know. I did it. Before they did, i did. Knee oscillations and reorientations constantly. Sole Jeans. Soul Sol. Not time yet. Over and under, out. Run in between the planets because my back's too dry to fly. New ones in the side but not so new. Rinse, and repeat. Glare, blink, stare, pop. Circlet of mention better left unknown. In the dark doghouse of the night we shiver. No whispering for milk, all we have is elbow grease. Blue angels plummeting through the pudding to fing bananas. Good-bye. ~!@#$%^&*()_+=-0987654321`

      OK, so my friend has this program called Middle Man which supposedly does all this cool stuff to AIM. So I try it out, hey? So first it says there's a BIIIIIG problem and I'd better reinstall. So I do that and it's all happy. Then when I try to do the cool stuff, it says I need a valid root logging directory or summat. I'm all like, what the drugs is this junk on? It doesn't let me hit Apply or OK. Long story short, I find the uninstall and quick. My friends, I don't like Middle Man.

Love y'all out there, call me, write me, email me, communicate to me any way you can. I need it. ttfn, love- Elventide

      Right, so I'm over at Bill's today- I slept over- and I just discovered that Nat took some of my Magic cards when he left by accident. At least, it'd better be by accident. >:( Also, I slept from 4AM to 11AM. I should have gotten up when I heard him leaving, but when I'm half asleep (or 80% at the case may be...) I don't have that presence of mind. XP Anyhoo, it doesn't seem that anyone is up yet to get over here and play magic. Bummer. In the words of Eric Dramstad: Less sooner.  EDIT: 8/1/04 5:04 PM I found the cards. :/

      So at dinner we were talking about the hair code at OCC and my dad said that the penalty for smoking marijuana was the same as for having shaggy hair. In response my brother said "So the cops bust into someone's house and say "We're arresting you you and you for smoking dope and you for your hair."" It was funny.  Anyways, have you ever noticed that only the broken paper towel despenser always works? There's like, four in a row and one has a broken handle so only the metal part sticks out. That's the only one that never jams and always has towels in it. Ironic, no?  Also- there's this car there that has a third of the front bumper torn off at my work and it looks like Arnold Schwarzenegger from T2 when part of his face is missing. It's so weird that the resemblance between a Sable and Ahnold is so striking.  Lack of cash update: Camp: Complete! Comp: It's not gonna cost what I thought it would, but still- patience, patience... Car Insurance: I have no idea other than more than I want to pay. Magic Cards: I have the cash, I need the time to find cheap ones. And I need to borrow the credit card...  ------------------------------------- (8:56) I got so sidetracked. Did you know that Darksteel Colossus has "If Darksteel Colossus would be put into a graveyard from anywhere, reveal Darksteel Colossus and shuffle it into its owner's library instead"??? Man, that rocks.

      Of all the flibbing globbitty funk! >:0 I just remembered that I have like three books to read before school starts for my English classes!! Flibbit!! I have to find that frigging list Coward gave us! (speaking of which, he's  never  on AIM.. :( *sad*...)&nbsp;   Woohoo! I made it into Babbs' journal! actually I made it in a while ago, but&nbsp;I just now found out.  So tonite, my mom made some crazy chicken stuff with curry and rice and it's all like, awesomely good. Oh! We watched Timeline. It's not as good as the book, but as a standalone&nbsp;movie it's decent. My cousin loves it but she wasn't here tonite. I think she's in New Hamster with UB... mebe she's in Oklahoma, I don't know. Anyway, we'll see her AND Katie there after Teen Camp in August. Katie's staying until  Labor Day!!  That's crazy long, like, five weeks!  Anyhoo, I'm feeling mutch better than the last time I posted... mutch? much? Munch! *munchmunchmunch* heehee! I need to sleep, but I'm actually having fun.  I took these weird personality tests online today. They aren't very good. I got the links from this girl I know (well, not really  know  know as much as met online at a forum and now I know what she looks like (pretty) because of this "let's see what everybody looks like" thread) anyhow I got the links and the tests were stupid and wrong and I'm off track of what I was thinking about... my train of thought derailed and all passengers were killed.&nbsp; ::sad::  My dad says this is playing so I need to stop soon, but this post is plenty long. *looks at top of post* shoot! I still need to find those books! well, the list at least.&nbsp; BTW, I saw Paycheck yesterday and it was awesome. I rather think Ben Affleck is a good actor. Speaking of Affleck, (no duck jokes please...) Damon! I want to see The Bourne Supremacy soooooooo bad! ... as i said, this post is long enough. I might rant again tomorro. tata!

      Why do I even bother? I don't know anyone who reads this. My hackerphobic&nbsp;mom just bought Norton Internet Security and it's slowing down the comp like&nbsp; a.. like a... grrr! stupid non-functioning brain! I can't think of a non-profane&nbsp;word to put there! Anyway, I don't like it. We already had Antivirus 2003 which was fine, but  noooooo - we needed something  newer . It freaking won't let me use MSN messenger or Trillian! It blocks internet radio and who know what else but I can't figure out this stupid&nbsp;useless&nbsp;proxy junk!  I'm not in a good mood right now, can you tell??  My job is slaughtering my social life and wiping it's&nbsp;nose on it's corpse! I hate it but I need the money, which suddenly has so many drains on it! Grrr! I want to save for a paintball gun, a computer, camp, Magic cards, and for parts for my car! It's gonna be at least $230 for the gun and the accessories, at least $500 for the computer even if the guy I know gets the best deals, about $150 per part i need for my car, $63 for the Magic cards&nbsp;I want, $350 for camp and I only get about $300-$400 a week! I know I shouldn't be complaining with that kind of paycheck, but&nbsp;my job&nbsp;sucks- I have at least 6 different bosses that don't know how to communicate with each other and I work more than full-time! I'm at work from 7:30 in the morning until anywhere from 4:30 to 6:00 at night on weekdays and from 7:30 to 1:00 every other Saturday. My friends call me less than&nbsp;usual because they know I'm almost never available and they hardly ever call me anyways! I wish there was some non-brain-damaging/non-stupid/non-drug-related&nbsp;way to turn my brain&nbsp;off and forget about all this crap I have weighing me down. I need a really really good friend who understands me. No offense, but none of you guys out there right now are doing much for me. Except maybe J-Fresh. Man, I never get to hang with you! I need something, and I need it bad. But first I need to know what it  is .

      So I went to the eye doctor's today and I was all like, "Yeah, I'll be at work by 12." heh, it was not to be. They dialated my pupils and I was like, "Yeah, they'll go back to normal in time." Nope. I had to drive home squinting like I had acid in my eyelids. It was so bad I had to make a stopover at Paneras to sit in the dimmness and sip mixed Mountain Dew and Dr Pepper. It was nice, but when I was done I had to get the rest of the way home. Not fun. I had to call in to work to tell them I wouldn't be there (can't drive safely y'know). SO. Here I am, writing this, listening to OoT music. I wish there were more people on AIM.
