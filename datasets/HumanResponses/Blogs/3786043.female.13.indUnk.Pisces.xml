      Aloha Amigos, sorry 4 d wierd title, but it was all I could think of! Today I tried to get Devin to spend the night, but she couldn't, so I spent the night with Libbie. I have to b home @ 10 am, but I'm kinda glad cuse I want to see my mom be4 she goes into surgery on her shoulder. I'm seriosly thinking about hurting Heath so bad, cuse he is so annoying hitting me in the boobs all the time & talking about women, them having babies, and boobs. I mean, he's only like, what, 8? 9? ARGGG! He shouldn't be flirting with 13 yr olds! He shouldn't be flirting with me, he shouldn't be flirting with ne one! JEEZ! The only things keeping me in that class are: 1) Devin 2) Dustin 3) Libbie 4) My mom! ARGG! I wish I could drop that class like in school! No, wait. I like Tae Kwon Do. I wish Heath would drop it! (takes deep breath) Ok. I'm fine. Here's part of 1 of my fave songs, Big Fish:  Doogididum Digadumdumdadum doogididogadadio doogididumdumdadum doogididumdadidadumdao Are you in the Big Fish, sittin in the belly of a world gone mad  have you turned your back on his wish, his will for your life, have you made him sad? Do you wanna get out of the Big Fish, listen to God and follow his commands, And you won't be part of the Main Dish, he'll spit you out on the dry land! Doogididum ... Your sinkin low, how low can ya go, so low that you don't know which way to go, To the truth or to the dare, To the dare and you'll be swallowed there, But to the truth and you will find that a rescuer is right in time To pick you up back on  your feet, Obediance is neat! Doogididum ... Oh well, that's it for now, G2G eat some blue ice cream! Bek

Ya know, I really don't think I'm going 2 tell Libbie about my blog, cuse I'm going 2 put something on here that I don't want her 2 know cuse she'll tease me about it. So I'll put it on here cuse I gotta tell someone or I shall burst! OK, I'm in tae kwon do, right? And I just realized, (oh wait, Devin, don't tell ne 1 about this, and don't tease me, or I will spar your head off!(Since I am 2 belts higher than you!)) Neways, I just realized last night that...DUNDUNDA... I have a HUGE crush in Dustin! Dude, Devin if u tell NEONE about this, ESPECIALLY LIBBIE, I will Stepping- Side- Kick your butt to Uranus! (note the planet:)) But seriosly, you will hurt so bad if I find out you told LIBBIE OR DUSTIN or ne one else about my secret or the address of my blog! G2G, Bek

       Kyung Yet to me, Minors! Pay Chariot! Sa Bum Nim! Sa Bum Nim Ke Kyung Yet! That's me, Minors! Kook Ki! Kook Ki E Kyung Yet! Don't make me Kiyop at you! Kam Sa Ham Nee Da! Soo Ryun Kut! Yo, pees! I'll translate what I just said. (It's Korean): Bow (to me, Minors! Pay) Attention! Master Instructor! Bow to the Master Instructor! (That's me, Minors!) Flag! Bow to the Flag! (Don't make me) Yell (at you!) Thank You! Class Dismissed! I'M SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO BORED! I've done just about everything you can do in a town called Yellow! At least I don't live in Pink, OK. It must be the most boring place ever! (of course, you could stand in the middle of the street and yell about how stupid the name is.)But my mom won't let me do that! I've colored, read, watched tv, eaten, played with the dogs, listened to a fly, and tried to communacate with my stuffed animals! All I got was                    . They lead an interesting life! I've screamed with my bird, typed one handed, and even Blogged! I've been yell at by Libbie, Ignored by Rickay, Sam, and Devin, answered the door, bugged my parents, tried to communicate with my Granny, (answered by a babble of stupid stuff), and memorized the song from the George Forman Alaska commercial that comes on every commercial break. I've picked the sticker of the phone, read all the signs on our house, played computer games, re-memorized A Leader is Best, gotten scratched by my house, and, finally, held a staring contest with a frog! (which I lost, frogs don't blink) Ne ways, I'm gonna re-create my avater! Byeas, Bek

      Hey sorry for the wierd title but that cheer is stuck in my head. OWWWWWWWW Devin, Libbie, IT HUUUUURTS! Sorry other peeps if ur there, but we started sparring in tae kwon do today & I was sparring against Dustin (ok, so my crush on him isn't huge, but it's there) and he caught me in the elbow (I broke it last spring skiing, long story later)and then Mr. Trotter (our instructer) told me to axe kick him since he's shorter then I am (he's half way up my nose) so I did & lost my balance and fell on my elbow that Dustin hade just kicked like 30 sec.s earlier (yes, the just healed one) and I have this HUGE bruise and I scraped it pretty bad. Oh well, I got Dustin back for kicking me in the elbow, I caught him where it hurts a few times accedintly. BTW, my mom is fine, my dad just didn't bother to call me when she got out. OBTW, Libs, my mom wonders how someone sooo iritating can be so lovable. :) Devin, have fun @ home! See ya ummm later! O, and for all you people who care... BECKY IS HERE!!!!! I love my aunt Becky! She's sooooooooooooooooooooooo osm!!!!! G2G!!!! Bek (Becca, Becky, see the connection? yea.)
