      I woke up early this morning feeling restless, anxious, trapped.  I went to Fair Trade Coffee House and tried to shake it.  When Tony came by I was feeling a bit better, but incidently I ended up crying when I was telling him what was up.  A sure sign that the stress of it all was overflowing, literally.  He invited me to go with him and Smith to Devil's Lake.  It was just what I needed.    I know that the girls would never intentionally make me feel left out.  I wouldn't call such people my friends.  But that's why I felt like I needed to get away, to stop myself from feeling like there was anyone else to blame besides me.    Devil's Lake is definately one of the most beatiful places in Wisconsin.  The awe of God's creation smacked me in the face.  It woke me up from self defeating behaviors and screamed, "Open your eyes!"  Devil's Lake challenges me and pushes me to see the limits of my capabilities and the fragility of my existence.  One poorly placed foothold could cost me my life.   Yet when I come face to face with a 15' granite wall and the only way down is much worse, I find a way to overcome that challenge, whether it be by my own strength or by the hand of my best friend.

      Dad, Mom, Ty and I went to see a Brewers game today.  As Padres fans, you could say that we went to a Padres game :-) Go Padres! I saw Miller Park for the first time.  What a piece of work!  I felt like I was in a movie just being there.  It was rainy, so the dome was closed.  However, it didn't seem to change much of the atmosphere.  Maybe I'll get a chance to go back before going to Japan.  I had hoped to find some sort of cheap souvenir to take to Japan seeing that the Japanese like baseball so much but I had no luck.  I will keep searching for Brewers memorabilia.  Ty helped me keep score during the game; Padres win, 5-2!    It's bound to happen every once in awhile.  This weekend I feel a little out of the loop with my friends.  Last night I received 2 calls from Chloe and one from Camila at 1 am.  I saw Chloe's first two calls in the middle of a deep slumber and chose to ignore them, seeing that I was already asleep.  But with the third call, I was beginning to worry so I picked up.  They wanted to inform me that they were playing pool.  It felt like I was sort of an afterthought.  I had asked to be called if something was going on, but what are the chances of wanting to go out at 1 am if I'm not already out?  I kinda thought that someone would let me know a bit sooner than that.  Then tonight after getting home from the game, Camila had told me that they were thinking about going to the Dells.  I was surprised that they wanted to go so far to go out but Camila had said that due to the holiday, a lot of people were expected to be vacationing in the area.  Being in dire need of some rest, my heavy eyes welcomed the nap.  Yet, I was only awakened by Andrea and Camila entering the room as they were preparing to leave.  It's just one of those things.  I felt a little left out.  Maybe partly it was my fault for not being more pro-active about going out or for my alarm not going off... but one likes feel a little more included.  Tony is out with Smith and the guys tonight because Smith just got in from Hawaii.  So I blog, and then blog some more...

      Happy Birthday to my roomie, Andrea!  It's funny how I remember writing my journal entry last year on her birthday.  My, how things have changed in a year!  Last year I never would have even imagined all the new and exciting things that are happening in my life today:  I have a wonderful boyfriend, Tony, I'm about to make a career change, a location change, and some other serious life changes.  Tonight the girls went out to eat to celebrate Andrea's birthday at a place in Middleton called Vin Santos.  Excellent Italian food.  We were even so lucky as to have Chloe come up from Chicago to join us!  I really miss having her around.  A funny thing happened today at the bank.  I met a man, Thomas Lucas, who was opening an account to start up a sister-city organization with a city in Japan.  I didn't recognized the name of the city.  I didn't even know that it was in Japan until he said, "I'm going to be the only signer on the account right now because our treasurer is going to Japan in July."  I found out that the girl was going to be a CIR (Coordinator for International Relations) with JET.  That struck up some very interesting conversation.  He even invited me to a meeting next month to meet some Japanese folks here in Madison.  Should be fun.  Maybe Tony will want to come along?    Sometimes life spooks me out when things happen like meeting Mr. Lucas.  I mean, I met him a day after finding out about my placement in Japan.  How bizarre.  But then I remember that it's all a part of God's plan for me and I really feel like God works in marvelously mysterious ways!

      I received my placement, FINALLY!  Miyagi-ken it is.  Yes, just like Mr. Miyagi from Karate Kid!  I can't quite seem to understand why they are still so vague at this point in the game.  First, all you know is that you are going to Japan.  Then, they narrow it down to a prefecture.  Someday, I'll know what city.  Miyagi-ken is pretty far up the northeast coast.  From what I can gather online, they must have 4 seasons and at least some snow fall.  Darn it, I swore I wouldn't be around for another Wisconsin winter.  That may be true, but I'm afraid that Japan's winter is going to be just as bad for me... especially without central air or heat.  Hello down coat, heating pads, and electric blankets!  Hopefully, I will hear from my contracting organization fairly soon and I'll have a lot of questions answered.    I told everyone at work that I was leaving today as well.  What a relief!  I had heard some people talking about me leaving and I know it sounds morbid, but I felt like they were planning my funeral before I was gone.  I felt so much better that it was out in the open.  Funny thing is, no one had said a thing to me.  That is, besides Nancy or Stephen of course, because I had already told them I was going to Japan.  But it just sort of says something about the people that I work with.  I also heard that Natalie, a girl I don't care for at all, will be leaving in August, so that takes her out of the running for my job.  Thank goodness.  My customers deserve so much better!   Well, I need to be gearing up for a more positive energy and some drastic life changes.  I'm so excited and so ready for a new challenge that will surely push me to my limits and allow me to see what this girl is made of.  Stay tuned!  Ja (see you later in Japanese)!

      My pace quickened, my heart beat fast, as I raced home to learn my fate of where I was being placed in Japan.  As I approached the house, there was no sign that the mail had come yet.  I flashed a glance towards the neighbor's house but their mailbox revealed no further information.  At our house, none of the 4 mailboxes had the typical magazines or large envelopes protruding from their lips.  I assumed the worst.  The mail had not come yet.  I'd have to wait until the end of the work day to find out.  But as I opened our mailbox, I soon discovered that the "worst" had just gotten worse.  We got our mail but my placement did not arrive yet.  Oh, the agony!  People are posting messages about their placements and I have to wait another day!  I feel like I'm stalking the mail man and every time I see the UPS truck I get anxious!  No placement, no computer, no books, Ah!  Until tomorrow!

      After weeks of hearing that we would receive our placements, "soon" I think it's finally true.  Oh, the agony of hearing we would know by "mid-may" and then hearing "by the first week in June" and then hearing from the JETs in other interview locations who have received their placements!!!  But finally, we have heard official news from Douglas Bell in Chicago that our placements are being mailed by snail mail either today or tomorrow.  That means by Wednesday or Thursday I will know more about what the next year of my life will be like.   Will I be up to my neck in snow again or will I be lounging on the beaches in my free time?  Will I live in the land of monkeys who bathe in the hot springs like on the Discovery Channel??  I've never been so anxious to check the mailbox repeatedly, day in and day out!  I'm awaiting not only my placement, but my new Dell Laptop Latitude D505, and my books "Learning to Bow," "Let's Learn Hiragana," and "Let's Learn Katakana."  Hey Mr. Postman look and see, if there's a letter in your bag for me?!  Deliver the letter, the sooner the better."

      Today I spoke with Amy, another fellow JET and Madisonian.  We have agreed to get together and at the very least, practice our primitive Japanese.  Who knows, maybe we could become friends and I will have another place to visit in Japan?  From what I hear, there are JETs from other interviewing locations who have already received their placements.  Where is mine?  Those of us from the Chicago group are still hanging in there, waiting as patiently as humanly possible.

      I seemed to be a fountain of emotions today.  Just spilling over and crying at the drop of a dime.  Strangely enough, however, there was hardly a dime to be found in the fountain at Library Mall.  Which makes me wonder, why?  Here are my hypotheses: A.  The fountain was just cleaned out by city workers and the money was donated to charity. B.  The homeless folks went wading last night in order to get today's cup of coffee and a Subway sandwhich. C.  Sadly enough, people are making fewer wishes. D.  People have less change in their pockets or need to put it in the change jar. E.  The ducks that were there mistook it for food and ate up all the change. F.  One college student got smart and in order to recover from the tuition hike, she makes nightly trips to the fountain.  I made arrangements last night to have my going away party for work at Muramoto Japanese Restaurant.  So the evening of July 12, we'll all dine there together.  It's bound to be a hard night.  But tomorrow will be an even harder day unless I get my butt to bed.  So after watching the anti-capitalist, Michael Moore movie, "Roger & Me", I ponder: "How do the rich keep getting richer and the poor keep getting poorer?"  I too contemplate nightly trips to the fountain.

      Instead of going to Chicago to the Q&A session for Japan, Tony and I decided to attend Ron and Angie’s wedding in its entirety.    As the time drew near, my anxiety about going to Japan decreased, thanks to my predecessor Kirsty, and I was beginning to feel that the time with my family would be more valuable.  Besides that, the 3 hour drive to Chicago and then the 5 hour drive to Sheboygan afterwards would have been extremely taxing.  The drive to Sheboygan was a little stressful.  Last minute, Tony discovered that he had nothing to wear.  Until I went shopping with him last weekend, I didn’t understand how difficult it was to find clothing and shoes that fit him.  Poor thing.  That’s one thing we both look forward to in Japan.  We should be able to find everything that we need in our size!  We spent some pretty stressful moments at Johnson Creek Outlet stores before just buying a belt and leaving it at that.    We made it to the church with about 10 minutes to spare.  The whole family from mom’s side was there.  It was kind of hard because we had to sit down right away and I didn’t have time to introduce Tony to everyone.   It was a fairly small and simple wedding; very nice actually.  Everyone had a really good time and surprising enough, Crazy Aunt Mary was rather controlled.  The highlight of the evening had to be watching grandma do the chicken dance and the YMCA.  What a great time!

      Well, for the past couple of days, I have been in touch with my predecessor Kirsty.  She seems pretty cool yet more importantly, extremely resourceful.  She has provided me with so much information.  Everything from where Tony might find work, to how to get internet connection at home, and how much I'll pay for rent.  She's even going to take some pictures of the apartment and send them to me.  I'm so pumped!  I guess the best part of it seems to be the teaching situation.  How romantic to teach at an all girls school and visit an all boys school.  I hang on every word that she says.  Even the smallest piece of information is so valuable to me.  I pray that Tony is able to find a job in Kesennuma.  I don't want to know what it would be like to have to live without him in Japan.  If he has to go to Sendai it will be tough. 2 1/2 hours away is a lot for someone who doesn't have their own form of transportation.  We went to Tony's parent's place in Hartford today to pick up his car.  We went out to lunch with Tammy and Bob.  I really enjoy being around them and being at their home.  In fact, I was kind of hoping to spend a little more time there this afternoon.  They had visitors over to their house but I was enjoying myself.  Plus I just like being around his parents.   Tonight I met up with Amy who is going to Japan with JET too.  We spoke for a bit online and I found out she was in Madison so she asked if I wanted to go out and grab a beer.  We hung out at the Vintage for awhile and it was nice to meet her.  I'm afraid that we are rather different.  Amazingly, you can tell a lot about a person by the kind of bar that they hang out at.  She had originally suggested the Lava Lounge.  I've never been there before and when we walked by it, I sort of got the feeling that I knew why.  Unfortunately, since I had to work this morning, I was really exhausted and only made it out for one drink. Coincidentally, Amy is from Wausau.  Of all the places on earth!  :-)  It was nice talking to Amy and while I feel we personally have very little in common, it's nice to have at least one familiar face in the crowd of orientations and travels which lie ahead.

      I'm so happy right now.  I can't even tell you!  I just received an email from my predecessor and I know exactly where I'm going!  Kesennuma in Miyagi-ken!  Here's what she had to say:  Konichiwa Brianna-san,   I am your predecessor here in Japan.    If you haven't yet heard, you will be coming to Kesennuma city in Miyagi prefecture.    You are really lucky with your placement.  Kesennuma is a city of about 70,000 people.  It's right by the sea, and surrounded by mountains.  It's a port town so has very fresh fish and many good restaurants.    You are also really lucky with your schools.  Your base school will be Kanaegaura Senior High School.  This is an all girls, academic senior high school.  The students are all very friendly, you'll have a great time here.    Your visit school will be Kesennuma Senior High School.  This is the all boys, academic school.  I don't work here, my boyfriend does, so he'll be able to give you all the info you need about it.  It's also a great school, with a very young and fun English department.    Also, one morning every month you will be visitig Kesennuma Yogo Gakko - This is a special needs school for mentally and physically disabled students.  Each time you visit you will spend 1 hour with the Junior High school students and 1 hour with the Senior High school students.  This sounds quite daunting, especially if you've never worked with special needs kids before, but I have loved my visits to this school and wish I could have gone there more.  The kids there are so great.  They'll love you.    Next April 2005, Kanaegaura SHS and Kesennuma SHS will be joining together to make 1 big mixed SHS.  This is a big event here and I think you're really lucky to be able to be a part of it.    On your application form it says on one section you're coming with your boyfriend.  Is that still the case?  If so do you want to live together?  It's no problem either way.    OK.  I think I've bombarded you with enough information for 1 e-mail.  If you have any questions, about school, Kesennuma, living in Japan, what to pack, seriously anything, feel free to e-mail.  If you want to talk in person that's also no problem.  My phone number (and yours as of August) is (81) (0) 226 24 8826.    Have a good day.  Looking forward to hearing from you.    From Kirsty   I'm in awe!  I have been so blessed with this placement!  It sounds like more than I could have asked for.  Thank you, thank you, thank you!

          It's coming down to the wire!  I can't believe three weeks have gone by since my last "blog."  So much has happened.  I went to Madison last weekend.  Friday night, the girls had a fondue party and we all sat around just talking and enjoying one cheese and one chocolate fondue with all the fixings.  Saturday, Camila, Suji and I strolled along Maxwell Street Days on State Street.  Later that evening, Stu and Alan threw Tony and I a going away party at their new place.  The apartment is nice, but what makes it "choice" is the enormous patio that extends off the living room.  The building/apartment is so new that it isn't really finished, including a few major details like a railing on part of the patio.  It's only a 4 story plunge to your death on the concrete steps of the apartment!  We grilled out and just hung out on the deck.  Their neighbor has the cutest puppy!!!  It happens to be named Cooper and looks just like him too.  It was unbelievable.  I felt like it was our Cooper's spirit saying good bye.  Apparently, there were a few mishaps that evening.  One involved the neighbor with the cute dog getting water dumped on her.  The other involved the beautifully new apartment getting trashed sometime after we left.  I  would have been livid, but apparently, Stu wasn't that upset.       Andrea, Suji, Camila, Hassan and I finished off Saturday evening by going to "Flashbacks" at the Marriott hotel on the west side.  Although I really enjoyed being there with the girls, I would have felt better if Tony were there.  I don't mean to sound snobby, but I felt really trashy just by being there.  There were a lot of dirty old men sitting around the dance floor just smoking and drinking.  I didn't like the way they were looking at us.  I also cannot forget to mention "Mullet Man", who hit on Camila over a half a dozen times.  You'd think that he'd get the hint after 5 or six blow offs.  Duh!?!  The human bowling pins on the dance floor were rather entertaining.  Especially because I knew one of them because she works at the Oregon AnchorBank.  They were so wasted, they kept falling over one another on the dance floor.  The other girl also kept grabbing Hassan on the dance floor.  There was the bride who after her reception made her way to Flashbacks and was dancing on the bar while her new husband slapped her ass.  And finally, there was an extremely overweight woman in tight white capri pants, white socks and tennis shoes who was doing synchronized pelvic thrusts with a skinny old guy.  It was about all I could take.  Strangely enough, I wouldn't have spent the evening any other way.  It was great just being with the girls.  And just look at all the great memories we have of that night!  We topped off the evening by spliting up the magnets that I made over the year.            I moved out of 304 N. Carroll St. #2 on Sunday.  I got an early start.  Camila helped me with a few last things and she made Tony and I pancakes and fresh fruit!  It was a day of painful good-byes.  I had to say good bye to the girls who will most likely be my last roommates.  How do you say good bye to people who you feel are such a big part of you?  I guess when the tears dry and the hugs have been given, you are left with the joy and warmth of having them in your heart, always.  With friends like these, you don't ever really leave them because they live forever in your heart.       Tony's parents came down to pick up the last of his things.  They took us out to Q-doba and we said our good byes.  It was really hard.  I have enjoyed getting to know Tammy, Bob and their families.  It is such a blessing to have such wonderful people in my life.       Then I had to leave Tony in a somewhat displaced situation, not living at 207 W. Gorham and without a key to Stu's apartment.  It was hard knowing that this next week would be filled with so many changes of which he wouldn't be a part.  I hope I never have to maintain a relationship via telephone for an extended amount of time.  The next time I'll see him will most likely be in Tokyo, a half a world away.  However, knowing that he is on the other end of this exciting adventure to Japan makes it even more exciting.  I can't wait to see him again.  This year has so much in store for us and I'm so glad that Tony is the one I get to share it with.  I wouldn't want it any other way.     I made it home Sunday night just in time for the family get together in our backyard.  I love being in our backyard.  Dad has done such a nice job with the landscaping, flowers, and fire pit.  Grandma, Rudy, Russ and Mary, Rose, Drew, Jess and Nate all joined us for dinner on the picnic table and a campfire.  Simple times with loved ones.  "These are a few of the things, I love the most in my life."       I've been packing, re-packing and picking up little things here and there all week.  Packing is definately a science.  2 bags and a carry on seem so little to be taking for a year but I have to keep in mind that anything I don't have and need can be shipped or purchased.
