        For a majority of the year I had a picture on my agenda. What I didn't get was why people had such a big deal with it. It's just a picture of one of the greatest men in the world. A man I idolize, a man that I want to be just like when I go out into the world. . . . . Howard Stern.  I love The Howard Stern Show, it truly does brighten my mornings. I listen to the show every morning. I look up to this man. I listen and watch his shows, I have read his books, and seen his movie. He does what I want to do. Like him I want to have a radio show that not only holds my interest of politics, but also ties in my. . . well my more perverted side as those of you that used to sit with me at Pierce girls basketball and volleyball games have seen. I want to do that, have a show with sex and a twist of politics. Talk about a few political topics in the first hour or so, and then have some fun.  A lot of people say Howard degrades women, my mother is one of those people. She doesn't care if I listen to him, but she won't. "Alex! He degrades women!" that's what I get whenever I bring him up, so I just don't talk about him with my mother anymore. My dad doesn't mind talking to me about him though. It was my dad that first introduced me to the show. Lets see. . . it was about. . . um about. . . well it was after 9/11. . . we will say around Summer 2002 I started listening to Howard, yes two years sounds about right. Anyway back to the women's issue I was talking about. Howard doesn't degrade women. It's the women themselves that are degrading women. Howard has never forced a girl to take her top off, they voluntarily do it. You've got all these women complaining about how he degrades women, when it is the women themselves that are degrading their gender!

       A new month approaching, and something new for me to work with, another blog. I figured I have a blog for Student Government, and I'm always tempted to mix in personal feelings with that (Something I don't like to do), so I decided to create another blog. A blog where I can share my own opinions while keeping my Student Government blog clean and not slanted in its views. I give you, My Thoughts.      I figured I'd start with Big Brother. I'd like to keep my thoughts away from the fact that I have to get up early everyday and go row. Big Brother is, if you don't know, a television show on CBS that I enjoy watching. They (The Producers) get a number of people, this season fourteen, and put them in a house together for roughly three months with complete surveillance. The houseguests are not allowed any contact with the outside world, except with host Julie Chen (Who I might add is the girlfriend of that jerk Les Moonveis the Head of CBS and unfortunately now Viacom).   Each week one person becomes the Head of Household, or HoH, and must put up two houseguests for eviction. A houseguest may take him or herself off the block with the Power of Veto (POV) then the HoH must put up another houseguest in his or her place. On Thursdays, one person must go, bringing the remaining houseguests one step closer to the five hundred thousand dollar prize. On Tuesdays the houseguests must go into a competition to get their food for the week. If they win, they receive the everyday foods you and I eat, with maybe a few extravagant foods thrown in. But if they loose, it's peanut butter and jelly for the entire week.     The show, over its now five seasons, has thrown in twists. Last year it was the "X" Factor. This year it is project DNA. The first in this twist was that two of the houseguests (Jennifer (aka Nakomis) and Michael) and actually half brother and sister but were never aware of this before, nor did they even know each other. The second, and most recently revealed to the audience part of the twist, is that Adria has a twin (Natalie) and the two of them have been switching places within the house since the show started. If the two of them can make it through this week (Week Four) then both of them will be allowed to enter the Big Brother house at the same time and play the game, not as one, but separately competing for the five hundred thousand dollar prize.       Three people are gone, as tonight we begin Week Four of the show. Big Brother airs Tuesday and Saturday at nine p.m. and Thursday nights at 8 p.m. on CBS (Channel 62 on sidelight and with an Antaean, and Channel 15 on Comcast).

      Any of you that went to Henley with me knew what my biggest concern about the trip was. . . would I be home in time to see the Tigers play the Red Sox. Although my worries decreased after the Sox traded away Garciapara, but still I like the Sox. We got into our cars Monday morning, me mostly assuming I wouldn't be home until like Sunday. Well we all know what happened, I was sent home on Wednesday. Question is after that point, was my seat given away? I was very happy to find that someone had not been found to fill my spot!  So we get to the ballpark, get into our seats. Pretty good seats along the first base side. They go through the lineups, starting pitcher for the Sox, one of my favorites Lowe versus another one of my favorites Maroth. I just kept thinking to myself how much of a great game this was going to be . . . My home team against my favorite team, I love them both. I got myself situated. I love ballpark hotdogs so of course I had one of those, lots of onions, lots of mustard. And of course in my other hand, thinking healthy, I have my bottled water. First three go pretty good, solid defense on both sides, a scoreless game. Then, the rain starts to pour, a rain delay is out. They cover up the field. I felt confident that they would resume the game though, it wasn't that big of a rain cloud. So with that me and my mother go to the shops.  For my entire time playing my violin my case has been bare. This year I started putting stickers on the case, hoping to make it look a bit more interesting. I don't have much on there yet though, just a John Kerry sticker and a few stickers from our Orlando trip. So while we were in the team store I decided to get a sticker to put on my case, I think it looks alright, its a baseball with the Tigers logo is the middle. I think I have some more stickers in my basement, I will have to find those.  Back to the game. After about fifteen thirty minutes the rain is gone and the delay is lifted. I grab a pretzel with a shitload of mustard on my way back to my seat, and I am once again ready to enjoy the game, spirits still high. Once back in and situated, the period of scoreless has ended as the Red Sox drive in a run. Three outs and it is thrown to the bottom of the fourth where the Tigers don't wait long to come back driving in three runs. A scoreless fifth goes by, then in the sixth Maroth gives up two more making it a tie game again. But the Tigers are determined to bring home a win and score one in the bottom of the inning and take the lead again, now three to four. The game continues that way and the Tigers get the win.  After the game, the first win I have seen all year I might add, we stick around to see the post game fireworks. We've seen the fireworks at all three games we've been to, actually I went to a day game in June, so there was one game I didn't see the fireworks at. The show is pretty good, I would put it probably just a little behind the Parcells fireworks. I haven't been disappointed by them yet. All in all I had a good time, I saw my two favorite teams, in a close game, got my sticker, had a hot dog and a pretzel (Extra Mustard!), and saw the fireworks show. I hope to go see them again soon.

      As you all know I am big on Politics, I like to keep up on what's happening. And one of the biggest ways to keep up with political campaigns is to look at poll numbers. Poll numbers as you know are a projection based on a small diverse number of voters to see how a larger group would vote giving us a pretty good idea of the outcome of events.  I would like to from now on, on Thursdays, update you with the latest poll numbers on the Presidential Election.  New polls have come out today for Georgia, Illinois, Michigan, New Jersey, and Wisconsin. The August 2nd poll from Georgia shows a Strong hold for the Bush Campaign. An eleven percent lead and a Republican voting history show that this state will most likely go red again in 2004. Up to Illinois, a state that has solidly voted Democrat and consistently shown Democrat in the polls is. . . still leaning democrat. A 54%-39% poll shows Kerry in the lead in the Land of Lincoln. Michigan, our home state and a major player in presidential elections has stayed mostly even through the campaign, but in recent weeks has started to lean Kerry. The August 2nd poll shows Kerry in the lead 47%-42%. Out to Jersey, where although Ralph Nader has 6% of the polls Kerry still maintains a strong hold on the state 49%-36%. And the last poll of the day, Wisconsin. Another battleground state. The most recent poll shows a weak Kerry hold, of 47%-46%.  The overall vote count in the polls as of now in electoral votes in Kerry 307 Bush 231 as we kick start August. Expect republican numbers to go up as Kerry ads will slow down this month and Bush ads will go up as we approach the Republican Convention in New York.   *Polls Provided By Various Polling Companies And Compiled At   http://www.electoral-vote.com/index.html

      Just rolled back into town, an unexpected early return for a majority of the members of the Detroit Boat Club Crew. No party, not even close. No medals, even further out. A trip that was supposed to last seven days, cut down to three. Here is how it went down.  Monday morning, a beautiful day. We set out to the boat club to load up and ship out, on our way to the Royal Canadian Henley Regatta. A new food trailer, we leave the club (and the cadets that swarm around us) with style. On the first leg of our trip I fall asleep. Once we reach the border though I am wide awake and have my papers ready. Once crossing in to the barron land that we know as Canada, my teammates and I stop for a bathroom break, and for those that needed to, a chance to exchange their currency. Back into the car, four hours to St. Catherines. The whole way up I have to listen to the most boring conversations about History. I don't care about war and all the different weapons, and "Hey, who do you think is gonna make a come back, China or Russia" I don't care! Another break, this strech of highway has become uncomfortably farmiliar from all the trips up to St. Kits. I hate this rest stop, we always go there, it's the only thing on the highway up there in Canada for miles. The place has a Wendy's (Spelt in Canada W-e-n-d-y-*-* maple leaf for an apostrophe *-*-s). I mean what the fuck, everywhere in Canada they throw in the maple leaf on their signs. Do we put the American Flag all over our crap? Back in the car.  Finally we reach our destination, We unpack our stuff, and put up our camp site. My tentmates (As Alexi would call them) were Jon Mon, Snella (Pronounced Sch-nell-a by Dr. Bell), and John Silva (Yuck!). We were the first to successfully put together our tent. Now this area we are on is mostly dirt so we decide to make a patio out of rocks that were once a road going through the area so if it rains we have somewhere to sit. What does everyone else do with it . . . They put the coolers on it, fuckers. We go out and practice (Which sucks because we never practice this boat so it is a piece of shit) then we come back and go out to eat. I don't remember the name of the restaurant, just that they had a mean chicken caesar, and garlic bread to die for. I was a real pig that night. I had Snella's side salad (Because he didn't like the dressing), six pieces of garlic bread, and one huge chicken caesar salad, I was stuffed. We came back to camp, and hit the hay (After assembling Dr. Bell's tent first!).  The next morning we awoke to quite a storm, and because we hadn't properly put on the rain fly our tent was a bit wet by the doors. My sleeping bag, along with Snella's, was completely soaked. We hung them up on some other team's trailer to dry (They didn't seem to care much when they came back to see that). I listened to Howard most of the morning, he had on Pamela Anderson (Pamaler Anderson as stuttering John would say). We learned that Pamela has had sex with women, has never had a threesome, has at one point wanted Howard Stern, and has had sex with Kid Rock at some point in the past three months. All day, fucking Tim Cragg was eating like crazy. TIM WE ONLY HAVE A LIMITED SUPPLY OF FOOD YOU FUCKER. God I hate that kid. I felt like bathing. I think I read in a magazine once that taking a mud bath removes dead skin and replenishes nutrients in your skin . . . so that is exactly what I did, I put some mud on. I was completely covered and Dr. Bell was speechless. I took a dive in the lake and proceeded to bathe. Alexi showed up. Nobody wants to talk to you Alexi why are you here! He seemed really interested in seeing Pete's new Rolex! Jon Mon started to cover our walls with pictures from  Maxim,  I decided to help and found one hot piece of ass. Kelly Carlson, the girl is absolutely beautiful. She is in  Nip Tuck , but there she has short hair, she needs to keep the hair long it looks better that way. After that we went out to practice again, we still rowed like crap. We came back and I watched some  Big Brother , I was able to get it on my little tv from Buffalo channel 4. After that we made dinner, some had salad, some had sandwiches, I chose to have spaghetti. FUCKING CRAGG TOOK AN OVERFLOWING PLATE FULL OF SPAGHETTI. WHAT THE FUCK, YOU HAVE BEEN EATING ALL DAY YOU NEED MORE FUCKING FOOD THAN ANYONE ELSE! FUCKER! Following that we all went to bed.  Wednesday, both my races were today. The first thing I did that day was look at yesterday's paper, and what do you know I was in it. Me and little Heide off to the side in a shot of the camp sites in a picture in the St. Catherines-Niagara Standard. Anyway, on to the races. First came the four . . . what can I say, the boat fucking sucks, DFL. Then the eight, something we should have practiced at least once this summer. It was a very tight race coming down the line. The junior eight semi-final, would we move on to the next round the final round. A great start. Down the line neck and neck with St. Kits #2 the whole way their cox at our bow, their cox at our cox. Here comes the finish. St. Kits #2 goes on to the final by a nose. Good Race guys. I truly mean that. Both teams went their hardest and I love those close races. Unfortunately we lost. Now we probably wouldn't had left so early if the Cullens hadn't been there, but they ended up taking all of the people who didn't qualify back home. I packed my stuff up. Went to get a shirt and pin with Jon Mon. Got a bite to eat. Turned in my twenty three entries for some drawing. And packed into the Honda.  Like before I slept the first leg. We stopped for gas and I woke up. I listened to my Howard Stern and several other CD's and we eventually stopped in London for dinner. It was a pretty nice ribs place and I has some good conversation with Snella, little Heide, and Johnny(Of all people!). We were in there for almost two hours but they had some alright stuff on the tube. Back into the car we went as we headed for the Border. So much for strong Homeland Security. The guy I don't think even looked at us, he was reading a magazine and I think in five seconds we got through.  We finally arrived home, and here I am now. Typing about the trip. Although it ended earlier than most of us would have liked, I still enjoyed it. Thank you for the Cullens for cutting your New York vacation to take us home, and good luck to all the rowers from the club still at camp, see you when you get home.

      This morning I leave for The Royal Canadian Henley Regatta (See the   urlLink Henley Web Page ). Henley is a rather long event lasting six days. I depart this morning, the regatta begins tomorrow and depending on how well I do will return Friday, Saturday, or Sunday evening. For the time being I will be postponing my posting. If anything interesting happens at the Henley Regatta I will be sure to send an audio post. Other than that, I will give a recap of my travels when I return.

      This is going to be something I plan on doing weekly, putting together four political topics in a post (hence the name four corners) giving this blog a little bit of a political roundness. So lets get started.     Topic Number One: It's All Over In Boston     Thursday night John Kerry the Democratic Candidate for President accepted the nomination for President officially putting him on the November ballot against incumbent George W. Bush. The convention started last Monday with a blast of the past. Farmiliar faces of the last administration took the helm as Al Gore was one of the first major speakers, he was followed by both Hillary and Bill Clinton. On Tuesday, one of the Democrats rising stars the Chicagoan Barrack Obama took the stage and had overwhelming support from the crowd. Obama is currently not being taken on by a Republican in a big Senate Seat Race in Illinois. Following Obama was Teresa Heinz Kerry whom spoke well of her husband and told us why he should be the next president (As everyone did). On Wednesday our own Jennifer Granholm took the podium, unfortunately she wasn't able to grasp the audience as I think many Dems thought she would. Later that night The Vice-presidential candidate John Edwards got one stage and really got things moving. Telling the crowd "Hope is on the way". Later that night Kerry was officially named the Dems Candidate For president. Thursday, the final night of the convention we saw nobody who could have possibly overshadowed John Kerry as he gave his acceptance speech and things started to wind down. Out of Tradition President Bush halted campaigning for the Dem's convention, he has now resumed that. The Republicans will hold their convention August 30th.       Topic Number Two: Senate Cuts Break Short     The Senate is back in session. Just as they started their summer break the 9/11 Commission released their report. Many were criticizing the actions of the Senate and said if our security depends on these changes pointed out by the commission you should be working on them and not be taking a break. With that the Senate is back discussing the Commission's recommendations. You can buy the 9/11 Commission Report from most book stores for about ten dollars.     Topic Number Three: Embassy Bombings     News came in this morning from Uzbekistan that the United States and Israel's embassies were bombed. A Muslim Militant Group is claiming responsibility for the attack. Two men were killed and nine wounded when nearly simotaniously three homicide bombers set themselves off.     Topic Number Four: The Budget Deficit     I remember being happy under the Clinton days. Services were providing adequately and we had a budget surplus. What I want to know is, what happened. Over Bush's four years in office things have progressively gotten worse with our economy. Last year the budget deficit hit $375 billion dollars and this year things are going to be worse. . . $445 billion dollars. What I want to know is if we are spending all this money, why am I not feeling a positive impact, shouldn't good things be happening if we are spending lots of money? That's a good reason right there to vote him our, a record $445 billion dollar deficit. Bush's press secretary is saying that we are on track to be cutting deficits in half. What!!! Things are so fucking bad right now, they will be lucky if the deficit doesn't get worse. He also said we are showing spending restratint in some areas which is good. NOT WHEN THOSE AREAS ARE EDUCATION AND THE ENVIRONMENT AND VETERANS FUNDS! LETS CUT BACK A LITTLE ON THE DEFENSE BUDGET AND MAYBE WE WILL BE OK. THIS ADMINISTRATION IS RIGODAMDICULOS. THEY NEED TO BE BOOTED OUT OF WASHINGTON. LETS CHANGE AMERICA FOR THE BETTER AND GET THESE LOSERS OUT OF TOWN. LETS ELECT JOHN KERRY, SOMEONE WHO KNOWS WHAT THEY ARE DOING.     This has been four corners.

      Ryan Seacrest. Now this cat annoys me. And the other day he received his just desserts. This no talent ass clown was able to get a gig three years ago as the co-host of the popular show  American Idol.  His co-host gets canned and suddenly it becomes his show. Now let me just say, I have watched the show several times because for some reason the people I live with enjoy watching the show. He contributes nothing positive to the show, the few times I've watched he seemed to be a bit of a suck up. But non the less he comes back stronger. He then has TV commercials for the  American Idol  sponsors.  Seacrest then jumps into radio land. And just hold up a second, before we get into the radio stuff. What the hell kind of a name is Seacrest. It has to be made up. If you can give me the national origin of the last name Seacrest I'll give you a dollar. Back to radio. So right when the FCC (Federal Communications Commission) starts "cracking down" on indecent broadcasters (Which really they are going after Howard Stern) Seacrest gets a radio show, the F and the S word, words not allowed to be stated on the radio, get out. The claim ignorance and for some reason they don't get fined, even though Howard Stern is getting fined for word that are made up. What do you think is worse, blumpkin or fuck and shit?  For some reason a show with great prestige for some reason goes to Ryan Seacrest.  America's Top 40  the countdown show, once put on by a Legend Casey Kasem, is now in the hands of a young moron named Ryan Seacrest. Then, for some reason in the fall, Ryan Seacrest is able to get his own television show, which brings us back to the top. He is getting his just desserts and right after making a stupid comment. Seacrest told the reporters that he is "the new King of All Media", we all know that title belongs to Howard Stern. And I was happy to hear the other day that his TV show  On Air  was canceled. His world is beginning to come crashing down, one day at a time.

      As we approach the end of the year, it is clear that things are starting to settle down. Classes are finished with their work, next years Student Association will meet in the upcoming weeks. This means one thing ... Less posting. With the exception of Homecoming Preparation, no Student Government events take place in the summer. Thank you for reading this year, and there will be periodic updates over the vacation months.  ~Alex Morgan

      I think that this year off of Student Government will do me well. I don't though, plan to detach myself completely. I will still go to meetings to make sure that you still get the truth. In the meantime, be sure to take this little poll below that I will periodically be posting throughout the next year to see if you think I should take another stab at the presidency.    .ivanC10855994824914{position:absolute;visibility:hidden;}   Free Web poll for your Web site - freepolls.com

      The loss suffered today can be blamed 100% on myself. I don't feel as though I really wanted this office. Therefore I didn't work hard to get it. I would though, like to congratulate yesterday's winners.  2004-2005 SA Senators:  Andrew Dickson (i) Kathleen Gorski (i) Georgeanne Inempolidis (i) Josie Pike  Annie Sorge Kate Swenson (i)  2004-2005 Class Senators:  Laura Andercovich Greg Carmody Taylor Hauck Liz Lightbody Owen Maher Kerri Marowske  *(i) denotes incumbent returning for a second term  Overall, I think that the 6 SA senators you have elected will to a fantastic job, they all have a year of some kind of student government experience. As for class, it might be a rocky start, many fresh faces are entering the game, and have little to work with.

      Sorry it took a while for me to post this, but if you have not heard already, Monday afternoon I placed my letter of resignation on the desk of Freshman Class Advisor Brian MacDonald's desk. In that letter (Which I will be posting in the coming days) I said that this did not come because I cannot or do not want to participate in class government, but because I feel as though my presence is not necessary. I did this to make a statement. That statement is simple: What we are working under is not a democracy, but a tyranny. I feel as though the opinions of the council don't matter. What is done, is only done out of the power of the office of the President. The president has not delegated powers all year. The president has done everything herself. Delegating powers is something that is out of my control. The current administration can be easily compared to with communist Russia. By keeping all the powers to herself, the president is slowly leading our class to a collapse.

      First of all I want to thank all the people that went out there and voted for me yesterday (I'm no longer campaigning so I am allowed to speak of this). And Second, I know, I too am disappointed about this, we will not know the outcome of this election for now. When I called to get the official count from insiders yesterday, It was disappointing to hear that the scantron, the machine that counts the ballots, was broken. Therefore, unless the SA is willing to hand-count ballots, we must wait until a replacement arrives, or we get the machine fixed.

      We need to keep a strong grip on our student government. You already let Officer Elections slip past you, don't let Senate Elections pass you by too. You need to have a say in your student government, you need to have control. VOTE TOMORROW! VOTE FOR SOMEONE WHO WANTS TO HELP YOU, NOT SOMEONE WHO JUST CARES ABOUT COLLEGE APPS! VOTE FOR, YOU KNOW WHO, I CAN'T MENTION THE NAME BECAUSE I'M BEING CENSORED BY THE PERSON MENTIONED IN THE WELCOME NOTE! IF YOU READ THE WELCOME NOTE OR LOOK AT THE LIST OF CANDIDATES POSTED YESTERDAY YOU WILL FIGURE IT OUT IF YOU HAVEN'T ALREADY!

      Yesterday, when I opened my copy of  "The Tower"  I saw a small editorial about the new sports and activities fees that will become effective next school year. I was even more shocked than I already was when I saw that they want all club sports (rowing, sailing, and field hockey) to be included in this fee range. Now, as far as I know, the crew (rowing) team only receives $2000 (two-thousand dollars) from the South budget. Please also note that the crew team does not use the school district's facilities, the only thing that the school's money goes towards is coaching costs, It hasn't effected our club dues one bit. From my latest count, South has 52 rowers. Lets see, what is 52 times the fifty dollars per person the school wants to implement, what's that, $2600 (two-thousand-six-hundred dollars) That would mean that the crew team is paying the school, the school which is supposed to support us, not the other way around. If the crew team is forced to pay under any circumstances other then the school bumping up its support, I will start a movement towards just rowing as DBC all year, because fifty dollars a person is far too expensive to just use the name Grosse Pointe South. Be sure to express your anger towards Superintendent, Suzanne Klein; Asst. Superintendent of Business Affairs, Christian Fenton; Principal, Al Diver; and Asst. Principal of Athletics; Matt Outlaw. Their E-Mail addresses are like all other staff members in the district, firstname.lastname@gpschools.org

      Today the books you helped collect were given to those who need them most. I'm sorry to say I wasn't there, but it wasn't necessary for me to be there. I did actually, in contrary to popular opinion, have something else to do. I had a paper for Ajavon due today that I had not started till this morning. Maybe it wasn't necessary for me to wait till the last minute to call and tell her (And I do mean last minute!) but you know what, she does that to the rest of the council all the time. She never tells us anything in advance, we all found out about this yesterday, and even at that she wouldn't share any details, just to be at her house at 7 AM. So I said, screw this, you aren't gonna give me any info, I'm not going. This all leads back to the consolidation of power thing (See Post "A Major Consolidation of Power") But I really do hope those kids enjoy the books.

      Changing moods here...I'm a little upset that I just found out before seventh hour that I have to be at Gayle's house at 7 AM to drop off these books to the less fortunate children. Now I'm not blaming anyone at this point, but whomever is responsible for telling us less than 24 hrs. before the event that we have to been there that early in the morning, is going to get a mouthful from me.

      There is one thing we did this year that I am slightly proud of... The Gift of Reading. This community service project is bringing a little bit of joy into the lives of less fortunate children. Tomorrow morning we present the books you donated to those children. Although I am not happy that we offered discounts for the dance in exchange for books, I'm proud of our class all the same. I would like to take a moment to that my fellow officers for a job well done on this project, and the senators who helped us make the hallway banner. Especially Josie who opened up her home for us to make the banner. I would also like to that the english teachers who handed out extra credit in exchange for the books, and to you, the students, who donated the books. I hope you feel good about your self, as you are making someone else feel good.

      Lets see here...what is the executive forum...another way for our class to throw money that we don't have out the window. It is also training for our incoming officers. Lets see, who are our incoming officers; Gayle, already and officer; Emma, not previously and officer; and Kara, already an officer. What is the point of the executive forum again, oh yes, to TRAIN NEW OFFICERS, Gayle and Kara are not new! What do they need training for. I don't think we need to waste money to train Gayle and Kara, even though they still need it. They know what they have to do already, why must we blow any profit we have on sending OLD officers to a NEW officers conference.

      Well I am back from my weekend in Cincinnati, I hope your weekend went a little better then mine did. But enough about that. I noticed this morning that I did indeed, have a comment posted on the blog in response to my earlier post about the consolidation of power we have witnessed over the past few months. Although the person chose not to leave a name, they sure tried to make me look like a fool, but I quickly responded back. If you care to read, go to last weeks archived posts. There are also a few other posts I've yet to respond to, I'll hit those in a few minutes. Other than that, I'm posting later tonight about the "Executive Forum" that our new officers went to today, and also I will have a list of candidates for the upcoming elections for you, hopefully by tomorrow.

      I'd just like to take a moment to shed a little light on my opinion of two staff members that I feel don't do a very good job. Michelle Yankee, public enemy #1 on my list. This woman I feel just doesn't want to do her job. A little while after the whole Homecoming Changes thing came out, our class, which was to only class to go and fight her on the issues I might add, scheduled a meeting with her. Most of the changes I feel had reasonable explanations, except one, the whole thing about not being allowed to make your own shirt. I understand you may have a problem with a few students, but that's no reason to oppress our first amendment right. The fact that her only response to the issue was "...that would be too hard for me to monitor." is ridiculous. It's your job to monitor! Do it! Same response was applied to the web blog issue, she told my father that it was well written, but that he would have to understand that something like that would be, "...too hard for me to monitor." What is there to monitor, It's an outside site, you have nothing to do with what I can or cannot write. She isn't alone on my list though. Meet public enemy #2, Rob McIntyre. He's a great guy and all, and I'm sure he's a hell of a science teacher, but the man just isn't cut out for being a class advisor. He is always late to meetings, or doesn't even show up sometimes. There is no way to get in touch with the man besides e-mail, he doesn't have his own room, he's movin around all day. During the whole web blog thing, he had the nerve to make several rude comments, and I feel he was just the administration's lackey through the whole thing. But that's just my opinion of the two, feel free to post your own.

      It has become very clear to me over the past several months that Gayle Campbell likes to consolidate her power a little too much. I think that this is one of the main reasons for our problems. Gayle never tells anyone else what the hell is going on. She keeps all the information to herself. A perfect example would be this morning, where there was no meeting. She calls me up last night and tells me that there is no meeting. Doesn't ask me what I think we should do, doesn't ask me if I would like to run the meeting because she is unavailable, but just says that there is no meeting. She didn't even stay on the line all that long. 18 seconds isn't much time to put in your word. I didn't even get to say good-bye. I start on another subject and then I realize there is no body on the other line. If anything is to ever get done she needs to start relaying information to people, and start delegating jobs out, not just keep everything to herself.

      It is now your time to exercise your responsibility and vote. On Tuesday you will be able to hit the polls and vote for your Class and SA Senators (Look out for an easily recognizable name *-*wink*-*) All though these 12 you are able to choose may not have as much power as the officers you elected in April, they still play a vital role in our government's system. The only way we will ever get change, is if we fight for it, if we stand up and vote for change. I want you to vote for change on Tuesday, slowly we will form a better student government!

      I'm not so sure that there will be a class meeting tomorrow. I know that Gayle will be away on the field trip, but most of us I believe will still be at school. I'll be calling Gayle tonight to see what she wants us to talk about. Really, there isn't much to be said for the class, the end of the year is approaching, we are wrapping up things. From the looks of it, our budget is showing massive holes this year, before the dance we had a little under $700, when we started our term off with right around $3000, I would say this years profit margin will be about -$2000. To review what we did this year, we started off with about 1,500 from leftover Class of 2003 funds. Homecoming costs hit us big, countering our profits from the freshman mixer. A November conference put a little hole in our pocket, the rose sale covered up that loss. Then the big Traverse City conference took out a chunk of change which the Spring Dance surely won't be able to counter. As we wrap up the year, we have a special surprise coming your way, plus we will be working on our banner for the incoming freshman, and putting together a binder for them to use as a model when they start-up their government. Feel free to post any of your comments!

      Just a quick moment to say, I'M BACK! That's right, the office cannot make me remove this web blog, it has nothing to do with my campaign for a student government office. Although even if I was going to make one about that I'm not entirely sure they could even take it down then, I have a task force looking into the legality of Michelle Yankee's decision. Anyway, back to the point, this web blog is not here for my own self gain, it's here for yours. I hope that this web blog can put an end to all the "What does our class do anyway?" This blog is here to keep our class office holders, and our student body on the same page. With each blog I post, there will be an opportunity for you to get your voice heard by posting a comment, If you would rather just ask me a question without going through the site feel free to e-mail me. Once I figure out how to add links to the blog, there will be a mail link to my e-mail address. There isn't much here yet, but check back daily for more posts.

      Since there will most likely be more than just a few posts with the title Homecoming Update I'm putting the date on there from now on. Anyway, I recently received word back from our president on more homecoming stuff. I urge each and every one of our class members to participate in the homecoming preparations, the more support we receive, the better the homecoming festivities we will have.  As of now, no meetings have been set. But if you could help out with any of the following things, please let a Class Officer or Senator know, or tell me and I will relay the message:  -Volunteer Artists to help with the indoor banner -Chaperones for the poster, float, and outdoor decoration parties -Food and Drink for the poster, float, and outdoor decoration parties -Bagels and Juice for our Spirit Day -A place to store decorations -Ten convertible type cars to drive Sophomore Homecoming Court and Student Council Members  Once again if you can help with any of the things listed above, please contact a Class Officer, Senator, or myself. Your help will be greatly appreciated.

      Hard to believe we are already working on homecoming procedures already! I was not at the first homecoming meeting, but I have contacted the class president, vice-president, and secretary, and have requested the dates of any upcoming events so I can post them here for you. Through several talks I have found out that are theme is Super Mario Bros. but that is all I know at this point.

      A new Strategic Plan Committee is being put together by our superintendent. The job of the committee will be to "update our mission statement, beliefs, objectives, parameters, and strategies to guide the school system's efforts, resources, and spirit toward improved quality of teaching and learning, as well as service to our community. To ensure that the new plan reflects the views and needs of all the constituencies that the school system services." The school system will be updating its plan to "refocus the school system's vision in order to meet the needs of future students and to ensure that its commitment to continuous improvement is met."  If you are interested in being on the committee, send a letter indicating your willingness and qualifications to serve to:   Dr. C Suzanne Klein Superintendent of Schools 389 St. Clair Ave. Grosse Pointe, MI 48230  If you can't think of any qualifications, just indicate that you are a dedicated student, one that wishes to see success in this districts future. That by being a student you know what this school system needs.

      This is so rigoddamndiculous. How many times do I have to write people before I get an answer. How irresponsible must our administrations be. It's one thing not to agree with me, but at least hear what I have to say and have the decency to reply back. I have sent many letters and e-mails to the Superintendent, Asst. Superintendents, our Principal, Asst. Principals, Board Members, do any of them respond, No. It is absolutely rigoddamndiculous. And don't think they have heard the last from me, they are still working, and I have no problem going down to the board office and requesting a face to face meeting.

      This past week the five cities that make up Grosse Pointe, and a small portion of Harper Woods voted in a School Board Election. I am disgusted with the current school board. The two incumbent members to whom terms expired were Jack Ryan and Steve Mathews. Mr. Ryan stepped down taking out one of the current board members, leaving Mathews the only venerable member this year. Two open seats three candidates. Although I don't like Angela Kennedy I think she will sway with whatever is majority. Just watching the woman speak on TV, she never had her own answer, she was constantly stealing responses from the other two candidates, and she took forever to speak. Mr. Ismail on the other hand I have been very pleased with. I agree very much with his views and I think he has the best interest of the students on his mind. In the end our cause prevailed, as your parents saw what was right, and voted that way. Congrats to new board members Ahmed Ismail and Angela Kennedy. Just Five more to get rid of.

      Just taking another minute to talk about pay to play. Pay to play, although it is a good idea, in our case, will be unfaily administered. Pay to play will make all South Sports, including club sports (Crew, Sailing, and Field Hockey) to pay fifty dollars to play to cover expenses.   Sounds fair right, they will only make you pay for part of the cost, wrong! In the case of club sports you have to pay more than the school even gives you. Take crew for example. Each rower receives a total of twelve dollars from the district*, if I only receive twelve dollars from the school, why am I paying them fifty. In essence I am paying for someone else's sport. My money is probably thrown into funds for football equipment, does that make any sense. If I'm being forced to pay fifty dollars to play, at least fund me fifty dollars.  Tell your  urlLink Superintendent ,  urlLink Superintendent of Business Affairs ,  urlLink Board of Education ,  urlLink Principal , and  urlLink Athletic Director  that you think pay to play is unfair, and don't just say that, give them an elaborate reason so they don't just think you're some idiot, they won't listen to you.  *That figure is from the 2004 School Board Election Debate

      It's sad to say that our only administrator capable of doing anything decent to help us (the student body) has now left us. Gary Buslepp our former Asst. Principal applied for the position of principal at Pierce Middle School. After going through the process of picking an applicant DR. C. Suzanne Klien (Superintendent of Schools) made the decision to bring in Buslepp. We wish Mr.Buslepp good luck at Pierce, and hope that the superintendent makes a wise choice when picking our new Asst. Principal so we don't have all incompetent fools running our school.

      For a short time the administrators of the Alex For 2007 blog were considering moving the blog from blogger.com to blog.com but have determined that blogger is a much better choice. In looking, mostly at features and appearance, we chose blogger over blog for reasons like. . .         Blogger offers a spell check (Which I really need!)     Blogger has more choices in design.     Blogger is more user friendly and eaisier for me to post with, blog.com has many complicated menus and they create odd words I don't understand.    We are happy to be staying on with blogger.com and will now shift back to student government news.

      In your registration packet you should have received information on when and where our Homecoming Activities will be held. If you for some reason have lost this information feel free to contact me at  urlLink alexfor2007@gmail.com . I would prefer you e-mail me rather then having me post the information here because then anyone out there that has internet access could view where certain people live or where a bunch of sophomores are going to be and I think that is a bit of a security risk that I don't want weighing down on my conscience. So if you would like to participate in Homecoming Activities but don't know where or when they are going to be, again feel free to contact me,  urlLink alexfor2007@gmail.com .
