      WoW..Well, how's everybody doing? As for me, I am sorta bummed out...We just moved to Minneapolis in MN and I don't know anyone yet, except for my step-sister and bro's. Well, sOoOo much things are happening to me. I gotta baby-sit my younger brothers. My mom and the other folks went back to Milwaukee to pack up everything. I just don't know why my mom would move sOoo quickly....all of a sudden? I mean, why now? I'm meeting new people and I'm having more fun than ever and it's just the begininng of summer! Why don't she understand what's best for her kids? UGH! I hate this shiet sOoOo much...if only you was in my spot you would know how it's like...it's like she doesn't love us aymore...(im starting to cry)Why does life have to be sOoOO hard!!!! Gosh....I'm going to miss my friends so much. A tear is going to burst out of my heart because I can't move on with my life....im sooOo sad right now...please excuse me for being sOOO emotional right now. I don't know what to do anymore....Why does it have to be like this way....By the way, you wanna see my geocities page of me and my gurloz??? Well, here's the site:  urlLink Our Site . It's not finished but oh well...hmm....Life is screwed up right now....I want to just go take off in a lamborghini diablo and just go by myself  and take a road trip to California....And then just stay a couple of nights at the beach and get drunk with my 3 older sister's. And just sleep there and just try to have the best time of our lives. And to have a party at the beach with our favorite music songs on....I wish this would happen but I'm losing sOoOo much faith and hope right now....Sooner or later, I'm going to break out and start crying out of no where...I have no one to turn to now....I just hope that everything wil be alright and that I will get to see my friends more often even if it means to just drive over there for 6 hours and just to get a chance to say "hi" and "good-bye". I'll still be happy. Life was good, until my mom started to do this to me and my sister....She put sOoOo much pressure on us  two...Well, I think that I have been blogging on for a long time sOo immma go now...take good cares of yourself and be good! Have fun! I love you! Shoutouts to my 3 older sisters---->I love you sOoOOo much and I miss you tOo!!!!.....Take cares! Buh-Byes!

      I dont wanna go to Appleton this weekend at all...Why do we have to do this stuff since we dont even believe in these stupid shiet...why? My step-brother is a big-tyme bitch about all this shiet...He's not even worth claiming as a step-brother. hell...I should just call him a stranger because he doesnt even do anything with our family. All he do is just day-dream about the weekends going to his brothers house. I mean yeah its all good but thats all he cares about. All he cares about is just him and his brother. oh wOw! isnt that amazing??!?! Never really did spend quality time together at all!!! and KEEP IT THAT WAY!!! because I hate this life and I hate my step-father and his 2 step-sons!!! I hate them! Why does it have to be like this??? I will never ever give up hope in GOD and I will always continue to love and cherish GOD forever even when I dont exist in this world anymore. I hate this life and my family. I just wish all the pain can just wash away but it cant! Why? I just wish that I knew why?! And my uncle is going to Milwaukee this weekend! You son of a bitch! We coulda just went to Milwaukee this past week! You dumbass Bitch! WTF is wrong with you??? You just want us to suffer all that shiet while you get all the fun and we get all stressed out!!!! ARGH!!! I cant take it anymore. I feel like killing myself and torturing everyone I hate the most!!!! But I know that that's a sin so I wont do anything. I just hope that I wont have to do this stupid shiet and that probably someday I can go back to being myelf rather than just a person in this strange world locked in a cage with no one around. Im so useless! Well, anyways I guess that I be talking tOoOoOo much shiet so byes and hope that ya life isnt as misrable as mine. bye.

       It's a RAINY day  I feel so deperessed right now because it looks dark outside. I wish I had someone I can talk to and hold. Damn...Life sucks for me...I hate this...I hate everything. I wish that I was back in Milwaukee...I miss my friends. I mis everything. I wanna go back. Im planning to buy a coat for the money that I saved up. Probably in the summer, I'll run away and catch a greyhound to Milwaukee. There, I will go stay with my dad for the summer. I dont want to let my family know what Im up to, but I need some money because I wanna run away. I dont wanna stay here no more. Im so sick and tired of this. I wish that I can have the  Perfect Life . But I dont. I wish that everything was back to normal, which means that Im still living in Milwaukee, going to River Side High School, and Ih ave my friends there for me. Life is not fair. I just hate it so much. I wish so much, that I can actually see it coming true. But it s not. Its fading away. I wanna move back so much. But I know that I have to move on. My friends wont even remember me. I bet they wont. I am  Worthless . I have nothing to do in Life. I just wish that I had a LIFE. But I dont. I wish that I can be myself. Without my soul, I cant be me. Why cant I? What is wrong with me? Am I going crazy? I hope I dont but it looks like it. I just wish the best for me. I feel like going to sleep and never wake up. Never see a daylight again for as long as I live. I just hope that I can feel better. I hope that I can be me again...

      Today is such a BORING aSS Day! I cant wait until this weekend!!!I hope to have some fun. I would really like to go to Milwaukee, but life isnt that simple and more complicated. I hate Life but this is how its gonna be forever. Might as well just live with a fear rather than nothing at all...I just hope that all goes well for me in the future. And that if anything comes in my way or made a huge impact in my life, I just hope that its good, because I dont like to get any bad gifts. I hate staying home because I just hate it. Im always home. I have no where to go. I am worthless...Not a thing to do in the world. I just hope that one day, I can make a difference in someone's life or make the world better. I just hope that...i dont know. Im lost and confused about everything. No one is there to walk with me whenevr Im feeling lonely, sad, confused, or even happy. I just wish I was back in Milwaukee. Thats were I belong. I dont belong HERE in Minneapolis. I wish I was to my old self. I was happy with myself and my friends. Now, I have nothing...I just hate everything now. Starting a new life, school, and making new friends is sOoOoOo hard for me to accomplish, but I dont want to become an outsider. I wish I was myself. Im never gonna go anywhere if Im gonna stay like this forever. I wish there was a ay I can be happy and be myself. I desperately need help. Someone please help me and please pray to me that tommorrow will bring a better day and that good things will come to me, not bad things. Please help me!!! I love you god, but it seems so unfair for me. I am only 14, and I dont want to feel like this anymore. I want to be happy, cheerful, pleasant, loveable, funny, smart, intelligent, and everything I wish I could be. Im lost. I wish someone could love me and hold my hand when I need it. I wish I had a friend who understand me almost completely and listen to all my problems. But I guess that its not that easy...for anyone. Well, anyways...I guess I better end this depressing ass blog for today so buh-byes everyone!!! Love ya always!!!

I remembered the time Life was full of SHIT and I told my black friend at sckool that I was gonna kill myself. The next day, I didnt show up at school...And she told the guidance counselor that I was gonna kill myself...I was amazed that she actually cared about me...It made me feel special that someone was actually worried about me...Im just glad that she did that for me...And i'll never forget that because it takes alot of heart to tell the guidance counselor the things that your friend tells you to keep a secret...MAN...I miss those good old days....Well, as for me, I had to go talk to the counselor and all....It was a very sad moment but then, I felt relieved that someone knew what was going on inside of me...Not that I get to keep everything inside myself...But you know....And now...I miss my friend still...I just wished that I never moved from Milwaukee...It will do me good...Better than here...I hate my life soOoOoOOoo much....I just wished I died...But then again....Life has so much to offer....And yet...so little time....I just want to be with my loved ones...I really wanna go to Milwaukee...No matter what...there is still a deep dark spot that calls out to Milwaukee....My HOMETOWN...It will always be my hometown...My home...Now im about to cry...So many moments lost in a flash...Why cant we just stay and have fun??? I dont want to start all over again....I dont wanna be a loner again...I just wanna be me...With kao sue, maddogg, moniee, kore, sidney, everyone i miss...I just wish that life was that easy....for me...

      Well, nothing is new today. I just got kinda in trouble on Friday and thats all. Then I went and watch Barber Shop 2. It was funny but its aite. Well, anyways...things are going smoothly so far. I cant think of anything to say to people anymore. It seems as if my mind is empty and I have no emotions. Damnz...I feel so numb inside myself. Damnz...But anyways... I have to go buy my friend something. Her birthday is coming up and I wanna give her something. But I hope I can. Well, anyways... Time flies so much... yet no matter what it seems as if I dont change. I always stay the same no matter what. I wanna be different from everyone else. unique. But how? I am a low life loser and I have nothing to live for except being a good daughter and student. Damnz... I have to do my homework still and I have to hurry up on my projects. Damnz...I dont know why i am so frustrated yet I feel so numb inside. I cant seem to find the meaning of life. When all is lost and I cant feel any love, pain...just nothing. I cant live my life like this anymore. I cant take it anymore...I just cant seem to figure out all these emotions I feel...I cant seem to explain. But why do I have these emotions anyway?? I dont know but whatever. I hope that i figure it out soon enough. Well, anyways...I gtg... Im just sOoOo confused right now. Bye.

I guess that all those times we shared were just lies...Nothing but to make their life happy and us SAD...MAN that is hella gay...sh0o...I just want to know why they blame all their problems on us...I mean...They were also the cause of why my family hate me... Because I hang out with the wrong Crowd...I should of always been a goody girl...But naw...I was tOo stupid to understand that life was harsh...For any age...MAN...I just want to know why she would blame it all on us...I mean...shiet...We didnt do anything to her or her family...Now I guess that she turned against us...Or she must of mistaken us for another female...MAN...I dont like the feeling of having best friends anymore...I just cant handle the pressure and stress...Man...I juse wish that someone was here to help me and love me...But theres no one there for me to run to...MAN... I hate life sOo much...I just wish that I could run to a never ending forest and cry out all my feelings to the winds...MAN...Everythings bull... I dont even think I have any True Friends...I feel so useless now...More than ever...Man...I just wish that I was that Happy Kid, I used to bo way back in Rhode Island...I just wish that I wasnt in my position right now...But I cant do anything...right? Right!!! So the best thing to do is to "BRUSH THE DIRT OFF YOUR SHOULDERS". And look out world...because I cant keep living like this...I have to do something...with my life....

      THERE ARE TWO SIDES OF EVERYONE. Thats what I think...There is always a solution and a mistake. But most people take the mistake than the solution. But Why? To me, personally...I think that people act the way they do for attention, pleasure, confidence, love, friendship...and many other things. I just want to know why do we exist? I dont know my destiny but it seems like Im going no where with my life. I just wish that I can do something about it...But what?I dont know...But I hope that I will...Well, anyways...I have to go so byes. God Bless and let us pray that I will go to Milwaukee for sure. Byes.

DAMNZ...I also have these CUTE ass flip flops with some rhinestones on it. oOoOo! But my feet are tOo big so it might show how big my feet really is. Anyhow...My head is spinning and I think that Im gonna be sick. MAN...I am hella hungry. Yesterday I went to the buffet...And got hella full! My little bro challenged me to a eating contest. And guess what? I beat him! HAH! Take that you lilo boi! I was sOoOo full...That is made me look like I was PREGANENT! hahaha...Anyways....Im suppose to call my friend but oh wells...Maybe she'll call me.

      Wussup ya! Well, nothing much going on nowadays....Im glad that Kong actually took pichas of us. Im happy though...I do still miss Allen but this is not the time to think about him. Im planning to do alot of stuff for the summer. Like, get a summer job, go shopping, visit Milwaukee, visit my grandma in Rhode Island, go party, go play, wanna learn how to drive and iono...Whateva...Anywho...Lifes been pretty cool and I like it....But when I get home...Its a different story. Nothing to do around the house but just sleep, eat, cook, clean, go on the internet, do homework, read, watch t.v, blah blah blah...The usual things happens. Anywho, I wanna go play sOoOo bad...Sometimes I wish I could be able to drive and go where ever I want. But life's not that simple. I hate it when you dont get what you want! I wish life was a piece of cake. But I guess that this is life and there's nothing we can do but just lie through it. All the sad times, bad times, happy times, and confused times...Funny how you look back at your past...And you see yourself one year or two years ahead and say "WoW! I thought that I would never make it this far!" Then your amazed and happy at what kinf of life you have and what God gave you. Maybe it'll happen to me, but for now...Im just going to sit in the roller coaster and enjoy the ride! yes! FREEDOM is the key to anything I always wanted. I have four more years to think about that...But for now, I just want to live my life asa happy normal teenager. Living through all the drama, hard-ships, and friendships. Well, I guess that I talked tOo much about Blah Blah so byes! *Smiles*

At least I had a chance to talk to Maddogg. I miss him alot...I dont know what to do anymore. Now all I want to do is cry cry cry... Imma cry me a river. So I can just do whatever. I am happy though...That I get to see him. I just wish him the best. I do like him alot. He seems like he like me too...But Im not sure if he really likes me that way. Like what he did to me...When he went out with my very good friend. My best COUSIN to be exact. I was jealoous but now... I dont know what to do anymore...He still the same ol' Maddogg...Its just that he have a little innocence in him now... I cant think of anything to say to him...sOoOOo much things happened between him and me. And I dont think that we will ever be more than friends. I dont know why Im saying this...But I just hope that he gets a great life, which he deserves....With someone whom he loves, not me. Oh well,....Lets just see what happens. Maybe things will become better or worser. I dont know...But I just hope that it doesnt get worse as right now. Well, Imma go now so byes.

But how? I dont know...And I dont know what to do...I have so much to live for but it seems like I just throw it all away. The chance for me to be happy...I threw it all away. Nothing but tears and lifeless words that dont mean shiet. Man...Life sucks sOoOo bad for me. I just hope that some day, I can own my own house by the beach with all summer long. Nothing but clear blue sky, warm sunny sun, a loving beatiful boyfriend, and a lifetime of best friends. All of whom I love and cherish. In this world of mines, I just wish that everything was perfect. Everything.

Anywho...Nothing much to do this weekend. I gotta wash my blankets and bed sheets later so...yeah. Also, I wanna go rent some movies. I wanna rent Texas Chainsaw Massacre and Something's Gotta Give. I think that those two movies will be good. Anyhow...Under the Tuscan sun was a good movie. I like that movie cause its funny and cool. yup. man...I miss my uncle sOoOo damn much..Someone very important to me just left me...He didnt die but just left me...I feel sad because of that...Maybe its a sign that I have to stop depending on other people and depend on my own. Be INDEPENDENT. yup. Im trying to but its not like I can. But I want to. Man...Life sucks at this point in my life. In Milwaukee, it was so FLY. In the summer of 2003, that was the funnest moments of my life! I loved every part of it. But now, everythings just a dream to me. I dont know whats gonna happen but I just want something good to happen just for Once. MAN...Life sucks so much. Ever since my mom got re-married. I had to learn all the hard-ships a family has to go through. But yet, I feel as if I am walking by myself. No one by my side. I dont know but is this just a dream. Just like the MATRIX? God...I dunt know what to do anymore...Just sit here and worry about my future or do something about it...

      Hello people... Well, Well, Well...What a day today is. I was so busy with things. But at least I wan't stuck home. Anyways... Today we did my brothers birthday. It was alrite. Barbeque and everything. Now, my jaw is sore. And my head hurts. And I have a cold. How unplesant of me. DAMN! I wish that I felt better! But I don't! ARGH! Anyways, I went to Brookedale with my auntie and my sis to get my auntie's nails done. Then we had to run an errand for someone. Then I got home, flopped on the couch and enjoyed my evenings shows. :) YUP. Well, I got a BIG project due tomorrow but I don't want to do it. I found out sOoOo much stuff about my friend. He's gonna regret it when I get to school...But hopefully he did some of the work. Anyways...Today was cool...I guess...It was sprinkling rain on and off...Busy weather issues. Well, toodle! Bye now! :)

He's always somewhere...Like getting laid or something. FUCK! I hate him for leaving us...If we were still a family then I think that life would be better than this. We wouldn't be in this messed up place! Everything is wrong to me. But I don't know why...I guess that this is a challenge. For me to understand that life's not perfect. Not for anyone! I am sOoOo tired....Anywho...Yesterday was my brother's birthday.

WE GONNA PARTY LIKE ITS YOUR BIRFDAY!!hahaha...Anywho...I got my shirt dirty by drinking "Turtle Mocha". DAMNZ! I always get myself dirty. Anywho...I just got done talking on the phone with my friend. She's hella cool! yeah...Anyways...I have a running nose! MAN! I hate it! And its not even winter! I wonder why I get a stuffy nose and a runny nose when it's summer and spring! MAN! That sucks sOoOo bad! I wanted to go see if my auntie and them were gonna drink cause I wanna drink sOoOOoOooOooo BAD! But, I don't want to cause it's bad for you...I quit smoking and drinking for sOoOoo long!

Anyways, I guess that tomorrow I can't do anything because my mom and dad are going to a meeting all day. And I am stuck bored at home. Maybe I'll tag along with my sis but if that's not good, then I'll probably stay home. My brothers might come back this weekend. Well, lets just hope they do cause' I miss them.

I guess that things change. And people change too. I don't know why but I feel like a whole different person. I don't know why. Maybe I am just too depressed or just thinking too much. Well, today better be a good day for me. I hope so. Well, none of my friends have called me yet. I guess that they're busy. Unlike me, I am never busy. Just running errands. Well, nothing for me to do today. I am going to go shopping on Friday and I wanna watch a movie. I really wanna watch "The terminal". I think that it'll be a good movie. Anyways, I hate my grandma sOOOOOO bad!!! I hate her sOOOO much! She is sOOO fucking crazy! Swear to GOD! (Not like that but you know.)Well, I hope that I get to do something today. Well, bye ya!

      Heylow people. This is Macy talking to ya. Well, anyways...I don't wanna go to the store today because of iono. Just don't feel like doing anything at all! Wel, I feel kinda depressed and sad rite now. But then again I am happy that I get to see some people. Well, my report card didn't come yet. And I don't know when I'll take the Basic Skills Math test. I'm kinda slow in a way...hehehe(only in math). Well, nothing much to do right now. I miss all my school friends. But it's kool. Well, later I will have to make some eggrolls because it's this thing called "potluck" at my momma's workplace. Well, anyways...I miss all my "used-to-be-friends". MAN!!! We were always sOOOO cool. But I guess that the friends that stick by you from all those hard times are your true friends. And only a couple of the "used-to-be-friends" made it this far. I am suprised because I used to have 2 best friends/cousins but now they're gone. I hope that they are having a good life though. :) Anyways, I wanna watch a movie and all! Well, I just hope that I don't get to stay in the house for the whole summer! Anyways, see ya! Peace! :)

      Hey wussup ya! Well, me...Nothing much going on...I am just kinda moody. MAN! I hate staying home! I wish that I can go play but I don't know. I guess that I don't have the courage to do things like I used to do...It's a sad day for me because it's gonna be rainy...It's gonna rain for 3 days. Then it'll shine, then rain again. I can't believe that I am 15! I am sooo proud of myself. I really miss kao sue and moniee. MAN! I can't stop thinking about them. I wish that we were still kool as hell with eachother. I wonder if they're having fun without us. I think that they forgot us already. Oh wells, friends don't last forever. Might as well walk along...you know? I'm not sure what to do with my life...It's kinda confusing, boring, and sad at the same time. Thats how I feel everyday when I wake up. I just wish that I had a great true friend who will cheer me up and care about me, and take me places and just have fun! But there's no one like that. I wish there was someone like that so I can stop feeling so worthless and live life to the fullest. I just hope that I will find that special someone...Soon because I am running out of time. Well, I can't wait until I go to RI! Well, thats all for now so peace.

      My friend, Teresa called me earlier. Then my sister got mad at me. MAN!!! Its not like I want this crappy ass life of mines! No one would ever want my life! My life sucks really BAD! Anyways, I can't wait until I go to RI. I hope that I get to go because I miss my grandma DEARLY and everyone up there. MAN! I wish that I can go somewhere where I can just let all my feelings go down. And then, life would be much easier for me. Because I would go there every day and take out all my anger, sadness, confusion, depression, evyerthing. Then, I would be happy. No one want to listen to me. No one cares. I have no one beside me. I walk on this earth on my own...And sometimes, Life is just better if it was just two feet walking along a single path to their destiny...Their love, their happiness, their laughter, their everytihng. Anyways, I hope that I get to go to the store later today because I wanna get some stuff. And I just wanna go somewhere. I hate it when you have to stay home for the WHOLE damn day! I hate that! I can't wait to watch "QUEER EYE FOR THE STRAIGHT GUY"!!! I LOVE THAT SHOW!!! That is like my favorite show on this whole solar system!!! I can't live without the FAB 5!!!(I can, but there wouldn't be that much joy in my life!)Anyways, I am hoping to go to BC mall soon because I wanna go see if my friend is gonna work there. And if he does, then Imma start laughing and just be sOOO surprised!! Ahahaha...It's gonna be sOOOO funny cause he's gay. Hahahaha...I hope that I get to go to Rosedale Mall because I want to go to Herberger's, cause this weekend, they're giving away free samples from 9 a.m-10 a.m. But you have to pay $20 to get in. Now, that sucks! But, I just wanna go cause they're also giving away free makeovers and make-up tips. So that'll be good. Anywho, i have to go now so byes.  Life's a bitch. And that's what I learned about my whole life.

      Hello all! Well, nothing much going on. I just got a call from my dad. I am happy that he called. I miss him. I also miss my grandma and auntie and uncle and cousins! I miss them sOOOOOOOOOOOO much! Well, I am going to visit them on July 27th! Then I'll probably stay there for like a month. Then come back. Well, I just hope that it will bring much joy and fun in my life! Well, everyday seems so LONG for me! It seems like I am a lifeless person in this world. Like I am the only person who just sit around the house and don't do anything. I wonder why I feel like this in my heart. I can feel it tearing me apart. I feel like I'm not myself at all. I mean...what is wrong with me? I try sOOO hard to be myself but it's not working. I just wish that my wish can come true. That I will find a person who I love the most. And give that person my heart. He has to be good looking, good attitude, good everything! I really wish I can find a person like that...But it seems like I can't even find myself! I mean, who would ever want a gurl who doesn't know what she wants. And better yet, who would want someone who is a worthless human being who doesn't deserve to be in this life? I mean...Who in the the whole world would like to be with me? I just feel so out of place. I wish I can go somewhere where I can escape this horrible life of mines and just let all my feelings go down. I just wish that Ican share this with. I'm sOOO freaking tired of keeping all my emotions inside of me! I just wish that I could be SOMEONE in this world. Like I can make a difference in this world, even if it was just one person. I would do it. I would give up my life to a person who has cancer and let me be them. At least that would be better than where I am today. Deep down inside of me, I don't know what I want, who to talk to, where to turn to, who to trust, where to hide, where to find my true friends, I don't know anything. This is life is sOOO surreal to me. It's like this a dream that I am living in. Like I can't wake up. I really need someone to talk to. I would love to talk to my friend Pai, but I don't even think she's awake. It's kinda late and all..Oh wells, I'll probably call her tomorrow or something. Well, I am sOOOO depressed these past few days. I don't know what to do...GOD...Please help me out!!! I desperately need a sign. Any kind of sign. Just tell me something about myself. I really need help. I just wish that someone would be a REAL friend and actually listen to me. And be loyal to me. And trust me. And just understand me. From my point of view anyways. Well, I guess that I am writing alot of bullshit. Alot of things are on my mind right now so don't even bother me. I am just sOOOOOO frustrated. And confused. And sad...Well, byes.

      man...I am sooooo SAD now...I miss Milwaukee sOoOo much!!! I wish that I still lived there...I wish that I had the friends I used to have. They were sOOO cool! Now, they're gone. I am sOOOO worthless over here...I hate this place so much! I feel like I am locked up in this place and I can't seem to get out. I just wanna scream out to the world and I wish that I could cry the whole seven seas and make it fill up the whole earth. I wish that I could just be with the ones I love dearly. I have no feelings no more...I am worthless. I am nothing. I am not  me . I am sOOO different from who I used to be. I just wish that I could find a way to make things better for myself. But I can't. I hate this. I hate everything about myself. I hate eveyrthing. I wish that I was dead. If I died, I don't nobody would really care...I really wish that I could find myself in the this world. I just wish that I could be me, Maisee. Cheerful, happy, no worries, no doubts, always positive, friendly, outspoken, talkative, everything! I don't know. Maybe I'm just hallucinating. Anyways, I am hungry so Imma go grub! BIG TIME! Byes ya!

       Hello all....Well, today is okay. I went to wal-mart and bought some beauty proucts. My sis bought my lilo bro "Monopoly". Nothing much to do rite now...Just waiting for the time to pass by. Anywho...I just keep on thinking about my self-image. I wonder why I look like this...Is it in my genes? I mean, I am tall and skinny and I don't work out. I am kinda flabby on my stomach but not alot. I have a small bust and I have an okay bottom. But what I don't get is that why do I look like this? I don't look like anyone else in my family. I look as if I am different. I am not sure why I have a flat momma and a short skinny dad. It just don't look rite when the kids come out..hahaha...But to tell you the truth...I look at myself like I am a horrible creature. I wonder why I can't get a guy...How I am just so "low-self esteem". I wonder about all these things...I am very self-consious about how I look...But everything I do to better myself has always worsen me somehow. I think that I seriously need a make-over. And a new self-esteem and a new attitude...I really need to change...And I can't do that by just standing here like some lifeless wanna-be...Who just want to be "someone" in this world. I wanna make a difference...And I hope that someday, people will look back and remember me for who I really am, A nice loving caring friendly person...Anyways, can anyone please comment me on anything at all...Cause I am terribly horrified with the way I look...&nbsp;&nbsp; :)

      Hey ya...Well, DAMNZ!!! It was a big mess yesterday...I went shopping at Mall of America and the van died at the parking lot, while we was trying to pass a light. Luckily, we was in the middle of the street but in the prking lot. And then some nice people came and help us out with the engine...But that wasn't enough. When we got into the highway, the van died! Then we waited fro 2 hours until my uncle and auntie came...Then they checked the car and everything. Then we went to the parking lot again, and stayed there until my dad came...He is such an asshole! It seems as if he cared more about his sons than my mother...I guess that your first TRUE family will come first before anyone else...Anywho...I stayed there until 10:00 p.m. Then the shitiest thing happened!!! My lilo cousin hit my with rock on my forehead. Not on purpose I think but I didn't even know it was bleeding until my lilo brother told me...Anyways, after that I had to stay in the car and put a napkin on my forehead. Anyways, I got so pissed because he gave me a big bump on my forehead...I got so pissed...But I  guess that it's cool. Anyways, I hope that today will bring a better day...I am going to sleep soon so nite-nite. Bye. So tired...

      Those lonely nights...I wonder why I am so bored...so lonely...so  "not-my-self". I wish that I can just fly away from this miserable life. Right now, my parents are running broke and we barely have enough food to last us for tomorrow. It is so sad to see them try to keep us healthy and letting us eat 3 meals a day. HECK! We only eat 1 or 2 meals a day. And were not even full from it. I always go to sleep hungry because I am afraid that there won't be enough food for us. Enough of that stuff, kinda getting emotional here...I guess that American people don't know the meaning of "poverty". I wish they suffered just like us hmong people. I feel very bad for those who are hungry and those who are living a dangerous horrible life. Anyways, I hope that tomorrow I'll go to the food store..Cause' there's barely nothing in the refrigerator. Anyways, This week is going by so  slow . I wish that I could get a job and help my parens out. I feel like a bum...hahaha..I know that ya do! Well, nothing much to do...I swear! My brothers better clean up there room tomorrow or else..They gonna clean the whole house! And I mean it! OOO!!! I hate the way they are so freaking  lazy !!!!!. Well, I just hope that tomorrow will be better than today. Anyways, holla back!!! :)

      Today was kinda hectic this morning. I woke up briefly at 9:45 a.m. Then I got up and dress and did the usual. Then we got ready to do my Mom's 37 birthday. Her real birthday is on Tuesday but since we have no time to do it on Tuesday we did it today. It was cool though cause my auntie and uncle was there, and uncle frank and them, and jeff, and some other people coming by. Anyways, Now I am doing nothing. My gay friend called me yesterday. We talked for about an hour and he said that I am one of the few friends that he have that will actually listen to him and give him advice. I felt so good about myself. Anyways, Now...It's just boring. I am just watching a hmong movie with my mom. Me and my sister gave her clothes in this cute purple bag with strings on the handle and a birthday card. She was happy, and she almost cried. I feel good that I actually gave her something. Anyways, after that we went to the store to go by new sofa covers. Before everyone left, the guys carried the sofa bed into the living room. Anyways, today was okay. I didn't have that much fun but its cool. I also went to Sally beauty supply to buy me a brush and a 1" 1/4 curling iron. My brothers went to Wausau to stay there until we come down there for the labor day tournament. Well, I guess that this is all I am going to do today because I have no where to go. So I guess that I'll just stay home and watch movies. My grandma is coming tomorrow...SUCKS so much because I wish that she could never come back here. Then I'll be happy. I would really like to go to the movies today but no ride...sad but oh wells. Anyways, Imma go now...peace.
