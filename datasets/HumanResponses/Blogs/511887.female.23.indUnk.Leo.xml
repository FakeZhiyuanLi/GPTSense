      I really am in the wrong line of work. Hospitality. I couldn't be any less hospitable if I tried. Don't get me wrong, I'm very polite to customers. I always smile and say Hello! But it only takes the SLIGHTEST wrong doing on their part and I quickly turn. People really do leave their manners at the door. I refuse to be polite to people who wont return the favour. Here is a wee list of things that really piss me off. Little things that have started to fester and turned into the biggest deals on earth. I know they may seem LITTLE, but you try having it happen to you day and and day out. YOU JUST TRY IT. And yes I know i could quit but I dont wanna.  1. Thowing money on the counter. You may as well be throwing money at your feet and telling me to beg for it. FUCK YOU. 2. Not saying please or thank you. It's pretty basic. 3. Having me say Hello! and the customer just saying GIVE ME THIS and not even LOOKING at you. Fuck that makes me mad. 4.Whinging about the cost. You knew how much it was when you were ordering it.  5. Getting mad at ME because they have to wait in a line. Dont wait in the LINE THEN. 6. Talking on your cellphone while a big line forms behind you and putting your hand IN MY FACE TO STOP ME ASKING WHAT YOU WANT. This happens ALL THE TIME. So rude.  7. People leaving their tables in a filthy mess of sugar packets and food scraps. Like they had a crazy feeding frenzy. Disgusting pigs.  Today a lady asked my co-worker to please put butter on her muffin for her, which she was taking away with her. She stood there and directed where abouts and how much butter to put in which places. Why must people degrade us this way? What the fuck is wrong with your hands that you cant do it? the only time somebody has ever asked me to do that was when they had two CASTS on their arms. Am I the only one who thinks this is DISGUSTING? I was so mad I could have split. I could write for days and days about how mad my job makes me. But just when you think you cant stand seeing another UNGREATFUL THANKLESS ASSHOLE, somebody lovely comes in and is actually NICE to you and you feel all better.

      Bonjour.  Today I saw an event which made me cry for the state of the world and rejoice the goodness of others all in the space of a few seconds. Which is a common theme i guess...good and evil etc...etc. Yawn. Anyway here's the story.  So there I was, standing at work with no customers to tend to, staring out into the early night sky and the brightly lit street. Watching people walking home from work, clad in woolen jackets, briskly rubbing woolen hands tog--anyways, SUDDENLY these three "kids" come along, one of them in a wheelchair pretending to be mentally disabled with the other two kicking the chair yelling RETARD!! That probably sounds like it was funny, but it really wasn't. I dont mean that in an overly sensitive girl way, either. It was just depressing. Like, what the hell?  Then! Suddenly a grown man RACES up, grabbing one of the kids by the scruff of the neck and cries "DONT YOU EVER DO THAT AGAIN YOU INSENSITIVE FUCKING LITTLE PRICK" and the kids REELED back in TERROR. It was like an inaudable cheer went up all over wellington! Finally! Somebody had enough guts to say HEY!! WHAT YOU ARE DOING IS HORRIBLY UNACCEPTABLE!! It was a great moment indeed. I felt slightly elated. I felt as though this would be how I would deal to situations from now on. No more sitting back and watching it happen, no sir. Then I realised that I wouldn't change at all and I felt ashamed and depressed for a moment, then I stopped thinking about it altogether because somebody came into the store and started DEMANDING a drink. No need for manners! I DONT HAVE FEELINGS I"M JUST A ROBOT SLAVE. Oops, always off on the tangents.  Bye!

      This is a "rant" about something that sometimes really pisses me off. It's not really a big deal, and if this is all i have to worry about then i should be glad BLAH BLAH WHATEVER, but I still feel I am entitled to be mad about it and VENT MY RAGE in text, here it is.  My boyfriend, lets call him "Tim", never EVER does anything to help me keep the house tidy. I don't mean insanely tidy, i just mean a low-level kind of tidy. Comfortable tidy. I have a lot of stuff, so things get untidy easily. Tim does not do one single thing to help my cause. It was okay before, when he was earning all the money and I just sat at home eating chocolates and watching Dr Phil, but now i give him most of the money I earn slaving away at my job six days a week. I contribute! But the burden of having to look after EVERYTHING is still firmly rested on my shoulders.   Tim looks after the bills and makes sure everything gets paid, etc, etc. But that only takes a few minutes because he does it all ONLINE LIKE A BIG NERD. I spend at least two hours a day doing washing and making beds and so on and so on and so on. Sometimes I say...Hey tim, maybe you could do the dishes tonight, i'm really tired. Sure! he says, "I'll do it tomorrow, before i go to work." .....what?  Here's a little example of a typical situation that pisses me off so much i feel like taking a knife and slashing my own face to bits so i can go to hospital and not have to do any housework f--anyway, here's an example. Tim likes to take his clothes off before he goes to bed in the LOUNGE. and leave them on the CHAIR and on the floor. Apparently its warmer in there. I dont need to go into the ten million reasons why this is a completely idiotic reason, as I feel it is fairly apprent. Next day, Oh, my SHIRTS ALL CRUMPLED, Liz can you IRON it for me? Cue sad face. His, not mine, mines more of a rage face. Liz if you get time before work and inbetween cleaning my underpants can you please wash all my shirts for me? Ta.  The fact that I have to tidy things away seems to be the reasoning behind the fact Tim can never FIND anything. You tidyed it away! Where have you put my "......". He totally flips out. This morning i was woken up at 7:30 AM on the day of my ONLY sleep in, because "LIZ I HAVE LOST MY WALLET" so i get up. Stumble around the house and say HEY

      Open letter to: My Future Internet Friend  Hi! How are you? I am fine. I am writing to let you know that, no matter what you think now, one day we will be the best of internet friends. Regardless of the fact that right now you consider me a total psycho, one day this will appear endearing and you will look upon it in a loving, knowing light. Don't worry, I love you too.  So, Dearest, Future Internet Friend (obviously I'm not talking about you Jeremy, or i would say Fickilist, time-hogging current internet friend who i am currently seeking replacement for) I hope you took this time to read this and consider my application. I'm a really GREAT internet friend, and promise not to ditch you as soon as something better comes along, unlike some people. I'm looking at you, JJB.  Bye!

      Hello again. And a special hello to my most dedicated reader, Jeremy Burtenshaw. Hope everything is going well with the new template hunt.   Today was completely reproachable in every respect. Thousands of greedy, impatient and most noticably obsese and ugly customers were in a continuous state of trying to jam themselves through the narrow entrance of the shop. While the three of us coward behind the counter desperatly trying to throw together drinks and food orders while they stood sullen and homourless, alternating from staring at their watches to staring at us with their evil, unforgiving eyes. After lurching around trying to please everyone for around five solid hours we were then given the luxury of closing the shop and spending two hours washing their cheap waxy lipstick from the rims of the cups. Oh, thanks for stomping your stale cookie into the carpet, that really made my fucking day.

      Hi!  Whenever I'm feeling lame enough to keep a "diary" or write stuff places in say...a BLOG, I cant ever write anything when something important is happening. My diarys always die out when something great has happened or something depressing has happened, then I feel I cant pick them up again without some kind of explaination to myself about it. In written form. Which I really struggle with. So I thought I should break that now so I will write something here again.  On the weekend I got engaged! To be MARRIED! OMG.  K that's all.
