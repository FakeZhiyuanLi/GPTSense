      I am on call.&nbsp; I am soooo tired.&nbsp; It is 1:20am and I only have 6.5 hours left!&nbsp; WOO-HOO!&nbsp; I have been here since 8am.&nbsp; Weekends are 24 hour call.&nbsp; The weekdays are the worse as you can potentially be up for 36 hours.&nbsp;   I still have to write and spill my guts about what happened to my other blog.&nbsp; Suffice to say the boyfriend was not happy that I was talking about him to all of you.&nbsp; So I took the other one down.&nbsp; I missed writing, so I am back.&nbsp; But I am leaving him out of it!&nbsp; He is so good to me so he will not be a topic for my blogs anymore.&nbsp; :)  I gotta get back to work.&nbsp; Will write more soon!&nbsp; I sold the house y'all.&nbsp; It was quite an emotional time.&nbsp;

      Well, I am back!&nbsp; After much renting of clothes and gnashing of teeth, I decided I missed you guys too much and missed posting my random thoughts of madness.&nbsp;   I have made a new blog, rather than repost all the old stuff.&nbsp; I will have to update you new kids on my history.&nbsp; And later will update you old kids on where I have been.&nbsp;   Suffice to say it feels good to be back!&nbsp; I am on call tonight at the hospital, so I will post more later.&nbsp; Just wanted to get this first post out there.&nbsp;

      I am not enjoying blogging like I used to. I used to post every day or several times a day when I had the old blogsite. Then the fiance made a big stink on how I was talking to strangers about our arguments and asked me to stop. No problem, but now I feel down in the dumps and have no desire to write. I am thinking about recreating the old site, down to my little weather pixie and all. Maybe it will perk me up.  This month I am at  urlLink Akron Children's Hospital .  It is a pain to drive every month, but it is good experience.  I am in their ER.  I have seen some very sad things this month.  Today I was involved in a little 20 month old boy that was "drop kicked" across a porch.  Thankfully he was not hurt and went home tonight.  I could have just killed the guy that did it.  Nope, I take that back, I would like to torture people that abuse children.  Next month back at my own hospital in the ER.  I am tired.  I am going home.
