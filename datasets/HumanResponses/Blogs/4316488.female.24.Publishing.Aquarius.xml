       Well,  yesterday was hell.  Had a lot of stuff happen, pulled through it though, thanks to the support of my friends.  Read a bullshit posting on volumeofdeath.com about me, claiming a bunch of fucking lies about me as being truth.  Yeah, as if I would fucking pose nude on fucking cam... oh, wait, only way Joey would know that was if it was him.. but wait, I hate the fucking prick, and I wouldn't EVER in a million years do something that lame assed. Joey can kiss my fucking lily white ass, no one really fucking cares what you fucking have to say Joey, if anything, it's probably the only way you can get any attention yourself from all your sad assed lil cronies.  Pretty sad if you ask me, that you have to resort to attempting to make others look pathetic to make yourself look bigger.  Shame it defeats the purpose of doing it, since those who know me, and really know me, wouldn't believe you anyways, and would only look at you for the asshole you are.  So, go ahead Joey, keep insulting me, or at least trying to, I know the truth of who I am, and so do my true friends.  I find it rather amusing anymore to watch your lame attempts to humiliate me.  Last night in my room had me laughing so hard irl.  Thanks for being the comic relief last night Joey, was really funny.    Let's be sure to do that again, okay ?  I need a daily dose of laughter, it's good for the soul. =]

       Well, it's only been moments since I opened this blog and I felt the urge to post again. A lot has gone on this weekend, it's been hard on me. A very dear friend of mine has made a lot of changes in their life, some very good decisions that I am very proud of them for, although I know that to achieve those decisions it is going to be hard for them. I am going to do all I can to be there for them, as I do for all my friends, but I am going to make an extra special effort here because I have been this person's friend for a long time, and I care a great deal for this friend. I only hope they realize how much they mean to me. I hope all my friends realize how much they mean to me.
