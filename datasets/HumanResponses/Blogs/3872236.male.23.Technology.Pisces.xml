        I'm listening to " My bloody Valentine ", I don't know what album is it but it is an incredible one. I will see that now on my jukebox. The name of this album is " Loveless " and is a fucking good one.

        A south-east wind is blowing this afternoon : the weather is good to take my board. This evening, I will help Erwann to buy a laptop and wifi accessories to make a LAN for his job. then I will running with Christophe and J.M. to prepare for a adventure raid in September.     Yesterday evening, I didn't see  My neighboor Totoro , I chose to see  Rush Hour 2 . I think it is not a good Jacky Chan movie, dialogues are worth and fights are not so beautiful but the spanish federal agent is very cute.

       I saw a lot of movies these previous weeks :         K-PAX  : a pleasant movie about an ET who comes on earth to have act of generosity done around him,           A.I.  : an interesting movie where human beings and robots live together, it's hard to make the difference between The two bodies,          Finding Forrester  : a black man enters in a world which is different from his world but an old writer will help him to realize their dreams, and finally          "Laputa : castle in the sky "  is an anime movie produced by Hayao Miyazaki : very beautiful and touching.    Tonight, I think I will see another anime movie : My neighboor Totoro.    Blog later.

        I work very hard today. I don't surf the net a lot and I see my collegue M.O. to test my work on the web site. Steven is seing me writing a post on my blog while he is working on GIS (Geographical Information Systems). Apparently I is very interested by this job.  The sky is blue and the sun is shining. I don't really know if the wind is blowing. Maybe I will take my board this evening...

       This great marine party finishes today, ships go to Douarnenez. I go the self-service restaurant of Ifremer to see them. It was quite beautiful : large view, ships under sail but cloudy sky. The next party will take place in 2008.

       It's past midnight, I think I will go to sleep soon but before I will read a little " Globalia ". I'am listening a mix of Paul Oakenfold, I don't know the name of the album but it's very calming.  Tomorrow, it's my mother's birthday, the photo album is nearly finished.  I'm in holydays until the 13th september. I still have a month to do nothing, it's pleasant.  I will brush my teeth, see you later...
