      "Life is so beautiful." -- Don Vito Corleone  I just realized something: my life is pretty decent, and I am excessively happy with and proud of myself. Looking back at the last 12 months I am seeing real results of my constant hard work and sacrifice. I am definitely getting to where I want to be. Not only that, but the same can be said for all the years of my adult life, going back to 1996. I have grown, I have matured, I have gained wisdom. I have known pleasure and pain, love and hate, confidence and uncertainty. I know myself. I know what I want out of life, and the steps I need to take to go get it. I have taken those first few steps and been successful, which fills me with confidence for the future. Should I fall on my journey, should obstacles fall on my current path, I know that I am man enough to get back up dust myself off, and find a new path, always keeping my goals in sight. I am excited about the possibilities. Here's to making tomorrow brighter than today.   The test of man is the fight that he makes.   The grit that he daily shows.   The way that he stands upon his feet.   And takes life’s numerous bumps and blows.    A coward can smile,   When there’s not to fear.   And nothing, his progress bars.   But it takes a man to stand and cheer.   While the other fellow stars.    It isn’t the victory after all,   But, the fight that a brother makes.   A man when driven against the wall,   takes the blows of fate.    With his head held high.   Bleeding, bruised, and pale!!   Is the man who will win, fate defied,   For he isn’t afraid to fail.   --Author Unknown

      Yes sir!  Tengo noventa y cinco por mi examen final de espanol, which puts me three points from an A in that class.  Hopefully mi profesora will give me the push, 'cuz I need that A to go with the big fat hairy A I got in my Political Science course!  Yeah!  I asked prof if he could plug me into the volunteer opportunities with Detroit Politics, and he was hip enough to put me on to the Community Council at the  urlLink Shrine of the Black Madonna  as WELL as Detroit City Council member  urlLink JoAnn Watson , and stated he'd be kind enough to write me a written recommendation!  That combined with my Men's Christian Fellowship activites at my  urlLink church  and hopeful participation in the Fannie Lou Hamer Political Action Committee should hopefully keep my schedule packed AND give me the experience I want.  All I want is to improve my city and my people, and all I need are the tools to do so.  Tragically I'm the only person in my age group and locality that seems to give a shit.

      Yep.  Spleen venting time, baby.  So, back in July, I order (via the Internet) Comcast service for the lair.  While I hate Comcast for a wide variety of reasons, I figured Basic Digital + HBO/Starz was a good deal at 29.99 for 6 months.  I would provide me with the entire football season AND some basketball, and that can't be a bad thing.  Issue #1: The Phantom Balance.  I'm informed the day after I order that service can not be set up at my location "because of a previous balance at that address".  First of all, what does the address have to do with anything?  Wouldn't the balance be the PERSON's and not the address'?  But whatever, I have my complex fax a form saying "Yeah, he just moved here in February, bitches." to Comcast.  A week passes, nothing.   Issue #2:  Fax?  What fax?  I call back and they've lost the form, and would like me to fax another one.  I do so.  Another week passes.  I call back, they remember that they should probably go ahead and put through the order, their bad we'll get right on it sir.  I make an installation appointment for 8/14.  Which leads us to:  Issue #3:  Fuck you and your installation appointment.  I sit at the crib from 2-5pm on Saturday waiting for someone to show up, plug in a box, and go home.  It gets around 4:45pm, and I call in to ask politely where in the fuck my technician is.  I get "He's running a little behind, you're next on his list, should be about 15minutes.".  An hour passes.  I call back, still polite.  "Hm, we're not sure where he is, I'll check with the supervisor, please hold." followed by "The supervisor isn't sure where he is, we'll give you a call back after we contact dispatch."  An hour passes.  I call back, fresh out of politeness to inform them either they let me know where the fuck my tech is, when he's coming, AND that my installation cost is free, or they can feel free to cancel my order.  I hear "Well, I don't know what to tell you" before I blank out to blinding fury.  I cancel my order.  Wait, it gets better.  Issue #4:  Give us our money, you low class Detroit bitch.  So I get some broad from the Comcast Detroit office who's curious as to why I canceled my appointment.  I, thinking that the two offices (the call center is apparently located at some undisclosed location high atop the Himalayas, safe from irate customers armed with artillery) have some sort of communication, give her the brief version of my story.  She explains that none of that is in the computer, it just says that I canceled for no reason.  I feel a touch of the fury coming on again, and give her a more fleshed out version of my story.  She comes back with....not concern for my plight, but a deep curiousity as to WHY I HADN'T GIVEN THEM MY SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER.  Turns out that's why she was calling, because there was no soc # on my account.  She also believes that's why my tech didn't show up, because the computer automatically drops any order with no soc #.  Never mind the fact that no one at any point in the process made reference to that.  I told her so as politely as I could (I don't THINK I said motherfucker...I can't be sure).  She spent some time haranguing me about the importance of using the social security number as a unique identifier and blah blah blah.  After explaining to her (in the face of her rising attitude) that I was uninterested in giving my money to a company who was so obviously uninterested in me as a customer, she hung up on me.  Now, it's well known to my friends what I think of Comcast, but I can save the majority of that for another rant.  The bottom line is that I'm a consumer paying for a SERVICE, and it is your job to treat me as such.  What I am NOT is a serf paying tribute to King Comcast for blessing me with cable service.  This isn't my heat or lights we're talking about, it's cable television.  Not to MENTION the practice of getting a customer's social security number has nothing to do with "unique identification" and everything to do with being able to run a customer's credit in order to evaluate risk, and to submit derogatory reports to the credit bureaus should you not pay on time.  Blockbuster tried this same shit, and I'm not going for it, one way or the other.  It doesn't help that I don't remember having to give this information in Ann Arbor; if this is just something they do to further burden my city and my community (like Progressive and their fucking  urlLink redlining ), then that's something I take a serious, serious issue with.  Especially since it's well known what  urlLink specifically  Comcast does with your  urlLink personal information .  29.99 or not, Comcast can go fuck itself.  I'll stick to reading and cheap DVDs until I seriously think about getting satellite.

       Um. Yep. This is my blog. There are many like it, but this one is mine. I may or may not be posting things that may or may not be of interest to some significant or insignificant portion of the population. or I might just spend a lot of time talking about my love of peanut butter.  O Jif! So spreadably creamy So palatably dreamy You are the center of my meal The pleasure of my gastrointestinal tract.  Suffice it to say, that probably won't be the first time I say "gastrointestinal".  OK, I'm out now.
