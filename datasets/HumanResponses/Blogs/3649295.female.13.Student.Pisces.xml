      I have not been able to keep up my blog for the past 3 days due to the Greek festival.  Today is June 15, 2004.  It is the 3rd to last day of school.  The day started out with band, but we didn’t play.  We just sat there and studied for other classes and talked.  For the first 15 minutes or so, Meagan (I found out that this is the way you spell her Meagan) Philip, and I moved boxes close to 40 pounds each.  Then we sat down for 77 minutes.  I went over to Meagan’s seat and we talked and studied.  I tried to find out her AIM screen name, but she doesn’t have AIM.  So at yearbook signing I’m going to ask her for her cell phone number, yes I did fix her cell phone today.  After that we had homeroom.  We finished are really stupid book.  It was called King of Shadows.  Susan Cooper (the author) should be shot for writing such a stupid book.  After that, we played musical chairs, and it was really violent.  I got tackled and winded while playing.  At lunch I DM again nothing interesting happened.  Last period we had P.E, nothing interesting happened, what a boring day.

      Today June 11, 2004, was an exiting day.  The day started out with playing dodge ball in P.E.  I owned everyone! At one point some threw the ball at me. I caught it.  Held it for a while (like 5 seconds) and someone tried to hit me with one I blocked it and threw the ball at him knocking him over.  I was in the zone.  Then after that we had basketball.  We played bump instead.  We started with only six people, and by the end of the third game we had 23.  The people who got out first all got lack of participation points because the game lasted 20 minutes and Ms Jensen thought they weren’t playing because Ms Jensen is a bitch.  After that, I had band and I got to spend some time with Meghan.  All the band did that day was turn in all our music and sight read.  After that I did some service by putting away everything for the end of the year.  I wish that I could spend more time with Meghan, like maybe

      Today 6/10/04 was a great day for me.  Nothing bad happened and no reports or tests were handed back or due.  At lunch we continued playing D&D.  They kept on acting like fools, but we all had fun.  My friend was doing his Test makeup correction sheet while playing.  During the game I rolled for the random monster encounter and it spawned a Blue Dragon.  They got pretty surprised (even though it is only a Wyrmling).  Anyways, my friend (there are 3 people playing D&D with me Nick, who is my friend nick’s sister and Nat who is in my math class) Nick wants me to DM an entire 3-month quest.  That will be a challenge.  But before that something happened in-between my hopeful girlfriend (Meghan Heid).  When we were walking to lunch, I forgot my backpack in the class, so I asked her to wait up for a minute while I went to go and get it.  I didn’t expect her to wait for me, I thought that she would just run off with her other friends, but she waited for me.  During bobcat time, which I stated before that bobcat time is in your homeroom class; I helped her clean out our classroom.  I wonder if I ask her to go out with me if she will.  After school I had to do a makeup test for math.  It ended up being the study guide because my teacher didn’t have enough time to make up a test.  It still took me about 50 minutes, but it wasn’t hard.  After that I came home and jumped in the shower because I had a band concert that night.  Meghan is in band to so I saw her in the concert.  But I only said hi.  Doh!  I should have started to flirt with her. Well I had my chance.

      Today, June 9, 2004, was an interesting day of my life.  Today during Physical Education (P.E) we were going to do the partner run.  Usually we do a bobcat run, which is three laps long to add up to a total amount of 1 1/3 mile.  Anyways the partner run is when one person does 1 lap, your partner does the second, you do the third and your partner finishes it all up with possible extra credit.  Extra credit is achieved by doing extra laps.  But I wanted to do the bobcat run, which gives you and automatic extra credit I started to run the bobcat run I did my first lap in about 3 minutes and she didn’t notice that I was doing the bobcat run.  So I dashed of quickly to do my second lap, did that in about 3:30.  When I came in at the start of my third lap Ms Jensen came up to me and started screaming like a total fucking idiot.  She was saying how I am being defiant by running the bobcat run.  I was just suspended in time I did something that I know am very happy that I did.  I went up to her and gave her my first lap stick (the sticks are like proofs of you actually running) then I started my third lap.  She said it was useless to run and threatened to lower my P.E grade even further but I didn’t care.  I just kept on running.  When I came into start my fourth lap Ms. Jensen said it’s not worth it and I left to do my fourth lap when I came into do my fifth lap I asked for the time and she didn’t tell me the time so I started my fifth lap.  She was screaming where do you think you are going.  But I just kept on running not looking back.  When I came in for my sixth lap the run was over and she had everyone go play basketball, except for me.  She dragged me up and thought I might recant for my actions but I was in rage that she didn’t let me go above and beyond.  I noted the fact that every other coach allows people to do the bobcat run and she honestly tried to deny that she has never heard of that.  She tried to lie to prove her point.  I stated that I am proud for what I have done, and that making me feel bad or just even punishing wont work.  I don’t care if I get suspended it wont matter because at heart I know that I did the right thing and not even bushes legalization of torture will change my mind about that.  So anyways she called my dad and spoke to him about my “rebellious” behavior. After that she asked what my punishement should be and I almost started laughing.  Why would you ask the accused what their punishment should be?  I started to say I don’t know I’m not the teacher in front of her, and boy did she get mad.  Luckily the bell rang and I was free from her grasps for now.  My next class was bobcat time and boy was that stupid, you sit there and read for 45 minutes in your homeroom class.  At least my friend was in my homeroom class.  I guess I should call her a girlfriend, but I have not asked her out.  But we talk and are friendly towards each other.  At lunch I had to go do a makeup bobcat run, which means I ran another mile and a third.  After that I went to my friends and we started playing Dungeons & Dragons (D&D) we started our adventure we only got like 10 minutes in before the bell for last period struck.  I had band last period today and we only played for 45 minutes out of a 90-minute period.  I read my Dungeon Masters Guide since I was the Dungeon Master (DM).
