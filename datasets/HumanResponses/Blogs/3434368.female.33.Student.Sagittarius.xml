      Here's the rest of the harp related sestina poem:  (Note: I thought of two verses on the same ending words-so I will do both of them first):  I'm writing a story about a rainbow. A rabbit and a leprechaun go and play... inside it. The rainbow is more beautiful than the earth. Everyone inside of it is full of love. The rabbit named Katie can play harps. And she sends music to her cousin Sidney in Texas.  (Second version:) Through my eyeglasses I often see a rainbow. The reflections appear through the glass and play... A harmony for all the earth... to hear. The melody is one of love... and not fear. It sings a song of harps.. stringing the music through all the land of Texas.  The rest of the poem:  I've always lived in this great state of Texas. I've seen many beautiful colorful rainbows. I've played many harps... as I see children play. They share their love.. of simple things upon the earth.  This great planet known as "earth" is my home where I live in Texas. I wish to hug and kiss my love... under a big beautiful rainbow... and we can laugh and play... while I pluck my five harps!  Tercet: I love to view beautiful colorful rainbows.. In Texas where I will play.. outside on the earth--my precious harps!  The End :)  Mind Boggling. Someone has asked me the origin of the Sestina. I imagine it is Spanish or Italian. I will have to find out sometime soon. :)

      Hi, Here's the next verse:  My rabbit friend Sidney likes to play. Her heart is full of love. She's my favorite rabbit friend in Texas. She likes to listen to me play my harps. She hops up and down upon the earth. She wants to find a pot of gold at the end of the rainbow!  Next verse words end like this: rainbow play earth love harps Texas  Next verse after that is like this: Texas rainbow harps play love earth  Next verse is this: earth Texas love rainbow play harps  Tercet can vary: rainbow, Texas, harps  (or rainbow, play, harps) on the outside and inside earth, Texas, and love.  Well, if anyone has any ideas--just let me know. Otherwise, I will figure this out tomorrow or another day! :)

      Does anyone know how to write a Sestina? It is kind of complicated, but I am trying to write one right now. It is a six line poem 123456 (each word at the end is used again.)  Anyone way--here's what I got started so far.  I guess it is about harps and other things. I play the harp, so it should be interesting poem:  Harp Sestina Poem My brother says I've owned six harps. I only lay claim to five on this earth. I love to hear harp music play... from Ireland bands to deep in the heart of Texas. Just watch me pluck down a rainbow. And fill the world with love.  What is the meaning of the word love? I meditate on this while I pluck my harp(s). Love is like a beautiful rainbow... It fills the sky and makes us wonder here below on this earth. Love could mean friendship like our State of Texas.. motto. OR we may just really love like Romeo and Juliet in that play.  play love Texas harps earth rainbow  Those are the next words that must end this Sestina set. I think I will go to bed soon and will write more on here later. Maybe, y'all can help me out!   Goodnight :)

Yes, I live in a library. Can you guess what I am? I can tell you about the telephone invention or the Democrat convention.  Yes, I live in a library. Do you need a little hint? I have more than one volume filled with science, people, and places. What am I?  I am an Encyclopedia! Yes, I live in a library. I inform people  who look at my pages. I tell them many stories.

      Hi, I wrote the two poems below in June. I have been very busy with school and I have not had a chance to post on here.  My dad had heart surgery in early June and he's feeling better now, but still struggling because he's not as strong as he use to be. Poor dad. Anyway, he's still alive. That's the important thing. I don't know if he will be able to work again, but he still plans to build another harp or two! :)  Rose Hill   The Sounds of Summer  The singing of the cicadas In my backyard…  The chirping crickets In my grass….  The ribbits of the frogs In my pond…  The barking of the dogs Near my house…  The fighting squirrels On the lawn…  The cats meowing By my side….  The robin’s rounds In the tree…  The silent sounds Of summer too…  The days are here Of summer…  Go enjoy… A singing or silent  Moment or two!  By Rose Hill 6-6-04  Waiting for dad… Waiting in a hospital Waiting for some news..  My father is in the surgery Drugs take over his body…  Mom is worried sick… I try not to be.  Waiting for some news.  Will he pull through? Will he recover? Will he be able to Do the things he use To do?  Will he be able to Work the crossword Puzzle?  And will he be able To make things Like harps  With singing strings?  I hope so. I love my dad.  He’s gotta pull through And fight the good fight. Until his time on earth Is ended.
