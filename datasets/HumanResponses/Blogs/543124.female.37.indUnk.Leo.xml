        Temptation's Fiery   Flames leap and dance licking at my feet it's laughter whipping fiery illusions within my darkened soul. It's crackling whispers... sway with me feel my heat, my desire within your veins let me be the temptation the demise of your purity inhale the plume of smoke riddled with my sin. Fire seduces my very core flames dance within my eyes with a scream of sated sin my soul, my being falls into temptation's fiery feeding my darkened ashes up into the night sky.   © Mary Torres

        Greater Things   In my eyes I see the clarity of dreams so many refuse to see. I believe within my heart the possibilities of happiness whispered quietly to me. For you I feel within my being can be anything that you choose to be. In you there is a flame that will burn eternal on any road your heart seeks. For I know the pounding need of wanting something more and you  are meant for the reality  of greater things.  © Mary Torres

        Stranded High   Stranded high above my own illusions I glance downward towards reality and I conclude that life is better lived with a little silver smoke a glass filled with spirits some good deeds many wicked thoughts books to sharpen the mind hand gestures to keep you fit a mattress to catch you poems to get you laid roses to get you love and lot's of money to keep you stranded high away from your illusions and life's realities.  © Mary Torres I wish I did half these things... alright, I do some but not all  :-)

        Morning Breath   I lay quietly, reflective on the crisp white sheets strewn carelessly on my bed it is early morning as the sun tries to make it's way through my curtained window I am happy, peaceful gently I pull my pillow to me closing my eyes imagining the scent and warmth  of his body upon mine I take breathe, contentedly feeling my heart beat listening with a smile at words fluttering on the wind whispering into my being I rise, thoughtful disheveled in my joy sunlight bathes my skin as I open my curtained window to find him on the breeze I inhale deeply taking love into my soul.  © Mary Torres

        Voices   It's like smelling rain weeks before a drop comes on a hot summer's day. I hear the song floating on the wind singing in my mind telling me to get ready. I feel it's cool caress  on my skin, a soft breathe  of invisible presence as though I'm walking  amidst discarded belongings of people long past. It speaks to me with a knowing of no words with shadowed pictures of what is to come that I don't quite understand until it gets here. Intuition greets me in my sleep in every waking hour pounding at me to decipher... to listen to know what's coming. Again and again it slips through me my mind grasping to understand fate has spoken that change once again stands begging to be heard on this road of humanity and of my life.  © Mary Torres

        My Soul   My soul trembles laughing... crying within this body of mine it dies... it lives spinning on every dime it screams... and yes, it moans with every stroke of love it's wild... sinful beautiful in heaven's eyes it's high... it's low smokes the fumes of life it's gentle... kind listens to every sigh it aches... dreams blue seas my soul trembles living... loving within this body of mine.  © Mary Torres

        Toast of Tears   This glass that I hold within my hands is filled with the blood of my tears. I have bled slowly the first drop blind of those that would follow. The sanctity of my soul trickles with every lie a crimson trail trampled by those that feed upon my heart. I raise my glass filled with the essence of my being. A toast for all those who have picked the flowers failing to leave a seed. Today we drink from this glass within my hands the last of my tears. For tomorrow my tear stained glass shall be filled with the blood  of  the souls that bled me. Raise the glass and drink today for vengeance is mine.  © Mary Torres

        Fair Heart   Oh, fair heart... that beats a red sun in pure blue of skies hear this daydreamers plea scratching at her canvas with ink crackled dry.  The moon has failed to rise!  Drought has taken visions parching this poets soul of humble meaningless verse.  Whom do I beg to delight?  A scrap of pity is all I ask to cure a desolate barren prairie void of beautiful flowers and vines.  Give me but a morsel... feed this canvas of mine.  Oh, fair heart... hear me now!  © Mary Torres

        The Sign Says Closed   My heart  has lost it's whisper I sent it to my love with a message of eternity but the sign said  closed when it reached the door... if by fate you come across it please send it home where the  door to my heart is always open.  © Mary Torres

        First Love   The years speak vividly in this one quiet moment from a distance of time and many miles your smile, your eyes take me back with a sigh I remember our laughs songs you would serenade the first kiss you sent to me on the wind of your palm youthful was our love exchanged was our hearts with just a gaze fate was understood I see you now in this photograph a boy now a grown man with a child of your own my heart swells once again with love and happiness knowing that my first love found his place in life and light in his purpose.  © Mary Torres

        Happy New Year!   And so again it falls upon us promises made with purpose goals of pure zest days of a year made in reflection while a glittering ball rises to say hello to all that is new some will cry others will laugh many will celebrate with love and all will look back to what was while with deep bated breathe hope for the best in this new year and so it falls upon us again another chance of years past to fulfill fancy forgotten resolutions promises made with purpose and goals of pure zest in the end the glittering ball will rise once more in celebration and I for one along with others will say thank you for my life for my freedom for doing the best I could do and for the people like myself who never quite finish those promises yet stand with hopeful open hearts and those that actually do I say to you live with knowledge and faith live with compassion and kindness live with strength and courage live with purpose and love and have a Happy New Year!  © Mary Torres

        Garden Behind The Wall   Framed by sturdy walls once more the door closes flowers will still smile  with vibrant colors sunlight will still glisten on early morning dew and the birds will still sing joyously in their trees dreams will also still exist when the moon dances amongst the glittering stars all this beauty and love shall endure behind walls that frame my closing door and someday when kindness rather than impudence  seeks entrance to the garden behind the closed door it will be then the walls will crumble and the key lost to a forever open door.  © Mary Torres

        Silent Calling   It takes but a whisper a thought a calling from some wondrous invisible place I cannot see or touch to feel you wanting me loving me feeling for me breathing with me. In the darkness I feel the heavy ache of your desire pressing against my soul cradling me making love to me on a bed where I lay alone. Soft spoken silent are your words that echo reverberate within my being without sound sigh that I hear you distant in your miles as you lay unseen next to me.  © Mary Torres

        Fumes    Inhale deeply, fill your insides with the fumes of life. Ride the wave that takes you up and down, all around. Stagger, straddle the line to the nearest hotel. Smile to passersby who know your just a little high. Smell it, taste it let it roll off your tongue. Oh sweetness, almighty go ahead take another hit. Feel rippling desire smoldering in its acidic fire. Make love, spread your seed save just a little for me. Roll it, smoke it show them how it's done. Intoxicate your soul feed your passion under the sun. Fear has no place in this high kiss inhibitions goodbye. Inhale deeply, fill your insides with the fumes of life.  © Mary Torres

        The Heavens Speak   The heavens speak  on this clear ebony night to those who choose ponder. Shooting stars give signs to lover's and gambler's of life showing roads of love and fate.  The moon in full luminous mystery plays puppetry on the minds coercing the hidden eccentricities of the most sane into laughter. The ebony of night itself where karma ceases to exist seems as though a being greater than any sits silently hidden watching life endure in it's microscopic existence. This heavenly night so beautiful simplified to the human mind with wishing stars and lucky charms reminds those who ponder upon the vast endless universe that we are but newborn infants to the worlds and possibilities beyond our sight and touch.  © Mary Torres

        My Poet   You are my beauty  the love of my heart a sigh of wonder my souls completion You are the color that paints my canvas words that dream my imagination to fly You are the whisper that comes of my pen melodies of stories to live and awaken You are the light in the valley of mist life that grows from seed to tree You are my love heartbeat of my prose verse to my thoughts you are my poet.  © Mary Torres 01/2003

        The Poet   I see love in the valley of mist A radiant light glows in all that is true Amidst the flowers that grow of serene colour The poet sits upon a fallen tree Head bowed down he lives within his thoughts A world spins of fantastic dreams Sweet melodies echo birds scatter in flight Pen held tightly words come to life A canvas of white sits upon his lap An explosion of colour in one small black line Word after word a story is born Upon the last drop of ink he finishes in time The poet stands  upon his fallen tree Softly and quietly recites his words Never a dream from which to awaken Folds his book tucks away his pen For all that is imagined in the valley of mist For only the poet brings it to life.  © Mary Torres  02/2000

        Burning Freedom   Burning freedom cries a river flooding my very soul sun induced hallucinations drag me down  never ending roads. Tattooed dreams line the insides of my skin painting pictures of places never been. Primitive callings scream from this darkened solitude wild that I am chaotic nature understood. High is my mind inhaling the fumes of life take me as I am or say your good bye. Burning freedom the essence of my soul cries a river on which my life flows.  © Mary Torres

        The Bones   Brittle and dry artifacts of yesterday that is all left to pick at imagination  and memories will be misconstrued when those who  find them buried  try to reconstruct lies from truth for it is easier  to create and embrace a facade of beautiful false love than to rattle around in the bones of a heart buried in love's cemetery.  © Mary Torres

        Unrelinquished Love   Sometimes I wonder what would be at this very moment if I had just loved you they way I should have loved you all those years ago if I had just allowed myself to fall into your arms and dive into the warm loving gaze you so readily shined upon me if I sang with you when you sang to me where would we be what would this moment be living of only love had been free perhaps it is this  the unrelinquished love that makes me wonder  if we were ever  really meant to be.  © Mary Torres

       Heaven's Door   For a brief moment time stood still no sounds no movements all that was beat softly quietly in my chest I felt my heart and it was filled with love so many faces so much sorrow the goodbyes heavy I wondered if my soul could hold the memories or would they fade with my light I stood there too early for my time face to face with mortality with my goodness and my sins waiting to know if He was ready for me for a brief moment I discovered life it's meaning as I stood not ready at Heaven's door.  © Mary Torres

       A Heart's Letter   I strolled the fine lines the delicate curves rode on every sudden flair my heart pounded as fingertips caressed the smooth plain of this antiquated art. With every step he lifted my heart into his beautiful world I sighed with love he captured me. Slower I strode not wanting to finish the ink glinted new under the sunlight the words poetic  classic in it's courting. I inhaled deeply this old era once lost as I held his love letter deep and near my heart.  © Mary Torres

       Outlaw Rose   Between the cracks the saw dust and tears a seed fell by chance lodging itself stubbornly into my broken heart. It bloomed of course against my wishes it's red delicate beauty forcing sun to cast light on desolate surroundings. I tried to name it put a face on it's petals but it refused to answer turning in defiance to all suggestions spoken. Love began to grow for this outlaw of a rose it's home began to heal saw dust found the wind cracks mended wisely tears flowed for happiness. After many days I longed for the name of this grand beauty planted within my heart so I asked quietly 'how much more time?' With that the little outlaw lifted it's petals high extending love to my eyes I realized just then this blessed rose was Time.  © Mary Torres
