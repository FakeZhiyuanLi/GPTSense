      What do you get when you mix 200mg of Celebrex with 1000mg of aspirin plus Tamgent? You got it! An overdose! My mother turned into Judy Garland last night. She had heartburn from chicken and decided to take aspirin to get rid of a headache. OOPPS! Don't worry, she's fine. I am the family doctor. Not that I carry around a degree or anything, but I think I know more than the doctors since they almost killed me three years ago. It's annoying how I don't forget these things. ANYWAY, I did watch City of God and highly recommend the film. I also saw In America and I have to say, I guess I'm the Grinch because I didn't like this film at all, it was too inconsistent and altogether lame.  That film tried to make me cry and I guess I'm made out of stone.  OH WELL.  And here's an idea.  If a film takes place in 1982, (I'm talking of In America), in NYC, please when one gets to Times Square, don't have Mama Mia! playing at the Winter Garden.  Cats was there in '82, right after Othello.  Thanks director!

      OH NO!&nbsp; Who the hell wants to watch the pageant now?&nbsp; The talent portion is axed?&nbsp; NO NO NO!!!&nbsp; The ratings are going down, down, down.&nbsp; That was the best part besides the bathing suits.&nbsp; Shame on the committee, shame on ABC.&nbsp; And I still LOVE you Peter Krause even though you bombed on Broadway!&nbsp; I watched Guiding Light, Harely found out about Gus, uh oh.&nbsp; Now, All My Children time.&nbsp; I must sit and be subjected to Bianca in her "Everyone has sex but me because I'm gay" bit.&nbsp; The power of standards and practices goes way beyond my little hands.

      I thought that speech by Kerry was very good.&nbsp; I heard it through my sleep.&nbsp; The polls are in Kerry's favor now, but wait the GOP will be all over my city, (NYC that is), I will be hiding in my room.&nbsp; It amazes me how no one concentrates on Bush and his lies, but we have to talk about Kerry's wife's comments, "shove it!"&nbsp; You know what?&nbsp; A lot of people should.&nbsp; People from Fox News should start first.&nbsp; I like a first lady who knows more than to shake her head at the right moments.&nbsp; This one at least knows more than one language.&nbsp; And no one should comment on Kerry and his money.&nbsp; How much money does Bush have?&nbsp; Even Ron Regan is going to the "other side."&nbsp; He's probably trying to make up for the horror of a mess his father made during the early years of the AIDS crisis.&nbsp; I just can't wait for the debate between Kerry and Bush.&nbsp; No, Edwards and Cheney!&nbsp; That should be better!&nbsp; I don't care if Kerry&nbsp;"flip-flops."&nbsp; Like he said, nothing is black and white and think about what Bush did to all of the servicemen in this country.&nbsp; Ok, you all know I'm liberal.&nbsp; You have to be if you're gay.&nbsp; The Log Cabin republicans?&nbsp; Don't make me laugh.&nbsp; Single Issues, shut up.&nbsp; SIGH.&nbsp; ANYWAY, today I will wash my little dog Pipa, my teacup poodle and probably watch "City of God."&nbsp; I will watch Guiding Light and find out why Dinah came back into town and if Harley breaks the wedding off with Gus, most likely so.&nbsp; What?&nbsp; So I watch soaps.&nbsp; It fills my days when I don't want to think.&nbsp; Now I must be off, my dog is chewing on a razor that someone dropped.&nbsp; Unless she wants to shave her tounge, it isn't a good idea.

      This is my first posting and let's see if I can make it fine.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; HI!&nbsp; My name is Melissa but most call me Mel.&nbsp; I'm 25 and have been going to college so long they should pay me.&nbsp; I have three dogs because I seemed to have over done it since my former dog died.&nbsp; This blog I created because so many of you out there have said I should put my thoughts in writing, well, here I am.&nbsp; My first thought?&nbsp; Kirste Alley gained all this weight so she can have a show to lose it.&nbsp; My other thought?&nbsp; Kerry should not be President, Edwards should.&nbsp; Kerry is too boring and his face looks like it's going to run.&nbsp; I don't know if I want to stare at that for four years.&nbsp; Bush?&nbsp; HA!&nbsp; Four more years of that and I really will go into a coma.&nbsp; I had a breakdown the first time he was elected.&nbsp; Last week I heard from someone that the world is a narrow-minded place.&nbsp; I felt like screaming it isn't, it's just that too many are self-absorbed and too much in a hurray to enjoy and understand.&nbsp; I think that's it for today.&nbsp; Join me tomorrow for another adventure.

      Peter, Paul and Mary were awesome! They sang and I clapped. They cheered out in protest and I screamed. Then I went home and noticed there was something wrong with my foot. It seemed not all right. Bruised even. I stuck it out and went on with my daily life. Well, turns out that was wrong because I have a sprain. Yes, a sprain from a chair. Thank you Westbury Music Fair! In my week of lying like a loaf of bread, I saw the governor of New Jersey step down because he does not want the media rumor attention of being GAY run all over his office. I say not true, something happened..blackmail I think and will stick with. While listening to this, I went to get my father his pills at CVS with my limp and what did I find out? The insurance company he deals with will not approve his pills because they think he could take something else. These people are not doctors, they just want to keep down costs. Last time I looked a representative is not a doctor. A doctor isn't even a doctor anymore. But, it all has to do with the chemicals in the brain and one person will react to one med and not the other. Right? That's what one learns in high school biology. President Bush, are you paying attention here? I think I'll go across the border to Canada when my foot heals? Who is with me?!

      Now, people who know me know that I usually complain, but here on this blog, no one does. So, I will introduce another side of myself. I just found out that Caroline or Change and Frozen are closing due to costs, most of which are coming from Republicans who receive free tickets when they are here in the city, (NYC that is). Can they not afford their own? Can Bush or Arnold not splurge a little and let the moths out of their wallets? That is the last straw as far as I am concerned. They can run around playing with the Constitution all they want, they can probe people up whatever. That has been going on for over 200 years. But when Broadway shows, which should stay open, (especially Caroline), are closed due to poor ticket sales only furthered by free tickets...well..that's it! Another complaint I have is of the cards we buy in the store. I went to get one for my mom, (her birthday was yesterday), and I came across such horrible ones and quickly walked out. Why do we have to press the age issue so much? Can we not think of anything else to say anymore? Here's one last complaint before I leave..I was watching old episodes of Mr. Rogers. Even though, the man put all children of Gen X in a fantasy world because things of concern such as bringing a truck to school and the teacher not taking said truck away from the student does not happen in the "real world," It was good to watch because it taught patience and respect as does Sesame Street. I then turned on to compare this to Barney and Friends, (granted ten years in the making but still relevant to these times). I really didn't like this show when taking an objective look at it. The songs sound like so many others and the children are too rehearsed. In this case, I'm going against the grain, I'd rather be green, it's not that hard Kermit. Wait, I thought of one other thing, (see how much I complain?), I was watching CNN which took a look at all the drugs and you know what? We are all turning into kids with toys or things in cereal boxes. The "I want that" mentally is kind of bad and we have to stop this. Forget all of those ads that were put into circulation in 1997! Come on people! Turn off that TV! Or don't listen! There are many ads telling us we are sick, but that's just because more than half of all Americans are over 50, blame the baby boomers! Some people need meds, (me), but some don't and YES we all have to watch the doctors, but we won't dance like those actors do in the ads. Listen to the side effects as they are dancing. Oh wait! Low Carb sucks, (follow the pyramid of foods), I didn't jump on that train and lost 13 lbs. so far. I'm not a horse and it took me a bit longer, but I did it. AND...put The Boy From Oz on DVD. MORE MONEY FOR EVERYONE! Now, I will go, I am seeing Peter, Paul and Mary tonight and LOVE them. An influence from my hippie mom.

      I forgot to mention. I don't know if anyone knows, (and I'm sure all the lesbians have the notice), The L Word will be released on November 9th 2004. This is one day before my birthday and I will purchase said product. Now, before all of you out there who hate The L Word because it is not an accurate look at lesbian life. Let me counter by saying a few words. First, unlike those men who say they read Playboy just for the letters, I admit I watch The L Word strictly for the porn. Those women scare me sometimes and half of them I would never get involved with except for a one night, (yes the big talker I am). Second, this is a soap opera. When watching regular soap operas do you think these things really happen? I mean how many people do you know come back from the dead? Or how many people do you know have a child in 1990 who is 25 in 2004? Not many. How many people can afford those houses? Even Sex and The City, come on. But, we still watch that. Third, this is done by the same women who developed Go Fish, Rose Trouche and Guinevere Turner. They were praised 10 yrs. ago for the raw look at lesbian life. So I say, bring on the lesbians and thank you Ellen!

      I was just about to drive my mom over to the bank and I received my mail.  As you all know I do business over amazon.com. Well, I recently sold a copy of Harriet the Spy. It was in fine condition when sold. To my surprise I got a letter telling my I would be reported if I sell poor quality merchandise. I put the tape in my VCR and it was fine. First I thought this person was crazy because she comes from Missouri and we all know what happened in that state yesterday.  God forbid gay people get married, we might all save this country from debt.  So, I called and complained to the main amazon.com branch and refunded the money, (which this person did not ask for).  This person is still crazy, I know.  But, she probably wanted to watch the VHS and then return it...whatever.  Other than that I found out Edie Falco had breast cancer, which is the reason for the short hair.  I met her once and she is a very nice person.  I am looking forward to seeing her on Broadway with the very talented Brenda Blethyn.  Right now, I'm waiting for Mario Cantone in Laugh Whore.  I saw this two years ago and almost peed in my pants, the man is funny, deserved a Tony and is extremely funny and too nice, I love him, I want to adopt him!  I told him so...LOL!  Ok, that's enough, I have go clean out my dogs ears, they are turning like grade old cheese.

      Can I ask something?  Why do you have to beg someone to take your money?  We called a lawyer because we are currently looking for someone to help my parents write a will.  The lawyer called back right away, (we were under a false sense of security), and said he was sending us information to fill out.  That was a week ago, what happened?  Now, I'm looking up other lawyers.  I want a big butch to take care of things.  That would be my choice.  Whatever!  I'm going to eat.  This is why I take medication.

      When his star fell, it was sad. Mr. Dean is very cool! GO DEAN GO!!!! Thank you for being a politician that actually says something with a grain of truth! Anyway, I forgot to tell you all that while I was waiting for my father to see a doctor at the ER, I saw a peacock. This was in the middle of a rant because my father had gone inside and no one would let me go inside with him. Even though my father asked for me. Some hospital...I was talking about how gay and lesbians fight to go into the ER and make decisions. I felt like Ellen in that episode of her old show. She tried to get into the ER when her girlfriend was in a car accident. You know that one with Anne Heche..that's the one. I kept trying to go through the doors. I had to then drive back to my house and bring in the BIG guns: MY MOM. They wouldn't let her in either until she was confirmed by my father. Some hospital, this while friends of a kid who had his privates sliced in an extreme game stunt were going in and out to see him. After that speech, yes, I saw a peacock. It was a very colorful male one that was walking around outside. I wondered why no one else was impressed. Then I began to think maybe I was the loon and should check myself into the inpatient ward for mental health. But, alas, my mom saw it also as I drove up, (my second trip to the ER). That was some moment. I saw peacocks in the zoo, but never in front of me walking down the street. As far as today. I watched Guiding Light and missed 15 minutes of it which made me come to an important decision. Any politican who interupts my very favorite soap, I will not vote for. Nope, not a chance. I especially hate the reporters who have to analyze after. Everyone should shut up. I think America news programs are way too alarming. I was watched the BBC and almost fell asleep because it was so boring, that's how conditioned I am to American news and the 24/7 channels. For once I think Bill O'Reilly should take the blame.

      When my dogs, (and I have three), go to the vet, she gives them a shot if they hurt their knees.  When humans have the same problem, they go to the doctor and the trouble begins.  This weekend my father went because he pulled a muscle when doing exercises the chirpractor gave him, (another word for dumb).  His whole knee blew up.  The doctors have no idea where it came from and won't comment.  We then went to CVS to fill his pills and because of this great country NOT having a health care plan, (who cares about paying more taxes?  I'd rather have my health and meds), he had to pay out of pocket and get this, he is an insurance agent.  Although he is much better, I am tired from having to drive him around.  This gives me a new respect for cab drivers.  So, now instead of seeing the chiropractor, I went out to Linen 'n Things and bought a shiatsu massaging cushion.  It works the same way.  Case closed.  Now, I'm going to go to sleep because I have not gotten any in two days.  This is after I watch k.d. lang on the Today Show.  But, before, all of you out there buying from me on amazon.com, please, I do not bite, if there is a problem with the tape, email me for a full refund.
