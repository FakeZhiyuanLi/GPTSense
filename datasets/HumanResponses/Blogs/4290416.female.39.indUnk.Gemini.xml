      Do you ever go strange? You're going along, everything is feeling good and BAM, you feel like scum of the earth. No one has said anything particularily bad to you....but there it is..... you calling yourself down. Like tonight, had a nice day with my husband, went out for dinner to a nice restaurant...had a good mean (seafood mmmmmmmmmmm), went to a movie (stupid movie..... Dodgeball..... need I say more.....) and I'm feelin' like a loser. I guess it's cause I'm havin' a tough time at my new job and I feel I should have everything under control after 4 days cause the pay is so low. I think I have some brain restructuring to do. Where DO we get these perceptions?Tomorrow is a new day...a 7 hour shift and work pants that ride up my ass. Lovely.this doesn't last long, thank god.  C

      Ever have a restless night?  I love getting up in early in the morning, but when I think too much, I'm up til 4, 4:30, 5 .... I usually allow myself, cause sometimes, if you have the next day off, you can stay up and visit with people that you normally don't see.  You can write in your journal perhaps... watch late late late late night TV etc etc.  The bad thing is when you wake up late (for me that's around 9:30 am now....what's with that????? That's sleeping in when you are closing in on 40 or what??????)   ANYHOW, that's what I've done.  It's 10:30am and I've showered and sat at the puter and ever so briefly spoken to my husband about this stupid game we're both hooked on, ZUMA.... I think I'm going to write a book as to how Zuma is unwinnable and might wreck relationships should it go that far.  ON to far more important things.  When I joined curves about 1.5 months ago (a woman's circuit gym...I quite like it actually), I weighed in pretty heavy...can't remember what I did weight in at, but I know that in the last 2 months I've weighed 319.5 lbs..... anyhow, I was 314 this morning.  I think all the sweating working at the mother of all fast food chains is assisting me, actually on many levels.  It's actually pressing me..... the counter, dealing with people who have no considerations to people who have done similar jobs and have patience for the learning curve.  I have a trouble with remembering the customer is right when you know that they are trying to rip  you off for a soft drink or something.   I have to run out now.  Doug (my husband) and I have a day off together and frankly, I think far too much and really want to go out with him and take a look around this beautiful place I live.  Vancouver Island is truly a sacred place...not mine...but sacred.... if you haven't been here, you need to look around it.  Chins up, bums in kittens.  Don't stop learning and believing.

      It is humbling working for a fast food restaurant at 39 years old.  Humbling, freeing and a little taxing.  Parts of me remember how old I am even though my brain usually does not.  I can always remember my Grandmother, on her 85th birthday....that would have made me 25....I asked her what it "felt" like to be 85 and she said she didn't feel any different than she did when she was 16 except her body had changed slightly :)  I sure do miss my grandma.  Very likeable woman.  I'll have to get a picture of her on here.....that's a plan!  Anyhow, I am the queen of french fries, definately not the master of the companies infernal cash register.  Working with teenagers is exhilerating.  It's amazing how nice these kids are :)  the place spawns warm feelings by making it your duty to assist one another to a common goal.  Something to learn from this?  I believe so.  The other thing I am finding a little easier some days than others, is being directed and corrected constantly....whether I need it or not.  It's an interesting concept that I'm not fighting as much as I initially anticipated.  I think that everyone should have to work at a fast food restaurant at least 1 week per year.  Might keep us all a little more intune.  My house has been crazy messy for about a week, but my constant and ever loving husband made the move this morning and we began rearrangeing what I had initially started.  The family room is still in disarray, but now it has the components of a computer/hobby room with the old stereo in here.  I'll start sorting tomorrow.  The living room is crowed but comfie with the tv back in there and the spare rooms are coming along.  We have a tenant staying with us....a friend from the interior who is slowly working to bring his family out once their house sells in his place of origin.  He LOVES the ocean..... I can totally understand the addiction, I don't think that I will leave this amazing coast for more than a few weeks holiday again...unless of course I live on a boat, and then, it would be my front yard that I wouldn't have to mow.  What a nice thought hey????  I have to go pee, don't move, more rambling to come! :)  hey, you're still here....great!  I haven't put you to  sleep.  What a fucking great day!  Anyhow, the job is making me realize that I can not stay at this weight.  I mean, I've 'realized' that being this overweight is not good....but having to physically be active in a hot place for hours at a stretch.....well..... I mean it really drives the point home.  I'm going to report daily to this here blog..... I"m going to say what is on my mind and hope that I get replies, confirmations or whatever.  Share a story with me about what you are working on, tell me your success' and tell me your trouble spots.  Let's share shall we?  Let's be a team, let's correct thinking and teach each other what we know.  We're all on the same team aren't we?  I believe that we all want a happy fullfilled life.  Everyone but mass murderers...... they seem to just want to put people out of their miseries.  Maybe I've been watching to many cold case files on tv?  That's quite possible.  Share your goals.  What are you working on right now?  You going for a house? a car? a new job? a new craft?  What's your dreams and ambitions?  okay...I've had about enough rambling.  more tomorrow :)  *kisses and hugs* C

      I'm feeling like a cross between Phylis Diller and Sting.  Can you see where my conflict might arise?????  Monette has shown me the blog-light and I am thinking hey, how else can people really get to know you.
