After dinner, felt very hm..sticky..haha..so went to take a shower. After shower decided to do a lil bit washing...hey! no mosquitoes attack this time..haha..what a luck..well..usually there will be 4 or 5 mosquitoes attacking me..maybe my blood is too sweet or they like me very much.i dont know...haha..just feeling glad.  After studying..hehe..actually not much studying..just read a few interesting articles in the econ text. practise the violin!! haha..like to play the grade 2's pieces la..its easy..haha..just imagine that if i dont practise the scales..wonder what would the teacher do..poke me with the fiddle to death..haha..  hm..soon it would be ch's 18th birthday!!haha..still remember that the last time i went back to kulai she asked me to air-mailed her present to her..and to her request, i acted like i hadnt heard it..haha..well..dont even knows what she wants. Actually, i know la..but hehe..those things cost a "fortune" to buy..haha..buying animes in big quantities..theres also hanazawa lui la..hehe..but i dont know where to find him..hm..the college is so big..maybe i can find someone with the same personality as lui and drag him back to kulai with me...haha..sounds like kidnapping to me.  hm..boring la...so many class tomorrow..*Zzzzzzz*

      During LAN class, i was paying only half of attention cuz being in the air-conditioned lecture hall and having cold the same time really made me uncomfortable. And we have quiz 2 today!! good thing i didnt leave in the middle of the class. The lecuturer was on his usual way...the bullet-train style of lecturing..thats very fast.  After Lan, went to buy my lunch and some medication for my throat and cold. The medicine for cold looks more like poison if u ask me. Having white, pink and orange granules in the capsules. Reminds me of the medicine that mom gave me the last time i had cold and i even asked mom if its poisonous..haha..of course after i took it..the next day, i was my own self again...ok, just hope that tomorrow i would be ok.   Friend asked if i want to go swimming, i said no cuz the only place i wanted to be is on my bed..not in the swimming pool although it would be fun to go swimming..haha..theres always next week.  ok, had my lunch, read the newspaper(havent finished it actually)..now im feeling sleepy..haha..and the weather is damned hot out there. Theres a lil bit of rain yesterday..but its not even enough to wet the whole floor outside my room.  Oh...very bored now..should i study now? sleep? hm....thats a very tough decision..have to think properly..haha..

      Finally..finished doing the laundry, now..savouring my breakfast. Hm..shouldnt have wake up so late today..cuz if wake up early, can do a bit studying or just practise violin. *sigh* another hour to go b4 LAN class..so boring. Hm..just feeling bad right now, maybe because of the things that i said yesterday night to bf or its just my cold that are driving me crazy. Hey, i wont want him to say those things to me either..he must be really mad at me. Maybe its just my bad mood that made me wanted to drive him angry deliberately. I admit, thats very stupid of me..mood swing....:(
