       It was the 14th of February - the television, newspapers, magazines and shop fronts had been declaring it "The day for love and lovers'" for the past month or more. Arianna was somewhat sceptical of all the hype, and from her first hand experience of it earlier in the day, she felt she had reason to feel a little jaded.    No Valentine's cards from the 'tasty' Barry Orson, (despite her having watched him from a distance for the past 6 weeks); her only suitor had been Martin Evans: who, by her estimation, rated somewhere below Elmo (aka the Sesame Street character muppet) as the person she would most like to see at her door on this 'day for romance'. To be fair, Martin had gone to the trouble of wetting his strawberry-blonde hair down with a comb and putting on his best (beige-coloured) suit before arriving on her parent's doorstep after 4pm.  So there it was he stood, with a mixed look of dread and anticipation on his pale features as he proffered her a tidy bunch of pink and white carnations, his pasty hands trembling. "I - I was wondering if you would like to be my date to the Senior Dance next Friday," he managed to say to her, the nervousness rife in his reedy voice. Arianna carefully took the flowers, not sure how to deal with the situation. She looked at him for a few moments, then she said "Look; it's a nice gesture and all that, but I've already agreed to go with some of my gal friends." Martin found his resolve (briefly, at least) and sputtered out, “Well, I could give you a ride there - my Mum can, that is - so you could go with me...". His grey-coloured eyes looked at her beseechingly, almost puppy-like in their intensity.  Arianna looked thoughtfully at the flowers in her hands for several seconds; wondering how to refuse, politely. "Ahh, Martin... I kind of think that would be a problem for me. I'll give you a dance and all that, because the flowers were really thoughtful. But I've already got a ride there, okay?". She gave him a breif smile, and he nodded his head slowly, his liberally freckled cheeks slowly reddening, as his pale eyebrows almost knitted together in an intense-looking frown. “I’m sorry, Martin...” she offerred, feeling rather awkward about the whole situation by then.  Sheepishly, Martin had turned to go; until he had remembered something else - and pulled a small pink envelope out of his front pocket. "I... was going to give you this. I guess I'll see you on the night, then, Arianna." She had taken the envelope; and said a perfunctory thankyou to his retreating back, as he had quickly made his way down the stairs, to the car waiting at the end of the driveway. Before she returned indoors, she saw Martin’s mother opening the drivers’ side door, saying something to him as she popped her head out over it, looking very concerned for him. Arianna tried not to think about it.  Several minutes later, she'd actually opened the small envelope; and found a very sweet little Valentine's card. A pang of guilt had twinged at her after she'd read the equally sweet message in it; and she'd hoped she hadn't offended the guy. After all, it wasn't his fault he just wasn't 'her type'. Sighing loudly, she walked over to the open kitchen door; time to help her mother get the food prepared for the family’s dinner.  *                Arianna wiped down the last plate and put it away in the cupboard, her mind drifting along on an abstract train of thought. Not surprisingly, she was somewhat startled when the 'phone rang - so after collecting herself, she put the towel down on the nearby sink benchtop, then walked over and answered it. "Hello - Holt Mental Hospital", she said into the receiver. “And hi to you, too, Ari", came the voice at the other end - her older sister, 19 year old Vania. "Hi yourself, Vin - To what do we owe the honour of this 'call?" Arianna asked. "Thanks for the warm welcome”, Vania replied, the amusement obvious in her voice. “I wanted to talk with you, anyhow, to see if you were interested in partying tonight. There's a bit of a do going on at Anthony's place in Paekok; so Greg and I were wondering if you might like to come along , since it's a Friday night and all that,” she explained.  ‘Typical Vania’, thought Arianna; it was a common occurance for her older sister to 'call up on the spur of the moment and ask her out somewhere. Since Vania had been flatting in town, she and her boyfriend Greg had often asked her along for company. She didn’t mind it at all; Vania always seemed to have something fun for them to all go to.  "Ahh, I dunno, Vin - Mum and Dad reckon I should get into a good study habits: exam year, and all that -" Arianna began. "There'll be some really yummy guys there..." Vania added,her voice almost purring. "Well, if you put it like that... Okay! Yeah, sure- I'd like to go. But I'd better ask Mum and Dad first", Arianna said. "Fine - you do that. Tell them we'll have you home by midnight, so you won't turn into a pumpkin!" joked Vania, finishing with a dramatic laugh.  Smiling, Arianna put the receiver down on the wooden side-bench, before heading down the hallway, to the lounge room. She could hear the sound of the 6.30pm television news blaring through the half-open doorway; loudly documenting the famine in Ethiopia.  Cautiously, she stuck her head around the varnished-wood door. She could see her mother sitting down in the brown-coloured easy-chair, busily putting together the final third of yet another 1000-piece jigsaw puzzle, almost peering over her spectacles in an effort to discern the pieces matching colours; it looked very complex, the picture thus far a rainbow of tiny flowers by a row of identical-looking pastel-coloured houses. The ongoing nature of her mother’s hobby was reflected by the sizable stack of used puzzle-boxes on top of the narrow side table.  Arianna shifted her gaze, to where her father sat comfortably on the far seat of the matching brown velour sofa. His large hazel-coloured eyes seemed to be fixed to the TV screen, his couduroy trouser-clad legs tapering out to where his slippered feet stuck out past the small coffee table. The daily newspaper was loosely sitting on it, a few of the central feature pages threatening to spill out on to the pale grey carpet.  The television ads came on, and Arianna took th opportunity to walk into the room; she busied herself straightening the ‘paper back onto the coffee table. "Ahh - Mum, Dad”, Arianna began, "Vania’s on the 'phone. She and Greg have asked me along to a quiet party. She said she'll get me home by midnight." Her mother lowered the pieces of puzzle she was holding, and looked over at Arianna, her mouth pursed in thought. “Did she say whether or not there will be any parents to supervise things?". "I think Anthony's parents will be there, as it's at their place", Arianna replied, though it was clear that she was not very sure of her answer. Her mother gave her a probing look; then she sighed. “Ahh, yes... I suppose you can go; just make sure Vania ‘phones us if you’re going to be later than midnight”. Her Dad added, “Be home by 11.30pm." Arianna nodded in agreement, and walked casually to the door.  Once she had closed the lounge door, she raced back into the kitchen, and told Vania over the 'phone. "Good one! See you in an hour then, Ari," finished Vania. "See you then!" Arianna enthused, “Bye for now." After putting the 'phone back on the hook, she rushed down the hallway to her bedroom, excitedly muttering, “What will I wear?".  *                Arianna was standing in front of the bathroom mirror, adding the final touches to her eyeliner, when she heard the distinctive rattle of Greg’s Morris Minor making its’ way up the steep driveway outside. As she replaced the lid on the pencil, the tooting of a strangled-cat sounding car horn confirmed her suspicions. She made it to the front door just as Vania turned the handle. “You made it!”, Arianna enthused. “You look great; that outfit is brilliant!”. Her complement was recieved with a flourish from her sister.  Vania turned full circle in the narrow hallway, lifting the edges of her jacket as she did so. Although the elder sister, she was a couple of inches shorter than Arianna; but she had the feminine build and narrow waist that Arianna often envied. Vania’s close-cropped thick hair was dyed a rich auburn; the culottes, tailored jacket and matching pumps she wore were all of a similar hue, with a deep red accent. She had matched the make-up perfectly; the copper eyeshadow making Vania’s hazel-coloured eyes look almost cat-like in their intensity, her lips a deep matte red.  “Damn sheik”, Arianna continued, genuinely imperessed at her sister’s obvious sense of style. “Yeah, pretty groovy, eh? Made the outfit myself. Took ages to get the hem straight on the Elna!”.  The sisters then walked over to the lounge, to say a passing farewell to their parents. However, once they got there, their Mum insisted on catching up with the goings on in Vania’s life. (“Afterall,” Mrs Holt had reasonably reminded them, “I haven’t seen you for over a fortnight, Vania...”).  Nearly three quarters of an hour later, Arianna was in the back of Greg's dark green Morris Minor, with Vania in the navigator's seat, giving Greg the directions as he started the 30 minute drive out to Paekakiriki.  As it had turned out, Anthony had a granny-flat of his own, quite a distance from his parent's house; as they managed the local motel. So, the teenagers pretty much had the run of the party to themselves. And, for the dozen or so 15 to 19 year olds who came, there was a lot of hard liquor around!  Vania and Greg had introduced Arianna to "the guys" (and they were all guys, too; so Arianna was 'impressed'). They were all Greg's old schoolmates, from Rongotai College - a boy's only school - and apart from Anthony, the group included names like Ben, Peter, Ted and Craig. They were all well on their way to drunken oblivion - and it was only 9pm! Arianna found that aspect rather daunting; but as she was unsure of male-bonding etiquette, she assumed that a room full of ‘blokes’ must do that sort of thing if they're supposed to be 'partying'.  The three of them were standing outside on a wooden patio, having a cigarette each. They stood quietly for a few minutes; perhaps watching as the smoke trailed upwards, looking like thin wisps of grey mist against the darkening evening sky. The concrete steps off the porch lead down to private grass-covered courtyard, large enough to comfortably contain several large willow trees along it’s fence-line, and a 4-person sized trampoline, with several square metres of lawn still clear to the front of it.  "So, any guy interest you?", Vania asked Arianna, a thin smile on her lips. "Nah, they're all a bit... well, you know.." said Arianna, as she moved her hands up in a gesture of surrender. Vania just nodded in sympathy, her eyebrow cocked in a quizzical expression. Arianna laughed at her sister's obvious bemusement, before taking another drag on the Rothman's cigarette that was propped between her fingers.  Arianna was startled by the sight of a tall stranger emerging from out of the shadows beside the granny flat; so much so, that she dropped her unfinished cigarette on the ground, letting out a small yelp as she did so. She regained her compsure quickly enough, and glanced up at the unknown person who had almost made her make a fool of herself.  By his unsteady gait and young-looking face, she guessed he must be one of the revellers; though she couldn’t recall having been introduced to him earlier on. As he looked at her, a quirky smile flickered along the corners of his mouth; and he was pretty blatant as his dark eyes gave her a calculating 'up and down' look. She barely had time to think, let alone register any indignation, before he spoke.  "So-o, who have we got here then, Greg?" he asked. "Ah, hi there, Rick... This is my girlfriend, Vania; and her younger sister, Arianna," was Greg's reply. Rick paused for a moment; and gave Arianna a deft wink. "Nice names... Any of you got a light? My rollie seems to have fizzled out...". She passed him over the red bic lighter, trying not to let her hand shake too much.  As he took it from her, he gave her another appraising look, before saying, "Ve-ery nice, thank you...". Then he lit his cigarette, gave her back the lighter, and staggered over to the doorway, and indoors to the rest of the party, the bass tones of the Sex Pistols 'I am an Anarchist' rumbling through the open door from the stereo.  Arianna watched him go: "Nice butt", she said quietly. "What was that?" said Vania. "Ahh, nothing," said Arianna, but she let a small wistful sigh slip out. She knew it was an off-the-cuff assesssment of the chance meeting, but she decided that Rick was ‘a bit of a looker’ - and wondered if he were as interesting a character as he seemed...  Several minutes later, Arianna found her interest was still piqued. So she stubbed out her second cigarette on a plant-pot holder, and said to the other two, "Well, I think I'll go inside.. it's getting chilly out here, anyway." Vania gave her a sideways glance. "Well... Me and Greg are just going to go for a walk -" Vania began, before Greg interrupted by saying, "To test out the resilience of that trampoline over there." With the little smirk that followed his statement, Arianna guessed they might be 'away' for quite awhile.  As Vania and Greg headed off, Arianna could hear them whispering to each other, and Vania's soft laughter. 'I can guess what that's about...' Arianna thought to herself, before she walked back inside the flatette, the stereo now onto playing 'Pretty Vacant'.  *                Arianna looked around the room; it was now after 10.30pm, and the party was in full swing. She could see Anthony and Peter drunkenly learing at the static-blurred images of a hardcore video they had playing noiselessly on the TV screen; to the other side of the room, Ben was talking with Ted over on the Bean-bags... and to the middle of the room, there was Rick, over by the drinks cabinet, looking very involved in creating a very volatile-looking cocktail.  She took a few moments to give him a quick 'once over', her mind assessing his looks; he was about 6'2" tall, medium build, dark hair and eyes... 'Tall, dark and handsome" reported her mental note. Straightening her shoulders, Arianna fixed her resolve; then as casually as she could, she 'strolled' over to where Rick had propped himself up.  "So, whatcha making there, then," Arianna said to Rick, once she stood a couple of paces away from him. He glanced down at her, over his right shoulder, a slow smile spreading across his full lips. She tried not to notice the catch in her breath at the sight of him, close up; even better than she'd guessed, out there in the shadows. "I'm making a Paint Stripper," he drawled, “Watch and be amazed...".  God only knew what he had already put into the half-filled glass; the pale brown colour of the liquid in it gave no indication. She watched as he picked up a bottle of Smirnoff vodka and poured in a liberal helping, then followed that with Malibu (coconut liqueur, the label informed her) and some whiskey, “For the final kick," Rick commented. He raised the glass up to his mouth, and gave it a cursory tilt in her direction, before saying "Cheers," then downing it's contents in one go.  "How many of those have you had already?" Arianna asked, feeling a bit nervous about what the answer might be. He looked thoughtful for a moment, then said, “I would say 3 or 4... but then again, it could be 7 or 8". Arianna laughed nervously, not sure what to say after that. "We-ell, I s’pose I'd better get Anthony to switch off his Dad’s tape before the VCR eats it...," Rick managed to say, trying to sound off-hand, even as the bitter after-taste of the drink bit at the back of his throat.  She watched him sidle off across the room, a small sigh escaping from her. Obviously, he was more taken by the alcohol rather than her, she decided. Still, he was rather handsome, and she made a mental note to that effect instead.  *                The rest of the evening seemed to go quite well; Arianna had had a few vodka and orange drinks, and had spoken to some of the other guys there; Ben had been the best conversation (as he was the most sober one there, being 'designated driver' for the evening), but in the gaps between socialising, she found her mind mulling over ‘the mysterious Rick’. She kept wondering if he had really noticed her - because she was finding him hard to overlook....  Arianna had been watching Rick off and on for the last 20 minutes; trying hard not to be too obvious of her focus, talking to others nearby, restricting her perusal of him to covert glimpses from under her long fringe, When she thought there was no-one looking in her direction. A couple of times, she had found herself meeting his eyes - their liquid brownness seeming to draw her in - and she would quickly turn her head away, hoping he didn’t see the hot blush she felt on her cheeks.  ‘It’s now or never,’ Arianna thought to herself, as she watched Rick from her vantage point, sitting in the shadows near the stereo system. He was over near the far side of the room, slouched out on a black Beanbag seat, his long black jean-clad legs tapering out onto the rug at the middle of the living room. He’d just been talking with Peter (who was looking rather ‘wasted’ by that stage of the evening), and Arianna had heard them mentioning an upcoming rock concert, of a band that she was familiar with.  So, a few moments after Peter unsteadily got to his feet (possibly on his way to the bathroom?), Arianna saw her opportunity. Taking a deep breath in order to try and feel ‘calm’, she picked up her drink from the side-table, and walked over to where Rick was now sitting on his own.  “Is this seat taken?”, Arianna asked (hoping she sounded confident), as she motioned at the bright orange Beanbag beside him. His eyes slowly unhooded, as he raised them to meet her face. She couldn’t mistake the slow, easy smile that slid across his full lips as he recognised her; she felt her heart skip a beat at that response. “Ahh, I think it was meant for you,” Rick responded, then he moved his arm over and fluffed up the top of the adjacent seat.  As Arianna sat down slowly, she was aware that Rick had left his hand resting there, now just behind her right shoulder. “What brings a girl like you to a place like this?,” he asked, a trace of humour obvious in his tone of voice. Arianna let out a small laugh at that, before responding with, ”That has to be the corniest line in the book”. They both chuckled for a few moments, and Arianna felt her tension begin to ease.  “I hear you’re a U2 fan”, she continued. “Who told you that?”, he asked, a sly grin on his face. “Ahh-umm... Greg mentioned it earlier on, how you, he and Ben were thinking of going to their concert at Athletic Park next month”. He leaned towards her a bit, and his hand came to rest on her shoulder. “Well, your information may indeed be correct; that is, if we can get the tickets before they sell out....”  *  Arianna and Rick had an easy conversation for nearly half an hour - they seemed to ‘hit it off’ quite well. After the initial awkwardness, they’d settled down into discussing their respective musical tastes; then they’d talked about general stuff. He’d been quite the gentleman, and she had found herself enjoying his company, and smiling at his off-beat sense of humour.  He liked the way her dark eyes had watched him as he’d spoken with her: so attentive, it had made him feel important somehow. By then, a hint of a deeper chemistry had begun sliding in between the lines of their conversation. There were longer silences, more and more lingering looks into each others eyes; and she had been leaning her right hand on his chest.  Then, he said something funny about his Phys Ed teacher, and Arianna laughed, her face leaning down towards his shoulder. “Hey”, he said quietly; and she’d looked up to find his face mere inches from her own. She could feel his warm breath on her cheek, smell the whiskey laced on it; and he saw her eyes widen, even as her lips parted slightly, and she tilted her chin up towards him.  “Ayyy, Rick!!!”, Anthony had loudly interrupted, as he’d walked up to them; and the moment had broken before it’d crystallised. Anthony said something to Rick about a ‘mean toke going’, and Rick had excused himself to her, before following his mate out the side door.  Arianna was left sitting there, feeling a little stunned; but the alcohol she’d drunken by then meant she didn’t really register any affront at this unexpected end to their conversation. Before the Beanbag even had time to cool, some guy called Aaron had sat down next to her.  *   Arianna had seen Rick later on, his nose less than an inch away from the VCR, trying to get the Pink Floyd: The Wall video tape to work, an inebriated Peter leaning nearby - Anthony had disappeared into the bathroom by then.  Vania and Greg had spent most of the night out on the trampoline; one could only guess at what the attraction had been out there? Arianna had found herself being subjected to a long diatribe from Aaron, who seemed to be intent on blinding her with his stunning personality. It hadn’t worked - she was not at all impressed at his bragging that as he came from a family of 10 children, he considered himself a ‘stud’.  By the time Greg and Vania returned indoors, it was close to midnight. Having spent the last quarter of an hour trying to convince Aaron that she wasn’t ‘interested’, it was with much relief that Arianna welcomed Vania's saying, "C'mon, Ari; better get you home. We kinda lost track of the time...". From the ruffled state of both Vania and Greg’s clothing, Arianna figured that they had been very busy indeed!  "Where's Rick, anyhow?," Arianna asked them. "Ben said that he's off out the back again, heaving up his breakfast," Greg answered. "Why the interest?" asked Vania. "Ohh, nothing... Just thought we could give him a ride home, since you guys are going back into town," Arianna answered, hoping they couldn't see her blushing. "Hmm," said Vania, "Well, we're not having him puking all over the car. Besides, Ben and the others can give him a lift. I'd better get you home before Mum and Dad throw a wobbly, so time to head off...". Arianna wanted to protest the ruling, but instead she went with them. 'After all', she thought, 'I hardly know the guy'.  Within a few minutes of saying their goodbyes, they were on their way back from Paekakiriki. Arianna pretended to be asleep; she didn't want to answer any questions, and she was feeling rather sorry that she hadn't had much opportunity to talk to Rick. She could hear Vania and Greg discussing her - they seemed to have figured out that she liked Rick, anyhow. "We'll see what we can do," Vania said to Greg. He just laughed.  *     *     *     *     *

        It was the following Saturday evening - a week since Valentine’s Day: Vania and Greg were taking Arianna to see  Crazy For You  at the movie cinema. They’d picked her up after 7pm, and were now driving their way up to Greg’s house to get Vania’s jacket.     By now, they were driving through the eastern suburb of Hataitai; Arianna absently watched the neatly painted bungalows and shrubby gardens as they drove past them. It was like a whole different view to the insipid looking ‘state’ houses from her home town of Porirua, she found herself thinking; she decided you could almost feel the air of middle-class suburbia here.    “Hey, Greg - Isn’t that Rick’s place?,” Vania said, pointing to the large white house a little further up the road they were now driving down.    “ That’s it alright,” Greg replied slowly, a trace of a smirk edging the corners of his mouth. Vania cursorily elbowed him from where she sat in the front passenger seat, muttering something to him. Arianna missed most of this exchange; instead, she was enchanted by the view of Mt Victoria, which by now was cloaked by the quite spectacular backdrop of a golden-orange sunset.     “Ahh, that’s right,” Greg continued, ”I was going to pick up my Billy Bragg tape off of Rick... Now’s as good a time as any to grab it.”    The car stopped suddenly in front of a neat white picket fence, with a slightly audible squeal from it’s tyres.     ‘What’s going on - ?’ Arianna thought to herself. She turned to see Greg unclipping his seat belt.   “Back in a minute, then,” he said, before opening the driver’s side door. Arianna didn’t mistake the quick wink he gave Vania just before his face disappeared out of sight.    "Hey, Vin - What time does the movie start again?” she asked.    “Not ‘til 8.30,”  Vania replied, as she reached over and flicked on the car radio; “Heaps of time”.     Several minutes passed; the girls had wound down all the car windows in an effort to cool the interior of the car. Morries certainly aren’t made for comfort Arianna thought to herself, as she shifted uncomfortably in her seat.     “Vin, what’s taking Greg so long -” she began, before being startled by an insistant tap-tapping on the rear window. Arianna turned around sharply, to see Rick’s face smiling at her, as he stood on the footpath at to the back of the car.    “C’mon, Ari,” Vania called to her, getting out of the car as Greg briskly explained, “Rick’s invited us in for a quick drink”. Opening her side door, Arianna hesitated for a moment, feeling a bit ‘out of kilter’.     Arianna found herself climbing out on the sidewalk before she’d had time to even think about it. Vania gently took her by the arm, and steered her toward the front gate, a wry smile on her face. The two guys were already making their way down the steep front steps, their deep voices exchanging words on the impending rugby game that weekend.     Arianna abruptly stopped walking, and turned to face her sister.    “What are we doing-?” she whispered, her voice sharpened by nerves.    “Let’s just wait and see, shall we,” Vania quietly replied, meeting Arianna’s eyes with an even gaze. “I know you wanted to see him again”.    Arianna couldn’t hide her blush this time, and Vania comforted her with a quick half-hug, telling her “You’ll be just fine”. Arianna wasn’t so sure, but started walking down the steps behind her sister just the same.    *    “So, what do you think about him, then?,” Vania murmured to Arianna, as they stood at the far end of the pool table. Greg and Rick were at the other end, by the stereo, laughing about something.    “I don’t know,” Arianna said, sounding tense.   “Maybe we shouldn’t have come here”. Vania shot her a black look, but Arianna couldn’t shake the feeling. She almost thought the guys were laughing about her, and she felt so out-of-place, so ‘small-town’ and awkward.     “Your turn,” Greg called over to them. Vania walked over to the table, confidently lifting the pool cue.    “Watch this and be truly amazed,” she said provocatively; before lining up and sinking 2 balls with one trick shot.    "Phew! Now that’s a woman who knows how to play a mean game of pool...” Greg growled, as he sidled up to Vania and playfully smacked her on the backside, making her miss her next shot. This was followed by a vigorous ‘playfight’ between the two of them.    Arianna glanced over at Rick, and found he was staring back at her, his eyes darker somehow. He couldn’t figure out why Arianna was being so off hand to him: she’d barely spoken to him in the past 20 minutes, instead sticking close to her sister. Not wanting to be shown up, he decided that maybe he’d misread the situation when he’d first met her. As he saw her turn her eyes away from him, and cross her arms defensively, he felt a pang of frustration. It looked like she didn’t like him after all; and he’d been looking forward to seeing her again, too.    Rick walked up to the pool table and grabbed a spare cue. “Good shot, Vania. Now, this is the finale’” he declared. With a deft hand, he sank the last coloured ball, then walked over to the far side of the table, to line up the 8 ball. Arianna was right behind him now; she tried not to breathe: he was so close. Vania and Greg by now stood with their arms around each other, breathing heavily, looking rather dishevelled after their playful altercation. “Go on then, big man,” Vania urged, before she gave Greg a long, lingering kiss.     Rick glanced over his shoulder, to see that Arianna was now looking down at the floor. This wasn’t going at all the way he’d hoped. Gritting his teeth, he turned his attention back to the game; he lined up the shot, and with a loud ‘crack’ sent the 8 ball scooting into the far corner pocket.     “We win !” Greg yelled, as Vania started emptying the pockets back out on to the table, replying, “Yeah, mere luck; this time, us gals will get you...”. Rick turned sharply, and shoved the pool cue on to the table, trying not to let his disappointment show.    “Sorry, but it’ll have to wait ‘til some other time; I’ve got a party to go to,” he said, his voice low. Arianna looked up, her eyes widening, a sense of dread filling her bones. Vania and Greg seemed oblivious to the tension crackling in the air between the other two. “Well, we’d better get going ourselves, or we’ll miss those lurvely promo’s before the movie,” Vania remarked. “Ohh, I can’t wait,” Greg enthused sarcastically, then started in on a melodramatic rendition of the Trumpet icecream ad.    Arianna found herself laughing at that along with Vania - but she was disturbed by the way that Rick was now behaving. He’d walked over to the doorway by now, and was throwing on his black woolen trenchcoat.    “So, I’ll see you guys ‘round,” Rick said. “You can show yourselves out - I was s’posed to have met Anthony 20 minutes ago...”. Arianna watched silently now, as he retreated out the back door; and she flinched as it slammed behind him.     “C’mon, Ari - Let’s get going,” Vania called, ”Can’t miss Madonna’s movie debut, can we?”. Arianna followed them up the stairs to front hallway; Greg lead the way, while he sang luridly in a high-pitched voice:    “We are liv-ing in a Mahh-tear-ee-al world, and I am a Mahh-tear-ee-al GIRL !” . Vania was giggling loudly, but Arianna felt strangely humourless. That sinking feeling she sometimes got had hit an all time low...    *    The car pulled up outside the theatre, and Vania glanced back over her shoulder at Arianna.    ”Hey - You’ve been as quiet as a mouse back there - you okay?”, Vania asked her.   “Just tired out, I guess”, Arianna explained, managing to impart a weak smile, before adding, “I’m still trying to get back into the swing of studying again, you know how it is”. Vania frowned briefly, then turned her attention back to Greg.    “Well, we had better get a carpark sorted out pretty quick - it’s quarter past eight already,” Vania noted.    “There should be a space or two left behind the Midnight Expresso”.    Several minutes later, the three of them were walking down Courtney Place, Vania animatedly talking about the upcoming INXS concert.    “They’re really brilliant live, apparently. Michael Hutchence’s vocals are awesome...” she enthused. Arianna’s mood had brightened up considerably; Vania’s cheerful banter had reminded her why she had come out in the first place.    “Yeah; cousin Michaela is already booking her tickets down from New Plymouth. It’ll certainly be a night to remember!” Arianna replied. A cool Nor’westerly nipped at their heels, hurrying them along.    “Heck - the movie will be starting soon,” Greg interjected. Better get a move on, girls!”.     By now, their conversation had come to the movie close at hand; they could see the bright lights of the Paramount Theatre up ahead.    “Apparently Madonna’s cameo appearance is rather su-perb,” Vania said in a preppy voice, and they all sniggered at her ‘review’. By the time they had crossed the road, it looked like their plans for the evening were not going to go as expected: there was a queue from the front of the cinema a hundred people or more long.     “Wow - looks like some people are desperate enough to go to anything on a Saturday night!,” Greg said loudly, to be glared at by several of the crowd.    “Ahh, well - people in glass houses shouldn’t throw stones,” Vania added, as they fell into line behind the rest of the movie-goers.    “Howdy, strangers!,” a male voice called from nearby. Arianna looked over her shoulder, and was surprised to see Rick walking up to them.    “Hi to you, too, Rick,” Greg called back.    “Whatcha doing here, then? Thought you were going to catch up with Anthony and the others...”. By now, Rick was standing next to Arianna: she found she couldn’t stop looking up at him.    “Turns out the party’s not starting ‘til 10pm; so I thought I’d come down here to get munchies at Chevy’s”, Rick explained.    “Fancy seeing you lot again so soon”, he said, glancing down at Arianna. When he saw her expectant gaze, he gave her a warm smile: Perhaps I was right to come here afterall, he decided.    “Well - it’s 8.25 now; and this queue’s not getting shorter very fast,” Vania pointed out, “So we may as well come and join you”. Greg agreed, and Arianna added exuberantly, “I’d love a burger!”.    *    As they walked out of the restaurant and into the cool evening air, there was a general feeling of friendliness in the air. The four of them joking around and chatting freely; the earlier uneasiness between Arianna and Rick long since forgotten.     “You’d better get going, Rick; it’s nearly 9.30 now,” Greg reminded him. “Ah, what the hey -” Rick responded, “I think I’ll tag along with you guys for awhile - if you don’t mind!”. Arianna couldn’t stop herself from smiling widely at that suggestion. “Sure!”, she said, before any one else had time to reply.    “Well, Greg and I were thinking about going out for a drive out the back of Mirimar, if you two are game,” Vania told them. Rick looked over at Arianna, and was impressed to see her boldly watching him now, her eyes almost challenging him to do something - reckless.    “Sounds good”, Rick replied.    “Perhaps we can have a smoke?”. Vania and Greg slowly looked at each other. “Whatever you like,” Vania said after a few moments. They then headed back in the general direction of the carpark, the mood flowing smoothly as they went.    *    They’d parked the car up on a vacant lot around the far side of the Mirimar Penninsula; the only sign of ‘civilisation’ were the lights of the motorway across the harbour.A full moon and the sparse illumination from a few street lamps dimly lit the grassy area in which they now stood. It was an isolated spot, with a flat area about half the size of a football field, backed by a near-vertical hillside. Across the road was a narrow strip of stony beach; the night air was still, the background sound around them was of the salt water gently lapping at the shore.    Vania and Greg were sitting up on the bonnet of the Morrie, leaning heavily on each other. The sound of the car radio kept the immediate atmosphere sociable, and everyone seemed to be filled with a sense of expectation. Of what, none of them really knew - but they were all abuzz with it, regardless.    “It’s turning out to be an interesting night, after all,” Vania commented, to no-one in particular - the others all made noises of agreement.    “Must be the full moon,” suggested Arianna. Greg, true to his usual off-the-cuff manner, punctuated her words with a low wolf-like howl.The sound echoed back at them off the steep hill face, leaving them to stand silently for several moments, just listening.     The pause was broken by Vania saying, “I think that Greg and I will go for a bit of a wander over to the beach; it’s a lovely night to go for a walk”. Greg gave her a knowing smile, before adding, “And maybe we’ll even do some beach-combing, aye Vin”. They all laughed at that, a mixture of awkwardness and camaraderie.    As they watched Vania and Greg retreating into the semi-dark, Arianna found herself breifly wandering if she and Rick might ever share that kind of closeness. Even as the end of her thought trailed off, Rick spoke.    “Look - I’m sorry about being me having been so off-hand earlier on... It’s just that I’ve had alot on my mind lately”. Arianna turned to face him, her eyes meeting his; she could see a trace of nervousness in his expression.    “Yeah,” she began, “I’m sorry, too: I just felt so...”    “  Awkward  ?” Rick offerred. They both laughed softly.    “Yep, that’s the one”, Arianna agreed.     “It’s a funny old world, alright”, Rick continued.    “I certainly didn’t think that you and I would be here like this, now”. Arianna wandered if he was reading her mind, and the insight of his words made her start to feel insecure. She nodded in agreement, even as her heart began racing with a sudden sense of panic. She found herself at a loss for words, and maybe even a little unnerved by his close proximity. As he moved to sit down on the back seat of the car, she began walking in the opposite direction, towards the shadows of the hillside.    When Arianna was 30 feet or so from the car, she turned around to watch him; feeling safer somehow, hidden by the night. She crouched down on her haunches, then tried to stay as motionless as possible. She could see Rick sitting on the back seat, his long legs slung out the open door, a cigarette in his hand, his outline barely visible by the feeble glow of the car’s interior light.    Arianna could make out the sound of Peking Man’s ‘A Room That Echoes’ playing on the car radio. After a few minutes, she saw Rick stand up, and slowly start walking in the general direction of where she’d headed off in earlier.     After a few paces, he stopped and called out to her, “Ari ! Where’d you go?”. She sniggered softly to herself, as she saw him turning back towards the car. He turned back around, as if he may have heard her; then he crooned, “I have bis-cuits... Chocolate biscuits. I may have to eat them all on my lone-some”.     That made her laugh outloud this time, and she saw his face turn sharply in her direction. “I know your’re out ther, Arianna...” he finished, before he walked back to the car. She didn’t here the words he whispered to himself then: “And I wish you were close to me, now ”.    Rick couldn’t figure out why Arianna had walked away from him so abruptly like that - but he’d figured that maybe she was just shy; she seemed so young and alone. He could kind of relate to that: Rick had felt very alone for a long time now, like he was an outsider in his own life, watching it go on around him.     Sure, he had plenty of friends - but it was his ‘old man’ that bothered him. His father had been 50 years old when Rick started primary school; and he’d never really felt like he’d gotten to know his Dad, not like a real father. And his mother was always so busy with her committees and church groups. ‘Real Middle-Class Suburbia’ stuff, he called it.     ‘Still’, Rick mused, ‘Such is life’. He’d gotten used to feeling like he didn’t fit the family mould, and found some comfort in hanging out with his mates, ‘partying’. ‘But now’, Rick thought to himself, ‘Something is changing - I see Arianna, and I feel something... Being around her, I want to be real. And that’s so alien to how I have become...’.     Rick’s deep line of thought was disrupted by the sight of Arianna re-emerging out of the late evening shadows. Seeing her again, he realised that maybe it was already ‘too late’ for him - his breath caught in his throat as he traced the outline of her figure in the moonlight, noticing the way it lit up her golden hair. ‘Like an angel’, Rick found himself thinking, ‘Is she too good for me?’. The intensity of his thoughts surprised him somewhat: it was all too weird to him to feel anything, let alone tenderness.    “Too weird’, Rick muttered to himself. “What’s that?”, Arianna asked, as she came within a few steps of him. “You’re here”, he countered. “Oh”, Arianna began, as she now stood only a couple of feet in front of him, “I guess I am, aren’t I?”. They both looked each other in the eye after that, an unspoken understanding passing between them. After several moments, Rick simply said, “Food, then?”. Arianna nodded, and sat down beside him on the boot of the car.    *    By the time that Vania and Greg had returned, Arianna and Rick had settled in to an easy conversation, reflecting on musical tastes and the latest movies.    “See,” Vania whispered to Greg, just before they got within hearing distance of the others, “I told you that there was something there...”.    Greg nodded, then yelled, “Hello you two!”; and he and Vania both sniggered at how both Rick and Arianna looked stunned at the interuption.     “We wondered when you two might be getting back,” Rick drawled, and Arianna smiled lazily.    “Well, there’s this amazing little nook in a stand of trees over by the road, so Vin and I -”,Greg blurted, before he was cut short by an elbow in the ribs from Vania. From his loud yelp, she must have ‘meant it’.    “Besides, it’s time we did get going,” Vania finished.    However, once they’d all gotten back in the car and Greg got the engine going, it quickly became apparent that they had a problem. As the car slowly started to make it’s way back across the grass verge, it lurched unevenly to one side, followed by an erratic shuddering.     “Ahh, shit’, Greg cursed, “Looks like we’ve got a flattie”.    He shut the engine off again, and climbed out to take a look; Rick followed him to inspect the tyre in question. Sure enough, the driver’s side front tyre was flet; on closer examination, they found it was torn clean down the middle.    “Must’ve driven over a smashed bottle,” Rick suggested. Greg gave him a black stare, before answering in an exasperated tone , “Thank you for your insightful observation, Mr Bright Boy”.    Greg walked up to the front passenger window, and Vania wound it down. He stuck in his head, his intense frown making it clear that the news wasn’t good.    “Well, ladies - It has become apparent that we won’t be driving anywhere else tonight. As the car had a flattie last week, the one that’s now died is the spare!”.    Vania and Arianna climbed out of the car, carrying their shoulder bags.    “Shit happens”, Vania said matter-of-factly, before asking, “How far is it to your place from here, Greg?”. He paused for a moment, before replying.    “If we go up the concrete pathway that are a few minutes up the road, it will take us about half an hour on foot. But those stairs are damn steep”, he added.    Twenty minutes later, they were climbing the hundreds of steps up the back of Mirimar. Greg and Vania lead the way, their voices going back and forth between them in a warm banter. Rick and Arianna were several paces behind them, silent apart from their laboured breathing.    Arianna found her thoughts clouding up; there was a growing sense of unease in the pit of her stomach. She stopped walking suddenly; Rick turned to her to see why she had paused.    “Ari,” he asked,”What’s the matter?”.    “I - I’m cold”, she replied”, punctuating her comment with a visible shudder.    “Here then, wear my jacket,” he offerred. she nodded quickly, and he transferred his woolen coat, draping it over her shoulders; he left his hands resting on them.    “You  sure you’re okay?”, he enquired, trying to meet her eyes. She fixed her gaze on the ground between her feet.    “Yeah, I’m alright now; thanks...”.     As they resumed walking, Rick slipped his left arm around her shoulders, and she felt her shoulders relax. Arianna found she liked him holding her so closely; and Rick couldn’t seem to stop smiling for the rest of their journey up the path.    *    “Guess I had better get going”, Rick said, as he stood up from the kitchen table. The four of them had all been sitting in the kitchen at Greg’s house, having a hot drink each and talking.    “Oh... Do you have to go yet?”, Arianna asked, her voice letting on her dissappointment. Vania turned a knowing look towards Greg: “Shush”, he muttered to her. The other two seemed not to notice.     “Well, I’ve already missed the last bus back to Hataitai,” Rick explained, “and it’s a thirty minute walk”. Arianna was at a loss as what to say in response, so she simply nodded instead. They had ‘phoned Arianna and Vania’s mother on their arrival, to say that a ride home was imposssible; their Mum had to agree, as Vania had comfortingly told her there were ‘suitable’ sleeping arrangements.    “It’s been good having you ‘round again, Rick mate”, Greg said.    “I’ll go downstairs and make up the spare beds”, Vania suggested. “Greg - Can you show me where the blankets are?” she continued.    “You know, Vin: over by the -”, Greg began.    “  Remind   me”, Vania said pointedly, before gently grabbing him by the arm and towing him towards the hall doorway.    “See ya ‘round then, Rick”, she finished, and Greg gave them a quick wave as they dissappeared around the corner.    Arianna looked up at Rick; only to find he was already watching her, the recognition of it causing a small smile to lift the corners of his mouth. She felt a myriad of words spring to mind, but all that she came out with was, “It’s been cool getting to know you a bit better, Rick”. He raised his eyebrows quizzically, then his smile widened further and he said, “Back at you...”. He leaned down, his face now only a few inches from hers; and their eyes met unwaveringly.     Arianna could feel his warm breathe on her cheek, and she imagined her heart might leap out of her mouth and land on the table, no doubt making a messy situation. ‘I want him to kiss me’ she found herself thinking. Rick’s eyes moved to her lips, and lingered there for a few moments, before meeting her eyes again - his eyes had darkened now ; his thoughts obviously in agreement with hers. Suddenly feeling awkward, he broke their gaze, saying, “I really had better get going...”.     Arianna felt like her head was spinning; shakily, she got up from her seat at the table. They both walked over to the door, then she took the jacket off and handed it back to him.    “Thanks for that”, Arianna said, as he reached over for it, then briskly pulled it on.    “My pleasure, lil’ lady”, Rick drawled in a fake Texan accent. She couldn’t help but smile at that.    “Maybe I’ll see you again - ? ”, she asked hopefully. He gave her a wide, toothy smile in response.    “You better count on it”, he said softly.     Before she could say anything else, he had already opened the back door.    “It’s been... good”, he said, and then turned to go. Arianna watched wordlessly as he carefully closed the door behind him.    “See you soon...”, she whispered to the now closed door.    *    It was now about 2am in the morning; Arianna was wide awake, her thoughts so loud in her head, that she couldn’t get to sleep. Sighing, she quietly pulled back the covers on the bed, and sat up slowly. She could hear Vania’s slow breathing from the other spare bed, on the other side of the room.     In the dimly moonlit room, she could make out the shape of the windows behind the closed curtains. Gently, she put her feet on the cork-tiled floor, catching her breath at the coolness it presented her bed-warmed toes. She stood up carefully, then shuffled over to the windows; finding that the man-sized T-shirt she wore as a makeshift nightgown left her thin legs at the mercy of the cool night air. She could feel the goosebumps prickling their way up her legs and bare arms, but she felt drawn to continue towards the curtained glass.     Gingerly, Arianna lifted the fabric curtains; the flowered pattern on them resembling dark whorls against a lighter tone. As her eyes adjusted to the brighter light outside, she could see the tall macrocarpa trees lining the outer edge of the backyard; and beyond that, the almost glassy colbalt blue of Wellington harbour.     In the distance, the sparse street lights from Eastbourne were visible; they twinkled like small orange-coloured stars. The night sky was clear; the full moon a pale neon blue on the inky indigo-hued sky. She stood there for a few minutes; her thoughts now abstract, feeling connected to some stronger sense of being.    Arianna found that her thoughts kept returning to the look in Rick’s eyes, just before he had left; the way that for that breif moment, he seemed to have been able to see right into her soul. It was both frightening and exhilarating at the same time; she had never been so affected by a guy’s presence before. Had he felt it, too?    Arianna found herself going over what they had said to each other in detail, seeing the hidden nuances underneath what they had said to each other when they were alone; and she began to realise the magnitude of what her feelings were coming to be. I am falling in love with Rick... I hardly know him, but I can’t stop thinking about him...     She was surprised to find that the thought didn’t frighten her at all; it was instead like something vital was starting to fall into place for her. She could feel her heart racing, and knew that even now, she was smiling; and that she couldn’t wait to see him again...    *     *     *     *     *

        It was the beginning of summer - outside, the drone of cicadas thrummed lazily in the late afternoon sunshine. But where Arianna sat, indoors, the air seemed as thick as a mid-winter fog.    "Arianna; I really need to do this... I need to do this for myself ," Rick said, as he stood facing the bay windows. "If I don't do this now, chances are I will never have the opportunity again. And Canterbury is the best University to attend for an Engineering Degree."   Arianna tried not to let herself cry - after all, they'd only been a 'casual couple' for the past 6 months now. But it still didn't make it any easier to admit that he was right.    "Do what you need to do, Rick...", Arianna managed to say, though it made her feel like a traitor to herself.      He was still talking, she could hear his voice; but there seemed to be a horrible whirring noise rolling inside her head, and she felt sick to the pit of her stomach. He was animatedly waving his arms around as he spoke now, as he turned to face her.    Rick stopped suddenly, and walked up to where she was sitting : that shook her out of her unpleasant day-dream.     "Ari... ! Are you listening to me?" he almost snarled, realising his audience wasn't paying him enough attention. "This is really important. I've thought about this a lot, and I know that we need to rethink our options." Once he saw her nod her head, he continued his speech.     "We've only ever known each other... You are all I've ever known”, Rick said with an air of drama. As he continued his oratory, he paced slowly back and forth across the room as he spoke, seeming quite agitated now.     "I think we need to... see other people. This will be a good opportunity for both of us. You can see that, can't you?". Arianna was sitting quietly on the sofa, her eyes lowered, as she swallowed back the urge to cry. Rick found her uncharacteristic silence frustrating: Arianna had always had something to say for herself. But, now, she sat there stonily, saying nothing at all.    Rick stopped in front of her again; and this time, he crouched down on one knee.    "Ari - You know I'm right, don't you?", he asked, softly now. Arianna bit at her lip, and nodded slowly. He pressed a warm, gentle kiss on her forehead; and she closed her eyes, forcing salty tears to slip out onto her cheeks. She lifted up her arms, and put them around his shoulders: all she wanted to do was hold him, just hold him, and never have to let go.     "Yes, I know you need this..." she said, her voice strained. He closed his eyes then, and let his head rest on her lap. Arianna rested her head gently on his, and imagined that at that moment, she felt her heart split in two.    *    "C'mon, Ari- Let's get going!", Vania called from the front doorway. Arianna had been day-dreaming again: it often seemed she was 'in a world of her own', as her mother called it. Vania wondered what was bugging her - but she thought she probably knew the answer: Rick as usual.     It was now the beginning of autumn, and Vania had invited Arianna along to a party at her friends place in the city, hoping it might make Arianna realise it was time to 'move on' with her life. "The taxi is here - and Jade was expecting us to arrive nearly an hour ago!".    Arianna shook her head, trying to clear her thoughts. It'd been too long since Rick had last written to her, she felt. He'd left at the end of January, promising to "keep in touch", and had told her that he still loved her. She pulled her thoughts back to the present, trying to dispel the apathy that suddenly seemed to wash over her.    Vania had asked her to come along to party with her; and since the ‘hostess’, Jade and her friends were such 'good value', Arianna knew she was bound to have a good time there. Besides, it was her 19th birthday tomorrow .     "Cheer up gal - You're only young once ", Arianna muttered to herself.    "Coming, Vin!" she called down the hallway.    "Lucky for some!”, Vania wittily yelled back. Arianna trotted up to the front door, fastening the buttons on her black woollen trenchcoat as she went.     The two girls had taken the taxi to the train station, and had arrived there mere minutes before the train was due to leave. They ran up through the subway access to make it to the boarding platform in time. They’d nearly thrown themselves through the carriage doors, mere seconds before they had hissed shut behind them.     The excitement of the close call still had them talking animatedly when they got off at the city stop. There were a line of taxis waiting at the queue there, and they were still full of cheer when they got out of the cab on a now drizzly evening on Kelburn Parade.     The lights welcomed them as they skipped up the front steps of the student flat, at 9.30pm, they were now at Jade's party. Within minutes of getting in the door, Jade and the other party-goers had made them both feel right at home.    It turned out to be "one hell of a night"; Jade's circle of friends included members from the local punk-rock band Skinned Kat - and those guys really seemed to know how to 'party hard'.    Still feeling sorry for herself about Rick's absence, Arianna had drunken far too much vodka, in a subconscious effort to drown her sorrows. Now she was sitting in one of the lime green easy chairs, over by the by windows, animatedly talking to the band's drummer, "Stretch". (He never did tell her his real name; Vania had later told her it was something like Edwin.).    "So-o-oo, you've heard about the Dead Kennedy's then", Stretch slurred. But d'ya know about Black Flag ? They have some real hard-core numbahs...".    Arianna let her head roll over to face him, trying to focus on his red-rimmed eyes.   "Ohh, yeah, shure have. I'ze even got 'em on tape", Arianna said after a few moments. He started to tell her about some bands she hadn't heard of; she tried her best to memorise them, but her brain wouldn't let her.    "Ermm... Stre-etch, I fink I need to use the ladies... Wood ya mind waiting 'til I get back? This con-vah-sate-shun is really interestin'," she said after several minutes.    "Shu-ure, No problemmo -" Stretch began; Arianna was already trying to make her unsteady way across the room, and endeavouring not to step on the people lounging on the floor.     Leaning one arm against the wall of the hallway, she made her way to the toilet; she found that a few moments after having stood up, that the alcohol had hit home with a vengeance. She began to feel very nauseous, and she felt completely disconnected from reality.    "Vin... Vin!!  I dohn feel so good..."Arianna managed to say. Luckily for her, Jade had just come out from a room nearby.    "Aww, Ari my-lass; you don't look at all well... You just wait here. I'll go and find Vin for you." Arianna just nodded her head shakily, and slid down the wall, legs akimbo.    The rest of the late evening had gone by in an alcohol-induced blur for Arianna. Vania had indeed come to her aid - and had managed to help her stagger back into the main room. Arianna had a vague recollection of having spent the last hour or so before midnight with her head covered by her coat, vomiting it all back up into a plastic bowl that Vania had quickly managed to find.     At 2am the next morning, the seedy smell coming from her jacket when she had regained consciousness along with the horrible taste in her mouth had made her all too aware that she'd overdone it. Gingerly, she had lifted the jacket off of her face... to be greeted by the few remaining people there singing her a slurry version of 'Happy Birthday To You'. Arianna had winced, as the pain in her head felt like it could split her skull in two.     'So much for feeling better', she thought to herself, feeling miserable at her unkempt state.    *    It was another Sunday night; just over a week after her 19th birthday. Arianna had started studying at Vic at the start of the year: but she was finding it hard to make close friends, and it was getting harder for her to feel motivated by her studies.     'Thank goodness Easter Break started this week', she thought to herself, as she sat at her desk in her bedroom. The sheaf of photocopied notes sitting in front of her remained silent; as she tried to overcome the bone deep feeling of inertia, and to start writing an essay on the mating habits of the Black Stilt.    Arianna didn't really feel like she fitted the typical “university scene”, anyhow - every other student seemed to be there either for the social angle (to "party" with other student cliques) or were seriously "study-driven" people who spent all their spare time in the library.     She, by her estimation, was neither - the friendly banter she shared with her fellow class-mates didn’t extend beyond lecture hours. If it wasn’t for Vania, she knew that she would probably have been spending every weekend at home, pining over her absent sometime boyfriend...    "Darn you, Rick - Why did you have to go?!" she asked the framed photograph sitting at the far end of her desk. Arianna pushed her half-hearted study notes to one side, took a deep breath, then stood up from her seat, pushing the chair back with the back of her knees..    "I really need a hobby to take my mind off him..." she mused. Instead, she walked down to the kitchen, with a view to making herself a 'cuppa'.    Arianna found her thoughts shifting uneasily; as she realised, again, that Rick hadn't written or even 'phoned her for the past month. "Maybe he's found someone else", she muttered, before slamming the larder door shut.    Several minutes later, Arianna was sitting down at the big oak dining table, yesterday's Evening Post newspaper spread out in front of her - reading the horoscopes, and attempting the crosswords, a warm cup of tea in her left hand. She was irritated at the interruption when the 'phone started to ring. She got up slowly, and took her time walking over to answer it.    "Hello, Holt Residence. The occupants are otherwise indisposed, so could you please leave a message after the b-", she began, only to be stopped in mid sentence by a deep-toned laugh at the other end of the line. Her heart leapt as she realised who it was.    "Hello, Ari," she heard Rick saying,"Whatcha been up to ?". She paused for a few moments, trying to contain herself, wanting to sound as aloof as possible.    "Not a heck of alot", she said, "...So, to what do I owe the honour of this 'call. Did the postal pigeon die or something ?". She heard a deep chuckle from him, before he said, "No, no - I'm in Wellington - At my folk's place. For the Easter Break.". Arianna fought hard to keep her composure.    "Ahh, good for you. Why did you 'call?", she asked bluntly.    "We-ell; I've come up for Ted's farewell party: he's heading over to Australia, as of this Monday night, to live there. The party is later on tonight. But, anyhow - I was wondering if I could meet you on Tuesday, in town, before I head back down south... I'd really like to see you again."    He seemed pretty sure of himself, thought Arianna. But, she mused, it had been ages since she had seen him... and she really did miss him.   "I - I guess I could do that. I'll meet you for lunch, after my morning lectures, if you like."    She was sure she could hear him smiling as he agreed that he would like that; and they discussed how they could meet, before settling on it. He then told her more about Ted's planned move, but told her very little in regards to what he himself had been up to since last they had met.    Arianna didn't seem to mind - her heart felt so full, she thought it might burst. She was just so 'thrilled' that he had finally 'called - and that he wanted to see her. She could barely contain her excitement as they finished their conversation.    "Hey, Rick", she said quietly, "I really missed you, y'know."    A few moments passed, before he said, "Yeah, I know. I kinda missed you, too."   Arianna felt like she wanted to say alot more - her thoughts were clamouring to tell him how she still felt. Instead, she managed to restrain them, and said; "I'll see you on Tuesday, then. Bye".    *    Arianna was getting impatient for the lecture to finish. Proffessor Dekes was going over the finer points of embryonic development; his style of presentation wasn’t at all riveting. She kept looking impatiently at her watch, in between scrawling down rough notes in her Cell Biology lecture book.    When the class was finally overwith, Arianna nearly ran from the lecture theatre: the bus left in only fifteen minutes, hence her haste. She made it to the bus stop in the nick of time, the red bus pulling in as a response to her frantically waved ticket; and by 11am, she was alighting to the main street in Hataitai. It was a steep climb up the hill from there - but she still made her ascent in record time.     A few minutes later, Arianna was standing outside Rick’s front door. Her fingers trembled noticably as she reached up for the doorbell. She paused for a few moments, catching her breath, then pressed the button firmly. A few moments later, Rick’s smiling face appeared as he opened the door wide.    “So, you made it”, he confirmed.    “My mother’s still here - would you like to come in for a cuppa?”.    Arianna nodded her assent, then followed him back inside the house.     Mrs Jeffries seemed genuinely glad to see her; and had immediately sat her down to tell her all about her and her husband’s recent business-related trip to China, even bringing out the photographs they’d taken of the exotic scenery.     Arianna found it increasingly hard to ignore Rick, even though he sat at the far end of the table. A bemused smile curved across his face, his eyes sparkling as he watched her intently.    “Ahh, Mum”, Rick interupted after half an hour or so, “I told Arianna that I’d take her out to lunch. It’s nearly midday now, so we had really better be going...”.    He walked up to Arianna, pulling out her chair as she stood up.   "Well, it’s been nice seeing you again, Arianna”, the older woman said cheerfully.   “I’d better be going soon myself - I’ve got an appointment in town at 12.30”. Arianna nodded thoughtfully.    “It was nice to see you again, too”, she replied.    “Thanks for the tea, Mrs Jeffries”.    Even as his mother had turned to put the teapot on the kitchen bench, Rick had gently pulled her by the hand out the hallway door.    A few minutes later, Arianna and Rick were walking back down the hill, not saying very much to each other. They turned to wave at the little red Honda Civic that went past them with a toot of it’s horn - a jovial looking Mrs Jeffries at the wheel. They then had a brief dicussion on the unseasonably warm autumn weather; but Arianna got the distinct impression that his thoughts definitely seemed to be elsewhere.    He said very little; he kept smiling at her, and it seemed he couldn’t take his eyes off her.    “Do you mind - ?”, he asked suddenly, as he moved to put his arm around her waist.   “No, that’s fine by me”, she replied; and felt a momentary tingling spread over her once his bare arm rested firmly over her hips.    They’d stopped and brought lunch at the local cafe. Rick had made the suggestion that as it was such a sunny day, that perhaps they could make it into a picnic and go for a walk up to Mt Victoria reserve.    They were now sitting in a secluded glade, several metres away from the narrow walking track. The warm midday sun poured down on them; their conversation was punctuated by long pauses, as they would just stop and watch each other, basking in each other’s company.    “So, what have you been up to at Canty - Met any babes?”, she jokingly asked.    Rick lowered his eyes for a moment, then shook his head, saying quietly, ”I’ve really missed you, Ari”.    The previously light air of their talking suddenly seemed to shift. Rick looked up again, a slightly hopeful expression on his face.    “I  really have...”, he continued earnestly, “...and I know I still love you”.    Arianna’s heart skipped a beat: but she didn’t respond. He looked at her searchingly for several seconds, trying to judge what she might be thinking. Then, he slowly moved his head forward, until his face was mere inches away from hers. Then he whispered, “I dreamed about being with you again...”. She lowered her eyes, her heart racing now, her voice stolen by the intense look in his eyes.     Rick raised one of his hands, softly resting the back of the fingers at the crease of Arianna’s neck; she responded instinctively, curving her cheek down to touch the back of his hand. He then continued by tracing her jawline with the tips of his fingers, with a slow stroke upwards to her chin; Arianna thrilled at his warm caress, her eyes becoming hooded.     As her hands came up to encircle his waist, he gently tilted her chin up to face him, her lips slowly parting as he did so. He whispered throatily, “I want you so much, Ari... Please let me make love to you”. As their lips came together in a burningly passionate kiss, and with it the last of Arianna’s coolness was seared away. He had his answer...    *    They had walked back to the house; their progress somewhat slowed by them stopping every so often to exchange heated kisses in secluded spots along the way. By the time they had reached the privacy of his room, the tension between them had become almost unbearable in it’s intensity. They had lost no time in basking in the heat of their passion; and both had been deeply sated by the time Arianna had left his bed.    They had parted amicably, holding each other’s gaze with a warm smile as they had spoken; Rick had promised her that he would ‘call her when he was back in town the following month during mid-term break. Arianna had not wanted to put too much weight on his words - she knew all too well how fragile their bond had become in the past year; and understood the casualness he had now come to expect of the time they spent together.     Arianna paused on her walk back to the university campus, and sat for a time on the hillside above the Mt Victoria tunnel. She sat in the long grass, absently watching as the traffic ebbed and flowed on the tunnel entrance road below.     The smell of the late autumn afternoon seemed sweeter to her somehow; the shadows from the tall pine trees behind her could not cool the warm glow that she felt inside her. She felt so happy at that moment, that she thought her heart would burst: she had to acknowledge to herself, at least, the truth of her feelings - she still loved Rick. And she had known that to the very core of her being, that very afternoon, from the climactic moment when their souls had seemed to touch.     An ironic smile played at the corners of her mouth, as she saw the impromptu lesson unfolding before her even as she watched the world go on as before around her. Close by, a pair of Red Admiral Butterflies fluttered urgently above a small glade of flowers, their time in the sun short but sweet - and it dawned on her that she knew that ‘dance’ all too well...    A genuine ‘Catch 22’ situation had been created by their stolen time together this afternoon, she admitted to herself now. For although she was now more sure than ever about how deep her feelings for Rick ran, she also understood that he would never offer her more than they currently shared.    Arianna knew it was unlikely that Rick would ever change: he valued his freedom too much, and had come to loathe the confines of a traditional relationship. To put it bluntly, as in a tale her divorcee aunt had once related to her, he simply wasn’t “marriage material”. A part of her had once hoped that ‘one day’ his preferences would grow and allow them to pursue a more stable partnership again; now she knew it was time to let that false hope go.     All she knew of him at the present time added up to a guy who would never want to “be pinned down” - and she couldn’t deny that she wanted to be able to count on the man she loved to be there for her in a more reliable way. Even as she embraced the afterglow, Arianna realised that she too wanted to explore the wider possibilities that life might offer her - she was only 19, after all. Time to move on, then.    Arianna pulled a blank lecture pad from out of her back-pack, and found herself soon writing a farewell poem to him - some how knowing he would never read it. As she finished the final stanza, tears welled in her eyes and she compressed her lips. quickly reading what she had read, she was surprised by the eloquence it presented:    “ Love of the Gypsy ”    How can you hold on to something   When it is always on a different course   How can you say you have someone   When they were never really yours    If the world stopped beating   Just for one fragile minute   How could you see all it’s wonders   The beauty hidden within it?    Moving out into a new age   The truth may be hard to find   Without remorse - face up to the light   You must leave this love behind    Open palms ceded with a shrug   Closed hearts give nothing away   You cannot live with the fear   Of loving  him from day to day    Since you cannot hide from me   I’ll find that which  I have missed   As we walk into our twilight hour   Away from this heartfelt loneliness...     Laughing dryly, Arianna carefully pulled the page out, folded it up into a small square, and slipped it into the top pocket of her jacket. Shrugging off the mixed emotions, Arianna re-packed her bag, and made her way to the mouth of the tunnel walkway.     She glanced back over her shoulder at the houses on the opposite hillside, a sense of something having fundamentally shifted inside of her. She silently hoped the impending winter wouldn’t be too harsh...    *   *   *   *   *

         Things have been pretty 'sweet' up here - the newest turn of events inside my immediate family, that of Shavaughn starting to have two 4 1/2 hour sessions away at Kathleen's (the Barnados caregiver on the next street over), has been VERY good so far.  Shavaughn seems to enjoy the social interaction with the two other girls (both around 3 years old also), and Kathleen herself is a very nice person (easy to get along with) who seems to be going out of her way to be helpful, which is cool. She's offered to take Shavaughn on two daytime occassions in the next fortnight 'unpaid' - as she likes how the three girls do get on when they are all together, so she doesn't want to break up the team! &lt;grin&gt;.

         Yep, it's the Marla-Drama weekly(-ish) instalment, for your entertainment (or ennui, and if you know what word means, chances are it indeed applies to you!)...          Here's the personal drama from me for this month: after a few weeks of avoiding him / thinking about splitting up with my some time boyfriend, last Friday morning I FINALLY sent Nigil a polite Dear John-styled Email (which, in more detail, said that I needed "time out" from spending time with him, and that it feels like it is time to 'move on' anyhow, as things between him and me didn't seem to be heading anywhere)...          Got one back from him late that same evening apologising for not having kept in touch lately (the excuse being that he's been very tired lately and SLEEPING alot!!!) and asking if I wanted him to visit on Saturday, and I re-read what I sent him and thought HOW DID HE NOT GET IT??? and I sent him one back going all whiney that surely THAT will be enough to put the wind up up / make him run a mile since the last one was too ineffectual? LOL...          As it was, he never showed up on Saturday, no word as to why - so maybe he read my Email AFTER he sent his one to me? WHO KNOWS!!! I am through worrying about his motivations (or lack thereof)...          Funny thing was that his (very large and scarey-looking) mate Jase turned up here late yesterday afternoon looking for Nigil, apparently "to give him the bash" for standing them up over helping with home renovations once too often (and I wasn't so naughty as to say to Jase as he was leaving "give him a little smack from me too")... so I guess I'm not the only one who's been stood up by him once too often? LOL...          And my cousin Owen fixed my (once munted) mower for me yesterday afternoon, so I got the lawns mowed finally, and Owen invited himself over for a coffee after dinnertime too - he reckoned it was just because he was bored, but I think he was being a male-rellie-type and watching out for me in case Nige did deem to turn up... so I returned the favour by talking his ear off about anything and everything until well after midnight!.          I think I'm on my way to getting things back on track to what I was supposed to be aiming for up here - ending the diversion of my half-arsed (year and a bit long) affair with Nige was part of cleaning out the proverbial deadwood and making way for more positive things to come into my life. Overall though, things have been improving for us since we came up to Auckland - have made a few new good friends of my own (Owen, Kathleen & Shaun) and have some real stalwarts on my side (Beth and Jeannette &amp; Mikey) so that's helped heaps.          Having friends to talk over what I'm up to / how I'm feeling has helped me realise that it was indeed time to let go of the Nigil-thing, and even though I get sad about having to let go of it, I've been pleasantly surprised by the feeling of peace / happiness that's filling up the place where I was holding on to all the hurt and feeling of inadequacy etc-. I'm of the mind that my involvement with Nigil was to teach me one of those life's lessons, and maybe to give me the opportunity to let go of past hurts / betrayals... trouble was that, for him, that he isn't yet ready to let go of his past on that score, and I can't keep pretending that being a band-aid is enough for me anymore.          Better to be on 'my own' and strong than continually putting myself 'out there' for some one who can't (for whatever reason) be there for me, too... And it is so VERY cool to feel free to DREAM again about what GOOD things the future might hold for the four of us (once I get my act together, LOL)... Geez I sure can talk up a storm ah? *grin*.          Anyhows, the kiddlies are all fine - the younger two had a great old time of it today running about the yard while I got the rest of the back lawns mowed, Jonathan and Shavaughn running / riding bikes around the 'circuit' track where the grass had been mowed already... Angelina spent most of a very sunny afternoon indoor playing playstation, typical pre-teen ah?          Shavaughn gave us all a bit of a fright just before dinnertime this evening by trying to kiss (?!) my lady-shave razor (!) and cutting her mouth, just above her top lip - don't ask me HOW she managed to reach it, but she was NOT happy when she got cut! Luckily applying a sold compress to it and getting her to lie with her head back on the sofa for half an hour or so stopped the (initially rather profuse) blood flow - so now she's got a little white hitler-styled moustache of surgical tape on her top lip, and her mother is of a mind to buy an electric razor... and then perhaps learn how to live without sharp implements about the house in general! =siiiighhh=          Marla Jane

           Jonathan home from school today at noon or thereabouts as they had a half day (teacher-parent initial interview thingeys)... so Jonathan, Shavaughn and I went for a walk down the shops after lunch and he got himself some pressies at the $2 and Bargain shops with his BDay spending money ($8 - I figured cos he'd turned 8 that was fair) and then he picked out junky food off the supermarket shelves for a BDay styled afternoon tea (and Shavaughn threw a wobbly cos she wasn't the one being spoilt for a change LOL)...

      Hi again everybody!   Have been flat out this week, though I know I was busy, it all seems to be a bit of a blur - funny how quickly one can adjust from ho-hum to a busier routine and not realise just how much more is getting done? Is good though, to be feeling like I've been 'more productive' lately - and the kids seem to be enjoying having me more attentive & everyone into a good routine again... Maybe it means we've finally settled in up here (in Akld) - spooky to realise it's taken us almost a year to feel right in saying 'we're there now'...    Though how long we'll stay settled for is anyone's guess, what with our abode being up for sale! No more news on that front - though more people turning up to measure the section size, from both the buyers and the seller's camps, so I suspect there's some kind of bidding effort going on while they haggle out the price before firmly accepting an offer (with 3 offers ont he table, guess they can be picky? LOL).    Caught up on a few people this week, not including the daily trips to kindy and the fortnightly MAPS meeting on Tuesday... Cousin Owen dropped by a coupla evenings early in the week for a cuppa / dessert, and to get his laundry done - think he's gearing up well and truly now for his move to Winton (Southland). In just over a week he'll be wending his way south, with stops at Palmerston North (to see Lexie, Dennis and Shirley) next Sunday, hopefully having time to catch up with other rellies in Wellington before his ferry crossing on the wee small hours of Tuesday the 27th, and heading south via Chch that day, so at the very least stopping in for lunch at my Mum's (his Aunty Margaret's). Depending on how energetic he's feeling, it's either keep heading south from Chch on the Tuesday, though he's been advised he's welcome to stay the night at his Aunt's (a.k.a my Mum's) if he needs a rest!    My friend Kathleen is moving this weekend, way over to the other side of Papakura - she rang earlier in the week, is apparently surrounded by a multitude of boxes but reckons she and husband Shaun are on track to get things moved today and tomorrow, leaving her Monday to get the clean up done at their 'old' place (another landlord strong-arming good tenants - whan will it end? LOL).    Caught up with Jeannette on msn a few days this week - sounds like she's getting on OK out there in Pukekohe, kids n Mikey keeping her busy, and sounds like she and Mikey are looking forward to a planned day trip down to Waihi tomorrow (sans kids) to visit a freind who's been under the weather...    Finally caught up with 'me old mate' Nigil in person mid-week, he popped over for a coupla hours for a friendly cuppa and chat, great to see him again after over 6 months persona non grata... he seems to be happy with his lot, moving on with things and maybe even finding life aint so bad after all ;-) ...   Friday evening was Sista's night at Harvest Church - Karen picked us up about 5.20pm (and Angelina headed off to her friend Rebecca's down the street directly across from our place - she arranged to go there as she didn't want to be the only teenager at the kid's slumber party Karen and Christine had organised)...    We had sausages and chips at Christine's, along with the other children, Christine and Mark (Karen's husband - who was later to be on babysitting duty with Robbie, Christine's hubby - though when we were still there he was apparently stuck in traffic thanks to a traffic snare up / accident at Khyber Pass). Jonathan and Shavaughn had already taken off to play with the other children by the time we'd wrapped up the present for the guest speaker and made our way out the door just before 7pm...    Got a seat at a table with other people I'd met at MAPS, including Andrea, Vicki and Helen, as well as a few new faces... Two of the ladies up in front speaking on the night were also from my study group, so was very cool to hear more about the MAPS group's history from Christine, hadn't known anything about it's humble beginnings before las'night, LOL...    Then when another MAPS lady, Dianne, did her talk, during which she also made mention of a positive thing I'd said that had helped her alot! (About the second time I met Dianne at the MAPS study group, we'd had a study on hardening of hearts / how to keep ours open to others - I'd mentioned to Dianne on my way out that she needed to be less hard on herself, that she seemed to be a good person who made every effort to provide her kids with a good life etc - ).    That talk was followed by another of the Harvest Church ladies giving a talk on the marriage-enhancement seminars the church was holding... We also got treated to some lovely worship songs from a group of four girls, awesome to feel the 'hum' in the air from the feeling their voices brought with them...  To end the formal part of the evening, we got a fantastic sermon on "Excellence" from the guest speaker, Pastor Linda Dishroom (from Tauranga).    After supper, I serepticiously scored Andrea and Christine a piece of fudge each - I just asked the next table over, where the guest speaker was, if I could 'borrow' theirs, LOL - cos otherwise they'd have missed out, busy as they'd been doing the hostessing before they got a chance to sit down! So I've got a rep now, haha...    Also had a good talk with Vikki during supper - she's looking at returning to the workforce, as she has recently had a brilliant offer of flexible part time work - but she was looking for the best care for her 10 month old boy - told her I could help her with that, who to call etc- and to call me back (as we both swapped 'phone numbers) once she'd met with some of the care givers so I could talk to Kathleen about the prospective caregivers (since she has worked for Barnados - as she is also Shavaughn's old caregiver! - she knows a lot about the local child care scene from her numerous years as a nanny / caregiver)...    "Networking 101 for Mothers", LOL... Helen came up to me before I was heading out the door to check I'd been OK with the other church speaker's talk on marriage / coupledom, so reassured her that I wasn't about to fall apart over that, though nice I guess that she recognised not everyone there fitted the 'norm', LOL...    I made sure I gave Christine and Karen a hug before I went home (they were among the group tidying up afterwards too) and gave Dianne a hug when I told her I got the reference on the unnamed person she's said had helped her - she just grinned widely and told me she'd hoped I'd known it was me she'd meant, and that she hadn't wanted to embarrass me by mentioning me by name in her speech... She was genuinely over the moon about what I had told her, how cool is it to pass on stuff that you understand (divine intervention there, I'm sure of that...).    Got a ride homewards with Susi, first stop after droppping off a couple of other ladies was to Christine's to pick up the kids - and I made sure I thanked Mark when I picked up the kids - told him how much I appreciated his 'n' Robbie's having baby-sat them gratis... Gave Susi a farewell hug too, for giving me and the younger two a ride home to our place too...   So, last night was a hit with me - I got to talk, listen, laugh, be appreciated / appreciate others, some awesome spiritual re-inforcement, a wider sense of belonging, a real sense of being cared for / looked after by others, to meet new people, to know the kids had a great night out too, LOTS OF HUGS and so much more - GREAT night out!  .    The younger two seem to have really enjoyed their 'slumber party' - though today Shavaughn asked me how she'd gotten home (she seemed genuinely perplexed!), cos she'd been half asleep when we got a ride home about 10.30pm, I'd just picked her up outta her bunk bed at Christine's and she'd stayed dopey all the way home, musta seemed like a dream to her I guess, LOL...    They had 5 other kids around their own age to play with while they were there - Jonathan was stoked, he had two other 8 year old boys to play with, they were hanging out in the upstairs room doing 'guy stuff' til they finally exhausted themsleves and fell asleep  ... And Shavaughn got to catch up with Isaac and to get dressed up as a princess care of 10 year old Josie... Angelina was back home only briefly this afternoon, (for lunch! LOL) another of her friends, Kelly, picked her up, cos she's spending the night there tonight - on the proviso that she must attend church next Sunday, and she has even promised to behave during the service as well...  .    Today, caught up on the washing, and got the lawns mowed this afternoon (the weather has been BEAUT lately!), got to stop and have a cuppa with Dolly when she popped over for a visit too - Jonathan and Shavaughn indoors playing / watching videos...    Which reminds me, I got a belated birthday pressie on Thursday of this week from my baby brother, Kev (who lives over in Aussie - has bought a house there recently too) - a couple of his friends were over here / in Akld visiting family, so as a favour to Kev they dropped the gift off to me in person - a VCR (!) and 5 copies of tapes (Shrek, Ice Age, Harry Potter, Scooby Doo and Monsters Inc) so the kids have been enjoying watching videos pretty much all their time when at home since Thursday afternoon... Should be useful to have when the weather does turn wintery for real though!    A generous 'n' thoughtful pressie indeed, although being the first one he's sent me in a few years, I'll just grin widely and graciously accept it...*G_R_I_N*.   No 'new' news on the legal access/custody front - the ex woulda been served the court papers / affadavit by now, though if he tried ringing last night to rant about it we were OUT  ... Should hear back next week I guess, hopefully through his lawyer, so that when he calls the kids on their regular catch up night (Monday) he won't be tempted to get into a foolish slanging match with me over it... Fingers crossed (I am allergic to conflict BIG time...)!   Marla Jane

        Hello again!    Let's take a squiz at the ol' diary... I'll start with the most recent goings on up here, and work backwards? "Let's do the tiiiime warp agaaaain" :-)    We actually had a bit of a damp day here today (after a week of warm sunny weather - TRUE story! LOL) so Jonathan's Swimming Sports today was postponed, even though he took his swimming gear to school with him this morning.     Angelina had her Year 9 English and Science end-of-year exams today - though she got home early after the last (science) exam, she was appalled that she finished it early and had to sit there doing nothing for an hour while in school (can't please some teenagers LOL)... She has her Social Studies and Maths exams on Monday, and didn't seem to appreciate me asking how much she 'enjoyed' her first ever exam(s) - in fact, she seemed totally to NOT have found it a milestone worth cheering about as I did!   Shavaughn had her usual four-hour Friday kindy session this morning - they're starting to decorate it too with streamers to get kids in the Christmas spirit - though a lot of the parent's aren't too cheered this year, as the kindy's closing it's doors permanently on the 11th of December this year due to the land being sold out from under (by the Defence Force)... Shavaughn won't be directly affected of course, as she'll be starting school in the new school year, only a coupla months now before she turns 5!!!           On the up side, the kids (and their parents) got shouted a free trip to Mark Vette's Rescue Zoo south of Pukekohe on Wednesday of this week, so I tagged along with Shavaughn and the others on their bus trip southwards on the day... It used to be a run-down old private zoo, with elderly owners who couldn't really afford to invest in doing it up as it needed to be, so the animals were all getting on in years too and a bit miserable (to say the least).           The guy who's bought it (a coupla months ago) might be familiar to any body who's watched TV1 in the past coupla years - him and all the animals he trains for TV/Movie/ Advertising work were on that program 'Funny Farm' with that dog Herc having his voice-over done by Kevin Smith - ? Ah well, I watched it a few times, so I know it was real LOL... Herc's that dog from the Toyota 'bugga' ad...            They've done a good job a rehabilitating the animals at the zoo already, the minature strawberry roan horse has even gone from being stroppy to learning some tricks of his own to entertain people during his 'enrichment' program as they call it. Mark Vette's business partner Mary is also an animal trainer, so we got to see that gorgeous black horse from Xena and those National Bank ads, and see her put through her paces...            Shavaughn and the other kids seemed to enjoy all the different animals about the place, and the trained animal show at the end was a highlight for me and the other parents (as I think you can tell - !). Everyone was having hysterics when Herc the dog was doing his lawnmowing routine, then the Border Collie joined in; and the little Fox Terrier from the SPC ads delighted the kids by shutting himself in a cupboard / pretending to pee (on cue - just cocked up a leg, not the full act!) on a plant pot!!! There was also a trained minature Kuni Kuni pig and (talking) sulphur-crested Cockatoos in the show...            The people who now own / run the zoo are professional animal trainers, and so they've got gear from the sets of The Last Samurai, LoTR and the Xena / Hercules TV shows, and apparently they'll be setting up those for the tourists as well as having shows to highlight what their animals are learning / doing now, too - so should be quite a cool place to look out a few years from now (I'd love to get involved ay - they have over 100 volunteers and are looking for more - BUT!).           OK, I'll quit that now, I could probably type on about it for ages, sad to admit the trip was my highlight for this term LOL... The 3 photo's with Shavaughn in them I've attached with this Email were taken there, too.           Have JUST bought some more film for the camera, so will get some new pics of ALL the kids and Email a few to everyone, as well as probably do another webpage with ALL the photos taken recently (including, YES - Herc the dog pushing a lawnmower muwah ha ha ha...).           OK, so what ELSE have we been up to lately? Well, Angelina's impressed the socks off herself by getting 90% in her music theory test last week - which has somehow given her the incentive to think she wants to keep learning to play the bass guitar next year (she loves practical bass guitar lessons she gets at music - apparently she can play the intro to a Stone Temple Pilot's song and is now learning a Nirvana one - "Go my Grunge Chicky Babe" LOL)...            Jonathan's gotten a coupla prizes for 'good behaviour' as a member of the winning group in his class (free twisty pencils and bags of munchies among other things for having the most golden stars on the board apparently) and even got the 'star pupil' award at his school assembly a coupla times this term... He looked pretty puffed out after Sports Day at his school yesterday, but hey, he was just proud of himself for not passing out from dehydrations cos he foprgot his drink bottle LOL...           And Shavaughn? Well, she's got first prize at home for being the most assertive! :-P            So, apart from the school / kindy stuff, what else did everyone around here get up to in the past month that's even remotely noteworthy??? (OK, maybe, at best, mentionable, but hey, it's all good, and an excuse for me to stay down here on the comp and ignore Jonathan's getting squeaky at his older sister cos she changed the channel on the TV again etc- etc- etc LOL)...           I went along to the Mother's Group outing to the Akld Botanical Gardens (in Manurewa that is) last Tuesday - Christine rang and asked me along, and as I hadn't seen her since the first week of term, thought it a good chance to catch up with her and some of the other MAP's group ladies... Fed the ducks, ducklings (and the spooky giant eel swimming under the ducks eating the bread too), chatted to the dozen or so ladies while they had cuppas, then I got to chase an exhuberant 3 and a half year old down the slope to intercept her before she followed another kid right to the water's edge... I was just impressed I could run that far / fast LOL...            In recent weeks we've also had drop-in visits from Kathleen & Amy, Letesha &amp;amp; Briar, Dolly, and Nigil; as well as Shavaughn going over to Morgana's house several times after kindy (and even on one occassion a weekend afternoon for their family's BBQ party...!).           We had a quiet(ish) night in on Guy Fawke's this year - which was OK by us, the kids had a more interactive Halloween instead - why do we have two rather morbid holiday celebrations this time of year? Thank heaven (literally perhaps!) for Christmas soon LOL...            Back to Halloween though; Angelina went trick-or-treating with another teenage friend or two 'til just on nightfall - though she was appalled at how un-Halloween-spirit people were up here (i.e. hardly any lollies!) compared to her memories of Christchurch-based Halloweens in the past... She then went over to Rebecca's (just across / up the road from us) and stayed the night ... meaning they stayed up all night watching spooky movies!            Shavaughn helped me give the trick-or-treaters who turned up on our doorstep (all polite older kids mostly, only a few groups through though) the lollipops we had waiting 'just in case', and Jonathan got side-tracked from wanting to go out trick-or-treating when I suggested / started making up cut-out paper pumpkin / spider decorations to stick on the windows and let kids know we were 'trick-or-treater friendly' here LOL...           Apart from Shavaughn making sure we've been going to church the past few Sundays (cos she asks to go to Sunday School - she loves it by the sounds of it!), the younger two also had a big social day out on the 6th of November with International Day (a kind of Gala) at Jonathan's school - he was happy we came along and made sure he got all the trimmings for lunch (though we passed on the hangi...).            Anyhow... on the 'what's coming up soon' front, (I'm sure you've all had enough of 'X-number-of-weeks-til-Christmas' so I won't mention THAT day LOL)... Angelina finishes school on the 5th of December; Jonathan's got a trip to The Auckland Museum next Wednesday with the middle school, with his last day of school being on the 16th of December; Shavaughn's last day of kindy (as mentioned) is on the 11th of December...            Angelina's heading down to Christchurch on Boxing Day evening for about a month to visit/stay with friends 'n' family down there(though I still hafta sort her out a ride to the airport!!!); and got an Email from the ex last week to confirm that Jonathan and Shavaughn are due to head down to Nelson on the 10th of January - he's going to arrange for Shavaughn to have a birthday celebration down there before they come back on the 23rd (her BDay's on the 24th) which is cool with me, I've already told her that her BDay from me this year is going to the uniform shop to get her school gear LOL...            So, looks like I'll be having at least a coupla weeks up here all on my lonesome (LOL) so if any of ya'all are gonna be up this way then - come visit me! PLEASE!!! ;-)           And, last item for this month... for those who haven't heard it yet through the grapevine / from me through other media yet, that is! I have got all 3 paintings back from the Nayland College Exhibition - so no buyers BUT the main thing is I that got them all back in one piece so... (Jonathan's adopted the dolphin painting, loves having it up on his wall - the puma one looks great in our lounge - the place where it was intended to go all those years ago when I started it! - and hey, the tigers are in my room so...).            I have been invited back 'to show' again for next year - though that probably means I'd better pay the invoice they just mailed me this week for the return courier LOL... Thanks EVERYONE for all the support, good to know that ya'all liked my paintings - and I'll send ya any updated links should I get any new ones on the site anytime in the next few months too :-)           For those of you who live / visit up this way - of course there's an open invitation to vist me at my 'home gallery' anytime for a cuppa and to 'view' all the paintings first hand!. For everyone else, my virtual gallery link is available  urlLink here , too! ;-)           Marla Jane

        My children are my life, my happiness, and my fullest blessing. I would do whatever it takes to make the best life I can for them, try to be the best person I can be so that I am worthy of their unconditional love and trust in me, and I thank God every day for them (or at least I mean to!)...       Teenage child Angelina is not only my eldest, she is my  inspiration  and has been since her arrival in my life, her tawny eyes ever watchful of me and so wise beyond her years. She’s been her own person from before she was even born, and so different to me in so many ways she is like a breath of fresh air that fills my sails even when I feel weary with living sometimes. She’s a very able student at school, has a strong sense of self (and self-reliance) and yet has social prowess (and a wide circle of friends) that she never lets undermine who she is.       Then we have primary school-aged Jonathan – my boy, my  sweetheart  – big hazel-green eyes that look so widely at the world in a way that few can; an imagination that could grow daisies on the moon, construct the most fantastic rocket ships to distant stars, and design the most elaborate maps of some unknown city. He marches to his own drum, one that seems to run parallel to the rhythm of his big and loving heart, and his smiles and hugs are like the water of life for my thirsty soul, and he pours over me even before I realise how arid my hopes have become.       And the most recent typhoon on my emotional 'scape is pre-schooler Shavaughn – she looks exactly as I did at whatever age she might be now, her  intense  dark eyes could bore holes through diamonds and liquefy titanium – and yet I am awestruck by her intensity of presence, her sheer bloody-mindedness in pursuit of what she can extract from both her environment and those around her. Never one to do things by half measures, she seems almost surprised when she hits a wall that impedes her progress towards that which she has her sights on now – and while sometimes I worry she might get hurt by pushing to far too hard too fast I have faith that she will win out over any odds one would care to name... In her I am also reminded of my life's past lessons.      Thankyou again Lord, for my life's little blessings...      Marla Jane       5th December 2003

       A used condom growing opaque in the litter bin; an unusually shaped faded-looking stain on the sheet; a few fingerprint-shaped bruises on the back of her left thigh (she just noticed those today, almost four days later, and for some reason, a sense of relief floods her mind).   It really did happen.   Did she imagine how it all took place – like a fated moment in time, imperfect but impossibly sweet in it’s openness. As she sits there in the late afternoon sun, the urge to want to forget the whole thing, chalk it up to experience and move on, seems to remain unheard.   I didn’t hear his heart beat when I lay my head on his chest.   For some reason, she feels a vague sense of unease about all the things left unsaid, undone, as if she somehow believes there should have been more... More than this for him to have entered into her inner sanctum, that place where she had forgotten she really existed, beyond the reach of this world that has never really owned her.  The strange sense of an incomplete picture; fragments of a memory; the absence of an after-taste (and yet the smell of a spring rose, a pale and perfect bud, as yet unopened, comes to mind).   Lips so soft and perfect.   Not really believing it could have existed beyond the moment it all took place. Not wanting to imagine it could ever now be more than whatever it was. And yet somewhere a new awareness hides, it’s light tendrils wrapped around the edges of her consciousness, clinging there despite her efforts to bring back the nothingness that was there before it.   As lithe and perfect a body as a dancer, so smooth and beautiful.   She moves toward the bedroom, listening to another song on the radio that is somehow more full of energy, of meaning, of life. She stretches out her arms, curling the palms up and out, stretching out like a dancer, no one looking on to notice the foolishness of a grown woman imagining she is as light as a feather...  Free at last.   It should have been a dream, she knows this now. It would have been if only for the fading evidence, and the irretrievable sense of a paradigm shift within her very soul. Sometimes, she thinks as she smiles to herself, you never know what to expect...    Marla Jane     17th January 2004

        Well, here I am again – on a new tangent – perhaps this time it’s the right one for me? Time will of course tell...      There’s a sense of liberation – as I let go of all the past, my expectations of those I know / knew, and embark on ‘something else’ for a while.       Currently without children at home to think about, I am (at last?) able to delve deeper into my own depths and see what has grown there, behind the scenes in this long incubation period where I expended all my energies on being a mother and ‘good person’.      I am quite surprised, then, to find that Marla is in fact still there, and she has more insight and willfulness than she had before the past year came and went. Whether the latter is a good thing will of course wait to be seen...      This world has many faults, as do I – but by hiding from it’s slights and arrows and resting my wary form on the sidelines, I have not changed the fact that I must exist here (for now at least). I can not be more or less than what I am, and I can not live for anyone else, nor can anyone else determine how I should be. Even writing that makes me feel free (at last?) of the expectations I had superimposed over myself in an attempt to fit in some where, any where at all, just to belong...       That I didn’t fit in comes as no surprise to me now – when have I ever been more than at the very edge of conformity, when was I ever truly satisfied to just be content with a partial existence? Feeling an absence there that I chose to ignore did not prevent the strands of carefully constructed fancifulness coming undone in the end...      This journey I am on, it is mine alone to take. I can expect no immediate results or lasting insights – it flows around me like water, sometimes I am porous enough in spirit to take it in, at other times it washes over me without leaving a hint of dampness – and yet I can not deny that I burn. I thirst, I hunger, I desire – my identity is not a fragment of a whole, but a multi-faceted thing, perhaps a diamond in the rough.      I imagine I am truly alone in body and yet I am continually waxing and waning with the weight of spiritual flares that are sent out to me by those around me... Perhaps I hide away so much now because it is tiring to my soul to empathise with even the least familiar of those people I meet. Do they notice how I extend myself out, reach into their psyches, and withdraw a connection to them like they have never come across before? I’m laughing at that thought, bemused at my somewhat laughable claim. And yet, I know it to be true.      No matter what they do, or say, to me, I feel their struggles to reach the surface of a consciousness beyond the immediate struggles of the physical realm. That the words seem to come from me like water from a well, drawn out before I even wonder where the insights come from, and they look at me with a mixture of surprise and gratefulness, is quite interesting to realise...       Once removed – I am half in this world, and yet an otherness connects me to never really fitting in. I thought I had found my explanation in those gentle Christians I got to know this year – that if God has chosen me to be His, I am not ‘supposed’ to ever feel content / that I belong in this world, for there is supposed to be a heavenly home at the end of this journey. I have not dismissed that ideal – as it helps me to understand why it must be this way...      I do still believe that the water flowing around my life now is indeed Jesus, and I will continue to remain open to the gift He has given me of forgiveness and wholeness... And as this seed falls away from the barren soil it had landed on for so long now, I pray that it lands where The Water can help me grow into something beautiful – the person that He sees in my heart that I am only now getting to know myself...      That my ‘sudden’ outburst of willfulness of late has not seen Him withdraw His love (that warm sense of peace, that calmness staying with me even as I reach into new possibilities), nor cause me to feel a barrier to His forgiveness, to me exemplifies the sheer extent and depth of His commitment to me. In any case, my spirit is nolonger alone, nor will it ever be again...      Am I ‘trusting in Him’ I hear you ask? Yes, I am – for I know He won’t let me stumble into ‘testing’ contexts unless I need to experience them to grow / learn, and I further know He will be there to pull me out of the worst consequences of my actions, dust me off, and listen to me berate myself and apologise to Him for having been such a naughty child.      And do you know what? I figure God indeed made man – because He is the master of irony. Just when you have given up hope, believing that He won’t let you go beyond the limits you have chosen for yourself (while believing they are His) His Light shines from behind a rain-dampened cloud as evening falls And you might too find yourself sitting on the side of a busy road waiting for some one to show up, singing some Tom Petty song and laughing at your own willfulness, saying "OK, God, I get it – I’m not allowed to go there"... and then you see him, walking towards you, and you wonder how He allowed that!      Maybe this person you met was just a catalyst: as having met him and been enchanted by the almost ethereal experience of having been with him for one short night, it seems like your thoughts have been given clarity, the past an overwhelming sense of closure.      If that was all it was ever intended to be, Lord, I accept that... As I tell you now, it felt like I have lain with an angel, some one so impossibly beautiful and perfect that it takes my breath away to acknowledge it ever happened at all. A dream, a chimera, a taste of something unworldly yet within a worldly context. I am intrigued...       Marla Jane      16th January 2004

        “  Don’t forget how we feel tonight... how happy we have been together the past few weeks. It can’t always be like this, life is bound to get rough again, as it always does. Just promise me one thing... promise me that you will try to remember how you feel, how we both feel right now... If we both do that, we’ll be able to get to feel like this again, as long as we don’t forget it can be like this between us...  ”      For the first time I can remember, I had tears rolling down my eyes tonight as I recounted that moment to a friend. I’d meant it you know – I’d wanted it to work between us. We were both so happy those first few months after our youngest child was born, and it gave me hope that our marriage could work, if only we both kept on believing in it. Who knew then that my words were falling on deaf ears, even as you lay there drowsing after we’d pleasured each other, both of us comfortable and sated in our nakedness...      Somewhere, I stopped loving you... though perhaps I closed my heart to you to try to stop being hurt by hoping you might remember your love for me, when I finally realised that you had changed – that you weren’t that man I had grown to love anymore. And I myself had forgotten it had ever been like that between us, too... though I can understand I had to, to be able to let go, to heal, all that esoteric stuff.      So much shit has passed by under the bridge between us since then – just now realising that I should respect that I can’t just bust it down even now, as we still have the kids who need to make their way across that gap between us. It will never be undone, the link I have to you, my now ex husband – even when you remarry in a couple of months time, even though I won’t have to ever see your face in person again by then, you will always be a part of my life.

         Took Misty (our approx. 15 year old cat) the vet on Thursday evening with Owen's help, and the prognosis  wasn't  good - she had a tumour under her tongue (which was growing rapidly and making it increasingly hard for her to eat solids...        Her right eye kept getting blood filling up behind the cornea, which the vet said was due to an infection that had spread to both eyes, and her right eye had gone blind, and her left would likely follow given the severity of the infection. To top it all off, her rapid loss of condition / prone-ness to infection in the past coupla months probably meant liver or systemic kidney failure.         Given her age and the likelihood of her condition worsening (despite her temporary recovery for a week or two at the start of January) the only option was to have her put to sleep. Angelina brought her home so we could say goodbye to her - though by Friday evening it was clear that Misty had deteriorated to the point where she would only suffer if we put it off any longer, her face so swollen and sore...         Watching her having such a hard time just trying to drink fullcream milk (after I saw she couldn't even attempt to eat the biskats and most of the wet food had fallen out of her mouth when she'd tried eating that too) made me realise it would just be cruel to put off the inevitable any longer...         So Owen picked her up on Saturday afternoon and took her to the vets for her final visit, Angelina went along but stayed in the car when he took the cat in...         We were both a bit teary-eyed after she got back, though Misty is being cremated, so we should be getting her remains back in a little wooden casket at the start of this week, so when can put her to rest somewhere safe once we have moved house...        Thanks for listening to our little sadness, and here's praying that they have a special place in heaven for sweet pets like Misty...        Marla Jane

        Fugue   =   (psychiatry)   ‘  A period during which a patient suffers loss of memory, and, after recovery, recalls nothing of the amnesiac period  ’   (source: Webster’s Dictionary) .  Well, that meant something other than I’d expected – though it summarises my recall of what I felt and yet can no longer remember, those several months before I moved up here from Christchurch. I was wholly isolated and emotionless then, I really can’t recall what I felt like / how I thought about things then. And for that I am grateful – for I imagine now that where I was then was most likely not worth remembering!   Ague   =   (n)   ‘  Intermittent fever or chills and fever  ’   (et al.)   Am definitely suffering from some intermittent sense of wrongness – most recently suspected to be some vague strain of ‘ love-sickness ’ – as I try and deny the depth of the fever and the severity with which it struck.   Angst   =   (n)   ‘  Anxiety; dread  ’   (et al.)   On the upside, this has to be expressed as a past state-of-being – in that I was anxious, dreading opening up my heart to being hurt again. Now, here I am, possibly blistering in the hot sun of recognition – as I realise   I love   you   and am lost for words to tell you how I feel. I can’t explain why, how, or any other logical statement to support the pretext – and yet I am  angry  at you for not seeing what has happened to me.   So what if I’m being cryptic, avoiding you, wondering why I feel so ‘in the firing line’ of being rejected when I haven’t said  why  I needed to see you. I still feel just as hurt as if I had said those words that had bubbled up inside of me that afternoon.  How could you      not      have seen/heard what I meant?!    Even as I write this, I feel like I’m being overly dramatic, that I don’t know sh*t, that I’m making it up, super-imposing my general feelings of angst relating to external sources (i.e. anniversaries of a depressing nature abound of late). But, no – it is because of  you : me and you. Unfinished, unanswered, unspoken, unheard, perhaps even  undone .   Am I really so invisible to you that you can’t (or   won't  ) see me???    What is it about me, (or about   you  ) that makes it impossible for you to give ‘us’ even a small chance of growing into something beyond friendship - ?   I am a heartbeat away from throwing our friendship onto the sword of sacrifice – wanting to kill it completely so that I don’t have to keep seeing things that  belie  ‘simple friendship’.  I know you are mystified by my recent coolness/avoidances – though at the same time you are relieved. Perplexed yet glad. Are you also annoyed at me for elicited deeper emotions on you, or simply angry at me for having challenged you tot hink beyond your immediate concerns? Or, worse yet,  do you not even give me a second thought  - ?!   And why oh  why , why am I running away - ?    Marla Jane    6th March 2004

        Here I am again, another stone’s throw away from a birthday passing by. And yet, all that I have known before now has almost completely been sheared away, almost as if by a surgeon’s scalpel, so clear cut you can hardly notice the scars left on my psyche.       Can (or should) I feel hurt when the excision was necessary for my growth?       Am I fearful that all that may be left of me is a benign growth, harmless and yet surplus to requirement?      Did my life before now mean anything, or was it all a malignancy brought about by my birth?      (Tsk tsk, such dark metaphors, where are the usual comparisons to natural beauties such as trees, flowers, oceans, mountains, shorelines...?).      There is a sense of having been reborn and yet not quite having let go of a ‘past life’ – my past seems as vivid as a dream upon first waking, yet as depthless as a sitcom in it’s lasting impact.       A drama queen no longer, a wannabe minus the want, my heart’s desire a bruise on an otherwise whole apple. Have I fallen from the tree  (here we go, the expected metaphors),  or   am I still hanging from the branch, wondering if I’ll be eaten up/egested out, or be allowed to fall and become a fruitful tree of my own?      faux pas      I told him that I loved him – and, no, he didn’t realise that he loved me too – he acted pleasantly surprised then guarded, muttering something about not being ready for a relationship etc. (Even though I’d pre-qualified my revelation by saying that it was not intended to put him under any obligation whatsoever - !).      I want to pretend to be offended or hurt by his honesty, to say that the weight shifting off my shoulders and the sense of completion at the time was lasting, but neither has been the case.       ‘It’ is the only remnant from my past life that remains unresolved; why oh why does my heart still dare to leap upon seeing a glance of him, and yet I literally hide behind a wall rather than dare face speaking to him again. Which begs the question:      Which am I most fearful of – that looking at him face to face will present me with irrefutable confirmation of my unrequited love for him – or that I will feel  nothing  other than a fleeting sense of embarrassment at the stark realisation that he is/was only ever a friend?      rejecting the rejectees      I am almost ready for religious confirmation – deciding the only  masculine  presence that both wants and accepts my love is the godhead – and yet I sense an underlying need for martyrdom in my decision.      “  You who do not love me, to all those who have rejected me, I am  not  of this world, or needing of your validation – for my purpose lies in Christ’s calling on my life (and spirit)  ”.      There is indeed truth in the statement and yet I see that,again, I might be going about this / aiming for this the wrong way   (or even for the wrong reasons)  ...      fantasm or phantom?      I suggest this as it is I who lies in bed, imagining a warm   (masculine)   body beside me, arms around my waist, comforting me, as I go to sleep at night...      This desire is in no way spiritual; not so much an ache as a fleeting dream, an afterthought, not really believing it will ever be real for me in this remaining lifetime of mine.       It is not necessarily a physical   (a.k.a. sexual)   craving, as it is an  admission  that my waist was meant to be held by a man, that my size and shape was meant to be ‘spooned’ by a larger form behind me, my neck pressed with light kisses as I fall asleep...      fantasy vs. feinting      OK, perhaps that   is   indeed a fleshly desire in part – and yet I continue to wonder why oh WHY did God make me a woman if I was not intended to be a life companion to an earthly man also? Lord, I have no answers, and forgive me if I am being wrong in questioning such things...      By wondering why I am a spirit encased in fleshly form rather than   (say)   an angel, and by extension suggesting I am human   (flawed)   for a REASON, I may be missing the point entirely...      In time, as my body ages further and my spirit comes closer to the next realm, perhaps I will overcome my earthly longings. Though it seems harsh right now to ‘wish it all away’, in time I will understand why this time must be...      Marla Jane

       She felt the pressure rise in her veins, blood throbbing against the barrier presented to them by her tensed muscles. It wasn’t his face that made her anger awaken – it was seeing that two-faced mother-in-law from days gone by, standing there in their wedding photo, clearly proud her son had found a childless woman to betroth. It came as less of a surprise to see his sullen faced sister in one of the shots, at least her expression was honest.  That none of has his family had bothered to come to their wedding came home and settled on her bones like a spectral vulture, gnawing away at the fleshless remainder of betrayal that clung to her spirit. His new wife of course was suitably young and excited to be marrying him, and she noted how youthfulness also gave way to pudgy features, making her feel less angst about her own plump lined face, could she have seen herself frowning at the photgraphs, trying her best not to allow herself the honesty of how she really felt inside.  Looking at his burnished face and blue eyes perched on the shoulder of his severely chiffon-ised child-bride, she felt nothing other than the vague sensation that his face should mean something to her. Realising that they had moved on in spite of what had gone on before that day made it clear that she had long since been left behind, other than perhaps as a startling bogey-woman talked about with disdain on occassions where the true nature of people came out from beneath lowered eyelashes and friendly expressions.

         Teenage Throwback    I'm in the process of dealing with the apparent fact that my eldest child - a fourteen and a half year old girl - has 'hooked up' with a fifteen year old boyfriend that she knew through highschool. For those of you who've never had kids or dated before you got to college / university age, that probably doesn't seem too bad - cute even - 'puppy love' as my olds used to call it. For the rest of us who started 'young' or have daughters ourselves, we know all too well that fourteen is waaaay too young to be seriously dating, and I'm sure that the guys out there know that what a fifteen year old boy is hoping to get from any girl isn't romance, kids or marriage...! To be fair, I'm sure that most teenage girls aren't thinking of the last two either - but what they get when they 'play with fire' (by setting it off in the guy's trousers LOL) more often then not will lead to the rest at some point...   Echoes from the past  Funny thing about all the worrying about what my daughter might be up to or eventually involved in (if not yet, certainly will happen eventually...) I suddenly realise - in the most poigniant way possible - that maaaaan I musta put my parents through hell...! By the time they realised  hey, these kids are serious about each other , they were already grandparents 'for the first time'...   Rebel without a clue  - Part I      "I know myself well enough to know when I'm really in love with a guy"  , she thought to herself, her mouth pouting in anger at her mother's comment about 'puppy love'. How could she explain to the dried up old husks that were her parents, that eternal life flooded through her veins, and that his touch felt like electric butterflies fluttering across her skin and down her spine?   "This IS real, and I know it WILL last forever"  , she thought, tears of anger pricking her eyes, remembering her mother grounding her for the second time in as many weeks, this time for being on the 'phone to him for more than an hour...

              Fasting      Today I'm onto my second day 'ever' of religious fasting (basically going without 'solid' food and praying for positive things at a larger scale than my immediate environs). Having two primary-school age kids who 'naturally' graze between meals makes it more apparent to me how most of us in 'first world' countries have lives that revolve around an abundant food supply... So in between focussing away from my hunger by praying for spiritual things, my thoughts today have included some interesting lessons:          Feasting      Silly that in less than 48 hours I feel impoverished already; we 'Westerners' have so much food 'on tap' that we snack between snacks and nibble on something between snacks... Our food habits seem to flow on into our spending habits in general, our eyes see it and we want it - CDs, DVDs, flash TVs, PCs, console games, leather lounge suites, flashy cars, bigger boobs, firmer body parts, bigger mansions, more money... the list goes on!          Consuming      I did something today that I haven't done in ages - when I went to buy some groceries, I stuck to my budget. Big deal I hear you say - well, just realising that even with my modest means I'm so entrenched in 'consumerism' (like everyone else!?) came as quite a surprise to me. I'm not usually aware of how often I go into a grocery shop to buy a few items and then leave with a trolley load - or use my credit card to buy something on impulse at a sale when I don't have the ready cash on me! Sure, I tell myself we really NEED this stuff, and hey, it's on sale, or I want my kids to have the kind of food/clothes/toys I missed out on as a kid? Silly, silly, shallow thoughts once I heard the sub-concious dialogue, are we all so in denial about how sold we are on buying/consuming as much as we can?          Dieting      I've never really been one to go on fad diets, or ever been a yoyo dieter, never having really had enough of an issue with my weight to bother with it - but I can see it must be a heck of a struggle for people trying to overcome obesity through dieting, and how easy it is to overeat in our society. Sure, I've wondered how it is possible for us to even relate to what it's like for those people growing up in third world countries as we see the news items on famine victims in between ads for fastfood outlets - but I can't say I'd ever felt genuine compassion for over-weight people before...          Hungering      The root of it all? Trying to fill a void, and not knowing what to fill it with... Why else do we as rational, empathic, caring beings fall for the over-indulgence and advertising cycle, whether we have plenty of resources or live in more outwardly modest situations. My answer for myself (and anyone else reading this) today is -  feed your spirit the right 'food' first, and the scales of consumerism will start to fall away from your eyes . ...Perhaps then we can begin to choose things which will bring lasting satiation/fulfilment in our lives... and break us out of the poverty in our souls that we have before now covered up with over-indulgence in the material world?

            In chronological order, the ‘memorable moments’ for us lot this past month were...     SHAVAUGHN’S FREE MOVIE PASS    Shavaughn did so well with her behaviour and ‘good school citizenship’ example that she was rewarded at the end of Term 2 with a double pass to see  Cody Banks 2  at the cinema in  Manukau . Being Shavaughn, this prize was NOT negotiable, so ‘Mum’ had less than 48 hours to organise them both on a bus trip that Saturday morning of the 26th of June, ‘or else’ *grin*.    They got there alright, and trekked back from the town centre to the allotment where the Hoyts Cinema complex is – and were quite stunned to see literally hundreds of kids and their parents lined up for the  KidsFest  morning – and we were both chuffed that at the end of the long wait in line we were both rewarded with free popcorn and cola’s each ;-).    The movie, well – not too bad (though Shavaughn scooted down in her seat during the action scenes LOL)... [I sung along enthusiastically when they played Steriogram’s " Walkie Talkie Man " during the big chase sequence though! *wink*].     ANGELINA’S TRIP TO WHANGAMATA    Found out a coupla days before Term 2 ended that Angelina’d been invited by her (new) best friend Renee to stay with her at her brother’s Nana’s pace in  Whangamata  (down in the Coromandel). So, rather than subjecting her to a fortnight in my boring old company, I agreed she could go – so she stayed overnight at Renee’s Mum’s house on Cosgrave Rd on the Friday night (the 2nd of July) before getting up ‘early’ for the long(ish) drive south-eastwards the next day...    They had one sunny day out of the 3 she was down there (it rained non-stop in Akld that week, so she was indeed in the right place LOL) so they’d gone to the beach for a swim that day... Then they watched a bootleg DVD of  Shrek2  the first day, and had an unsatisfying shop-trolling trip (due to lack of spending dosh apparently) on the last day they were down there, got home mid-afternoon on Tuesday the 6th of July.    [I got copious amounts of ‘miss you Mum, can I have more credit on my cell phone’ text messages sent to my Email while she was away and let Owen tow me along to a  King’s Cafe  evening in  Waiuku  on the Sunday I had no kids home, so I didn’t get lonely while I was sans kids for 3 whole days LOL].     SHAVAUGHN & JONATHAN'S TRIP TO NELSON    Shavaughn and Jonathan flew down to  Nelson  from the 3rd to the 15th of July, and sound like they really enjoyed the activities they got up to down there. Jonathan was rapt at getting to play lots of strategy games on Playstation2 with his Dad, and both he and Shavaughn enjoyed watching  Shrek 2  at the movies while they were there.    (Shavaughn said that Jonathan got teary eyed when  Puss-in-boots  did the puupy-dog-eyes scene, but I’d guess she’d have been the one with the trembling lip at his sincerity... ;-). On a coupla the days where Nana Glenis (20 year old 'Stepmum' Jaynie’s mother) was away on holiday, Shavaughn got to spend all day at Jaynie’s work, playing with ‘broken watch bits’ she tells me (Jonathan got to spend those days with his Dad at his work, an automotive paint shop).    [I didn’t miss them ‘til I rang them – as ordered by Shavaughn! – on the Monday evening before they came back. It’s almost like a school holiday programme now, how on earth did I ever manage to entertain 3 kids for two whole weeks back in the bad old days? LOL].     ANGELINA ‘HOOKS UP’ WITH NEW BOYFRIEND BY CELL PHONE     [Inadvertantly sneaking behind her Mum’s back in the process and getting grounded indefinitely LOL]. Welcome to anyone over 21 to the new age of how-to-hook-up with the guy/gal of your teenage dreams – Cell Phone Text Messaging!    Not having to wait ‘til school resumed, Angelina found out by ‘txt’ on Tuesday the 13th of July that her paramour  Jason  (a 15yo 5th Former she’d taken a shine to) returned her ‘luv’ (not the same as ‘love’ she tells me, so I was wrong to panic? Hmmm...) and there followed a plan for a  clandestine  meeting (after a trip with her gal pals to the shops on the afternoon Thursday the 15th) that she didn’t do and then still got caught out on by her moody mother, then reminded about the ‘boy ban’ she hadn’t (dis-?) agreed to last year...    She still meets up with him at school, but a telephone ban / can only leave home to go to school ‘grounding’ and limited txt messaging / online time stance by her Mum is slowing things down (we HOPE and pray!!!!). [I am giving up on being part of the drama, and focusing on that which I can change now, let her make her own teetering steps and be there to catch her if she falls? :-S].     VISITORS FROM FAR AFEILD    Caught up with a few people in person in the past month – some we hadn’t seen in several months, and others we had known ‘of’ for quite a while but hadn’t met in person.    We got a visit from family friend Earl (who hadn’t visited us since January LOL), and Owen’s daughter Lexie, who recently turned 12, caught up with us while visiting with her Dad for the school holidays, which is when we also got to meet his ‘betrothed’ Lana and her three children, Melanie(14), Sara (15) and Johnathan (10). [While Earl braved a coupla hours drive from  Awhitu  on the Manukau Penninsula, Lexie’s flight was from  Palmerston North , with Lana and the kids winging their way up from  Invercargill !].    Owen’s guests bunked down at his landlady’s place in  Papakura , while Earl was close enough to drive home after 2am in the morning LOL... We had a DVD/video evening at my place with Owen & his whole immediate family on the 16th of July - my kids enjoyed his ’n’ her kid’s company for sure, and I had a good yarn with Lana about the joys of parenting teenage daughters! *grin*.    My children challenged Earl to a  Go Fish  tournament after he’d visited for dinner on the 17th of July – though with Earl’s unique slant on things, he managed to get all 3 of my kids singing " Fishy fishy in the sea,.do you have [a card] for me " in a sing song voice – you can bet Shavaughn loved it, and even Angelina had a youthful grin on her face, Jonathan happy he won a gam this time! [And I was just smiling at how happy and relaxed the children were at the end of the holidays].     CALL OF THE SOUTHERN CLIMES    We had a coupla ‘big’ changes in our circle of family/friends up here recently! Our family friend Kathleen and her family (including Shavaughn’s old friend Amy) moved south to  Hamilton  after the 25th of June, as her husband Shaun arranged to get his job transferred there. She has rung a couple of times since, and it was great to hear that the four of them have found a lifestyle closer to the one they collectively envisaged for themselves, nicer nieghbourhood, kindergartens/schools and rental costs!    Then my cousin Owen ‘permanently’ left the local area on the 17th of July to head back to  Southland  - to get to know his wife-to-be Lana and her 3 children better (they live in Invercargill), and to take up a dairy farming job.with 600 cows to oversee!      MARLA GETS A REAL JOB    Well, almost! *grin*. Second day the kids were back at school (on the 20th of July), Jonathan and Shavaughn’s school’s Deputy Principal caught up with me about my having told them last term that I’d be interested in helping out at school during term time... So the NEXT day I was ‘on board’, observing / helping out salaried Teacher Aides in a coupla different classes in the mornings with the school’s  Numeracy Programme .    They’ve signed me up as a  Volunteer Teacher Aide , and for this term I’ll be following around / helping out Angela in Room 9 (Year 3/4) between 9-9.50am Mon-Fri, and then Lorainne in Room 15 (Year 1/2) between 9.50-10.40am Mon-Fri. Quite a big commitment required from me time-wise (it’s already meant I’ll have to give  MAPS  and  Mother’s Group  a miss this term at least) though I am REALLY enjoying it heaps already, and it’s cool to be able to translate some of what I’ve learnt as a parent into a work-relevant frame of reference – and to be learning the practical skills BEFORE the academic /abstract first this time ‘round ;-).    Other ‘News in Brief’ –     Jonathan Impresses His Teacher With Awesome Graphics In Homework Emails Done So Far : Since arranging with his teacher to Email set homework each week, Jonathan has been able to ‘show off’ his flair for computer –aided design and graphics. His class teacher has hopes the lad will be a REAL geek soon, and his maths teacher is looking at ways of using this good news to assist in Jonathan’s maths learning via computer too. Jonathan’s excellent community/school behaviour last term meant he had also won a free double pass to see Shrek 2 at the movies...!     Shavaughn Wins Massey Pool Pass : For completing ALL her reading homework last term, Shavaughn scored a free Pass to the local wave pool. She's hoping Mum remembers to take her before the thing expires in November! ;-)     Angelina Aces Australasian Schools English Competition :  NEWSFLASH  – Just found out today that Angelina got very high marks in the afforementioned competition, recieving a ‘Credit’ mention having been placed in the 80th Percentile amongst all Year 10 Entrants around NZ. (That translates into a score of 63/80).    Well, that’s about it from us lot for another 'Email Update' – hope you enjoyed it as much as ‘we’ did in bringing it to you. Added bonus for those of you who like pictures with their story, as most of the photos Emailed with this ‘copy’ relate to the tales we’ve ‘published’! *cheesey grin*    Anyhows, you can bet there’s a whole lot more going on behind the scenes, though I’ve tried to cover the highlights, words can’t express how blessed I am to be a part of such an enthusiastic and unpredicatably unique bunch of kids. (Oops, that’s right, I’m a grown up! *blushes*).     Marla Jane

         I have already waited so long, waited for something to happen, and it’s getting harder and harder to put on a brave face, wait for a day that might never come, that day when I finally have lasting happiness...     She walked along the footpath, trying not to cry outloud, yet wanting the tears that threatened to come to simply rain down, to give her just cause to feel the way she wanted to feel. The ties from her back pack flicked at her hips as she walked, and reminded her that she would soon be carrying a load of groceries home again, no one to carry it for her, even if she would ask for their help.      It’s not that I don’t believe that it’s nice to believe in something – I’m just not sure that something would want to believe in me. I’m not worthy of a better life, I kinda blew those chances already, and I deserve to be without lasting hope. It’s okay to hope for better for my kids, for my friends – but, for me, it hurts too much to ask for more...     That familiar internal struggle between hope and surrender, belief and apathy – how many times has each of us tried to find a sense of balance when our emotional compass is ‘out of whack’ with the reality we see / feel around us? How to escape that sense of fatalistic futility, the one that is loosely based on past experience but more solidly built as a wall to prevent future disappointments...     Even if I actually met someone, someone nice, someone who wanted to be with me, it wouldn’t last – it never does. He’d get sick of me, the sweetness would fade, and he’d just get more and more annoyed at me (and me at him) until he left. Maybe that’s why I chose to believe in a guy who was on Earth 2000 years ago – at least His words and actions stood the test of time... All the men in this world I live in have simply failed to defend me, or be indignant at what others have put me through, broken promises to protect me, love me, and never turn their back on me...    Tears pricked at the edges of her frown, their needles of frustration reminding her of the words of a hard rock song, where the man harshly proclaims how he will hurt the guy who hurt his woman / daughter / sister, and she wonders why that is what she wanted all these years. Her thoughts turn to Him, His gentle hands reaching out for her, offering not retribution but eternal love. Somehow she had momentarily lost the strength to lift her gaze to meet His, as instead she tried to become like the grey clouds hanging low across the horizon, marring what had started out as a light-hearted, sunny winter’s day.   It’s not about ‘Me’ – It’s about Him, what He wants me to be, what He has already given me, the blessings I take for granted every day, letting go of my own egoistic thoughts and trusting in Him with all my life, no more holding back.    Feeling the weight shift from off of her shoulders, she quickened her pace, deciding to remain in the here and now, where she belonged... And, yes, she got through her immediate task, returning with the backpack over-full yet with the hint of a smile dancing on her face even as a light rain began to fall - and I can assure you that even before she arrived at her destination, a rainbow arched above the street ahead, guiding her  home ...
