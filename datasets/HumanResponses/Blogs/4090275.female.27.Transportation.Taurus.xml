      It's a Saturday night and I'm at home. Big surprise. I could have gone out, but I just didn't' feel like being bothered, you know? Some days I'd rather sit in my place on my couch with my TV and my books and just veg. So my place is a mess, and I could be cleaning. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I need to hit the lottery. Then I could hire somebody to come in and do all of this sh*t for me. I'm not lazy...just TIRED!  Actually one of my girls just left....she was "talking" to me about my current situation with an ex-flame. Why does it seem like that is all people talk to me about these days? Am I that desolate and destined for sadness? You know...you know how everything is SO hard when you're trying to get over someone? And people feel sorry for you because you're not your "normal" self? Yup...that's me. I have my good days and my bad days. Today was in the middle. I know...stop thinking about it, everything happens for a reason....yeah, yeah, yeah.  I'll keep it short tonight...my TV and book are calling. I'll close my eyes to go to sleep and hopefully I won't think about "him". Yeah right.

      So this is a blog? *looking around* Nice, nice. Who, knew? My girl and I have been doing this for YEARS. Literally. We email back and forth all day..write scripts, talk about men, work, drama...and never knew we could put it "out there" for people to see. We decided to do this because our friends are always telling us that our writing style is great, and that we're hilarious. Personally, I think we should get paid for our talent, but until that happens, we'll just try to entertain the masses. Big ups to I_Boogie. If I knew how to do that link thingie, I would put it in...she's under Sublime October. She's the one that actually got us intereted in blogging. My girl (let's call her X, because I'm tired of referring to her as "my girl"...somebody might start to get the wrong idea)...anyhoo,  urlLink X  stumbled upon her site, and we read EVERY post on there. They were wonderful, and she sounds so much like us on an average day that it was downright eerie.  Anyhoo enough of the background stuff...I'm at work, and I'm ret' to go. I have a little too much energy right now because I'm sipping a Mocha from da 'bucks. Oh, I'm sorry...Starbucks. I love that place. I know I could go to 7-11 and get a coffee or "fake-*ss french vanilla" for like .90 cents, but it's just not the same. Call me bougie. *shrug* Everyone else does. We went to Starbucks after lunch, then we tripped and fell into DSW (for the uninformed, that is a shoe warehouse). I know, I know...how long was my lunch break? Don't even ask. I tried on some SICK shoes, but I didn't buy any. Today was payday, but I paid the mortgage, so I acted like I had some sense. Yeah, I said mortgage. " If you feelin' like a pimp n*gga gon' brush yo' shoulder's off ". Yeah..baby girl is doing her thang. I had to man...rent is a JOKE. I can't do that anymore...I was tired of Uncle Sam bending me over every year. Woops....did I say that out loud? Sorry.  Hey! I just figured out how to do links! Here is the  urlLink site  to the "Holy Land", a.k.a. I_boogie's site...she's great...read her if you have a chance. Hmm...I hope she doesn't get mad....perhaps I should have asked her for permission first? I guess that's it for now. Thanks for checking me out...leave some comments man. I know it's not a lot to comment on, but now that I've gotten started, watch out world!  Lata

      Everyone has guy problems. Hell, even guys have guy problems. When you have one of these aforementioned problems, what happens? All of your friends/family rally around you to lift your spirits, and say "appropriate" things. That's all nice and gay, but sometimes you don't WANT to HEAR all of that shit! Sometimes, you just want to be left the fug alone. I was discussing this with my girl/soror/sisterfriend  urlLink X  one day, and we decided that we should write a book about this very topic. She had just finish giving me advice on HIM, and I responded with "blah blah blah" or some other educated response. I then said that we should write a book called   "The Annoying Shit People Say To You When You're Down &amp; Don't Want To Hear It".   She agreed, and off we went! Well....fortunately, you won't have to wait for the book to be published to have an idea of the type of guidance we will offer (LOL...I crack myself up sometimes). Here, is the official "World Premier" *DJ Clue voice echoes in background* of our things that people say, when you really wish they would just shut the hell up after you've been screwed, dumped, fugged over, cheated on, abused, crushed, pimped, impregnated, or left by that special someone:    Look on the bright side....  You're healthy, not homeless, beautiful, and funny....  Things could always be worse.  Keep your head up, it will pass.  We all go through things...as a matter of fact, I {insert story here}.  You have to love yourself before you can love someone else.  You'll meet him when you least expect it...when you're not looking.  I've been there...I wasn't looking and look at me now.  Everything happens for a reason.  When you meet him, you'll know.  Maybe this will be good for you.  One day, you'll look back on this and laugh.  Why don't you just take some time for yourself.  Maybe you should just be by yourself for awhile.  You don't need a man to validate you.  In the end, it's your life.  Maybe it's you.  At least he was man enough to tell you!  You're still young!  Just keep busy and concentrate on other things.  Do you see a pattern?  Do you ever ask yourself why you're in this situation?  Just pray on it.  Come on out with me and {insert husband, boyfriend, sig other, etc's name here}.  Stop being so down, you have to think positive (minus the "ly" that is grammatically required).  You must be sending off some type of signals, even if not verbally.  I think you should just leave it/him alone, but it's your life.  I'll introduce you to {insert any male within 20 mile radius).  What exactly are you looking for, anyway?  He/It wasn't worth your time anyway.  You're such a pretty girl...{insert disbelief because of physical attributes here}.  I don't understand why you're settling.  Is the d*ck THAT good?  Girl, you're better than me because I wouldn't tolerate that...(usually said after she has a new man and conveniently forgets her ex-man who used to whip her ass and cheat on her at will...in some rare cases, this is actually said WHILE being with the ass whipper/cheater).  Girl being in a relationship is not that important...you need to concentrate on yourself (usually followed by, "girl let me go cuz my husband's home and he's taking me out to dinner to celebrate the first time he held my hand. He's so romantic. Cheer up girl, bye!").   There you have it...your official sneak preview. We're serious about this book damnit...maybe we should have this copywritten....hmm. We'll probably group the topics together and expound on them in chapters. Yeah, that's it. Well that's it...I look forward to your comments on this one! Lata....

      I witnessed the most humbling and outstanding show of talent on Friday, that I'm still a tad bit emotional about it today. On Friday, I saw Prince in concert. MY GOD!! I've never seen him before. For years I've said that Sade's "Lover's Rock" tour was the best concert I had ever seen. This easily knocked her out of the top spot. He was simply unbelievable. It may sound weird, but I didn't even feel worthy enough to be there witnessing that magic! It's really hard to explain...if he's coming to your city and there are still tickets left, GO!  I have a baby shower to attend today..and I still don't have the gift. Triflin' right? Luckily, I live right down the street from Tarjay and that's where the mommy is registered. My plan was to get up early and clean my house, wash clothes, etc before I left. Wellll....the morning's almost over and I haven't done a damn thing yet. *sigh* Why can't I just get up and do it? *shrug* I couldn't tell ya. I have to wash because I'm going out of town next weekend and I'll be packing NOTHING because a lot of stuff is dirty! Speaking of traveling...whew...these next few months are going to hit me in the pockets, for real. I have Boston next weekend, Hawaii next month (Muffin I'm definitely going to holla), and a wedding in Florida in October. I need a second job! It'll all be worth it though. I've never been to Boston, and one of my best friends from college is up there. Hawaii...that's my vacation and I'm in need BADLY for that trip! Florida will be great because I just went to Miami for the first time over Memorial Day, and I'll be only an hour away for the wedding. Roadtrip!!!  So about new dude...let's call him...uhh....hey, DUDE works for me. Don't want to get him confused with HIM (who I haven't spoken to in 2 weeks...I'm so proud of myself). So, DUDE and I ended up not seeing each other at all. After the lunch fiasco went South, I told him I would meet him at the Metro station for a quick hello, face to face. Welll...Bonnie had other plans. Hurricane Bonnie, that is. She came through, or her remnants, rather, right when we were about to meet. So, he called me and told me to postpone, and that he would call me later. So, fast forward. He calls me that night, and told me that he completely understood why I made the decision that I made (to not pick him up). He admitted that he was offended, but that if he had a sister or daughter he would want her to do the same thing. The more he thought about it, the more he realized I had done right. And, he said he was impressed because not only did I have book smarts, I have street smarts. Mmhmm. I've come to this conclusion....either this dude has mad game and is a good liar, or he's the catch of a lifetime. His job is good, he dabbles in music on the side and has dropped some impressive names (remember, I sing), he seems to be a gentleman, he's attractive, and he knows how to hold a conversation. We shall see...if it is game, I'm not the one! Lata...

      Ok, I'm *using fingers as quotes* "working" so we'll make this quick:   I'm going to Hawaii! We make our big ol' payment tomorrow! I'm so excited! We'll discuss that more later.  I'm the best daughter in the world...I took my "virginal" tour of Ebay and decided to try to surprise my daddy with football tickets for his birthday! I've lived in the DC area for 5 years, and I've been telling him we would go...just hadn't made it happen. Well.....*drumroll*....I am now the proud owner of two tickets to the Monday night Dallas/Redskins game! I am so excited! So is he....he was so excited he dropped the phone and my mom had to finish the conversation. I'm an only child, but I LOVE sports....she told me I've made him the happiest man in VA, and I'm the son he never had. *sniff* Hand me a tissue Tito.  Ok, so I ventured into the world of internet matchmaking. Shut up. Just thought I would try it for a month to see what happens. Met a guy, exchanged pics (VERY attractive), and we've had some REALLY good conversations....we were supposed to meet for lunch today. So I call him to coordinate the time and location, and long story short, he wanted me to come get him? *sigh* He's divorced, and basically got taken to the cleaners, lost his job (but he's working again now) and everything. So he's slowly getting back on his feet...ex-wifey took the car and everything. I don't have a problem with that. I'm supportive...I have big shoulders. But coming to get you after 2 conversations? That's just not smart. He was a little offended, but hey, I have to use my head. I'm a single woman living in a metropolitan area. Anyhoo, I'm going to meet him at the train station before his class (grad school). We'll see what happens. I got up early to do my hair, makeup, put on a new outfit, shoes, handbag...the whole nine. He's going to see this chick today!  I'm going to see Prince tomorrow. That should be a good show...even though I've heard that now due to religious reasons he won't do ALL of his old stuff. Does that mean no "Erotic City"? Damnit I LOVE that song!   I think that's it for now...I just needed to get that stuff off of my chest. This is pretty much our last week of Fiscal Year End stuff...thank goodness. I thought I was going to do bodily harm to some folks up in here this week. Lata!

      You know, yesterday was great. Yes, I had to go to work (shhh...I got there late and left early), but it turned out to be a really nice day. Why, do you ask? 'Cause I went SHOPPING! I, being the strong woman that I am, can admit that I have a problem. I know I do. I love to shop. I just can't help it. I mean, I was strolling through the mall yesterday just a smilin'....  It was perfect because I totally devoted yesterday to ME. That may sound crazy, but I just spent the day with myself, nah mean? No celly glued to my ear, no 2way beeping every 4.2 seconds...just me. It was definitely all about me yesterday. A couple of salespeople tried to play me, but it's ok. I guess I wasn't "dressed the part" to strut up in Gucci EVEN THOUGH I had one of their bags on my shoulder. Silly me. How dare I go in there in a skirt and *gasp* flip flops? I noticed the attitude right off, so I swung THEIR bag down off of my right shoulder and onto my left shoulder just to be a b*tch and make a statement. What makes it even worst (or worse...who the hell knows right now *shrug*) was that the two BROTHAS were the ones acting shady. The little white girl was just as nice as pie. That's ok. They work on commission so I f*cked with them. I sat my big beautiful bag on the counter just so they could stare at it while I asked to see a wallet. When one of "them" realized I was serious, he became a little friendly. He also tried to hide his surprise when I NAMED a few of the items on the shelf. Don't play me. Please. I promise you will NOT win. I am a style and accessories WHORE. Handbags are my life. And don't even get me started on shoes....but I digress. Of course, I didn't buy a damn thing. I don't care how fly that little change purse was, they weren't getting my money. Reminds me of the day the German b*tch in Macy's in LI (Long Island, NY for those of you that don't know) tried to play me over a Louis bag. I pointed to it and was about to ask for it by name and she goes, with a smirk on her face, "It's $730.00." I replied, "I don't recall asking you how much it costs, it's the Sonitane, and I would like to see it PLEASE." *evil smile* Well after I told Miss Chicky the name of the damn thing she almost broke her neck to get it for me. Hmph..she didn't even know what she was talking about 'cause that bag is NOT $730.  Anyhoo, back to yesterday. People, when I tell you that I know understand the terminology "shop 'til you drop", I mean I TRULY know what that means. I was SO tired by the time I got home that I slept through like 3 phone calls, on the couch (you know I had to throw that in there...love that thing) with the TV, light...EVERYTHING on all night. I got some good deals though. The sales were everywhere, and they were CRAZY. They were damn near giving merchandise away. Then I tripped and fell into Nine West and was pushed back out the door with a pair of shoes. Woops. I was so soundly sleeping last night that I tried to answer the phone and couldn't even do that right. My friend is on my answering machine screaming "HELLO? DID YOU JUST HANG UP ON ME?" LOL...I'm going to save that for a good laugh on one of my "bad" days. I recommend that everyone do a day "all about them". Eat the food you like, do something that makes you insanely happy...just DO YOU!

      *Doing cabbage patch* It's Friday, it's Friday!!! *stopping abruptly* Damn...I have to work tomorrow. *sigh* Explain to me again why an accountant needs to work on a Saturday? Right. Uh huh. They just started this crap at my job...because we support locations that are open on Saturday, somebody has to be there from the accounting department "just in case". Umm...can I tell you that we NEVER get calls on Saturday? They don't even know we're there! True, it's only like once every couple of months because we all take turns, and it's only from 9-12, but STILL! It's the principality of the situation! When you work 9 or 10 hours every friggin' day during the week, the weekend is all you have! Damn! Lord &amp; Taylor is having a huge sale and I can't start shopping until AFTER work? Blasphemy! Please believe that I'm going to roll in there with my book and plenty of music. Hmph.   I need a vacation. Can we talk about that? I haven't had one since last August...my first cruise. That was the best week of my life. If you haven't been on one, GO. It's worth every penny. I wanted to go on another one this year, but due to some unforeseen emotional issues (I went with HIM last year) I think it's wise that I wait until next year to do another one. We're thinking about going to Hawaii in a couple of months instead. Wait, wait...before you start calling me names, lemme explain.  urlLink Travelzoo  has weekly specials, right? Well, this week they have a Hawaii flight and hotel special from Newark for 5 nights for $499. Come on now! How can we pass that up? A flight alone to Hawaii costs more than that! And I checked it out...it's not some crappy hotel...okay, the $499 package includes some hotel that only has 1.5 stars. ANNNNK. Did I mention that my nickname is "Princess"?? Well, Princess found out that for another $100, we can stay at a 4 star. Right. That's a little better. We have until the 18th to book it, so I think we're going to do it! I have to do something...between my job, personal, and "relationship" drama...if I don't get a break away from HERE I'm going to hurt someone. Yes, I go on my weekend jaunts...New York, Boston in a few weeks, home to see the folks in VA. But those don't count as true "vacations". I'm talking get my hair braided, go lay my ass on somebody's beach with somebody's book and get pissy drunk during the day. THAT is a vacation.   So I told you I got a new cell phone right? I am SO geeked right now. Why did I just find out yesterday that I can talk to the damn thing and it will do stuff? You know how the old phones had voice dial, but you had to speak the name in the phone, and then punch in the number? Well, Samsung has stepped their game up. Now you don't have to pre-record anything. You can either say "name dial" and it will find the name from your address book, or "digit dial" and speak the digits and it will connect. Oh, and if the name in your address book has more than one entry, it will ask "which number"? And if it can't understand the name you say, it'll ask you all o the names that rhyme with it. Isn't that the GREATEST? I'm not even going to tell you how many times I've almost slammed into the back of somebody on the road trying to look up a number. You can also say "status" to find out your signal and battery strength. I LOVE electronics!   I just heard that Rick James passed...that is SO crazy to me. Of course, I didn't know the man personally...but I still said "WOW". He was just on TV...singin' with Teena at the BET Awards. That's really sad...the man was only 56. I wonder if Dave Chappelle feels bad now for the skits? Before I get hate mail.....I LOVE Dave Chappelle. I can probably quote every episode from the 2nd season. I'm just sayin'....that skit is what made him a household name (in some people's opinion), and it was poking fun at Mr. James. I'm glad Dave got his $50 mil. He's a funny dude. The Wayne Brady episode....*shaking head*...just ridiculous.   Well, it's Friday night, and you know my routine. The couch, the TV, the book. Especially since I have to work tomorrow. I've grown rather tired of the "club" scene anyhow. I still like to go every now and then to shake "it", but not tonight. Just picked up three books from the library so I'm good. The new Eric Jerome Dickey is one of them...hopefully it's as good as his last one, "The Other Woman". That joint had me GOIN'! *craning neck* Huh? Oh, here I come! Ok...the couch is callin'.....lata.....

      You like me! You really like me! *sniff* I'm so excited because I got comments from people on my posts. Yay! That'll motivate my lazy *ss to write more often!  I'm going to apologize ahead of time for the next few weeks...it's fiscal year end at my job, and I'm in accounting, so it's about to get ugly! I'm going to do my best to keep up with my blogs...hell, I'll probably need this as an outlet because I'm sure I'll be pissed off at LEAST once a day.  *sigh* So, I have a quasi-dilemma. Well, not really, because it's not really MY problem, but I still feel involved. Without going into the grimy details, I'll just say this: I have a friend that is in a "situation" that she doesn't need to be in. No physical abuse, cheating, or anything like that....they just have ISSUES. Neither one of them see it because they're IN it...you know what I mean? You know how a lot of times when you have relationship drama you can't see it, but all of your friends call you every kind of idiot because it's so crystal clear to them? That's the deal with them. I'm close to both of them, and I want them both to be happy...whether it is with each other or with other people. I'm just trying to not be nosy and overbearing with my opinions. When solicited, I give advice, but I try to stay out of it for the most part. I don't know...I guess I just needed to get that little bit off of my chest. I feel better now.  So what else is going on? *shrug* Nothing much...the rest of my weekend was cool....I ended up talking to HIM..we're supposed to be having dinner soon. That ought to be interesting. I'm bitter. I can admit it. I even told him that....I sometimes think that my next tattoo (yes, I have ink) is going to be "F*CK LOVE". Hmph. Stop laughing...I ain't playin! Don't EVEN get me started on that subject...I could fill up the whole dayum INTERNET. I'll just say this for the curious....he and I are perfect together, but he has some issues that need to be worked out before we can progress. So, we're "friends" right now. That's the long and short. Of course there are a TON more details, but that's the gist. When I say I'm bitter, I don't mean over him specifically, I mean in general. But, it's all talk, I know that as soon as a tall, thick, chocolate brotha walks by me I'll be whipping my head around like I've been slapped and adjusting the cleavage. It's all good.  I got a new cell phone over the weekend....I have Sprint, so no further explanation needed. I hate them....there service is decent, and my plan is excellent, but their phones! Good grief! Why the f*ck do I need a phone with a camera, a camcorder, and a walkie talkie? It's a PHONE for Pete's sake! I just want to TALK on it! Anyhoo, I had to act out a little in Best Buy...I have a warranty and they tried to play me. They OBVIOUSLY didn't know who they were dealing with. Talkin' about I have to pay the difference on a new phone when my old one fell apart and I bought their 2 year warranty? WTF? I have one foot in law school...don't play me. I strutted over to the customer service desk and had a lil' "talk" with the manager...needless to say I got my sh*t without coming out of my pocket. Hmph.  Oh, today is X's birthday....I don't know if she's going to do a birthday post, but drop her shoutty on her  urlLink site ....  That's it for now. Massa is callin'. *sigh* Will somebody PLEASE help me hit the lottery???
