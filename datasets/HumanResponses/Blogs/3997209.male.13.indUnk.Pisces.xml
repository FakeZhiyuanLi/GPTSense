      Hey. Its me. My step sister Jill is a total witch (edited for the censors). The internet was brocken on the main computer, so, she asks Brandon if she can use his computer, but he was on it. So trying to be a nice STEP-brother I say she can use my computer, all the sudden she doesnt want to get on the internet. Its not just that its other things, like, she treats me like dirt. She thinks I'm spoiled when ever time she says "lets go shopping" she gets to go, when I say&nbsp;we should go somewhere, thay say no. I hate her. I was Brandon was my only Step-sibling. Well gotta go. :~)

      Your not gonna beleive this, but Brandon and I actually bonded! It started as him showing me a guitar song, then I was playing it, and three hours later, we relised we had bonded. Well, gotta go. :~)

      My STEP-brother (emphesis on the word STEP (thank goodness)) thinks I'm a little self absorbed brat. NOT TRUE! He thinks because I was an only child&nbsp;I got everything I wanted. NOT TRUE. My mom and I&nbsp;were as poor as a rats (edit). I got things because of my grandma, who he thinks is over loving and spoils me. Also, NOT....wait, maybe that is true. But still! He can&nbsp;bite my&nbsp;(edit) He is an&nbsp;ugly little... no wait, BIG&nbsp;(edit) hole!&nbsp;His website (curtis6387.blogspot.com) is called his Soapboxx (Stupid). Iguess I can't talk though, mine is Called My Little Teapot. :~)

      Hey. Its me, of course. Sorry I haven't been on lately. So my friend Tyler came over and brought over Grand Theft Auto: Vice City for Playstation 2. 1 Word: Sweet. I had played GTA3 before but I didn't like it very well because it was so dark. Also, I got to see my two baby cousins, Ashton and Jacob. Ashton is a year and 3 months, and Jacob is 2 months old. Well G2G. :~)
