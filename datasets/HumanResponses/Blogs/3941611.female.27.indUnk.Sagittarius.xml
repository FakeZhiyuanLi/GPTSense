      Okay...let me say before I get started here, I'm not endorsing this Republican.&nbsp; I can't stand Republicans and all of their "Compassionate Conservative" bullshit.   That being said....have you heard about Jack Ryan, former Republican candidate for the Illionois U.S. Senate race?&nbsp; Check out the article here:  urlLink http://www.cnn.com/2004/ALLPOLITICS/06/25/il.ryan/ &nbsp;and be as annoyed as I am, PLEASE!!!!   I am damn tired of this country's obsession with the bed partners of our political leaders.&nbsp; I don't care who the president is screwing as long as it's not me.&nbsp; And it's not.&nbsp;&nbsp; Never has been.&nbsp; And it is not you or the other&nbsp;290 some-odd million people who live in this country.&nbsp; And even if it were, it doesn't affect their ability to lead or make intelligent decisions.&nbsp;&nbsp; I don't vote for a candidate based on what I think about his or her sex life and neither should you.&nbsp; It flat out doesn't matter.&nbsp; What matters is where a candidate stands on issues important to you and what he or she can do to make your life as an American citizen better.   We don't pay these people for what they do in their personal lives, we pay them for what they do professionally.&nbsp; So, as long as your Senator isn't charging his afternoon with a prostitute to the American people, why do you&nbsp;care?&nbsp; Why do we spend so much time discussing "character issues" instead of things that truly matter in this world?&nbsp; I've known a great many kind, intelligent&nbsp;and thoughtful human beings with questionable bedroom ethics...haven't you?&nbsp;   Our&nbsp;leaders&nbsp;have to answer to the people for decisions made regarding public policies, but what goes on in their personal lives, on the time they spend living the lives to which they are entitled isn't my business and it's not yours either.   &nbsp;

      Recently there was an incident on a Northwest Airlines flight that made me both glad to be white and sympathetic to our fellow Americans of Middle Eastern descent in these fear-crazed times in which we live.&nbsp; According to an eye-witness account that you can find here,  urlLink http://womenswallstreet.com/WWS/article_landing.aspx?titleid=1&amp;articleid=711 ,&nbsp;&nbsp;14 men described as Middle-Eastern, boarded the plane, apparently together, carrying musical instrument cases and horror of horrors, a McDonald's bag.&nbsp; These men, once on the plane, began in engage in "suspicious behavior."&nbsp; They went to the bathroom and congregated together as one might expect people who knew each other might.  As it turned out, the men did know each other, the 14 of them being members of a Syrian band.&nbsp; The suggestion that they were conducting a "dry-run" to practice terror attacks, however, has no basis in fact.&nbsp; Their stories all checked out and they were allowed to go their way, after being interrogated by officials.&nbsp;  Now, having traveled with large groups of people myself, I know that their behavior (especially when one takes into account the fact that they must have felt uncomfortable knowing themseleves to be under suspicion) isn't out of the ordinary.&nbsp; When you are traveling with a large group of people, you tend to congregate toward each other.&nbsp; I think it would have been more suspicious if the men, who were clearly together, kept to themselves and pretended not to know one another.  I suspect that if the band members had been of any other nationality they would have gone unnoticed, despite their "bizarre behavior," and quite frankly, that scares me.&nbsp; It reminds me of what happened to the Japanese in this country during WWII.&nbsp; There may very well be terrorists still active in the U.S.&nbsp; but are we really going to start suspecting every group of Mid-eastern descent of some sort of villainy?&nbsp; Should I start arming myself when going to visit my Iranian sister-in-law and her Mid-Eastern family?  The answer, of course, is no.&nbsp; And we, as Americans have a responsibilty to stand up and say..."No, we will not allow our fellow Americans to be treated with this sort of discrimination."&nbsp; Because, like it or not, there are many Americans that aren't blond-haired and blue-eyed, and after all, isn't that they whole idea behind America, the melting pot.&nbsp;   The terrorists have already won if we allow them to set us against one another on the basis of race or creed.&nbsp; It is only by standing together and demanding equal civil rights for ALL AMERICANS that we can win the war on terror.

      Over the last three years we have seen this "War on Terrror" escalate from retaliatory strikes to what the Bush administration is now calling preemptive strikes based on "reliable intelligence."&nbsp; Now, is this the same reliable intelligence that Bush used to justify the war in Iraq?&nbsp; The reliable intelligence that had us all waiting for the announcement that they had found weapons of mass destruction, or at least the facilities in which to manufacture them.&nbsp; And then announcement never came.&nbsp; And here's something to think about for those who believe that we just haven't found them yet...If we can find one man hiding underground in a bunker, we can find nuclear or biological agent facilities. &nbsp; And now George and Co. are mocking Kerry for suddenly joining Bush in his support of preemptive strikes.&nbsp;&nbsp; But let's take a look at what Kerry actually said...&nbsp; 'Am I prepared as president to go get them before they get us if we locate them and have the sufficient intelligence? You bet I am,'&nbsp;&nbsp;  Well...no shit. &nbsp; Look, I'm opposed to&nbsp;violence.&nbsp; But, I don't think that if someone said to me..."We know that so and so is coming to kill you on this day at this time..." that I would sit there and say, well, okay, if that's what they feel they need to do.&nbsp; I think that's what Kerry is really saying.&nbsp; He's not saying, let's go kill a bunch of people in the middle east because they might not like us and probably want bad things to happen to us.&nbsp; He's saying if we know that there is an attack planned, we should probably stop it.&nbsp;&nbsp; This is just common sense. &nbsp; We will never win this "War on Terror."&nbsp; Even with all of our money and power and influence, there are always going to be people who don't want to bow to American idealogies and resent American interference.&nbsp;&nbsp; What we can do to combat terror is to look at our foreign policies and see places where we are stepping on the backs of other countries to protect our own interests and maybe back off a bit.&nbsp; Because no matter what George and Co. try to tell you....this war isn't about human rights and protecting the mass population of the middle east from a few tryrants, it's about looking after our own oil interests and Bush's need to blow things up.

      Last night, while watching one of the many news networks that I have suddenly become obsessed with, I saw the latest ad,  Family Priorities,  for our brainless leader's re-election campaign (you can find it here:  urlLink http://www.georgewbush.com/VideoAndAudio/ ). &nbsp; The Bush campaign is slamming Kerry for protecting reproductive rights and saying that Kerry is sabatoging a parent's right to know what's going on in their kids lives.&nbsp; Okay, so yes, parents should know what's going on in their kid's lives, but most don't.&nbsp; Most parents have no idea and alot of kids go out of their way to hide things from their parents, particularly things that would upset their parents, for instance.....teenaged&nbsp;pregnancies. &nbsp; How many times have we turned on the news to hear about another baby found dumped in the trash?&nbsp; How many American teenagers have hidden unwanted pregnancies to the distressing end of murdering these newborn babies because for some unknown reason, abortions weren't sought?&nbsp; Parents who are conservative and outspoken against abortion and or teenage pregnancies want the right to decide what to do for their children in the event of a pregnancy.&nbsp; But kids hide things that upset their parents...so why should we not give these kids another choice?&nbsp; Something they can see as a viable option to not pissing off their parents and destroying their lives.&nbsp; After all, I'm sure most&nbsp;sensible human beings&nbsp;would agree that a morning after pill is alot safer and makes more sense than hidden pregnancies and deliveries and the subsequent murder of the newborn. &nbsp; If Bush doesn't want these kids to have access other options,&nbsp;then fine....I say we start a grassroots effort to get these teenage moms to dump their unwanted babies on his doorstep, instead of any handy dumpster.&nbsp; Maybe&nbsp;being knee-deep in abandoned babies will be enough to penetrate his thick skull....

      Yesterday, our senators did something that I can actually applaud.&nbsp; They&nbsp;did not vote to advance &nbsp;the proposed amendment to the constitution banning same-sex marriages.&nbsp; The idiot (I mean our president) says this is only the beginning of the fight and has issued a plea for The House to advance it.  &nbsp;  Let me ask you, do you think the president really cares whether we queers do our copulating with or without sanction from the government?&nbsp; Because I'm not sure that he does.&nbsp; It seems like alot of smoke being blown over what the administration doesn't want you to think about...and rather reminds me of  The Wizard of Oz  --or really any cut-rate illusionist...look over here at this stupid issue that we're going to make the center of media attention rather than the disaster that is currently happening overseas.  &nbsp;  I could be as upset as most of the rest of the gay community about this, but I'm not for two reasons...1) I don't believe that it'll ever pass Congress because most people seem to think that while gay marriage may be wrong, a constitutional amendment banning it goes too far, and 2) I don't think that this thing will go any further after November, even if the idiot somehow gets re-elected...Bush is&nbsp;more interested in playing with his toy soldiers and tanks to let this be more than just a stupid re-election stunt.

      Well, as anyone following the news know now, the last several days have set back the gay rights movement about ten years.  First, San Francisco mayor, Newsom, is told he overstepped bounds allowing gay couples to be issued marriage licenses, then those marriages were nullified by the California Supreme Court.  Then New Jersey governer James McGreevey steps down after admitting he is gay.   And today the fall-out from his  urlLink coming-out .  This is not even a case of one step forward, two steps back.  This proves to all those in the far-right that they have the right and privelige to discriminate against gays with no repercussions.  And what is the governer of New Jersey doing, using his sexuality to step down from his office?  Is this an admission that gays are somehow incapable of holding public office, or just an admission that the American people have the right to know about what happens in the private sex lives of our elected officials?  I am ashamed of America for allowing this to happen.  It is bad enough that gays are not given the civil rights they deserve, now you're telling us that we don't matter at all.  What a glorious day.

      After 9/11 we were in a heightened state of mourning and fear that we had never experienced in our lifetimes.   The only thing comparable in recent history is the bombing of Pearl Harbor, something that happened long before I was born and when most of our leaders were small children or not yet born.  It was the first time that we, the invincable Americans understood that we too could be harmed by militants on our own soil and we had, for the first time, a taste of what those in the mid-east and Africa and other underdeveloped areas live daily.  We understood what it meant to be afraid.  For the first time in my life, I felt my patriotism so strongly that anything connected to the U.S. at the time seemed to be an ultimate good.  And while I didn't agree with the choice to go to war, I understood why our leaders felt like it was necessary to do something, anything, to prove that they were trying to protect the U.S.  In my opinion, no one really believed the WMD bullshit.  It was an excuse to unite against a common goal, visibly ridding the world of a man who encouraged violence against the U.S. and even those in his own country who did not support him completely, who had their own opinions  I don't think even the most liberal or radical amongst us can argue that Saddam Hussein should have been allowed to stay in power.  What we can argue, as Kerry has argued, is that it should have been handled differently.  So far, all we have accomplished in what has proven to be a very costly campaign in terms of human life and international support of the U.S. is the destruction of a country and more reasons for terrorists to hate us.  We destroyed what little stability there was in Iraq and have not been able to reestablish any little bit of stability in it's place.  Iraqi's were scared and terrorized under Saddam Hussein and now they are scared and terrorized under U.S. military and the puppet government we've put in place.  They are not better off today than they were a year ago or two years ago and for that matter neither are we.   I support the removal of Saddam Hussein and I support that we had to use force to do so.  What I don't support is that we acted without the consent or approval of the U.N. or any of our allied nations.  We were once again law unto ourselves.  Which, friend's and neighbors, is why other nationalities hate us so damn much.  Bush is a poor commander-in-chief.  Instead of reluctantly using force after exhausting all other avenues, he enthusiastically chose to send our American soldiers to fight a war he and other leaders did not fully understand.  And why?  Because he likes to play war.  It makes him feel important and strong.   And because the first time around, the Bush family failed to remove Saddam Hussein from power.  Kerry supported the call to war because he is an elected official who listened to the American people and the American people wanted blood to avenge the deaths of 9/11.  Now, the American people are saying that we need resolution, not more conflict.  That we have to find a way to put an end to the blood shed, because that will make us safer in the long run.  Violence begets violence, my friends and it is only by refusing to spill more blood, regardless of what they do that we can put an end to violence.  Each time we demand retribution we are feeding into an endless cycle.

      Okay, so I stole this quote from my friend Craig's site  urlLink http://craigorianchant.blogspot.com/    (which is an absolutely fabulous site) but it's the best quote ever showing either Bush's stupidity or his amazing insight, depending on how you look at it....   "Our enemies are innovative and resourceful, and so are we," Bush said. "They never stop thinking about new ways to harm our country and our people, and neither do we."     Amazing, isn't it?

      So, the reports today show what anyone out there looking for a job already knows.  Despite Bush & Co.'s reassurances that the economy is growing at a healthy rate and economists prediction of a higher rate of job creation,  The economy is doing much worse than expected with only 32,000 new jobs being created in July rather than the expected 200,000.  Now, what this really means is that Kerry has a better chance of being elected, because (as my high-school government teacher was fond of saying) people vote their pocket books.  And, most of America is seeing that our economy is still crappier than it ever was under the Clinton administration.   "This year may be President Bush's best year; it would have been President Clinton's worst year," Kerry economic adviser Aida Alvarez told CNNfn.     Add all of that to the fact that polls are showing less and less approval of the war in Iraq and things aren't looking too good for Bush.  And not a moment too soon, because while I find Kerry to be a little too moderate for my tastes I can't take another 4 years of the stupidest president in history.

      As if Florida didn't have enough against it after the election screw up and the fact that it denies gays the right to adopt, lawmakers there are now trying to pass a bill that would require parental notification of teenage abortions.   urlLink http://story.news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story&amp;u=/ap/20040802/ap_on_he_me/teen_abortions_1    It seems obvious to me that what the state of Florida needs to do is reassess it's ultra-right wing stance on civil rights.  By denying teenage girls the right to private abortions without consent of the parents (even in cases of incest) Florida is setting itself up to further infringe on the reproductive rights of women.  And increasing the chances of secret pregnancies that end in infanticide.  And to even further the stupid lengths to which they will go to stomp on civil rights, the lawmakers who designed the bill misrepresented what it will actually do.  The ballot summary of the bill states that state lawmakers "shall not limit or deny the privacy rights guaranteed to minors" without telling them that the Florida constitution grants more rights to minors than the federal government does concerning reproductive rights.  So, to the uninformed, no rights are being taken away, because, after all, the federal government doesn't grant teenage girls these rights.  But, the state of Florida does.  So this bill does in fact limit and deny the privacy rights guaranteed to minors under Florida law.  Florida lawmakers are undermining what few rights they allow citizens and lying to them about it!!!  What a place to live.  See what happens when you put a member of the Bush family in a position of power.
