       urlLink All of them are different.    urlLink Start from the first you heard   urlLink to the last bought  and I  urlLink guarantee  that  urlLink each  and  urlLink every   urlLink one of them  are  urlLink utterly unique creations .  Even the songs  urlLink they   urlLink are   urlLink comprised  of are unlike one another.  Yet in  urlLink totality , hundreds of  thousands of them have been created.  More are still to come,  urlLink at least from some bands .   Beyond that, though, are  urlLink other forms ,  urlLink other means of expression  that  urlLink enhance  and  urlLink enrich  our lives  urlLink here on earth .  How utterly and completely amazing, eh?    We are compelled to  urlLink create .   urlLink Nothing  is more  urlLink human.

      Discovered a new TV series yesterday. For all the 24 fans out there, this might be interesting. It's the British version of it. Although it is not filmed in real time over 24 hours, it's highly entertaining. It follows Her Majesty's secret service agents, ie,  urlLink Spooks , who work at MI-5.   It's not a James Bond type flick at all, way more realistic and less stereotypical. A little less action than 24, in a more flegmatic British way, but in that sense as well, it's more realistic in that the characters don't get shot, hung, beaten up, dropped from planes and helicopters and still manage to save the world and shoot 600 terrorist in the space of a day.  I believe it's broadcast in the US under the name MI-5 (why not Spooks, I don't know). Check it out if you have a chance.

      or lack thereof.  Took me long enough to find away to access this site as a member. Of course, now that I'm staring down this post page, I'm out of ideas as to what to post. Somehow, I had imagined I'd have something enlightening or entertaining to say, maybe something that'd provoke a healthy and profound debate or merely yield a couple good laughs in bored times. But nothing.  It's the creative/imaginative Murphy's law. The same law that states that when I enter a record store, I have no idea what cd's to purchase even though my list at home might be 2 pages long.  Brain farts ? or creative lapses ? Is it the same phenomenon that makes Trey decide to mail in a set closer with Character Zero or an easy encore ? just lack of ideas and inspiration ?  Inspiration comes at the most surprising and unexpected moments: in your sleep, on the train, on the bog. But it's never there when you'd really really need it. or so it seems. Furtive and Elusive.

      Heard a lot of questioning whether Trey would use the simulcast to address everyone.  While, it didn't happen in a conventional manner, I think they may have sent the message with a good chunk of that first set. Something about the Curtain, sample, moma->free seemed to be them addressing the end in the nicest manner possible.  The dinner and a movie was so obvious, hard to believe we didn't think o it.  Great time tonight.  On to Brooklyn...

      How do you do it?  How do you approach the final performances of the band you love, knowing that one by one, there's less moments all of you are going to be in the same room doing this together?  That now on this tour instead of pluses, each show is also a subtraction of sorts.  The math gets crazy but the point is this: the countdown is on.  Back to zero.  Back to naught.  Pre and Post Phish.  Where were you when you found them or they you?  What happened?  Wherewhathowhynext?      I grew into my life, into the digital world, into friendships more vast and magical then I could have ever hoped for.  That it was my oldest friends, my preschool elementary high school friends that first handed me a ticket on Oct. 23, 1996 as a graduation or late birthday or something present is powerful for me.  A  web of amazement has threaded and ensared my life as a result of my love for that band and the friends I have made along the way.  The sensations of those concerts are rare in regular life, but common among people who are always aiming for that perfect state of musical transcendence. It bled into life, into choices, into what I found valuable and powerful and true. It was a living force, a fountain of music and lights that every so often, a few days whenever I could get there, I could go and listen and laugh and give whatever ounce of joy and spirit I had to the mad amazing music being played at the universe.  On many nights we aimed far above the massive beams and curved shadows of the roof above.  Straight through the canopy of stars sometimes, when the notes crystallized correctly.  The Vortex of Perfection. The Light Show of Impossibility.  The Mothership has Landed on Your Face Maneuver.    But what intricate notework are they going to create once the first of them are tapped struck fingered into the Brooklyn night, playing the beginning of the end of what really should never have been anyway?  Might they just begin the deconstruction of everything they created?  Song mashs, long waited for battles, combinations, hilarity?  Joy?  A celebration of something passing?  Which sounds like a wake which aren't usually much fun but maybe if together we get to kill every single song, then maybe it will feel a little better.    I don't know how to go about this I guess.  It was so easy to be in the moment of the music, of the show, every time, because I never really worried about not having Phish.  I counted Phish as a stalwart against age.  A companion for life.  If they could keep on playing, then I'd keep coming to see them do it again, and always in a subtle new way.  Always true to life and music and the next show somewhere down the line.  I didn't worry about Phish.  I thought the hiatus was the best thing in the world for them.  I thought they might need another break after the Vegas shows, a year or two doing side stuff and life stuff.  But that what they had achieved at IT and in Miami and at countless other shows it proved to me that  yes indeed, for the love of God, Phish most certainly did still have it and dished it out in spades  like no other band playing today.  Certainly it was different than years past, but I think change is good and whatever they would change into next would be just as interesting and fun.  I guess half right means also half wrong.  It's going to be interesting, but Fun definitely took a blow when Phish laid down it's instruments.  It was always the anchor that could bring so many people together, physically there to see what the fuck was going to happen.  Where hands were slapped five loudly.  Where friendships and crushes formed and reform on the road in the arena or tucked way back in the grass. There was life being lived wild and free on the nights when we all got to go down through the lots and into the show together.  All of us filtered through each other, recombinated into seats inside waiting for them to take the stage and change the night into something brand new.  There are always phases: to a night, to a relationship, to a moon a river a family a dream.  To life.  To bands I guess, too.  Name the years all you want for what they did and didn't do where they played and didn't play.  What you saw, what sucked, what tore your mind from your skull and put it in the rafters.  What shows you missed.  What shows they did.  When it almost didn't work.  When it couldn't help but be right.  When you fell in love as they played.  When a song of theirs surprised you in the car.  Count them all.  Compare them.  Test them for stretchiness.  The only things that matter are that you were there, and now it's over.    So how do you go about it?  How do you reconcile the joy of history against the reality of what's not to come.  I didn't know there was a gas tank and suddenly it's on empty.  I hoped for more Beastiness and less Beatle in my Phish.  I wanted long, slow, Phish phuges for my later years.  I wanted geezer Page on keys.  I wanted Trey wrinkled.  Fishman shorter.  Mike, I'm sure, would look exactly the same.  I wanted 2 focused tours every five years.  Every ten.  No shows, even, but I guess I just wanted to know that they would always be Phish.  That they realized Phish was larger even than them, and that it didn't really completely belong to them anymore.  Obviously I was delusional because it turns out Phish actually belongs to just the four of them, each of them, completely.  We have no say.  I just didn't want to hear them say that's it.  And now we have to go celebrate everything amazing that they and we have done, and then we all have to go home happy that we got to do it at all.  After which it will never happen again.    I'm not there yet.  I'm getting there.  I think seeing them live is exactly what I need to do, but I'm certain parts of it are not going to be easy.  I'm not sure how I'm going to do it but I hope I can give it everything I've got just like every other show I've been too.  The life of Phish was a long jammed song with many phases, many changes.  And just like the last notes of Reba, of Antelope, of Lizards, of Melt Mule Zaruthsra, of all of them, just like with the post-encore lights, I'm damn freaking sad to hear see know it's over.    But I have to ask, just like any other night, what's next?  What should we do next?  That, at least IS up to us.  And I'm certain lots of you have some really good ideas.  You always do.  Which is another main reason I hang around, beyond the music and joy.  It's the good ideas that keep life interesting and interconnected and full of hope.  Even though they're not playing together anymore, that doesn't mean we have to stop, too.

      Not to sound like Jack Handy, but if you ever want to see proof that wisdom does come with age, I suggest going back and reading some stuff you wrote during your college years.  The perspective it will provide is nearly enlighting.

      Maybe I'm caught up in the hoopla of the deletion of a band that we love so much at the same time the release of a new LP, but after seeing  urlLink Vida Blue  last weekend, and listening to Army of One today repeatedly, it has come to my attention that while  urlLink Trey  is the shredding frontman who is a magician with the guitar, who takes us to the highest peaks, brings us the most pleasure, but also the most pain, it is Page,  urlLink Page McConnell  who is the true musician from A to Z. The skills - the voice - the stage presence - the bald head - the smile...its Page's World, we're all just along for the ride. I see the future in Page. Or maybe I'm just tired, hungover, and on an emotional Page high. Either way, he rocks.

       Currently Reading:  Wolves of the Calla , by Stephen King.  King started the  Dark Tower  series over 30 years ago with  The Gunslinger , telling the tale of Roland Deschain and his lifelong obession to find and save the mysterious Dark Tower - and with it, all of existence.   Wolves  is the fifth in what will be a seven book series.  Combining elements of science fiction, fantasy, horror, and the old west, the  Tower  is King's attempt to tie together the finest of his works into one sweeping, epic world - or worlds, as it were.  Occasionally abandoning logic and delving often into  deus ex machina  plot twists, King is concerned with one thing only: telling a great tale, a story  about  stories.  Not a perfect series, but a joy to read.   On Deck:  Positively Fifth Street , by James McManus.  In 2000, McManus was sent to Vegas by Harper's Magazine to cover the progress of women in the annual World Series of Poker.  In a move that would make Hunter S. Thompson proud, McManus decided the best way to cover the series would be from the inside, and risked his entire advance on a chance to enter the tournament himself.  Alternating between his own experiences at the tables, and coverage of the grisly murder of casino heir Ted Binion and the trial that followed,  Positively Fifth Street  looks to be a guilty pleasure whether you're a fan of poker or not.

      Once again it's that time of the week when all yall get time off to just kick back and drink and I have to start the tough part of my job.  I won't be at  urlLink happy hour  but I'm certain more than a few people will.  Here in  urlLink San Francisco  Zeitgeist is a favorite with their great back patio, and The Golden Cane on Haight *always* has three dollar pints.  While  urlLink Toronado  offers many beers.   urlLink NYC  has tons but which is the best?  I guess it depends on what you're  urlLink looking   urlLink for.    urlLink Boston  has a bunch too.  Many good bars on that list. Thornton's should, but doesn't.  Although it does have Jerry's Fingers.   So raise'em up to the weekend and enjoy every single minute of it.  And on Saturday, while you're  urlLink recovering from your hangover  lay down on the couch for an hour with a tall glass of water and check out  urlLink This American Life .  Give a listen to their broadcast on  urlLink Superpowers .  Click the RealAudio logo on the left, relax, listen and I'm certain their program will make you smile all day.

      About time somebody finally put something like this into motion, nice work Bones.  Hopefully this won't fall into the abyess that all other things we've attempted to create as board.  So get posting people.  As for things going on with me, I've come to the hypocritical realization that I can't stand the attitude of the modern day college student, which is funny to me for two reasons:  1) I work at a univeristy, and;  2) I once was exactly like these kids.  However, I continue to dig on the music of  urlLink The Slip  and more recently, Reid Genauer's urlLink  Assembly of Dust   For some good time-killing nonsensical reading about some folks crazy dating lives, go  urlLink  here.   This post has not been proofed and been brought to you by the letters "P" and "U"

      We've been working together to make sure everyone sees  urlLink great music , has a lot of fun and spends time with friends for a long time now.  I think it's time to take another step on our journey and really start working on a project together.  We have so much talent, intelligence and information that needs to be shared.  To that end I am proposing a collective weblog, here on this site, called mediajam.  I would love to see everyone from the MB contributing in the form of links, thoughts, stories, poems, upcoming shows, and reviews of books, movies, music, whatever.  In no way would this blog replace the message board.  Rather, it could serve as an interesting, public facing place where we could publish things we're thinking about.  Let's start offering what we know to the world!  The links I'm clicking on most these days are  urlLink Topix  and  urlLink Political Animal .  And more than any other band,  urlLink Wilco  is blowing me up every time I listen to them.   urlLink A Ghost is Born  comes out soon.  What's hitting you hard these days?

      It’s funny how you can pass by something, like a sign hanging outside of a church, everyday on your bus ride into work and never notice it partially peeking out from behind a tree branch…until one day when you just do.  Do you ever wonder why that is?  How come you see or experience certain things at *just* the right time for it all to make sense?  It could have easily been any other day or time and you never would have given it a second thought.  I read that sign this morning and I didn’t realize until I was cuddled up in my jammies in bed ready to drift off to dreamland (or so I thought) that those words had been weaving themselves throughout my day.  The past few months have brought a significant amount of change into my life.  Change has always been something that I thought I was pretty good at dealing with and adapting to.  This time was different though.  I quickly found myself struggling with everything all at once…almost drowning in it all.  The fact that I am going to be 29 soon and have been having these overwhelming feelings like I have nothing to show for it wasn't helping.  I’m single and live in a studio apartment I can barely afford (which I’m quickly finding out isn’t the worst thing in the world, being single or living alone), but my studio is expensive and it pretty much is forcing me to live paycheck to paycheck right now which isn’t the most fun-constantly budgeting.  I have a job that I don’t particularly care that much about but at the same time am very grateful that I have because (a) it’s money, money that allows me to be able to live alone and show myself that I can indeed make it on my own, and that is empowering, and (b) the people I work with more than make up for me having no desire to pursue a long term career at this company.  So these things are just a part of life, and I know I’m not the only one who experiences them.  The big one for me is my lack of a formal academic education.  Almost everyone I know has graduated from college and sometimes that makes me feel simply, uneducated.  I know that this is something that I can change, and I am trying to make it happen.  Making it happen requires so much sacrifice, money, time, energy.  Not that I’m not willing to put forth the effort to make it happen, it’s just one of the more difficult things I have accomplishing.  And in a world where most college freshmen are 18 and out by 21, well, that is the only reason turning 30 in a year scares me.  I completely welcome everything else about growing older.   In some ways, I feel like I am 18 again.  Like I’m learning things now or have been learning things through the past few years that I should have learned back then.  Things I would have learned had I had a normal childhood.  It started out normal, I had a strong foundation, a happy, loving, nurturing beginning.  I know that is what saved me.  It’s not something I talk about often, but from about 9-17 a person came into my life, an ex-stepmother, (and continues to be as she is my brother and sister’s mom, fortunately she has not been in my life for a long time now—but that’s a whole other story)  she was emotionally abusive, selfish, manipulative,  all characteristics I never knew in anyone up to that point.  From 12-17 when I lived with her and my father, I was living in an extremely unsupportive, unhealthy, non-communicative environment.  My view of home, love and family got so skewed.  So for many years, it was all I knew.  In many ways I was just learning how to survive in that world, I was never really allowed to *live* in it.  Not in the ways that most people I know did.     For far too long I carried the weight of those years around with me not always realizing how it was affecting my life.  I knew that it *was* but I didn’t know how to begin to fix it, I didn’t have the tools….until a few months ago.     I didn’t get the love and nurturing and support in some pretty critical years of my life when I needed those things the most.  It’s a continued work in progress, but I have recently been able to learn how to let go of a lot of the bitterness and anger that I held inside from those years, which has been such a great feeling.  I know that I didn’t have the worst childhood in the world by ANY means, I know there are SO many others out there who dealt/deal with far, far worse, sometimes even unimaginable things, but when you start to see the way things could have been for you by experiencing other people’s lives and how they were raised, well, it can consume you if you let it.  I didn’t want to let it.  I want much much more than that.  And one of the really cool things that I think that I get to see right now, is watching my friends start to have families.  Knowing that there are going to be kids in this world who are going to get all of the love and nurturing and kindness and support that I know my friends have inside of them to give, it’s really comforting to me for some reason.  And I even think start to think that those are things that I could give to a partner and maybe a family of my own….one day (don't want to get too ahead of myself here).   So back to my main point of things coming into your life at just the right moment, while there were things in my life that held me back, there were things that pushed me forward in an equally as positive manner, if not more so.  That is where friends and music entered my life.   So when I said that sometimes I feel like I have nothing to show for my life, I simply know that is not true.  I know what I have to show…it’s love.  I have moved around and lived in more places than I can count on my fingers (and maybe toes) in the past 10 years and one thing that has given me…is the many different people I have met and known along the way.  I feel like I’ve known so many levels of love from all of these people.  Whether it was someone who has been in my life for 12+ years or someone I just met today; whether it was someone who was only in my life for the period of time they were meant to be in it or someone I talk to on a daily basis…every one of them showed me something that made me a better person… love, support, understanding, the meaning of friendship and family…they all helped to get me here…to right now.  And discovering the magic of music and what it can do to your heart and spirit was another saving grace and amazingly positive force in my life.  And the cool part is that there is SO much to discover.  A person could spend a lifetime discovering new music, new favorite songs and the old ones never go away…it just builds and builds…like a good YEM intro.  The friends/music connection and the impact that both have had on my life is something very real to me and something I hold onto very dearly in my heart.   Obviously, Phish has been a huge factor in that equation.  Which is probably why I’m feeling the need to write some of this out right now, with Phish’s career coming to an end an all.  It sounds so silly to some people, but to me and I know all of you, it’s an end of an amazing journey through some meaningful years of our lives.   First and foremost, there is the music…when I first started listening to them 11 years ago…that was the first time that listening to music made me feel *that* free and alive….the first time music made me want to dance like *that*.  The beauty that one note or a combination of notes could stir up inside of me was unprecedented.  Then you have the band’s silly and creative side, which drew me in even further.  Eternal joy and never ending splendor….to know what that feels like, well, I don’t need to tell you, do I?  Not everyone in this world gets a chance to experience those feelings.  We are SO very lucky.  Phish was my first taste of magic and all of that before I ever went to a show.  I spent 3 years listening to mostly studio albums and random bootlegs (listened to my first bootleg in a playhouse in a backyard in Iowa with 3 friends—thanks travis—best tweezer ever) here and there before I ever went to see them live.  And then to all of a sudden feel the collective energy spontaneously created between the audience and the four members on stage…wow.   Someone asked me tonight if I was sad that Phish is almost done.  Yes, I am, I replied, but change is inevitable.  I’m sad that the fun of traveling and meeting up with friends that the band has brought to my life is over, there are probably some people I really won’t see again because of it.  But the music will always be out there…generations to come will get to experience it (even if not live, it doesn’t matter, the magic in the music will always be there.  Teenagers and Twentysomethings will be experiencing it for years to come.)  I know this because I look at my own musical adventures…One example, I never got to see the Grateful Dead, which I know I would have loved and I know it would have given me a deeper dimensional outlook into the music if I had been able to experience it live, but I still know how Jerry’s guitar makes me *feel*.  And that is something that never leaves.  How can I be sad that Phish is almost done when that band indirectly lead me to a group of people so amazing and special and unique…people who have become not just friends but also family, watching out for and caring for one another in the way that we do…in some ways it’s more of a family than I’ve ever known…so how can I be sad?  How can I be sad when I know that I will always remember what it felt like to finally hear my first divided sky after 30+ shows and the fact that that song STILL makes me jump up and down like a little kid and dance and smile, even when I’m listening to any version of it by myself in my living room.  How can I be sad when it’s opened my eyes to the beauty of random connections and interactions between strangers.  How can I be sad when I know I have the opportunity to look around during the last week of shows…..when it’s time to say goodbye…to see all of your smiling faces (and those of you who physically can’t be there, will MOST definitely be there in spirit and thought of often)…dancing, happy….a place where a smile can say everything…welcome home.  How can I be sad when I’ve been given more than I possibly could have ever imagined.  Life after Phish…it’s going to change us.  A lot of the change will have to do with the fact that we’re getting older as well.  We will continue to grow and change, drift apart and come back together, some more than others…but we will always be connected.  What would make me sad…is if after Phish we don’t give back everything that we’ve been given…not only to continue to give those things to each other…but also to share them with our worlds.  Whether it be through your jobs, the ways in which you choose to help others, through your creativity (music, art, writing, etc.) or through the children and families you raise.  That is how we can give back what we've been given.   Well, if you’ve read this far and are still reading, thank you.  I know that I stress about where my life is headed, probably more than I should, but if where I’ve been is any indication of where I’m going, I shouldn’t be too worried.  I’ve pretty much lived my life by following my heart and I just can’t complain where is has brought me so far.  Reading that sign today brought me a much needed sense of peace…I do feel like today is the first day of the rest of my life.  And to quote Tom Robbins…”It’s never too late to have a happy childhood.”

      Word.      I've been working that one back into my vocabulary recently without even meaning to.  Or maybe it's been the other way around.  Maybe 'Word.' has been working it's way back into my vocabulary.  Either way it gets funny after you say it a bit.  Keeps the freaks at bay, though, if you use it loud enough and with enough zeal.  Woooord!   urlLink What's up with you?        urlLink I need to write more words every day.       Google.    It's an IPO!  It's mail with a G.  No E, no Dash.  It scans for ads like you don't like it, but not in the sneaky way all the others do.  Spam free.  Threaded.  Gmail is going to make email look like snail mail but with smoother jcpenny catalogs the mailman don't have to carry.  Thing about Google is there's more ways to use it than there are  urlLink knots .       urlLink Soople makes it simple.         The Safe.    Put the money in it every night I manage, but for some reason tonight it got freaky on me.  Last one there downstairs in the office hovel.  Ice machine making cubes of fear fall in a crunch as I sat with the night drawer counting cash.  Finally, when I put it in, signed in the safe, the door wouldn't close.  Seven times I tried the combination and each and every one made it make the three beeps of nope, and not the one chirp of yup.  Finally it relented and I sealed the night  urlLink away .       urlLink Did it appreciate my patience, or just get bored?

      Growing up in  urlLink Pelham Manor, NY , I received my first fishing rod in sixth grade as a Confirmation present. I had been introduced to fishing the previous year during a week- long trip taken with my schoolmates dubbed as Outdoor Education.&nbsp; While that was a freshwater excursion, my sights quickly turned to saltwater as the  urlLink Long Island Sound  was in my backyard.  &nbsp;  As a ten year old, my fishing excursions were limited to those places I could get my parents to take me, which usually ended up being the  urlLink Larchmont Shore Club , where we were members when I was a kid. A typical routine would have me heading to the club for a painful couple of hours of swim team practice, followed by hours of snapper  urlLink bluefish  fishing in the Sound.  &nbsp;  I clearly remember the excitement I felt with every tug on the line, regardless of the size of the fish. My interest in fishing grew even further one summer day when my rod bent over faster and harder than I had ever felt before. I had seen some of the men fishing the Sound land bigger bluefish, so I thought that I had finally graduated from only catching snapper blues to the bigger variety. However after a fish fight that seemed to go on forever, I was treated to the sight of a  urlLink strange fish , with stripes running down both sides of its streamlined body. This moment, I believe, became ingrained in my head, causing the addiction I have today to the sport.  &nbsp;  As I grew from pre-teen to teenager, my interest in fishing waned as I became preoccupied with other things that teenagers typically pursue such as; sports, girls, friends and being annoying to my parents. Did I mention girls?  &nbsp;  My interest in fishing never really left me completely as I would find myself watching the fishing shows on Saturday and Sunday mornings throughout high school and even while attending  urlLink college in New Hampshire . Although still busy with my studies and extracurricular activities, an impromptu trip to  urlLink Marthas Vineyard  towards the end of my college years brought fishing back to the forefront of my mind.  &nbsp;  Once I graduated from college and moved to  urlLink Boston , I began to research the historic fishing grounds that surrounded my new home. This led to the persistent accumulation of fishing gear that continues to this day and a sometimes one-dimensional train of thoughtespecially during the height of the saltwater fishing season.  &nbsp;  By the way, that rod from sixth grade hangs in my garage today.

      I can't remember the last time I picked up a physical newspaper to read. There is something about having it in your hands and feeling it's presence that is nice, and I do like to do crossword puzzles every so often. However, the variety of perspectives and sources that reading the news online offers has made it my choice for getting information about the world we live in.     urlLink Google News    rocks because it collects up to date news from a variety of sources in different categories. For each article or subject there will be links to different news outlets so you can get all the sides to the story. It doesn't seem to discriminate or lean towards pointing you to one website or another. I actually haven't figured out why one website gets to the headline link and another doesn't, because I've seen everything from CNN to small unknown websites linked.    urlLink Commondreams    is a great website that has progressive news articles from different websites all in one place. On any given day you can read articles from big media like the  urlLink New York Times ,  urlLink USA Today , or the  urlLink Wall Street Journal , as well as articles from smaller media outlets like T urlLink he Nation  or  urlLink Mother Jones . There are also articles published only on Commondreams by freelance writers, and sometimes  urlLink speeches  by  urlLink politicians  and  urlLink intellectuals  are published for your reading pleasure. I always look forward to Bill Moyers'  urlLink articles  and  urlLink speeches  as they are  urlLink always  incredibly well thought out and written.   I usually cruise over to  urlLink Alternet  to see what they have to offer. They always have interesting articles on a variety of subjects, from the  urlLink environment , the  urlLink war on drugs , and of course the impending  urlLink Election 2004 .    urlLink In These Times  is one of my favorites, for many reasons. First, it's the only place where  urlLink Kurt Vonnegut   urlLink still   urlLink publishes   urlLink excellent   urlLink articles .   Sometimes I surf the links on the left hand column of Commondreams and&nbsp; pick random sites to see what they have to offer. If I feel like hearing the official, twisted word straight from the devil's mouth, I read the  urlLink White House Press Briefings .   On occasion I check out  urlLink Town Hall  and  urlLink Fox News  to see what the other side has to say on the matter. It usually ends up making me frustrated.   I also read the  urlLink local news , even when I'm away from home, to keep tabs on the issues of my home state.

      As most of you know,  urlLink I  have a beautiful five year old daughter. I'll spare you all the details, but we had a tough time having her, more accurately, my wife had a very tough time.  &nbsp;  In any event, what we went through to have  urlLink Caitlin Sierra  has made a biological sibling for her all but impossible. We have been considering adoption for almost three years, and it's been an emotional roller coaster, equal to that of  urlLink Tami's  pregnancy with Caitlin.  &nbsp;  So, we are just about done with the prerequisite homestudy, which all agencies require. This is a process of a joint interview, separate interviews, then a visit to our home. It's taken me awhile to warm up to the idea that someone has to bless my ability to be a parent, when I already have Caitlin, but I have come to understand the need for it. For this we paid just about $5,000.  &nbsp;  We've considered both domestic and international adoption, and quite frankly, the choices are mind boggling, with all of the situations different regarding age of&nbsp;children available,&nbsp;open vs. closed adoption,&nbsp;paperwork required,&nbsp;length of wait, parental&nbsp;age maximums and cost. &nbsp;As an example,  urlLink Russia  is quite popular these days, and some of the requirements are:    -You can be no older than 42 to adopt  -Children are typically 8 months - 18 months when adopted  -Parents required to take 2, 2 week trips to Russia.  -Tons of Paperwork  -12 month wait&nbsp;for a boy / up to 2 year wait&nbsp;for a girl  -$38,000 total costs (including home study, travel, fees, etc...)  -Practically zero information regarding parents of baby, so no medical records.  &nbsp;  We have ruled  urlLink Russia  out, mostly because about 10% of the children adopted from Russia suffer from fetal alcohol syndrome, which affects childrens development and can lead to serious health problems as an adult, among other things. Also, the travel needed is excessive and I can't see taking my daughter to Russia at&nbsp;this point, and frankly, I have many other places I'd like to see first.  &nbsp;  We are pretty close to signing up with an agency out of  urlLink Texas . The cost is a bit less than Russia, but not much, and we'll get an infant (3 day's old!) as well as a full medical background of the biological parents. We also need to put together a "marketing book" which will have pictures and stories about our family which the birth mother's review to select the adoptive family.&nbsp;(Birth mother's are amazing, and would require a separate blog entry for me to accurately spell out my admiration)  &nbsp;  If all goes well, we could have a little one by winter. Another neat&nbsp;thing about  urlLink Texas  is that you get what you get, meaning you won't&nbsp;know if it's a boy or girl until you get the call. Plus with Texas, it's a shoe if for a Dead related name.:)  &nbsp;  The cost factor has really been an eye opener. I understand the agencies needs to stay afloat, but it sure is an expensive proposition when all you really want to do is open your home to a child who needs one.  &nbsp;  Anyway, if you've read this far, thanks for doing so. Have great weekends!  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;

      Money is the root of all evil.  Another day, another dollar. Money can't buy happiness. Greed kills. It's never really been about the money for me because, afterall, it can't buy happiness.  Still, these are the cliches that have been running through my mind lately.  It all stems from not getting the raise I expected at work.  I've changed jobs four times in my real world life having once made a lateral move and more recently, taken a pay cut.  It wasn't too important to me when taking this job because I was unemployed at the time and also looking to find a working environment that was more laid back than my previous one.  Besides, the prospect of getting a free education seemed to outweigh the pay cut at the time.  That has all changed.  My work has been nothing short of brilliant in the eight months I've been at my current job, at least, according to my review.  My boss put in for a significant pay increase on my behalf, telling me she would like to see me get up to the salary I was making at my last job.  The actuality of the raise fell far short of this. In fact, it amounted to nothing more than a cost of living increase.  I realize this is the nature of the non-profit world and my boss has petitioned the powers that be for a supplemental increase on my behalf.  But judging on how slow things move at this institution, it is going to take months for it to happen, if it happens at all.  So, I've found myself debating my future.  There are a lot of perks to working where I am.  The summer hours and the freedom being the most prominent.  But, there is little leadership and I am left to my devices to create work for myself.  And while this is a definitive perk, I'm starting to realize I am not very effective when left to my own devices.  I need to be busy at all times.  I need deadlines.  And most importantly, I need/want to be part of building strategic plans and then implementing them.  So, I'm starting to contemplate a return to the for-profit world.  I can't belief I just typed that because of my well-documented  urlLink hatred of my last job  (or pretty much any post there from Jan-June of '03).  But, I'm pretty sure it had more to do with my co-workers than anything else.  I made the mistake today of looking up what someone with my experience could expect to make in the for-profit world and discovered I am making about $35K below the median.    Fueling my urgency is my  urlLink impending fatherhood .  Kids aren't cheap and I currently feel like we are still living from paycheck to paycheck.  I'm leary about making the move back to the corporate world, but I'm not exactly sure why.  Part of me thinks it's the long hours, but lord knows I've put in some long hours in my current position.  Plus, I'm on-call at times...and I really do not make enough money to be at the mercy of a pager.  I think the job hunt is about to rev-up again.    The good news is that I am in a good position to began looking and not coming to front he ranks of the unemployed.  It means I can take my time.  Something has never felt right about this job since day one.  I chalked it up to being new, but with eight months gone, I've still got the feeling.  There has been too much uncertainty because we have been without a director pretty much since I've been there.  I'm not sure what it is with me and having the bosses that hire me move into different departments shortly after I arrive.  But, its now happened in my last three positions.  Still, the uncertainty is doing me more harm than good.  My natural cynicism is creeping more and more into my daily work and I fear I'm just being too negative about things.  The summertime isn't helping either, causing a lack of focus at work and with my writing.  I realize this is about to turn into one of the many pep talks I've so often given myself.  I've made it a goal over a year ago to deal with change better, a gol I feel I've met. Now, I need to take the next step toward initiating change myself.  Because if I don't, I'm going to find a few years have got behind me and I'll still be sitting in the spot.  I should also mention that x-factor that compounds this choice is the fact there is potential for me to move up.  But, in order to do so, I'm going to need to establish a good rapport with the new director (if they ever get hired) and I'm going to need my current boss to leave.  Those situation could work out and I could also get the raise I am looking for.  Until then, I know I can't sit idly by.  Testing the waters never hurts.  AS for why the free education thing sounds a bit better on paper than practice?  Well, it would take approximately three to four years for me to get a masters going part-time on top of work and a new baby.  Add it the fact that I would want to become a teacher and we're dealing with the money factor again.  Maybe I'm lazy or maybe the working world just doesn't agree with me, or me with it.  I know, the glass is always  urlLink half-empty  for me.

      Yes, even in  urlLink Switzerland , it's festival Season. This July, I have been lucky to be living at the epicenter of the 3 main festivals of the  urlLink Lake Geneva region .  First it was the  urlLink Lausanne  Arts  urlLink Cité Festival . Taking place in the  urlLink historical center  of town, around the cathedral and the old city castle, this "urban" festival consists of a handful of stages, showcasing music, theatre, classical movies or comedy acts. Mimes and poetic readings also occur in small plazas, street painters and community orchestras liven up side streets. The main square around town is filled with various food and wine stands, which other more traditional bars complement quite nicely. The experience makes for a very enjoyable stroll in the cool summer evenings, drinking and eating, taking it all in, strolling from stage to stage through busy streets or simply gazing above the old castle wall at the lake and barely etched mountains in the distance.  That same week, and stretching for an additional week, is the infamous Montreux  urlLink Jazz Festival . Arguably the biggest jazz festival in Europe, the inspiration for deep Purple's  urlLink Smoke On The Water , this festival is a pot pourri of all music styles for all ages and tastes. From classic rock to African beats, from classical music to Brazilian Salsa, from Italian pop to Dutch techno dj's, from authentic reggae to funky grooves this festival has it all. 3 main indoor venues of varying sizes (Stravinsky Auditorium, Miles Davis Hall, Casino Barriere) for the main acts, and a handful of outdoor stages for free shows, all on the lakeside of the beautiful town of Montreux (Freddy Mercury' adoptive home, as commemorated by his  urlLink statue ). The lakeside promenade is also lined with shopping stalls making for a very enjoyable (although somewhat repetitive) 3-mile lot stroll. Wine and booze flow endlessly and the schwilliness, whilst prevalent in the wee wee hours of the night, is always good-natured and friendly.  This year, I am lucky to be able to attend for the first time in 3 years (no Phish tour, no High Sierra), and am making up for missing the previous 2 years by seeing amongst other artists, Herbie Hancock, The John Scofield trio, the illustrious Carlos Santana with a slew of special guests (Hancock, Chick Corea, John McLaughlin, Steve Winwood, etc), Parliament Funkadelic (with original keyboardist Bernie Worrel), Michael Franti & Spearhead.  And finally, next week kicks off the  urlLink Paleo Festival  in Nyon, a short 20-mile drive west of Lausanne, also along the lake. This is a music festival in the truer sense of the world, ie, 4 outdoor stages, and one single ticket to see them all and stroll from act to act. Onsite Camping is available and a very popular option although that is a scene I frankly have yet to experience. This year the festival's headline were Peter Gabriel and David Bowie. Unfortunately, David Bowie had to cancel due to  urlLink emergency health issues .  I wish him a speedy recovery and hope he will return next year. Texas and Patti Smith amongst others, are scheduled to replace him. Not quite the same caliber but since tickets are non-refundable, I'll most likely still go, if only to attend this festival for the first time.  This is my local music fix for the year pretty much. I am missing a moe. show in London tonight but you cant hit them all. Bigger mainstream acts such as Radiohead are tough to hit since they play in bigger towns such as Zurich, and I'm never on the ball when it comes to getting tickets for these guys. As for jambands, their appearances in Europe are few and far between. Even Medeski, Martin and Wood which had fallen into a laudable pattern of hitting Europe every summer has bailed on the continent this year. SCI's quick Europe tour this winter was a welcome surprise. The Disco Biscuits would make a killing in the club scene of certain countries. When I end up backstage this upcoming tour, I will tell Trey and Page and Mike to bring their solo acts to Swiss festivals next year. Aren't Vermonters suppose to be big skiers after all ?

      Alright, here it is, what turns me on, makes me tick these days. Today its  urlLink Exile On Main Street . I know, I know, most of you are like "what took you so long?" I have no idea. Especially since the former love of my life  urlLink Liz Phair  (who lost many points recently by releasing a cheesy pop album) based her whole first record  urlLink Exile in Guyville  on this rockin' record.  It was originally thought to have been a  urlLink response  to EOMS - but later interviews she said she only used it to help her in  urlLink structuring  EIG which was a double album as well.  So I am obsessed with the songs  urlLink Sweet Virginia  and  urlLink Torn and Frayed  and  urlLink Casino Boogie  and (you get the picture). I have always been so curious to hear this album but just never set out to obtain it. But now that its here, in my jukebox, in my  urlLink ipod , I am discovering all the nooks and crannies song by song.   I love discovering new music that has been out for awhile whether its a few months, a few years or even a few decades. Thats what is so fun about music, its endless. There is always somewhere to go. With that  urlLink nameless  favorite band vanishing into thin air soon, new music has to be had, and played on repeat over and over and over again to make me want to just get out my seat and rock out.

      I have never been bereft of emotion when it comes to Phish.  The time before tour and shows has always been filled with excitement and anticipation for the unknown.  Will the band take me to that place few things in life have ever brought me to?  Will I forge new friendships through the experience or further solidify existing ones? What one moment will I witness or share that will glimmer in an instant and making itself unique to only me?      There have been so many moments and memories etched into the fabric of my soul in the decade that this band has been so much a part of my life.  And as I sit starring down the barrel of what may be the final two shows I’ll ever see, I’m confronted with feelings I’ve ever experienced before that is, a lack of feeling.  I’m completely numb.  This anesthetized state relates back to the peace I made with the band at Shoreline in October 2000. I made the choice to view the hiatus as a break-up of sorts, a chance for me to focus on other things in my life without Phish influencing any of them.  So, I got married, bought a house, started concentrating on my career and started to build my own little family.  With a wife, dog and first child on the way, I’m well grounded on the path I set out to travel.  Phish coming back was merely icing on the cake for me.  Those shows back became more about catching-up with old friends than getting my mind melted by the music the four guys from Vermont were raining down upon us.  Which turned out to be a blessing, because, as we all know, that post-hiatus stuff was more bad than good.  But, because my band wasn’t bringing the life onstage that helped define part of me, I started to doubt the credibility of what I took from the music pre-hiatus.  Was it really the party that created these moments for me?  Ironically, it was in the party capital of world that I finally found my peace with modern-day Phish.   Which was also the same run that was probably the catalyst for Phish pulling the plug on themselves.  When the confirmation came, like so many of us, I began scrambling to figure out which shows I could attend.  The reality of it all ending proved to be the catalyst that sent me out to Wisconsin at the end of June.  But in scrambling, I also realized the current older version of me decided to stay away from Coventry, choosing instead let my run end where it pretty much began, Great Woods.  When we bought our house, which rests a mere 15 minutes from Great Woods, almost three years ago, I couldn’t wait for Phish to return to the venue where it all took off, for them and me.  I had visions of hosting all the friends I’ve accumulated through the band over the years in my yard for a big party.  I had no idea it would turn out to be a send-off party.  Normally, I’d be in full-on planning mode right now to get ready for hosting people.  But, I’m not.  Sure, I’ve got some things ready for the makings of a great gathering, but I’m numb to the centerpiece of it all, the two shows.  If forced to name a specific emotion than I would have to say nervousness is the closest; nervous excitement I suppose.  This is going to be the last time I get to hang with friends and the band and that has me worried.  But as I started to worry about what the shows will be like for me and if I’ll provide my friends a good time, I started to realize I might drive myself crazy.    I’ve come close to mania on several occasions since Trey’s announcement, compounded by my impeding fatherhood and issues at work.  Sitting at the beach the other day, on an usually cold August afternoon, I was humbled by the experience of nature and realized just what a small cog I am in the entire plan.    So, I’ve decided to try and let all anticipation float away, to not place any expectation on that 48-hour period.  I’m just going to let it happen figuring they’ll be plenty of time to digest after the last note is played.  I’ll be striving for those moments you capture by simply taking the time to press pause.  They have always been the most meaningful to me because they are captured without preconceived thought.  Those moments never end.

      Almost six years ago, I wondered to the sexy next-door apartment-style dorm, in hopes of meeting other new swimmers, to explore several keg party possibilities. Several guys on the men’s team met me downstairs, checked me in, and introduced me to the rest of the team. While that night ranks amongst the best, too many crazy moments to talk about, one sticks out in my mind: meeting Vanessa, the friend who introduced me to Phish. I had heard about Phish in high school, but preferred the Grateful Dead and Dave Matthews Band for whatever reasons I had at the time.   Fast forward one year and many great memories later, I was offered the opportunity to attend the July 4th, 1999 show in Atlanta with my USC swimming teammate Katrina, but choose the Dave Matthews Band show, also at Lakewood, three weeks later. It was there that I physically met Rob, a.k.a. LTR, who I had been trading music with the past year. Both he and Vanessa emphasized the coolness that was Phish and the up coming Big Cypress. Both assured me of their presence at Big Cypress, and I proceeded to convince my sister to attend. While they never made it to BC, my sister and I were introduced to a completely new and different lifestyle: the Phish. In fact, the infamous killahwave.etree.org began as soon as I arrived back in Columbia, with the motive of ASAP show acquisition.  She and I caught two more Phish shows during summer 2000, with Vanessa, Katrina, LTR, and many, many others. Then the hiatus announcement came – I remember watching the first Vegas webcast on my computer while studying for a test. NYE 2000 was a letdown in comparison to 1999.  Fast forward to February 2001, and the Trey Winter Tour announcement. My then boyfriend camped out all night at a small USC box-office for tickets because I had a program due the next day. Of course, I occasionally walked over there to hang out and to take a break from the doldrums of programming at the lab. Not only did we get second row seats for LTR, my friend Lilli, my ex and I, but we also got 8th row seats for Vanessa, Jen and Mark.  The trey show quickly approached, and brought an unexpected call from LTR: “I was in an accident on I-20, it wasn’t my fault, but the 4-Runner is totaled. I am going to wait for Jarrett, and grab a ride with them, but most likely won’t stay in Columbia tonight.” I was disappointed, but at least he was coming. I pre-partied with some other friends, Bino and Jonas, whose huge, central hangout house was teeming with trey going phans. Upon arriving at my then boyfriend’s house, LTR had arrived with a new Atlanta crew: Tim, Ian, David a.k.a. Sip and Jarrett. Eventually, we convinced them to stay the night, and the rest is history. I kept in contact with Sip and Ian, went to a number of shows with them over the summer and fall, and eventually started dating Sip in October 2001.  That summer was an important turning point in my life because I also was introduced to the peeps. I had been perusing many message boards while at my two jobs, but didn’t post much, especially at Phans.com. It was there that I met Kevin, who decided to introduce me to the peeps (and I am forever grateful that he did). Soon-thereafter, I met Frank, who thankfully convinced me to break up with my ex-boyfriend and to take a new, more focused direction in my life. The fall semester that followed was full of high’s, such as dating Sip, the SCI run and Oysterhead, and many lows, including a micro-managing boss’s wrath and failing two classes.  However, the accumulation of friends, both older and younger, the wisdom of the peeps, the unending faith and support from my parents and sister, and, of course Sip, formed an overly adequate support group that facilitated my unlikely computer science comeback, and resulted in eventual acceptance into graduate school. These wonderful people not only helped me realize my potential in many, many avenues, but also to accept my “outside-looking-in” tendencies instead of trying to be the center of attention in any one of my seemingly infinite interests. I am and will always be forever grateful.   Fast forward three years: Coventry 2004. Thankfully, most of the aforementioned people will be there to culminate the end of a significant part of our lives. Many of us will never see another show together, while the rest will seemingly fade into the sunset as we continue to chase the proverbial musical dragon. Notably missing are LTR and Marie, as their new baby has lead them in other directions, comparatively with the Dead bringing them together in the first place. Not seeing many of these wonderful people is what I will miss the most about Phish.

      I was asked to write a 300 word essay for a Coventry ticket. Even though I knew the person asking me was too drunk to remember, I figured I'd play the game - I like games. So I sat at my computer and, like I so often do when I write, started typing without much thought just knowing I had to hit 300 words. Here's what came out:  Mail Order. Lick the stamp, seal it up, make sure you have everything you need. Self-addressed stamped envelope. Did you write down all the shows? Should you put it in the mail? You know there’s something wrong, you know it. Tickets come and no work can be done even though the shows are a month away. A month a month a month and we’re in the car riding road tripping piling in with food and friends up the Interstate, down the Pike.  The Lot. Cars slowly moving parking weaving through wooks to find the nearest graveled spot to let you out. Wander wander wander. Muffins. “TOUR EXTRA!” What’s shakin down the street? The herd flocks, ‘Let me know,’ they think, ‘I need to know’ and they  do  know as soon as they turn the corner and hear “Molly Nugs E Paper!” “Phatty veggie burritos!” “Porters Oaties Fat Tire!” Oh, they know all right, they know that their every last temptation desire need love can be found with a simple wave of a hand blink of an eye flash of a dollar. The energy begins to grow.  The Venue. The time rolls near your missions clear, find the nearest bathroom before you head in. Ah, no time, you feel the energy starting to prick the little hairs on your fingers as you make half time plans with your friends that rarely work out. “TICKETS OUT, HANDS UP, BAGS OPEN!” The energy grows. You make it through the doors into a sea of necks and heads, shoulder-to-shoulder you waddle, staring, phriends surrounding and the energy grows. “TOUR EXTRA!” The river of voices build magnify multiply heighten to a point of spontaneous combustion and then and then “WOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!” The energy is a alive now it feeds you floats you pulls you to grab the shoulders in front of you and start jumping up and down because you want to, because you can. You find your seat and check out your view of the stage waiting in anxious anxiety as you check your watch and estimate the time to the moment the energy has carried you to. And the pre-show music stops. The time has come. Everything you’ve envisioned from the minute you licked that stamp has finally emerged in front of your eyes.  The lights go out.

      The announced ending has had a profound effect on my appreciation for Phish's music. First, as if it was even possible, it's made me listen to them even more. Rabidly, as if with their last show, all my CD's would disappear, vanish into thin air and I'd be left with empty CD shelves. Alternating between recent shows from the 1st part of the summer tour, to oldies and classics from 93-94, back to breakout shows in 96-97, etc etc, back and forth in Phishtory, weighing and comparing and appreciating the changes, the styles, the influences, the progression, the boldness and innovation, the evolution of their music. "The more you put in, the more you get out" said Page in Bittersweet Motel. It's true for all of us as well: the more you listen, the more you recognize the subtle shifts and changes, the tiny innovations. You learn to get in their heads and anticipate, you become prepared and "knowledgeable" , your sense of appreciation grows and grows as you comprehend the scope of their music, its power, its potential, the endless possibilities.  But these hours of listening are tainted with nostalgia these days, as the "deadline" approaches. In listening to all these shows or old albums, but also in re-reading press clippings, articles, books that I've already leafed through many times years ago, I cant seem to shake this lump in my stomach. Almost every tune I listen to sends me back to a specific moment, somewhere on a lawn or in an arena; a rush of adrenaline fills my heart as I catch a quick glimpse of what it was like at that time, to feel the bass shaking my ribcage, or the lights blinding me with ecstasy, or a drumbeat kicking in a powerful groove. The memories are vague and hazy, but are multiplying and multiplying. Little instances hidden deep inside my head, swimming upwards to the surface, briefly re-emerging after years of oblivion: faces, notes, feelings, emotions, shivers, jokes and smiles. Everything seems fresher. Even familiar, it remains as powerful as ever: so much emotion in such silly noises.  This is what strikes me more than anything. Phish has given me many things over the years and has shaped my life and character in ways I'll still be unraveling in 10 years' time I'm sure. I get to keep the memories, the travels, the adventures, the wonderful people and friends made along the way, that I fully plan on keeping in touch with, with or without this band. The end of Phish in noway means the end of all the fun we've had. We'll just have to become a little more creative, find our own canvas to paint on.  What will disappear though, and what I'll miss most, is this wide spectrum of emotions that are experienced during a show. The intense feelings of elation, and happiness, the states of confusion and loss followed by familiarity and relief: a screeching guitar riff to hold on to, a lifeline in the vast ocean that some jams can become, or a single piano note as a small but essential foothold in the climb to the jam's peak. The anticipation as the light goes down and before every single song, the excitement when hearing teases in the middle of nowhere, or just imagining them and wishing with all your might that the band is on your wavelength (or vice versa) and plunges down that road; the swaying of a slow song, the pounding of a fast song, the dancing and getting DOWN of a funk number... The trust and faith we have in giving the keys to the ride over to those 4 guys on stage, with only one simple instruction:  "Blow our minds".  Where else am I going to find that ? Not in another band. Never at this level. "The more you put in, the more you get out". I doubt I'll ever reach that level of familiarity with a band that'll allow their music to move me in such ways. The live experience is one thing, but the live Phish experience is another altogether.  So this summer, be sure to squeeze every last drop of emotion out of the songs you see. For even those that you dislike might be on their last outing, and in every song there is something to treasure, even if it's just a simple chord sequence, or a word, or a note. Be generous with your smiles and your hugs, your high fives and your woohoo's. Lap it all up as you get hosed, for this is the last time it happens. We have years and years to be critical and negative, let's just appreciate this gift one last time, together.

      It may come as suprise to some, but i'm a huge  urlLink MMW  fan.  I've checking them out since '96 and they never cease to amaze me.  Saturday night Nikkie, Tina and myself went to the   urlLink Mountain Winery , just outside San Jose.  It's an amazing venue, small (about 1000 seats), security is super chill and the sound is awesome.   Anywho, I had tickets to a KFOG private soundcheck party, so I was like a little kid..couldn't wait for Saturday afternoon.  Showed up at the venue and was led in by a BGP rep.  I had a pass for Nik and myslef, however, Tina was able to sneak in which was nice.   We go down to the seats where the crew is tuning and checking levels.  Then M, M and W walk out and start jamming.  There were a few stops to fix things (change out a snare drum, fix bass levels, whatnot), but we were basically treated to a 40 minute or so improv jam.  Of course, you can't really complain when there's only 10 people watching.  After the soundcheck the band hung around and chatted with us.  After a bit, they were told dinner was ready (Curry, in case you care), they thanked us for coming and we went our ways.  Having an entire show to look forward to was great.  Basically all icing at that point.   Great show, a little over 50% sold, so there was room to move around.  1st set was more jazzy with some new tunes thrown in, but second set was just sick.  higlights include: Whiney Bitches,  urlLink Legalize It  and one of my favorite 1,2 punches from them ever Univisible>Chub Sub.  So there you have it, my two cents from MMW 7.31.04  Shackman

      I enjoy my ritual four day weekends home every five months – invariably, my mom tells the same story six times and I end up arguing with some member of my family over a redundant misunderstanding. With family, it’s to be expected, I think. Last May’s visit was no exception – albeit the summer teaching assignments were issued two days before I left. The majority of the trip was spent planning, rendering my ability to spend time with my family at zero.  “How can I prevent this from happening?” I asked myself. “Technically, I knew my assignment would come at the end of May. I should have anticipated this.” I thought to myself.  “Or, what if the teaching assignments had been disclosed earlier, instead of the last minute?” Maybe that is where I should direct my anger.  “That’s it!” I thought. “Dr. Smith is responsible for my inability to spend time with my family because he could have given the assignment earlier, thus giving me the chance to prepare before going home.”  As farfetched as that sounds, it is analogous to the developer, consumer and copyright holder relationship in the Induce Act. For those who are saying, “What the f*** is the Induce Act?,” it’s current senate legislation that affects the liability of manufacturers and developers who make products that  could  be used for copyright infringement.  Comparable to Dr. Smith controlling my actions based on a job assignment.  I’m sure many are now thinking, “Well, isn’t that the law now?” No – it’s not. About twenty years ago, motion picture giant Universal Studios took on Sony Corporation of America for copyright infringement liability regarding recordable VHS cassettes used with the Sony Betamax VCR. The result was the “Substantial non-infringing use” test. If the product can be used for non-infringing actions, in the case of Betamax, it was timeshifting (or recording and watching a television show at a later time without any monetary gain), then the manufacturer would not be held liable for infringements caused by the consumer. Invariable, the “people need to stop downloading illegal music” argument rears its ugly head. While I completely agree with this perspective, I do not think that holding manufacturers responsible is the answer. Semiconductors have been successful based on consumers maintaining liability for their actions – legitimate or not. Technology would be no where near as advanced and customizable had the Universal v. Sony case been overturned.  The Induct Act can partially be attributed to the MPAA/RIAA’s refusal to operate under a post-dot-com era business model. Downloadable music sites such as LivePhish and LiveDownloads (SCI) have proved and established the viability of this market, raising the question – “If it’s profitable, why the f*** won’t they do it?”  Blame the lack of trust on America’s decreasing ability to accept responsibility for his/her actions. The popular trend of fat people blaming fast food distributors for their obesity and gun owners blaming gun manufacturers for “accidental home shootings” has started to haunt us – legislatively speaking of course.  Not only could this injustice severely constrain future technology, but also if this bill passes, my thesis work could hold me liable for third party copyright liability. The work includes “securing” (or removing security vulnerabilities) from an ad hoc network layer overlay for inspecific peer-to-peer applications. All of the unfamiliar computer jargon correlates to a way of establishing direct routes between individuals for a plethora of applications, such as file-sharing (like Kazaa), anonymous message boards (like Freenet) or communications (like AOL Instant Messenger). Additionally, the “ad hoc” designation means that the network is “self-configuring”, or doesn’t require a centralized location to connect. Analogously compare it to the Motorola Talk-Abouts that people use at big shows – an established frequency to communicate allows each person to “connect” and talk without relying on an additional tower to route the communications.  However, the “applications” that will run on top of my thesis work have yet to be developed. The purpose of developing for “inspecific p2p networks” facilitates ease of transition from one application to another using the same “secure” routing information. Imagine a medium sized company purchasing blackberry-esque devices that can seamlessly and securely communicate, share files, connect with company servers etc, for internal usage by associates throughout the world. Although similar applications exist, they are not platform inspecific, comparatively incohesive and completely insecure.  According to the Induct Act, if an average person thinks that an entity “could” facilitate copyright infringement, then the manufacturers and developers, in addition to the actual direct infringer, will be held liable. I have questioned my involvement in this project, only to realize that quitting is just giving in. Why should I stop working on a valuable project because I could be sued two years down the road for copyright infringement cause by an “inspecific application” that hasn’t been created yet?    urlLink Check out the Electronic Frontier Foundation to take action against the Induce Act!
