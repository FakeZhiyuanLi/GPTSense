						    I've always wanted to do something like this.&nbsp; I probably should have started doing it a long time ago as alot has happened the past 44 years of my life.&nbsp; There is no sense trying to play catch up right here and now though.&nbsp;    &nbsp;  What is happening in my life right now?&nbsp; I'm madly in love with a man that I've been with for six years now (two of those married) and though he sometimes drives me crazy, I wouldn't trade him for anything.&nbsp; He is my soul mate, someone who accepts me for who I am and I am certain that I drive him crazy as well!&nbsp; We had a big fight yesterday morning.&nbsp; Something we rarely ever do.&nbsp; He woke up depressed and began crying.&nbsp; I became afraid that he wasn't going to go to work and panicked.&nbsp; I said some pretty mean things and now he is hurt.&nbsp; He is afraid that if he screws up just once that I am going to send him packing back to Pennsylvania.&nbsp; I know damn well I could threaten all I wanted but the minute he were to walk out that door I would be absolutely crushed.&nbsp;&nbsp; I would feel like someone had taken a knife and cut a piece of me out with him.&nbsp; Now I need to find a way to heal the wound I created.    &nbsp;  I am thinking of a tattoo.&nbsp; Four chinese characters which mean "Property of Grey" and a tribal bear paw.&nbsp; Put it on my left hip, just like he always told me a tattoo of that sort would go.&nbsp; Right where his hand touches my hip as he stands in front of me.&nbsp; I wonder if that would convince him that I'm not going to just shove him out of my life if he begins having more panic attacks?&nbsp; It's something to think about.    &nbsp;  I have my CTP certification exam this weekend.&nbsp; Once again I'm not feeling very optimistic.&nbsp; I don't know why I cannot seem to grasp this stuff well enough to pass the exam.&nbsp; It's very disheartening.&nbsp; I guess I will just keep taking it until I get it right.      &nbsp;  We're going down to Tampa this weekend for a get together at Don's.&nbsp; Not exactly sure how that is going to turn out.&nbsp; Should be interesting to see if it even pans out.&nbsp; I have a strange feeling it's not going to.    &nbsp;  I take Morgan back down to Lakeland this weekend for her to go back to school.&nbsp; I didn't plan on her being here the whole summer or I would have tried to send her to some sort of camp, but maybe next year.    &nbsp;  Still waiting to get the phone call from Steve about my filing of equitable relief with the IRS.&nbsp; I know he's going to be thrilled.    &nbsp;  Haven't heard from Cody in so long now I forget how long it has been.&nbsp; I sure wish I knew what was up with him.&nbsp; I don't know why I have the feeling that his Dad has said something to him to make him not want to talk to me but maybe it's just my imagination.    &nbsp;  I'm really liking singing in the choir at church and find that I'm disappointed if I am going to be out of town on the weekend and I can't go sing.    &nbsp;  Well I guess I'd better get back to work.&nbsp; God willing there will be many more days to jot down my thoughts and keep track of what is happening in my life.

						   Well I guess it's official, the ex gave our son until 09/15 to remove himself from the premises.  Actually he told him to either shape up or ship out and my son has elected to ship out.  So, he's 18, fresh out of high school, his only transportation is a bike, he has $1,000 in the bank and is looking to strike out on his own.  We are trying to get him to move up here but he doesn't want to leave his friends.  I don't have the heart to tell him that he won't have the same friends in another few years.  But he's 18 and the world is beckoning and there are lessons to be learned that only he can learn on his own.  My car is fixed, it's running great and I am so very happy to be able to drive myself to and from work everyday.  Not that I minded Grey dropping me off and picking me up but my time to and from work is a time of transition to either gear up for work or to wind down and I prefer to do that alone where I can control the music, the temperature of the a/c and what lane of traffic I'm in. LOL  I think that this is the very first time that I have not watched the Olympics at all!  I used to eagerly anticipate it but for some reason it doesn't hold any interest for me this year, not even the equestrian events.  Grey and I are still in our CSI kick and are currently watching the 2nd season.  Oh, I had choir practice last night for the first time.  Definitely some tough stuff to learn.  I think I will get better as time goes on.  It's not that I can't sing, it's reading the music, understanding the different symbols and words.  I was taught that stuff as a child taking piano lessons but that was over 30 years ago and I have forgotten most of it.  I need to remember what means to go faster, to go slower, to pause, to increase in volume, to be soft, etc.  I also need to remember which bar the sopranos sing or I'm going to end up accidentally being a soloist! LOL  That's it for me for today, actually a very peaceful, boring day.  Just waiting to see how long it takes for Al Safr to become a martyr.

						   Okay I know, one post and then nothing! LOL  What can I say, I get distracted!  Grey and I are getting along much better since my first post.  Nice thing about us, we may have a disagreement, but it doesn't take long before we are back to normal and being madly in love again.  Not that we ever stopped loving each other when we were arguing    I passed my CTP exam!  I didn't realize just how much stress I was under and how much pressure was on me until it was over and I felt like I was walking on air!  Now that's it's over, I look back and think "What was the big deal, now I have letters to put after my name"  But I know that if I hadn't have passed it, I would have felt horrible.  Bonnie and Charley came and went without much consequence here.  Some rainy weather, some tornados, but nothing that was any more than what we normally get during the summer.  We were mostly concerned about friends and family in Polk County which got slammed pretty hard.  Fortunately, most of the people we have down there live on the west side of the county, the east side of the county is still trying to clean up and Jeb Bush was out there yesterday to survey the damage.  I have a few friends who are still without power and are struggling to get chainsaws to cut up trees that fell on their property but fortunately no one was injured.  My best friend and I are having some problems regarding trust issues and my "interference" in her relationship with Grey.  My suggestion for anyone contemplating any kind of poly relationship?  Don't! LOL   Raven and I aren't intimate and Grey and her aren't intimate either anymore however her children regard him as their Dad and she still regards him as her Dominant.  Add me, best friend and also Dominant but not her Dominant but married to her Domminant and you get conflict LOL.  She wrote me a nice long letter yesterday outlining all of her issues.  It is going to take me a couple of days to think through the things she said and respond in a rational manner.  Tonight is my first night of official choir practice.  I guess we will be preparing for a concert that we have coming up next month and I'm sure we will soon be preparing for the Christmas programs.   I have had two bad dreams about my daughter Morgan the past week.  The first one, Grey woke me up because I was yelling and crying in my sleep.  In that one, someone came along on a motorcycle or motorscooter or something and abducted her.  Last night, she had been out playing and never came home.  I dreamt one long dream last night which I spent looking for her with a police officer.  I even woke up during the night and tried to change my thoughts so I wouldn't dream it anymore, but I kept dreaming.  Grey says that I'm having separation anxiety after having her all summer long which makes sense.  I just wish they would stop.  Just got off the phone with the ex.  He's about to kick my son out of the house because of his mouth and his attitude.   If he does, he will likely have to move up here with his mouth and his attitude and something is going to have to change.  We aren't anymore inclined to put up with it than his Dad and Renee are.  How do you get an 18 year old with a chip on his shoulder to change his attitude?  Not going to be doing much in the way of lifestyle stuff for the next couple of months.  Gator games are taking priority on Saturdays although we already have a conflict on labor day weekend as I was planning to take Grey to the season opener but he had promised Raven and the kids that they could come up that weekend.  Yet another family squabble to work out.    I need to find a slave that changes cat litter and likes to go to football games.  LOL  Wait, that's right, they don't have to like football, they just go with and keep running for cokes and pizza while I enjoy the game!  It's good to be the king. LOL  From what I understand Don and Michelle are going to Bermuda in September and won't be at Chambers anyway so not a big loss to miss that one anyway.  October is another story however, with David and Gem coming down from NYC, Lord Blakwolf and Tig's collaring at The Ranch, the Biketoberfest weekend at the ranch and a Cecil and Becca's wedding/collaring that same weekend.   October is definitely going to be party time.  Oh and let's not forget Florida/Georgia October 30, another kind of party  : )   At some point between now and then Grey will be having his surgery.  So the next couple of months promise to be very busy and then we get into the holiday season.  It will be 2005 before we know it!  Well I guess I should probably get back to work! LOL  It's nice to have a slow day every now and then.
