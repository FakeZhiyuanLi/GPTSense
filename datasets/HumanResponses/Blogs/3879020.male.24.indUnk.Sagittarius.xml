       I just wanted everyone to take note of a few fun websearches on google.  Try these two,   urlLink douchebag,  and  urlLink failure.   Both funny, both appropriate.

       Peep  urlLink this one , a Mexican jet spots some weird unexplainable shi... stuff.  My theory is that  urlLink this little incedent  was probably caused by the moon men in some way shape or form.  Go Brewers!

       Beyond the obvious reasons why one want a girlfriend, the one I miss the most is the movies.  I have a stack of ticket stubs on the headboard of my bed from each movie that I have seen since, well, sometime in high school I guess.  And the one thing I notice when I glance through them on occasion, other than the huge bloat in ticket prices since I was in high school, is the fact that many, in fact probably most of them come from the year or so I was dating Tammy.  Now the coverage was OK in HS.  Most of the big movies that were released during those days I saw in the theater.  Some, just seeing the ticket stub makes me laugh.  Like the stub from the debut of  urlLink Scream II,  when for some reason I had difficulty finding the correct theater after visiting the restroom.  Or the infamous  urlLink Summer of Sam,  where all of the boys from our group went to see a movie that still gets more than a few mentions as the "crappiest movie ever" when that topic comes up in conversation.  Seeing movies in the theater is fun, and it breeds memories.  HS was not the time of my life where I had the most bling to throw at my entertainment budget, but neither was the period when I was dating and saw more movies in the theater than any other time in my life.  But that was the time it was easiest to come up a reason to go see a movie.  It was still before we turned 21, we couldn't go to bars yet, but I'm not going to get off topic talking about how that was the real killer of creative fun in my life.  Plus the dinner and a movie date is just so  easy.   Since then though I can only think of maybe two or three movies at most I've seen in the theater.  One being the premiere of  urlLink Star Wars: Ep2,  but that is a movie where it didn't matter that I wasn't on a date, because the geek atmosphere was in full swing, and there were maybe three girls in the whole packed theater, and I don't think they were on dates.  In fact, I'd go so far as to guess that many of the people in that theater hadn't been on a date in a real long time.  But this is just such an isolated case.  Movies are better with a companion, and with the summer movie season fast approaching again, I can look forward to missing the big blockbusters  urlLink Troy,   urlLink The Day After Tomorrow,  and hell, maybe even  urlLink Harry Potter.   I'm sure as hell not going to see that one alone.  So if you know, or you ARE a reasonably good looking (said: not butt ugly) female, who can carry on a conversation well enough to not make me want to kill myself every few minutes, and is sick of missing all the good movies in the theater.  Get in touch with me.  PS. Making out is optional, but encouraged.

       I am SICK and tired of spring.  Who could find this season beautiful?  A duck?  I got the wet butt thing happening again this morning, because my car leaks.  Fricking roof!  I just want it to be summer so I can go to a Brewer game, and get my tailgaite on.  Just me, a brat, some booze, my buds, our helmets, our outfielder defamation pages, and the sunshine in a parking lot.  That's all I ask for.  Oh a large group of random hotties sitting next to us would be ok too.

       In some  urlLink good news  today Michael Moore's newest documentary, Fahrenheit 9-11, was picked up by Miramax.  In case you didn't know, Michael Moore is the "Bowling for Columbine" guy.  This strikes me as good, even though because it's Michael it will probably be a bit over the top, because after reading more on Dubya and 9/11 it just seems like there was a lot of fishy shit going on that I think would change a lot of people's mind about the current administration if they knew about it.  That is if your opinion can get any lower... :)    I guess since this is my first quasi political post on my blog, I'd be remiss to not mention  urlLink this  beauty of a site.  I just love that title.  Pretty much sums up the way I feel about this election to a T.

       In an effort to raise my  urlLink geek score  a few more points, I have started a blog.  Really that has to be the reason, because I doubt anyone I know is interested enough in reading what I think to visit here on a regular basis, and therefore make this entire project worthwile.  You know, I just realized that there is a high likelihood(sp?) that many of you that I'll initally tell about this blog, probably have no clue what the hell a blog even is.  Well for those of you who still do not have "blog" in your vocabulary I may as well give you the low down.  Blog is the shortened version of web log.  Weblogs became the most popular type of page in the days (late 90's) where people who cared enough to have a web presence started putting up personal pages.  I did this as some may remember, but my site 1. sucked 2. eventually got taken down by the Nimda virus and 3. wasn't updated nearly often enough to warrant coming back even onec a month let alone every few days.  Well, anyway some smart people got the idea to make the process to post a web log and keep it updated and looking good extremely easy.  Like sending an e-mail easy instead of publishing a website easy.  These sites are basicly the creation of a generation that grew up watching  urlLink Doogie Howser M.D.  typing away in his "personal journal" each night.  Damn that was a good show looking back on it, but I digress.  You also may notice that most blogs are riddled with links on the relevant topic.  Such as the Doogie Howser deal of a few sentences ago.  So neway recently the blog has become uber popular and it just seemed like a really good fit for me, since I type slow and often things that I'd like to e-mail and tell several people about I only tell once, because it is a bitch to type out several times.  I do plan to use this blog as my outlet for just about anything that pops into my mind, some of which may be mired in controversy.  So that's about all for now.  I'll probably get a few more posts up than just this first one before I start sending out e-mails or telling people about this little doozie.  Peace out!

       Hello, well the period of anti-politik is over, and I think not a moment to soon, really b4 I launch into all of that I’d just like to give some general announcements.  First off, It looks like Fatty has taken me up on my offer to become a co-poster on this page, so that is great.  It will be good to have some fresh blood and some fresh perspectives on here, and with his recent NPR kick I think he is joining up at the best possible time.  I’m excited to see his first post.  My weekend ended up not being as packed as what I had expected.  There was no trip to Gurnee, which in hindsight is probably a good thing as I think I would have been tapped by then.  It still sounds however like we’ll be going to Summerfest Monday night so It’s still quite a bit of running for me, but I can run for fun.  No doubts there.  So let’s see, any good movies come out over the weekend…  Hmmm.  You know I saw one called Fahrenheit 9/11 that was pretty good.  :)  But seriously, I had to drive to Madison as it was on limited release and was only shown in about 1/3 of the theatres that a movie would normally release in.  Still it grossed more than any other documentary release ever, and made more in the first day and a half than Bowling for Columbine made in it’s entire run, so needless to say, there was quite a demand to see this film.  I went to the first showing  in Madison, and there was a line like I’ve only seen for the opening of “Star Wars: Ep2” in LaX formed for tickets.  It made me very feel very happy that I had bought VIP tickets online and could walk right past the craziness.  It actually felt a lot like Star Wars: Ep2 in many ways, which was my favorite movie theater experience thus far in my life.  First off the people.  Star Wars fans are loyal and had been waiting for Ep2 for a long time.  Many of them were dressed up as characters from the first film, it was a geek paradise.  Lots of camaraderie between the fans, and people who didn’t know each other from Adam were engaged in deep conversation in line.  It was cool.  Same thing here at Fahrenheit.  Lots of chatter while we were all waiting in the second, longer line to get into the theater.  Broad range of people represented, many retirees and college students, these are of course the people most likely to be able to see a movie at noon on a Friday afternoon, but you also saw a few people who either snuck away from work, or got off early like me to be there for the opening.  And actually more conservatives there than I would have thought.  As you can imagine the audience was mostly liberal in make up, and strangely about 75% female for some reason, but the conversations sometimes were loud and you could sometimes hear where some very unpopular pro GW rhetoric had been spouted.  The other thing that was similar to Star wars was the “costumes” if you could call them that.  Many T-shirts with various slogans on them.  Some anti-war, some anti-Bush, some Pro-Kerry, some just silly.  I was wearing my “A shout out to the guy who lives at 1600 Pennsylvania Ave.” T-Shirt.  The girl next to me in line was wearing a shirt that said “I shaved mine to make this loud and clear “NO MORE BUSH!”  She was pretty cool and funny.  I had seen the slogan on other shirts before, but it was funny to see one in Madison.  But I’m glad she didn’t sit next to me, because I know I would have been distracted.  So we get inside and I got primo seating.  Like 15 rows from the screen, right in the center, an acoustic sweet spot if you know anything about the THX rated speakers that they had at this theater.  After about 20 minutes of previews some were getting antsy and booing the ads.  Here is another similarity, a very rambunctious in theater crowd that cheered parts they liked.  For instance when about halfway through the film when Wisconsin Congresswoman Tammy Baldwin popped up on screen for a maybe 15 second snippet there was a roaring cheer and clapping.  It was cool.  So the movie then I guess.  I came in knowing what this was about, obviously knowing that the film was a scathing view on Bush’s handling of foreign policy as well as his actions on 9/11.  I also knew from Moore’s past film that two things always appeared in his films.  “Stretches,” and on camera confrontations of those in power.  I have to say in this case they were not stretches of truth, but rather stretches of what I think logic would bring from certain pieces of news or connections between various people, but the connections, statements and events are true, so if you care to take more from them than I did than that is certainly your right.  The Saudi/Bush connections are all outlined in Moore’s book “Dude, Where’s My Country.”  When I read the book (which is quite well written btw) I went and checked the sources that were quoted on all of his footnotes, and found all to be there and correct.  So that was my only complaint if I had one at all.  This film blew my fucking mind.  It easily bests past documentary favorites of mine including Moore’s “Bowling for Columbine” and Steve James’ “Hoop Dreams” from 1994.  I was blown away by the frankness, writing and pace of the film.  Parts are just gut wrenching, but everything I thought was covered very tastefully, which is difficult when working with topics like 9/11 and Iraq.  The thing that is also a hallmark of Moore films is a very sarcastic extremely dry wit.  I cried at this film, which is a pretty big rarity for me.  The only films I can think of that have moved me that much in recent memory are Forrest Gump, and I am Sam.  I state these two facts because at the same time that I was moved to tears, there were those around me chuckling away at Moore’s wit.  And I think the wit works well, but me personally, I am past a point where a lot of this seems funny to me anymore.  It either saddens me to a point where I just don’t know what to do, or pisses me off to a point where I can’t even talk about it in a normal tone of voice.  I don’t want to sit and discuss the actual content of the film to any great deal, because I’ve already gone quite long here, and I know some who are planning to see it and I don’t want to give anything away.  I would however strongly, strongly recommend that everyone who can get to this movie does so.  It’s something special.  So yeah, I may gloss on this again, but we have the looming June 30th deadline upcoming, and people being beheaded by the day so I’m sure there will be plenty of other stuff to talk about until then.  Hope you all enjoyed this weekend, and thanks for reading.

       I wished this weekend would come, but now that it's here I'm overwhelmed.  This week wasn't so bad after all.  I spent some time with Tammy this week, which was nice.  I did however sort of rudely fall asleep while watching one of the Seinfeld DVDs I gave her.  It's those chairs, and the blankets over there.  They are like Mrs. Smith's voice in Physics, they just make me want to go to sleep.  I was on the end of a 24 hour awake too.  So that may have played into it.  But today is the day though.   urlLink Fahrenheit 9/11  is here.  Well not here like Dubuque exactly, but  urlLink here.   Actually at only 15 theatres here in Wisconsin.  Luckily most of you live in urban areas that are showing it like Milwaukee, LaX, and The Mad City.  I plan to see it today at 2:30.  I'll be letting you know how it is for sure.  Then it's anniversary, Pasture party on Saturday, and then Fatty has invited me to Great America on Sunday, so I'll prolly do that.  So I'm Chock full of fun this weekend.  This seems like it will be an expensive weekend to me.  I'm just guessing tho.  In any event I hope you all have good weekends.  Take it easy and be well.

       This was typed a few days ago, but didn't get posted, sorry  I read some sad news  urlLink here  this morning.  Mattie Stepanek the poet/kid with muscular dystrophy died today at age 13.  I remember seeing this kid either on TV or hearing him speak somewhere a few years ago, and even at age 10 he sounded like a person twice his age.  He had such tough luck in life, but he always had such an optimistic look on life from what I read about him in the past, that it just amazed me.  I remember him saying in his interview or whatever, that he did not fear death, which is amazing since his 3 older brothers all died of MD and his mom has it too.  I'm nowhere near death (hopefully) and I'm scared as shit of it.  Quite a kid.  It reminds me of the saying "I complained that I had no shoes, until I saw a man with no feet."  You can read one of his poems on his homepage  urlLink here .  Where it says "For Our World."  I could talk at great length about this kid, but I think I'll jyst leave it at that.  "Big ups" to you Mattie.  Tough to follow that, but I did read some good news in the State Journal this morning.  You can read about it  urlLink here.   It looks like the Badger Men's Basketball team will be playing a perennial powerhouse in just their second game of the pre-season.  This team is not a Division I powerhouse though.  Not even a Div 1-AA or a Div II school.  It's our little UWP.  Yep Badgers vs. Pioneers.  Beege vs. well shit any of the Badgers big name forwards.  Maybe even in-state phenom Brian Butch.  Mark me down for a ticket right now.  Other news of note, it looks like I'll not be getting around to the top 100 before Thursday, mainly because this week most of my musical focus has gone into collaberating with Fatty on the Summer CD 2004.  Details are limited at the moment, but I think my summer CDs have been fan favorites, and I'm sure Fatty and I's collaberation will bring the boom.  Be well.

       Ahhhh the weekend.  If only life were one long weekend.  Actually I'd only have enough money for a few weeks if all days were weekend days.  But this was a pretty good weekend, well it was probly a super ok weekend.  I'm not so sure I'd go so far as good.  Neway, I went and saw the Brewers again.  Good game.  Anytime we beat the stupid "Twin"kies it's a good thing.  If there is one thing I can't stand It's being at Miller Park and seing over half of the fans there with shirts for the other team on.  Especially Minnesota and Chicago fans.  The just seem to annoy me more.  But Fatty and I eventually saw a close Brewer victory and that's all that matters.  We were like three feet away from a foul tip, that I did not manage to come up with, but the dude who got it gave it to a little kid sitting next to me so that was pretty cool.  I also got to see Fatty's new place which is a spacious 3 bdrm with storage garage attached.  It's nice.  I did not ask how much a month, but I'm guessing It's more than my single ass can afford.  I did have to jet in the middle of the night to get home, so sorry Fatty, but I hope Connie enjoyed my illustration of the car battery and genital clamps.  :)  Saturday night was pretty uneventful.  Go out.  Have Drink.  Repeat.  Repeat.  Eat Cheeseburger.  Eat Slice of Elvis's Pizza.  Play Jukebox.  Have Drink.  Repeat.  Repeat.  Repeat.  Repeat.  Play Golden Tee.  Have Drink.  Repeat.  Go to Bathroom.  Piss and moan to Andy about how gay bars are, and swear never to go out again.  Have drink.  Go home.  This is pretty much the template of my weekends for the past few years.  I could live without it to be honest.  Hope everyone's Father's day wen't well.  I got my dad the air compressor of his dreams, but it's going to have to be a birthday present too, cuz damn, industrial air compressors are not cheap.  But the thing came with an impact wrench a brad and nail gun, and a paint sprayer too, so it was prolly worth it.  I was trying to find a picture of it, but Lowe's website uses gay Active Server Pages.  Uber Lame.  Well that wraps up the weekend.  Next weekend is The 11th Annual Pasture Party which I'll be attending for the 4th year, yipee.  In swoops the pasture party to break up the drudgery of drinking in bars.  Also my G&G Francis' 50th Wedding anniversary is next weekend, so that will be cool.  I'm happy to see anyone married that long, and when it's my family, I'm all the happier.  But I'm drawing long here, so have a good Monday if that's possible.

       Ok I know I said no politics, but this is almost completely detached from the actual election so I hope you guys will let it slide.  In past elections, for everything from president to town board I have decided to give points to a canidate based upon how hot the canidates daughters were.  Well It's been tough lately.  Bush/Gore was a tight race, because  urlLink Karenna Gore  (pictured with Tipper) was not bad looking at all, but a little old (in her 30's when I was 20) to get the nod over the  urlLink Bush girls  (4 pictures down), who are not bad either, and also have as Roach would say, a  urlLink party slut  (also  urlLink here )reputation.  But now throw new contender Alexandra Kerry into the mix, Alexandra which is a hot sounding girl name and this... (Wait if you are at work I'd wait on clicking this link until ya got home.  It's not porn or anything, but there is some incedental (whispering like Mrs. Hensley) ...nipple showing)  Ok  urlLink here .) incedent recently scores her points in my book.  She  is  30, but quite a looker.  And it really sems like older girls are very cache at the moment.  That was funny for all the right reasons.  Honestly I know this is stupid, but we would not want a repeat of  urlLink Chelsea Clinton .  God Damn!  Maybe I'm wrong, but I just get a strong Jessie U. vibe from Chelsea, and that isn't good.  Oh well, be well and have a good day.

       Well I'm still settling down from all the walleye fun I could handle this weekend.  I've decided that until June 24th I will not blog about anything political.  This is due to the fact that Fahrenheit 9/11 comes out on the 25th, and the handover of power in Iraq (which I'm sure will go just as smooth as silk... eyeroll) is on the 30th.  So I don't want to be inundating you poor souls with the politik.  On the T-Shirts, I've been looking into the screen printing facilities and should have pricing info very soon, so that is good.  I was also thinking of opening up the blog.  It's nice to see the recent comments from Temp and Snydes (even though it took Ryan like 7 tries) and I found a feature in my options settings that allows multiple posters to the blog.  It basicly means other people that I assign to be posters may make direct posts to my blog.  I think it could increase the free flow of ideas that might otherwise not come up in conversation in the limited time we get to see each other anymore, as well as help in the coordination of summer events.  And isn't that what it's all about, having an organized summer.  LOL Kim would be proud.  Yeah, so let me know If you'd be interested.  Lastly as my big week before politics project, I've decided to post one of my "Top 10" lists.  Actually this one is a top 100 list, but I was going to do my top 100 favorite songs.  I think people enjoy lists, or maybe they don't, it really doesn't matter, because I'm posting the list on Thursday and there isn't much anyone can do about it.  Then you can call me a dumbass for raking some songs too highly, or omitting a favoite of yours later.  This is really a list of relatively little contriversey (sp?) and I figured I'd start you out on the soft stuff.  Hopefully building up to better lists in the future.  So that ends this post and my Monday workday.  Have a swell night.  Oh BTW if you are the person using Broadwing Communications as your ISP let me know.  I'm baffled as to who it could be.

       Someone, possibly me, posted a whole bunch of gibberish last night when they arrived home from the bars.  I hope that this does not discredit me as a blogger or as a sane and rational human being when I'm sober.  Took in some mini golf today with Snyder and his roommates.  I was beating Snydes by 2 strokes, but then I had some "issues" with a hole with a water hazard, and he ended up beating me by 2 strokes.  Lame.  But I beat him in the off road go carts which was fun as hell, so we end up even for the weekend.  Well I best get goin' home.  Peace out blog readers.

       Peace up my peeps.  I have just got done taking in the spendidness that was walleye weekend in Fondy.  The Snyder's lo9fty prediutions wretre far from true, but hey, trying to lure m,e anywhere with women is just silly.  I did however play an ugly chick with a nice rack at darts right before bar time, because I was running my mouth and I had to put up or shut up. I won by 6 marks, but she may have taken a dive because I have such a sweet ass.  Snyder is making us a Pizza.  He has the hookups large.  I cleaned out the passenger seat of my car , that is big news.  Hey snyder just made a hell of a wingman gesture to me  (even though we are at home now) so big up s to you.  I'm hungry and tip[sy, so I'm gonna eat andhit the hay.  Walleyes 4 life!

       I was stunned to read  urlLink this news.   I wasn't stunned about what the article even says.  I was floored that someone actually thinks that this is news.  I mean anyone who has ever even  known  a female could have told you this.  5 days they hate you, 21 they don't really care either way, and the other two they are trying to rape you.  Every guy looks forward to those two days.  But I digress.  This post was supposed to be about something else..... ummmm maybe it is Fatty's recent run-in with all things electronic.  When he got his new mobile phone and was cut off 6 times during the inagural call that was actually pretty funny.  Fucking cell phones.  Now it is just down to me and Lou in the last man standing without a cell phone contest.  But I should prolly just go for it, because Lou is a welcher.  I have a better chance of seeing a hot chick in (This isn't) Oshkosh when college isn't in this weekend.  But on that that topic, Big ups to Snydes for being the first person to post a comment to the blog.  I'd also like to give props to Tam and Josh as I see their ISPs pop up on the recent visitors list a lot.  Thanks guys.  AOL and Qwest, hard to miss, of course Fatty may have a different provider now that he is jocking the DSL.  Don't touch that modem Fatty!  You know I just came back to the original thing I was talking about, almost by accident.  Damn I'm good.  Anyway, then Fatty's Xbox goes on the fritz, which was much less funny since mine is sitting on the server table at school in pieces.  Damn.  If it wasn't SOOOOOOOOO worth the effort to mod the damn XBox I'd just let the poor thing alone.  But when it's working it's the coolest and most capable piece of electronics I own, and that includes my new stuff, my PC, and my PDA.  We figure it out tonight Fatty.  Talk nerdy to me.  But when I get an e-mail that looks like it's from fatty today with a virus attached, I gotta start thinking that it might just be you Fatty.  And now to wrap up with the mandatory politics,  urlLink I see  Kerry now has a 7 point lead on Bush.  A douchebag like Kerry normally would not be able to be leading a race for president of the Cuba City High School Student Council let alone president of the USA, but he is running against Dubya, and Ross Perot might even be able to beat Dubya.  Oh yeah, Regan died.... and I really don't care.

       I, like most Americans, really only care about politics when I'm really really pissed off.  Well, maybe I care a little more than average, but if things are good it doesn't really matter who is at the helm of this country.  I can't say things are good now.  I saw  urlLink this one  today and was stunned.  I mean honestly.  Checking people at random, making them present IDs?  That sounds exactly like what the Nazi's did to the Jews in the ghettos.  Can this practice really continue that long?  I mean the fourth ammendment really says this is exactly what you can not do.  And it's not foggy.  Here:    The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized.     I mean unless they plan to issue like 50,000 warrants a day for no reason in Boston.  If searches like this make you feel safer, you are a dumbass.  If you are afraid to fly because of terrorists, you are a dumbass.  And if you are willing to give up your civil liberties, what makes this country great, for a false sense of security, you are the biggest dumbass of all.  You know I feel myself slipping into a tirade about the Patriot Act, Patriot 2, the DMCA, and all the other liberties I have seen stripped or proposed to be stripped away from us in the last few years, but I don't want to do that.  I just want to say keep your head up and be aware, because there is a lot of crazy shit going on there.  On a happier note, the water here at school is turned on again, and the toilets are flushing beautifly.  I was thinkin' about going up to Snyder's this weekend or the next.  Whichever is not father's day.  I've not been up there in so long I'm willing to go see the country music event of the summer just to visit.  Country music, I think I'd almost rather hear opera music.  You know what I think?  I think that this may have something to do with my alarm clock being accidentally tuned to a country station.  I'm sleeping like a baby and all the sudden I get 106 decibels of "Redneck Woman" in my ear.  Grrrrrrr.  I mean who does not hate the sound of their alarm clock?  Oh well, It will be fun to "Make the rounds" with Snyder again.  Peace out.

       Man do I have to go!  I drank a "liter of cola" this morning to wake me up, and man was that the wrong idea.  Now since they are working on the streets out in front of the CCHS they have shut off the water so they can replace the pipes or something.  It reminds me of the first time I met Josh's girlfiend's parents.  "Open Up!  I gotta go and no foolin'!"  I'm a dumbass.  Yeah probly only one person who reads this will get that inside joke, and that is a very good thing.  So nothing flushes anywhere around here.  It's horrid!  I may just sneak out behind the building or something.  It's times like this I'm glad I'm not a girl.    I finally got my DVDs all cataloged last night.  The  urlLink DVD player I use now  has a little database program that tells what disk is in what slot, and shows a little screenshot of the movie, and lists movie genre and stuff.  The player holds 400 disks, of which I have about 150 filled, so it was a bitch to find a particular title before.  "Lets see Star Wars: Episode 1, Maybe disc number 58.... Damn!  Maybe 64?.....Damn!   Ok 76?... oh wait here we go.... nope, Damn!  Aw the hell with this!"  But this player should solve my problem of having discs strewn all over the house.  What me not organized?  Yeah I know.  I bought a TV too.   urlLink This one  actually.  It is the same size and type as the one Tammy's parents have, if you can remember that one from New Years' past.  So I figure I've caught up with Tammy's parents in one aspect of my life, now if I could just catch up with the Temperlys.  Then I'd really be a high roller.  You know that joke isn't as fun to tell if you can't hear the people around you instantaneously burst into laughter, but I must admit it was still quite gratifying.  I tried changing the way the blog looked today, all I really wanted to do is make this white column here a little wider.  But I quickly realized that I do not know XML at all.  It's painful when your nerdy inadequacies stare you directly in the face, not quite as bad as being depantsed in the winter, I mean that is real inadequacy, but not fun.  So it stays the same, which is prolly good because some of you are looking at this page on itty bity monitors, and wouldn't want this column any wider.  Oh well I'd better get back to reading the excitement that is the owner's maual for Dell Optiplex series desktops.  Youch this job is lame.

       Just because I've been pondering styles of dress and whatnot lately I decided to throw  urlLink this one  in.  Thought It was good for a laugh.  I wish this freakin blogger had a spell check, cuz I seem to be having a lapse in the spelling area of my brain lately.  In case anyone cares other than the band members, it looks like the 2003 version of the Lawn Chair Debacle T-Shirts will be printed soon.  We made the shirt for last summer, but it was not printed because of our lack of screen printing facilities (because of Mom's changing jobs) and also because the design this year is so intricate we decided it would prolly be best to have them professionally done.  I did not go over the tour dates recently, but I remember there will be big shows at the Mississippi River, and also at the Hazel Green Sewage Treatment Facility, which I really think will be a big show.  The tour dates were trimmed back from the 2002 tour, because we had way to many girls chasing after us after our extensive touring scedule, and also because the shirts were kinda hard to read.  But this tour is off the hook.  Fatty or Andy can verify, but we cut this final list from about 60 legit funny ideas, so we trimmed the fat and left you, our fans, with nothing but the solid good shit.  The reason I mention this is two fold.  One because I thought that some of you might want one of these super swell high fashion t-shirts, and two, to get you people using the comment area.  Temp told me this weekend he was on the verge of commenting, so jump on it guys!  If you'd like a t-shirt, comment with size and number of shirts and I'll hook you up.  They will be either yellow or gray (not ash, I hate ash tshirts, but gray) and we will get them to you at our cost and not a penny more.  Show your support for the LCD today.  In other news, I had a pretty swell weekend, most of which was spent "sleeping it off."  But I always have a good time going out with FT (or TT or MST or whatever.)  And it was cool to see the Madison "city slickers" that were in our group this weekend.  My only gripe is if you are going to bring people home, bring home people without boyfriends.  Jeesh, what is it with couples hanging out with other people in relationships these days.  Also because of some off the cuff sing-a-long-ing on the way home with Drewsy I'm on a Jimmy Buffet kick.  Not bad at all.  Well I'm running long, so thx for reading, and have a kick ass week.

       I just had to say something about the 15th anniversary of the Tiananmen Square protests/massacre.  I've looked at the picture of the guy standing in front of the tanks hundreds of times over the years, in fact when I say "Tiananmen Square" it is the image that will pop into most peoples heads.  If an image pops in at all.  I was kind of suprised in talking to people around school today that some had no clue what Tiananmen Square was all about, and this is something that is huge news that happened during our lifetime.  I'd devote at least 5 minutes and a quick Google search if you don't know anything, or even much about it.  But I look at the photo which has to be one of the greatest and most expressive of the last century, and it just inspires the hell out of me.  The lone guy, nothing but two bags of groceries in his arms, standing there balls to the wall staring down three tanks, because of a belief.  Someone who is willing to die for their cause cannot be defeated.  It's the struggle that makes the eventual success great.  I don't really know if I have an ideology that I'd be willing to die for, but in this country we already have it so good, there isn't the urgency like in China.  In any event though I gotta give props to the dude, who is to this day unidentified, read more about that  urlLink here.   If I don't check in on this busy weekend, have a good one!

Yeah it goes like 'dis R-A-M-B-U-N-C-T-I-O-U-S  Yeah, bitch!  What's up?  I before E except after C mother (frogger!)  It of course would be voiced over like that because it would be on regular TV.

       Sometimes when I'm walking around the halls at work here, especially now close to summer, I think back to the things that I thought were super racy on girls when I was in high school.  And I realize just how far skanky clothing has come in the past few years.  I'd be totally fucked in this situation.  I had a kid who I was talking to the other day, and I asked him why he had all kinds of homework left the hour after his study hall.  (Normally this kid has stuff done by the time he sees me.)  Anyway, the kid is like, "Well to be honest, I spent all hour staring at (Name omitted)'s thong sticking out of her pants."  My time in HS was full of time wasted/lost to sexual fantasy, I can only fathom what kind of sensory overload I'd go into if you shipped "1994 Jeff" ahead ten years in time to today.  My head would explode!  And some would say, "Those girls today, they are trashier than when we were in school.", etc.  (And girls would say that, cuz they are catty)  But you know what?  The same amount of people are getting laid as any other time in the past I would guess, nobody is trashier now than before, just the clothes are.  I believe it was Dave Chappelle who said (or something to this effect) "I have had women come up to me and say, "Just because I dress like this, it does not make me a whore!"  And that's right, just because a person dresses a certain way, does not mean that they are a certain way, and we have to respect that.  But ladies, you got to understand, that is fuckin' confusing.  You may not be a whore, but you're wearing a whore's uniform."  Oh Chappelle you funny bastard.  Oh wait, check  urlLink this article .  It's why I went on this tirade in the first place.  Big ups little girl!  On the topic of Chappelle, anyone interested should check out the new standup DVD of his I came across.  It is great.  Hey, come check it out on my new TV.  It's times like these I wish I lived in Madison, cuz we could have movie night.  Not much demand for an event like that here.  Frickin job in the sticks!  Oh well, it has it's perks, I get to stare at high school girls thongs all day long! (

       Hola, all.  I just wanted to throw out some quick info today as I had some stuff I had planned on writing about this afternoon, but it didn't really fit with this stuff I just found this morning.  First off a funny story, or so  not  funny that it  was  funny I guess.  I was sitting at home watching the convention (Democratic National Convention in case you live under a rock) and marveling at the only 1 hour of coverage they have decided to give to the conventions this year.  One hour for four days.  Four hours total.  12 on PBS where I watch, but that means we devote 30 times the TV coverage to choosing an American Idol as we do an American President.  Yes, even in an election where there is actually a difference between the candidates, nobody still gives a fuck.  Sad shit, but the funny was when my dad is like dissing some comments made about Kerry.  Just picking a fight it seemed, begging me to say something.  But I remained silent.  Because the last time we discussed politics, by the end I was really letting the expletives fly, and we didn't talk to each other for like 4 days.  I really don't swear around my parents that much, but that day it was muthafukin' zero hour, and I just flew off the handle.  But back to last night, this went on for a bit until dad is like "He won't even get a third of the vote, Bush is going to win by a landslide."  And that was about all I could take, so I'm like, "Have you lost your fucking mind?  Victory by a landslide?  Kerry is up by two points now, and so called "undecideds" end up voting overwhelmingly democrat.  For Bush to win by a landslide, everyone in the middle east would have to make up, hold hands, and sing "Kumbaya," Gas would have to drop to about 98 cents a gallon, and Michael Moore would have to make another documentary that shows Bush playing with baby bunnies or something."  I think Bush's campaign should hire my dad, because nobody apparently has a more rosy view of Bush's chances in this election than my dad.  I'm not saying it's good or right, but people are too high strung and divided these days.  If Bush gets re-elected somebody is going to go Lee Harvey Oswald on him.  But I don't think he'll be re-elected so I don't think we'll have to worry about this.  On a much more humorous news report, check out  urlLink this sweet little mama  I found.  If news on the web thinks it can hide from me, I laugh heartily.  I just enjoyed the picture so much, because it reminded me of the camo chair.  Black sweater, black background = Kim's floating head.  She's incognito.  :)  Talk to you later hopefully.

       So the sixth annual camporee was this weekend.  The big story of the weekend, but stuff happened while we were gone I figured I should touch on first.  First off, Lance Armstrong won number six, which is incredible.   urlLink This one  kind of compares the feat with other great sport streaks.  I'd certainly pick him in my list of the top 5 athletes of all time.  Cheers to you Lance!  But the biggest news of the week or the month (possibly the year) is Steven Hawking's comments on black holes.  Hawking, although I'm sure many of you have heard of him already, is the number one guy in quantum/astro physics.   urlLink What Hawking is suggesting  (and I tried to find an article that explains it as simply as possible) really changes a big part of what we had held as truth in the field of relativity.  I've been looking to find some physics junkie type people ever since to chat about it.  Fatty called me at like 10:30 the night he drove home, he's like "Turn on NPR, there's a show on about black holes!"  I love these calls, half because Fatty is listening to NPR and half because my friends know my holy trinity of nerdiness (black holes, giant squids, tidal waves) and will call and tell me when a show is on about them.  I still hear from Snyder about the squid spermatozoa.  I may write more on this when I have a better handle on the new info.  Ok, so camping now.  Good site, Good weather, OK food, OK time.  I give it two and a half stars.  With no disrespect to Joe and Kreul I did miss having  my  guys there on Saturday, but it was probably about as interesting as it could have possibly been.  For about 45 mins. to an hour on Saturday, we actually carried on what I would consider a rational adult discussion, which was amazing but nice.  You see I say I love to hear the big fights we get in, that is really not true.  I say I enjoy them because sometimes it happens when we come to an impasse on something we were discussing.  Other times it's just someone "cheating" at Outburst or Sequence, which I can live without.  I really find that most people do not want to have to defend an opinion in discussion, some don't even form opinions on important topics, that is why I was happy to see Saturday.  The conversation, on religion no less, never broke down to just yelling and shouting the "F-Word" at each other.  Or did it?  I did hear a stream of obscenities flowing from our campsite all the way over at the bathroom.  :)  Very relaxing all in all.  Tammy and I left at like 4:30 Sunday afternoon, right before my head exploded in a giant allergy ball.  I believe a fun time was had by all.  We should start on those lucky 7th anniversary t-shirts right now you know.  Then, just maybe they'll be ready on time for next year.

       Not that Michael Moore needs to score more points with me, but I read  urlLink this one  today and about choked on my Twizzler. Of all of the many rants that Moore has gone on in years past this is by far my favorite one, because it deals with peer to peer and digital rights. Honestly in the last election, handling of digital copyrights was about 25% of my decision for who I voted for for both president and governor. I'd say that's borderline fanatic about the issue. This election it will be the last thing on my mind, because I've come to see that it really doesn't matter who is in power between the two major parties, no improvements will ever be made in this arena by the government. Unless a Libertarian or something were to be elected president. But that will never happen. That is about as likely to happen as a Tupac Shakur/Notorious B.I.G. ticket winning the election in 2008. But in any event (I got  way  off track there) I'm glad to see Moore giving his blessing to the people like me, who paid for a ticket (and probly will see it again), plan to buy the DVD when it's released, and are only looking for one of these "illegal" downloads to tide us over till the DVD release. Even Moore's movie house Lion's Gate seems not to have a problem with it. So if anyone is interested, I may or may not have a copy...  urlLink  This is funny    urlLink This is funny    urlLink This might come in handy this weekend    urlLink and This is just getting stupid

       What be the lowdown my G's? I gots ta say that here on the backend, the blogspot just got a lot dope-er. I mean if I really cared enough to edit the HTML/XML before, I could have done all the cool shit I can do now, but now all kinds of options only a button push away. Thankfully they added a spell checker so I can stop composing in Word and then pasting into the blog post application. But you can Change  fonts  now, change  c  o  l  o  r  s , change alignments and stuff and even an add pictures button it looks like.  I'll have to test that out in some later post.  I'm not really one for bling bling posts, or even bling bling e-mail for that matter.  I'm the one who turns off the rich text so I can just type an e-mail that isn't in stupid Times New Roman or some other dumb thing.  So I would not expect any visual changes on the site other than better spelling maybe.  So it's Friday huh?  "It's Friday, you ain't got no job, and you aint got shit ta do..."  If you haven't seen Friday with Ice Cube that was just a really stupid sentance.  I do in fact have a job, but I don't have shit to do.  Temp said something about comin' home to do some Buncome fishin' but I have not heard anything more since.  I'm not sure if i wrote anout this but I went fishing in Buncome the other evening and got raped by the gnats, or some other little bitey ass bug.  If I had a parrot or something else that would eat those mothers, I woulda been having a great time.  After an hour and a half or so (no bites but the water is pretty high and fast right now) and the trip was cut short.  Why?  Either a broken or slipped fucking knot.  Can you believe it?  Me, the one who held the knot tieing record for Troop 86 and 122, and the second fastest time ever at Canyon Camp over the ropes course (Boyscout ropes course is eight knots:  urlLink bowline,   urlLink sheet bend,   urlLink square knot,   urlLink two half hitches,   urlLink sheepshank,   urlLink timber hitch,   urlLink clove hitch,  and  urlLink taut-line hitch ) forgot the second loopthrough in  urlLink my fisherman's knot.   Mother of pearl!  Now I need a new chartruse single spinner.  Oh well it's better than fucking up on a  urlLink Rappala knot  and losing a five or six dollar lure.  But homo nonetheless.  So yeah if anything else is going on let me know, cuz I'm tapped.  Maybe I'll call Andy.  Or go with Kim to F911 since no random women from Madison have contacted me lately wanting to see that film.  Hope all of you have something fantabulous planned for the weekend, and all goes well.

       Well it's my wrist actually not my elbow, but perhaps my mom was right for once.  I'm not sure I ever posted about getting a skateboard on here, but I did.  I have always kind of wanted one.  Not because of Tony Hawk, or Bucky Lasek, but because of  urlLink Julie  from Real World: New Orleans.  She was the Mormon from Wisconsin, who incidentally rode a skateboard.  I'm not sure if they showed her on her board more than once, but I do remember that that is what made me want a skateboard.  Wierd.  She seemed ok on the show, she wasn't a huge skank, but I really gained respect for her after reading a bit into her after (like a year after) the show was over.  A girl who understands the beauty of one of the top 5 films of all time, Fight Club, and can identify with it's message as evidenced by  urlLink this,  is cool with me.  Anyway she was skateboarding through the airport and I thought to myself "Man, I really want a skateboard."  So anyway my dream of skateboard ownership recently became reality, but I did not get out riding till yesterday.  Mom was like "You are going to wear pads and a helmet right?"  What can you say to that...?  I'm sure the typical kid response would have worked, "But mom I don't want to look like a dork!"  but I chose the much more truthful and less traditional "Fuck that, I paid to much for the board, I'm not buying all kinds of accessories too!"  So I am looking like a total fucking dork even without the pads up in Southwestern's school parking lot practicing standing up while pushing the skateboard, and then kind of slowly rolling down the almost nonexistent incline and trying to pactice turning.  I can not yet push the skateboard with my one foot and get going and then transition into getting on with both my feet.  In short: I really suck so far.  But I can remember a time in my life when I couldn't ride a bike, and as it ended up I could do that pretty well once I could stay up without crashing.  So I had the first of what will probably be many skateboard crashes.  I was kinda just standing on the board trying to practice balancing, and I leaned forward to try to get rolling.  I went forward, my skateboard went backwards at an incredible rate, and my wrist stopped my fall.  For a second I thought my Mom may have been right about the pads.  Those thoughts were quickly replaced by thoughts like OWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW!  I stand by my no pads position though.  I only hurt my LEFT wrist, so I hardly notice.  :)  In any event I just wanted to give congrats to Tammy on her new temp to own (hopefully) job.  With that I'm done for today.  Pray for my stupid ass's saftey.

       I decided to throw in that slightly homo reference as an allusion to something later in this rundown of my weekend, so stay on the edge of your seats for that one.  I ended up going up to Madison to visit Candy and Ryan and take in some of the ESPN Great Outdoor Games.  If you don’t know the website for the GOG it’s  urlLink here.   (that was kind of an inside joke, but informative I hope)  Anyway I got to see the team timber relays which was pretty exciting as it included pole climbing, chain sawing, axe chopping, and other various talents into one big relay event.  I can’t recall who actually won gold, but the gray team’s saw girl was the best looking, and so I give them the gold in my mind.  Sunday was exactly what a Sunday should be, some laying around while waiting out the rain, watching nature programs on PBS while switching between a NASCAR race, and Tour de France coverage.  Then after the rains came, Ryan and I joined Roach on his spiffy new boat and attempted to trick fish into biting our rubber lures.  No fish fell for my delightful presentation of several plastic and steel baits.  No fish fell for Temperly’s presentation of various plastic and steel baits.  Roach caught three white bass, because I think he cheats somehow.  I did however buy a new fishing rod (those reading only to see where the “rod thing” would come up can stop right here) and reel.  It’s a  urlLink Fenwick Eagle series 6.5 ft rod,  and a  urlLink Shimano Sedona 2500FB Front Drag reel.   Temperly didn’t call me an idiot after purchasing either, so they must be at least ok.  We revisited the infamous “Jeff…..Jeff Lange” Arby’s on our little shopping trip and I’m pleased to report that there were no incidents this time.  I did not spot anyone with a Tec-9 charm on their chain either so maybe they’ve got some better help at that franchise.  Being out on “The 10,000 acre lake” just before dark was beautiful and when all was said and done I wasn’t to upset about getting skunked fish-wise.  So now back to another crappy work week.  Gotta make the ends I guess.  Oh, btw it sounds like, in a new development in my continuing quest for an apartment, I may be living with Cindy for the next 11 months.  I’ll keep you posted on that one.  Big ups and peace out.

       Fresh off another ass raping at the hands of violent inner-city youths Fatty (aka. Soars with Eagle, Kicking Horse, and Smells Like Turd) has figured out how to work his PC and accept my blog team invite.  As the only person who responded to my open call for co-bloggers, Fatty was subjected to a rigirous screening process that involved several full cavity searches.  Even though many strange items  were  found in his various body cavities, Fatty has been accepted to the Blog sidekick training program.  He has the same authority in the blog as I do which means he can add posts and/or delete posts if a blog viewer were to get unruly and start oh I don't know, knocking my ravishing good looks, lol.  Yes, I'm looking in your direction Cripes!  I've yet to hear any weekend plans either, Snydes are you comin' home?  I'm not going to sit home for a second weekend in a row.  I'll go hang with FT if I have to.  Speaking of FT, I was driving home via a slightly different path than I normally drive last night trying to search for unsecured wireless networks in Hazel Green. (there are 8, which is all of them, in case neone was wondering.)  And I see all kinds of digging going on over at the "Old Temperly Ranch."  And since HG is the nosiest fucking place on the face of the earth, I decided to swing in and ask Brooke what was going down.  I figured it was something to do with the city and FT's flowage that he's always bitching about.  No, apparently some old people are building a house there.  Such a typical FT move.  Sell some land, pay off your new truck, get some oldies to build a house so you don't have to look at the city flowage running through your property anymore.  If only we could all live the FT lifesyle.  Ahhhh... well that about wraps it up.  Once again my big welcomes to a new blogger, hope your time spent here is very key.  And once again an open call if you have an opinion and you'd like to express it on this blog, join the team.  I'm really very gentle when cavity searching...  ;^p

       Alright meow, this is my first official Blog post.  I feel honored that Jeff decided that the things I say may be relevant enough to grace the screens of his blog's readers...I am truly touched.  I do have to say off the bat that I plan to post very unapologetically.  It's gonna be like listening to a movie's commentary here (that is if anyone besides Jeff or I do that) my views aren't necessarily those of the owner of this blog.  I plan on posting my sincere feelings and opinions on many different subjects in a multitude of areas.  Chances are, everyone that reads the posts won't agree with what I have to say (including Jeff).  I just want to post in the manner that I think Jeff wants this Blog to stand for...a place to view the world through the eyes of someone else, even if just in small doses.  I am just hopeful that what you see through my eyes is interesting enough that you return for more.  In saying this, I would like to leave you with  urlLink this , to see if you are just that little bit "off" enough to truly walk away from this experience undaunted.

       Articles like  urlLink this one  piss me off.  You see the same thing about the music industry, how they are losing billions to music pirates.  Wake up people!  For the most part, you aren't losing dick.  Just because somebody pirates some software or music does not mean that they would have actually bought it were they not able to get it for free.  I have some songs by the Backstreet Boys and the Dixie Chicks, does this mean they lost sales revenue because I didn't buy those albums.  Hell no, because there isn't a chance in a million that I would have ever actually purchased those albums to get the songs I wanted to hear.  I would have learned to live without them.  I heard that William Hung (the uber crappy American Idol's) rendition of Ricky Martin's "She Bangs" is one of the most popular downloads on the internet lately.  You know why that is?  Curiosity.  Everyone wants to hear that train wreck of a song, but nobody is dumb enough to buy the CD.  If you think those people who downloaded that crappy song would have actually gone out and purchased the CD had they  not  been able to download it, you're in a fucking dream world.  Maybe one out of every ten or twenty thousand people if they are lucky, and if you divide the number that these industries say they are losing by 20,000 they really don't look that bad.

       It's sports day here at the blog spot.  I choose to highlight two sports that are at the top of my mind at the moment.  The first is of course  urlLink The Tour de France.   It's July, and for me that means the tour, just as March is college basketball's month.  I had been meaning to mention it for a bit, but just had to today as Lance Armstrong is now again in the yellow leaders jersey.  Usually I'm not a big fan of the type of cyclist who wins the tour.  They are usually the distance runner types who weigh as close to nothing as possible.  Even in my cycling days I was not this kind of rider, and now... well yeah... I'm not as close to nothing as I could be, we'll just say.  I was always partial to the big sprinters like  urlLink Mario Cipollini  and  urlLink Marty Nothstein,  because this is how I rode.  These are the guys that are all about speed and fast finishes, really the only thing exciting about cycling for the layperson.  Lance is really kind of an enigma, because he was one of these big power guys back in the day before he got cancer, but now he's kind of turned into one of the distance guys.  Oh well.  It will of course be another hotly contested tour, and I plan to cheer for Lance again this year, but this year is it.  This year if he should go on to win will be his 6th in a row, the most tour wins in a row ever, and the most overall ever.  He'll be beating out tour legend Miguel Indurain (who won 5 in a row in the 90's), and cycling's Michael Jordan, Eddy Merckx (who won 5 spread out in the 70's.)  Next year I'll be cheering for Tyler Hamilton.  He was one of the youth counselors when I was at cycling camp in '93 and he was the counselor that stayed in our room.  So I know him pretty well.  We still shoot an e-mail each other's way a couple of times a year.  But this year he's in 8th right now, and in future tours I'll be cheering for him to win it all, especially since Lance has now kind of joined the "glitterati" by dating Cheryl Crow.  I know you guys will prolly not be watching TDF coverage on the Outdoor Life Network or anything, but I just thought I'd let you know it was going on.  Moving on to a much more "bling bling" type of sport, my second one is street hoops.  I got to look at the And 1 Mixtapes and they are amazing.  The things these inner-city kids can do with a basketball are fucking amazing.  The best footage in the tapes comes from the Rucker Park Tournament in New York.  "The Ruck" as it's called is basically street hoops' Mecca. They have tournaments there, and it's common for NBA stars to go there to play against the street guys to try and gain some street cred.  And it's funny as shit to see these millionaires get worked by the playground legends.  It's really my favorite kind of basketball.  If you can get your hands on the And 1 Mixtapes do so, because some of the stuff is just amazing.  A lot more amazing than Fatty bouncing a basketball off my face while trying to show me his new moves he picked up at Ethan Allen.    Hey before I go, is anything exciting going on this weekend?

       How's it going blog people?  I have been remiss in posting for a bit, but hopefully everyone got a well needed break from my rants and the monotonies of my life.  In one of his comedy sketches Chris Rock is talking about having conversations with his wife/girlfriend, and he says “There comes a point in a relationship where you’ve heard every fucking thing this person has to say, and your thinking, go out and get kidnapped or something, get some new stories.”  While I didn’t go out and get kidnapped, I did have an odd Thursday, and I was thinking of this line the whole time.  I use a program called Skype, which is kinda like what AOL IM was only with voice chatting.  Only it’s not like voice chatting which has been around forever, it’s actually Voice over IP which is what big companies use to route phone calls over the internet instead of the telephone lines to save money.  It’s a cool little application.  I use it to talk to people I play games online with in Alaska and South Dakota, but I digress.  I just wanted you to know what the hell I was talking about.  So I usually get about 2-3 “calls” per day, usually from like Uzbekistan or Denmark or someplace weird like that, people who are setting up the application and trying to test it out by calling overseas.  I never really answer those calls.  So Thursday I get a call from Madison, WI from somebody named Bonnie, and I figure maybe this is the internet moniker of somebody I know.  So I send a text message that I don’t have my headset hooked up and through text messages I realize I’ve never met this person before.  This is noon.  To RAPIDLY fast forward this story for brevity, by 3:30 I have decided that it would be a good idea to go to Madison to re-see Fahrenheit 9/11 (her idea not mine,) by 5 we are having dinner at a State Street café, by 8 I’ve realized the movie is sold out at all theaters for the rest of the night, by 10 by some odd twist I am assisting in the purchase of (ahem) marital aids with her and her friend, and by 11:30 I was on my way to Fatty’s to try to sort out a very odd night.  It’s the stuff that I left out there that I think make the story so strange.  But it is not something I really do normally.  I’m not really the person that hauls off and meets internet wierdos (myself included.)  There are people I’ve known for eight or more years on the web who I’d never dream of actually meeting.  But it was kind of a fun thing to do “just for the hell of it” for some life experience, and Bonnie was cool.  Btw besides the vibrators, no weird sexual shenanigans took place here.  I’m not  that  dude.  I’m just glad the “Jeffymobile” wasn’t stolen, and I wasn’t gang raped by burly men.  It’s not something I plan to do again on a regular basis, but a very interesting Thursday indeed.  I did get to work more with Fatty on the Summer CD when I was up there, and it’s sounding really good so far.  The weekend was kind of gay though as nobody was really doing anything that I heard of.  I missed the Rhythm and Booms fireworks in Madison for the first time in 10 years, which is really quite a shame as my traditions are dieing around me.  They did get rained out Sunday though so it wouldn’t have been the best year to be there.  So now camping trip my only remaining yearly tradition will have to be extra good.  I’m crossing my fingers as I’ve just not had that much fun the past few years.  But hopefully this is the year that restores the good name of the camping trip.  So as not to make each post a mile long I’ll wrap this mother up now.  Have a good day.

       I was reading  urlLink this  news story today and thinking about the butt raping we will all be taking in a few months when the over 25% increase in crude oil trickles down to gasoline. Now of course this looks bad for Bush, and the more pissed people are about gas prices in November, the better for his removal. So bring on 2.50 a gallon. But seriously my thoughts quickly wandered to the extreme changes in gas prices over the past 10 years or so. On our class trip one of the gas stations we drove past in western Nebraska had gas for .69, when I was 5 and my parents and I went to South Dakota we bought gas for a quarter at some ghost town gas station. Dad in his usual cynical way predicted that it was probably half water. :) But cheap gas played a big part of my life. In high school I was for the most part flat broke. But three bucks would buy a couple of hours of driving time around Buncome, listening to CDs, shooting the breeze, trying to find Scales Mound. My hand on the wheel, Cherry Skoal in my lip, Temperly knocking back a few penicillan flavored beers from his old man's fridge in the barn, windows down, the wind in my... stubble. That was independence, that was good times. Would we have done this if we had to pay twice as much or more for gas? Probably, but not much. The joyride has been a hallmark of high school males since there were cars around to drive. Whatever kids are doing these days I'm sure it is not as cool as driving around Buncome, and I lament that loss. It's six years later and I already have one of those "When I was a kid such and such only cost a dollar." I think that's kind of funny.  Oh BTW sorry for the sparse posts this week. I usually blog on my lunch break, and I've been home feeding the kittens at noon all this week. As soon as they can eat solid foods I'll be back to normal pace.

       Well I just wanted to give some blogspace and a proper eulogy to my cat Hemi who died Friday of car tire related complications.  Hemi was 16 months old and is survived by five two week old kittens.    I officially claimed Hemi as my pet early last summer.  She had been hanging around our house for about a week, and following dad around as he was beginning to build the retaining wall behind our new garage.  He preliminarily named her “Pesky” because he considered her quite a nuisance.  Well, one night after Andy and I got home from the bars a bit loopy, and Hemi was there to greet us, Andy suggested that a pet might be good for me.  I agreed and decided to name my cat Hemi after the line of engines used in Mopar vehicles.  I felt it was a fitting name as this cat would get to purring almost before you even pet her.  Well that and those Dodge commercials are hella funny.  I always contested that Hemi was less of a pet and more of a utilitarian animal.  From the first few days that I had her I would play chase the ball of string with her.  We worked up from golf ball to tennis ball sized “mice,” and eventually worked up to larger targets.  I’ve owned cats before and some will not chase something even half their size, but Hemi eventually would go after a football sized target, which was really rare but good, as she on occasion would kill a rabbit that seem to love to eat baby trees.  She was good at what she did.  But as much as I said that she was there strictly for rodent control, I realize now that I really grew attached to her as a pet.  Some say that all cats want from their humans is food, and to an extent that is true, but it always made me feel good when Hemi would greet me outside my car door after work, even if her dish of food was full.  It was nice to have someone that was happy to see me home every day, and I miss it already.  Nobody comes running across the yard now when my car rumbles down the driveway, and although I’m eye dropper feeding her babies, I doubt I will keep any, as I can’t take the emotion of losing more pets.  Hemi was buried Friday afternoon at the foot of the retaining wall where I first met her, I thought it was fitting that she would be as close as possible to the garage that was basically built during her lifetime.  Big ups, and peace out Hemi.  Dad took over the kitten feeding duties this weekend for a day and I got to visit Fatty.  We went to Great America in the late afternoon and got to ride 3 rides.  Superman, which was key but short, coulda used like 1500 more feet of track, Vertical Velocity (or V2 he he) which was pretty dope except for the complete stop on the second time up the back portion of the coaster.  It’s a jolt that really just seems like something that is designed to knock off glasses and Birkenstock sandals, and didn’t really add to the ride I felt.  And then Batman, which is just a classic, and is about the perfect length and speed.  Fun times.  The night ended nicely enjoying some cigars and the nighttime air, and watching some of the Bowling for Columbine: Disc 2 content.  Good times.  Oh yeah and e-mail me if you are having trouble posting messages, or replies or whatever, because I am and I was wondering if it was just me.

         I went last night to Fahrenheit 9/11 for the third time with Kim, Candy, and Jenny B. That would set the new record for most times I've seen a single movie in the theater during it's original run. I've seen one other movie 3 times but it was twice on the original release, and then once in like a re-release theatre like the Rivoli, or something. That was Home Alone. But I'm glad to see this record fall, because although Home Alone was a hit in it's day, and still is one of my faves, a comedy other than Dumb and Dumber didn't deserve the top spot. But it was an odd showing in a really crappy theater. Obviously much smaller crowds than the first two times I saw it (Opening day in Madison, and a week later when it opened in Platteville) which really changes the feel of the show, and in a very antiquated theater that I could not get over the whole showing. I'll never see it with better crowd involvement and interaction then in the art house type theatre I saw it in on opening day in Madison. This was a sellout show, at noon on a weekday, and obviously comprised of people who cared enough to take a half day or something like I did to be there. Cheers and boos came from the crowd at certain parts, and there was genuine emotion. With maybe 30 people in the theatre in Dubuque the other night that just wasn't there, but these are the people who care less. If you haven't seen the movie by now, it pretty much means you fit into one of a few groups:             People who don't want to see the film at all, which I don't understand because if Fox News or something put out a documentary tomorrow showing all Bush's good deeds I'd be there just to have both sides of the story. I mean how long could a movie like that be? Six maybe seven minutes? I could take that.        People who are interested mostly because of the buzz and less because of the politics, which I also don't understand, because I'm amazed that anyone can't have a decision made by now. But hey, that's what we call a swing voter I guess.        And lastly people who have been living in a hut in Africa for the last 12 months. Which I think is pretty self explanatory.         But anyway the theatre sucked. The screen was too small and was cutting off the edges of the picture so you couldn't see the names and titles of some people, which is really pretty important. And the sound was stereo at best. There were no speakers behind us. You need to be enveloped to truly appreciate the film I think, which is why I'm inviting anyone who wants to come over to my apartment (wherever that turns out to be) the day after the DVD release and see the film as it was meant to be seen. In crystal clear high definition on a Trinitron tubed screen with Dolby DTS-ES/THX Select audio. I'll let you sit as close to the screen as you want, but as you know from your mom "If you sit to close to the screen you'll go blind." Nobody really was just balling their eyes out though last night, and I'm not sure if that was because of the kind of people who made up the crowd, or because the cruddy theater made me feel like I was watching a movie instead of just standing right there. I still can't make it through dry, but it's less of a sad tears thing, and more of a seeing red from anger eyes watering thing. I can remember very few things I'm more passionate about than the removal of Bush and his ilk from the white house, which is why it was odd to have Jenny along last night. I didn't want to just flip out, which I'm sometimes known to do when I'm talking about something I'm really passionate about. Kim and Candy have both seen me get all worked up about something and go on a rant, but I didn't want to look like an idiot in front of Jenny who I doubt ever has seen that. Plus I just get a genuine feeling of intelligence and knowledge from her. I mean for someone who has been in central Africa she's better informed on both topics and issues than many people I know here in the states. And I get the feeling like if I were to actually get into a debate about something we differed on that I could lose, which I think is really cool and I don't know many people like that. But the discussion is what I love. I mean people like Ryan or Josh are happy to throw down on just about any given topic, and have an opinion, which I dig. It's probly why they are my friends. But wholehearted discussion can't really be forced, it has to just happen, and a movie like this, like any other movie with a message (that means something  not  like Spiderman II, White Chicks, or the Terminator. :) can be just the stimulus some people need to begin the dialog. I mean you can't walk out and not at least have an opinion of the film. And I like that. I hope everyone has a good weekend doing weekend stuff, or as much weekend stuff as you can get done this weekend. Wow I accidentally put the word weekend 4 times in that last sentence. The Jeff Lange weather station predicts rain this weekend. Hopefully it holds out long enough for Fatty and I to go to Great America, and long enough for Temperly and I to get some fishing in. Be well everyone and peace out!

        urlLink 417.5 billion dollars for defense spending?   Yeah that sounds like a good amount for that.  Let me see I'll just pay upfront for that right now.  Oh wait, that's right we are  already  running a massive deficit.  Do you take Master Card, can I write you a check?  Don't worry Jeff Lange's kids will eventually pay for this, we don't have to pay for this all right now...   What the fuck are we doing?  Who are we fighting against?  China?  This  defense  budget is  urlLink twice what China spends in it's  entire  budget.   That's right twice their entire national budget, not just defense.  Oh and North Korea?  Yeah, we spend three times more than  urlLink North Korea's  entire gross domestic product,   to research the creation of just the Joint Strike Fighter (JSF) aircraft.  Just one of hundreds of defense spending programs.  If you include the war in Iraq as a counter terrorism measure we will spend close to a trillion dollars on counterterrorist activities over the next few years.  In the US, you have a better chance of killing  yourself  (28,332 suicides in 2000), or accidentally being poisoned (9,839 in 2000) than being killed by terrorists.  In the worst terrorism year ever, 2001, 3023 people were killed in the trade center bombings.  Last year the number was zero on American soil, as was the number zero for the years of 2000, 99, 98, 97... well you get the point.  Not that the events of 9/11 should be brushed lightly to the side, but I have come to realize two things in my life.  #1 we are going to die (surprise!) and #2 No amount of spending can stop this first fact.  The massive amounts of money thrown at this unseen threat are a product of the unwarranted fear in this nation.  I have not lost a single night of sleep worrying about being killed by a lightning strike, which kills more people per year than terrorism.  The only time I really  do  think about terrorism is when I have to do something queer because of what has happened in the past.  Yes, check my beat up Birkenstock's  twice  for bombs on my way to Amsterdam.  Pull me aside to answer "a few questions" when I get back to O'Hare because I refuse to give "voluntary" fingerprint identification for US citizens while passing through customs.  Stick five or six weird yellow sticks in my luggage on the way to Vegas that disappear basically into thin air (can I get a witness Fatty), and my fave because it happened so recently, make sure you have a black federally tagged Suburban parked across the entrance of my driveway as John Kerry's motorcade passes my house towards Dubuque.  Why did none of my neighbors get a friendly secret service visit?  It all seems a bit absurd to me I guess.  Today is the night Kim and I are going to see Fahrenheit 9/11.  I plan to be as relaxed as I can possibly be (without drugs) before we go, because if the first two times I saw the film are any indication of tonight I'll be close to a coronary from pent up rage by the end of the film.  Also as I've said in the past, although I feel some of the facts are irrelevant, you cannot deny their truth.  So in case you doubt the authenticity of certain statements check it out  urlLink here  and you can find the exact quoted source.   urlLink This  was a local story I saw on the Journal Sentinel’s page that I thought was pretty amazing and it kinda fits in here.  Lastly I got the hookup with Badger tickets this fall.  I couldn't be more excited.  The only game I'll probly miss is the Big 10 home opener against Penn State... at night.  :(   Why not elope the week before when we are at Arizona, Kim?  Oh well, priorities I guess.  And I guess I'll just leave 'er there, so as not to babble all day.  Peace out!

       Well I do, but before I get to that I just wanted anyone who thought that I cut off half of my weekend while posting yesterday, to take a closer look.  It's all there, 2 separate posts.  I'm sure nobody else missed the second post, but you can thank Temperly for making me doubt you guys a bit, as he missed it.  Oh BTW have a good time in Vegas, buddy.  What I found today was a list that showed up on the MSN start page.  The first one I read was  urlLink the top 10 schools for academics,  and this is the one that got me all worked up.  Every military school with the exception of the Marines' Citadel makes the top 10.  The fucking Coast Guard Academy?  Come on, and Harvard doesn’t even make the list.  If two job applicants come in to interview with the same qualifications except for one went to Harvard and one went to the Coast Guard Academy, then sailor boy had better realize that he is not walking away with that job.  I can see maybe one, but four of five?  Please.  I’m guessing whoever is writing these top 10 lists is either high, or is getting a little dough thrown his way by the Pentagon.  The one I did see as pretty correct is Madison as the #2 party school, night Badger football games are insane.  I’m probably lucky just to be alive after some of those nights.  Other things I noticed was Berkeley not making the most liberal colleges list.  Berkeley is the definition of liberal.  Cripes.  Oh well the lists are fun so check ‘em out.    The big list of all top 10 lists can be found  urlLink here.   Click on parties, or politics, or social to bring up other categories in their respective fields.   UW- Madison's page can be found  urlLink here.   Including prestigious #1's in both beer and hard liquor consumption.  Go Badgers!

       Ok so after the weekend blogs you may be sick of reading, but hey, don't read this now if you don't want.  You can save it till later.  Kinda like a doggie bag, or saving your piece of pie till later at Thanksgiving.  But in any event here goes.   urlLink Meet the Parents  was released in 2000 which is what I think I said, but Tammy seems to differ.  But if anyone can remember (other than you Tam) what was said please leave a message at the end of this post.  If I was wrong I accept my but kick with my dignity.  News Flash:  Kreul is still a Protestant, so is Fatty in case you were wondering.  (maybe a bit of an inside joke there)  Another thing I said I planned on blogging on recently was divorce rates.  Now before I get started I'm not trying to put a bad omen on anyone here, we have a lot of marriages coming up here, Kathy, Kim, and my Dad, and mostly because of him have I been thinking about this.  And any statistic can be looked at in either a "glass is half empty" way, or a "glass is half full" way.  If 40% of all high schoolers have tried weed at some point in time, that means 60% have not.  I look at it through the eyes of a cynic however because my life has brought me to a cynical outlook on marriage and divorce.  like the  urlLink alien poster  says though, I want to believe.  Nothing makes me happier than being proven wrong on this one.  I can't tell you how happy I was for my Grandma and Grandpa Francis on their 50th Wedding Anniversary this summer.  But with that all said the  urlLink Us Census Bureau reports  that an estimated 50% of all marriages end in divorce.  The actual number is in the 43% range however 4 states including a biggie in California do not report divorces for some reason.  Of course like with gun deaths, obesity, and all the other good things to lead the world in the US is one of the top countries as far as the divorce rate goes, but thank god we are not in the lead.  We still trail Russia, Sweden, Finland, and Britain.  65% Russia?  My fucking god, what the hell is the matter over there?  And 64% in Sweden?  Why even bother.  More disturbing to me perhaps as someone who  isn't  getting married this summer is that 1 in 20 people never get married.  Those odds scare me... a bit.  But confuse me a bit too, because 10% of people are supposedly gay and therefore can't get married, so why only 5% don't get married.  That isn't even figuring in priests and the extremely ugly.  The couple of stats I really did want to find, which was the median length of all marriages that end in divorce, and are children of divorced parents more likely to divorce than those from normal marriages, eluded me though.  I kind of wanted to know what the "hump" year is on the bell curve, so if I get married I can say, "It's all downhill from here."  And kind of know If I was statistically fucked from the jump, coming from a family with divorced parents.  I'm not really concerned about any of my friends, because there are plenty of 72 hour Brittany Spears style marriages out there to even out the stats, but as Adam Sandler said in Big Daddy "Think about it, you know."  Don't break up or get divorced over something stupid.  All the couples out there are like "Thank you Captian Obvious" but it happens more than you think.  That took longer than I expected, So I'll be quick on these last couple.    They're both DVD stories.  First off October 5th is the day.   urlLink Fahrenheit 9/11 on DVD.   Just as everyone expected just a bit before the elections.  I'm excited to see the second disc as I'm a big DVD geek, and I just recently got to see the second disc from Bowling For Columbine, and it was one of the best second discs I've ever seen.  Also if you haven't seen or bought the Chappelle's Show: Season 1 DVDs, what are you waiting for.  I almost wet my pants on several occasions the first time I saw them.  That's right literally almost actually pissing, my stomach muscles were sore from laughing.  And the just signed my man Dave (been on my top 5 comics list for almost 10 years straight now) up for  urlLink two more years of the show for a ridiculous sum of money.   I'm rich Beyaaach!  Oh P.S. and BTW  urlLink "Code Oranges"  can bite my bag.  "Big N" please!

       Yeah Don't start here, go down to the first post like this and start from the beginning.    So anyway Saturday brought together some of the greatest golfers of all time right here to the midwest.  I'm not talking about the Buick Open in Michigan, I'm talking about a star studded best shot team comprised of Myself, Candy Jo, Eric Heim, And Casey Droeszler.  God damn!  How could we lose?  Well I'm not sure how, but we did, posting a meet worst score of eight over par.... in a best shot.... a four person best shot.  Some highlights of the day included Candy outdriving Beege on the par 3 160-yard "beat the pro" hole, Me nearly getting pegged on the first hole by an errant golf ball, Heim and Casey polishing off about a 30 pack of beers during the round, and probably the best drive of my life on hole number 9.  It was our last hole to play and since Casey and Heim had basically just been swinging for the fences all day I decided to "let it eat" even if I would probably shank it into the pond.  But somehow the ball took just a nice straight flight path and faded over the bunkers.  I defy anyone that day using my hoopty driver to hit a better shot.  Which brings me to my next point, a lot of the shots we were playing were mine.  Which is a bad thing.  Normally when I play a best shot like one putt and 3 of my short iron shots count... if I'm playing well.  So when we were using my shots, I knew it was not going to be a good day scorewise.  But we had fun I think, and after paying a $21 bar tab at The Annex (if you knew how crazy that figure was compared to reality, you'd fall off your chair) and FT ranting about "owning Platteville" I'd say it was a pretty good day.  I was in pretty bad shape by the end of the night, and really didn't notice that according to everyone else there was a "Shiite load" of extra cops out that night.  But I did get to see a lovely chase/beatdown on Mineral St.  Attention criminals of the world:  Do some fucking windsprints, or some cardio or something.  Homeboy looked like Forrest Gump running down the street.  Only he couldn't "run like the wind blows."  Anyway Sunday, Ryan and I went to Buncome and did some fishing, with great success, by my opinion.  "The Fenwick" finally struck paydirt and reeled in an 8" smallmouth as it's first catch, so the new rod and reel definately works.  we caught about 25 total and I had 11 so it was almost equal which is amazing for both me, and us.  Because usually I don't catch fish on fake bait, and  usually when Ryan and I do any kind of sporting event (fishing, hunting, etc.)  We strike out bigtime.  So it was nice that we bouth caught a fish that would have been about 14 inches had we measured them.  I held my fish next to my junk and it was about the same size so I figured it was 14 inches.  Ha!  So that was the weekend, good times, now I can cover the news and I'll be done.

       Apparently Fatty is alive and well and posting at a pace of one blogpost a month. :) But in all seriousness, nice to see you back. I wish I could explain the Hawking/black hole thingy a bit more clearly for everyone, but I don't intend to do that until I have a better grasp on it myself. I need to find one of those "Quantum Physics for Dummies" books. Oh BTW way to read ahead there Joshie, like I wouldn't post big Hawking news. Sheeeeeit!  So I guess I'll start with the weekend, the things that happen all seem to tie together to make an interesting blog, but I guess I'll start on Thursday night. Temp calls me at home to ask me if I wanted to play in the best shot golf outing to support the Pioneer men's basketball team, that I had committed to earlier. I said yes and he told me to go talk to FT and see what the skinny was. So I walks out the basement door of our house and hear some kind of unruly commotion going on across the street. I walk over to the Temperly's and see that a hot tub party is already in progress. Oh this is like 1:30 in the morning BTW. I planned on going over, getting the info, maybe having a drink, and then heading home, because I know the Temperly hot tub parties usually are. 15 basketball players, 2 or 3 girls that are dating the players and enough snacks to stuff a buffalo. More sausage both literally and figuratively than a Saturday Night Live "Da Bears" skit. But when I get to the deck it looks like a fucking P. Diddy video. More scattered ass than I could count, and for once it wasn't Brooke's high school homies. So I'm like you know what "I'll hang for a little." (  You know I think I'll leave it there for a sec and come back to this post.  The tip of my one finger hurts.  Ta Ta til then.

       Well, here it is, my second post...gives you warm fuzzy feelings similar to the ones you got during those "special" moments with your uncle, doesn't it? Neway, I find it hard to believe that Jeff hasn't wrote about  urlLink this  yet, but since he hasn't I will. Now, I know a majority of those of you reading this aren't even remotely interested in Stephen Hawking or what he has to say...er...type but this is some pretty amazing shit. MC Hawking has basically came out and said that black holes aren't the portals to the end of existence that they have been thought to be for so long. Now, this may take some of the intriguing factors away from black holes, but they're still cool as hell and this is some major geek news (which means it fits in well considering who's eyes this world is being viewed from on this blog). Enough geekness for now though.  As some of you prolly already know, the first collaborative effort ever on a Summer CD has been completed and is ready for the grabbing. Both Jeff(J. Diddy) and myself (FlipFlop LumberJack) are excited about our creation and are eager to hand it out. There was a problem with indecision about CD art but we figured individual art for each cd would be a nice touch. I recommend that you listen to it front to back, but that's my opinion and it will be seen how many of you do so.  Well, that will about do it for my second/first August post. Feel free to drop me a line if ya want a cd and keep an eye open for the new LCD tour shirts...hopefully coming soon. You're going down sucka, peace out!
