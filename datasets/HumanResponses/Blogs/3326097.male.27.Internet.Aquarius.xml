      So that wonderful business idea that I posted yesterday will apparently be obsoleted not too long from now:   urlLink http://www.case.edu/news/2004/4-04/keg.htm   It won't take too long for someone to realize that this technology can be applied to carboys as well as kegs.

      The clock moves too slow sometimes.  So I've got this idea for a business that I've discussed with a small number of people, but haven't really put down on paper. I don't think I will pursue this idea, but just for the sake of keeping track of such little things, I'll describe it here.  I home brew beer, but I have one major problem: temperature control. Because I live in a small apartment, I don't really have room for an extra fridge or freezer to ferment my beer in. I have difficulty imagining that I am the only home brewer in Los Angeles with this problem. This problem, and a possible solution, forms the base of the business. The basic idea is this: create a storage facility specifically for holding small batches of fermenting beer in a temperature controlled environment.  The facility would consist largely of two cold rooms, one kept at a fairly standard aleing temperature, the other at a fairly standard lagering temperature. Say, for instance, 68 degrees F and 45 degrees F, respectively. The cold rooms would be equipped with caged shelves large enough to hold a 6 gallon glass carboy, or perhaps a little larger to hold conical fermenters. The spaces would be available to rent on a two tiered pricing schedule: for casual brewers, the rentals are  week-to-week, whereas more aggressive brewers will receive a discount for longer term rentals. A small number of individual cooling units (I.E., refrigerators) will also be available for more precise temperature control at a higher price. These will only be available on a week-to-week basis.  Several other services will also be available:   An area will be provided for racking beer between containers, as well as for cleaning and sanitizing equipment.  A bottling area, including multiple bench-style bottle cappers and facilities to clean and sanitize bottles and bottle caps.  A brewing area that may be rented at an hourly rate. A mini-lounge with a TV and couch will be provided to entertain brewers during low activity portions of the brewing process.  Brewing classes will be offered. Equipment, bottles, bottle caps and storage space rental will be included in the price of the class. Groups can include up to five people, and groups pay a flat rate regardless of size.  Depending on local food and liquor laws, monthly events may be organized for brewers to meet and share their beers.   Several other ideas go along with this, but that's basically it. I probably am leaving something out, but it's time for me to go home, so that's all for now.

      So I've had various Weezer songs running through my head more or less constantly for the last few days. Not really sure why, since I hadn't really heard them in a while, but you know, that's just what happens I guess. In particular, I've been hearing:      Good Life     Falling For You     El Scorcho    It could be worse, I guess. It could be the Bananaphone song.

      Okay, I'm finally getting into this whole blogging thing. I have a  feeling I'm going to regret it, but oh well.
