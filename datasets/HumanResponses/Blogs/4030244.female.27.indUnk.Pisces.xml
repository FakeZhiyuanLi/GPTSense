      I'm re-doing my about me bit, it's too long. It may be crap but it took me a while to write so I'm posting it for posterity  I'm a girl who's old enough to be calling herself a woman now, not a girl, and takes offence if referred to as a girl by most other people. I'm an optimist and romantic, with those ideals dying slowly and painfully each day that I spend in the real world (I try to avoid that though) I'm a feminist, and love to be feminine, without that being taken to mean I'm in some way a lesser person than one who has their genitals hanging about on the outside. I love to be treated like a lady by a man who is a gentleman, but does not see weakness in my gender. I hate to be hated and reviled by other women because I love to be sensual and approach physical pleasure in a way that would be perfectly and widely acceptable were I a man. I hate the double standards that exist in this world. I hate lies, but hate people who parade insensitvity and malice under a flag of openness and honesty. Those who feel that any mean words can be excused if followed by "I'm just being honest...". I may seem self absorbed at times, but believe that thinking of others costs nothing and will be paid back through a kind of karma. And I have an exception skill for navel gazing and writing flowery crap!

      Here's a list of things which are insulting and apparently not insulting.  I've learned them in the last year or so, I really had no idea!     It is insulting to point out that someone who is older than you, is older than you.  It isn't insulting to disregard a 27 year old as being dumb and ignorant, simply because you are OLD.  It is insulting to ask a supposed friend how their current relationship is going.  It isn't insulting to tell someone that they'll never get over you, move on in life or find someone who will want them and love them, the way you used to but don't any more.  It is insulting to comment with genuine concern that someone is loosing weight, when you worry that it may mean they're ill.  It's ok to comment on how fat someone is, and constantly refer to them as fatty and fatass.  It's wrong to jokingly point out a (one amongst many) new grey hair.  It's just fine to tell someone their skin looks like shit, not jokingly, and&nbsp;in a "not sure I want to be seen with you" way,&nbsp;even though you are well aware that they have their period due in a day's time.   and most of all   It's perfectly OK to lie about every aspect of your life to someone, just to make sure you can carry on screwing them, and still insist you care about them when discovered, and maintain that no wrong was done by you doing this.  Under no circumstances should you react, on discovering the above, in a manner that is angry or emotional, nor should you blame said liar, as it was done with your own interests at heart really, considering being used as a cheap fuck in a hotel room by someone who you have trusted implicitly is probably all that keeps you going, silly girly!

       "hi, I miss our arguments !!!! Seriously, I miss talking with you x"     &nbsp;  This was yesterday! His response to me not answeing emails. He's also used a different mail address, so someone's told him that I've redirected all mail from his usual one to my spam folder.   Talking about what, is what I want to know!   Way back when, before the whole relationship debacle, we did talk. We'd sit over a drink and chat about all sorts, music, movies, the state of the world, all the usual stuff. We'd talk about our relationships, our respective love lives. We were really close mates so this was not unusual.   Maybe it's the storyteller in him, he needs create a total fiction and I'm the only one he feels comfortable enough to share it with.  Maybe he's just a full of shit control freak.  Hmmmm....   For the past 6 months, the only times he's talked to me about his love life or relationship, it's been a total fabrication. The only other totpic of conversation has been him arranging when we could possibly meet up, and that was only for sex. I'd agree, wanting to sit and talk with my friend. W'e meet in a hotel, have sex, then he'd put on the TV and each time I opened my mouth he'd shush me.  Any films or music I liked were laughed at and scorned as dumb and unworthy of his conversation. He didn't want to talk about music or films, just sex, or even forgo conversation altogether and just have sex.  Our relationship, it's past and possible (according to him) future, were completely taboo topics. If I talked about them, I was being a "bunny boiler"&nbsp;or was trying to make him feel bad for dumping me, apparently.  If my love life came up, I got a barrage of questions. I have no love life these&nbsp;days. Before I found out the extent of his lies, and was still being told constantly by him that we'd get back together, I only slept with him and I didn't date. I didn't want to anger him.&nbsp; Now that I have found out (apart from being to broke to go anywhere anyway!) I feel sick just thinking about sex, and my opinion of men is not exactly&nbsp;at it's highest point. I knocked down a lot of hard-built walls to let him in, I'm not doing that again for anyone.  If I was feeling bold, and said that I was making an effort to find someone new, he'd laugh out loud at me, saying "Yeah, right..." And "why fight the inevitable, we are meant to end up together".   Since I stopped sleeping with him, he had pretty much nothing to say to me. All his MSN chats were to get me to talk dirty with him, to get me to sleep with him again,&nbsp;or to try and to pry into my personal life. If I refused to answer, or was evasive because it really was none of his business, all I got was a tantrum and a torrent of bitchy abuse, aimed at insecurities I'd confided in him about as a friend.  I would have been well at ease talking about my (admittedly none-existent) private life, but that he refused to talk about his. I wasn't trying to snipe or be mean. I just wanted to know what was going on with him. I was by this point resigned to never getting him back, as he&nbsp;wouldn't let me know where I stood. I wanted to just chat. But he would barely say a word, or would just command "don't even go there!". I have, of course since found out that the few things he did tell me were complete lies anyway.   I have no idea what he thinks he misses talking about.  Maybe he misses the feeling he got, whatever that may have been, when his&nbsp;asking me how I was ended with me crying because&nbsp;I felt like shit. Like all I was good for was being used by him, being his dirty secret, his cheap thrill of doing something he shouldn't.   &nbsp;

      Not long after we split, he found someone new. There may have been an overlap, I suspect he was seeing her when he was still with me, I've no way of knowing. The first big lie came. What he had told me was nothing very serious, was actually them living together. I freaked and he simply told me he hadn't wanted to hurt me.&nbsp;  We were still having sex. I told him I didn't want to be his dirty secret, that we couldn't have sex anymore. He stormed and sulked and said this meant we couldn't be friends anymore.  After a time he started to come to me saying how she wasn't what he wanted. They didn't have a future and didn't sleep together any longer, he was now just a lodger. From time to time we'd spend a night in a hotel together.  I wasn't dumb enough to belive they didn't have any sort of relationship at all, but I did believe him when he said there was a chance that we could work it out, that I was the one he wanted in the long run.  If I asked about her, or their relationship, he would loose his temper, saying not to ask. If I wasn't updating him on all aspects of my life, he would say that I was jepordising my chances of winning him back. I still loved him, and had always been able to take him at his word, so I told him where I was going, when and who with.  I went on a trip, alone to the States, fulfilling a long held dream. He tried to stop me from going, using emotional blackmail. Just before I left, he told me to trust him and have faith that he'd got wheels in motion for us to be together again. Through out my trip, even though it was difficult, expensive and I often got a sulky or rude response to what was perceved as "late" contact, I stayed in touch. I held back from things,&nbsp; turned down dates and kisses, thinking that he was really going to fix things for when I got back.   I really am dumb   Within the first week I was back, He'd told me he was going to make a go of things with his new woman.  Within a few weeks of that, he was back on the fone saying there was no hope for them and that, yes, I was the only one for him.   I still really wanted this to be true, I still believed that he wouldn't tell me a lie that huge. He knew all my insecurities, all my hangups about being decieved, about being used, and he was my friend, who I could, at the heart of things, still really trust.

      We were friends for years. I knew him and all his flaws, he knew mine. I was young single and very very fre, and he was in a relationship with someone i knew, which was stormy and destructive. We were soul mates, the first person each turned to when we needed to be understood. We didn't judge each other.  When we first met, we slept together, it was just a one night stand, both of us insensibly drunk and high, trying to be kinky and ending up giggling at sillyness. He wanted to wrap my breasts in clingfilm, but the stuff he had at his place was the sort thats pre-perforated to tear easily. I was sick on his t-shirt, he though it was funny. I'm not sure how, but with time we grew to be mates. We'd still have sex when he was thrown out of the shared flat.  He was always there for me. Trough all the shittyness that comes with being a single girl trying to date. If it was needed he'd give me a shake and tel me to get a grip, and I'd do the same for him. He was always "no good", being in a band, he's go on tour, doing large metal festivals in mainland europe, and along with that doing drugs and groupies. I knew he was faithless, but he was always honest with me. When she finally got sick of him, and found someone else, it tore him to bits. I loved him as I do all my dear friends, and tried to pick up those bits and put them back together. I slept with him many times, but without sex. I held him when he cried over her. We spent more and more time together. People in our social circle assuming we were a couple long before we actually were. He told me that he loved me, and broke down the walls I'd built over many years, and I told him i loved him too.&nbsp;I was unsure of a relationship, I knew him. I told him, I could live with infidelity, I was aware that it came&nbsp;with the package. I told him the worst thing he could do to me was lie to me. Anything else I'd scream and shout about, but would get over with time, maybe even end our relationship, but we'd still be friends. But I cannot stand lies, I cannot stand the thought that I'm being laughed at behind my back for being a gullable fool. Anything else was forgiveable, that was not.  After some time, our relationship did end. He ended it. He's given many excuses since then as to why, I'm not even sure that he knows why.  I was upset, I did scream and shout, but it was something I could get over.  Then came all the lies, and I hate him now. The only thing I ever asked for, he couldn't do. A person I trusted with all my heart, betrayed me. I'm sure it will pass but right now I'm angry and I am bitter.

      I'm starting this blog simply as a place to vent, enthuse, whine and ramble, which is probably the reason most people do.  My head just feels crammed full of stuff that needs getting out. Not anything creative or witty enough to share really, and mostly stuff I don't want to bore my mates with, things they've heard a thousand times before.  Mostly, for at least a little while, my posts are going to be about my strong and overwhelming dislike of one person, who shall remain nameless. An out pouring of all the things that he won't listen to, all the ways he's upset and hurt me, bile and bitterness that I need to spit but I don't want him to know he can still provoke.  I'm not a teenager, this won't be all " oh poor me " stuff. I just need to let it all out,&nbsp; I'm hoping this will be a cathartic experience. And once I'm done with the lemon squeezing, I'll just stick all the stuff down that I used to put in my paper journal.  I hid that when he came into my life, thinking that I now had a person I could express all that stuff to, that I didn't need it anymore. Now I can't find it, so I have this instead.

      Spell checked that last post. Mondaygirl has only one suggested alternative,  nondescript.   That was the name given to the fake Victorian chimeras, two dead, stuffed animals, stitched together to make a "mythical beast" for a circus or sideshow. A monkey and a big fish, supposedly a mermaid, going bald so you can see the seams. That's a nondescript.

      I have to go to the bank this weekend to beg. I'm as broke as broke. I even owe my gran money! Broke as I am, I do have a roof over my head, even if I despise the people I'm under it with. My bank are going to piss off, but I'm going to ask them for help getting out of here.  "yeeees mondaygirl, I see you have no savings, huge debts and not a very large income. Of course you can have help with a mortgage! We'll just take your soul...  *checks screen of computer* **mutters** oh MONDAYGIRL, hmmmmm,   better make that your kidneys, all things considered, as a security."   I can't stay in this house though. I'm already nut's, I just don't want to push it further. It's not even like I can go out, I have no money to go anywhere. On a warm day like today it's a killer not to be able to just slip into the pub after work.  Not wishing to dwell, but I'm not even sure I could go to the pub had I the money. Not my old regular anyway. There are people with whom I'd had heated arguments with when they told me that I should stop being dumb, tried to tell me about what  he  was up to, then he's got wind of it, had a word and they've phoned and apologised, they were mistaken, in unconvincing leaden tones. All I can wonder is what has he said to them to make them make that call? Am I now pitied, has he told them the "for her own good" crap that he tells himself and tries to tell me? Or has he portayed me as the one who won't let it go and insists on making the first contact each time? And my worries about what will happen when I first bump into him with her aren't about how I'll cope seeing them as a couple, or him with someone else, they're about what the hell has he said to her about me? Obviously not "oh, that's my ex who I've been shagging behind your back and slagging you down to". What though? Am I about to get my throat ripped out or be laughed at? I think I'd prefer the first option. And will I be able to resist the temptation to tell her, to hang onto my dignity and not tell her everything she really does deserve to know about the lying scum that's leaching off her. I'm bound to be drunk, but I'm also bound to be with friends who're used to wrangling a drunken, difficult Mondaygirl.  Blah. None of that makes me any better off financially. Money can't make you happy for sure, but it takes the edge off being miserable. Can't remember who it was, but I read a quote;  "life is like a shit sandwich, the more bread you have, the less shit it seems you have to eat."

      thinking on it, or brooding as it's sometimes known, the privacy of the shitty space that is my room  has  been invaded. I let him come here (for sex, what else), he has been in my room, in my space.  Git.  I am erasing him from my life though. there's no trace of him on my computer or fone. No old messages, sent or recieved, no addresses, no numbers. Nothing.  At the weekend I'm burning all pictures from the one holiday we took together, off loading some gifts I still have and never wanted to charity shops, and then that's it (I am keeping some of the few good things tho! I love my polariod cam, my Elvis dvd's and some other bits and bobs, despite the fact that they came from him!). Nothing of him in my life but bad memories that are already fading.

      Hmmmm. Put that in my first post. Has fallen a bit by the wayside really hasn't it.  I'm not a teenager any more (thank god!) but I am clinically depressed. No childhood trauma, no abuse or anything, just the wrong chemical balance in my body. Like being a diabetic, but I can eat cake and I can bum you out more in a conversation.  I have big highs and big lows. I have antidepressants that I hate to take, and don't, unless I'm crying all the time instead of some of the time. I'm not really a fatalistic, but I was put together this way, a bit wrong in places but that's just me, who I am.  **melodramatic violins** I my view, my condition as being in a way, a terminal illness. It is the thing that will kill me in the end. (**make that cellos, more mournful**) Unless you've been there, you don't get it. And even some people who have still don't get it. Suicide (dum dum daaaaaaa!!) is not caused by one shitty event. You can walk around feeling like that all the time, like "why the hell do I bother?!?", doing all the hard work that amounts to nothing but more hard work, and you just carry on. There are good bits, and people who's feelings you care about. It can make friends and relatives who are left behind feel abandoned and rejected, like they failed you somehow, failed to fix the world for you. Not being conceited about how important I am in their lives, I just know how I'd feel if one of them took the "big step".  All that the one shitty event does is just make the part of you that really couldn't care less about other people, and what their reaction might be, turn around and go,   "What now!? MORE crap?! Crappier crap!? Hey, you won't even be here for all that "boohoo" rubbish, look out for number 1 for a change, look after your own needs! We don't have to stand for this, it's getting us nowhere, carpe deum, sooner's better than later, old age looks like it sucks ass! They'll respect your decision, they know it's crap too. If they really love you, they'll know this is he only way you can stop feeling this bad! There's only more of the same on the way you know"

      I feel totally shit. I can't sleep at all an I've hit a total low. If I tke my tablets I can't work properly at my job, which I need to pay back my debts incurred on stupid things. I'm stuck in this shitty house with 2 people I can't stand, with no money to get away from them. Neither short term by going out and letting my hair down, nor long term by getting out of this house. I'm paying off a huge loan for a dumdass holiday for the next 7 years. A holiday I didn't even make the most of because I believed the word of a liar, and held back, not wishing to ruin something that it turns out didn't even exist.  I have no space, no privacy and no peace and quiet.  The one person that I could always turn to when I felt this low has betrayed my trust so much that I couldn't turn to them even if I could stand them right now.  All I have is my one shitty room, and a bunch of junk in it. I can't even guarentee that I have that. I can't tell if my privacy is invaded to the extent that my room isn't even truely mine anymore.  He was completely right, all the things I like are useless crap. I am not a person people want around and I am stupid.
