      Message:  Dear friend,  Did you know ???       Did you know that when you envy someone, it's because you really like that person?   Did you know that those who appear to be very strong in heart, are real weaklings and most succeptible?  Did you know that those who spend their time protecting others are the ones that really need some one to protect them?  Did you know that the three most difficult things to say are : I love you,Sorry and help me The people who say these are those that actually need them or really feel them, and they are the ones you really need to treasure, because they have said them.   Did you know that people who occupy themselves by keeping others company or helping others are the ones that actually need your company and help?   Did you know that those who dress in red are more confident in themselves?  Did you know that those who dress in yellow are those that enjoy thier beauty?  Did you know that those who dress in black, are those who want to be unnoticed and need your help and understanding?  Did you know that when you help someone, the help is returned in two folds?  Did you know that those who need more of you are those that did not mention it to you?    Did you know that it's easier to say what you feel in writting than saying it to someone in the face?But did you know that it has more value when you say it in the face?  Did you know that what is most difficult for you to say or do is much more valuable than anything that is valuable that you can buy with money?  Did you know that if y ou ask for something in faith, your wishes are granted?  Did you know that you can make your dreams come true, like falling in love, becoming rich, staying healthy, if you ask for it by faith, and if you really knew, you'd be surprised by what you could do.    But don't believe everything I tell you, until you try it for yourself , if you know someone that is in need of something that I mentioned of,and you know that you can help,you'll see that it will be returned in two folds.  DID YOU KNOW THAT YOU COULD ALWAYS COUNT ON ME???... AT THE MOMENT, TIME AND PLACE THAT YOU NEED ME, CALL ME, I WILL BE THERE WITH YOU !!!!!   "One day, we mad people will change the world...or we are already changing it " THE BALL IS NOW IN YOUR COURT... If the world were to end in 24 hours,all the phone lines, chat rooms and email will be saturated from people sending messages to others, saying: "I regret having made you feel bad", "Pardon me", "I love you", "I hold you in high esteem", take good care of yourself" and sometimes "I have always loved you, only I never told you".    Today, the ball of FRIENDSHIP is in your court, send this to those who trully are your friends (including me if I am one). Also, do not feel bad if no one send this back to you in the end, you'll find out that you'll get to keep the ball for other people want more..

      More to know me !?!?!? Pertama gw nangis di hari sabtu pahing, kalo ga salah kata nyokap gw malem deh, pada tanggal 13, sekitar 24 tahun lalu... tk gw di mustika rawamangun depan persahabatan, terus sd gw di SD Trisula III rawamangun. Pas SMP gw pindah ke bogor demi menghindari tawuran antar pelajar ;p, SMA gw ma uk SMU BINA INSANI bogor dan allhamdulillah ga pernah tinggal kelas, paling cuma surat peringatan aja ;p. Kuliah gw di UNMER malang sekitar tahun 1998, di FE jur akutansi, semester pertama ip gw lumayan bagus sekitar 1,3 soalnya di semester 2 ip gw ga keluar. Setelah semester 2 gw pindah kuliah ke STIKI malang, di situ gw ambil TI. Ga taunya cuma bertahan sampe semester 1 doang kalo ga salah ip gw 1,6. Te us semester 2 gw ga pernah kuliah lagi, ini di akibatkan bertemunta dengan anak2 mbetick... sangking solid dan asiknya ini mbetick, ngebuat males kuliah. Truz sekitar thn 2000 gw pindah kuliah lagi ke UNMER tapi kali ini ngambil jurusan manejemen... Masuk terus cuma setengah semester, sempet mo ke semester 2nya telat ngurus krs. Tapi di malang gw pernah juga bikin team yg mengkhususkan ke HONDA NSR, dan jadilah Noceng, NSR OWNER'S CLUB MALANG. Yg di rilis dari 2 org yaitu gwa dan Aswin, trus thn 2001 gw pindah lagi ke jkt buat kuliah lagi di Universitas Jayabaya, ngambil Fakultas FISIP HI, sampe sekarang.  Nama panggilan gw selama ini yg pernah di berikan org : - budi prasetyo = from mom n dad - iyas, ipras = panggilan kecil - Swampthing = SMP - bigger = SMA - Jo = unmer - Jo Kodok = anak2 Mbetick - ukhies = anak2 Noceng - ucis asem manis bau amis = Tonggo
