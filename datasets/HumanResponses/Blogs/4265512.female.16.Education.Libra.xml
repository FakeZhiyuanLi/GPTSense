      mr dew, thanks for ur comment. tho i dunno who u r. well i think 3d stuffs are cool, but it's just tt the 3d max prog is not a very gd one. mine really gave me lotsa probs too.it slows down my whole system, corrupts my files,well,in simple terms,it's really lousy and troublesome...sighs..  on sunday i was supposed to be the backup singer,but i overslept. not my fault,but my alarm clock went faulty.dad called me at 10am..when i woke up,i realised tt my alarm clock was not even 8am,and the alarm button was still on. needles weren't moving at all...i dunno wat's happening to my alarm clock,it doesn't seem like the batt went flat,becoz until now..the needles are still ticking.it is only when i set the alarm,then the needles will stop moving..well,i guess it's time for it to go..it has served me faithfully for a couple of years..  then i went church n came back ard 4 plus. started doing morg proj at 5pm. spent 5hrs on it!    after i did morg,i did OC ppt slides.did for pretty long,then i burned jay's cd for mel.first time i spent 12 solid hrs on the com! from 5pm right up to 5am!

      mrs ler sent me a christian article. funnily it's titled "the alternative lifestyle". talking abt having affairs..and a little bit on homosexuality. mm..wondering how come she's sending me this article. maybe just sharing ba.  "While having more than one partner can also result in disease-some ofwhich are life threatening, homosexuality is an unnatural function that leads to a depraved mind."  "  The world's view may be to accept "alternative lifestyles," but God's Word simply calls it sin.   You'll never be as close to God as you could be while living in sin. Yet, if you stay close to God, you won't desire to live in sin. Obedience to God's plan for marriage will enable you to discover the beauty of your sexuality; given and received the way God intended."  these two quotes are taken from the article.well, the 2nd one really struck me,for tt's wat i learnt thru "it". that time i realise tt the world really viewed "it" as acceptable..but it's not for christians lor..we all know wat it is considered in God's eyes. moreover,i really couldn't be close to Him when i was in "it"..n now tt i'm close to Him, i dun desire to live in "it".  tt's why i say the 2nd one really struck me.tt's exactly wat i'm experiencing all these while..very cool...=)

      hi ppl.  din mentioned tt on sunday the preacher actually mentioned a verse in the Bible which is sth sth.."this is love,love at it's highest,that He sent His Son to die as an atoning sacrifice for our sins".this is the verse which the song "Love At It's Highest" is taken from.written by my church fren.i chose this song for my worship on that day too.See how God works again?I din even noe tt the preacher was going to mention this verse!n when he said tt,i was like looking at my musicians n smiling..hahaha..  well,on tuesday i felt a lil funny when i saw her.it's natural la actually,but the good thing is tt i managed to control it!n i went for CCC.was sitting beside zhen yang.kept crying n crying while they sang songs,prayed,watched the korean cartoon.i was so super touched by God's love.  the cartoon is abt this lil boy being entrusted to take care of the cross.n after entrusting,Jesus 'left' him.he promised nv to abandon the cross no matter wat.over time,obstacles caused him to be unable to bear the weight of tt cross..so he fell down onto the floor.but when he regain his composure again,he crawled towards the cross..n tried to lift it up again.he cried.finally Jesus came back..n the boy ran to Him n Jesus gave him a hug..saying,"u've suffered too much,now come and live with Me forever.."sth lydat.  when i was watching the clip,i cried.i saw tt clip before alrdy,but still i cried..becoz i felt tt i was like the small boy,trying so hard to hold on to tt cross tt Jesus had entrusted to me.yet time and again i fell..n tried to crawl back n lift it up..n i was crying becoz i was wondering when will Jesus come back to gimme a hug n ask me to stay with Him forever.i cried so hard..i noe He is always here,but i was wondering how good it will be to haf Him physically hugging me..hahaha..  n it was like everything in CCC really spoke to me..mm..God is really teaching me la.=) n oso in the "Daily Bread"..  today everything is really ok.really.no longer struggling in fact.felt kinda free n happy!well,really praise God!!   Hallelujah!!Jesus is alive!!
