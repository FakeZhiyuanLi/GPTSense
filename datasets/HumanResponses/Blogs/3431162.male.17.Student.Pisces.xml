      i don't get it why old people are constantly going through end-life crisises and trying to make themselves appear to be younger than they actualy are...when i'm old, there's no doubt that i'm going to dress, eat, and act like a geriactric (sp?)...so anyhoo i have about 2 min. left in my junior year of highschool. wahoo and w00t :) well then time to go..i'm going to play baldur's gate at my friends home...or maybe i won't go..he lives 20 min. away and gas is up to $2 a gallon now...oof...well i should leave n0w...biiiiiii......

      huy!...i ALMOST just had something to do. then the czar (dad) interfered. so i guess i'll just go make something emo..a song or blender or something to that affect. so riddle of the day/week/month/whatever:       If he had seen the sawdust he wouldn't have died.  I doubt anyone will actually even try to figure it out. it's a good one tho. It took me a while to figure it out. Yes or no questions only. Hum...I need to get a new MPEG4 camcorder..if anyone has any advice. Ok then bi.

      wow...i'm long overdue for a post. and not one of the picture post thingies at that. i figured i have far too much to say to fit it into one of those. soo...first off, my apologies for being such a hermit lately. i've been out of town and whatnot, so i've had to rely on audio posts. but i have returned...have no fear.  so first. i'm at jeremy's house. it's 20 past noon. we just woke up. this morning at about 3:15 we decided we were hungry and promptly drove to waffle house to eat hashbrowns. we were the only ones there...besides the serial-murderer cook who i seriously thought was going to chop us up as well as the food. we're playing final fantasy 7 as of now..and about to eat again.  i'm supposed to be going to my friends to swim with a bunch of us in about 30 min...but i'm way too tired and too hungry to be in a pool at this early hour..i mean do people actualy expect me to be out of the house before 1 PM?? gah people these days.  wahoo..food's ready. it's been fun talking again. until then. bye.
