      Finally got my tennis rackets shipped here from my dads place up in Washington; can't believe I forgot them.&nbsp; So the plan is to start playing tennis on the weekends with my mom, it'll be good for both of us in different regards.&nbsp; It'll be the first stepping stone for me towards building my OWN life outside of work and not gearing it toward meeting women.&nbsp; It'll also be nice for my mom because she has been doing the Atkins diet but definitely needs exercise to help her lose some weight, as her diet is in tact already. &nbsp; Another set of plans my mom and I are working on is taking a glass blowing class together.&nbsp; Our backup ideas are sculpting or ceramics if the glass blowing turns out to be too expensive or difficult to plan around.&nbsp; We both badly want to do glass blowing though, so I have a feeling that'll be the one!

      It's nice when the days balance out.  Today was 'almost' an absolute nightmare at work.  Had a leak on a hydraulic system I installed and about a gallon worth of fluid spattered everywhere.  Thankfully I was able to fix the leak rather fast.    Had a hair cut by my cool hairdresser who's been working with me to get my 'look' i'm shooting for.  Kind of fun to treat hair like a project (if you're growing it out that is).  After that I had a ton of sushi with my mom and her fiance (Andre) at this local place here in Tigard i've been to a couple times before (forgot the name).  I don't understand how some people can't stand sushi, it's so damn good!  I haven't had any time to find any cool news articles to mention this time around, as I just got home and it's practically time to begin my vegetative state.    *in a sports announcer voice* Until next time...

      Go figure, the moment I decide i've had enough with the online dating scene (way easier to just get a date in real life after you get through all the crap online...i.e. - months of chatting, dishonesty, flakiness), I start getting a bunch of emails.  So far i'm not too thrilled, they're either way too far away, built like a football player, or mentally unstable.  Whatever happened to the "Pride & Prejudice" days?  Ok maybe that's taking it a bit too far, but c'mon!  Where are all of the QUALITY women?  I don't want kids or marriage, but one night stands?  Aren't guys suppose to want that, not women?  Will someone explain to me what is happening to our planet?

      Finally this day has come to an end.  Didn't get off until 6:30, and my god was it a tiring day.  Finished up the electrical system on one truck, followed by mounting 2 hydraulic systems on 2 other trucks.  Exhausting day to say the least!  On a more brighter note, I came across an article that just reaks of irony.  A cleaning lady (68 years old mind you) just won the second largest jackpot to ever go to a single person in North America, say it with me: "$294,000,000".  Absolutely nuts!  I think my grandma deserves to win, she's been playing for a good 20+ years...go figure.

      I just came across this news article on CNN.  I am usually a huge advocate for all technological advances, but this is just wrong.   urlLink Article   To paraphrase:  Some guy has filed a patent for video-equipped touchscreen talking tombstones.  Imagine walking through a cemetary where you can literally see each person on a video display talking?  That would be way too freaky for me.

      SSX Tricky is such a fun game, i've somehow managed to drain away most of my evening racing down the snow-covered hills.  Go xbox!  Nothing will ever replace the original nintendo though :)  Im sitting here watching 'Sex and the City'.  What a bunch of neurotic women, the scary thing is this show is so damn accurate it's crazy.  Above and beyond all of the women on that show, i'd probably prefer the red-head (Miranda?).  She's got brains and can look good when she wants to, but seems to be more practical than the rest of them...  Well it's been another fun-filled evening of video games, tv shows, and stouffers mac & cheese.

      Well since this is my first post, i'll introduce myself for those of you who don't know me.  My name is Chris, i'm 23 years old, single, and a college graduate from USC with a B.S. in Computer Science.  I'm currently living alone in my own apartment here in Tigard, Oregon.  Moved here on 05/15/04 from Washington where I lived for a year, so i'm still relatively new to the area.  I work at a place in Sherwood that builds custom carrier and wrecker tow trucks.  I predominantly do all of the electrical work, but also do quite a bit of mechanical work.  I've slowly been furnishing my apartment since I moved here and am ALMOST done.  I just got my sofa a few days ago, so I am now in search of a coffee table to replace the empty box I am using as my table (total bachelor lol) :)  I think that about wraps up the basic introduction for now!  Ciao
