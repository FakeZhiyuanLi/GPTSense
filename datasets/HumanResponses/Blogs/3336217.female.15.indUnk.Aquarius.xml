      -There are a lot of things you have done to hurt me but I think the one that has hurt me the most is the time I stood & watched you ask her to dance... to our song  -Though I will always love you & remember the times we had, you're a sorry little bastard & you hurt me really bad, although you think it's funny & only time will tell, that paybacks are bitches & I hope you burn in hell, although you were a great lover, that I will admit, but when it comes to being a man, you're far from one  -I've got a bad case of a broken heart & you're the only one who has the cure  -How softly you tiptoed into my world, so silently, only a moment you stayed, but what an imprint your footsteps have left upon my heart  -I'm not shooting for a successful relationship at his point, I'm just looking for something that will prevent me from throwing myself in front of a bus.. I'm keeping my expectations very very low  -There will come a time in your life when you will become infatuated with a single soul. For this person you'd do anything & not think twice about it, but when asked why, you have no answer. You'll try your whole life to understand how a single person can affect you as much as they do, but you'll never find out & no matter how badly you hate it or how badly it hurts, you'll love this person without regret, for the rest of your life  -I wish you were here with me. I wish I was there with you, but most of all I wish I didn't wish for you  -I've come to know that when I saw you, I should've ran away  -People say hate is a strong word, well so is love but people throw that around like it's nothing...  -I think of you & I can't help but smile. I smile & I can't help but laugh. I laugh & I can't help but to remember...  -You wish I would let you have me..  -I might not be what you want but at least I'm something  -Its sad to think, we're not gonna make it and neight one of us wants to be the first to say goodbye...  -You bleed to know you're alive  -How will you know I'm hurting if you cannot see my pain? To wear it on my body tell what words cannot explain...  -Strummin' my pain with his fingers, singin' my life with his words  -I want to know how your lips taste, I bet they're sweeter than life.  -Can't shout, can't scream, hurt myself to get the pain out.  -Now you hurt yourself on the outside to kill the thing on the inside.  -Talking to yourself is one of the first signs of insanity.Yeah, thats why I leave myself at home if I go out.

      -- Since The First Time You Ran Your Fingers Through My Hair. Since The First Time Our Hands Became One. Since The First Time Your Kisses Took Away My Pain...I Knew I Would Never Be The Same.  --In Every Life There Is One Good Love, And One Unforgettable Heartbreak.  --Why Do I Have To Love Him?  --All I want is a guy who will accept me for who I am. A guy who will understand that at times I will confuse him cause most of the time I confuse myself...A guy who will understand that I'm not perfect...That I make mistakes just like everyone else...A guy who will cheer me up when I'm sad...A guy that will give me the attention I need, but still give me my space...A guy who will stand up for me, even when I'm not around...I don't want a guy who is perfect...Just a guy who is perfect for me.  -- If you're gonna do it...Do it right (I have a drawing along with this that helps explain it...It's just of a slit wrist.)  -- Definition of the 'Just friends' phrase: I don't just want you to mourn the loss of us; I want to remind you everyday. I want you to suffer. I want you to envy. I want you to die slowly, a bit at a time. And I want you to smile and thank me for it. (yet again, I drew a picture to go along with this, but its pretty explanatory.)

      -- It Isn't Enough To Have Your Heart Break, Because Everyones Heart Is Broken Now - Allen Ginsberg  -- He Can Never Be Truly Yours Because He Will Always Carry Around A Piece Of Me.  -- I'd like to believe that someday I'll be over him, That I'll wake up one morning and not miss him anymore, That I'll finally understand that when he broke my heart it was for a reason I just don't understand yet...But maybe soon. And when I do realize, I'll know without a doubt that he messed up...Not me.  -- You've left a mark on my sounl, on my mind and in my heart.  -- You do not set that standard. You have not walked in my footsteps, danced in my shoes or lived in my world. Do not judge me, point your fingers at me, or become experts on my life. Instead, celebrate with me in times of joy and cry with me in times of pain. Only then will we begin to understand each other.  -- I'd rather have bad times with you than good times with someone else...I'd rather be beside you in a storm than safe and warm by myself...I'd rather had hard times together than have it easy apart...I'd rather have the one who holds my heart.  -- I thought I could trust you when I gave you my heart, but you dropped in on the floor like it meant nothing. It shattered into a million pieces, and no matter how hard I look I'll never find them all. So, now my heart is bound in bandages but everytime I see you they unravel and my heart falls apart again.  -- I fyou ask what I look for in a guy, I will say that I look for a guy who tries. A guy who lives his life and deals with what it brings. And not someone who will try and buy my love with diamond rings. I'm not asking for the so called "perfect guy". Just someone who will be there for me if I need to cry, someone who will always care, someone who will lend a hand and will always be there.

      -- I asked you if I was pretty, you said no.    I asked you if I was fat, you said yes, of course.    I asked you if you wanted to be with me forever, you said no.    I asked you if you would cry if I walked away, you said no.    I had heard too much and had needed to leave and as I walked away, you grabbed my arm and told me to stay. You said, you're not pretty, you're beautiful and the only fat or big thing about you is your heart. I don't want to be with you forever, I need to be with you forever, and baby, I wouldn't cry if you walked away...I would die.  -- I'll have another chance, I'll find another guy, I'll see another day and I'll build another world and I'll find another life, just like you told me to, I'll find another love but there will never be another you...  -- As Soon As Forever Is Through, I'll Be Over You...  -- Sometimes You Meet That One Guy And Just Know...And Just Knowing Makes You Put Up With The Hurt, Cry The Tears, And Wait Because You Know You Two Are Meant To Be, And Eventually You'll Have Your Smile And Perfect Guy.  -- I Feel Like I'm Invisible To You...Like I'm Not Real.  -- I Hate The Way I Could Never Hate You. I Want To Hurt You So Badly. I Want To Do To You What You Did To Me Just So You Know What It Feels Like, But If I Did I Know I Couldn't Live With Myself Because I Wouldn't Wish That Pain On Anyone, And To Me You Aren't Just Anyone...You're That World.  -- Love Started At Two With A Teddy Bear. The Only Difference is Now My Teddy bear Is ___FT With _____ Hair And Loves Me Back.  -- No, This Is Not A 'PHASE' I'm Going Through.  -- You've got to sing like nobodies listening!    You've got to love like you'll never get hurt!    You've got to dance like nobodies watching!    You've got to live like it's heaven on earth!  -- Its feels like one of those days where I feel like crying and I do. But no tears are falling from my eyes, my heart is crying and thats so much worse.  -- Never forget your past, it holds too much value to be tossed away even with the pain some will have to endure. Never give up. S. G. Smith

      -- I Didn't Realize How Much I Loved You Until You Said Goodbye, Walked Away And Never Once Looked Back.  --Wait for the guy who will be your best friend, the person who'll drop everything to be with you at anytime of day no matter what, the guy who makes you smile like no other guy can and when he looks at you, you know he needs you, the guy who thinks you're beautiful even when your hairs a mess, you have no make-up on, the guy who will stay awake just to watch you sleep, the one who will call you just to hear your voice, but most of all wait for the guy who'll make you the center of his universe, because obviously he'll be the center or yours...  -- Her Tears Fall Like Rain. Her Soul Cries Like A Child.    Her Heart Melts Like Wax. Yet She Smiles All The While...  -- Am I mad at you? That's your main concern after shattering my whole world ? Mad for what? Breaking my heart? Or for all the lies? Maybe for letting me put all my trust in you only to be betrayed? How about the fact you didn't even have the decency to tell me to my face? Or the way you think It's crazy that I'm crying over it coz to you, breaking up with me is no big deal. Am I mad at you?...No, More like crushed....Did I ever really know you?  -- I can't get mad at you for hurting me over and over again because over and over again....I let you...       A BROKEN HEART CAN MEND BUT....WHAT HAPPENS TO A DEAD ONE?  -- It's hard to find good in someone when you've already found the best in someone else.  -- One night the moon said to me, "Why don't you leave him if he makes you cry?"...The I said, "Moon, would you ever leave the sky?"...

      You have managed to stumble across my...What to call it...Blog seems appropriate (seeing as how this   is a Blog) but I myself don't like to refer to it as that. Diary, yet again, seems to fit, but, no, that sounds too elementary for my taste. How about just "This is my heart...Stripped". Seeing as this is my heart, broken down for you to view. This   blog as so they're referred to, is just my life put into little quotes and meaningless poems that I myself have written or I have read somewhere and they seemed appropriate. I may or may not write an entry during this course (however long its deemed to last). It may very well be mostly made up of quotes and poems (I would add in my doodles and drawings but I have no way, that I know of, to do that...As I've been told I am very talented in that field). I may add in an entry here or there to   vent, who knows, I sure as hell don't. I will not divulge too much personal information on this   blog as this is my heart we're talking about, and in its state now, its very fragile. (That and being mysterious is so much more fun :oP) During the course of this blog   if you wish to get in touch with me, you can leave a comment   I believe, or e-mail me at hot_n_spicey_05@hotmail.com That's it for now (I want to see what it looks like :oP) and I won't take up anymore of your time. Thank you for reading and I hope you enjoy. P.S. Feel free to use the quotes or poems that I have posted, they're here for you to see (As well as me to vent). Take care and Much love.

      it may not always be so; and I say that if your lips,which I have loved, should   touch another's, and your dear strong fingers clutch  his heart, as mine in time not far away;  if on another's face your sweet hair lay   in such a silence as I know, or such  great writhing words as, uttering overmuch,  stand helplessly before the spirit at bay;  if this should be, i say if this should be-  you of my heart, send me a little word;   that I may go unto him, and take his hands,  saying, Accept all happiness from me.  Then shall I turn my face, and hear one bird  sing terribly afar in the lost lands.  unlove's the heavenless hell and homeless home  ...lovers alone wear sunlight.

      I want to be remembered as the girl who smiled. The girl who could brighten everyones day. Even if she couldn't brighten her own.  When your heart gets broken. It doesn't ever seem to work quite the same again.  Don't turn around. I don't want you to see me cry. Just walk away. I'm letting you go, baby don't turn around.    I Barely Can Remember, Yet I Can't Forget. Your Words Still BURN Like Flames, In The HALLOW Of My Chest.  Figertips Are Cold, Underneath My Clothes. Lips Walking Down My Neck. My Body Freezes Cold  CRUCIFY ME  I Will Do Anything To Keep You  Here  CAUSE I'M HURTING  It's Worth It...Giving Myself To You It's Over...You're Already Gone.

      Just another broken mess laying on the floor.  Waiting to be picked up.  Another rainfall of tears on her cheek.  More cutting words breaking her piece of mind.  When will he just let her be?  Don't look at me like I'm nothing.  Don't talk to me like 'we' never happened.  Don't dare ask me if I'll wait for you.  Don't say you love me but really mean just for now.  Don't walk away expecting I'll still be here when you decide to walk back in & lastly, don't hurt me because you know you can.  I guess the reason we could never work things out and is cause you were too proud to forgive me for something I was truly sorry for.  The kisses you put on my forehead when you think I'm off dreaming in sleep; those are the ones that mean the most cause you did it cause you wanted to, not cause you felt you had to.  He's the kind of guy that could look at you when you're knee deep in tissues & your face looks like its been badly beated & with all honesty tells you that you're nothing less than beautiful.  Real love hurts: Real love makes you totally vunerable and open; Real love will take you far beyond yourself; Therefor Real love will devastate you. If love doesn't shatter you, you don't know love.  First love. The love that clings to your heart forever, no matter how much pain it has caused no matter how many tears have fallen. First love will never leave the soul.  I used to be normal...young & happy...Now I'm left a broken image of the girl I used to be     I wish I could walk away and forget about what we had, but I can't because I know you won't come after me and I guess thats what hurts the most.  Sometimes the worst thing he could do is tell you that you could find someone better than him...When at that moment all you want is him.  Its funny how someone can live every day of their life not knowing their existance is the reason you live.  The hardest part about walking away from you is knowing you won't run after me.  The most beautiful smile is the one that struggles through the tears.  He hugs himself coz I'm not worth it.

      My guilt trip is done.  Crying for no-one,  Only for what I've become.   Dressed in white,  Yet stained in black,  Waiting for the pain to attack.   It embraces my skin,  Enveloping it,  In crimson tears,  Surging through my veins,  Denying my hopes,  Electrifying my wildest fears.   The memories tarnished,  With the knowledge of you.  The good times forgotten,  Only by you.   The bad times haunt me,  To say the least.  Made me stronger,  Infesting the weakness,  Turning it to rust.   Beautiful angel,  Is embodied in sin,  Smile evil one,  Let the darkness in.   It immerses me in death,  Holding me,  It will only fight,  Squeezing me with all it's might,  Never failing,  To grasp me tight.   Oh Darkness,  My sweetest friend,  I've come to talk with you again.

      The couple sits at a picnic bench, silently staring at one another. From the perspective of a passerby it seems as if the two are sharing a romantic dinner, but in reality each is trying to grasp what is happening. The silence is unbearable between them, but at the same time they both are terrified of saying the wrong thing. Finally he breaks the silence and says: "Sweetheart, you know I love you."  For a moment she doesn't speak and when she does she quietly whispers:  "What does that mean?"  "What?"  "What does that mean. What do you meanwhen you say I love you? What does love mean to you? You always say that you love me whenever we fight, but maybe they're just words. Expalin to me what you want me to know or feel when you say that you love me."  "I don't think I can explain it. I'm not sure that I know."  "Well if you don't know then how do you know that you love me? What are those words supposed to mean when you say them. That's all I need to know. Just tell me what you mean."  "I honestly don't know."  She tries to hold back the tears when he says this. He answered the one way she was hoping he wouldn't and she doesn't know what to say now. She doesn't want him to see how much saying that hurt, but at the same time she wants him to see. She wants him to know how much he means to her, but she is also terrified of her heart being completely ripped apart. So as calmly as she can, she says:  "I think I'm going to go now."  "No, wait. Don't go."  "I really think I need to. Goodbye."  And this time it is her words that sting him. He can't figure out why that one answer means so much to her and he is angry that she would end it all because of one stupid thing. So he yells out after her:  "What does it mean to you? when you say you love me what does that mean? Can you explain it?"  She stops in her tracks and with tears in her eyes she replies:  "When I say I love you I mean that I care about you so much that there are no other words to describe it. It means that when you kiss me I feel alive and when I look at you I can't help but smile. It means that I think you are this wonderful person and every day I spend with you I just find out more reasns to care about you. It means that when I'm with you I feel safe, like nothing can harm me and that is the best feeling I have ever had. Maybe when I sy I love you I don't know exactly what love is but I do know that the way I feel towards you is stronger than anything I have ever felt before and if it's not love it is the closes damn thing that I have felt to it. And I would do so much just to make you happy. That's what it means when I say I love you."  "Oh."  "Look I can't make you feel things that you don't feel. I can't make your emotions for me stronger than they are no matter how much I wish I could. And if I've learned anything from my mistakes with guys in the past it is that you can't make things ok by holding on, you can't make feelings appear just by not leaving. And frankly it hurts too much to stay. So I have to go."  "No. Look just wait one minute. I'm sorry that I can't explain to you what love is to me. I'm just not good with words."  "Words don't matter. Don't you see? I don't need poetry, I don't need romantic prose, but I do need to know how you feel. I can't continue feeling as if I'm just this girl taking up your time until you find someone you really love or until something better comes along. I'm already too attached and it is so hard to walk away from you, but I have to. I can't stay."  "Why not? Please stay. I don't want you to leave."  "Then tell me what you mean when you say that you love me."  "I can't. But I'm not ready to say goodbye to you. I'm not ready to end this quite yet. I don't want to lose your friendship."  "Friendship? This has nothing to do with my friendship. We'll always be friends. It's just my love that you're losing."  "This can't be it. It can't end this way."  "Then tell me what love is to you? That's all I need to know. I just need to know how you really feel."  "I don't know how I feel. I just know that I don't want this to end."  "And I just know that I can't stay unless I know how you feel."  "And I don't know. So what do we do now?"  As a tear escapes her eye she kisses his cheek, gives him a hug that probably lasts a moment too long and then whispers into his ear:  "I don't know."  Then she turns her back and walks away, trying so hard not to turn around, not to go back and say that none of it matters. But she knows it does and no matter how much it hurts to know that she just broke her own heart she also knows that it's better than him breaking it.

      Look Into My Eyes For One Moment And Then You Will Realize Just How Much You Mean To Me.  It Breaks My Heart To Look Into Your Eyes And Not See My Reflection, But Hers.  You Don't Get To Choose, You Just Fall.  Nothing Is More Painful Than Realizing He Meant Everything To You And Yet You Meant Nothing To Him.  Just Coz Someone Doesn't Love You The Way You Wan't Them To, Doesn't Mean They Don't Love You With All They Have.  When You Finally Find The 'Perfect' Guy, You Can't Help But Think To Yourself. Why Isn't He Taken?  A Relationship Is Built On Trust. If You Don't Have That, What've You Got?  Not All Scars Show. Not All Wounds Heal. Sometimes You Can't Always See The Pain Someone Feels.  One Of The Hardest Things Is Seeing The One You Love, Loving Someone Else.  People Who Laugh A Lot Cry A Lot Because It Only Takes One Smile To Hide A Thousand Tears.  His Smile Made Me Want To Make All His Lies Worth Believing.  Alone I Hide In The Darkness. Shadows Conceal My Face For My Beauty Is My Curse.   And With My One Last Gasping Breath I'd Apologize For Bleeding On Your Shirt >>

      I used to live in a world of lies where no one really cared everyone I loved said good-bye and friendship was never there alone I hid in the dark and the shadows concealed my face warmth had forsaken my hardened heart and no one dared enter my place until the resless night when you said hello to me it was like you turned on a light and I could finally see you showed me all the colours  that were hidden from my eyes and unlike all the others  you haven't said good-bye now you hold me safe and warm and bring me out of my shell you keep me in your gentle embrace and now it's not about myself you've shown me a world of beautiful tomorrows you've given me the real truth you chased away all my sorrows and now I've fallen in love with you

      The day I fell in love with you Was that beginning of forever I cherish every moment That we spend together  You came into my life And gave it a whole new view It's hard to imagine how things would be If I had never met you  I thought I could easily define what love is But you gave it a whole new meaning You gave me a love that's unconditional A shoulder to cry on and a really good feeling  You taught me that love is not only something that is told But something that is also seen and felt It's seen in your eyes And it's felt when your heart begins to melt  In you, I've found someone Whom I can confide We keep no secrets... We tell no lies  In you, I've also found everlasting love A love that will be felt for eternity And in that everlasting love I found you, my one and only

      Those blind eyes That seeing heart You're right here But we're worlds apart  You don't see my face But you feel my love It seems you were sent From heaven above  You see past my looks And deep into my soul You look past this fraction And see me as a whole  They say "Love is blind" And they may be right Because our love as one Doesn't need any sight  You see with your heart As I mentioned before When so many, they miss What is in someones core  They look at their clothes And are concerned with their face They spend so much time on their outfits In this beauty race  They aren't like you Who doesn't see You understand The real me  Behind my plain dress You see my true self You don't judge by my cover Like I'm a book on a shelf  You read me completely And understand every word I simply treasure knowing That my desires are heard  I don't hate those people And they don't hate me I just wish that they Would learn how to see

      it tears at my insides and you must know but you pay it no mind continue walking, you instruct me and whether i go willingly or not i am wrong i am forever wrong there is no escape when youre this trapped all i can do is play your game paste on a smile and cry and cut up my frustrations later all i can do is take it because fighting back is taking the knife from you and piercing my skin for you my methods of escape are what keep me from this ever trapping feeling but as it grows worse worse and worse as the earth rotates i wonder if solution is a real word and if pain is not the core of the universe ...or at least mine why do you do it? it does not matter i am wrong  so slice i will for me and sit down and die i will for you.

      How did we get so broken?...The people we loved...they forgot to love us back..  To run away is to put a new face on the same lonliness.  Life is kinda hard sometimes, especially when every move you make feels like a test of your strength to survive another day without breaking down.  Snow White, Cinderella. All about wanting a guy, being saved by a guy. Today it's Little Mermaid, Aladdin, Pochahontas. All about getting a guy. So basically we're screwed up coz of Disney  I feel like I don't know you anymore, I used to think that you were a wonderful person that I would always need. You used to be so sweet in my eyes. My opinion on you has changed, but funny thing is I still need you...  What if Prince Charming had never shown up? Would Snow White have laid in that glass box forever? Or would she have gotten up, spit out that apple, gotten a job and a health care plan and moved on with her life?  Give those you love a place to cry and never a reason to need it.  It's not about who knew you the longest, it's about who never left your side...  It only takes a moment to fall in love and in that split second know its forever...  She behaves as if she was beautiful. Most American women do it. It is the secret of their charm -- Oscar Wilde  Life was so much easier when our clothes didn't match and boys had cooties.  If life was like a shell, mine would be a shell of glass. You touch my life with care and I will not break and the tiny bit of force will send me crashing to the floor.  When you do that with someone, your body makes a promiise to theirs, whether you do or not.  Remember that life isn't about the number of breaths you take, but the number of moments that take your breath away.  If you look back on the events of the year, whether good or bad and you don't get tears in your eyes, then it was all a waste of time.  I could fill a thousand pages tell you how I felt and still you wouldn't understand, so now I leave without a sound except my heart shattering as it hits the ground.  You hurt me more than I deserve, how can you be so cruel? I love you more than you deserve, how can I be such a fool?  Hand holding doesn't mean you're in love, kisses don't always mean something real, promises are broken as fast as they're made and sometimes...goodbyes are forever...

      A boy like you could break me Ben then you'd have to pay the fee Scarred and bruised Abused and used In places you cannot see My porcillian skin is cracked My dress is already torn There really ins't much to say I'm not such a pretty doll But you still want me anyway Paint me a picture of your love; Your dirty little doll Pull my strings Drag me down I don't have far to fall I'm laying on the rocks now Covered in sweat and blood and lies I'm only here for you to see I'm here so feast your eyes I'm blind now But I can see A boy like you just broke me.

      If I could make a wish, And have it last forever and a day. I'd wake up in your arms, And right there's where I'd stay.  'Cause theres no one else I know, Who can hold my heart like you. And baby I know someday, All this waiting will be through.  If I could make a wish, I'd feel your lips on mine. I'd loose myself completely, In the sweet moment in time.  'Cause theres no one else I know, Who can spark that fire in me. And I know someday, You'll set my spirit free.  If I could make a wish, I'd be looking in your eyes. Seeing everything I've wished for, On stars and midnight skies.  And there no one else I know, Who can see into my soul. And baby I know someday, You'll make my life feel whole.  If I could make a wish, I'd live inside your heart. So I'd know all your secrets, Right from the very start.  'Cause theres no one else I know, Who I want to know inside and out. But I know someday, I'll know it all without a doubt.  if I could make a wish, "Someday" would start right now. And there'd be no more waiting, No more maybe's or wondering how.  But until that day, I want you to know, Right here is where I'll be. Wishing you were right here, With me.

       *I want to cry, really I do. But guess I just don't want to give you the satisfaction on knowing that you hurt me...     &nbsp;   *You're my favourite scar. (one of my all time faves)     &nbsp;   *Have you ever heard a song from long ago with so many memories tied to it that it made you cry? And didn't&nbsp; you wish that you could go back into that time when everything seemed so much simpler and carefree? Those are the songs that are the soundtracks of our lives....The ones that bring back childhood memories, best friends, first loves, first heartbreaks, the memories...     &nbsp;   *For some, life lasts a short while, but the memories it holds last forever.     &nbsp;   *How many tears must I cry before you notice?     &nbsp;   *And you know what the hardest part is? That now, when I cry, I don't even try to stop my tears because I know they're going to fall no matter what.     &nbsp;   *As she sits upon her window sill, she knows that love, love is something she'll never feel, and her tears keep her company, and she dreams of how it would be as she cries...     &nbsp;   *Atleast be there to wipe away my tears if you're going to make me cry     &nbsp;   *I'm so afraid to care about someone, I know it seems like I'm this strong girl who can get through everything, but inside I'm very fragile. I've had so many things thrown at me, and each one has only made me crack. What I'm afraid of is shattering...     &nbsp;   *I don't know what I want in life. I don't know what I want right now. All I know is that I'm hurting so much inside that it's eating me, and one day, there won't be any of me left. Everything that ever caused a tear to trickle down my cheek, I run away and hide from it. But now, everything is unwinding and finding its was back towards me. And I don't know what to do. I just know that the pain I felt so long ago, it's hurting ten times more.     &nbsp;   * It took me a long time finding you, you're someone I want to have even after death and if&nbsp;I find myself in heaven without holding your hand, I'll go searching for you all over again.     &nbsp;   *If you love me let me know, if you don't...then let me go..     &nbsp;   *There are no goodbyes for us. Whatever you are, you will always be in my heart -Gandhi     &nbsp;   *The greatest thing you will ever now is to love and be loved in return.     &nbsp;   *Loving someone and being in love with them are two totally different things.     &nbsp;   *I wanna know how your lips taste...I bet they're sweeter than life.     &nbsp;   *The way you look, the way you laugh, the way you love with all you have...There aint nothin bout you that don't do somethin for me...(its a song, I don't actually talk like that (thank satan))     &nbsp;   *Treat me like an angel and I'll be your lil devil     &nbsp;   *The whole world is going to hell and I'm drivin the bus!!!     &nbsp;   *There are no words to describe how beautiful she is or how special she is or my love for her. To put these things into words would be to define them, to qualify them, which means to limit them. There would be a beginning, and an end.&nbsp; There is no definition fitting, nor any limit, nor beginning or end to her beauty, or how special she is, or my love for her.     &nbsp;   *A girls love is in her heart...A guys love is in his pants.     &nbsp;   *Just you and me not saying much of anything sometimes can mean more than a thousand words.     &nbsp;   *I remember most of 17. I remember the day we met, his smile, his touch you can be anywhere when your life begins, when the future opens up infront of you &amp; you may not even realize it at first, but its already happening.     &nbsp;   *We've been down this path for a very short while but we still walk it mile by mile. We've walked through flowers, rain and on thorns, but we made it and we aren't torn! See we are still strong as ever just look at what we've been through together. See I love you and you love me and that makes up the best we can be.     &nbsp;   *Did anyone hear about the gay midget...he came outta the cupboard     &nbsp;   *You're not drunk if you can lay on the floor without holding onto it     &nbsp;   *Women are meant to be loved...not understood     &nbsp;   *I'm gonna live forever or die trying     &nbsp;   *If you don't love me at me worst....You don't deserve me at my best     &nbsp;   *Though no one can go back and make a brand new start, anyone can start from new and make a brand new end.     &nbsp;   *As long as you're happy, I'll deal with the consequences&nbsp;.

      Barbie  I force myself to laugh, I force myself to grin, I force my eyes to sparkle, For what I am is a Barbie, Because what I am is fake.     I make my life seem perfect,  I don't let you know that I make myself thin,  Nor that I drag this blade across my  Skin, to make me feel for once, I cover my bruises with make-up, I cover my tears with lies. I let the boys think I'm easy, If only to be held  For just a little while. For what I am is a Barbie,  Whose life is picture perfect.     I let the girls think I'm nice Just so they won't know  That I scar myself, I torture myself, I don't even know who I really am.  My laughing is really gasps Grasping for my life.  I am a Barbie; Beautiful and safe.  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  Like A Child   I open my eyes, Wanting to sleep evermore, I slowly get out of bed, My limbs feel oh-so tired and sore.    I get dressed, I put on my make-up, Swallow my pills, Take a sip from my cup.    The food is set on the table, Beckoning to be eaten. It whispers to me to walk a little closer, I feel as if I'm beaten.    I know I should eat, I know I should consume my food, But I am so uncertain, I do not know if I could.    Like a little child, I am forced to sit at the table. My throat clogs up, I know I will never be able.    Tears fall down my face, Bites are forced to be taken. I may not leave,  If only you could be mistaken.    Like a little child, I am so afraid of what I will attain; Not of darkness or monsters, But what I will gain.    Like a little child, I must learn to thrive;  Not to walk or to talk, But on how to survive. Like a little child, I know someone will come To my rescue, But no one will even succumb.    I am tired of this facade, I no longer want to be a little child, Let me live, let me grow, Let me no longer feel exiled.  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  Person Long Forgotten   Behind a mirror a colorless face looks back at me, I knew this person once, But have long forgotten that person I had once adored. This girl I now recognize Still does not know me, She is too scared, To look in too deep. This little girl hears a noise, Turns around, Afraid her master is upset. I try to tell her that I love her, That I’ll do anything for her, Just believe me, Just trust me, I’ll help her to survive. She starts to realize I am truthful, She reaches out a bony hand And I know that she has faith. Cold, gray eyes look down At herself, And she sees the reality after all these years. Her emaciated body Is so frail and so fragile, With one little step she could break into pieces. I’ve got her tiny fingers Held in my hand, But then she looks back And sees her enslaver And thinks that she will not survive. Looking back and forth, A bewildered expression does not know what to do. But then she takes a step back, And I realize whom she has chosen. The monster smiles, Grabs her hand, And return to their own Hell.

      I'd like to think that you're somewhere out there, just waiting to find me and take my breath away. I'm looking forward to when I first get to meet you and look into your gorgeous eyes and see a flash of your breath-taking smile. When I get to hear the tone of your voice and fall in love with you for all time. Because I really do love you. I love everything about you. When I cry I know you'll be by my side, hugging me and comforting me. And when I laugh I know you'll be near to share my joy. When I fall I know you'll be with me to help me back up. When I say something stupid, I know you'll just smile, laugh and never make fun of me. When I get mad at you, I know you'll give me my space and say you're sorry. You'll always say you're sorry. You'll always ask how my day was and I'll ask about yours. You'll cuddle with me when it gets cold outside. You'll lay with me on the roof of a house, on a blanket and stare at the stars. We'll giggle like little kids again. You'll brush my hair out of my face when it gets whipped around in the wind, and you'll wipe the tears from my eyes. You'll never forget that I love roses, oreos and 10 mile jogs, bubble baths and trips to the beach. You'll never forget when I was born or the sound of my laugh, or the look in my eyes when you look in them and see how much I love you. You'll never forget the faint drawing of my breath on cold nights when were laying beside one another, or the feel of my hands in yours. We'll drive for hours into the night, whispering quietly to one another, falling in love all over again. We'll wink at each other when no ones looking at us, we'll see parts of each others soul that we thought no one could see. I'll never forget your humour, your love for life, your compassion, your integrity and the pain I can see hidden deep in the pools of green that are your eyes. I'll never push you away from me when you give me a kiss, I'll never get mad at your for petty things. I'll never leave you or cheat on you. I'll never stop loving you, and you'll never stop loving me. When we do finally meet, I'll get this feeling inside of me. This feeling like I dont need to worry anymore. I dont need to wish anymore. My worries are gone, my wish has come true. I can finally be happy. I finally have you.    .......kids and their silly dreams...................
