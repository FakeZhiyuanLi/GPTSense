      shitty saturday. hi.  it's freezin' ass cold and weather person says we may get up to 20 inches of snow over this not-so-blessed weekend.  ugh.  stuff is blah right now.  (i'm so damn eloquent)  on some stupid-ass sitcom i'd never seen in my life and that i watched for approximately 1 1/2 minutes..i heard talk of a swear jar.  (Put money in when ya swear, ya'know)  so yeah, i should do that and then take a  BIG FUCKING VACATION .   *sigh*    i'm frustrated right now.  i read  urlLink cock under lock  yesterday and it made me so sad.  it affected me all day long.  i just see dismal stuff everywhere i look lately.  things are really tough with lindsay right now..not between us but just the junk going on in his life.  love him more all the time.  work is tiring.  my cat is named sam.  and ...  i'm done whining for now.  adding some more people to the side there.  i keep stumbling upon more people that i enjoy.  be click happy.  help me see that comments are working too.   hehe.   =o))

      i read  urlLink jason's blog .  you see...  i don't know jason.  i don't know  urlLink lane  either....but i've linked them.  I suppose i don't have to know people to link them....right??  anyway..  i don't even remember how i learned of the term "blog" but i did and i started discovering interesting people.  i'm not generally one to leave comments and such but i get fascinated and absorbed in what i'm reading and can't wait to hear what happens next.  heh.  i don't find myself being stalker'ish or vicariously living through others....but i was enjoying reading others' blogs and was fond of the ones i found that belong to lane and to jason.  their 'story' makes me say "awww" in the most genuine tone of syrupy sap.  what the hell is my point here?!  i swear i have one.  i'm not writing a disclaimer....nor justifying..just sort of typing an explanation.  heh.  lindsay keeps telling me to stop apologizing.  i'm working on it..    so i like dirty things.  sometimes i AM a dirty thing.  i wasn't sure what tone this blog would take...that will shift and shiver and mutate and squirm, of course....but i wanted to link people i don't know personally...just fond of their blog/s and in the end thought..  what if those people think i'm a crazy freak for linking them on this pitiful blog??  (sorry for apologizing)  heh. a few of my links are kinda dirty.... sooo jason and lane definitely fell into the category of "neat people" but i wanted to clarify that their sites are not generally of the sexual nature.   ha.  does any of this make sense?!  anyway, the sailor moon pic of jason is hot indeed and lane is adorable so if you wanna click their links...do so.  they have lots to say on varying topics and i've become interested in the daily happenings of their lives.  i was referring to  urlLink jason's blog  yesterday when i wrote about "real live preacher dot com."  there ya have it, folks.  Ohh, and..  it's a strangely pleasant surprise to pop onto someone's site and see your own site there linked.  Weee!!  fun times.  hi lane & jason.

      i keep posting today.  yay.  anyway, i'm adding a new link to the side over there and i just wanted to draw some attention to it.  it's something i'm very intrigued by..  (Long story kinda short)  ..  during my walk today i ended up at a friend's house..a girl i went to college with.  i attended a private, Baptist liberal arts college.  *mixed feelings*  (rewinding)  i ended a long relationship with someone mainly on the basis that...  he didn't believe in god.  where am i now on this?  i'm.....  uh..  not sure.  but she knew of our relationship and when i saw her tonight she asked me about him.  she asked me if i'd heard of a site called "real live preacher dot com."  i hadn't and then tonight when perusing some blogs that i read...i saw someone had just added a link to that site.  coincidence, hm?  so..i feel like rambling on this topic for awhile but i'm not sure how.  i have to be honest...  in a perfect world...  i'd like to be with lindsay forever and i've found myself questioning whether we do/will/would agree on issues of faith...  truth is...  he's the most spiritual, faithful, beautiful, caring, soulful, amazing being i've ever known.  no, i don't think we agree on many faith based issues..  maybe "religion" would be the dirty word to insert here.  i hate religion.  hate hate hate.  i do, however....love God.  i've abandoned much of what i grew up 'knowing.'  this can be good and bad.  i want god to be a mainstay...core of my life.  however, ahhhhhhhhhh...  this topic is going deeper than i intended and i feel as though i'm talking in circles.....mainly to myself.  I want to include something lindsay shared with me.  i printed a copy of it the day he sent it and have kept it near me since.  this will be long but i'm gonna send it regardless.   "We were taught many things throughout our lives by people in a position of authority over us or by people we looked up to for one reason or another.  For the most part, we accepted what we learned on faith because of the position of esteem they held in our mind.  Some people never re-examine the ideas and opinions they have held for a long time.  Those we've learned from may have been wrong, or only partially right, or only known part of the truth.  Yet, we believe without question, as if they are gods.  Question everything.  There's a natural fear that if our thinking changes, we may lose an important part of ourselves or somehow become...changed.  That's the point!  Free yourself from restrictive thinking and you gain expanded awareness.  You will still be you - a better you, but still you just the same.  There is nothing to fear unless you fear becoming a more enlightened person."  (there's more)  dennis gaskill wrote that, want to give him credit.    what's my point? lindsay is truly..  an everyday angel.   my everyday angel .  he inspires me, makes me want to be a better person, pushes me to grow and learn and share.  i hope he knows how important that all is to me and how much i love him for it.  i'm blessed to have had him as any part of my life and i plan on keeping him.  i hope he plans on doing the same.  real live preacher.  that's the link i'm adding over there.  read it if you want.  i'm gonna go check it out for myself.  feeling thirsty.

      i don't do too much talking these days.  oh wow.  i haven't heard that song in awhile.  nico.  these days.  it's on the soundtrack to the royal tenenbaums.  i love that song.  it's bouncy.  i have been out walking.  i'm proud and it felt l o v e l y.  upon returning home i decided to drive my route just so i could map out the exact distance.  wasn't too far but i walked a bit over 3 miles today.  i wanna do the same tomorrow....and the next day....and the nex..  yes.  i have a route down now and i also know that the corner of Reed & Moss is the 2 mile mark.  heh.  what else?  Hm..     i need to be fucked.  oh lindssssssssssayyyyyyyy.....

      captain kangaroo died today.   =o(  "Bob Keeshan, who gently entertained and educated generations of children as television's walrus-mustachioed Captain Kangaroo, died Friday at 76.  He would visit with puppet animals, like Bunny Rabbit, who was scolded for eating too many carrots, and Mr. Moose, who loved to tell knock-knock jokes.  'Play is the work of children. It's very serious stuff. And if it's properly structured in a developmental program, children can blossom,' he said."  i just quoted a news-story..  is "mustachioed" a word?  i wanted to change it and then thought no...perhaps it's the correct format.  huh?  weird.  doesn't look right.  let's consult webster's.     Main Entry: mus·ta·chio Pronunciation: (")m&-'sta-shE-"O, -'stä-, -shO Function: noun Inflected Form(s):  plural -chios  Etymology: Spanish & Italian; Spanish mostacho, from Italian mustaccio, from Old Italian Date: 1588 : MUSTACHE; especially : a large mustache   - mus·ta·chioed /-shE-"Od , -shOd/ adjective   well...looky there.  it IS a word.  my brain has gained a new wrinkle today.  you never knew visiting this site would be educational..didya?  anyway..i like captain kangaroo.  i also adored mr. rogers and now they both have passed on..  spongebob is taking over.  =o(

      it makes my heart happy when i see him post something.   =o))   i just took the most glorious bath.  you see...taking a bath here is quite the undertaking.  i won't explain where i live right now but...i have a master key and there's an empty apartment downstairs sooooo...  i "crept" downstairs with a bag packed full of all bath necessities...candles, lavender oil and bath gloves included.  the tub is huge, deep and has claw feet.  it's placed in a corner with old brick wall on either side.  the floor is hardwood slats.  there's a window next to the tub so i opened it about an inch.  mind you, it's about 20 degrees outside.  the cold air in my lungs mixed with the steamy surroundings was nice..a lovely contrast that made me feel alive.  ahh.  the bath description is getting syrupy sweet.  anyway, somehow moments like those get me motivated and um..  "inspired" to do the things i need to do.. (ie exercise more, get organized, breathe deeper, eat more fruit, ride my bike for a zillion miles a day, do some non-spring cleaning, etc.)  watching the movie city of angels does the same thing for me.  huh?  yeah, i dunno.  enough of this.  wrapping up.  write comments, i like them.    you're beautiful, lindsay.  *i love you.*

      a friend of mine refers to it as..  "hot cock."  sriracha HOT chili sauce comes in a fun squeeze bottle with a rooster on the front and it is hot.    it's been a productive day.  i haven't posted on here for a couple days...but don't worry, you haven't missed out on anything.  i worked the 2nd job today.  i have 2 of 'em..both in the area of social work.  'alas..  i'm a bit worn out.  why did i sit down to post when i have nothin' to say?  i'm baking some chicken..missing lindsay...listening to music...fretting.    hope your day is beautiful.

      an uneventful day.   still aching for a touch from him. haven't accomplished much. walked barefoot in the balmy 18 degree weather.   had a meeting. every part of my life needs better organization... so much i'd like to accomplish right now, better time management...  rambling posts that hold little interest.  soon there will be something lovely to write of i'm sure..but for now you're faced with dull musings of my days.  wee!    "interesting" (i use the term loosely)  facts a/b me: Fact 1)  i have a black bear hamster named cecil. Fact 2)  he's real cute and has a pink nose.  (ok that wasn't a/b me) Fact 3)  i'm 24. Fact 4)  i have a bachelor of arts degree. Fact 5)  i'm an only child. Fact 6)  i love vanilla bean ice cream. Fact 7)  Music is my passion. Fact 8)  i'm generally frustrated these days. Fact 9)  this post was fairly pointless. ...I'd consider just adding 1 more cuz 10 seems more a round number than 9...however that would throw off the spacing, etc. so 9 it is.    I feel like turning this into some stream of consciousness blathering (not that it wasn't already).  How about a To Do list for myself.  Those are always fun and perhaps this'll hold me more accountable.  I need to improve building relationships with my residents, get the entryway of the house more organized, winterize all apartments here, work on finding a job more suitable to the things i like, organize everything, sort old things, throw stuff away and scold myself for being any semblance of a packrat, clean out my vehicle, write more letters with real paper and ink and again...manage my time better.  There.  enough for now.  Also thought I'd clarify for the off-hand chance that someone is reading this..lindsay is male.  Most have probably caught that, hopefully...but yeah...just clarifying.  * i wish he'd want me slutty today.  still aching..longing to be dirty for him...his girl..his voice low in my ears guiding me.  dirty.  patience.  love.  love you, lindsay.

      you've got such a pretty smile. it's a shame the things you hide behind it. let 'em go..  give it up for awhile. let 'em free and we will both go find it. i know there's nowhere you can hide it. i know the feeling of alone. i know that you do not feel invited.. but come back..  come back in from the cold. step away then from the edge. your best friend in life is not your mirror. back away come back away come back away.. i am here and i will be..forever and ever and i know...that there's nowhere you can hide it...i know the feeling of alone. trust me and don't keep that on the inside.   you're not alone.

(I think a total of 2 people might be..  lindsay and myself included)  ...  is the font really tiny?  on mine it's huge..  on his it's miniature baby font.  what do i do??  is it a setting on his computer?  is it the font setting on the template?

      just a few things to note that really don't matter:  - Champaka incense smells awful.  50 grams.  made in India.   - I enjoy coffee immensely. - rainy saturdays off work are a forgotten delight. - modest mouse..  also a delight...but n'er forgotten. - i want a dog. - anything eaten with lime & cilantro is good.  heh. - i don't know shit about HTML and it makes me frustrated.   Well, i enjoyed the day and am aching for him.  i need his skin.    this blog is exciting but pissing me off cuz i like colors and pictures and ideas and can usually do stuff with that but not when i have no clue how to "speak the language."  argh!  I need helpful tips!!  email me and tell me hints?  *sigh*  I've alternated between messing with blog stuff and being productive this afternoon/evening.  blog stuff turns time consuming and then i have nothing to show for it.  i'm thirsty, lindsay.. let me drink.   kinda fun?    urlLink

      he has a bread box. it's wooden. it says "bread" on the front. little white flower designs he doesn't like that much. glass front. has a door. "you put bread inside," he says..  i declare it "cool"  ..  officially.   i'm at a total loss. i don't know what to do or say. what matters? the world is kinda mean sometimes.  - insert parental life's not fair speech? -  i don't know how to help anymore. i guess i never did.

      ahh.  that always feels good.  i'm tired.  working lots.  off tomorrow then back to the grind for 7 days or so.  there..  i think prior to writing here i've maxxed out on my work griping quotient for the day so i'll end it there.  in other news..  i've been slowly watching Woodstock all week.  you've probably seen bits of it if not all.  a documentary about.. you guessed it!!  Woodstock.  it's beautiful.  i have to admit..  i can't remember ever being a crazy joe cocker fan but...  wow.  W O W.  when it got quiet and he started singing....i was in awe.  i was speechless and overwhelmed and it was 100% beautiful!  goosebumps.  "What would you do if i sang....out of tune?  -  Would you stand up and walk out on me?"  the song has always made me think of the show,  The Wonder Years , but now i'll think of Woodstock.  few hundred thousand people. peacefully assembled..close...intent...  it was like everything hushed before he started to sing.  i was moved.  truly.  my fumbling words don't do any part of it justice.  anyway, i really did rewind that joe cocker part a bunch..  probably 20 times.  heh.  viet nam.  wow.  i'd like to spend some time at woodstock.  i want to feel a freedom like that.  what am i saying?  no more fumbling and bumbling for tonight.  my brain needs to rest.  i saw my mom after work today.  i had dinner with her.  she had brought me some opium incense 'cause she knows i love it.  that was thoughtful, wasn't it?

      since i woke up this morning (and everyday in the past week) all i can think about is him..  wanting him in me, on me, over me, around me.  *sigh*  let me write about something i've been thinking of often..    i've been working all day and he's home before me.  when i find him we're both quiet..  we look at one another a lot, study each other's faces..slowly touch..  he lets me undress him.  he moves silently to the bed and lies face down.  i know what he wants and he can tell..though silent...i want it too.  he's beautiful.  his skin is beautiful and i want my mouth on it.  i can hardly wait as he gets comfortable...  his eyes close.  i pull off some of my clothes because i want to feel his skin touching mine.  we've both been working all day.  he's ready.  my face is close to him...close to his ass..  i make him wait.  he can feel me breathing, he can sense my face close to him..  he surprises me when he lifts a little, urging me on..  that's all it takes.  no more teasing..  i devour him.  i press close, spread him open for me and lick..suckle..  my tongue dives into him and fucks that perfect asshole.  my fingers are pulling him open to allow my tongue to plunge deeper.  he makes soft, encouraging noises and my mouth gets rougher.  i bite at him, bite at the skin on his asshole..  my fingers are fucking into him now.  they move in deep and fast while my tongue keeps everything slippery.  his ass.  oh god, his ass!  my other hand crawls underneath him and he lifts more for me..  i'm stroking his cock, fucking his ass and i cannot get enough.  my tongue moves back to him..fingers slip out and into my mouth.  he glances back and can see me suckling the fingers that were just fucking his ass.  within seconds he's turned around and pushed me onto my back...he kisses me and tells me how much he loves me and i know it's true.  i can feel it when he looks at me and shoves his cock into me.  i'm dripping.  i love his ass...i love licking it...i love fucking it.  his voice is in my ear.  he's telling me how he loves fucking my cunt.  my cunt grips his cock and he mumbles "fuck" over and over...  i'm coming all over his cock.  everything is soaking wet.  he fucks me hard while i come and as i'm floating slips out and quickly climbs up, pushing his cock into a mouth happy to have him there.  he fucks my mouth and i suck it eagerly.  delicious whimpers of delight.  i smile to myself and push a finger deep into his ass.  my finger fucks his ass as he fucks my mouth.  it doesn't take long.  he's coming and i'm swallowing, suckling every drop.  he finishes and slides down my body some.  he kisses me.  i kiss him back deep so he can taste himself.  there's come on my mouth.  the best is feeling his want to taste himself.  his mouth devours my own.  he reminds me that he loves me and i do the same.    after that we shower together, go for a walk in the sunshine and eat ice cream.    i love you, lindsay.

      my body wanted some sustenance tonight.  have avoided meat and i think my body was craving protein.  i bought hummus, i eyed the tofu, i thought of peanut butter.  lots of fresh stuff was on sale so i loaded down my little red plastic shopping basket.  sweet potatoes, bosc pears, granny smith apples, grape tomatoes, tangerines, Mmm..  am gonna go roast some vegetables in the oven.  kinda late but i've not eaten and..such is life.    the 17 yr. old checkout boy at the store referred to me as ma'am as he scanned my coupons and asked me what kind of pears those were.  "Bosc pears, on sale.."  him:  "no, (eyeing the picture display on his register)  those look more orange than yours are...those aren't Bosc pears."  me:  "yes.  bosc."  ma'am?  what?  stop it.    a 9 yr. old thinks i'm cute and is  barely  a head shorter than me.  have gotten to talk to lindsay more lately...feels good.  have been walking lots.  Yay.     the kids at work like to play fun guessing games and take a chance at my age.  somehow i always end up around 34 yrs. old.  ma'am?  what?  stop it.  what's with the age theme i've got going today?    i'd rather be writing about sex.  or at least talking about it..  or having it?  Mmm..  roasted vegetables.  ma'am?  what?  stop it!

      the morning went something like this.   4:15 am  - awake and hating it, doze for a bit.   4:30 am  - am awake, cannot deny it...still refuse to get up and pretend to doze for awhile longer.   5:00 am  - realize there's no use lying in bed feeling ick so i get up, wash my face, brush my teeth, email lindsay.  good start.  somewhere along the way decide a morning walk sounds lovely.  get dressed, stretch, then press play on my answering machine to listen to the ultimate motivation..  lindsay's voice.   5:20 am  - tug a hoody over my head as i bounce downstairs and out the door.   5:21 am  - am greeted by a fog of my own breath as i realize it's 30 degrees out.  begin my trek.   5:30 am  - rivaling the greatest mall-walkers of our time.   5:50 am  - kickin' ass.  takin' names.   6:00 am  - realize my hands & arms that were swinging madly in traditional mall-walker fashion, flinging away calories are now clutching one another in the front pocket of my hoody.  brr!!  decide to do a few laps of the cemetery...wonder whether that's creepy as it's still dark then remember i'm a badassmuthafucka.   6:08 am  - greeted by  The Hill .  begin the journey up and whisper..  "you will submit."  *smirk*   6:10 am  - hill begs for mercy as  I  smack it around and dominate.     6:17 am  - notice that when including a large hill in one's route...after making the journey up...the journey goes down on the way home.  smile at the fact that i collared hill and made it my bitch.   6:25 am - reach the corner of Reed & Moss.  formerly my 2 mile marker but because i included lots of extra today, think to myself that this corner has to be at least the 3 mile marker today.  *cue Rocky's 'Eye of the Tiger'*   6:30 am - pick up the pace cuz the sweat on my back is forming frosty and lovely ice crystal patterns.   6:35 am  - smile at the sight of my house at the top of the hill.   6:40 am  - bounce back up the stairs.   7:00 am  - am blogging and running late for work now.  by the way, you M-F/9-5 types..  why the hell are you up and doing stuff at 5 am on a Saturday morning?  c'mon!  sleep in a little or something.  feeling good..  did at least 4 miles this morning.  what?  you did 7?  you ran 8?  spent 3 hours at the gym?  well fuck you.  i feel great so..  lick my ass.  hittin' the shower, coach.

      it's far from raining today...feeling more alive than i have in months.  i walked all over today.  i took a long shower, used new shampoo & conditioner that smells soooo fresh and wonderful then got dressed, put on my sandals and was out the door.  went to the bookstore and got a couple of used books.  (more on those later)  ate some lunch when i got home.  hafta say...grape tomatoes are both cute and delicious.  (like me)  heh.  i will share if you'd like.  the weather is again, much warmer than is normal for this time of year.  62 degrees currently.    lindsay should get my letters today.    hm.  i think i'm gonna head back outside.  enjoy the day.

      sometime after lindsay and i had first started talking i told him one day in the course of conversation that i have 2 tattoos.  one is a blue sun on the top of my right foot and the other is a red moon and some stars on my left foot.  it was awhile later (months) that lindsay revealed something to me as well.  i already knew he had tattoos but there were 2 i didn't know about.  1 is a sun and 1 is a moon...  1 on each upper arm.  hm.   crazy.

      today is a good day!  why?  because i said so!  being sad and moping around sure gets me nowhere so..  today is lovely!  i'm off work today and plan to make the most of it.  because my days off are not consistent...it's best to use them wisely.  i got up this morning and checked email..wrote down some things for lindsay and made coffee.  it's absolutely beautiful outside and warmer than usual so i pulled up the shades and pushed open the windows.  had some coffee (with chocolate & raspberry no doubt.  Mmm..) then let myself watch TV for a bit.  i can go weeks without turning my television on..just doesn't interest me much.  if i had one channel of documentaries 24/7, i'd be happy but 'alas..  i'm cable-free.    i made a list for the day.  I love lists.  i've allotted an hour (now) to read/write and email some friends.  i read a book some intermittently while watching TV.  it's the book i was reading in bed last nite as well.  It's called..   The Pig Who Sang to the Moon:  The Emotional World of Farm Animals .  it's a book lindsay told me of and i purchased it for myself at christmas.  (definitely recommend the book)  my life is becoming healthier.  feeding my body, mind and spirit in a more healthy fashion.  also, mind and spirit are somewhat starved so i've been supplying them with more nutrition.  books, newspapers (sunday paper included), lindsay, people around me and blogs too are aiding in this.  my life could potentially see some very large changes within a month or two.  i want to be my best.  lucky for me...lindsay pushes me to be a better person constantly.  this is not to say that he finds me to be a bad person now....but he has a lovely way of always encouraging me to better myself..  to learn more, be more, love more, unfold more..    so, to wrap up the first topic..  i'm getting my hair cut today, have 2 loads of laundry to do...have set aside 2 hours for cleaning and organizing (from 12-2 pm), mailed a letter to lindsay and have yoga planned for the evening.  i paid bills last nite and shoved some money into the ol' savings account.  (I'm planning a trip...)    for some reason i felt obligated to tie that up...  Now, back to the topic of becoming healthier.  fresh foods, lots of water.  i have some turkey in the fridge but don't plan on eating meat really.  i made pad thai again last nite with tofu and lots of fresh bean sprouts.  as for me.  who i am..  let me disclose something.  i have a problem with honesty.  lindsay quickly discovered this.  i won't go too deep here.  as a child i lived in a strict house.  i'm an only-child and therefore my parents had all their energy to focus on me and what i was doing.  they very often disapproved of what i was doing so i learned to do things without them knowing.  now, don't take this too far..  i was a really good kid.  i didn't mess around with drugs or alcohol...got really good grades, 4.0 GPA, friends, worked all the time, just...was a pretty good kid all around..  however, i found myself in trouble with my parents more than those kids that were getting expelled from school on a regular basis.  i was constantly "grounded" from the phone, the car, etc.  i just set up this system of lying about...well..everything really.  i don't know how to explain.  it doesn't seem to make much sense cuz i really wasn't doing anything wrong.  anyway, went to college...remained very secretive.  in highschool my parents were very very adamant that i not be interested in guys...to focus on school..  in college....my parents were very very adamant that i not be interested in guys...to focus on school.  soooooo....if i was interested in someone or even seeing someone...i wouldn't tell them.  this pattern has grown like a tumor and has tentacles grasping most areas of my life.  with friends, with family...i'm just not honest.  i don't tell people how i'm feeling, what i'm doing..etc.  the relationship is always very sufacey.  i guess i don't need to explain much more but i want to say that i'm working to be more honest..  i'll be 25 this year and i am always eager to make my parents proud.  i feel like if they knew me 100% there's a good chance they'd be very disappointed in me or like me less.  i realize they will always always love me..  i don't doubt that..  but that's their job.  they're my parents and they're supposed to love me.  i guess i can't live my life to please my parents but that's kind of what i've done.  those things i've done that i knew wouldn't really please them have remained secret.  some of these things are small...some of them are large.  one of the major drawbacks of not being honest is that there have been times when something rather big has happened that is heartbreaking and all the while i keep smiling because i don't want my parents to know that i'm just average and mess up too...though i am pretty sure they suspect this already.  heh.  so i'm trying....and struggling.     this is what's in my ears this morning:  "boy, know your place...lies do not become us. real is more attractive than a slick a polished mask. girl, dig down deep.  i know there's more between us. there's bound to be a question, you're just dying for me to ask. if you can be honest..  i can be too. if you'll take the first step...i'll follow you through... where no one wants to bleed. no one wants to hide... no one wants to hurts...alone inside.  child, don't close your eyes. the truth contains much beauty. and though it scars your soul..it can heal the wounds it makes. you've been deceived to think...the pain is to be dreaded. and you've got nothing left..that'll give more than it takes.  if you can be honest...i can be too.....  if you can't find the peace..  i'll help find it for you. i don't know how.  but one thing that's sure...is I won't leave You now . if you can be honest...i can be True. if you'll take the first step..  i'll follow you through."  (kendal payne)  that is all for now. enjoy this day.  breathe deep. drink a sunset tonight.

      i watched that movie last nite..   urlLink in the cut .  i think i liked it, even though it wasn't really what i expected.  by expected i mean it wasn't what i thought i had read on the back of the box just moments before pushing play.  someone else had the movie and i watched it too.  i hated meg ryan's hair.  i'm certainly not one to criticize others' hair or whatever (this feels strange) but anyway, she had darker hair and bangs and while i don't mind change (i LOVE it), it was very awkward.  i constantly wanted to reach up and brush it outta her face.  anyway, i won't give a big movie review but it's about a passionate woman in manhattan and it made me think of a woman or 2 i have listed over there.   >>>>>  meg ryan was constantly soaking up words and phrases around her and i think i do the same..whether consciously or not.  there was one she wrote down and now i'm annoyed that i don't remember it.  it said something about a mouth ..buried under a thicket of kisses.  argh.  i'll find it.  it was lovely.    on another note..  can i just tell you how much i LOVE paper & ink letters.  wow.  it's soo so nice.  lindsay has been jotting down random bits from his days and then mailing a little lump of them.  getting real letters in the mail is truly a wonderful thing, folks and i encourage you to write someone.  pick an ink pen you love or a crayon or a big fat marker..  rip some paper, find some that's lovely or just some plain ol' notebook paper.  it will mean a lot to someone.  i've found that if i send that person a "self-addressed stamped envelope" it makes it a lot easier for them to return the favor and also nudges them to do so.  (is that tacky?)  i don't care.  i like it.    i was so excited to see that lindsay posted on here.  i almost don't want to post anything because i like his entry perched there at the top.  Hm..  i think i will wait to post this.  hope you're having a nice sunday.

      Ahh.  good evening.  i'm not even gonna mention..  youknow.  instead i am going to write about the bowl i painted.  it's called "peasantware" and it's delightfully imperfect (like me!).  i painted it a week ago and it was ready to pick up today but that didn't happen.  the colors are "pea soup, mocha and pumpkin."  do you wish i had painted you one?  well..  i didn't.     this is the part where i pause to listen to the audlink that the lovelies over at  urlLink sweetness follows  posted.  Hm.. Happy Youknow and stuff.  michelle has a really fun giggle.    when i talked to lindsay tonight he mentioned some dirty things and it made me squirm.  he's at a friend's for the moment and i keep imagining us sneaking around at his place.  lindsay said i could get all wet and ready then behind his friend's house he'd shove me against the wall, get behind me and fuck me.  afterwards he'd let me kneel and lean back against the wall while he fucked my mouth.  i have to admit i've been a bit obsessive about his ass lately.  he doesn't mind.   =o)    it's a beautiful picture to see him face down on the bed...waiting..  i can crawl up between his legs and hungrily push my face into him.  wait until he's ready and swallow his cum..a finger remaining deep in his ass.  he'll cum inside me then we'll both watch it leaking out from my cunt.  he'll lick the wetness..  my cum, his cum...so messy.  i need him.  i love him.  fare thee well..

      well happy fuckin' day.  heh.  today was long.  i'll not gripe but i will say that i miss lindsay.  i've become paranoid.  maybe for good reason?  help me out here.  i was reading  urlLink this  from danor and suddenly i re-examined my blog and said... fuck, is that me?  that's not me...i don't do that.  no, maybe i do..  i keep talking about lindsay but he hasn't posted for a long time.  he hasn't chosen to be absent but he is...physically..  Hm.  is that me, folks?  god, i hope not.  ack.  danor, is it me?!!  i'm guessing neither she nor kam are such regular readers of my blog that i'd get mentioned like that....but nonetheless i've become paranoid and i'm rambling on and on about the same topic.  before i bid you farewell for the day....   someone said to me today, "hey..happy VD."  i responded instantly with..  "FUCK VD!"  heh.  so, officially..  FUCK VALENTINE'S DAY and gee,  V enereal  D iseases for all..  Cheers!

      munching on kumquats again.  Yum.  they're refreshing. the taxes are officially mailed and e-filed.  found out i've been paying this city earnings tax i don't have to be paying so i get that refunded.  yay!    last nite i got to talk to lindsay for longer than we have in awhile.  it was so so nice.  i had been sleeping for a bit when he called so i had to shake off the sleepiness before conversation was really possible.  he has the most perfect voice.  heh.  it makes me smile lots.    *insert long, drawn out pause of silence and aimee's absence*  wow.  soooo, i heard a lot of screaming downstairs and decided to go investigate.  one of my residents was in a panic and screaming because her little girl had locked her 1 yr. old in the bedroom alone by accident.  so, on one side of the door stood 1 yr. old baby screaming, terrified....on the other side of the door stood mom..screaming, terrified.  the door's pretty torn up now cuz mom had freaked out and tried kicking the door in....but we finally got it open.  mom was scared cuz her curling iron was on in the bedroom where the baby was locked.  eek!  phew.    anyway..  that's all taken care of now and i think everyone has calmed down.  hm.  my brain just took a break.  to be continued...

      i was on my hands and knees when he called.  i had just broken this little amber colored candle holder on the bathroom floor.  my cell phone was lying on the kitchen counter but suddenly i heard his voice on my answering machine.  i scrambled.  i cut my fingers and my foot as well.  ick.  ahh well.  it was worth it.  my cuts didn't wanna stop bleeding and i don't own Band-aids.  heh.  i was so excited to talk to him.  a flood came over me and i cried.  i didn't mean to.  hearing me cry is the last thing he needs but oh my goodness i miss him and hearing his voice is such a warm, crashing relief.    i've been cleaning all day.  happy about the progress i've made thus far.  i took a break late this afternoon and made some pad thai.  fresh bean sprouts, lots of lime & cilantro (my favorites) and firm rice noodles.  i ate the noodles with chopsticks.  my whole day/week is better now that i've gotten to talk to him.  my well-being certainly does not depend on him but he's such a welcome addition.    have you ever eaten a  urlLink kumquat ?  they're such a strange little quirky fruit and i love them!  i bought a little box of them yesterday.  they were a little on the pricey side but such a treat!!  if you've never eaten one, the middle is citrusy-flesh while the rind is the sweetest part.  the only way to eat one is to pop the entire thing into your mouth and chomp.  Mmm..  delectable!  at one point in lindsay and i's relationship in a time of obeying...(i'm not sure how to explain?)  i was eating only fresh foods per his request.  the only things i consumed that were not raw were fruit/vegetable juices.  it was tough and i'm not sure when/how that stopped but it did.  i loved the way it made me feel.  it takes a bit for your body to adjust and it's not a way to live..forever (for me)..but it's nice.  i love being able to just rip something or peel it..tear into it and eat it.  *grin*  anyway, lindsay was telling me on the phone today about a friend of his.  this man is overweight and eats nothing raw or fresh.  the thought sounded gross and while i consider myself one to eat a balanced diet....lots of fresh stuff, tons of water, etc...  i'd like to go back to what we were doing.  i want to do nothing but fresh for awhile.  not starting today and not going to say "i'll start monday" or whatever...but soon i'd like to go back to that.    was going to drive an hour or so to visit a friend this evening but i don't think that's going to happen.  i've got lots to finish here and i've just sort of hit that really good groove where i'm working...(obviously taking a break at the moment).  going to read some then turn the music up and get back to work.  i might have more to say later tonight.   visit  urlLink mr snaffleburger ..  it'll make you smile.    =o))    oh..  and..  experience  urlLink Zen .  heh.

      i pushed his knees up then shoved his legs back.  i was eager..  so eager.  i couldn't wait to taste him.  he was spread open, exposed...waiting..  he was a little taken aback by the aggressiveness displayed..  there was no hesitation and i began licking.  i could see the large tattoo on his lower back as he silently lifted some for me...  i licked and suckled at his perfect asshole.  i couldn't get enough.  i had waited so long.  my fingers pulled and opened him....tongue fucking him then softly licking...teeth nipping at his skin...  i blushed some at the wet noises my mouth made on him.  everything was slippery wet and glistening when i started pushing in a finger.  at first thought i'd tease with my fingertip but that wasn't enough...i shoved it in and didn't give him much time to think before shoving in another.  my fingers were greedily fucking his asshole while my tongue continued licking...that was when our eyes met.  amidst the slight roughness and greedy, dirty thoughts...our eyes said nothing but pure love.  i had to remind myself that he is mine and that he wants me as his.  the thought drove me forward in a frenzy...he spoke low to me and i whispered back..   "dirty." this happened earlier this evening in my mind when i fucked myself for him.  in my head & heart he was my only thought but i did come....so very hard.  afterwards i fell dead asleep for hours..  so much for a cat nap.

      i know it's only been a day but i had really hoped for some responses on the topic.  instead people mainly wanted to know why the hell i was asking that question...  at this point...the answer to that isn't completely pertinent...but i seriously would like at least 75 more answers.  i got a couple from  urlLink masterorator  and the plan for some from  urlLink resident jason .  hook me up, kids.    on a different note..  missing lindsay immensely...keeping afloat in the fact that i desire doing things i know would make him proud or happy.  those things are always good for me and make myself proud as well.  he pushes me to grow and learn and i love that.  so, while he's fairly absent i've been trying to surround myself and stay really busy with lots of those things.  i love the way they keep him nestled in my brain and i like the outcomes they bring.  i hope your friday was lovely.  mine was busy and i work tomorrow and sunday.  ick.  load me up with email and comments and stuff, k?

      it's my day off so i slept in.  i got to talk to lindsay for a couple minutes yesterday morning and not since.  it's been a very long time since we've gone this long without talking to one another.  24 hrs.  ok..not really a big deal...just feels that way when used to talking so often.  snowed a lot here last nite and it's snowing hard still.  i pulled the window shade up next to my bed this morning and felt like a little kid realizing school was cancelled today because of the snow.  more snow as the day goes on, tonight and tomorrow.  just made coffee.  moving slow this morning..reading things i enjoy.  since it's my day off i need to be super productive today.  i HAVE to clean.  ick.  school closings running across the bottom of the screen.  i'm very new to the "blog" scene, heh, and read  urlLink this  last nite.  i saw it linked on twiddly bits and it was intriguing to me..  some "rules" to having a blog or perhaps rules to having a blog and not being obnoxious with it?   i'm not following the "stick to one topic" rule.  heh.  oh well!  i like my jumpy brain.  keep me accountable for this cleaning thing, k?  i really don't wanna do it today...my day off!! i wanna hang around and relax.  'alas..such is life.  nobody else to get it done but me.  i like living alone, though.  it's nice.  it has had a few adverse effects on me...  living alone paired with what my ex-boyfriend was like has made me fairly anti-social.  i have a cat.  i do not, however, own an extensive collection of meg ryan movies, ok?!  i do have a lot of plants, though.    hm.  topic jump!!  woo hoo!! what should i do?  I want a new job.  i have my B.A., studied electronic media in college...did audio production.  since college i've been working as a social worker.  i want a new job but i'm not sure what i want to do and while my job is ick...it'll be hard to match some of the benefits i have.  (would be nice to get the opportunity to use some of those benefits now and again)  hm.  this blog is weird.  when it first started it was going to be something for lindsay and i...about us, about things we did...about things we want to do but he's not in a place to add a lot to this right now so it's become mainly about me and every-day happenings.  ha.  drink it up!   can i get you some coffee?  i like mine with a bit of raspberry chocolate in it. * snow *

      linking more.  find people from people and linking.  i know i'm not the first to discover such juicy bits to be devoured but i appreciate them all the same, k?  new stuff over there.  >>  *pause*  he called twice.  he called twice with a shitty phone card from shitty pay phones and i missed both calls.  thus..  i feel shitty.  was working Job #2 tonight, arms loaded with things, hauling stuff around, watching large fogs of my own breath in front of my face as i panted.  Ugh!  i missed his calls.  he doesn't know why i missed them and i never miss them.  he left sad messages that made me miss him so so much and there's no place for me to call him back cuz he's gone and i missed his calls with the shitty phone card from the shitty phone booths.  i really should look into starting that swear jar.  i dropped an armload of boxes to fish my phone outta my pocket, pushed the 'accept' button as fast as possible and it was TOO LATE!  i'm frustrated and i just want him to know that i missed them unintentionally.  i could hear outside noises on his messages...cars, people...and i don't know where he is.  ahhhh!!!  what a horrible, helpless feeling.  could someone bring him here to me, please?    i'm worn out.  i got quite a bit done today...on this, my day off.  working 2 jobs is ick sometimes and i'm considering a 3rd.  (hey, i have dreams of  urlLink travelling   the world too, ya know?!)  well.  i guess that's all for now.

      ok..  while i'm in contradiction mode...why don't i tell you all about the TV i don't watch that i watched yesterday.  what?  ok, i watched it today too.  but....  folks..  what the hell is  urlLink this ?  heh.  i watched all of that show yesterday and today. it's a bit teletubbie'esque but i somehow became engrossed (like yer average kid, i suppose).  the show contains these 5 flumpy, blumpy, squishy, pillowy, billowy, winky creatures.  they jump and dance and squeak and wiggle around.  lots of pastel technicolor action and kids giggling.  weird.  i had never heard of it before yesterday.  have you heard of it?  have you watched it?  boooooooooooohhhhhbaaaahhhh.

      so...  it's not often i watch TV.  i just..don't like it.  important to note:  i don't have cable/satellite/digital/etc., just the normal local stuff..but anyway..  I say all of that as a prologue to telling what i think one of my favorite commercials is.  No, this is in no way related to Super Bowl Commericals, polls, etc.  But that Imagine commercial...from  urlLink Amnesty International  is nice.  it has all the kids singing Imagine from lennon.  MMm..i love lennon.  *dreamy sigh*  i have to admit..i have a large black & white photo of him as my wallpaper here on the ol' PC and he stares at me.  but yeah, that commercial is really nice (also long).  i've only seen it a couple of times and i think both times it was about 2 am.  i'm wearing a t-shirt i got from the "Freedom 5k" in college.  (yay for free t-shirts.)  it says Amnesty on it.    working on my taxes, i guess.  i can get deductions for student loan interest i've paid.  giddy-up.    nothing too thoughtful today.  trying to keep my mind occupied with run-of-the-mill things...cleaning and such cuz if i sit and think too long i'll be sad.  enough of that topic.  i've noticed that sometimes on younger people's blogs...(i'm a kid myself, i realize)  ...it seems the more sad, depressing, desperate, bitter, etc. they are....the more popular they are.  misery loves company?  i don't know.    i'm hungry.  bye.

      i hope today isn't like the movie.   not a day to re-live over and over.      You always tell me.. That it's impossible.. To be respected....and be a girl.. Why's it gotta be so complicated? Why ya gotta tell me if I'm hated? Oh, please be careful with me.. I'm sensitive and I'd like to stay that way.                                              *  I have this theory.. That if we're told we're bad.. Then that's the only..idea we'll ever have. Maybe if we are surrounded in beauty. Someday we will become what we see. Cuz anyone can start a conflict.... It's harder yet to disregard it.. I'd rather see the world from another angle..  We are everyday angels..  Be careful with me cuz i'd like to stay that way...   damn.  it's february.  has been for a whole day now.  gee.  so, did he see his shadow or what?  happy groundhog day.  your card is in the mail.

      well..  the weather is officially disgusting outside.  i listened to sappy acoustic music all the way to target from work...weeping and feeling like the most insensitive person ever for all of the conflict i stirred up last nite.  the music only made me more sad and i wanted to hear your voice so bad but couldn't bear to try and wake you up 1 minute early.  at target i hoped to purchase an ice scraper, de-icer and maybe something for dinner.  i got outta my truck, wiped my streaked face and began the icy trek inside.  about 60 seconds later i slid and fell so hard on my side on the treacherous sidewalk.  i just wanted to lay there and cry.  my heart was so sad and that seemed like a slap in the face.  blah.  picked myself up off the ground and continued inside..praying i didn't fall again.  roamed target for a bit then began patting myself down looking for my cell phone.  gee..  where's my phone?  where is my fucking phone?!!  ugh.  so..  back outside...there it lay, rainy ice pellets pouring down upon my poor little phone lying on the sidewalk where i had fallen.  UGH!!!  so after a gross drive home, a bruised up side...i have an ice scraper (one of the last, i might add)  ..  i sufficiently salted the porch, all sets of stairs and our sidewalks.  hopefully it'll continue on in this fashion until it's time for me to make the glorious drive back to work.  need to hear your voice...even if only for a moment.  i'm so sorry about last nite.  i love you madly.  aimee.

      remember the show?  the doll?   urlLink jem & the holograms ?  oh, shut up.  you remember it, you watched it...  you owned the doll like me.  she was a mutantly large barbie'esque type doll and she had earrings that lit up.  Yeah.  there was also a saturday morning cartoon.  i dunno which came first.  who cares.  so..  in the middle of locating a website that would remind some of you of Jem, i reminisced.. looking at 80's cartoons, toys, etc.  It made me laugh.  I get annoyed when people get into some conversation like..  "OH MAN!!  REMEMBER THIS??  that wasn't really my goal here.  anyway...  that's all just a pointless aside for what i'm going to write about. i had a mini-breakdown in the 1/4 block distance between my house and sarah's house.  it was dumb and i snapped at lindsay.  things are just piling up and it doesn't take much for me to start turning into crazy aimee.  i'm frustrated with a lot of things goin' on or, eh..  not goin' on.  the camel's back gets loaded quickly so look out 'cause you may be that straw to break it all.  eep.  that was corny.  soooooo.... i spent the evening with sarah.  we ate dinner then hung around a bookstore for a long time.  i bought 2 CD's and a book.  i had told myself i should spend money on something practical like shoes because mine are falling apart.  i'd rather buy music and books over anything on anyday.  truly.  i guess it wasn't wasteful like buying jewelry or something.  to each his own.  so i got this great cd.  it changed my mood 100%.  It's  urlLink Jem .  finally woken.  i love the whimsical, tinkly music that is then attacked by a solid bass beat.  Mm..  delicious.  i realize i'm probably the last one on the scene for this..but i'm happy about the purchase.  i also added Miles Davis', Kind of Blue to the collection.  heh.  good times.  really excited to tackle the book i bought too.  i think it's called Coffee Everywhere.  this post is so scattered.  oh well.  i lit a ton of candles earlier and some incense too.  opium.  i'm gonna go read books and flip through a magazine i've been wanting to look at and...  what else..  i dunno, be inspired, become someone's muse..  discover something amazing i want to do, etc. etc.  come over.  i'll make you tea and we'll figure out how to cure cancer and save the whales..  or, maybe i'll just mail something in and get a new degree in um..  massage therapy or the likes.  turning up the music and grooving.  feels.  so.  good.

      so.  here i am.   not sure where to go from here..  things with lindsay are pretty much back to normal, i guess.  this can be both good and bad.  i wasn't sure whether to come back to this blog..  at least not yet anyway.  i certainly don't want to be one of those on again, off again things..not with lindsay.  his life is crazy now and we try to piece together this thing..  this thing where we love each other and have no idea what tomorrow will bring but continue to be convinced that we should keep holding on.    i don't have the energy to speak on that any longer at the moment.  went to church yesterday.  i work every weekend pretty much so i haven't had the opportunity to go for quite awhile.  yesterday was so good.  my head was swimming afterwards.  i'll touch on this when my brain can see more clearly.  worn out at the moment.  anyway, i kept thinking of my life, of lindsay's...etc.  when i was home i read some blogs and stumbled upon a great entry from a  urlLink blog i read daily .  read that if you want.  i loved what she had to say.  oh hell.  i didn't link the actual entry.  scroll down for now and maybe i'll fix that later.    i bought Nyquil.  it's the cough formula..  (it's new)  my sleep has been less than quality because i cough too much.  i'm hoping i can have deep, dreamy sleep tonight.  nyquil is kinda hardcore for me, though.  i'm not into drugs, kids!  just say no.  or say yes.  whatever you want to do, ok?    quote for the day.  i found this on something at work and scribbled it down.

      yeah.  whatever.  catchy subject line.  i'm actually wearing them right now.  (sidenote:  for $100 you can own my underwear...post-wearing)  what?  if a model on some other  urlLink website  can sell hers...can't i sell mine?  fuck.  even socks.    today is a bit sullen.  a friend is driving up to see me and spend the nite here at my place.  i was anticipating her arrival so i picked up a few things, showered, etc. and she called a bit ago to tell me she won't be here for another 3 hours or so...thus, i'm disappointed.  was thinking maybe i'd go to the store and get some nice stuff for dinner.  i also have 2 free movie passes and i'm cheap as hell so...think we might see a movie.  i guess this is one of the few advantages of working crazy hours and having random days off in the middle of the week.     i've really accomplished nothing today.  i hate how that feels.  if i continue to write this is only going to end dreadfully so...  i'll just end now.  i didn't have much to say anyway..  or maybe it's that i have too much to say.  2 days until his birthday.

      headed to work here soon..  while i consider myself to be writing this blog for lindsay and i... i admit i find it disappointing when i read really neat blogs and see that they have thousand/s of visitors everyday and then note that i've had about 5 in the past 24 hours.  ha.  oh well.    this sick junk is lingering in my body and settling some in my chest.  ick.  it's just when i snuggle down to sleep that the coughing comes at it's worst.  my parents came to my home tonight and then took me out to dinner with them.  both they and myself noticed i was very lacking in the area of balance.  it felt strange.  i had noticed it some earlier in the evening when i stood up quickly.  i thought it was just a head rush but i nearly fell in the shower and later trying to look out the window.  dizzy.  so now my parents have decided i have an  urlLink ear infection .  i don't think their diagnosis is necessarily correct but we did make a stop at the health food store and bought some of those beeswax ear candles...supposed to draw out stuff from within.  whatever.  i dunno if they work.  i want to read some more about them before i try.  i did notice after reading the Kids' Health page linked above...my ears got more achey.  haha.  ahh..the power of suggestion.  anyway..  it's nearly time for me to make the trek to work.  ick.  i did something a bit "sneaky" today.  in the next week or so i'll give you some updates on this.....maybe.  mostly i'll update lindsay.  by the way, beautiful boy...i love you so much.

                                                    i stayed in the shower too long.                                i tried to forget hateful words between us.                                                        i shaved my legs smooth.                    out of the shower i rubbed warm lotion on my skin.                                                                            it was slick.                                   i smeared spicy patchouli oil up my arms                                                                       down my neck.                                                               my hands are shaky.                                                               i'm wet and slippery.                                                             i didn't brush my hair.                                      i dreamt of tasting your sweet mouth.                                                    i selfishly dipped into myself.                                           i offered some up but you refused.                                                            my belly ached for you.                                                                          you were full.                                                                         i was hungry.                                                               i loved you too much                                                                               and again                                                                                            i                                                                                        am                                                                                    alone.                                                                   tell me what to do                                                                         so i can resist                                                                        so i can refuse                                                                             then obey.

      lindsay frustrated with me again. mom called and i didn't want to be sitting on the phone with her. got the sneaky suspicion she didn't want to be sitting on the phone with me either.  i've obviously been doing nothing really but working yet she asked in about 15 different ways what i've been doing lately...who i've seen....where i've been...  at the end of our conversation she hung up before i could say goodbye.  yeah, she didn't want to be on the phone with me.  i don't want to become one of those people that others do not look forward to talking to or hearing from.  i think i am that person for my mom right now.  she dreads talking to me and when we're on the phone fakes enthusiasm.  blech.  off to work soon.

      i'm feeling bratty today.  wishing lindsay would boss me around and want me more than anything.  i hate the whiney nature of the writings here lately.  i emailed lindsay to tell him i was "off to play on the playground of our blog.." then decided to rephrase and admit i was headed here more to throw a temper tantrum.  feel like being mean and giving dirty looks today.  while i am feeling like a snotty, pouty brat..i'd melt and do absolutely anything lindsay wanted from me.  that may not visibly show on the outside but deep within, it would drive me forward to please him.  dark and angry today.  blindfold me.  take advantage of me.    anything i have to do or say or offer...lindsay doesn't need right now.  it's not the right time.  he has other things on his mind.  it's inappropriate.  he's busy.  i'm a..  stupid girl.    someday i'll do the right things at the right time.  today isn't that day.    lindsay's mad at me and for the 'nth day in a row i'm much too emotional.  half of this entry was written prior to talking to him and the 2nd half has been written after.  i feel like an ugly person now.  selfish and mad.  tired.  i'm not what he wants and i don't do things that make him happy.  perpetually frustrated with me.  i'm messy and just continue to screw up.  day after day after day.  don't be sad.  get angry with me.  selfish and demanding today.  bratty.  fuck.

      These are all things i've learned while working in a lockdown facility with juvenile males.  heh.  1.  "badass" boys that will fondly refer to you as a 'bitchass dyke motherfucker' will also enjoy more than anything.. a) dr. seuss books read to them at night before bed.  b)  listening to the Titanic soundtrack while falling asleep.  (equally accepted:  Enya, James Taylor, Sounds of Nature Thunderstorm)  c)  stuffed animals.  d)  hugs.  e)  stuffed animals.  heh.  2.  always wear comfortable shoes that are conducive to running.  3.  always ask why.  4.  be patient.  5.  get uncomfortable.  6.  trust little.  7.  try not to work on ham & bean night.  (this list not exhaustive.)

      i love when mornings start with lindsay.  he's definitely "the best part of wakin' up."  heh.  cheesy.   anyway..  last nite was tons of fun.  the place we went to had 2 levels and we sat on the top level in this perfectly charming, quaint little nook.  we were just over the bar and the band.  yay!!  there was a band!!  it wasn't the b e s t music in the world.  (insert band name here) hahaha.  but it was lots of fun and they were happy to be doing what they were doing.  I previously included the name of the band but they're local and the link to their site stated blaringly where i live and i decided maybe i didn't want to do that.  so i drank a bit and was a lovely degree of intoxicated..  just warm & happy.  wow.  somewhere in the middle of this post everything got halted.  the doorbell rang a bunch so i ran downstairs and nobody was there.  this felt a tad "candid camera'ish" so i walked around the porch looking for anyone.  the porch swing was swinging, but empty.  i felt like a fool as i stood there searching and imagined the culprit watching from afar snickering as i looked for the source of the doorbell ringing.  unfortunately, the source came running back across the street as i stood there freezing....barefoot, watching my own breath..pouring rain, mid 30's.  (what?  i'm just setting the scene for you.  we may even get snow later today.  fuck.)  so, anyway...  said boy had his hat on crooked and tried being funny.  i stared at him.  expressionless.  he asks me if i've ever been to cozumel.  i silently shake my head no.  (I should've said i used to live there or something.)  anyway..  he proceeds at my desired answer and tells me with a sly grin..  "all you have to do is pick out one of these songs and you and i will sing it together at the top of our lungs.  for every 5 people that listen to us....blah blah blah."  more staring. still no expression.  he laughs at his own 'joke' and says, "awww, i'm just kiddin'!!"  yeah.  more staring.  he unfolds his laminated sheet of magazines.  FUCKER!  go peddle your wares elsewhere.  i respond, much too politely, and tell him i've no interest in purchasing any.  i'm freezing and my nipples are in pain and this dumbass thinks i'm game for his shit?  no no.  he tries another route, attempting to heap guilt on me for the fact that i won't even purchase a magazine as a GIFT?  for a good friend???!  that's right. i suck.  i don't buy gifts for friends.  i hate them.  please.  get off my porch.  ain't workin' for me.  on that same topic...  one time...  i was walking across the parking lot of some store.  i waited for cars to pass before i could walk and could hear someone shouting.  i was wearing this silly t-shirt from a play i was in in highschool. this boy was looking very excited and waving to me....i did the typical expressionless stare and he says to me.."HEY!!  i was in that play too!!"  we have some short discussion on the play and the characters we played and he asks me if i wanna sit with him..  (what?)  so, whatever..  i sit on this bench next to him and he chats about random shit.  at some point he gets around to pulling the same stunt on me as above (do i look gullible?) and unfolds his laminated list of magazines.  FUCKER!  i show my disgust and tell him he's a scam artist..  faking enthusiasm and such.  he tries to get me to sign up....i protest much and in the end he begs me for a hug.  ugh.  go away.  3rd time.  i'm in a store i won't mention..looking at candles.  man comes to me..tells me he loves such & such candle...picks up a cd i have in my basket and tells me he's such a fan of that band...then tells me how adorable i look in these little glasses i was wearing.  60 seconds later the man is attempting to sell me certificates to some salon.  FUCKER!  i guess i look easy.  i'm not a pushover, folks.  i don't buy your scams.  don't even try it!!  again..peddle your wares elsewhere!    at least when i came upstairs today from coldass rainy day i was greeted by a clean, warm place that smells like coffee.

      i'm happy to say the cleaning is officially done.  the place looks lovely and feels so so so much more comfortable.  i love clean.  of course the closets and drawers could use a good spring cleaning but that will have to wait until further on...   In Spring.  i discovered a cleaning product i have a love/hate relationship with.  Method's Grapefruit cleaner is delightful.  (used for surfaces, not for grapefruits)  it's a fun grapefruity color and smells sooo fresh and clean.  i love that aspect.  clean, non-chemical smell.  however, it seems to leave a bit of a residue on my countertops and such.  i read closer on the back of the bottle and it contains "coconut oil surfactants."  i'm not sure what those are but coconut oil doesn't exactly seem like a stringent cleanser.  hm.  who knows.  either way, the place is clean and i'm happy in it.    tonight i'm going out.  this is an occasion as it's not often i "go out."  heh.  staci's birthday was this past week as i've mentioned and i was working during prior birthday festivities so today is a belated celebration day.  i want to shower and get ready really slowly.  i plan to drink some tonight - thinking ahead..  i set my alarm clock for tomorrow and sat a bottle of ibuprofen on the counter.  heh.  i wish lindsay was here.    how has everyone else's weekend been?  jason & lane listed on the side are spending today at the beach.   urlLink eden  had four wisdom teeth pulled...(suddenly cleaning all weekend doesn't seem so bad).    s'pose this post may not change your life but happy sunday to you.  sunny, upper 50's here.

      have been cleaning fairly diligently.  i was interrupted by 2 calls from Mom and took a break to do a daily check of blogs i like.  i've lots left to do but i don't plan to stop until it's done so it's ok.  i'll have fresh sheets to sleep in and the hardwood floors will be free of stray, white cat hairs.  i found a little station playing some crazy irish music which definitely served to raise my spirits and get to cleaning.  in the end they were playing Flogging Molly and it was fun.  i'm off to twirl wildly with abandon and clean, clean, clean.  more later..

      ran some errands today with staci.  she had to purchase a wedding gift.  fun times.  anyway..  i came home with pine sol and new scrubby sponges and i'm waaaay excited.  today is the cleaning extravaganza.  i should've done it all week long....that way, this rare chance of having a weekend off could've been spent relaxing instead of working but, 'alas..  those are the decisions i made and now i must live with them!!  heh.  i'm about to put in some great music and let the party begin.  come help if you'd like.

      (minus an exclamation point)  i re-read what i just posted.  it almost feels like a revelation...in a very pathetic way but..  i have nothing to look forward to right now.  that's a pity-party statement but that's how i'm feeling.  i suddenly feel like the trailer for a horrible Lifetime movie.  i'm terribly sad now.  i'm independent...  i don't need anybody here but god i want lindsay here.  i want him close to me so very badly.  i'm tired of watering my plants and coming home to my cat.  feeling bitter and again...pathetic right now.  a zillion people have sung this same sad song before.  i'm no different, i suppose.  the ball is in my court....  it's only me that can make things better.     Her green plastic watering can For her fake Chinese rubber plant In the fake plastic earth That she bought from a rubber man In a town full of rubber plans To get rid of itself  It wears her out’ it wears her out It wears her out’ it wears her out  She lives with a broken man A cracked polystyrene man Who just crumbles and burns He used to do surgery For girls in the eighties But gravity always wins  It wears her out’ it wears her out It wears her out’ it wears her out  She looks like the real thing She tastes like the real thing My fake plastic love But I can’t help the feeling I could blow through the ceiling If I just turn and run  It wears her out’ it wears her out It wears her out’ it wears her out  If I could be who you wanted If I could be who you wanted all the time   worn out, lonely and sad.  suck it up and drive on, aimee.

      going through the motions.  i like living alone..  i do.  i like buying whatever i want at the grocery store.  i enjoy walking around in whatever state of undress that i wish.  i like listening to/watching whatever i want, whenever i want.  However..  i'm developing some very bad habits.  right now things are a mess and i think it comes from some level of "too comfortable."  i don't really have anything keeping me accountable.  this applies in a fairly surfacey level.  for instance..  i've been wanting to do a huge spring clean on my apartment for awhile now and it just hasn't happened.  it's been started over and over but never actually reached a state of completion.  i'm a little embarassed.  my vehicle is also pretty messy right now.  i've fallen behind at my 2nd job.  when i first moved into this place it was always...consistently...spotless.  i LOVE things that way.  organized, ZERO clutter, inviting.  my whole life is cluttered right now.  my main job has no routine about it.  the only thing i can count on is that my schedule will NEVER be the same 2 weeks in a row.  i don't even work the same shift 5 days/wk.  I may work 8-4 pm, 4-12 am or 12-8 am.  Y U C K.  Soo..  i've been hating this for awhile now...that in addition to the fact that i don't want to do what i'm doing.  working with juveniles in a lockdown facility isn't what i wanna do, k?  i don't!  i'm not good at it..i'm no fucking counselor...they literally suck the life from me.  what have i done to solve this problem?  nothing.  absolutely nothing.  i passively look through jobs online and elsewhere but haven't taken it any further.  so i work and work, the days off are sporadic, nothing has a routine.  i long for a routine.  i want to say "every monday i do this."  or "every tuesday and thursday i am taking this class."  blah blah blah.  i want to try to stop putting disclaimers on here but i can't help it.  i hate whiney, complainy shit and i seem to be doing that a lot tonight.  oh well.  i'm venting.  there has to be some release somewhere and lindsay's heard enough about all of it for the moment.    so where am i?  i'm beyond frustrated with myself.  i lack energy and motivation.  i'm constantly worn out and have fallen so behind in things that i struggle to locate a starting point.  and another thing...  i'm kind of tired of living alone.  i don't want a roommate.  i want lindsay.  ick.  that large pool of loneliness just bubbled over.  sadness.  i want a new job.  i want a routine.  i want some time to myself..  i want something to look forward to.  i really want something to look forward to.  right now i only look forward to hearing from lindsay and days off...only my days off are clouded with dread for all those things i haven't accomplished lately that must be accomplished soon.  floundering about...sinking.  where do i begin?  throw me a rope.  drama.  yuck.  i guess i'm feeling sorry for myself tonight.  my social life is non-existent and this comes from a) my schedule that is 100% incompatible with anyone else's and b) my anti-social tendencies.  lonely in a crowd.  people irritate me yet i long for socialness.....companionship?    i like it when lindsay writes on here.  i've strayed away from writing too much about us lately 'cause i dunno what i should write, i guess.  i'm not really sure...it just hasn't felt appropriate...  like maybe i'd write something that would make him feel bad or something 100% sexual in nature that would fall at just the wrong time sooo...  i've just been babbling 'bout junk in my little world.  (though he's a huge part of my world)  i love him so much.  i'm more sure of it all the time.    for now..  Happy Birthday, staci.  this will post on the 12th but it's the end of my day (the 11th).  i hope your birthday was lovely.  you're beautiful and loved.

      ugh.  what is with people? i'm gonna gripe about people griping.  ha. well, actually..  i just don't really understand.  do we write these blogs for ourselves or for the people reading them?  i'm just presently irritated with a blog i read on a regular basis (though not listed at the side) that is arrogant and annoying.  the person seems to only write about what might impress people or perhaps gain their sympathy.  mystery illnesses that plague the writer with intense symptoms...  bah.  i dunno.  this is going nowhere.  i don't HAVE to read the ones that are annoying...hell, mine may be just as annoying.  but someone told me to let this be a playground for my mind and that's what i'm trying to do with it.  there's no planning, no rough drafts...  i just sit down and blather.  i like it that way.   anyway, let's move on.. i worked a long shift today and am feeling guilty because a resident asked me to watch her child in the morning before i go to work and i don't want to.  she doesn't have anybody to watch her and i don't really have any good reason why i can't other than the fact that i was hoping to get some things done here and would like to spend some time talking to lindsay if at all possible before work.  are those valid reasons?  they feel selfish.  i'll decide by the end of this bit whether or not i'm going to do it in the morning.  my cat is sniffing my banana.  hm.  do cats like bananas?  he seems curious but not really interested.    ok.  so i've been sitting on the phone with my friend, tara.  i've known her 17 years.  wow.  anyway..  we talked a long time and i prattled on about my family.  my crazy, closed-minded, smalltown, gossiping, drug-using, entire-town fucking, etc. etc. i'm tired and wanting to type lots but losing steam...  i'll pick this up tomorrow.    is this coherent at all?   g'nite.

      i'm feeling a bit sluggish. ha. ok..that was enough to give me a smirk at least.  heh.  i'm sort of dragging today.  work was long.  i'd like the evening to be long.  i just messed around after work.  i'm home now and am hoping to be fairly productive.   let's see..  some online housekeeping.    Birthdays!  today is  urlLink lane's  birthday.  happy birthday, lane.  deana, friend i grew up with, is having a birthday tomorrow, march 10.  staci, my very good friend in the regular day to day life out in the wide world is having a birthday in 2 days...march 11.  march 17 is st. patrick's birthday.  (well, not really..but you know) and, my darling boy,  lindsay  will be having a birthday in 16 days, on  march 25 .  i'm still working on some fun way to countdown the days until lindsay's birthday.  i want it to be a birthday that stands out somehow in the years to come.  i don't have lots of money to buy him wonderful gifts so my gifts will have to truly come from my hands and my heart.  thankfully i fell for a boy that could care less about material things.  i'd still like to write a little something about the time spent with my family.  we had an "incident" at the funeral and it seems blog-worthy.  of course my standards for blog-worthy things are a bit loose.   Oasis - Wonderwall is playing.  ha.  nice.  last nite i found an old planner from my junior year in college.  wow.  it was strange to read.  things i was working on..stresses, former boyfriend, jobs, friends..just strange.  not a big deal.  no solid topic today..  jumpy again.  is it getting better..  or do you feel the same...?  will it make it easier on you now..you got someone to blame.    ....  one love..we get to share it..   did i disappoint you..or leave a bad taste in your mouth?  you act like you never had love and you want me to go without.    i'm a procrastinator lately.  i'd put my "To-Do" list on here so that it could stare me in the face each day and motivate me but i think i'm a little embarassed at my level of procrastination.  i justify it by working a lot..too much.  all the things that fall into that other space of my life get pushed to the back.  i get worn out and when a day off comes i'm selfish with the time.  it is a lovely feeling to be super productive and then look back and sigh at accomplishment.    i meant to buy some frozen fruit today.  i forgot.  i bought some organic vanilla yogurt and was wishing i had a blender so i could dump in some frozen fruit and make something yum.    i sat down and got comfortable and now all the things i need to do seem daunting.  should i get some rest tonight and rise early to do them tomorrow or should i stay up late tonight working then sleep in a bit in the morning?  i work 10 hours tomorrow but i don't have to be there until 2 pm.  Hmmm..  decisions decisions.  if i sit for a moment and let my mind wander i just get overwhelmed with all the stuff i've been intending to do..  the more broad things like..make a list of books i want to read.  i need to just work on this constantly instead of just sitting down to make a list...just add stuff whenever it comes to mind.    i need new shoes.  my tennis shoes are old.  i'm ok with old but the holes that readily allow water to spill in are just not workin' for me.  forrest gump moment.  those look like comfortable shoes..    be productive.

      my great-uncle bob died.  yesterday i rode with my mom 3 hours after work to where my grandparents live.  it's another world there..  it's not just the town...but the people, my grandparents' home.  it's hard to explain.  i sat down and tried to settle my mind to write about the past day or two but now i'm not sure i have the energy or "focus" to do so.  i'll be back to write more later or tomorrow.

      goood evening.  wow.  drencher out there.  has been raining very steadily since sometime last nite and weather person says no stopping 'til tomorrow.  a few inches at least, water over the roads in some places.  i noted elsewhere that this is not due to poor drainage, etc. but the water is just that high.  and now, an aside..  i do not talk about weather for filler..  just like i don't type song lyrics for filler.  it's all very intentional.  i love talking about the weather and should you choose to engage me in such a conversation i will be genuinely interested.  seriously.  the weather is important, folks.  what's the weather like where you are right now?  tell me.  i want to know.

      when i was 6 or 7 we made rare trips to my grandparents' house.  (we put the  fun  in dysfunctional)  my cousin, around 3 months younger than myself, lived with my grandparents.  whenever we played...she kept the best of everything for herself.  she loved everything pink, purple, shimmery, while i got the yellows, blues and uglies.  i didn't mind...i liked those.  anyway, fast-forward through unnecessary details.  my grandparents had a "den" of sorts.  it had dark wood paneling on the walls and an uninviting leather couch.  we played in that room a lot.  we danced and listened to neil diamond over and over and over.  neil diamond.  my brain is jumpy and moody lately.  (this is new?)  recalling someone else's memory.  a friend of mine told me long ago a funny and sad story.  it demonstrates a lot about people in general.  it was 6th grade and the music teacher had asked everyone to bring in a tape of music they liked.  he, being beautifully oblivious, did just that!  he brought in an old johnny horton tape that he loved!  smart was this boy...in love with history.  he was pleased, of course, when it was his turn to have his tape shared with and listened to by the entire class.  the music began and the rest of the class turned in disgust to look at him.  how completely uncool of him.  he said his "social status" was gone from that day forward.  i love the fact that he had no idea the other kids would react in that manner.  i hate the fact that they did.  it's crazy that something so trivial now had such an impact then.  kids are so mean.  hurtful.  grr.    at work recently one of my kids gave a little spiel.  he's a tad slow mentally and can be a huge pain in the ass but when he wants to...he tries sooo hard.  we were all sitting together talking (10 boys, 2 staff) and he wanted to be encouraging to some of the other boys.  he started pointing out things he thought some of them were good at and was talking about what they could become in the future.  for a couple of them he mentioned a sport they were good at or said they may become famous rappers, etc.  he was nearing the end and seemed to be saving "the best" for last.  he was thinking big...amazing things and said, "you know what?  you could even be Popular!"  maybe we could push kids to aspire to be more than just popular?  the topic continues...  my cousin and her husband have 2 children.  they're adorable, funny kids.  the youngest is going to be 3 soon.  she was born with 6 fingers on each hand.  a lot of times when this happens there is no bone in the extra finger and newborn babies will merely have the finger banded and it will fall off, not even leaving a scar..  however, my cousin's daughter has perfectly formed extra index fingers.  they have the bones and go all the way up into her wrist like a normal finger.  she had extra toes as well but those were removed.  anyway, we're all very used to it and i don't even notice.  in fact, it's hard to notice unless you stop and stare for a moment.  this winter she wanted gloves like her big brother but only had mittens.  my cousin's friend knitted her 2 pairs of gloves....each with 6 fingers.  she was delighted!  she was sooo excited.  she put on her new gloves and said in her tiny voice...  "I have 6 fingers."  hard to convey in typing but imagine a proud little one, saying something in a very haha manner...  like, haha!!  i have this and you don't!!  she knows it's different but doesn't know it's viewed as strange.  when she's old enough to go to school i'd like to personally harm the first little kid to be mean to her.  she, like my friend, is beautifully oblivious.  it sounds almost silly for me to say but man, why do people have to be so mean to one another?  she will go to school proud and someone will, guaranteed, shock her with their disapproval of her difference.  grr again!    To the rest of you, who have been beautifully oblivious before....  i dedicate this johnny horton (cover) song...to YOU.  The Battle of New Orleans  In 1814 we took a little trip along with Colonel Jackson down the mighty Mississip. We took a little bacon and we took a little beans And we caught the bloody British in the town of New Orleans.  We fired our guns and the British kept a'comin. There wasn't nigh as many as there was a while ago. We fired once more and they began to runnin' on down the Mississippi to the Gulf of Mexico.  We looked down the river and we seen the British come. And there must have been a hundred of'em beatin' on the drum. They stepped so high and they made the bugles ring. We stood by our cotton bales and didn't say a thing.  We fired our guns and the British kept a'comin. There wasn't nigh as many as there was a while ago. We fired once more and they began to runnin' on down the Mississippi to the Gulf of Mexico.  Old Hickory said we could take 'em by surprise If we didn't fire our muskets til we looked 'em in the eyes We held our fire til we seen their faces well. then we opened up with squirrel guns and really gave 'em..well.  We fired our guns and the British kept a'comin. There wasn't nigh as many as there was a while ago. We fired once more and they began to runnin' on down the Mississippi to the Gulf of Mexico.  Yeah, they ran through the briars and they ran through the brambles And they ran through the bushes where a rabbit couldn't go. They ran so fast that the hounds couldn't catch 'em on down the Mississippi to the Gulf of Mexico.  We fired our cannon til the barrel melted down. So we grabbed an alligator and we fought another round. We filled his head with cannon balls and powdered his behind and when we touched the powder off, the gator lost his mind.  We fired our guns and the British kept a'comin. There wasn't nigh as many as there was a while ago. We fired once more and they began to runnin' on down the Mississippi to the Gulf of Mexico.  Yeah, they ran through the briars and they ran through the brambles and they ran through the bushes where a rabbit couldn't go. they ran so fast that the hounds couldn't catch 'em on down the Mississippi to the Gulf of Mexico.  Hup 2, 3, 4. Sound off 3, 4.... Hup 2, 3, 4. Sound off 3, 4.... Hup 2, 3, 4   * today's post was a bit long...  i hope you were able to stay tuned until the very end.

      i decided to title last today.  we'll see what happens with that.  i had an english teacher that would have us write a paper or essay or whatever then pull the title from within the paper.  i'm listening to some old ben harper.  i don't always realize how much my mood, well being, days, etc. revolve around what music i'm currently listening to.    not talkin' bout a year.  no not 3 or 4. i don't want that kind of forever in my life anymore. forever always seems to be wrong when it begins. but forever never seems to be wrong when it ends. so give me your forever. please, your forever. not a day less will do. from you.    people spend so much time...every single day. runnin' round all over town givin their forever away. but no not me, i won't let my forever roam. now i hope i can find my forever a home. so give me your forever. please, your forever. not a day less will do. from you.  like a handless clock with numbers. an infinite of time. no not for forever found only in the mind. forever always seems to be wrong when things begin. but forever never seems to be wrong when things end. so give me your forever. please your forever. not a day less will do. from you.   recorded on this perfectly charming cobalt blue cassette tape.  i love that color.  i like that it's a less-than-perfect recording on an old cassette.  i kept thinking i'd stop typing those lyrics but i just kept wanting them all here.  please don't think i type such as filler.  i wanted every single lyric there. feeling mellow.  acoustic.  frustrated.  was reading another blog.  i'll not say who it belongs to...but man.  ungrateful.  people are ungrateful.  it hurts my heart.  i work with kids....adolescent boys..  they can demonstrate ungrateful with ease.  seems i've stumbled upon lots of ungrateful people and...i can be the same.  i wasn't raised in a family that had money falling out of their pockets.  my parents didn't mind saying 'no' and..  i'm glad.  i'm  grateful .  i work with homeless people at my other job and they are shockingly, disgustingly ungrateful sometimes.  can make for a bitter girl.    i bought a joe cocker cd yesterday.  i like it.  i played it loud on the way to work today.  i'm off tomorrow..  (mostly)  with the exception of a staff meeting.  i plan to sleep in.  i'm considering a really long bath before bed but i'm not sure it'd be worth the hassle.  tired.  typing..stream of consciousness.  someone left a comment today.  nobody leaves comments and i like comments.  oh go ahead, aimee..  say comments again.  COMMENTS.  heavy eyelids.    i got some money back from taxes so i kind of splurged.  perhaps this is why i got on the minor ungrateful rant.  i don't purchase things for myself often.  i just....  don't.  but i saw this tiny bottle of eau de toilette that i love and decided to get it.  it's small and ok, it was $9.99.  i felt a bit guilty for buying it...but after i showered today i happily put some on my skin and it's WONDERFUL.  my boys at work sniffed me strangely.  i don't usually show up smelling girly.  i'm more of a warm, earthy type of girl.  but this is fresh and smells of bergamot, waterlotus and quince.  hehe.  quince.  when i was little i had a baby lamb named Quincy.  i've been here for awhile now.  writing slowly.  spent a lot of time reading other things tonight.  i didn't realize it had gotten so late.  i got completely absorbed into the archives of someone's blog.  the archives that went back 3 years or so.  it also triggered the minor ungrateful rant.  i own one of the first "office type chairs" ever created.  it's metal and i just realized i'm too tired to describe it.  probably from...i dunno, the 50's?  not sure.  point is..  it's uncomfortable after awhile and i'm done sitting in it.  goodnight, good morning..  whatever it is when you read this.  have a happy day today.  listen to music you love.  if it's warm enough where you live (it won't be where i live) roll down your windows..let your hair get mussed up.  'cause...  oh no, here comes that sun again. that means another day without you, my friend. and it  hurts me to look into the mirror at myself. and it hurts even more to have to be with somebody else. and it's..so hard to do and so easy to say. but sometimes..sometimes you just have to walk away..walk away. so many people to love in our life. why do i worry about one?  but you put the happy..in my ness . you put the good times into my fun. and it's so hard to do and so easy to say. but sometimes..sometimes you just have to walk away..walk away. and head for the door.     (i didn't intend to end on a sad note really..i didn't mean anything secretive by it..  i just love the song. i bolded the line i love the most and i'm sending it in a little, perfectly wrapped package to lindsay.  love you.)

      i should be in bed.  it's not late but i have to get up early.  this fact has made me bitter.  today was my day off and i feel like it didn't even belong to me.  other people took little pieces of it and now it's gone.  tomorrow i'll get up at 5 am, work job #2 for 8 hours or so, have a couple hours then work job #1 for 8 hours.  *gripe gripe*    i've become something i hate.  there are parts of me that i adore.  something about me has changed significantly in the past year...  but the majority of me has become something i hate.    i don't feel or look healthy. i've become disorganized and my brain is scattered. i forget everything.  no, really.  like an old woman. i speak hatefully and out of anger.  regret almost always follows close behind and i'm generally quick to apologize but i cringe at the way i can be.  my words can be so sour and hot with rage. i say hurtful things. i walk around looking cold and being alone. i stare rudely and glare at people. am unhappy with my main job yet stay there.   i suck at time management. i never return phone calls. i spend hardly any time at all with my family. my apartment used to alwayyyysss be spotless.  not now. i've lost some, uh..  passion?  drive? i complain waaay too much. what's my deal? there's no magic cure for this.   the makers of many meds would like for me to believe differently but i am convinced it's only me that can make any of this better.  but how?  where do i begin?  i'm one giant mood swing and it's ugly.  lindsay can attest to this.  staci can attest to this.  help me just a little bit to get started?  a gentle nudge in the right direction?  feeling exhausted and lethargic.  i want to feel fresh and ready to take on the world.  i want to feel motivated, healthy, bright-eyed and happy.    happy..

      ok, so i was/am feeling just a tinge guilty about buying a few things i really could live without...HOWEVER!!!  i wanted this loaf of organic bread from the bakery.  it's crusty and smelled so good and fresh.  it was more expensive than i wanted to pay for it but....i got it anyway.  (as is the theme for the day.)  when i was in the checkout lane it wouldn't ring up.  the woman asked me if i knew how much it was....i said i didn't.  she didn't feel like looking so she rang it up for $1.00.  score.

      ick.  i'm a bit embarassed.  i went um..  shopping today.  shopping's not me.  it's just not.  i wanted some good soap and the type i wanted i've only seen at one place before.  it's Bee & Flower soap.  Mmm..  earthy, warm & sweet (again..like me!)  anyway, i'm sure that can be located online somewhere..i'm not trying to be free advertising.  afterwards i went to target because i did truly need a few things.  i seriously went down every single aisle.  i spent too much money.  got a great frame for super cheap off the clearance shelf..bought some girly stuff which, again...isn't me.  i eyed a pink & green rug.  eep!!  got a larger bag of jasmine rice because i'm officially a fan and i paid the same price for a little tiny box.  oi.  what else?  hm..  oh. i know.  one of my more embarassing purchases.   urlLink joelle  has been talking about her newest purchase and i got one too today.  i wasn't copying.  i swear!!  it's merely coincidence.  i love brushing my teeth and i love love love having a clean mouth.  so, um..  i got a spin-brush.  i'm waaaaaay too traditional for fancy items like this one but i'm pretty excited about using it.  i s'pose if i decide it's not me i'll move it down and come with it.  meow!  spinning orgasms.  delicious.

      gotta find your inner strength. if you can't then just throw life away. gotta learn to rely on you. beauty, strength and wisdom too. you're beautiful inside and out. lead a great life without a doubt. don't need a man to make things fair. 'cause more than likely he won't be there.  listen, girl gotta know it's true. in the end all you've got is you.

      hi. feels like i haven't really been around on this blog lately.  i came today just to write about everyday stuff that's been going on recently.    first off.  how are things with you?  do write and tell me how you are.    last nite was fun.  really, really fun.  i'm quite anti-social these days.  it's both chosen and hated.  part of me shoves myself into that mode.  i work 2 jobs and get selfish with my time alone....yet hate the sadness that seeps in with too many nites spent at home alone and wishing i wasn't.  however, last nite, staci & her sister, sarah, invited me over for a "get together" of the highest quality.  i worked a long day which is ick to begin with because, hello, it was saturday.  ahh well, i've become accustomed to working every weekend.  so i worked all day, came home and could really hardly stay awake but talked to staci and wanted to attend the aforementioned Get Together...soooooo, i allowed myself to nap on the couch for awhile.  it's been about 20 degrees warmer than is normal for this area this time of year but it's been very welcome..  however, since i live on the top floor of this house...it's hot up here!  i add in all these details so you can merely picture the somewhat sweaty, fan-hogging nap that ensued.  (not that i have anyone to even share a fan with here)    the nap was lovely.  i woke up when lindsay called and was then a bit frustrated with myself for over-napping but the timing really turned out to be perfect.  i spoke with the boy i adore for a bit then took an eye-opening shower.  i rubbed on a little lavender oil, dried my hair and was literally ready to go.  sandals on, hair down.  i walked over to staci's..(1 house between us) and the shindig had begun.  the festivities were taking place outside on their deck.  they have this enormous deck..part of it is covered and they have it draped with little white twinkly lights.  it's beyond charming.  sarah had also hung 3 paper lanterns from a tree that overhangs part of the deck.    they had grilled some food so we dined and then myself and 3 others walked down the street to the not-so-charming mini-mart to purchase beverages.  chatted with those accompanying to the mini-mart and enjoyed the nite air.  returned to staci & sarah's place and started drinking alcohol.  it makes me smile when i think about last nite and i'm not sure i can get it all crammed into this post but i'm going to try.  lots of fun people there..several i'd never met that live upstairs from staci & sarah.  conversation topics of the nite included new relationships, the art of bonsai (folding pouch of tools included), the art of blowing glass and my personal favorite: music.  ha.  i  wish you'd been there.  2 of the guys literally discussed/demonstrated the art of bonsai for awhile.  one of them had wanted a little plant and the other had introduced growing a bonsai tree..had all sorts of tools.  it was actually really neat.  a couple of them had watched a 3 hour pbs documentary on blowing glass which they said was pretty fucking amazing.  anyway, one of them had taken up this art..  he promptly purchased glass-blowing tools and was now practicing.  it was all really humorous yet fucking awesome too.    i spent most of the evening sipping alcohol and swinging on the porch swing with various other humans.  the nite truly was absolutely beautiful and we all said so in appreciation throughout the evening.  the wind was blowing lots....the air was filled with great conversation...people were intoxicated but not "wasted" and crazy.  we all just felt good.  met new people, listened to music, got a new CD from staci (YAY!!).    i guess the evening was pretty normal..nothing extravagant..but i loved it.  i'm never out and around so many others just having a good time and it felt so good.  i think i'm around 15 year old boys too often because at some point i felt like an adult.  now, i'm all about staying a kid and being childish in a fun way...  but i liked that people weren't just pulling pranks and chugging beer..  i learned new things, i smiled a lot and somehow felt a bit more alive than i have as of late.  i did puke a bit before i walked home but it was one of those relief pukes.  (if that makes sense)  i only did it once and i felt much better afterwards.  heh.    for now...i'm putting in the great CD staci gave to me and enjoying myself some before heading off to work again.

      i s'pose lindsay may probably be thinking something along those lines right now.  i sat here and brooded and stewed planning something to write but instead now have decided to merely end this post even before it really had begun.

      hi. i'm about to puke. what's wrong with me?  sickly and whiney these days.  yuck.  talked to lindsay for a bit and now i'm feeling completely overtaken with Ick.  the 2 are not completely related but possibly a bit.  he was dealing with some crap from his roommate of sorts and the whole thought of it just made my insides knot & twist.    in other news:  i liked that lindsay posted on here today.  it was a nice surprise.

      Aimee works so hard on this blog...it's important to her, and I'm guilty of not contributing my share. Though my life has been rather upside down lately, I should have found the time to add my thoughts ...I feel I've been selfish and have let Aimee down here...and I apologize. I've never known anyone that deserves more than she or who constantly tries harder to be a better human being.  Those that don't know her are missing out on a great learning experience...and a truly beautiful person. ********* A little rant.... I recently visited the Getty Museum here in Los Angeles which is supported by the Getty foundation. Obviously millions and millions of dollars were spent building it and it is in fact incredibly beautiful. While I have nothing against promoting culture and education, my appreciation of such "gifts to society" is constantly undermined by the less than altruistic way, and in fact the disdain in which we treat most of the truly needy in this society. How can we give so much to those who have so much and do so little for those that have nothing?  We're failing as a species. In fact, while at the Getty, I read an article called Shelter Shell Games by Dennis Romero in a small newspaper that reflects this point.  It seems the county has just lost another emergency shelter for the homeless (approximately 84,000 people in LA County).... along with county emergency medical care. The problem, they say, is that attempts to locate new shelters have been rejected by most of the cities in and around Los Angeles. The problem I have is that how can I stand and appreciate a half million dollar work of art....when there's a child appreciating the good luck in finding a half eaten sandwich in the garbage.  The plight of the homeless and the hungry is being ignored on a vicious scale so why don't the rich, such as the Getty Foundation, spend half as much on relieving human suffering.  It reminds me of a quote to the despondent by  urlLink Emma Goldman ...  urlLink "Go to the rich and ask for work.  If they offer none, ask for food.  If they offer none, take it."  I really only meant to relate to Aimee here but am nagged constantly by the inhumane treatment of humans and animals in this country of plenty and the need to talk about it. I love you Aimee.... and learn from you all the time.. Lindsay

      i come to you with dirty hands and a quiet heart. i am feeling a bit defeated. spent the day attempting to be productive..  worked for job #2 as much as possible...  planted a whole bunch of flowers, pulled even more weeds, dug in the dirt, listened to music.  i borrowed staci's cd walkman so i shoved it in the front pocket of my hoody and cranked it up loud while i was working.  it was nice.  so, all in all..it WAS a fairly productive day....however, i was scampering about trying to get the yard mowed before it got dark....ran up to the gas station to fill-up the gas can, fueled the mower up and.........it was a no-go.  prolly needs a new spark plug but it's now dark and i don't want to mess with it..so, 'alas..the yard is unkempt for today.    i never have much luck with seeds so keep those little guys in  your prayers and stuff.  i watered them in and stamped them a bit so hopefully in a couple'a 4 weeks or so we'll have some "wildflowers" sprouting.  exciting news, eh?    i'm starving and smell of gasoline.  i spilled it on my shoe.  that's uncool.  would you fix me a decent meal while i go bathe? maaaaan..  that'd be nice.  don't you think that'd be nice?  i'll come back smelling clean with soft skin and wet hair and we'll dine on whatever freshness you've created.  Mm..    i have my foot propped up on the desk and the gasoline is pungent.  whew!  it's reminding me of "love, liza" that movie with phillip seymour hoffman where he starts huffing gasoline all the time.  ha.  i really enjoyed that movie.  i used to really hate hoffman  now, i love him.  i think he's just plain great.  maybe it's him in certain roles that i hate.. 'cause when he was in "the talented mr. ripley" (which sucked)..i hated his character..  this snobbish fellow.  maybe i like seeing him in a role with a quirky, somewhat pathetic side.  hm..  i don't know.    just banged my knee and that hurt.  phone rang and it was job #1 so i pretended not to hear/see it.  heh.  ok.  you're right..i simply declined the call.  it's my day off!  leave me alone!  (unless you want to cook me a nice meal)

      i showered and emerged hot.  my skin was glowing and i was frustrated.  god i want him.  i could see him clearly in my head.  i was fucking myself hard.  i wanted to feel spread open and exposed.  i pulled my pussy lips open and shoved the vibrator inside me.  it twisted and i imagined his fingers groping my insides.  he has the most perfect hands.  i felt out of my head and went from fast and hard to slow and deliberate.  i pictured him there, close to my cunt..  i saw him looking at me..staring at my cunt.  i felt him craving me.  his eyes went from my cunt to my face and his words begged me to come for him.  i molested my clit and lifted in orgasm.  i was shaking and felt a hot tear slip down the left side of my face and into my hair.  i was crying.  i was...crying..  weeping.  reality slapped my face.  distance jeered and pointed at me..laughing.  i was suddenly eve in the garden of eden and had to cover myself.  i felt embarassed and alone.    that's where i am now.  a bit embarassed and alone.    to be continued. . .

      when i was at tara's i watched some cable tv.  ('cause....i don't have cable)  is it just me or is every other channel some sort of design show..?  seemed so.  i tend to like things more when they're not so prevalent.  i was in love with donnie darko's song "mad world" done by gary jules whenever the movie first appeared in some beautiful, red velvet little indie theater.  what was that, 2 years ago?  i dunno but i was in love with the song..an old tears for fears song..now, what the fuck?  it's played on the radio!!  i'll never stop loving the song but damn.  it seems tainted now.  i loved it so much more when it wasn't everywhere.  i also hate falling in love with something and it's discovered a couple years later like it's brand-fucking-new.  UGH!!  so, anyway...  back when i still didn't have cable and my parents had direcTV or something....i watched some design shows....now, yeah.  they're everywhere.  i said that.  all of this to tell you i'm "indulging" in tv's extreme home makeover show.  it's entertaining enough.  it's not often i watch TV anyway.  my apartment is clean, all my laundry is done, i ran errands today and am feeling pretty good.  the babies downstairs have been crying non-stop for about 2 hours now.  oi.  what is going on?!!    i sort of review this blog and what it's about on a daily basis and i want to tweak it somehow.  talking about what i cooked for dinner, what's pissing me off, what made me smile, the music i'm listening to..Hello!!  how the hell is that different from 40 million other blogs?  blah.  i still hate the look too.  hate.    missing lindsay a lot today.  he's been a bit unavailable and it makes me kinda sad.  i like when he's around.  i like when he calls for no reason.  i like when he's in the middle of something but rings my phone to let me know he's thinking about me.  i like to hear his voice before i fall asleep.  i like to hear his voice first thing when i wake up.  syrupy sappy sap sap.    i tried inviting over a bunch of different people for dinner tonight.  i cooked too much.  every single person i called either had dinner plans or was just busy.  heh.  oh well.  i ate, cleaned everything up and am heading back into the living room now.  have books piled up, a magazine and the sunday paper all waiting for me to read them.  i'm gonna go dive in.  i want to write something lovely later.  i hope you had a nice thursday.  i work tomorrow and the rest of this weekend..  Easter too.  ahh well.

      yesterday. i worked, got off early and made a last minute decision to drive an hour 1/2 to a friend's home.  it was low-key with nothing really to report but an evening not spent alone in my apartment was kind of nice.  i got to talk to lindsay for quite awhile and that was nice.  things have shifted with him again and each day is different..  not sure what will happen next.  part of me wants to explain and part of me feels it's best left unsaid for now.    listening to deathcab for cutie right now..in the studio on the world cafe.  mmm...good times.  hadn't really heard of them until resident jason spoke of them.    also just made a pathetic sign to post on local bulletin boards shamelessly promoting um..  Myself..  heh.  i made it simple and am hoping it'll catch someone's eye and they'll want to 'hire' me for some random stuff and pay me some cash.  who knows.  it looks lame...like i'm 11 and trying to earn ice cream money mowing lawns.  the mentality is the same.    may i gripe for a moment and say i tried to buy 2 new ink cartridges for my printer...a color one and a plain black one.  i realized quickly that i SERIOUSLY could almost just buy a brand new printer for the price of 2 cartridges.  damn.  illogical and irritating.    oh.  got new shoes.  has been years..for real..  they're fun and they were $15.99.  do you see how the coolness seeps from my pores?  ha!    glad you came here?  you're better off for it.

      it's 5:21 or something close to that and i'm exhausted.  i can hardly keep my eyes open as i sit here.  is this the part where i try blaming it on daylight saving time?  (that's grammatically correct, nazi.  i looked it up.)  perhaps i'll write more later.  that would excite you, wouldn't it?

      we talked awhile.   i mentioned a counselor.   she suggested anti-depressants.  i don't like the thought of either.  i refuse the latter.   drowning in loneliness.  hating the theme on this blog as of late.  wanting to give myself a swift kick in the ass.  my face is dotted by tiny blisters from sunburn.  i'm tired and have nothing nice to say..and so..  i will say no more.

      for a short stint i had a 2nd job working in the seafood department of this large grocery store.  i worked with this same guy all the time.  he thought i was cool 'cause i'd seen a clockwork orange and didn't mind touching the octopus.  we wore these fish boat looking rubber aprons and it was always really cold.  i think slingin' octopus paid more than being a social worker.  (in fact i'm sure of it) and ..  dead fish talk a lot less.

      i love that i stretched luxuriously and rolled over at 4:30 this morning and realized i could snuggle down and go back to sleep for another HOUR!  got in bed at a decent time last nite, read a little bit then drifted away.  i've coffee to drink and blogs to read before taking a slow shower.  i dunno..maybe i could get used to the early morning thing.  i long for consistency...for routine.  i want one of those Cheers'esque things where every tuesday nite i meet the same people at the same place...  hm..  do you know what i mean?  i s'pose this becomes very boring for some and i should perhaps be thankful for the variety in my work schedule.  it's just grown old.  i've never worked the same days/hours 2 weeks in a row.  having evenings off...being around on the weekends..  doesn't happen.  anyway, today we're taking the kids i work with to this huge 'Field Day' type thing for kids that are locked up.  it's held at another facility an hour or 2 away that looks like a prison.  we'll load all these grumpy kids into state vans and then preach to them about teamwork all day.  i'm required to wear a white t-shirt.  gee.  i hope it rains.  if it does i will then finally have the opportunity to march up to my juvenile delinquents and proudly ask whether or not they like my boobs.  'alas..  that makes me snicker.  no, really...  they do possess the ability to suck the life force from me...but i'd never actually refer to them as juvenile delinquents in a derogatory sense.  they're beautiful kids.  sometimes i wanna tug their heads off and eat 'em for a meal with fava be....  aaaaaanyway.  they're not bad kids.  i should shower now.  wish us luck in the tug-o-war!!

      feeling bitter and frustrated.  always some level of anger brewing under the surface.  it's my problem.  i become enraged because of feelings of guilt or jealousy.  What i could be doing versus what i am doing - - behind, no energy, always hopeful - waiting for what comes next.  waiting.  waiting.  You:  not putting out effort.  Inspired me to do more, be more - now i see you depressed and stagnant.  there's a constant of misery only speckled by happy times.  do those outweigh the plentiful tense times?  I feel defensive all the time.  I get angry because i feel like you're at me about things...telling me what i should be doing.  but those things aren't the same for you.  You're not accountable, no effort....you're waiting.  What are you waiting for?  I'm scared.  Will i look back in 2 years, in 1 year and scold myself?  berate myself for silly mistakes?  I cannot imagine my life without you in it.  But i long to be with you and feel foolish for wanting those things.  I want it more than you.  I don't want to feel stuck and stagnant.  I hate drama.  i'm not trying to cause any drama.  - just want happiness.  i'm not moving forward with anything in my life.  constantly waiting - waiting - waiting for whatever comes next.  make it happen, aimee.    in a constant state of PONDERING.  feels like i'm waiting to live - always disappointed in myself, not doing things to make myself proud.  Can't talk to you and tell you how i'm feeling - you get angry.  Don't have time for that.    Have to hurry up and go nowhere.  Hurry up and do nothing.  I'm no good, no help.  We're stagnant.  rarely feel loved.  You shut down - block me out - we're watching TV, going through the motions.    this didn't help really.  i wrote all this down.  black sharpie marker on white paper.  i wrote as fast as my hand would allow...trying to keep up with my brain.  nothing is clear.  never know which way to turn.  Instead of working through things w/ me you throw the towel in and say fuck it.  once again - don't have time for it.  I can hear it.  i can hear it reverberating in my head.  I don't have time for this, aimee!  God.  Fuck.  Listen to your tone!  what are you going to do?  what are you going to do?  what can i catch you doing wrong next.  wish i had a reason to yell and scream at you, aimee.  let's be mad at each other.  it's relief when you're not around, aimee.  Distance.  the Distance is killing me.  a nice girl there?  you could just find a nice girl there.  you don't want me.  not now.  not ever.  waiting.  waiting for nothing.  Get things good there and forget about me.  will be easy to do.  read a quote the other day.  wanted to live that way..  an ideal sort of thing.  is it possible?  feeling ugly.    "Love, true love, is that which you can give the most without asking or demanding anything in return."  it sounds beautiful but really..  i guess it happens.  in a healthy relationship?  I can see that quote applying to a certain degree...there comes a point when things are not healthy.  a woman getting the shit beaten out of her daily by her husband that she loves..is she supposed to just keep right on loving without asking anything in return?  no.  i don't feel that is how the quote is applied or should be applied.    Distance is safe.  he keeps me at this far far distance and..  it's safe.  it's always been safe for him.  She's a nice girl sometimes.  aimee.  she's ok.  i don't want to hurt her.  reality.  so bitter.  there's animosity.  i'm jealous even of his crazy life there.  freedom.  accountable to noone.  i feel lazy.  i guess i am lazy.  i'm so offended if someone even implies it...but it's true.  unmotivated.  digging a hole and shooting myself in the foot.  you will never see me. You will Never see Me. Could never ever be bored with you.  never.  i feel like you don't listen.  you make up your mind and then block out what i have to say.  i want to feel loved.  i want to feel wanted.  we are in constant turmoil.  battling one another daily.  it's not healthy.  making me crazy.  i'm crazy.  absolutely crazy.   i love you. i feel ugly.  Ugly.   am i convincing myself or them?  made this blog.  wanted to have one of those amazing, serendipitous relationships.  magical.  filled with love.  people would be envious of how crazy we are about each other.  but it's me that's crazy about you.  it's one-sided and perhaps i should've seen that a long time ago.  i have seen that a long time ago.  i'm a stupid girl.  i want fairytales and magic.  he will never be with me.. not here, not there.  wake up.  he'll read this and say fuck it.  he'll say in an angry voice..  If that's what you want, we'll never talk again.  that's not what i want.  it's not cut and dried like that.      pause.  i scribbled most of this on a piece of paper earlier this morning after getting off the phone with lindsay.  he knows i wrote it on the blog but doesn't know what it says.  asked me if i'm sure i want to say everything i said.  said maybe it's just my mood.  it's not just my mood.  this is my heart and i'm not going to censor it.  maybe i'm wrong.  i make mistakes... i make them a lot.  i'm ending this post for now.  it feels incomplete.

      music rules my life.   when i woke up this morning...  all i wanted was Jem.  I needed to hear that first track.  my eyes were blurry but i fumbled for the play button and smiled a sleepy smile when the music began.  deep breath.  the day had begun.  i always sleep with windows open.  once i was the slightest bit more conscious i realized i could smell freshly mown grass.  spring has definitely sprung.    the friend, sarah, i was with last nite always purchased a couple of books.  we came up with the ingenius, devious plan of reading, listening, etc. to our new purchases and then swapping awhile.  i told her after we absorb all of these things then swap we'll be living such a decadent life!  it took all i had to allow myself to make such purchases for me and only me.  sarah and i have strangely similar tastes with a few twists and have talked about swapping music for a long time...it's just a matter of actually doing it.    have to be productive today.  have to!  also have to get in bed at a decent time.  up at 5:30 tomorrow morning.  even if i just slept 10 hours...i don't like getting up at 5:30 in the morning.  blech.  so..  i'm off to get started and get to work.  i think today would be a good day to start planting flowers outside.  Mmm..  last year at the end of the summer i went crazy buying seeds.  i don't always have good luck with seeds...better with bulbs or pre-potted but we'll see.  enough of that.  make sure i'm productive today.  and and and......  comments rock my world!!    oh yeah..  tell me what you think.  i spoke with a friend yesterday and she told me she got engaged a week ago and.....  the wedding is today.  i was shocked but felt like she was telling me the truth..  however, today, one of our mutual friends told me she thinks it's just an april fool's joke.  i had really forgotten it was april 1...  so now i'm confused.  it sure didn't SEEM like an april fool's joke, but i suppose the best ones don't seem like jokes in the beginning.  maybe i should show up just in case.  hm.

      i love words.  is that why i've developed this affection for people's blogs?   i love the way people describe things. i love when people talk of the way something tastes or they speak of slutty foods.  indulgent things.  scents.  rich meats, juicy fruits and strong liquor.  decadent sweet things that taste good or feel good or look good.   i'm lifting this from  urlLink smitten  and she placed it there from someone else (Anthony Bourdain).  just a small nibble.    ". . .a single wild strawberry, so flavorful that it nearly took your head off … your grandmother’s lasagne ... a first sip of stolen ice-cold beer on a hot summer night, hands smelling of crushed fireflies … leftover pork fried rice, because your girlfriend at the time always seemed to have some in the fridge … steamer clams, dripping with drawn butter. . ."   i've been seeking gluttony in strange areas.  drinking lots and lots of water and somewhere in my mind feeling as though i'm washing off my insides...refreshing them.  gluttony in nourishment..wanting fresh fresh things chocked full of vitamins and beautiful to consume..  rip them open, let juice drip down your chin..  be okay with sticky fingers.  indulgently long showers using absolutely too much body wash and having more lather and soapy goodness than one girl could every really need no matter how secretly pretty princess pink she wanted to be.    gluttony in words and information...pouring them into my open brain.  Mmm...  off to indulge.

      i come to you in a truly pathetic fashion today.  i'm worried about job stuff and have not been nearly as committed as i should be to my search.  my resume needs a complete overhaul and i'm being a lazy git and refusing to do it.  it seems so daunting.    my body is going crazy.  i think now i'm just being paranoid and crazy.  tomorrow morning i go back to the doctor to discuss all of my test results at length.  i'm glad because i think it will answer some questions.  (hopefully)  however, i awoke this morning with a sore throat and runny nose.  i'm whiney, alone and not wanting to go to work.  geez.  i think i need fed and to have my diaper changed as well.  UGH!  tara drove up yesterday to hang out with me.  she stayed the nite and i was disappointed when she left about 20 minutes after we woke up.  ahh well.  i should really just go for a walk to clear my head and shake some of my dripping patheticness.    lindsay called yesterday and it made me angry instantly.  heh.  sort this out, aimee!!  make a decision, both of you!!  stick with it and let's move forward!!  i feel like we just keep sort of bouncing and bumbling around in a mess...not landing on our feet and walking forward.  and most certainly not doing ANY of it with a smile on our face.  i got upset and he was ready to hang up so..  he did.  we did.  i called back in a moment of weakness and semi-apologized.  his voice sounded wonderful and i hated myself for letting it feel so good.  we're not just ok now but we did speak.

      it's monday and i'm floating around in limbo today.  i started my morning with an email lindsay had sent..  only like 3 words inquiring about my weekend which was spent working my ass off and spending time with crazy family at a high school graduation party.  he wants me to be angry at him and so i'm trying my damnedeset not to be..  but fuck.  i'm angry and i'm hurt.  he ignores me for days and then has to audacity to send me this short, curt email probing into my weekend.  i'll write it here because i'm angry and that's life.  i went to the hospital last week and had more tests run, i go back to the doctor this week to discuss all of my test results at length.  has lindsay even bothered to ask this?  no.  fuck!  i just read some delicious stuff from  urlLink henry & june .  it was sexual and they love each other and it made me absolutely green with envy.  i sometimes don't even understand the power with which i love lindsay and yet we cannot be together.  i live in the midwest, he lives in LA.  we are worlds apart in geography and otherwise.  everything that's happening i take very personal and perhaps i shouldn't.  he sent an email telling me he can't hear me upset or yell at him.  i berate myself for being angry on the phone with him but when in that moment i feel very justified.  i'm at a loss for what to say right now.  i want lindsay's life in order.  i've always pictured a life with him...but i fear it may only be a picture in my head.  is it possible to feel so strongly yet be so wrong?  i guess so.  my heart hurts and i have no desire to see anyone at all.  i'm going to spend the day cleaning and working here.  am feeling nauseous with the varied emotions pushing and swimming inside my stomach.  pretty sure lindsay still isn't reading this.  oh well.

      "housekeeping" - - those past couple of photos have been from mark ryden.  he's conveniently linked right over there on my sidebar.  i didn't intentionally omit his name when posting those pictures.  his work is beautiful and i love it.  pink bunny is nursing.  heh.  i love that picture.    onto other topics of interest or not.  i've been keeping my cell phone off most of the time.  somehow this gave my crazy brain the idea that i was "in control."  i tried to convince myself i hadn't heard from lindsay because i've kept my phone off but in reality he really hasn't contacted me for days.  i guess i felt like i was somehow, in a minorly twisted manner, choosing not to take his calls..however, there were no calls to take and admittedly..  it makes me really sad.  i paused just then trying to find the right wording but i simply makes me very sad.  lindsay's sunk into a rut..  he's been there for awhile and no tugging from anyone else, no matter how hard...will pull him out of it.  he'll have to climb out himself.  i'm feeling inadequate and angry and confused and i want some sort of peace inside about this situation.    my cousin graduated from high school today.  my cousin graduated from the same high school i did, today.  i didn't get to watch him because i was working (what's new?) but i did get to see him last nite and it's all very strange.  i look at him and try to remember that, oh yes, he's old enough to drive now and yeah, that's his girlfriend and yes, he did just CURSE in front of his damn parents.  ugh.  i hate that.  i curse, i love it...  but i have some respect for the parents.  come now.  i sat around in mostly silence while he and his friends played pool, my parents talked on and on about various things regarding their garden and work and such.  i felt very grown up as instead of merely having my name signed to the card my parents purchased i had my own card with my own money inside signed all by myself just for him.  heh.  i'm way tired.  emotionally drained.   i've had lindsay on my mind constantly.  it truly just drums away inside.  a constant beating....a low hum..  what will happen next?  i'm not sure.  he's keeping his distance and doing a good job of it.  i'm trying to roll with whatever happens to us.  i guess i feel him unofficially saying goodbye to me.  i'm going to put up a picture bid you farewell for now.  i'm worn out.

       urlLink    I want a lover I don't have to love, I want a boy who's so drunk he doesn't talk. Where's the kid with the chemicals? I got a hunger and I can't seem to get full. I need some meaning I can memorize. The kind I have always seems to slip my mind. But you, but you... You write such pretty words, But life's no storybook. Love's an excuse to get hurt. And to hurt. Do you like to hurt? I do, I do. Then hurt me

      what am i doing?  i informed lindsay that when he doesn't bother to contact me..  it hurts my feelings.  lindsay dealt with this in the only logical manner possible..  by choosing to not contact me at all yesterday.  well, folks..  in case you're unaware..  that's a really shitty feeling.    today.  i was going to rise early but of course that always falls through.  i should set my alarm for like 5 am, so that if i slam the snooze button for an hour...i don't feel so bad when i rise at 6 am.  got up quite awhile ago and have been reading.  i'm headed outside to walk, returning home to go to post office and buy stamps, take a long, ultra-luxurious shower and then dine on some fine clear liquids in prep for my cat scan at noon today.  not a big deal and i'm sure i'll get to prance around in a cute, pink paper gown.  ugh.  i'll be sure to wear cute underwear.  work tonight and then back in the morning..  A Turnaround.  (involves 8 hours between 1 shift and the next)  so i'll arrive home around 1'ish, not be able to immediately crash and then be due back at 8 am tomorrow morning.  enough griping out of me for now.    my feelings are hurt and i'm doing the only sensible thing i can do and that is to stick to myself and refuse to contact lindsay.  i feel i have that right.  i leave voicemails, i send emails...and nothing.  so yesterday when he chose to ignore me...  i returned the favor.  i made the effort and now it's his turn.  just for the book i don't plan on hearing from him today either.  hope your day is pleasant.  i'm a moody bit.

      what are you doing? what are you thinking?  it drums in my head.   i was fun.  will i ever be fun again?  was it slurped up into the ether?  did i throw it away consciously?    alone and wondering what we're doing?  need him near.  not sure how much longer i can go on like this.  the epitome of long-distance.  waiting waiting waiting.  good days, great days, happy, smiling, sweetness...and then lonely and waiting only to be let down.  my own doing.  having expectations only sets me up for disappointment.    i sent a message that asked him to keep me. his response was simply..  'i will..if you let me.'  it was every bit of what i needed and now a couple of days later i feel lonely and avoided and just generally unimportant.  that's a pretty yucky feeling and i only antagonize him.  my words are bitter and they make him growl.  he never bothers to read this.  i made it for us, in hopes that he'd contribute right along with me...things about us, for us, between us, etc.  instead it goes for weeks without him even opening it.  again i ask..  what am i doing?  what the fuck am i doing?  and how long will i continue to ask that question that goes unanswered?

      love that saturn commercial about the dent resistant doors.  not really visually, but audibly.  it has a fun beat as things slam into the doors.  - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -   raw bloody meat & opium incense. strong liquor & cold ice. bad gyrl & good boy. cold rice & hot curry.  - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -   i've been having a private tiff all day long.  lindsay called and i was frazzled to my last bit.  i was really not even irritated at anything he'd done in the least but within moments i was loud, ugly and hanging up without warning.  i didn't even ponder the hanging up part...i just did it.  i instantly regretted it but have not talked to him since.  feeling like a pouty baby.  i went to the store and spent too much money.  i bought food, a hummingbird feeder, incense from the health food store and a book about green tea which i've been consuming a lot of.  i paid a portion of the late fee i owe to the video store and rented 2 movies.  one of them...i've seen it time and time again (Gummo) but i rented it again 'cause i like it so much.  i also got 'the entity' 'cause the boy i love recommended i watch it alone in a very dark house..so that's the plan for this evening.  i sat on my front porch and and talked to one of my co-workers from job #2 and then our case manager showed up and asked if we'd like to go for drinks after she swims.  i was going to stay in my home and sip amaretto tonight.  heh.  i'm a crabby crab.  i'd like to resign from my job yesterday.  i need to be fucked beyond bad and lindsay just doesn't have that on his brain.  however, it seems to consume mine as of late.  i'll definitely not push the issue.  think i'll go cook something.  baby spinach was on sale.  i bought crusty roasted garlic rustique bread.  i'm hungry.  i'll find something pretty to post for you later...  maybe the cover picture of Gummo...i love that picture.     lindsay.  lindsay.  lindsay.  i love you.  find me and keep me.   oh yeah, and don't let me forget.  i got passed up for that position at work i really wanted.  i smiled and was unaffected in front of my boss and the instant i hit the night air outside the door i cried hot tears.  fuck them.  if i quit i'd have 2 months of pay coming but it seems/IS stupid of me to want to quit before having another full-time job.  i have the other 2 part times ones but it won't work.  hot blood in my veins tonight.  don't stand too close.

      there's a dog barking outside.  there are dogs at several houses around me but i rarely consciously hear them barking.  tonight i hear them.  mixed in with my typing they are the only thing i hear.    i can barely hold my eyes open.  i was trying so hard to stay awake to hear his voice.  i'm a dumb, moody gyrl when he calls and wakes me up.  crazy.  i love for him to call and wake me up...i love it..  but i'm almost always by default moody.  it's like i'm a grumpy drunk and tomorrow i'll not remember most of it.  he should take advantage of me.  he should do dirty dirty things to this gyrl.  he should tell this girl to do dirty dirty things to him 'cause um..  she will.  meow.  where are you, lindsay?

      got home from work just a bit ago.  the wee lass below me was weeping about something.  ok, so weeping doesn't really cut it... wailing, really.  she's 2 yrs. old.  2 yr olds cry over stuff.  anyway, i pulled off my sandals, did a couple things here and she was still goin' at it downstairs.  it was then that i heard her mother.  she just recently turned 22.  the wee lass has a more wee lad for a brother.  her mom was screaming, SHUT UP!!  SHUT UPPPP!!!  now, folks..  i do not have children and i've been known to say things i regret as i watch them tumble outta my mouth but should i ever have a wee thing..i cannot imagine screaming shut up at him/her/them.  heh.  again, never know until you're in that situation.  1 am, you're way fucking tired and she won't quit screaming...  shut up flies outta your mouth.  i s'pose worse things have happened..  i just see the products people like the mom downstairs may be crankin' out and damn.  stop the assembly line.  we're missings some pieces.  * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *   on a completely, COMPLETELY different note.  i want him insanely.  so much so that i cannot bring myself to even pester my clit.  heh.  typing it out it doesn't seem to make much sense but in my head, i'm really just waiting around for that moment when he wants me insanely as well and takes.  driving home i thought of nice things.  i want him sleeping and unexpecting.  i'll stalk my prey and poke at him..making sure he's sleeping soundly.  when i'm absolutely sure i'll slither beneath our blankets and crawl up between his legs.  upon arrival i'll rub warm fingers over his thighs.  i know i'd pause to splash around in the immense puddle of gushy love i'd feel for him and then i'd gently so gently nudge his legs apart.  i'll softly put my cheek against his warm thigh and nuzzle in so that i can get my mouth close.  i'll suckle at each of his balls and tenderly grope his cock.  he'll know without a doubt as he slowly blinks awake that i love him like crazy with everything i have.  and i hope i hope hope that when he's awake and allowing me to love him..he'll flood my mouth with himself.  i miss him tonight.  tell him hello if you see him walking by and brush his shoulder if you want.  some of that glimmer he has may just end up on you.

      what is it?  why don't you love me as you love the others?  you rise early..you sip coffee and snicker over their daily musings..   you sit at work and your wetness permeates your panties as you read of the beautiful dirty things she did the night before.  you criticize and ridicule.  you swoon.  you smile.  you comment.  i'm good enough.  i'm smart enough.  and goshdarnit..  people like me!!  so again..  why don't you love me as you love the others?  not that i care.  'cause, i obviously don't care..     anyway..  the doctor found a couple minor things.  minor.  i'm lovingly referring to them as minor.  i have to get a CAT Scan (is that how you spell it?).  they're doing it of my chest.  i was impressed.  the night before last i came home from work, pushed play on the machine...and there was the friendly voice of my doctor, inquiring as to how i'm feeling, etc.  he called my home to check on me.  that's nice.  isn't that nice?  i think it's really nice.    i got off work just a bit ago and arrived home.  i was hoping lindsay would find me before sleep but perhaps not.  tomorrow morning (err..  later this morning!) i'll rise at 5:30 am..work at job #2 until noon and then work from 4 until midnight at job #1.  lovely.  oh well.  perhaps i'll squeeze in a nap.  it's ok.  i'm not complaining.  tomorrow morning i'll be running some sort of table at our Walk-A-Thon.  it'll be ok.  (am i assuring you or me?)  lindsay is out of a horrible living situation and has moved into a better one, i believe.  i'm hoping things start looking up.  i thought about him a lot today.  he shimmers and shines when life is not sucker punching him.  the past couple of days i've felt some of his glimmer and it's made my insides happy.  everything feels completely different when i'm feeling loved by him.  he hasn't been online for awhile so he hasn't read our blog or seen the changes.  do you like some of the changes?  i do and i'm happy to post pictures.  perhaps i can do so tonight before i sleep.  i need some beautiful dirtiness in my life.  Mmm..  going to see if i have something nice to put up for you.    goodnight.

      gloomy music pushed it's gray, bony finger into my ear.  it stayed there and fingered me some whether i liked it or not.  i relented and in the end...encouraged it.  i raised the volume and opened my ears further.  alone with night air coming in.  i admired my darkening bruise on my arm.  achey in the crook of my arm.  i like this bruise.  it feels earned.  heh.

      life has always been a pretty song...and pretty loud. you're so beautiful.  why's it fading out?   and i don't want to live forever. but as long as i do,  i'd love to live for real.  now the boy who dried your tears is...crying all the time. now the joy i've had for years has left me for awhile.  and i don't want to live forever. but as long as i do i'd love to live for real. with you i might get there. with you i might start to feel. with you i will get there. with you i will live for real.  i will breathe the air, i'll dance and you will wonder why. it's because you made me see this chance was moving by. 'cause i'm not going to live forever but as long as i do i'd love to live for real. with you i might get there. with you i might start to feel. with you i will get there. with you i will live for real.  when the cloud becomes my head. play your music loud instead. and we'll dance until the both of us are dead.  with you i might get there. with you i might start to feel. with you i will get there. with you i will live for real.    It's day 4 of my vacation.  i've been trying to suck up every opportunity to see people and do some things.  it's been a good time but i pretty much wasted this whole day and am feeling pissy about it.  i had planned to hang out with a friend so was ready to walk out the door about 6 hours ago but i guess there was some miscommunication and 'alas...  there will probably be no plans.  heh.    there are a lot of productive things i could be doing but i'm rebelling against them and refusing to do them.    i'm chewing a big piece of watermelon bubble gum.  my hair is in messy pigtails and i've got hardly any clothes on because it's sooo hot in my apartment.  i'm having flashes of naomi judd in 'a time to kill.'  if you're unfamiliar..they're in the south in the movie and it seems that everyone, no matter what the setting..was glistening with sweat constantly.    the grammar was all sorts of messed up in that last sentence.  anyway.  nothing else to type for today.  lindsay and i just decided to "take the day off."  (day off from each other) everything feels unresolved and messy..ugly.  yuck.

      i tend to lean towards writing on this blog when i'm really happy or when i'm really hurting.  (maybe i'm a bi-polar blogger?)  that's unfortunate for those of you that read this.  today is a day in pain.    i need a change.    lindsay called earlier and i snapped instantly.  i'm tired of his constant suspicions..i'm tired of always having to explain everything about where i am, what i'm doing, who i'm with, etc.  i'm tired of long-distance.  i'm so fucking tired.  this is my week off of work.  i've been looking forward to this "vacation" sooooo much.  i have to enjoy it.  so far this first day, day #1 of vacation has just been miserable.  it's perfect outside so i drove around for a long time with the windows down....trying to sort things out in my head and in my heart...    background info: this isn't particularly stuff i want to or planned on sharing, but here goes.  i met lindsay online over a year ago.  we were very close quickly.  since then we've spent our days finding one another online or on the phone or via mailboxes...  i've ached to visit and he won't allow it...  i've begged for him to come here and he will not.  there are circumstances in his life right now that put quite the hinderance on doing anything of the sort but admittedly....i'm miserable.  i can't stand not being near him...  the thing is...   I've never been near him.    it's almost daily that at some point i'm in tears over the situation.  i feel like i've given it my all and nothing has gotten better.  i keep waiting around for his situation to change....and it hasn't.  he reads this, obviously. i don't know what to do.  if i say i want time away from the situation he will immediately jump to the conclusion that i have found someone else.....that i want to be with someone else....and that's honestly not the case.  lindsay pulls out some good things in me...but those times are becoming less and less frequent...  rare, actually.  i'm weeping like a child as i write this.  i want time away.  i want time to sort out my head.  i need clarity to figure out what i'm supposed to do.  lindsay is in LA.  i'm far far away in the midwest.  our lives are very different and i had hoped to someday join them together.....but i just don't see it ever ever happening.    i don't want to be one of those people that gives up and throws in the towel...  but what am i waiting on?  waiting on a Happier long-distance relationship?  i want in person, in the flesh stuff here.  i'm 100% aware that a relationship, a boyfriend....isn't what makes life happy.  it can frost the cake and make it sweeter perhaps...but it's not what completes it.  if i take some steps away from this...  it's NOT to run off and find a boyfriend!  it's to find some peace..  to escape drama and anger.  i'm irritable and on edge with him constantly and whether he'd admit it or not...  he is with me too.  i feel like this is making me a bad person.  i'm unhappy...alone...bitter...jaded...non-trusting..fucking lonely.   when i grow up...i wanna be happy.   what do we do now?  do we take time off?  do i walk away?  do i wait things out and try to be as helpful as possible?  i feel like i've exhausted my waiting and helping..  i've tried to do all that i can do and i've reached "the end of my rope."  i'm dangling.  my fingers have slipped.  there's nobody down there to catch me.  lindsay's hurting and alone too..but i don't see myself doing him any good....  and this doesn't feel like it's doing me good.  i feel selfish.  i feel like things got hard.....stayed hard...and i gave up.  i don't quit so easily.  i need help!  i need clarity and direction.  i need to know what to do.  there are no men here in my life.  NONE.  couldn't be more true.  i've withdrawn into myself.  i'm anti-social.  the last 2 days i've been with staci & sarah and it's more than i have been around others in months.    when i grow up..  i wanna be happy.

      I've been bouncing salary figures around in my head all day.  I hate it!  I hate negotiating money and such.  Yuck!  The HR Manager that is giving me an offer completely misread something after I had faxed her my most recent pay stub and now that mistake feels very detrimental.  I'm having a very hard time stomaching the idea of moving into a new job that I feel a bit unsure about only to take a paycut on top of it all.  That seems very very foolish to me.  At this point I very highly doubt that this company is willing to pay me what I want.  She upped the offer once and now I'm trudging through this trying to figure out how to go about pointing out her mistake and also asking for more..all respectfully.  Blech!  I think she may be at lunch at the moment.  I've been trying to call her back for an hour and she's not be at her desk so I just keep trying..  Maybe if I keep typing for a few minutes and then get ahold of her I'll be able to type some resolution here on this site.  Ha!  If she refuses should I suck it up and wait for a pay raise or do I drive on down the road and look for something else?  My gut says keep driving..  However, I want out of my current job just as soon as possible!  'Alas..  I cannot contact her.  I've called many times and so finally I settled for leaving her a voicemail.  I hope she contacts me soon.  My fingers are itchy to compose a letter of resignation, however..  I refuse to write it before I know for sure because writing the letter is like getting your plane tickets..  They make the trip real!  So, I'll not write up a letter of resignation that I'm not ever sure I need yet because then the trip would feel real.  I'll keep moving through this day.  I work this afternoon.  Mmm.. breathe deep.  and..  I like that Lindsay wrote on here yesterday.  (Notice anything different about my writing today?)

      I love walking.  I always have. But I've come to realize something in the last few years that may say a lot about me in general.   I don't like walking back.  Going on long walks is something I've done for years...but I've stopped.....and I realize it's because I'm always regretting the walk back.  I want to keep going.  After a while I find myself thinking.....fuck, I'd like to see what's up around the bend, over the hill... like to walk through the forest for another hour or two....but...I still have to walk back to where I started from. It frustrates me... and I don't walk anymore. ** (Aimee, by the way, deserves all that she asks for.  If you don't know her....you should.

      i just want really intense, crazy beautiful love.  wrap me up in it.  let me feel that you can't get enough of me.  allow me to dance around in how smitten you are.  surprise me.  do random nice things for me.  tell me that you love me.  show that you think of me.  make me dinner.  pick me up from work when i least expect it.  make my heart flutter.  brush hair outta my face.  kiss my forehead.  allow me to stand on my tip-toes and kiss you.  fuck me really really dirty.  hold my hand because you just want to.  teach me things.  learn about me.  know me better than anyone.  be my friend.  and i promise..with all that i am..  i will do all of the same for you.

      yeah.  i'm  here...floating around.  still waiting to hear about the job.  there were 8 references i included and she's contacted every last one of them.  damn.  she's still waiting to hear back from one of them and therefore i am waiting to hear back from her.  because i work for the state....when she called my employer to verify that i work there....they refused.  i guess our regional office charges $15 for that information to be released.  ha.  fucked up.  so i had to dig up my W2 form from last year and my most recent pay stub.  the state makes no sense most of the time.  talked to my mom a lot again today.  she's going to talk to her/our pastor this week about the divorce.  my dad continues to live up to his reputation as an asshole.  my mom grows more miserable by the day.  today she said softly with her head down, picking apart a dandelion..  "he's done everything he could possibly do to me.  he's done very bad things to me..  very mean things."  she spoke of him cheating on her and the tears started.  they are quickly brushed away.  i noticed she's lost in thought often..  mumbling to herself or shaking her head.  it makes my heart real sad and i'm lost as to what role i should be playing.  supportive?  neutral?  i don't know.  thing is, i agree with her..  my dad has treated us pretty damn shitty.  i, however....got the hell outta there.  she's been stuck there.    - : - : - : - : - : - : - : - : -   the job i interviewed for...  the HR person gave me her card.  their logo is a really neat, pink butterfly.  (much cooler than it might sound) heh.  weird only to me...and ironic somehow.    - : - : - : - : - : - : - : - : -   i'm tired.  so tired always lately.  when i stop moving and sit down i'm asleep within minutes.  it's really quite the boring quality to have.  heh.  done for now.

      "i just kept hoping it would get better."   she's so strong. she blinked away tears and just kept shaking her head. we talked about familiar things..  i mostly just listened. again..   again she said to me..  "i just kept thinking..  things will get better eventually."    after 30 years..  my mom plans to escape her  hell , her marriage to my dad.    she's trying to start up her own business and has lots of vegetables and such planted at home.  she said after the summer, when that's finished..  she's walking out on him.  she's considering 2 different living situations, going to answer some older people from church whether she could rent a room from them.  suddenly i was reassuring my mom she could stay at my place anytime.  heh.  never imagined doing that.    (my computer hasn't worked all evening and i can't get it fixed so i don't want to type much....  i imagine it will crash on me at any  moment.)  mom kept talking about how unimportant my dad has made her feel..  how unwanted..  it was perhaps a week ago that i was speaking those words to lindsay.  my head was spinning during our entire conversation.  i stood close to her and watched her face.  my heart hurt a lot.  i wondered some after our conversation had come to a close..  my dad has always made my mom and i incredibly uncomfortable.  no matter what/how/when/why/etc. we're doing something...we FIRST weigh whether it will anger my dad.  will the noise be too much?  will this interrupt him?  will he scream because i accidentally did this?  on and on and on it goes.  walking on egg shells my entire life.  i'm really good at entering a room and scanning him quickly to see what sort of mood he's in..what will make him angry.     anyway..  i'm rambling and this isn't completely coherent.....  but i wonder..  because i hate all of that so much.   i wonder if i push the limits to see just how far i can go before someone will get angry with me.  (namely, a significant other)  i mean, do i intentionally try pissing him off to see if he's what i want in the long run.  i refuse to live the rest of my life with someone, ANYONE that responds in that manner.  this isn't making sense, i can tell.  maybe i push and push just to see what the limits are.  maybe.  because i don't want to try making someone happy for the rest of my life.  i don't want to constantly be nervous and worried that i'll make him angry.    i remember a fight between my parents years ago.  i walked into the kitchen and dad had my mom tipped backwards in a chair and was choking her.  i remember the screaming later.  mom sobbing about all the times he's cheated on her..  sobbing about how he didn't want me.  when i was little..  during those fights...  those frequent fights..  dad would sometimes cry and scream in my face telling me he hoped i liked my new daddy better.    and now..  i sit alone..  like every other night..  and i ponder whether there really are people out there that are just plain happy.  in a pure, unadulterated way.  do people really find one another and stay together and love one another selflessly?  i have my doubts.  feeling quite cynical.  i want that.    i want that. does it exist?    at the top of this blog it used to say..  "Happiness, it still exists, did you know?"  i thought maybe i'd found it.  and yeah, yeah...  happiness doesn't come from another person.  but bear with me here, k?  you know what i'm getting at.   i think.  that line has been taken from the top of this blog.  it was taken awhile back.

      in a past relationship, it was rare for us to fight or argue..  but i can remember one distinct instance where i felt very hurt and i stormed out of his home.  once outside i slowed my pace considerably and did that silent prayer that he would follow me...that he would come after me..    he didn't.  i got in my car and sat.  i waited.  my passive-aggressive ways slapped me in the face. he never came. he never came after me.

      no, am not doing okay..  thank you for asking.  i dreamt of lindsay last night.  in my dream he was working at a supermarket and i kept going there in hopes of seeing him but every single time i went...he successfully avoided me.  finally he saw me.  he saw me and stared and then i successfully avoided him.  i walked away.  in my dream lindsay had aged by about 20 years.  it was strange how my brain aged him.  even in my dream my heart was sent aflutter.  i don't remember how it ended..    did it end?

      the firstborn my heart will call   Truly  . a godlike boy of the sky. the fog hissed away like a movie. and serpents go home for the night. the thunder cloud  rain  hits the freeway. and the clouds put on makeup for show. the nightfall my skin crawl kind of evening. yeah, howl the wind she blows.. howl the wind she blows. but i want you to  come in closer ..come in closer..    i woke up about half an hour ago.  i had been having some pretty intense nightmares.  when i woke up i was gripping the phone and a metal bar on my head'board.'  i could hear it storming outside so i threw on some clothes and went downstairs with my phone.  i sat on the front porch and called lindsay and left a voicemail....merely to let him hear the storm.  i'm silly but once i hung up it seemed to only get louder and more showy and i wished i were still leaving a voicemail so he could hear the loudest cracks of thunder.  i love it.  i think i'm gonna lay down and listen to it storm some more.  i'm tired..  so tired.    and our souls become useless as the day they were born... but still the  truth  remains lethal. a lie made by men - -  where my shoes become hammers and my words become sand. i'm like a sour patch a wedding batch of roses you threw across my floor.   in the rusted arm rocking chair. away from your  storm . but i want you to come in closer..come in closer..

      i've decided i take on too much. some friends went out tonight and i wasn't invited.  no big deal.  i just took it a little personally. i've been trying to get ahold of lindsay and he's nowhere to be found.  i've also taken this a bit personally.   what is my fucking deal? i feel really unwanted in every direction i turn. i saw a bumper sticker at the health food store today that said "giving is living" and i thought to myself, yeah right!  am i just being selfish?   this blog just goes in a big circle.  there are moments of happiness and then i'm drowning again. i admitted to lindsay today that i'm starved for affection and his response was....  "yeah, me too."  what?!  heh.  i feel like i pile on affection....sometimes in disgustingly large quantities.  he's distant.  perhaps he meant physical affection?  i'm starved for it in any manner that it comes.  physically, emotionally, mentally, etc.    a kid i work with asks me daily for a hug.  i always tell him no.  i feel like a cold-hearted bitch but i always say no.  i refuse to settle for the only hug i ever receive being from a 16 yr. old boy that is locked up that i work with.  i am overwhelmed with unhappiness and the guilt follows because i feel like it's my own damn fault.  you can throw every  cliche` in the book at me.  "you have to find happiness within yourself.  you can't rely on others for your own happiness."  i know all of this.  i do.  i'm just either having a hard time putting it into practice or it's just the loneliness that is driving me mad.    read  urlLink this .  i really feel like that.  read  urlLink this .  there are huge things in that post i can also really really really relate to.  it seems like any emotion i have, aside from happiness, turns to anger.  whether that be disappointment, nervousness, loneliness, frustration, impatience, sadness, anything...  all comes exploding out of my pores in anger.  i disgust myself..really.  i guess i'm talking only about negative emotions.  they seem to be all that i'm familiar with anymore..then i look around and physically...i should just be happy.  i have a home, it has a roof that doesn't leak, i've been able to pay my bills ok, there is some food in my refrigerator, i have 2 parents that love me, i have a cat that puts up with me, plentiful jobs (even if they suck), etc.  i should just be overwhelmed with gratitude for all those things...but instead i sulk and paw at existence....wishing more than anything for happiness...with a job, with friends, with a love.  i want to wake up to someone, that is no secret.  and i want his heart to pound whenever he sees me across the room.   i am like so many others.  allow me to write about it, ok?  allow me some sort of venting.  if you hate it...just don't read it, k?

      hi. last nite i spent some time creating and writing a lovely little piece and just in time my computer gobbled it up and booted me.  i was sad but oh well.  just um..  lettin' you know.  instead, you'll get some daily rambling.  i've just created something else, of the edible variety.  i made a smoothie in my not-very-long-ago purchased blender.  it only has strawberries, a banana, the juice of an orange and some non-fat plain yogurt.  it turned out perfect but it's too thick to drink...therefore i get to eat big, yummy bites of it out of a spoon.    i've been reading  urlLink compassion over killing's     urlLink vegetarian starter guide .  soon the 3 weeks will begin.  you should really try clicking those things...the 2nd one is really just about why you might want to consider becoming a vegetarian.    i get to shower soon.  i purchased the karma bubble bar from LUSH and it's perfect.  i'm feeling too lazy to link.   urlLink joelle  had wrote about using it over on  urlLink tenth muse   it smells sooo soo good!  i think they seriously wrapped up the essence of who i am and created it into a soap.  it's wonderful!!  she described it as  "orange, lavendar, Lemongrass, Gardenia, Elemi and the thing I usually find stinkiest of all stinks, patchouli!"   thing is..  i love patchouli.  yeah, i'm a hippie from way back.  heh.  anyway, pass the granola.

      they are re-surfacing the road that runs in front of my home.  there's lots of stinky black tar goop and such....sweaty men on huge roller machines, etc.  i guess it IS lunch'ish time 'cause they're all sitting in my front yard in the shade under the big tree.  i've been wearing slinky tank tops so as to avoid rubbing/irritating the cut across my chest.  is this the part where i have to go check the mail and also carry with me some iced tea....cold and dripping with condensation.   ahahahaha.  funny.  um..  NO.    i've been up since 7:30 and really feel like i've accomplished NOTHING.  i called work so as to have all my time sheet stuff correct since i wasn't there at the end of last week.  i took a long, slow walk outside in the morning air.  i emailed 3 friends from high school as i saw one of them yesterday and learned that 1 is in china, the other somewhere else in this state so i wanted to send a hello.  why not, eh?  i haven't seen them for years.  after that i tried reading for a bit but my mind was wandering too much.  i watched a little lame morning tv, dozed in and out on the couch.  i read the usual blogs...posted a few entries in my own.  i've decided to deal with this strange guilt i have for having not accomplished anything mind-shattering today i'll just continue doing absolutely nothing until i go to work this afternoon.  Orrr..  i'll go read the sunday paper.    i hope those worker guys are done in a couple of hours because at this point i see no possible way for me to get out of my driveway.  haha.  oh man.  wouldn't that just really peeve my boss off?  ha.  i love it.

      i woke up grumpy.  i stayed up late because i just could not get to sleep and so after finally sleeping... i woke up late today.  i'm way nauseous and moody.  i've made a conscious decision to have a good day but at the moment am having a hard time slipping out of this darkness.  i guess someday i'll look back and realize how much i should've enjoyed/appreciated this time alone..  or at this rate, maybe i'll look back and laugh and say, HA!  that was only the beginning.     ugh.  i feel myself slinking back again at the first tinge of hurt feelings.  i set myself up for this.  when will i learn?

      it's  been pouring for awhile now.  i sat outside on the front porch in the swing for a long time and just took it all in.  the lightning was putting on quite the show..  still is.  i'm under the softest blanket in the entire world.  tara gave it to me in my random care package.  it's blue with a blue butterfly embroidered in the corner.  that was nice of her, huh?  i've got the hiccups and they're painful.  friday nite..  completely uneventful.  hm.  loud thunder out there..   good sleepin' weather.  heh.

      wednesday involved lots of waiting...and more waiting.  my doc had an open heart surgery before lil' ol' me..so, my surgery was about 3 1/2 hours late.  i asked how it went..he smiled and shook my hand.  i hoped he was at his best.  if i'd just been operating on someone for 6 or 7 hours....i'm not sure i'd be feeling alive, alert, awake, enthusiastic.  i drifted off..    i woke up gasping for air.  eyes refusing to open...several people around me commanding me to breathe.  yes, talk louder...that'll help me breathe better.  yes, talk slower, like i'm 5..that helps also.  oxygen mask, it's pushing into my eyes..  let me move it down a little.  "Don't touch your face!" my hand pushed away.  eyes, refusing to open..mouth shut..  but it's..it's poking into my eyes, damn it.  hands pushed away.  slow realization.  oh, the mask..  it's poking her.  breathe!!  my oxygen levels dropped real low so i got to have a slumber party overnight next to mrs. vomitson.  morphine is accompanied by great nausea.  mrs. vomitson was not my favorite roommate ever.  ew.  a curtain between us with  netting at the top.  i could hear her.  begged inside for her to stop.  covered my ears and closed my eyes.  please stop!    i'm home now.  i'm like frankenstein. i made my dad take pictures so i can show lindsay.  i'm sure lindsay is way way excited.  he should be!  i have potted plants.  thoughtful people gave me potted plants.  i love them over cut flowers.  potted plants.  my skin is tight and moving feels painfully awkward.  i took a pill.  did you miss me?  'alas..  nobody noticed i was gone.  jerks.  i'm back.    oh yeah.  and..  i don't have cancer.   we'll know in a couple weeks what i do have.

      good morning.    (phew.  now that we got that outta the way)  i've been exhausted.  i really just wanted a solid night's sleep last nite.  i climbed into bed at a fairly decent time...set my alarm for an early/non-ungodly time.  so, i blink awake when the alarm goes off and panic sets in.  I've missed something!!  i'm late!!  get up!!  ok, no..  ok, you're ok.  whew.  go back to sleep.  * snooze * um..  yeah.  this pattern continued for an hour and a half...  me pushing the snooze button every 9 minutes (which requires me to throw back my blankets, hop up, walk over to my dresser then walk back to bed and get in)  oh yeah, that was some restful sleep.  sometimes...  i make stupid decisions.  i would've been better off resetting the alarm and allowing myself to sleep a bit.  oh well, i'm up now and i started the day with some really really loud Kanye West.  heh.  yeah, i'll admit..  i love the CD.  #7 is my favorite and i play it LOUD.  MMmmm..  i've been cleaning cleaning because after the surgery i wanna be comfortable...not feeling like i have to do a bunch of shit here.  looking around knowing i should clean...so all of that will be done today as tomorrow is the day.  wee.  no more talk of that..    tara's driving up today.  yay!!  you've seen her name here before...she lives in another city but has a job interview in mine today!!  that's fun fun.    - : - : - : - : - : - : - : -  lots of "soul searching" lately..  is that the term i want?  i s'pose so.  trying to put into action some dreams, ya'know?  some friends left this morning for a week in jamaica and i'm insanely jealous.  it seems any trip i plan never works out and i end up disappointed.  i'm going to the library today.  lindsay reminded me 'cause there may be (surely will be) lots of hurry up and wait while in the hospital.  i was thinking today...i wish i could listen to headphones while they put me out..  i wish i could listen to a song i really love as i slip into darkness.  mm..    i should go clean more.  write something lovely..?

      let me explain a little bit about how i got the idea for "the list."  round about the time all this health craziness started happening...i was working an overnight and a guy i work with asked if i wanted to borrow this movie he had..  i asked what it was about.  he tells me it's about a 23 yr. old girl that finds out she is dying of cancer.  hahahaaha.  GOOD!!  anyway, she does a sort of cliche thing and makes a list of "things to do before i die."  oh sure, lots of people have those lists..  so, i decided to make a list...  mine isn't so much a huge list of things i want to do before i die, but mainly just goals, aspirations..  small and big, long-term and short-term.  i asked that lindsay make a list too and we'd swap.  it was an unofficial way for each of us to ask the other for help..  ie, these are things i'm trying to accomplish and if possible, i need what help you can give me in doing so.  i also thought the list would help me to be more unconditionally supportive of lindsay because he has a very hard time asking for help.  [read:  he doesn't ask for it!]  i'd know where he was at more and be able to help..  but, see..  this isn't really a cop-out..  it's not like the list says..  "I need you to call me 13 times a day and ask if my resume is done because i'm trying to get a better job."  how/why/when/what type of support the other gives is totally subjective..   is this making sense?    also:  i'm embarassed but telling you anyway..  (also explaining this to lindsay)  i had this set-up to shoot me an email whenever the site was updated...that way i'd know if lindsay had written..but..  lindsay doesn't write so i always just got an email telling me i'd just updated the site..  so, i switched the settings today so that they send lindsay an email instead of me.  heh.  that's cheating, eh?  i know.  force-feeding.

      wish i had something lovely to write about but 'alas.. i do not.  didn't feel like writing on here when i was around earlier but i want to now.  took a really long walk to air out my mind but it's still a bit congested up there.  lots and lots of thoughts.  i've been feeling very ill physically the past 48 hours or so....very much last nite but wanted to hide all signs so as not to be bombarded with health questions.  i've never been to the doctor so much in my whole life and it's certainly made me much more aware of my body and it's functioning.  i've stared at myself naked quite a bit, taking in everything about me..  hair, skin, my stomach, my legs, muscles, breasts...all of it.  i think sometimes i'm rushing around so much and doing so many varied things that i don't pause just to be aware of my body.  i've taken note of my insides and what makes them feel good and what makes them feel bad.  reading lots of varied things..  i'll admit the doctor said the word  cancer  more than once yesterday.  i'm still just pretty much ignoring that..   (at least on the outside)  my surgery should be next wednesday.  i spoke with the scheduler this morning and she asked that i call her back this afternoon so we can finalize the appointment.  i was unaware but found out yesterday that my grandpa lost a portion of his lung from cancer and i did already know that my other grandpa has a very serious lung disease.   Ugh.  i guess i've accepted the fact that they'll be cutting my skin and invading it with some medical instruments...i won't be nervous until the day of..  however, i'm sick of waiting.  doc told me that once the surgery is done...they may know some things that day but the biopsy being done for cancers and such may take a couple of weeks.  oh.  the waiting.    anyway..  i guess it's not completely necessary for me to drone on about medical concerns right now, but it just happens to be what's going on in my life.  my boss is being way shitty about it.  i talked with her on the phone this morning, trying to give her fair warning about the surgery and she really could care less what's happening to me but is hoping it doesn't cause me to miss work.  she's a fucker.  she's like 2 yrs. older than i am and i'd like to just kick her ass.  i'm capable too.      new topic.   lindsay and i have not spoken.  he's online as i'm writing this and i see him there but we merely stare at one another.  i'm surprised he doesn't have me blocked.  i don't know what to say on the topic.  i miss him.  i love him.  i dreamt last night that he tracked me down..  that it had been a year or so since we'd spoken and he showed up here.  it was one of those dreamy fairy tale things and i know i shouldn't allow my brain such thoughts.  things were better for him...  he was doing great and wanted me in his life....couldn't stand to not have me in his life and so he made the trek here to find me, to be with me.  it was a nice dream but the memory of it at present stings.  i guess deep down that's something i hope might happen.  i have to remove myself from the situation right now because it's just too much.  i'm not strong enough to deal with the daily happenings or...  the daily non-happenings.  i need to feel like someone wants me around..  that someone looks forward to me and i've nothing but a burden as of late.  i'm dealing with some crappy things here...  minor, i s'pose but they affect me all the same.    oi.  i'm babbling on.  going to post this and then work on my list.  i'm trying to decide whether i should still send the list to lindsay.  i don't know.  we were both going to write a list.  i may just post mine here and if he happens to read this site ever...he'll find it.  he's still welcome to be posting on this site but i wouldn't count on that.  going for now..

      i woke up every 1/2 hour or so from 6:30 until 9.  each time i'd first, panic that i'd woken up late for my dr's appt. and then consciously make note of how difficult it is to swallow today then i'd allow myself to fall back to sleep.  i wanted to sleep in this morning and i did, still got up with over an hour until time to get ready.  gee.  i make it sound like a party.  "ooooh!!  i've got an hour until i need to shower and get all cutesy, girly, glam for the surgeon!!"  Ugh.  emphatic ugh.    i had sort of been reading a book with lindsay.  we were gonna read it "together" but i got way ahead and couldn't stop and i only have about 10 pages left but last nite as i raced forward to the end i decided to savor it and save the last bit for the waiting room today.  mom AND dad are coming to the doc with me.  they're in a panic.  i'm annoyed that i forgot to fill out the pile of paperwork they mailed to my house.  and somehow, completely unrelated i'm sure, i'm really sick today.  feels like strep throat (ew).  if the doc has some big revelation today...i'll letcha know.  otherwise, i probably won't have much to say about it until after the surgery and after the biopsy.  what's that movie where the old lady keeps saying..  B B beee OPsy.    i don't remember.  shower time.  feeling much like an old woman today.

      i'll keep this brief..  for some reason i feel compelled to share.  (lucky  you, reader.)  i'm sick.   something crawled up inside my body today and has taken over.  my throat is completely raw, my sinuses feel near explosion, my body hurts, head, the works.  mom called and i tried hiding it but she could tell like moms can and insisted she come get me.  it was all i could do to force myself to keep talking to her.  i wanted to scream at her to leave me alone and hang up.  bleh.  physically i'm a mess.  tomorrow i see the surgeon.   mentally?  well.  let's not go there.  i received my goodbye email from lindsay in my box today.  Bill read the blog and had this to say...  "Two people who constantly ignore one another, then talk a little bit, take out this and that on the other, say goodbye, lather, rinse, repeat..."     yuck.  i say yuck because it seems sadly accurate.

      well.. i've spent the entire morning doing 1 of 3 things.. a)  drinking coffee b)  revamping resume c)  sifting through jobs  i've had some very startling revelations. a)  the only of the above 3 things i'm good at is drinking coffee.  UGH!!  my resume is atrocious and in it's past/current form looks like a stupid fucking word template.  i'm embarassed.  surely i am better than this?  i need help.  i've looked at a bajillion sites that offer aid but they are currently only further complicating things.  Can someone smart that knows me just write it for me?  i'll proofread the spelling when you're done.  big dramatic sigh.  in other not-so-wonderful-or-even-noteworthy-news: i go to the surgeon tomorrow.  yeah yeah, they're doing this biopsy on the mass they found in my chest.  (my chest, not my breast, stupid)  it's no big deal.  seriously.  (this is my mantra...go with it)  my mom has officially freaked out and has told every person around her.  i, however...  have taken a different approach.  i have chosen the "inappropriate morbid cancer jokes" approach.  so, um..  i s'pose we'll see.  i kinda just hate the waiting part, ya'know?    my heart hurts and i'll spare you the gory details.  i've once again allowed my feelings to get hurt and have shoved lindsay away.  not that he was trying to be close, 'cause trust me on this one..  he wasn't.  so, i get angry, my feelings are hurt..  it's really only burdensome to him so..  i'll keep my distance.  oh, i know.  you've heard this before.  i know, it's messy.  such is life, right?  i talk so matter-of-factly so that the drippy insides aren't quite so obvious.  i need to get my shit in order and this 'thing' with lindsay does not serve to help me do so.  that's selfish, isn't it?  same story, different day i guess.  do i shrug and just keep going through the motions for awhile?  after you're finished writing my resume for me..perhaps you could offer some advice..  or just save yourself the time because you know i wouldn't really take your advice anyway.  i'll keep scuttling about like a bug not really knowing which way to go and completely unable to focus on any one thing for any remotely long period of time.  this entry has gotten a bit verbose.  slap me.  slap me slap me slap my ass.  when i "spoke" with lindsay yesterday he informed me i was a completely different person.  i argued that no, i'm just a fed up person.  here's the thing..  a)  i feel completely unimportant in his life.  the people there with him and around him receive concessions, exceptions, appeasements, etc. that i do not.  i guess i feel like if i WERE important in the least, now and then something might get shoved aside for me.  it's not often that i go out.  i work a LOT.  i've hardly talked to lindsay at all and last nite he threw it in my face that i hung out with sarah on monday.  i was home that evening and he did not talk to me but he threw it in my face.  fuck that.  i protested much and FUCK.  there's no use in typing it all but that's not even fair!!  i work so therefore it's my own fault we can't talk?  you can only talk to lindsay on HIS terms....when it's convenient for HIM.  no.  done with that.  really really done with that.  i'd prefer we not talk at all until he has his shit together and i have mine together.  i had sent an email before our conversation on the phone and he typed an email to tell me he'd not read it but saved it so that i didn't retract it.  in the 4 minutes between the time he read the email and the time he sent me another he couldn't have merely read what i fucking had to say?  good god. fuck that.  fuck fuck fuck it!!  i'm tired of hurting all the damn time.  i'm tired of being alone.  i'm tired of the companionship lindsay has by default.  i'm tired of coming home to nothing...to noone.  yesterday i came home from work/the store and to nothing.  no messages on my machine.  no mail in my mailbox.  not even a cat that was sorta glad to see me.  he glanced up at my unceremonious arrival and decided to go back to sleep.  i threw my keys on the counter and shoved that bottle of wine into the freezer next to some off-brand bag of mixed vegetables.  i'm young, single and BORING.  i have the cat, the plants...am only missing the extensive collection of meg ryan movies.  ew.  fuck that too.   i don't know which way is up.  congrats if you've made it to the bottom of this post via the complete route through.  proud of ya.  someday i'll rank high enough on someone's list to get surprised, to feel special.  with my ex-boyfriend of 3 years....it was a struggle for any of that.  it was like being in a long-distance relationship.  he's very  much a homebody and we'd go weeks without seeing one another.  (he lived 10 minutes away)  he never made me feel special.  he never surprised me.  i never really felt like i ranked anywhere on any sort of list.  i'm not asking to be some high-maintenance pretty pretty princess...but holy fuck..  let me know that i matter?  make an exception once in awhile when maybe it's not perfect timing but you just really really want to be with me.  i hope i see that if it happens because i really have no idea what it feels like.    see ya.

      Hi.  i'm here and have been wanting to post about various things but nothing seems to come at the right moment.  on saturday i spent the day with family 3 hours away.  it was ok.  the day was lovely..my family isn't as much and i got to spend hours on my dad's harley with him.  that was fun and then a huge storm came and we parked under and overpass and then i ended up riding back with my mom because they were both being parental and it really was a bad storm.    i've been much too needy for the situation at hand with lindsay.  i'm feeling both frustrated and guilty for being needy.  if he were in a great place and stable...some of my neediness would be balanced and with some of those needs being met...much of it would simply disappear.    - : - : - : - : - : - : -  he's been pretty much exhausted by stress and his emotions lately...whether he'd admit it or not.  i've wanted him so much sexually and have allowed myself to daydream about indulgent pampering i could do to him.  i just picture him exhausted and quiet...  me, quiet and giving..  touching him so soft, spending very slow slow slow drawn out times on his most intimate places yet also easing his most basic muscles.  loving him and loving him and knowing inside that he could feel me overflowing all over him.  knowing that it was seeping into his pores and soothing him...  wrapping him up all safe and warm and comfortable..   i love him.  - : - : - : - : - : - : -  i bought a bottle of wine after work today.  a pinot grigio.  heh.  i'm working on a list.. perhaps more about the list at another time.  hell, maybe i'll even post the list when it's "complete."  it's not an exhaustive list, though.  anyway, how are you?  come and sit a spell with me.  have some wine or i'll make you tea.  eat some food and talk with  me lots.

      cold rain in July, but...  I'm warm inside today.  Something inside has made me glow.  I finally took a steamy shower to knock off the chill.  I was freezing!  I had spent some time curled up on the couch with a little quilt.  I took a long shower.  It's pretty dark and dreary so i even lit some candles.  It's quite the mood in here.  I'd say...this is the place to go today if you're looking for some peace..  if you need to be soothed.  Come, sit, relax.  Listen to good music with me and here..  pack this box!!

      so..  I started moving things into the new place last night.  It's exciting!  Today is a very very strange day for Summer in the Midwest in JULY!  it's maybe 60 degrees outside (not sure it's that warm) and pouring down rain.  It's been raining since sometime in the night and is supposed to do so until like noon tomorrow.  we're in a flood watch.  heh.  The predicted high for today..  69.    anyway, go over to Tenth Muse and donate to Joelle.  She's doing the AIDS Walk in San Diego and has raised some gooood money.  go help.  I'd give you the link but since things got changed here, i'm not sure i know how to give a link all on my own.  i'll try.   urlLink Tenth-Muse   anyway, she's blogging every 30 minutes for 24 hours all in the name of charity.  weeee!!  check check, check it out!

      dad had planned to help me move but called to tell me he can't because he'll be busy moving himself.  It just seems weird, obviously.  Mom had planned to keep 'our' house but has now decided to sell it.  She has an apartment.  did i already write that?  ahh well.  I've got happiness to nourish.  tata.

      today is not the day to get in my way because i will not hesitate to shove you in the trash just like everything else that has gotten in my way or looked at me wrong.  good luck that i could have never imagined has crossed  my path...  i found my REO Speedwagon CD!  Oh Yes.  It's playing as we speak.    I really am being productive.  I went through several drawers and such last night and threw away tons.  I've been up since a bit before 7 today.  I've packed away books, most everything in the bathroom ('cept what i have to use today and stuff) and..  ok.  i guess that's about all i've gotten packed.    I've thrown away so much crap from college.  I've looked at lots of pictures, read critiques of speeches i gave and papers i wrote.  I do feel like this time is different..  I'm smarter and ready to move forward with gusto!  It's cool and cloudy outside, strange weather.  I'm having some tea with a dribble of honey in it.    Hopefully by this evening I'll take a load of things to the new place!!!  Very exciting.    shuffling through all sorts of shit.  old cell phone bills from 4 and 5 years ago..  papers on scholarships, old empty phone cards from my summer spent in alaska, proportion scale from a journalism class, a cassette of my radio show, an old work badge.  god i love throwing things away.

      I just can't seem to get started on this packing business.  Ugh.  I don't even know how to start.  I need a swift kick in the pants.  heh.  I'm going to pretend this blog is keeping me accountable and I'll check back in to tell 'you' my progress later on, k?  great.  fare thee well!!

      i added a bunch of links to blogs and journals i read just about daily.  peruse those links..very fun stuff!!  i've been completely smitten over venison by evening for quite some time.  she has lovely taste.  i love her writing, the pictures, etc.  go look go look!  and, thank you, sarah! i went downstairs today and there was a pretty lime green package perched on my mailbox.  she gave me a wonderful book about dreams.  very nice.

      Last night I took some Tylenol PM because I was hurting a lot and knew I'd struggle to sleep.  I had never purchased these before.  I woke up slowly this morning, went back to sleep several times before finally getting up.    I tried to tidy up my resume, took a really long shower then went to the office of Job #2.  I faxed my resume to a company I learned of yesterday located in the town I'm moving to.  We'll see what happens.  It seems like a nice switch maybe..  i think it's a 9-5 type job, M-F.  I called them to ask about available positions and they told me they're doing interviews in a week.  I hope they call me back for an interview!!    I talked to Job #2 Case Manager for quite awhile..  She tried talking me into staying 2 more months.  I said I'd really give it some thought but that's a lie.  My mind is made up.    Afterwards I made my way to Target (big surprise) and purchased a large box of trash bags for my purging of possessions, some grapes (i love them), some sourdough pretzels and a box of tea.  I'm sipping lady grey as I write this.  It's delightful!  Mmm..  citrusy.  We have a new coffee shop in town..  Cocoa & Beans, so I stopped by there and got a Mexicali.  Mexican Hot Chocolate.  very disappointing.  hot chocolate, cinnamon syrup (very fake flavor) and cayenne pepper.  I want the authentic stuff.  I always think of the movie..  Chocolat, with Juliette Binoche.  Hot chocolate with chili pepper.      So, i only sipped some of it then was done.  I came home and messed around reading online for awhile.  I listened to good music then had dinner with Staci.  good times.  we hadn't done that for quite awhile and we talked a lot.  We went for a drive afterwards in the night air with the windows down..  we drove by my new place then back home.    I intended to start packing and cleaning today but gee, that didn't happen.  I feel pretty gross.  I'm going to finish my tea and then probably head to bed early.  I'll sleep with my hot water bottle tonight.  I hope it will soothe my body.    I want a dog so bad.

      i wanted to call lindsay so bad.  i felt like maybe his voice would be soothing to my bones.  i pondered it for a long time and eventually fell asleep with my phone open in my hand.  i hardly slept.  this is crazy.  i had bad dreams, i woke up in a panic over and over, i'd lay there awake and just think about this place..  and now, my stomach is in suffocating knots, i'm nauseous, i've got a headache..  all because i'm freaking out about this job that i hate.  and inside, i feel like a really lame quitter.  but my god, even on the worst days of my former job...i didn't feel like this.  i've thought about the logistics of putting in my 2 weeks but then i start wondering if I could make it 2 weeks.    what have i done?

      I think if I met me..  I wouldn't like me.  I'd avoid conversation with me.  I probably wouldn't answer calls from me.  I wouldn't want to hang out with me.    I really think I hate people like me.  I've had nothing good or relatively pleasant to say anytime at all lately.  All I can say is that I worked very very hard today and got a whole lot accomplished for Job #2.    My dad showed up tonight out of the blue.  I had just slowly climbed the stairs to my place and he called to tell me he was outside.  We spent some time together...talked a lot.  He talked a lot about the Biker Gang trips he's been on lately...told me about the nickname they've given him.  It's..   "Pit Bull."  The idea made me laugh but he seemed very proud.  He spoke about the divorce a lot.  He told me about all the TV dinners he bought since he "lost his cook."  bleh.  He referred to my mom as his cook.  Grr.    Silly sidenote:  I rode my dad's Harley with him tonight.  He handed me a helmet...I put it on.  I said, "Wow, Dad..  I feel like i could break this!"  He showed me the inside and it said..  "This is a novelty item!  This is NOT to be used as a safety device."  I was a little shocked.  My dad is so insistent on not wearing a helmet that he's bought a fake, TOY helmet...  I got a little angry.  My dad said geez, trust me!!  I know this is the part where lindsay would criticize me for getting on the bike anyway but hey, we've all got our problems, huh?  leave me alone.  I got on and felt weird, like..  my dad was consciously taking the risk of hurting me.  I would've preferred the over-protective, bundle me up sort of thing.  I told him Mom would be really pissed if he killed me.  So, I'm ashamed that I got on anyway but I didn't feel like making him mad and it's so easy to do and..  he just yells so loud.  I didn't want it.     I'm tired.  It's affecting me greatly.  I feel myself once again sinking and drowning in my own mirey mess.  Thick, gloppy, bubbling, gurgling unhappiness.  It envelops me and I can't seem to get to the surface.  I need something really really happy and stable to just help me a little.  Something overflowing with optimism and strength..  Just, help me a little.  I promise I'm not always like this.  Sometimes I'm a really happy person.  Sometimes you can never catch me not smiling.  I just need a little bit of help digging myself up out of this.  I'm up and down..mostly down.  When will I get better?  When will I feel healthy and happy?  When?

      i can smell the coffee...hear it dripping..  it's somehow comforting.  i just sighed really big.  i guess all that time i spent here complaining could've been spent outside working and such..   oh sure, i could "take time for myself" but...  there's no time for that.  I would only be burdened with guilt and flooded with the thoughts of what i "should" be doing. so do i really want to lift my foot up and shoot it right through then stare at the smoking hole?   i'll pass.

      i do not even know where to begin regarding the new job.  let's just say..  i'm terrified that i've made a really horrible mistake.  i took a paycut and fear that i absolutely fucking abhore this job.  i feel stupid.  i'm ready to peel paint off the walls with my nails.  i'm beyond exhausted, have worked 30 hours in the past 3 days and my 2nd job is at me about all of the things that must be accomplished tomorrow (my 1 day off).  shitty shitty shitty.  today was supposed to be my day off but NOPE!  i don't know what to do.  I think that i will make a bit of coffee and get outside and start working.  there's so much to get done and i can't dig up a single soul to help me.  that's a crappy feeling.  i'm feeling very ungrateful, i think.  i start having thoughts like..  why give of my time so freely when i can't even scrounge up help for myself when it's needed??  but that's selfish and i dunno, we should give without looking for something in return and that's not really my point i just need a little help tomorrow please at my house all morning, all afternoon, part of the evening....all evening tonight, please?  heh.  what a mess.  i just want a little rest.  tomorrow will be spent working like a crazy person and sunday i go back to the new, insane job.  when i arrive at work they hook me up to a bag much like you might see when donating blood.  for the remainder of the evening they steadily drain from me anything they can get their grubby little fingers on.    i'm done being a whiney little girl now.

      it's been a really awful morning.  i'm exhausted and have just thrown up.  my stomach is going nuts and i found out last nite after having worked a very long day that today will be equally as long, 10 hours.  'alas..  it wears me out and knots up my stomach even more.  i'll write perhaps more about all the goodbyes with my boys at work last night.  it was maybe one of the saddest things i've seen.  my heart is still hurting.  not prepared to start this new job already.  thank you for the good luck, lindsay.    here goes.

       likes.   - iced coffees  - new CD's  - pictures taken via camera phone  - surprise, anonymous packages left on my porch for me.  - water  - lightning bugs    dislikes.   - droning on and on..and on..   and on..  - houses that remain a literal oven even after sunset.  - irresponsibility  - mosquito bites  - loneliness.  - feeling needy  - being made to feel stupid  - laziness   fell asleep on the couch for about an hour.  the couch is positioned in front of the window unit A/C and thus seemed the only place semi-cool this evening.  even then, i awoke sweaty and confused.  i rolled around miserably, ended up on my hands and knees...finally stumbling off to the bathroom over in the stifling side of the place.  good god it's hot in here!  it's miserable.  i've acquired quite the belly-ache since i fell asleep.  i  dined on grapes and a torn piece of french bread for dinner before the nap.  my hamster is dying and it may seem quite silly to you...but it's very sad to me.  i feel like i must not have taken good enough care of him..  however, i've had him a year and a half or so and who knows how old he was when i got him.  just now i wanted to comfort myself and prove that he'd probably outlived his little life-span anyway but it says that black bear hamsters can live 3+ years with "proper care."  man.  sadness.  i said something mean to lindsay but i feel it's true and was necessary.  really, i don't know what to do.  i may fall off the edge of the planet soon.  I seem to only be causing each of us misery.  i see NOTHING changing anytime soon and I feel foolish for hangin' around.  I don't feel like it's healthy for me or for him.  Most often I feel like I'm a part of his life when convenient and..  ok, it's gotten old.  no more.  on 2 of the blogs i read...they're a couple, on again, off again and described it as "a sickness."  I agree...  I have the same sickness..perhaps even moreso.  we are on again, off again..  lather, rinse, repeat, right?  yes..  I fear I must go.  I get strong and make these leaps..  have to stick with  my decision.  perhaps a set amount of time for Myself, personally..   1 month.  2 months.  6 months.  i don't know..  I told lindsay I feel as though he's an alcoholic and i do nothing but supply his alcohol..allowing him, helping him, silently encouraging him to stay that way.  his only response was "ugh." and he signed offline in my face shortly after.  beautiful.  yeah, i'm teetering at the edge now..  i'll leap soon or perhaps i'll get shoved from behind.  i feel like it's so ugly..  this thing we've smashed together in the dark and tried calling a relationship.  it used to be the most beautiful thing i've ever known in all my existence but now it feels ugly, perhaps beyond repair.  there's a part of me that never wants to hear from him again unless the situation is completely different than it is now.  slap me.  i've said these things before.  This is not new information.  I bounce around unknowing.  I guess I just feel like with this new job, a new schedule..maybe I'm getting some more of my shit together and my heart and mind should be a part of that.    I think I could vomit.  my fingers feel swollen..i'm gulping down ice water.  so hot.  so very very hot.  sad and angry inside.  confused and yelling at myself internally..  decide.  figure out what the fuck to do!  i can't ask for advice.  I don't want to ask for advice.  I don't want advice.  I want to know what's best for me, what's ultimately best for him.  I can only decide for me.  he's fed up with me it seems.  I easily anger him and i think often it's quite intentional on my part.  I don't know.  but I do think I have to go..  out of here..  away.  again, drop off the face of the earth.  i hate myself for being needy.  i hate it.  i think it's ugly.  rufus wainwright is serenading me.  if only my name were 'natasha.'

       I'm poor and I'm needy..  I been lookin' for water. It's nowhere to be found. Pour Water. Thirsty Soul. May rivers of living waters flow. Under barren heights of my soul.    I feel myself sinking again.  I feel suddenly overwhelmed.  I am a serious emotional rollercoaster.  I told someone last night that I feel a bit bi-polar.  heh.  I'm in constant turmoil and confusion over lindsay.  he knows this..  he is annoyed by this.  i'm annoyed by this.  I'm weak and I don't stick to what I say for very long.  That's a really awful way to be..  but I'll make up my mind and cut off all communication with him and it's not ever very long before we're back in the same groove - this groove that i hate.     dark clouds are forming..on the horizon. i see the signs that i know.. a storm is approaching. the trees they are dancing. and the wind starts blowing. rain now is falling and the waves they are a'pounding.   i could be getting more out of life, right?   This is all my own fault, right?  This intense unhappiness that drowns me..  that's my own doing, right?  I have some pretty strong self-dislike going on right now.  I never seem to get out what I'm trying to say.  Should I see a counselor?      sun is a'risin on a color-filled horizon. it illuminates the land.. exposing it's condition. and the truth that i see now.. is sobering but clear. All you had built is gone,  not a single thing left standing.

      i remember reading someone's blog once and they had specifically made mention of the idiots that post pictures of their cats and such.  oh well..the camera frenzy is upon me.    wednesday is my last day at my current job.  I told my boys on Saturday that i'll be leaving.  they all just sat and stared without saying a word.  i was all cool and stuff until they just staredd, unblinking...  and so, then the tears started.  After awhile my one on one so eloquently shook his head and let out a long "DAaaaaamnnn."  heh.  awww.  damn.  maybe he'll miss me.  it's so weird to be leaving.  my group leader, some of my co-workers..  i could care less about them..  but my kids?    Sad.  they got all excited when i asked their permission to snap photos.  they responded by instantly striking poses.  with confidentiality laws i needed their permission.  they're good kids.  i will miss them.  i hope they accomplish wonderful things...at the very least stay safe.

      Wackiness: 20/100 Rationality: 0/100 Constructiveness: 80/100 Leadership: 60/100    You are an SECL--Sober Emotional Constructive Leader. This makes you a politician. You cut deals, you change minds, you make things happen. You would prefer to be liked than respected, but generally people react to you with both. You are very sensitive to criticism, since your entire business is making people happy.  At times your commitment to the happiness of other people can cut into the happiness of you and your loved ones. This is very demanding on those close to you, who may feel neglected. Slowly, you will learn to set your own agenda--including time to yourself.   You are gregarious, friendly, charming and charismatic. You like animals, sports, and beautiful cars. You wear understated gold jewelry and have secret bad habits, like chewing your fingers and fidgeting.  You are very difficult to dislike.   i found it linked  urlLink here ..    i dunno if i like this.  heh.  (prolly true then, huh?)

      c'mhere.  am feeling a bit fickle and detached today.  i'm not sure that pegs the feeling...but it's pretty close.    lindsay joked about canning peaches and the thought made me grin.  see i'm a small-town girl.  mom canned everything.  heh.  today i thought of bread & butter pickles with stringy onions and peppers in them.  i can see vividly some peaches we picked at the orchard nearby years ago...they were beautiful..  someone had embarassed all the pretty peaches and they blushed.  they'd been peeled and were naked, nestled in sweet syrup with other blushing peaches.  she put away tons of things that we could look forward to having in the dead of winter.  yesterday when i made a really really simple meal (that was delicious!) i thought of natural and hearty.  i like when things are just ripped and torn or roughly cut into chunks and devoured.  the vegetables were like that.  i didn't want them very "tampered" with..  anyway..  haha, bjork is playing on the radio.  haha.  kick me.  i like bjork.  she makes me smile.  people hate her, i know.  haha.  SHH.  SHhHHhhh.  i got a fancy new camera phone and i've been snapping all kinds of photos.  when i'm feeling non-lazy i'll post some here.  any requests?  heh.  oh, who am i kidding..  nobody comments on this site.   come closer.

      i made some delightful food for dinner.  baby red potatoes, big hunks of sweet onion and red pepper and i cut some fresh corn off the cob.  cooked it all up in a grill pan with some olive oil, thyme, salt, pepper and some cayenne.  in the end i decided to sprinkle some of my portion with hot curry.  damn.  it was so good.  do you wish you'd dined at my house tonight?  i'd have bathed you and dusted you with sweet powder before dinner.  i'd soak you in wine and devour you like ripe fruit after dinner.  i'd lavish lovely things on you and peck at your brain.  i'd lick the inside of your mouth and press hard against your skin.  "your tongue in my mouth..tryin' to keep the words from comin' out.."    but you don't care.

      spent the day with my mom.  she showed up much earlier than i expected so now i'm here packing a few things and then heading out to her place.  dad's on his vacation.  all mom really wanted to talk about today was the divorce and that was getting old for me so then she was angry and deemed me officially "in a bad mood."  ugh.  eventually we talked at length.  my dad's been really mean to her lately.  a close friend of hers said the divorce could be final in 30 days.  mom's hopeful.  dad has agreed to go see the lawyer with her.  i guess they're hoping they can save some $$ if they use the same lawyer.  i have no idea how all of this work...and i really hope i never do.  i miss lindsay.  having trouble focusing on anything for an extended amount of time.  i feel rather aloof.  heh.  i read the word panacea.  i read tchottke.  both were daily words..  they only  brought you to mind. i think i've put my finger on my feelings just a bit...  here's the thing...  i saw a "los angeles" t-shirt today and it slapped me.  he flooded my brain..  that's all well and good..but THIS!  THIS is the really shitty part...  see, when i see those things...all they do is scream at me how far away he is..  they flash in buzzing neon that it's another world.  i'm reminded of the unlikeliness of this thing we have 'going anywhere.'  but at 24, maybe i'm acting OLD..  but i think i really only want things that are "going somewhere" from here on out.  if they're not "going anywhere" it seems a waste of my time and their's.   am i crazy?  don't answer that.    i love you, lindsay.  don't be angry with me.  i'm headed to mom's shortly.  there's no computer there anymore, don't forget.  they gave it to bob.  i want to call you but i don't want to hear an angry voice.  we'll see.  i hope the famed package arrives soon.  heh.    and on one more note.  i love things neat, tidy, organized..  why then, am i such a disorderly mess?  everything about me is unorganized and just strewn about all over the place.  dreadful.

      i feel as though i've disappeared. i've been on vacation the past few days and i became 110% withdrawn.  i've not talked to a single soul.  it's eerie but also somehow a bit healing.  on one hand..i feel like a recluse locked in a cave, on the other..refreshed.  lots of alone time, some movies, long showers, the newspaper, a book.  i'm scared of a lot of things.  i've avoided the internet fairly successfully..avoided lindsay and everyone else i know.  i originally planned this vacation so that i could go to a music festival in bushnell, illinois.  that was before my dad planned his vacation and didn't include my mom...so, i backed out on the music festival and decided to stay home.  i called my mom several days ago and non-chalantly asked if she had plans for this weekend.  she had already prepared herself for a holiday alone and such.  she was sooo excited that i had called her.  i made plans for us to go paint pottery, have dinner at this really neat place, go to some neat stores and get my mom some new clothes.    i want to address the issue of lindsay.  i've been unable to bring myself to talk to him.  i called the house lots but never spoke to him as he does not answer that number unless he knows it's me.  i don't know how to explain this at all because the last few times we've talked have been wonderful.  I had been successful at keeping some distance between us until all this job stuff happened and i really wanted his help and advice so i called some.  that's really selfish, eh?  when we don't talk as much i feel like we're better off.  when we started talking more i felt myself slipping right back into that old familiar sink and i kicked it into reverse and spun my tires to get outta there!  and so, the poor guy has no idea why i've not been calling or emailing...but you see, i can't.  i mean, what should i do?  i don't want to allow myself to go back to it all.  it drains me..  it makes me an emotional roller-coaster.  i start hoping he'll call, setting myself up for disappointment.  there's a part of me that wishes we'd never talk again unless he was writing to tell me he was on his way here..  i scold myself endlessly for the things that make me think of him.  yesterday it seemed everything i did brought him to mind..  i watched Mystic River (disappointing, by the way) and read a book we're both reading..  i watched Seinfeld and they were in L. A. talking about Ventura Blvd. and the 101.  see, in reality, folks...  i'd really just like to be with him forever..  but since i don't see that happening..some part of me tells me to just leave it alone altogether.  however, that's impossible..  posting on here has been my passive way of contacting him...sending "cryptic" messages.  heh.  i don't feel like i expressed myself very well in any of what i just wrote.  I didn't get my point across and god knows how i like to try and get my point across!  maybe i'll call him tomorrow.  i hope he gets my package today.    and lindsay..  please try to understand my reasoning?  it may seem screwed up but i'm trying really hard to do the right thing for both of us.  erase all the thoughts of someone else.  heh.  that actually couldn't be further from my mind.  i have just needed this time..  i got needy when i had surgery.  i got needy when making a job decision.  and now, as i watch my parents' marriage end..  i know that i'm really needy and so i force myself not to rely on you because it will be in that one moment that i really need you that i am disappointed and will feel, once again..  as though i'm on the back burner.  so i guess by disappearing for a bit..  i shoved myself on the back burner before you got the chance to.  hell, i threw myself off the stove.    thinking of you immensely but trying to "do what i gotta do."  trust me.  only truths.  trust me..

      have bathed myself in self-absorption today.  soul-searching, thinking, pouring over books, magazines.  i rented a couple movies i've not watched yet...  one of them being  Mystic River .  hi, lindsay.  I was productive early on in the day.  i ran errands, turned in my letter of resignation, sent real mail to lindsay (a surprise!), cleaned some.  i spoke with my mom..  today she met with our pastor and told him about the impending divorce.  her first appointment with her lawyer is early next week sometime and she has talked to somebody about selling our farm.    mom reassured our pastor that i'm fine..dealing with this great and agree with her decision.  i guess most of that is correct.  i really don't know what i'm supposed to think/feel.  my dad asked if i knew already and mom told him no.  he called me twice yesterday and i did not answer because i was scared..  i didn't know what to say to him.  mom said he probably wanted to tell me.  i'm a little sad overall..  both regarding the divorce and leaving my job.  it's true that it drives me insane and often sucks every last drop of life force from me....but i'm obviously attached to my boys at work and always want the best for them.  i plan to write each of them a letter to give them on my last day.    in other news:  i find myself avoiding lindsay.  my insides are sad and needy and i don't want to run to him for nourishment right now.  i'm consciously pushing distance between us just to work on myself and let him work on himself/his situation.  the thing is..  some distance allows me to see things in perspective, i think.  i love him very much, more everyday.  i just cannot, will not jump headfirst back into the pit.  i've wanted to call him all day but decided not to.  know that i'm right here, k?  let my emotions settle.

      "Behind the ostensible government sits enthroned an invisible government owing no allegiance and no responsibility to the people. To destroy this invisible government, to befoul the unholy alliance between corrupt business and corrupt politics is the first task of the day for the one who exercises political leadership wisely and without narrow partisanship"  Theodore Roosevelt,  April 19, 1906

      a collection of things that lindsay has sent me.   will do my best to give all credit.  ....then they froth at the mouth and convulse and die a lingering, horrific death. Whoever does this doesn't see the pain."...  (WARNING:  it's long)   MASS POISONING DOGS IN ATHENS The mass poisoning of stray dogs in Athens, as that city prepares for the Olympic Games, is featured in the Sunday, August 1, New York Post. Julia Szabo's article is headed "Olympic Shame."  We learn: "Greek animal activists allege that the strays, which once numbered between 30,000 and 50,000, are being deliberately poisoned. The Greek government has denied involvement in the dogs' disappearances. But witnesses say they've seen dead and dying animals rounded up by trash collectors. Parks in the city and suburbs of Athens, once teeming with strays, are now mostly empty."  There is a quote from vet assistant Angela Fleming, of the Athens group Caring for the Animals: "Dogs are being left a cocktail of poison in food scattered across the city. It is barbaric. These animals are hungry, so they will eat the bait. And then they froth at the mouth and convulse and die a lingering, horrific death. Whoever does this doesn't see the pain."  Szabo adds, "New Yorker Marijo Gillis does; she traveled to Athens to document it. Her graphic five-minute video, viewable on www.ua4a.org/Greece.mov, depicts terrible animal suffering and is very difficult to watch.  "But Gillis, founder of the non-profit Welfare for Animals in Greece, hopes people will protest what they see. 'Please join me in conveying outrage and shock over the compassionless treatment of animals in Greece,' she urges. To make a tax-deductible donation, call (212) 427-0587."

"Beware the leader who bangs the drums of war in order to whip thecitizenry into a patriotic fervor, for patriotism is indeed a double-edged sword. It both emboldens the blood, just as it narrows the mind. And when the drums of war have reached a fever pitch and the blood boils with hate and the mind has closed, the leader will have no need in seizing the rights of the citizenry.  Rather, the citizenry, infused with fear and blinded by patriotism, will offer up all of their rights unto the leader and gladly so. How do I know? For this is what I have done.

(I'm sorry.  I'm too tired to mess with linking these things)     **************************** EXCERPTS...    ....A few profit motivated media conglomerates now exercise a near-monopoly over television news, newspapers, cable, and the internet....dissenting views and opinions most probably will not ever be aired... ************* ...To get a flavor of how consolidated the industry has become, consider this: In 1990, the major broadcast networks – ABC, CBS, NBC, and Fox – fully or partially owned just 12.5 percent of the new series they aired. By 2000, it was 56.3 percent. By 2002, it had surged to 77.5 percent.... ******************* ....Washington continues to tilt the playing field to favor the biggest players.... ******************* ...Only a few corporations decide what news we can choose. That's like a dictator deciding what candidates are allowed to stand for elections, and then claiming that the people choose their leaders. Different voices do not mean different viewpoints, and these huge corporations all have the same viewpoint – they want to shape government policy in a way that helps them maximize profits, drive out competition, and keep getting bigger....... ***************  ...Safeguarding the welfare of the public cannot be the first concern of a large publicly traded media company. Its job is to seek profits. ... ***************** These big companies are not antagonistic; they do billions of dollars in business with each other. They don't compete; they cooperate to inhibit competition.  ******************* ......Broadcast networks have for years pointed to their loss of prime-time viewers to cable networks – but they are losing viewers to cable networks that they themselves own. Ninety percent of the top 50 cable TV stations are owned by the same parent companies that own the broadcast networks. The media giants are getting a deal from Congress and the FCC because their broadcast networks are losing share to their own cable networks. It's a scam. Second, the decision cites the "diversity-enhancing value of the Internet." The FCC is confusing diversity with variety. The top 20 Internet news sites are owned by the same media conglomerates that control the broadcast and cable networks. Sure, a hundred-person choir gives you a choice of voices, but they're all singing the same song. ************ ....This ability to control the news is especially worrisome when a large media organization is itself the subject of a news story. Disney's boss, after buying ABC in 1995, was quoted as saying, "I would prefer ABC not cover Disney." A few days later, ABC killed a "20/20" story critical of the parent company.....   - - - - - - -    All the Pretty Words    By BOB HERBERT     Bill Clinton told us that  "strength and wisdom are not opposing values." Barack Obama    called America "a magical place." John Kerry said, "The high  road may be harder, but it leads to a better place."     There was no shortage of pretty words and promises at the    Democratic National Convention in Boston last week. But    there's a big difference between the rigidly crafted reality    at the heart of a political campaign and the reality of the    rest of the world.     "Practical politics," said Henry Adams, "consists in  ignoring facts."     The facts facing the United States as George W. Bush and    John Kerry joust for the presidency are too grim to be  honestly discussed on the stump. No one wants to tell  cheering potential voters that the nation has sunk so deep    into a hole that it will take decades to extricate it. So    the candidates are trying to outdo one another in expressions    of sunny optimism.   President Bush and Dick Cheney deride "the same old    pessimism" of the Democrats. Mr. Kerry counters by saying    to the president, "Let's be optimists, not just opponents."     The voters deserve better in an era of overwhelming problems.  Consider Iraq.  ("Exploring Iraq from the inside..  Below this) Neither the president nor Mr. Kerry knows what    to do about this terrible misadventure that has cost more  than 900 American and thousands of innocent Iraqi lives. The    war is draining the U.S. Treasury and has made the Middle    East more, not less, unstable. Dreams of democracy taking    root in the garden of Baghdad and then spreading like the  flowers of spring throughout the Middle East have given way    to the awful reality of bombings, kidnappings and beheadings.   You won't hear straight talk about this all-important matter  from either camp. And you can forget the chatter about an    exit strategy for American troops. There isn't one.     Or consider Afghanistan. Not long ago American officials were  claiming a decisive victory and the Bush administration was  trumpeting the liberation of Afghan women from the clutches    of the Taliban. But the proclamations of success were    premature. Osama bin Laden and the Taliban leader Mullah  Muhammad Omar are nowhere to be found. Warlords and    insurgents are in control of much of the country and the  growth industry is the opium trade. The extraordinarily    courageous group Doctors Without Borders is packing its bags    and withdrawing from Afghanistan after 24 years because five    of its staff members were murdered and the government will    not bring the killers to justice. On Friday the U.S.    government warned American citizens against traveling to  Afghanistan because of the danger of being kidnapped or    killed.   Some victory.     Employment here in America is another topic on which the    presidential candidates will not tell the voters the cold,  hard truth. There are not nearly enough jobs available for    the millions upon millions of unemployed and underemployed  Americans who want and desperately need gainful employment.    The population in need of jobs is expanding daily and no    one has a viable plan for accommodating it. Families are    being squeezed like Florida oranges as good jobs with good  benefits - health insurance, paid vacations and retirement    security - are going the way of the afternoon newspaper and  baseball double-headers.   - These are incredibly difficult issues and an honest search  for solutions can only come from a sustained effort by the    broadest array of America's brightest and wisest men and  women. What the U.S. really needs is leadership that could    marshal that effort.   Unfortunately, we've become a society addicted to the  fantasy of a quick fix. We want our solutions encompassed    in a sound bite. We want our leaders to manipulate reality    to our liking.   So there was President Bush in a hard-hit industrial region    of Ohio over the weekend telling voters, "The economy is    strong and it's getting stronger." And the Kerry-Edwards    team is assuring one and all that "help is on the way."   The voters may deserve better, but there's a real question    about whether they want better. It may well be that  candidates can't tell voters the truth and still win. If    that's so, then democracy American-style may be a lot more    dysfunctional than even the last four years has indicated.   ^ V ^ V ^ V ^ V ^ V ^ V ^ V ^ V ^ V ^  –Robert Fisk     The Prime Minister has accused some journalists of almost    wanting a disaster to happen in Iraq. Robert Fisk, who has  spent the past five weeks reporting from the deteriorating    and devastated country, says the disaster has already happened,    over and over again.     The war is a fraud. I'm not talking about the weapons of  mass destruction that didn't exist. Nor the links between    Saddam Hussein and al-Qa'ida which didn't exist. Nor all the  other lies upon which we went to war. I'm talking about the    new lies.     For just as, before the war, our governments warned us of  threats that did not exist, now they hide from us the    threats that do exist. Much of Iraq has fallen outside    the control of America's puppet government in Baghdad but  we are not told.     Hundreds of attacks are made against US troops every    month. But unless an American dies, we are not told. This  month's death toll of Iraqis in Baghdad alone has now  reached 700 - the worst month since the invasion ended.    But we are not told.   - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - ok, i'm sorry that was ungodly long...but pick some out and read it.  if you read any of the above i'm glad.

      I am unemployed, ya'know?  I rented 2 movies.   I must watch them and write about them later.  Today has been lovely physically.  I woke up this morning..my windows wide open and it pouring outside..  the air is fresh.  It feels like a good afternoon to sit on the couch and watch a movie.  Anyway, I am pretty excited about these 2 movies.  It's been a long time since I'd rented anything it seems and I saw all sorts of stuff there I want to see.  I was craving documentaries as was apparent by the movies I kept picking up.  I realized at one point I had 4 movies and thus put a couple back.  So, the movies are:  The Weather Underground Morvern Callar.  yes, yes, yes!

      It's so pretty outside today.  I've been outside a ton and the house is still all opened up from yesterday.  I love it.  I painted my toenails and then took a nice, long shower.  Mom is s'posed to come over this evening err I'm meeting her somewhere, I think.  I've soaked up some sunshine and fresh air today but I haven't been incredibly productive.  I saw my cousin for a bit.  He's lots of fun and works very close to my new place.  He's vowed to come over and hang out though he's leaving in a week to go to Barbados.  He may have to hang out after his trip.  heh.  He's generally out of the country every month or so.       I have to end this now.

      Being on the (rather passive) hunt for a job I feel very  much in a state of advertising myself.  I really hate that.  I feel like I'm pretty horrible at giving myself fair representation.  Last night I dreamt of marriage.  Or did I?  I think I did..  Either I dreamt of marriage last night or had some pretty vivid daydreams at some point.    Just, FYI: I love to keep the house really clean..my organization skills are pretty lacking, though.  Most of the time I crave music and words.  I like to cook and create but don't ever just expect it from me.    I want a dog badly.  I picture it daily...happy times with a dog.  Ahh.  ahh, nevermind.  I don't even want to finish this post now.  I started to get all sexual here and decided just to end it while i'm ..  'ahead.'  ugh.  bye.  oh, I called the local school district about Substitute Teaching.

      I just don't know anymore.  It seems so futile sometimes, ya'know?  Have I become a quitter like so many other people?  blech.    I've been productive this morning.  The house smells fresh..a bit like lavender and freshly mown grass.  The weather is perfect today and I'm happy to have the house all opened up with a breeze in every room it seems.  Mmm..   Bless August in the Midwest for allowing a day like today.    I'm fairly thoughtful today.  There's a lot on my mind.  Good, Bad &  Ugly all together.  I'm kind of scared of the unknown today.  People hadn't been asking much but now every conversation around me starts with..  "SOoo, got a job yet?!"  I answer no.  My uncle says, "Oh, then are you playing the lottery?"  No.  Oh, he says..  well you should do one or the other.  heh.    I'll wash my new sheets today.  That's exciting because I've been sort of saving them for dessert.  I had just washed my current set of sheets the day before I purchased these so I had to you know, live out the week with those sheets.  heh.  Then I can wash them and fold them up to be put away.    lindsay is a sad topic to me.  I fear he's given up.    I'm really tired of being alone day in and day out.  Nobody anticipates my arrival home..  I've noone's arrival to anticipate.  I should be ok with this, right?  Bask in the solitude.  Sun myself in the single life.  This is what I wanted when I was a kid..  to be alone for awhile..  to support myself, to be independent.  I saw the way my parents were and vowed to never be the same.  I never wanted a man to have material for throwing in my face that he supported me, that I couldn't make it without him, etc.  I'm not saying it's ok for a guy to do that if he's the bread-winner...I just didn't want it.    Somewhere inside today I'm happy.  I still smile at tiny things like hearing my wind chimes outside.  I'm hopeful and still excited at fresh starts that abound..  but naturally, I'm nervous and approaching things with caution.

      Yes.  That's a word.  shuddap.    So, I went to a concert tonight with my dear friends Staci & Sarah.  It was loads of fun and it was held in this amazing vintage theater that has statues up high and all sorts of scroll work and dim lighting and such.  I love it.  The last time I was there the walls were adorned with candles and incense was all over the place..  definitely something I can dig, ya'know?  During this concert Sarah and I talked about some other concerts coming up that I want to see.  This unemployment thing does have it's good points.  I hope to have a job with a regular schedule so that I can start doing these things that I love like....exploring all sorts of lovely music venues!  Mmm..  Music.  It's the thing that just truly makes me so happy inside.    There was this annoying-as-fuck girl in front of me and she was flailing all about.  She bounced up and down, slapping me in the face or my tits everytime.  Grr.  I gave her mean girl stares.  Random:  She had this stupid sticker on her stupid little purse that said..  "I got my EYES tested today!!!"  and it has little eyeballs all over it..  I started pretending I was going to steal that damn sticker and Staci & Sarah were very adamant that I STOPPITRIGHTNOW!!   well, kids..  I got that fucking sticker.  OH yeah.  that's right..  I peeled it right off her stupid little girly purse...  You know the kind I'm talking about...the short ones that barely come lower than your armpit?  Yeah.  so, it serves her right..all the damn tit hitting and flailing and she smelled like ass..  so her sticker is mine.  There was another girl,  yes..you, the girl in the burgundy tank top with the curly ass air all up in that too perky ponytail..   Yeah, she was definitely not Sure.  whew!  stank ass girls.  Sarah decided Suave should do some sorta promotion at concerts and pass out cute little sample deodorants so all the sweaty  bodies wouldn't smell so bad.  good idea.  As for me, I use Dove deodorant and it seems to work well..I'm not stanky, though I would like a shower now.  Must plan for more musical outings.  Mmm.

      i've been on the phone with mom for a long time.  she called and I could tell she'd been crying.  i'll admit i instantly started to dread the conversation which was about to take place.  dad emptied his closet today and some other bits of the house.  she came home from work and those things just hit her hard..  she said, "As rotten as he's been..he's been a part of my life for 32 years."  She cried a lot and i'm sad for her..  I'm sad for my dad..  and I'm a little sad for me too.

      Dr. Mr. Teenage Bagger Boy at the grocery store I must now shop at in this new town I reside in,   Please note a few things when sacking my groceries. 1) Please do not use such items as my grapes and tomatoes as a foundational base for the rest of the items I've purchased.  2) Please do not place every single solitary heavy item I've purchased into 1 bag.  3) No, the baguette should really not be folded in half like that in the bag.    Thank you very much in advance, aimee.    - + - + - + - + - + - + - + - + - + - + - + -   and now..  may i just tell you..  everyone i saw in the store looked like they were on meth.  This may be due to this city's proud ranking as the "Meth Capital of the World!"  woo hoo!!  They line that trophy up alongside the ones earned in their bowling league.  People seemed to stare at me strangely.  heh.  I stick out because I don't look like I've had a hit of meth anytime recently.  shame.  i'm being mean.  Going to the store was a big outing for me today...and i must say..  I was glad to be back home afterwards.  heh.  I'm acting like a cranky old lady.  Hopefully I'll be productive this evening.  That seems to be my eternal quest..  to be productive!!  Pretty soon that phrase really starts meaning nothing, eh?        I want to write something pretty later..  or maybe ugly.  something other than the mundane banter of my day.

      Hi.  Good Evening.  Hello and such.  I'm happy to tell you that I'm 100% moved out of old apartment, it is spickety span clean and we've said our goodbyes!  I'm so glad glad glad!  This evening has been very, very productive and I'm proud.  I'm worn out, which seems to be the norm as of late, but done.  Of course now I need to unload everything and continue with the task of putting everything away and having it organized.  I much prefer that to packing it up and moving it, though.  This seems more..  fun!  heh.  I came in just to sit down for a few minutes but am headed back outside shortly to unload everything into the garage for tonight.  I'll start pecking away at it tomorow...slowly but surely.  I'm sure you're thrilled to hear all of this.    Afterwards I plan to take an extra long bath and have some tea again.    Final exciting news of the day..  I bought new sheets!!  They're the softest fabric you've ever felt in your entire life and so light and just..  absolutely wonderful!

      I have so many things to do.  Overwhelmed.  There's this headache that creeps into the left side of my head.  i don't understand it and it's become a regular intruder.  I'm really not one to get headaches.  I sound puny.  heh.  I've been drinking lots of water in hopes that perhaps my brain was merely thirsty.  That didn't help.  I went to sleep with this pain and now it's returned.  Ugh.  I crept off to the kitchen a bit ago.  I made a cup of tea with a bit of milk and honey, watered all the plants and placed a few in front of the back door for sunshine, turned on some music and now i've returned.  I've missed having my own computer to write on daily.  I enjoy those trips to the library but it's very limiting as far as what I  can look at and read.  heh.  Many of the blogs I read would come up with a warning that I was not allowed to view pornography there.  Heh.  oh well.  now I can peruse all the porn i like!!  in my underwear with a cup of tea no less.  Strangely enough, they don't allow that at the library either.  I know, I don't understand it either, pretties.    I have stories seeping out my pores but my brain doesn't want to spend much time on them.  I'll tell you a short one.  Last week during one of my trips to the grand ol' library, i sat tip tip tippity typing and noticed someone walking by me..  he happened to catch my eye and i glanced up in time to make eye contact with him.  He was an old gentleman and as soon i looked at him his face lit up with a grin and he began chuckling some.  He headed straight for me and I assumed he'd caught sight of someone he knew behind me.  I tried to go back to what I was doing but quickly realized I was his target.  He kept chuckling the whole way and when he got to me he extended his hand to shake mine.  I did the same shortly after and he started looking around the library to all the other patrons and patting my hand stating over and over..  "Good People!  Good People!!"  I guess he was informing the others that I'm Good People?  I don't know but he happily wandered off afterwards leaving me a bit bewildered.  heh.  Sometimes I really enjoy people.    I've been exploring the area  a bit.  It's strange because I lived in this area until I was 5 and then we moved away..  now i'm back.  I live on the old side of town so there are a few quirky things to be discovered.  A week ago I snapped a photo of this old abandoned factory  with a large sign at the top that says, "Ramona's Plush Toy Co."  It made me smile.  This tea has warm fingers that slipped up inside my head.  They've attempted to soothe my brain.    I have so many things to do in various places..  at my old apartment, here at the new house, at my parents' house, etc.  My dad totally stood me up after he'd said he'd help me move and he called yesterday demanding I get over there as soon as possible to help him move.  My mom insists that I tell him no after he was shitty to me but I told him I'd help.  I haven't even mentioned him lying to me and then not helping me a single bit.  He knows he did it but I feel like he should know that I'm aware of it as well.  Yuck.  The whole thing is just messy.  It's only going to get messier for awhile.  July 30th was my parents' 30th wedding anniversary.  Um..  Nobody Celebrated.  heh.    god.  i'd rather be writing about sex.  and i'm sure you'd rather be reading about sex..  or having sex.  heh.    I can't believe it's August 3.    i want a dog so bad.  Will you make me another cup of tea?

      wow.  It's August.  i'm sitting indian style on the floor of my bedroom.  strange things happen to the lights when i plug in my computer in the little "office" room and thus, i'm here for now.  it's quite the dilemma.  There is not nearly enough space in here amongst my other things to fit a computer desk and computer.  dreadful.  regardless of all that, though..  it's nice to be coming to you from my own computer at my own house, not some whacked out, security-ridden one at the libary.  ugh.  however, i will admit i was enjoying those nerdy trips to the library.  i checked out some more books.  mmm..  unfortunately i've not had a lot of time to delve into them just yet.  things are just in upheaval all over the place.  mom is moving.  dad is moving.  my best friend just moved.  and i'm actually still trying to finish up the moving i had to  do.  my apartment is in disarray..  as is much of the rest of my life at the moment.  i hope you are well and perhaps i'll write something interesting later.  i spent the night at my former apartment last night and have not yet slept.  i was quite productive and was out mowing the yard at 7:30 this morning but now it's all hitting me..  bowling me over and shoving me into my bed.  i'm tired and not feeling well.  hm...  back later, perhaps.
