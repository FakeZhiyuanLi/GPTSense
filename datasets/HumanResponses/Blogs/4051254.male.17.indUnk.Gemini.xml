       Today I got a system installed in my car; a Rockford P2002 amplifier (200W RMS @ 400W peak) powering two 12" Rockford subs.  Dear God this thing hits hard!  I cannot believe the power behind this system - I actually have the subs set to half of their power as to not overpower the speakers.  For under $600, I was completely dumbfounded at what an awesome system I got.  I never expected such a difference.  Aspen Sound did a great job all around; pricing, customer service, and install.  They've definitely found themselves a returning customer.  I was even offered an upgrade on my amp within 60 days; for $50 I could move up to the Rockford P3002 amp which runs at 300W RMS and peaks at 900W.  I went and saw Collateral starring Tom Cruise and Jamie Foxx - a great movie.  For its runtime of about two hours, there was never a dull moment.  I usually get antsy, sitting in theaters for over an hour and a half, but this movie had me immersed and I forgot about how uncomfortable I was.  Great movie - Tom Cruise played the bad guy brilliantly.  It was probably the best movie I've seen all summer.

       I was scheduled to have my system installed at 6PM this evening but upon going in early to see if it could be started before my appointment, I was told that they (Aspen Sound) were swamped and my install would probably be pushed back until tomorrow.  So now I'm scheduled to bring my car in at noon tomorrow to get it installed.  After I drop my car off, I think my mom and I are going to go see Collateral.  By the time that movie gets out, my install should be completed.

       I've decided to get the system for my car @ Aspen Sound.  A Rockford amp and two 12" Rockford subs.  I'm bringing it in tomorrow evening at 6 to get it installed - I can't wait!  Nothing is new about my job - no one called me today and I'm pretty sure I was scheduled to work sometime today.  I'm thinking that I'm going to go in tomorrow with my work clothes and quit.  Today I saw another guy who works there and chatted with him for a bit.   He said that a lot of people are getting fed up with the two managers and others are thinking about leaving as well.  I'm rich!  I had a huge cup of change sitting in my room and I finally decided to take it into Fred Meyer and use the Coinstar machine to count it up.  After it was all tallied up and processing fees were taken off, I was $34 richer.  I knew saving all that change would be worth it!

       Yesterday I went into Aspen Sound with the focus of just getting a ballpark figure of how much I'd need to spend to get a decent system in my car to take the bass off my speakers.  Half an hour later, I had put money down on a kickass system including a Rockford amp and two 12" Rockford subs.  By putting money down on the system I was able to save the sale price on the amp and put two subs on hold (which are on clearance).  By the time I get my next paycheck - a little less than two weeks from now - I'll have enough money to get the system.

       I went and saw this movie tonight with a buddy - while I didn't understand some of it due to not seeing any of the previous films, I did understand the gist of it.  It certainly sent chills down my spine a few times..  Work is really turning into a joke.  We have schedules every week, starting on Sunday and going through Saturday.  The schedules are usually posted 3 or 4 days before they start.  However, today was Saturday and the new schedule (starting tomorrow, Sunday) still wasn't up.  How are we suppose to know when we're working?  I'm not going into work - I'll simply wait until they call me and tell me I am suppose to be working, then if I already have plans I'll say I cannot come into work.  How can they expect their employees to come into work when they don't bother telling them when they're working?  If we were on call, it'd be different.  But we're not.  I spoke with two other people who work there and they're doing the exact same thing that I'm going to do.

       Work today was crazy.  One guy walked out during the middle of his shift - he's quit.  Another guy - a manager, is quitting tomorrow.  I don't know what's going on.  I was going to walk out during the middle of my shift but I decided to stick it out for the rest of the night.  I work 1 to 5 in the afternoon tomorrow...I'm thinking that I'll just wait and see what happens.  Can't wait until tomorrow night - going to see Alien Vs. Predator with a buddy.

       I was scheduled to work from 1PM to 9PM today; I went in at my scheduled time only to find out my shift was changed and no one bothered to inform me of the change.  So now I'm working from 4:30 to 11:30 tonight.  I'm so ticked off - I was looking forward to getting home at 9 and just heading to bed; I got almost no sleep last night.  Instead I have to close.  UGH!  Now I'm curious as to if they changed my shift for tomorrow as well.  If they have me working in the evening, I'm going to flat out tell them I can't work.  I've already made plans - in fact I just went and bought tickets for Alien Vs. Predator in advance.  And they'd better give me Sunday off or else I'm going to blow another fuse.  Today isn't a good day.

       Working in this 100-degree heat is torture - not to mention pretty dangerous.  Running around for over two hours at a time with very little water.  Why our managers don't have us switching off every half hour or so I do not know.  The drunk also worked today - he was pretty sober after being told if he came to work with another hangover he'd be fired.  Tomorrow I work a completely horrible eight hour shift from 1PM to 9PM.  Before I head into work I'm going to go to Northtown Mall and buy tickets to Alien Vs. Predator for a Saturday night showing.  A couple of my buddies and I are going to go - that movie looks kick ass.  Hopefully it won't end like Freddy Vs. Jason where both sides prevail.

       I really hate people who come to work with hangovers.  I was originally scheduled to work a four-hour shift, from 11AM to 3PM.  I got called in half an hour early after they sent home the guy who was scheduled to open go-karts due to the fact that he had a major hangover.  Then I had the joy of staying two hours later than my shift was initially set for; the majority of which I spent down at the track in the mid-90s heat.  And it's suppose to get near 100 degrees tomorrow.  Joy.  Have some common sense - if you work early the next day you probably shouldn't drink your ass off the night before.

       There's not that much to write home about.  Worked a noneventful six-hour shift today then I came home and relaxed.  Of interest; I uploaded some pictures from my trip to Hawaii back in May of this year - feel free to browse those pictures by clicking  urlLink this link.

       I picked up my car this afternoon from Aspen Sound after they installed Dynamat in both of my car doors. The difference is amazing. My side mirrors no longer rattle, the door panel itself no longer shakes, the window handle no longer vibrates causing constant rattling, and I can now turn up the volume a few more notches and the bass doesn't get distorted. All for a measily $110. It was the best $110 I've spent on my car.  I had my doubts about it but after getting it installed in my doors, my doubts were erased. Dynamat truly is the single best audio upgrade you can do to your car.  On to a different topic; Edgar Martinez announced today that he'll retire at the end of the season.  He's probably one of the best guys on the Mariners squad right now.  It's rare nowadays to stay with one team for your whole career and Edgar has done that.  I can't wait until he gets inducted into the MLB Hall of Fame; he more than deserves it.

       Being able to relax and not worry about having to do anything - that is the life.  I had yesterday and today off.  Yesterday I went and bought some Dynamat for an extremely low price @ Aspen Sound - the retail price was $100, then they had a 20% sale going on so it was lowered to $80.  Then the guy who helped me out said he could sell it to me for $60!  Awesome.  I just dropped my car off at Aspen Sound to get the Dynamat installed in both doors and it should be ready in a couple hours.  I sure hope the Dynamat will stop my side mirror from rattling whenever I have my window down all the way.

       Tomorrow I may be getting both of my car doors Dynamatted.  What is Dynamat you ask?  It's a vibration-reducing material that you apply to areas of your car that are caused by rattling due to your sound system.  Aspen Sound is having a 20% off sale this weekend so the actual Dynamat kit would run me only $80 and install would be $50 for both doors - a great price when compared to the big boys like Best Buy and even Circuit City.  I have tomorrow off!  I'll probably spend it watching the Brickyard 400 and the hydroplane races @ Seafair which I desperately wanted to go see but couldn't get the time off.

       It has been raining pretty much all of today which made for a super easy work shift; all I had to do was work up front.  No go-karts!   We were about as packed as we could get though; in addition to reserved parties we had two walk-in parties.  It was the busiest I've ever seen it.  Tonight I saw M. Night Shyamalan's "The Village."  Immediately after the movie was over, I didn't quite understand the whole concept.  However, an hour later it just now dawned on me (hey, I've been working a lot of hours!) and I must say, the ending is quite good; right up there with The Sixth Sense.  Addressed to the rainmaker: please make some rain tomorrow between 6 and 11PM!  Thank you!

       Today I went to see an ENT (ear, nose, and throat) specialist about my nose-breathing issues.  Right now, I almost always breath through my mouth which is what is causing the problems with my orthodontics.  Moving on, the ENT guy sprayed something up my nostrils which numbed my whole nose and the roof of my mouth, then proceeded to stick about a foot-long tube with a camera at the end into one of my nostrils.  It felt pretty awkward to say the least.  I got a milkshake on the way home but unfortunately, I couldn't taste any of it due to my mouth being numb.  There's a few bucks I'll never see again.  The results of the exam were that while I am mainly a mouth-breather, it isn't enough to where I should need anything done with my nose.  Some cartilage is bent more than it should be which causes my right nostril to be clogged moreso than my left one, but it was nothing important.  I don't know about you, but that's enough nostril talk to last me a while.

       It's about time.  I just received my paycheck last Friday and it just cleared today - I am finally out of debt!  I owed my mom about $1,000 for my car's tires and rims.  With my last paycheck, it pushed my bank account's balance to over $1,200 so I no longer owe anyone any money!  Today I was called into work an hour early by my general manager.  I arrived at work and the manager asked me why I was clocking in an hour early; I told her I was called in.  She said that she doesn't need me until around 2 in the afternoon (it was noon) when a 3-hour adventure party was coming in.  Once again our schedule is screwed up.  But hey, I got paid to stand up front and do pretty much nothing for an hour so I can't complain.  I have tomorrow off!  I've earned it too - it's the only day I have off this week.  When this week is over, I'll have worked about 35 hours.  A big paycheck is in store!

       I worked a 7-hour shift today @ Wonderland, from 2 to 9 in the evening.  I was down at the go-karts for the first 5 hours of my shift before I got a half-hour break.  Then once I clocked back in I had to go down to the shop and make spare tires for another hour before I was finally able to go up front and sit around until my shift got over.  I was thinking about playing poker with some buddies but after running around all day at work, I am pretty exhausted and would much rather call it a night and hit the hay rather than lose some money.  A movie that looks pretty decent is The Manchurian Canidate starring Denzel Washington - might try and go see that tomorrow night.  Tomorrow I'm only working a 5-hour shift from 1 to 6, then Thursday I have the day off as I have an initial exam for orthodontist-related crap.

       Work today sucked.  I was scheduled to work from 11 to 4, but I was held for an hour longer as our schedule is always messed up and they needed someone to run the go-karts until another guy came on at 5.  It was only suppose to be in the mid-80s today but it was a lot hotter than that - and humid as hell.  Then we had a duststorm.  At about 6:30 there was a severe thunderstorm warning on all channels - I looked to the south and all you could see was a brown wall.  Once it hit the whole sky turned brown...it lasted for about 45 minutes.  It was pretty odd.
