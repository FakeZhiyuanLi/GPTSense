       urlLink ABC 7 News - Gay-Rights Activists Denied Communion   This is truely a travesty.  In order to understand why, we must examine some key issues.  Now, I'm a Roman Catholic, and while I consider myself to be a reasonably devout follower of my faith, I would be lying to myself if I didn't acknowledge my faults.  For example, I do not attend Mass every Sunday.  I have a deep-seated hatred of my father.  Both of these are considered to be sinful, and you know the rest of the story.  When you really get down to it, these things exclude me from accepting communion, unless I've just went to confession.  I have clear faults.  Why should gay activists and pro-choice/pro-gay marriage politicians be denied the Eucharist and not me?  Perhaps church officials might spin it into terms of a politician helping a sin proliferate.  While understandable, the fact of the matter is that there are rogue bishops now authorizing the Eucharist to be used as a political weapon.  Besides any biblical objections there may be (and they're there, basically God is a god of tolerance, but I'm too lazy to look up verses :), these Catholics refuse to acknowledge that we live in a world of diversified beliefs.  In our political system, there ought to be an impartial system of logic that is derived not from what you believe the nature of existence to be, but from what is most just for a society.  Enter my Lincoln-Douglas debate experience!  A while ago, using my rudimentary philosophical knowledge, I wrote this:  "There has been an unnegligible amount of talk recently concerning homosexuality. I would like to have my say. First, for reiteration, the Christian conception of God loves homosexuals like anyone else, but the sin of homosexuality is not to be tolerated. Now that brings us to an important question: can the United States government legislate such morality by banning homosexual marriages?   In order to answer this question, one must understand what our country is based on. The Declaration of Independence calls for the rights of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. It's common knowledge that this was taken from English philosopher John Locke, who called for universal rights of life, liberty, and property. Locke is perhaps best known for the Social Contract. In the Social Contract, citizens give up some rights to have their most important rights insured. Therefore, in Locke's eyes, for a government to be legitimate, a government must uphold its society's rights of life, liberty, and property, above all others.   Liberty is the right that must be examined today. Locke put it like this: "My fist stops at your face." Essentially, a government acting morally would allow anybody to do anything as long as other people's rights were not infringed upon. The principle goes further; if John Doe bombs the Capitol building in Washington, that interferes with societal welfare which must also be upheld. While that model is not completely correct, it works for our purposes.   So, should United States citizens have the right to enter a homosexual marriage? At this point in time, the answer is yes; however, that answer can change. For it to change, opponents of homosexual marriage must provide empirical evidence that concludes homosexual marriage hurts society. After all, for a government to remain legitimate and moral, it ought to prohibit activities that interfere with other individuals liberty and/or societal welfare. This could be done with a multidecade long study on the effects of homosexual marriage in a society. Until such a credited study exists, for the United States government to remain moral, it must allow homosexual marriage."  ~  Adapt that idea to any issue of moral interest, I say.  I am of the opinion that the above formula is the most just formula.  Questions, anybody?

      Ah, a new blog.  I've posted on a couple various ones before, speaking my mind on various topics, but I've decided to expand my possible audience by starting this one.  I haven't much time to write now, but I am deeply interested in American politics, philosophy, and religion.  I try to evaluate as if a topic was something I'd debate at debate meets.  I suppose that's all that matters for now.

                      Undoubtly, all of you readers have heard of the recent beheading of Paul  Johnson, a contractor employee in Saudi Arabia.&nbsp; He was murdered by  al-Qaeda operatives.&nbsp; As I watched, and later read, President Bush's speech  on this unfortunate event, I could only shake my head.&nbsp; Why?&nbsp; In all  my years, I have never seen such a terrible instance of misunderstanding.&nbsp;  I know this best from my father.&nbsp; Sadly, my father and I have a bad  relationship.&nbsp; Seldom a day passes now without my father and I getting into  an argument.&nbsp; This could be easily avoided if my father and I worked harder  to understand each others' point of view.&nbsp; In light of recent events of  insurgency and anti-Americanism throughout the world, I must point out something  obvious, yet true:&nbsp; everything is a matter of perspective.&nbsp; Whether it  be the color of an object, the weather, religious differences, or the war on  terror, it's easily a matter of perspective.&nbsp; For example, I recently  discovered  http://english.aljazeera.net .&nbsp;  While I do not agree with all their reporting, it's definitely insightful as to  understanding what really irks most Muslims and Arabs about Americans:&nbsp;  vigilantism.&nbsp; So maybe Bush Administration officials wll follow these steps  to ease tensions immediately:   &nbsp;       Remove all American contractors from the Arab world.&nbsp; This is a    necessary first step towards protecting our citizens abroad.&nbsp; While this    will hurt some corporations in our country, this will serve three    purposes:&nbsp; getting our people out of danger, letting tensions cool, and,    in Iraq, giving Iraqis jobs to stem the 40% unemployment rate.     Give full soverignty to the interim Iraqi government.&nbsp; I admit, the    United States appears to be giving a good job of this, but heed my    warning:&nbsp; anything that makes Americans look like occupiers will give    ammunition to radical Islamics to keep hurting any Americans that are in the    Arab world.     Stop talking about this war in terms of "good" and "evil".&nbsp; Indeed,    this can be really tempting at some times, such as the recent beheading, but    the fact of the matter is that these ideas are relative; therefore, it can    make perfect sense to them to call us evil, which they do.     Most importantly, find out what makes certain Islamics declare America    evil.&nbsp; I have my theories, and you may have yours (and would probably    make a good topic for next week's column), but the most important step in    resolving any conflict is understanding why the other party feels how they    do.&nbsp; For al-Qaeda, the chances of this happening could very well be slim    to nil, but there are many other respectable Islamic clerics in the world, and    it is imperative to understand just what makes us the enemy.    These steps are only a beginning, but in order to finish any journey, you  must take the first step.&nbsp; I can only hope that America does soon, lest  this turbulence consumes us all.

      Well, Illinois State Senator Barack Obama:  I congratulate you.  After a long fought race, apparently you have won four months early.  You are an African American, you are popular, and your candidate has been eliminated.   Doesn't that sound like a bunch of bunk?  Not so.  Obama, the Democratic candidate for Illinois senator, now has a huge advantage after the withdraw of GOP candidate Jack Ryan from the race.  When a judge last week ordered Ryan's divorce records unsealed, it all fell apart for Ryan.  Ryan, a former millionaire banker and parochial school teacher, fiercely stated that there was nothing in the records that would apply to the race, only that his 9 year old son would be hurt if the records were unsealed.  The records indicated that Ryan had taken his wife, actress Jeri Ryan, to sex clubs and attempted to perform sex in public on her.  In the records, Ryan denies these charges, only stating that the couple went once to a rowdy sex club, felt uncomfortable, and left.  Ryan recently said that the charges weren't pertinent to the campaign, but withdrew from the race following pressure from Republican voters and officials.   Now, all of know that political sex scandals don't always unseat a politician; namely Bill Clinton and Arnold Schwarzenegger come to mind.  But what is it that makes or breaks a politician in America today?  Illinois was neither particularly conservative or liberal.  Surely Clinton's affair was more depraved that Ryan's.  So what the heck is going on here?  Perhaps it could be how he dealt with the issue.  First, Ryan told GOP officials long beforehand that there was nothing embarrassing in the records.  When Republicans found out the contrary, many said that they abandoned Ryan because he had lied from the start.  Bill Clinton, on the other hand, was a rather popular politician who had the full support of his party.   But what about Schwarzenegger?  When the tabloids picked up on various rumors, Arnold promptly said that he had been on some rowdy movie sets and that he may have done some wrong things.  Look at this:  we have a rather macho politician confronting this conflict head-on.  Clinton lied under oath about his affair, but he fought viciously throughout the whole process to keep his office.  What does this indicate?  I believe it's very clear:  Americans want more often for politicians to tackle the problems.  On that note, consider John McCain, a proven maverick who no one could ever accuse of being partisan.  The fact that McCain deals with the issues brings on popularity and support.  I can think of several politicians that could use such tactics, namely Bush but many others.  When it comes down to it, that's what really matters.  Americans are stating that they want decisive politicians that deal with the conflicts straightfowardly, no matter what the conflicts be.   So, Barack, Bush, and other persons, I hope you take that lesson to heart, you hear me?   Ponce

        A friend of mine posted the following note to the previous entry:   &nbsp;   i told you i woudl post a comment but i also told you that i dont really have strong opinions on this stuff.... at this point i am so confused about what shoudl be done about homosexual marriages because the it says in the Bible that it is wrong but then why would God make someone like that when he creates everyone in his image to be perfect to him? That is where i get confused and that is why i dont haev a strong opinion.... I want to accept people for who they are and so personally it does not bother me but at the same time i want to go with what the Bible says and i jsut get confused over the whole matter.   &nbsp;   Now, one of these days I'll have to sit down and do some color-coded highlighting in my Bible, because I can't find the specific verses that apply to homosexual relations.&nbsp; In the previous entry, I made a notion that suggested that in the political arena, at this time, gay marriage should be legalized; however, my friend is concerned with how to be obedient to God.&nbsp; Let's see if this old noggin still remembers the answer to this question!   &nbsp;   For Christians, generally speaking, the Bible is the highest authority, if they don't consider it to be the only one.&nbsp; Now, the Bible is clear on this:&nbsp; hate the sin, love the sinner.&nbsp; This means that while we cannot condone sins (such as acting on homosexual urges), we are to love&nbsp;the sinner.&nbsp; Simple as pie.&nbsp; This may be less known, but as Christian people, we know that to be tempted is not a sin in of itself; therefore, it is permissible for the gay person to have an urge to sin in that trademarked way, just so long as the gay person does not entertain those thoughts in his mind, or act on them.   &nbsp;   But what about the temptations in the first place?&nbsp; This is a rather&nbsp;old question, and I shall refer to Job.&nbsp; Job was a prosperous man who essentially became a pawn in a bet of God versus Satan.&nbsp; God let Satan torture Job within an inch of his life, yet Job remained faithful to God.&nbsp; When asked by his wife as to why Job didn't just rebuke God, Job replied, "God gives me good things.&nbsp; Why should I not accept the bad?"   &nbsp;   This is how I decide to answer this question.&nbsp; We have temptations so that we will come to rely on God for strength.&nbsp; I'm not sure if I've answered the key question here:&nbsp; how do you be a good Christian and allow the sin of gay marriage to be legalized?   &nbsp;   Perhaps the best answer I can give is the word of Jesus himself.&nbsp; Anyone who's been to Sunday School is familiar with Jesus saying, "Why point out the splinter in your neighbor's eye when there's a plank in your own?"&nbsp; Live godly the best YOU can.&nbsp; Remember the words of Francis of Asissi:&nbsp; "Preach the Word always, and when necessary, use words."&nbsp; Indeed, there are some sins that must be spoken out against, like abortion.&nbsp; But is gay marriage one of those?&nbsp; I would say no, since while there is an interference with the gift of&nbsp;life when it comes to gay relations, but abortion is essentially murder.&nbsp; That's the difference I use.   &nbsp;   Bottom line:&nbsp; Make your life a witness to God, and others will follow.

       urlLink Rwanda: Don't Abolish Rights Group, Advocacy Group Urges   For my first international political column, let me make this clear:  I'm not reporting the obvious.  US-Iraq is already covered.  Tune in to CNN and you'll hear about Sudan and their suspicious activity.  The New York Times has Iran-Iraq relations reported.  The purpose of this column is to increase awareness of things going on in the world.  I suspect you'll hear stuff about Africa that you didn't have a clue was happening.  Asia will be heard.  The American media does not cover these topics particularly well, for financial reasons, I suspect; why report something the masses won't care about?  I'm not writing for the masses (not yet, at least :)  Rwanda has had it's problems.  I personally believe the media uses the word "genocide" a bit too much.  It just sort of loses the effect.  Rwanda is a different story.  In April 1994, ethnic tensions in the country resulted in organized genocided of the minority ethnic group of Tutsis.  800000 of them.  This was, literally, government officials handing out machetes to loyal Hutus to kill Tutsis and killing those that wouldn't do the government's bidding.  The country has come a long way since that point, but the country is definitely scarred.  Enter this week's political issue.  A Rwandan parlimentary commission has "suggested" the disbandment of a leading human rights group in the country, which goes by its French acronym LIPRODOR.  The Human Rights Watch (HRW) has responded to the commisssion because LIPRODOR, a promoter of essential rights such as freedom of speech and expression and critical of the government's record on the promotion and protection of human rights, is threatening the Rwandan government in terms of dissent.  Apparently, the government treats dissenting ideas in the political arena as "genocidal".  Furthermore, a senior Rwandan official says that genocidal ideas cannot hide behind the freedom of speech.  I concur, for the most part; nevertheless, dissenting to governmental land holding is NOT genocide-related, is it?  Equally remarkable is the 2003 ban of the main opposition party in Rwanda before presidential and parliamentary elections.  Given the absurdity of the allegations of genocide today in Rwanda, this is likely nothing more than oppression in the arena.  Readers, this must not be tolerated.  I was not a supporter of the Iraq war, and reason was that there are several places in the world where intervention is much more needed.  Rwanda is such a place.  If you have any comments, they are appreciated; please leave them.  Ponce

       urlLink Bush Campaign Defends Church Outreach   This, my fellow readers, is absolutely despicable.  Partisan politics, this is.  Why, this is so bad, I'm not likely to come off as nonpartisan, dangit. :D  Seriously, this is bad.  Our President is using the hallowed halls of our churches for political ends (and I needn't remind you that politics isn't exactly Godlike).  Furthermore, this jeaporadizes SBC's tax-exempt status.  OK, that just all flew past you, didn't it?  Not to fear; I shall clarify.  This is dirty politics.  The Bush-Cheney campaign, in a memo, has attempted to obtain church directories from the Southern Baptist Convention, for campaign purposes.  It comes down to unsolicited political advertising.  Richard Land, president of the Southern Baptist Convention's Ethics and Religious Liberty Commission put it best:  "The bottom line is, when a church does it, it's nonpartisan and appropriate.  When a campaign does it, it's partisan and inappropriate."  The memo included a number of things for congregations to do, including:  1)  Send your church directory to your state Bush-Cheney '04 headquarters or give to a BCO4 field representative;  2)  Identify another conservative church in your community who we can organize for Bush;  3)  Recruit 5 people in your church to help with the voter registration project;  4)  Talk to your pastor about holding a citizenship Sunday and voter registration drive.  Perhaps the worst part to all of this is the tax-exempt status.  Churches typically fall under the IRS catagory of 501(c)(3).  501(c)(3)s are nonprofit organizations that do charitable things.  The Red Cross is a 501(c)(3).  Goodwill Corp. is a 501(c)(3).  Now, some individuals dispute Goodwill's 501(c)(3) status because it invests money into the stock market...which generates profit.  Goodwill walks a fine line.  In the same way, if churches get involved with political activies.  Actively being involved in the political arena like this is grounds for churches to lose this special status, crippling charitable organizations as we know them.  That must not happen, but the Bush-Cheney campaign conviniently overlooks this for (what is that?) political gain.  In summation, the Bush campaign's actions concerning voter registrations have been unethical and jeaporadize communal welfare in are country, welfare that is greatly supplemented by church donations which wouldn't be possible without the tax-exempt status.  To indulge my partisan side, a vote for Bush is a vote against ethics and all welfare as we know it.  Please, feel free to comment on this entry here.  All legitimate feedback is appreciated.  Ponce
