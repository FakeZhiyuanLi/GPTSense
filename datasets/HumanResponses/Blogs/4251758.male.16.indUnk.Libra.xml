      I don't know if anyone likes football too much, but I just had to comment on the New York Jets. They basically demolished the Colts today, and if everyone stays healthy, I predict a division title, or at least a wild card. The exiting Jets are a site for my sore eyes, seeing as though the NY Mets (baseball) have been horrendous. Go Jets! Okey dokey there's my "I'm exited about the new season" rant.

      So friday was the annual Luao dance at Spix (Pius), and basically there wasn't anyone who didn't show. And that was a good thing. It was a sick dance, mostly because I saw approximately 3 girls not wearing short skirts. And I'll tell you what, short skirts can turn girls who are not very or marginaly attractive into absolute foxes. Hell, I saw a few guys who almost looked pretty in 'em. I didn't follow my plan of dancing with some hot new freshman, but it was dec. all the same, because I didn't dance with anyone who was wak. After we had used up all of our dance juices, we hit IHOP speech and debate style. Basically as usual we were really loud and obnoxious, and lots of old couples (why are they even there at midnite?) stared at us like they couldn't enjoy their liver and onions because we were there. It was an all out rockin' time basically. If anyone ever gets a chance to go to a Luao dance, or any of the sort, I highly recommend it.

      Hip Hip Hooray!!! I'm actually more hyped up for school than usual, not only because I'm now king of the school as a senior (and totally get to wear colored polos, which means that I'm cool), but also senior year should be the sickest ever. If it wasn't for fugly AP Calc and Physics, I would be even happier. Oh well, you win some you lose some...

      Although no one has read my last post, or even this one, and maybe about 10 total people will, entering posts is my new favorite internet blog hobby. That's it.

      It's always been my dream to have my own internet blog, and now I have finally realized my fantasy! Actually I just did this so I could post comments on other poeple's... Anyway I hope to make this the number one ranked website in terms of visits by the end of the year, surpassing Yahoo, Google and all the rest. Most blogs are sick, so I thought I'd give it a try-try Mctry try jr. And that concludes my historic first post!
