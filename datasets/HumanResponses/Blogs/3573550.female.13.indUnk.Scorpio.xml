      hey! i'm just your regular 13-year old.ü Like every 13-year old says...   being 13 is not as easy as it sounds  .  And I must admit, it really isn't as easy as it sounds. take it like this- it's your first year as an actual teenager. how hard can it be? yesterday, you and your sister wears the exact clothes(think, cute little pink dress with matching pink ribbon)today, you totally think it's sick. hello! like you're ever gonna wear something identical with her. so.. get what i mean? being 13 means changes, changes and did i mention changes? admit, you'll have to choose buying that awesome pair of shoes you saw the other day at Shoesalon rather than buying a Barbie doll. right? so that's about the picture. there's many more to say... and i can't tell them all!!So enough about that, school is about to start in a few days and I'm really really excited. you're asking  WHY?  Beacuse I'm about to be a highschool student!ü and.. you know... it's quite exciting.. knowing that you 've gotten this far.ü hehehe...  uhmm.. i'm gonna tell you more about my life.. My name is Erika. I was born and raised here in the Philippines. My dad is a hardworking Engineer and my mum isagreat homemaker. I have 4 siblings... and joy. I'm the eldest. i'll have to tell you this, it's hardwork!! having 4 siblings.. and you're the eldest!! it really is a pain in the neck! plus headaches. hehehe.ü uhmm... have to go! my mum's calling me! til next time! mwah!ü
