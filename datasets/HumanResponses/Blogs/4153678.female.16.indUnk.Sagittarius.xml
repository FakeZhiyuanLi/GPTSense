       For one thing i'm really glad that everything is finally over today. Had a long day today. Well though i studied much more and spent much longer time on Chem than Maths, Chem test done more badly than Maths. Ironic huh? Couldnt believe it myself too. Well there was a structural question on Alkenes and i didnt study that entire chapter. So i most probably lost lots of marks there. *sigh* Why muz they set questions on chapters i didnt finish studying? I finished all the chapters for Chem except that. And as a result i neglected my Maths. Thot i'll let down Mr Seow more than Miss Koh. Now i think it's the reverse.   After the CT i had IPW. GUess i have quite a lot cuz i was absent for MOnday's pw session and the group had finished almost most of the written report. Yupx. So this week is my turn to do my part of the written report. After that had tuition, then met up with Sing Yi at Starbucks @ Plaza Singapura.  Went to Yamaha to find music books later then went to Burger King to study. After that cuz Sing wanna watch the[ 倚天屠龙记] so we left @ 6.30pm. Hmn.. well thru out the entire outing with her today we really catched up quite a lot on each other. HAhaz.. even discussed bout our future and our family's finance problems...   All i could say is that i really enjoyed the outing with Sing Yi. Hahaz... That is what happens when true close friends confide in one another.  Guess we're a pair of confidants, yeah Sing Yi?? ^_^   Then me went home and till now lolz... hahaz.... gonna study today too.. do some homework, at least complete something today. Yup.   Oh Yesterday i managed to find the entire full song for  「爱上张无忌」 !!! Was so nice!!! It's prob the nicest song i've ever heard. Love the orchestra and 毛阿敏's vocal. SO powerful and shiok!!   Hahaz..me was even playing and replaying this song while studying yesterday. Simple just love this song...   OkaEz then,... gtg le. Have to start doing work cuz not early already. See Ya then. Nitez...

       My 革命 journey is definitely yoyo and wavy. Last Wednesday i reached 64 Kg, i lost 0.5 kg from the previous week. But now, in just two days, i'm @ 66Kg!! ALL TIME HIGHEST!! OH GOSH!!!!!!!   I think probably it's because i've been 暴饮暴食 due to all the stress. It's definitely not good for health and i can feel all the food a strain to my heart. I've to cut down tomolo.   I'm supposed to lose to 62kg end of this week. But for now, after tomorrow's fateful day, i'll just try to cut down to my original weight. And from tml onwards i MUST learn to control my diet and studies. Firstly i dont want to die early cuz of my obese side and of course i wanna go well for my studies. Promos coming in less than 42 days. Have to start preparing now..   Right now, i'll just have to die for my test tml. Can't finish studying @ all. It's 7 pm and i've not finished chem and i've not even started studying maths yet.    *haiy*   pray that i can move closer to Hakuna matata and not drift away from it.....

       到现在，革命真的很多波折。一切还没有什么进展。为何呢？我想是和我的自律有关。这拜六有化学和数学测验，可是化学都才刚开始读，数学也还没开始，想必这次也不会考好了。天啊！！ 一定要帮我度过这难关！   好了，今天的笔记也得短了，因为今天要赶课了，要临时报佛脚了！！！

       Well.. i didnt go school today.. hence my blog title "guilty". There are a few reasons for my absence. I'm not exactly sick but i was a little tired. Emphasis on the word little. The real and main reason was because i didnt study @ all for the entire weekend cuz of the concert blah blah and i definitely can't finish my studies for chem and maths Common test this sat. Yupx. I really want to do well for my CT. So i pretended to be very tired and used my elbow injury as an excuse. I really wanted to tell mom the real reason. But will she accept it? Nope. I can assure u that. If she is more open and understanding to why i chose to miss the longest day i have in school for my studies and if she is to be less hot and short tempered and stubborn, i will have definitely told her the real reason. I hate to lie. Who likes anyway, especially to your closest kin. Guilty again.      I only told Sing Yi the truth. By far she's the only one i know i can tell who can understand me. Of cuz there is xueling. But cuz Singyi sms me just now to ask bout my concert hence i just  顺便  told her.       Yupz..so now i'm really make use of this day. I've already wasted half a day sleeping. I originally only planned to sleep till 8 am cuz i wasnt tired at all but ended up sleeping more. Actually i'm used to 3 to 4 hours of sleep already. Long ago. But okay sometimes i must admit there are exceptional cases where i really do feel tired. *Haiz* I know it's not right skipping school to catch up with work but i have no other choices. Well, luckily for chem and physics lect those chapters have been already covered in tuition. Hence i won't miss much.       Okay.. gtg already... Mom's back from market and i seriously need to work hard today. See ya.

       Just typed a para just now but an accidental "backspace " deleted everythin... *haiz*      Well does today's blog title puzzle u again?? Hahaz.. well this is by far the most suitable title i can think of over  what happened over the past few days..      Let's start with Friday...CLDDS concert was generally ok.. except that feedback given  was that the male actor KAng Ming changed too slow.. they said the actress was faster.. gee.. but u should have seen the speed that He changed!!! It was so fast lorx ! Really an eye opener for me! i put my hats off him mann!! However think Friday's concert was a lottle unsteady for him. At one of the changing intervals he was going " sharks i forgot my lines" and another interval he was going " Cheez i left one the props on stage". Guess he was probably too anxious cuz it was the first full run thru of everything. Of course me and Terence were stunned by the speed of everything. It was really much much faster than we expected.. Well my role was to prepare the props and costumes for Kang Ming for his changing interval and Terence's job was to help him change. *Der*, when Kang ming was changing pants i turned away..After the first drama was over both of us left cuz i had test the next day and Terence had his rehearsal for CLDDS song competition. Ha, After that when i reached home i was supposed to pia for cem pre assessment and GP.. but ended out i fell asleep on the Big black chair and i woke up finding myself on my bed and still in my uniform.. In the end, i didnt had time to read anything at all. Luckily Chem pre assessment was okok and GP test... *Sigh* i dont think it'll make a difference even if i had studied for it.      Yep then after that went for tuition blah blah and i'm back in school at 4.45pm For CLDDS concert day 2. Initially Terence called to ask if he can be excused cuz he was very tired but as there was no more available guy substitute for him, he agreed to come down to help. Thanks a lot!!! Even tho u were tired u still readily agreed to comedown.. ^_^  Think day 2 was much smoother. KAng Ming this time suggested that he changed himself cuz after all it's always faster if u change urself than others helping ya. YEp.. so me and Terence juz prepared his clothes and Terence helped a bit while KAng Ming was changing. Hahaz... 2nd day was definitely more fun and memorable cuz me talked more to the alumni seniors.. hmn.. i know a few of their names .. Jian Sheng, Kang Ming, Steven, Shi Hui, Kai wen... oh the J2s came down too to support and help out.. Great seniors!! Came down despite their exams are cornering. Perhaps the changing duration was faster on the 2nd day.. maybe it was due to KAng mIng changing himself and he was definitely much calmer on the 2nd day.       Yep.. i would say i didnt regret volunteering to help cuz i really had fun and gained a lot..But on the other hand wad Dad says today was true that " whether i could afford the time despite all the fun" . *Haiy*.. he is so rite. I'm not desperately out of time to study for my chem and maths test this sat,,, Help!! It's on Sunday 8,00pm le and ive not completed any chapters for maths and chem test. Ming u there's a whole lot of chapters! Hence my blog title " mixed feelings!"      OF cuz there are other mixed feelings, like i'm supposed to be on diet and lose 2 kg this week b4 this wednesday but up to now i didnt skip any meals yet tho i've been careful to ensure i didnt eat too much snacks and only have 3 main meals. To this i muz praise myself but i muz scold myself also cuz overall there is no change in weight. Hence mixed feelings again.      *haiy* but i'm really afraid for my studies. Really. GUess from my other blogs u can see the frustration in me. Ha, what can i do?? I didnt study yesterday cuz the xact replica happened as Friday... went home and this time slept in my study room and then found myself on my bed the next morning...ha, of cuz i'm was still also in my school uni...      WEll... wonder if i can do well or may be just do better for this CT. I'm not sure cuz it's again all last minute work.., *help* !!! when can i ever get out of this cycle?? I really admire our MAths teachers like Mr Seow, Mr Tan, Mr TAn ( diff one).. all so smart!! PSC scholars from RJC, then graduates of Cambridge/ Harvard... I'll never be like them.. HAahz.. told myself since i can't be like them then muz have a husband like them in future... SO smart pple... Really wonder how they sort their time management... perhaps can interview them in future,,,      HA,,, well i've typed today's blog with an injured arm.. i wouldn't exactly say it's injured but i kinda sprained it cuz tt time i threw myself onto bed then i landed on tt arm then now elbow hurts for quite a few days already. Mom says it's swollen when she was applying lintment for me just now.. so now i'm wearing an elbow guard on my arm and it's really restricting my typing and right arm movement. Wonder how am i going to write later and also for tml's pe.. mom says that i tell teacher tml if there is any arm exercise..      okok... guess i better stop now or i really cant finish what i'm supposed to study today.. So far my 革命 hasnt been too successful tho there is slight improvement day by day... Well really looking forward to my HAKUNA MATATA!!! Nitez!!! ^_^

           Maybe u would think that i must have done some really bad thing today hence my blog title for the day. Yep... i WASTED yesterday (it's 1 am now so i'm referring to earlier on b4 12 midnight) just practising my calligraphy strokes. *haiy* Initially i wanted to allocate another two more practices with my calligraphy mates to prepare for the competition but because of today, i cancelled one of the practices. Really worried for my studies.. i really want to do well... I'm sick of all the lousy grades that i'm getting.. Really SICK of it...Well today got to keep it short cuz i'm supposed to go to bed or i wont be able to get up at 5... okok gtg... nitez....

                        Hahaz... Well at least things are starting to look better now.. let's hope it reallly gets better...HaHAaz.. at least i found out that i wasnt the only one who didnt spend the long weekend well on studies.. HAhaaz.. *grins*... i so evil hor.. Hahaz.. lolz... aiyah.. okay okay... there WERE some people who DID make good use of this long weekend tho. But neither am i gonna to envy them nor get jealous cuz i too had the same amount of time. Just that i didnt spend it well. So i deserve it if i didnt do as good as them for the CT.                 Well my wounds from the AJ race are recovering now. The big blueblack i received from the fall is fading away and it does not hurt that much now. SOme of the scratches are recovering. Can tell new skin is growing back from the itch i suffer from these scratches and the scabs are coming off too...                  I reached home not long ago. BArely an hour has passed. Had rehearsal for Friday's concert today. It wasnt considered a rehearsal tho. Cuz if i'm not wrong they are not rehearsing the entire play today. Just a few quick scenes here and there and some fastforwarding of scenes too. Eh.. i'm backstage crew in charge of costumes so i left earlier with one of the alumni seniors (the I/C for costumes), Shi Hui, once we settled with the costume matters. After all they were not having a full dress rehearsal so we need not be there. Guess what's my role for the costume thingy. I'm supposed to help one guy actor change into his different costumes!!! I'm supposed to help him change for a total of 9 scenes. (There are 10 scenes in total) Gee.. the akward thingy is that certain scenes require him to change pants too.. so it's a little akward that i have to wait for him to change pants himself and then help him with his clothes.. hahaz...and the worst thing is that the changing interval is very short. There are 10 scenes to be played within one hour--- i.e one scene is about a mere 5 mins with 1 min changing time. WOW!!! How am i going to help him change within such a short time??? Luckily later when he came he said he just needs to change hurriedly and basically he doesnt need much help in changing so i guess my job's much easier now.. i just need to tidy his clothes and help him straighten his clothes before he enters the next scene. The alumni seniors even told me to remind him to zip his pants cuz he forgot to do so during one of the full dress rehearsals. *hahaz* ^-^                      Well guess i'm gonna be real busy with this concert thingy.. tho i love to help out but it's of the expense of my time. Honestly i wont want to be involved in future cuz these kinda concerts can be a real killer in time. But of course if i'm free and can afford to dedicate these time into these activities, i'll probably be the first one to sign up for backstage or something.  However for now, this is not the case. Time is not on my side.  My Friday is almost entirely gone because of this concert thingy. School dismisses at 1 pm but i've to report at 4pm cuz there's a lot of ironing of costumes to be done. Concert's gonna last for 2 hours. By the time i get home...it'll be damn late and i'll be very tired. WORST, i have chemistry pre-assessment on sat morning 7.30 and straight after GP common test till 10++.   *Cheez*  I just adjusted my timetable just now to suit this new time schedule. Aiyah at least i made a few senior alumni frenz from this project.. like kai wen, shi hui, and a few others whom i do not know of their names quite yet. Well that's one sow i've reaped.                   Hmn.. well pray that all goes well on Friday, cuz we didnt have any PROPER rehearsal and there ain't gonna be any. So the actual performance will be the first full drive run. WOW.. wonder how the seniors are able to bet that it'll run smoothly for it's maiden voyage. Well... guess they must have some confidence that it'll run well..                   Guess for now i can only pray that all goes well for both my CT and the concert. It's 11 pm now..Hahaz... eh talking about CLDDS the alumni seniors are very bonded to AJC and CLDDS.. they've graduated for a few years already but they're still together putting up a performance in school. Really admire them. All from different batches, but coming together from TOTAL strangers (cuz some of them weren't in AJ yet before some of the seniors graduated) to putting up a performance for the sake of CLDDS... hahaz... ChEeRs & ToaSts to ya Alumni Seniors!!! Hahaz... some of them are really so much older.. there's one i know that is older than me by 9 to 10 years!!! He was from the 11th/ 12th batch (not sure) and i'm in the 21st batch.. Cool huh??? Imagine still bonded to AJ after lyke a decade??? HahaZ... they came to help us out during our CLDDS camp in june too... Really Great Alumni seniors!!! CLDDS rockS!!!!!! OUr current batch too is very united...haHaz... love CLDDS !!!                  Well then for Shu Fa we have a competition coming up soon.. Got to buck up already.. competition's in one month's time but until now we've not even completed mastering the strokes!! And we havent even written a proper word yet!!! WOW!!! HaHaz!! Of coz i wont be expecting to win any prize or something. BUt guess we'll all go for the experience and perhaps CCA points. Gee.. talking bout CCA points it makes me wonder if helping out for this concert will gain me CCA points of CIP hours... hmn... muz go KAi Qi... Hahaz.. Hope it does!!!        *grins*    ^_^                 HAhaz.. think i'll stop here for now.. Right now i'm grasping really hardly between work and CLDDS... Hope everything balances out well and even.. CheErs!!

            今天的心情不一样。老天爷啊！！！ 为何？！哈，我老是以为一切可以雨过天晴，终究可以顺利， 但为何革命的第二天也不顺利呢？？？原本应该5 am 起床， 但或许是我太过怕输，用了超级大声的闹钟，结果适得其反，在我还没醒时就被爸妈关掉了。哈，你猜我几点起来？？ 11.30 am ！！！！！！！！！ 我这一天的计划全全搞砸啦！！！我现在真的真的好气哦！！！革命第二天失败了。一年之计在于春，一日之计在于晨，老天！！ 我一年的计划已失败，现在连我的一日之计也要失败。 为什么！！！为什么我老是偿受失败？？失败的滋味好象已成为我的家常便饭。          *唉*。。 甘脆一头撞墙死掉算了。你叫我啥办？？？原本应该在这难得的长假期里好好利用时间，是老天爷赐的机会给我弥补从前好玩好看电视的错错，哈，结果怎样？？？还不是一样吗？？又从蹈覆辙乐不是？老天爷！！！我对不住您！！！ 但我真的好痛苦。您教我该怎么办？？ 眼看common test 要来了。 死定了。我很stress leh！！！身旁的人一个个都在好好用功，而我。。。却还“革命”来“革命”去的，好丢脸哦！！！人家早已革命了，而且现在都那么顺利，考试都考到很好，而我，从june holidays 就跟自己说要改过我这个好玩好看电视的恶习，到了八月了， 仍然没变。 我好失败啊！！！啥办啊？？？我也不知换了多少个timetable during this long weekend, 哈，可是还没有机会follow them 就已经失败了。我想，我一定是天下最没用的家伙了。一点律己也没有。啥办啊啥办？？？ 你能教我啥办吗？ 我的心现在好乱好乱。已经中午啦，半天走了，我依然什么也没作。要怪只能怪自己了。起来那么晚。 我真不知自己还有没有这个勇气来继续下去。我已经很彻底的失败了。我从june holidays 到现在一直都在失败。从未成功过。可是我又有什么选择呢？我只能这样认命了。我真的好痛苦。 我要崩溃了。如果现在去跟妈说为何在关闹钟时不把我叫醒，只会把我们的关系弄得更僵、只会吵起来。。。 我什么都不想去想了，目前我真的不知所措。*唉。。。* －__－ 哈。说到自己的肥胖问题，我也真的又要崩了！十六年了！！！ 不但没降低，反而加重了！又是原本以为在这个星期里减掉一些公斤的，哈，象往前不知上千次对自己也这样说，结果还不是失败了。 或许如果天下有这么一项“天下最失败的人”奖的话，那这一定归我所宿。 老天啊老天，教我该如何???                                                                                                           ----伤心绝望的小猪

            My reflection:     所谓 “万事起步难” 看来这句话果然没错。The first step is always difficult. It's already 2 pm and I haven't really started. But I'm going to give up cuz I know one have to strive to achieve success. Hahaaaz…quite proud of myself that I have this determination. Well i'm just going to make sure that i quit my couch potato habit and really NO MORE TV from now on. I think i'll also forgo the listening to music part. It's like people in 4 As class are scoring much better than I and being in a just 3 As class and having grades like this i can't help but to feel ashamed of myself. SO... i'm going to start anew and BUCK UP!!!! *sigh* Today is National Day.. HAhaz.. HAppy Birthday Singapore!!!     Dear Lord, Pray that i can turn over a new leaf and start anew. Tho i know it's hard but please give moi the courage to carry on and change for the better asap.... Thanks Lord!! PraiSe tHe LorD!!     Well..Life in JC isn't the same as secondary school. There's so much difference. Basically i think i regret playing too much for the past half year. I see the urge to get the gear moving. HahAz.. all of a sudden i really feel that i'm getting more hardworking.. AnyWaYs i'll never give up!!

       Hey hey...i've been playing for the past two days.. well guess it's time to really get down and start work..There's a lot to be done, and i'm still at square one. *sighs*. I've actually made a secret pact to myself--- that is from tomorrow onwards i'll really start it right and get down to business. There are two goals on my list now-- 1. Start working hard and do well for my Promos 2. get fit and lose weight. Hahaz.... u may ask me why i chose to start tml and not today. That's because i want to start things right. I've keep postponing this " starting right" thingy for a very long time already. But now i'm really determined to get it going. I pray that everything goes fine, though i know that it's going to be a very tough journey ahead. Yesterday i went to the gym. Worked out on a few equipment. Well Mr Lim says i need to work on my fitness. He's right.Let's hope my grades shall improve and fitness attain a better level. Right now i think these will be my life goals. And oh, Chinese AO 'll be coming in 3 months time too. Guess i'll have to buck up on chinese too. *sighs again* There's always too much things to do with too little time. I lack the self discipline too, tho i know i have to determination. It's very strong in me, to keep myself going and not giving up. But somehow my fatal point is my lack of self discipline to start work. I'm always easily distracted. * sigh* But.. i'm going to put all these behind me.. i'm going to start ANEW!!! Until then will i finally attain my 'Hakuna Matata.'

                         Yoz yOz..today's my first day using this blogger thingy.. hahaz still not used to it.. hmn..well  we celebrated National DAy in school today.. *HoOrAy*.. There's a long holiday weekend..No School till Wednesday... *ya hoo*  =P    Well the highlight of today's celebration was AJ race. It was fun but i fell along the way, on the concrete pavement outside MacDonalds near BIshan ITE. Suffered a few scratches on my palms,elbows and knees.. *Ouch*  *suay* -_-!!   Minor ones though..applied antiseptic already.. :) HeY!!! Our class was the first JC 1 class to complete the race!! Guess it was because we didnt had many stations and we were practically running thru out the race. When we returned to school we played 总集密码 while having milo and oreos. Hahaz.. this was the most fun game today. Miss Chan,Hui Zi, Michelle, ShiQi, JunJian, Boon Han, Zhi Qi, Diana did forfeits. They were really sporting. Esp Junjian, Shiqi and Boon Han Zhi Qi. Our class kinda scandaled them to do the forfeit in pairs. Each pair had to finish a bottle of water in 20 secs. Really fun. TOok many photos too. =P After the celebration we went for class lunch with Miss Chan. Not everyone went tho. Had lunch at Sukara Thai restaurant. Nice lunch. Found out quite some stuff about Miss Chan's past too. It seems that she's quite into sports too. HoneStly I admire her adventurous spirit in trying out so many various CCAs and activities.             As for how i am going to spend this rare long weekend holiday, i think i'll probably just stay home and catch up with work. There's lots to do and i'm really behind time in studies. I'm a little afraid for the upcoming CT and promo.. Grades have not been optimistic..Come to think of it there's not much time left either. Guess this makes it more crucial to catch hold of the remaining time.             CLDDS alumni is putting up a performance (drama) on 13th and 14th AUgust.. Tickets have not been selling well honestly, reckoned it's due to the clash of CT and probably because it's because it's put up by alumni and not students ourselves, so it's more difficult to persuade fellow friends to come support this event.                        Hahaz..hmn.. 'Singapore Idols' is going to be broadcast on NAtional Day.. wonder how our local talents are. Mom says it'll definitely disappoint me. I don not know. However i still believe that there'll be surprises. We shall wait and see.           GUess i'll stop here for today. HOpe my blog turns out nice!!
