      Kari's parents are actually going to let her come with me to Hershey Park! Suprised the hell out of me especially since its overnight in another state, when most of the time they wont even let her come over here regardless of if my parents are home or not. This week is shaping up to be a great one. I just hope the weather stays nice.

      To use an old indian saying : "The DMV takes way to fucking long."  Oh well, I'll be getting the hard copy of my unrestricted liscence in a week or two.  Yay for me.  P.S.  You can now click the pictures in my previous post to see the full sized versions.  These ones look really bad because they're resized by the browser to fit into the blog without overlapping on anything.  So click away friend, click away.

      Well contrary to my previous post I did manage to dislodge my ass from this computer chair for a short period of time to go pick up pictures from hershey-park. I'm in the process of scanning them right now. Maybe I'll put some of them on the internet somewhere some time soon.  **edit 9:26 PM Same Day** Here are the pictures     Sea Lions  urlLink        urlLink        urlLink        urlLink        urlLink        urlLink         Dolphins  urlLink        urlLink        urlLink        urlLink        urlLink        urlLink         Kari In a Fuzzy Hat  urlLink         Kari And I Walkin  urlLink         Ok this one is strange, and somewhat hard to see, but on the way back home we hit a bat, and he stuck to the radio antenna.  He stayed on the antenna until the next day when we took him off.  urlLink        urlLink

      The trip to Hershey park was great.  The stay down there was better.  The trip up sucked because we had to drop Kari off.  Oh well, at least her parents are finally loosening up about us being together.   The park was huge, biggest I've ever been to.  The lines werent all that bad, but everything down there we really expensive.   The weather did manage to stay nice until about 10:00pm yesterday night, then it started pouring, but we were ready to leave by then anyway.  I also just went and saw 'Without a Paddle'  It was pretty sweet, I couldnt get ahold of Kari to ask if she could go, but her parents probly wanted a chance to see her themselves anyway.  Maybe She'll be able to do something again before school starts up.
