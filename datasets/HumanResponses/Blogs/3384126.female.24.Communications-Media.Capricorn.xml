      6 hours of solid work. Down the drain. Gone. Not a trace.  It was good work. It wasn't the sort of nasty work that you don't care that you lose. It was difficult work.  Now I am sad.  Actually, I'm manic. I couldn't stop laughing whilst explaining the predicament to a friend over the phone. I think it's the only thing preventing me from killing myself.  This weekend, I will be living the life of a hermit. I shall spend all hours in front of the computer, save for time spent sleeping, bathing, or attending to bodily functions (I meant blowing my nose, what did you think).  Wish me luck. If you're around, say hi.

      I'm exhausted.  I was awake too late last night, finishing an assignment after doing bits and pieces, and leaving the majority until the last minute. Which means that ultimately, the things I wrote a week ago weren't as good as the things I wrote in the last minute, but I didn't have time to those things, because I left them till the last minute. Rinse, repeat.  Today I overheard the University chaplain telling a student to be sure to give her his exam timetable, so she can pray for him.   Being a not-so-practicing Jew, I'm not really so big on the prayers, unless they involve moments of eating and/or fasting. Don't get me wrong, I respect and understand those who do pray. but I have a hard time associating good performance in exams with praying. I think that if you believe the whole human beings with free will thing in the bible, you'll pretty much understand that god kinda said you're on your own with exams. I'll give you brainpower and the ability to read and write, but what you do with that is up to you. Furthermore, I have a feeling that god never had to do an exam, ever. I believe that if there was someone out there monitoring his progress, there would have been a lot of things he would have done better. For instance:    - He would have gotten rid of the fat gene               - He would have told the entire Middle East that this really wasn't the way he imagined things back in the days of Abraham               - He would have made it so technology didn't break down on you when you needed it most               - He would have made a world with less stupid people.

      I spent about 2 hours today reading  urlLink snopes.  I didn't mean to do it, I went there to look something up and decided to look through all the stories. What I discovered was that there are a lot of gullible people out there, and there are an equal number of people wanting to exploit these people. And the internet is a perfect place for the two to converge.  Yeah, I'm over the whole Andy Kaufman returns hoax thing. I know I kinda said I really didn't care if it was real or not, but I did care. It's so obvious it's false. Thanks again,  urlLink snopes .  Also, I was abused today for walking. I may have been going a little too slowly. It's also possible that I may have drifted onto the other side of the footpath to view something. The guy turned to me as he passed and said "left, right, left, right, which is it?". He wasn't menacing, but I was taken aback. I consider myself a pretty straight walker, and there he was, questioning my straightness. I told him I'd stick to the right now, if that was ok with him; he said fine, and kept going. Looking back, I think the confusion occurred because I was strolling. I had some time to kill, so I was walking in and out of some shops.  I should have made a crack about my political stance. But those types of cracks don't always work so well with strangers on a busy street. "I'm not politically affiliated but I tend to take a left-wing, social democrat approach to things and I don't vote for Howard" would have made him balk and run. Then again, maybe that's what I *should* have done, after all.

      A conversation I had about a minute ago:   [other person]  there is something inherently naughty about an english accent  [other person]  when it comes to women specifically of course  [me]  its true. women with an english accent are almost always cold, calculating, vixenish and incredibly distantly hot  [me]  whereas guys with an english accent are funny, cute, charming, nerdy in that english type of way.  [other person]  like hugh grant?  [other person]  you MUST have had him in mind when you said that  [me]  yes. or Mike Skinner, from the streets. Or Colin Firth. or those insanely cute, rowdy brits that you find in pubs around Bondi in Sydney.  [me]  stereotype, anyone?   Currently listening to the minimalist tones of the Lost in Translation soundtrack......

      Could he be back? On the web? Is this a Hoax?  Logging onto blogger today, I noticed  urlLink Andy Kaufman Returns  as one of the "blogs we've noticed". Intrigued, I followed the link.  What I found was quite extraordinary, what I believe may just be an internet milestone, if not a milestone itself. Whilst I have noticed some  urlLink great   urlLink stories  coming out of the internet, Andy Kaufman's return - if it is indeed real - has to blow them all away.  Let's assume, for a second, that is real, even if the Gospel of Google(tm) does of course tell us otherwise. There are a couple of implications here:  1) The whole successful obscurity thing. Has any celebrity ever managed it? Omar Sheriff becoming bridge champion of the world doesn't count, kids.  2) Coming back via the web. It's so naughties. If it is real, what a brilliant way to return. Forget a televisual appearance. Appear in a way that will enhance the myth, extend the what if? scenario.   There's nothing discretely visual about this, it just is....slowly spreading by word of mouth. If it does catch on, great. If it doesn't, it's just another one of those "fooled you!" internet scams that exploit the medium so beautifully. It's a win-win situation, really.  Of course, the likelihood is that it may not be real.   UPDATE: The blog seems to be updated quite regularly, with 3 entries written since I wrote this. Andy (or whomever) has summed up things quite nicely by noting:   "Mister Gone said: Might be Andy. Might be Bob. Might be someone else entirely. If you're not on for the ride, then the joke's on you.  This is Andy, but I know some of you won't be believers and that's fine. You're missing out on being "in" on one of the biggest stunts ever pulled -- me returning after faking my death for 20 years, just like I promised!"   Alternatively, as one of the comments mention:   This isn't about DNA tests or the truth. It's only about whether the person steering the ship can continue to entertain. I never heard anyone complain about current day Bugs Bunny for instance, when we all know it's not the same person portraying Bugs. Let Andy the character be resurrected, not the namesake. Whoever is steering, I hope you pull it off. That's what matters, not the truth.   I'm loving this, I'm hooked. I'm here for the ride. I'll be watching this space very closely.

      Something I should admit from the outset: I'm a raging, closeted, Gilmore Girls fan. Since Australian TV is disappointingly behind when it comes to US TV shows, I choose to obtain my fix by utilising the marvels of a broadband connection and bittorrent.  Tonight, not five minutes ago, I watched the last episode of Gilmore Girls for the season. The following is my post on the Gilmore Girls usenet group regarding the series final (yes, I'm THAT much of a fan):   **There be SPOILERS Here***    I give this one a solid 5. I yelled in dismay when it ended.  The weekend at the Dragonfly brought the characters together splendidly for the final episode of the season. The fact that they were all brought together at the inn really cemented the budding relationships between Luke and Lorelai and Dean and Rory. It reminded me, in a way, of school camp - when all the kids would get together and shenanigans would reign because of the sheer concentration of living in such close quarters.   Oh yeah, that's right, I said budding relationship. I predict a return to Dean and Rory as a couple, following a few weeks of self-inflicted torture for Rory after going to Europe with her grandmother, deciding she needed some time away to decide things. Although Dean really did love Rory throughout it all - and Luke can vouch for that - we know he won't leave Lindsay at the drop of a hat. OTOH, Rory's been looking for little more than security in her past few exchanges with Dean - a shoulder to cry on, or someone to come and rescue her when she needed it. Perhaps the torment of being the other woman will finally force Rory into deciding exactly how she feels about Dean, and appreciate him this time.   Now I am seriously devoid of televisual products for the next few months. Gilmore Girls and Scrubs are over. Queer eye is on a hiatus, and hell...even the Newlyweds aren't being shown anymore. It's lucky that I have piles and piles of work to do before this semester ends in the beginning of June. But what about my work distractions? What will I do during the Winter holidays? ARGH!   I feel dirty.

      Hi. I'm here to tackle issues that bug me, to make sense of stuff that annoys me, and to out people who do bad stuff to me. Anything and everything is fair game here - Film, the Media, Music Culture, Politics and the conspiracy that led me to lose my green sock the other day.  I'm going to use the internet to share and share alike, in a most spectacular fashion. Love it or leave it, man.  Please stick around, I'd love to have you read me.  Oh, and you can call me Terry.

      I used to have an  urlLink RT  Journal just for this kind of thing, but I've decided to abandon it and just put my movie reviews on here from now on. Bare in mind that movies are sometimes released in good old Oz later than those elsewhere in the world (Nth America) so I may not be talking about the latest, cutting-edge hollywood releases. My opinion is nevertheless valid, so you'd better listen, biatch.    urlLink Mean Girls    Having graduated life with movies such as  urlLink Heathers  and  urlLink Clueless  as firm favourites, I wondered whether urlLink  Mean Girls  would be up to par in the teenage clique comedy section.   I am quite happy to report that the film did exceptionally well. It managed to amalgamate the dark quirkiness of Heathers and light-hearted send-up quality of Clueless into a surprisingly entertaining film.   Having been situated as the only group of twentysomethings in a cinema full of teenagers, mostly females, we found ourselves the only ones laughing in many parts of the film. Tina Fey, head writer on Saturday Night Live, has proved once again that her comedy writing prowess reigns supreme. There was a particular moment involving the gay guy, Danny DeVito and a young woman in a female bathroom that, quite literally, made me cry laughing. I don't know why, it was just funny, man.  I guess, holistically, you could say some things about the storyline. But in this instance, the jokes managed to make up for the plot failures, which I'm willing to overlook, I guess.  Getting over the stigma of going to see a movie meant for 16 year old females makes for an enjoyable, light, humorous film. Look out for the performance by Amy Poehler as the mum who wants to be 16 again, and the coach doing the sex education classes.    urlLink Harry Potter 3: The Prisoner of Azkhaban (possible spoilers)    As an avid Harry Potter fan, I was keen to see this movie as soon as possible. As a good aunt, I decided to take my nephews along with me. The film drew some controversy over its initial rating, which was M(15+) - ridiculous for a film made from a children's book. Yet, somehow, this film had a darker edge than the others which made for a great - but slightly scary (for the little ones) - third installment.   The rating was eventually reduced to PG (Parental Guidance), which is perhaps more appropriate for the film which shows a darker, more evil wizard world. While the first two films dwelled on the enchantment and excitement of Hogwarts and the Wizards, this film dwelled on the sinister levels of magic that lie beneath the wizarding world, and tends to do little justice for the wonderful balance of good and bad created by J.K Rowling. I will admit that the later novels to tend to focus on the negative quite a bit more than the positive (after all, our protagonist has less exciting magic to be discovered and more evil wizards to defend the wizards against), yet there is still an essence of happiness that pervades them, and perhaps pervaded the first two films much more. I felt that Harry's discovery of Siruis Black and his acceptance of an acclaimed evil prison escapee was far too premature. In fact, I felt that many aspects of the book were rushed in this film - which is why I was surprised when the film ended and I looked at my watch to discover how much time had passed (always a test of a good movie).  My last point about the film was its lack of stylistic consistency with the first two films. The conventions created in the first two films were an important establishment of the visual style of Hogwarts. Whilst the rocky terrain and scenic backdrop of the school added an aesthetic dimension to the film, they did little more than make it obvious that the producers had elected to hire a new director. One of the fantastic things about the Harry Potter books that each installment returns the reader to a familiar alternative world, with elements repeated from book to book. It's a shame that the films couldn't maintain the same consistency, and still create a beautiful film around it. It may be true that Chris Columbus didn't make the best out of Hogwarts (it has become apparent with the superior scenery in this film), however I feel that consistency may be paramount in this case.  Now I'm tired and I've typed too much. It's bedtime. Goodnight.

      Now for a geeky net related interlude: I signed up with  urlLink gmail  the other day, because of its amazing 1GB limit. I'm a lazy arse when it comes to deleting e-mails (you never know when you'll need one of them) and always seem to approach my hotmail limit.  Now I hear hotmail are  urlLink increasing their limit to 250mb  as of next month. It's a welcome increase, particularly including the virus scanning.  I guess now I can get over google's questionable and  urlLink much talked about  (and feared) scanning of e-mails for ads and archiving purposes and just enjoy hotmail's new limit, without having to delete e-mails very often.   The economic rationalists have a good point - competition really does come through for consumers (even when it comes to the "free" service economy of the internet). Course it's not always the case, but it is this time. Huzzah!

       urlLink This little tidbit  came from an understandably amused Alan (alliteration unintentional). You see, the Olsen twins are fair game for jokes. They're twins. They're kinda cute. They've been dressing like they're in their twenties since they were about 12. And the icing on the cake is that we've seen them grow up - since they were wearing nappies and asking for "ouce cream" on full house. Then they started selling their "style" to little girls, including a line of g-strings for 12 year olds, which  I think I remember laughing at in Target one day.   Then the skinny one went and got herself a whole pile of scrutiny from the media for looking painfully thin, and everyone shouted "egads! it's anorexia!".  So, as  urlLink Alan  has brought to light, she has now sought help for her eating disorder, and the twins have consequently  urlLink cancelled their trip to Australia  which is a shame, because I had my Mary Kate and Ashley thong ready for the girls to sign.  On the serious side, I feel that this just proves that the cause behind eating disorders lie far deeper than the media and pressure on girls, such as Mary-Kate, to be constantly skinny. Eating disorders are too complex to be reduced to simply the need to look good - if it was a matter of looking hot, she'd be exercising and eating a strict diet rather than fearing food completely.  There's so much research out there on the matter, and I'm hardly an expert. Yet it is an issue that is personally important, as someone who has experience with an eating disorder. The causes and complexities surrounding obsessive behaviour about food - or limiting it - are so much bigger than just physical appearance. Josephine Brain's incredibly  urlLink interesting article  discusses the dominant cultural narrative on anorexia; it's well worth a read if not slightly convoluted for a light-hearted blog such as this. Yet it makes important ground in tying together theories that stress eating disorders as psychological conditions rather than a simple cave-in to the cultural products around us. Mary Kate, with her access to all the teen literature on eating disorders, and all the minders and employees out there looking out for her safety was no doubt aware of her predisposition to anorexia by virtue of her line of work; yet she still contracted the disease.  I am not saying that the pressures arising from her fame and exposure have not contributed to her eating disorder. I'm saying that there's just more to it than that. So before we get all deterministic and dismiss the media for its negative portrayal of body types, let's look holistically at the problems that give rise to eating disorders, and quit blaming the media for showing skinny chicks. Because, after all, the media only show us what we want to see.

      I ordered tickets to Belle and Sebastian's Melbourne gig today.   I love seeing bands live. I would say that it is one of the greatest musical experiences available. There's something about live music that far surpasses any listening experience, no matter what you might be doing when listening to said music. That's exactly my point - listening to music on a CD is about how you're feeling, what you're doing and where you are in your life when you listen to the music. Seeing a band live is the sheer experience of the band itself, the music and the act of performing it - not about you.  This is Belle and Sebastian's first time in Australia, and their Melbourne gig is their first. Which makes me reflect on how, in my experience, touring bands have dealt with being in Australia, often for the first time.  Ultimately, I guess people can't help bringing out the cliches when it comes to Australia. I guess that's because we do have relatively many cliches. Our physical distance within the western world and consequent uniqueness lends itself to a good many representations of Australia which people are forced to consume. The Crocodile Hunter, and Crocodile Dundee before him have ensured that Australians are portrayed as rather stupid people, with predatory wildlife and a generally backwards, "easygoing mate" attitude. The koala, and kangaroo, and who knows what else - these are all symbols that allow the world to consume Australia in the easiest way possible, really giving little notice to the fact that if it weren't for Australia's isolation, and rich cultural history stemming from Aboriginal residence, Australia would be just like any other western nation. Because, ultimately, that's all we are.  Important, therefore, are these icons, these symbols of Australia that are circulated and perpetuated. When a band comes over here and starts throwing them about, it makes me realise that they really haven't bothered very much with understanding Australia - let alone any inkling of the notion of global culture. And why should they? - they rely on a global homogeneity to tour and sell records worldwide. And at the crux of the matter is the fact that Australia seems to be steeped in a perception of distance, simply because we are considered a Western Country amidst Countries full of non-westerners, when in reality, we probably shouldn't be considered western at all. If it weren't for colonisation and those goddamn convicts, of course....  When I saw Badly Drawn Boy in 2003, he became highly irritated by malfunctioning sound equipment and the unprofessional work of the sound engineers. In Sydney, he threw a widely reported tantrum on stage, much to the shagrin of the audience, a great many of whom dismissed him as another moody artist. In Melbourne, there were a couple of minor problems, and he explained to the audience that the reason he became so angry in Sydney was that he'd come rather far to perform to us - he wanted to make sure that we, the audiences, got good value for our money. And he was spot on - he had come very far, and we were paying a good deal more for the rare treat of seeing him than audiences in England.   For Badly Drawn Boy, that was the extent of his appraisal of Australia. He possibly played a Rolf Harris song, but I can't remember, it's not the point. The point is that there's a lot more complexity in Australia's distance than simply a few unique icons. As far away as we may be, we aren't far away from the area we live in, but the separation is forced by one of foreign surrounding cultures rather than simple geography. Not only are Belle and Sebastian not touring New Zealand or any other Asian country near Australia, they are only touring Australia's east coast (as so many bands seem to).   The icons that people throw about are so false; what's more is that they are less of an expression of uniqueness as they are an attempt to understand Australia as this strange, desolate foreign land that's happily just like any other english-speaking Country. But when it comes to the organisation of the world, that just isn't so.  Globalisation is such a fucked up, complex matter. It's doing my head in. Just accept that if Belle and Sebastian say one thing about Kangaroos or the Croc Hunter, I might lose some respect for them. Maybe just a bit.....

      What a crazy few days. Doped up on pseudoephedrine for a heavy bout of the flu, I had to deal with my sister's kids when her klutz of a husband fell and broke stuff. Thus I experienced a sleepless night, with kids jumping all over me in my fragile state and babies crying. I say "kids" and "babies" in plural, because it seemed like there were a whole lot more of them than there really were. Of course, in these situations, there always are. I breathe a sigh of relief that I have not become a baby making machine quite yet.  So, friday afternoon, I fell asleep. And I didn't really wake up until this (Sunday) morning. It was a glorious 36 hours-or-so filled with medication, hot tea and lots of eerie dreams.   The best part of it is that I just found out Belle and Sebastian are touring Oz at the end of July. Happy Days!

      The weekend so far has consisted of  - Time at the Queen Victoria markets, purchasing beanies, fresh fruit and vegetables and other paraphernalia. Spoke to this guy with the most beautiful dog ever, an  urlLink Alaskan Malamute . Resisted the urge to buy one of those fat bratwurst hot dogs with onion and mustard.  - Reading.  urlLink Marjorie Morningstar . It's a lovely little novel, so far, and I'm about halfway through since ending my time-induced bookreading moratorium.  -Knitting. I bought a scarf pattern and some needles. I've successfully knitted a line of 35 stitches. I'm stuck until I can work out how to do the next line.  -Sipping wine in front of the fire, toasting marshmallows and roasting chestnuts. (We also watched ghostbusters 1 and 2, but this was a blast from the Eighties. Still retro, though not strictly Luddite)  The one exception? I accompanied a friend to a piercing studio today for a jab from a piece of metal. All the knitting, market shopping, reading and wine drinking would have been way too unbalanced, you see. I just had to inject some contemporary life in there somewhere, even if it meant compromising my weekend of relative rest and relaxation.   Tomorrow is a public holiday (queen's birthday), and I'm working in the morning. However, in the afternoon, some friends and I may drive out for a picnic in the country.   I love living in another decade.

      When I have them, I prefer not to write about them. This place isn't really for going into icky details about my life....but since I've adopted it a medium to put thoughts down onto proverbial paper, I've decided to document something for my own future reference.  Tonight, I had a revelation about where my life is and exactly how I am preventing it from being where I want it to be. My head is a constant, crowded, cloudy mess, and I'm ok with that...until it stops me from being happy.  Moments of non-drug induced clarity work wonders. Tomorrow, I will make sure that the clarity I've felt tonight will be perpetuated. It will be there the next day, and the next...until I'm no longer berating myself for being almost mid twenties, and feeling like I failed my teenage self, and all her aspirations.

      I changed the template. It's now less pitifully pink than before. And more modern and sleek. If I had the time and/or inclination, I would make my own. But I have neither. This is better.  I had a whole post set to go before I was rudely dragged away from my computer earlier this afternoon. Now I've forgotten what it was. Basically, it mentioned the fact that I have now exited the realm of the hermit™ and re-entered the realm of real life™.   It's about time.

      Another weekend spent in the confines of four walls, finishing one assignment and studying for an exam.   I am, however, consoling myself with the fact that as soon as Tuesday hits, I will be a free agent. No longer will I be relying on takeout and unhealthy morsels I can find between hours spent agonising over an essay or a flash application. I will have time to exercise, sleep well, eat well, and do all those things other people in normal land do, uninhibited by the confines of a lengthy university degree.  As of this point (and to get me through the next four days), I have begun to make a holiday "to do" list:  1. Learn to knit. Been intending to do so for a long time. Winter is firmly here and many a scarf and beanie are waiting for to be knitted. 2. Play movie catch up. So many titles to see, so little time. Moviegoing has come to a halt over the past month or so - strongly intend to rectify this come break. 3. Create portfolio. Design work needs collating and updating.  4. Give home a good clean. Begin with filing away notes and work, and end up who knows where. A whole pile of unexplained crap seems to have accumulated in the 3 months or so living here. 5. Pay attention to me. Haven't been doing enough of that through semester. May sound corny, but need it. Uni life gets me down, in so many ways. The next 6 weeks will provide me with the necessary time to unwind. 6. Go away on a romantic weekend. Possibly hire boy to accompany me. If can't find boy, resort to company of group of females for girl's trip away. Possibly drink lots and do strange things, part and parcel of spending time in small town with nothing but a local pub and a large population of sheep.

       urlLink Belle and Sebastian  most definitely rocked St Kilda last Saturday night. It's been about a year since I went to an all-out awesome concert, where the music was about the music. Recently, most of the live shows I've been to have involved a lot of tweenagers wearing barely anything, singing loudly along to the music and thoroughly destroying my experience. Thankfully, Belle and Sebastian have not (and never will) be destroyed by that set. They really did put on a great show, complete with crazy lighting and enough mistakes to make a live show thoroughly, enjoyably live.  Onto this morning - it was one of those mornings that you curse yourself for getting out of bed; in fact, I barely even managed to get out of bed. It would suffice to say that I spent most of the morning in class completely mesmerised by the  urlLink Garden State  website. Background music from Frou Frou/the Postal Service/Travis, cool misty/water droplet flash action, and Zach Braff blog. Can't wait for the movie, can't wait for the soundtrack....for now, I'm addicted to the website. Totally.

      First, there's the drugs saga. Our athletes seem to be either  dropping off  &nbsp;like stoned cicadas in a swamp or  urlLink coming back clear with a vengeance &nbsp;(and some dietary supplements).   Then there's  urlLink this guy , who's been granted bail to compete in the olympics based on the whole "innocent until proven guilty thing".&nbsp;I guess the rational part of me thinks that this is the right thing to do, while the rest just laughs at the ludicracy of the situation.   Then there's  urlLink this very unlikely  campaigner on behalf&nbsp;of John Howard's conservative government. It brings a whole new spin on the concept of lower and upper house.   The rest? Unfortunately, there is none for the wicked. I'm suffering from severe sleep depravation on a nightly basis, which ultimately ends in empty mornings full of Al Roker,&nbsp;laziness and no-good - coz I can't seem to haul my tired arse out of the house. Maybe tonight I'll hit the alcohol and send myself off into a blissful sleep of no less than 8 hours.......&nbsp;

      I choose to comment on the  urlLink predictability of all the comments .  I sometimes wonder when it was exactly that I became completely jaded about the repeating rhetoric circulating around the conflict, coming from all sides.

      I suppose I have nothing of interest to say. It happens..often.  I've strained my back, so today is all about lying down, popping anti-inflammatories and watching stuff. Oh the fun.

      Spiderman 2: suck. Shrek 2: win.    I also checked out  urlLink L'Auberge Espagnole (The Spanish Apartment) on dvd. Great film, especially if you've ever spent time travelling or living in another Country. Also dealt nicely with the implications of the EU on the various countries within it - the completely clashing, totally different cultures within the one, enforced, regional umbrella. Also dealt with relationships and the trials and tribulations of studying and getting a job. Light on plot development and narrative, which is cool by me but not so cool if you like that kinda thing. 3.5 stars.  ps - Blogger is uberfucked. All those multiple posts (now deleted) totally returned a page not found error. Plus I couldn't even access my blog. Suckage.

      Wanna know what annoys me? That Ikea stocks nothing in a dark wooden stain. Or very little. Or nothing that I'm looking for. They had the cutest, perfect sized computer desks, in a nasty light wooden colour. Light wood makes me cry! Real tears! And before any smartarse suggests staining the wood myself, the fumes would kill me, so I refuse.   Now that's off my chest, I managed to find a workaround. Smart little workstation, get a handyguy or someone to install shelves on the walls. I need to start sleeping with a carpenter.

      According to http://www.yourmovies.com.au/main.cfm?page=movie_info&title_id=14948,  urlLink Garden State  won't be making it here until December 26.  I don't think that's good enough, frankly. If any execs from Miramax are reading this (I know you guys do. Daily.), you need to fix this up, quick smart! I refuse to wait longer than 2 weeks to see this movie, lest I venture to Thailand to find myself a bootleg copy.  That is all for now, I might just have to tell Zach Braff how unacceptable this is on the comments on his  urlLink blog .
