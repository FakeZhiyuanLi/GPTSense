      No,I aint suffering from alzheimers nor a rare and desirable form of selective amnesia...though I do fake it off and on when my buddies come to ask me the money I owe them.... Today I just woke up to realise..."Hey I am a scientist (not a full blooded one but working towards becoming one soon though) and I have to look like one to fit my role!!" Well,being just 24 and endowed with looks that make me look younger than I already am...it became painfully evident to me that it would be nothing short of a herculean task to sport the look that I wanted to. I started with an uneven haircut....home made and improvised upon...to give the impression that I was rather too busy to visit a saloon. My clothes had to reflect my status quo as well...so out went my jeans and psychedellic green/red Ts and in came loose ill fitting cords,checked shirts,loafers and a horn rimmed spectacle to add the icing on the cake. But still I had this nagging feeling that there was something missing......and then as luck would have had it...reality dawned upon me.....I needed the brains of a scientist too!! Bottomline is that there is nothing that defines a scientist other than attitude.....and for those of you who have had the fortune or misfortune of knowing one....youd soon agree that either you can love them or hate them...theres no middle path about it. Having been in this elite company for a few years....I have met the best and the worst of the ilk....people which our gene pool could have done wonderfully without...and then people without whom our gene pool might not have existed in the first place. Its a mixed bag of sorts...but it doesnt take a man of immense perception and deep insight to realise that the brilliant(est) of minds sport the craziest and funkiest of attitudes too...ppl may call it eccentricity....I prefer to call it "being myself" syndrome. And whether I accept it or not...and as much as I have tried to resist it....the years gone by have left an indellible mark on my psyche.....its inevitable that some of the effects of company that I keep had to rub off on me.....nothing explains the title of this blog any better!!  So in retrospect....."Do I regret my decision of taking up research?"....I ask myself this very often while gazing into the skies,counting stars or sitting by the lake near my house....I ask myself this also while I am gazing at well endowed babes...or counting sheeps or sitting by my spectrometer or bacteria culture at night....and the answer depends upon the ambience!  Its about the closest that u can get to the ultimate truth that girls ( at least the ones worth fantasizing about!!) dont fancy a swing with the intellegentia so to say.The more burgeoise u are the better ur chances of winning in the date and mate game... and of course it doesnt hurt if your surname is Gates,Rothschilds etc and you got a stereo system with the latest sleek Porsche or Lamborghini wrapped around it....  Nerds as our ilk is called find it better to ride a cycle to their office....and I doubt it if our wallets contain anything more useful than the photo of our pet gold fish or dog,a few equations we thought of while we were answering natures call and a long list of guys (6 ft tall,muscular and violent!!) we wish to avoid in case they come around asking for us to solve their assignments or to beat a million shades of shit out of us cos the money we owe them is long over due!  Either way, a scientists life is all about isolation....about social deprievation..all about self inflicted problems and majorly about being an iconoclast. The herd instinct amongst scientists in this regard make sheeps look like independent thinkers!  Err....I think its pretty late to dwelve more into a scientists life and his mind....cos Id be late for work....(though punctuality isnt the hallmark of scientists anyways)...but lemme just wind up with the fact that lifes not a bed of roses ...but neither is it a matress of thorns...and I shall soon get around to elaborating upon the fun aspects of being what I am soon... Till then...try improvising on the equation on my title bar!!!

       urlLink   So,I ultimately decided that I should oblige all my fans out there who were dying to catch a glimpse of the gr8 one in flesh and blood.Well,thats me.....just turned 24....enjoyed every bit of the days gone by and nothings gonna make me change my mind about enjoying every second that comes my way from now as well! These pics are from my trip to Amsterdam and Brussels for Christmas and New Year...yeah I agree that there were pics at better locations that I could have put up...but then it would have been a gross injustice to the architects and the inhabitants of those places...cos all of u would have been too busy swooning over me.Ha ha!!Well...compliments are very welcome....and criticisms if any...I doubt there shall be..but in the rare circumstances that people find it iressistable to let the green eyed monster take over.....please dont hesitate in posting them as well...but dnt expect an answer that exceeds more than 2 words...f&amp;%* yo%!!

      Put the key of despair into the lock of apathy.Turn the knob of mediocrity slowly and open the gates of despondency---welcome to a day in the average office!  Well,its hard enough putting up with an Italian boss (no she doesnt head the mafia and I dont work for 1) but as luck would have had it I was almost going to land up with an Italian lady as Prime Minister of my country!!!Talk about a double blow!  So,back to the office and here I am indulging in my favourite passtime....cursing my boss and the work "it" gives me. Research sucks...it sucks big time and I shall get around to justifying my stance on it pretty soon. The only bright part of being in such a sucked up environment is that I saved up money that I could have invested in a vaccum cleaner.I didnt need anything else around me that would suck and make noises!  Now,what do I have against research??Fundamentally nothing,but sometimes I wonder what research has against it being understood by the common man walking on the road.Primarily,it is my opinion that a research for the benefit of humanity isnt worth it if humanity cant appreciate why it is being done.Lets face it...as scientists ,its appreciation and accolades that are more important than money....ok...mayb I am taking it too far...money does matter...but more often than not scientists are the good samaritans who work for the welfare of society with only an aim of getting recognition...cos they have long given up hopes of getting as much moolah as the smart guys who took up management did...but the present genre of science wierdos as I prefer to call them arent exactly working towards the grander aim of basking in wel earned glory.Come to think of it...only 1 out of a million scientists has lady luck smile on him and then he goes on to win the Nobel...I deliberately left out ladys cos I am not aware of the existence of "gentleman luck" who would care to smile upon the enlightened women of the scientific community....hehe!!  Coming back to the point....so in essence even if 1 does win the Nobel...I guess only a few handful of ppl shall remember ur name...and personally I find it a disgrace to be even nominated for the prize...imagine standing in the ranks of Arafat and Bush(I heard he was a nominee for the peace prize!!!)...Id think of bungee jumping off a bridge with the rope tied around my neck for good measure were such a dubious distinction be conferred upon me....so all ye folks out there in the comittee...do not bother to call me up for the ceremony at Sweden.....I aint coming...but in case u want my bank account number do not hesitate to contact me...a million dollar I can do with!!  Well,the present trends in science suggests to me that its an act of vengeance being performed by ppl who havent been accepted and understood by society and for the same reason they want to retaliate with the same thought by indulging in work that is best left only to another scientist to comprehend. Its rather sad....cos I think the world would be a wonderful place if some of these people stepped down from the pedestal of ego,pride and intellect that they stand on..come down to the level of the common man and explain what they are working on in rather than blabber gibberish and scribble equations on black boards.I wish to be part of that group which shall unify science and the desire to understand it by the common man...I want to be a dream merchant...an idea seller...a bridge..a medium...some1 who shall be remembered by not only the Dr and Profs but also Dick,Tom and Harry....and many many more...

      ....for all those ppl who have already made up their minds that what follows is going to be a para justifying that its really ok to be a son of a b%&$....let me quickly allay all your fears by saying that this is just a favourite line of mine that I picked up from one of the books I was reading.  So,what has views,changes and dogs got to do with any normal mortal who is just about coming to terms that today is a God forsaken Monday.....and its hard enough to come out of ur slumber and perhaps hang over for some and make an act of waking up bright eyed and bushy tailed for yet another week at office...without dogs,views and changes adding to your woes.But the catch phrase is "normal mortals"...living beings I prefer not to address during the course of my blog......Id say that it takes more than a neuron deprieved imbecile(much much more!!) to think and ponder at my level....to perceptively muse over problems that may as well be trivial issue for the not so initiated.  Mayb I should seriously start thinking about Devanism...a form of philosophy I had seriously started preaching while I was at my alma mater a few years ago.I am still pretty much wanted back there...albeit for reasons other than just influencing ppls thoughts and life style.I came to hear that there was a guy who was so taken over by my form of philosophising that he quit studies and the institute to go dwelve into the deeper meaning of life...but I doubt he shall find his answer from the shrink he is seeing now a days!He he!  Monday morning boos (or was it blues?)....and today gives me no particular reason to deprieve myself off the pleasures of being grumpy....and keeping a perennially constipated expression on my face...but come to think of it...it actually works...the boss thinks I have been up all night trying to prepare my data....and my friends think I have been kept busy all night by well endowed German babes called Natalie and Sophie...neither of which happen to be true.  Being celibate and constipated really contribute majorly to waking up as was described above...though for today I shall draw the line at just being celibate...as virgin as mother mary...and hopefully going strong on the path for a few years to come!  Back to square 1.......why talk about views not changing unless we are the lead dogs?? Frankly...I dont know..and I dont care.....but hey...lemme admit.....it really feels good to have the view that I currently enjoy...it remains to be answered whether I am a canine or not...lets leave that question to another monday shall we??

      Seems paradoxical to say the least.A beautiful sunny morning,nestled in the heart of a beautiful country in Europe,good money,good food,good job and for those of you who value bachelorhood....no wife as well!So,could a guy who has seen a quarter of a century go by (almost!) be any happier? I asked myself...and others as well...usually over a nice kilkenney or  a chilled draught beer at the Irish pub...that explains the title of my first blog......sadly I didnt get much from this...except for an irritated chin that I scratched so that it would seem as if I was musing hard on this philosophical question and maybe lost some weight...its amazing how much they charge u for the "free Irish spirit"!! Ladies and gentlemen,boys and girls...the answer I narrowed down to is procrastination...I had to sieve carefully thru the opinions and advice given to me and trust me it wasnt easy....but when the answer hits u...it really hits u hard...that its not worth doing today what u can put off doing until tommorow.Unfortunately my boss agrees to disagree on that...but then we share our differences in opinion in other matters as well....my opinion being that all bosses are  to put it mildly...a pain in the far end of ur ailmentry canal.So,anyways coming back to where we started...or was this the universal solution to all our woes??I am sure procrastination would have at least avoided the current crisis in Iraq though! Before I loose my way in the maze of my thoughts....lemme just conclude my first blog by advocating that do not do something today that d better be done tommorow..and do not do something that ur boss tells u to do anyways... Nothing explains the chaos and mayhem in this world better than smart ass people taking decisons and acting upon them sooner than was necessary. and in case any1 wonders.....today was that tommorow that I had thought of months ago that Id start blogging.....so much for procrastination!!
