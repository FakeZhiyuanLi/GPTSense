      &nbsp; Since I have started this blog midway through summer, I`ll recall what I have done thus far.&nbsp; On May 21... The class of 2004 graduated from Hatley Highschool.&nbsp; No, I wasnt one of them fortunately.&nbsp; Why am I happy you ask? Well, unlike most people I actually like highschool. Anyways ill get into this later...  &nbsp;  &nbsp; I was asked to be an usher for graduation ( basically each usher had different duties to do, i passed out pamplets at the gate lol )&nbsp; It was really sad to see some of the people go, ill miss a few of them.&nbsp; After graduation was over, I went home to change.&nbsp; My friends Drew, Callie, Jake, and Jamey were going to go eat at&nbsp;a local steakhouse ( i think people from out-of-state call them mom and pop joints..)&nbsp; We ate and had a good time.&nbsp; Afterwards we went to Jake's house and got in his hot tub, nothing really happened after that.&nbsp; We all talked then went home.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp; I woke up the next morning around 11 o`clock expecting to get ready for our trip to Florida, which we were to leave earlier that morning.&nbsp; To give a quick history of this trip, its kind of a tradition that we started. I grew up with a group of kids who all live in the same neighborhood. They are Jake, Jenna, and Brea.&nbsp;&nbsp;My cousin Brittany moved in to that neighborhood later on ( me and Brittany have been together since we were born, we are the same age)&nbsp; Anyways we all go on a trip every year, last year we went to Florida and we really enjoyed it.&nbsp; This year however a friend of our parent's ( Mrs. Christina) father had a stroke and delayed the trip a few hours ( it was worth waiting for )&nbsp; Anyways the trip to Florida was very interesing.&nbsp; Jenna didnt go because she graduated and went with her boyfriend to travel the country with his grandmother..... yea or something like that.&nbsp; On the way up there it was my mom, brittany, jake, and I in my mothers SUV.&nbsp; We always make each other laugh and was a very enjoyable, but long, 8 hour drive to Ft. Walton, Florida.&nbsp; We didnt get there till late night, about 1 am.&nbsp; We were drained so we went to bed almost immediately after arriving, except for my mother and aunt who went to a local grocery store for food.&nbsp; The next few days were amazing.&nbsp; The beach was crystal&nbsp;clear, waves were big on some days, no seaweed, no jellyfish stings, no sunburns ( for me!).&nbsp; There&nbsp; was one or two days were the beach had to be searched because there was an invasion of Portugese Man-o-War's&nbsp; ( a type of cnidarian related to the jellyfish, commonly believed to be a jellyfish)&nbsp; The funny thing is, my 10 year old cousin ( Blake ) caught 3 OF THEM.&nbsp; I took some pictures of them and of Florida that i will post in a bit.&nbsp; Thats really all that happened but it was great!&nbsp;  &nbsp;   &nbsp;
