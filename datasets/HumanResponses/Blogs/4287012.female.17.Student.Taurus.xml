       Today is a day of mixed emotions... what can I say? But in actual fact, ever since i entered poly, everyday seemed to be a day of mixed emotions. I met him, and i'm still not very sure if what i felt for him was a crush or something stronger. Geez... can anyone tell me what i am feeling now?  Do i really like him in that sense, or am i hoping for a brother-character in poly?  Hey! Whoever my cupid is, please come to my dream sometime and answer that question?  Other than that kind of problems, I'm having a serious writer's block for all my stories, and not to mention for the first time in my life using the internet, i ran out of things to download. How can that be possible? I ran out of shows, entertainment programs to download! Like... wow?  Oh right... and there's the common test coming up... and guess what? i haven't touch a single subject... Am really bucking for a failing grade. spent the entire study break wk watching tv... lazing around, writing stories, getting fat... Oh great... i can never study at home!  While on the subject of home, after spending loads of time with my com, i made a few 5566 pics... kinda cool, i must say... ^o^ if you like 5566, continue scrolling down. liked the pics so much i set it as my wallpaper and printed it out to paste on my wall! haha...  Hopefully, i can continue with his blog... at least the template's not as dead as my previous one.  If you want, leave comments... and ask qn... just don't expect me to answer all of them.. >_^
