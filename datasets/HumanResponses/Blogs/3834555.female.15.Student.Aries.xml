       hahaha, i was going to make my letter color black... i dont think that would have worked though!&nbsp; holy moley,&nbsp; on wensday the weirdest thing happened. ok, so to some of you your going to be like "riiight, ok..." and others are gonna be like "w/e!" but this is what happened... Heather, Nathanail and i were at chapel at camp, but we were outside counting offering money... so Heather wants to go back to the hotel cuz we have to leave at 3:30am and she's like "hey, Karsen will you go get Nathanails stuff from out of chapel??"&nbsp; so i walk into the chapel hall to get the bags... so i am kneeling down grabbing toys and stuffing them into a bag when the guy speaking, Pastor&nbsp;Jeffery goes "ok, everyone pause, i need to say something for someone here.. this is TOTALLY off the subject but i feel God calling me to say this" so everyone stopped fidging and stuff and looked up at him waiting.. i just kept stuffing toys into bags not paying attention when Jeffery goes "there is someone out there, in this room, a young woman, who needs to hear this" and i am still stuffing toys blah blah blah when the most jdklfjkd part comes... Jeffery just says this " be careful you like, because you just might fall in love with them" ok, so at that point i was just like "YEAH, i KNOW that!" then he goes " you cant help who&nbsp;you love, your heart tells you,&nbsp;love is a unexplianable feeling no one will understand..&nbsp; until they feel it..but, all this confustion will die. all the heart ache will lead to heart full, just love GOD with all your heart! He knows what you want and will not betray you, or leave you.... or hurt you.&nbsp; everything will be ok." i seriously starting bawling right there... ok, not BAWLING but crying... i have never felt so.. talked to in my life... camp is going to be sooo awesome! God is going to rock the places roof off! and even if i am feeling alone with all my friends and i am heart hurting God will fix everything, cuz GOD loves me!! ... so this concludes by this: i am not telling Kasey, whatever happens.. happens. yes, it hurts the worst waiting, but GOD is there and He is the one i should focus on right now, not Kasey... not like that anyway. Kasey is my BEST FRIEND and that he will stay.

      I wake up in the morning Put on my face The one that's gonna get me Through another day Doesn't really matterHow I feel inside 'Cause life is like a game sometimes  But then you came around me The walls just disappeared Nothing to surround me And keep me from my fears I'm unprotected See how I've opened up Oh, you've made me trust  Because I've nver felt like this before I'm nakedAround you Does it show? You see right through me And I can't hide I'm nakedAround you And it feels so right  I'm tyring to remember Why I was afraid To be myself and let the Covers fall away I guess I never had someone like you To help me, to help me fit In my skin  I never felt like this before I'm nakedAround you Does it show? You see right through me And I can't hide I'm naked Around you And it feels so right  I'm naked Oh oh yeah Does it show? Yeah, I'm naked  Oh oh, yeah yeah I'm so naked around you And I can't hide You're gonna see right through, baby

      i never got to talk to Kasey today:/ i mean, i had full intentions of doing it but we were never alone, Jake like followed us everywhere! and whenever we would go to talk he'd be like "ahh! Kasey's lover is gone so he is talking to karsen!!!"&nbsp; i pretty much just ignored him but Kasey would run after him and beat him with a stick or something... which was quite amusing! &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; gosh, i leave to spend the night at Heathers tonight then i am going Sr. camp and yeah, i just got off the phone with Lindsey and she was like "just have a wicked time, dont worry bout anything!" how can i NOT worry!?!?!? i am going to miss my best friends birthday party, i am having difficulties with telling Kasey stuff, Lindsey is hurting and doesnt want to talk about it and yeah, i am seriously sooooooooooooo exhauseted!! and my overy pain is coming back:/ grrrrrrr! i am just going to go try to calling Kasey and then go to sleep before i leave for Heathers. bye everyone!! i will miss you!!!

      *ROOOOOOOOOOOAR* I just made this post and i went to publish it and it got deleted! so now i have to start all over!! ok, so, this is what i am thinking.... and freaking out about...&nbsp; I think i am going to tell Kasey how i really feel about him tommorow... before we leave the picnic, cuz then i wont see him for a week and yeah, i can avoid him!! but you know, i just feel like it would un-complicate alot of things... like he would be a little less clueless on alot of why i feel the&nbsp;way i do about him and Lindsey. his puzzle pieces might come together alot easier.... SO. these are my choices... &nbsp; tommorow have an AWESOME time with him and&nbsp;then right before i leave tell him how feel and just kinda talk it out... i dont know HOW i am going to tell him though.... it'll pry be a spur of the moment thing, ya know? so, yeah, i'd tell him then run away to Sr. High camp for a week and totally avoid him and try to get myself together again before i come home.. then when i get home call Lindsey and try to find out what he has said while i was gone about me telling him and then go to Jr. High camp with him and either: A.) avoid him and hang out with everyone else.. and only look at him when hes not noticing or B.) hang with him and act like nothing happened! &nbsp; OR  &nbsp; i could just not tell him at all in the first place and whenever i see him feel guilty i am not telling him something and whenever i am with him act like everything is totally normal, while for real on the inside i am freaking out and there are fireowrks and knifes and love and hurt and just CRAZY feelings!! that he doesnt know about... &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;i am voting for the "tell him and run away for a week" choice!!!! but, i better decide fast..... CRAP! i dont know, can everyone just pray like crazy and yeah, we'll see what happens!

       "Graduation (Friends Forever)"   And so we talked all night about the rest of our lives Where we're gonna be when we turn 25 I keep thinking times will never change Keep on thinking things will always be the same But when we leave this year we won't be coming back No more hanging out cause we're on a different track And if you got something that you need to say You better say it right now cause you don't have another day Cause we're moving on and we can't slow down These memories are playing like a film without sound And I keep thinking of that night in June  I didn't know much of love But it came too soon And there was me and you And then we got real blue Stay at home talking on the telephone We'd get so excited, we'd get so scared Laughing at ourselves thinking life's not fair And this is how it feels  [1] - As we go on We remember All the times we Had together And as our lives change Come Whatever We will still be Friends Forever  So if we get the big jobs And we make the big money When we look back now Will our jokes still be funny? Will we still remember everything we learned in school? Still be trying to break every single rule Will little brainy Bobby be the stockbroker man? Will Heather find a job that won't interfere with her tan? I keep, I keep thinking that it's not goodbye Keep on thinking it's a time to fly And this is how it feels  [Repeat 1]  La, la, la, la: Yeah, yeah, yeah La, la, la, la: We will still be friends forever  Will we think about tomorrow like we think about now? Can we survive it out there? Can we make it somehow? I guess I thought that this would never end And suddenly it's like we're women and men Will the past be a shadow that will follow us 'round? Will these memories fade when I leave this town I keep, I keep thinking that it's not goodbye Keep on thinking it's a time to fly  [Repeat 1 (3x)]

      hmmm, i was just trying to think of a word to explian my feelings... not happening. hey i have an awesome sying for y'all... or not a saying, just somthing i heard and has stuck with me..  "Have you ever had a feeling; no defition, no name? just a..feeling?"  its off a John Reuben cd i have. that means alot to me... so much stuff has been going on in my life latley and i hate talking to people now, cuz i whine about my life sooo much and there are other girls out in this world that have it SO much worse than me. so, i go back to wearing a mask everyday, i am now "hppy Karsen" and then i come home and empty all my feelings on a paper and burn it or i just cry it all out. thats what i used to do and every one thought i was so happy and so tight with God.. i mean i AM tight with God now, i have been working super hard on mending our relationship, but i am not happy. well, i have great days were life is good then one day, just one random day.. it all gets turned upsidedown, in a bad way, like i am a TOTAL mess and i feel like my life is a mistake. thats what yesterday was. or last night anywaz, i spent the night at Lindsey's and i just broke down, i just talked and whined and cried. it was HORRIBLE! Lindsey and Carrie were probably like "will you plez just shut up and let us sleep!?!" one thing thats been really bothering me bad is that some of my friends think i lie to them and keep things from them. like for instance, Kasey wrote Lindsey this note on thursday when i was sitting by him, i KNEW it was about me, or parts were so i was like "can i read it?" and he said no, so i just let it be. then he would tease me with it and stuff and grrr, just piss me off. but, since he thinks im blind he wrote the whole note totally in veiw of me, so, naturally, i read it! which, yes, i will tell him i did at church. Kasey thinks i lie to him and that alot i say about my past is a lie and just so i can get attention. he's my BEST FRIEND, why would he lead me on to think he believed me and say these thing and then turn around to Lindsey and be like "oh, i think she does it for attention" really, he is fading so fast, he never calls me, or writes me or even talks to me about ANYTHING barley. everything to him is Lindsey. i guess i just feel let down. i am losing my best friend and i cant do anything, i just have to let him go. tommorow i am going to talk to him and tell him that i read the note and just tell him that if he is done with me then to say so. but, this hurts sooo much, you have no fricken idea, i LOVE him and now, i cant do a thing. he has no idea how i feel about him either, i am thinking about telling him that too, just to get it out and then maybe i can go on. i dont know. i really cant take this, i mean, when i went down to the creek with Lindsey and Carrie and i saw "i love KC" written on the wall and Carrie was like "lindsey was expressing herself through graffiti" i felt like i got punched in the stomache. i tried so hard not to look at the words but i was like a deer in headlights, i couldnt NOT look. i dont blame Lindsey, i dont even blame Kasey, it just hurts so bad because Kasey and i have been so tight for so long and i have liked him for like 2 years and he liked me for a while then after like what? 6 monthes, he falls for someone totally opposite of him, i love Lindsey to pieces, shes my best girl friend, but i just dont understand, i just dont get it. after tommorow i have no idea what is going to happen to Kasey and I's best friendship, i wish i could fix this, but like Lindsey said "maybe i just have to let it lay" and wait... this is going to be the hardest thing i ever have to do, plez, plez pray for me!!

       Clothes     Clothes aren't what they used to be They don't seem to fit you and me, anymore Modesty is out the door Flaunting what we've got and more is in Yeah, it's in   They're sayin' "Don't ask why, just wear what we say You'll look like a model if you'll only obey To get the attention, just do what we say"   Pay so much for clothes so small Was this shirt made for me or my doll? Is this all I get? I looked so hot but caught a cold I was doing just what I was told  To fit in    Chorus   We're sayin'  "Let's ask why, don't wear what they say Don't want to be a model; they can't eat anyway That kind of attention will fade with the day So, I'll stand up and say. . .  Clothes that fit are fine Won't show what's mine Don't change my mind I'll be fine   i love this song too! its by Barlow Girl!! you can go to their website at   www.barlowgirl.com  THEY ROCK!!!

      GRRRRR.... why must Jessica be Satan spawn today!?!? i can already tell that she is going to be a jerk to me all day today! she just has these "hate Karsen" dayz... and i really dont do ANYTHING to her! i mean, i have only been up for like 2 hours and in those two hours i have only seen her for like 30 min! if that! and now she hates me:/ i am in a huuuuuuge pickle:O i leave for Footloose camp on Monday and i am starting to pack cuz i only have today and friday day to pack. my team color is RED (!) so i have to bring as much red clothing i can to wear... including like hair stuff. bracelets.. EVERYTHING!! which is acually pretty easy for me, cuz i only have black, red and one green and one blue shirts. so i can bring like 5 red shirts, 3 pairs of shorts that have lots of red on them and my red pj pants, plus i am bringing my black stuff too... for my show costume and to wear.... but that leaves me with NOTHING to wear today!! i could wear my black jeans but they are dirty and i have to wear them tommorow.... i already have to take one pair of shorts out of my bag for Saturday... so, i went to ask Jessica if i could wear a pair of her shorts tonight and she was like "no. you'll get them dirty and i dont want to smell like you." so i tried to convince her.... but nooooooooo. and just YESTERDAY i let her wear one of MY shirts! so now i have NO idea WHAT i am going to wear tonight?!!?!? i pry have to UNPACK my shorts and wear a pair of those! goll, i HATE "hate Karsen" dayz!! grrrrrr...

      yeah, i not feeling very talkitive... it was weird, i called Lindsey while i was at Albertsons and i wasnt like this at all and then when i got home Lindsey and i were on the phone for like 30 minutes and i barely said a thing. i am feeling very out of it, like fdkltujdklsfj... i dont know... and i had a really weird dream last nigh, i told Lindsey part of it, but not all...   It was like i was at the 4h of July thing with Kasey but it was at MY house... like all the same people were there, but then Satan came and took over my house and everyone here... and he was making us paint the WHOLE house black and like everyone gave their souls to the Devil and even Kasey did! and i wouldnt bow down so Satan turned Kasey on me and was like "she HAS to bow down" and i was like trying to tell Kasey that Satan was bad but Kasey just smacked me to the ground and was like "BOW TO HIM!" and i tried to run away and when i was like running out the door Kasey grabbed my hair and slit my wrist and then Satan grabbed me and was like raping me and whispering in my ear "come daughter and you can have the love you wanted for so long" and Kasey was in the background like chanting and watching Satan violate me and then Kasey came and slit my other wrist right then i looked up and i saw Lindseys face but as an angel and Jesus was by her side and Lindsey just shook her head at me and reached out to help me but then Satan grabbed me and threw me into Kasey and he slit my throat and i layed in is arms bleeding to death.. but like the whole time i was dying Lindsey and Jesuslooked down on me and cried.... i woke up twiching and i was sooo freaked out... like i want to call Kasey and Lindsey sooo bad but it was like 7:00am and Lindsey was sleeping and Kasey's at his gradparents house... i almost cried... these nightmares i have been having are starting to freak me out... like i dont want to go to bed but i feel so sick on theinside, i really need sleep... i really want to go to be with Lindsey:*( she makes life seem so much...happier for me.

      I got some kind of upseting news tonight from Jake about my Lindseykins.... but i dont know if i can trust him. Lindsey always gets on my cussing and "border line" language, but tonight when Kasey was like filthed mouthed and i was like "Lindsey wouldnt like to hear you talking like that Kase" he just kinda laughed and Jake was like "why would she care??" i was like "Lindsey doesnt cuss" and Kasey goes "she almost did at her birthday party!" and Jake was like "she does on AIM!! like when she saw my 'hairdownthere' screen name, she was like 'What the Fu**!!' and she always cusses other times too" i just kinda was like "oh, i didnt know that" i think Kasey noticed it bugged me cuz he changed the subject after that. but why would Lindsey get all on MY case when she does it too? even using the F word! i NEVER use that word, unless i am super upset or in trouble. another thing that kinda bugged me was her listening to Korn. she was all like "i listened to it the other night and it was Satan!' so she broke the cd and said she wouldnt listen to it anymore! she promised me and i promised her i wouldnt listen to secular music AT ALL when she only gave up Korn, now, i know she loves them and its hard for her.... but if it was so bad for her to listen to it the other night like it was Satan then why did she listen to it LAST NIGHT!??!!? or whenever?! but, it was after the Satan thing! i dont know, that just confuses me... and i have been trying so hard with this Christian only thing, which is really hard, like tonight at Kasey's he put on a cd and i was like "i cant listen to secular music" and he was like "WHAT!!? why?" and i just go "Lindsey and i have a deal, im doing it for her" and he was like "thats stupid" and turned it up louder and pulled me over to the speaker and was all like "listen to it, isnt it nice?" in his freaky Satan voice... i dont know, its just not making much sense. i really just hope Lindsey isnt lying to me, cuz that would really burn...well, i gtg... bye!
