      That song was played through our cart today lol, as well as a good amountitude of patriotage buuuddy.   I have yet to eat or drink today so I am on a second wind and sort of hyper. I woke up with an attitude that reminded me of my english teacher this morning.  "I do not know how much I could ever trust a thing that bleeds nearly immensely for several days straight and does not die..." -James Francoeur in regards to females...yes...my english teacher said this to our class. I do not know where he got it from, but it came to mind and got me to laugh a bit this morning.  Now that you are a bit freaked out...the parades went well and once more Engineer Dave teased me about being the only female. The candy cannon worked well too. It allowed us to demonstrate that there are two different forms of "Ah"  There is the one which is amazed, such as: Ohhh, Ahhh, look at the fireworks!  And there is one which is terrified, such as: AH!!! HOLY SHIT WHAT WAS THAT?!?!?!?!  Both were heard today. About three people got hit in the head by candy. We started saying "Heads up" and all people would do was look up just to get konked. Or they would be like, "Why heads up?"   clunk  , "Oh."  No rain! Beautiful day...a bit buggy though.   lol, we had to use my dad's truck battery in our cart...sucker...lol.   Nah, just messing. It was a lot of fun today.  Daaang, I need to clean.  Have a good day!  -J9

      Today: I shopped with my mom and she ended up getting a few shirts. I, myself, decided to save myself some dignity and did not look for shorts or anything or that sort and bought two shirts -green and white-, along with a belt that includes buttons of Einstein, a robot, and one that says "COFFEE NOW" lol. Perfect for Battlecry.   Then, stopped in to wish my brother well in his new home in Atlanta, Georgia with Laine (who was away working).  Nextly, went to see  The Day After Tomorrow . Definitely not what it is cracked up to be, trust me.  Following, played pool at A&G's to kill time before next movie. Please not that I did horribly. A few nice shots here and there, but that was all.  Lastly, went to see  Van Helsing . The parts I saw did not seem very spectacular but I do not wish to give much of an opinion as seeing that I slept through seriously 85%. However, I did see about 10%. The other 5%, I was outside the theatre in the lobby or on the phone lol. Greeeat.   Got home around 1:08AM after a quick pit stop at Dunkin Donuts.   Now, I am about to fall asleep here typing. Therefore, I am going to get something to drink, as seeing that I am terribly thirsty, and then go to sleep, as seeing that I have to wake up at 6:15AM in order to get to the high school for 7AM to load up stuff to get to Suffield a short time later to decorate the truck and march in that parade. Then, rush back to Windsor Locks and march again. Rain is expected, folks.   Good night  -J9

      I will keep this short since I am probably going to update again tonight anyways. I'm wicked curious as to some sort of "good news" that I have been hearing all about. I hope that this person will give me a call at some point today when they have time.   Days plan: Shopping with the mother, BQ for my brother Josh who is moving to Atlanta with his girlfriend Laine, then I suspect nothing.  Last night I actually got to play pool. I have actually gotten better. Everytime someone left me with solids I did horribly for some reason. I always tried to sink the 15 ball first, and whenever I did, I seemed to have a better game. I am so weird lol.   Anyways, keeping it short...I hope you have a good day!    ::sunburn...ouch...at least I wore a hat yesterday...but my shoulders are killing me!::

      I woke up this morning after having gone to bed at 5:30am at 7:15am to see the sun brightly shining and to hear news that it was to be a beautiful weekend. Since a train seemed out of the question, the canal was calling me.   I get dressed for it, pack a bag, and make a plan.  As I head out my stepmom was in a very sour mood. She went off on us and I decided to stay in and purge my anger on cleaning every square inch of my bedroom. That did not last long. I could not tolerate being here. So instead, I set off on my walk. As I went on my way I decided that since I got and hour and 45 minutes worth of sleep and had nothing to eat or drink, that I should probably get something. On my way, the stepmom catches up and apologizes so we are all good again. Lunch, la ti da, canal. Walked it. Saw a lot of wildlife:  Cardinals, blue jays, pigeons, snakes, turtles, fishies, ducks, butterflies, dragonflies, people...lol  I was being dumb and decided to poke the snake with a stick. It did nothing so "Hmmm, maybe it is dead," thinks J9...   ::poke::   J9 discovered the snake was, in fact, NOT DEAD. How one may ask? It becomes fairly apparent after it lashes out at you. Yeah, go J9...you are a winner...lol  One of the two highlights of the walk was talking to a very amiable older gentleman who had spent a good amount of time on the canal. According to him (his name is Dick, by the way), I am very serious about my walking lol.   The second, was laying down underneath the train bridge. I waited for the train that I could have potentially been on to pass directly overhead and then stared at the water. I saw a few fish come up to feed which was pretty nifty.   Anyways, after getting home I collapsed feeling very out of shape. My ankles feel as though they are ready to break and the pads of my feet are burning. The worst part...I do not think that I surpassed 15 sit-ups because I was just that wiped.   As soon as I recover a bit I will probably clean a bit more and head out again.   I have no idea if I have plans or not tonight. Oh well. I should probably just finish my room so that I have a place to sleep tonight...assuming that I do that anyways.   Well, I shall end this post right about...  no no no a little more to the right                                                            There you go                                                            Right here.  See y'all later lol

      Well, I made it to Friday. However, that does not mean that it was necessarily easy by any means. The situation sprouting from Stonewall Speakers continues to become more and more absurd and I am very worried about the career/reputation of a certain teacher involved. Today, all-in-all, definitely could have been much better. This morning I at least woke up on time. I still, however, managed to forget to get hocked up on allergy medication before I left the house. Go me.   English - Francoeur was absent so I finished Macbeth to show off on Tuesday,   Contemporary American Issues - went online and read my friend Rob (from Lego Maniacs) astrology section of his website. I must admit that it was pretty funny,   Study - I read  Sense and Sensibility  and am now past the 100 page mark,   Spanish - test, quite possibly the most difficult that I have taken in that course yet and I am pretty worried about the results,   Precalculus - by then most of the school was absent in order to prepare for the senior ball and Panaccione did not feel like doing anything...so we did nothing...except critique a quiz that I barely finished   US History - someone dropped athree of spades out the window and the remainder of the class was spent trying to retrieve it using a paper cup covered in masking tape attached to a paperclip chain and ribbon. It rained a lot today making the card very soggy and very impossible to obtain. Seeing about 95% of my class hanging out a window trying to complete the task was very funny, however.   That was my "academic" day.  Wow, either something is wrong with the pipes in my closet, there is a rather large bee in here, or someone needs to stop snoring. That sound is kind of eerie.   Anyways, tonight was supposed to be a trip to On the Border, a very good Mexican restuarant about 45 minutes away from here with Rob, Jon, Emily, Paul, Lauren, Danielle, and Miranda...however...I received no phone call and come to find out the ride had yet to get everything all set with his car...so therefore it was not happening. And, I did not get my amp.   Instead, Heather, Ashley, Shawn, and I had decided to go play pool at either A&G's or Mad Maggie's instead of bowling because I really just was not up to it. Well, I walked to Papa Gino's where they were all going to meet up with me and about halfway through my walk I decided that it had been all-together too long since I had last spoken to Tycho so I called - voicemail - okay. Soon enough I got a call back and got myself pretty worked up. We talked for a while and I just chilled on the stone bench in from of the restaurant. He had to go to get on the train :-(  They arrived pretty late, and as soon as they pulled in I saw (and smelled) why. The tender radiator of his precious Honda CRX had blown and the engine was smoking like crazy. They had to call their dad, a cool dude, to come over to help since they live in Agawam and were then in Windsor Locks. He brought water, paper towels, some tools, and...  Drumroll please...  DUCT TAPE!  We ate, got haunted by a stupid game (which I figured out, thank you very much!), and left to go back to Shawn and Heather's house. We ended up just sitting there chatting about the rules of FIRST and watching Happy Gilmore. I missed a portion because I got a phone call, which I was very glad to receive and had decided to step out for a little while where I again managed to work myself up, make a decision, and listen to a bunch of drunken dudes in their backyard.   Now tomorrow, I am going to see about making a little trip. I can actually research it a bit now that I have set my computer back up. Come to find out, the guy that fixed my computer kept my power cord...so I thought that I was screwed until I remembered that I once had a laptop and I took the adaptor from that power cord and it is evidently working fine. Actually, this Windows Millenium could be worse. It is working very well, and very swiftly for me. No complaints yet.   Um, yeah, I have talked a lot and I am sorry if I had gotten you very bored. I shall stop and check up on my trip.  Buenos dias, tardes, and noches todos!  -J9

      Wow, my second day into using this journal and go figure that some things have begun pointing down...already!  I really need to move or something because I really do not feel that it is healthy that I cannot even tolerate the presence of a good majority of my class. Hearing their voices whining or whatever day in and day out has really taken a huge toll on me. I really have never been more stressed than I am today.   Elections are over anyways, and the results are just how they should be:  Billy K - President  David N - Vice President  Shannon R - Treasurer (meh...) Cristina Z - Secretary  Come to find out there is a public relations position that has been added to the grades below me. Go figure! The one thing that I would actually run for!  ::grumbles::   None of my classes were bad, minus my classmates being present. It was one of those days where I just did not want to speak to any of them, but go figure I ended up talking briefly to Bill...who I really did not want to...,Rils, Shannon, Wild Bill, and Sjodin. Oh well. I suck at that "cold shoulder" thing.   My mind was definitely wondering worse than normal today. My largest amount of focus was in English this morning where I got to be Murderer #1 in MacBeth. Appropriate for my mood anyways...JUST KIDDING.   Got home to see that my stepmom and sister-in-law were home which really added to everything because the whole OCD thing so I needed a loooong walk. So I have walked to the library. Now that I have read what I wished to read, I feel that I may venture further. Maybe I will head out to East Windsor. I am trying to pick a destination since I just want to be far away but I cannot really think of anything. And now I am just rambling. Sorry.   If only time would go faster.   I think I am off to read  Sense and Sensibility  for a while. Once I get bored with that I will probably stop somewhere and eat dinner...maybe...before I figure out a way home from how far away I am. Canal...now there is an idea!  Have a good evening!  -J9

      Okay, so LiveJournal was starting to get annoying because people that I did not want reading it were, in fact, reading it frequently. I hope that I am welcome here! And hopefully this is the first post of many...even though I would imagine that no one is going to read this for a while. Although, this site had already given me a good spot of trouble today. I hope it is just an off-day because it is the 25th. What a day to start my new journal on :-/    Go figure.   Well, award ceremony tomorrow...meaning I get to find out what I got exactly...while simultaneously missing my meeting. Blast! I sent the e-mail to Dave so it should be all good. Wow. Now that I am using this I have to remember that basically none of my former readers are reading this so everything that I am saying is basically going to be irrelevant. Er, I suppose that I shall need to use my best discretion in choosing who to tell about this journal.   ::taps keyboard::  Yeeeah, k...well, I suppose that I am going to run and assume that this post will publish now. Hopefully I will get  someone  to read it by the end of the night. Talk to y'all later...er...maybe not...   -J9

      Well I saw you with your hands above your head Spinning around, trying not to look down But you did, and you fell, hard on the ground Then you stumbled around for a good ten minutes And I said I'd never seen anyone look so dumb before And you laughed and said I still know how to turn you on though  You're the only one who Drags me kicking and screaming through fast dreams You're the only one who Knows exactly what I mean  And I probably forgot to tell you this Like that time I forgot to tell you about the scar Remember how uncomfortable that made you feel? See you're not what I expected But you're the only one who knows how to handle me And you're such a great kisser and I know that you agree  You're the only one who Drags me kicking and screaming through fast dreams You're the only one who Knows exactly what I mean  I hope you can forgive me for that time When I put my hand between your legs And said it was small Cuz its really not at all I guess there's just a part of me that likes to bring you down Just to keep you around Cuz the day you realize how amazing you are  You're gonna leave me  You're the only one who Holds my hair back when I'm drunk and get sick You're the only one who Knows exactly what I mean  You're the only one who Drags me kicking and screaming through fast dreams You're the only one who Knows exactly what I mean  Exactly what I mean  Well I saw you with your hands above your head Spinning around, trying not to look down But you did, and you fell, hard on the ground   You're The Only One by Maria Mena

      I rely quite heavily on symbolism and karma.   Everything happens for a reason. Whether or not we see that depends how how we interpret our situations and the circumstances surrounding them - Me  Well, I interpreted something new this morning.  I slept with my space heater because it was comforting to have that direct heat on my back. Especially when I am lonely.  This morning Tycho called me.  I burned myself on that heater. Actually, the shape of the faceplate is now burned onto my skin. That hurt so incredibly bad.  But it was a wake up call.   I do not need it anymore.   I have what I really need.   Matt.   I really am not alone.

      Alright, last night's post probably got a little bit fuzzy (aw, how cute!) because I continuously began to nod off. It was probably from the sleep pattern from the previous couple of days. Oh well, I am good now.   Today, I do not even remember waking up really.   Nevermind, got it. My dad yelled for me to come to breakfast. That is a decent thing to wake up to. "Home-cooked food, something that you learn a fine appreciation for in the FIRST robotics program" - Jonathan D. Fournier circa 2000. How true.  Too bad last night I ate a lot lol. Do not give me that look. I'm serious. Ate Andy Capp's Hot Fries (a lot of them) with Sobe green tea at the rest stop, chicken/spinach salad from Wendy's, baked potato from Wendy's, and then two chocolate chip cookies at the bowling alley. I wanted starchy things for whatever reason. It was bizzare, and I kept mocking it.   But anyways, back on track, kids.   I want to walk that huge hill again...odd.  Two graduation parties today which I nearly somehow forgot about. Wrote up shell cards for both James and Marie. Yes, a shell card for James...muhuhahaha.  Walked to Marie's house, not trusting myself with her gift. She will get it eventually. For those who do not know, it was a birthday/graduation party. Now spiffy is that? Got there and chilled with her and her friend Jennifer from Enfield. Played a bit of soccer before Marie opened gifts and then I had to run over to James. His friend Jill gave him a DVD. A wonderful DVD I might add. Monty Python and the Holy Grail I might add. Beautious. We watched that and go figure everyone there knew it all lol. We want to make a broadway version...so be prepared for that. James noted my lack of hyperness-i-tude, buddy. Poo, I was still tired, and am a bit depressed from missing someone. Hell, James never met the kid and he said something along the lines of Tycho being the best for me. Thank you for that James. Remember, Tuesday...it is you, Monika, myself, and Eric the Viking lol. You need to tell me what food to have. I already know that I need root beer for you. I will give you more details such as timeage later.   So today was decent, I enjoyed it anyways.   I need to go to WalMart and get my glasses fixed. This whole "falling off of my face" thing is really ticking me off. Arg.   Anyways, more of what I did not stay awake for last night. I mostly just wanted to include more details and more of how I felt I suppose. If you are uninterested you may stop reading here. Yes, that means you, the reader, who is reading this.   I thought that I was so sure of myself and what I had planned to do the instant that I saw Matt. Whoops, how wrong of me.   I froze.  It felt like everything in my freaking body condensed and I could not have been more happy. I guess it was a good thing that I did not run to him, because his rents probably would have liked to injure me. Actually we did not even go near each other for a few minutes. I wanted to, but I was not sure if he wanted me to. So we all sat there. Tossed the frisbee a bit and talked - but mainly just sat there. We moved to go and play frisbee 'n such. Finally got a hug though.   Back at bench, pool. Finally got what I had wanted next to the hug there. I felt awkward because of Shawn, but I warned him...and I should not have refrained from what I really wanted. That was the largest test of self control  ever .   Eh, I will skip some. Back to the bench lol.  The  bench. I want to go and steal that bench lol. Just being on that bench has brought me so much. It was there that I sat the times at Frontiers when Matt was the only person to give me the time of day, and no, for you information, no I did not ever tell him to do the proverbial "piss off". That bench...yay. lol :-D ;-)  I have to eat, so posting is...er...postponed.  Please enjoy this commercial break/intermission.  La  Ti   Da  - Gonna be a while? Grab a snickers! - C'mon down to Bob's Discount Funiture! - JC Penny's One Day Only Sale, where everything is 10, 20  30 % off! - Wendy's: Eat great, even late! Introducing the new Wendy's late-night pick-up window, open until 1 AM or later! - Make 7-Up Yours!  Okay, okay. I'm done with that. The sad thing is - I really do not watch TV. Movies - yes, TV - no. Eh, some of those are pretty old though, from when I did, in fact, watch a bit of television.   Back to Battlecry...or rather...what I did instead of Battlecry...  Skipping...skipping...skipping...skipping...ah, okay. Near the wedge. Matt was kinda cold outside, and cars were being weird. Honestly, why would you watch a couple of kids ... er ... sitting on a bench? Anyways, we moved inside and chilled near some lockers. Besides the guy charging back and forth with the umbrella (which he sometimes opened!  ::insert exaggerated gasp here:: . That was actually pretty funny. I enjoyed it anyways.   That was where we missed the reservation at Sole P. because we were a bit um...preoccupied? Er...we were not hungry! Honestly! Then when we were hungry at like...what was it? 11:30pm? We decided to walk to that Eddie's place...where I think Tych got irritated because I was not going to eat...so I did eat. I was glad that I did, because I was pretty hungry and it helped with the energy part of things. Walked back to Claudio's ... rather quickly because it had gotten a bit more chilly and we were figuring on having to let Claudio in at midnight I believe it was. Got back there, I think his name was John was just leaving. He got some pizza. Well, waited for Claudio...he got back and then left for a party for a few again. Came back again, chilled for a few...slept.  Tych and I...really did not do much sleeping. We sort of made up for lost time until it was very bright outside... then  we went to sleep. That was awesome. I got to figure out a few things he liked n'such.   He, however, figured something out also...and I do not know if he did realize the extent to which what he figured out worked. I imagine that he did since he seemed to comment on it most of the time lol. Well, what can I say? Damn, I can feel myself turning red just writing this.  I think I could have potentially injured blood vessels in my face from blushing so much, especially since Tych figured out pinkching my cheeks and touching my nose makes me instantly "glow". Then telling me that I am red just makes it that much worse lol. It was pretty funny actually.  But yeah, I sort of said things then that I feel pretty silly for. Getting caught up in the moment, you sort of think for the moment, and then when you calm down later realize that you said things that you probably would not have said under other circumstances. That does not mean that I did not mean what I said really, I just cannot believe that I did say them, and I do not know how they were looked upon by the receiving end. Tough situation.  I am glad of how the night turned out though. Being able to sleep next to the person that means the most to you is the best feeling ever. Especially when you were not sure if you would be able to or not and then it works out in your favor :-D  Waking up was tough too, because I did not want to leave because that seems like it would speed time up and we would not be able to be together as much for as long if we did leave. We had to, sorrowfully. I caught up on the competition a bit and saw Brittany. It was nice to see her, and lucky for me she agrees with my being with Tycho and he thinks that she is a cool person. That is a step up from the days of old in itself too.   I could not help but think back to Frontiers a lot of the time there. I grew up since then. I can feel it. I thought of sitting on that bench hoping that someone would come and talk to me...like I used to do before I became as social as I am. I remember kicking myself in the ass because that was not how I wanted to act. I wanted to be known as a very social person, and that was not the way to do it. I was supposed to go find people, get along with them, and have a great time. Once robotics came around I did more of that. Other than my team in that competition, I really just did not mix well with the other students there. The PAs yeah, they were great, and I talk to them more than any of the residents next to Brandon. I seem to actually do that a lot too. I guess I am just more used to people that are older than me. Mostly what I thought of though, was again being on that bench waiting for someone to talk to me. Matt usually asked if I was okay, and if I was sure. I would just say that I was, because I basically was. I just reacted very poorly. I know if I were there now I most certainly would not have done the same things. I would be the way I would have liked to if I was. When no one did talk to me it was the dismay and depression that set in. I felt that I was unaccepted there, and that just seemed to confirm it. I was very self-conscious and almost self loathing. I was amazed that I did not cut myself when I was there. I just wanted to sit alone, and be alone until the end of the trip. I opened up to my team and Lisa by the end and became more myself. I was a bit fake about it, but I still got better. I would not eat around anyone, but I would sit in the room and listen to conversations. I sat with Kristen a few times. Sat with Kat's group a few times. Matt(not Tych) and Frank usually tried to help me.  I see that now, there were people I got along with and did not mind me being with them. Mike, Eric, Frank, Matt (again not Tych), Brandon, Lisa, sort of that group.   I cannot say I did nothing there. I set myself in here and there.  Crud helped. A lot. I even talked a bit to Tycho there, even though I was pretty sure he did not want me to. I still hate the fact that I did not hang out with him and his residents when I skipped out on the mall.  That bench though. That was where I got the most attention from Tycho, who I actually had a crush on during the program lol. A few people found out about that and were highly amused. They did not think I liked anyone there, nevermind having had a crush lol. They tried( maybe succeeded) numerous times to tell him about it too. I cannot say that I minded all that much because it was true. I ended up telling him online afterwards.  On the bench this year at Battlecry though, I was on that bench. Instead of thinking about how I had a crush on Tycho, he was there with me.   I was, and still am amazed.   Frontiers worked out for me. Every bit. Took a while, but it did. I have regrets, but yet, I do not. Everything happens for a reason.   I have rambled for quite some time now. I wonder how boring it was. That was basically everything that ran through my mind, unabridged. I am just amazed. I am with the person that I really wanted to be with since last July. Wow. I do not know what else to say, just wow. It is the most awesome thing and the most awesome feeling ever.  I will stop now lol, sorry y'all. We are free, so let me know if you want to do something even though I will probably contact y'all. My room is getting done so there is plenty of room to chill and sleep. Take care and have a good one!  -J9

      Okay, I hope that y'all have gone to the bathroom, gotten something to eat, have something to drink, have said goodbye to family/friends, and are prepared not to make any plans - and say hello to Clause!  Sorry, Denis Leary segment there.  However, y'all should be prepared, because my memory is hopefully flowing into overtime and I am going to convey a portrait of my weekend for y'all. My away message is up and I am ready to type!   Friday, woke up around 9:30am so that was not too bad. A nice change of pace. Then I was left with the duty of entertaining myself for about four and a half hours. I got dressed and ready, chilled with my brother, and cleaned a bit. I had gone through my checklist to ensure I would not forget anything of massive importance for the weekend. I knew I needed a change of clothing including my team shirt, dream catcher, and money ($160 from my mom the night before) - none of which I forgot. I was all set and ready. Just needed to wait for my ride to be out of work at noon and set out at about 1:30/2pm. Well, he had gotten out of work early and decided to meet me at about 12:30pm instead. No complaints. We set out and were well on out way by 1pm. He ended up taking a route that I was unfamiliar with, but whatever. My concern was simply that we had gotten there, which we did. I ended up showing him around the campus and telling him things I learned at WPI. Saw a PA from Frontiers and thought I would find Tych through him. Instead he chilled with us as I sat at my regular bench.   Tych was spotted coming in and I guess that it is a good thing that I decided against running to him.  I just stayed on my bench basically in shock out of happiness. We sat around and talked for a little while, a bit of frisbee, which led into more frisbee on the quad which was enjoyable. Matt met another soon-to-be PA for Frontiers.   More sitting on the bench trying to decide what to do. I finally decided that I felt like playing pool, so Tych taught us Cutthroat (spelling?) which was a pretty nifty game. I really had no focus and could not remember a damned thing that was going on lol. That was pretty bad. I did horribly, but whatever. I knew I would. I one once. The soap opera that was on was pretty disturbing too. I can definitely do such a better job than that.  Well, after was more confusion of what to do. I think this is where we walked to Claudio's so we would know where it was then Tych was inclined to show we the "Most Magicalist Place in the Land" aka Price Chopper because I had never been there. Then we decided to walk up a huge hill. That was not too bad, my legs are feeling it which is good. The view on top was awesome. Then we went back to campus center for air conditioning. In the campus center we went on computers to check on the Sole Proprietor (again, spelling?) and I ended up showing Tych an e-mail I saved which got a bit of redness. Tehe. Then I think that was where we decided to drop Matt's stuff off and I manage to cut myself on the porch. Go me! Anyways, this led into walking back to competition and watch a bit before deciding to split up for the evening. I stayed with Tych and then came more bench sitting. Some cool stuff happened there but a perverted station wagon-y type vehicle was not helping...so we went over to the dorms and chilled by some lockers. That was nice. Minus the guy charging up and down the wall way with an umbrella, which was pretty funny. Missed reservations at Sole P. so decided to grab something quick at Ernie's, which has really good pizza, before going back to Claudio's. We had to beat him back because we had his keys. Got there and met John (right?) and then Claudio got back a short time later. Had a good discussion about academics. Shed a bit of a new light for me. If you go to college for something that you are already good at, then great. But if you go for something that you need to work at a little more, and you do work on it, then you learn that also become more well-rounded. Good thought, eh? We ended up watching this ridiculous "Kids in the Hall" or something like that DVD. It was er...interesting. What was so great was being able to be next to Matt and getting to fall asleep next to him :-D  Then I was spoiled.   The competition started at about 9am I guess, but as seeing that we did not actually got to sleep before about 5:30am, we over-slept that. Until about 11/11:30am. We made it to competition with plenty of time. We watched a few rounds and otherwise rotated between outside and campus center. We just sat, talked, and were close. Dancing at the competition was great too, I really enjoyed that. I also saw and got to talk to a lot of old friends such as Saul, can't remember his name, JJ, Rob, and Ashley.   Our team did the usual, make it to finals - crap out. All good.   Walking away from Tycho again at the end of the day was once more the hardest things I ever had to do. It hurt so much. I wanted to look back, but knew if I did that I would be inclined to run back. I miss you.  The trip the way back, I was so random. I kept singing "Buttercup", "Soul Man", and then I oddly enough really wanted either a hot stuffed pretzel or baked potato. I ended up getting the potato lol.  Bowling with Jennie, Mark, and Kristen. Fun stuff.  Tomorrow, graduation party for Marie and another for James. Busy stuff.  There is a lot of detail that I did not yet (if I do) go into. Thank you for your time and attention. Matt, I have the dreamcatcher. I will try to get it to you ASAP.  So much not listed. Too tired. Arg.  Well, I am going to get some sleep. G'night all, take care.  Tycho, me amo ti mucho. Miss you soo much, thank you for the weekend. ::hugs:: :-*  -J9

      Now it is official for me. I have just officially completed my junior year 25 minutes ago. Those last two finals were awesome! So easy!   Well, maybe a coffeehouse celebration tonight...except the group it was with (lucky college students who have been out for a while mocking me) called and said there was a change of plans. Since this is "my night", I am scared shitless. I have no idea what they are doing. I am sure it will be wicked fun though. Er...should I dare to say that?   Battlecry, as Brian would say:  Crackie3312003:  wpi t-minus one day and counting  Or...Boston...or...well...I do not know. I am not treading on that ground quite yet.   I am so glad that I have used writing so much as an opportunity to eliminate conjunctions from my written vocabulary. It saved so much time and grief on my history final. That is her big things, and now I am fairly accustomed to automatically avoiding them. There are a few cases where you are screwed because the sentence is so awkward without those little partial words with commas. If you try to say it properly you seem wicked British...or royal...or old...or something!   What else.  Did I mention that I am free? lol, sorry. Good feeling. Academic stress = non-existent. This week anyways. I am going to relax before starting the English work.   Did I mention, I finally get to see my tehanu soon? Well, you know the deal :-D  I am such an asshole for again falling asleep. It is called caffine Janine!!!! Dang.   I know there were things that I wished to actually post...but they have gone over my head again.  Working on the yearbook last year again another person that I met commented on how I look like someone that they know. How could anyone else look like me? I have never seen them...but I do feel badly for them if that is the case.   They also commented on how frequently I show up. 19 times. I love pictures, what can I say? I do not care how dumb I look in them, that is the fun part that makes you look back and laugh. There are a few I actually really like too.   I tried to nail Tony for showing up a lot, but I have him beat by three. Woo hoo. That is what he gets for making me run across a hot parking lot barefoot to get the frisbee...that I did a horrible job throwing...lol Actually he got most of them, which was appreciated. Frisbee is fun!   Um, I should stop huh? Since who knows what is happening tonight and I will probably update again. SAT scores Friday...I guess I will have to wait unless I can talk someone into checking and give them...my password...sniff. I should change that to something pointless then change it back after...hmmm  Okay, like I said, I am done.   Tengo muchos muchos ganas de menos de ti, Matt, me amo ti mucho, como nada en este mundo!

      When I first went to update, I seriously thought that I was getting alzehimers or something because I knew I wanted to post something, but I was not sure what. Considering this is my second update today already I will save the update about tonight's meeting for tomorrow. Hopefully I will not be able to update all weekend because I will be away. Either in Worcester or in Boston. Sunday, however, is Marie's graduation party. Which, as seeing that I am missing the graduation itself on Friday, I would not miss her party. I think that did not really matter because we have Friday and Saturday, not Sunday.  So, back to what I wanted to update about. 4.5 hours of school left! 7:45-9:45 Chemistry and 10:00-12:00 History. I am not worried about either. Chemistry a little bit, but I suspect it should be fine.  Okay, yesterday I was sitting at Dunkin Donuts drinking my orange coolatta right? Well, an elderly lady, an' I mean the elderly lady you catch in Vegas with her catty friends, comes in. Leopard pants an' all, baby! Then, following her is her normal, seemingly down-to-Earth husband. Figure that. Well, she brings their stuff to the table right next to me. Of all the open seats, she goes to that one. Their stuff included a newspaper and crosswords.   For the record everyone, I hate having my back to motion, and will tend to sit with my back to a wall and face out a window because I enjoy watching the people and cars go by. BDunkin Donuts is great for this because it faces the pike and I set the sun through the massive windows, which there are three in front of where I sit.  This lady proceeds to go to the windows and begins closing the blinds! I figure, oh well, she is only doing one. Then she moved on to the next one. Okay, a bit irritated. Then I looked to the third window and thought, oh...hell no. She did it, all three. As she seated herself with me giving her a bizzare look, she smiles and says hi. Then she sits and begins to complain about the toughness of the donuts.   A message she will not receive but was running through my head: Look, you are not at home. You could sit somewhere else or put your back to the window, however, right now you are infringing upon my rights. It is 3 in the afternoon...and you expect the donuts would be fresh?   So on and so forth. It was funny when I was rambling it all out in the car.   For some reason that was frustrating.  Any thoughts on this?   TuRbOfReAk05:  if death is the greatest adventure ion life, then whats the sence of living?  TuRbOfReAk05:  i mean what is there to live for>  Jaenen6:  I do not believe hat death is the greatest adventure in life, so I cannot answer that  TuRbOfReAk05:  well lets say it is  Jaenen6:  Then your other adventures in you life may not be the greatest, per say, but they are still worth having. Along with for the people in your life  TuRbOfReAk05:  are they really?  Jaenen6:  I believe so  TuRbOfReAk05:  Do you really know who you are?  Jaenen6:  Yes  A bit odd. Whatever. I have to run. Meeting tonight.  Me amo ti mucho, siempre, Matt! Tengo ganas de menos de ti! ::hugs::

      "Quick thoughts" are never very quick with me, are they? I always ending writing so much. I guess it is not really a bad thing that it does not take very much for me to write a lot. That works for me, probably bores you, the reader, who is reading this. lol, sorry if it does. If it just gives you something to read and you really do not mind it, then I am glad :-)  Overview for the day: -Leaving for school around 9:30 to arrive at 9:35. Then I intend to wander until 9:45 and then find friends who just got out of their third period finals. At 9:55-ish, I will go to my Spanish class then begin the final at 10:00 and end at 12:00.   -Home, to do ... nothing? Probably clean...if I can make myself do it :- -Organize some more FOCC stuff so that I have something to talk about at tonight's meeting  -Help a friend with a problem  -Meeting tonight from 6:00 - ? usually 8:30. Jay should be back which means that I will have Project C.R.E.A.T.E. also.   -Hopefully talk to my one and only. It is such an awesome feeling when all you have to do it think about someone and you cannot help but smile and feel completely uplifted. I smile a lot now :-)    Hm, I could have slept in today, and hre I am....wide awake at 6:30. For whatever reason I was waaaaay too tired last night. I could not stay awake. I think it is just the rapidly changing weather accompanied by finishing out school. So close.  Well, I hope everyone has a great day and to talk soon!  Matt, gracias por todo que hagas. Me amo ti mucho!

      School that is. It is bittersweet. I had a really good time this year and really enjoyed my teacher.  This has been a hell of a year for me. The social pressures and experiences that I had. The chances I made. The maturing that I did. The friends I had the honor of having in my life. The friends that I have the honor of having in my life. Not to mention finally being truly happy with someone.   I want to go over the major experiences after this academic year. I wish that I did it in years prior. Wait, why the hell not. I have a good enough memory.     6th Grade     -Time to begin discovering who I was. -Brittany was my closest friend  -Starting to become friends with Christine again -Started the year with High Honors and finished with honors the rest of the time -Began struggles with mathematics - Ms. Ball -Loved science, great course with Mr. Connelly -History was not a favorite - Mr. Raggio was still a great guy -English - easy Ms. Ball -I was happy and quiet -Found a knack for languages, such as Spanish with Sr. Alvarez y Sr. Banderas     7th Grade    -Friends with Brittany, Christine, and Kristen -Mr. Rockett twice a day, we was such a fun teacher in science and English -Got to skip English and go to the library because I already knew it -Honors all year -Mrs. Truncellito for history, began liking history -Mrs. Drozd for Pre-algebra...real start of trouble for a lot of people.

Anoz...continued with my Spanish -Elected for superintendents Award with friend Billy -Received it despite difficulties -Lost honors after 1 quarter -Truncelltio again -Still Southwest, but now I was in trouble -Mom left and divorce December 20th...5 days after my birthday and 5 days before Christmas -Ran away from home -Went to therapy - lied - did not get caught  -Sort of rebelled against my rents -Began friendship with Rils -Gettysburg trip - awesome! Melissa, Brittany, and Christine -Whale watch twice! With Brittany and Christine -Best New Year's Eve ever at Christine's! Laughing all night downstairs, on the computer, and at the damned MTV special!  -Very stressed and began doing not-so-great things to self -Finally pushed in front of a national news camera - loved it!!!!! -Won Judges Award with Brendan in Lego -Tech award with Brendan in school     Freshman Year    -Lost track of academics and focused on friends. Jennie, Murky, Rils (Murky, Rils, and I grew especially close this year), Steph, and Jess -Spanish with Steph brought her and I together -Lunch with Jess, Steph, and Compulsive Kim! lol -Disliked Spanish because Srta.

I missed them so much. I am also talking to all sorts of new people. One has come up being very negative, but I am not going to hold that against him. I understand. I think...  People no longer see me as "quiet". They see me for who am I, and we have fun together. I love laughing all the time, and I usually do. Nothing has been able to dampen my spirits. Things work out, everything happens for a reason.   Life is finally the way I want it, I am living up to who I want to be, I am doing the things I want to, I am succeeding.   Most importantly, I have all of my friends. I love being able to care for them, and in return they care for me. It does not matter where we all go, we have fun just the same, because it is about the company.   I hope to become closer to some again, Jennie...since I do not disrespect you, I would love to hang out more.   Rils, you are my best friend, and we really do need to hang out  All of us, I want us to go and do what we have always dreamed of.  What is my short-term dream?  Go somewhere special, like the Enders, bring everyone's favorite outdoor lunch, radio, and just be there. Reminisce, make new memories.  I would love for it to be Tycho & if he wanted to bring someone, Ari, Billy, Brian H, Britt, Christine, Frank, Izzy, Jennie & Tim, Jess & Shawn, Kristen, Heather, Marie, Mon Mon, Murky, Rils & Nick if she wished, Roni & Andy, Robbie and his crew, Shawn, Steph, and others. That is the core group lol. Maybe more people from other robotics teams.  That would be a massive party lol.   Actually, I think that is basically all of my friends. I should invite the entire Aces High team, I consider them all my friends...tehehe.   Wow, I have been in such an untouchably good mood. Some things hit here and there...but I get over it. It is so great!  Ea tebea liubliu Tych!!! :-D

      Well, barely slept last night. I basically re-did my   entire   room. When I woke up it was off to school, where I did my best possible on the precalculus. It was not as easy as the first half as I had expected, but it could have been worse.   Left school, got brunch with my mom, and as we pulled in so did Robbie. After getting gas, caffeine, directions, and a new windshield wiper, we were off. I was ecstatic! We were on the Mass Pike, and I was counting down the miles until Boston. Then, Robbie got a very concerned look upon his face. He could not move the shifter. The clutch probably blew. We were stuck in the middle of the pike, I think a ways out of Palmer.   Got towed back to Enfield, CT. Got taken out to lunch by Robbie's rents. Then, they gave me another surprise, which I have reiterated like four times now lol. It lifted my mood immensely, but it is still low. I have that headache that I used to have when I worried excessively.   Am IM that I also just received helped immensely. Listening to DKM too.   I was so close.   Now some of my friends have had a bad day also and wish to take a walk to unwind...and I am not even in the mood for that. I just feel ill.   Very physically ill. My dad is starting to think that I have blood sugar problems and need to see a doctor. Crap.   Well, I am going to go, and remember, Tycho, don't give up on me ...

       I just messed up on an entry in Livejournal, which showed me a whole new way to do posts. Either I am slow, or this is new. When you are done posting, and you are in the text box hit "Tab" "Enter" and it brings you to a different screen where you can put other nifty things in. I do not know, maybe it is something old that I just discovered, again because I am slow...   Whatever.   Today I woke up early, called my mom to discuss a very important issue, then headed out to McLean's park. I walked up to the summit and then waded around in the brook. It was sort of cold, but it felt wicked good on my feet. Then, sprawled out in the parking lot on a towel doing the shorts/bikini top things in order to tan a bit. The heat of the sun was so relaxing.  Then, basketball. I have not lost my touch :-D I was proud of that. Again, napped in the sun a bit. That is why I sleep with my space heater. Something about direct heat on my back or something, it is just relaxing. I know something else that would relax me and finally allow me a truely good nights sleep, but that may take a while. I am willing to wait.   Last of the precalculus final tomorrow, this is good. I am looking forward to it! I am getting out of school early tomorrow :-D. Hopefully I will be on my way to Boston with Robbie and whomever else. After I get there they can do whatever. I just want to see my certain someone :-D. This means that I am going to spent the night cleaning, but that is okay  Not sure what else to post. Had a pretty good phone conversation with Tycho. I was so happy to hear his wonderful voice again, I missed it immensely!  Have a good one,  -J9

      Well, I was going to do this huge post on all of the awesome things that happened today, but I have discovered that they do not mean shit if you are prevented from being with the person that you really want to be with.  -Slept until noon  -Hiked with dad, stepmom, brother, his girlfriend, and Cali -Lots of ticks and bug spray -Chased frogs -Got home and then set out to chill with Robbie and Paul -Swung on huge rope into pond, swam a bit -Chilled at Paul's girlfriend Lauren's house.  -Made friends with a kid that I thought I would not like due to Jon -Discovered that Jon talks a lot of crap about me behind my back and that I royally fucked up his transmission -Got offered to play paintball with them all and kick his ass -Thought about partying at Pauls, but then we all went bowling -Got home, and now all this  The part of my life that matters most...is probably having the most difficult time with his parents ever...because of me.  As I said to him, I do not believe that I have ever hurt so bad in my entire life. I got home around 1...got told a few minutes later...it is now 1:32 and I have been crying since. Why does it have to happen this way. I do not want to loose him...ever.  I wish I could just run there, not caring what anyone thought or said. There is only one person who matters.  Here Without You - 3 Doors Down   A hundred days have made me older, since the last time that I saw your pretty face A thousand lies have made me colder and I don't think I can look at this the same But all the miles that separate They disappear now when I'm dreaming of your face  I'm here without you baby, but you're still on my lonely mind I think about you baby, and I dream about you all the time I'm here without you baby, but you're still with me in my dreams And tonight, there's only you and me  The miles just keep rolling, as the people leave their way to say hello I've heard this life is overrated, but I hope that it gets better as we go  I'm here without you baby, but you're still on my lonely mind I think about you baby and I dream about you all the time I'm here without you baby, but you're still with me in my dreams And tonight (boy), there's only you and me    Everything I know and anywhere I go It gets hard but it won't take away my love And when the last one falls, when it's all said and done It gets hard but it won't take away my love    I'm here without you baby, but you're still on my lonely mind I think about you baby and I dream about you all the time I'm here without you baby, but you're still with me in my dreams And tonight (boy), there's only you and me

      I had a good post...good length...then...the update page "Could not be found"...so now my post is long gone...  Blast.  Okay, short short version  Road in front of house = paved next week Maybe driveways too Precalculus final = multiple choice = easier than anticipated No hike - PepBoys, thought a lot about my car. Although not standard, going to rice it out, and automatic is probably a better idea for now.  Hope Tycho realizes that no one has anything on him Miss him  ::sniff::   Soon! :-D  Pink series of Hondas (4) on the pike. Evan's Saturn "on steroids" kicked the crap out of Mike's Civic...TWICE. I would never want to give that credit to Saturns, but I have no special fondness to Civics (minus Del Sol), but that was awesome!  Rims, neons, stereos, spoilers, vinyls, NOS, exhausts, mufflers, everything.   Tycho and I had serious talks, which I am grateful for because then I know what is going on. I appreciate you giving me the honor of lisening when you had something to say.    Please have a good one, take care.  -J9

      Friday, finally. I actually woke up earlier than I was supposed to this morning and headed off to school. Marie was not around for rides which meant that I had to fend for myself, which is also known as trying to remember where the bus went, and when it did so.  I headed out at 7:03 AM and stood there for several minutes talking to the construction workers. I guess they were supposed to pave the gravel sections of road in front of my house this week but they are doing it next week. They may also do driveways,  ::evil grin::   Precalculus final = multiple choice = I did much better than I was anticipating.  Anyways, did not hike. Instead we wandered around PepBoys. There is a lot that I wish to put into my car, however, I would like a more race-worthy car. Or a standard transmission anyways. The automatic is just a better idea for now. The Laser will look good, but not race well ...can we say RICER? lol  Then, it was off to the pike. The first part was simply talking to my favorite person ever. Some serious conversation came up, but that is a good thing because we should be able to talk and I am extremely appreciative that he gave me the opportunity to listen.  Then, the awesome cars started coming out. Rims, neons, exhausts, mufflers, spoilers, kits, everything. A few races. I finally must give props to SATURNS ON STEROIDS lol. Evan kicked the crap out of Mike's Civic, not once, but twice. Not surprised. I am not seriously over-joyed by Civics, although I am fond of the Del Sols. New amp...sounds like ass. Sorry Tych.  Series of PINK cars. Hondas all. Funny! One guy had a blow-up doll for a passenger!   headed back, and scoped a couple side streets for short races tomorrow. I will probably video tape them. We want to bring the pike out to Ella Grasso lol.  Now I am letting the adrenaline cool a bit, I was allowed to drive. WEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE lol.  Bad part of evening: I knew only a handful of people and presence of drugs. ICK  Anyways, I am going to run, please take care. Have a good one!  -J9

      As difficult as it was, I left y'all a day to recover from my previous posts lol.  Today was my last real day of school. Tomorrow and Monday I start finals, which detracts from them being normal days.  Schedule from Friday on: Friday - Final 7:30-8:30, normal day WEEKEND (Saturday is a fund raiser with Lego Maniacs, maybe...)  Monday - Normal class, Final 8:34-9:34, normal day Tuesday - Final from 7:45-9:45, home Wednesday - Final from 10:00 - 12:00. home Thursday - Final from 7:45-9:45, final from 10:00-12:00 Friday - Leaving for Worcester probably about 10:00AM :-D  Last night Dave e-mailed me and contacted Tony about heading up the meeting which I finally got to do fully :-D  I walked to John's house, got the keys, then walked the rest of the way to the meeting where Tony, Frank, and I chilled outside and played a bit of frisbee while joking with some kids on the other side of the parking lot lol. I think the girls were hitting on Tony lol, because his kick ass car. Too bad he's 24 (4 right?) and they were in middle school lol.  The meeting was quick and I got a ride home. While dropping off the keys Stanhope ran up and told me I probably got more done than Dave :-X lol  Today:  English: Watched Macbeth  Contemporary: Did Spanish project  Study: Wrote a letter to people that I will probably never send :- Spanish: Slept a bit  Chemistry: Took over a lab, fun stuff  Precalculus: Slept, discovered that I will be taking that final not next Wednesday as planned, which would leave me more study time, but TOMORROW...from 7:30AM to 8:30AM! Then again on Monday, 8:34AM-9:34AM!!! Ack!  Then I got my summer assignments for my English 111 course. I need to check some text books out for the summer. A full year...like...365 days with those books ahead :-\   I am a sick human being, I am looking forward to it! Reading some classics, like Jane Austen and Charlotte Bronte (as I have already done), short stories, essays, poems, and then writing my own essays. I feel like this course is going to be very good for me :-D College work! College freshmen course :-D  Damnit, which means all of those UCONN things I avoided on that CT thing count towards me. This course if a collaboration with UCONN and counts for credit there. Oops.  Stayed after with Pease. At least Chemistry is all cleared up.  Tonight I get to drive for two whole hours. I am helping teach a course tonight in Tunxis. How do you spell that anyways? Well, that. One hour up, one hour back. Fun stuff. Practice for driving for long periods of time this summer lol  Speaking of, that letter I wrote n'such were all in regards to one situation that has put ice in my gut all day. I realize that Tycho was getting in trouble to the phone last night and I hope that I did not tick his rents off for keeping him on the phone for so long. I have been wicked worried, I do not want him or his rents POed at me. :-( I hope to contact him at some point today.  That was a huge part of what was on my mind today, that and missing him.  Well, I have to go in a few. Talk to y'all later!  -J9

      I scored a  56%  on the "How Massachusetts are YOU?" Quizie!  urlLink What about you?    THIS IS SO TRUE. I wrote if I followed it or not after each in bold lol.   1. Going to IHOP at midnight is an acceptable dinner.   Usually Denny's, but yes it would be   2. Your neighbor, their best friend, and their mother in law all drive Jetta’s.   One of my best friends does and my brother lol   3. 90 percent of the population between 15 and 19 own a car.  Yeah, that is about right   4. And 80 percent are SUV’s.  Ouch, not really. Honda Civics...    5. You must order DMB tickets 6 months ahead of time even though they’re doing three shows.  Most definitely!   6. The “meadows” doesn’t mean a field-type place.  Meadows means the UTC Regional!!!!!! And DMB concerts...   7. unless you live in Coventry  I don't live there   8. You don’t even hear of Coventry until you’ve lived in CT for a good twenty years plus.  I am not 20, but I have been to Coventry   9. You thought the only highways are 91 and 84.  There are other highways? Just kidding, I am on 2 and 6 a lot also :-P     10. Your high school rival football game is the event of the month.  Eh, more like basketball   11. You own a bikini and snowpants.  Yes, actually...   12. A trip to Cape Cod is “just another weekend.”  Hell, I almost moved there 4 years ago!   13. You actually think Hartford’s big.  I live in Windsor Locks, what isn't big compared to that?!   14. It amazes you each and every time you see how small CT looks on a map.  Pretty much, but then I look at Rhode Island and say, "HA HA" in a Nelson-like manner.     15. And then you look at Rhode Island and laugh.  Oops, I should have read ahead...I suppose that further proves that this one is certainly true...that is creepy...I need to move lol   16. The entire goal of summer is to get a tan that will last through November, at least.  Agreed   17. The most exciting thing to do is go to the movies, and you even have to go out of town for that.  Sadly enough, it is out-of-town...    18. UCONN basketball rules and nobody can tell you elsewise.   Damn straight   19. You think bars are only for those 21 and over.  Liquor stores are for 21 and under...but you have to go to MA for that   20. And parties are for those 20 and under.  Hence the liquors stores...this is pretty dumb coming from someone who is anti-alcohol...   21. You know what weed is by the third grade.  Definitely 4th...so probably. Proud to say, I do not know it first hand :-)   22. Scratch that, first.  Let this "screw you" go out to whomever made this...but kinda true   23. You notice each incoming freshman class is getting shorter and shorter.  Hell yeah they are, no joke!!!    24. You, your best friend, or your mom has attended UCONN.  One friend at UCONN   25. Your “backup” schools are central, UHA, URI, Northwest, and Eastern.  I have lost so many friends to those bandwagon schools, I am schooling in MA!    26. You wonder why everyone calls CT the “rich state.”  Kinda...I am not rich!   27. You complain about the minimum wage being only $6.90 when most states barely break $5 (honest, CT is highest minimum wage in country besides DC).  Actually we are over $7.00 now I think...   28. Timbs are meant for both men and women.  Yeah, they are boots...honestly   29. “word” is an acceptable response.   lol, not from me   30. Your home ec./foods teacher is male.   Nope, ha! What now?!   31. Foods is a class offered at your high school.  Yeah...thankfully I have never taken it!   32. A 3.5 is something to pout about for a week.  Hey, it could have been a 3.6! Wait, does that mean that we are smart here?   33. You cannot pronounce your C’s and T’s.   It is the "R"s that I fear...lol :-P    34. Therefore Connecticut id pronounced ki-nedda-cuh.  Huh?   35. The word ghetto has at least 20 different meanings, non even near the real one.  In the gheeeeeeeeeet-tooooooooo!   36. You can complete the sentence: “Blazin’ 18 ___”  "Blazin' 18 Hits In A Row On The Hott 93.7!"   37. Cow Tipping sounds like the greatest field trip ever.  If the cows would not get hurt, that would be pretty funny!   38. You have the need to go on a “roadtrip” but just drive around your town for hours b/c you’re afraid of getting lost.  We drive around town because we have school the next day thank you very much!   39. You promise the second you’re 18 it’s out of CT forever, but you end up going to UCONN and living here for the rest of your life.  No UCONN, I am moving when I go to college...NOT AT UCONN!!!   40. Except for that year you decide to “try out” NYC  Meh...   41. And get scared and come back.  Fun-ny ha-ha   42. Theatre isn’t just for those in black turtlenecks with coffee mugs.  Well, it isn't! I've seen dark blue! :-P    43. You’ll “settle” for Starbucks.  Starbucks is good...   44. You think you’re the coolest b/c you’re walking around with a coffee mug (filled with hot chocolate).  Hell yeah, hot chocolate WHAT WHAT!  lmfao  45. There is about 30 variations of “Park” in the state (road, street, ave, etc.) Oh yeah, in this town alone!!   46. You hear people moved halfway across the country just to go to your school.  We have a few from different countries! :-D   47. Everyone else goes to UCONN for the good education. You go because it’s only $4,000 a year instate.  I would, but I do not like party schools, and I wish to be closer to someone. My ideal school is in MA   48. Scratch that, its EDUMACATION not education.  Ha! True!   49. Your AP Calculus class is filled with sophomores.   If we had AP calculus...we are mathematically inept   50. Flannel PJ pants are the official attire of midterm/finals week.  Isn't it everywhere?   51. Midterms don’t exist. They are “midyear assessments”.  I have heard both lol   52. There are at least 5 coffee shops within a quarter mile of each other.  In Hartford yeah, Bill and I used to raid them lol   53. Buckland Hills and Westfarms become your favorite two (well, three) words.   Buckland is okay, Westfarms sucks. Holyoke, now you are talking. What about Enfield Square?   54. You’ve been thrown out of and sworn a life of misery if you ever return from at least three stores by age 14.  If only one was Brookstones lol   55. You own at least 10 hoodies. There are a couple from robotics    56. And wear tanktops under them. (if anything at all).   What is wrong with that?   57. a night of hanging out at the center doing... nothing sounds like the best fun youve had in weeks  On occasion   58. IM isn’t an extra, it’s a necessity.  Oh yeah, definitely   59. You (or your girl) has had at least one miscarriage by the time you’re 17.  Have not personally, but have known plenty   60. You use the term “mad ghetto.”  Maybe?   61. Half the kids at your school are mad ghetto. Sorrowfully...just add " " on either side. Damned posers lol     62. Mad is no longer an emotion.  To some   63. It’s called a grinder or sub.   What else do you call it?   64. “Bradley” is a place you look forward to going.    65. You’ve not only read every Harry Potter book to date, but even reread each numerous times.   Sooooooo...   66. As well as the movies.   Not all of them, oops   67. You address your friends as “hoe” whether they’re male or female.   Eh, jokingly maybe...    68. You park in an illegal spot just so you don’t have to walk.  Um, I usually walk. My bad...how un-Connecticutly of me...    69. You are overly amused with this number.  hehe   70. 104 Fest and Big Day Off are the two best events of the year.  Do not forget Ozzfest!   71. You are wearing at least $200 worth of clothing at all times, whether it be an Abercrombie shirt and jeans, or baggy jeans, fubu tshirt, and Timbs.  Um...   72. The kids from the “ghetto” wear $80 jeans, $ 30, shirts, Timbs, and seem to have a sweat headband to match every outfit.  Yeah, that is so annoying   73. You have the need to match ALL the time, even when you’re going to bed.  That is just my OCD   74. You’ve discovered that pre-wrap makes an awesome headband.  It does?   75. Bandanas are a fashion statement.  FIRST, hello!   76. You own at least one pair of guy’s pants, no matter what sex you are.  Yup   77. Punk underground is underground no more.  Heh, true    78. You know almost as many people that can freestyle as there are in Chicago (or at least they think they can).  'fraid not   79. You have life “so hard” because you have to wait a whole week to get that velour hoodie & pants you wanted. We aren't THAT bad!    80. Beer Pong and a Bong are musts at any party.  It is funny watching people do that...at every party lol   81. Weed is the drug of choice.  Seemingly, bah   82. Knowing gay or lesbian people is a commonplace.  DON'T GET ME STARTED. It is, and it is NOT a bad thing! Ode to Comtemporary American Issues!   83. Water bottles are to be filled with vodka. Everyday.  which is why we could not have bottled water at school...    84. You see a Hartford cop walking down the street with a beer in his hand on St. Patricks day.  Would not surprise me...   85. And you then feel the need to yell “Do I smell bacon” at him.  Yup, someone usually does   86. Before stealing his beer.  Uhhhhhhh   87. You’ve discovered the cup holders at the crown can be moved up to provide, uh, “more space”.  The crown?   88. And you understood that the crown was a movie theatre from the moment I said it (unless you though supermarket—then you’re from West Hartford).  Dude hey, seriously    89. Jay and Silent Bob were the smartest idea since, well, ever.  Since Monty Python...   90. You know what happened on the last episode of real world, road rules, and the challenges.  Hell no   91. You actually have enough spare time & boredom to have read this far.  It is like 3 in the morning!   92. You use movie lines from mall rats and halfbaked in everyday conversation.  Mallrats actually lol   93. You start conversations with random people on the street on a regular basis.  Oops?   94. And half those people pretend you’re not even there.  Heh, how did you know that? :-P   95. You are scared to ride the bus alone unless you live in Hartford.  I do not ride any bus but the school one   96. You own a cell phone and have at least one “accessory” for it.  Yeah, that is commonplace   97. GO GIANTS AND PATRIOTS!  Do not care, to be honest   98. You’ve seen hockey, basketball, figure skating, and a boat show all at the civic center.  Actually yes, I worked at the boat show!!   99. Canadians are the silliest invention ever.  GRRRRRRRRRR, I am Canadian!!!!   100. You have said “THAT’s SO TRUE!” to every other thing on this list. But as much as we dis it, we Connectican’s can stand (uh, short) and proud and say I love CT. Whoops, typo. I mean I LOVE NY!!!!!   My bad

      Well, I was hoping that only positive entries would make it in here, but once more there is a few things that I need to get out that I really cannot post on LiveJournal. I could only imagine the reprocussions of that.   English - watched a bit more of Macbeth and could barely stay awake  Contemporary - listened to a lady drone on about her college that had no appeal to me  Study - went to the library and did a good chunk of work for my English final  Precalculus - actually took a quiz and answered all questions. If I had answered them correctly or not is a whole different story. I need to stay after with him and go over material for the final.  Chemistry - took notes and got confused all period. I eventually have to look at that material tonight. I am staying after for review for that final tomorrow.  History - watched a movie and Sjodin gave me her personal phone number to call her and remind her about bringing in another movie which I did around 7:15 pm.  My dad forgot about picking me up from school this afternoon but once he did we headed over to the middle school so I could give Michelle the applications and tell her what was going on. I also put in an announcement for the middle schoolers. I told her about my dorm experience and she was basically shocked. It was pretty funny. She and I need to chill sometime because we need to catch up and I want to show her my pictures n'such.  Got home, got changed, ran for 20 minutes.   A short time after I got out of the shower and talked to my stepmom about joining her and my aunt at the gym/getting a nutritionalist, the power died. For about 3.5 hours. I just used my cell phone to call everyone. I found a spot where I get wicked good reception. 40 minutes without a problem :-)  Talked to my stepmom about not volunteering this weekend. I am all set now. Time to rest a bit this weekend for the big upcoming one.   I also talked to her about my getting my own apartment in a few years. We discussed me maybe doing a dorm for 2 years, then a 5-year lease on an apartment in MA. My rents are actually thinking about moving out to Holyoke. After high school anyways, where I will have moved out on my own. But yeah, she agrees with me doing my own place, roommate recommended, but I do not forsee that as being a problem.    Well, there is a lot of work for finals to do and things are on a roll for FOCC. I am going to talk to people tomorrow night and get in contact with Rage about finally getting a large meeting in :-)  Oh, 2005 FIRST Update, compliments of RJ from Rage:   MyMountainDew173:  2005 championship criteria is posted  Jaenen6:  Oh  MyMountainDew173:  and only 3 utc teams are eligible  Auto response from Jaenen6:	I will be right back.   Jaenen6:  Oh  MyMountainDew173:  yes  Jaenen6:  Are you guys?  MyMountainDew173:  no  MyMountainDew173:  most of utc teams are not in the right tiers  MyMountainDew173:  that are eligible  MyMountainDew173:  so only two are but another one is going cuz of their nat'l chairman's win  Jaenen6:  Buzz is   MyMountainDew173:  yes  MyMountainDew173:  but other than 3 teams- the rest of us are in a dog fight if we all want to go  Jaenen6:  That sucks  MyMountainDew173:  no kidding, do you realize how tough our regional is going ot be  MyMountainDew173:  its going to be a fucking war zone  Jaenen6:  lol, Aces High will not end up fighting for it. We just pick a regional that is far away to go to in its place  Jaenen6:  If we can go, we can go, if not, then oh well  MyMountainDew173:  we are thinking of going west caoast   MyMountainDew173:  n then hellhole war zone utc  Jaenen6:  We were going to do California if we did not make it this year  That is enough of that. The criteria is posted, and Aces High is probably screwed. My senior year, thanks kids. lol. Oh well, no problem. I have other things (cough people, namely one person...who reads this) to look forward to seeing :-D  Okay, I think that I am all set for now. Have a good night all.   -J9

      Well, this morning I woke up becaus of a very annoying and loud noise which I could have sworn was emulating from my boombox. This caused me to try to turn my boombox off by changing the station, volume, and unplugging it. Then I rememeber thinking to myself, "Oh, it is my phone." Yes, my alarm clock was going off on my phone. I turned it off without even considering the need to wake up and went back to sleep.  I woke up at 8:10AM, thought about staying home, remembered the freshmen orientation, and began walking. My brother Billy ended up seeing me and gave me a ride. Thankfully.    Random side note: My foot is very asleep...as usual     School   English: missed it Contemporary American Issues: Made a poster Precalculus: Same story as last class - slept Spanish: Listened to review group ramble on senselessly Chemistry: Brought Marie her juice and caught a glimpse of the freshmen of whom I would be a reigning senior. Mu hu ha ha ha History: Was being a robotier for the freshmen  Came home and got a call. I forgot about hiking. I got dressed and we headed out. Quick hike, all good. I am still very sore from the sit-ups. Time that I do more soon though. I feel badly.  Came home, talked to my favorite person, and told my dad that I was doing so. :-D  Now I keep thinking about the same issue. This issue being wanting to say something, but being unsure of how good of an idea it is. It is something I am lax about with friends. With some friends it is true, such as Britt, Marie, and Rils. I will not say what it is here because that would contradict this paragraph. However, I do not wish to be lax with it, because I want this person to know that I am very serious, and what I am saying is very true.   Arg, I will probably slip up and say it one of these days. I have already come very close to doing it.   I am so glad that Tycho and I have gotten so close. It makes me feel so incredibly good. Well, hence my recently prior hesitations.   Well, none of that is making it obvious. Oh well. lol  It still feels like 70°F. Tomorrow it is supposed to get up to the 90s. Good hiking weather. I intend to take a very long walk, and maybe try running some. More of a workout.  I know there was more that I wished to post. Oops, y'all get off easy tonight, so please have a good one.  -J9  Song related to thoughts for the night (And I love singing Sarah McLachlan and her lyrics are always so deep. This is one of my favorites besides Angel and Building a Mystery)Bold parts are the big hitters.    I will remember you Will you remember me? Don't let your life pass you by Weep not for the memories  Remember all the good times that we had Let them slip away from us when things got bad Clearly I first saw you, smiling in the sun  I want to feel your warmth upon me, I want to be the one   I will remember you Will you remember me? Don't let your life pass you by Weep not for the memories   I'm so tired,I can't sleep Standin' on the edge of something much too deep It's funny how we feel so much but we cannot say a word We are screaming inside, we can't be heard    I will remember you Will you remember me? Don't let your life pass you by Weep not for the memories  I'm so afraid to love you, but more afraid to lose Clinging to a past that doesn't let me choose  Once there was a darkness, deep and endless night Gave me everything you had, oh you gave me light   And I will remember you Will you remember me? Don't let your life pass you by Weep not for the memories  I will remember you Will you remember me? Don't let your life pass you by Weep not for the memories Weep not for the memories    -I Will Remember You

      Well, I have survived another weekend. Now there is just one more to go. Then I will no longer be a junior at all, no more academics, and, most importantly, seeing Tycho.   Wow, my fingers do not want to wrok to type tonight. Very tired.  Wet out with my mom for the morning. Then cleaned. Then went to Jennifer's with Rob, Evan, and Mely. Did nothing. Remembered things of old and watched them beat the crap out of each other. Then Justin and Jenniger felt to baby-sit and the rest were to follow to get smoked up. I requested that I be brought home. Ended up plying pool again. Did fairly well for my standards anyways.   Well, I am sooooo tired. Talkt to y'all, later.   -J9

      Well, I am doing much better today. I even got a coffee that I refuse to drink. I am turning up caffeine!  lol, my dad did not think that the jalapenos that I ate after my caffeine rush were a good idea.   Got woken up from "sleeping in" at 8:30 by Rob calling from Jen's phone. They want to hang out and work on Justin's car today. Hell yes. Hopefully I can make it out there since I am cleaning my room now. I cleaned it earlier too and got some of my mother's things back to her. Now I am trying to get more done so I at least have a bed again. Then I can begin to rearrange things. This would not be such a horrible process if I could just take it one step at a time. Arg. I will get there. I have done it once before, and I will do it again.   lol, all I could say when I got that call was, "You bastard, remind me to kick the shit outta you when we all hang out." Jen is looking forward to seeing that since she says I am about 1/4 his size lol. She believes that I can do it though ;-P.  Yeah yeah Tycho, I know you are probably sitting over there thinking about saying something about me being a pretty intimidating person :-P. I am learning. I hope that you had fun, and I look greatly forward to talking to you again :-D  Thank you to those from LiveJournal who commented, by the way.  Let us see here, I shoud probably get back to cleaning, especially since I have updated so much in Tycho's absence. I wonder if he'll take the time to read all of it. I am kinda scared about his reading of my last entry before this one. It was just one of those moods.   I am out of it now, can you tell? Please? C'mon! I am serious, I am all better! Why do you not believe me?  ::sniff::   Just messing around right there. I am not only out of the bad mood, I am in a pretty goofy one.   Okay, I am done now, seriously!   Have a good day y'all!  -J9

      Not the best night on earth. Chilled with Leeanna and Lisa at the mall for a while after drinking regular Mountain Dew and Mountain Dew Livewire. That was pretty funny. Chilling in the arcade was fun. They dropped me off and Jen n'the crew picked me up. We hiked and they brought me out to a dam which was awesome. It was very peaceful and I wish I that I had brought a camera with me. I should start doing that anyways. Rils called me which is always pleasant. Luv ya hun. :-D  Otherwise, listening to some of the conversation during the night brought up a lot of painful memories and thoughts. I do not think I have ever felt my heart hurt so badly. I feel very emotionally drained right now. I miss Tycho so much, I have really come to need him for me to even be okay. It is basically inexplicable. Whenever I get to talk to him I just become a happier, all-together more optimistic person. I become more of the person I really wish I was all the time - as opposed to having these down times.  I decided to try to cut out the pain by drinking more caffeine. Got Monster. I tried to drink it very quickly after only having a salad around 12:30 this afternoon and it started affecting me immediately. Like the No Fear from New Hampshire. What happened with the No Fear was that my hands and arms went cold and were shaking. I could not sit still. My heart was also racing a little bit.  Tonight was much worse. My heartbeat was astoundingly, and definitely terrifyingly quick. I could barely breathe. I do not think that I have ever been more scared of something happening to me from an energy drink. Actually, I have never been scared, nevermind terrified. I am not sure if I can give up on caffeine, but I am definitely staying away from it. I layed down and basically had to sleep it off.   No worries though, I am back to normal now. Just very depressed. I am sure that I will get over it quickly. I am looking forward to finally being able to sleep in. Of course I will not though. Just because.   I think I update too much in this. Maybe I do anyways. It is just nice to finally be able to freely divulge information, which has not been poor information really until tonight.   I apologize immensely for the negativity of this post. I assure you that it is strictly temporary. I can never really stay in a negative mood for long. As of the moment thinking of Tycho and Rils is making me smile, so it really is not that bad.   I just needed to get it all out. And I do feel that even after this post that I am still going to desire a small amount of support and/or reassurance. I hate to put a load of any sort, but I am sort of looking to Rils and Tycho for that. I know Marie can help me out, or at least help me to turn it into a joke so that I can handle it better. I need a ride with her I think lol. Rils and Tycho, no one is closer to me than you both. Neither of you could ever believe how important you are to me and how much I appreciate your presence in my life. I do not know what I would do. Marie, you never cease to get me to laugh. Whether I am just having one of those days, or there is a new grave and the day has been going along poorly, I always seem to perk up at lunch with you and Brittany. You can always relate, and can understand me. You and Rils always forgive me when I am being moody and act poorly towards you, and I appreciate that a lot.  I have written all that because I realized today how important it is to let people know that you realize what they do for you, and let them know how much it means to you. I do not want to loose anyone else. Y'all are my life. I could never wish to have better friends, because they do not exist.   Tycho- I really hope that you do trust me in how I feel about you. I could never imagine having the good fortune of being with someone as amazing as you. I am honored to even know you. By being who you are you have taught me so much. lol, it is still hard for me to believe that we are together, just because it was something that I wanted so badly and things never had really worked out the way I wished they would. I am so incredibly happy that this has worked out and I pray that nothing changes it. Thank you for being in my life.  Rils- From just starting to talk in the 8th grade to where we are now has been amazing. Our friendship literally just seemed to grow and grow. I have done some pretty dumb things, but you saw through them and stuck by me. That means so much. Bowling, the Hippodrome, World Civ, ridiculous movies, Spanish, Chemistry, English, lunch, sleeping over, freezing my ass off, just everying. We have had so much fun, and our friendship means so much to me. I am so glad that you know that you can call me anytime and that I will be there to help you. And thank you for helping me.    Marie- the morning rides lol. You catch me at just about every main point in my day and my mood can basically be determined and altered by our talks. In the morning when I am in a poor mood we are usually able to turn it into a joke that we are able to look back at and laugh about. Especially our graves lol. We have this uncanny way of being able to relate to each other, and you always understand me. Thank you for helping me through, and helping me to remember to smile and laugh.  Brittany- who probably does not read this, I am sorry for not really mentioning you much earlier, but you also mean a lot to me. Since 4th grade we have had one of the oddest relationships that friends can have. But that is just the characteristic of it. The point is, that we always end up back as friends. FIRST, student hosts, the dreams, the sleepovers, odd food mixtures, movies, becoming who we are together. Thank you for coming back, listening to me, and showing me a good time.   Well, aren't (stupid conjunctions, I avoid them as much as possible and then I get a situation like that) I being incredibly sappy? Like I said, I realized a good amount of things today. Perhaps I needed it.   I think I have said enough for one difficult evening. And I am feeling better. Please have a good day or night.   -J9

      Well, Jen said she was going to try to call me today and see if she couldn't work something out with her boyfriend and her brother so we could do hang out on the pike. I do not even know if Robbie has his car back or yet :-\. If Jen cannot get ahold of him I have no idea how I am supposed to lol. I really need to store her phone number in my phone so that I stop getting so confused when she calls me. I think she is the "Jm" in my phone that I forgot who it was. lol, too bad I have no idea what her last name is. She is wicked cool people though.  Anways, it was either to wait for her call...or find people who were around now to go spend the day/evening with. So far, I have found a few people...I guess they were actually waiting for me to call since they were not sure when I would be back from SATs (which sucked really bad, by the way. The math section on this one sucked. I am nowhere near as confident on this one as I had been in Windsor Locks). So, maybe we'll chill for the day and if Jen calls me the night will be reserved for them.   I need to survive on $15. Crap. Not good. I need a job which barely requires for me to be there.   Maybe I will only buy a colatta this afternoon and I will pay for it in change giving me the illusion that I saved money lol.   Meh, I have about 15-20 minutes before I have to head out on my walk to meet them. I was going to try to make myself reorganize my room some more. It is not going to be done until we have that tag sale, because there is too much stuff in my room and I hate the clutter like that. I would so much prefer if it were barren.   I could have sworn that there was more that I wished to write in. :-\ Poo.  Anyways, question:    Who have I actually told from LiveJournal that I moved here? Please comment just so that I know. I know about four poeple who read this for sure but I just want to check. Thanks muchly!    That works for that anyways. Arg, I know that there is something that I am forgetting.  ::checks handy-dandy planner, crosses out yesterday, for it is one more day survived::   Well, there is nothing listed. I have no idea. I think that I was supposed to call my mom though. Whoops. There is always tomorrow.   Okay, well, it is nearing time for me to head out. I shall talk to y'all later.   Tycho, I hope you are having fun camping! Sorry about my sleeping last night!   -J9

      Well, today was decent enough.   English - pop quiz on Macbeth which I got a 92% on. One 8-point question wrong.  Precalculus - Panaccione went off on a tangent about having dreams the whole class.  Study - made more applications for Aces High  Spanish - listened to a presentation bu group 1. Slept through most of it actually.  Chemistry - couple of worksheets with Rils. Pretty basic.  History - wrote a letter with Rils in Miss Sjodin's defense and slept through Hitler movie.   WDhen I got home I took a shower and came into my room for an hour long nap in the sunshine. It was nice, and much needed. Woke up to a call from friends to hang out earlier in the evening.  I walked down to Dunkin Donuts and got a strawberry colatta (spelling?) then we left for the Holyoke mall. I ended up buyig a new DKM CD and belly button ring. Fun stuff. They bought the William Hung CD which also had a DVD so we listened to it all the way back to their house and then watched the DVD. William Hung is actually a pretty mean dude. It was funny. We plan to bring it to Battlecry.   ::sigh:: Battlecry...  As I was getting dropped off I was finally struck with the best part of my day every day. A call from Tycho. :-D I'm so glad that we got to talk. I miss you!!!  Also, I do not know if I should take offense to this or not:  Slickknick2001:  wat kind collage u want to get in Jaenen6:  Law/Business college Jaenen6:  Western New England Slickknick2001:  oh great u make a great lawyer  lol  Well, SATs bright and early tomorrow. Heads up for the longest weekend for me EVER. Not only do I have to wait for it to be over, I probably can't talk to Tycho. I hope he enjoys himself immensely and that I will be able to hear fun stories later on.   Enjo everything you do!   -J9

      Well, after my last update I walked to Denslow aka Cemetary Park and sat on the swings for a while. I even sat through a brief rain shower. There were some rather contemptuous girls there, who oddly enough had British accents. I was a bit confused. All good though.   After that I began the walk to the high school. The air was a bit chilled, but the walking was pleasant enough. About 2/3 the way there this purple van pulled over and I saw my friend Mark aka "Shmarky" stick his head out and ask if I would like a ride the rest of the way. I accepted, and then felt bad because now I haven't walked enough. I was grateful of the lift none-the-less.  The concert went well, everyone performed well. One soloist went a little bit too freestyle, however, and it wasn't his best idea ever.   Hmmm, foot is asleep again.  After the concert, April aka Rils - her grandparents gave me a ride to Friendly's with them and got me dinner. Buffalo Chicken Wrap. Yum. A lot of people were there and it was a lot of fun. Thank you so much Rils. It was great.   School tomorrow, Senior Skip Day. Should be nice. Hopefully it will go quickly, although nothing is going to be swift enough until I see Tycho again.   Finally figured out a date for all of that too, good thing lol. Talked about a lot tonight actually.   No clue what is going on tomorrow night, but since Tycho is going to be out I should probably find some way to preoccupy my time. There is always someone I can find to chill with.   Well, I was originally going to keep this short but that never tends to happen so I will end this here. Have a good night/morning/day/evening lol.   -J9

      Woke up on time for once this morning lol, that's a good way to start the day. First period my precalculus teacher embarrassed me a good bit by singling me out and saying, "Did everyone know that Janine was such a good speaker? She did such a good job, you are a very good speaker..."  Suuure, increase my ego some more there Panaccione. There are a few things that people can say to really make me feel pretty good about myself and expand the ego, and that is one of them.   Second period, more talk of potentially making an appearance in court. Luckily, the school gave up. Worked some more in the technology department ... where I found out that Shannon, Rils, Paula (who didn't really need to take it in the first place), and I get to skip the final for Contemporary American Issues. YAY!!! I get out at 9:45 instead of noon that day because of that!   Third - Study hall I made applications and announcements for Aces High...how very productive of me.  Fourth - Spanish, signed yearbooks.  Lunch, sitting there as usual...and then my bag started vibrating across the table. At first I just thought that it was a text message but it kept buzzing so I look at it to see "Tycho Main Calling". I didn't answer quick enough so I hit "Call" and put the side of my head to my bag. I was pretty worried. After I found out that it wasn't anything bad I calmed down and was really happy to have talked to him in the middle of the day. The bad thing was I had not told of my friends about Tych because I did not see the reason to just come out and say it out of nowhere. Now that he has found out a while after the fact he probably feels betrayed and is a little upset with me. It happened like that before in a similar situation. I felt like shit after that.  Fifth - Chemistry - Mr. Pease got suspended!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! How horrible is that? I am fricken devastated. It is so unfair to him, he is such an awesome guy. :-(  Sixth - History - Video on Hitler.   Now I think I am going to head out for a walk to distract myself from being hungry.   My cell will be on and with me.   Music department concert at 7:00pm at the high school. I think that I am going to go to that. My cell will still be on during, but I won't answer right away. If I get a call I'll give a quick call back during an intermission.   Well, talk to y'all later!  -J9

      Today started off in one of the most interesting manners ever! But first, I must tell you about a time that I planned to take a two hour nap. From about 6:30PM-8:30PM. I set the alarm on my cell to wake me up, and did it correctly, however, it did not go off. This made me iffy on the status of my phone.  I can't really remember when Tycho and I went to sleep, but I know it was after 3. Ihad planned to wake up at 6:15AM to get decked out for the assembly. Well, this morning I snapped awake and without putting my glasses back on, checked the time. I saw 6:45AM, which meant that I had 10 minutes to get ready and go. Even the clock in the kitchen seemed to say so. I rush around and book out of the door. Once I got to Marie's I was confused to see her garage door shut. I then figured that it would be best if I walked back out to the bus stop. I get back there and finally pause to look around. It was dark-ish, no construction workers were out, and my neighbor was not home yet. Very odd. I look at the time on my cell phone again only to find that it read 6:03AM. Without my glasses, I thought for sure the 5 was a 6. Oh well.  The senior assembly was postponed because Mr. Czarnecki was late. Once it finally started it was awesome as usual. Rils and I even got in the show. There was a pciture of the two of us at prom in the senior slide show lol.   Shattered dreams? No? Oh well.  Our assembly started a bit late, but I was decked out in my scally cap, duct tape vest, gold medal from BAE, and button belt. Caution tape as well. I went through school like that :-D  Brian had blue hair and his lab coat.   We got to show two movies and did our speeches. The attendance was awesome.  We also recruited a lot of new members! I now have a project of setting something up for them at the Aces High summer picnic. Which reminds me, I have to see if Tycho would like to accompany me to that...  After the assembly I spent half of my next class helping to put things away. Once I got to class, I collapsed on the floor and that was it. I remained there the rest of class.  5th period I blew through a lab very quickly so that I could finish it and sleep. Which I did some more of.  6th period, we had to accompany our teacher to the sophomore class officer elections. I slept through that too.  Got on the bus...slept.  Got home, checked on my dad who is doing great, went into my room...and slept.   Went to meeting, same old same old. A member from Techno Wizards 809 may be joining us because their team may no longer exist. Emhart is pulling out of Enfield which would take away their main sponsor.  LEGO told the Lego Maniacs basically to go fuck themselves. Not in that terminology, but team 96 no longer has sponsorship either :-(  Well, I am going to go chat now and wait to hopefully talk to Tycho tonight. Later all.   J9

      Okay, now that I am done with the bullsh little Livejournal entry I can finally done some real writing. And quick thanks to those Livejournal users who now stray from their friend's pages to read my life here lol.   Today went by much more quickly than most days. Usually I can tell when it is the last class of the day, but today I was ready for one more. With that extra energy, Jennie and I walked home making fun of the demographics of our town.   lol, I could not think of the word "demographic" so I went out into my kitchen and gave its definition and right away my brother Jon pops up and says it. My other brother Ben just looked at him and started with the, "Haha, Jon is a bookworm!". I thought it was kind of funny. I asked him what it made me since I was looking for the word in Jon's defense. I did not stick around for the response. I did not want to know.  I need to walk or something, hearing about the "hott chicks" at robotics totally slaughtered any self confidence that I had today and I really feel as though I need to do something about it.   Arg, stupid bad weather.    ::looks at watch impatiently, waiting for 8:45pm to roll around::   I am looking forward to the two assemblies that I have tomorrow. One is for the seniors, then the rest of the school joins in. It is a slide show of pictures and memories for seniors...they play sad songs...speeches I think. This is one of the big things I had been looking forward to in High School:   In the auditorium, each class has their own section and it moves across the establishment. I believe that it is Freshmen - Seniors - Juniors - Sophomores. Well, after this assembly, the seniors leave for their senior outing and the order changes. Juniors bump up into the Senior position and are welcomed as the WLHS's newest graduating class. It is awesome and extremely symbolic...which is great for me as seeing that symbology is a big focus for me. Sentimentally n'such.  So, looking forward to that. Then, the Aces High assembly where I get to do a lot of public speaking...on stage...with a microphone!!!!!! I also get to do a bit of competition-wear and attitude for the day. It will be fun.   Robotics rarely ceases to make me happy. The only time it did not was when a person who was unafiliated was giving me a hard time and now that was a long time ago.  Now, I get robotics and Tycho to look forward to :-D  I also wish to apologize to anyone who tried to talk to me before the middle of 2nd period today. My mood was very foul and I should not have acted in the manner that I did.   The tech department, Riso, and thinking better of the situation on my mind brought me out of it and as most of you will notice had me back to normal by lunch.  Extremedies breaking off...hmph. :-P lol  Anyways, as Rils said to me earlier today "Sorry about my verbal diarrhea..."  That is pretty gross huh? I was amused. Talk to y'all later, hopefully some sooner than others. Take care!  -J9
