      Hmm, just made this Blogger account for basically no reason.  Will need to decide whether to use this here, or my own at ubc physics. Hmm.

      Well, I finally finished  From Beirut to Jerusalem .  Actually, I finished it a while ago, but haven't posted anything here in a while.  On my rating system, I'd give it a 2.  It was really quite interesting, and I learned a LOT about the situation in the middle east... but for some reason it took me a long time to get through it.  I would have given it a 3 if it had somehow held my attention better, and had me not being able to put it down.  The book wasn't an exhaustive history of the area, but you didn't really need that much background to follow along.  I would say that the book is suitable regardless of your current knowledge level.  Since then I read  The In-Between World of Vikram Lall  by MG Vassanji.  I would also rate it as a 2.  It talks about an Indian family living in Kenya and Vikram's rise up the ranks in the government.  Eventually he becomes involved in some shady dealings.  It's fiction, but a lot of the background stuff is true... so you learn a bit about the history of the region along the way.  One thing I found interesting was the references to people from India as being Asian.  I haven't really come across that before.  Cool.  So I guess my fancy book review markup has gone out the window.  Oh well.  Now I am reading  A Storm of Swords  by George R.R. Martin.  It's the third  a really good (IMHO) fantasy series.  Needed a break from all these serious books.  What's up with all this &lt;span style&gt; markup stuff.  What happened to good old &lt;i&gt;?

      Well, the previous post seems to be formatted in a sortof lame way, but I don't know if I should bother to fix it at the moment!  I think I'll just move on.

      Decided to use this service rather than publishing on the physics site.  Thought I'd repost all previous entries here:  April 6, 2004  I recently bought a copy of U2's "Go Home" DVD. I actually thought I was buying a CD since it came in a CD case (and there was a DVD cased DVD available as well) but a DVD is OK too. Nevertheless, I thought it might be nice to have the audio on CD since I find that I rarely "watch" DVDs to hear the music. I didn't know how to accomplish this so I set out to searching on the web. I found a couple of windows programs for sale (some with trial versions), but since no-one uses that outdated operating system anymore I kept looking. Eventually I found some references to "transcode". Transcode has full audio and video "transcoding" capabilities including the ability to rip audio tracks from DVD. After resolving some library problems I got it to compile and was able to rip my audio tracks in WAV format without much hassle. This note is basically to tell you that transcode is the program you want if you want to rip DVDs in linux. If you want to convert WAVs to mp3 format, try "notlame". Eventually I was able to burn the music to CD (2 of them (un?)fortunately) and now have what I thought I was buying originally. Yay.  New topic. Recently it has come to my attention that genius physicists seem to make their most important discoveries either in the middle of the night or while sleeping, perhaps both. Maybe this is true for other disciplines as well. Unfortunately I rarely solve physics problems in the middle of the night. My Nobel prize dreams are dashed :) Clearly this bears further investigation. I wouldn't be surprised if there isn't literature about this already, probably in some kind of sleep journal. I just looked it up. There is in fact a journal called "Sleep." You can check it out at www.journalsleep.org. I just downloaded an article, so presumably it's either free for all, or UBC has an online subscription. I just discovered thast there exists something called the Epworth Sleepiness Scale. Nice.  April 2, 2004  A note of explanation on my 3 point rating system. I didn't choose something more standard like a 10 point system, because then I have to think too much about whether or not a book is a 6 or a 7 etc. and I'm bad at making decisions. To elaborate on yesterday's brief explanation, I'll give examples of what kinds of books would get which rating.  Books that are truly bad would get a 1, but I generally don't read books that are bad. No doubt there are a lot of bad books out there, but somehow my system of choosing which books to read manages to filter these out (recommendations, Oprah's Book Club :), critical acclaim, whatever). Other books that I would give a 1 to would be books that were OK, but just didn't strike me as especially special. For instance, W. Somerset Maugham's  Liza of Lambeth  was ok, but I just didn't find it to be all that amazing and wouldn't really tell anyone else to read it.  I would give a 2 to books that I liked and would recommend to others.  Examples are  In the Skin of a Lion  by Michael Ondaatje and  A Fine Balance  by Rohinton Mistry.  Books that get a rating of 3 are truly memorable and really struck me in some way.  In addition to  AHWOSG , mentioned below, I would include  The Poisonwood Bible  by Barbara Kingsolver and  North to the Night  by Alvah Simon.  Wow, all that information is probably really boring. Hopefully I will actually use to rank more books. Anyway, I also figure that I should make the book reviews stand out a bit more, rather than just appearing in the text. Hmm, ok, so how about this:   Book Review    Title :  A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius                     Author : Dave Eggers                    Rating : 3                    AHWOSG  is, surprisingly, pretty much what the title says. It's written in an incredibly frank style and had me laughing out loud numerous times. Despite being funny, this is not an uplifting or happy book, rather it is a somewhat depressing memoir of a guy who has experienced some great loss in his life. (Good enough, I mentioned a bit more esterday)  Ok, thats that!  April 1, 2004  What a day to start a blog? Oh well. I actually meant to start last night but didn't. I've been meaning to do this for a while, just to keep track of stuff like books I've read.  Anyway, last night I finished reading  A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius  by Dave Eggers. I'm going to go ahead and make up a ranking system of 1-3, with one being not recommended, 2 being recommended, and 3 being very recommended. I'll probably rank most things 2 and 3 since I generally like books.  Ok, so I give this book a 3. It's kindof depressing, but really funny, and despite the sometimes hard to read-ness of books that get kindof symbolic and artsy at times, this one really wasn't. Hard to read that is. I don't really get the ending exactly, but that  s probably to be expected. The book is essentially a memoir of a part of the author's life, beginning with the tragic death of both his parents. The writing style is different but appealing, he just writes whatever he was thinking, totally "honest".  Was about to read a very coffee stained copy of  The Colony of Unrequited Dreams  by Wayne Johnston (was on Canada Reads last year), but then went to the library and took out Thomas Friedman's  From Beirut to Jerusalem  instead.  I figure I should know more about things in the Middle East. Apparently it's an important topic :) Seems good so far, and surprisingly readable (it seems like it's sortof a memoir of his time there as a foreign correspondent).

      Augh! I feel that my research career is basically just the random discovery of extremely relevant papers which have already accomplished what I've been working on forever.  I can search and search for good relevant papers and never find anything... then just by coincidence some day I always end up something I really wish I'd known about earlier.  If they haven't published exactly the same thing I was doing then it is at least quite important and needs to be incorported into my stuff... or could have saved me loads of time if I'd known about it.  Bleah.  I guess it's better that I find out about it now rather than later.  Some kind of mixed blessing.

      So, in this book I'm reading (Storm of Swords by George RR Martin), the author keeps killing off the main characters!  This isn't even really a spoiler for anyone since it keeps happening, and you won't be able to figure out who will die!  It's kinda frustrating actually, because you spend all this time getting to know the character.... and they are really interesting etc. and then they're DEAD!  Argh!  Anyway, this is probably why these books are so good.  Ahh, nice sounds of Blue Rodeo wafting over from across the lab...  I'm gonna go listen.
