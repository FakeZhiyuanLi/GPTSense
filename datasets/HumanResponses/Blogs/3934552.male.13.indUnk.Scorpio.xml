      you might have guessed. the teachers are bombarding us with assignments nowadays, they just cant wait to see us suffer in the tests.  i think i am really unlucky as a human being.  no aim, slacky but some goals for life  now i plan to get in contact with my best friend Dean..just cant forget him...never forget him...  and why the heck is my hair turning browner each day. Peeps look at me as if i hi-lighted it.  Anyway Singapore Idol rox..its so funny other than that, i dont think is nice to watch it. Imposters of Will Hung and blah. Guess what i havent even catch a single episode! too busy lately so you get the new about it and i pay you to say it to me....quater buck for each sentence...sounds good?  sigh'o the jack lo test tommorrow.... bless my ye mighty and despair....  gd news MRP completed!! after the call from my mentor reached my phone. my dad was informed too! lucky he was not incensed...not to mention the minor things which really mess my life up.  Climbing up the beanstalk soon

      wheeeww! poof...thats some real action at the bay.  Its really fruitful today, 1st we went to the tent of moscow circus. Then the fantastic and crowdy fireworks. Everything was enjoyable, but i felt that something was missing. I stand alone in the crowds looking at couple hugging and touching. While I sat with my sister and dad, the pair was happy and warm. The romantic lights of the bay and the cooling night breeze blew me to my soul. How i wish i was like the hundreds around me, happy, very happy........   Well signing off...too tired today  happy 39th birthday Singapore!

      in the past few days, my band had been training hard for a parade. First off, we were new to this field of outdoor band. The trophies of outdoor performance were already outdated. LongLonglong ago...so today, we prove that we can make it again. Being the top bands in the nation.   Alrite, i think our efforts did not go down the drain. At least we put up a performance and held ourself to the last. The immense heat did not fail us, the unwanted jeers did not bother us. Till we marched past the Grand Stand, with the piece " 76 Trombones".    The entire school cheered...they are taken aback!  WEEEE!
