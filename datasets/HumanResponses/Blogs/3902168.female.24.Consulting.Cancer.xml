      Yesterday my face wasn't very good - I had 2 big pimples on either side of my face on my cheeks by my ears. The left side of my face has a big area of redness and pimples, I feel ugly as hell, and don't want to really be in public at all. I know that S (my friend, although I suppose we're seeing eachother, everyone around us sees us as a couple) has said he thinks I'm beautiful regardless.  Yesterday I picked up my sister from the airport - had to circle and circle for about an hour. After that I called my friend S and we said, "Hey, my sister is hungry - can we meet at Wegmans by the Chinese buffet? My treat!" "OK.." ISo my sister and I are waiting, waiting, and it takes him about 25 minutes. When he arrives, he's like, oh I showered, I thought you meant that you'd have already started eating. "No, I meant I'll meet you here soon - 'my treat' generally means I'll buy you dinner". So miscommunication = annoyed = don't really feel like hanging out anymore. Stress. Unfortunately S is in love with me and I don't want to hurt his feelings.  My sister and I go to the rink. I buy some tape, and my friend R at the counter (who lives with S) is like, why don't you use S's tape? My sister says something like "oh, they have a prenup about tape".. That really annoys me, because I'm not comfortable with the notion of being a couple with S. Yeah I love him as a friend, but I don't want a committment.  So pickup starts (ice hockey), and the level is really high that night, and I'm (as usual) the only girl. I really don't see the puck at all - few people pass "to the girl". So I'm not having a lot of fun. I leave early. S has his game after pickup, and my sister wants to stay and watch. It's probably 11 PM already, and I know waking up is going to be a BITCH tomorrow. So she says, ok meet me and C (one of the girls that works at the rink that she has been chatting with, also a friend of mine) in the gym above the rink to hang out. I see my friend H who is going to scorekeep for S's game, so I sit in the scorekeeper's box with her. My sister comes down and is annoyed with me for not going up to the gym. H and I talk for quite a bit about the situation with me and S. About how he's not the one for me, how I'm not attracted to him (my sister always yells at me about this, how it only matters what he's like as a person), how we have different values..   I could go on and on, and I probably will in future posts - but for now, I'm in a bad situation where S loves me, and the feeling isn't returned, but I don't have it in me to say anything. I'm just kinda tooling along with him to make him happy. I hate hurting people's feelings.   On the way home from the rink, my sister and I were talking, and then we started fighting. I get down on myself, and she at one point said "you are threatened by me and I don't know why" "you resent me".. That's a bit harsh, but I know that she's prettier, taller, in better shape, funnier.. you know, the more attractive younger sister, and people love her, so I get depressed easily around her. Not good for stress levels.  A while ago we had a conversation, and it basically went, I would like it if you (my sister) make me breakfast in the morning, because I'm buying food and you're staying at my house this summer for really cheap; I don't think it's that hard to just make a bigger pot of oatmeal. Anyway so this morning she makes herself oatmeal, and when I get downstairs, I ask if there is some for me, "oh no, I'm sorry, are you mad?" "No, but I thought we had talked about this" .. Perhaps it's unfair of me to ask, but regardless.. it annoyed me. More stress.  Anyway, so it's still less than a week since my new drugs started, and no changes yet.  Oh, I'm here in my lovely cubicle, doing stuff I can't stand. What a crappy day.

      Hey all,  I don't know how much difference I'm going to see day to day, so I may drop my posts to a weekly frequency.  I have a coldsore:(  Actually I got it last Friday - damnit. It's mostly gone now.  I've been taking all my drugs regularly - don't really notice any differences now.   I *did*, however, buy new front wheels for my car. Why does this matter? Well because now my poor baby doesn't shake or pull or cry anymore (car - I'm single! no kids! Promise!), and that is a huge relief - I was afraid to drive the car, but I had to! 20 miles each way to work - can't really afford a rental car.. This has been bothering me for a while, so now that I have 2 new wheels, got the car aligned, and the nice man at the counter gave me a discount.. I'm feeling better. Maybe this reduction in stress will kindly manifest itelf in my skin?!  Oh, I just remembered - When I was at Dr. C's, he said, "there ain't no reason we can't get your skin to be POY-FEKT" (pefect Ã  la Brooklyn :) )  ~J

      Hey Everyone,  Let me introduce myself. I have cystic acne.  Not *horrible* - not to the point that children would point and laugh, but enough that it has been a factor for as long as I can remember.   Pimples and redness, always there. Comes in waves. I'm not very good at keeping a calendar of my periods, so I can neither confirm nor deny that my condition changes as a function of the time of month.  Right now, my forehead is ok. Chin has a few. Sides of my face, especially the left side on my cheek and next to my ears is the worst now.  This is the first post I've made, so it'll be pretty jumpy - trying to get it all in here.  What have I tried?  1. Over-The-Counter (OTC) everything. Benzoyl Peroxide, Salicylic Acid, Cleansers, Wipes.  2. ProActiv! This has worked for a bunch of people - for me, no dice. 3. Antibiotics*.. I put a star here because it was so long ago, I can't remember which pills they were.. plus they couldn't have worked because... Here I am now, still trying new things. 4. That clear stuff in the blue tube - can't remember the name off the top of my head. 5. Sulfacet R - This was prescription. I seem to remember it working pretty well a while ago. I got a new prescription for it not too long ago - isn't working too great. Maybe it's keeping things less severe, but I don't see any improvement. I'm going to finish off this set of bottles, but don't think I'll continue. 6. Clinique's 3 step program - not for acne, but my thought process was - if I spend a lot of money and take care of my skin, it should clear up. NEGATIVE.   I went to see my new Dermatologist, Dr. C (if my skin clears up, all you lucky readers will get his name.), one day after my 24th birthday. I should have gone so long ago, but you know how it is.. with a full time job and a case of laziness..   Anyway, he knew right away that I had cystic acne - others in the past haven't really given me specific info on my condition. We talked about my history with acne (whole life), if I'm stressed now (yes, I hate my cubicle), if I'm sexually active (um, yeah.), and what I've tried in the past (read above). He was honest and said, we're going to try a few things. I need you to be patient - give me a few months to see how this works, and if not, we can move on to more severe treatments (aka Accutane). He told me all about Accutane and it's serious risks - almost guaranteed birth defects, depression, severe dryness (I went online that night to read up on it, and yep - people are going nuts with chapstick). He asserted the importance of an internal and external treatment - which is why nothing in the past has worked for me - we have to treat the bacteria from inside.  So, what did he put me on, you ask?  1. Antibiotics - Minocycline. 1 pill a day. (this is day 2) 2. Cleanser - AVAR   (This is the exact same formulation as my topical Sulfacet-R lotions... hmm..) This medicine is used as a cleansing product to help treat acne. This product contains an antibiotic and drying agent that work by promoting the shedding of the top layer of skin (keratolysis). It may also be used to treat other skin conditions as determined by your doctor. (this is day 2)  Just as a note - I am not a huge fan of my current job - I really don't care, so I've stopped wearing makeup all together - just putting on Oil of Olay's sensitive moisture day lotion with 15% SPF. It's pretty light so I usually put on 3 layers; any less and my face feels dry.  I'm also on birthcontrol pill right now. It's been 7 weeks, and no improvement in face.  I'll try to update every day, and put tips and anything else that comes to mind regarding my acne, and acne treatments in general.
