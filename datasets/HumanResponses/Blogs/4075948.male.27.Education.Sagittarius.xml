      I haven't missed a  urlLink Democratic Convention  since 1984, when I was seven. However, living in  urlLink England , where I moved from my native  urlLink Chicago  last year, presents its challenges. Although the convention is being covered heavily in the news, the live coverage of what is "prime time" in the  urlLink United States  is on in the middle of the night here (on  urlLink BBC Parliament , and I haven't got cable, satellite or  urlLink Freeview ). So I've been getting up every morning and -- since it's summer and I haven't got anything better to do -- watching the speeches on  urlLink C-Span.org  and the commentary on the  urlLink Online NewsHour  in my pyjamas, much to the bemusement of my English friends.    So it's Friday morning now and I haven't yet watched last night's goings-on, so I can't comment on  urlLink John Kerry  or  urlLink Madeleine Albright . But I've been impressed with the convention so far. It's been great hearing  urlLink Al Sharpton  railing against the hypocrisy and racism of the Republicans, and  urlLink John Edwards's  old-fashioned populism. I've equally enjoyed being introduced to  urlLink Barack Obama  and seeing old standbys like  urlLink Jesse Jackson  and  urlLink Ted Kennedy .    But the Rock Star is  urlLink Clinton . Although I disagreed with much of his policy, I'm a big apologist for him and I kind of well up with emotion when I hear him speak. It feels like he's the President-in-Exile (although, of course, that's  urlLink Al Gore , whose speech was preferred by Ms Pillsbury). The speech, as usual, was pitch-perfect. I love how he presented himself as the undeserving beneficiary of Republican tax policy in a sort of straw man fallacy and deployed phrases like "Strength and wisdom are not opposing values" which suggests (rightly) that  urlLink George Bush  is a thuggish imbecile without ever mentioning him by name. Similarly, praising Kerry's curiosity and openness to opposing viewpoints intimates (again, correctly) that Bush is both narrow-minded and dictatorial. Genius.    I'd sort of forgotten how unpleasant things have become in America in the last few years. I spoke last week to an Irish friend of mine who's lived in the States for the last two decades. He bemoaned how the country he saw 20 years ago as open, diverse and rife with opportunity had become gripped by censorship, fear and religious intolerance.  urlLink Ireland , he said, has made tremendous progress in that time (Ms Pillsbury and I are going there next week, so I'll let you know what I think). If he were a young man in Ireland today, he'd never dream of emigrating to America.    I have to hope that the usurper can be toppled this year, that he won't manage to commit another coup, and that my country, which is but a pale shadow of its former self, can return to something of the greatness of which it likes to congratulate itself.

      I'm starting this blog for two reasons.    1. Wil Wheaton has one and therefore so should I.    2. To one-up my friend Mr Safanda.

      I just watched the  urlLink Americans  get the silver medal in women's  urlLink gymnastics , losing (as usual) to  urlLink Romania . Sorry for spoiling it for you, American readers who will watch the 'plausibly' live version on  urlLink NBC  tonight, replete with sob stories. I kind of miss the sob stories. We get none of that here. Not even the ages, heights and home towns of the athletes. Just live coverage with no commercials.  Miss Pillsbury and I went flat hunting today. For the last year, we've been living in the house of a very nice woman who spends nearly all the year in  urlLink Ireland . Her house is spacious (there are entire rooms we never go into) and comfortable, but the décor leaves something to be desired. It's not entirely unlike living in your grandmother's house. My friends call it The Pink Palace. Although the owner would be happy to have us remain in the house, but being accustomed to  urlLink Chicago , we'd rather be in  urlLink Nottingham  city centre, which would be more convenient for my commute anyway, and someplace smaller and more attractive. We saw some nice flats today. One, in a converted convent, was especially gorgeous. The hard choice to make is do you pay a little bit more than you want to for something stunning, or do you pay what you want for a place that may be somewhat shabbier but has more room, free parking (for the nonexistent but possibly forthcoming car) and not only a washer but also a tumble dryer. I'll never understand why the British consider the dryer optional in the whole laundry arrangement.  In between viewings, we fulfilled an 11-month desire of mine and went to  urlLink Hooters  for a couple of pints and some  urlLink Buffalo wings . Bizarrely, it is the only Hooters in the UK. I had never been to any of the 10  urlLink Chicagoland  locations, but Miss Pillsbury had, and she assured me it was basically identical. The Stars &amp; Stripes waving outside (alongside  urlLink St. George's Cross ), American football memorabilia and photos of scantily-clad women on the walls, far too many TV's all showing sports ( urlLink cricket  in this case), and the waitresses were what you'd expect. It was only 3.30 pm, but there were a number of portly, ruddy-faced men enjoying a late liquid lunch or possibly just bunking off work. Alas, the  urlLink wings  were disappointing. They were overpriced at £5.50 for 10, with blue cheese and celery costing an additional £1.39. We also had to ask for extra sauce as they were served essentially dry (and not the slightest bit spicy), which set us back an extra quid. But it was suitably hilarious and now I don't have to go back.  In an update of today's earlier post, I spoke to my head of department and will be going into school on Thursday, hopefully assuaging my worries in the process. Thank you to my dear friend Miss Wesley, by the way, for your words of encouragement.  On an unrelated note, I discovered, thanks to the  urlLink New Yorker ,  urlLink this tremendous website  from the  urlLink Museum of TV & Television  featuring American presidential advertising going back five decades. Check out " urlLink Confessions of a Republican " from 1964. I'll also miss  urlLink Julia Child  terribly. The  urlLink Smithsonian  has an  urlLink online exhibit of her kitchen .

      My apologies, faithful readers, for allowing more than a week to elapse without adding to my blog. I'm slightly surprised with myself, frankly, for allowing the laziness to take over so soon. I must confess that there's no excuse for it. I've had bugger-all to do lately. The only two explanations I can offer are as follows:  1. When I'm in a lengthy period of inactivity, as I have been since my  urlLink PGCE course  finished on 25 June, I tend to become not only reclusive (almost to the point of  urlLink agoraphobia ) but slothful. I'd like to claim that I've been going to concerts and art galleries and volunteering my time to the cause of homeless kittens. But I've been sitting on the sofa in my pyjamas watching  urlLink Trisha .  2. I'm reasonably convinced that no one reads this blog, with the exception of my good friend  urlLink Mr Safanda  (he of the  urlLink ludicrous sunglasses ), and perhaps occasionally Mr Rosanova. And Safanda's been inexplicably preoccupied lately, so I thought, why bother?  urlLink Neighbours  is coming on.  (If indeed, my aforementioned faithful readers do exist, and you are one of them, and you'd like me to send you an e-mail message when my blog is updated, please notify me of such by leaving a comment on this posting, or  urlLink e-mailing me .)  However, my period of indolence is shortly to end. I start working a fortnight from tomorrow and start teaching the following Monday. It is with some apprehensiveness that I do so, a condition of which I find myself somewhat ashamed.  It's now nearly three years since I made the fateful decision -- having been made redundant by  urlLink The Man  -- to dedicate my professional life to education. Indeed, the idea goes back further than that: in  urlLink high school , I'd considered English teaching as a career. I was put off in  urlLink college  by the automatic assumption of idiots that that is the only vocational option open to  urlLink English majors , but did again consider it upon graduation, but then spent some time pursuing the almighty dollar instead.  My decision was confirmed by a period spent as a classroom assistant and substitute teacher at  urlLink my former school , a time I found enjoyable and enlightening if somewhat frustrating in its transience. In pursuing a teaching qualification, I made the (some would say momentous) decision to come to  urlLink England  to do the said PGCE course at  urlLink Nottingham  rather than, say, the equivalent course at the 'factory for teachers'  urlLink Northeastern Illinois University .  So obviously, this is a decision in which I've invested a lot of time, thought, money and emotion. So why do I find myself now daunted by it?  I didn't have the easiest teaching practice in the world. The thirteen-week practical portion of my course was spent teaching two-thirds of a fully qualified teacher's timetable at a local comprehensive secondary school. To be honest, I wasn't mad about the school. For a start, it was poorly maintained. In fact, it resembled a bomb site. The entire campus was strewn with litter, windows were cracked (and frequently broken into), buildings appeared to be crumbling. It smelled bad. This despite its excellent reputation in the community.  The staff (what we Americans call the faculty) weren't the warmest in the world. Not that they were unfriendly per se, just serious and business-like. So on top of having difficulty with the usual sorts of things -- figuring out how to plan effective lessons that square with the  urlLink National Curriculum , finding one's own classroom management technique, the enormous amount of time it takes to make materials and grade assignments -- I was feeling the pressure of constant judgement and criticism from the teachers.  In once instance, a teacher was clearly unhappy with one of my lessons she observed. Mystified,  she said, "I guess what I can do is to offer you strategies, since you're inexperienced and I've got experience." Duh, thought I. That's the whole point.  Part of my problem was my relative lack of experience with the  urlLink English school system , a condition with which the faculty eventually came to sympathise (my  urlLink university tutor , was always extremely helpful and sympathetic without being coddling). Having been educated at a fancy private school, I didn't exactly have the typical  urlLink American education  either.  I suffered from crippling  urlLink insomnia . I lay awake worrying and fretting. Some nights I only had two or three hours of sleep. I looked like death warmed over, my complexion sallow, my eyes saggy. I became irritable and paranoid. Needless to say, this does nothing to improve the quality of one's work or teaching.  This is what I'm afraid of repeating. I still want to be a teacher, I still think that despite its decline in prestige (and the disapprobation of Mr Rosanova, who's been aghast at most of my life decisions) it's the most noble and admirable profession one can pursue. I still genuinely like teenagers and love literature and language. But I don't want to lose sleep and sanity. And the doubts creep in: I'm disorganised, I'm lazy, I'm not smart enough or patient enough.  I get by in telling myself that it will be better than teaching practice. But part of my apprehensiveness is caused by uncertainty. I still don't know whether I'll have my own classroom, what classes and texts I'll be teaching, even whether the school has acquired permission for me to work in the  urlLink UK . This (despite the obstinate insistence of  urlLink the English  that it is not) is  urlLink Europe  in August, and  everyone  is on holiday. So I can't get any answers. Moreover, I don't even know how I'll get to school, since it's in  urlLink Derby  and for the moment I'm in  urlLink West Bridgford  without a car, a  urlLink UK driving licence , or the ability to drive the ubiquitous manual transmission.  I welcome assurance from experienced educators who survived both their teaching practice and first year of teaching and who still love the profession. Meanwhile, I'll continue to wallow in idleness while I can.

      For those of you who don't know, I was educated at  urlLink Oberlin , a small liberal arts college in  urlLink Ohio , some thirty-five miles south-west of  urlLink Cleveland . It's a small university with a deservedly progressive reputation: it was the first American college to educate women and black students. More recently, it was the first with co-ed dorms (i.e. mixed halls of residence). For the most part, I loved it. My classes were varied and interesting, it was a campus with a community feeling and, despite the size (3,000 students, 8,000 in the  urlLink town ) a rich arts scene and never a shortage of things to do.  One of the more irritating aspects, however, was the large number of generally wealthy students from the East Coast who poured disdain on the Midwest. "East Coast, West Coast, shit in-between" was an often heard sentiment. Sadly,  urlLink Lorain County , which contains Oberlin, has (allegedly) the lowest income per-capita and lowest literacy rate in the state. These snobs from  urlLink Hastings-on-Hudson  and  urlLink Jamaica Plain  took this as representative of the Midwest as a whole, and assumed that, because I was from  urlLink Illinois , I must have spent my formative years raising hogs and getting my jollies at  urlLink cow chip throwing contests .  How, exactly, such people ended up in small-town Ohio is unclear. Perhaps, since so little of it mattered to them, they'd never seen a  urlLink map of the United States  and assumed Ohio was about where  urlLink Maryland  is. They generally spent four years being veritable spigots of scorn, and then promptly moved to  urlLink New York  (or, if they were of a crunchy persuasion,  urlLink San Francisco ). There are entire boroughs of New York where you can't move without tripping over black-clad  urlLink Gauloises -smoking Oberlin grads on their way to a  urlLink Yeah Yeah Yeahs  gig. They think you're jealous of them for living in NYC, as if there were an entrance exam to get in, and you flunked it. They think they deserve an award for managing to hold down a job and pay rent in New York. The only time they've seen the Midwest since graduation is from a plane en route  urlLink Los Angeles .  It's probably no coincidence that when I emigrated to  urlLink England  I ended up about as far as you can get from the sea (although that's only 70 miles or so).  On a seemingly unrelated note, it was while I was an Oberlin student that I went through a brief period of paranoia about an asteroid striking the Earth and rendering humanity (and all other earthly life) extinct. It was 1998, the year of  urlLink Armageddon  and  urlLink  Deep Impact  . I can remember grocery shopping in  urlLink Kennington  while I was on the  urlLink Danenberg Oberlin-in-London Program  and hearing on the radio that an asteroid had been discovered that would strike the Earth some thirty years hence.  urlLink You can read the story here . Naturally, I prayed (or would have, had I been the praying sort) that I'd be near the point of impact and not on the other side of the globe, where I'd be left to starve to death or be killed by looting hordes. Eventually, it turned out that the calculations were wrong and I moved on to being paranoid about dying of meningitis or in a car crash or some such.  You may be wondering what these two disparate items have in common. All will now be revealed. I was listening to the  urlLink BBC Radio 4 News  this evening when I heard that a volcanic rock on  urlLink La Palma  in the  urlLink Canary Islands  (a favourite holiday destination of the  urlLink ruddy-faced Englishman  of an  urlLink earlier posting ) will at some point fall into the Atlantic, causing a mile-high tidal wave that will wreak destruction on the East Coast of the US, wiping out  urlLink Boston , New York,  urlLink Washington  and  urlLink Miami . It could happen next week, it could happen 100 years from now. ( urlLink You can read all about it here .) And unlike the asteroids, which are being closely monitored by  urlLink NASA  and the  urlLink ESA , you can't trust the shifty Spaniards to do a damn thing about it.  And I thought, that'll teach those effete bastards to stop feeling superior to everyone else. They'll regret thinking there's no point in living unless you've got an ocean in your backyard.  (And, of course, the  urlLink Great Lakes , which are in truth inland seas, don't count a whit. Of course, they're so geographically myopic that they've no idea that dual-peninsular  urlLink Michigan  has more coast line than the Eastern seaboard. I was once actually asked if you can see the other side of  urlLink Lake Michigan  from  urlLink Chicago .)  Fellow Midwesterners, hold your heads high: someday, the aristocrats from "back east" will be scrambling to live in  urlLink Duluth  and  urlLink Dubuque ,  urlLink Moline  and  urlLink Madison ,  urlLink Lansing  and  urlLink Lincoln . That is, if their noses aren't so high in the air as to obscure their vision of the incoming tsunami.

      We arrived back from a refreshing visit to  urlLink Ireland  last night. Unusually, one of the best experiences of the trip was flying. Normally, I hate flying, but discovered to my delight that at both  urlLink Nottingham East Midlands  and  urlLink Cork Airports  that when boarding the plane, you walk outside and up the stairs to the plane. Not only that, but they've got stairs at the front and back, enabling the passenger to get on and off much faster than those dreadful boarding bridges used at large airports. So it was a good start.  We flew to  urlLink Cork  and got an easy bus into the city centre, from which we took a bus to  urlLink Tralee  in  urlLink County Kerry . (It must be said that the  urlLink Bus Éirann  coaches are quite crappy compared with those of Britain's  urlLink National Express .) The journey was bumpy but very scenic. We passed through a sizeable stretch of mountains covered with coniferous trees. This came as a pleasant surprise to me. I should say here that although I've got some Irish ancestry, I'm not one of those Americans who advertises this loudly and considers Ireland to be some sort of motherland. So I went there fairly ignorant of what to expect.  In Tralee we were warmly met by our friends Mr and Mrs Leahy, and their two small children. Miss Pillsbury and I squeezed into the back seat of a hired  urlLink Volkswagen  and we promptly made our way to  urlLink Ballybunion , where the Leahys were renting a house for the week. Ballybunion is a very pleasant resort with a world-class golf course, large beaches and cliffs with spectacular views of the Atlantic as well as much of the coastlines of Counties Kerry and  urlLink Clare . Delightfully, it also features a  urlLink life-sized statue of Bill Clinton  with a golf club outside the police station. It's all as beautiful and green as you'd expect of an Irish seaside village.  Mr Leahy took us for dinner in a local tavern and we embarked on a mini pub crawl. Mr Leahy, a native Kerryman, as it turns out, knows absolutely everybody in the county and we couldn't go anywhere without meeting an acquaintance of his. I was surprised to discover that Irish pubs don't serve  urlLink real ale  like in  urlLink England . I enjoyed numerous pints of  urlLink Smithwick's Ale , even though it is pasteurised, carbonated and served very cold. I had also been curious about the recently adopted  urlLink smoking ban  in Irish pubs (and all buildings). I'd wondered if the lack of the smoky haze found in British and American pubs would reveal a stench of rancid beer, stale vomit and yesterday's lunch. Fortunately, this is not the case for the most part. Although I think government-imposed smoking bans are hypocritical when they reap the benefit of cigarette taxes, I wouldn't mind if more pubs and bars in the UK adopted their own smoking bans.  On Wednesday, we went to  urlLink Listowel , Mr Leahy's very pleasant home town. First we had a quick look at the remarkable newly recreated  urlLink Lartigue Monorailway . Then whilst the Leahys took care of some business matters, Miss Pillsbury and I passed a diverting hour in the  urlLink Kerry Literary and Cultural Centre . The exhibit begins with an excellent audio-visual presentation and then has several rooms each devoted to a single local author. It really is amazingly designed, and although I wasn't particularly familiar with any of the authors being celebrated, I would advise anyone travelling to Kerry to visit the centre (ideally for more than the hour we had). Afterwards, we lunched in its fine café with  urlLink Jimmy Deenihan , a Member of the  urlLink Irish Parliament  and a friend of Mr Leahy's. Later, after a breathtaking walk on the cliffs, we watched the sun set over the Atlantic whilst enjoying a tasty beverage at the  urlLink Ballybunion Golf Club . In truth, I was plied with several pints of Smithwick's.  After spending a couple of hours Thursday walking around Tralee, Kerry's attractive county town, we made our way back to Cork city, the Irish Republic's second largest. Cork, much of which is built on hillside, looks very much like a European city with its charming bridges across the River Lee. We intended to stay at a hostel, but finding it fully booked, went across the street to the  urlLink Auburn House  B&B, which at €60 per night including full Irish breakfast, is reasonably priced and very clean and pleasant. We found our bearings in the city and supped a pint in the historic An Spailpín Fánach pub.  The first thing we did on Friday was go to the delightful and informative  urlLink Cork Butter Musuem , a paean to my favourite dairy product. It covers the history and practice of butter making as well as its importance to the Irish economy in the last 40 years. The only things it lacked were a practical demonstration and free samples. The rest of the day before coming home was spent walking around Cork city centre, shopping and eating. I enjoyed a luncheon of boiled bacon and cabbage, which is the traditional Irish dish, not (as is assumed in the US) corned beef. (Americans who don't know better, take note: Irish and British bacon rashers are thicker and less fatty than American bacon strips; it's closer to Canadian bacon). In fact, I ate a tremendous amount of meat in the four days in Ireland: bacon, sausages, beef and chicken. As someone who's recently gone back to meat after some 18 months of  urlLink vegetarianism , it was a bit of an overload.  All in all, it was a very pleasant break from the norm, and another country to tick off the list. However, next time I visit the "Emerald Isle" I think I'd like to see  urlLink Belfast  and some of the sights of  urlLink Northern Ireland . I welcome comments from those who've been to Kerry and Cork to see if they agree with my sentiments.  And I promise I'll go back to ranting in the next entry.

      I was hoping to go home to  urlLink Chicago  for a few weeks this summer to see family and friends (although all my friends have been too lazy or cheap to visit me). Alas, due to my convoluted job situation, it has proved impossible. Essentially, the story is this: despite the national teacher shortage in  urlLink England  and my having recently got the English teaching qualification ( urlLink PGCE ), I cannot acquire the right to work in the  urlLink UK  on my own. A potential employer would have to apply for a  urlLink work permit  on my behalf. In theory, this is straightforward because teaching is a  urlLink skills shortage occupation . In practice, it's somewhat more complicated because, unlike big evil corporations, schools are unaccustomed to this process.  So a well-known, reputable  urlLink Nottinghamshire school  "offered me a job" (unofficially, not in writing, contingent upon their being able to secure a work permit for me) in June. Despite the aforementioned issues, I assumed that a handshake from the head meant business. A month on, I was invited in to school, ostensibly to discuss what classes and texts I'd be teaching. Upon arrival, I was ushered into the office of one of the senior management team and it was explained to me (apologetically, mind) that they'd had an applicant who was better suited to the job than me, and they didn't think they could justify to the Home Office wanting to hire me instead of him.  I was left in the lurch in July, by which time most good teaching jobs had been filled. Luckily, the English faculty at the  urlLink Nottingham School of Education  were very supportive and appalled by the "disgraceful" treatment I'd received. My tutor made some calls and it turned out that  urlLink Lees Brook Community Sports College  in  urlLink Derby  were still looking for an English teacher. I went in, interviewed, taught an "audition" lesson, and was offered the job. Their head, a woman with a reputation for getting things done and getting her way, assured me she'd sort out the work permit.  But in order to receive the work permit, I'll have to send my  urlLink passport  in. If I haven't got my passport, I can't leave the country. And even though I'm still in possession of it, I am nervous about leaving the UK and then trying to re-enter before this is all official. So a holiday in the  urlLink US  is out.  However, the good news is that (as previously mentioned), Ms Pillsbury and I are off to  urlLink Ireland  tomorrow, since a passport is unnecessary in travelling between the UK and the Republic of Ireland. It will be very good to get away for a bit. We fly from  urlLink Nottingham East Midlands Airport  to  urlLink Cork , from which we'll take a coach to  urlLink County Kerry  to meet two friends of ours who live in  urlLink Chicagoland ,  Mr and Mrs Leahy. We used to be team mates for a weekly quiz night at an  urlLink Irish pub  in  urlLink Elmhurst  and haven't seen them in a year. I'm really looking forward to seeing them and also to seeing Ireland, albeit briefly. Neither Ms Pillsbury nor I have been there before and we don't really know what to expect, since all the unfortunate stereotypes are undoubtedly exaggerations. Mr Leahy is an Irishman himself; I think it's always more enjoyable when travelling abroad to have a native of that country as a sort of "tour guide" so you can see what life there is really like.  All in all, it's too short a visit, but we can't really afford to stay in hotels for any extendeed period, what with the poverty of having just been full-time students for a year. Nevertheless, it should be more interesting than the typical summer holiday that seems to be de rigueur for the average  urlLink Englishman : spend a fortnight getting alarmingly red on some  urlLink Spanish island  full of other English people and consuming vast quantities of (probably English) lager.  So I'll report back on Ireland after my return on Friday, and sometime I'll explain how I came to be in the position of having done an English teacher training course and looking for work in the  urlLink East Midlands .
