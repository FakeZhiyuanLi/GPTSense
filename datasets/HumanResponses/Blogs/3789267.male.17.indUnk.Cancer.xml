      The ever intimidating Michelle Martinovich has suffered what it seems to be throat infection, forcing her to be sidelined for at least a week.  The infection comes at a surprise for the darling blonde, who found herself unable to speak properly this morning.  The infection is due to cause problems for her upcoming solo production and will no doubt add to the stress level of performing under already immense pressure.  she is expected to continue work on her production at a light pace.

      After all the outrage that was of the 'c' grade given to the three drama girls, Miss Eraclides confronted Mrs Hille why is it that they were only awarded a 'c' for all they hard effort and work. It turn out that the mark given was based on a prediction and that only a small factor of class achievement was taken into account for the final semester grading.

      just an emergency update. just incease u guys dun hear from me ever again, it's probably because i've fallen victim of the  'asians out'  campaign going on around in perth...(i suspect it's lead by anna). No, this is serious. if u guys saw the news on saturday night on ABC, it was reported and shown that  'asians out'  were being written on police offices, buildings, and even post-box. so if i'm not able to be contacted, i've probably been bashed up, killed and my body got dumped sumwhere in the forest...likely, since i leave alexander lib at 6.45 each night after hard day studying, and the city is all closed and only the drunks are mostly out walking about, with the exception of friday night shopping.&nbsp;  I kno u guys are very worried about me,  but it's ok, i shall try to avoid becoming a victim.  and since u guys will all be checking up on me from now on  at  0422130319 , i should feel more at ease. so goodbye if i don't ever c u again, seriously.

Not one to shy away from the actions, Mr Lee has made a name for himself in the public eye through his various liasions, participation in academic competitions and graceful performances on the piano.

Tall in stature and flashy white pearls at show when smiling, this fun loving, jenny teasing guy has 'it' all.  2.Michael Bate - imperfections? What imperfections? The guy who has it all.

Combining soccer commitments and the pressure of school work, the beard loving seventeen year old is the object of attraction for school girls aranmore wide, and possibly more. Using his charm and innocent like approach to obtain his desires, 'big mikey' has admiration and accolades that most people would only wish for. Ever popular with others and always at the centre of attention, Michael Bate  definately does 'it', naturally.  1.Jade Willert - singing beauty Classy, sophisticated, and fabulously talented, Jade willert has a voice to be reckoned with.

      yes, 7 yr 12 human biology students were locked out of the room today and miss 10 minutes of the class for being late to class...including me! *everyone gasp*, yes i kno, me?!, well i don't kno about the others, but i was appauled by the lock out. i mean, i am after all a very busy student who is constantly in high demand and is very occupied with work. it's not like i was having lunch or got distracted chatting so that i came late into the class...no!, i was doing something of a higher standard and excitement than that! let me tell you, the only reason i was late was because i stole susan's masters choc and attempted to run to the boys toilet with it, only to be stopped by the smell of the toilet. horendous i tell you! and so i gave susan back her chocolate milk, even though i told her that i had been to the toilet with it... made her seem more thirsty to drink it actually...must've been a real turn on for her...n e way, so yeah as i was about to go to class, i saw rita sitting on the bench in front of the music room and was going to walk to class with her only to be held up by her offer to give me her lunch. i was hungry after all and couldn't refuse such an offer, and so i started eating while walking to the class and there, right at the corner of my eye, was the school's 'potential new couple' flirting and touching each other. and as my status is single, i was captivated by the beauty and love that these two people shared in front of mrs perry's chemistry class. so i stood there watching the couples as the wind blew and leaves fall from the trees unto the ground and drops of rain fall on my head. the n i realised that i have a class to go to and that it was kind a weird to stand there motionless while rita was hurrying me to climb the stairs. as i made it through and up the stairs, the door was shut on us who were late, and omg...we were made to stand in a line..the paiiin and forced to say an excuse! well excuse moi!...i was not happy...
