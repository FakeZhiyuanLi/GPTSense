       yey! we're engaged! it was in December 2003 when Richard proposed to me, but in a not so romantic way (teehee). he just popped the question and that's it! (madali akong kausap) hehhee...   what have we done so far:    picked a date      November 5, 2005   (Saturday) - it will be an afternoon ceremony so everyone will not be in a rush getting made up.   
  why we chose that date:      November is the month of my birthday  it's close to December (it's malamig! guests will not complain! hehehe)  5 is the day of our anniversary (so why not December 5? (since December 5 is our Anniversary date)... hmmm...ok... December kasi is a peak wedding month, mahirap magbook ng mga suppliers, traffic!!! and besides, our original plan is october, moving it to november is nakakainip na, how much more to December???? wala lang, u don't really care... hehehe...    picked a church    no hesitations. it will only be in Caleruega.  urlLink     
 
  urlLink  our church! the lovely Caleruega!   Posted by  urlLink Hello     booked a videographer    i thought it will be hard for me to convince my fiance to get Jason Magbanua, but i was wrong. The instant we finished watching Jason's video sampler, he said "let's get him" even if it's waaaaay out of our budget. Hi price is kinda steep, but everybody in  urlLink w@w  said he's worth it. So he better be! (hehehe)   picked a motiff      fruits, fruits, and fruits   theme! lotsa fruit colors, no one particular color in mind. i don't want it all "baby blue" or "pink" or what-have-you's. i'm thinking a table set up of a big wooden bowl with real fruits in it, flanked by candles and rose petals.    picked a cake artist    Alex Franco is very popular in  urlLink w@w  because of his all-edible 5 layer non-fondant cake. Since our theme is   fruits!fruits!fruits!  , our cake will be filled with what else, but fruits! yummy!  
 WHAT ELSE TO DO:    tell my parents about it   FORMALLY  !   hindi pa talaga namin nasasabi sa parents ko in a formal gusto-ko-sana-hingin-ang-kamay-ng-anak-nyo kind of way. i told them in the most awkward and unusual way over the phone (they are residing in Davao by the way):  
dad: kelan nyo ba kami papatikimin ng mainit na sabaw?   jenee: ammmm..... dad: wala pa ba kayo balak magpakasal ni richard?   jenee: ammm bata pa kami e   dad: so kelan nga?   jenee: ammm next year.....  
Richard was fuming mad (in a cute way) when he heard me told my dad about it. He wanted it to tell them himself kaso ang bagal nya e! hehehe.....
  ok so far that's what we have accomplished. we still have 438days to go.....      urlLink
