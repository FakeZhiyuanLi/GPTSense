       it was the holidays and technically all i did was stay at home and cover the hours of sleep that i lost before due to projects at work, papers and reports at school and the weekly gimmicks i had either with my friends or the love of my life. of course this was on the span of two days before and after the day people are still arguing if it's really the exact date of birth of Jesus Christ. i tried to watch a couple of movies but given the time and the perfectly snuggly position on the couch, i fall asleep at a rate faster than you can say supergolliefra.., what the heck, you know what i mean.   my routine for that short four days was to sleep the entire morning and afternoon away and then wake up in the evening to play mario world and where in time is carmen sandiego. afterwards id get sumthin to eat fresh out of the microwave (hmm, never tasted better) and then play trivia at MIRC. what a very exciting four days! (mind the sarcastic tone)

       when it's a workday, i normally wake up roughly at around 6:15. but today, since i didn't do the usual three rolls to the left, three rolls to the right, an almost fall off the bed, three twitches, a scratch on the head, and grinding of teeth, and a moan, i got to wake up 15 minutes earlier and eventually have time to turn on my CD player.   i was expecting a christmas jingle, but it gave me this. it was a bit sad, and probably the only thing that makes it a chirstmas song is the mention of the following in the lyrics: christmas, skating on a river, putting up reindeer and cutting down trees, pretty much found on the first stanza, other than that it's a very sad song. the version i was listening to was that of robert downey jr. from the ally mcbeal christmas ablum, but today i found out the original was from joni mitchell, a very very sad soul. oh well, see for urself...   River   it's coming on christmas, they're cutting down trees they're putting up reindeer, and singing songs of joy and peace... i, wish i had a river, i could skate away on...   you gotta admit that though it's sad, it's a bit catchy. ok next...   but it don't snow here, it stays pretty green i'll make a lot of money, then i'm gonna quit this crazy scene, oh i wish i had a river, i could skate away on...   (well i do wanna research on her life, but i don't want to waste 15 minutes, so if she's from the united states i'm betting that she's from california, or she wrote it there...)   i wish i had a river so long, i'll teach my feet to fly, i wish i had a river, i could skate away on, i made my baby cry...   now it just got more sad   you tried hard to help me, and you put me at ease and loved me so naughty it made me weak in the knees i wish i had a river, i could skate away on...   is she a frustrated figure skater? if som then  is she talking to her skating partner?   i'm so hard to handle, i'm selfish and i'm sad now i, lost the best baby that i ever had, oh i wish i had a river, i could skate away on...   oh wait, now i get it, i think she loved a figure skater... ok enough about song interpretations for the insane, i'm goin back to work...   next time:  i got into a discussion with a friend on my favorite actor Robert DeNiro, and the Godfather Trilogy, and why he didn't accept the Oscar. I'm gonna try to find that out. Also, a girl friend asked me,  What is it with men and the Godfather movie?

       i mentioned on my last post about the videos i have at home that are currently being ignored. well, not all of them are. during the weekend sandwiched by a fun-filled and embarassing christmas party at the office (our presentation was a bit embarassing but i got to go to the office the next workday without feeling like a dork) and another enjoyable dinner with my pals, i got to watch Lord of the Rings (FOTR and TTT, i thought it was a treat for myself coz i missed the premiere of ROTK, wahhhh!!!), remember the titans, power rangers the movie (yes, i think the pink ranger is cute too), and you've got mail, well at least the last 15 minutes of the movie (see guys, i can be pathetic too.) So i decided that for every movie that I'll watch, I will list down the line that made a big impact for me, whether it be emotional, or whatever. So here's the first batch...  "I wanted it to be you, I wanted it to be you so badly..." - Meg Ryan in You've Got Mail  "What is this, pick on a from day?" -Adam, the Black Ranger in Power Rangers the Movie  "First breakfast, yes, but what about second breakfast..." -I'm not sure if it's Merry or Pippin, from LOTR: FOTR  "You heard what I said, just toss me. But don't tell the elf..." -Gimli from LOTR: TTT *sorry, "my precious" is nowhere in the top 10  more next week...

       it's funny, i've always wanted to have my own website but i hardly even have enough time to watch the movies i buy... well now that Christmas season is here then maybe i will. I must admit that I am humbled because I've always wanted to create a website from scratch and not from the typical stuff you get over the internet, but until my work doesn't eat all of my time then this will have to do. oh well...

        time and time again i here a lot of my friends telling me that mathematicians are wierd, of course on a note they're referring to me and my way of looking at things in a "different perspective. why does it always seem that mathematicians take something easy and interpret it into something that's undeniably harder? they just don't understand, i guess. the funny thing to consider is that life itself cannot be quantified. mathematics along with a couple of other sciences try to approximate (or, put more simply, imitate) the phenomena that happen around us.  this must mean that mathematics is simpler than life itself. i mean, it may "look" complicated, but you might just have to look at math in a different perspective (yeah, a mathematical one other than the normal i-hate-math perspective, doh!)   the question regarding the expression 1+1. a mathematician will not answer this automatically, but in stead will throw a question back atcha (right, a question for a question. isn't that a relief!) "what number system are we talking about here?"  or "what field are we on?" or "what objects are we referring to?" ahh, to many questions for a simple problem. but the mathematician is just gathering information. i mean, in the binary system (a number system involving only 0 and 1 as digits,) 1+1 = 0 (ask any computer scientist!) also, 1 drop of water + another drop equals   ONE BIG DROP.   so, what's 1+1 again? and this is just arithmetic!  a little imagination may be needed here. suppose you're at a point  A  and you have to go to point  B . well of course you have to take a path, most likely a straight one coz it will be the nearest. consider going half the distance from A to B. when you're in there, move again towards the point between where ur standing and B, or half of the remaining distance. Do this continually and you'd find out that there will always be a half of the remaining distance that will be left, so u won't be able to get to B after all. isn't calculus beautiful? so what we're doing in the real world is approximating the distance? lol.  as i said, we need to look at it in a different perspective. a book i just read (A SEA OF TIME by ROB FRISBEE, shameless plug. you can get the book from the Darkhouse Books link!) gave the most beautiful interpretation of this expression. he called it the creation-equation.              1+1, Ben. That's all we have to go on. If someone adds up even for a moment, it makes our world a fuller place. i think that's the only truth out there that matters. and i think the only regret in life is letting one of those moments escape.    aww, isn't that touching?

         uhm, no, i'm not talking about the pathetic reality tv show. but in some way it's the same thing. well, without the fancy pad, challenges, and the two-week-long duration (  well Al, if you thought it was pathetic, then how come you know a lot about it?  ) Last saturday, Roosevelt College's high school batch of '97 (at least just our section) had it's 7th anniversary reunion. wow, it has been seven years...

       'twas january 20, 2004, just last tuesday, and i turned 23 that day. funny, coz my birthday's july 22. how it happened? well...     11:30AM.    i was at work, debugging the code from my latest project when i received an SMS message from a good friend during my days teaching in the university. he was gonna take a qualifying exam for texas instruments at 1:30 and will be done before the sun sets, and was hoping we coud get together. he mentioned that he will be with her girlfriend, and another x-teacher. of course i said yes. then it occurred to me, i have night class, dangit! so we decided to meet at school and leave after i submit my problem sets. crime no. 1 has occurred, i skipped class! but i was gonna meet a couple of people that i haven't seen for almost eight months, so it was cool.      5:00PM.    i gave them a call thati'll be leaving in 30 mins because i have to finish a lot of stuff. they demanded that i leave now for school. crime no. 2, i didn't finish my work load for the day!     6:00PM.   so i met with the guys, and decided to go to shakey's in katipunan for some pizza and beer. one of my classmates who is still teaching in the university i left decided not to go to class either and join us, making us 5. i agreed to pay for the bill and everyone was like, happy birthday dude!a few minutes after the busgirl came with ice cream while their cd player played happy birthday! damn! all five of us were laughing like crazy. just like that i'm 23, lol. crime no. 3. i lied!!!!!!!!! and on my birthday!!!! waaaahhh!!!!

       work started yesterday, and it was quite a shock for me. probably the reason why i'm blurtin out today. somehow, during the last two january's, i din't complain that much like that of the January's when i was still in College, HS and Grade School. i guess i'm getting more mature as time goes by, and i think that it's a good thing.   one of the great minds that ever existed in this world (a nifty phrase to pay tribute to the genius whose name i can't remember, hmm)  said, "Find a job that you like to do, and you will never have to work for the rest of your life." Well it's true, in a sense, in my experience. I started my exploits as a software developer just last July, a month before I resigned from the most noble job that I had and will probably ever have, a University mathematics and programming instructor, the job that really changed my view of educators forever.   the perks were good. everybody calling you sir (gotta love it!), fewer work hours (5 hours a day average, including lecture and consultation hours), meaning being able to relax most of the time, go to the gym, and a lot of other stuff, free tution for a master's degree (not that i need it but it's a perk as it is), no work when students don't go to school, like during summer and christmas vacation (technically, coz ur not in the office, but you can bring em at home!), and of course, as i said, it was a noble thing to do. Being able to work in the University where you went is the best thing that you can do if you want to return the favor, by helping mold the new minds today (mold, or destroy?).   of course there were downsides to it as well. checking examination papers and programming exercises at night was a horrible thing to do because of the possibility of dreaming (more of a nightmare actually) of it while you slumber, not to mention that sometimes you just get disappointed when the results are not favorable, and the fact that you never have enough time for them. at first i thought i would suck at it but eventually i accepted the fact that i could never be as good as others, but i can be good in my own special way (whoah?!)   the only thing that probably stopped me from doin it was: (1)travelling 150 kms at least thrice a week was a horror, and it was painful physically and mentally, (2) i wanted to test new waters, now that i've seen how the academe is, it's time to move to the industry, and finally (3) i just lost passion. i never lost hope in my students, i had for a second and third chance the students i flunked previously either once or twice, and they managed to pass on or before the third take without me giving them undeserved passing marks. that's why i left.   now i do miss it. if there was an opportunity for me to be able to teach somebody, i grab it. it's funny coz i still take time to watch those shows on TV that have lessons in algebra and trigonometry, and i've thought, so that's how i should've taught them. but there were no regrets of leaving. actually, regret is not in my dictionary, so it's all cool. i'm in a good job right now and it's all that matters. btw at lunch i got to go back to meet one of my HS teachers, and it was nice. i found out that she was still single, but it was ok, said her. it was funny coz she said that after telling her my plans of getting married either this year or next year.  she asked me why i left teaching and i said that my heart's not there anymore, thank goodness she understood, and i said that it was a lot of work. wow, so it's true. If you get a job you like, you wouldn't have to work anymore...

       i was watching a game show in the korean channel (they were conversing in english!) called Quiz Champion and it was their first episode for the year, thus the introduction that January came from the god Janus who is the god of beginnings and peace and other stuff i forgot to remember!the host remarked that like Janus, we all have been very busy preparing for the new year. Du-oh! i slept over the new year! And it appeared like it was a cardinal sin! (well, that's what my friends told me, coz i'll be doing that for the rest of the year, my god, what morons!) So God help me, as always, i'm preparing a list of things that i need to accomplish this year, so that i could mark them off as "recurring" next year!by the way, the recurring ones i marked with an *.  *1. jog at least three times a week! (i was able to jog an average of once per month last year, so it wasn't a total loss, i just have to wake up early, yikes!) *2. finish reading one nover a month (i can do one in two months, so this will be easy) 3. have lesser time for leisure and more time for studying (this wasnt a probem before, but since i'll be finishing my MS degree soon, i gotta make sacrifices, gulp!) 4. do 10+ sit-ups and 20+ push-ups a day! *5. limit my soda intake to 500ml/day. *6. really quit smoking! *7. limit alcohol intake! 8. run in a marathon! 9. learn how to dance (not the "lord of the dance" moves but sumthin not stupid while on the floor!)   now, so that it won't be a total "i have to do these things" article, i'm adding up the things i accomplished last year. it's lesser than the above list but it still gives me bragging rights, i think!  1. get a girlfriend (a serious one of cours, thanks tina!, luvyah!) 2. get in touch with old friends 3. get a new job that i like! 4. get out of the country (and be back, of course!)  am sleepy! is Sandman the god of sleep? or is there such a god?

       we're at it again...  seven whackos on an idiot game of chance.we were supposed to go to mumbai for the holidays, just to relax and see new places, experience different cultures, and (as tina told me) buy saris. we were set to go, but we were lacking one thing... (drumrolls) we don't have tickets (sound effects: weng...kwengkwengkweng.) so of course the best thing to do was to go to the airport and try our luck to buy tickets, but sadly we were there for two days and nuthin happened (yeah, like seven people will back out from their flights just like that!). so we decided to let go of our plans to get out of the country and just go somewhere to celebrate the coming year.   the frustrated writer (at ur service, both a frustrated writer and really frustrated by the incident) went home to get some sleep, but at 3AM  has been awakened by the unusual beep of his celfone to the tune of "bulaklak," (dang, i gotta chance my ringtone!) by a friend who said he scored tickets to sinapore which leaves in 5 hours. after a couple of murmurs and groans which sounded like "yes, i'll pack my stuff," i hung up the fone and went back to sleep as if nuthin happened.  thank goodness my friends know me more than i do, coz at 6AM they were knocking at my door asking me to get ready. and i was like, "i thought it was just a dream, i mean cmon, somebody calling u in the middle of the night saying that you're goin to singapore in a few hours, i must be looney!" then the crispiest curse that i've ever heard ringed on my head, as in "tarantado!" it was enough to get me out of my bed and into the shower while my friends pack up my stuff, a nice choice of articles of clothing and books (a black tanktop and cargo shorts, a long-sleeved shirt and jeans, plus 2 novels by ken follet, wow!)  and we were off to singapore! weehew!  it still felt like a dream. especially when we arrived at the airport at 7:20 and our flight was at 8, my goodness it was nasty!when we got there i was like, "so, this is it huh?" it wasn't much but at least i got to spend the holidays with my idiotic friends in a place which looks like a cleaner makati city. we spent three days there, and were planning on staying longer if not for the thought of being stranded there til kingdom come, but it was a blast. literally!

       Today I woke up with a bad tummy from the big bag of lays that I consumed all by myelf while watching the re-runs of primetime TV on cable. It was already 7AM, and a wake-up call from one of my buddies made me work my braincells of on a topic I didn't really like to ponder upon at the start of the day. O joy. so I left the house at 8:15, struggling to make it to work at 9AM while hailing every cab that tries to pass by me. after waiting for five minutes, I got one with a driver who started yapping and complaining about everything under the sun the moment i closed the door on the backseat. Usually i don't get to interact with them because it's either I'm on the fone calling someone, or I have a book that i'm reading. But since I wasn't practically doing anything but sitting down, I figured it would be better to talk to the driver instead of pondering on whether I would be able to make it to work in time or not. Here's what we were talking about:  "Pupuntahan mo yung daddy mo sa Citibank?"  asked the driver.  "hindi po, dun po ako nagwowork." "so dalawa kayo ng daddy mo na nagtatrabaho dun?"   i'm beginning to feel a little irritated but i'm trying my best to ignore it while responding:  "hindi po, nasa abroad po ang parents ko." "a ganun ba, sorry ha, mukha ka kasing disinuebe anyos"  Wow, this new haircut is working wonders on my age. Of course I wanted to fool around and tell him that I'm indeed 19, but I'm not in the mood to so I remarked,   "hindi po, 22 na po ako..." "bakit ayaw mo mag-abroad? bata ka pa naman pala, mas madaming pera dun." "tinatapos ko po kasi yung master's degree ko" "kayo talagang mga bata kayo, puro kayo aral. ang dapat nyo lang matutunan e kung pano kumita ng maraming pera!   At the back of mind I was like, well that's why I'm studying you dingbat, coz I want to earn more money. As I looked out the cab window I realized I was still somewhere in Boni Ave, dang, I still have a couple of minutes with this guy. Just makes you want to ride a bus. I'm never waking up late again!

       today i woke up with the promise of opening the CCNA study guide i borrowed from my officemate. and it was an issue i was willing to argue about with one of my friends. "just stick to programming, you're good at it. besides, networking is just a textbook thing" is what he said. doh! i for my rebuttal, i pointed out to him that it's just me trying to make a difference by learning stuff that i think will be handy later, you know, for work, because i'm on the MIS department of our company. then it hit me, here i go again trying to learn a new thing when i'm stuck with stuff to do like 4 more papers to finish for my master's degree, the project improvement of the IMS i'm developing for work, plus a couple of things. after that thought, i opened the book anyway. hey jack, u'r master of nuthin!

       today, being a tuesday, is one of the days where i try my socks off to get to work before 8AM, because i have night class and can't afford to miss any lessons anymore. now the only way to beat traffic is to ride a jeepney at Buendia instead of taking the bus straight to Ayala Ave, because, one, it's much faster, and two, it's nearer, opposed to the fact that i don't really enjoy riding a jeepney. funny thing, while i was getting money for the fare, i realized that my coins were one peso short, so i had to take out my wallet and notice that the smallest denomination i had was a 100-peso bill (and jeepfare costs only 4 pesos, right!) the driver, still pissed, returned the favor by giving change in coins! 18 5-peso and 6 1-peso coins. dang, and to think that i didn't bring a bag today...

        Al, you're a Politician!      Your personality is actually determined by two personality sub-types - your primary, or dominant sub-type, and your secondary sub-type. You are a Politician which means you are a Success / Golden Your primary sub-type is defined by "Success" characteristics and your secondary sub-type is defined by "Golden" characteristics.   That means you're forceful, innovative, and popular with the masses. Chances are you aggressively pursue your goals, and you enjoy impressing people. You've always been surrounded by friends and loved ones and have a natural sense of showmanship.  How do we know all this? How do we know that you're perfect for any work that requires personal interaction? How could we have divined that you would never say anything that offends anyone — at least to their face?  Because while you were taking the test, you answered four different types of questions — questions that measured confidence, apprehension, willingness to take risks, and your focus on experience versus appearance — the primary traits that determine your personality. Based on your responses, we determined your personality type, Politician.  And that's just scratching the surface.     this is what i got after taking the  ULTIMATE PERSONALITY TEST  from   emode.com . dang, can't I be a sky diver or a secret agent???

       it was already 4PM and i was hesitant to go to school yesterday, but i felt the need to go because i haven't attended class for three straight weeks already, well due to liesure and work conflicts (hey, what would you prioritize, huh?) so anyway i got to school at around 5:30PM, despite our class starting at 5PM, only to find out that the class was cancelled, dangit! next time i should trust my instincts more. so since it was still early, i decided to see brother bear.  so after buying the ticket and being in-line to buy some food, a woman barged out from the cinema and talked to probably her boyfriend who was in front of me, telling him that they were able to get seats for at the back row, however while they were going to get to the seats, two girls came in from the back and placed their bags on the seats they wanted, so they have to sit at the third row from the front. yikes! well, it's not my fault that i was able to eavesdrop on their conversation, i was bored in line waiting for my turn to order my food, and she talks loud. but i must say that i do feel sorry for them, and i felt sick of the people who did that to them. oh well.  now as i entered the cinema, i was able to find two available seats at the back row. so i took the seat and while i was watching the movie, i realized that one seat away from me were two girls with backpacks, so i safely deduced that those were the girls that i kinda hated for the misfortune of four other people. on the other hand those if not for them then maybe i would be sitting some place nearer to the cinema, so in a way i should be thankful. the moral lesson of the story, try not to eavesdrop on other people's conversations so as not to make life complicated!

(pardon the term for a lack of any appropriate word to describe the sensation i'm feeling right now) i'll be taking my civil service eligibility exam today and i need my rest. but apparently i'm still in front of the computer blabbering while playing trivia at MIRC. oh well...

       i'm wasted as usual, and i cried myself to sleep last night. my girlfriend hasn't called yet and i'm stuck at home. my friends have been buggin me all morning to leave the house and get some fresh air. i didn't feel like going out so i politely declined to their invitation. the next thing i know, adam came into my room with a pail of water and emptied it all on my bed. with freakin me on it.it was ok, i thought, my bed's all wet with tears anyway.  we decided to go to baguio, just so they would shut up, of course i gave them some serious whacking first. hey, maybe going out would be a good idea after all. besides, where would i sleep tonight?

        1. To deliver up to an enemy; to be a traitor to. 2. To prove faithless, to  to disappoint : to betray a trust   you know what's funny? how can a negative word like  betray  be a feeling induced by a loved-one? I mean, why do we feel betrayed whenever a loved-one tries to do say a certain something to you, but you wouldn't feel anything if a complete stranger would do exactly the same thing? why am i so freaking emotional now? can someone please whack me on the head or sumthin?

       American Idol 3 was officially over in my book when the person I'm pulling for to win, namely Matt Rogers, was booted off tonight. It was a bit wierd that I was able to relate to the guy and I thought that he did have a good voice. I hope the guy who looks like a  hobbit  wins, or maybe the girl who has red hair and sings power of love. Dang, first, Josh didn't win AM2 (no offense to Ruben, but I did like Kim Locke more than him) and now this. How depressing. At least the two hot filipinas are still in the show.  Menawhile, on camp Pearl Islands, a recap of the first 21 days. Reality TV this week sucked! I gotta grab a bottle of beer. Dayyynnnng!!!

       After revealing something I should've revealed months ago to my girlfriend, It is the first time that I've heard her use one-word sentences to answer my questions. My officemates mentioned that she probably still is in a state of shock, and I'm just waiting for the right time to ask her how she's doing. Man, why can't girls be more like guys that can say whatever is on their mind?

       An SMS message from an ex-UP teacher mentioned a tax refund that I can get, so I decided to pay my Alma Mater a visit, and collect it's dues. It would also be a good time to visit my old officemates and spend time with them, before going back to the toms of papers I need to finish. I spent two nights there and as I was leaving, I couldn't help but feel sad. I sure did miss that place, and the memories are still there. As I jumped in the bus on the way home, I banged my head three times on the railing of the chair in front of me, while asking myself why I ever considered resigning in the first place.

        I compare myself to a snail with regards to making relationships, may it be with acquaintances, friends, generally everyone I meet on a day-to-day basis.  You may see me as the mysterious, quiet guy who likes to be in the comfort of his shell, until I get at ease and start crawling out of it's protective zone into the unfamiliar surroundings. Well I guess there's nothing wrong with leaving your comfort zone, but the problem with me is that once I leave that shell, I tend to be careless. Meaning, when you sum it all up,  it's me who gets hurt badly.   They call it  emotional attachment . We are social animals by nature, depending on other people for things such as trust, encouragement and love. It's a simple equation if you ask me. The moment you start sharing yourself to others, you give them a piece of what you have. At the same time you build trust and become more comfortable with that person as probably a companion in some of the routines you do everyday, or a confidant for problems that you can't keep to yourself.   It's awkward that when you don't see that familiar face, you feel a bit empty. It's like, the taste of coffee just isn't the same without the talks that you have with your friend, or that the long walks seem like a waste of time without the one you love wasting that time with you. I mean, it's okay to attach yourself to people because, as they say, no man is an island, but  when should you stop , to avoid the hurt?   When should you stop sharing things to your confidants? Does the equation have to be balanced, meaning should the amount you share and the amount the other party shares be equal? Why does it hurt when the other party doesn't meet the expectations you set for them as friends or loved ones? Do you have to set expectations?  I compare myself to a snail with regards to making relationships. Day by day as I share myself to other people, I let myself succumb to the hurts that are waiting to attack my soft exterior. When the pain of a broken relationship sinks in, it's the same time that I crawl back to my shell, my stronghold, where I lick the wounds of betrayal.  I would feel strong, but somehow I feel that I lost part of me, a part that I won't be able to get back.

       i took a couple of tests found in the internet via  urlLink allthetests.com  , ansd here'se what i found out about myself.  1. my IQ is 137, and that i'm highly intelligent. ooh.   2. after taking the personality quiz, it remarked:  You are a real  soprano.  you got a bad temper and you demand respect. You understand the value of money and want the best of the best   3. i got 0 points on the metrosexual quiz, therefore i'm not metrosexual. it was a debate i had with one of my friends (and, coincidently, with an officemate), after saying that i don't dare to take time shopping, or sumthin like that. actually, i took the test without even trying to figure out what it means first, but i realized that i don't really have to know what it really means coz i'm not really one.  4. now, as i  ask myself if i have a malicious mind, this is what the test said:  With your 50 % you are: You're trying to be insane, malicious, whatever you wanna call it but you can only cut it as TOUGH, I'm afraid, but after reading this, if you feel like hunting me down and killing me, you're insane like me. But don't try it, I can kill you a million times before you can switch your pc off............*mwa ha ha* .  5. ok, now i'm asking some vain questions. after taking the "are you sexy" quiz, it said that i am pretty sexy, and with some work, i could be really good. There are some people sexier than i am, though. (damnit).  6. am i whacked?  .You are sort of whack! That's normal! Have fun with your doggy- woggy and scream "woo- hoo!"    7. and finally, i asked simon cowell if i can be the next american idol, and he said that he's heard better subway musicians that me. aww, that's gotta hurt.

       yesterday, me and an officemate ate at lydia's lechon for dinner. being the health buff that i am now (well, i'm trying to, and for starters i have to watch what i eat) i passed on the roast pig to order their second specialty which is called paella, a mix of fried rice, green peas, crabs, roast pig, hotdogs, pork barbecue and mussels on a big platter. i decided to order it because i was, kinda hungry and i never thought it would be that big of a plate, i mean, cmon, false advertising on what restaurants serve? to my surprise it was the same size, and i couldn't finish the plate.   my officemate, while laughing out loud, offered his "condolence" with the remark "maraming batang nagugutom sa pilipinas." i could only reply "tama na po, hindi na mauulit," sounding like a kid being spanked for doing something bad. "o ano, kakain ka pa ng paella sa lydia's lechon?" asked my officemate. again, i had to remark the same words. :o

       it's 12:53 AM and my tummy is growling because of the big bag of lays that i ate while watching a tagalog movie that i happened to like (btw it's entitled keka, highly recommended if you know tagalog.) hey wait a minute, wasn't that line used in one of my posts before? oh yes it was. dangit, i still haven't learned, apparently. i better stop munching on big bags of chips when i' watching movies. oh well, can you blame me? btw i'm still contemplating on the issue regarding the nationwide, uhm, PUV strike that will happen later on. in case you don't know what that means, well, vehicles won't be gracing the steets of the metro, well, not only on the metro (since it's supposed to be nationwide), and i'm not sure if there's work. oh well, whatever happens, i need to get my sleep. i'll think about that later in the morning when i wake up. for now, i gotta run somewhere and take a crap. booyah!  ps. there'll probably be more posts entitled "nonsense" from now on. it's gonna be like, well, what i'll call when i can't think of anything to sum up what i have written, which is most likely, well, nonsensical.

       Before goin out to drink, me and a workmate stopped by a home improvement center.  We feasted our eyes with some things that we wanted to buy, including this lazyboy with a massager, while thinking about living on a penthouse of a condominium and how we were gonna decorate it. Somehow it felt a bit wierd, coz I've never entered a home improvement shop with a friend before.

       Danny, one of my best friends dropped by earlier today, saying he'll be staying in Manila for a couple of days, which is really cool. I must admit that I am really happy to see an old friend after all that has happened for the past weeks. Danny has always been the sensitive guy who knows what to say at the right time, and thus a tribute is given to him here in my humble blog. To Danny, a true friend, a great companion.

       I have to admit that things at work weren't really looking up the way I wanted it to be. As the days pass, especially with the recent incident with my girlfriend, plus a couple of other stuff, I feel as though I want to quit the job I have and move to the United States, just to get away from it all. Today however, things here at work have gotten better (at least I hope so.) I presented my recently developed software application to a higher-up. Thankfully, she liked it and said that with a couple of adjustments, it would fit their needs. She then asked me why I wasn't a permanent employee yet. I explained everything and she said that hopefully come June 1, I'll get the permanent tenure that I deserved. She even suggested that I go through the selection board come afternoon so as to get it done with. Too bad it was already 6PM and everybody needed to go home, so I guess my interview will be done either next week or the week after. Wow, is this really happening?

       Last night, an SMS from a workmate while he was waiting for me on a sofa:  "Pare take your time"  plus a smiley. It took me more than twenty minutes to meet him where he was standing (or sitting.) He asked me how it was, and I told him  it was fine. In fact, it was too fine . It was so fine I wasn't able to go to work today. I did take my time. Now those three little words would have a whole different meaning.

       typical worknight, leave work before 8 and go to Glorietta to grab a bite to eat before goin home. sometimes a couple of bottles of beer so as to ensure a goodnight's sleep and a summary of the days events. well, tonight was no different, except for a rather funny incident.  after ordering a zinger from KFC, i pulled away from the counter to look for my workmate, hoping that he already found us a vacant table because it was a full house that night.i treid my best to squeeze my way into the flooding people going against me while trying to find my companion, but after two minutes of time without avail, i pulled out my celfone and dialled my workmate's number.   he answered to find out where i was, while trying to figure out his directions. by the time i got to the table, the call was still active and we looked stupid talking to each other over our celfones, wehen in fact we were just inches away. it was kinda okay, though,because the two ladies sitting next to us were, uhm, laughing like crazy. i remarked,  at least we were able to entertain a couple of ladies, hehehe.   good thing they weren't really that attractive, or else i wouldn't have the strength to stop myself from flirting again. i mean, cmon, you gotta admit that it was a good icebreaker! (right, hit on a woman who laughed at your expense)

       We now continue our coverage of Alec's journey to his IS Officer position come June 1. Last time, the final interview. Earlier today, and hopefully up to tomorrow only, the requirements.   Today, I decided not to go to work so I can take my medical examination. I was with two friends They volunteered to hold me while the nurses take blood from me using needles. It was too embarassing. Finally when the results came out, I felt a sigh of relief. The IS Officer position is as good as a few more spaces within my reach.   The only thing left is the tons of forms that I have to fill out, handwritten. Oh well, so close, yet so far.

       Well technically the interview with the President for the IS Officer position is tomorrow, however it was moved today, in the morning, where I was basically caught off-guard. It took like less than 5 minutes, the whole time I was sweating bullets, despite the airconditioning working perfectly. At last, it was done. And it's official. I just can't wait for June 1 to come. Now I have to finish my requirements. Oh, the dreaded medical examination.

       Ah, it's election time once again in the Republic of the Philippines. Yet another power struggle that I pretty much don't want my hands on. Not today, not in the past, and definitely not in the near future. (Yep, you guessed it, I'M NOT VOTING!!!) But I am kinda glad that it's a national holiday so I got a 3-day vacation from work. I never got to watch survivor's live feed, but I was able to know that Amber won the All-Stars version, and that Boston Rob proposed to her on the reunion show, which she accepted.   It was a bit disappointing for me because I wanted Boston Rob to win, well for a couple of reasons:  1. He was a great strategist. I mean, really. He did play the game exceptionally well. People may think that what he did was awful, but it's a game of deception, backstabbing and broken relationships. It's the nature of the game. Do everything you can to win the big money.  2. I also thought that Amber just basically rode on Rob's coattails. Geez, her only strategy was to flirt with Rob. But I gotta admit that she is cute. Too bad she's getting married :(  3. And finally, being the chauvinist that I am, of course I would want a guy to win the All-Stars. Too bad that's not gonna happen, unless another All-Star season comes in.   Well now that another conniving, cutthroat season of survivor has come to a close, I'll just have to wait for the 5th installment of the Amazing Race coming in on July. I just hope that this is not as disappointing as Flo winning in season 3 or the faggots winning the 4th one, or lese that'll be it for me and reality TV.   Just a thought, what if the five presidential candidates, instead of the normal elections, be marooned somewhere and play a game Survivor style? wouldn't that be nice, huh? Alec, out!

       It's just that it has been a very long day and I have a feeling that it won't be ending soon. Today, (well technically it was supposedly yesterday, bcoz it's way passed midnight, meaning it's another day, dang, you know what I mean, right?) the selection board convened to "interview" me, and you are now looking at the new Information Systems Officer effective June 1, woohoo!  Sadly, what happened tonight basically broke my heart. I'll just go vague on this coz I really don't want to make a big deal about it. I just hated the fact that I'm supposed to be happy, but instead because of some people who I consider friends, this night would be dreaded. This makes you even wonder who your real friends are. I hate being the emotional guy, but I guess I have to deal with this. It just sucks that you try to get out of your way just to make favors for people, but sadly the same people end up hurting you and they don't seem to care about it.

       Just tryin out the new default skins. This one really looks nice, don't you think so? The problem is, it can hold only a fraction of the entries I had before. Might as well, I'm getting tired of the old stuff anyway.

       A scence in one of our offices while I was troubleshooting a computer. My workmates in the department call it  answering a service call , but somehow I don't really like the sound of it, so I'll go as it is. This was when one of my co-employees started a conversation:  Employee 1:  Marunong ka rin pala nyan? Akala ko programmer ka?  Me        :  Medyo, pero nag-aaral lang din po ako mag-troubleshoot.          Employee 2:  All around yan! Ganyan talaga sa MIS.  Me        :  Ganyan po talaga ang buhay!          Employee 3:  New graduate ka ba?          Me        :  Hindi po!          Employee 3:  Last Year?          Me        :  Actually pagraduate na nga po ako ng Master's ko e.           Well, the conversation with the Employee 3 doesn't have anything to do with what I'm driving at, but it sure is nice to be mistaken for a new graduate. This has to mean that I look like 19, since I left college when I was 19. hehehehe. Hey! Who put the airconditioning at supercold?

       Blogging recently has not been exciting for me. I have been struggling to type at least something worthwhile in what seems to be a page of blacks and blues. But the so-called "writer's block" shouldn't be blamed by itself. I mean, there are lots of things to write about, seriously. But I am trying, for once, to refrain from making this blog the output of my state of being an emotional basketcase.   A song entitled "Don't Cry Out Loud" made me think. I really don't know who sang it, but Diana Degarmo sang it during the finale of American Idol 3, and it just clicked. Another song popularized by Diana during this season of AI is "I'm Still Standing" by Elton John. Somehow, that did fit too. So from now on, I'll try to do a balancing act. Lots of inner-self checking on my part, and again, patience, which I know I don't have. Of course it's worth a shot anyway.   Alec with a thick skin, now that's kinda new. Can I manage? Wait, I think the more important question is, will the people around me be able to manage it?

       Amazing race is coming on July 6, and rumors are that the teams passed by the Philippines. Dang, where the heck was I?  Initially I don't like any of the teams. Looks like nobody stands out. It's not like season 4 with the Clowns and the Gay couple standing out. Wait a minute, come to think of it, there's no gay couple in this season. I guess they got fed up with the Chip'n'Dales last season.   I'm buckling my seatbelt, I know it's been worth the wait.

       Today I parted with my palm pilot. It was a hard thing to do, but it was for the best.  Oh yeah, I do have one. I acquired it almost two years ago and it was good for keeping lectures while I was teaching in the University. But now, my celfone doubles as an organizer also, so I don't have any use for it, except the games. At least i know that it's in the hands of a person who can use it to the fullest potential (what kind of crap is this!)

       Oh, the long wait is over. I assumed the IS Officer position today. And guess what, no celebration. I'm at home in front of my computer typing in my blog. Yippee!  Well, it was kinda a choice I made. I wanted to be alone. Plus, something disappointing happened today. I'd rather not talk about it, I guess I'll just let this one pass. Maybe if I'll sleep over it, then I'll forget about it in the morning. Yweah, maybe.

       It's been  a week in, and 3 gym sessions have passed after my first compliment, saying that  my   tummy is getting smaller . Three days of hard work paid off. Somehow, my aching joints stopped aching for about 10 milliseconds. Hey, at least it did stop. And this is a person that doesn't know that I'm going to gym, mind you. Come to think of it, I have been silent about this. I'll save the bragging later when it takes full effect. Right now, the only thing I have to do is  not  get tired of working out, or the hefty sum I paid for it would be nothing but a faded memory, including my wanting to lose weight and tone my body.  As freebies for signing up, Gold's gym gave me an official tumbler and shirt, plus a cap to follow. Surprisingly, they gave me a  size S .  Then I thought,  when was the last time I wore a size S ? It went as far as sophomore high, I think. The shirt is orange in color and has the gym's logo near the bottom. I kinda like it, however I haven't tried it on. I kinda want the whole  I'm gonna lose weight  thing goin, so I'll probably wear it once my tummy looks  in shape . Now if that isn't motivation, I dunno what is...

       Ryan, one of my close friends, gave me a Star In A Million CD, yep, the filipino version of American Idol. My first impression was,  damn, buddy, do you think I'm jologs?  I wanted to throw it away the moment I get a chance to, however I ended up playing it. It was Ok, I thought. But it can never replace the American Idol 3 Soul Classics album that I have near my component.

       The blogger turned a year old today. And as always, I try to look back at the year that just passed and see if there is any improvement. Sadly, everytime I do this, I fall asleep, even before I figure one out. Today is no exception, so I figured I should try again next year. ;)  On a lighter note, a look on today's events is appropriate. Nuthin special, the usual 12MN -3AM is busy with calls from friends greeting me a happy birthday, and as always I try to answer all of em. A call from my parents during lunchtime while I was having lunch with my workmates. Nuthin unusual except I used to hear something like "Happy Birthday, hope your well." This year however it was something like "Happy Birthday, don't drink too much, stop exhausting yourself from work..."  Today is a double celebration BTW, besides my birthday, it's my "I'm thankful for the promotion thingie" so a feast was in order at work, well, it was just a small one. Everybody was like, "You're just 23? wow. I can't believe you're that young..." Yeah. I thought, me either. Then a department meeting. Then dinner with a friend. Part of the discussion went to marriage, which I figured later was a bit scary. In between well-wishers greeting me for a good year, parents telling me to stay low on the booze, and finding a better half, I can't help but want a break from all of this. This is too much, I thought. And to think that I still have work tomorrow.  Footnote:  Blog antidated to my exact birthdate and time.

       Today has gotta be the happiest day for the MIS department of our corporation. Wait, lemme rephrase that... Today is the start of our better days, wooohooo!!! Before I sound crazy or cynical, the reason behind our celebration is that finally, our IT Committee, which basically in a more practical sense fried us alive everytime the meeting came to order, is now DISSOLVED. That's right, no more IT Comm, as per an office order prepared by oneof my workmates, and upon recommendation of the CEO of the corporation.  Just a footnote, while my workmate was preparing the office order, we were figuring out another word to replace DISSOLVED. I wanted to use INCINERATED, however we really didn't want to sound mean about it, inasmuch being ecstatic, duh! I guess we'll be singing "Happy" again. No more IT COMM. No more IT COMM. No more IT COMM. No more IT COMM. No more IT COMM. Can I say that again? Well, I guess nobody will stop me so...  No more IT COMM. No more IT COMM. No more IT COMM. No more IT COMM. No more IT COMM. No more IT COMM. No more IT COMM. No more IT COMM. No more IT COMM. No more IT COMM. No more IT COMM. No more IT COMM. No more IT COMM. No more IT COMM. No more IT COMM. No more IT COMM.

No more IT COMM. No more IT COMM. No more IT COMM. No more IT COMM. No more IT COMM. No more IT COMM. No more IT COMM. No more IT COMM. No more IT COMM. No more IT COMM.  Ok, i'll stop now!!!

       Friday night at Padi's Point Cubao. After downing a couple of bottles, a friend refered to the ladies dancing in front of the live band as "bottles of beverage." He called one a  cervesa negra  because of the obviously dark complexion, and  1.5 Liter Coke  to a fat-assed girl,   just to name a few. I for one wasn't able to make a comment, because I was lauging so hard.  Dancing bottles, now that would be something nice to write about...

       Today, the choice was, go to work or watch the UAAP. What, work on a saturday? Of course you know what my choice was. So there we were, reminiscing the college times. IT was all good, except for the fact that we lost more than 20 points. I was so disappointed I wished I just went to work.

       July 6 - 7, 2004 was team building day for the corporation. I, for one, tried my best to be one with its goal (hey! you gotta give me credit for trying, huh!) I really coudn't say that I liked everything about it, but I guess when you sum it all up, the positive definitely outweighed the negative ones. The highlights of the event were:  1. Meeting other people in the corporation. It's funny that I see them more than once every week for the past eleven or less months, but it's only now that I got to know some of them. I realized that my world doesn't have to evolve around a certain circle.  2. The team challenges were Ok, and me being a tenacious competitor was shown in a lot of occassions.   3. There was this farewell thing when eaveryone was given white of yellow candles. We were asked to give the white candles to people who we want to say  thank you  too, while the yellow candles were given to people who we want to say  i'm sorry  to. I was a bit surprised, coz I got a lot of candles, nothing that I ever expected. I hafta admit that after all that's happened, I felt special. Plus, it made me feel that I am part of the family. At last!

       It has been one month in the new job, so I think an update on how I'm doing should be proper. So far, except for a few "TEAM" issues, everything's working out fine. Of course it's still too early to make assumptions for long-term, but pretty much, at this rate, I'm okay, surprisingly. There's too much to say, however I'm pressed for time. I have to go somwhere far tomorrow but I haven't packed my bags yet.

       Just when we thought that UP was gonna get it's first every win for UAAP season 67,  WE FREAKIN LOST AGAIN, by 1 FREAKIN POINT!!!! And to think that UP was commanding a big lead all throughout the game against DLSU,  the archers got the lead for the first time when the clock timed less than three minutes left in the quarter. It was a disappointing loss.  It was more sad coz I kinda thought that something like this might happen.
