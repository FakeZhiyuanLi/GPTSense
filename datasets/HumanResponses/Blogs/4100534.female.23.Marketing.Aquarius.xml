      OK, ok......yeah. Broke it off with  "Johnny V" (doesn't that sound like an Italian Superhero?Sorry, not making fun, I just always thought that). Yeah, the end result went ok, I mean,  don't worry  everyone we can all still hang out together....at least I think. It ended up better than expected, I would rather not get into gory details on the Internet (but yes, girls, we will have a dinner date to discuss soon). I am not jumping into another serious relationship with Kris right away as I am sure some are wondering. He and I talked this past weekend and are taking things one day at a time. There is definitely some unresolved shit that I need to resolve in order to get on with my life, and that life might or might not include him. On to better topics....like what are we doing this weekend? I need to go out and go dancing. I heard Ryan Evans was the life of the party this weekend and I have yet to see him (or a lot of people for that matter) in rare form. To Jim and Tocco, I am so sorry guys...my phone was roaming while I was in Michigan and I didn't see that you called/get the voicemails until it was too late. I promise, I will come visit you guys in the  D . We will make a weekend out of it....and I will get some more pictures of my friends up here so you can all drool (Tina, Kim, and all of the other ladies that are reading this, my guy friends have been very interested in seeing the mature, cosmopolitan women that I hang around with in the big city....shall we show them the pictures of us slightly or completely wasted, because those are the majority of the pictures that I am aware of! :)  ) OK, enough for now, hope everyone had a good weekend and can't wait for the upcoming!

      So today at work was a little odd....there is this new guy name Thomas who started not too long ago....very ghetto, has a problem that Tina especially would hate, and is about 4'0" and used to date a crackwhore with a daughter. Anyways, when I met him, he seemed like a nice enough person....no one I would ever be interested in, but a decent person to talk to. So somehow he got my number and called me last night while I was watching (sleeping through) Kill Bill 2. I didn't call him back, but at work the next day somehow this bitch (let's call her MB) found out that he called me. Apparently, she shared a night of magic with him a week ago and he told her he wasn't interested in dating anyone....so she liked him even more. She came up to me at work today and freaked out, like I was interested in this dude. She threatened to go tell him that he wasn't my type and that I wasn't interested. Threatened? Try made my day. Anyways, he found out what she said, yada yada yada........the whole office knew by the end of the day and he asked me to step outside the office kindergarden-style to explain to me that he wasn't ready for a relationship. What the fuck?!?!?!!?!? Sometimes you just gotta be mean (or shut the hell up and ignore everyone around you that is going insane).

      Well, if you are reading this you need to sign the contract stating that you can't be pissed off about what you find on here.....Here was my day thus far: wake up at noon. make mac and cheese. consume whole box while watching part of billy madison. realize that i am still drunk and shouldn't be allowed out of my room so i go back in to hybernate until getting up again at five. listen to the four voicemails, one of which is from my parents hoping i am still alive. another from my ex-boyfriend inquiring as to my grandmother's health- v. nice of him. other voicemails not relevant. try to decide what in the hell i am doing with my life and where i am going wrong. decide that that is too much work for a  sunday afternoon and too much thinking for a brain that was almost paralyzed by alcohol last night. OK here is the drama for the day: So last night I was about to go meet John at the bar. My apartment, for those of you who aren't aware, is not in the best neighborhood....my neighborhood doesn't deserve the prefix of neighbor, so we will just refer to it as the 'hood. I crossed the street to catch a cab.....ok, I am lying there. I didn't have enough money for a cab so I was waiting for the North Avenue bus. On my left, a crack whore. On my right, a bum who was muttering about "the war" to himself. Deep breath. Black Escalade circles once, I get a few hollas. Black Escalade circles twice, I actually get words directed towards me. Third time, the Escalade pulls up on a side street and four large men open the doors and tell me to get into the car. I freak out and  got luck- the bus pulls up just as their doors are opening. Although it wasn't a stop, the very nice bus driver lets me in. So, getting mistaken for a hooker and almost getting snatched from the sidewalk is definitely the way to start out a night. Get to the bar, slam a few drinks (for medicinal purposes only) and spot my recruiter from the dub. Chat with him for a while about why I was a complete failure. John enters the scene and insults him with only a few words out of his mouth. Amazing, do I ever know how to pick 'em.
