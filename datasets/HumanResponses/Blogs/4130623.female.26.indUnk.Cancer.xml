        Hmmmmm... Where to start?  Well, where, what, and how do you eat? Have you always done it that way? Are you offended by those who do it differently? Did your parents do it the same? Do your friends and Family support the way you do it? Have you ever been asked to leave because of how you do it? Has someone ever asked you to hide the way you do it? Have you been mocked at or stared at? Has anyone ever looked at you with hatred because of how you do it?  My daughter has, she is 8 Months old. She nurses, I nurse her. Nursing? We Breast Feed together. I am giving my child the one thing that I know I can't get wrong and the one thing that only I can give her, "Mother's Gold." Yet people shake their heads, roll their eyes and say rude comments just "quiet" enough for you to hear them.  We are not obvious. I do not take my shirt off or expose my entire breast. I simply allow my child to nurse when, where, and however she would like to. Mother's have been nursing their children for as long as there has been mankind, only in the last 100 years or so have mother's given their infants milk other than their own. In the late 1800s a man named Nestle invented a nutritional "formula" to feed a premature baby who was unable to nurse with its mother. Formula was never intended to be an alternative to mother's milk.  American's drool over Breasts all the time. They are a power seller... Not only do they help sell anything from cars to ice cream to body wash but now you can buy them if you are not happy with your size or even your wife's size. Yet, an infant feeding is offensive and "disgusting" in many people's eyes.       Beauty, a woman in nothing but a bikini made of a little more than dental floss or a developing relationship of a mother and child while nursing, quietly and peacefully?       Only an American would have to actually stop and think about it before answering.        Well I need to stop my thought here, my daughter wants to nurse .
