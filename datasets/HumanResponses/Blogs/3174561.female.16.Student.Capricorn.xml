      3 months today... still, sometimes, it doesn't seem real.. but then theres the times when i'll be flipping through old photo album, hear an old song, go to our old church, go on a hike to a place we use to go...and all these memories flash to me from when i was little.. i had my boys growing up - my brothers who i will never forget, thats why im closer & get along better w/ guys - thats pretty much all i had as a kid & now even.. with the exception of one gal -  my megs    this girl was the first friend that i had - that was a girl! it was awesome! we would play in the sandbox, run all around church, go for hikes w/ our moms, laugh, make up silly adventures, just be wild, carefree, not worrying about anything! -- man, do i miss those days or what! but what strikes me sad, isn't only the fact that i can't go back to those days, but that i can't go back to you megs...we use to talk about our weddings and the types of boys we would marry & We'd live in the same neighbor & raise our kids together and all that jazz... that seems so faint and distant..and it hurts to think of it.. sometimes i just smile remembering..but sometimes, meg, sometimes.. i break down & cry.. i know things don't always go as planned..but megs, i miss you.. i really miss you... when you moved away that was hard enough..but now your gone forever... what am i suppose to do without you at the big events and big times...college!! i mean we were gonna go to college together & re-connect :-( megs you duno how much i wish that could happen.. i know one day we will be together again but at the time it seems so far away.. i wish i could see you & tell you everything thats going on in my life.. just talk & laugh & Dream with you... you always told me to believe in my dreams, they would take me far & as long as i kept believing - i could make them happen -- so thats what im doin' megs.. i'm goin' for my dreams - im living my life up to its fullest -- im trying to my best at least - im doin' this for you... God needed you and took you away from me..i dont really know why..and it was sooo unexpected.. i mean, these things happen..but why.. why you.. so full of life.. such a zest..such a love.. for everything -- even though the past few years i didn't know all your friends personally, i knew them through letters and e-mails and such.. and i know you touched so many people's lives..megs.. i just miss you sooo much - live it up, up there - its truely the beginning of a great new life..watch over me.. my angel - i love you meghan
