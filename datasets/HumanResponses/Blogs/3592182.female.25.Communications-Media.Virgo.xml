      With the help of my dad, who works in the mortgage loan industry, we are  finally in the market for our first house! Bob, Bits and I went out today searching for the most perfect house for the  cheapest price possible. I think we succeeded...Now we just wait to hear if  the seller thinks we deserve our chunk of the American Dream! Keep your fingers crossed!

      I never realized how boring I am until I started this blog. I really just work and take care of the baby. I'm not out having these ultracool times, though, I do enjoy my little bug-a-boo, who by the way is on the verge of learning how to flip herself over...very exciting! Up here we are in the midst of wildfire season, but I am hoping to not have any wildfire stories at all. That is really not something I want. So far so good, knock wood, no fires have gotten anywhere near to where we live. Nothing really exciting happens to me...at least, not this week! Two very exciting baby developments, she started to laugh out loud, really really laugh. And she is also somehow able to scoot all around in her crib now. I found her upside down, feet where her head should be, this morning. She was just sleeping, like it was nothing. I was truly amazed. Oh, and she also grabs at her toy bars now. She grabs a hold of a toy and tries to pull it to her. She also has started grabbing her toes! So cute. I am very boring, the baby, very exciting!

      In my latest attempt to drop the baby weight, and there have been MANY, I got myself a Gazelle. It's that glider with the infomercials starring the midget version of Michael Bolton...blond ponytail and all! I just got it yesterday and used it for the first time today. I think I might actually lose weight using this thing. It was fun to use and so quiet, I really COULD exercise on it while the baby napped (just like the infomercial said!) I do feel sort of lame for having bought Midget Michael Bolton's product, thus putting money in his pocket and validating his poor style choices, but hopefully the thing will help me stop being a whale. :)

      I guess I am lucky. My three-month old baby girl sleeps "through the night" from around 9 p.m. to about 5 or 6 a.m. with only minor fussing in between. But that still means I am getting up every day at 5 in the morning. Not cool. I developed a problem with insomnia during college, or maybe my body just adjusted to a customary 6 hours sleep a night. Either way, unless I am so tired my eyes are shutting themselves, it is sometimes hard to fall asleep...which I guess is why the baby is sleeping now and I am not, even though I really really want to and should be. This is pretty much a daily thing. I'll stay up and try to read a book, until my husband gets up for work and practically carries me back to bed. I suppose waking up at 5 a.m. wouldn't be that bad if I didn't stay up until 10 or 11 at night. It's like I'm still living college hours, but I am too old and busted to keep up with myself. Sad. And I'm only 25!

      Apparently, July is bear season up here in Northeastern Arizona. We had a reported bear attack up here last week (See news story here) http://www.wmicentral.com/site/news.cfm?newsid=12313336&BRD=2264&PAG=461&dept_id=505965&rfi=6 During this attack the bear chased a gal across through a barbed wire fence and onto a roadway where she flagged down a pickup and jumped in the back, the bear still in pursuit...When she tried to get into the cab of the truck, the bear attacked her again. Yikes. Then last Saturday my husband's uncle saw a bear in the parking lot of the newspaper offices. At the time, it was still light out and our offices are right on the main road. So basically this bear wasn't scared of cars at all. Eventually that bear crossed the heavily trafficked main road, perhaps en route to a mauling? My husband says if I want to see bears we can just go into the woods just behind our house. "There are tons of bears out there," he said. Yeah, that's OK. My father-in-law takes walks in those woods almost every night, but he takes a dog and a sidearm. The only time I have ever even come near a bear was 10 years ago in Kings Canyon when a baby bear was prowling our campsites...and that time I never actually SAW the bear...I think I'm cool with never seeing one here either.

      It's only July and I am already sick of dealing with Snowbirds. Snowbirds? Cocaine-crazed sparrows? No. Snowbirds are people, usually from Phoenix or Tucson, who only come up to Show Low in the summer to escape the stifling, life-sucking heat of the Valley of the Sun. On one hand, I can't blame them. When your weekly forecast looks like blood pressure readings, it's hard to hang tight and run the risk of melting. Most of the snowbirds we get up here are old people, who obviously are more sensitive to blood boiling temperatures. For the most part this influx of old rich people is great. It boosts the local economy for one, which is not undesirable. However, this town, this whole area, is basically a main street town. There are TWO main streets and they intersect, ok. Not a lot of side routes around town, you are on these two streets all the time. During the spring and fall, it's great. No traffic, no snowbirds, no snow. Winter, eh, snow sucks. I've slid off the road a few times and came damn close more than a few times. This is my first summer here, my first real experience with the Snowbirds. They double the population up here for these three warm months, and though I am assured that they burn tracks out of town at the first hint of a chill, I cannot wait, and here's why. On no less than three occasions YESTERDAY did an old, blind bat of a snowbird try to kill me with his or her giant vehicle. Whether huge towncar cutting me off in the Walmart parking lot, huge monster truck trying to run me over at the pizza place (she incidentally, later scaled a curb and drove through a small planter!) or some ass from Phoenix trying to enter the parking lot at The Independent through the exit drive, thus attempting to plow through me, my daughter and my newly re-shod Mazda, I simply cannot continue to live in fear of their tendencies toward vehicular recklessness. I went through and counted all the Phoenix and Tucson dealer license plate holders at Walmart the other day, more than half the cars were out of area, and 75 percent of those were cars that cost more than or almost as much as my HOUSE! Fucking Escalades. I can't wait for September.

      I love samples. I love getting them, I love using them. I love samples. It's like that free taste of cheese at the deli counter, delicious and dangerous, almost like stealing. I mean, who only takes one beautifully toothpicked chunk of Colby? Noone. Occasionally, the samples I get lead to full-sized purchases. That is how I found and fell in love with my favorite shampoo, Fructisse, with fruitanicals. After a brief flirtation with Brilliant Brunette, I am back to the 'Tisse. A sample also brought me to the world of Desitin Creamy, for the Bits of course. It's a wonderful product. If you have the means, I highly recommend picking one up. It is so choice (nod wink Eleeza) But most recently, my sample addled life was blessed...touched by the sample angel. This particular bit of joy was sitting in my cabinet, unopened, since I had Bits, almost four months ago. When we went to Utah for vacation I brought sample sizes of everything. Pack light! And I grabbed this wonderful sample on a whim. The fabulous sample in question, Arm and Hammer toothpaste...It sounds gross, but my lord. What a rush! As soon as we got back to Arizona, I bought a full sized tube, perhaps the quickest sample to full turnaround on record. I realize I am lame, what a silly thing to write about. And it leads me to this...I always wonder with all the Spam out there, who actually buys those penis enlarging, true mate finding, hot sexxy asian sluts products? And now I realize, my samples are someone else's spam, my treasure, their trash, my Arm and Hammer, their horny lesbo teens etc etc. And oh, what a crazy mixed up world  :)
