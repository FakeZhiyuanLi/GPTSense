      Hi dad. How are you? I am sad because I think everybody hates me, wants to punch me and stuff like that! I feel like I want to kill them!?!?  I had a fun birthday party! the boys wanted to play soccer. Johannes and I played Super Smash Bros Melee and Johannes and I were Link. Torstein played The bouncer.  Love Ulie

      Happy Birthday to you!!! Happy Birthday to you!!! Happy Birthday my son!!! Happy Birthday to you!!!  Well, I had hoped to be able to talk to you on your birthday but unfortunately that did not happen. I hope that you're having a good time turning 11 years old. I have missed 2 of your birthdays now, and I am really sorry for that. I know you must be getting tired of hearing that. But if everything goes well, I should not miss your next one.  I had to send my car to the shop today because it needs new hoses. The car is a bit old and it needs a few new things, but it's in great shape. it looks just like the picture above.  Grampa Gedo(is that how you spell it?) sends his love, since he couldnt send you a card because his computer is piece of crap, so he asked me to tell you happy birthday too.  I will be working this weekend so if you want to call me, Sunday morning here would be best. Ill be at work at 11 am so plan acordingly ok?  Once again i hope you have a good day celebrating your big bad 11 year old birthday!  Lots of love, hugs and kisses from you father.

      Hello there!!! Thank You for the father's day note. It is good to know that you're making more friends now, even if they used to be bullies. That's a lot of friends you have now and I am happy for you.  Unfortunately I spent father's day working and it was very boring, so we sat here and talked about our kids and now everyone knows about you, what you look like and all kinds of stuff. The receptionist, Lois, thinks that you're so adorable because you look like me!  Oh and by the way, I don't have a favorite show right now, because I don't watch that much TV. But out of the stuff I do watch I like to watch I love the 80's on VH1. Just so you know.  I'll post again later ok? This week I'm only off on Thursday so you can call me at work if you like. I will talk to you later.  Love, Dad.

      Happy Fathers Day Dad! I hope you have a good Fathers Day!!   Guess what, I am not friends with Anders anymore. Why do you ask? Because he wants to play alone with me. I now have more friends. Some were the bullies from before. We have become friends, but Anders hasn't become friends with them and dosen't want me to play with them, only him. My new friends are: [Skule, Alexander, Tobias, Johannes, Daniel, Torstein, Andreas, Sebastian and Kristian] that`s a lot!! :)  You never told me what your favorite show is.  Love Ulie

      Hi Dad, how are you? I`m fine. My birthday is coming in 6 days but Sebastians birthday is in 3 days. Isn't that weird?  I`ve been sick for 2 days. Mom let me stay home from school and let me play some games. That was nice of her since I had been grounded from them.   Yesterday after John Ivan came home from work, we went to town. Mom wanted to buy yarn so I was SOOO BORED!!! After that we went up to some friends of moms. Jim and Hans. They are re-modleing their house and while mom and John Ivan looked around the house I played with the ferret. They have 2 ferrets just Ender was sick so I only got to play with Molder                                   well that`s all I want to say.                                        love Ulises              ¤ ¤                                                                                   U

      Hey there Dad,  How are you? I'm fine.  :) How is your day? I had a good day. Mom is helping me with this blog thing. Do you like the way it looks so far? I really like the Pokemon cards and bionicles that you gave me.  Those bionicles that you gave me, I had bought 6 of them for Anders' birthday instead of the big ones. If I buy those big ones, I could only get 2 of them. Cool huh?  I wish you can send me the other 2 that goes with the 4 you sent. I am now missing fire and grass. Well it is almost my bed time. I love you Dad! Ulie

         urlLink be sorted  @  urlLink nimbo.net   &nbsp;   Congratulations on making Gryffindor!    Basically, you're brave, daring, chivalrous, and pretty much.. an all around good person. Of course, some see you as a goodie-two-shoes. But hey, it's true! You're really good at winning, and normally always come out as the hero. Everybody likes you.. except, maybe, the Slytherins. You're too perfect. No, really.. You're too perfect. It's annoying to watch you win, repeatedly. Oh well. Be proud anyway
