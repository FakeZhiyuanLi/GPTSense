       Hey GUys sorry I am a bit behind.... Uh Let me try to remember what happened on Tuesday... Oh yes, Me, Rachel, Haley, Jenny and Christina got up and biked to the pool and met Corey, jordan and Braden there.&nbsp; We went over to the slides but I wasn't "in the mood" to go down and they were all giving me grief about me not going... then we went over by the diving boards and once again I wasn't "in the mood" to go off, but itwas&nbsp; funny because when tina went off the diving board she lost 15 bucks and a hottie lifgaurd had to go in and get and stop everyone from diving, it was funny. then we biked over to townsquare and walked in stores around there. Then we all went home, and we were all sopposed to go to craigs but me and rachel went to Coreys instead and watched Legally Blonde 2 and Dumb and Dumber... And me and rachel are still having depantcing war and she pulled my shorts down to my feet but luckally I was standing behind the bar so no one saw or else I woulda killed her!!

       Alrighty so yeah Me, Rachel, and Jordan went over to Coreys house and when we got there we listened to jordan play the one song he knew on the piano then went in the basement and played ping-pong and it was nasty because corey had like an insect farm living in his basement.. no joke it was like a spider and rollypolly reunion of some sort except like they were all dead... some reunion eh?Okay yeah but then we watched 6 Sense or whatever and it wasn't as scary as the first 3 times I saw it but ghosts still freak me out and the girl throwing up is nasty (lol j*C*R) but yeah then my mom picked me and rachel up and we went came home and cory (my brother not... thonn) had like 3 friends over and they were having abonfire in my massive backyard (which is very scary at night I might say) so rachel and I decide to join them and then my nerd herd family comes out too (besides Kyle who doesn't find it neccisary to ever be home)  so it was a big ole party. But then me and rach were sick of hearing my dads stories from the old days lol and we spelled of smoke so we decided we both needed to take showers... so I take my shower, then little rachel takes hers but when she gets out she sets off our smoke alarm from the heat which was funny then I was downstairs on the computer and my dad goes in my room to turn my light off because he thought we were both downstairs but dear rachel is definently changing.. lol but yeah were sleeping in a tent and I will continue later with whatever stories there is to tell about our fun-filled evening.

       Okay.. so this morning I woke up around 11, because were babysitting this annoying dog and it kept barking, yeah but then my mom made me clean my room which sucked because it looked like a tornado went through it, but i lived through it. Then around 1 me and rachel biked to Mcdonalds and ate lunch, then went to tgmaxx and were bra shopping which was quite depressing. but I was gunna put 4 on hold for my mom to pick up later so we went over to the cashier people and it just turned out that of them were males so I felt a bit stupid holding a bunch of bras so we went to the oldest guy who turned out could barely speak english and was missing his front tooth and me and rach had no clue what he was saying but somehow figured out that he was telling us to go the back and put it on hold so we went back there and waited in like for like 10 min then finally when it was my turn the guy told me to go to the front to put the bras on hold! So we walk all the way back to the front and go to a different guy who would be able to speak english but the guy had no clue what he was doing so he was like "uh huh?" .."uh you want me to uhh put these uh on hold?" and was like braindead but finally he figured out how to put them on hold so then our day was brightened... sorda. Yeah but then we went to Maurices and put a bunch of other crap on hold and this lady was my hero and actually spoke english and knew what she was doing.. what a great combination. Then we went to Old Navy and found a bunch of other crap we liked and waited in line for like 5 min just to find out that they didn't have a "holding policy" how gay are they! Wouldn't you think they'd want you to buy there merchandise?!? Anyways then me and rach biked home to get our moms to take us and buy all the stuff we put on hold. I  nearly got ran over , i swear my life flashed before me! lol. Yeah but then just to add to my frusterating day on the bike ride home I see my mom driving by and I yell to her but she doesn't get it and is just waving and smiling.. so I bike home and call her on her cell to see if she'll come get me and pick up my stuff but of coarse she forgot to bring it and i can hear it ringing from one of her other purses.. so now i prob never get all the crap I spent my summer day picking out because tonight I am going to Coreys , tomorrow were gunna be at my grandmas and the rest of the week shes got work... just my lucky day , eh?

       Okay yeah so I said before we were going to rachels but it only ended up being me, corey and jordan there, but it was still fun.. We watched How to Lose a guy in ten days which is a great movie , even though I've seen it a bunch a times i swear it gets funnier each time. But yeah then we watched Sha Shank Redemption and then I went home.. yup.

       Okay.. Today was quite an adventure at first when we all woke up and the weather was crappy we didn't know what we should do.. but then tina called me and told me her 9 year old brother was having a bday party at laser quest and me and rach could go. We were thrilled lol. So on the way there it was hilariuous listening to christinas family I swear it should be a sitcom, her younger sibs and her crack me up. Yeah but anyways once we got there it was a ton of fun andwe were getting so into and it was funny because theres like a bunch of little kids and three older girls and by the second game all the little kids were swarming us screaming "get the teenagers" It was funny and christina has a freaking phycotic cousin who threatened to throw a plate of pizza at me, just because i said I did better then him lol I don't do well with the younger tikes.. lol but yeah then the party was over and I had to sit in the back seat with Lukas (tinas lil brother) and micheal his friend. and lukas kept telling mrs.rojas that I was hitting him and was fake crying and everyone was "believeing" him and fake yelling at me it was great. But ya then we got back to tinas and wrote in chalk in her drive way "happy bday lukas" (actually tina accidently wrote "Lukay") Then we played a little volleyball and then me and rachel biked home and now I am on my way to rachels house with tina, jor and corey I will tell you about it later! xoxo

       Alright guys... let me tell you about one of my best friends christina rojas... hmm where do I start first off she thinks shes southern and was born in Georgia, which is funny because she definently has a Chicago accent and was born in Wheaton..(i think lol) But anyways dear little christina is like Jeckle and Hide one moment shes a dear little angel and another moment shes a little hyper child!! Haha Christina and I are making a documentry movie thingy this summer on "the day in the life of christina and Brie" it will be&nbsp;a seller I tell you. Christina likes to criticize me and say i mumble lol and she is one of those annoying straight A's kind of kids (lol jk I am jealous) but yeah she gets mad when she gets a 90% I swear shes insano over school work!!!! She is my tutor but her and laur get frusterated fast trying to help a poor a.d.d child like me.. jk! Me and Christina could sleep all day if it was up to us.. but unfortunatly we have loud familys who like to wake us up. Christina is a cool kid and if anyone says anything bad to her like those creepy sycamore kids there going down to china town! lol oh and if anyone else wants me to make them a&nbsp; section just let me know!

       Okay.. yeah so Wednesday I woke up and had to babysit my little sister which wasn't that bad because she just hangs outside with her "nieghborhood" friends and I get paid for sitting on the computer and not even having a clue where the heck she is... but yea&nbsp;then me, haley, Christina, and Jenny decide to bike to the pool (even though I don't really wanna go.. but ya) We get there and meet up with Mark and Chris and me and Christina stay for about 10 mins then leave because we are bored&nbsp;and don't wanna be at the pool so yeah then we decide to get potbellies to go and visite our dear friend lauren pedersen who just got back from south carolina and absolutly hates the pool and refuses to go there. But on the way Tina and I nearly get run over by severel cars on Naperville road.. What ever happened to "Pedestrians first?" I mean come on. lol but yea We went to laurs and hung there untill about 4 when Corey, Jordan and Kel came over and we played Egyption Ratscrew (best game ever corey, jordan and kel you all know you are glad I taught it to you even htough you all sucked..) yeah but anyways then Jenny and Rach came over and we all tried to play "the offner game" but everyone was being non-good at it and me and rach won with in a couple mins and the game was over.. yeah so then we tried to play Mafea (or however you spell it) but no one would shutup and I kept forgetting to wake up when the Narrater told me too (by the way Kel, Jordan and Jenny you all owe me thankyou's for saving you all!) and rachel would never close her eyes becuase she has a cheating problem (lol jk rach I love ya) Yah but then we just hung out and went on Ebaumsworld for a while and watched Corey laugh at the&nbsp; stupidest things.. yeah but then on Ebaumsworld we saw this weird thing on Urban Legands that says that a week before filming the movie "3 men and a baby" there was a 6 year old boy who died and it showed like the boy hiding behind a curtain in one picture of the scene or whatever ... but we thought it was stupid..(get back to this story in a sec) yeah but anyways then the guys left and the girls slept over and we watched the movie 3 men and a baby and the scariest thing ever happened when we were watching it we could see the boy it was so freaky!!!!!

       Hey Guys I am a bit behind...&nbsp; Uh&nbsp;let me try to remember what happened tuesday.... oh yes me, tina, rach, haley and jenny biked to the pool and met Jordan, Corey and Braden. We went over to the slides but for some reason I wasn't "In the mood " to go down them so yeah they were giving me grief about it, but I just didn't want to , funny how it turns out I wasn't "in the mood" for the diving boards either! lol I dunno what was my deal. But it was funny because tina dropped her 15 bucks in the pool when she was going off the diving board and this hottie lifegaurd had to stop everyone from diving and swim down and get it, it was really funny... then we went to Town sqaure and went into different stores and then went home then we were all sopposed to go to craigers but me and rach went to corey's instead with jordan and braden and we watched Legally Blonde 2 and Dumb and Dumber and then Me and Rachel were still in our Depancing war and she got me so good that my shorts went all the way to my feet but luckally I was behind the bar so no one saw , or else I would have had to kill rachel!! lol yeha and then my dad picked us up ..

        Hey Guys.... Even though I know you all probably have better things to do then read this.. I will write it anyways... Okay Yesterday me, Rachel and Jenny got up at like 10 o'clock in the morning to go running around 7 gables.. (by the way what does gables mean!?!?! lol J and rach) It ended up being pure torture because me and rach haven't ran for ever and jenny is in the running shape from soccer so me and Rachel were a little pathetic... LOL. Then we were running and I almost slipt in wet paint which was absolutely hilarious and then Rachel wrote "I love Rachel" in the wet paint. She's a crazy kid I tell yah. Anyways after that we went to Jenny's to get me and rachels bikes so we could bike home, but we stopped in to get water and ended up staying for another hour looking at pictures of jenny and Julie (J's sister) when they were babies. Which was quite humorous seeing that jenny had a Mohawk as a baby!! LOL I still love yah J! Anyways then me and rach biked home and after being home for like 10 min rach calls me and tells me to meet her at mcdonalds so I do and it was funny because rachel is trying to eat healthy so she gets a salad, and I get like a hamburger and fries and she is like all trying to make me jealous by saying "this salad is so good" which doesn't work at the least considering I hate salads . So yeah then me and rachel went back to my house and we decided to swim in my sisters pool, so we go in there and it is freezing so we only make it in there for like 10 mins. So we get out and Jordan calls us and says we can come over so we wait like a trillion hours for J to defuse her hair and then bike to boofoo to jordans house and finally get there. and Jordans says we can pick out a movie and we find out hes basically got the whole blockbuster down in his basement!! It was crazy... but we finally decided to watch along came polly.. which was pretty good, but I was so uncomfortable on the couch between J and Rach!! they were giving me no room whatso ever so when the movie was over I had to be home for dinner so j and rach decided to go home too. so we biked home and me and J had to pee really bad so she stopped at my house to pee and then called her pops and told him to come pick her bike up... the lazy bum! Then at night we went to Marys with some other people (Mary, Haley, Me, Jenny, Rach, Care, Craig, Tom, Chris S, Matt G, Nick N, Evan and Christina! I think that was all) And then we all went home .. ya and that was my day!

       Yeah okay so they didnt end up going to see the village so laur invited me over and Amy was there and we played Shmirtz  and Uno and then watched the ashlee simpson show then I went home at like 9:30 (lol laur and amy) and came back like 15 min later and we played more games and then Rachel came over and we were sleeping over.. and we went and got two movies at Blockbuster ( "High Crimes" and "Thirteen" ) Okay first we came home at like 12 and watched high crimes with was a really good movie with Ashley Judd, Jim Cavesel (spell check) and Morgan Freeman. Then we watched Thirteen... okay that had to be the absolute worst movie I have ever seen in my life. So we stayed up till like 5:30 and rachel was like on top of me the whole night.

       Okay yeah I am getting bad at these things but today after I woke up I went to Chilis with Lauren, Christina and Rachel... After we went shopping and Tina bought a fish at petland and named it Quiggly. We went shopping more then sat in Starbucks for a while and rachel would not stop pulling down my shorts... I worry about that girl sometimes... yeah but then we all biked home and I think tonight they may see the village and if they do I don't think I will go because that movie doesn't appeal to me!
