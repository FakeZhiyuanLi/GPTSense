      I just got back from feis, and I'm happy to say that I'm loved by my friend Jill. She told me she loved me three times, and hugged me once. I feel so honored. The fact that she was more then mildly drunk was the reason of her telling me this. It was pretty funny. Rofo, of course had more Tyler troubles. I didn't bitch at her, but i came close. I can't say anything, she'll get all bitchy and hard to live with and I don't feel like having to deal with it. It's to much effort. I woke up this morning and my heart sank, it was raining really hard and I thought that it would be raining until like feis and no one would come. Everyone did come though. And the earwigs were out in full force, they were crawling all over my shoes. Derek got his licence, and he has an awsome car. It's not his parents car or anything either, its this car he bought and like restored himself. Yeah, he's part of the orgional "car guy" group. Most of the real car guys graduated this year, so there aren't really many left. Sad really, I'm running out of people to turn to in case something goes wrong and I need it to get fixed. Yeah, so everyone was saying that tonight sucked, until the booze arrived, then everyone was like wooo! this night is awsome! So I got to listen to jackie and shann and alicia tell about their drunk stories. It was funny as hell. Jackie has a problem sitting still, and she really likes to sing when she is drunk. I love it. Alicia is a chatty drunk too, though in a more serious way. And Jill, will jill is crazy... she isn't called "Lushious" for nothing. Emily and Stepthen hooked up tonight. People were kind of saying something along the lines of "finially!". I dyed my bangs blue today, though it turned out more sea green. I'm pretty happy with the color. Its better then I thought it would be. Oh and I got my $20 for working at the bar. I'm happy, I have drinking money now, only it probably wont be used for that. I don't really like drinking that much anymore. I hate the taste. Getting drunk can be fun, when you're drunk but having to consume all those fluids, well it isnt fun. And I'll only have to piss it all out in like two hours anyway, so it's not to great. I'm going to the repile show tomorrow with Jamie, I cant fucking wait. Like this will probably be the highlight of my summer, so long as there aren't a bunch of people around, and in that case I'll just freak. Oh yeah, and my hair smells like a mix ofkool aid and lavander. It makes me hungry. Anyway, thats all I can think of. I'll post more if anything else comes to mind.

      Woke up at 7 to the sound my alarm, I had set it so I could get up early so my mother wouldn't leave and go to town without me. After I turned the alarm off I decided it was to early to get up so I went back to sleep. I have collected the rest of my school supplies today.  Got a 10 dollar binder  for 5 dollars, plus the blue kool aid for my hair, I'm looking forward to finially getting to color it. After a year and some of bugging my mom, I get to do it. I'm waiting to see what my fathers reaction will be. Probably extremely unhappy, but screw him, its my hair. Tonight is the first night of feis. It's down grand narrows, I hope the gang shows up. Else wise I'll be bored, and I can't have that happen. I almost had a panic attack in the grocery store. There were so many people and they were all crowding and and I couldn't breath, there wasn't enough space. So I took off for the car, and finially calmed down. Mom ruined it by scaring me. I wasn't to pleased about that. Oh well, what can you do.  ... I just got back from the frist night of feis. Despite what other people thought, I like of liked it. It was a dry night though, and there was no illegal substances, well there were but that wasnt really going on until a little before I left. I saw Donald, he looks pretty bet up and he's limping pretty bad. He'll survive though and the doctors say he's healing pretty quick. He was in a motorcycle accident, a bird flew in front of him and he crashed the bike. Yeah, everyone was like bitching because no one had any pot or liquor, I was just like... uh huh. And rofo was telling me about her current problems with her boyfriend. I just want to tell her to dump his ass and get over with it. I like Tyler and all, but he's just being so controling at the moment. As in for the past like six months. I dunno, Rofo loves him, so I guess I have to deal with her and him. I just wish they would get back to being normal. I never talked like this about stuff with Jamie to her, so I don't know why she is doing it to me. Rofo, if you ever read this... I don't mean it, I

      I get to work at the canteen at bingo tonight. Apparently it's very easy, and the one who usually works there left me a note, but where the note is, and where the keys are I have yet to figure out. I'm kind of unhappy. I should have given this more thought. I get paid for it, which is nice, but still. Yeah, so church today was some big feast day. Mom made me get all dressed up and stuff. She woke me up because she was ironing my pants. Mom is getting to be more and more of a holy roller every day. She is the church lady, as dad said she is the matriarch. Something about elephants and all the people turn to Mom. I dunno, dad babbles on like that sometimes, which is usually funny. The church was packed, and at the end dad started talking to this guy, so I had to just stand there. I just wanted to push dad aside and run to the car, and get away from all the people. There were some actually not to bad looking people in church. Not that I was looking or anything... There were also screaming babies. I hate summer people. They always invade my space and are so dam noisey. You want to be noisey, do it at your own dam house, don't go causing a ruckas where I live. I want to go meet some of them, but there's this one girl there that is a bitch (I have hung out with her before) and well because of her I don't really want to go and meet people. Not that I would in any case, seeing and how I'm kind of to shy to make a first move in that area. Though it would be nice to have people to hang around with. I'm starting to get really bored. Only 22 more days to school, then I can actually feel like I'm doing something. Mom is taking me to this reptile show sometime this week, I'm actually really looking forward to it, she said we could take Jamie too, if he was interested. I dunno, reptiles don't seem like his type of thing. Anyway, he's back from where ever he was, so ttfn.

      I was reading other people's blogs, and I don't know why, but almost every single one was basically the same as the next. And then I re-read my posts, and you know what I find? I'm the same as everyone else. I feel so special, so unique. I dunno, maybe there are actually some intersting blogs out there, but I've quickly discovered that  there are more people doing the mood: whatever mood is  thing then i would care to name. Ah well, nothing to do about it. I just feel like bitching about something. Yeah so, I'm going to have to add some pictures or something, and use the mood thing, and then I'll be like basically everyone else. Another attention craving teenager, with an outlet that no one really cares about. Cool, huh? Heh... doing the depressed teenager act is easy. I don't know, I'm thinking of just going back to writing in my journal, my penmanship needs some work. Also, people need to learn how to write poetry in at least some sort of form. And why does so many people's favourite color seem to be black? Yes, it goes with everything, but it's kind of depressing. Why the hell am I writing on this blog again? I did it already today. It's probably because I have not much else to do. Have church in the morning, hopefully it won't be hot, last time I almost got sick. I hate heat, and cold. Cold more then heat. Oh, and LOOK AT ME! I'M BEING ORGIONAL! that word is not spelled correctly. I don't feel like finding the right spelling though. Anyway, night.

      I went to highland village today, there was this celtic concert thing. Jamie was there, only he left before I got to see him. Kind of dissapointing, but on the plus side I got to pet highland cattle. Their horns felt really warm. The girl I was with, Brittany was scared of the black one because it was "evil" it kept on hitting the fence with its horns. There was a calf there, it was so cute, but it was kind of shy. I wanted to take it home with me, but it would have been way to big to smuggle out and fit into the car. Klutzy the clown was there too, and yeah, clowns are even scaryer up close. Like I'm sure the guy is nice and all, but once he started telling this little like three year old girl that guys loved hugs and kisses and tickles, well then I thought it was a little weird. He has this guy with him named Mark, he seemed nice enough, didn't really get to talk to him though. I got drenched in the rain... I had an umbrella and towl, but it didnt to much good. Oh, and I want to volenteer at highland village  next year, volenteers get free food, and they have awsome fries there. Yep, so I thought I steped in pee today, because my bathroom floor had this puddle on it beside the toilet, but then I realized it was from the washer, so it wasn't gross anymore. Yeah, thats all the news I have of the day, I don't see anything interesting happening to me. Not that what i wrote about was interesting.

      I went to see Jamie today. It was really fun, though the walk we took was a killer. I hate hot weather as much as he does, I just don't complain about it so much. I feel kind of bad, his family went to the beach but he couldn't go because I was there. He said he didn't mind or whatever, but I still sort of worry that he did. Typical fears. Oh yes, and I am now his "biznitch" I think thats how the line of thought he was saying went. I wasn't really paying much attention. He was joking anyway. Though, if he wanted he could have me seriously whipped, more so then now. Mom got me two pairs of jeans and some anti frizz stuff for my hair. I don't really have the heart to tell her I'm not going to use the stuff for my hair, it would be to much work. Well maybe if i was going out or something. But well, that never happens. I'm what you call a social hermit. At least that's how I see myself. I only come out when I have to, or when Jamie will be there. You know... I'm more or less obsessive about Jamie, in case you didn't notice. But my life basically revolves around him. Him and school is my life. Kind of sad really, I'm almost 16 and one of the major things in my life is school. The Jamie part is fine though. I wish my birthday would hurry up and get here, I want my book.  Still a while though. I can wait I guess.  BNR

      So yeah, I think I know why the blog wouldn't work before, but I didn't want to try this until Jamie left, for no other reason then I didn't want to end up bugging him. All I have to do it keep the post kind of short. Like the first one was bigger then I thought it would be. I dunno, I'll try to post this and see what happens. If this doesn't work I'll give up for the night and leave in disgust. Yep so I guess this is my voice on the net now. Pretty shitty voice if you ask me. I'm like one person out of a million or more who have a blog probably. So if more then Jamie reads this, I'd be surprised. So to get right down to it, I'm going to give a quick overview of myself. I'm an attention whore, plain and simple. I have a thing against almost all people but need to be in the spotlight most of the time. I hate clowns and cold weather. Odd numbers piss me off, as well as stupidity. I have a fear of drowning or getting pulled underwater by something, but I love swimming. That's good enough I guess, nothing left really. Oh, and I like the color pink.

      First off: Thank you Jamie for doing this for me, I realy appreciate it. Secondly I hate this piece of crap called blogger. The spell check does not work, it won't go past the word don't.  Then, I try to post, and what happens? I lose all of my lovely writing. It was some deep shit, and how I had found the cure for the comman cold and stuff like that. But it was all lost. Dam stupid thing. I'm sick of you already. I didn't even make it a week. Wow, this is a new record for me. Usually it takes two hours for me to hate something with a passion. But blogger did it in maybe half an hour. I applaude you blogger, you have been added to the list of things I hate. I'm still going to use it though. Because Jamie did this all for me and I want to use it for a little while before I say, you know what? I don't really feel like playing with this anymore.  Anyway, yeah I'm not going to try and write something deep and meaningful, considering the fact that this most likely won't work. Stupid internet and computers and everything computer related. I hate it all. It's all evil. Yes, I use the stuff, because there isn't very much chance that I'll go through life without coming in contact with it. But I would still like for it to be destroyed in a big ball of fire. Fire is kind of cool, except when it burns you, then it's bad. Bad fire, behave yourself, don't hurt me. Yeah, I'm hungry... if I had a robot that made me food, then I would probably like computers. Robots are cool, except for the ones that kill people. Those things are scarey. I don't want to be near them. You know what else is scarey? Clowns... how can something be that happy all the time. Except for the sad clowns, but they are even worse then the happy clowns. All mopey and wanting attention. Clowns are attention whores. Though so am I, so I have something in comman with clowns. That isn't good. I learned a new word today. The word is zenith. Look it up, it's kind of cool. I wanted to use eggbeater.blogspot.com for the url, but can you believe it, someone had it already. What kind of sick, twisted person uses eggbeater for a name? Actually I think it's kind of cool. Anyway, in closing: Thank you jamie, and I hate blogger. Spell check also sucks ass.
