      So here it is friday night. Not much to do here in Cambridge so I went to Walmart for my weekly I'm bored so what can I buy spending spree. And of course there are things in my cart that I had no intention of buying-milk, salad, boneless chicken breast but the essentials were there-Bottled water and a case of Beer so I was doing ok. Anyway, I'm walking through the DVD isle and I notice something. Walmart sells TV shows seasons on DVD and not just Friends or Smallville but the really violent and vulgar ones such as the Sopranos, Nip/Tuck, and the Chappelle Show. Now don't get me wrong, I like those shows but I remember a few years back when Walmart took a stand and no longer sold music cd's with explicit lyrics. Every cd is edited for them. Why is it that they feel they can sell theses DVD yet not sell explicit cd's? Don't they know that some child will buy the Chappelle show and get hooked on crack b/c of it? I personally believe that explicit words along with images is does a lot more damage than hearing someone's explicit lyrics. It is weird and bothers me.

      Hmmm. Work has been so busy lately, I have nothing interesting to speak on. July is going to be a busy month with the many concerts I will be attending. I will be seeing 3 Doors Down/Nickelback/Three Days Grace on July 9th. I have seen 3 Doors Down and Nickelback in the past, and it will interesting to see how they have changed and hopefully gotten better. Next is Evanesence/Seether/Breaking Benjamin on July 16th. It will be the first time I will be seeing any of these bands live. Lets hope they are good. On July 31st, I'll be seeing John Mayer and Maroon 5. That should be a good time as well. And to top off the summer, September 24th is Metallica! I can't wait for that one! Thats all for now!

      So in the past month, I have seen more movies here in Cambridge than I have in the entire 3 years combined. I attribute it to finally realizing we have a movie theather. Anyway, tonight I saw Spiderman 2. I must say, it was pretty good. Not my favorite movie all time but it was pretty darn good. What I want to know is that with all the cartoons, comics, and tv shows that get turned into movies, why have they not made G.I. Joe into a real-life movie? I don't know if it was just me, but I noticed a G.I. Joe reference in the movie Dodgeball. The good guys were the "Average Joes" while the bad guys were the "Purple Cobras." If anyone remembers it was the Joes vs. the Cobras. Even the teams colors were dead on with the "Joes" being in red, and the "Cobras" being in purple. Besides the fact that the story line would pretty much suck, I think the movie would be pretty hard to cast. There were so many characters involved, how would anyone get much screen time?  Enough about movies. Its t-minus 23 hours and counting until the Riverfront Roar begins. There will not be any updates this weekend as I will be too busy having fun. T-revor out!

      They may have cancelled Lollapalooza this year but have no fear Drunkenpalooza 2004 will make its yearly stop at the Riverfront Roar this weekend. After lots of praying that the weather will hold out, it looks like it will so Friday and Saturday should be nice. Lots of booze and fun to be had. Plus as an added bonus, I learned today that I have monday off as my employer will be observing the 4th holiday on the 5th. That makes things nice. Anyway only 2 days left! See you there.

      Today I got my yearly performance evaluation. That means the boss takes me to lunch tells me I am doing a good job and keep up the good work. Yeah. Whoopie! Show me the money. My raise this year was good. I shouldn't complain so I will spare the details.  Anywho, this weekend is the Riverfront Roar in Marietta. It should be a good time as last year was mucho fun. This year  urlLink Dole  booked us a room at the luxurious Lafayette Hotel. I give us 4 hours before they ask us to leave and never return. Should be a good time!

      First...I am an alcoholic. I have accepted that fact. It runs in my family. Who can blame me. I love the hazy feeling of a good buzz. It takes the edge off of my so called "life.". I am a social alcoholic which means I drink in order for me to have a good time in the public setting. Its true as I am much more outgoing after a few beers which leads me to my next point.  It isn't hard to be an alcoholic in the lovely town of Cambridge. There isn't much to do. I sometimes venture to the so called nite club Shakers. That place can kill a buzz like no other. Mixed with the ugly reality that there are not many attractive women in this town and it has the world's worst DJ, it makes it tough to have a good night out. I hope the Shaker's DJ reads this. If he does, I would like to say you suck. Play good music consistently. I think I speak for everyone when I say one good song followed by two crappy songs is no way to be a good DJ. Besides that, he plays the same songs at least twice in less than an hour. I can only listen to the Cha-Cha slide once in a night let alone twice in less than twenty minutes.  Lastly...Ladies, I am a 6 foot 6 inch tall, 280 pound man. Don't act like I don't exist. It is hard to miss me. Please don't pretend I am not saying hi or being nice to you. Chances are, I have already realized that I have absolutely no chance whatsoever with you, but I am being polite. Again, I am not invisible and please don't treat me that way.   This is the Fence signing off.

      Not too much to share. The week is going by pretty quick which is nice. I'll be attending a concert Friday evening that should be fun and I am looking forward to helping out with the Gus Macker tournament here in Cambridge this weekend. If you aren't busy, you should check it out.  I set up a mobile blog to post some pics I took from the past weekend. You can find it  urlLink here  Fun stuff. Well that is all for now. Later!

      Once again the Fourth of July weekend was very fun and very interesting. It started off Friday at 7pm with Brian "JT" Wolfe declaring "Its Go Time!" And from there it was. Most of the weekend was spent drinking and having a good time. Right off the bat JT was awarded corner time in Applebee's for one of his awkward silence comments. From there it was to the Double L for some more drinking and dancing. There was this guys dancing like a maniac and taking up the whole dance floor with no regard to anyone else in his way-we declared him Pop-Lock-Guy. JT got into a dance off with Pop-Lock-Guy and GOT SERVED! Very hilarious. At 2am, a drunken phone call was placed to the one member of the DAP team that was not there yet. She was asleep 150 miles away and took the call like a trooper. Next thing I know, we are back in our lovely (read:Crappy) hotel room at the Lafayette drinking some more and JT shows up with some random girl he met at the bar. The interesting part was that she had 14 piercings and only ten that I saw. The next morning, once JT got rid of the random girl, we all went to breakfast (pretty much still drunk) at the Brewery. Drinking commenced after breakfast as there was free beer at the VIP deck in the Lafayette. We watched a few boats race during the day and played a lot of cards while drinking that evening. Once we were all pretty lit up, we went Mini-golfing which is always a treat. Thats when Megan joined up with DAP 2004. Jake ended up in the bush at Mini-golf (Sorry Jake, someone had to be that guy). Then it was back to the Double L again as JT has the need to dance like no man I have ever met. My sister decided she wanted to dance with Pop-Lock-Guy, and when she did, he freaked out an ran away-interesting. Sunday was spent mostly watching boat races or trying to find shelter from the rain that briefly stopped the races. I'll end here to not bore anyone with the many stories of the weekend. I will just say that overall DAP 2004 was a great time and will be talked about until next years event!  I would like to give thanks to the crew that made it all possible.: JT, Jake, Megan, Jessica, Andy Dole, Pop-Lock-Guy, and random pierced girl. You all made it interesting. And a special thanks to Matt Dole for providing us with the room at the Lafayette and VIP passes at the events. The hotel room was much better than staying at your apartment for everyone involved!

      Tonight was the second concert in my sister and I's road trip this summer. This week was at Germain Ampitheater in Columbus. We saw Breaking Benjamin, Three Days Grace, Seether, and Evanesence. It was suprisingly a good time. I was amazed at how well Breaking Benjamin played. I have their first CD and am not very impressed but they did well playing live, except for the fact that they do no play to the audience much. They just did their set and went home. This was also the second time in a week that I saw Three Days Grace. They keep getting better with each show. Seether was good as well. They didn't play to the crowd as much as a band that is third on the bill.&nbsp; And last but not least was Evanescence. I am not a big fan of them as I feel they are way overplayed on the radio.&nbsp; Sure they have some good songs but after hearing them 5 times an hour, it wears on a guy.&nbsp; They were well polished at playing live. I wasn't sure the lead singer would be able to hit the notes but she did an excellent job.&nbsp; The big suprise was that they cover Korn's "Thoughtless" which I am a big fan of. Another cool thing was the guitar player was playing a guitar I have, painted the same way. I was pretty happy. I've posted a few pics from the night at my Picture blog which can be found  urlLink here  Check it out.

      Ok, we all know I have an obsession with cellphones. It is because I like gadgets and am intrigued with new technology. Anywho, I had quite a scare last night. I was getting ready for dinner and was carrying my glass of milk and my cellphone in the same hand. When I set my glass down, my cellphone fell into it. I almost died. This is the cellphone that I flew to Las Vegas last May to purchase because it wasn't available in Ohio yet. So I quickly pulled the phone out and ran for the sink. I started tearing it apart to see what the damage was as liquid and electronics don't mix. I dried all the milk and cleaned the parts with alcohol wipes and then let it sit for 24 hours. I hoped all day that my $400.00 plus phone would not become a paper weight. When I got home from work, I carefully put the phone back together. It booted up and everything was fine except the screen. It has some discolorations to it now that were not there before but at least the phone works. Thank goodness.

      I have a strong dislike for Mondays. I am finally able to get good night of sleep when the alarm goes off for Monday morning. So I drag my ass out of bed and into the shower. Once I get dressed, I have my long commute to work to look forward to, oh wait, my desk is just in the other room. How convenient. Its nice this way in the morning, but sucks at night when I am ready to be done with work. So, I go to work and get out on the road pretty early this morning (well, earlier than normal as I was yelled at last week for slacking off so I figure this week will work a little harder). I finish up pretty early today (noon) with some of my claims. My next appointment isn't until 4:30, so I decided to call some of my co-workers to see if they need any help (I was also scolded for not offering to help the guys I work with in Columbus). Side note: Columbus is 1.5 hours away from Cambridge, I'm not too keen on driving that far to help someone out who never offers to help me but thats as different story. I leave two messages, and one guy doesn't need any help. So what to do until 4:30, I go home. Nothing to do at home but watch TV so that's pretty much all I do until I leave for Newark at 3:30. Well, I finish with my appointment around five and head back home. Then comes the rain, and of course no one knows how to drive in the rain on the interstate. What normally takes a half hour takes an hour to get home and I finally pull into the drive around 6pm. So again, I dislike dislike Mondays.

      Yeah! Today I officially start my summer vacation! One week of absolutely nothing to do and nowhere I have to go. I'm excited as this is the first summer vacation I have had since leaving college oh so many years ago. I decided I needed a break from work so a week off it just what I deserve. And we are having a party on July 30th at my parent's house. Its a friday. We are going with a beach party theme so wear your flip-flops and drink some beer. Lets hope the weather is better this time than last as it was still wet from raining all day. And if you are reading, the FBI and ATF are welcome to join us this time. The Mansfield Police, however, are not as they need to be protecting our fair town.&nbsp;

      Ok, so as we all know, I have many cellphones through various providers. But I want it to be know throughout the world that I WILL NEVER HAVE SERVICE THROUGH VERIZON WIRELESS. They contradict themselves too many times and have very poor customer service represtentation. It may just be the local office in Mansfield, OH but every time I deal with this company, it leaves as very bad taste in my mouth. It makes me glad that my parents have service through them and not me. The story is not really worth going into so I won't but I will reiterate the fact that they suck and if anyone is considering them as a cell phone provider should get a second opinion before they commit.

      So far, my vacation week has been pretty much a waste. I spent most of it in the car driving back and forth between Cleveland and Columbus. I do that normally for work. But tonight may redeem the wasted week as we are throwing a beach party in our backyard. If the weather holds out, it should be lots of fun. Tomorrow is the last of our July concert series with John Mayer playing in Columbus. That road trip takes a break until September when Metallica rolls into the Schottenstein Center in Columbus. T-revor out!

      "It would be helpful if we opened up the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. I think it's a mistake not to. And I would strongly urge you all to travel up there and take a look at it, and you can make a determination as to&nbsp; how beautiful that country is." -George Bush March 29, 2001.  If it is so beautiful, why destroy it by drilling for oil?

      So last night, I decide to go out with a few friends. My sister suggests we "mix it up" and go to Ashland to see what bars are hopping there. Mind you Ashland's big attraction is that is is a college town. It is normally dead during the summer months. This saturday night was once of them. We venture to a few of the more "in town" bars, and they are kinda dead so we take a chance and go further north out of town to a place called the "Lone Pine." When we pulled in, we should have turned around and left as the sign out front said Saturday- Naughty Pine Band.&nbsp; Have you ever walked into a bar where the music stops and everyone looks at you like you don't belong there? That was this place. After paying $5 for the cover charge, I quickly downed a couple beers. The Naughty Pine Band starts playing their country/western stuff and people start line dancing. Yes you read that right, they were line dancing! Then just about the end of one of the song, my sister says "play some Skynrd man!" and there were a few people that looked at us like we should be shot. That was our que to leave, quickly. We finally ventured back to Mansfield and hit up the Red Fox, where everyone knows our names and we didn't get death threats! Good Times!

      "Plans are being discussed as to who will replace Dick Cheney if he has to  resign for health reasons. It's not easy for President Bush. He can't just name  a replacement. He would first have to be confirmed by the oil, gas and power  companies." -- Jay Leno  "President Bush said that American workers will need new skills to get the new  jobs in the 21st century. Some of the skills they're going to need are Spanish,  Chinese, and Korean, because that's where the jobs went." -- Jay Leno  "The White House is now backtracking from its prediction that 2.6 million new  jobs will be created in the U.S. this year. They say they were off, by roughly  2.6 million jobs." -- Jay Leno  "There was a scare in Washington when a man climbed over the White House wall  and was arrested. This marks the first time a person has gotten into The White  House unlawfully since President Bush." -- David Letterman

      After my week of vacation, I realized that it is good to be home. I know what you are thinking "Trevor, how can you be glad to be back in Cambridge?" Well, I am. It is because I know where everything is in my apartment. I don't have to share the bathroom or couch with anyone. I get to do things at my own pace. Its nice.  Something I didn't understand while I was on vacation was the amount of people who came to my parent's house wondering who I was going to vote for in November. Now you may ask why I find this weird? It is because I am registered to vote in Cambridge, Oh and I have the notification card to prove it. Not Mansfield. Yet everyone seemed call me by my first name when they came to the door.  This raised concern for me as I  will  vote in the November election. So my mom, who has taken on the personal responsibility of getting John Kerry elected President pulled out her most current registered voters list for the city of Mansfield. Low and behold, my name was not on the list which calmed my nerves a bit.  Anyway, just a reminder to all those out there reading my blog to check out my photo blog  urlLink here  It is sometimes more fun to post pictures than to type what is going on.  And by the way, if you like funny stoner movies, check out Harold and Kumar go to White Castle. I thought it was quite funny and gave me the biggest urge to eat hamburgers.  T-revor out!

        It has been a John Mayer music night.

"Four more exits to my apartment but I am tempted to keep the car in drive." -John Mayer, Why Georgia    "I                      can tell you this much  I will marry just once  And if it doesn't work out  Give her half of my stuff  It's fine with me  We said eternity  And I will go to my grave  With the life that I gave  Not just some melody line  On a radio wave  It dissipates  And soon eveaporates  But home life doesn't change" - John Mayer, Home Life

      Have you ever felt like screaming but can't.  I can't seem to find any emotion in my life lately. None. Its a flatline. It is frustrating b/c I cannot figure out how to change it.  It could be b/c of the lack of motivation I have in general and/or the lack of vision and direction. I wish that things would get better.

      So last night was interesting. It was just supposed to be a small get together of some old friends in Marietta. But we all know what happens when a bunch of Delts get together. We proceed to Tampico's for dinner (a really bad idea, but hindsight is 20/20) where Brian drinks margaritas from the pitcher. He was wasted by 7:30. Then we go back to Buel's apartment on campus to play cards and drink some beer. Well, a game of asshole broke out and we lost Brian pretty quick. But being the trooper he is, he went right back to drinking. I vaguely remember being the only anti-Bush person in the room at one point and that was ugly. Then we ventured to the Town house for some pool and met up with Jake's friend Angie. After everyone was either too tired or too drunk, it was down to myself, Angie, and Jake. This is where it gets interesting as Jake suggested we go to the Double L. Now, there isn't much to do at the Double L except drink and/or dance. I was pretty shocked when Jake rolls out on the dance floor thus reaffirming his nickname 0f Jordan Knight. And he continually was out there. It must have been the lack of JT on this adventure b/c Jordan Knight stepped right up to fill the void. JK did not dance with any fat and/or ugly women this time which is good for him. After the dancing, the three of us stumble back to Buel's as it was our crash pad for the night. I wanted to pass out so bad, but the damn room wouldn't stop spinning. And when I woke up, it was still spinning. And on the entire car ride home which I am glad to report there was no puking in Brian's car. Unfortunately, I did my own praying to the porcelin god this afternoon. It wasn't right when I got home like I predicted but it was after laying on the couch for a few hours dwelling on the fact that I really need to vomit. That is the worst.  So anyway, enough rambling. I had a good time this weekend and it was good seeing everyone again. Random pictures from the evening can be viewed at http://trevgit.textamerica.com/
