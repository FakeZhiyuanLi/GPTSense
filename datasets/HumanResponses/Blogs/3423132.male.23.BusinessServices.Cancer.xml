       astronomy is a topic i hav always been deeply interested in.. i often ponder over the intricacies of the universe.. and discuss it will anyone who is interested.. two things that hav always fascinated me are, time and space..  the hugeness of space and time scales of the universe is mind boggling in itself.. the universe has been around for more than 10 billion years.. most of us cannot even comprehend the enormity of this figure.. to think that the entire human civilization has only been around for 5000 years..  many stars visible from earth r thousands of light years away.. it means what they appear to us today, is what they where thousands of years back.. so, in fact, we r actually able to look back in time.. who says that time machine is yet to be invented..   consider the opposite scenario.. suppose a guy is sitting with a very powerful telescope in a planet 2 million light years away.. he wud be able to see the light reflected from the earth 2 million years back.. i.e. he wud see dinosaurs roaming abt all over the place..   a topic as fascinating as astronomy, is relativity.. the wrapping of time and space.. although i cud understand the logic behind the mathematical derivations which indicate the shrinking of time and length as speed of a body approaches the speed of light, i hav never quite been able to grasp how and why does it actually happen.. how can guys like stephen hawking and co. think and derive theories in areas which most others can't even comprehend properly.. the more i delve into it, the more intrigued i get..  when i think abt all these things, i realize how insignificant we r in the larger scheme of things.. the minutest malfunction in the inter-galactic machinery can completely obliterate our very existence.. and there is no way we can do anything abt it... we r all puppets in the hands of greater forces.. maybe, it is from here that the concepts of God and Destiny hav emerged...  any discussion on such a topic cannot conclude without a mention of extra-terrestrial beings.. i'll just quote a dialogue from the novel Contact, by carl sagan.. a child asked the leading lady abt what she thought of extra-terrestrials.. she replied, "there r more stars in this galaxy than there is sand on all beaches of earth.. and there r more galaxies in the universe than there is sand on this earth.. so, if it's only us.. then it seems like an awful waste of space".....

       if i am passionate abt something.. it’s cricket.. i suppose it’s in the genes.. my dad was a great enthusiast.. and an uncle of mine has played a lot of club cricket in his days.. i've been playing the game since my early childhood..   i hav been somewhat starved of playing cricket throughout.. in school , i lived far away from all my friends, so had no one to play with, except for my servant.. that too in the backyard.. that’s where i developed a strong offside game.. and an embarrassingly weak leg side game, i must add.. cudn’t help it.. offside was the only place where we cud score runs in my backyard.. i routinely cross the fences on cricket fields with square cuts and lofted drives.. but hav hit only a single six on the leg side in my life.. then we relocated to our own house when i was in std. 10.. now most of my friends lived nearby.. and we frequently set the nearby cricket grounds on fire by our antics…  in college, i used to commute daily from Raipur for the first 1 and ½ years.. so cud not get into the computer science cricket team.. i finally made it to the team in the final year.. and was part of the team in 2 famous games.. first, when we defeated electronics for the 1st and only time in 4 years.. second, when we scraped into the semi-final on the basis of run-rates at the expense of the MCA team.. amidst much mid-pitch controversy and rancor.   things hav been better in NITIE.. hav been part of the PGDIM team form day 1.. and am regarded as one of the frontline batsmen.. the first ball that i faced in NITIE was quite special.. was batting at no. 3.. got in after the opener was castled first ball by the fastest bowler in NITIE.. then he fired a bouncer on the offside at me.. and the ball disappeared into the extra-cover boundary….. i must add, my form has tapered off after that.. am looking forward to some good innings in the new season..   i’ve also been a great trivia maniac and cricket watcher.. my earliest memory of a live cricket match was Chetan Sharma’s hat-trick against New- Zealand in the 1987 World Cup.. hav been following Indian Cricket’s fortunes ever since then..  my favourite cricket personality.. it’s Harsha Bhogle.. what a life… work only 6 months a year.. live in 5 star hotels in the most exotic countries.. talk abt the thing u love most.. and earn a cool 50 lakh per year for all that… sometimes I think abt joining the cricket commentary profession.. if Harsha Bhogle cud do it, so can i.. after all, he is an engineer cum MBA.. so am i.. he is a thin guy who wears spectacles and is losing hair fast.. so am i.......

       i had seen a few very swanky and futuristic buildings in many ads (ex. the fiat palio ad with sachin).. and always wondered where those were located.. bangalore was my bet..  or hyderabad.. in the hi tech city..  i was wrong.. when i went to the Bandra Kurla Complex for the 1st time, i was nothing short of amazed.. the humongousness and extravagance of the concrete structures is something to behold..   and guess what, i am placed right in the middle of BKC (i.e. Bandra Kurla Complex) for  the whole 2 months of my summer internship.. in Bank of Baroda Corporate Center.. looking out of the window, i can constantly see the gargantuan structures of IL&FS,ICICI, NABARD etc... not that the Bank of Baroda building is too far behind.. i must add......  just to bring things in perspective.. the cost of the Bank of Baroda building was 125 crore.. and it is one of the smaller ones around.. the only thing i hate abt the place is the lack of greenary.. not a single tree in the entire area..  having seen the area in so many ads and movies, i expected to be witness to at least one such shooting during my internship.. that almost didn't happen.. but today (with just 1 week to go before i wind up my project), as i was entering my office, i saw a teporary shooting setup being made right in front.. an hour later, a galaxy of filmstars decended on the scene.. Akshay Kumar, Tussar Kapoor, Esha Deol, Archana Puran Singh, Laxmikant Berde (remember him?), and the guy who was the villain in Gulam (forgot his name).. they shot a few scenes and then disappeared..  gone r the days when the leading couple used to run around trees.. they still run around in a jungle.. but nowerdays, it's in a Concrete Jungle.................

       engineering college.. well.. mine was BIT, Durg.. let's start right from the beginning.. had 918 rank in PET (much much below what my parents expected of me).. so good branches in most good RECs were out of question.. thus, decided to go for Computer Science Engg. in BIT, Durg.. those days, computer science was red hot..      was quite happy with my choice.. had always been interested in IT.. engineering college was just 3 hrs away from my hometown Bilaspur.. and what's more, some of my friends had also landed over there..  1ST YEAR- i used to live in my uncle's place in Raipur, and commute daily to Durg (which is a twin city of Bhilai) by bus.. the best part was, by being a fresher from Bilaspur who lived in Raipur, i was not eligible to be ragged by the seniors from either city.. but not being in either Raipur or Bilaspur batch, and being a day-scholar to boot, did take it's toll.. used to spent most of the time in travel.. had a limited no. of friends, and was considered a bit of a nerd by many.. the impression was accentuated by the rediculously high marks i used to get.. 91 in english.. over 400 out of 500 in the mid term.. and then the big'un.. 777 out of 900 in 1st semester final exam.. and the UT tag to go with it.. i've always been a good student, but this was something even i never expected.. my roommate for the later part of my college life, Prayas believes that the 777 record in 1st  semester may never be broken, specially due to all the ragging that freshers hav to endure.. my best friend those days used to be saurabh srivastav.. will write abt him separately later.. sallu was also there, but he was a hostel-er..

       2ND YEAR- the most enjoyable year of engineering.. had truckloads of fun in classs..  made friends with a charecter called abhijeet sen.. and what a charecter he was.. and still is.. entertainment came from all corners.. listening to high "funda" from Amitabh Mishra, being thrown out of class by Talweker, playing pranks with Poddar, watching the epic India-Australia test series.. and constantly gazing out of the classroom windows.....  midddle of 2nd year, decided to shift base from Raipur to Durg.. travelling was taking up too much time for comfort.. shifted to the best house in house in durg, and under the best land-lords as well.. and if that was not all, with the best roommates too.. prayas was my classmate.. the other 2, pratik (prayas' brother) and adnan, were our seniors.. prayas was in for a big letdown.. he expected me to be a nerd who wud study 28 hrs a day, thus inspiring him to study hard as well.. but he soon realised his mistake.. he had landed up with a rommate who used to study even less than he did, and slept even more.. but somehow.. i managed to retain the top spot in class thru the 2nd year as well..

       3RD YEAR- things were getting more serious now.. had to start preparing to PG.. since the word 'placement' was not in BIT dictionary.. i never had a techy bent of mind.. nor was particularly good at it.. so, MBA was a natural choice.. but then.. those were the days when the entire college was gripped in GRE mania.. so decided to giv it a shot as well.. US or MS never enticed me.. i just wanted to prove myself somewhere before going for MBA enterance next year.. since almost everyone else was appearing for GRE, guidance was not an issue.. but being my lazy self, i began my preparation just 3 months before the test date.. it was a race against time.. the pressure mounted as the day approached.. specially when i saw people who had been preparing for years, flaundering badly..   then came the big day.. 27th may 2002.. the pressure was at it's peak.. most of my batchmates expected something special from me.. not to mention my parents, who always hav.. maths section was a giveaway.. but analytical section really pushed me to the limits.. then when i pressed the score button, i cud hardly believe my eyes..800-maths, 720-verbal, 710-analytical.. 2230 out of 2400 overall.. that was the highest score in the last 2 years in BIT...  now i was ready to take on MBA enterance..

       FINAL YEAR- it was crunch time now.. 4 months for CAT.. joined PT.. but hardly attended any classes.. found it more value adding to solve papers in my room than listening to wierdos in PT.. rohit girdhar was the only guy whose classes were worth attending.. seniors had left.. and a new roommate joined us.. he was a guy called mohammad afroz memon loya raza khan rizwi.. he had the best logical brain in BIT.. and used to study hard as well.. but the irony was, the guy who used to study the most (afroz) used to get the least marks, and the one who studied least (me), got the highest..  7th sem. was the period when all students were under max. stress.. with almost everyone preparing for CAT, GATE, or GRE.. it was also the time when some teachers tried their best to make sure that no one did well in those exams.. they overloaded us will assignments and tests as the d-days approached.. i doubt if any of my classmates will ever forget the havoc one Mr. Anil Somai created..  did ok in CAT, but not upto expectations.. got 96.49% percentile.. no IIM calls.. 7th sem was not too gr8.. after 3 years and 6 semesters, i was finally dislodged from the top spot..      then my good times began.. calls from NITIE, XLRI, SCMHRD, XIM-B, TAPMI, FORE, IIT-M.. SCMHRD GD/PI was first on the cards.. got unceremoniously thrown out after the GD phase itself, along with Ashutosh Shrotriya.. it really was like a smack on the face for both of us.. we resolved to clear all interviews we wud attend thereafter.. and guess what.. we both lived up to our resolutions.. He is now cooling his heels in IIM-L..   8th sem. was also the time of great pain and dilemma.. my dad expired on the very day i came to know that i had made it to XLRI.. that i cud never tell him abt it wud always haunt me..  then i was caught in the dilemma of my life.. NITIE or XLRI.. was perhaps the 1st from the region to make it to XL.. also, XL has more brand equity in the industry.. but the catch was, due to my final sem. exams, i wud hav missed out on 3 weeks of classes over there.. and their 1st mid-term wud hav been underway by the time i got there.. NITIE had been my dream college for a long time.. there is little to differenciate between the 2 in b-school rankings.. it was an embarassment of riches of sorts.. so, i decided to consult the people who wud give me the best advice.. a NITIE alumnus (my brother) and an XL alumnus (my brother-in-law).. both said, for IT (which is the field i want to get into) NITIE may be a better choice.. but i might as well decide on the flip of a coin.. so finally, NITIE it was.. and over the last 1 year, i hav realised that i had made the right decision.. the year ended with the biggest surprise.. i had topped in 8th sem. too.. i never expected this, after my 7th sem. debacle.. specially since i hardly had any time to study during the final sem.. and was shuttling between Mumbai and Durg even during the exams..  now, a small anecdote to end a long tale.. when i had come to BIT for the 1st time.. for my admission.. i had noticed a hoarding just outside the campus, put up by PT.. with the photo of a senior who had made it to IIM-C.. and said to myself, hope that one day my photo wud also be there.. in jan. this year, when i went to BIT (perhaps for the last time), to get my Gold Medal.. i saw another hoarding.. put up by PT.. with my photo (along with ashutosh shrotriya and sushant sachdeva)..... well that just abt sums up the story...

       Pun is fun.. for me, it's a way of life.. it's a "pun"acea for all worries.. a "pun"dora's box.. at times, it can get "pun"gent as well.. but what's the fun in uttering a sentence that has only one meaning..   my experiments with pun began with my friendship with sallu, a.k.a. manish saluja, of mordern bread fame.. we r  langotia yaars .. he is the most irritatingly funny person i hav ever met.. he can create the most illogical humour out of thin air.. i must hav picked it from him in my childhood.. in our school and college days, the homour chemistry of ours was legendary .. errr.. infamous wud be more appropriate..   i hav always pestered my friends with witty remarks ( although many wud object to the use of this adjective).. specially during classes and lectures.. and hav been guilty of getting them into a spot of bother with profs. as well.. many hav been caught laughing in class.. but then, it's all in the game..  in NITIE.. my skills hav reached "pun"tastic heights.. once, my batchmates got so psyched out by my PJs, they even GPLed me.. but as they say, old habbits die hard.. they r still suffering in my hands.. or rather, my mouth..  and how can i forget our internal messenger.. it's called ip messenger.. it's the lifeline of NITIE.. people use some of the most weirdly ingenious usernames and tag-lines over there.. needless to say, i do my best too..   but i must admit, there r much better "pun"sters in our batch over here.. VG, dada, HK etc.. they r masters of the craft.. i am just an aspiring "pun"dit.... :)))  Note:- none of the comments in the above post are expected to be taken seriously.

       this blog thing is quite addictive.. my 2nd entry for the day.. summer internship on the verge of completion.. these 2 months gave the 1st flavour of the corporate world..   let's start form the begining.. always wanted to get into systems.. that's why left XLRI for NITIE (the toughest decision of my life) in the first place.. so, had applied only for IT projects in summers.. got very close to cracking some biggies.. like cognizant, HLL etc.. but cud not make the final cut.. finally landed in Bank of Baroda..    am rather lazy.. never one who like's living out of a suitcase.. so was happy to get a project in mumbai.. that too in the Corporate Center in swanky Bandra Kurla Complex.. got a cool project guide over there.. unlike most of my colleagues, i must add.. the project in "Knowledge Management" not being too demanding, finished it off well in advance.. and now, am cooling my heels in the last leg of the project.. am a lucky man..  but all is not over.. for freshers like me, what u did last summer is the most important thing during final placements.. so, it is imperative that u do a good job.. or at least make it sound that way.. am satisfied with my work.. made a fundu report to boot.. but as the cliche' goes- "the proof of the pudding is in the eating".. whether my efforts have been good enough or not.. the judgement will only be out next jan... when it's PLACEMENT TIME...

       NITIE had always been my dream b-school.. from the time my brother, who was then a student of the institute, told me abt it.. and showed some pictures.. it was unbelievable that such natural beauty cud exist right in the middle of Mumbai..   entering the gates, is almost like crossing a worm-hole (forgive the metaphysics).. u seem to be transported from a metropolis to a hill station in an instant.. what with the hilly landscape, the scenic pond near the hostels, the classrooms perched on the hill-top... and who can miss the vihar and powai lakes in their full glory..       most b-school campuses r incredibaly beautiful.. but u hardly get enough time to enjoy their beauty.. not the case with NITIE.. u can always squeeze some time to wander on the winding road to the top.. or lounge near the pond.. or disappear into the esoteric banks of Vihar lake..   but then, all is not fair and lovely in campus.. many hav spotted an unwanted tourist in the environs of NITIE, namely a leopard.. who's on the lookout for dinner at nights.. unfortunately, i hav not yet had the privilege of meeting this most elusive inhabitant of my b-school.. maybe someday i will.. but then, i may not be around to write abt my experiences in the blog next time...........

       got the idea to make a blog of my own from sallu.. it's gr8 way to express ur thoughts, and reflect on them down the line..   well, what shud i begin with... last 1 year has been quite sometime for me.. coming out of small cities like Bilaspur & Bhilai into the most happening city in the country.. sometimes i miss my BIT days.. but then, my days in NITIE hav been as eventful and enjoyable, if not more.. ther is much more to learn form my batchmates and the environment, than thru profs. and classes.. it's wonderful to be with people who u know, will be in the who's who lists in the future..   only 6 more months to go before placements.. then student life over.. end of the fun and games.. more responsibilities to take care of, more things to think about.. anyway, am looking forward to those days as well.. more in the next edition...

       NITIE hostels r one of the best in the country.. spacious rooms.. single occupancy.. attached bathrooms.. and if all that was not enough, my hostel has balconies with each room as well..  each hostel wing has 8 rooms.. sometime back, some of my batchmates came up with innovative names of their wings.. one was christened as ‘Banjara Hills’, another as ‘Raisina Hills’, and yet another as ‘Utopia’.. my wing is full of ingenious creatures as well.. so, one fine night, in the midst of our module exams, we decided to name our wing as well.. after lots of discussions and deliberations, we finally named our wing as ‘El Dorado’.. let me introduce u to all the residents of ‘El Dorado’ one by one..   Room 244.. Sabyasachi Ghosh.. a.k.a. “shabby”.. one of the chillax guys.. gr8 sports enthusiast.. has perpetual PC problems.. gives his own continuous commentary while watching cricket matches..  Room 243.. U. Tarun.. a.k.a. “gulti”.. occupies all posts of president available in NITIE.. roteract, CIE, spic macay and so on.. perpetually worried.. abt grades, girls and his receding hair line.. not unusual to find him, entering my room at 2.30 in the night to say, “am feeling dead sleepy man.. can u wake me up in an hour?”  Room 242.. Nikhil Kulkarni.. a.k.a. “boiler baba”.. hav already written a lot abt him.. will just add here that his nickname owes it’s origin to his habit of boiling over in agitation on the smallest of debatable topics.. and his seeming dis-interest in most worldly things..  Room 241.. Shubham Choudhury.. a.k.a. “CR”.. spends half his day sleeping.. and the other half, planning the class schedules for the rest of the week.. cracks crazy PJs all the time.. eats cricket, drinks cricket, dreams cricket...  Room 240.. Gaurav Khanna.. a.k.a. “GK”.. volunteers for everything under the sun.. gr8 at extra-curriculars.. has a rather dubious bulging belly.. has the incredible god-gifted ability to sleep and read novels right under the prof’s nose..  Room 239.. Anish Mathews.. a.k.a. “the boss”.. tall, dark, handsome.. knows the serial no. of each book in the library.. arguably the best quizzard in NITIE.. bowls over girls with his brand of dashing sincerity...  Room 238.. Mridul Dhanuka.. a.k.a. “MD”.. he’s the Ritchie Rich of the batch.. has the fairest and most painstakingly maintained complexion.. keeps more cosmetics than the entire girl’s hostel put together.. guess where he did his summers....... L'Oreal.. where else..&nbsp; Room 237.. Abhishek Khetan.. a.k.a. “AK47”.. the grand old man of NITIE.. worked for eons in Wipro.. even profs. treat him with respect.. has gr8 passion for photography..   “El Dorado” is a picture of unity in diversity.. we’ve got people of all ages, all CGPAs, various amts of hair on their heads, wide ranging creative competencies....... it might not be the “city of gold”, but it’s got something for everyone.. young or old....

       these days, the hottest topic of discussion in NITIE (apart from junior batch girls) is the leopard scare.. leopards hav always been frequent tourists to the NITIE campus, NITIE being just adjecant to the Sanjay Gandhi National Park.. and hav had the odd dog for dinner at times.. but in the last couple of weeks, they seem to hav had a change of taste.. they hav half-eaten 4 or 5 people in the envions of NITIE.....  the administration has swiftly moved into action.. traps hav been laid.. heavy patrolling started.. we’ve been asked to move in groups.. and late night strolls in campus hav be outlawed.. many of the junior batch guys r quite petrified.. if the leopard scare happened before their admission process, i wonder how many of them wud actually hav joined.....   as expected, the media has jumped on the story like a leopard as well.. both NDTV and Aaj-Tak were here tonight for on-the-spot reports.. they took interviews of 2 of our batchmates.. i somehow managed to squeak into the crowd in the background.. here’s hoping that my face got broadcast over cable television as well....

       am back in NITIE after 3 weeks of holidays.. it was probably the last time i will ever hav such a long vacation.. was in Bilaspur for 5 days, then in Hyderabad for the remaining time.. mom had a cataract operation to over ther.. everything worked out well...  while i was in Bilaspur, a family friend of ours, who is a good astrologer, visited our place.. and said some very interesting things after having a look at my horoscope.. am writing them down, for future reference.. so that i can check out whether what he said turns out to be true, some years down the line.... he said that my horoscope was a good’un.. with  budhaditya  (intelligence) and  mahalaxmi  (money) yogs.. will hav a good career.. and hav specially bright chances in management.. he strongly recommended that i sit for IAS at least once.. also said that i may get my 1st job in pune.. abt personal life, he said that my wife will be a working woman, who wud hav a younger brother settled abroad.. let’s see how correct these predictions turn out to be...  had nothing to do most of the time in Hyderabad.. so read quite a few books.. ‘Cosmos’ by Carl Sagan, was probably the best of the lot.. it was like 14 billion years of universal history rolled into one single book.. right from the sub-atomic to the inter-galactic.... ‘Odyssey: From Pepsi to Apple’ by John Sculley was another good’un.. gave some great insights into marketing.. from FMCGs to PCs.. ‘The Veteran’ was a collection of short stories by Fredrick Forsyth.. am a big fan of his.. so greatly enjoyed all the intrigue.. finally, ‘On The Other Side Of Midnight’ by Sydney Sheldon, was regular run-of-the-mill stuff..  had the chance to hang around a few places in Hyderabad.. Golcunda fort, Hussainsagar lake, Salarjung Museum, hi-tech city and so on.. went to big brother's sqwanky Oracle office in Cyber Enclave too.. and last but not the least, ate loads and loads of hyderabadi biryani.....  now it’s back to business.. time will be at a premium to the next 6 months.. till our placements.... it's the Final Countdown.....

       yesterday was one of the most satisfying days in recent times.. went to office early.. finished of the last rights of my summer project.. got the project completion certificate from my boss.. said ‘good bye’ to Bank of Baroda and returned to the hostel early.. this was my first stint in an organization.. enjoyed every second of the time i spent ther.. although i had very little to do, but was happy that my boss was satisfied with my work.. and not even once in the 2 months did he reject anything i did.. such bosses r in the endangered species list now.. hope that they do not become extinct....  my college roommate prayas came in the evening.. me and a few friends then went to watch “The Day After Tomorrow” in Fame Adlabs.. the movie was abt the catastrophic effects of global warming.. the world returns to another Ice Age and millions of lives r lost.. the special effects were mind-boggling.. but what really hit me was the concept.. hope that all the leaders of the so called developed countries see this movie and learn something from it..  then i chatted with prayas and nikhil throughout the night.. slept at 6.30am.. seems incredible how u lose track of the time scale completely when u r with ur close friends..  now am packing my bags to leave for bilaspur..  going home after 4 months.. seems more like 4 years.. clearly, there is no place like home..... my next blog entry will not come before 24th june.. when i am back in NITIE.. coz don’t hav a PC at home, as i brought it over to Mumbai.. hope that i will hav many things to write abt then..  just a final thought.. Summer of ’04 ended in the Ice Age.. :)

       being in a top notch institute has it’s perks.. sprawling campus, state-of-the-art infrastructure, great batchmates and so on.. but, the one thing that keeps most students hooked most of the time is a 4 letter word- ‘2mbps’.. that’s the speed of the internet lease line.. most of the time, all of us r online.. most of the studies, as well as most of the fun, takes place on the net..  the entire campus is on a 100mbps LAN.. all PCs, in hostels, in classrooms, in faculty rooms, in offices..are on the LAN.... thus, effectively, one can access any PC from anywhere on campus.. humongous amounts of data is transferred on the internal messenger (called ip messenger) daily.. doc files, pdfs, software setups, songs, movies.. u name it.. it’s on the lines.. the wired world helps us play some ingenious pranks too.. when a prof. declines to share his presentations with us, IT comes to the rescue.. all u hav to do is share the CD drive of the classroom PC on the LAN.. then copy all the presentations from ther to your hostel PC as the prof. teaches in class.. so u get all the stuff that was taught in class, without even attending it.. this is what i call ‘virtual education’.....  text and note books r on their way to obsolescence.. most of us tend to download pdf versions of textbooks from the net, rather than buying a hardcopy.. others don’t bother to read books at all.. just the MS Power Point slides used by profs. in class r enough.. and what if u hav a nagging doubt while studying??.... well .. all u hav to do is ‘multicast’ ur doubt on the ip messenger .. and voila.. in a few seconds.. u hav answers from all those who know..  it is very difficult to find an activity we perform without the help of the net.. wanna know bus routes of Mumbai?? wanna know which movie is playing in which multiplex?? wanna read newspapers or magazines?? wanna book a railway or air ticket?? wanna listen to the latest hit movie songs?? or wanna set an alarm so that u get up early in the morning?? ther is only one place to go.. near ur PC..  all important info. is sent thru mails.. and it is not unusual for someone to write 15-20 mails a day..  IT has it’s effect on work as much as it has on fun.. during my 2 months of summer internship, i’ve hardly ever carried anything to office.. whatever i did in office, i uploaded it on my yahoo briefcase at the end of the day.. and i cud continue the work from my room later.. but IT is taking it’s toll.. it has almost killed the reading habbits.. by conservative estimates, i spend 80% of my time in front of the comp, whenever i am in my room..   now for weirdest part.. me and nikhil live in adjacent rooms.. and hav a connecting door in between (which is perpetually open).. so in effect, we live in joint rooms..  so what does he do when he wants to give an important message to me late in the night, when i am already asleep?? write it on a piece of paper and leave it on my desk?.. no way.. he’ll mail it to me.. coz he knows that mail is the first thing i'll check as soon as i wake up......  "IT support is like a soft bed.. easy to get into.. but very difficult to get out of.."

       i am a happy-go-lucky kind of a chap.. and tend to be friendly with most people i meet..  so hav lots of friends all over the place.. today, i wud like to reflect on 4 of my best buddies.. how did we meet.. what similarities and differences in character we hav.. and why they r my best pals..  my oldest friend is manish saluja (sallu to his friends).. we studied together for a whopping 18 years (2 yrs-KG, 12 yrs-school, 4 yrs-college).. we hav been thru it all.. cracked PJs to all and sundry.. enjoyed ourselves during classes.. prepared for MBA together.... but 2 most enjoyable times were.. when we used to attend PET coaching classes.. and when we locked horns on the cricket field.. his humorous nature is very much similar to me.. but he’s a lot more hardworking and sentimental than i am.. i remember how hard he slogged for PET, and then for MBA.. i was perhaps as disappointed as he was, when he didn’t get a call from NITIE.. it robbed us of the chance to be together again..  then came prayas.. was my classmate in college.. had hardly talked to him in 1st year.. we appeared to be an odd combination.. i used to be seen as a nerd.. and he as a  farji .. so, he was very much surprised when i offered to be his roommate in 2nd year.. soon, it became clear to many that i was as  farji  as he was.. i still get nostalgic abt the countless miles we hav travelled together in his splendor in durg, bhilai and raipur.. hav shared many adventures.. prepared for GRE and MBA together.. discussed the intricacies of ‘Mahabharat’ throughout numerous nightouts.. and jointly teased the hell out of many of our classmates.. he is much more practical than me.. and a lot more forgetful as well..  saurabh shrivastava was someone completely different from me.. very sober, very sincere.. always attentive in class.. a great technical and logical mind.. but then, we had similarities as well.. both r very much interested in higher sciences.. astrology, astronomy, physics, philosophy and so on.. so we always enjoyed each other’s company.. we sat together for all 4 yrs of engineering.. prepared for GRE together.. and for a change, succeeded together as well.. he secured 2170, while I managed 2230..  nikhil is last on the list.. but he is one of a kind.. not many people r as passionate abt things as he is.. and not many r as IT savvy either.. he is probably the most intellectually competent of the 4.. again, we hav many similarities.. both wanna get into IT.. like the same type of music.. hav similar political and philosophical viewpoints.. he was in BIT too.. in electronics.. and his classroom was just next to mine.. it’s quite incredible therefore, that we never met in those days..   is there something common amongst all of us??.. yeah there is.. none of us hav any girl-friends........

       which is the subject each MBA student is expected to be most proficient at??... financial management, organizational behavior, consumer marketing?..... nope.. it’s the art of making and giving presentations..  not a single day of a b-school student passes without him seeing a power point presentation given by someone, or he making one himself.... all..well..almost all profs. use power point presentations in their lectures.. all assignments and projects r invariably terminated by a presentation.. presentations r the lifeblood of MBA education, and MS Power Point is the most useful software.. even during exams, most students prefer to skim thru the short and concise stuff given in power point slides, than delve into volumes of text books..   making a cogent presentation is an art in itself.. guys who r good at this have a definite advantage over those who r not.. just doing a good job is not enough.. convincing others that u have done a good job is more important.. hav seen guys win competitions simply on the basis of their brillient presentation skills.. it’s something which all MBAs strive to achieve.. after all, an MBA has only 2 all important assets.. his mouth and his PC.... if either of these is missing or malfunctioning, he is a dead duck....  many next generation softwares like flash, swish etc. can be used to bring in fanta-bulous text and graphical effects.. but the good old fashioned MS Power Point still remains an all time favourite.. as they say.. it’s  sasta, sundar, tikau ....  when I was in PT, preparing for MBA enterance, rohit girdhar used to tell us abt the importance of having a good personal folder.. he suggested that we give original tag-lines on the folder covers.. many guys came up with clichéd stuff like ‘in search of excellence’, ‘spectrum’ etc.... being my usual “pun”ny self, i decided to name my folder ‘Power Points’.... never knew that the word wud become such an integral part of my life in this way........

       it was abt 3 months back that sallu gav me the idea of creating a blog.. saying that blogging helps improve writing skills.... i’ve always enjoyed writing.. it didn’t take me long to come up with a blog of my own.. not as to better my writing skills, but just to reflect on the goings-on in my life.... since then, i hav been wandering into my mind space in this forum.. and it's been a most wonderful experience.... just thought, why not blog abt my blog today......  hav read blogs of many friends recently.. some like to share their feelings.. others, their ideas and philosophies.. and others just treat it as a daily log... what do i do?.. well.. a bit of all these.... i treat my blog at a real-time autobiography..  my blog has been gaining in popularity faster than i expected.. friends like sabya check it everyday.. people hav told me that they hit upon “my” blog while searching for “their” name in google.. coz i had mentioned their name somewhere along the line.. hav received some really touching comments from some of my mates.. although i don’t think i deserve half of the pleasantries they hav heaped on me.. but i will take them any day.....  for me, the blog is a wonderful way of writing what i feel, and feeling what i write.. these days, i can always find time to blog on a regular basis.. wonder if i’ll be able to sustain it as life rolls by.. but will definitely try to be at it for as long as i can.. maybe.. 20 or 25 years down the line, when i can look back at the stuff i’ve jotted down in these days.. i wud be able to reflect back on my experiences and thought processes of the present.. and ponder on how life had changed over the years......

       as i’ve written earlier, taking the interviews for team IMpact was a thought provoking experience.. today, i just feel like reflecting on the MBA entrance interviews that i appeared in a year and half back.. some of those experiences hav stuck with me ever since then.. i hav already written abt some of those previously, but ther were some others that i wud liked to pen-down today..   i had 5 gd/pi calls in all.. SCMHRD was the 1st on the list..&nbsp;went to pune to attend the process.. the day before, me and a friend hung around the place.. getting to know the students and the culture.. we were not impressed by what we saw.. i had imagined a b-school&nbsp;wud hav a sprawling campus.. here was a place where 3 b-schools were cramped into one building.. and what’s more, the rules and regulations were better suited to a kindergarten.. we decided that we wudn’t join even if we get thru..  as it turned out, we didn’t hav to bother.. both of us got kicked out after the gd phase itself.... so much for overconfidence......   XLRI was next in line.. went to jamshedpur for the interview.. i knew i had to crack it at any cost.. so had prepared well.. but i was hardly ready for what was going to transpire.. after the initial round of HR based questions, which i glibly circum-navigated, the panel decided to get dead technical... what is the time complexity of merge-sort? what r the various phases of compiler design? can u prove area of circle equal to pie-r-square?.. no sir.. sorry sir.. no sir.. sorry sir.. no sir........  i had messed up the interview big time.. that’s one big call wasted..   now to NITIE.. it was my only other big call.. simply cud not afford to make a hash of it again.. was dead tense.. after a decent performance in gd, i entered into the interview room..... to find abt 10 people sitting in front, ready to pounce on me.. the panel included the director of the institute too.. then the grilling began.. but this time, my fart-engine was fully loaded.. i managed to somehow dodge all bouncers,&nbsp;hitting the odd boundary along the way as well.... when i came out 35 minutes later.. i felt a really light on the left side of the chest.... as i left the NITIE, i remember myself looking back at the hostels and muttering “i’ll be back”......   next was IIT-Madras.. i don’t know why i had applied for it.. but i thought i might as well appear for the interview when i had a call.. just to hav a chance to visit Chennai if nothing else.. for a change, i was under no pressure.. gav the interview in a jolly mood... even the panel cud see the humorous side of it..  last in line was XIM-B.. had heard a few good things abt the college.. and the impression was reinforced when i went ther.. me and i classmate of mine had our interviews one after the other.. i was the 1st to go in.. the panel hardly seemed interested.. after a few run-of-the-mill questions.. i was out.. my classmate went in.. and he was asked exactly the same set of questions........   soon, the results were out.. i had made it to all 4 places... yes, XLRI too..... finally decided to go for NITIE, as&nbsp;i wud hav missed out on a full month of class in XL, due to my delayed engineering exams.. and NITIE was reputed to be better for IT.. so then.. i’m back..... indeed..........&nbsp;&nbsp;

       how is a MBA different form any other ordinary guy? well, for one, it’s his ability to think big.. and his confidence to achieve his dreams.. thru their 2 years of studies, if there is one thing form which all MBA students in NITIE learn most.. it’s something called “ Prerana ”.... “ Prerana ” is the annual NITIE mega-event.. showcasing the managerial talents of students across all major b-schools in the land.. in the form of the summer project contest, international business quiz, strategy games and so on..   when we first landed in NITIE, we realized that “ Prerana ” is the biggest thing in campus.. it’s in those 3 days of the event, that NITIE showcases itself to the business community at large.. it was an event whose scale was greater than anything most of us had ever seen, let alone organized.. i personally, was very much looking forward to the grand experience..   “ Prerana ” is&nbsp;held in mid-october.. for 3 days.. but the ground work for the extravaganza continues thru-out the year.. from conceptualization of events, netting in sponsors, scheduling operations and so on..... everything culminating in the ‘final showdown’, when abt 200 MBA students of NITIE work for days on end, without break, like a well oiled machine.. everything must move like clock-work.. there is no scope for the smallest goof-up.. the stakes r simply too high....   during “ Prerana 2003 ”, i was simply amazed at what a group of budding managers in their mid 20’s can achieve... the scale of operations was mind-boggling.. more than 1000 b-school students from all over the country descending in campus.. different events happening at different places at different times.... and&nbsp;if that was not enough, we had more than 100 corporate hotshots gracing the campus as well.. as guests, jury members, panelists and so on.. from politicians to entertainers, from CEO’s to technocrats.. they were all there..   each year “ Prerana ”&nbsp;ascends to a higher level.. if “ Prerana 2003 ” was big.. “ Prerana 2004 ” is gonna be bigger.. for the next 3 months, “ Prerana ” will be the most talked abt thing in campus.. last year, i was a small part of the organizational setup for the event.. this year, i hope to play a bigger role.. great things r planned for this year’s event.. we intend to do things no one even thought of till now.... together, we aim to boldly go where no b-school has ever gone before.......

       i am a laid back kind of a guy.. not one who wud go out of his way to take initiatives abt things that r not very important to me.. but over the years, i’ve somehow got into situations where i had to take on positions of responsibility.. the reasons being mostly academic.. and at times purely coincidental.. but once i entered the arena, i’ve always tried to give it my best shot..&nbsp;  &nbsp;  in middle school, our class teacher introduced a queer idea... the topper in the class wud be the monitor of the class as well... i&nbsp;used to be&nbsp;the topper in those days.. and thus, had to take on the job....  then in college, the same weird occurrence was repeated.. according to the rules of our university, the student representatives in the college student’s union were to be selected (not elected) on the basis of their ranks in class.... and one fine day, i found my name on the notice board.. as the representative from computer science..  finally to NITIE.. as i joined a week late, i cud not get into any committee.. so, was a free bird during the early days.. in late august 2003, shivnath resigned as Class Representative (CR) for section B.. no one (including me) was willing to take up his place.. but the class had to hav a CR.. so, the class had a secret voting to decide who wud be the next CR.. as it turned out, i got the highest votes.. and i was back doing something i never wanted or expected to do...  &nbsp;  i used to be really frustrated in the early days.. wasting my time listening to the blabber of profs. on the daily basis, when i cud hav engaged myself in some other productive work.. ther were times when i was kept engaged by profs. for hours.. just after returning from 2 back-to-back exams, with 2 more scheduled for the next day....&nbsp; collecting assignments was a big pain as well.. we students tend to believe in 2 dictums- “rules r meant to be broken, and deadlines r meant to be extended”.. it&nbsp;is not unusual to see not more that 50% people submitting their assignments on time, even after repeated ip calls r given.... am not blaming anyone here.. i myself am a lazy-bum, and tend to delay things till the last possible moment...... but those were frustrating times all the same....  &nbsp;  slowly but surely, i got the hang of it... and began to devise techniques to streamline operations.. one such technique: always talk to profs. on phone.. avoid meeting them in their room, unless absolutely essential.. saves a lot of time.. u need different strategies to deal with different profs... at times, u really need to conjure up all ur diplomatic skills to deal with tricky matters.. hav been lucky to hav gr8 co-CRs to work with.. earlier prashant and&nbsp;now anirudh hav been really brilliant... they’ve always helped me in conducting classes in a “coordinated and integrated manner”.. patience and people management hav been my biggest learnings over the last 10 months..&nbsp;  this post has also lead to my nickname "The Jackal".. as CR=  siar  (hindi)= Jackal..&nbsp;   as a CR (or any committee member for that matter),ur foremost goal is to preserve the interest of the batch at all costs.. i’ve tried to keep this in mind all along.. i don’t know how far i’ve succeeded in this endeavor.. comments abt my performance r invited from all batchmates who read this blog....

       if ther is something&nbsp;i enjoy doing most, it’s sleeping.. for me, a day consists only of abt 14 hrs..&nbsp;the remaining 10 hrs being&nbsp;permanently reserved as my sleeping time.. and under no circumstances do&nbsp;i allow any other activity to encroach into my moments of rest.. an afternoon nap is as much part of my daily routine as any other natural activity.. sleep comes first.. exams, assignments, presentations, sports, games, travel.... everything can wait..... till&nbsp;i wake up.........  &nbsp;&nbsp;  in &nbsp;school and college, ther used to be regular time-zones when&nbsp;i used rest in peace.. but for the last 1 year, my sleeping cycles hav been turned upside down.. literally..&nbsp;earlier, i rarely, if ever, saw the sunrise.. in the last year, i’ve seen it many times.... before&nbsp;i go to sleep that is.....  &nbsp;  b-school students are nocturnal creatures.. never sleep untill early morning.... ya.. they must be slogging it out all the time&nbsp;for assignments and tests.. right?.. wrong.. nothing cud be further from the truth.. staying awake all night is a part of b-school culture.. it goes into ur system as soon as u land in one of these weird places.. whether u hav some work to do or not, u just don’t sleep early.. u play games, surf the net, chat with friends, read books, watch films... but u do not sleep....&nbsp;  &nbsp;  so, how does one account for this sleep budget deficit?.. what r classes meant for.. all u hav to do is to strategically position urself in an inconspicuous corner of the classroom, select a suitable posture (which makes others feel that u r reading ur notebook), and comfortably wander into dreamland.... ther r a few guys (and girls) in my batch who hav&nbsp;perfected this into an art-form.. who can doze off right under the noses of the prof. with consummate ease.. and if that was not enough, wake up all of a sudden and ask the most incisive of doubts..&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;  i wish&nbsp;i cud be in their league.. but i&nbsp;never manage to sleep in class.. and thus&nbsp;tend to carry the sleep in my eyes back to my room.. where&nbsp;i sleep at all sorts of odd hours.... but make no mistake.. rain or shine.. never once hav&nbsp;i betrayed my commitment of 10hrs-a-day slumber.. wonder what will happen when&nbsp;i get into a job.. wud&nbsp;i be able to become a normal human being again?? or&nbsp; hav my sleeping cycles been incorrigibly convoluted??.. only time will tell..&nbsp;for the time being.. it’s good bye and good night...........

       it is in gr8 pain that&nbsp;i sit here to write this blog tonight.. gr8 pain in the butts.. it’s my b’day today.. and in true engineering and b-school tradition,&nbsp;i've&nbsp; just been subjected to the most inhuman attack from behind..... not that&nbsp;i am complaining..&nbsp;i myself hav been guilty of perpetrating this heinous offence on many of my friends.. what u give is what u get.. it was my turn to be on the receiving end today.... unfortunately......&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;  i knew beforehand, that&nbsp;i was in for a bump-y ride .. as is it,&nbsp;i hav a wiry frame, and don’t hav too much cushion on my posterior end..&nbsp;so,&nbsp;had taken all the precautions&nbsp;i cud.. wore 4 undies and a thick jeans, just to soften the impact of the blows somewhat.. but an umbrella can’t help u in a hurricane.. the precautions proved woefully inadequate.. as boot after boot of each batchmate crash-landed on my seat, all i cud do was hope that i somehow manage to save my ass.... literally......&nbsp;  &nbsp;  later, some of my closer friends got a cake for me.. and after the customary cake make-up on the b’day boy’s face, it was time for some photo-ops.. nikhil, dutta, tappu, medda, anish, khanna, khetan, ashita, payal, sabya.. they were all there..&nbsp;  i am used to sedate b’day celebrations.. just between family members.. this was the first time that so many people were involved in my b’day..&nbsp;i wont forget this day in a hurry.. atleast not as long as&nbsp;i feel the pain whenever i sit :)....&nbsp;  &nbsp;  birthdays come and go.. life moves on.. these r days which remind u that life does not hav a rewind button… once u cross the landmark, ther is no way of going back.. so, u might as well enjoy each second.. reminds me of the song- “ zindagi ke safar mein guzar jate hain jo mukam, woh phir nahi aate, woh phir nahi aate ”........

       i&nbsp;joined NITIE one week late.. due to the delayed completion of my final semester engineering exam.. when&nbsp;i joined,&nbsp;i almost felt like an outsider.. everyone knew each other, friend circles had been formed..&nbsp;i took me sometime to get into the groove..  one of the 1st guys&nbsp;i came in contact with was a creature by the name of Shubhrangsu Dutta.. his incredibly rare name catching my attention.. our friendship began to grow, as we were team-mates in most of the assignments..&nbsp;with his name&nbsp;being next to mine in the roll list..&nbsp;  &nbsp;  dutta cud be easily mistaken for a malnutritioned kid from Somalia.. short heighted, dark and as thin as a bean....&nbsp;he's got&nbsp;a custic sense of humour as well..&nbsp;can really tease the wits out of a person.. but only when u&nbsp;get to know&nbsp;him well, do u realize that inside the wiry happy-go-lucky exterior, lies a tough, determined and very knowledgeable soul.. he's been one of the most proactive members of Rotaract from the beginning..&nbsp;slogs it out&nbsp;for each of their endeavors.. he doesn't hav a PC.. but always completes his part of assignments on time..&nbsp; and does a good job of it too.. once, when he had just 1 hour to prepare for the communication skills presentation, he gav the most brilliant one imaginable under those circumstances, digging deep into his vast reserves of GK.. i was flabbergasted by his performance.. and i was not alone..   during our summer internship interviews,&nbsp;he used to tell me that he wud be the last one to get thru.. but&nbsp;i believed that once dutta gets shotlisted for the gd/pi process of a company, no one cud stop him from getting selected.. and&nbsp;i was proven dead right..&nbsp; he got thru on the morning of day&nbsp;0 itself.. in nestle..&nbsp;  &nbsp;  then came the reshuffle in&nbsp;the student placement committee.. dutta stood for the election reluctantly.. he never expected to get elected.. (nor did he want the job).. but it is a tribute to the batch’s faith in his abilities that he got thru with one of the highest votes.. he's been working his heart out for our placements ever since ....&nbsp;  &nbsp;  our batch is full of people with exceptional abilities.. but ther r a select few whom&nbsp;i really admire.. dutta is one of them..  the way things r going, he might turn out to be one of the biggest unsung heroes of our commuNITIE.....

       Parties r as much a part of life in a b-school as Powerpoint.. most b-schools hav parties at regular intervals.. times when students forget abt assignments, presentations, tests, quizzes.. to just freak out and enjoy themselves.. NITIE is no exception.. we too hav dance parties off and on.. a DJ is called.. fancy lighting arranged.. food and drinks served.. and as the rhythm catches on, everyone descends on the dance floor....&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;  i was never a party animal.. and was as good a dancer as a cow (my friends in college wud vouch for it).. so, it took me&nbsp;a while&nbsp;to adapt to the “new” culture.. but soon,&nbsp;i began to enjoy it..&nbsp;i realized that it is&nbsp;ur enthusiasm that matters, not ur deft footwork.. nowerdays, i m one of the most active dancers in the gang.. freaking out with my own brand of weird movements... but then, as long as&nbsp;i m enjoying myself, who cares.....&nbsp;  &nbsp;  we had a fresher party last night as well.. we danced for almost 4 hours..&nbsp; upto 3 am.. am till suffering form the hangover.. with aches and pains in all the over-gyrated parts of the body.. still,&nbsp;i believe that partying has helped improved my fitness levels..&nbsp;i generally don’t get fatigued as quickly these days, as&nbsp;i used to do earlier....&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;  with only 6 odd months to go before my student life is finished once and for all,&nbsp;i realize that ther won’t be many opportunities for fun and games once&nbsp;i enter the corporate jungle.. so&nbsp;i might as well enjoy it while it lasts....&nbsp;   the parting note—“work hard, party harder"......

       i hav previously written abt my college days in the blog.. just thought, why not write something abt the school days as well.. i wud really be stretching the neurons to get some of the details.. anyway, here it goes....   i was born in raipur, my maternal grandfather’s place.. and spent my entire childhood in bilaspur.. the 2 cities were just 110 kms apart.. dad was working as a GM with South Eastern Coalfields Ltd., (a subsidiary of Coal India, and the biggest public sector coal company in the country).. mom was a Professor of Economics in a govt. college..   always hated going of school and attending classes (a habit which has refused to desert me over the years).. used to cry the hell out in order to avoid going to school in nursery and KG.. mom really had a tough time persuading me to go..   my school was called Bharat Mata Eng. Med. Hr. Sec. School.. quite a weird name for a missionary school.. but it was the best one around in bilaspur in those days.. none of my school friends used to live anywhere near my place.. interaction with friends was limited to the school only.. so, used to spend most of my evenings playing cricket with my servant, in the backyard..  my favourite comic was Tintin.. i've read each of his adventures many times over.. and till date, hav the entire collection of Tintin comics well preserveed with me..   school was from 7.25 am.. the SECL school bus, used to leave at 6 in the morning.. so had to get up early.. and almost everyday, i used to fall asleep while coming back from school (again, it’s something that has remained with me.. i still tend to doze off whenever i travel in a four wheeler).. the school bus used to circumnavigate the entire city, picking students from 3 other schools on the way back.. it used to take an hour to be back home.. whenever i was not asleep, i used to utilize my time in the bus finishing off my homework.. people thought that i was crazy to do homework in the bus.. but what they didn’t realize was that finishing off the homework in the bus left the entire evening free, when i cud play and hang around.. while all others slogged it out with books.......

       my parents always laid gr8 stress on studies.. they wanted me to be the best in class.. always.. when i look back, i feel i wudn't hav done half as well as i did in studies, had it not been for their constant motivation.. coz i really am a lazy bum.. an ardent believer in “the minimum effort, maximum output” philosophy....  they really expected me to be in the merit list in the board exams of std. 5th.. and were deeply disappointed when they saw that i wasn’t.. more than the failure of not making it, i was disappointed at not living up to their expectations.. one day, i promised mom that i wud never be anything but 1st in my remaining school life.. it was a promise that i not only delivered upon throughout the remaining 7 years of school, but also carried forward to my college days as well.. over the next 11 years and 35 exams, i was 2nd in class only once, that was in 7th semester in college......  if ther was one place i loved.. it was raipur.. i used to spend all my holidays (long or short) ther.. mingling with my grandma, uncle, aunts and cousins.. all my cousins were older than me.. but we used to hav a gr8 time.. today, we r dispersed across various parts of the country, and abroad.. but we still r as close, if not more, as real siblings..    we used to hav loads of fun amongst friends in school too... always making fun of each other.. always pulling each others legs.. had some gr8 friends during that time.. some, like sallu, r still around in my life.. others, like kaushal, debashish, pratyush, shrirang etc. hav disappeared slowly.. wherever they r.. hope that they still remember me.. maybe someday i will meet them again.. but will we be able to recognize each other ??  after my high school exams, it was time for the big decision.. medical vs. engg.... mom and dad wanted me to be a doc. .. but i was more inclined towards maths.. so engg. it was.... then the preparation for PET started.. i.e. was supposed to start.. being my lazy self, i hardly attended the coaching classes which i enrolled for.. and whenever i did go, it was more fun than studies.. with sallu, imran, shrirang, paras around.. then one fine morning, in jan 1999, really struck me.... 4 months to go for PET.. and i was as much prepared for it as my maid servant.. i really had to get a move on.. but no matter how hard i tried, my preparation never got out of 2nd gear.. i was never quite able to conquer my laziness..  i still havn’t.... again, i bitterly disappointed my parents with a lowly rank of 914 in PET.. when they had expected me to be in the top 200.. but i cud still get into branches like mechanical, electrical etc. in some RECs.. but i finally decided to go for  BIT computer science.... and the next chapter of the saga began.........

       when i had come to NITIE for my admissions gd/pi, the one thing i really liked was the involvement of the then current students of NITIE, in the gd/pi process.. starting before the gd/pi process kicked off, with a presentation abt NITIE.. then helping out  all candidates throughout the day, scheduling and rescheduling interviews, keeping them entertained by showing movies in the auditorium, clearing many of the doubts and worries of the candidates and so on.... i thought, if i make it to NITIE, i wud definitely volunteer to do the same for my juniors next year....  when i finally joined NITIE, i came to know that there was a student committee called team IMpact, that was responsible for coordinating the admissions process.. i cudn’t join IMpact, (or any other committee for that matter) coz i joined late due to my final sem engg. exams.. i just hoped that i cud volunteer next year to help out team IMpact from the outside, in some small way.. but i hardly expected what was going to happen....  in late 2003, NITIE decided to align with CAT.. that year, CAT paper got leaked.. CAT got rescheduled to february 2004.. and dates for NITIE gd/pi were shifted to 1st week of may.. starting on the 5th.. now, may is the time when all b-schools hav their summer internships.. as it turned out, none of the IMpact members were in Mumbai at that time.. they desparately wanted some people to volunteer and coordinate the entire gd/pi process.. this job eventually came on my, nikhil’s and anish’s shoulders, as we all were doing our summers in Mumbai.. now i was incharge of the very process i hoped to be only a small part of....  from the onset, we knew we were up for some rough times.. the gd/pi process was being conducted during our summer internships.. 2/3rds of the batch was not in Mumbai.. even those who were, had to be in office throughout the day.. we ourselves had to attend office daily.. arranging a minimum of 8 volunteers on each day, for 4 consecutive days of gd/pi was a monumental task.. no one was willing to skip work for this purpose.. so, we embarked on a massive manpower sourcing campaign.. sending a barrage of personal e-mails and ip messages,  meeting batchmates personally and requesting them to take a day off each.. no stone was left unturned...   when the manpower problem appeared to get sorted, the administration decided to pester us.. they wanted a common presentation for all 3 batches (IM, IE, ISEM).. we somehow managed to dodge this weird idea of their’s as well..  now for the making of the presentation itself.. we decided that the old IMpact presentation was not good enough.. so, we needed to make a new one form scratch.. it took us 3 sleepless nights to get it done, the final version getting ready just 2 hrs before the gd/pi process was scheduled to start.. at 6 am on the morning of 5th may....

       now it was time for action.. we needed to market NITIE like anything to get the best students.. specially since most of them carry many mis-conceptions abt the institute.. apart from that, we needed to keep candidates entertained while they were waiting for their interviews.. we decided to screen movies in the auditorium as well as syndicate rooms.. converting the admin. block into a temporary multiplex :) .. we also kept chatting with them all along, just to ease the tension somewhat.. the gd/pi process got over without any major glitches.. now the next phase of admissions was abt to begin....  results were out in 12 hrs.. there were still one and half months to go, before the new batch landed in NITIE.. soon they formed their e-grp.. and requested some seniors to join in as well, to answer their queries.. me and nikhil had to do the honours again.. we used to spend hrs, on a daily basis, answering their e-mail queries, which ranged from the incisive to the irritating, and to the downright amusing..when we left for home after our summers, we passed the baton to the IMpact members.. taking a well-earned break..  when i was back in NITIE, the new batch had just arrived.. i gav them a presentation as the Class Representative.. the juniors were extremely happy at the arrangements, and the way the senior batch had welcomed them into the fold.. then team IMpact invited me and nikhil to be a part of the interview panel to select the IMpact members from the junior batch, since we had been in charge of the admissions process.. taking someone’s interview was an intriguing experience.. after giving so many interviews over the last year, it was fascinating to be on the other side.. and i spent most of my energies trying to figure out what goes inside an interviewee’s mind.. hope that this experience from other side of the fence will help me perform better in interviews in future....   and the most moving incident was saved for the last.. a girl from junior batch had applied to team IMpact, and cleared the 1st round of interviews.. just before the 2nd round, she came and told us that  she was no more interested in IMpact, and wud like to get in another committee, as one of her seniors told her that she cud gain more out of being in the other committee.. we did not take this lightly, and really grilled her during the interview, asking her why she let her opinions be influenced by just one person’s views.. she was very much disturbed when she left the interview.. now we had to make the big decision.. rejecting her from IMpact wud hav been the obvious choice.. but we realized that the girl had been honest with us, and we shud respect that.. it wud hav been very easy for her not to turn up for the interview at all.. but she did.. also, we knew that the committee she wanted to get into had not selected her..  thus, after much deliberation, we selected her in IMpact.... when we were abt to leave, after all interviews got over, we saw her coming back.. she had come back to apologize for her action, and said that she had thought long and hard after the interview, and realized her mistake.. this was the 1st decision she had to make in her life, and she had messed it up.... she cudn’t believe it when we told her that we had selected her already.... when we left the room, all of us felt this was an experience we wud not forget in a hurry......  as i sit back today to conclude my involvement with IMpact, i feel gr8 satisfaction within.. not only was i able to do something i loved to do, and do it well.. i was also able to hav a peep into the human side of life.. we had made an impact, and got impacted ourselves as well......

       hav read some really incisive management books lately.. “Goal” and “The Mckinsey Way”.. both stress on the importance of clarity of thought and vision, well chalked out strategy and thorough implementation.. the 1st important thing is to know what u want to achieve.. as the saying goes.. “if u don’t know where to go, any way will take u ther”.. it makes me think, what is the goal of our lives?.. what do we all live for?.. is ther anything we want to achieve in our lives? if yes, can that thing be expressed in terms of some tangibles? if i am able to find answers to some of these questions, i may be in a better position to identify the destination of my life.. and only then can i work diligently towards reaching ther.. it’s a tough task.. but one definitely worth undertaking....  lets start small.. defining what my objective of undertaking the MBA in NITIE is..... “to learn stuff that will help me perform better in my professional life... and to secure a managerial position in a top IT firm, with as fat a paycheck as possible”.. that’s abt it.. all my academic efforts during this period shud ideally be aimed at achieving this objective.. whether they r or not is another matter.. which i wud rather not discuss at this juncture..  what do i want to achieve in my professional life?.. “to rise to such decision making positions where my ideas can shape the future roadmap of my organization”.. i wud prefer to work in a project based environment, where no assignment is exactly the same as the last one.. and each task offers a new challenge.. what abt the entire life put together? “to lead a challenging professional and a comfortable personal life, and to grow continuously as a person, learning new and disparate things along the way”..  hav come up with the above statements after a lot of introspection.. after factoring in all my abilities, strengths, weaknesses and interests, as i see them...... so, the vision and mission r in place.. now comes the tough part.. going abt achieving the goal.. hav no idea as to what the future has in store.. but am reasonably confident abt achieving most of what i’ve laid down in front of me...... wud like to end on a sidduism, quite apt in this context, which incidentally is also my motto in life... “you r not remembered for aiming at the target, you r remembered for hitting it”......
