						   Alright so for the last little while I have spent some serious time reading some of my friends' blogs (by the way, if anyone knows what exactly "blog" means, I would love the info.)  At first, I was a little put off...I mean at the end of the day isn't a blog a self-indulgent version of a diary. Why should I assume that my friends and family (and the rest of the internet world for that matter) want to know the secrets of my heart. However, after a great deal of deliberation, I decided that this might be a really good way to keep in touch with people who are far away and to do some venting.   So here I am, my very first blog post. I'd like to tell you all that I have something interesting to say but I don't.  I guarantee you that on Monday (Federal Election day) I will. So until then, I'm going to try to figure out how this infernal thing works.   And that's the way it was today.  Zita

						   So I have this job that works with kids...at least that's how I usually describe it.&nbsp; Problem is, these aren't your average kids.&nbsp; Or, at least they aren't what I would have described as average when 'I' was a kid.&nbsp; Most of these kids have learning disabilities, ridiculously high energy, some pretty serious behavioral issues and some pretty dire home-life situations.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some are wealthy, most are poor.&nbsp; Some have two parents, most have one.&nbsp; Some have three square meals a day, most survive primarily on the snack provided to them midday.  I have never claimed to be good with kids. I'm not a teacher, or even an Ed student.&nbsp; I'm not compassionate or kind-hearted&nbsp;or any of the things you'd expect people working with kids to be.&nbsp; My motto used to be: Whoever would give me a job working with kids is a fricken&nbsp;moron. I'm caustic, I'm harsh, I'm a walking nutcase...and right about now, I'm&nbsp;the best thing to ever happen to these thirty kids aged 8-17.&nbsp; Why,&nbsp;you ask?&nbsp; Because, unlike&nbsp;so many people in the world, I care.&nbsp;&nbsp;And that simple fact alone has allowed me to accomplish the impossible; I've been let into their world.&nbsp; And surprisingly enough, it isn't the black that I expected it to be.&nbsp; It's actually as multi-coloured as a rainbow.&nbsp; But like a rainbow, sometimes you have to work in order to see it.&nbsp;   This summer is seriously making me think about the state of our children.&nbsp; Perhaps I lived a&nbsp;sheltered life, but it seems to be that&nbsp;life is&nbsp;becomming increasingly difficult to bear.&nbsp;&nbsp;Far too often, the ones left behind are the children.&nbsp; I mean&nbsp;really, who benefits the most from welfare&nbsp;program,&nbsp;social services, health care and&nbsp;education?&nbsp; Our youth.&nbsp; So, as we systematically slay each of these&nbsp;programs one by one, the&nbsp;biggest casualties of the Albertan political war are the ones most forgotten.&nbsp; &nbsp;  We tend to view the state of our children as collateral dammage.&nbsp; We want to pass the buck off to whoever we can hold responsible. Parents, teachers, government- no one is to blame.&nbsp; But, in truth, aren't we all a little to blame?   A social worker came and visited my site a few days ago and asked the kids: What is one good thing that you can do to improve the state of the world.&nbsp; I was the last to answer, and my answer was simple.&nbsp; "I am doing the one thing that I can to improve the state of the world. I am here, reaching out to our most valuable assets: our children."   So, today's word of advice: Cherish the children, they'll be the ones taking care of you when you're a senior.&nbsp; Take the time to play, if only for a few minutes, with a child as often&nbsp;as you can. And never, never think of children as being a waste of time-&nbsp;&nbsp;sometimes they are the only things worth making time for.  Livin' it up,  Zita&nbsp;
