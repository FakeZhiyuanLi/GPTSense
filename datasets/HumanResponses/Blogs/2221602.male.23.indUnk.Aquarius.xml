      right, after checking wards blog i went to the 'Which Biological Molecule Are You?' website and this is what i got...     You are water. You're not really organic; you're neither acidic nor basic, yet you're an acid and a base at the same time. You're strong willed and opinionated, but relaxed and ready to flow. So while you often seem worthless, without you, everything would just not work. People should definitely drink more of you every day.    urlLink   Which Biological Molecule Are You?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla    anyway, went boarding yesterday on possibly some of the best pow i've found yet...kept getting stuck though which is always funny.   One of the girls that i live with was bored at work so i suggested that she read my blog if she got desperate...she did read it and then complained that i hadn't mentioned the people that i live with...so here goes, and if any of you are offended by what i'm about to write then blame suze...  Anna: Is going out with Matt (see below) who she met at uni in Southampton. Really nice girl but has a strange fixation with booties and elk poo... she's a skier, but says she's gonna learn to board...she works in rentals at sunshine.  Anna Rose: Is one of the first people i met out here. she was on my flight out and we met in the cue at immigration...she's a boarder, and she's better than me...she also works in rentals at sunshine.  Cat: One of the 5 girls that are from liverpool uni...Cat feels the need to mock and abuse me at every given opportunity...but she's not very good at it...soon to be a boarder but has only had a few goes at it...she works in customer services at sunshine.  Lucy: Also one of the Liverpool girls...works at one of the rental shops in town...is also a skier, but hey, nobody is perfect.  Matt: Annas bloke...good lad, but finds it hard to admit that boarders are better than skiers...he says he's gonna learn to board, but knows he'll prefer it and that will mean that i have won, which he wont let happen!..he also works in rentals at sunshine.  Nat: Another liverpool girl..Nat copes very well with her disability of being short...she tried boarding for the first time the other week and loved it...she works making beds and folding toilet paper into a little triangle at the sunshine hotel on resort.  Nick: Friends with Matt and Anna from uni...after nicks first lesson he went out and bought a board, good lad...he's becoming my boarding buddy, which is cool cause like me, he rides goofy...he works evening shifts as a waiter at one of the hotels.  Sam (boy): I met Sam on the flight over to Canada...it was his 19th b'day on thursday and he got suitably drunk...he's gonna be a boarder, as soon as he gets the hang of it, but is leaving us in Feb to go to south america...he had a job, but left, so know he dosses like me!  Sam (girl): Again a liverpool girl...works on the busses that take people to sunshine...very useful person to know...has tried skiing once, but i reckon could easily be converted.  Suze: The final Liverpool girl...she's very Monica from friends...likes the house to be very tidy and gets pleasure from cleaning it...works at the ski school at sunshine, and also lost and found and keeps coming home with new gloves and scarfs...has had a boarding lesson so soon will be another one of the crew.  right, that's everyone that i live with...can't think of any other news at the mo...

      Right, it's thursday today, and today is Sams birthday and he is 19...wish i was 19 again...so we went up to lake louise to get some boarding in. the boarding was ok, but the snow was shit and mainly ice! but most importantly, the world cup downhill is this weekend at lake louise and i saw the run, infact, i boarded down some of it...if any of you really want to then,if you can, check out ski sunday, if it's on, and see just what it's like where i am! the last bit of the course (the bit where the finish line is) that's the bit i've boarded down!  still no job, but i'm working on it.  i'm going out on the super piss tonight for sams b'day so mucho fun and games i feel..i'll let you know the consequences...

      OK, as promised, here is the photo of the snowcar that me and nick made...  (there used to be a picture here but i've been busted doing something i shouldn't have been! so i'm gonna try again another way...but kesh, i'm still better than you!)  ...this also proves that although kesh is trying to be like me and become the stand-in computer geek, he still can't get photos into a blog and i can!!!

      hello my devoted readers...  ...yesterday was job day...and you know what happens on job day? well, let me tell you...i don't get a job...that's all that happens on a job day, i try, and i fail, to get a job...tomorrow's also a job day.  today however, was not a job day, today was a boarding day. all in all it wasn't a bad boarding day, except for the part where my fleece scarf froze to my face! that wasn't good, but the rest was.  I've also been trying to talk canadian...and thoseof you that know me well, know that i'm shite at dodgy languages! but for those of you that want to learn here is what i have picked up...  EVERY sentence must end with the word..."ay" (as in the first letter of the alphabet "A") eg. the pow is good today AY? or, that was a sick 900 AY!  also if you can't be bothered to form a sentance, the phrase "for sure" will suit any occasion... eg. "you had a good day boarding AY?"     " For sure" or "that girls rough AY?"     "For sure"  you also have to be nice...very very nice...people will just talk to you in the street...and not a drunken..."spare any change please"...but actual conversations...these people actually care how you are today...why, i don't know, but they do!  if i manage to find out any more about acting canadian i'll be sure to let you know!

      it's official people...at -18 when your nose starts to run your snot freezes to your face! Grim i know, but i thought it essential to point out. supposed to be going round to one of the lads houses to watch the rugby with a load of ozzys but it's not on till 2:30am or something stupid and by that time it's supposed to be -24, so i'd rather not.  today i realised i've finally hit rock botoom in terms of finding a job...i'm writing to an architects firm in banff!! for those of you that know me well enough you know how truly low that is! all this way and i may still end up beating my chest going ooohh ooohh ooohh in true CAD monkey fashion.  todays spending involves some base cleaner, a sharpening stone and some board clamps...and the board clamps, as complex as they sound, are nothing more than 8 suck pads that stick to a table to hold my board while i wax it. talking about waxing, i watched finding nemo again last night (a good watch if u've not seen it) and i realised that i really want to talk like the turtle.  i also managed to make Nick buy a board today! his mrs is gonna kill him cause she's coming over for christmas and all he can afford now is to take her out for a maccy d's!!...hell, if i don't get laid, no one gets laid!

      OK...so i found the powder. it was right outside my front door...4ft of powder to be precise! Apparently it snows here...a lot!  After spending a day carving an actual size sports car out of snow (photos to follow...it was fucking amazing) i decided i would head to the hills for some boarding.  So of we went, waist deep in snow, to Sunshine Village (the resort that didn't want me!! in fact, none of the resorts want me!). Now, those of you that know me well, know that i haven't actually been boarding all the long and i've only done 2 days since i've been here. nowhere near enough time for me to pick it up again, but anyhow of we went to the top of a mountain on possibly one of the coldest chair lifts i've ever sat on, now, a run that i should have been able to do in approximatly 10mins...took us about 2 and a half hours...the reason for which can only be explained in one simple sentance...  'it is actually physically impossible for a fat fuck like me to walk through snow that reaches up to my shoulders!'  Once we managed to finnaly get down, we chose a better groomed run and i had possibly one of the best days yet! i've finaly remembered how to board!!!  so much so that it's all i want to do everyday...although that is still made slightly difficult by the fact i still have no job...man i'm such a drop out!  Anyway, this afternoon we're gonna try and carve a boat out of snow so i better go. laters

      So, there we were, on the way back from the 'english' pub called 'the pump and tap' (i use the term 'english' VERY loosly!) and there over the hills are the northern lights!!!  For those of you that don't know the 'Northern lights' (AKA 'Aurora Borealis') is where the sun gives off high-energy charged particles (also called ions) that travel out into space at speeds of 300 to 1200 kilometres per second.  A cloud of such particles is called a plasma. The stream of plasma coming from the sun is known as the solar wind. As the solar wind interacts with the edge of the earth's magnetic field, some of the particles are trapped by it and they follow the lines of magnetic force down into the ionosphere, the section of the earth's atmosphere that extends from about 60 to 600 kilometres above the earth's surface. When the particles collide with the gases in the ionosphere they start to glow, producing the spectacle that we know as the auroras, northern and southern. The array of colours consists of red, green, blue and violet.  anyway, there we were, looking up at this, pissed, and a cop car pulls up...now just so u know, Banff is the sort of place that has it's own paper that, every week, has a number in the paper of how many people spent the night in the local prison for being 'intoxicated' in the street...so there i was, about to become another statistic, and one of the other lads decided that it would be a good idea to approach the cop car and explain that we were English and that we'd never seen them before. as he approached the cop car the brightest light in the world switched on from the top of the car and this deap canadian voice from behind the light said 'step away from the car'  suddenly i had visions of them jumping out, shotguns in hand, and going all code 4 on us. (for those of you that don't know, code 4 is something that is said by american cops...i have no idea what it means!)...but they didn't, it all got resolved and we went home to bed.  yesterday i went boarding at sunshine for the first day of their season! it was quite a good day...although i'm still finding it difficult to remember how to board! but i've got plenty of time to remember! anyway, i still have no job, but i've just been informed that some lifty has put his knee out so i'm about to go and try and get his job!!!

      Right,  well it's obvious that i can't maintain a blog as it's been almost 2 weeks since my last post...oh well...it's not the first time I’ve experienced failure…yes people, I still have no job!  All I want is to stand on the side of some freezing cold hill and say ‘have a nice day’ to people. But it seems that a prerequisite for this would be either being a chick, or have previously worked on a resort before.  Now, I’m not sexist, BUT, 50% of the lefties are chicks…50%?!! Are they taking the piss? All the girls I’ve met so far tend to wear the following, 2 pairs of socks, thermal trousers with salopets over them, at least 3 t-shirts covered by a fleece, a hoody and a ski jacket, a hat, a scarf, 2 pairs of gloves AND THEY STILL WINGE ABOUT BEING COLD!!! And these girls are supposed to stand out in –30 and be friendly!!!!!!!! NO, Sorry, I don’t buy it!! Some will be able to do it, some will be good at it…but 50%? Ur having a laugh?! And that’s just the English girls…the ozzy chicks haven’t even seen snow before!!  But I’m not bitter!  But at least I’ve moved into the house now, which is loads better than being in the hostels.  Anyhow, I’m now gonna go buy some food so I can actually eat at the house rather than having pizza every night from the local take-a-way place.

      hi there,  ok, i know it's been a while since i've written here but it's the festive season and i've been busy!!  Crimbo was quite cool...we had a big dinner with 16 of us...there was shit loads of food...but as the vegi selection out here is as about as good as naked women wrestling without any mud, i had to make do with a plate full of small filo parcel hours dourves...about 20 in total!! but it was all good.  went boarding on christmas day too...that was quite cool. loads of people boarding dressed in santa outfits! what more could u ask for? and it snowed!  not a lot else really, went to Calgary for a couple of days to see my relatives and get some decent food.  built an igloo in the front garden...but think we were a bit too ambitious and the thing is  huge . think we're gonna build it again but a bit smaller so we can actually get a roof on it!  not sure what we're doing for new year but i think we're crashing some house parties which should be fun. i'll let u know all the goss when it happens!

      right, so on the way back from boarding today the bus had to stop at the railway crossing for a train...  no word of a lie, the train had 113 caridges...each caridge was at least 10m long...you do the math! it was a fucking long train!  Nick did his first jump today...looked good...i've still not quite got the balls to try one yet, but will soon.  i'm starting to get more confident at speed as well...but for some reason i'm getting really bad cramps in my foot, something to do with my footbed or my bindings, not sure really.  OK, this blog is really dull so i'll go before i start telling you wat i had for tea last night!  (i had these potato skins with cheese and broccoli if u really want to know)

      ok, so i wake up this morning, turn on the TV watch some science program about turbo chargers and computer graphics and then start channel flicking through the 60 or so channels we have....after about 40 something channels of shite i hit a news channel...turns out Saddams been caught...first i heard of it...so i go in search of a more news worthy channel...you know how i don't even like the channel 5 news cause the reporters sit on the wrong side of the desk...anyway, turns out we dont get any decent news channels like cnn or bbc world, so luckly a mate had left his laptop here so i decided to go online to find out what the deal is...so i go to the bbc website....  ...now, i suppose you could say i was pro war, but i'd rather just sit on the fence about it...it's easier than listening to all the lies that both the media and the polititions tell us...but what i got from the whole 'iraq' situation, was that 'the coilition forces' were doing this to irradicate the potential threat of mass destruction and for the freedom of the iraqi people...and if good old tony blair is reading my blog, i'm sure he'd agree...now on the bbc website there are 2 things the desturb me....  1) i'm sure most of you have seen the pictures of saddam after being caught with his long beard...understandable as the guys been in hiding for ages...now on the bbc website there are 2 pictures, 1 with his beard, and another after they shaved him to make him look like he does in all the photos of him when he was in power...just to prove to the fickle public that it is him!  2) one heading reads... 'Wonderful Christmas present' ...now who the fuck is this a 'wonderful christmas present' for?! could it be for the good old british and american public who 'know everything' on the subject cause they watch the channel 5 news and read the news section in the 'sunday sport' (do they have a news section in the sunday sport?) and are all deeply involved with the subject cause they are all personally involved with what happens and it is their day to day living that is under threat by such an evil dictator?...i don't think so...i'm sure most of those people that were on the anti war demos have all recently been doing their christmas shopping without a care for whats going on...so it can't be a 'wonderful christmas present' for them cause that would be selfish and anti war demonstartors aren't selfish...it must be for all those people in iraq that are now liberated and don't have to live in fear that saddam may once again rise into power...oh, hold the fuck on...they don't celebrate christmas!!!!  serously people, what the fuck? if some one knows if the 'Wonderful Christmas present' statement came from somebody (sounds like it could be a 'bush'ism) or if it was just a last minute bbc blunder then can they let me know...thanks...  anyway, on a more, blog related story, i went to the opening day of the last ski hill in the area..not bad...icy runs though...and the last time i went to sunshine i went 'back country'...basically climbed a hill for an hour in waist deep snow and then made fresh tracks...it's deffinatly the bomb! recemend it.

      Right, todays blog will maybe be a rant and rave so those of you that get tired of my constant whinging, be prepared...this could get messy...  where to start?... how about, tays back...can't belive the fucker got home while i'm away...has the guy got not respect...tay, if you're reading this then ur a bitch and i hate you...  i still have no job...i'm really starting to worry that i might be on a flight home on the 15th Jan...which will suck cock more than kesh does...  Adverts...fucking TV adverts...was watching one program the other day and they showed exactly 2 minutes of the program i was watching and then 3 minutes of adverts...no word of a lie! such a load of shite  and then i watched 'thomas crown affair' on TV, which i guess u know is one of my fav films...now the film is about 2 hours 20 mins long, the gits on 'wgn superstation' cut it down so it fit in a 2 hour time slot with a 3 minute advert break every 10mins...they must of cut out about an hour of the film!!! and the bits they cut are bits that i would say are crutial to the story! fucking 'superstation' my ass!  as i've mentioned i live with a load of girls so as u can imagine there is the fair share of 'reality tv' on...and monday nights had turned into 'average joe' night...the concept is easy...find a really really really foxy chick...get her to admit that it's what's on the inside that counts when looking for a guy...then put her in a house for 2 weeks with 15 'average joes'....well, they say average, but most of these guys ming!...genius concept, could a gorgous girl fall for some 'wall street, computer geek, with glasses and a bear belly bigger than the taj mahal' because of what's on the inside...i have to admit, i was starting to get hooked...then...half way through the series when there were only 3 guys left, the threw in 3 models...to see if she would go for 'the average joe' or if she would pick her man on looks...as numbers dwindeled 2 guys were left...one average joe (who was called adam) and one pretty boy (who, by the way, on her first date with she asked him if he was gay!)...now adam was cool, big teeth, but cool...everyones friend, she had a wicked laugh with him, and he was rich...very very rich (but she only found that out at the end), and then there was pretty boy, she didn't really get on with him, he was 26  and still lived at home, but she was 'physically attracted' to him in a big way...to cut a long story not quite so short, who did she pick...u guessed it...pretty boy....just goes to prove that looks do count! and money, intellagence, ambition, sence of humor count for sweet fuck all!...wardy, we're screwed!  right, that's the last of my rants i feel but i have some other stuff that i thought worth mentioning...  guys, u remember 'get over it', the film that donna, jools and rhona used to make us watch at every given oppertunity, well i can't escape it...loads of the songs from it are used on tv adverts here...and as they put so many god damn advert breaks in shows i hear them all the time!  you know how i always wanted a skateboard, well i got one...well, it's actually a snowskate, a skateboard without wheels for using on the snow...keep trying to kill myself on it and i'm getting close...some friends of ours have a veranda at their house and have made a 5ft hight ramp coming off it!...fucking funny...have some amusing 'jackass' style clips that i'll try and get on the blog at some point. we also got some 'crazy carpets', which are basically plastic sheets with wholes in to hold them...also fucking scary...fell off one and bust my shoulder AGAIN..but hey...who needs that muscle anyway!  and finally i've been learing Dutch...one of the lads i live with is fluent in Dutch...it's such a good language...so far i have learnt...  'zone funun mooderless chiat'  ....son of a motherless goat!!  if anyone has any good phrases that they think will work well in dutch then let me know and i'll write them here!!  also, the dutch have some of the coolest customs...apparently santa has a friend called 'black pete' (i shit you not boys and girls) and black pete and santa fill your boots up with sweets on december the 5th! so Sam (the guy whos mum is dutch that i live with) got loads of sweets sent over from his nan...and it is custom that u get a giant chocolate letter...the first letter of ur name. so Sam got a giant chocolate S!! AND if you've you've been a bad person black pete 'caines your ass'!    urlLink here is a link to a photo of santa and black pete   anyway, think that's all i'm gonna write for today, you'll be glad to know...

      Now it would appear i'm getting better at boarding...well, one would hope so as it's the reason i'm out here...and during yesterdays session i started to get cocky...by cocky, i mean i was going faster than a fat bald jew strapped to a piece of would should be going, when the inevitable happened, i fell, on a patch of ice and the following injuries were sustained: 1) the usual weak shoulder injury! yep, i've done something to it again, don't think i re-fractured it though which is always good, think i just ripped a bit of muscle 2) the inevitable whiplash that comes with any high speed downhill backwards fall 3) you know if ur a really well toned guy and u have a six pack (5.5 pack in wards case) well the two muscles that are at the top, just under ur tits, well i've pulled them! i didn't even think i had them! 4) a random cut on my leg...really not sure where that came from, but possibly the tree i hit, who knows.  so anyway, was quite a worth while trip yesterday...was gonna go again today but thought i better rest my shoulder as i seem to have a history of going straight out and doing more damage to it...so i'll wait till tomorrow!

       It's been for ever!   it would seem that i've not written here for ages so i will try and break things into managable to read sections aka: can't really be bothered to read this as it's to dull but i am some how compelled to sections.   Work Hard, Play Hard   so i now have a job, which i've had for 2 months. It's in a shop called Monod Sports in the center of Banff. It is prodomanantly a ski, hiking and climbing shop (no boarding stuff...boo). I work on the shoe floor selling casual shoes and hiking boots...so i can now fit hiking boots really well! we also have goggles and helmets on our floor...so there aint much i dont know about goggles now! riviting conversation i can tell you!  Made loads of good mates there, most of them ozzys! it's not their fault! but 2 of the lads i got on really well with are on their way back home...which sucks as i live in a house with 7 girls and i get frowned at when i start watching porn!   Not a day over 23   So it was my 23rd birthday in Feb. Was good. spent all day riding and then had a few quite ones in the evening. Chris was here. which was cool...except the fool went and cracked a rib! but he only cracked it...he didn't fracture it! and he tore some ligaments in his foot! the fool! he really should learn to board!  my boarding is coming on fine...not pulling any crazy backside 50-50's or 360 corkscrews but i can get down runs without falling over (most of the time).  In typical 'dave' fashion, i went and bought a helmet that has built in headphones in it! so i now ride to Bob Marley most days...which slows me down....can u imagine me boarding at top speed with '...could this be love...and be loved...' jamming away in my ears...i don't think so!   Got to love guy B   After a long, drunk, conversation with one of the girls i work with, i was officially labeled as 'Guy B'. You know guy B, the nice guy, who's all the girls friend but never their fuck buddy. You know, the guy who always sits by, while 'guy A' (the loser, dumb as pig shit, twat) gets to date all the girls...untill the girl realises that shes dating guy A but really needs guy B cause guy A is a knob jocky! Which really sucks...  now, to be guy A is actually quite easy. all u need to do is the following: 1)   Be mysterious....not too difficult, just dont tell them your name, or where u live, or that you have crabs. 2)   Be funny....hello, have u guys not heard my jokes...i just steal from kesh and ward...and they are 2 funny guys 3)   Be a good dancer....my god, if i could sing aswell as i could dance i would have the voice of posh spice! 4)   Be good looking....fuck, here lies my problem  maybe i was never cut out to be guy A...maybe i should just live with the fact i'm guy B and just wait till all the girls are dumping guy A and are in search of guy B...but by the time that comes...i'm gonna be so bitter and twisted cause all the guys A have been getting laid, and i'm not, that i'm gonna turn into guy A when all the chicks really want is guy B...and that's the rub!   I'm sure there is a lot more that i should write about but i can't remember much so when it all comes back to me i'll write more! i'll try and update this at least once a week from now on!  laters

       760-SNOW   I now have an addiction...every morning i have to phone 760-SNOW for the daily snow report...It's free, which is good, although i think that i may have to block all calls to it from my cell phone when i get home cause i might start trying to find the latest snow dump report!  I'm writing this blog on my split shift break after having had a few drinks with Suze and Jen. We were sat outside wild bills on their patio and now my hands are frozen! At least the drinks will help work go faster!  Just so everyone knows, i'm moving out my house at the end of this month so for all those people that call me (of whom there are none) i will no longer be contactable come the 30th.  Was gonna write something here using really long words to make me sound intellectual but i wrote it, read it, and then realised i can't spell for shit...bugger...just have to limit myslef to words i can just about spell!  I'll write more when i've managed to aquire a chair for the dummy downhill and we have actually started to build something!

       Bikes, on snow...don't be silly!   I had one of the best days on hill yesterday...me and Matt went up spent the morning boarding (well i was boarding and he was skiing) then we had lunch...did some more riding in awesome snow with bright blue sky and then when we were knackered we went up on the snow bikes!!! The bikes are just like normal bikes although instead of having wheels the have skis!! Matt teaches people how to use them so he was quite good...i got the hang of it eventually and it was the most amusing thing i've done in a while! We were goging on tree runs that were just wide enough for the handel bars to fit through...it really was some funny shit! if anyone gets an oppertunity to do it i recomend it!

       SNOW!   We've had 20cm in the last 4 days...RESULT! Went up on hill yesterday for Sebs last day riding...it wasn't too bad although the light was shit! Seb left at 7.30am today and instead of getting up and going for first lift i stayed in bed and went up at 10!! man i'm lazy! good day riding though...wheather wasn't too bad and there were loads of freshies to be had...so i can't complain.  No real amusing stories to tell today. I am gonna be homeless soon as i still haven't find anywhere to kip for the month of May...oh well! Still  not booked my trip back home. i'll do it before too long and you'll probably all be graced with my presence around mid june!  Keep it real.

       Royal Race.   OK people, I have a serious announcement to make...Matt and myself have entered the 'dummy downhill' race at Sunshine. This is basically where you make something on skis and push it off a hill and who evers gets to the bottom first, wins....it's a simple premiss.  Now whilst we were trying to come up with a theme for our dummy, the only great idea we hit was the following.  Our dummy is gonna be the queen on her throne! and the throne will be on skis!!! it's gonna be some funny shit...we've managed to source some skis and we're waiting to get a chair...the queen will be played by an inflatable granny that one of our mates got as a birthday pres!  if anybody has some suggestions to improve our little project then let us know...oh and she will be dragging a little corgi behind her!  i will keep u all posted on the build as it takes place...the race is on Sunday 2nd May.

       Mellen, as in  the fruit.   So, there i was, working hard trying to sell googles, and in walked this rather attractive young lady. After a fairly long conversation about different lens colours for different light conditions (the details of which are enthralling!) i started to chat to her a bout random things and it turned out that she worked at Sunshine Village, a place i now frequent 3 times a week, as a snowboard instructor, which was great as i was looking into having a lesson, so i was asking what sort of lesson she thought i should do. After a continued chat another customer came that wanted something so off she went. As she left she introduced herself:  "hi, i'm mellen, as in the fruit"  to which i replied, "and i'm dave, as in, dave"  oh Mr. Smooth strikes again!!!!! anyhoo she suggested that if i do go up for a lesson i should request her.  So, to cut a long story short, i had a lesson with her yesterday...and oh my god....i'm now boarding like some crazed mad monster!!!!  My carving is better, i'm going faster than i should be...and most importantly, i've started to land stuff in the park!!!! it is actually possible to get my fat ass of the ground!! I'm soooo fucking stoked!!  gonna work on trying a grab next week....fucking bring it!  Mellen, i salute you!

       My Feet are Super   So i had to wake up early this morning so i could be in work for 8 when on a thursday i'm not supposed to be in till 12! The reason for this is cause we had a product knowledge talk on Superfeet...specially made footbeds for your shoes...my god...what the fuck am i talking about...must still be asleep! i was about to tell you about the footbeds...thank god i stopped myself!   I will just leave you with an exert from an e-mail that chris sent me regarding broadband...   "...it doesn't lead to social rejection, its what the socially rejected turn to when society, as in my case, has forgotten they exist, and or also in my case have nothing better to do at work..."   well i thought it was quite amusing...but then again i was just gonna tell you about footbeds!

       Broadband leads to social rejection.   Oh My God...lets get some things straight...I never said Sponge Monkeys were original, infact i could have mentioned that they were invented by a british guy for channel 4, and that Quiznos approached him to make the ad...i knew all that....but i didn't think it was worth mentioning cause the point of the blog was that 'any coupon works' and it's funny....i wouldn't have bothered if i knew that i was gonna get countless e-mails 'informing' me about sponge monkeys...not mentioning any names (ward and chris (and probably kesh had he had time to check the blog)) but guys...seriously...i thought i needed to get laid!  Next time i mention something remotely interesting or amusing i will make sure i mention every little detail involved with the offending item so as not to offend the broadband happy punks amoung you! DO SOME WORK!!!

       Love is not dead, it's just hiding from me in a grave yard.   I haven't really spoke much about my job have i? well it's a typical job in a busy tourist town shop. Most of the people i work with are cool, and i get on with most of them. There are a couple of things that piss me off about work:  the first is.......the un-natural way everything has to be 'just right', and by 'just right' i actually mean '100% anal'. i work on the shoe floor and the shoes have to be facing the right direction and in price order....and there are about a trillion bazillion other things that have to be done...although it's not all bad cause it keeps me busy.  the second thing.........well i've previously mentioned how nice everyone is in canada. well, it's actually in my contract that i have to great every customer that comes into the shop, bit of a pain in the ass when u have a stinkin hangover and when you greet brits...cause, sorry guys, i can happily say, brits are the most unfriendly lot of twats! ESPECIALLY SOUTHERNERS!!!! but on the whole i think being friendly suits me..which leads me on to the main point of this long winded blog....when i start talking to customers, most of them talk back...i once had a 45 minute conversation with a lovley couple who were just browsing...but i digress....the other day i was talking to this old lady who was trying some shoes on, not a supprise cause i work on the shoe floor...well after the usual "are u from Australia?" question i get (which is occasionally replaced with "where in new zealand are you from?") i was chatting about what she was doing in Banff...she was there with some of her pensienor walking group from somewhere in the states, anyway, not sure how we got onto it, but she started telling me that her late husband past away in 2000 of cancer, a sad story of how they loved each other dearly, and how she missed him, but then in 2002 she went to her high school 50th reunion...and she met some guy she used to go to school with...and they are now dating!!!! she says he's exactly the same as he was in school, only more cool stories about what he'd done since last time he saw her, in 1952! I just thought it was quite a sweet story and it just goes to show, you go through your life looking for the right someone, and it turns out you miss them first time round, just prey to god that there's a second time...or just don't screw up your first!  (this blog almost had a point!!!)

       Goggle tans are too cool for school!   In the summer time when the weather is fine...girls and boys it's getting hot....none of this 30 below malarky...it was 20 the other day...i'm working on the goggle tan, or burn in my case as most of you know, so panda eyes here i come!  i can only prey that my goggle tan will be as good as many of my hardcore boarding  buddies by the end of the season.  Although these high temps are keeping the fresh snow at bay there is something to be said for cruising the slopes in just a longsleaved top! With any luck jungle fever may be upon us soon and those lovely ladies will be out in force!  Can't belive the season is coming to a close...not long now before i'm back in blighty...but before that happens i have the joys of being kicked out of my house a month early to look forward to. Which is only made better by the fact that we're entering into the dummy skier race...more details to follow...  catch u on the flipside.

       Any coupon works...   I've ranted about the crazy TV that they have over here before...but a new advert has entered my life...and no, it's not the victoria secret ad and it is funnier than the genital herpes ad, or the vagasil ad...it is...the quiznos ad....  for those of you that aren't Canadian or American and havent had the pleasure of eating at Quiznos or seeing the advert then allow me to continue...Quiznos is a place that do subs...like subway, only different...and they have the greatest ads in the world...their ads involve a thing called a 'sponge monkey'...the only way to describe a sponge monkey is to imagine that you had a rat, you stuck big carboard eyes on it, gave it a sombrero and a guitar and offered it cheese to sing adverts for you and that would be fairly spot on...but to see for yourself then go here:    urlLink http://64.78.149.221/event1V2.asp   and remember kids...any coupon works!  At this critical juncture i have to offer great thanks to Dave 'Senior' for pointing out that i failed to mention sponge monkeys on my blog...so Senior, this ones for you!

      Yesterday i went white water rafting on the kicking horse river, and although it's almost June, the water is about 2 degrees! It was cold!!  The 2 hour trip started with a nice easy paddle while we learnt our commands...an then we got to this little area where we stopped to look at the rappids we were just about to hit!  Fuck me! was the first thought through my head! we're going through that on an inflatable boat? have a word! but it was all good and we managed to nogatiate the Grade 3 rappids without losing a team member...not quite the same story for the other rafts we were with..this one girl fell out 3 times!!! eventually she was told to stop paddling and to just sit at the front and hold on!  The was a total of 50 people in our group and when we were waiting for the bus we wondered how we were all gonna get to the rafting place..then from out of nowhere appeard a school bus!! and yes folks, it was just like the ones in the movies! it was yellow and black and we had some crazed otto type driver it was awesome...and there was one point where there were a couple of us in the bus when it had stopped and the keys were left in and a plan was formulated to tour canada 'road trip' style with it...but we thought better of it. and can i just say...those busses have more leg room than some of the greyhound buses!! and they are dead comfy!! those kids have got it easy!

      As a sit here, there is a 14 stone woman singing 'i did it my way', so i guess that means it's officially over.  Today was May 24th 2004, the last riding day of the season. As i unclipped my bindings for the last time, i looked across the rocky mountains, and a great sadness came over me. I've had such a good time here and it's all coming to an end. i will no longer be able to hear the snow make that 'scrunch' noise that only snow makes under a speeding board, i will no longer be able to flick my back leg round spraying large amounts of fluffy white snow over people sat down, i will no longer be able to do a large deap toeside carve and get my hand down, i will no longer be able to pop over little jumps like there's no tomorrow and most importantly, my goggle tan is only gonna start disapearing from now.  Soon i will be back home, with nothing but a large debt and an itch that is just not possible to scratch, sure, i maybe able to get a light rub on the itch, that will be the ski village, but i'm just not gonna be able to get the full on, hot ladies, long red nails scraping down my bare flesh that is riding the fresh stuff.  Sunshine village; when i was bad, u punished me. but when i was good, u gave me everything i needed and a whole lot more...i'm gonna miss you!

      oh my god...i only have tomorrow left to ride this season.  Yes tomorrow is going to be about my 75th day riding this year, and also my last.  the only way i can describe what i'm feeling now is to imagine that you know you're going to prison the day after tomorrow (no relevance to this summers big film) and so u only have one day to spend doing what you love...well that's how i feel! knowing that i'm only going to get the odd day release and not likly to get any congical visits for at least a year!  On the plus side, at least i do still have tomorrow. hopefully the weather will be nice so i can give 'er.  and as long as i remember it's podium or fence, then tomorrow will be a good day.

So if you are reading this because you have nowt better to do with your time than not only reading wards blog but also clicking on his random links then let me assure you there is nothing of any interest here. Infact, thank you for taking the time to read this far...cause i'm sure you're the only person that has!

      Went to see 'Shrek 2' tonight.  Was good. Funny bits...really like the rip off other film bits that only someone who has had to put up with Kesh for 4 years will notice.  Like a guy who likes blow jobs, i'm giving it a 2 thumbs up. (Ward, i know you got that.)  If you can, go see it. If you cant, well then bad luck!

      OK, so i went on hill today and all was well for one of my last days. It started off fairly solid and then due to the heat (yes, i said heat, it got up to +11 today!) it started to get softer and softer untill it was so wet and soft that u just slowed down going downhill! the perfect time was about a 10 minute period that started at 10:50...and that was sweet riding.  I managed to actually land one of the jumps in the park on the bit where ur supposed to land, rather than the flat bit on he top cause i never hit it with enough speed!  My goggle tan is coming on nicely and i'll try and post some photos of it soon!

      Well, it's countdown time...i now have only 2 days of work left and only 6 riding days left this season!! which major league sucks!! And for all of you that miss me so, i'll be back in good old blighy on the 9th June...so not long now! by the time i get back i will have been away for 7 months...i someways it feels like more, in other ways it feels like so much less.  the only problem is, that this once in a life time trip has turned into a full blown obssesion, that may lead me to a new life of no money, no life time prospects, seasonal friends, and no pension!!! A ski bum doesn't have a good quality of life, but a big fucking grin on his face!

      and NO kesh, much to your dissapointment, i'm still not gay, although i know you'd like me to be...this blog is about the only face shot i'm ever gonna take, and that was a powder face shot.  for those un-educated fools, this is where you snowboard through deap, steep powder, and then do a nice quick carve and end up spraying up snow in your own face...this was something i experienced yesterday...and i have to say, it's awesome! we had a nice dump of 12cm and cause the hill is so empty there was loads of untouched stuff!! It was also the first time i had ever carved in powder and got a hand down...such a fucking buzz!  but, on the downside, it dumped another 10cm last night and i'm back at work today...so the best powder we've had in ages, and i miss it cause i'm working!!! i'm so pissed!!!! and i doubt it'll hang around till next week, but we'll just have to wait and see if the snow gods are smiling down on me!  but on another plus side...my goggle tan is coming on nicely!!!

      I've just finished watching Calgary in the stanley cup play-offs in which they have just done fairly well winning in extra time. and it came to my attention just how violent a sport it is...it rocks...but on asking around it would appear that no matter how much the players beat the shit out of each other, the is no after match violence between fans!! just goes to show how nice canadians really are....but then i thought about it...lets list some fairly violent sports, Rugby....deffinatly violent...big fucking beer drinking men pounding each other to the ground...any after match violence? not as far as i'm aware! America...undoubtably the worlds most violent country...people shoot each other in the street just cause they feel like it...but i haven't heard of an upset dallas cowboys fan shooting a 69er fan after a game of american football!...no after boxing pub brawls...so this leads me to the pointless conclusion of this blog.....why do football fans feel it esential to beat each other in the streets after a game when football is played by a bunch of guys who cry when the get kicked in the shin?? SO, ergo, to stop after football match violence...there should be more in the game itself!!! it makes perfect sence!  I'm now likely to have the shit beaten out of me by some big football fan...but, although i'd be in large amounts of pain, it would only strengthen my argument!

      Today i did something that i vowed never to do...i changed my mini disc from the one labeled 'Bob Marley' to the one that said 'heavy rock!!' and listened to it while i was boarding! the reason i said i'd never do that is cause rock music makes you think you're invincible...and i'm not....proven by the fact that in the past i've broken (sorry chris, 'fractured') my collar bone and that today whilst listening to 'heavy rock' i had 2 collisions with another boarder!!!! THE SAME BOARDER I might add...on the same fucking run!!! So now i'm here with a really sore neck and and dirty great bruise on my arm...but it's all good fun!!

      Well, it's official. I am no longer a resident of 322 Lynx street, Banff. I, along with 8 others, have now joined the forever growing list of 20 somethings of 'no fixed permanent address' that spend time living off hardly any money, travelling to find 'ones self' (or snow in my case!) I would say i have deffinatly 'Found myself' and it would appear to be strapped to a plank of wood on a snow covered hill/mountain carving smoothly listening to Bob Marleys preechings! Man i love this shit!  But alas poor yorick, time is running out for the precious white stuff, and soon i will be back on home soil with no money and an acheing for a better life. and you sorry bastards are gonna have to put up with it!  I know some you you guys check out wardys blog occasionaly but who actually clicks on any of the 50000 links that he puts....well i just thought it important that this one should not be missed by anyone as it is truly a moment of french inspiration!   urlLink http://www.hugi.is/hahradi/bigboxes.php?box_id=51208&f_id=681   The dummy downhill is tomorrow and i have a feeling that i face stiff competition...so i will write more later in the week and may even have some photos of it for you!

      Right, i'm out of Banff! It's gone..it's nothing but a memory!  I'm now in a hostel in Toronto after a rather long flight ordeal! but as i'm paying loads for internet i cant write about it now...but i have a lot to complain about...  Memo to self: write about stupid idiots with cell phones, annoying woman with overhead compartment, rushing.  Tomorrow i'm getting a bus to somewhere. not sure where...it's called Sudbury, just got a text from a mate saying go there...so i am!  Speak to you later...maybe!
