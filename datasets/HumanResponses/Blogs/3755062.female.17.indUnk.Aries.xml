      So we planned on going to the beach today last week, and of course it was cloudy. AHHH....I hate the clouds. I tried to surf and I did okay at first, but then I got scared and remembered that I hate the ocean.Apparently fear of the ocean is called Thalassophobia (according to Robert...he's an expert). Katie, Katy, and I went to the work barbecue. We're such losers, we hang out with work people on our day off.

       urlLink    This is a picture of Salzburg, Austria (aka where S of M was filmed). I was reading this European travel book today and apparently there are Sound of Music tours and daily showings of the movie all around town. The gazebo where "I am 16 going on 17" was filmed had to be closed, unfortunately, because an 85 year old woman tried to reenact the scene and broke her leg as she was jumping from bench to bench. I found that rather entertaining.&nbsp; urlLink

      Hehe...today was "British accent" day in our stand and I got to say 'bloody hell,' 'crichey,' and 'cheerio' numerous times. I am so freaking bored and frusturated with stupid ringtones.com. They never sent me "Wave of Mutilation" even though I paid for it. Cello!!! I'm watching Wimbledon since I have no plans and it's making me kind of sad about giving up tennis. Sigh...Please could you stop the noise, I'm trying to get some rest From all the unborn chicken voices in my head What's that...?  (I may be paranoid, but not an android) What's that...?  (I may be paranoid, but not an android)...Radiohead in my head (that sounds weird).It's time for pralines n' cream......ummm...good.

      Ahhhhh!!!!! I really hate the Fair. Katy, Katie, and I are each doing a couple nights a week at the Calamari place in addition to our morning shifts at Cinnamon Rolls. Carnies are scary. I prefer to stick with the "fairies," but I agreed to this. Hehe...today was "pirate day" at our stand and instead of saying "coffee on the right" we said "coffee on the starboard side matey." When Nick knocked over the frosting I said "shiver me timbers...frosting overboard!!" I hate to admit this, but I actually kind of miss school. Not the homework or classes so much, but seeing all my friends everyday. I have nothing to do with myself; I knit and read my book after work and sometimes go see a movie. Boring x 100+6.I think I want to go watch the Sound of Music.....

       urlLink    So I'm back from EPGY and I miss everyone sooo much. I can't believe I ever thought I wouldn't make friends (because I'm normally so shy). I made a ton of friends and now I'm really sad that they all live around the country and not in San Diego. I had more good times than I can talk about, the hightlights being: the beach, the Terra Dance, the Carnival, body painting and then fountain hopping afterwards, watching Zoolander, winning the Pullitzer, playing Catchphrase and Scattergories, and talking on the table with Lyndsay, Sarah, Darcy, and Erin. I miss everyone and I really do hope we all stay in touch. It was honestly more fun than I ever could have imagined. Okay this is getting cheesy, so I'm going to stop writing.&nbsp; urlLink

      I'm not really by myself, but we sing this song constantly because it is  always  playing. Yesterday we learned to swing dance; I'm not really very good, but I picked it up much faster than some of the guys. Last night we went to Coldstone...yum...and I laughed because they were playing Hero outside while we were eating it. The last time I went to Coldstone with Robert, Tiffany, and Anaya we ate ice cream while listening to Hero, so it was pretty nostalgic. Katy called me from the Jet concert last night and I got a little homesick, I have to admit. Probably the only bad things about being here are the food, the lack of sleep, and not getting the chance to listen to good music. I AM STILL ANGRY because Libby killed me in Word Assassination. I thought I was going to go the distance seeing as I killed Darcy and Erin right away, and then got Lyndsay and Sarah out. My word was Catwoman, which was a little ironic considering that's one of my nicknames. Meow!!! We're leaving for the beach in an hour and I plan to sleep the whole time. Yay for sleep. We played Catchphrase at Coldstone last night and my team was "team win." Needless to say, we won every time (yay Vanessa, Sean, and Arthur).

      Oh yes. I love Scattergories, but not as much as Catchphrase. I think we're going to have another tournament on Friday like last Friday night. That was soooooooo much fun. I'm having such a good time, I really don't want to leave. I feel like I've known the people up here longer than I've known some of my friends at home. Today, Katy came up to say hi because she was staying with her sister in Santa Cruz and we were just going to walk to SuperCamp and back, but I got really lost and we ended up on the other side of campus. I have the world's worst sense of direction; I swear, I get lost in my own house. I'm hoping our house plays tag tonight because it is the best game EVER!!! We play a lot of tennis and frisbee too, but nothing compares to tag. I need some sleep tonight considering last night I stayed awake, scared that there was someone hiding in my closet. It was horrible. Anyways...the common room is "wicked" quiet, so I'm going to find out where all the action is.

      Oh my gosh, I know I've already posted about Carol King, but they played that song in the dining hall this morning and I freaked out. I started to sing rather loudly and then stopped when I realized I was getting nasty looks. I love that I'm being such a bad student here, considering I really don't procrastinate at home. We turned in our first drafts today of our papers and mine is sooooooooooo bad. I actually love to write and I'm pretty good at it, but my paper was one of the worst things I've done since 10th grade. I'm not going out tonight though so I can do some research. Groan. I'm such a dork that I like blogging so much, but I am at nerd camp so something like this would be appealing to me. Katie came and visited me two nights ago and we went out to coffee with Darcy and Sarah. I guided her on a map...I'VE NEVER DONE SOMETHING LIKE THAT BEFORE!!!! I'm horrible with directions so it was a milestone for me. She also told me that Saltzburg was going to be on the cover of the travel section, and that made me really happy. I love the Sound of Music; people here don't understand my fanaticism. It's like a new identity for me. Anyways, I am having a really good time and I'm stoked for the weekend because we're going to Santa Cruz on Saturday and into the city on Sunday. I think I'm going to change my screen name as soon as possible because people keep asking questions and the explanation is getting rather droaning. Oh yeah, and I watched Venus Williams and was like inches away from Lindsey Davenport at this exclusive dinner thing. It was great.

      Zap is my dorm's name; I promise I'm not just a crazy freak. Well...hehe. Today was my first actual day here and it's turning out to be pretty fun. I got lucky because my roommate is really cool and we're turning into good friends. I've already played Catchphrase with people and I got them addicted. Our class is split into four magazine groups; my group is really fun and we have a bunch of good ideas. I totally thought I wouldn't make any friends here because I'm pretty shy, but actually I've made a bunch of friends and I actually raised my hand today for the group discussion. I am still amazed I did that, but it was about James Baldwin and I had a lot to say about the quest for self-definition blah blah blah. Leal's class actually came in handy. OH yeah....the day brought more good news. I passed all my APs!!! I got a 5 in history and 4s in chem, spanish, and english. I was a little bummed about the English, but I knew I didn't do that great and I didn't study at all, so whatever. Sarah (my roommate) got a 5 in chem. She's very smart; there are some girls here who are either not focused on school or they are so focused that they lack social skills. Luckily, she is neither of those and there are other cool people too. No hot guys...damn, but a lot of really nice ones. I'm supposed to be here for academics, so I guess I shouldn't be concerned with guys. Tonight is Scattergories night, I'm going to go win. Yay!!! I love boardgames.

      I hate packing. I've been avoiding it all day, and now I'm getting really anxious because I know I should be doing it and I'm online instead. I woke up at 10:30 today (this is like a record for me) after a late night. Boardgame night...yeah, we actually didn't play that many boardgames, just a lot of Catchphrase. I was rather competitive, but I definitely could have been worst. I felt like such an idiot after my car battery died because I left the stupid lights on. Tiffany's dad probably thinks I'm crazy or something. Today we went to Lindsey's Dad's house to use the power hose and then we had a picnic. Her little chiuaua puppies looked like rats and I was scared. On the way home the Maroon 5 song, She Will be Loved (or whatever it's called) came on and Katy and Lindsey sang it. I was like, "i guess it would be kind of nice if someone sang this to you" (except for I was joking) and they proceeded to sing it to me the rest of the time. Groan and eyeroll. Then we saw Mr. Wilson (aka the hottest Dad alive) and Katy and I almost melted. He hugged us on New Year's and it was magical. Sigh....well I better pack even though I really don't want to.

      Hmmm...I feel like i should post because I don't know if I'll be able to for the next few weeks. I woke up and barfed a LOT today. It was weird because I haven't thrown up for a few years and I threw up for like 5 minutes straight.Yuck, but then I went to the mall and somehow my stomach felt better. I hate that I always plan to do indoor activities on days where it's so pretty outside, when I really should be at the beach. The sun hates me, it plans its schedule like it's my antithesis or something. Tonight is gamenight!!! I love board games, but I'm a little on the competitive side so I'm going to have to get a grip before I go because I don't want to scare anyone. I'm smiling because I'm soooo excited for Catchphrase...boardgames are super!!!

      I don't know why that's my title, but I had that song stuck in my head all day today, along with Carol King (you're so far away...doesn't anybody stay in one place anymore). I have to say it was very nostalgic to hear that song, it's like my freaking childhood. I know every word to every song on the Tapestry cassette. Anyways, Katy, Katie and I went down and rode bikes at Mission Bay, except for we only had two bikes so Katy rode the scooter. It was really fun, but the water park would have been better. We're watching one of my all time favorite movies tonight...Now and Then!!! Yay yay I love that movie. Back in the day Rachael Roubitchek and I would watch it together and talk about how that was going to be us in 20 years. Too bad I don't talk to her anymore. Oh well...

         Stupid clouds. My goal was to get tan by the end of the week, but it looks like that's not going to happen. I've spent the last hour in my room listening to Smashing Pumpkins and knitting my bag-thing. Tiffany and I successfully completed Operation Buy Cathchphrase. I think some people are going to come over and try it out tonight. Yay yay yay. I love Catchphrase. I'm reading People of the Lie right now and I realized I want to be M. Scott Peck. Ambition makes me look pretty ugly...After running errands with my mom today, I realized I'm a little frightened of leaving for three weeks by myself. To say I'm on the shy side would be a huge understatement. I'm going to have to get over that because I'm not going to know anyone there. yikes...three more days of fun before Sunday.

      i seem to recognize your face haunting, familiar, yet i can't seem to place it cannot find the candle of thought to light your name lifetimes are catching up with me all these changes taking place, i wish i'd seen the place but no one's ever taken me hearts and thoughts they fade, fade away...        I don't know why, but this song always makes me kind of sad. I hope I don't turn into an old senile woman who can't recognize her past. On a less contemplative note, I went surfing after the Rotary meeting today and I actually did well for my second time. I'm still afraid of the water and sometimes i yell when a big wave comes over my head, but that's nothing new. I feel like I should be super busy right now since I'm leaving pretty soon, but I LOVE doing nothing.Tonight we're going to see the Terminal since it's four dollar Tuesday. I love four dollar Tuesday. It makes me feel like I'm saving money, which is the best feeling ever. Lullaby...I'm listening to Starsailor now and liking it. La di da...

      Today was my second to last day of work (HALLELUJAH!!!!)and I am thrilled for tommorow. I will definitely miss Dawn and Nick even if I did see them having sex. Katie and I might go up and hike with them in Yosemite some time, which would be completely awesome. My family is so freakin' lame; we did absolutely nothing for the fourth of July. I think subconsciously my negative feelings towards my Dad are because he never wants to spend time with us. He went to his tennis class tonight and didn't want to eat a big dinner so that he could play his best. What an asshole. He's so selfish it makes me want to scream. The worst part's that he creates this facade half the time that he's some nice loving Dad and he tries to buy me gifts to appease my resentment, but it never works. I see right through him. I have absolutely zero respect for him and never will I be able to share with him who I really am. I decided to go celebrate with the Fawells at the beach; there family's not half as dysfunctional as ours even considering what they're going through. I felt midly bad for abandoning my brother, but I had a really good time with Katie and Emily down at Stonesteps. Yawn...this has been a pretty serious entry, so I'll end it with a joke Nick told me today. Why do Mexicans cross the border in pairs? Because there's no TRESpassing. Hehe...I laughed despite it's lameness. Happy 4th of July.

      Yeah so what I posted yesterday was actually my post from the day before that for some reason didn't work. Yesterdy was "gangsta" day;we turned our visors around and my name became A-Dog. When people asked if they could have a roll we said, "for-schizzel," and when Nick was rolling out the dough we sand "Roll out...." It was fun. Today was musical day (an excuse for me to sing the Sound of Music without too much complaint). I also sang songs from Annie (sorry, I have no idea how to underline) and made up a special rendition of "Hard Knock Life." It went like this....Scrapin' pans, we get bored...washin' dishes,what a chore...it's a hardknock life. There was more, but that was the highlight. Then this bitch spilled hot tea on herself even though I pointed to the sign that says "hot foods are served hot." She works at the psychic place, so shouldn't she have known that that was going to happen? Cello!!! We went to the beach afterwards and we frolicked in the water. I wasn't scared, it was fun.

      I'm in the worst freaking mood ever. Today was my day to work Calamari so I had to wait around the Fair from 2-4 until my shift started. It was excrutiatingly boring and I was jealous that Katie and Katy got to go to the beach while I worked. Fifteen minutes after I got to work, the stupid, bitchy Carnie lady told me to take a half hour break even though I said I had nothing to do. I took a nap in the paddock and afterwards I unknowingly had grass all over me. After an hour of work the bitch freaked out and said she didn't need any help and she didn't know why the manager had hired us. I had to call my mom to pick me up(my brother and I share the car) because she wasn't going to come until 8 and then after I talked to her I realized I was supposed to pick up the American Pie DVD from Dawn and Nick after 7:00(when they get back from break). I decided I'd just walk the mile out to the motor homes and get it from them then. When I got there I walked to the door, which was like a screen thing, and I looked in to see them doing it on the couch. I was very traumatized, but luckily, they didn't see me. I walked another mile to the car where my mom was mad that she had to wait so long and I never even got the movie. All we want to do is have our freaking pie party, but now I'm in too terrible a mood to even hang out with anyone. I think there's steam coming out of my ears. I really hate the fair.

      Another cloudy day....groan....we were supposed to go to the beach because I probably won't be able to go again until I leave for camp. Ugh, camp is coming very fast--I leave on Sunday and I am not excited one bit. I don't know why exactly, I always have fun at Hume with the exception of last year (mostly just the beginning of the week), but I am really dreading it. I've been contemplating this dread and here's what I came up with: 1.) I have had hardly anytime to relax this summer and i'd rather just stay home and sit around. 2.) I haven't been to church in so so long and people are going to be asking me why. 3.) I have been determined to be "shy" at church, so I'm going to have to work extra hard to transcend that so people will actually talk to me. 4.) My relationship with God over the past few months and year has not been excellent. I still believe what I used to, I'm just so freaking lazy and now I feel guilty, which pushes me away from Him even more. So yeah, I'm going to try my hardest to have a good time since this is my last year going, but it's going to be a struggle to not have a computer for a whole week. I will miss talking to all my EPGY friends and...sigh...updating my blog for a week. : ) Oh, by the way, if anyone ever feels the need to rent  The Prince and Me  DON'T. It was honestly one of the worst movies I've seen; Katy, Jade, and Ali Littman watched it with me and we were like, "Are you serious? That was sooooo LAME." Oh yeah, I am SO SO SO excited to see Pete Yorn on Friday. We have been waiting to see him for so long because he always plays at clubs that I can't go into and now he is coming to the racetracks!!! Whoa...I just had a brilliant moment...I will bring CATCHPHRASE to camp with me!!!!!! Nothing can go wrong when Catchphrase is there. Yes, the dread is slowly lessening. Okay, I'm off to the gym....

      After the waterpark on Monday I drove up to spend the night at Lyndsay's house. Right after EPGY I probably would have said that Sarah was my closest friend there, but now I feel like I'm getting to know Lyndsay really well. It was soooo weird talking to EPGY people online together...we were fighting over the keyboard (not really : ) ). Since my computer is retarded at home, I actually got to see what a webcam was like and I got to see Arthur online and hear him. Hehe..that was fun; technology is good. Later that night, after recounting several stories and laughing all the time, Lyndsay and I decided to try to go to bed around 12: 30 so we'd be able to "chillax" all day Tuesday, but then we ended up talking until early in the morning. Guys and religion...two interesting topics, I must say. Today was an intersting day. Kasra (pronounced like Casbah as I soon learned) came over to Lyndsay's and we all went out to breakfast. I am sorry to say I did not show off my breakfast eating skills, but I didn't want to look like a pig (with fear that Lyndsay would call me "Piggsy Riggsy") so I only ate about half what I normally do. We went back and watched the EPGY video (eyerolling about Babs, laughing at Jake, getting happy when they showed slappy game, laughing at Sarah "the freak," and generally missing everyone soooo much), Rat Race (YOU SHOULD HAVE BOUGHT A SQUIRREL!!!!)  and Benny and Joon (Lyndsay loves Jonny Depp a little too much). I just realized I have parenthesis quite often in this, so I'll try to use them less frequently (this is probably a lie ;)). After "picking out of a hat," a.k.a. my favorite pasttime, we went to the park and played Frizbee Mania where I was definitely NOT the worst Frizbeeer(yes, I am aware that this is not a word)...haha, Kasra's throws were always like 100 feet off. We ate pizza and chillaxed some more before I went home. I only got lost coming home because I followed Kasra, other than that, I found my way. I think I am definitely making progress in this whole "I really need a sense of direction" Odyssey. So yeah, that was pretty much my day....filled with a lot of EPGY recaps and many laughs. Yawn...I am a tired girl now.

      I finally did something fun with my life, "woot woot." Water park Day was entirely worth the wait....Katie, Kim, Marleigh, Katy, and I all went up to Irvine to spend the day at Wild Rivers. Driving up there was equally thrilling considering I was going like 90 mph and this stupid white suv thing kept following me and getting on my tail...I would change lanes and speed up to get away from it and it would FOLLOW ME. So yeah, when I got to the Best Buy parking lot I realized it was Marleigh's mom's car that she had borrowed for the day and she says, "driving a little fast there Annie." : ) At the waterpark, hmm....everything was fun and not particularly painful with the exception of the evil ( and I do mean evil) Bowl from Hell ride where I almost DIED. These things are supposed to be fun, not inducing pain. I got out of that thing after it spit me out and I was like, "awww...hey guys...I can't feel anything on my left side." The Devil's Waterslide..tsk tsk. Then there was the excitement of the Patriot (second time was better) when I kept screaming "LEAN FORWARD" and Katy yells "shut the hell up"....what can I say? I wanted to go fast. Oh yeah, I thought I swiped this from my memory, but no: these extremely immature boys were behind Katy, katie, and I in the Cobra line and one kid pulled his pants down so his fugly white naked butt was showing and they kept poking us so that we would turn around and his ass would be in our faces. Eww, that was not worth recounting, I was fully disgusted. Minus the nasty sunburn I got on my back with the big white square where my bandage thing was, I had a splendorifous (aww...Fair vocabulary) day.

I started singing along.....cease to exist, given my goodbye/drive my car into the ocean/you think I'm dead, but I've sailed away...ON a WaVe of MuTiLaTiOn, wave of mutilation, wave of mutilation, waaaaaaaaave....( I swear I'm not crazy and this is not a cry for help, it really is a great song).

      No, I did not mean to write Flaming Lips although they are a great band. I am STUPID. I forget that I'm pale, and so yesterday I was out in the sun for awhile and I didn't put sunscreen on my legs (HUGE MISTAKE) and now I feel like there's a flame running up and down them. OUCH. Allie and I went to the intermediate pilates class this morning, even though I've never been and I wasn't sure if I could handle intermediate. I was right, people who don't know how to do pilates should NOT be in the intermediate class (thank you, Allie). The entire time I was shaking....I swear, it was like Earthquake Annie had hit the room. When I got home I did a bunch of errands around town. I got a new GREEN backpack (yes, I know, I am very predictable). Then I had to go get my "sexy" pants (my mom told me they were sexy :) ) hemmed even though I got the petite size (being short = no fun!!). Oh yeah, I forgot to blog about my new tennis racket!!! It was so exciting, at the Acura Classic (this is a big tennis tournament in San Diego) they had a raffle and the last prize was a new, really nice Yonex tennis racket with a cover signed by a bunch of people on the WTA tour, and my Nana won!!!! They were like, "what are you going to do with it?" and she says, "give it to my granddaughter." And yes, that granddaughter was me, NOT one of my evil cousins (Holly, if you read this, I don't think  you're  evil). Anyways, I had to get strings on the racket. Now I'm sitting here listening to my new Franz Ferdinand c.d. that I just bought along with Modest Mouse. My parents are going out for the night, so a bunch of the girls are coming over to my house and we're having a Catchphrase/ wathching  Almost Famous  party!!! I am excited for Catchphrase, surprise surprise. I wish Vanessa, Arthur, and Sean were here so that we could kill my other friends, but they live far away : (. Thanks to Kasra, I'm getting good at using smileys...yay me, I'm a fast learner .' )

      Yeah so I'm a little bored. Actually, I AM A LOT BORED!!! I can't go surfing because of these stupid stiches on my back that look like a bug. When my mom took the bandage off, it really looked like a centipede was crawling over my shoulder. Scary, very scary. I still miss everyone from EPGY, although I don't think that will subside for a little while. Hehehe....last night Andrew tried to explain to me that Sharon's nickname was "BM." That made me so mad!!! I MADE THAT UP!! I came online to write Becky an e-mail and then it got lost and I'm too freakin' lazy to write another one. I'm supposed to go hang out at these people's house that Katy's housesitting, although I have no energy to. Yep, so my life is boring right now...I tried to get some of my AP Physics hw done and I ended up falling asleep three times. Does anyone really care about the zeroth law of thermodynamics?!?! I think not. I need to go be exciting so I have something to write about; that was supposed to be Jon and my's goal for today, but it looks like I'm failing. Oh well, yawn.....time to eat (FOOD IS GOOD)

       urlLink       Monday was a rather eventful day. After getting my freaking back sliced open by my hot Dr. I drove up to Claremont to see a couple  schools plus meet up with EPGY friends. Sean and I were seriously the only people walking around; it was a little eerie (not to mention the fact that there were a LOT of squirrels and I have a phobia). Then I drove to Pasadena to pick up Ryan and Norm and got so lost. I was embarrassed because I called Norm  5 times on the  phone and was like..."um, Norm, I'm still lost." When I finally made it to his house we headed off to Santa Monica and got very lost on our way there too. Damn Mapquest gave us crappy directions and we ended up in Chinatown. About an hour later we got to Santa Monica (even though Sean was the world's worst directions-giver). Lyndsay, Andrew, Sean, Ryan, Norm, and I walked around and ate dinner, watched this creepy street performer, ate gelato, and laughed a lot. Those kids are fun. I got lost on the way home too and had to stop in a ghetto neighborhood so that my friend could do mapquest and help me get home. Needless to say, i get lost a lot.This is probably the reason why my mom wigs out whenever I go places. Oh yeah, I took a nap on a bench while I was waiting for Sean at Pomona and I got the knarliest splinter. It's starting to "fester" (I threw that in for anyone on Chronotope who I told that story too). Mmmmkay, sorry this isn't the most exciting (I shouldn't be saying this, Arthur is helping me work on my confidence issues; what I meant to say is: THIS IS SO EXCITING I'M SORRY IT HAS TO COME TO AN END).&nbsp; urlLink
