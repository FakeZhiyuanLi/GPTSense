      i'm not too sure what to use this 'blog' for. i have an 'ilog' on chowk.com, where i write a few lines or thoughts as and when they come to me. so like, is this the same? i'm not sure. but random thoughts eh. lets see. things come and go basically. everyday small things happen which could fill this or chowk's space, but it doesn't stick around in my mind long enough. it all gets stored somewhere in my brain, only to resurface at will, minutes, days, months or years later. i think that's human nature. i thought i had most of it all worked out, but in all honesty, i haven't. i'm only starting to fit some parts of the puzzle of life...i'm looking for questions for which i have answers, and answers for questions i have. maybe this is a diary of sorts. where i come and go through the whole day. we can work along those lines maybe, and see where this goes. i think its better to go to saturday night and work from there. got off from work around 5:30pm, which is early by office standards. i really wasn't in a good state, desperately wanted to leave and get that overbearing feeling off my chest. so yeah, i got off work, drove into the next lane, rolled a j, turned on the music and went for a little spin. the cds i had burnt the same day, electronica all the way, progressive house to be more precise. anyway, the j brought everything back into perspective. called a couple of boys, asked what the scene was, turns out everyone was gonna get together later on in the night, so i had time to kill. so went to iblees's place. somewhere in the back of my mind, i had a craving for chems. which possibly sent me to this place, but nothing doing. everyone was watching the match, so i joined in. smoked another 3 j's, and decided to go home and rest before attacking the weekend again. so home, shower change. played a little gta 3 inbetween. moba jinn called, as she always does, was her birthday the next day, which i didn't forget by the bye. anyway, so left for bj's. the usual company was there: billu, prahbz, munkey, deenga taali,bj and myself. a bottle of j and b. the festivities had begun. i was itching to put to good use, that one last tab of acid hidden in my wallet, but restraint is a virtue worth having these days. dope plays a major part in post work life. that means, j after j after j. so that was happening. mixed with the alcohol things were starting to get better. then someone mentioned coke. no, we aint talkin cola here. nose candy is more apt.  now, coke and me, we go back a long time, to the days of old in toronto. a slight smile crept onto my face. now the weekend's picking up. but sadly, the state of affairs in this part of the world are that either you earn a lot to afford such a drug, or you become a seller, and snorrt your cut. i don't fall into either these days. so it wasn't like back in the day, where 3 grams went 3 ways in 2 hours, only to be calling the dealer again.  we got a civilised amount and it went 5 ways. the stuff was, well, better than the last batch, but again i cant be comparing it to rishi's stuff in richmond hill, or kojo's at finch and sentinel.  anyway, back to the story at hand, so the chicane finished, and before the downer could set in, the j's were lit. that's what i love about hashish, it overrides everything else. maybe that's because we all started with that shit, so it holds a psychological advantage over all other drugs. anyway, so smoked a little, made a j for the drive back home, and i was on my way. reached home, got some munchies on the way, and it was time to hit the computer. was already 4 am by this time. a weekend ritual: pop a sleeping pill. i gots the whole rainbow, a diff. one each weekend. this time lord valium in all its 10mg glory. so yeh, that and a j combined is wonderful. the room was all hazy n shit, my balance was slightly off, and i staggerred to the computer, drove around miami for a bit, and then decided to pull the plug. it was time to catch up on a week's lost sleep. someone knocked on my door. opened it, my doggie was sitting there, with that look on her face which said i wanna come inside and sleep too okay....so in she came, and went into her corner. i looked at the watch, it was around 1 pm...maybe i should sleep a little more. another knock. its dad this time. he was on his way out somewhere. i staggerred out of bed, and into the washroom, for another j, then the whole shower routine, and i was ready to go. about to leave. an old friend calls. stay home i'm coming. ok, so back inside. sitting around. asim comes, its been a while since we hung out, inseperable a few years ago, now meeting after months. but things don't change much between us. so we went out, as we always do, chit chatting, me smoking my j's, him his fags and his supari. around 8:30 we went to ashraf tikka and had our usual tak a tak and mutton boti. to top that off, a pan and a cigarette, and the circle was complete. made the usual night purchases, a box of pringles, a pack of smokes, rizlaz and a couple of blank cds. met some boys on the way, who were hunting for dope. gave them like a nice chunk; what goes around comes around basically. that ended my sunday basically. came home chilled on the comp. for a bit, read a little of that mind control book, which reminds me, work to do i have.  finally hit the sack around 1:45am, and reached the office just after nine, which means i beat the attendance sheet. if i had missed it today, would have set a bad precedent for the whole week...i don't need that shit. oh yeah, just remembered. when i was coming home sunday mornin 3:30am, the cops pulled me over. i was HIGH as a kite, had alcohol, dope and coke flowing in my bloodstream, but my eyes were start white, and there wasn't a noticable alcohol smell in my breath. so the guy pulls me over, and asks me the routine questions. i didn't have a license. the conversation was taking turn after turn, and i really couldn't keep pace, cause i was so high, but i recall him asking me if i had heard a certain punjabi song,i said no...so in the middle of the night, right in the middle of the road, surrounded by policemen with guns, this seargent went ahead and sang me a song, which i heard, but couldn't understand, cause my ears just werne't tuned in. he finished, gave me a hug, and sent me on my way. strange strange. thank God he didn't find that piece of dope which i had stuck onto the hand brake when i had been getting out of the car. don't need no trouble in the middle of the night. so that was my weekend. eventful or uneventful, depends on how one looks at it really. now its monday. got a whole week to contend with. a lot of things are going to change. the marakesh express should be coming to town by the 27th, after our bad experiences in the las two deliveries, i'm keeping my fingers crossed.

      my first blog entry. should i be excited? after all, my mad incoherent ramblings may have found an audience. but has that search for an audience brought me here? or is it something else? i dont know, maybe you can help me out. watch this space for more ramblings of a sketched out mind.

      the monsoons have finally come to town.  the mad heat has subsided, and dark clouds have engulfed the city.  rain has been pouring down off and on the whole week, but the last two days have been special.  a light drizzle, cloudy skies, and a cool wind make for a very enjoyable mid august. i feel like going for a long drive, and smoking loads of dope. but i can't. cause i'm stuck in this cubicle. in front of this computer screen. after hours. now that's another story.
