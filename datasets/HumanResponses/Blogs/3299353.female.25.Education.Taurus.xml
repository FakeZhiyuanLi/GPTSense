						   I'd like to thank all of you who wished me a happy birthday--it made me smile.  :)  I did havve a good birthday.  And I have recovered from my anger over the student.  I am looking forward to the end of the week--that is when I begin my 2.5 month break.  And so this post is aptly titled, "Almost Done..."  I am not in a very existential mood this evening.  I will go.  Skittles....

						   I'm at work right now.  There's a class in my classroom and I am not working with them.  Why?  Because they don't give a shit.  So if they don't I don't.  Some student interrupted my instructions for the day to tell me that another student (who was standing silently, by the way) had his feet turned and he found that to be a disturbance.  NO ONE TOLD HIM TO FUCKING LOOK AT THE OTHER KID!  What the fuck is the issue with these kids thinking that every little thing that even approaches their peripheral vision is a fucking disturbance?  They don't comprehend the difference between truly being disturbed and choosing to be disturbed!!!  I hate my job right now.  I'm sure I will be ok later but right now, on my birthday of all days, these kids suck and I don't give a fuck whether or not they graduate.  I'm in a terrible mood and I know my attitude probably sucks too but I had to blow off steam or I just might have walked out...Anyway...back to the job...

						   Ok.  Three times must definitely be the charm.  This is my third online journal.  Why?  I don't know.  We'll just leave it at that.  I like this one, though.  So what's been going down in my world, you ask.  Alot of the same.  Dumb students who refuse to take responsibility, cleaning my house, etc.  I did get offered (and subsequently accepted) the opportunity to teach my Sunday School class at church.  I am really excited b/c deep down, I've always wanted to teach Sunday School.  I am a bit nervous, though.  Our class will begin a study of Isaiah and Jeremiah on the first Sunday in June.  I hit up my pastor and youth minister today for several commentaries and helful books to get me on my way.  It should be exciting and as we enter the threshold of summer, I will have much more time to study and will probably post my findings and my thoughts concerning Isaiah and Jeremiah.  I have been very interested in Isaiah for some time now.  I must say that I find the Messianic prophecy TRULY extraordinary.  As the teacher, I will, however, make sure that the other prophecies of Isaiah get discussed as well.  We talked about reading these prophecies not just as a future look but from the perspective of, "How do these apply NOW?"  I look forward to this being a great experience.  I am also hoping to gain some positive habits in the way of daily quiet times, etc. Well, it seems that this post is going to be short.  I will write mas despues.  :)

						   So I went to the Home Depot today.  My mission there was to figure & compare prices of different types of flooring.  My current flooring is carpet--beige, cheap & easily-stainable carpet.  How do you check your carpet to see if it is cheap & easily-stainable?  Easy!  Spill some water on it--that's right, I said WATER--and then soak it up with a paper towel.  If, after 2-4 hours, the outline of the spill is still there and the spot is now a shade darker than the rest of the carpet, you are the proud owner of cheap & easily-stainable carpet.   So my goal was to find something at least partially affordable that we could eventually replace our current carpet with.  At the get-go, pergo floor was very appealing.  Somewhat easy installation with no glue and no fibers to catch pet dander, dust, etc.  But it looked pretty derned expensive so I thought I'd check out carpet (nice stuff).  WRONG--Unless you happen to have somewhere between 3 & 5000 dollars to spend on the stuff that will eventually house the allergens that make you feel like shit--But really, just don't go there.  So I looked at parque floors--the parque pieces came in 1ft. squares with ten to a box.  Not a bad price.  I did actually find some pergo that wasn't God-awful-expensive so that also remained an option.    Ultimately, though, we chose to rip the carpet out of the living room & pergo that floor.  Then, later, we will go back and pergo the rest of the house (excluding the kitchen which will remain linoleum-ed).  The expense shouldn't be too oustandingly terrible if we break up this project into chunks of different time.  Also, a funny thing about owning your first home--you don't know how to do things like, I don't know, pergo a floor.  So you have to do one of two things:  1--pay to have it installed which can be rather pricey or 2--go ahead on your own and take the risk of fucking up something you may ultimately have to pay to have fixed.  We decided to just budget in having it installed in the living room first--since that will be the first floor to be "pergoed".  Then, after careful scrutiny of this process, we will attempt to pergo the bedrooms ourselves.  Hmmmm.  It's supposed to be really easy.  We'll see.    This post is very Sally-Homemaker.  That's ok.  During the summers I do plan to be a "Home-Maker".  I will make my home into something nice.  I will paint to my heart's content & sew curtains if it suits me.  I will replace mini blinds if I feel the whim or frame pictures & mirrors if I want.  So there.  Call me a home-maker.  Go ahead.  Now if I could have some babies to go with the home-making, that would be cool....

						   Our late nights continue.  Something about the summer makes me stay up late.  Probably the fact that I don't work in the summertime.  What am I saying?  Something about night time makes me stay up late--too late.  This is gonna hurt when school starts again in August.  4am is not an acceptable bed time.  Oh well.  SO...in the middle of creating this post I was interrupted with the news that J-Ho...ahem...J-Lo married Marc Anthony & William Hung headlined some concert with big stars.  Fun.  Moving on....  I was discussing with my husband earlier (like ya do) some ideas about the purpose of our existence with Christ's presence in our lives.  I have decided that I will recommend a book.  It is:  The  urlLink Purpose Driven Life  by Rick Warren.  It is a very good book that discusses what to do with your Christianity as you live your life out.  It is  an easy read.  I must confess that I am still only half-way through it but that has more to do with my foolishly trying to read 4-5 books at once.  I do recommend it, however, because it has some things to say about living the Christian lifestyle with purpose & meaning.  It is especially helpful if you find yourself in a place of questioning about God and your life and why you're here, etc.  So I heard the rain on the window outside my little office and my mind mistook it for a very loud exhale.  Don't know why.  It made me think someone was in the room.  Kelly came in and said that he wanted to get a crossbow in case someone tries to break in.  I told him no b/c he'd probably shoot his foot--or me--in that process.  He's going to have to settle for a baseball bat.  These thoughts don't seem to have a theme and are random compilations of my attempts to put something of worth out there tonight....hmmmm.  So, yeah...I'll go.... :)

						   So that's right...it's officially summer.  Woo!  School ended uneventfully and I decided to celebrate by going out and getting a tattoo.  Then I decided and let all the stops out and put my eyebrow ring back in.  I told my parents this and my dad accused me of feeling old.  Remember when parents thought their children were out of control when they got tattoos and body piercings?  Now they just think their children are feeling aged.   I started working on my first lesson for Sunday School which is this next Sunday (June 6).  Our material over Isaiah is not what I had hoped but that's ok.  I think Isaiah may be too big to spend one unit on--it being 66 chapters and all.  This first lesson deals with chpt. 64:1-9.  It is in the middle of a passage that is essentially a prayer for mercy & pardon.  Nonetheless, it does say some beautiful things about ACCEPTING RESPONSIBILITY for sinful behavior and crying out to God to be merciful and forgiving, to remember sins no more.  The curriculum says the main point of the lesson is to recognize our need for God.  This confused me at first  b/c I didn't see the connection b/tw the recognition of sin & therefore asking forgiveness and understanding a need for God.  I mean, yes, we need God b/c only He can offer forgiveness for sin but there seemed to be a deeper idea than just that basic tenet.  What I learned, however, is this: Israel's request for pardon came after God had hardened her heart to her sin and so she was stuck in a self-destructive pattern of uncleanliness.  This lead to all kinds of other issues--in this case, strife among the people over Jerusalem b/c it lay in ruin and Israel's desire to see it restored.  In the earlier parts of the passage (I say passage in lieu of chapter b/c the prayer spans the last part of chapter 63 & all of 64) Israel could only see the error of her ways by comparing the current situation with the past:  the history of God delivering Israel when she was behaving righteously.  This view allowed Israel to see the destruction caused by those errors and subsequently led her to desire forgiveness so she could be righteous in God's eyes once again.  Which brings me back to the need for God:  When sinful behavior persists & God allows us to become victims of our own poor choices, He cannot intervene b/c He cannot look at sin.  When we become spiritually (and otherwise) self-destructive the shambles we create for ourselves put us in a unique position to understand that WE NEED GOD to forgive us, to redeem us even in our sad state.  We need God in order to keep from putting ourselves in those positions in the first place.  So His silence, His SEEMING ignorance of the situation in which we find ourselves is his "umbilical" to say, "Hello?  What are you doing?  This behavior does not glorify me!" (this could also be a beautiful picture of the fact that God is still merciful EVEN when we sin) and from that, we should stop whatever it is we are doing, assess when God has done wondrous things for us in the past when we are doing His will and pull our heads from our proverbial asses and seek forgiveness--not whited sepulchre forgiveness but true, heart-wrenching, tearing-my-clothes-and-putting-on-sackcloth repentance.  From there, we should do what we KNOW we are supposed to be doing--do justly, love mercy & walk HUMBLY with our God.  *big breath* So that is my first lesson that I will teach this coming Sunday.  Ok.  Now I'm winded.  It's almost 4am so I really must go.  Comment, if you will.  :)

						   I know I mentioned writing about America and civil liberties and whatnot but I feel I need to take a small break from the political scene & post on something else.  In my field of work, I come across a mentality alot that is to be understood.  That mentality is immaturity.  I call it a mentality because legend has it that we (at some point in our growth) become mature and therefore leave behind immaturity.  Immaturity is better left to teenagers, folks.   I'm really not speaking to any specific person but rather in general terms.  So, in general, make sure that the reasons behind your people-bashing are not completely self-centered.   "Wait a minute!"  you say, "Are there any reasons behind people-bashing that aren't self-centered?"   The answer is no.  No, folks.  When you feel like you HAVE to get the last word, put someone down, make snide remarks, cough up snotty little comments to put someone in their place, or any variation thereof, you are acting out of your own selfish, self-centered, immature insecurities.  I realize that this may seem somewhat harsh.  And please be aware that this is aimed at No particular person, group of persons or organization.   "Why, then, are you saying all of these things?" you wonder to yourself (or aloud) Because, folks, it's hard enough to deal with this crap attitude with the people who haven't learned well enough not to act this way.  But when I see it, read it or experience it with those of us (adults, I mean--all of us, really) who are supposed to be setting a good example to the imps I work with (and the younger ones, too) it pisses me off on a grand scale.  I mean, come on.   "So give us the answers!" you may demand. Ok.  I will.  If someone does or says something to you in an attempt to MAKE you angry or drag you into an argument (or you feel as though that is why things are being said or done the way they are) WALK AWAY.   Walk away, gentle readers because the reaction they are looking for is the one that we really want to throw at their slimy faces.  Point blank--everyone has their own opinion and everyone has their own way of doing things.  If you disagree with someone else's way--suck it up and move on!  They probably disagree with you too!  Be polite enough & MATURE enough to get over it.  I've learned something in the past 7 years that has become so vital to my life:  our perspective controls a huge portion of our  reaction.  Really chew on that and let it sink in.  This is all I have to say for now.

						   I went to a professional development class today and learned how to make jpegs on Microsoft Word.  I have some comments about America and civil liberties and a few opinions on politics.  I will post them tomorrow, though, b/c I am very tired and need rest.  So I will say goodnight.

						   A curiosity I've noticed (both in myself & elsewhere) lately. We, as members of the body of Christ seem particulary aware of how down-the-toilet parts of the Church seem to be going. There are sects &amp; denominations whose misinterpretations of scripture & man-made rules &amp; guidelines have superseded their basic, fundamental doctrine. Political correctness also seems to have swept through and left quite a nasty stain on our attitudes toward basic service, sharing the gospel & conviction of the Holy Spirit. These are things upon which I could comment for a long while. But I think what I really want to say tonight confronts those members of the Church (including myself) who have complained for a long time about these aforementioned points.  Concerning the misinterpretation of scripture &amp; the man-made rules & guidelines:  Yes, those sects &amp; denominations who practice these often and with vigor have given the world a skewed view of what Christ originally meant for His church to be. My point is this: WE MUST BE INVOLVED IN THE CHURCHES if we ever hope to see these stupid dogmas & nonsensical ideas disappear. We cannot sit idly by and shake our heads sadly and wonder why the situation at church doesn't improve. We have all been given special talents that, I believe, God wants us to use in His church. We also lose credibility among the world if we have all the problems highlighted but also stand on the outside of a church and do nothing.  Concerning political correctness:  Three things (and probably more) have been jeopardized in the wake of political correctness at church. The first is basic service. When we become Christians what we are saying is, "Take my life b/c you gave me yours." That means that our lives then belong to Christ and He tells us what He wants us to do with our lives. On a fundamental level, that call on our lives is the same for every Christian--serve others. He didn't mean for us to serve ourselves with multi-million dollar buildings or serve those who are clean and easy to get along with. Jesus meant for us to serve anyone else besides ourselves--anyone. Even if they smell, are stupid, piss us off, disagree with our political ideals, look at us funny or any other variation of making us uncomfortable--these last few, especially. Of course many of you are nodding your heads or echoing "here, here!" thoughts of agreement as you read. I urge you to really take into consideration those we are to serve. This was idea was driven home to me many times last week and I can't implore you enough to really grasp this. Find someone you "hate" and serve them. Not b/c you want warm fuzzies and not b/c it will earn you anything. Do it b/c that is what Christ expects of us. The second item is sharing the gospel. We must also meet the spiritual needs of those we serve. Giving them a helping hand is only the first part of serving them. The second part is to share who Jesus is. However you feel you can do this--do it. Your service is not fully complete until you do. The third point is understanding and accepting conviction of the Holy Spirit concerning things you &amp; I both know that God doesn't want us involved in. God has guidelines He expects us to follow. When we choose not to follow them for whatever reason, we put a barrier (sin) between God and ourselves. Further, we cannot rely on how we feel emotionally to be convicted. We must put or own feelings aside and let the Holy Spirit search our hearts, minds &amp; actions. Our feelings can mislead us and most importantly are from us! We are flawed. We must accept this and put the Holy Spirit in charge of us to really accept our convictions.  This post is aimed at those who have wanted to see a positive change in church behavior and attitude for a long time. It starts with us. To point out problems, not be involved b/c of personal disgust or whatever and then expect the ones who made the foolish rules to change them is foolish of us. We also must learn that we have fucked up just as much and we must realize that it is not right to criticize without looking into our own lives and asking God to show us where we have failed Him. Just some thoughts.

						   I hate cliches.  They bug me.  They annoy me.  They make my skin crawl and my teeth curl.  They make me want to smack people.  I've discovered something, though.  I think cliches are subjective.  This discovery came to me as I explored the idea that things I enjoy and traits of my personality may be considered cliche by others.   Example:  I love Dave Matthews Band.  I think their music is amazing.  I love the blend of the instruments--uncommon instruments.  I love the  poetic-ness of the lyrics and the unique voice of Dave Matthews. I know a few who would call my taste for this band mainstream & cliche--sort of like being considered "uncultured swine" amongst those whose tastes are far more obscure than my own.   Dictionary.com defines a person who is cliche as someone who is predictable or superficial.  Now, while I wouldn't agree that superficiality (is this a word?) is something that I struggle with, I do think that some might label me as predictable.  To answer this obvious plight, one may say, "Who cares?  Be yourself!  Don't give heed to what others may think of you!"  This is all true.  HOWEVER....who enjoys being considered "predictable"?    Somehow I think my psyche has attached this idea of predictability to unimportance.  Let me lead you through this:  So if I'm predictable, that means that people are aware of how I will respond to stimulus of all kinds.  There is no intrigue or guesswork.  There is no surprise.  So therefore, everything I say or do would be boring at worst and tritely humorous at best.  Kind of in a "Oh, Jill.  I just new you would say/do that!  That's just so you!"  Now if I've calculated this correctly that would make me rather mundane.  The last time I check mundane & important did not share relevance in Roget's.  Now, to clarify the situation, this is simply a concern of mine.  If I happen to be mundane, well, so be it.  My dogs don't seem to mind so I don't suppose that those who love me will mind if I am quite common.  SO, I lay my cards on the table right here, right now: 1.  I LOVE DAVE MATTHEWS BAND AND I DON'T CARE WHO KNOWS IT. 2.  I LOVE THE LEFT BEHIND SERIES B/C THEY ARE GREAT STORIES & IF YOU ARE LAUGHING AT ME, GO RIGHT AHEAD, I CAN'T HEAR YOU. 3.  I LIKED THE MOVIE, "I AM SAM".  I CRIED--IT WAS GREAT. 4.  I HATE THE COUNTING CROWS.  THEY WHINE.  THEY'RE OVERRATED.  ADAM DURITZ IS NOT THAT GOOD-LOOKING. 5.  MY FAVORITE ACTRESS IS MEG RYAN--I LOVE HER HAIR & SHE PLAYS CHARACTERS THAT REMIND ME SOMEWHAT OF MYSELF. 6.  I LOVE CORNY THINGS.  DUMB PICTURES OF ANIMALS AND STUPID "HEE-HAW" HUMOR (AS MY HUSBAND PUTS IT) MAKE ME LAUGH...HARD. 7.  I WOULD LOVE TO MEET TAMMY FAYE MESSNER (BAKER). 8.  A PART OF ME WILL ALWAYS LOVE SHAWNEE, OKLAHOMA, USA--WHITETRASH CAPITAL, THOUGH IT MAY BE. 9.  I LOVE HAVING TEA...THAT'S RIGHT, LIKE A LITTLE OLD LADY WITH TEA CUPS & SAUCERS. 10.  I LIKE MEATLOAF'S SONG, "I WOULD DO ANYTHING FOR LOVE."  I SING ALONG AND LOVE THE VIDEO.  I am sure that I could probably come up with so many other things.  But if I'm as predictable as I'm beginning to think I am, you all will not be surprised by these things.  And those of you who claim to love me will not criticize me or attempt to change me.  So with that, I will say goodnight.  :)

						   So today is the 4th of July.  Independence Day.  Woo.  I could go into a long discussion about true freedom but I don't think I will.  I will, instead, talk about Chester.   Chester is the orange tabby cat who wandered into our yard and began antogonizing our Chowbrador, Sam about a week ago.  He is (despite the dog-antagonizing) a very sweet kitty who loves to be petted.  He occasionally and randomly attacks a hand or foot with his claws and teeth.  I like to think of this as one of two things:  1)He didn't like where I was going with that pet or 2)He's playful and young and just likes to randomly attack things.   He has been an outdoor kitty b/c my other 3 animals will go apeshit if he is brought inside.  There's a problem with being outside, though.  He had been just lounging on our patio--which was fine.  But the other day whilst doing yardwork, I noticed blood on the patio and realized he had been in a fight and gotten bit on the leg.  I am almost 100% sure that the fight occurred with another cat and not a rabid animal.  I can be that sure b/c I know the smell of male cat piss and that is what he reeked of when I found him injured (mmmmm, yummy!).  SOOOOOO, I brought him inside and with the aide of my friend Adrian, bathed him and tended to his wound.  He slept inside in our guest bedroom that night.   I tried to take him to the Humane Society when I first found that he was hurt.  I thought that they could help him out and find him a permanent INDOOR home.  But I couldn't do it.  I've been to that Human Society.  They have 3 rooms FULL of cats and I didn't want him to be shipped off to die after a 2-month stay in kitty hell.  (Not that it's necessarily hell but bunking with at least 25 other of your species in one room would be hell-ish to a human). All this to say, I have what I've always wanted--or wanted since I was 5.  Two boys and two girls.  Now I know what you're thinking:  "Jill," you say, "those are ANIMALS!  Don't become one of THOSE people whose pets eat at the table and are dressed up and pretty much treated like children."  Fear not.  For that is behavior of crusty old women*.  I am not one of those.  My dogs are treated like dogs.  They eat only dog food and poop outside and get smacked in the nose when they misbehave.  My cats are treated like cats.  They eat only cat food and I do not hesitate to spray water in their faces when they are being bitches.  I think my issue with these pets may stem from something more.  That, my gentle reader-folk, is the crux of the issue.   My issue is babies.  I've wanted to be a mommy since I was 5 years old.  Dolls were a huge part of my play when I was little.  My mother is a labor & delivery nurse and I'm sure that is why this desire remains steady.  I feel like my husband and I are in a good place to become parents.  Our jobs are steady.  He is in school to finish his degree so he can do what he's always wanted.  We have a home.  We have a fence.  But more than all that, we have a desire to love a child--our child--unconditionally.  My pets (and I do refer to them as pets and not children) allow me to love something other than myself.  Of course, I love my husband and my friends and family but what I mean is, I get to "practice" by being a disciplinarian (and this is absolutely necessary with a 7-month old, 60 lb puppy) and a nurturer and making sure that my pets are safe and healthy and "happy."   In short, I still very very much desire to be a mommy to a baby that is half me and half Kelly Morris Arthur Couri.  I want to see that baby and play with it's curly fro-head (which I am convinced it will have).  That day will come, I'm sure.  Until then, I have Bitsey, Oreo, Samson & Chester--2 boys, 2 girls.  *DISCLAIMER:  If you are related to or happen to be a person who treats animals like human beings, etc, please disregard the label of "crusty old woman."  I use that as a generality and it is not meant to imply that all individuals who do that behavior are "crusty old women."  I apologize for any offence.

						   What is life? A thousand roads, a thousand ways Why am I so afraid to move I crossed the line I'm stepping out so come what may I give it all cause I'm drawn to You As long as my heart is beating... Where You lead me I will follow Where You lead me I give my life away Where You lead me I will follow Forever and a day Forever and a day I can't deny Your very presence is my life And why would I ever turn away Cause deep inside I know that I cannot rely On anything less than faith As long as my heart is beating... Where You lead me I will follow Where You lead me I give my life away Where You lead me I will follow Forever and a day This is all I'm dreaming of To live completely in Your love So this is life Where You lead me I give my life away Where You lead me I will follow Forever and a day Forever and a day  Ever have a moment that you know something without the shadow of a doubt--know it in your heart, not just in your head?  I thank God for those moments.  Those are the moments where I can live without doubt, worry, anxiety & fear.  It's a great moment of worship.  It is not an emotional feeling but deeply spiritually resounding.  The more I learn about myself and the more I learn about living how God wants me to live, the more I realize that I have to live apart from my emotional reactions.  This is something that is extremely hard to do.  For those of you who know me well, you know that I can be highly emotional.   My emotions can sometimes dictate how I respond to certain things.  Example:  My husband does something I don't like so I get angry and yell at him.   Now, most of the time this is not the appropriate response.  No, no--I will go as far as to say that this is never the appropriate response.  The problem with the response is that it is a reaction--devoid of any concern over what kind of affect my words would have on my spouse.  The reaction is all about me--I'M MAD and because he did that to ME, I'M going to yell at him and then I  will feel better.  And living by my faith means that NOTHING SHOULD BE ABOUT ME.  I should count others as better than myself.  I know that I am not perfect and I have definitely failed at this.  And I can hear Jesus' words resounding in my head, "Be perfect, as your Father in Heaven is perfect!"  But I think Jesus' knew that we were incapable of this which is why He did what He did.  That does not, however, mean we shouldn't try.  I believe it means that once we make a choice to live for God that we should consciously choose to do what we know God would want us to do. Anyway, I say all of this about emotions, etc to say that really learning how to worship and be still and listen to God starts with experiencing things through the Holy Spirit and not emotions.  Emotions are from us and therefore flawed.  The Holy Spirit is from God and, well, God is not flawed.  Just thought I'd share.  :)

						   I don't even know what to say in response to the previous untitled post.  I erased two or three sentences of explanation prior to these two because I don't know quite how to pull any humor (that anyone else would get) from said post.  My spouse is a random freak...and I mean that totally in a loving way.  :P  I did dye my hair--the color on the box said deepest red brown...or some variation thereof.  It looks pretty cool.  And of course it will fade as time goes by and I think that it will fade in a pretty normal way--like not turn diarrhea brown.  Gotta go now and get ice cream from Chevron at 12:40 am.    PS--Here's my mantra for the next four days:  "Hell no!  I won't go!"
