      I have *finally* chosen the school I want to work at, and luckily, they have also chosen me! I just need to sign the contract and send it with the rest of my documents.   I will leave the first week of August (probably the 4th or 5th) and begin work the 9th or 10th. The school is in the Jangjeon-dong part of Busan near PNU (Pusan National University), which is good because this is the main area that other Western English teachers hang out in, so I won't feel totally isolated. It is also a convenient area for shopping and transportation.   My working hours will be 9-4 M-F to begin with, then in the Fall that will change to 1:30-8 pm M-F. I will be teaching elementary students in classes of ten for 40 or 50 minutes each. For this work I will receive round trip airfare, 2 million won (around $1700) per month, all Korean holidays off and paid, 10 paid vacation days, 3 paid sick days/year, health insurance (not dental), and a studio apartment that is furnished, including A/C, TV, washing machine and microwave.   Pretty good deal!   I am 3/4 excited & 1/4 panic stricken. I suppose that is normal.

      ...there lived a girl named Kelly.  -------------------- -------------------- -------------------- --- I hate beginning journals. I feel like anything I write will seem trite and incomplete in retrospect. I never know how to start. Here goes nothing. -------------------- -------------------- -------------------- ---  As I write this, I am still in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, my home of nearly 6 years.   After graduating from University and realizing that I had very few marketable skills coupled with a huge amount of debt, I began casting my net for gainful employment that I might not loathe. This yielded nothing for nearly a year.   Stumbling upon ads for "Teach English in Korea!" enough times during my search for that elusive dream job, my curiosity got the better of me and I decided to have a look... I liked what I found. After reading everything I could get my hands on about South Korea, I applied to a few of these ads and posted my resume on various message boards and job sites for teaching English as a second language. The results were overwhelming, the verdict was in: I was moving to Korea to teach English.  As of this post, I have spent countless hours researching this decision, country and culture. I have spoken on the telephone into the wee hours of many nights with various Koreans, New Zealanders, and others in interviews after my eight-hour workdays. Finding the right job has become my second job, but the more I learn the more excited I become.   In preparation, I have had a physical (A+) and the recommended immunizations (F), traveled to the Korean Consulate in Chicago to get my college diploma notarized (it was either that or send the original to Korea... no thanks!) and am in the process of obtaining new contact lenses, a teeth cleaning and fillings, all in order to ensure that I am the cleanest, healthiest, most well-documented Kelly that I can be. *sparkle*   Additionally, I have put in my notice at my current job (UWM Children's Center, Enrollment Assistant) and at my apartment. I am in the process of finding a home for my beloved BleuBear (*cries*) and, perhaps most importantly, of finding the "right" job in Korea. It's a lot of work, and hopefully well worth it.  I think it will be.

      When I was still deciding which school I wanted to work for I had the opportunity to ask the teacher who I would be replacing a few questions.  This teacher was very kind and helpful; the response gave me a much better and more personalized idea of the situation I would be getting into. I have posted this response below:     Hi Kelly,  Of course it's okay that you're writing to me; in fact it's the wise thing to  do!  Where do I start?  Your first question was about the school.  It's a six floor building, but not very big (there are 6-7 rooms on each floor).  Institutes in Korea can be three, four or ten times bigger, but not to say that it's indicative of how well the school is doing. Apparently this school has a good  reputation.  Most English institutes only teach English, but the director, who majored in math in university, initially opened an institute for math, and over the years with a lot of success he has been able to expand his school.  At present the institute offers all school courses (Korean,  society, science, English, math, and so on).   These classes are mainly for middle school and high school students, who make the bulk of the students in the institute (and obviously you needn't worry about them, because you won't be teaching them)... but the elementary school children come to the  institute to study either math, English or both. The English classes are taught mostly on the 5th floor and the office for the teachers is on the 6th floor.  The school is fairly new and clean(nothing in Korea is old, they build and demolish here at an astonishing rate), there's a.c. in the  summer, heating in the winter.  Most of us order our dinner in the office(it's cheap and common)...Bottom line, I've got no complaints about the school.  My current schedule is 1:30pm-9pm (I basically teach 23 hours a week, and the rest of the time I prepare for class, eat my lunch/dinner), but it changes in the summer and winter vacation...For example if you choose to take this job, you will be coming in the middle of the summer vacation so  you'll be working from 9am to 4pm (approximately).  In total there are over 100 students. Class size is no bigger than 10 students.  Ages range from 8-13.  Levels vary. I am the only foreign teacher, which I thought was a bad thing, but I've heard so many bad stories about teachers not getting along in institutes, and having big catfights (lol, ok, I'm dramatizing a bit).  Anyways, the people I work with are great. Xxxxxxx, the headteacher who will be calling you tomorrow is a lovely person, and I actually consider her my good friend.  I also work with Xxxxx and Xxxxxx who are wonderful, kind-hearted girls.  This wasn't the case when I started...the former head teacher was a snake.  So, if you join the school you'll be in good hands, I guarantee it.  These girls will answer all your questions and take care of you.  The director is ok.  I don't think he's a bad person or a good person.  As a boss he's been good to me:  he pays on time, he doesn't butt-in my business, he takes us out for dinner sometimes, he's fairly reasonable.  I don't think he treats the other teachers with the respect they deserve, but I've had no bad experience with him or real contact with him (he works downstairs, sometimes we'll all have meetings, but they don't concern me so I rarely see the man).  In comparison to other directors he's probably one of the better ones, simply because he pays on time, and he does follow through the contract.  He paid for my visa trip to Japan, for my airplane ticket from Canada, monthly salaries are directly deposited to my bank account... again no complaints! By the way the contract is very standard, so you're basically getting the same deal as most foreign teachers.  Which is pretty darn good.  I've managed to save here a lot more money than I would back home.  The living conditions are good.  The oneroom apartment I live in is pretty big compared to other teachers' rooms I've seen.  The building is fairly new, so again, it's clean, it has everything: bed, tv/vcr, fridge, drawer, 2 burner stove, shower, a.c., heating.  The location is great, you'll be five minutes from the PNU which is one of the downtown areas.  If you like to go out there's a couple of clubs just blocks from the apartment.  Food is cheap, you'll probably eat out mostly, but there is a supermarket very close to the school.  Overall, I would recommend this school, because the staff is good, the hours are good, I get paid on time, the kids are good (in some schools the kids throw things at the foreign teachers...this type of behavior does not occur at this school), and the location is really good.  I have been teaching children and adults now for the past three years, so I know quite a bit.  If I stay in Busan when you come, I'll give you a proper tour and also give you lots of advice and tips about living here.  If you have more questions, let me know.  Take care Kelly and good luck to you.  Respectfully,  Xxxxx Xxxxx

      Why I am moving to Korea.   I was browsing another blog and ran across a great reply. I have modified it to meet my own devices here. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Why AM I moving to Korea? Here is a brief list:  -Because I can. -Because America (mostly its president) is particularly insane these days. -Because I have nothing to lose. And a lot of loans to repay. -Because I needed to vacate Milwaukee, and most other American places would lead to another vacuous office job. -Because it's much more exciting than most other options. -Because I needed to simplify my existence and stop nesting. Twenty-four is too early to nest.
