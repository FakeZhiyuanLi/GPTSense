       A slow start this morning..    &nbsp;  Had a hard time getting up this morning. Body is still aching from trying to recover from the MANY medical issues I am having as of late. Hopefully, things will work out. I am optimistic that sometime in the near future I will wake up feeling relatively good and have the engery I had BEFORE I had kids!    &nbsp;  I just found out that a friend of mine from work is having ANOTHER baby. Her youngest is 9 months old.. UGH, better her than me. Having 1 baby is hard.. having 2 is HARDER! We have adjusted pretty well and have a nice little routine down.. hopefully, she can figure out a similiar plan-because she is going to need it!    &nbsp;  Thought of the day: I never actually thought I would say that I am SICK to DEATH of spiderman. I am going spiderman crazy.    &nbsp;  Until next time spiderma...err. ...see what I mean?

       &nbsp; So, here we go.. A new blog? A new start to life? Okay, so not REALLY.. but it sounded good!      &nbsp;   I had not blogged in quite some time. Which was strange, since I really did enjoy an outlet on my life. I can write in my blog and it doesn't talk back... How NICE! =)     &nbsp;   My family.. well is not really being a family right now. Its hard. I think that sometimes as humans we get selfish and the "its all about me's" start surfacing. This shouldnt be an everyday thing though.. and its starting to get that way. Have we really resorted to worry about ourselves and no one else? What is family there for if this is how things go?    My family is acting very UN-Family like. makes me want to run for the hills.. or alteast hide until said family gets the hint! ha! j/k     &nbsp;   Lots of things going on in life right now.. new job at work.. my son is turning 1, my other son is going to be starting pre-school.. my boyfriend has a good job..Life isn't too bad.. now if we could just work on the FAMILY part!     &nbsp;   I missed my blog.

       Okay...so I am achieving two goals at once..      A) to lose weight.. I want to "wow" them at the Christmas party this year      B) to keep in touch w/ my best friend so that we can always depend on each other. (Everyone needs one  good  friend, right!)        I am blessed to have her in my life.. She always was a good listener and a good friend.   I was thinking today.. Maybe I should go into business... Have you ever LOVED some place so much that you wanted to own it? That's how I feel about Crystal Palace-It holds so much of my childhood its scary. Boy, if the walls could talk, imagine what they would say.... (smile)      Maybe I can conquer that dream after I achieve the above two...

       Lots of changes in life these days:      I have decided that its time to get off my lazy bumm and lose some weight. I am sick of being big and being classified as a "big girl". I am motivated, and ready to be healthy and happy.      My work is showing signs of change. This is not unfamiliar here, but the changes are about to come in huge waves in about a month. It will actually be a good thing for me and my job-a possible management position! WOOHOO! Its about time they saw my potential!      My Lakers.. (sigh) I dont know what they are going to do! The took my boyfriend, GP and sent him to Boston(Boo!) but... BUT they got Local Boy MARCUS BANKS!!! Former CMHS basketball star! (And not too bad looking either)       I am excited but nervous of all the changes in my life.. but I am confident it will all work out!      Thought for the day: Is going to get a drink cheating? Or just a drink between people? What if its w/ a person of the opposite sex-then is it cheating?

       Well, its official-My crush will officially be putting in his two weeks tommorow. I am so bummed. This guy is SUCH a nice guy.. great personality, good looks.. the total package. I am really sad to see him go.      I guess the question is-WHO am I going to look at when he is gone!?

       Well, Its official-My brother will be leaving to go to Frt Irwin for 18 months in about a week. A month ago my thoughts were "Okay, we have a month-LOTS of time"... Now that month is over and its starting to hit me that I might not see my brother for awhile. I have lots of emotion about this. I am glad he is staying state side and not going overseas but he said he still MIGHT get called up to go overseas. Despite the situation, I am very proud of him. More than he will probably ever know.      Thought for the day: If you love someone, let them go-If they come back to you it was meant to be...I used to say this phrase a lot in high school and it never really held any real truth until now. Adam and I drifted apart 6 years ago and split on ugly terms only to be reunited in a bar/pub over the weekend. Do I feel the exact same way I did when we split 6 years ago? No-In fact, Although I will always remember him for who he was THEN, I think I like him better now. Does this mean the Adam that I loved is gone? Does it mean that the "new" Adam is someone I don't really "love", just someone that reminds me of the Adam of old?  Adam and I will never be the same people we were then, there is no way we could be. The most we could hope for is happy thoughts on both ends on what we shared THEN and use that as a basis for a  friendship  now. So to finish off this thought.. Adam and I let each other go a long time ago and found each other now-as FRIENDS.. so in that sense-it was meant to be.

       I didn't get drunk when I was 16... or 18... or even 21... I waited until I was 24 to do it! Too much wine & an ex-boyfriend later.. I was too drunk to drive home..so at 5:30 in the morning.. I did what any other drunkin person would do.. I called my daddy.      I guess I consider that my "get out of jail free" card..Next time, they might not be so understanding...      On a positive note..It was SO good to see Adam. I am by no means over him.. will proubably never be totally over him.. but it definately was a step in the right direction.

       Good News on the home front.. The "Purple Monster" AKA my car.. is fixed. It no longer goes up to the "H" everytime we drive in it! WOOHOOO! Hopefully it can hold out awhile longer-then we will be able to buy a new car.  I got her washed last night-looks good as new!      **Crush Update** He is so damn cute. He has a natural cuteness about him. Maybe thats why I like him. For those who know me, he has an "adam" type flair to him.. I liked adam because he was a normally hot guy.. not because he was a macho stud who seeked me out for typical "male" reasons.       I just saw the movie 13 going on 30. It is on the top of my favorites list. LOVED IT! The movie had another natural cute guy in it, the guy that played the 3o year old Matt. Yum!

       AHHHHHH!!!! Phew, that felt good. So much stress right now. My job(my "special" job) is coming to an end and its getting more stresful each and every day. I find myself having to take a few extra "smoke" breaks (I Don't smoke--just go out to the smoking area for some R & R) to get through the day.      My crush.. yummy.. Today he called me "sweet pea".. so CUTE! =)   It sucks that he will be leaving in less than 1 month.. who am I going to look at when he is gone! ? ! ? =(      Back to the stressful job! Yippeee.....

       Okay.. Call me paranoid.. but here is a funny/stupid story. There is a girl at my work who seems to never wash her hair. Now before anyone yells at me for being mean.. I KNOW there are people out there w/ greasy hair.. but this is over the top greasy! Yesterday, due to my lack of sleep, I didnt get to wash my hair, therefore I myself.. was greasy. I felt like such a hypocrite.   Have no worries though.. today, I am refreshed with refreshed hair-and she is still greasy. UGH. I just want to throw her head under the sink in the bathroom. Gross.      My uncle & cousins are here for a week. It will be nice to spend some time w/ them. My oldest cousin, Chessie, is a senior this year. Hahaha, I remember when she was just learning to walk! I talked with my uncle last night about my mom and her health as well as a few other issues. He is a good listener-we never really talked in the past.. but I am glad we are talking now.      I miss my friend.. seems to be a touch and go type relationship between us. We need to get together ALICIA.. if for nothing else-to work on my dancing skills (ha!)

       Okay.. so beleve me when I say.. I am happily involved. Have been for almost 5 years.  HOWEVER.. this is a super cute guy at my work. Boy is he yummy to look at..not bad to talk to either. Seems like we have a lot in common. He was in the military(Army), moved here from NJ to be closer to his parents, Single(prev girlfriend was long term deal), dresses nice(Tommy).. Just all around good looking, great personality type of guy. Crushes are so fun! This guy had to come sit w/ me so I could train him on my job, skip tracing. I was actually scared to DEATH that I wouldnt be able to speak straight. That hasnt happened in long, long time. Luckily he broke the ice.. "wow, you smell damn good" I beleve was what he said. Sweet, Cute and a compliment.. what a guy!      My poor family.. Everyone is sick.. Mom is still under the weather, Mo, Darshaun & Dj all sick. It was a rough, rough night last night. Mo looked bad, Darshaun was coughing and clingy and DJ would not go to sleep because the poor little guy couldnt breath out of his nose. I think the teeth are coming(finally!)      So after getting hardly any sleep last night.. I am here, at work.. staring at the cute guy and trying to get some work done! Guess I better get to it!      BTW.. if you are reading this and know Jayme's blog address, please email or comment on my blog... Email:  urlLink Blue2Eyes3@aol.com       Thank you!

       So much stress in my life.. my new job.. STRESSFUL.. the fact that BOTH of my boys are sick.. STRESSFUL.. the fact that my youngest son(who just turned 1) has NOT ONE TOOTH.. STRESSFUL! The fact that my OLDEST son, who is going to start school is STILL in his "terrible two's" STRESSFUL.. my mom is still not feeling up to par-STRESSFUL..My current medical issues-STRESSFUL..EVERYTHING IS STRESSFUL!      Okay, so for those who know me, the real-deep ME.. I am a stresser. I tend to stress, stress some more.. then stress a little more after that.  NO wonder I am 50 pounds over weight, have pimples all over my face and feel like crap-STRESS is a disease.      Okay, now that I am done Stressing/Yelling/Taking things out on my blog.. I am done! =)       I feel MUCH better...

          Dj's birthday was so cute! I can't beleve he is one already! CRAZY!!  What a weekend it was.. I have a friend that is going threw a rough time... My mom is still having a hard time.. it was Dj's birthday..I am trying to plan a trip to disneyland for NEXT year(yes, I am a planner-these things have to be ORGANIZED).. trying to clean my house.. meet the new neighbors..etc etc etc..      Didnt feel much like a 3 day weekend.. dontcha HATE that!      Thought for the day: If being a parent was easy.. everyone would be one. Being a parent is only for the strong at heart..sometimes, your just not ready. On that same note.. sometimes you are not ready but have to become ready very, very quickly! *smile*
