      I'm starting to think that maybe I'm some kind of angel of death in training or something. K so maybe I'm not that bad but in the past week and a half I have come up on 3 accidents immediately after they happened. Luckily I don't think anyone has died from them (well, not while I was there) but they have augmented in severity. The first was a guy fell off his motorcycle and went sliding down the road with his bike beside him; I actually saw that one. The next one involved two cars meeting on a really bad set of curve on this road her in Sylacauga; don't know as much about that one, but I was like the 5th or 6th car there.  Then today when I was coming home from a YSA conference in Huntsville, I was going down 208 and came up on another one. This one I didn't actually see, but that was because the cars in front of me were obscuring my view. But I was one of the first cars there, and so I stopped and I saw this man from behind where I parked running toward one of the two cars involved that was on its side. So I got out and went the same way he was running to see what I could do to help, by the time I was over there the man and several women were trying to push the truck that was on its side back over. My first thought was that it was a odd thing to do because the police would want to see things as the were left by the accident, however they were screaming something about a man being trapped, and then I saw why it was necessary. A man had been thrown from the truck, and now the truck was on top of him. I immediately started to help to right the truck and free the man, and luckily one or two more fellows showed up right behind me and we were able to push the truck back over. At this I could see the man, he look in pretty bad shape, I thought for sure he was dead or about to die, but I didn't have much time to think about that because the original man that was there was trying to get the truck door open, and was saying something about getting a woman out of the truck; I helped him with no avail with the doors until he jumped in the open window to try and pass the lady out... The lady in the truck was down in the floor, I didn't notice she was in there till then, I had no idea about her when we righted the truck, but her then I noticed her legs were poking out of the window so I went around and tried to help get her out, but the other two men were there and had her legs, and the man in the truck was lifting her head up and out. Once out of the truck we took the lady over to the side of the road and set her in the grass. From here the women who were there were awesome, they found rags and blankets to put under there heads and tried to comfort them and take care of the two as best they could. I stayed around in case there was something I could do, so the best thing I could think of at the time was to help direct traffic, as this was blocking both sides of 280.  Shortly before the paramedics arrived a surgeon showed up and started checking the two people, however the paramedics arrived really quite fast and started helping. I believe the girl in the other car was alright for the most part, apparently after it happened she got out of her car and staggered over to the median, but she was just really shaken. Well eventual the police came and more paramedics, like I said the guy was in a bad shape, and they decided to get a helicopter in and airlift him out. We kept traffic moving as long as we could but eventually we stopped both sides of 280 to allow the helicopter to land on the highway, and so the cops could take pictures and mark where the cars were. By the time the helicopter got there they had striped the man down and put a blanket on him to check him for internal bleeding and the like. We also found out sometime that the man had palsy and was in a wheelchair, witch we found in the road. Eventual the got the man air lifted out and the woman in an ambulance. While they were still taking pictures the sheriff of Shelby county came over to me and the original man that was helping, and thanked us for what we had done, and told us we did the right thing in getting the truck off the man and the woman out, then he gives us all these coin like things that are kinda neat. Luckily the also let us go before they let the rest of the cars that were waiting to get through go. However in my rush to see what I could do, I had left my lights on, SO I had to go back out and get a officer to come over and jump my car off, I don't think he minded too much because of the circumstances. Anyway, wow...  Well that's a chunk of text, but I figure its alright, I just wanted to get it all out. If I keep coming up on accidents like this I may need to change my e-mail address. But seriously I wonder if there is something else I could do in situations like that. I mean I don't think they were members, but should I have offered them a blessing, or the woman at least (she was more aware of what was going on). The thought passed though my mind briefly while I was there, and I dismissed it and said a silent prayer instead. But I always wonder what more I could do in situations like that. Maybe I should brush up on my first aid, and trama treatment, especially if this keeps up. Perhaps there is something I should learn from this. This just reaffirms what I already do, in that we should always wear our seatbelts!!! I already do, but after this past month, what I've seen... wow...  other than that my weekend was good, the conference was good, and I enjoyed myself, meet some people, and such. It was odd b/c I spent most of the weekend with people I didn't know before, not typical thing I would do. Anyway I don't feel much like typing about that now sooo. Ill leave it at it was fun, meet some good people, had fun dancing and yeah... I enjoyed it. Perhaps more on that later, but don't hold your breath... But I should sleep, 'cause I didn't do much of that this weekend, if you know what I mean! (so I cant sleep on a flat mattress...)

      I think the frantic romantics said it best when they said "life ain't easy as a fresh RM, when all the girlies you be wantin' say you ain't for them" not that that really applies to my day or week or month in anyway, but its in my head.  I'm about to go away, but I need to get hold of Holly first. I've been debating what I should wear for the dance on Saturday, because its carnival theamed. I was thinking of wearing my capoeira pants, and such, but I'm scared to stand out too much, and I would have to be barefoot, and that's not comfortable, besides I doubt anyone would get it. OR I could go the other way and walk around with juggling stuff all night, but I hate having things on me, I never know what to do with them, besides only clubs or devil sticks would be really cool, and I would do those for like 5 min, and get board, so I figure ill just go normal and such.  k... well...

      Well, this is odd, im awake before noon, a novilty for me. My brain dosnte work as well in the morning, its more just sitting stairing, remembering im supposte to be thinking, and trying to think again... Humm... i was going to basicly rewrite what was lost, but i cant rememeber what it was exactly, that i wrote, well i kinda can, but not at the same time.  One thing i remember, that i wish i didn't, was the bad news i got yesterday. Yeah so i found out that Kevin, the kid i was going to be rooming with at Ydaho is not comming anymore. Yes that really sucks for me. Every stupid semeseter i have to get new roomates, every semester, and im sick of it. Its like some kind of cosmic rule that every four months i have to get a new pool of friends, just really annoying. Anyway so now i have now real guy friends up there i can hang out with, and i dont know a soul im living with. I dont want to have to get to know a new room roomate, thats probably the worst part. I just know how i am, it takes me awhile to get warmed up to people and to feel comfortable around people so that i can be myself, so im not looking foward to being uncomfortable for however long it takes.   Oh yeah i also decided last night (though i doubt ill actually do anything about it) that i need to learn how to read menues, er perhaps just will myself to read them. Anyway last night i went to a mexican restraunt with my family, now its normal for me to be the last one to order, simply because im undesisive, but of late i cant even seem to bring myself to read the menu. Last night was the worse i have ever been, i didnt read one word of the menu, till it was my turn to order. So i just skimed the menu and pointed to somthing, witch turned out to be somthing on the lunch menu. After that i ordered what my mom got, 'cause it sounded alright.*  I have a really bad tast in my mouth, im going to drink somthing... brb... not that you, the reader, could tell that im gone, but if i tell you my actions its more like im actualy here telling you, the reader, myself... k hold on...     Im back.  After dinner we went by wal-mart and i finaly got a belt that i could put my confedriate states belt buckel on, im really pelased. In adition to the belt i found some cowboy boots i used back when i showed cows, and i have a cowboy hat, so i was wearing the boots yesterday feeling all western. This is not my new style or anything, but i just think its awsome so now when i go to the weekly country dance** i can look the part, im excited.  I miss dancing, though i fear i've forgoten so much. I really hope my sechdual works out so i can take the dance classes i want. I think it will as far as standard is conserned, i believe that the gols class is 8 in the morning, not happy about that but would be worth it. Unfortunatly i dont beleave latan will work out again this smester, and im sad for this thing. The ironic thing is i love to dance and take all these dance classes, but when i go to dances i hardly dance. Its partialy because how i dacne is too prpoer and needs way too much room for normal dances. If i was too dance like that at a normal dacne the girl would be wondering why my arms are so high, why im so close, why we keep running into people, and why i never look at her, i fear. (though the last thing she may appreciate..)  Wow if i just sit here long enough i can write a ton of stuff! Anyway sicne my power went out last night and i lost the post after that im really parinoid of loosing this post, i keep saving it to notepad. Did i mention that i want to build a computer?    * I would write what we ordered but i cant spell, and doubt i could spell what it was close enough to get on the spellcheckers radar... thats so sad.  ** I go to the country dance for the dancing not so much the music, but contry dancing is fun. In conjucntion with the country dance they have a swing dance in another room, witch i actualy perfer, and is more fun to dance. However less people go to the swing kids side because they go over there and get intimidated b/c if you are just learnting the Lindy hop looks really hard. To tell the turth im kinda intimdated myself to dance with a lot of the girls there, they all seem so much better than myself. Also the Lindy is a physical dance, and it really hard to talk while doing it, and it really tires you out, or gets you dizzy.

      I wrote a good post after the power went out, but then when I tried to post it, the thing went all gay and I lost the post... so all ya'll get for now is a lame excuse... sorry kids, more later, I'm hittin the hay.  Man, I really want my post back, I'm tempted to rewrite it, but I really need to sleep more regularly, aahhhaahaahaa!!! τι να κάννω!!! (what should I do!!!) I don't really want to rewrite it, but I want what I said to be posted. This is lame, and all I can think about now is pick up lines... well ill leave with this: there are two fish in a tank, one says to the other "how do you drive this thing?"

      Do be do be dooo... um... So after I showered today I was talking to my mom about my academic penalties that apparently I was under for 5 min today, and as I sometimes do when avoiding unpleasant conversations I started to mess with my hair, and I realized I didn't rinse out the conditioner. Man I hate when I do that; means I have to get wet again, at least partially (witch is worse than totally) and dry off again, and that's really annoying. Unfortunately for me since I started using conditioner I have done this quite often. See for most of my life I didn't use conditioner, thought it would make my hair too, something... But one day when I was having my hair cut the girl convinced me to start using conditioner, so I started. I kinda like it what it dose. Speaking of hair though I really need it cut, its beginning to really annoy me.  Humm... I thought I had 3 things I was going to talk about, but I can only remember two of them... I did the one, and now I don't really want to go into the other, but the short version is: G4techtv is gay, really gay. I was really into this one anime they were showing and the stopped it 1/2 way though the series, to show other gay one... This is not the only thing but its the last straw, I used to really like Tech TV, then they merged with G4 a gaming channel, and it all went to pot. All the G4 shows are sophomoric, you have to be a moron to watch them... Any way this really annoyed me, and I was going to rant and rave about it, but I don't feel like going into it deeper than this at this point.  I got a comment from someone I don't know on this thing. I thought it was awesome... his name was demitri, a greek name, so I went to his blog to find out more, and his is in spanish, and he's from mexico, so demitri if you read this thankx! I figure he came accrost this by searching for similar interests, b/c he had capoiera as a interest also...  I spend way too much time on  urlLink homestarrunner.com , they should make a homestarrunner trivia game somewhere, that would be awesome, I could hold my own at it. I come to this conclusion when my sister holly asks if homestar has a house and I tell her what Strongbad  urlLink e-mail  to go to (by name), where they are in H*Rs house. ah well, there are worse sites that I could spend time on, like g4techtv.com, man since the merger they cant even put together a decent site... its never updated, no content, ('cept if you are looking for a cheat code). so gay sorry I regressed there.  Speaking of H*R I decided that it was time to change what my start button has on it. It did say "Ben's Computer" but I only did that to show my dad how I changed it, but it kinda stuck for a while. any way I have now changed my button to say "eh Steve!" it works for now.  oh yeah I really don't like AOL, I was on earlier and for the second time this summer I was kicked offline because apparently I signed on somewhere else. The last time this happened I changed my password immediately. Tonight however I let it slide, and figured it was a fluke, but about 8 min later it happened again. This time I changed my password and it hasn't happened since. So I'm guessing that AOL's passwords aren't that hard to get past, so I started to figget with it and found that passwords on AOL can only be 8 charitors long, (the password I thought I was using was 9 charitors) any way just more for me to complain about about AOL. Cant waite till I get back to broadband...  I should go to bed, even though I don't have work tomorrow... its my last week of work and I only work 3 days! anyway I don't work tomorrow, I really should try to do something in that time, but it seems like so much effort. so ill probably sit at home and complain on this thing about something... OH!!!! I remembers the other thing, I think I found my problem with kicking a football (soccer ball) tonight. For some stupid reason when I kick with any power the ball will shank off to the right most of the time. Also I was noticing the other day my big toe on my right foot hurt. Well tonight I put 2 with 3 and got 8, saw that wasn't right took away 4 from the answer and got 4, figured that was close enough and turned in my paper. I found that I raise my big toe up when I kick, so its getting messed up, and is providing a uneven surface for the ball, forcing it right. So I taped my big toe to the one next to it and it made a huge improvement. the ball went straighter, harder, and I had more control. Now this may only be a "feather" (think dumbo) but for now it works for me, er it did, ill try it again tomorrow.  I love my dog and all, but right now he stinks. Yeah I'm sure sometimes I stink too, but he likes it, I try to wash when I start to stink. He finds stink and will roll in it. At least he's not one of those annoying dogs that always wants attention.  la la la dum de dum... Oh I finale got my Berimbau strung tight enough so that it sounds right, now if I could only play it correctly for more than one iteration. Speaking of Capoeira, I'm so gonna get beet down when I go back to the club, man I should practice more, but its so hard to want to do without a partner.  well its late, er, its early, so sleep yes

      Man, I really meant to go to bed earlier tonight... But anime unleashed didn't show at 11, I didn't figure on it being on at 3 either, but I'm glad I checked, cause it was... Any way the point is I watched it and while I did I messed with the HTML for this blog. One thing about this site, its not very user friedley, but you can mess with the HTML and change the way it looks, if you know the language... Anyway I changed some of the words on the site to things like "hey kids!" and so fourth. I plan on making more changes later, but who knows... I figured out how to make this box bigger, but I'm not sure its a great idea, there may be a reason its this size. One reason I know its this size is to make the corners all round, if I enlarged it it would loose the roundness, at least on one side (because the corners are actually a definite sized graphic) that's why its always the same size, I could change it to accommodate the size of the window but yes... It was fun figuring it out though. I learned some HTML before, but that was a while ago... And I never did anything this complicated. Luckily I know enough about how programs are set up to figure it out and "break the code", so I guess I didn't need to get my sister after all, or a book. Anyway I'm proud of myself.  Just thinking as I was writing that, I need some kind of symbol to let the reader know I'm about to ramble mindlessly, and they may want to skip a bit. Like I could have used it up where I was explaining about the corners, actual I could use it on this whole post, actual 90% content you read on this blog you may want to skip. Perhaps a easer thing to have is a symbol that means this may be worth reading... humm.... Ok bed for real.

      Yes! I'm smarter than internet explorer! Stupid auto formatting was not allowing me to put the links in my favorites folder in the order that I wanted, but I beat it, and now its like I like... The secret was to remove everything from that folder and then return it in the order top down that I wanted it to appear. Sometimes I really hate when computers are smarter than they should be, like when you are on a login screen and you already have your name in and are 1/2 way though your password and then it decides you need to automatically be put on your name space, so 1/2 the password goes up before your name. Maybe its just me... Maybe its my computer, I probably need more memory, but then again don't we all. This brings me to what I really want to do... Build my own computer. Yeah yeah I really like my dell, but the challenge and coolness of making my own is very intreaging. I've been thinking about it and if I use bits of my dell it wont cost as much as I was originally fearing, however I would have to sacrifice the dell. But I could use the chip (a P4), and maybe some memory from this box, monitor (though what I really really want is a flat screen) and the cheap stuff like keyboard and such.  My dad got some beads, and we put together some komboulois (or Begleri to be technical) now I have a total of 7. The glass one chipped today, but I have a new favorite, one made with beads made of horn, just the string needs to be improved. Also he had the great idea that dice would be heavy and probably wouldn't crack, and yeah they work great, a little different being cubes though.  k time for some milk...

       k I may have to start a new journal on one of the other fine sites, if not all of them. Mainly because I just posted a comment on another blog site, and I had to do that as anonymous, and that's kinda tacky, so if for no other reason to get my name on the stuff I do. Besides I've been looking at them, er livejournal anyway, and it has some features that this doesn't have that I would desire unto myself, that this site lacks... Such as current mood, and music... Ah, I'm so indecisive!!! But this site has some sweet features, like I can edit old entries, have more than one blog, or chage the date of the blog anywhere from 1999 to 2006! (it would be awesome if I could do a blog from some time B.C. or impersonate someone like Pythagoras, yeah that would be awesome) anyway that was my rant on journals for now.

      Since I'm on here I might as well post. I think I have more fun messing with the settings of this thing... Anyway I'm just debating weather to have the dates in greek or english, it doesn't really matter I guess, just makes the archive dates say Ιούλιος instead of July, and πμ instead of am, and so fourth... ah I'm so indecisive. However I really wish I knew/remembered a bit more HTML so I could really modify the why this page looks, mostly I just want to change the space these main posts are put in to a bit bigger, there is so much more room on the page that they could use! oh well ill figure it out, or ask my sister to help me (ok I admit it! she knows more HTML than I do!   but I know more about computers overall... eyah...  ).  I'm really not excited about work this week, my schedule is kinda messed up, usually I go into work about 5, or 6, but tomorrow I go in at 10:30 in the morning, what is that? Like a normal time, cheah... μακάρι (better, or I wish) it could be today, then perhaps I could go catch part of institute... Also on friday I go in at 4, seriously who orders pizza @ 4 pm? k so I would but fish, (I use the conjoining word "fish" here because I just noticed I ues "yeah" way too much) not every day. I shouldt complain, and I'm not really, I just think its odd, and I'm confused, cause I've never gone in at 10:30 before, I guess cause I'm leaving they are giving me whatever slot is left to put me in. But only 8 more days of that fun so yes.  I like fanta orange.  I wonder if they ever tried to, or dose it exist, a dark chocolate icecream, or would that just be nasty. Dunno. Perhaps in mainland europe somewhere, they like a lot of coco in there chocolate there. In fact they tried to tell the english company Cadberries that they couldn't call there chocolate chocolate anymore because it didn't have enough coco... of course they told them to stick it in there ear, england "discovered" (or ripped off the idea from the indans, but made it what it is today) chocolate, and this is how they have always done it.  Well, I should e-mail some people now, but, really I cant be bothered. The sad thing is when its day I'm all like hey, ill e-mail tonight, and when it night I'm all like hey, ill e-mail tomorrow during the day, but neither ever gets done. ah well. ya'll be good now.

      K that sucked, I forgot to spell check the last post... Man! Ah well, it could be worse. Could be in Spanish, then I wouldn't even understand it. But hey! My dad found some glass beads that make great symbolic*, but there glass, and I'm scared I'm going to break them. But they are the perfect weight and size... Maybe I shouldn't play so rough...  *greek worry beads, (the kind I use) string with beads on the end.

      K' so I'm making a new post on my journal, you lucky people you! Actualy I'm doing this for Hollys benifit, because she didn't think I had a journal, and I did think any one would ever read what I would write. oh and i just invented a new word for my vocabulary... eyah, cause I keep misspelling it... basicaly its a "more of a mischeavious form of yeah" pronounced like yeah, but with a έ sound on the front of it. Ok so now after talking to Holly I beleave it that posting here may be more fun than I originaly thought. SO... yes... I was thinking of puting down some guidelines for the reader of this journal, to help guid them thought the randomness of how I will most likley write, but after a second thought it lost the desire to make such a list, and it didnt seem like it would have too much of rules on it, and they wouldnt really be rules for se' but more like "Im gonna wright like this, so tough!" and that could go without saying. So if you know how I am how I wright won't be a suprise.  Also if you start to read this blog latter that this post you wouldnt have read the things I would list, so maby I should put somthing like that in the "about me" page. ah... whateve... I really like elips marks, really I should probably just start a new paragraph every time I use them but έ τι να κάννω; (ok, first time translation... that means "what am I to do?") K so I never got that why is almost all the punctuation in greek the same as english, except the question mark? In greek they use the semi-colen to denote a intarogitive sentence...* Also I really dont get/like how I is capitalized when typing, takes too much effort, and I think it seemes kinda pompus. i guess it wouldnt look right otherwise... oh well. K' so my left sholder keeps hurting, for a little back information it has been doing this off and on for over a year now and its getting really anoying, I think it must be a nerve er somthing. at least its not as bad as when it happened, that was painfull. Ahh now I'm complaining, and sounding untough... um... yeah so yeah so im gonna go out and play soccer now till i bleed or break somthing, caus im so tough!!!! K so that covers the sounding untough... AAAAHHHH!!! i cant type any better than i can spell... though the spelling is not my fault, my dad cant spell, his dad cant spell, and i dont beleave his dad could eather, and we all spell the same... the funny thing is when my dad misspells somthing i cant tell.  **NOTE* after writing this paragraph i decided it lacked actualy content, thuss you may want to skip it and read other parts of this post/journal however it was left in here to make this post seem longer, thank you!** Well it seemes like its time to start a new paragarph... the old one was about me and the journal, this one is about ideas i had today. I had a excelent idea of a mod for a computer... though i dont want to say here so someone will steal my idea, though if you ask me in person ide probably tell you... Also i had a idea of how to make a ton of money, selling somthing that was already invented, though i dont want to give that away eather.... hummmm... i wonder if it has a pattent in the USofA? well this paragraph is excithing!!!! ya'll dont have a clue what im talking about do you... man! k sorry about that.  Well Im runnin out of stuff to rambel about... and the soccer idea is sounding grood right now... so... im gonna go get some icecream... er... somthing... to admit it i dont know how to end a post...wow... its like a letter but worse... well thats all for now... though i feel like im forgitting somthing, ah well, more fo' laters!   *isn't it cleaver how im working in all the "this is how to understand me" things, and giving you a greek lesson to boot!
