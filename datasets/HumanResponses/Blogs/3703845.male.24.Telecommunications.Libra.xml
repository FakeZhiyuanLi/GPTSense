      When are the start and stop dates for D-Teams this 2004-2005 time span.  I know we talked about ending D-Teams at the beginnning of June, are we planning on starting D-Teams middle of September or beginning of October? This can then give us a time frame for the number of weeks that we have vs. the content that needs to be taught.  Thanks, - Kevin

      I think a great way to start this, is by telling what our dreams for D-Teams are.  I'd like to see 75 kids involved in D-Teams this year.  I'd love to have 2 leaders for every 5 students, and every student cared for and growing in faith.  I'd like to see 26 D-Team leaders who have a passion to see our students grow.  I'd like to see committed students who take D-Team's seriously, but have lots of fun.  I'd love to see us as the model for 'Big Church' when it comes to small groups.  Rob

      I think my direction for the D-Teams would be, again, going through A) reasons to believe that there is a God, and followed up by B) what kind of God does the Bible declare there to be.  What directions do you guys think we should take? - Kevin

      Hi Rob/Dean,  Here is the starting of what I'm sure will be a lemgthy collection of blogs about Youth small groups at Bramalea Baptists Church (otherwise known as "D-Teams")  We need to set cirriculim based on 2 major opinions: 1) Knowledge that we want to pass on to the students to help them in their faith and help starting really good discussions with other students and friends (Christian or not) 2) Listen to the students, their questions, struggles and successes.  Two of our favorite books are C.S. Lewis, "Mere Christianity", and Brian D McLaren's "New Kind of Christian" both of these focus on who God is, and what/how we can relationship to God.  We have traditionally started with the "Why believe in a God?" followed up with if you believe in God, what kind of God do you believe in? (attributes of the Biblical God)  Is this the direction that you are looking to pursue this year? - Kevin

      In the interest of getting us all on the same page for D-Teams for the fall – I would like to meet next Tuesday July 13th at 8pm at our place to share some vision and strategy for next year as well as some practical changes we need to make regarding D-Teams.  Here’s an agenda that Rob and I would like try and cover next week:  1. Purpose of D-Team -  Overview D-Team as a connection ministry on the 1st to 2nd side of the baseball diagram and how that relates to Quarry and Habits. -  This is not a 'Bible Study'   2. Structure of D-Teams -  Number of Students per group -  Code of conduct for students -  How many times per month -  Kick off event -  When do we start? -  Meetings throughout the year time, dates etc. -  Communication - email, blog etc.     3. Accountability -  How do we do this? (3-questions, partners etc.) -  What about SLT, what is their standard? -  How do our students hold us accountable? -  What do we hold each other accountable for?   4. Growth -  'The empty chair' -  Structure of birthing new groups - how does that look? -  What about grade 9's?  How do we get them involved?  (I had 3 grade 9 guy's talk to me about D-Teams for them on Sunday night)  5. Leadership -  How do we do training? -  What about accountability among the D-Team leaders via Dean? -  How do we deal with behavior issues? -  Guy's/Girls overall leader. -  Feedback etc. -  SLT -  New leaders?  6. How we fit in overall -  D-Team leaders in their own growth groups -  Training our students to replace themselves, and replace us -  Always giving the big picture -  Can we use Big Church as a resource?
