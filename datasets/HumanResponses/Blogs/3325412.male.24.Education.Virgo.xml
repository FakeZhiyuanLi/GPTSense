      Just a quick update.  I'm now training, the school is stuffing me full of well trodden advice and fun games.  It's good to have it, but we have to write a full lesson plan as a final assignment followed by an exam.  That's a bitch.    The upside is the hotel I'm staying at, more commonly known as the Love Hotel.  My room has wall to wall mirrors, decor a 70's porn set designer would be proud of, rooms you can rent by the hour and free Asian/American porn on the T.V.  The funniest bit though has to be the noises.  Asian girls have a tendency to scream loudly during sex, like you would if being poked with a pointy stick while having a temper tantrum.  It's a nuisance when you're trying to sleep.  The pollution in Taipei is quite bad, some scooter drivers use face masks.  But in the humidity the smog tends to linger around.  But of course if you can't beat them, join them.  So my next purchase of any importance will be my very own 2nd hand scooter.  Cool!  I can't wait to bomb round town on it, scaring the locals with my big horn.  ;o)  Martin

      Wow, bloody hell.  Taiwan rocks!  The other teachers are a great laugh.  All have been here for a while and enjoy going out and drinking the beers.  Luckily I'm staying with a friend in the mountains at the moment, so I'll be looking for a place to share real soon.  Beer is cheap and a good evening can last until 5:00am.  I've been in the country for 5 days and I'm loving the place.  The humidity is the most striking thing about the place  It's about 33 C with 70% humidity.  You walk you sweat, you sit down you sweat some more, you go indoors you shiver because the aircon is on.  It's a bit like walking around in a sauna some days.  Most the time it's fine, shorts, sandals and a T-Shirt works well.  Another thing is the vast amount of signs written in Chinese in neon colours.  Every street looks the same.  The first time me and Greg (other newbie) walked to the school from Pascal's house (fellow teacher of 3 years) we spent 2 hours looking for it.  Eventually we gave up went to a bank and they rang the school who picked us up.    The food is awesome.  You kinda point at meat on the stand and the type of noodle you want and they put it in a big soupy cauldron and it's normally served in a bowl with chopsticks and a spoon.  Costs about 40-100 NT dollars (60p - 1.66 pounds)  N.B. No symbols here!  Anyway I start training tomorrow morning so need a few hours kip ;)  Martin  P.S. Pete good luck with the interview. (and don't abuse my blog!)

      Martin, just a word to say that i have the magic ability to log into your user page, and I am considering changing a few answers in your profile to something more interesting!!!  Hope Taipei is good, and that the lady boys delight you.  Pete

      I'm about to leave for Taiwan, 6 days to go, very excited and can't wait to start my mini adventure.  Teaching alone will be a huge challenge, having never done it before I'm still uncertain as to whether I'll be any good.  Time will tell.  Aside from that little issue I'm well up for the craic, getting the chance to experience something unique for a year (or more).   Admittedly leaving the comforts and familiarity of home will be tricky.  I love this blogging idea!  ;o)  Also have a look at my personal website (mostly for the pictures):   urlLink www.mcoyle.co.uk

      Everything is going swimmingly.  Have had a couple of good weekends, including a night in a hotel in Taichung after partying until 6:00am.  Also went to Lugang to see the national Dragon Boat Race, a festival that celebrates a bloke who jumped into a river and drowned to make a point about some bad guys who wanted to kill him.  That's the gist of it, but there might be more to it?  Teaching is getting easier and slowly I'm getting to know the kids and having some fun with them.    I'm now waiting for my ARC so I can buy a scooter, already bought a mobile phone.  It's my second one ever, the first being a Nokia brick.  This one has flashing lights and wallpaper.  Crazy days.  Please email me, what's going on out there? Over and out,  MC

      My first day at Yuan Lin school was yesterday, after spending last week covering in Changhua school.  I went into my second lesson, teaching "some", "an" and "a" etc... The teaching assistant turned to me and said, "Teacher, you're doing the wrong Unit in the book!"  Shit.  My lesson plan took ages and I had no games for the other language.  So I fucked that up a bit.  Quite funny for the other teachers.  I now have a place to live, the 2nd floor in a house rented by an ex-shane teacher.  It's a large room and bathroom on the same floor.  Kitchen (which smells of cat piss) and lounge area too.  Plus a roof top over looking the canal and rice field, with a hammock.  Costing about 65 pounds a month, which is very useful as I have no money!  Yuan Lin is growing on me and I've been travelling all over the place at weekends with the other teachers.  Taichung, Changhua, Taipei and new places around Yuan Lin.  Soon I hope to start some hiking up the mountains and maybe do some kung foo.  The teaching has been quite hectic, the learning curve is steep but I'm getting better at planning my lessons now.    It's about 33 degrees here, I'm always looking for a cool place to sit and rest!  The aircon is my saving grace.
