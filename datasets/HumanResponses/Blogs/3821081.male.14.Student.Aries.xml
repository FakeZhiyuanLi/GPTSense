      today. woke up and wasnt up for more than an hour when derek calls and says "I'm gonna come over." so i take a shower and pack for santa barbara. derek comes over and we sit around and play old nintendo games and eat hot pockets.&nbsp;derek killed felix and november. i was sad. but i caught two more. their names are rex and bubba.&nbsp;i figure if they wanna make it in the big world of insects they need to have some tough names. then their mom was on my wall.&nbsp;and i killed her. mwahahah. i'm mean. anyway then my dad gets home and we go to mainland and big 5. got some new flip flops and a skim board. and ya.&nbsp;  so leaving for santa barbara&nbsp;tomorrow morning. lookin pretty sweet. and ya. well cant really think of anything else to say.   &nbsp;    &nbsp;
