      Today, I feel empty. I don't know why, nothing is wrong with me. I just don't have anything that makes me happy, mad, sad, or anything else going on. It is just another Monday at work.   Nothing really going on at work either.....but work.   Such is life.......

      Every single Friday I say to myself "Today, I am leaving work early."  I wonder why I never do?  Bible study tonight and I am hopelessly un-prepared. I hope the "helper" gives me some ideas.

      I am a Christian. I am proud to be a Christian, and I try to be a good Christian. The other day I was reading a blog that spoke of a person's mother who rejected Christianity because "Christians are "bigots" because we believe that ours is the only way and so we exclude other good and "holy" people and, in fact, condemn them all to hell."  I was highly impressed with the daughter's response, which I won't go into here, but it did get me to thinking.   Chistians can't "condemn" somone to hell, only God can do that.  Chistians don't determine what gets you to heaven and what does not. Jesus did that when he said "I am the way, the truth, and the life, nobody comes to the Father except through Me."  Bigotry is defined as "an attitude of intolerance." Is it intolerant to believe what God has told us through the Bible?   Those who reject someone for their beliefs should look into a mirror. Maybe the bigot will be staring back at them.

      I am normally a very upbeat, happy, and energetic person. However, like most other people, I get to feeling tired, run down, and a little "down-in-the-dumps" every now-and-then. This was the case yesterday. Nothing major, just the wear-and-tear from a hectic, pressure-packed lifestyle.  After dinner last night, feeling down and discouraged, I logged on to ITunes and started looking for old songs from my childhood. As I listened to the samples of the songs online, and downloaded others, tremendous memories began to come to me. The next thing I new, I was smiling, laughing, and having a great time going back in time in my mind to the 70's.......yes, the 70's!  Remembering my old school buddies, most of which I haven't seen in years. Remembering the classes that I had and the struggles and triumphs of math. Remembering my parents, especially my Dad (since he is no longer around), and him working his butt off so that we could have a boat for water skiing. Memories of my first girlfriend and how much I loved that girl; and how she ripped my heart out and stomped on it. Remembering another girlfriend, how pretty she was and how much I cared for her. Remembering that I broke up with her in a very cowardly way, just because my "friends" said we were getting too "serious". It broke her heart and I still feel guilty about that. Remembering playing football in junior high and high school, being in band in Jr. High, my first day of junior high and my first day of high school, my graduation day,  on and on........I could go on for hours.  I have a great life now, but I miss those times so much. Maybe I am looking back at the "good 'ole days" through rose colored glasses, but I really don't care if I am. That was a great time in my life.  I woke up this morning feeling refreshed, up-beat, and ready to take on the world; even though I stayed up WAY too late listening to the music that carried me back 25 or 30 years. So, who needs expensive counseling and/or drugs, I have Itunes to keep me sane.

      The weather in these parts has been incredible for several weeks now. We have seen sunshine, clouds, rain, and (most importantly)some cool breezes. The breeze last night felt like a cool breeze coming in off of the ocean. INCREDIBLE!  Why is this incredible? I live in Texas. In Texas between June 1st and September 30th, there is usually very little of anything but sunshine. "Wait" you say, "what is wrong with that?" Allow me to explain.   You see, Texas in the summer there is sunshine all the time, along with 104 degree temprature and 70% humidity. Miserable. So to get a little rain, some cloudy days, and some cooler weather (mid 80s) in June is a real treat. I know, I know; in a few weeks it will be dreadfully hot. Those of you who have lived in Texas know what I am talking about.  I am going to enjoy it while it lasts, it will be gone before I know it!

      I is my belief that this country is deeply divided. Divided amoung many lines, but I am mostly talking about political lines. Republican, Democrat, liberal, conservative, pro-life, anti-abortion, people who love Bush, people who hate him. Everywhere you look we are divided. Why? I have an opinion.  Our divisions, in my opinion, are due to the following:  - Economic position - Race - Age - Education - Geographic Region of the country - A culture of "Freedom of Expression"  These are just the ones that I see. I realize that they are generalizations, but they are the result of my simplistic views.  I am not sure if these divisions are good for our country or bad. I know I don't like it. While I think that it is good that we can disagree, the level of disagreement and "dislike" for "the other side" is disturbing. My opinion is that we can achieve more as a society by working together than working against each other. (Sigh.......) I guess it is a pipe-dream to think anything will change.  Which brings me to my final point. The election year. Nothing on the face of this great planet that we live on bores me and enrages me more than a Presidential Election. It is where all of the divisions in our country manifest themselves. I am so tired of hearing how my beliefs (that I hold very dear) are going to destroy the country that I love, and the rest of the world with it. The inverse is also true.  As campaign season approaches, I am checking out. No news, no campaign ads, nothing. I know who I am going to vote for. Nothing, short of a major disaster is going to change that. So, to the candidates, save your time,your money, your breath, and my sanity. I am not listening to you.....either of you, whether I agree with you or not.   And the "so-called" experts wonder why the percentage of people who vote is so low.

      I am usually not a "day dreamer." Not that there is anything wrong with it, but I just don't seem to find the time (a sad commentary on my life). However, while driving in to work today, I decided to indulge myself in a small "mind-movie" and provide a little self induced escapism for myself.  The title of this little "mind-melodrama?"   What would Steve1960 do if he won the lottery.   I know, I know. Who hasn't played this documentary in their head, but the lottery in this state is at a record high level ($145,000,000), so indulge me.   What I discovered during this day dream is surprising to me. Other than the obvious things (quit job, pay bill, etc.) I really don't know what I would do with all that money. Would I give some away? Would I hoard it (like so many millionaires do)? Would I blow it on useless junk that I would never use? Would I become a philanthropist? Would I be happy? Would I be miserable? Would it change who I am?  While it sounds weird, I really don't know the answers to these questions. If I am honest with myself, and I am really trying to be honest, it is so far-fetched to think about being that rich that it is beyond my capability to really imagine it.  I think it would be the best thing that ever happened to me. I think that I could have anything I ever dreamed about, and I think that would make me happy. I think I would be generous. I think I wouldn't turn into an eccentric egomaniacal jackass. But this is just what I think would happen to me. Since I don't know a single lottery winner, or a single millionaire, how would I know if what I "think" is really what would happen.   So many times we hear that money can't make you happy, that lottery winners lives were "ruined" by the money, that the richer you are the more problems you have.   How would it affect me?   I would love to find out ;-)

      As you saw in one of my previous "vents," I pretty much went off on Jerks this week. It was mostly as a result of the incident at the Texas Ranger ballgame on Sunday where a 30ish year old man "stole" a foul ball from a 4 year old boy. Here is what I saw on TV:  The foul ball landed in the row with the 4 year old and his mother. The older man was in the row above and dove over the row, kicked the 4 year old out of the way (although not nearly hard enough to hurt him, just enough to confuse him) and rooted around under the mother's seat until he came up with the ball. The mother swatted at him with a program while he was getting up, and obviously had some words with him. He stood up and defiantly displayed the ball for everyone in the stadium, and on TV to see. Of couse, he was booed so heavily that he and his date (wife, girlfriend, ..... whatever) left by the 4th inning.   That is what I saw, and it really ticked me off.....  This has made national news, as the boy and his mother have been on Good Morning America, etc. They have also recieved signed Nolan Ryan baseballs, bats, a free trip to New York, and tickets to the Mets game.  All the while, there has been no word from the idiot who took the ball........  Until today.  The guy who took the ball has apparently come to his senses and is offering an apology and a packet of tickets to future Texas Ranger's games for the family and their child......or has he? Has he really realized the error of his ways? Or is he tired of the blistering criticism he is getting from all over the country? Or did someone tell him, tell everyone you are a huge baseball fan and you just momentarily lost it. Then apologize and everyone will forgive you.  Hmmmm. I wonder which it could be?  Regarless, I am happy today. The bad guy has been taught a valuable lesson, and the good guys win one....finally! Most importantly, I am overjoyed to see that people still react with outrage when something like this happens. I will worry when it becomes too commonplace.

      Well, the House-Hunt and the House-Sell are going very slowly. The process of selling and buying houses is an interesting one. You have to give complete control over the to Real Estate Agents and trust that they are doing what is in your best interest. You have better trust them, because they can really screw you over if you are not careful!  Fortunately, we have a very trustworthy agent, working hard for us. But it is so stressful. But it is worth it in the long run if you get a "home" rather than a house.

      I heard someone say that the great thing about America is that "we have a drive to be the best at whatever we participate in." I suppose this applies to Jerks as well.   From the people who cut you off while driving, to the people who flip you off for only driving 30 MPH above the speed limit, to the idiot at the major league baseball game who stole the foul ball from a 4 year old boy, to the spineless, brown-nosing, boss who targeted his employee for termination before he even realized what his job was; just because his boss wanted it to happen.   Congratulations! You are the best of the best.   I salute your most notable and impressive attribute.

      What can I say about Monday's around here. No need to re-hash it. It is all been said before in poetry and song (and now Blog's).  My "Monday" mind is not giving me much to write about today. So, here goes.  Last week was the Ronald Reagan memorial. If you are reading this, you are probably too young to even remember Ronald Reagan. Most people who are old enough to remember Reagan don't even know what a Blog is, much less read them. So today, I am going to enlighten you :-)   - How did I feel about Ronald Reagan   He was the first president I voted for (in 1980). Politics aside, when Ronald Reagan came into office, this country was a mess. Joblessness, high interest rates, military weakness, The United States was viewed as a second-rate country (economically and militarily), the Iran hostage situation, on and on and on and on. Ronald Reagan's leadership, at least, started correcting these problems. How did I feel about Ronald Reagan........he was greatness.   - The Media Coverage of his Death   Like so many things in the media, it was "blown out of proportion." Too much, too long, and too patronizing. To hear the media, Rondal Reagan did no wrong, was never short, mean, or condescending. While I didn't know the man, I am sure that is not true. It is not true of anyone!    - The Country's Reaction to his Death   Puzzling.....  I know of no president who was so loved (by the conservatives) and so hated (by the liberals) while he was in office. Very few (if any) of his most harsh critics have spoken up. Interesting, maybe I underestimated them.

      As noted in my preivous post, a good friend has moved on to another city and another job. It appears that we were just part of the "Dallas" chapter of his life. He has closed that chapter and moved on. Maybe we thought we impacted his life more than we did. Hopefully he is just excited about his move; and we saw the release of the pent up frustration and anger concerning what happened to him at his previous job.  I hope we will stay in touch. I fear that we won't.  However, life goes on. There are new friendships to be forged and nutured. We went to Church tonight (we go almost every Saturday night). There, I recieved the revitalizing words concerning  Facing Discouragement  and  The Trouble with Pride.  Both of these messages were refreshing and relaxing to me. Church gets me centered and back on track. I highly recommend it!  Most importantly, we have begun to bond with new friends. Those friends that will replace the time and emotional investment we had been putting into our young friend who is now heading East. It is very refreshing to interact with people who (1) are of similar age, not that I don't completely enjoy hanging our with twenty-somethings; and (2) and are of like spiritual mind. It is comforting and reassuring knowing you are not alone out there.  As I read the blog after blog about people who "don't want God," and "are sick of the emails from Christians trying to conver them," I feel sad for these people. Sad that they will never have friends like mine, sad that they will never feel the comfort and reassurance of a strong relationship with Jesus, sad that, to them, there is nothing beyond this existence.  I would scare me to death to think that  this is all there is.  How frightening.

      While laying in bed this morning, before getting ready for work, my mind started to wonder. "What is beauty" my mind thought. I began to ponder.  Here is the conclusion I came to.  I find beauty in minimalist simplicity. The more we try to "trick things up" the uglier they get to me.  Beautiful women, to me, are simply beautiful. Heavy makeup, overly done hair, plastic surgery, and fake boobs aren't beautiful to me. Simple things about women are beautiful to me. How their hair falls on their shoulders. Their hair style. Their bodies. Their smile. Their voice. Simple things.  Simple furniture is beautiful to me. The very ornate, overly fancy, formal furniture, is ugly to me. I prefer simple, high quality furniture. I am particularly fond of amish furniture. Simple, but very very beautiful.  The point is, simplicity can be beautiful too. However, we seem to have forgotten this.   Simply put, the simple things in life can be, and usually are, beautiful. If you stop and look at them.

      Why are you so anxious to leave? Have we become like your "real" family? Are we the wierd aunt and uncle that you are ashamed to be around? Do you just want to be as far away  from us as you can get? Or, are you just so excited to have a new job that you have overlooked the grief you friends are going through as you leave. Are you so excited to leave this aspect of your life behind, that you have forgotten that there are people here who care about you?  We know that your leaving is for the best for you. We know that your career is the primary focus of your life right now. We want to best for you. However, it is not easy to see you go. Especially since we think we will drift apart.  We are grieving for our friendship. We wish you were too.  Good luck. Remember us. We will remember you.

      Buying and selling a house is a highly "legalistic" adventure. Everything, and I mean  EVERYTHING  must be in writing. It is amazing the detail you have to go through to keep yourself from getting sued, or having to file suit against someone else.  Like selling a car, it requires negotiations, and understanding the signals that are being sent. You must also be very careful about the signals you send, else your buyer will just walk away, leaving you holding the bag (and the house).  The process is very iteresting.  However, the clock is ticking. The "option period" to back out of the contract expires tonight at midnight and if the buyers back out after that, we keep their earnest money. Now we are down to the final "repairs" negotiations. $500 here, $1000 there, and before you know it, it is an expensive proposition to sell your house. Over $5000 in repairs, and I pride myself on taking care of my property!   The under-foundation leak cost $1800, the replacing of both furnaces $2500, the replacing of thermal windows with broken seals (19 of them) $1400, replacing the wrong breaker for the air conditioner, replacing the carpet in the 1/2 bath, replacing the cracked toilet in the 1/2 bath. See what I mean?   Finally, we have agreed on repairs for our house. So, as of tonight at midnight, the option period is over, and we can start packing. Now we move on to the repairs of our new house. While these repairs are relatively minor (its a nearly new house), we are broke, tapped out, down to the last dollar. And the seller of our new house is too. What are we going to do now?   Well, we have until Tuesday to find out! Stay tuned. The saga continues.

      Since there is no news on the house-front today, I am going to switch gears.  I am intensely curious about people. That is one reason I read blog's. People put their lives on display. I have always been curious about people and how they live.  When I go to someone's house, I don't look at the house, how clean it is, or anything like that. I look at how the people live. If we swapped places, would I recognize how they lived. Would they recognize how I live? Or are we so different that our lives would be unrecognizable.  One thing I have learned, most people wear "social masks." They want you to think their lives are perfect in every way; and if you just take them for what they appear to be, you would be dead wrong. Most people, in my experience, do not live anything like what they want you to believe. They are ashamed of what they really are.  Interesting....many people are ashamed of who they really are, so they wear "social masks" to make everyone believe they are perfect.  I believe that "social masks" are the most dangerous and damaging aspect of our society. It makes all of us who wear them liars. We lie about who we are. We lie about what we are about. We lie to make ourselves feel better. We lie to make others feel better about us.   Funny thing though. These lies just make people dislike, distrust, and think worse about us.  Stop deceiving yourself. Take off your mask and look in the mirror. If you don't like what you see, then change it.

      Well, if the sell of this house doesn't send us to the poor-house, nothing will. $3000 to fix the plumbing, $1500 to fix the windows, and now we have to replace two furnaces (two story house). Oh yes, I said replace, as they can't be fixed.   The plumbers are at the house right now, digging through our foundation to fix a broken drain pipe. I thought it couldn't get any worse than that. Now I hear about the furnaces. Jeez.....  We should just tear the house down and give our buyers a brand new one.  sigh......there goes my vacation money.

      If you have read some of my other posts, you know by now that we are selling our house. At least I think we are. We have a buyer, we have another house that we want to buy, and we have loads of problems with our current house. All of a sudden, we have plumbing problems. We have been in this house for 8 years, never a plumbing problem. Now that we are on the verge of moving out, we have a potentially major problem with our sewer pipes under the foundation.  To date, our buyers remain undeterred. But they don't know about the potential problems. Will they buy our house if we have to jack-hammer a hole in our bedroom and fix a pipe? I don't know.   On the other hand, we have found a very good deal on a new house. A motivated seller, apparently due to a divorce. Very sad that a family has disintegrated. I almost feel guitly about buying the house at the price they are selling. But hey, I am not holding a gun to their heads.  Stay tuned. I will keep you informed of our progress and will detail the hell that is moving.....hopefully.

      While listening to the radio this morning, one of the hosts of the show I was listening to talked about his 12 year old son nearly being killed by an incompetent and/or drunk boat driver while water skiing.  It seems the boat driver was (1) not paying any attention to what he was doing, (2) not capable of handling a boat, (3 and most likely) drunk. Despite the yelling, waving, screaming, etc. the boat driver missed the boy by only about two feet.   Obviously, the father was very upset. He said it was a life-changing event  This brings back the memories to my teenage years. It was a hot and sunny summer day in early May 1979 (yes '79) and were at a Student Council outing at the lake; really a great treat for us! The outing was over early in the afternoon and my cousin and I decided to get the sailboat and go sailing.  So, we headed home, got the boat, picked up my other cousin, and headed back to the lake. This all took about 2.5 hours. So, we were back on the lake by 4:30 or 5:00.   We sailed lazily around the lake for several hours. At about 7:00pm the wind died and we decided it was time to head home. As we were heading for the boat dock, we spotted a boat headed our way. At this time it was about a mile away. I said (sarcastically) that I hoped he could see us from that far away. Whether he could or not, he kept coming at us.  When the boat was about 400 yards, we got alarmed and began waving so that he could turn away from us. When the boat was 200 yards from us, we began yelling and waving. The boat still came directly at us, showing no evidence that it was going to veer out of the way. Did he not see us? Was he trying to scare us? Did he have a problem with sail boats? Was he drunk? Did he just want to kill us? At this point, I was unsure of what was going on.  When the boat was 50 yards away, feeling that "at any second he is going to swerve out of the way" left me. When the boat was 50 feet away, I jumped and swam as hard as I could away from the sailboat. For some reason, I jumped toward the oncoming boat. My two cousins jumped at the same time.  The boat missed me by less than a foot. I felt the suction of the boat's wake trying to suck me under the boat, but it wasn't strong enough to pull me under it.  Seconds later......BOOM.........  The boat hit our sailboat at 20 to 25 MPH. Fast enough that the other boat came completly out of the water; like running over a ramp. Our sailboat was severed in half and was sinking. We were hundreds of yards from shore, and helpless.  Thankfully to God, none of us were hurt. However, the driver of the boat made one circle around us and took off; never to be seen again.  Fortunately for us, there were other people on the lake who saw what had happened and came to our rescue, or we would have swam for shore.  Do you think this changed my life? I can tell you without reservation......yes. I learned how quickly your life can be snuffed out. I learned that sometimes you can't control when or how it happens. I learned that when something like this happens, your life doesn't flash before your eyes, but everything slows down to super-slow-motion. I learned that in a situation like this, I wouldn't panic or even be scared. I just thought to myself "so this is how I am going to die." It was a simple as that.  I also leaned about cowardice. What kind of coward runs over three kids in a sail boat and leaves them to drown in the middle of a lake? What a sorry excuse for a "man." While I harbor no anger at this man, I would love to tell him face-to-face what a low-life, selfish, immoral, coward he is.  I also learned that everyone should be thankful just to be alive. It can be over in an instant.  Believe it or not, this did have a positive influence on my life. It made me appreciate that I am alive. It made me appreciate what I have. It made me appreciate my friends and family more that I ever did before it happened. It also gave me a great deal of appreciation for those who do brave things when they don't have to. Soldiers, for instance, have a special place in my heart.  Enjoy life, live it to the fullest. You never know what tomorrow holds......or doesn't.

      Trying to sell a house is a stressful activity. First, you have to clean (and I mean REALLY CLEAN) your house and keep it spotless. Then you have to "de-clutter" and "de-personalize", which means you have to take all of  your  stuff and put it into storage.Then, you open your house for complete strangers to walk through, without you there to monitor them. And if they buy your house, YOU PAY THE FEES! Doesn't this sound backwards?

      Ah....Just what the doctor ordered......  A long holiday rest.   It really is amazing how tired, stressed out, and cranky we get without even realizing it. Being the "Type A" work-a-holic that I am, it is hard for me to unwind. However, after taking a "mandatory" 3 week vacation (aka honeymoon), I found out that I was really tired and stressed out. The time off gave me a perspective that I never before had. People who take long vacations are not lazy.... THEY ARE TIRED!!!   Taking vacation on Friday, having the weekend, and then a holiday on Monday gave me the opportunity to rest, sleep, catch up on errands, and many other things that have just been waiting. It was nice, really nice, to have the time off. Especially since I haven't had a vacation in a couple of years, which breaks my own rule. The rule being "take at least two continuous weeks off of work" for vacation and/or rest every year.  This year, the rule won't be broken  One of the things we did during the holiday was see "The Terminal." Although Steven Spielberg is a great director and Tom Hanks is a great actor, I had reservations about how a movie about a guy stuck in an airport terminal could make an interesting movie. Well, I shouldn't have doubted Spielberg and Hanks. They pulled it off. I thought the Terminal was one of the best movies I have seen in a long time. Very funny. Sometimes slow, but that is ok by me. All-in-all, well worth the money and time spent. I highly recommend it.

      Countdown to move = 6 days.  Well, packing for the move is in high gear. The move is imminent. Someone asked me the other day "aren't you a little sad to be leaving the house you have lived in for all of this time?"  My answer: No  I don't get sentimental over these kinds of things. Niether does my wife. You see, this house is not a home. It is a structure in which my wife and I have lived (happily) for the past 8 years, but it is not a home. Home is where I live, not matter where I live. Actually, I am happy to be leaving the house we are in today. It has been a pain to maintain since the day we moved in. The only thing I will miss in this move is our neighbors. Although we are not very close to any of them, they are all friendly and helpful. Who knows what our new neighbors will be like?  Oh yes, there are memories, but that is all they are, and they will not leave when we leave this house. Now it is time to move on to another "home." Another place to make memories.  I don't know if you are going to hear from me again until after the move. Until then, Unterhaltmesswert und -Gott segnen.

      The drama, stress, and absolute nuttiness involved in selling and buying a house is coming to an end. Here is where we stand:    We have sold our house  We have repaired the "under-foundation" leak  We have repaired the "mysteriously" cracked toilet  We have replaced the perfectly good carpet  We have replaced both furnaces  We have replaced the linoleum  We have given an allowance for the thermal windows  We have bought a new house (pre-owned, but like new)  We have replaced the AC Overflow pans  We are investigating the shower pan leak   We are now starting to pack, scheduling movers, changing utilities, etc. etc. etc.  Moving is a pain. I can't wait for it to be over. But there is an additional complication.....as if we need any more.....we have sold most of our furniture. So even when we move in to the new digs, we won't have:   A table to eat on  A couch to sit on  Book shelves to put our (copiuous amount of)  books on  Bedroom furniture to put our clothes in  Possibly not a matress to sleep on!  No refridgerator to put our food in   These kinds of disruptions make me crazy. I am one of those  everything has its place so put it there  kind of people. Not having the things that make a house a home is really stressful for me.   I will be happy when it is all over and everything returns to normal.

      VPN has to rank up there along with Tivo, Computers, CD's, Sliced Bread, the Wheel, and Fire, as one of the greatest inventions known to mankind. You see, VPN allows me to work from home with broadband access to our corporate networks.  ............. Magic....................  I am, in fact, working from home today. Every bit as productive as I am at the office, except for the personal interaction. My car is in the shop for the day and in this part of the world, if you don't have a car, you stay at home.  So, through the magic of VPN, you get to read about the magic of VPN; and I get to read your blogs......

      In Texas, summer is still beating us down with all of its fury. The heat and humidity get worse and worse as I get older and older. However, NFL training camps are opening up. One of my favorite times of year.  Yes....I am a rabid football fan......so sue me!   However, training camps signal that my favorite time of year is just around the corner. Fall, I can't wait for fall. Nobody understands why I like it so much, and I don't expect them to. In short, it is like old music, or smells, or looking at an old High School Yearbook. It just brings back the memories of my youth that are so special to me. These years made me who I am.  I wish one of you would invent a time machine so that I could go back......
