      Why is it when something negative comes my way I run and hide? I push away all the people that I truly care about  and I  crawl in to a dark closet with in my mind and slowly shut down. I still to this day don't know how to take rejection when all my life its all I had you would think id be used to it by now, I was never good enough for my mother all the guys I dated treated me like shit  what did I do to deserve this? All I ever wanted was to be loved unconditionally, now I see my self unable to give the love that is needed to my beautiful daughters, why cant my daughters love be good enough for me? Why do I need the love and approval of a man to  fulfill me ?? I just don't understand  where I went wrong in my life!

        I started talkin to this awesome guy I had met on  plentyofish.com about  two weeks ago we would talk every night for at least 5 hours a night.  He seemed to be everything I wanted in a man and he had made  me believe that I was everything he wanted in a woman, we had shared pictures a lot of pictures so he new what I looked like and I new what he looked like, well this guy was just to good to be true just a wonderful man he would tell me he loved me and how he wanted a future with me. He decided that he had to come see me so after two weeks of talkin and getting to know eachother through conversation  he shows up on my door step at around 1 am on Saturday morning. I aswered the door and he was just as beautiful as his pictures but I could tell I wasn't everything he imagined id be. I still had a day and a half with this guy and I new he didn't like me the way he said he did because of the way I looked can you imagine the heartache of rejection when its slapped in your face?Well he ended up staying the whole time and we had a nice time, we took my girls to see a movie and he came to my mothers house for dinner and what not! We did sleep together but I feel like he did it out of pity for me. It just hurts to be rejected by someone who tells you they love you and how beautiful you are,I told him how scared I was to meet him cause I didn't want to disappoint him but he said "what do you think I'm a shallow person? I think your beautiful and I want to be with you". So now here I am 2 days later not one phone call from him and a broken heart to deal with!
