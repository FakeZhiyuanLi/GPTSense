      I do not know why i tolerate FF... but what he did yesterday really irritates me... but i just shrugged it off... the hell!  The Cumlasoc... ever prestigious and DARNED NASTY, has told the world that i got a crush on aaron... a bisexual nymphomaniac and ever trustworthy bitch blockhead of our class! The thing is, i don't have anything on that guy/gay... and if you happen to see his face when he heard the news...I very much ashamed actually... if it happens to be any other guy, i wouldn't be very much agitated,  but THE HELL!!! IT'S AARON!!! i almost throw up!!! I'm sorry if i'm too hard on this... but this is how i really feel... he's not even good-looking... I hope FF is reading this... 'cause i swear... i'm bound to avenge myself for that!!! Also for my very cute and lovable friend SHAZERU FUUMA, better watch out girl... you're in this too...  Anyway, i made another blog today... but i'm not telling you (especially FF) my URL... the things in there are highly confidential and down-to-earth sentimental...  I don't have any money left, and i'll soon be out on the streets... starving...  I'm alone and alone and alone and alone and alone and alone and alone and alone and alone and alone... and it's only noon...   I had a sausage for BRUNCH, that's all i can afford rightnow...  I sew my dresses...T-shirts and pants that needs sewings (can you believe i know hoe to sew?)  I also need to do my laundry(then what am I doing here?)  I need to come up with a thesis statement for my report...  I need to review for my exam in Math...  I need to look for a laptop...  I need to E-mail my Dad...  I need to...  END THIS...   BYE!!  DARNED FF AND FUUMA...I'LL GET YOU NEXT TIME!!!

          I can never forget wat happened yesterday, it was such a simple gimmick and a very tiring wallk but i wasn't aware of it. Perhaps it's because i'm with people that i really want to be with... And i swear, it was a gimmick that people might turn down, coz like i said, it's really tiring and simple... IMAGINE THIS:     We just finished a test that was so dissapointingly easy ('coz i happen 2 study, which i rarely do) and we decided to have a bit of fun...watch sunset in Manila Bay. Unfortunately, it was only 10:30 in the morning so we decided to hit the mall, particularly the VIDEOKE and sing some out of tune songs... then we ate and headed to BAYWALK via PEDRO GIL, ofcourse, it would be a dumb idea to wait for the sunset coz it's only about 1:00 in the afternoon, so we headed to CCP...by foot and all...when we got there, we rented some bicycle, and ofcourse, ride it for 2 hours. We are grim by then because it was cloudy and actually drizzling and we are afraid that we won't be able to see the sunset. Anyway we pass the time biking. We got our hopes up, when, by four in the afternoon, we saw the cloud break and the sun peeping into the clouds... we decided to hit the road and wait for the sun to set... so once again, we walked...and walked... we were exhausted, nonetheless, we walked... halfway the manila bay, we gave up the thought of seeing the sun, coz it was too cloudy, although it wasn't raining, so we continue our walked and headed for the Boardwalk...(can u believe that from pedro gil to manila bay, then ccp, then boardwalk, not to mention the 2 hour bicycle ride!!) With little luck, aching feet and a enormous amount of stamina, we made it, at last, to the BoardWalk... We hastily buy some food and refreshments, 'coz for my part, i felt that i was about to collapse (joke). Anyway, we arrived there before six, and the sky is starting to darken already... when it was completely dark, we face the sea...or bay... and stare into oblivion, (which feels good...don't know why...) and meditated a little, chat a little (actually we chat N chat till we drop...) and finally decided to go home...     If u think that we finally came to our senses and ride back home...ur definitely wrong... 'coz by that time we no longer have money for our fare... so once again we walked... from boardwalk, we cross Luneta park, found our selves in UN ave. and finally my dormitory in which i abode... I was so tired and my feet aches a lot, but i didn't care... and did i mention that i happen to treat them with some fingerfoods and drinThat day for me was so special, that my friends and i decided to do it AGAIN, right folks, WE'LL DoTHAT WALK AGAIN, with more company, on monday afternoon...

      There's only one reason why i created this blog... it's when i've decided to trust this blog and reveal to it my real personality... Very seldom do people see me... perhaps because i rarely reveal myself... but today starting now, i'll let you see me...  I had and have so many friends... outside, i'm a very friendly person.  But none of them has gone deep enough to touch me...my inner soul...    Although outspoken, i find it hard to tell somebody what i really feel... just like now...  People,especially close friends, makes fun of me and tease me a lot... it's fine with me... they don't bother me... for they tease and laugh to somebody who's not really me...that's why i don't care...or atleast i think so...  People, especially those who have known me think that i should and could do everything and anything... they don't know that i, too, get tired...  People, especially those are with me thinks i'm noisy and chatty... but inside i'm silent...alone...  People, generally, think that i'm a happy-go-lucky crammer who do a lot of tripping every now and then... they didn't know that it's my way of expressing my thoughts... cause they don't know how to listen...they don't feel me...they look right past through me...  i basically don't care if people can't see me... i just have to make sure that i'm still me... however, i'm waiting for somebody that has the capability to see me beyond what others can see... someone who can fathom my personality...  BUT WHO AM I?  i am nothing but average actually...  Define AVERAGE?  That's just the problem... but technically, i'm just somebody who wants to belong... without the usual trying-hards and smooth facades... i'm like the water... it can be anything it wants to be... given intense heat... it can be as light as air... intense cold... hard as ice... or it can be just as unpredictable as it is... just plain water...  Water can be a giver of life... a source of replenishment, however, it can be the giver of destruction, like waves and floods... I, on the other hand, can be both...  I hope i can get out... and i hope it's soon... soon enough for me to enjoy the remaining years of my life... and if ever i do come out... i hope they will understand...
