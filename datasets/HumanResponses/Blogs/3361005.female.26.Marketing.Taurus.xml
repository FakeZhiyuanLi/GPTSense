      I'm so confused today. I thought I was in a trusting relationship, but the past few days have really made me doubt those feelings. On Thursday, I came home after work and thought I'd check my home e-mails (I'm on the computer all day at work, so they don't get checked all that regularly). Much to my suprise and dismay, I read an email forwarded to me from some "girl" named Kim. It's a conversation between "her" and my boyfriend. It basically went something like this: (Kim) Hey, remember me? (Jeremy) No, refresh my memory. (K) We used to chat, I live in OP and remember talking to you. So what's your situation? i.e. Relationship status?(J) I'm in a relationship, but looking for something on the side if that's OK with you. (K) If you're in a relationship, why are you looking for something on the side? Does your girlfriend not do it for you? (J) It's not that, we've just been together for a while and now I'm looking to get into something new, if you know what I mean... And that's basically when the emails were forwarded to me by this Kim "girl." So of course, I freak out and my boyfriend ends up telling me what happend. I'm just pissed at this point, but we talk and I'm tired and have to work in the morning, so I just go to bed. On Friday, he forwards me an email that basically lets both of us know that the email wasn't from a girl named Kim, it's from some guy who apparently has feelings for me, but doesn't say anything to me, just tries to break my relationship up. Jeremy says that he only responded like that (the on the side, something new thing) to try and figure out who was behind the email. That he knew it couldn't have been from anyone he'd been chatting with before we got together because of the email address they used. Since asking who the person was wasn't getting him anywhere, this is the route he chose. He now admits that this was the wrong way to handle the situation, but is that only because I found out about it?   I was ready to break it off there, but the things he said made me think. He admitted to "saying" what he did and that it was wrong, he swears up and down that I'm the only one he wants to be with, professes his love and asks why, if I love him, won't I try to work things out? So he hasn't done anything wrong...yet. I just don't know what to think. Today I stopped by his place (I missed him, ok?) and we talked again, which of course led to making up. Now he's wondering if I'll still be going out of town with him to his sister's graduation and where we stand. I'm wondering if I should introduce him to my parents (as planned) when they get into town. In one sentence, he's saying we should take it slow and maybe only see each other a few nights a week, he's trying to get stuff done around his house, getting caught up on bills and so on and so forth. I agree with him, that is what he should be doing and driving across town to stay with me every night probably isn't the best decision in the grand scheme of things - especially with his gas guzzler and the price of gas working together to eat up as much money as possible. In the next sentence, he's talking about getting married and having kids.  I know that part of all this comes from the fact that he doesn't think he's good enough - he doesn't have $$ like my family does or whatever. In all honesty, I don't care about all that, but I understand and respect his desire to do so. I'll help as best I can, but I'm still so afraid that he's going to hurt me. My heart tells me he won't, but my head keeps reminding me of the situation this weekend, which makes me ask myself what part of me I should be listening to. I want to be with him, to make this work so badly, but can I trust him and who is this other guy that is trying to get in my heart and be my savior? Such a predicament. What they say is true, love IS blind!
