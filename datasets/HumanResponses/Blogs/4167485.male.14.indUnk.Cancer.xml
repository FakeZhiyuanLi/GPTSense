       Hey, it's Me. I made a little button that you can use to link to my blog if you'd like. Just copy and paste the code below for the image&link.     urlLink      &lt;a href="http://www.gamr25.blogspot.com"&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.artwanted.com/images/large/9030_107709.gif"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

       Wow... I did not know my blog didn't allow anonymous posting. Sorry about that. It's all better now ^_^ Also, I am going to use "Hello", an image hosting program  from  Blogger&trade;, to host my comics. Before I was using  urlLink ArtWanted , but that only let me upload 5 images per  month . Now I can do as many as I want!  I think...  Enjoy the new changes and tell me what you think.

       Hey, it's Me. Before I posted today's comic, I thought that I would like to explain a little bit about my comics in general. Yes, they're made in MS Paint, but I believe that it won't harm their content very much. I'm not the best artist in the world, so even if I did spring for a good imaging program, I wouldn't be able to make stuff that looked half as good as these MS Paint comics. Also, all the comics are based on actual conversations between my friends and family. I don't just make it up ;) I would like for people to comment on the comics so I know what you like and what you don't like and for me to change accordingly. Have fun.

        Hey, it's Me. Today, I'm going to review the free demo I have played of   Battlefield 1942: Secret Weapons of WWII   courtesy of Gamespy Arcade™ and FilePlanet™.    The Good:   Team Death Match (TDM)  is very fun and you won't get bored of playing the same exact level every time thanks to online multiplayer.  Capture the Flag (CTF)  isn't  as  fun persay, but it's still up there on the list.    The Bad:  Not everyone is willing to help you out, and some people will kick you off their server for "asking too many questions and messing them up." The lagging issues are a problem, but it simply depends on the ping of the players. The higher the ping, the more laggy the game gets. The more laggy the game gets, the faster you're going to die. 'nuf said.   The Ugly:  Have you seen these guys' faces??   In conclusion, I give it a 4 out of 5 and recommend it to any fan of the WWII genre.

       Hey. This is Me, My Blog, and Ice Cream. I have decided to provide this web log a.k.a. "blog" as to give off a general idea of what's going on in my life. Unlike another live.... journal, I decided to make this solely based on my actions and not thoughts. I thought it would also be more interesting. Drop off as many comments as you'd like because  I don't read those  they're really helpful.  Signed, M,MB,&amp;IC
