           Oy vey, its about three in the A.M. and I just got back from a midnight showing of Farenheit 9/11.   urlLink Wow.   There were reports of people actually being so appalled at this film to go as far as slashing the screen in anger.  And it's easy to see why, to put it bluntly, I love Michael Moore.  In short, it's about the bush adminidstration and such follies and gags.  Mr. Moore goes into the very bowels of the bush admniistration(too big of a word for this late at night) and brings up all the dirty secrets that they have been hiding in the past four years.  It goes from the election, to the patriot act all the way through the war in Iraq.  Not only that, but he got to poke fun at bush the entire time.  Its good wholesome family fun.  Actually I shouldn't say that, there are in fact a lot of very graphic scenes that were incredibly hard to watch.  A lot of things that made me incredibly angry that this could ever happen.  Even though some of these things were very difficult for me to watch, it is necessary to know about such things so that we can know what is going on in our nation.  There are also  urlLink a few points  that I wanted to be put in that weren't.  This movie also made me incredibly frustrated that I, still being a minor, cannot vote on this topic.  The movie is two hours and three minutes long, is rated R and should be angering republicans in a theatre near you.
