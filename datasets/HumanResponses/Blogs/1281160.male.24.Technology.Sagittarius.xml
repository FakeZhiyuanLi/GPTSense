       Saturday :  Nothing seemed to work out my way. I was on leave. Home was a noisy and busy place that day with lots of relatives. Waited till evening to get away from there.   I thought that the evening would have been much better as my schedule had been booked. Nothing went right. had been waiting for the singing classes with a couple of friends for more than an hour from 5 pm. Noone else turned up. After a call to my friends, I learnt that the singing practice had been cancelled, but the choir practice was to be held at 7 pm.   After a cup of coffee and went to my friends' home. As she was going to a prayer meeting being held all night, she said she would not be able to make it to the choir practice. Somehow managed to get to the church (Church of Resurrrection) on time. Same old story. "if you can wait and not be tired by waiting.."   Except a few, nobody turned up. Myself and a couple of others have a practice of going to a church (Our Lady of Fatima) every Saturday and have some fast foods out every week. As usual went to the church.   Actually, the main reason I took leave onn Saturday was to attend the all night prayer meeting at this church. Our choir was supposed to sing there. Almost all the English choirs of various churches were invited. But due to some last minute reasons, we were unable to sing. So we decided to participate there. Only myself and my friend decided to go to the church for the all night prayer.  It wasn't meant to be so. I called him saying that I was ready to go. He said thaat he was feeling sleepy. So the day ended with a dissapointment. As I didn't feel sleepy, I decided to write a story. I wanted to dedicate this story for my friend.   It is a birthday present to her.  If anyone wants to read it, Send me a mail. I'll send it to you by mail.    Sunday :  Everything as expected. Got up late. Hurrried to get ready for Church. Made it on time. had a short practice as yesterday's practice got postponed. This week, our singing had improved a lot. last week it was a total mishap.   informed everyone about the evening practice. By 3 pm, I realized I didn't have breakfast and lunch. Rushed home. had a hearty lunch. Played "Age of Empires" and "Age of Mythology". The computer opponent didn't put up much of a fight. So I won easily.  Evening, had a singing practice. After that, we had a great discussion about education. Went back home after checking mails at 9 pm. No mails from anyone. Spent about 20 minutes deleting junk mails from my various mail ids. Spent another 20 minutes waiting for my friend to finish browsing. Went back home.  Expecting your weekend stories,   Jax  .

      Hi,    Spent the last two mornings replying to mails from the group.  It was a cumbersome and tedious process.   Went home very late last night. Was not doing nothing much in particular at office yesterday. As a result, came in late today morning...   Ranjini had asked mailed me something about my previous entry. This is for her.   WMD -&gt; weapons of mass destruction, eg nuclear, biological, and chemical weapons.   dithers-&gt; hesitates.   differs -&gt; thinks otherwise.

      Hi,   My weekend was almost the same as RamG. Not a surprise... as I spent half of it with him. I've been given some designing work... I mean... design of a component. Just a high-level design. But I'm struggling for that itself. Coding, I can manage. But designing... its pretty tough work. But my PL is insisting on me thinking it out... In fact, I got more work... I need to prepare for a presentation on BizTalk' s response time that I was measuring over the past few weeks. Yet to get that started. And still some measuring needs to continue after we port everything to a 2 CPU server. That might take time. But as of now I'm doing some multi-tasking b'n ppt and designing...   boy... this designing stuff is taking the heck out of me...  Kicha

      Hi,    On World Cup...     So... Its all over... But not really... things r just beginning to build up... There r quite a few positive things that the Indian team can take forward after the world cup...   1. We were 202/5 after 34 overs. Scoring 200+ in 34 ov is not an easy task against an Aussie bowling attack. This goes to show our batting strength. But, the only trouble was all the bowlers had an off-day on the same day.  2. Dravid did decent job behind wickets all this time. From now on, they can look forward to grooming Parthiv Patel. He's an ecxcellent keeper and a fair batsman and above all he's only 16 !!!  3. Bangar was used as a frontline bowler when we went to WI and as a lower order one-day batsman when they came here. Right prospects to get a genuine all-rounder in the side which will effectively make India go with 5 bowlers.  4. With Parthiv in, as a specialist keeper, India might shuffle between Bangar, Agarkar and Dinesh Mongia depending on form and fitness of players. Srinath and Kumble are ageing and r already almost over-the-hill.  5. With Sehwag showing some weakness with the moving ball I feel they might well be back to Sachin-Sourav opening combination and Sehwag might come in the middle/late order to take care of slog overs.   6. Yuvraj and Kaif might also be retained for test matches. As these two have got excellent temperament and so could be quite a handful in the tests as they gain some experience.  So, after all, nothing is lost.

      Hi,  S we had a fantastic weekend (myself and kicha, on saturday), went to nandhi hills, superb place.. and fanstastic memorable hill resort which will cherish anyone... we had a great day over there, morning by 5.30 we got up after discussing a long about solution the day b4 and sleeping past mid night... catch bus by 7.20 to majestic, from there 8.30 to nandhi hills.. reached the base of the hill by 10.30.. had some refereshments over there, reached the top by 11.00... went roaming the entire hill for around 2 hours.. had breeze over the top mountain.. nice sleep for about 40 mts in the orchard...Okay food in a hotel... then by 2.15 took bus to blr... on the way to down...conductor (the point to be noted is LADY) stoped a bus in a shop to have tender coconut for them... Y ????? we should wait and watch them having those.. so we both ordered two for us.... and before I finish it... the driver has finished...and conductor (lady) also atmost finished.... the driver pressed the horn... to remind us to finish soon... but how dare she....Whistled and said "Right,,,, Right" no probs, Kicha has already finished.. and I also atmost... anyway we have paid also.. hence thatz all the scene over there.... Back to home by 5.30.. had chat by 6.30 b4 that a light tea...sent offf kicha...and heared songs.. went to bed...  Sunday... got up early by 8.00 am....dressed up to office. by 11.00 am.... replied the hell no.. of mails (nearly 12 within 2 days...) and official nearly 6 within a day.... had some work for half an hour... and started browsing...  by 1.40 came to know ganguly rarely won the toss..but prefered to field.. he taught as like new zealand, and pakistan... But Ricky's Pounding 9 sixes and unbeaten 144 most of u know... made a tremendous target for Indians to climb ...like Mt. Kanchenjunga...  I watched at times.. had my lunch by 2.30... then came for browsing... then by 5.30 or so.. went to watch our play in the pitch..... since the target is huge.. I almost taught we lose and they deserve... anyway there is bit criples in my heart saying "WE should get the cup etc..like that" but sachins out in 4 and ganguly left the rest the Gang without a strong hold..assured the cup to aussie...  Now shewag was doing fine.. and there was a bit rain.. so  I thought yagas and yaganas are going for our pray.. to nature.. to abadon the match and restart.. but that too favoured aussies.. Who really deserve...But was quiet and calm...  So I left the office by 9.00 after watching a little bit match here and there..to have a nice dinner and sleep...  Thatz over with the weekend...  Anyway just to encourage Rini... I typed these..coz..If some one is responding we should go with them.... have lot of work.. moving out.. since testing had to be completed b4 tommorrow's release...  Bye Cheerfully Ram  coming to kichas "A.C Muthaih..." Its human mind man.. finding way for the destination.... and that too.. Politicians and great heads... Has to say something.... they dont have enough time to think for Journalists questions... I am sure..Muthaih.. might have realised the same after 2 hours of delivering the news...

      Hi friends,  Hei what a nice inning by aussies! Really they deserved it i beleive. Anyway most of the time , i flet the cup is for indians. Its really good that atleast theyw ent to final! Every body played well in their team and so our guys could not meet them with the same vigour. Its ok.  So coz, of this match most of the people's weekend would have got spoilt......... But for a real cricket fan, aussi innings would have been a good feast. U know what, when we were travelling in bus to ISKCON yesterday morning, near M.G. road, u should see the josh of Bangaloreans....... There was a long proecession with a band of people playing, India will win and some thing like that. Then they were carrying a long flag around 50 - 60 metres length and in the end there was a tempo where in 4 purohits were sitting & doing a homam kind of thing. Even while returning in the afternoon, we could see so many indian flags fluttering. Reaally i felt them to be a bit stupid. Anyway its their way of expressing things and what does it have to do with me.   But i watched whole of aussie innings and then watched till tendul got out. After that it was becoming so obvious that we will give away the cup to them. so got back to my personal work. So i dont feel i missed or messed my weekend! How about u people?

      After a long time, I enjoyed watching a part of nice Indian innings. As they dint surf channels often at my hostel, I was able to maintain my interest else, I would not have seen....... When I went hostel yesterday, Tendulkar's innings was over and it was Ganguly and Kaif who were batting. Though I had missed my favorite's play, Sourav never made us feel dull. All were telling, we wont be scoring more than 250( when I started watching it was 198/2 in some 42 over or so) but for me I was telling they will surely score more than 260, coz Kenya is not such a strong team and still over to go and we guys usually bat well in last five over and had the pitch been nice, then no doubt we would have crossed the 300 runs mark once again. But still last five over really it was nice with 3 sixes from Gang and one splendid effortless six from Yuvraj! Finally the score was 270 , more than what I had expected!    But all these shots if they could replay with aussies then we can win! Lets wait and see. Somehow these guys are playing well and they are thru to finals. But it will be really lovely to see Ganguly lift the cup along with Sachin holding Man of the tournament award(which is for sure as he is the top run scorer with 669 runs to his credit in just 10 matches of this tournament) . Wish sachin to display his game once again as he did in Sharjah few years back and help us lift the trophy same like before.   When Ganguly hit a super six, One caption was nice among audience displays, which is like "Beware of Gang of Ganguly". During India Pak match also they had some display which was also nice it seems. It was like "World peace for everyone and World cup for India." Last few over was really a nice feast to all cricket lovers.   I dint see kenyans batting and so went upstairs and was reading a book " flowers and messages" and then went off to sleep as I was feeling so drowsy. Then got up and got back to the daily activities and now at office , mailing u as I am bit freeeeee.   Only two days to go for the world cup finals and u guys are interested in war! Sorry i am in a sporting mood...........

       In an  urlLink article   in TOI, Mr A C Muthiah, president of Federation of Indian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, said :  "The aftermath of the war will give great opportunity for Indian engineering companies. We should be prepared to use Dubai as an entry point for steel and construction companies to supply construction material, he told reporters on the sidelines of the conference. We should chose Dubai as a warehouse and move the goods. The opportunity in the aftermath of war is fantastic," he said.  Businesses are so SICK that they relish in attacking another country and destroying it - so that they can look forward to "rebuilding it and making great profits" !!! Man thats cool - someday some country could decide to bomb India - so that the business in that country (and their allied countries) can also make "profits".... Disturbing....

      Hi everyone,    The war has finally started in Iraq.       My thoughts on the war:   It is totally unwarranted  for. I believe that this war is just an excuse for Bush to browbeat the world into acknowledging the US as a world's policeman. Bush says that the people of Iraq have been suffering under Saddam and that Saddam is bad for the people of Iraq.   I  guess if someone (say a leader of any other nation) believes that Bush is bad for US,  that person can initiate a war to topple Bush's regime in US (same logic as US invasion of Iraq).   Bush has also said that Saddam  posseses WMD. Hans Blix differs. UN dithers. But tell what can the world if a couple of US special forces take into Iraq a few WMD devices and proclaim that they had captured it. Surely Bush would not allow anyone to inspect it clainmimg it as  prize of war."Will America forget about nation building in Iraq -- the same way America forgot about nation building in Afghanistan --  urlLink as soon as the Iraqi oil wells are secured?"  I can only feel sad that around 70% of the US citizens support "little Bush" in his war to depose the man from Tikriti.   urlLink  'Today I weep for my country'    While  it's raining bombs in Baghdad, it is pouring at Durban. India's WC seems to be a washout. the Kenyans might have been washed out anyway on the field,  barring a few dodos and pigs flying. With  urlLink heavy rains  predicted for the rest of the week in South Africa, I hope that this tournamnet doesn't go the way of the ICC Champions League held a few months back at Colombo.  Hoping for your thoughts on the US invasion of Iraq... Jax.

      Hi,  I certainly go with the article in "The Hindu"... Xavier u r right a sport cant be a religion...  Also if u see, skill of a sportsman is not the same at any instance of time.... In sportsman's victory skill is one of the factor...  But for scientist, artist, economist... etc... skill is the only factor...  Since South Africa didnt entered into the super six stage we cant say they didnt deserve world cup... similarly since Kenya entered into the semifinal we cant say they deserve the world cup....  Hope u all get me...  Ram

      Dear Kicha,  I hope you had read this article in the "Hindu" on Sunday. If not, read it  urlLink here .  I hope that answers a few of your doubts.  The founding fathers had an interest in sports. They might have never envisioned the growth of a sport as a religion. You might find that every constitution in the world doesn't allow sport as a major  factor in public life.  It might have been so in ancient Greece, but not in the present world.    BTW. When is George Bush going to quote Shakespeare?  urlLink "Cry Havoc!" and let slip the dogs of war.  -Shakespeare, Julius Caesar III.i.270 .  Jax

      hi,  something to ponder...  recently there has been some lines being spoken in political circles on conferring Bharath Ratna to Sachin Tendulkar.  ur comments on that...???   but the legal terms for conferring Bharath Ratna, as on date, states that  "This ward is given each year by President of India "for exceptional service towards the advancement of Art, Literature, Science and in recognition of Public Service of the highest order".  check it out  urlLink here  ... this is from the constitution.  u'll find that sports is ignored. May be the good ol' people who framed our constitution thought sports wasn't as important...  Kicha

It was a pleasant weekend... what else could be a trip to home... couldn't see any of our friends there... but called on almost whoever is possible to be called...  R Sindhu asked to convey her very BIG wishes to rini and also added that she's angry for not receiving mails for quite sometime...   Others whoever I called asked me to convey my regards to everyone here... I talked to jax also over phone...   Apart from calling on people I slept, slept and saw TV ... so that�s about my calm weekend. My April's quota of visit home might be in mid-April...   Kicha

      It has been touted as one of most important games in the criket world cup - India vs New Zealand. Every Indian cricket fan wants revenge for India's performance at New Zealand. After the India-Pakistan match, this face-off was very much awaited for.   But people keep forgetting the fact that cricket is a sport, where winning and losing is all part of the game. Yes, Cricket is a religion in India. I hope no one wants to be a religious fanatic.  For the past one week, I have seen news reports which say that India is winning all its matches only after the fans at home had indulged in public humilation of the cricketers. This is ignorance and idiocy at its best. India got beaten by the best team in the world. That's it.  Anyway, I will be rooting for India today. But I hope that the best team wins...   urlLink Visit this...

       Microsoft Readies Its Answer To Autonomic Computing spacer By John Foley, InformationWeek  spacer Microsoft next week will unveil its answer to autonomic computing, a software architecture and application-development approach called the Dynamic Systems Initiative. The first technologies to support the concept will be delivered as part of Windows Server 2003 when the operating system ships next month. Other elements will surface in Microsoft's development tools, applications, and management products over the next few years.  The initiative represents Microsoft's attempt to provide a software environment for data centers that's more automated and efficient and less complex. "We're starting to deliver the plumbing that's necessary to do that," says Bob O'Brien, group product manager for Windows Server 2003. "We really see this as a dramatically different approach."  Up first are new tools in Windows Server 2003 such as the Resource Manager, which gives more control over CPU and memory utilization, and Virtual Disk Service, for managing storage area networks. Next will be technology called Automated Deployment Service, to be unveiled next week, that will support what O'Brien calls "intelligent provisioning" of Windows and related software for faster setup on servers. If it works as promised, ADS, developed by Microsoft Research, will cut the time it takes to deploy servers from days to minutes, O'Brien says. Another related technology to be delivered this year is the virtual machine software that Microsoft is acquiring from Connectix.  Microsoft's approach to data-center automation will require the participation of hardware companies, other software vendors, and systems integrators. It also means developers will need to think differently about the applications they build by designing software that runs across a more flexible infrastructure. "It's going to extend the way they build apps to include more intelligence in them via an additional design surface," says O'Brien. Microsoft will describe the ramifications for application development in upcoming conferences, though no changes to its VisualStudio.Net tools are expected this year.  spacer

      My PL was on travel last week. He's supposed to get back today. Waiting for him... I can't proceed until he gets back and helps me out with the BizTalk Server thing... I'm not able to make head or tails out of it. Meanwhile, I'm continuing to do some work with the other part of my application - reading some measurements (without BizTalk) of response time for a message from a 'send' to a 'receive' ... its throwing up some interesting results in fact... a 11 byte message takes on an avg of 300-340 ms while messages of 1K, 2K and 3K take less than 100 ms ... that is pretty consistent on different loads of 60,120,240,480 and 560 messages/minute...  Got to study this a bit more... but I need to check the results with BizTalk too and waiting for my PL for that...  Kicha

      That's the whole  raison d'etre  of this blog. If people get interested and are ready to post atleast once a day, we can include them. Also it would be helpful for us to read the FAQs to understand the possibilities and limitations of blogging.  Guess what, I am supposed to prepare 13 x 2-page pdfs. I think it might eat up my entire day today.   More later, Jax.

      Not many cared about batchmates did they...? and not many r going to care this too if we r trying to increase the strength to beyond a level. Only people who r constantly accessing mails throughout the day may be interested in this. So, that makes me feel that this is not going to be a hit by any standards if posted to msitmmb and asking people to join. The smaller with better accessible people, the better.   We can post some useful things like the grammar stuff and some interesting pieces, technical or otherwise in this and use the mails for our normal communication like my start-of-the-day routines and whenever we expect some specific reply. In that way we can have the best of both worlds.   BTW, jax try to find out how to post images/files to this. coz, that'll be very useful...  Kicha

      This entire week has been consumed by a translation work. Using machine translation engines has become a double edged sword. They allow quicker translations that are free, but the translations are illogical. I wanted to translate Plant (the green one which has leaves and flowers on it); Google's translation service is adamant on giving the translated word for plant( the one with lots of people and machinery spewing out pollution.  Got to translate a lot of pages... French, German, Italian, Dutch (My head is already spinning with words). I'm still searching the net for free translation engines..

Hope the rains stop so that I can make it. Ah! the sun has started shining again. The humidity is making me sweat a lot. As Kicha knows, our office is on the top floor, so the heat gets to me very quickly.    Kicha, saw your photos yesterday. Mmmm! looks like a very good computer to me (Dell). I like the black coloured PC's very much. Send the config of your system to me later. I am here stuck up with a very old Cyrix PC, that likes to test my patience and endurance to its limit.

      Hi,    Browsing the web has become very addictive. I just cannot resist from clicking on any hyperlink that appears on a webpage. I spent the morning visiting all types of sites catering tastes ranging from  urlLink gossip  to the unused but very useful  urlLink technological ideas.     Here is a small list of the sites / blogs I've been reading today      urlLink http://nontroppo.org/     urlLink Alex Halavais    urlLink Meg Hourihan     There are still a lot of websites that I have visited today. I am thinking of adding a sidebar that will list a few of the sites that I or you have visited. It can be done, but requires a little bit of programming and tweaking techniques. As I am not the technical expert in this group, I feel that our techie friends can try thier hand at this.    Bye,   Jax .  Before I go, I need a favour from you all. Can you suggest me a good gift for a frind of mine? It is a she, aged 23. Something that would appeal to the feminine side. (No jewellery please). Something simple and elegant.

      Hi,   oh jax... Ram and Rini have the facility of dropping into the Bangalore Golf Club anytime, but Kicha is blessed with a mini-Golf course within the campus of his company.

IBM MQ Series-1    urlLink IBM MQ Series-2      Need to compare its performace with BizTalk Server and prepare the next version (ver 0.2) of the current white paper (which is under review). I've given a timeline to my PL that the work will be done by June 20th. So, have to switch to the next gear.  and jax, the paper will not appear at infy.com ... it is an IP of infy and will be used by the Technical Architects and/or Project Managers who will go in for consultation for the clients.

      Hi everyone,    I'm back. Actually I have got a lot of work to do, but I don't feel like doing so. So I'm whiling away time browsing websites. Especially as my boss is out of town, everyone is feeling relaxed. Any way, Thursday is a holiday. I want to rest at home.     Life seems so boring nowadays, especially in the evenings. Not being the type that enjoys going out, I feel so bored. I tried to learn a few languages like Latin and Icelandic. No, nothing worked out right.     How's life at your ends, guys and gals? Same story?..    Ram, Golf is not only a game for great personalities, but it is one game that gives you a great personality. The wide open spaces, the thick woods, dotted with water hazards and dangerous bunkers. I only wish I could get into a golf course and have a few swings. Sindu seems to have the luck. Ram, Kicha and Rini have the facility of dropping into the Bangalore Golf Club anytime. The only golf course in Coimbatore is almost 20 kms away.     The woods are lovely, dark and deep,  But I have sites to visit and blogs to read..    Currently I am reading      urlLink k10k.net    urlLink Elegant Hack    urlLink Rebecca's Pocket       Adios,

      Hi,   Sindu, you call them "golf clubs". There are usually 9 clubs in a set. Each club has its feature. Be careful with them. You can kill a person with one. Especially with a 5 Iron.

      Hi,  A memorable day for me. Just had my first presentation of my professional career. Things were different here. My PL gave me his Laptop to load the ppts to take to the conferance room. I've never touched a laptop until today and here I was struggling to roll my finger over, to move the mouse-cursor. Though presentations are nothing new to any of us, this audience was different... In our class, I could bluff anything about technology and seem smart and get away with that. But here, people know a hell lot more than me... about all I talk...  But they acted within my limitations. And, of course, my PL was there to rescue me whenever I showed any slightest hint of doubt in answering something.   The presentation went on for about 1 hr and 40 mins including the Q&A time. At the end of it all, I got the same feedback that I got during my MS(IT&M) presentations - Talking too fast....!!!  Guess, I need to do more mending on my "express speaking" ways...   Overall, it was a very satisfying presentation for me. And furthermore, the white paper that I've prepared (and which, the presenatation was all about)... is gone for a review. Once it is done then my first white paper will be released across infy.

      hi friends, just now came to terms with the fact that its monday morning and i have plenty of work piled up...im still not out of the weekend mood.... on sat..we had been to Birmingham to send off one of Boomi's friend who was leaving to India.....after dropping him off at Airport we started to Oxford...to visit yet another Boomi's friend.....the Oxford city is flooded with colleges....it has around 25 colleges with huge campuses...old buildings...only one college is built recently with modern architecture.... amidst huge oppsition from the public. Oxford is a bit smaller when compared to Cambridge....New college is located in Cambridge(Nehru studied here)..the whole city is so lively with students all round the globe...cambridge is the largest city with Cycle population in Europe.... on Sunday morning V called our parents..Boomi complained to my parents that im not cooking these days....so gave him a bang on his back.....then we went to Churchill gardens...the place where were Winston churchill was born...the place is so huge that u have small shuttle train running inside the campus....there is a place where golf game is open for public.....so i got geared up and started playing with Boomi as my opponent....v ended up fighting with the golf strikers(i dont what u call that!)..... after that it was time for us get back to hinckley..its 2 hrs drive from Oxford.... for the past 2 days the weather was ok...but today again it is cold, rainy and windy...so asked Boomi to drop me in my office.....so here iam still strugling with the stupid accent once again.....  cheers Sindu

      Mes Amis,  At last, I with my friends get to sing for a wedding mass. One of our friends is getting married next monday (May 5). She wanted us to sing for her wedding. So at last we get a long awaited chance. So I'll be busy this week with practices et al.   By the way, what happened to Sindu? No message from her? Still trying to understand the British accent of her clients.  If you notice I have swapped the team and archives sections. Kicha, try to put the web addresses that you sent within anchor tags. I spent a few seconds clicking on them, before realizing that they were not hyperlinks. It would be nice if you give them as hyperlinks, or even better if they open in a new page with target="_blank" option.  My weekend went like this.   Sunday : Church - browsing (Chatted with  Rajesh  and invited  Vijay Babu  to the blog) - Evening Choir Practice - Night Treat for my friend's birthday.  My idea for the right side panel: small bios like Name / Star sign / Location / Hobbies. I am giving my sample:   Jax / Pisces / Coimbatore / Reading, writing and music  .  Rini seems to be busy with her wedding preparations. Anything we could help you with?  Expecting everyone's comments and suggestions,

      Hi,  This is great work jax. And this is why I insist that u retain the admn rights with urself alone.   Friday, I was down with fever. And, thanks to my PL, my presentation got postponed to today and am back to full strength. Saturday I was waiting for Ramgopal to call me at my house. But didn't receive his call. It was in late sunday afternoon that I realized the secrect behind why Ramg didn't call me - our phone was out-of-order. Today, I'm looking forward to the first presentation that I'm giving in my corporate life.   And its great to see the blog growing. All credits to jax, as he was the one who first introduced this concept of WebLogs to all of us. This is getting exciting by the day.  Kicha

      Dear Rini,  Ok, Don't get heated up on the chicken and duck thing.  Regarding the layout, I'm still experimenting with it. The design might change anytime. We have got a few space on the right to post our favorite links. Send a few good ones. We will utilize the space well. There is also some space on the left. I'm thinking of swapping the archives section and the team section.   Hey, what do you think about posting a small bio of each member? Everyone tell me what to put there... I am expecting a lot of content to be put over there.   A small request to everyone, don't send your mail to me at my office id. I am getting a lot of mail to this id. And also anyone can view the mails, that's why. If it is anything urgent, you can post it to the blog or my personal id. Hope you understand.  I have also modified the blog entry to display the name of the blogger. So no more worries on wondering who posted the message. Also no need to sign your name everytime.  Bye,

      Hei guys, what is this, calling me as chicken and duck? If you people are really interested in such kind, sorry i am not and i wont be. So we better stop with this in our blog atleast!   And jax regarding the new layout of our blog, its good! but i feel with white background it will look still more good. Why dont you give a try! Hei sindhu, Welcome....  Nice to hear all your work related things out there!  Why are you going to resign rajesh? Ok tell me when u call up to my home this weekend! Hei only now the marriage preparations are becoming jaroor! Ya Silk saree discount has started and i am going to be busy with purcahse of sarees.  Any new designs you people encounter among your family members, kindly recommend a word of it to me too.  This weekend too was musical for me. Jax dont envy me ok! Hmmmm...... This time it was instrumental and not vocal! Guys though i dint know about it much i really enjoyed the music. Its so tantalising and soothing in that summer sunday evening under that pale white shaamiyana. Ya actually we were not for sure if the concert would be good or not. But as i had to get back to hostel, we have to start at 8 o clock from there and so were in a dilemma, but then we gave a try.   Now coming to the music concert. It was a Violin concert by Dr. N. Rajam. She really made us enjoy instrumental like anything. Though it was my first time to an instrumental concert, i could still enjoy the lingering of violin strings in my ear! When i started, i was telling him, that i wont be able to listen to instrumental and will be asleep half way down the concert....... But to my surprise i was awake every second, searching for something to understand the music and also enjoying my search. I have to depart fully loaded with enchanting music at 8 o clock!  It was not too crowded like Nithya's concert. But it was a worthy evening for me.   Before that in the morning we went to Music World and i bought one more casette of Nithyasree. Its a casette on one particular composer.(Othhukaadu Venkata subbaier, my favourite and the one who has composed Alaipaayuthey kanna song). I did see two more casettes at the concert displays, but as it was by sudha Raghunathan, so i decided to get it later!  Hei vijay come join us soon!  Ok guys will meet u later Till then Cares and shares Ranjini

      Hi Rajesh,  Welcome to the blog and you said Ranjin was a Koli. I thought she was a Vathu. I can console you on the loss of the cellphone connection but don't expect my sympathy for your Ranjitha. If you want, you can spend the wholee day calling her or waiting in froint of the Reliance office (as you are free now),  Vijay Babu wants to join us, I'm told by Rajesh. Seems like we are getting a lot of new faces to join us. Kicha and Ram take note. So i'll be sending him an invite now.  Bye, Jax.

      My search for a good blog layout continues... I spent the entire day visiting several blogs to understand thier layout.  I think it is time to put the HTML skills and Control C + Control V skills to use.   How does the new layout look? Took me a lot of time and hand coding with ^C & ^V.   A few technical details about the layout: Fluid design. Uses CSS. The content will automatically resize to fit into the window size. Try changing the size of the browser window and look at the content.  Will get back later,  Jax.

      Hi,      jax, a suggestion. Why don't you alone retain the admn rights. I feel, rather then each one of us having the rights and going about things, it would be more organized if one person could take charge of things and if anything needs to be done, we can request you to change. At times, if it becomes difficult for u for some reason to go about things u can temporarily give rights to someone for that purpose alone and then revoke it later when u r back. I feel, that'll keep it more organized just like msitmmb is doing good (admn-wise). However, others also share ur views on this before taking a decision.  And today... am not feeling well. Have some temperature. I was supposed to take a presentation today, but (thank GOD) my PL postponed it to monday on my request but asked me to have the presentation for the entire MSPSG (Ms Platform Solns Group) Team... rather than to the EAI Team alone (a sub-group within MSPSG, to which I belong).   Good... I have less strain today. I have to learn a new concept called Remoting to leverage on the performance tests that I had been doing. So, I'll spend the rest of the day brooding over MSDN... atleast I hope to be back to full strength for the presentation on monday.  Ganja: type ur name below ur post... the name does not automatically come in dayswork.blogspot.com page. So, this small request from my part... (if u think I being kind to u, refer ur offline msgs)...   Kicha

      Hi friends,  It is good to see you exchanging your views.   As more people are joining us, I feel that we should help those joining us. I had asked if anyone can prepare an user manual sort of doc. As I had invited you all to the blog, I don't know the exact sequence of steps that you followed to join the blog. The doc can be like:  1. After receipt of invitation to the blog, what to do? 2. Whether you have to create a blogger account etc.  If you noticed any change in the blog layout, don't worry. I was just trying to get a few things right like the layout and colour scheme. Sinduja had mailed me about her joining us. I noticed that she had two invites to the blog. In order to avoid duplication of efforts, temporarily I have removed the admin rights for all. I'll restore them later when the blog's layout scheme and other features are decided upon. You can continue your postings as usaul they won't get affected at all.  Will get back later today,  Jax.

      Yeah, Since Jax wishes let me also jump into the arena..................     wah wah  wah..........Rini..............Exactly U r right...........It cant be denied.................    I go with that,,,,,,  Then coming to Kicha...............whatz that man.............??????   There r 2 categories of people.  1. the "anything will do" kind  2. and the "nothing but this" kind  the 1s are ready to accept any kind of job. They might have a primary interest but may be ready to compromise it for anything under the sun as long as they r having the expected benefits out of the job. The 2s will not think of anything but what is in their mind (unless personal/family circumstances force them to go otherwise).    Note that.........u have started 1s as anything will do........and ended them with expect benefits .................doesnt it condradict....!!@!!   k, I have some work...........Let me come later.........with my views.. .. typed freely at home and bring it here..............  Bye, Ram    Hearty welcome to new blogers (Kavi, Rappi, Ganja.............)  cheerfully blog.....and share.................

      Hi friends, i am also eager to join you people, but that as i told, i am a bit occupied and thats restraining me from adding my views to the blog.  But then i can see that from Jax and Kicha's views there are few factors affecting the mindset of the people.  1. Not enough of awareness on the options available regarding IT related jobs is the first factor.  2. Inablilty of the teacher's to bring those options on to the students. In many cases its becoming now obvious that students excel teachers and they teach their own teachers.  3. Apart from this, i think, as an individual, the student himself doesnt know which field is suitable for him. Human nature is so complex and is a mixture of various aspects that it makes difficult for everyone to understand what is one's own strength and what one must pursue. Very few of them know feebly what will suit them and what they want to pursue in their career(including me). And very rarely few of them know exactly what is it they need and strongly pursue them. And most of them i hope u all know what i am going to say....... Yes i repeat, dont know what is one's own strength and what one must pursue! Its by trial and error and after many attempts one discovers what is needed and what is the exact match amongst many options available.   More views on this in my later blogs!   Ok friends lets welcome Ganesh, Rajesh and Kavitha to our group!   Wish them happy blogging.  bye for now   from  Ranjini

      Hi,    It is true that there is no data available to prove that other computer related workers rise faster in the corporate ladder than programmers. It is perfectly true that growth is more of a personal interest and proactivity. The hidden meaning is that I said most, not all programmers.     But tell me Kicha, be true to your heart and mind and tell me what chances are there for a programmer to enter into top management in a company. I admit the same chances apply to other posts also. The reason is programmers are seen with a notion that you say them something they do it. More of an command-following group. Again I have no data to back me up. I recall a quote by Mark Twain, "  There are three types of lies: lies, damned lies and statistics  ".    As for your query for course, there are indeed several courses available for other IT jobs I had mentioned. But the truth is everyone, including knowledgable persons, believe that programming is the de facto definition of an IT job. They tend to forget that it is more of a supportive job. Why, the entire industry is a supportive industry.    The reasons why the educational sector for these areas are still gray are obvious. Can you really justify that you are taught only programming. I accept that we have had labs only for programming. But we were in the science stream, you and me. Ask Ranjini about the labs she had. She can tell you lots. We had a paper called Computer System Architecture. If you had really got hooked onto the subject, you would have been a system administrator by now. There was a paper called Computer Graphics. If I had been interested, I could've become a Multimedia artist by now. The truth is that there were opportunities galore in front of us. The truth is that we never acknowledged them.     You had started your points on there being two kinds of people. You said that the 2nd type was focussed. But you ended somewhere on the lines of them being losers. Can you enlighten me on the above.BTW, which type do you consider yourself? the first or the second. Ii can tell you I am somewhat of a fifty-fifty.    I had determined not to take up a programming job, reasons being already mentioned. I was also passionate about writing, as you all know. When an opportunity presented itself, I grabbed it with both hands (writing and technology). I never rue it at all. But some think otherwise. Even last week, my friend's mom told me I was not utilising my talents. I asked her what my talents were. She said knowledge and writing. I said I am utilising it through my work. She didn't agree with me.     Really, I would like to know your views on going abroad.    Bye,    Jax.       Ram : This blog is for discussion alone. So feel free to post your thoughts about the matter. I am eager to know what you feel about this. Anyway discussions help us a lot to understand others better. Remember "empathy", "putting oneself in other's shoes" etc. So I will be waitng for yours and Ranjini's comments.       Kicha : I had given all of us admin privileges. So you can add them yourself. Anyway, don't take the trouble. I have send them the invitations. If possible, try helping them out to join the blog. If I have the time, I'll try to prepare a user manual sort of thing to help those joining us. But if any of you have the time, prepare one yourself and send it across to me for finetuning. I'll be busy for the next two days.    BTW, can anyone suggest me a good, informational site. I need it for my monthly newsletter. It should be helpful for lay persons. Because most of the people who get to read the newsletter are not always techno savvy. This is urgent. It would really be great if I get it by 1600 hrs IST.

      Hi,  jax brings up a nice topic. I could talk hours on it...   There r 2 categories of people.           1. the "anything will do" kind           2. and the "nothing but this" kind the 1s are ready to accept any kind of job. They might have a primary interest but may be ready to compromise it for anything under the sun as long as they r having the expected benefits out of the job. The 2s will not think of anything but what is in their mind (unless personal/family circumstances force them to go otherwise).   The first lessons need to start in college. It is up to the faculty to bring to the notice of students the various avenues opened up by an industry they r dealing with. Tell me, how many in our class had an idea of what their genuine interest was, at the time of studying, and of the few people who had, how many went on to work precisely where they wanted to (excluding people forced by personal/family circumstances).  It is the inability in analysing themselves and the industry, that is the cause of such ignorance. It is only in the hands of the faculty to groom them. But having said that, the faculty themselves need to update at a faster pace to keep their students at their toes - not something which boasts a good statistic. And no wonder the situation told by jax arises. Now decide, who's to be balmed.  On his second point of growth in their field of work... It all depends on the interest and proactivity exhibited by the individual. What data could be provided to say that  "Web Designers, Multimedia Artists, Marketing, System Administrators, Technical Writers, Customer Support, Administration & Support, System Analyst, Visualizers, Interaction/Information Designers" (and people in all other non-programming IT jobs)  move faster to higher management levels than programmers. It all depends on the individuals' interest, learnability, enthusiasm and proactivity. People assume that working in IT means programming because thats how their faculty have taught them in colleges. How many colleges/courses/papers are there for the above jobs.   They certainly fall less in number than things related to programming. But not all get genuine interest in programming, but they r taught nothing but programming - this is the paradox that students have to live with.   IT is more of a "help urself" industry for students. They cannot expect this input from college, still they need to have it. Or else, they will be languishing on what job to search for looong after they've completed their education....    Kicha

      Hi friends,   Today, I complete  one year  at Angler. I didn't know that days could rush so quick. The past one year had been a helluva an experience.   There were good times, not so good times, moments I would cherish and some I wish that had never happened at all. Looking around me, I find that there are people who had left the company in the past one year and those who have come in the same time.     Reminiscing on the past year, I've learned a lot. A lot about people, responsibilities,  expectations, organisations, clients, peers, work and most of all, life itself.     People have criticized me for choosing a line of work that is very remotely linked with my qualifications. But I believe that they are wrong. When some one asks me what I do. My reply is that I work for an IT company. Thier next question is ' As what, a programmer? ' or ' VB or ASP etc  .' I say ' No. I am a content developer .' They say ' Oh, what does that mean? '   I start by saying that I am responsible for the creation of the content or text for websites, multimedia cds,   marketing brochures etc. They say ' Oh, a writing job or a documentation work .'    God, how many times have I restrained myself from catching them by the throat and throttling them. Don't people ever understand that they are a lot of jobs in the IT industry other than programming. People have got it ingrained in thier mind that if you work for an IT company, then you are a programmer.     Frankly saying, it was this attitude of people that made me decide not to work in the IT industry as a programmer. I don't want to be one of the thousands of  nameless, faceless  people programmers in the IT industry, who are just content in developing the code for an application. Most of them don't get a chance to expand thier horizons. They are mostly satisfied in thier job role. They start as programmer trainees and move up the corporate ladder as maybe a programmer, senior programmer, team or project leader. Very few break the invisible ceiling into the top management. They get stuck into mostly the lower middle or middle management.    A few of my programmer friends might get a little upset over the above statements, but it is the truth. Coming back to jobs in the IT industry, as said earlier there are lots of other jobs that are paramount for any IT company. Web Designers, Multimedia Artists, Marketing, System Administrators, Technical Writers, Customer Support, Administration &amp; Support, System Analyst, Visualizers, Interaction/Information Designers and still a lot of technical designations I cannot remember.    By the way, my job profile includes:   1) Developing content for websites, multimedia cds, marketing collaterals (includes brochures, flyers etc.)  2) Editing the company's monthly newsletter  3) Act as company's spokesperson to the outside world(through newsletters, emailer campaigns, company marketing collaterals etc.- According to my CEO)  4) Prepare user manuals for software applications (Currently, I have not involved myself in this aspect, but will do so very soon)     Bye,    Jax.  Kicha:  Send me Rajesh's and Ganesh's email ids. Tell them about the unofficial rules of the blog.

      Hei guys, you all have made me feel my day special in different ways.   By this simple and elegant wish Jax conveyed me wishes which is one of the unique wish i got today though he had sent me his gift in the form a story already!.  I liked the way Kishore, made attempts to catch me over phone to wish me though he had mailed me his wishes!   when i was waiting for Ram's wish, (the only blogger left) he came out with a most stunning card! Ya a card which carried Mother's message. How sweet!! I was really impressed. I was carried away by the sincerity with which he visited the site which i used to visit almost daily and decide before hand itself to send me a card with Mother's message on my birthday. Thank you guys. Its all your wishes and wishes from those who remembered me today made me to write yet another tale inspite of my days work. Ya All in a day's work is now becoming a part of my day's work.  Everyone's wish is as unique as they are and so do they mean a lot to me as they are very personalised and carry hearty wishes.  Ok then here is today's update!  My beloved gave me a beautiful gold pendant which has a cute hanging pearl swinging and waving to all who look at my chain! Nice it looks ya. He also gave me a bouquet of roses and a beautiful card! I love them all very much.Morning before going to office i went to srini's place, I got blessings from him! Then he took me to Domlur Perumal temple and did Archanai. After breakfast he dropped me at my office. In the evening we all (my cousin sis and her family )are planning to go to srini's house and then for dinner. I am feeling so happy today. but your greets has really heightened my spirits!    Sinoop called me yesterday evening & wished me. Then kavi also called me up. I got greetings from vinitha, ganesh and rajesh. Then ya, Rajesh, Ganesh and Manny called me up just few minutes back. It was nice talking to them. Ya one more thing to be noted here is , Manny could not attend my Betrothel because he had been to Pune for Kanbays software interview ( which i absolutely believe) and Ganesh could not attend coz, he had been to attend Microsoft interview at Silicon Valley and rajesh could not attend it as he had an interview at Singapore it seems. So i have asked the corresponding travel tickets for their proof! Krishnaaaaaaaaaa  US and Singaporea kaapathu.    Ok then will update all my events of later part of the day sometime later.  Till then  Cares and shares  Ranjini

         A very happy birthday to Ranjini!!    I wanted to send you a greeting card but I didn't know your address. Ok I thought I'll send you an e-card. But what to do, my system was being upgraded to Win2k. So I had no access to the Internet. All this was yesterday. I thought of going to a browsing centre to do the same. Alas, being a lazy guy had its privileges. On my way home, I ran into a couple of neighbours who wanted to play cricket. That's all, my plans of the going to an Internet cafe vanished like my last ball six into the nearby bushes.    I thought well I have time till today morning. My system doesn't seem to like Win2k at all. It took an immediate dislike to the OS and started to restart (What an irony!). Well it is almost 3 in the afternoon when things have been going on smoothly between the OS and the system.     So, here are my wishes to you,       "You are always my friend;   When I am happy or when I am sad,   When I am along or when I am with people.  You are always my friend,  If I see you today   Or if I see you a year from now, If I talk to you today   Or if I talk to you a year from now.   You are always my friend,   And though through the years we will change,   It does not matter what you do.   Throughout our lifetime   You are always my friend. "    Bye,  Jax.    P.S. Ram &amp; Kicha , Get my treat also from Ranjini.

      Hi,     7 days back I was right. I expected this weekend to be different and so it was. As rini told, it was a refreshing morning walk and its been quite a while that I went to a temple as early as we went on that day. Thanks to rini I made it after a looong time. And yes... quite a few gossips about rini's and my life but the best of it was the big lecture she gave me on the flowers at the road-side and at the end of it all said "I know I'm boring u... but what will u do if ur girl has a curious taste and keeps pestering u by talking about that... so, take some practice" ...   Might just be a question of time before I realise how true rini's words were...  Spent the rest of saturday washing and snoozing... come sunday, and started early (again) to ramgopal's house to meet bala and by afternoon we had met Kavitha who's settled with a PG accomodation in BTM layout, not far from my house.   Then we walked and walked and walked and drank pepsi and walked and drank pepsi and in between had Kavitha's treat and walked until we settled down in a park for an hour or so...   then Kavitha left and we 3 walked and walked and drank pepsi and walked... and then I went home and slept and now I have a severe headache... I already filled up my stomach with some hot doses of coffee... still I need a good night's sleep today to get back to my usual self.  Kicha

      Hi guys, here is my weekend tale!   Yes this saturday, i dint do anything special except for getting tired of seeing Lord of Rings Twin tower. I felt sleepy at the end of first CD itself. So dint watch the rest of the movie. Morning i met kicha and had a nice time with him walking along 80 ft. road and enjoying, the morning sun and trees fully loaded with  summer flowers with gossips about the happenings of kicha's and my life! Then he waved off and i trodded to srini's place. Ya i forgot to tell u guys, i did add two more members to my pretty fresh and frolic flowers family. One more rose this time. No not yellow, not red. Its a different pink. Then one more omam plant which is a medicinal herb. Wish them to grow well.    Hei that yellow bud of which i was talking, it has grown, but not so beautifully. I wish it was beautiful, like the first offset. But nay it dint grow as good as that. No probs, it is yet to give me so many beautiful blossoms! So i will wait for those moments.    Then i got back to hostel in the evening and washed a load of clothes and retired to bed early.   Next day as usual we went early in the morning to take a fresh view of Lord Krishna and Radhe at ISKCON. Wow so fresh in pink, just the same color of the rose which i had bought yesterday! Then came back home and did prayer and then i went to my cousin brother's place. Srini went to his friend's place and promised to join me in the evening at my brother's place. We had a great time chatting and bulling each other!  So did my weekend go.   And yes guys, i am now been offered more responsibility than before and we are to accomplish our targets. So i wont be updating blogs as frequently as i do now with big tales.   Bye for now  from  Ranjini

      Hi friends, More of musical wave on our blog. Nice to listen.  Hei ram, i tried to download that hotbar, but i couldnot coz i dont have rights. So couldnot enjoy using it.  And ya i dint tell u people right, i got a call from Sinoop yesterday after a long time. He wanted to hear my voice and to check if i am still at bangalore. So he called me up it seems. How funny. Then to my surprise, i caught rajesh online. I was logged on to msgr from my friend's system and so could not chat. So asked him to send mails and had a nice time with him for a while with relay of emails. Then in the evening, Rajesh and Ganesh called me up and we had a nice conference over phone and it was nice sharing some fun with them. Those two fellows, keeping me online, started fighting over phone about who is the hard worker. It was nice to learn that Ganesh is working hard starting from the near by park in the morning and ending at Valluvar kottam in the afternoon and then in the evenings at each tea stall, coz his uncle would shout at him if he comes back soon before 9 o clock. And rajesh toh, is rated at the best hardworker with his scedule from morning to evening at his bed in his room. So will all the fun, the conversation ended and so do my mail.  Ok then guys, now off for the weekend. Cares and shares  Ranjini

      Hi,     "When the eyes start to listen the ears begin to see" ...  Yup... ramg is right... western (MJ and Shakira likes) are entirely different from yesudass etc of India... but there r others also ... Elton John, Beatles, Bryan Adams and the young ones like Charlotte Church - these people are to western what yesudass is to Indian.  I still can't forget the song "Voice of an angel" by Charlotte Church.. really her voice is like an angel's... but I couldn't get that song after that anywhere... (jax, note down...)  Kicha

      Hi Buddies....  fine, and very happy today... Rini, myself also wants to go to concert etc... But it becomes unfeasible most of the times... my Grandpa used to go for every Concerts, he can.... at times I have also joined him during my school days..  yeah, jax, when u say music (western & classical) can be one and the same... but when u say song.....(western.... Michael Jackson, Shakira..etc...) r entirely different from Indians (yesudas etc....)  yesterday I saw a superb fantastic classical musical film (only 2 CD's till. one more CD I have to see today...) all r waiting for the name... know...  Its 20th century fox production "The sound of Music" superb yeah.. ultimate story, well designed...  "Rodgers & Hammerstein...." Hope Jax would have seen it earlier...  By way have a look at this site... Fantastic one...., "www.hotbar.com"...  nothing more, update u later... bye take care... Ram

      Hi everyone,    Atleast Ranjini got a chance to go to a music concert, that too a classical music concert.Here I am at Coimbatore longing for a chance to listen to any music, while at Bangalore, Ranjini is having a whale of a time in music.     It is good to see that classical music is being appreciated by people still. But the following I think has dwindled over the years. You don't find people arriving in droves to classical music concerts.     I understand that young people nowadays find it very hard to relate to classical music, whether it is Indian or western. I am at times tearing my hair in frustration about the terms used in the music. Those alaapanas, keerthanas in Indian music, the adagios, the da capos in western classical music make my head spin at times.     Somehow Indian classical music has been brought to the common people by the movies. People can now realize that a song is in Bhairavi or kalyani ragam. But modern film music has become unhearable. Personnaly I feel that about 10 or 12 good songs are released every year out of a possible 500-600 film songs.     Ignorant people may say that this is mainly due to western influence. That is total crap. Anyone who knows his keerthanas from the alaapanas will disagree. Western Classical music has been a great inspiration to many of our modern musicians. Notice I say Western Classical&nbsp; music, not westernised music. The modern music has no connection with the original classical music per se.    Music as everyone will agree has no languages or boundaries. If you are able to listen and appreciate music, you will be able to listen and appreciate music in its various forms, whether it is in sanskrit, urdu or swahili.     I think I have been talking a lot about music. I love music.period.     Coming to my weekend, It is too early I know but what else to do.      Thursday :    Evening: Got to go to the church. Today is Maundy Thursday or Holy Thursday. For Christianity, the next three days form the crux of the religion. The coming Thursday, Friday &amp; Saturday are called as "Triduum" meaning the three great days.     I will be again back at the church for a prayer late night.      Friday :  Good Friday . Will be on leave. Have to go to the church around 11 am.      Saturday:  My leave has not been sanctioned. So will have to come to office on Saturday. I am planning to ask for half a day's leave.   Evening: Got to go to the church in the evening and again later at midnight for Easter Mass.     Sunday :  Easter Sunday . Morning mass @10 am. Heavy lunch at home. Visit friends and relatives. &nbsp;  &nbsp;  These are my expected lines for the weekend.    See you on Saturday morn or Monday morn,      Jax.

      What to tell about the concert! Hei have you tasted Lord Rama? Ya u would have , had u come to the concert, on hearing the most beautiful song on Rama. It was quite a different experience for me. I could imagine u guys wondering about what this friend of urs is talking about! Hei guys, it was an excellent evening for me yesterday. Can u believe i went to attend Nithyashree's Carnatic Music concert which was held on the occasion of Rama Navami. Wow i cant believe it. Till yesterday morning i dint think i will go. coz kicha had sent me the schedule earlier and so though i was interested, i thought i wont be able to go coz srini wont get time to accompany me. All the time, yesterday morning i was thinking, 16th falls on friday and so srini will have leave and will take me for sure to nithya's concert . But oh what a pity it was wednesday yesterday. And i was like totally in an abyss of sorrow. But in the afternoon, i was so driven that i decided to go to concert even if srini doesnt come coz one of my colleague's house is very near to the place of concert and she said she will accompany me too inspite of taking me to that place. wow i decided to go for it and planned well. Well planned we set out for the concert. Reached the venue, Got tickets and went inside!    So many things were like new, odd and different. First thing was the punctuality. At the stroke of 6.30(the time at which the concert is supposed to start), the concert started and we dint have any kind of hassles in getting seated also. no push wush and not any kind of indecent people around, so calm, so matured were everyone. I felt they had come fully prepared to enjoy the concert with a poise and serene mind. So no hungama which I am seeing for the first time. Even applause were musical u know. Not too jarring but properly admiring the work of the artiste. Overall I liked it. The saddest part is I could not enjoy it full. The concert went till 9.30 but i had to leave at 8 as it will take atleast an hour or so to reach my place and i have to be inside hostel at any cost before 9. Even shobha (my colleague) who accompanied me for name sake was carried over by the atmosphere and "Oh rama nee naama entha ruchi" song!    Ok back to the concert! I could listen to 6 songs with aalapanas and thani avarthanams in between. Those who dont know much about grammar of CMusic, never mind these terms coz i too am not good at explaining what those mean!. No wonder I wasn't able to see Nithya from my place though we had bought costliest ticket. Coz we went just before the concert started, we dint get seats near by but it was not visibility but audibility which mattered a lot and it was quite audible. One difference I could make out was, in cassette, the voice of the artist dominates and not the instruments, but yesterday I could see the mridangam artist was overpowering or I don't know how to tell. I mean her voice sounded feeble in front of that instrumental sound. So that alone I was not able to digest. Even other instrumentalists were coping well but not that mridangam. May be becoz I am hearing it for the first time it might have sounded so too. Actually that's y I think, I dint feel the same as what I had heard it in cassette, while hearing live that "Swagatam Krishna " song, my most favourite of all.    Oh how I wished she sang  "Evarura ninnu veena" song, another song on Lord Rama, a beautiful composition by Thiagaraja and our(mine and srini's) favourite. But to my dismay she dint till I left. how sad! But she started with one of my favourite "Ekambresa naayike" song. I was carried away with that song itself. First song and one of my favourite ,in such a mellifluous voice. No guys u need to experience that rather than trying to catch the essence in words. Then she came up with some more songs in Telugu. Though they were good, due to language barrier i could not enjoy much. And i was loosening my focus. And i was waiting when she will sing my favourite with an anxiety coz i never knew if she would sing or not. but then when my interest was slowly fading, she came up with Swagatham krishna song. Oops enna voice! How nice it was!     Wow song after song, she was improving and so were the audiences straightening their bends and preparing themselves to enjoy the forthcoming delights. when the song was over, we could see Lord kirshna rejoicing his welcome like anything! Then came another telugu/kanada/sanskit song. Again other language song. Which was also i could enjoy a bit coz of same language barrier. But by the time it was 7.45. I dint feel like going. And waited for one more song. And my wait was worthwhile and so was my visit to the concert! It was a master piece. Yes , It was a beautiful song on Lord Rama! It goes like "Oh rama nee  naama entha ruchi, emi ruchi" meaning how sweet and tasty your name sounds............. Wow classic ! Now got what i had meant in my first lines of this blog page? Ya mouth watering and tasty concert!    Then it was 8 and i have to depart the place with full of music. My god, great is this music.One more thing was though I dint understand the language or the song, still it was good!! Oops another small piece, its ok guys, hope u will enjoy this too!

      Hei guys , i got the snaps which i had taken at hostel and at my workplace and with srini at his place and the ya at so many other places.  Nice they are. It will take time for me to scan them and post to u people. So wait for some more time to have a look at those ok. Hei i have taken snaps of srini too in dhoti. Its all looking so good. And ya i went to ISKCON yesterday as planned and had a nice darshan of Krishna and radhe, though it was too crowded over there. Then hurried back home and on the way gave the sweets sent by mom to srini's cousin as srini hadnt returned from office. Hei he is working now late hours to finish his project and so we are not meeting daily as we used to before. How sad! Anyway i do have other works to be done as my cousin sis and her family had turned up.    I think i had told kicha and ramgopal that i have kept some flowering plants at Srini's place. For jax, here is the list of plants i have. One red rose, one yellow rose, one white chrysanthemum, one red chrysanthemum, one pink bougainvilla, one blue jacaranda(a creeper which showers off flowers like anything during its flowering season), One beautiful red hibiscus, two red button roses, two lavender(ornamental plants), one juniper(another ornamental plant) and one marigold which shed off fully as its season was over few days back but fully flowered with its golden flowers before shedding completely. Hmmmmmm almost a dozen pots or so.     All plants used to grow well and give flowers to enchant us every now and then but not those two roses which were my darlings. But yellow rose, my most favourite hasnt given even a single bud till now, nor has the red one, srini's favourite. But you know yesterday it has given a bud it sems. woweeeeeeeeeee ........ Cant u guys see me jumping............ Ya i was totally filled with joy and merrying in my office when he told me this news over phone yesterday. Good na. After almost say 6 months this is the first bud i am encountering.    When i bought them i always had a fear that after the buds it had when we bought , the chances for the plants to survive will be very less and so were the plants behaving. I was feeling so sad and when ever i used to water them, usually on saturdays and sundays, i used to feel so bitter about them. coz i was so upset looking at a plant which pressed my heart coz it was not flowering. Actually there were one buds each in both plants when we bought and they bloomed in a weeks time and then withered away. But then they never came back again with another one when i was eagerly waiting for that delight. But now....... the wait is over. Wish i had a camera to preserve it blossom. I will take one full role on it. How desparately i would have waited for it u know. And thats what is making me to write such a big blog page. Sorry if i have bored u with all those words. Hope i havent coz i know its a small piece of sharing my sweet joy with u my dear friends!  Bye for the day  Cares and shares  Ranjini

      Hi,     Back from today's quota of my training in BizTalk Server. Had a short chat with kavi in the morning as she was rushing into the hall for her 2nd day and I was moving rather sedately (as I always do...) to my training lab...  Another of those routine days... but I guess this weekend could just be a bit different than the 2-men show of me and ramgopal all these days here. With Kavitha coming into the picture and Bala also having some plans to come to BLR this weekend for some work... and with Kavitha's treat still pending... it all seems to be all set for a juicy, slurpy weekend... lets atleast hope so...  about the sites I visit daily...  1. rediff 2. yahoo  3. hotmail .......for all my mailing needs  1. msdn 2. gotdotnet 3. google ......for all my programming needs  1. cricinfo 2. scores.sify ......for all my cricketing needs  and of course, "sparsh" - the Infosys intranet ...

      Bon jour mes amis,    So, Rini has started on the greatest adventure - house hunting. You can learn a lot of things when you go on a search for a house. You find that there are things which you have taken for granted in the past are now hard to come by. The most interesting thing about house hunting is meeting people, all types of people (interesting and dull).     Ranjini, visit these links for info:      urlLink http://www.onlinebangalore.com/hous/reupdate/thumbrul.html     urlLink http://www.koramangala.com/korabuz/rentals.htm       One week left for your birthday and diid you get my points on your comments?      Yesterday was a holiday, one of the 9 official holidays in my company. Here is my weekend.     Sat : just working - evening choir practice     Sun : Every year, we have a "samapandhi" at our church (Sunday preceding Easter). WE used to help in setting up of the tables and chairs and serve food, first to the poor and after that to other people in the church. This is not like the annadhanam given in temples, but more of a communal lunch. Had a good time. Got tired by the time I sat down for lunch. As one of the member in the 'serving' committee, got a lt of vadais than others. Went back home at 3 pm. and watched the Ind-SA match.    Around 6 pm, went to leave my suister at Namakkal, The buses I got into were one of the slowest of the lot. Finally reached Namakkal at 10:30. Went to my uncle's house. After dinner, watched the highlights of the Brazilian Grand Prix. It was interesting to watch people just crash out. Luckily no one got hurt.      Mon :  Tamil New Year day  - Got up early, got ready to leave to Coimbatore. I usually don't have breakfast on holidays. Did the same and later realized what a fool I was. Got down at Erode for breakfast. On checking my pockets, found that I had practically no money other than for the bus ticket. After rummaging through my pockets,&nbsp; found that I had over 30 Rs. of change alone. Had a orange juice and bought an Aquafina and got into the bus. My sister had told me about this bus. very fast and no stopping on the way. Got into the front row seat, just behind the gear shaft. Wonderful view of the road. made it to Coimbatore in no time.    Coming home, found my house locked. After some time, my brother came. Took rest the entire evening playing Age of Empires. Also watched "Raiders of the Lost Ark" - interesting film.      Tue : back at office - reading three day's mails and&nbsp; -- typing this...    Ciao,    Jax.      BTW: anybody seen Saddam Hussein and his Weapns of Mass Destruction?? If yes, please inforn Bush and Blair. poor guys, been searching for him for the past one month.

      Dear Friends,  s ofcourse, me tooo go with kicha's view.... if you c & watch carefully, kicha's views are pretty very much clear like crystal... from the way of expression right now we use in our mails and blogs,  and the mode of conveying ideas/frustrations during difficult situations thru mails and speech....  Yeah, coming to my weekend, thought of washing on sat and sun to office... But... I slept very well in saturday that I postponed washing for sunday early morning.... But Saturday myself and uncle went for purchase... had a very gr8 deal of purchase at commercial...  Sunday slept rather less than saturday... but too its late for my office.. So I cancelled my weekend visit to office... and washed, cleaned our house for the vishu....got fruits etc.. kept infront of deepam...  today morning got up by 5.55 am... had a nice dharshan at Ayappa, Rama, Ganesha & Murugan temple... Finally finishing pooja at home and blessings from uncle,  Went to Cousins home and showered blessing for my neice.... Back to office.. and had some work... now a little bit free...  Cheers Ram

      Hi friends,  Fine na. This weekend, i took a step into an all time adventure. Ya i did a bit of cooking. Ofcourse nor did i  do it fully. We went to ISKCON on suday and then to one of Srini's friends place. There his friend  and we felt it would be better if we could cook and eat. So i too got into the field with full josh,  though landed up peeling and cutting onions with my eyes and nose watering.. We prepared tomato rice  I dont know exactly the frying and mixing in proper proportion part, so i restrained myself from doing the same.  Else it would have been a plate of relatives of charcoal when all people come to quench their hunger.  But then as his friend's wife was there and though she is not an expert, she did manage well and it was a nice  experience  for me too. The taste was ofcourse good my dear friends and ya it also gave me confidence that soon i will learn to cook well! Hei growing more responsible than before right!   So i do accept kicha's views.     The day before we were on house hunt in Koramangala area in scorching sun, though it turned out to be a  beautiful evening coz od the climate change.We dint get any accomodations of our likes and hopes and so  returned empty handed.  Hei guys at bangalore, u can help me out in these i beleve, Ya if u people come  across any houses in Koramangala with rent   The house if its a new one then its perfered.    Hei jax i will mail u about ur reply mail. And ya i think i might go to those bookshops and i had been recently  just a week before Had u told me before i would have gathered info by now. But never mind, i will let u know  when i go there. But its not for sure in near future. i mean i will go by next month only. Will u wait till then or is  it urgent. And if u tell me any particular audio book then i can enquire about that book exactly.   Ya lets welcome kavi to join in our blog!   Hei guys i dint tell u na, that i bought a new dress at last for my birthday. Ya i was like feeling i will forget   my bday, coz of therate at which i was interested in it. But then i landed up buying a short top in some green color.  Will get the dress today afteralteration and let you people know tomorrow how it looks.    "Iniya Tamil Puthaandu nal vaalthukkal"  Have a great time  Till then   Cares and shares  Ranjini

      Hi,    Am back from home.  First a BIG sorry to jax for not calling him... in fact, I couldn't call anybody this weekend. Got a bit tied-up with some resposibilities. Interesting to watch the twists and turns of life, just a few months ago we were lads and now of all, we r men and women...   I got a first-hand feel of what it feels to be a responsible "man" and an indication of sorts of how things are going to be in a few years from now.   Long Live Life ...!!!!  Expecting call from Kavi. She might be here by now and into the training hall. Just learnt that their training is going to be in UNIX to start with...   yeah jax, may be u can again send the link to the groups and may be they can have a look at what has been going on and people who are online for a reasonable part of the day can be welcome to be part of us.

      Bon Jour ,    Finally, I am able to view the blog page once again. Found out a easy way to post to the blog, "Remote editing".&nbsp; Just trying the feature out. This feature will allow you to edit posted messages directly from the blog. No need to visit blogger.com. This is very useful , if you find you had made some typo or not linked an url.     Ranj, did you receive my reply about your comments on the story?    Ram, what happened to Manny?     I feel that we should promote the blog more. Anyway, Kavitha would be joining us. If any of our friends are on the net most of their time, we can ask them to join also. your thoughts?? I wanted to put a message to the group about this, but first wanted to know your thoughts on the matter.     BTW, if any of you visit a big bookshop like higginbothams or landmark, please ask if they have audio books for sale. Audio books are books recorded as audio cassettes or audio cds, sometimes even as mp3s. If they have any, could you inform me about the average prices?    Just hoping this weekend goes as per expected lines.    Bye,  Jax.

      Hi,       Yesterday was an interesting day. It went on as interestingly as it started. Infy's results were announced. Even though it had achieved company projections... the market analysts expectation was not reached.  Furthermore, the forecast for next year that infy gave was 12-14% while the market expected it to be around 20-25%... and the resultant...  market shattered... infy lost more than 1000 bucks in a single day, ie., over 25% lost... and ended at Rs. 3049    for ramgopal's query, Hughes s/w lost over 11% and ended at Rs.179  Not just that... almost every tech company lost more then 10-15% and Mastek led the way by losing 49% and ended at Rs.285      yesterday that was the talk of everyone... now I really understand the worth of our MS(IT&M) course. Even though all around me were discussing shares and businesses I was atleast able to figure out what all the fuss was about and could chip in with some sensible inputs to them.  I usually keep a slender track of the markets ever since the day I started reading BusinessWorld (to be more precise, from March 2002). Now my interest is only increasing...     and am going home today. heard that vijay babu is coming to mdu to collect his cert. Hope to meet him. and jax, will call u saturday night or sunday morning... and be back here on monday morning...    Kicha

      Hi friends,    Yesterday, had nothing to do except sit around waiting for something or someone to call me. Nothing turned up. My sister wanted to watch a movie. So while waiting for dinner, I went out to the video shop. On the way back, bought a Digit magazine (100 Rs. gone down the drain).     Watched "Manasellam". Ordinary story with illness, flashback. Tamil cinema has nowadays become very predictable. I can predict the start of a song, a fight sequence, or why even the next dialogue to a second (maybe plus or minute a couple of milliseconds).     One thing I liked about this movie was its ending, albeit on expected lines, something that I have always believed in. Over the past couple of years, these type of climaxes have become commonplace. Trisha was more or less a leaner Jothika (same voice dubbing, gestures and body language). Srikant, better than previous films, but same old beard style. Most of the film, he seems to be wearing the same dresses. Our stunt master have gotten over the Matrix effect. The slo-mo and the instant action scenes have now become irritating.     Ranjini, what happened to Hariharan? Forgot him?     I have almost stopped listening to music. My cassette player has gone kaput. I don't get CDs (expensive). Most of all, no time at all to listen to music. At work, not much of music aficionados here. At times, can hear a few English songs wafting in the air.     As I am composing this, Richard Marx's version of  urlLink "I can't help falling in love with you"  was running in one of the multimedia systems.&nbsp; Elvis Presley had originally sung this song. With his wonderful voice, it brought to mind emotions of beaches and walking along it with your loved one. One of my favourite songs, this song has appeared in the movie "Speed 2: Cruise Control". That song was by a British pop group, UB40.     Now, the original version of Alaipayuthey has taken over the air, not the song in the movie, but the original version by..... I don't know who.     Bye,  Jax.

      Hi,      Today, the morning was different. I stepped out of my bed amidst the darkness (there was no current) into the meeting room where I usually have a meeting every morning to answer all the questions posed by nature, only to find that the tap blew out air - No water in the tank...and no current to switch on the motor.   I had to forcefully postpone my meeting with nature. It was not until 7AM that the current came and then rushed in to meet and went on to successfully answer all of nature's questions as I do everyday and made here some 30 mins later than usual...  rini venturing into Greek stories... I'm not patient enough to read stories... but very patient enough to listen if somebody is patient enough to tell it out...  Today is April 10th... and by late afternoon, Infy's 2002-03 4th quarter results will be out... anxious to learn how we've fared in this not-so-good economic climate...  Kicha

      Hi friends,  Yesterday as i was free i happened to read whole of "Perseus the Deliverer". the story of which i have already published before. It was a classic piece.   Especially the Character of Cassiopea who is the queen of Syria and mother of Iolaus(friend of perseus) and andromeda  (lady love of perseus) is one of the best portrayed character in the play.   U should see the dialogues delivered by her when she finds that her golden stressed iolaus is going to be slained..... She becomes so fierce and with the will and inteligence of a queen and heart of a mother, she stands for her son. Ok i cant just like that express what i have relished in mere words. So let me stop with this.      Hei i did buy one casette yesterday too. Its called Sarvasri by Balamurali krishna.  I listened to it when i went to bed. Wow so soothing is the music on Lord Ganesha.  But will be very good to listen as the day starter as Ganesha is the beginner of all deeds!   Oh, but the pitiable part is the quality of casette is not good and i need to exchange it for a new one.   Inspite of that i enjoyed listening to the music.  This is the first time i am listening to his voice.   Its also good. We bought two more casettes by Sanjay Subramaniam whose musical voice we both enjoy like anything.   one is Kalyani and the other is Ashwaththa i believe. Once Srini has had the delight of listening,   i am planning to relish too. Till then got to wait!   Ok guys see u later. Cares and shares  Ranjini

      Hi Jax,   Thanks I have done so... and also have asked manny to do the same...   Whether its necessary one of the Mozilla's window should be kept open for this alert...  Anyway I have quick launcher at my desktop  Nothing more bye  yeah.... blog page is looking good.. Can u place the boquet I inserted in the blog near the members pane  bye   RamG

      Dear Ram,     Friday is too soon. I was expecting it to be ready by Monday. Then the only option is let Manny prepare a rough draft of the paper. Ask him to mail it to my personal id. I'll go through, make necessary corrections, changes etc and mail it back to him.    For your mozilla query, open  urlLink  the blog  in Mozilla and bookmark it. Then go the  B ookmarks menu and click on  M anage  B ookmarks... Right click on the newly created bookmark and click on  P roperties. Go to the  S chedule tab and set it according to your preferences. The  N otify tab can be used to alert you whenever the page has been modified.&nbsp; Though this feature is very useful, it gets a little annoying at times, whenever an alert pops up.     Everyone, check out the new   Members   link at the left hand side. Your comments and suggestion for utliizing the space effectively are welcome.&nbsp;     The small subscription box on the right is for those who want to receive updates made to the blog through email. If anyone, say Ganesh, wants to know whether there are any new posts to the blog, he can subscribe using the form. He will then be receiving mails about the updates to the blog through emails.    As I had mentioned earlier, please use the &lt;br&gt; tag to seperate sentences. As you all can see all the posts appear as a single para. Use the HTML knowledge we learnt at MS(IT&amp;M) atleast now.    Bye,    Jax.

        Dear Ram,   Regarding your query for Manny, I would like to have some info before proceeding. What the hell is dynamic binding and how is it related to C, C++, and Java. I am not that much technically sound. Maybe if you or manny could help me by suggesting a few pointers (not the one in C &amp; C++) on the topic, maybe some sites where you can get information.     Since I need some time to prepare it, it would be really helpful if you or Manny collect just the rough information and mail me (to my personal id). I'll try my best. Don't reply to my office. Any urgent message, blog it, I'll read it and reply asap.     Kicha, the answer to your question " The man was a very short man. He could reach only upto the button for fifth floor. On rainy days, he would be having his umbrella. Using it, he can press the button for the tenth floor." I feel that we can use the blog for these type of interactions instead of mailing. We have got the technology, so I feel that we should make use of it more often.     Ram: Sorry for not replying earlier to your query, which version of mozilla did you download? I know you are using Win2k OS.   Bye,   Jax.

      Hi all,    I think that the problem is that the line breaks were not converted into &lt;br&gt; tags. I feel the best option is to insert the line breaks manually. So as you have got admin rights, you can edit your posts and insert the tags manually. If it is a problem from Blogger's end, then we will have to wait for them to rectify it.     Ranjini, I guess you have taken to reading a lot nowadays. Why, having a lot of free time? As you had said, the Greek mythology is one of the most interesting and also the most intriguing mythologies. No offense meant, but I feel that that it is better than the Indian ones. The entire greek mythology is available online. Bartleby is a very good source. Personally I really love the Odyssey by Homer the most.     BTW what was Kicha meaning by Ranjini being cruel to her friends. What is Ranjini going home to Madurai or spending the entire day with Srini, which of these two scenarios will it be?    To view images, it is important the image be referenced by an url, a file path would not suffice.    That's all folks, bye,    Jax.

      Hi friends,  Ranjini had mailed me about blogger scrolling. Sorry i had nothing to do with it. Will try and see if anything can be done to rectify this. It might be a problem at blogger's end.  Also as blogger is providing a free hosting space in its domain, we are allotted only one page space. That's why we are not allowed the facility of uploading images, Ranjini.  If we require the option of uploading images onto the blog, we have buy some space. For more information, read the FAQ.  Rini, your cooments on the story are appreciated. I'll mail you later about them. I had just come in when I recieved your mail.  BTW, I got an increment of 1K yesterday.   Bye, Jax.

      Hi friends, i like stories esp. greek ones as they are full of fantasy and their names are different and at the same time beautiful. To name few, i came across some names like andromeda, poseidon, perseus, cireas, athene, danae, zeus, cassiophea, phineus and so many. Hei all these are names from a legend called "perseus". We could see that we are using these words like andromeda-name of a constellation and Athene - athens, poseidon - name of a building which i have come across somewhere in bangalore. When i encounter some words which are attractive and beautiful, i found it to be greek most of the times. Inspite of the people even greek names are also beautiful right! Yes they are quite attractive i beleive. Even those legends are quiet interesting to read u know. Do you want to read one where in i encountered all these names? come on walk with me, just a small paragraph ahead will tell u a nice story!  *********************************************************************************************************************************************************************  ACRISIUS, the Argive king, warned by an oracle that his daughter�s son would be the agent of his death, hoped to escape his doom by shutting her up in a brazen tower. But Zeus, the King of Gods, descended into her prison in a shower of gold and Dana� bore to him a son named Perseus. Dana� and her child were exposed in a boat without sail or oar on the sea, but here too fate and the gods intervened and, guided by a divine protection, the boat bore her safely to the Island of Seriphos.  There Dana� was received and honoured by the King.  When perseus had grown to manhood the King, wishing to marry Dana�, decided to send him to his death and to that end ordered him to slay the Gorgon Medusa in the wild, unknown and snowy North and bring  to him her head the sight of which turned men to stone.  Perseus, aided by Athene, the goddess of Wisdom, who gave him the divine sword Herpe, winged shoes to bear him through the air, her shield or aegis and the cap of invisibility, succeeded in his quest after many adventures.  In his returning he came to Syria and found Andromeda, daughter of Cepheus and Cassiopea, King and Queen of Syria, chained to the rocks by the people to be devoured by a sea-monster as an atonement for her mother�s impiety against the sea-god, Poseidon.  Perseus slew the monster and rescued and wedded Andromeda.    ________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________  Hope u all enjoyed reading! the story of medusa, we had studied during our high school period. So it would have been a nice refresher i believe for those who had learnt it already.  FYI Nike means "God of victory" in greek and Athene is "Goddess of Wisdom".  Ok guys will see u later  till then  Cares and shares Ranjini

      Dear all,      Uploading images :   You cannot insert images that are present in your hard disk or internal network. The image has to be online. I repeat it has to be a image that can be referenced as an url (i.e. www.somedomain.com/images/image.gif). If you find a image that you really like and want to share, right click on it to locate its location and insert that path as the source in the image tag. If you are accessing sites that require authentication, there are chances that the image might not get displayed in the blog. But you can check that out by copying the image's url and pasting it in the browser. If the image gets displayed, fine. If not, forget it.    &nbsp; Editing blogs :   All of you have been given admin rights by me. You can log in and check it. Please use this facility only when you have made some mistakes like wrong links or something like that. I am using it only to delete multiple blogs that you might have created by pressing post or publish twice. As I have made a facility to be updated by Mozilla every time the blog changes, I can immediately get the changes done. The blog gets checked by the browser every 15 minutes.   More news and info later,     Jax  .

      Hi everyone,    I found a way by which images can be posted. Remember, Images can be inserted only, not uploaded. To insert images into the blog post, you need to know a little bit of basic HTML.    Say, I want to insert a image into the post say a Blogger logo. All I have to do is write the post as a HTML code.   --------  &lt;p&gt;  This is a &lt;b&gt;sample test post&gt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;  This shows how you can insert images into the post&lt;br&gt;  &lt;img src="aaa" width="xxx" height="yyy"&gt;  eg.      Note:  'aaa'=source image, the actual path of the image. You can find this out by rightclicking the image you want to be posted to the blog.  'xxx'=the width of the image to be displayed.   'yyy'=the height of the image to be displayed.  --------------------------    Try it out...    Bye,  Jax.

      Hi everyone,    Ranjini seems to be making efficient use of the blog. Good going, keep it up. Ranjini, another thing, if you come across any interesting websites or articles on the web, just blog it. Just like the article of the week that you had been sending.&nbsp;     Kicha, what a co-incidence, I saw "Lord of the Rings - Two Towers" on CD for the second time Saturday night. I wanted to watch it in a theatre. But they took the movie off from the theatre this Friday.    Ram and Kicha, don't get left behind. Keep blogging. Last week, when there was a flurry of mails being sent to the groups, Ganesh had spoken to me. He did not believe that this blog was actually ours. He thought that we had ^C and ^V'ed the entries from somewhere. He said that only when he had noticewd the names at the bottom, he believed that it was us. He said that he also wanted to join. I had told him the rules: 1) Atleast more than two blogs in a week (one per day or more would be really great) 2) He would not be able to upload images( thank god, or else this blog would have become a photo gallery of Jothika).     Your comments on the above matter expected???    My weekend went as per expected lines. Saturday evening singing practice, Sunday morning church, Sunday evening practice. The only thing different this week was that  urlLink Cecilia Ohrwall  &nbsp; had come to give us a few pointers on singing. The practice sessions were totally fun and interesting. Actually today (Monday), we will be giving a small performance in the evening.     We will be singing three African songs. One song is titled "Ashikatale". You find the lyrics to this song  urlLink here  at the bottom of the page.One song is "Bele Mama". This song is a lively foot-tapping song. Another song is titled "Mwanga Ni Mwema". This song is in Swahili.     Well, I forgot to tell you all something. If this small music group takes off, we might be coming over to Bangalore to give&nbsp; a small performance. A similar group located at Bangalore will be coming over to Coimbatore to give a performance. We might be reciprocating thier visit here. So expect in Bangalore sometime in the future, but definitely within the end of 2003.    The second Gulf War is in its third week. Keeping a close watch on the developments, I found out several things. It is interesting to note that there are different versions of the same news, on by the western media and one by the eatern media. I get both versions though the western media is more prominient, CNN, BBC, NY Times... For the Iraqi version, you have  urlLink Al-Jazeera  only. Reading both versions gives one the thought that they are covering two different wars. On one, the Anglo-American forces all have but won the war. on the other, they are getting beaten black and blue.     That's all for now, keep in touch,    Jax.    Note: As I may be experimenting with the look and feel of the blog, you might get some errors accessing it. Kindly adjust. I will give prior intimation if I plan to modify it.

      This weekend, I was not in the best of my spirits. I dunno why. But I was just not feeling like myself. Imagine what cud have been the reason for a guy who NEVER sleeps in the afternoons to sleep for 5 hours at-a-stretch between 2PM and 7PM on a saturday... I'm still trying to figure that out...   Later that saturday night my house-mates called for "Lord of the rings" movie...   Imagine what cud have been the reason for a guy who SELDOM prefers to go for night-show movies to go in for the movie that night... I'm still trying to figure that out ... nevertheless, the movie was good... and I hardly slept that night after coming back from the movie. Morning got up around 6AM (after returning from the movie well past 1PM and hardly getting any sleep).... started to ramgopal's house later in the morning ... saw "Lord of the rings" again in CD at his house... and in the evening went to shiva temple behind Kemp Fort before pulling up my bermudas for the night...   so, wasn't the best of weekends... hope to have a more cheerful week ahead... and praying that my plans of going home this weekend doesn't get spoilt...

      Hey ram, thanx for complimenting me for having blogged more.   And here is my weekend tale. This time sunday was verrrrrrrrry interesting. Usually we used to go to ISKCON only around 11 o clock and come back in scorching sun. But this time, Srini asked me, "Hei r u ready to come and see the first aarthi?" I said y not, with a faint idea of knowing that it was at morning 7.15. Then having decided, we planned to move accordingly. My god i was amazed at the krishna was! He was in pure red. If there had been anything which seems so pure to me in red color, it was his dress that day. We reached early morning 7.20 though we missed the first few moments all those moments which followed were so good.Early morning i was stunned by the beauty of krishna to the extent that one second, i thought the day is also stunned seeing krishna and so eveything is immobile for a second. But all those musical dance and merriful prayers on the lrod brought me back to conscious.   One more thing happened so surprisingly. Daily i used to tell suprabhatam at hostel, but i wont be able to tell on sats and sundays. I always tried and due to my sluggish nature, and lazines of my body, i just used to sleep. But on sunday i properly pray together with srini. But anyway i used to miss my suprabhatam. But it so happened that infront of Srinivasa Govinda, they said Suprabhatham. I was totally carried away. Ah, those single bell sound after every four lines, and all of us chanting at same pace, nonstop in continuous breath, without anykind of background music, only those words which u have been telling for many days really rises something in u.   Apart from this my weekend was good as usual with srini. Today is my brother's birthday and i rang up to him to wish him. I got him a camera and he liked it a lot it seems!  Jax i havent yet started reading ur story, will pass on my comments once its done. Ok guys lots more when time permits  Till then Cares and shares Ranjini

      Ranjini,  I absolutely forgot that you are an engineer and that you had to wear uniforms. I guess I am getting a little senile nowadays. I keep forgetting simple things a lot.  But I am astounded to hear that Srini has been buying you a lot of dresses. I have to talk to him about that. If he says that you always take a lot of time to get ready to go out somewhere, it is his mistake ;-). He buys you a lot of dresses and then he complains you take a lot of time to choose a dress and get ready.  BTW  I'll send my story this weekend. I don't have it at office.   Kicha, where are the answers for the quiz that you had sent. I am eager to know the answers that the others had sent. Mail it soon.  I guess you all have been enjoying a lot of holidays at your respective concerns. I have over 60 days off for me, 52 sundays + 10 cl. Poor me!  Bye,  Jax. visit  urlLink this .

      Hei what, all u guys kidding me like anything........ This is not fair ok. I am used to wear pant shirts from the day i stepped in to my Engg. college, though i hadnt tried anything except uniform. But i think all u people must be knowing that i wear pant shirt once a week to my office too. I wear saree twice a week, chudi twice a week and pant shirt once a week. So this makes up my outfit for a week. And during weekend i always stick with Sarees on sunday as we go to temple and on sats based on the occasion i wear either Saree or Pant shirt and not chudi ok. coz he never likes chudidhars somehow.    Ya regarding a snap of me in Pant shirt, yes i have taken a snap at my office in my official wear and if it turns out nice, then i will post it to u all guys. so kicha u need not strain ur little brain with all such things and scribble on to our blog. I will send u the snaps.    And ya Srini does wear dhoti. Wonder?! Its his one of his favourite casual wear but only at home, coz unlike Madurai here none of the youngster wear dhoti and so i have restricted not to wear it outside. So apart from that, he looks majestic in the dark grey shirt with cool dark blue bootcut jean. I always prefer him in jean and so does he. He has a very good dressing sense and never lets me dress shabby as i used to do earlier. It should be a proper one, then only he will be satisfied, else i need to change. And so does he dresses too. He dresses both trendy and conventional. Both suits him properly, though i always prefer to see him in Dhoti. Infact i was the one, who got him dhoti at ISKCON. He has got me so many modern outfits, like 7 tops and 2 pants for me. But i have got him only one dhoti and one shirt till now. Planning to buy more in coming days.   Hei people, i had bought a brand new Samsung camera for my elder brother karthick for his birthday and i have taken snaps using that only. So first trial, i dont know how its going to turn out. Let me wait and see. Till then u too guys should wait .    I dint get fooled by ramgopal's first message. But the second one, the cursor play was so cute. I enjoyed it, though i had to log off to get back my cursor as my job involves working on black background and the cursor is in black color.     Hei jax, send me ur story man without fail, i think today after noon i will b a bit free. So will read and pass u comments.  Till then cares and shares Ranjini

       A new language has been developed by the Dept. of Computer Science, University of Durham, UK. Written by Edwin Brady and Chris Morris. This language is very user-friendly, doesn't contain  a  lot of syntax. Learn more about the language  urlLink here.  I guess Ramgopal can learn this program. Kicha may also find it useful for his programming. But the language may not be compatible witht the .Net platform. The only link between programs written in Whitespace and .Net is that the filename suffix are similar (.ws for Whitespace programs & .ws for Web Services written on .Net platform.  Yesterday being April Fool's day, I don't know how many of you all got be a real fool. I came across this article while browsing. It gives the  urlLink  Top 100 April Fool's Day Hoaxes of All Time .

      Ranjini,        wearing pants...????   going for movie....???????  me too like to see u in pant shirt and going to a movie...  wait...  i'm trying to imagine...  am thinking.... hard...  hard... really hard...   oh...man...  I give up...   however hard I try... its impossible for me to think that way... is it Ranjini...???  I guess, thats how gals change on accomodating their "The Guy"...   I wonder how seeni has changed after getting his "The Gal"...  has he started wearing dhoties while going out... :-)  (hee....heee.....heee.........)  and ever wonder, if seeni spends so much time in choosing what dress he wears to meet his gal... or has Ranjini ever cribbed anything to her guy on what he's wearing that day... strange happenings....   just trying to use this as a case-study ... might be useful for me in the future...  Hey Ram....!!!   (no, i've not become pious... thats the song slicing its piece of melody thru my ears...)  Kicha

      Ranjini, You in a pant shirt. Is this an April Fool's joke? I would like to see a photo. Can you arrange it?     I guess you all must be using mostly  Internet Explorer  for your browsing. But there are alternatives to IE. I am not against Microsoft products. But after using  urlLink Mozilla , I have become a fan of that browser. I wouldn't say that Mozilla is the best browser, but it has a few features that I really have come to like like tabbed browsing. Though  Netscape  is built using the Mozilla base, I feel that Netscape is resource hungry.    Mozilla has some really wonderful tools to help in blogging. A few of my earlier posts were made through those tools. The irony is that I am composing this blog using IE, not Mozilla.    In case you need any more information on Mozilla or any other browser, try   urlLink googling!     BTW, R.Sinduja's birthday is tomorrow. Right?   Jax.

      For me, the weekend was as good as it used to be. We went to Domlur chokkanatha Perumal swamy temple on saturday morning and then Srini went to office as he had to.then i came home and had a nice little nap till i was awakened by a phone call ringing and some body yelling from a far away place "ranjini call for u". I went downstairs and picked my phone with a big yawn. In a disinteresting voice i said "Hello" and the other end it was Srini.   I was surprised coz, srini said he would come back late. And calling me at 5 o clock? Then what, he said lets go for a movie and i said no way........ But what to do, will have to sacriifice all such small myths about theatres at least at this point of time na. So said ok. Ofcourse we were not sure if we would get ticket for Lord of Rings - II. He gave me just 15 mins to dress up and come out of the house and by that time he would catch a rick and wiat for me near by.   So dint know what to wear, coz morning i had dressed up my violet saree in north indian style and so if i had to go for it then it would be late. So i voted for Pant shirt. I always like the cotton boot cut which he bought me first. Its in pale white color and he had bought me an orange top for that too. But that combination i wore on friday. So was getting bugged up wearing that again.Then what, i thought for a while and remembered that he had bought me a trendy cotton top with blue embroidery.   So though i thought it wont go much with my white bottoms, i decided to pull it over. got ready soon and then rushed out. He was surprised to see me in that outfit and all these days i havent wore this top even once though he had bought me this top some 6 months back. I dint wear coz i dint have any proper bottoms for that. Really i felt it was looking good on me.   Enough of my tales, and now back to movie. Oh we went to Symphony theater and u should see the crowd ........ aaaaaaah , as we both are lone hunter, we scurried from that place as early as possible and the show was house full. So to his dismay and my joy, we dint go for movie. Then we went to commercial and bought a nice chudi material for my sis and then came back home.  So went saturday.   On sunday we both after praying, went to ISKCON temple and as i had already told kicha, its become a routine for us to pray on sunday for a while and then go and have nice aarthi of Lord Krishna at ISKCON. Then came back home and i got back to hostel in the evening.  So did my weekend go!

      Hey jax,  That was a neat trick to increase traffic to the groups...!!! But wonder, how the statistics gives Kicha's IP address and Sinduja's ISP and not Sinduja's IP address and Kicha's ISP...???  the bios are good, jax. But we can't point on our names (the link) and scroll up the page to view the bio at the same time... hope u handle this issue soon. I'm still wondering if I have to come on saturday too. My heart says NO but my mind says YES. No special plans yet for the weekend as am still not sure if its gonna be a 1-day or a 2-day weekend.   And that new feauture that I'm bringing up for past 2 days, the "Ponder of the day" ... its turning out to be more informative. But I assure u, it wont be the case everytime. I've got a good list of a few things... which seems very trifle and stupid at first glance but have something to ponder about. More in the lines of Dilbert's Management quotes.  until monday....  so..long..mates...

      Hi,  jax, that was a good journey thru memory lane... something to feel nostalgic about...  in fact, we should thank u first, for making us open to this exciting new world of blogging...   (diplomatic exchanges apart) its really opened up new ways to explore the net and great platform for knowledge-sharing (and gossip-sharing :-)  ).  and as broken at 4:23:59  ... Kavitha will be moving to Chennai Development Center next week. That'll be the end of her short saga in Bangalore... she now goes where she really belonged... (atleast I feel so)... even though she had always asked me to pray that she gets posted to BLR, I told her "I'll pray surely, but that will not prevent them from posting you to Chennai"... and the rest is history.

      This entry is about the origin and design of this blog. All links will open in a new window.   All in a day's work! - a colophon   I learnt about blogs and blogging somewhere round the middle of February. I was searching for an article for my company's newsletter. I felt it was a wonderful idea. I liked the idea of publishing to the web in a jiffy. Searching around for blogging tools, I found that I could not get into LiveJournal without an invite, Movable Type seemed superb but required a website. So, I opted for Blogger. It was free and offered free hosting. This was my only rationale in choosing Blogger.   When this blog was started in March, I never had an idea that it would be a wonderful and delightful experience. After playing with it for a couple of days, I thought it would be a wonderful idea if it could be used as a platform for various people to speak on common issues. I invited Kicha, Ram and Rini to join me. Our initial efforts were more like mails. Later on, we broadened our horizons to include all issues from personal angst to music.   The initial design was simple and colourful. The template was designed by  urlLink Andrew Hoshkiw . You can a sample  urlLink here .   Everyday brought a new fresh look and avenues for experimentation. I had tried out webcounters, subscription tools, commenting systems during the whole of March and a better part of April.   April brought me a new road to explore, Cascading Style Sheets or CSS. Till now I had seen some wonderful websites and just wondered about how people were able to create such beautiful websites. And I work in a web design company. At work, I was used to more of a image based layouts where the design preceded content. It still does. People here were just experimenting with CSS.  I then began having a good look at the designs that had attracted my attention. I noticed most of them using CSS. A Google search promptly led me to a wide range of resources on the matter. Thank God for Google.  Then what, search led to information, information transferred itself to understanding and understanding became knowledge.  By this time, we managed to pick up a few more people on the way like Rajesh, Ganesh, Sinduja, Kavitha, Valli and Vijay Babu. We had increased to ten. One more member (Sangeetha) is expected to join shortly at the time of writing.  Late April saw the blog's design being changed. This time, the bright colours were now replaced by a sombre dark purple colour. I took the layout from  urlLink wicked design . This template was based on a CSS Design. I modified this template to match the requirements of the blog. It also gave me a chance to test out the various CSS techniques I had learned. My God! What an experience that was, both interesting and strenuous.  May brought the summer with its scorching sun. The blog was also getting heated up with lots of discussions and other things going on. There came a change in the blog design once more. I found a very good simple and elegant design at  urlLink CSS Colouring Book . I have modified it to implement a lot of interesting concepts that I had learnt over the past couple of months.    By the end of May, I learnt one thing, CSS. It is really a beautiful way of expressing design. The trouble is not all web browsers support it. There seems to be a clear divide on support. If Internet Explorer supports it, Netscape and Mozilla don't. If they do, IE won't. There seems to be no common ground at all.   As I had explained earlier, I seem to be facing some very peculiar and unique faults. IE6 is supposed to support CSS. A few of the most common layouts like those designed by  urlLink Eric Costello ,  urlLink  Rob Chandanais  ,  urlLink Eric Meyer , and  urlLink  Owen Briggs  are not displayed correctly in my machine (WinMe/IE6). But they are displayed in all their glory at my office machine (Win98/IE5). Mozilla is supposed to display CSS correctly, but this blog's layout doesn't. I cannot comprehend. So, my quest for a good design continues just as this blog will.   I would really have to thank my friends, a part of this blog, who had sat there, demure and uncomplaining when I played around with the blog.   This concludes the first part of the colophon for this blog. I?ll add the remaining parts whenever I get the time.

      Kicha, what a co-incidence. I was thinking of asking the question this monday. but didn't get the time to do it. forgot about it by Tuesday morning. I read about it a couple of months back, but I don't remember the source right now. I had saved a few bookmarks now and then. Here is a couple of them. Read a short explanation  urlLink here.  Oracle (the database manufacturer) also suggests a few conventions  urlLink here .  Personally, I prefer the german style of abbreviativing number as nr, but due to easy understanding of others, it has to be written as no. Looking at it, no. also makes sense in the form of using etc. for et cetra.  Regarding the bios, that's why I'm waiting for others to tell about the other members. OR we could put in a short note by everybody. It will take up a lot of space. Need everyone's help on the matter.

      Hi,  Guess it might have been great 4-day off for Valli. I remember seeing such aquariums in Discovery Channel and National Geographic.  jax, for the short-bio, it wud be better if someone else writes for others... that way its likely to make more interesting reading...  and here's my   Ponder of the day...    Why is "number" abbreviated as "no"? When there is no "o" in number?

      After 4 great days...now again, left all alone with my computer.....On saturday, we hosted a party. Though not a formal one, i still had a lot of work that day. sunday, we spent our time shopping(just the usual grocery :-( nothing interesting!!) & bowling. There's a new Indian restaurant opened......we tried it out on sunday....the food was better than the other Indian restaurants, but all these can never match, our good old Gowry Ganga & British Bakery....On monday, we watched a couple of scary movies..."I still know what u did last summer" & "Sixth Sense".....they r older ones, but still worth watching. Especially, the sixth sense...If u have'nt watched it, i wud recommend the movie.....Tuesday, we went to Cincinnati, Ohio,  for the green card formalities.....After completing it, we went to an acquarium....The newport Acquarium, has some rare species of turtles & fishes, in it. It was like, walking inside the sea.... a wonderful experience.....There were a lot of sharks too....imagine a shark just above ur head or at a distance where his teeth cud be seen so clearly......Just a piece of glass seperating us... what wud've happened, if the glass above or below me had  broken???.....Before getting back to Lexington, we went to the Temple of Cincinnati.   hey Xavier, idea for filling out the empty space is really good.....&  abt Bastinado......i believe in ahimsa Xavier....BTW, Sangee wants to join us....she wanted some help with it.....Can u plz help her Xavier?....like how u mailed me....  My parents have now moved to Rajapalayam....My dad was promoted & transferred, a couple of months before my marraige. Since, my brother's schooling is over, my mom is moving there now....so next time i come to India, i won't have much, to do in Madurai, other than stopping for a few hrs, to visit my Grand parents & uncle...  Vijay Babu.....how was ur brother's mrg?....so ur path is cleared now, & there is'nt much time for u to become a kelavanaar (as per ur research)!!!....  bye

      Yes, Kicha. it should look great. I got up very early today morning @ 7:00 am to get this thing right. After twiddling it for about half an hour, got it ready to go. Came to office, spent some time again to check it online & implemented it.  A good thing about the blog is that I am learning new things almost everyday. Within three months, I have now become an expert copy, paste, tweak expert on CSS. Unfortunately, CSS support is lacking among browsers.   I've got a very queer problem at home. CSS stylesheets are not displayed in IE 6 (Don't whether it is not displayed in my system alone or is it an universal factor. Most experts seem to agree with me). But the same style sheets work fine at office where I have an old IE 5 browser. Can't figure out what the problem is? I guess most of you might be using IEs. So working on the blog at home is out of the question. Moving on to the next best thing in CSS, Mozilla.  I know Ram uses Mozilla. I do use it at offfice and home. IT displays CSS wonderfully. Even it has some lackings. The blog is not displayed correctly in Mozilla. Don't know why. So editing with Mozilla is again scuttled. The next thing is...  Phoenix. A derivative of Mozilla. It supports all versions of CSS exactly.   More on the design of the blog wil be continued tomorrow. My time is up for today. Please send in your bios. Bye.

      Hi,  No blogs y'day... I was expecting to read a big list... nevertheless... I was back from Mysore late last night and rushed to office as usual this morning. I didn't have access to net as we were in an auditorium the entire day y'day. I was the 3rd guy to present and the last one before a heavy lunch y'day. This time again, I used my PL's laptop to load my presentation and thankfully I remembered the connections and did not look dumb in front of around 80 people. It went on well. The best part was, due to lack of time, all people were asked to put the questions off-line ie., mail/talk to the respective people. So, nobody bothered me with questions and I need not have to look dumb for the 2nd time... And the bus dropped us at our respective places late y'day night.   Yep... Tilak has mailed... and will mail again sometime soon with the same line "it is my duty to do this even though I don't mail to the groups..."

      Hi,  Hope u would have all read my mail to msitmmb.what jax had said in the blog is 100 % true.since he is writing lots of stories i think he can view it in a clear angle. i just mentioned the name bcoz it was from a person working in infy that's all.  i do not have any other infirmation reg that person.this was all due to misinterpretation & nothing else.  for vijay, machan i do not want to send comments to ur statistics & rajesh's comments bcoz u r both "Elavatta Pasanga". iam a little bit older than that. I am an adult( not a parent & not a child) ("Appadi P.C. Shekar teachings ethukavathu use Achea") hehhehehehehe  bye

      dear vijaybabu, im very much happy to see your explanations for hybrid groups. some of them were really appreciable just like  kilavi category :valli ,sindu kilavi aaga pora category : ranjini  but one thing i cant accept is that u had given me  platform with ganesh saying that we both come under naduthara vayasu category. by this single word u had increased 10 years in my age.  for your kind information my age is now 23 and ganesh age is 32 .this is not fair and so i strictly opppose this and i hereby wants you to give a reply ststing your error to this group fainling which i may file a defamation suit on you for insulting me by putting with ganesh.  hope ull turn back ur reply soon  all things reg valli and sindhu is totally correct and i too support your words about them. (valli ku ramgopal annan aaana marmatha veliyida sollu ,ulaga maga kevalam athu)  bye raapi

      I came across this interesting piece of information from  urlLink Rediff . It is from the Indian Constitution.   Article 51A .  Fundamental Duties.  It shall be the duty of every citizen of India :  (a) to abide by the Constitution and respect its ideals and institutions, the National Flag and the National Anthem;  (b) to cherish and follow the noble ideals which inspired our national struggle for freedom;  (c) to uphold and protect the sovereignty, unity and integrity of India;  (d) to defend the country and render national service when called upon to do so;  (e) to promote harmony and the spirit of common brotherhood amongst all the people of India transcending religious, linguistic and regional or sectional diversities; to renounce practices derogatory to the dignity of women;  (f) to value and preserve the rich heritage of our composite culture;  (g) to protect and improve the natural environment, including forests, lakes, rivers and wildlife, and to have compassion for living creatures;  (h) to develop the scientific temper, humanism and the spirit of inquiry and reform;  (i) to safeguard public property and to abjure violence;  (j) to strive towards excellence in all spheres of individual and collective activity so that the nation constantly rises to higher levels of endeavour and achievement.  Are we following it in its true spirit? Your comments.

      Jax, if u watch with more precision...  R sends a forward... K says it originated in infy... G sends a forward saying it was written by one from infy... V asks why K mentioned the company name and throws up the words "infy and non-infy" and  "discrimination"... K questions why...  K's question is... why should V  take it as "discrimination" - a word which seems to be in a very bad taste for him... and demands for a clarification...

      Kicha, I don't think there is discrimination. It is more a misunderstanding. This is what I think must have happened.  Ganesh must have received a forward from someone in Infy (I don't know & don't want to know who). He forwards it to the group. He also mentions where he got it from. Vinitha reads the mail. She wonders  why the company name is mentioned and shoots off a reply to the mail. Kicha gets worried at this mail and writes another reply to Vinitha's mail. So it begins...  Ganesh has no part to play in this interaction, so leaving him out, it comes down to two persons, K & V.   V thinks G is trying to make fun of K by not refering to him by his name ( while he is not). G was just trying to give us a background information about the forward. So she thinks why should the forward's origin is given, when there are no information given for other forwards in the group.   Now K reads her mail and feels that he is 'dicriminated' against because of his company/people.    I hope by now, you would've realised that all this was caused to misinterpretation and misunderstanding. The above is just my imagination of what the problem is. It might be real or might not. Unless the concerned persons put forward their points, noithing more can be said.

       Tried accessing Yahoo! mail. I was able to get through. Here, we have a procedure, if anyone wants to access a blocked domain, we need to get it unblocked through the proper channels. Some one must have requested access to Yahoo!.   Valli, Read your mail, I understand your concerns. The same problems exists here as I mentioned earlier. I still haven't received a few cds I should have received months ago. The postal dept here also doesn't care about the items sent. I think you should use a courier service like Fedex for sending things over here. They ' might ' get things delivered promptly and safely.   Anyway thanks for trying. I thought you might have a reduced shipping rates. Usually Microsoft does it. I guess have to wait for Office 2003 to arive on Indian shores.   An interesting discussion is beginning to take shape in the msitmmb group. These inspirational forwards are very nice to read. but it would be nice if someone takes a little time to maybe put it in a printer-friendly format. We can maybe take a printout of it and stick it someplace where we will read it often and try to follow it.  Read an interesting word today, '  estivation  ' It is a noun and has three meanings: 1. The act of spending or passing the summer.  2.  Zoology : A state of dormancy or torpor during the summer.  3.  Botany :The arrangement of flower parts in the bud.   If possible, I will try to post a new word daily or an interesting piece of information. Ram & Rini had been asking me to do this for a very long time.   Bye.

      Hi,  I tried very hard to resist bringing the msitmmb politics to the blog. But I just can't refrain... I wonder what is happening... why are mails being taken too personally... and why these unecessary words like "discimination". And why do people think one is trying to discriminate if he uses his company's name...   I wonder if I were working in "Mangaathaa technologies" and used that name in my mail, then will they think I'm discriminating... is it a punishment I'm getting for working in a big company... ???

      Hi,  I'm being moved to a project as a consultant for .NET and BizTalk Server... Usually freshers are not put in such consulting assignments, but there is a heavy resource crunch and they are forced to send me for this. There was some speculation that I might be sent to Pune or Bhubaneshwar, but thankfully, the project is within Bangalore only.   I have to report for it from June 9th and the consulting period will be for 4 months... after which I'll get back to my usual R&D stuff... My team people have asked me to keep in touch with them in case I need any help... and I'll need a lot of that for sure... Its going to be tuff and challenging...   The project is for a client called RUAN... a logistics company based in US.  Thats is all I know abt the specifics of the project as of now...

      Interesting to read VizBabu's categorisation of the group. Wondering why s/w pros are languishing at the bottom of the list. And why Viz is not a s/w pro.   Got up at 6 am today morning after a very long time, (last time was in August, I used to get up at 4 am). My parents have left for Madurai and from there to Palayamkottai. My brother has left to Ooty. So I'm home alone till Monday.   Due to a lot of marriages to attend and birthdays, my salary has disappeared in a jiffy. So I won't and can't eat out often. So have to improve my cooking and try out new recipes.   My first experiment is today afternoon or evening, a coffee. Found a lot of recipes on coffee on the net. So will try out a couple of recipes by tonight.   Bye,

      Hi,  Whatever VisBabu means by "hybrid" group...no guesses but eager to hear.   and whatever ramgopal meant by,  "but kicha is in infy, blr.. but what to do.. cant figure OUT and IN...."   no guesses again... but want to know what it meant or tried to mean...  some breaking biz news: rupee ended the day yesterday at Rs.46.9 / dollar. It has strengthened considerably. It was 49.7 in June '02. And that is not good news for the Indian IT firms. iFlex CFO says he expected rupee to depreciate by 3-4% annually as it was happening all this time. But contrary to all expectations rupee is becoming stronger by the day and expected to rise further... Either Indian companies move business out of US slowly and steadily... or perish. Nobody wants the latter to happen and the former is going to be a big struggle.... so much for India's IT prowess...

      Dear Kavi,  I noticed you used "My final compre is preponed" in one of your posts. The word 'prepone' is used by most people (mostly subcontinental people) to mean the opposite of , i.e. move forward in time. Nothing wrong in using it , though if Sinduja and Valli use it in Uk or US, people might think they are blabbering. The right word to use would be 'advance' like "My final compre has been advanced". Note the 'has been' - past tense. You shouldn't use 'is advanced' - It is wrong.  Hope this small bit of grammar has been useful to you,

      Hi,  Kavi, I thought of a book first. but as I am giving her a story, that idea was a no no. As for CDs, she doesn't have a CD player. I thought of an audio cassette. She liked one cassette. it is not available in Coimbatore. I tried buying on the net. I found it at Sony Music, but they don't have a delivery in Coimbatore. Maybe those in Bangalore can help me. The name of the cassette is "Dance with Me". It is a soundtrack, featuring Chayanne and Vanessa Williams. The cassette may be available at Planet M or online at  urlLink Sony Music . Buy and send it to me. I'll reimburse you ;-).   As I was working late last night, I couldn't go out to buy a present. Planning to escape from office later.   last night watched three films, "Matrix Reloaded", "Samy" & "Putiya Geethai". The two tamil films was watched by fastforwarding whenever there was a song or a fight or any sentimental dialogue or jokes. But I wached Matrix completely. An intellectual film, my brother was watching it when I went home last night. he said he was watching it for the second time and it is difficult to understand the movie.   The movie is totally superb, can't wait to watch it in the theatre.  Bye for now,

      Hi,  jax, thanx for giving ur cousin's ID. I contacted him and he's told he'll try for some docs to help me.   Meanwhile, today is the last day to submit income-tax proposals for me here. And as u might expect I'm yet to learn or plan anything. So, submitted it with the only field that I could enter - the PAN number. This means, I'll lose heaviliy on tax until November when this thing will be online again and then I can show some savings and get my tax exemptions. And whatever I lose until then (or after that) I can file for returns next april with the tax consultant who comes here for getting refund of the additional tax payments.   So... I'm gonna earn less from this month ;-( ...   VisBabu... No Good Evening from u y'day and no Good Morning from u today... What happened... and only 1 post before this today...

      Bon Jour mes amis,  It is good to hear from all of you.   Ranjini : Where are the snaps? Did you put in Yahoo! photos or did u mail them to me?    Sindu : How was Dreamcatcher other than scary? Horror movies are supposed to scary not funny like our Tamil horror flicks. Heard it was a wonderful film. I didn't have the time to put the page numbers. I can do it only in the weekend.   Valli : I need a lot of things. But you can't get me all of them. If I require anything, I'll let you know. Right now, I would love to get a copy of Microsoft Office 2003. It is available free from Micosoft website. But includes a shipping charge of $19.95. I don't know your exact location, State, zip code. So I could not calculate how much it would cost you. Maybe you can also check it out at the  urlLink Microsoft website . Maybe Ganesh has got it for his company.   The Microsoft OneNote beta cd was functional. I installed it and it worked very fine. Microsoft says I can use it till November. That is still 6 months away. Hoping to spend the next few weeks putting the s/w through its pace. My writing mind decided that I had to write an article on OneNote. Let us see if I have the time.   Kicha : Maybe you can contact my cousin, Alex at Bangalore. He works in IBM. His mail id is  jraymond  at in.ibm.com or ibm.in.com. I forgot which. Please check it out.    Ram : Seem to be working very late at your office. I think your aim of sleeping for only four hours has come true. What figures were you mentioning to Kicha? The ones on paper or the ones on road?   Ganja : Good to hear that you are keeping yourself fit. I get to play cricket rarely nowadays. Looking forward to hear more of your crickexploits.   Hey, I had asked you all for suggestions for a birthday gift for my friend. I still haven't received it yet. It is tomorrow (May 21). I only have a story that I wrote for her with me. Ranjini has already read it. I'll send it to the others later.  I wanted to give something in the materialistic format. I had thought of buying her a pair of shoes. But I cannot, because last night her brother called me and said that he was going to buy her shoes. So, we went out last night to buy her shoes. I never knew that girls had so small feet. Also never knew or understood how they wear those high heels or stools or platforms. Saw a lot of shoes last night. Luckily, her brother knew what she liked. Black coloured shoes with straps and little or minimal heel length. Our half an hour search ended finally. But I felt that ash grey or silver coloured shoes are nice as they are neutral colours and will suit any dress. As said, now I cannot buy her shoes.   One idea is to buy her a bag, what do you girls call it, handbag or pouch? Still contemplating other gifts also. Your suggestions are welcome and please make it soon.   Adieu,

Yes, Ofcourse I enjoyed the Weekend at the most, went to an ashram nearby.... (JINDAL) U know its a great place... but can be maintained more than what its now....  after 3 months I watched TV, Heard about serials, Movies ( 1 malayalam, 1 english, 1 tamil, 1 hindi) Formula One Car Race.... then everything I can for the entire 2 days.... Cool food and nice sleep...  In that ashram they have the vishwaruppam statue of Lord Krishna and The Ratha(krishna & Arjuna) in a magnificiant height... Entire gita is depicted in Hindi, English and Kannada... Very nice place to visit... But I think if maintained properly, i.e, with much popularity etc... then it will match Kempfort Shiva Temple.....  Great yeah....  Yeah, was busy over the day.. hence read ur posts and mini one from my side...  Take care.. GN for Natives.... GE for UK's and GM for US's... catch u tommorrow.....

      Hi,  Watched "Indru Muthal" on CD.OK movie with jokes from Ramesh kanna & K.S.Ravikumar.  Played  cricket after a gap of 4 years with my friends in chennai.was soaked in sweat.bcoz of smoking these days i could feel the difference while playing.was exhausted very soon.  we usually play in front of our house in adyar.neighbours said that for 4 years they were peaceful but now every sunday they have to take the pain of retrieving the ball for us if it goes inside their houses.  now all the neighbours have dogs in their houses.so u should have seen us picking the ball & running towards the gate.it was nice enjoying after 4 long years.  bye  urs  ganesh

       urlLink  Hi everyone,  Recieved my copy of Microsoft OneNote beta today. Our efficient postal dept. had delivered it to me with one of the cds cracked. the crack had occured when they had stamped the post office seal. I am very angry and disappointed also. But there seems a hope because I received two cds, one was the demo itself and the other one must be a presentation on OneNote. praying that it was the presentation cd that broke.  Those in Bang, any chance of dropping in at MS's office there to see if there are any office 2003 betas available. Shipping a free copy to India costs around 20$. Maybe Valli can help me. She can maybe get a free copy there and send it over to me.  Also searching the net for any cracks of Office 11 or Office 2003. Someone finds anything. Inform me.  Ranjini, I've made a few changes regarding the identity of the poster.   If you want an easier way to post to the blog, try reading one of my previous posts  urlLink here .   The best option is to login to blogger and check the "remember me" checkbox. After posting, don't sign out. You can go to blogger anytime without signing in. If you are worried or using a public computer like Valli, there is another way. I tried it out once, didn't come out well. Need some time on it though. Please bear with me.  I'll check out the story problem later.  Seems you are out there visiting a lot of kutcheris. I am jealous.  Bye,

      hi friends,  ya as my senior is absent today, i am just keeping the blog updated! Welcome Vijay and ya jax, i always wanted to tell u to put Archives in list box in reverse chronology and this is well taken care. So its good. And ya cant we have an Edit link in the page so that only the members can go directly go to the Edit page directly rather than going to blogger and then getting into that page? And jax, how about putting the name of the writer first on top of the page rather than at the bottom. Coz if there is a blog as big as mine , u will have to scroll to bottom to see who has written it. So better put the writers name on top. Do it if u feel ok.  Yes Valli sindhu, namba bloggeraye battle field aakkittenga pola irukku and only now the tycoon and hurricanes have subsided i believe. This atmosphere is good! Kavi will be back soon to our group when posted.   And ya Sindhu and valli i will mail u people my snaps to ur personal ids.  What happened to Rajesh Ganesh? No blogs!  Jax i couldnt read ur story as i wasnt able to open the file. Dont know whats the probs and once done will let u know about it.   Hei ladies how both are u doing well in cooking? And valli how do u spend ur time? Mail us what is ur daily routine and some interesting things too.....  Ok then bye for now from  Ranjini

      Hi,  rini, I've heard the "Bhavayami Gopalabalam" song by M.S. I've got my own favorite song composed by Annamacharya. Have u heard of "naanaati baduku naatakamu...". If u buy the cassette "Annamacharya kirtanas by MS" this will be the last song in that cassette. This is my favorite... I've got an emotional bonding to this song... Literally tears flow out of my eyes when I listen to it... just try it... not sure if it'll be of ur liking... but it surely drenches my heart everytime I hear...

       Hei, I have got speakers in our dept. but nay not to my system. Ya we are not supposed to listen to songs I believe and our company hasn't just grown up till to the fact of allowing its employees to listen to songs as we work. Anyway for testing, we got two speakers and finally after a much longer struggle, I could download one of my favourite song on to my system's hard disk. Guess what song it is? I bet u people , u cant. Coz u would have not heard me speak about it even once before.     Ya have u guys heard, "Bhavayami Gopalabalam" song by M.S.? Its in Pancharatnamala composed by Annamacharya. My god, how divine her voice is! Ya I first listened to the same song by Bombay Jeyashree. I never felt an attraction, though I like her voice too and find her to be one of the best upcoming vocal artist. But then when I listened to the same song by M.S. once, just once, it stuck to me so hardly that at last it drove me to find speaker and then download a 4.4 MB song for almost more than an hour spanning for two days and then listen to that blissful song today morning as I start my day! By the end of the day, I think I would have learnt the entire song. Such a song, which I think I have never heard....... I really wonder, still how many such songs or much more beautiful than this song are there which remains still unheard by me. Oh god, wish I hear to all those songs during this life time itself. How jealous of me na. (To others who werent into early blog list, my words might sound a bit mystical as i talk about Carnatic music, but jax, kishore and Ram are used to it and hope u all will in near future).   Hei now a days i go to concerts too. Ya last week on Wednesday, i happened to go to Unni krishnan' concert. Before I had no liking towards his voice as its too soft for a guys voice. And my likes were of those who had a solid voice like Sanjay Subramanyam (one more upcoming male vocalist). I have always felt that though there was sweetness in Unni's voice, there is no solidity in his voice. But ....... But that day, on his live concert, u should see the way he majestically expounded to us the world of CMusic. Never have i heard of even a  single song in CMusic sung by him. But then i was ably carried by his Highly Masculine, rich in solidity and glorious voice of his. Of all the four concerts i have attended till date i rated this to be the best (note:even better than Nithyashree Mahadevan, my favourite). Then just imagine how enjoyable that evening should have been!   Then coming to this weekend, Saturday I slept like anything till 10 o clock and then remembered of poor srini, who would be waiting for me to turn up, so rang up and told him that I would come and meet him around 12 o clock. He too had to wait and I went there. I was wearing a new cotton saree and I was looking like a scare crow in it. So frightened Srini and his cousins as the saree was not staying with me but always sticking a yard away from my body and srini's cousins started kidding me asking, if I am wearing a gown or what. Even when I sit, I had an aura of my dress around me. So sent srini to get a new chudi which I had given for stitching to a tailor near by srini's place. Oh , he too went on that scorching sun and got it for me and I felt relaxed only when I had fitted myself into that.   In the evening, we went for shopping to commercial and got 4 chudi materials fata fat in just half an hour and came back home coz I was feeling tired. (Coz I wanted to sleep a bit more) Sariyaana thoogu moonjinnu srini kitta irundhu thittu vaangatha korai thaan.   So did I spend my Saturday and then comes the asusal but always special Sunday. I started my day early and did bit of washing and started to srini's place. On my way I got some nice red & pink roses and two stems of gladiolus and two stems of Tuber rose for our prayer. After prayer, as usual we went to ISKCON temple. From there we went to one of his friend's place. He has brought his wife and kid after delivery and we had a nice time cooing and playing with the kid. Dint know how time passed away and it was evening 4 o clock. Oops we had plans to go to BalaMurali krishna's concert, but we thought it would be late and so decided not to go for it and came back home. After a long time, we got time to talk as now a days we don't find time, though we meet often, we often talk regarding our daily activities and nothing useful. But then, after long time we enjoyed talking something useful. Oho, my Sunday is also over and I need to prepare for my Monday!  Ya i came to office as usual and read blogger and started keying in this blog...... Ok then will mail u later Ranjini

      Hi,  It was a weekend as usual. Watched the  urlLink Austrian Grand Prix . An  urlLink exciting race  with lots of  urlLink drama and excitement . I can't wait for the next race, Monaco, the most hardest racing circuit in the world.   Last weekend, I read two stories. One, " urlLink The Pelican Brief " by John Grisham. It was made into a  urlLink movie  starring Julia Roberts & Denzel Washingon. It is amazing to know that many of this books have been made into movies. The only other author (if you discount Shakespeare) whose books have been made into a lot of movies is  urlLink Michael Crichton .  I read the other story on the net. It was an interesting story of love between the Devil and a woman. An interesting idea for a story.  urlLink Read it here .  For those interested in Business stories,  urlLink here  is an interesting one I read a short time ago.   That's all folks,

      Hi,  Had a somber weekend. Waited for Ramgopal's call to go out somewhere... and... am still waiting...  Sunday afternoon saw a hindi movie on CD... "Pran jayey par shaan na jayey" (lose life but not self-esteem)... it was a satirical art-film that revolves around the lives and happenings in typical middle-class families living together in a mansion in Bombay... A truely satirical movie that ended with a poke at RK Laxman's "common-man". Not many people might like it for all that happens in the movie but all that was nothing but reflections of any middle-class household. It also touched some happenings of national priority and their impact on such families. To me... it was a good attempt.   Apart from that nothing useful. Just went on to read another junk mail in our groups and gave another somber reply to it. I'm tired of this.

      Dear Ram,  The word you should have used is GHOTI not GHOT to write the word  Fish.   For those you who can't understand, Bernand Shaw, i think once while commenting on the English language said that hereafterwards, Fish is to be written as "Ghoti". Reason: the first letter "F" of fish has a similar pronunciation as "gh" in 'enough'. I forgot the exact word he used for 'i' in 'fish'. The 'ti' comes from any word ending in 'tion' like nation or demonstration., where 'ti' is pronunced as 'sh'.   Valli, what's your bro's plan, doctor or engineer?   reagrding the bottom pane refresh, it is nothing but blogger updating itself every minute. Also this problem would be evident in machines using IE5.x or higher or Mozilla 1.3 or Netscape 7. Thsi is because Blogger uses two interfaces. A "Standard" one that Valli and Ram or anyone using the latest browser will be using. the other is a "LoFi" interface for those using older browsers like IE 5. I have been using IE5 for the past few weeks as my Mozilla browser crashes often, I couldn't notice the problem. Currently, I am typing this using Mozilla. The bottom pane does get refreshed.  urlLink It is a feature, not a bug .   I had said yesterday that there were plans to go to Ooty this weekend. It has been cancelled. I've to spend this Sunday as usual.  Bye,

      Hai.....  very nice to c blogs from 25 hrs engaged person..... Hope Rini is ahead of time.....  By way, Valli, its true I also experience automatic refreshing of the bottom pane of the web page where u edit the blogs. I think its blog's facility to update us with recent postings even when we type.... and hope Jax cant do anything regarding that....  Talked to Sweet... she is here for an interview...Hope she will do it good... and , blrmsitmians.. list increases....  By way, tommorrow planned to cut office and accompany my aunt to my relatives home nearby....  Hence, if there is any meeting within blr gang, it will be nice to schedule sunday for my presence...

      Hi,  Great to hear from Ranjini after a long time. two weeks I think? Rini, you have a Yahoo id, why don't you upload it there and send us the link. It'll save you time and also you can mail it from there itself. It has some great features. Why don't we use the facilities and the technologies. I guess you might know your way around  urlLink Yahoo!.   You had posted your message twice,  I think you are too excited . Don't worry, I'll delete the repeated message. You think Black is better? I think I'll also try out some options. next week perhaps.    Yesterday, I had the time to go through the souvenir. It was a great experience. Felt like sitting there in the class and listening to you all. I miss those days.   This week, I might be going to Ooty for the flower show this Sunday. Still undecided on nr. of persons.    Hey guys and gals, got any interesting ideas to improve the participation of people in the group? Blog it. I have got a great idea of improving the participation in the groups. Starting next monday, I'll be removing a random member from the group. If that person doesn't reply within a week's time, they will be removed permanently :-). An interesting thought. Please suggest some useful ideas. Don't send anything like the above one.   Ranjini, you are exempt as you might have a lot to catch up (mails, blog archives). BTW expecting your comments on the story, if possible.   Bye,

      Hi all,  As Kicha had said, yesterday seemed to be the day with lots of posts to the blog, I think about 12 posts were made yesterday. It is good to know that.   Valli: You had said that there was some problem in the bottom portion of the blog.I didn't seem to find any problem there. Is your problem occuring when you were viewing the blog or did it occur when you were inside blogger.com.  Could you be more specific? If ther is anything I can do, I'll do it. BTW where do you mostly use the net, home or outside? You seem to be waving a lot of white flags often.  Hey just now read an interesting piece about warfare on  urlLink Rediff .   Kicha: Since we have to make do with only one page, we cannot have a next page button. But certainly, there is an option for displaying more entries in the blog. Currently, the blog is set up to display 5 recent entries. I felt that as there might be days when we might be posting at all say like Sundays. I didn't want just one or two entries to be displayed in the blog. I'll change the settings to display 7 or 8 most recent posts. If it crosses that, you have to read it in the archives. I feel that number is sufficient, otherwise the page might go on scrolling downwards.  Sindu: Hope your trip went very fine.   Ganja: Nee, corporate salesle, note the time-aaa. Where is Rajesh? No posts from him at all.  Sari, indha annan-thangachi sandaiya neeruthurengala. Undane 'avana neruthasollu, naan neruthuraennu ' dialogue annupathe.   Still waiting to hear  Bye,

      Hi,  Yesterday it was tight...real tight... after a looong time... Me and my team-mate (a senior guy) tussled with .NET for more than 6 hours (at-a-stretch) until 9PM IST to get a performance critical task going... and we made it at last... and I rushed to the restaurant to have a meal in a hurry and managed to catch the bus at 9.15PM IST... the habit of eating fast has its own advantages...  This weekend... I want to get some things right regarding my income tax... Until yesterday, I seemed to be a kid with no responsibilities and today all of a sudden I'm a kid (still) who has to worry about a whole lot of things... I need to learn on how to save, what to save... will get the help of our Maths-expert (guess who) to aid me with some calculations and need to go to Post Office (remember that place...?) to learn about PPF, NSC etc. That place still has got some utilities...if not for snail mails... and by tuesday I need to declare my Investment proposals here in infy.   I remember the question posed by Valli (I think) to Ravichandran on private company people getting away from tax and Govt people forced into it... and he replied "thappu seyya mudiyadhavan thappu seyyaravana paathu poraama pada kudadhu"... :)  Infy is very strict on I-T and cuts as per our proposals from our salary and the final leftovers, if any, are deducted at the end of fiscal year... in case we pay more tax than needed then infy also arranges tax consultants to get the refund back...  Looking forward to (probably) one of the few weekends remaining... guess why... grapevine sources here say that we'll be working on saturdays too... from July... nothing official yet...

      Hey all,  I have added the subscribe to this blog option. It was there a month back, but due to template changes, it was not added. It is done now. Guess what Bulb has subscribed. She will be receiving the updates made in the blog to her mailbox. Let us who all will subscribe.   BTW, members of the blog need not subscribe, unless you want to recieve a mail everytime someone posts a message.  Welcome Kavi, try to post as often as you could. Any queries, ask your infy senior Kicha. Convey my regards to Sweet.  Bye for now,

       Hi all,  Good to see a flurry of posts in the blog from Valli, Kicha and Ram.  My replies:   Valli : Valli, Glad to read your comments (that too from a SCO). I feel you must have read the story as the pdf file.   Did you print it out and then read it?   Becasue the pages would appear sort of flowless if you read it online. You should have printed it out and then read it. But then, I made a mistake of not including page numbers. If I had done so you have been able to print and arrange it properly before reading it. Anyway try reading it out after printing it it out. Same advice to Sindhu and Rini.  Other don't worry. I'll let you have access to the files. I have put it online at Yahoo! briefcase. But right now, I have made it a private briefcase. once I have make it a public briefcase, I'll inform the link. You too can read them.   Kicha : Your suggestion for the empty box is valid. My arguments against it are:  1) As the content for the box had to be permanent (i.e. not to be modified at all or will be modified ocassionally a la members list), having the news there would be say a waste of time. 2) But as you said, maybe something like events that involves most of us say for example, Rini's upcoming marriage, an online chat could be put there. It could serve as a reminder. 3) talking of chat, I found a  urlLink link  at Yahoo! that will tell if a person is online or not. It will display an icon, if the user is logged into Yahoo!. Say for example, i have logged into Yahoo!, you are reading the blog. My Yahoo! icon will show that I'm online. Still haven't tried it out. Maybe we can colloborate over it, we can try to implement it.  4) The Blogrolling section is a trial version. You too can create your own blog roll. This section will mostly contain sections that I am interested in, say, a sort of My Bookmarks. if everyone creates thier own blogroll, we can have a separate section for each one of us with our names. This decision is left to everyone in the group. As I have to update only my links section only at  urlLink Blogrolling.com , I need not touch the template code at all except to add the html code once when i set it up.   Ram : That was quite a big post. As Ram had added his location of posting, I think that is a very good idea since this blog is updated from several countires, (an international blog). Sometime back I had written about Geo URL.  There is also another thing known as warchalking. In our case,  urlLink blogchalking , Visit to know more.  bye,

      Hi,  I can't resist sharing the following piece from the Infy BB... (and for those who wonder what BB is - its Bullettin Board)... this is the lightest side of any sport... Enjoy...      Soccer at its BEST!!!   It concerns a match played some time back between Barbados and Grenada in some cup competition. Barbados needed to win the game by two clear goals in order to progress to the next round.   Now the trouble was caused by a daft rule in the competition which stated that in the event of a game going to penalty kicks, the winner of the shoot-out would be awarded a 2-0 victory. (Yes, I'm sure you can all see what's coming....)   With 5 minutes to go, Barbados were leading 2-1, and going out of the tournament. Then, when they realised they were probably not going to score against Grenada's massed defence, they turned round, and deliberately scored an own goal, to level the scores. Grenada, themselves not being stupid, realised what was going on, and then attempted to score an own goal themselves. However, the Barbados players started defending their opponents goal to prevent this.  In the last five minutes, therefore, spectators were treated to the incredible sight of a team defending their opponents goal against attackers desperately trying to score an own goal! Naturally, the game went to penalties, which Barbados won... This story is completely true. Apparently it was being televised live, so maybe we'll see highlights of it soon!      Now how's that for sportsmanship....

      Hi,  For the  Empty Box  we'll put some  Breaking news ... the news could be anything... anything about us/our friends or any links to some actual happenings around the world/us... we can send any breaking news we have using the  contact  link to jax and he'll put that in its place... this is different from the  Blogrolling  section... in this case, we'll have a coupla lines like a headline that'll carry links, not just a phrase linking to a site... this is one more opinion for the count...  Ganja... reliance offer oothikicha... DAE offer enna aachu... BusinessWorld 'la pottu kizhi kizhi nu kizhichuttaan...The weather is pleasant here too in the past week or so...  Valli... I'm not an avid novel/story reader, but one thing I would say is... if u understand everything in a story then its not a story... u should not understand them, still it must make sense... (whatever that means)... so I think jax has scored on this point...  and its good to see two thangachis fighting for their beloved annas... (but the annas never seem to bother...!!)...

      Hi, It was a great show on Saturday. To describe the least - Creativity at its best..!! As the music show by a group called Vinapra started, it sent every nerve racking. We jumped on to the front of stage and started dancing (well, almost) and jumping and howling. I can still feel the vibration in my bones. Then a DJ started playing remixes after remixes and it was an electrifying environment with smoke and disco lights. And for once, nobody reminded themself of their gender.   After all the weekend merriment am looking forward to this friday when I'll be starting my week-long vacation covering rini's marriage in Madurai to spending until the next weekend in Chennai.

It’s nearly been 10 months I talked to sindhu…Jax,Why can’t we arrange a group chat soon???I am eagerly waiting for rini's marriage to meet you all.           Here in chennai since I am staying in a new hostel. I am missing all my old hostel friends and it's boring here at times. Yesterday I went for shopping..spent a lot in sarees. I was in T.Nagar for the whole day.I met few of my friends.We planned to go for 'Sangamam' infy music show.But we cudn't find time. Today just I am relaxing.TV in our hostel is not functioning properly..so I came out to check mails.    Valli, it's great to hear all your stories. It reminds our college days. Enjoy!!  Hope you have to manage your time now . Managing b/w cooking and reading!! What’s the timings for your course??  Then how you commute to your univ?     Rini,How is the preparations are going? Hope you are enjoying all the marriage rituals..Have a Nice time! I will be coming to mdu on Sunday morning. I had a project party on Wednesday in Residency..It’s was nice .We took few snaps..I will put few of my snaps in yahoo groups soon. Really it’s a great idea to have database…We can contact anyone ,wherever we are. Just now I updated my database. I cudn’t participate in all the initiatives since I don’t have net access. Let me know if I can do something for our groups..  See you..

      Hi, In office today. Not much by way of work... but need to make some arrangements for our team for  Dhun , which is a Hindi word meaning "Rhythm" - thats what the Infy, Bangalore's cultural show is traditionally named. It seems this is the 4th  Dhun . Though I'm not taking part in any event, I've volunteered to volunteer in the behind-the-screen activities for our team. After all, they are as important as the on-screen show-offs, ain't they...   The 32 buildings here are divided into 5 groups of 6 buildings (2 groups will have 7)... and it will be a contest between these groups. All the usual stuff like dumb charades, quiz - General and film, skits, dance, fashion parade etc., and also an exclusive show by some music troop at the end of the day... Heard some VJ is also coming for that music show.   It is scheduled to be from 3PM to 10PM later today... Looking forward for that... As I was walking past the amphitheatre-like designed stage where hoards of big Hi-Fi speakers are getting installed, I've already begun to feel the chill of it.  As of now, I'm just ralaxing and cooling myself off hearing what has become one of my all-time favorite songs - "The winner takes it all" by Abba.

      Hi friends,   I will b on leave from monday, but then i will try to browse and keep myself intact with the bloggers. By the way yesterday We bought a gift to my parents! Simple gold plated Watches from Titan. From the Day one since i joined this job, i never sent them even a single penny and so i thought let me get something special for them atleast in the sake of my wedding. I dont know what would be my parent's reaction, though i have told my dad before hand, its my Mom's words which i think i will have to face. so i am planning to release the gift only on the day of my wedding so that they cant tell me anything!  Ok guys i will also upload the route map to the Wedding hall on to our groups file section. So u can refer that for further details. bye for now

      Bon jour,  I was going through the members list in msitmmb. There were a few ids which were bouncing. I have decided to remove those ids and then re-subscribe them.   I also noticed that a few of us have subscribed using multiple ids. I know I am repeating it once again. But please use the Yahoo id alone. So, Ramgopal (3 ids), Vijay (2 ids), Manny (2 ids), and Valli (2 ids), please change your preferences to your yahoo id. I am willing to extend any help in this matter. Let us be an example of an interactive group. Expecting your cooperation.   I have decided to involve myself in the msitmmb group again. Since Rini might not be able to find time during the next few weeks, I decided to continue the work.  Other than that, got a lot of office work to do...

      On to another weekend. Will be coming to office tomorrow. Partly for some work but mostly to attend  Dhun  - the cultural show. HRD has told we can only bring our spouse and children for the show... None others...  But where do I get for one... ;-) Gosh, I guess I have to come alone...  It seems Kavi has got her mike and headfone. So, looking forward to some "talking" with her later today. Last day for rini in her present realm. When she's back its gonna be a different rini (I hope).  Surprisingly, I'm making steady progress reading the book "Conversations with God" that I got last week. Its more in the wavelength of my definition of God, Life and living. Really enjoying that stuff...

But i did not control my emotions as u had said da machan. what is there afterall colgate is also one of the company as there r 100's of them. tomorrow if some other company gives  good salary than this i will definitely go there.   see u know me that i do not jump over when something good as happened & also i do not brood over when something bad has happened also. it has been my character,so u cannot change it.  then athu ennada after every line u say hahahaha enna yawn panriya venna  bye

      Thanks to for welcoming me ranjini and ram…and yes…congrats ganja…this is my formal congrats apart from the one I said to u in person…ha ha.   We had a nice time here when bala also joined us during his visit for this CP interview.  We were kidding ganja and really ganja was so happy that day when he was almost confirmed in CP but he was not ready to outburst and show his excitements before us. I inferred  that from him and bala too…and we both started pulling his legs and were kidding.  We had a drink that night and While we were having our drink we had it by hiding it from ganja using a towel…(namma tamil padathula ellam mariyathaikkaga thunda vachi marachikittu kudippanga illa….antha maathiri…ha ha…sice ganja is no longer the same old ganja and now he has become the STS (Sales Territory Supervisor) of CP, he deserves this mariyathai…ha ha ha.)   And then, valli, kavitha ennai emathitta….Le’Meridien polamnnu sollittu, Kerela Shansikku kooti poitta…ofcourse athuvum nalla hotel thaan…but when compared to Le’Meridien…it’s a small one…but naan nalla thaan saapitten…over’a saapittathula…vaanthi vara alavukku aayiduchu….ha ha ha…  apram athu epdi…niraya pasangalukku mudi kotti asingama aayiducha….hmmmm…neram…  Ok cute boys and (not so) cute (MS ITM) girls…nothing more to pen.  C u later.  Mahen.

      Oh!! Man!! jax is taking me down the memory lane. and for those who cannot decipher wat he meant by asking me to look on top-right... here's the story...  Once upon a time in a place called Madurai there was a campus where people used to study. (atleast... that was what they were supposed to do) ... And there were two little people called Hem and Haw... er... jax and kicha... who were soo proactive that they wanted to do a project that emobodies the future... And so their hunt began... In the meantime, they  understood the significance of XML standards and chose the XML-Signature as their project... or rather, an implementation of XML-Signature using C#...   it was with great difficulty and hard work that they completed the project...   after all, searching in google ain't that easy... ;-))

      Hi, There's a cultural event this saturday here in infy. It seems it happens every year around this time. But this year due to some "unavoidable circumstance" ( Dilberto diplomatico ) they are not allowing family/friends... :-((  Just thinkig if I can volunteer to volunteer. After all, its not often that we are going to see dance and masti...   PS:  Dilberto diplomatico  means as diplomatic as "Dilbert" cartoons. And you won't find that phrase in any dictionary.

      Hi jax, i think u might see this post today evening, ya go thru the contact list i have created in our groups section. Kindly if u r free, add info of missing friends like sam and bala. as i dont have souvenir, i collected info from slam book. so theirs isnt there as they havent signed in mine. so update theirs from the souvenir. If not jax, those who have the souvenir can also do that. similarly update the calendar also with the birthdays of missing people. I found around 6 person's info missing in my slam book. As i havent worked on girls i cant quote whom i had missed exactly.   Friends suggestions are welcome to make any changes to the database from all the bloggers!  I snatched sometime to do this task before i go on for leave, coz this is a task which i had promised to do earlier but has made it only now.  And if possible, its better to influence our friends to sign in with yahoo id to access all the features. So bloggers who havent yet subsctibed up with yahoo id to our group, kindly do it!  and i have posted my invy to all. Valli i have posted to ur inlaws address properly dee, sindhu to ur parents address as u dint revert me with any change of address. I dont have balachander and sam's address. Can anyone, mail me theirs? And sandil's address too, coz i have only madurai address.

      Hope everyone had a fine weekend. Waiting for your weekend stories.     Myself, nothing special. Chatted with Kavi for some time. Wated "Nala Dhamayanthi". It was a funny and interesting film to watch, especially the portrayals of realities in life (plight of foreign going indians). if only more movies like these were taken by our film world..    I may not be able to blog today as I am leaving for a visit to a client's place. Might be late afternoon or even evening when I return.     Here is an intersting bit of news:  urlLink Indian boy hatches beetles .  See you later,

      Had a great weekend. Murtuza and Rajesh are here... Saturday had a good lunch with ram and met them both and sinoop. And we talked and talked and talked and talked standing at the sides in MG Road before dispersing for the day. Sunday was better. Swetha and her sister joined us and we had big lunch. And then we walked and walked and walked and walked and went with Rajesh to his friends home exactly in time for a coffee, and made our way back home late at night after a short visit to rajesh's place.   Me and Ramgopal, did what we have come to do quite often now-a-days -  Buy a book. Whether we read it is a different matter altogether, but it all adds up to the kitty. I got "Conversations with God" by Neale Donald Walsch. And started to read some of it.   Boy!! and did I love reading it...

      Thanks for your comments and have a nice weekend, Valli.   It is true I made some things up. I left a lot of clues for you to find out. I had twice contradicted myself on your comp. config. The bit about currencies. I said UG lab while an associate prg is only for graduates. I thought you would notice things like these.    The vending machine part is true. There is a vending machine to your left. I said I don't know the exact distance. It might be two metres away or two thousand kilometres away. So if you keep going to your left, you might find a vending machine either in the next building or the next or the next... BTW don't follow the "keep to the left while driving".    About the "IA & ID" prg, only a few universities in the world have it. Just enquiring if yours was one.   Hope you would watched "Alaipayuthey". Do you remember the scene when here is a "ponnu parkkum" scene for Shalini's sister. The "mapillai"'s brother introduces himself. Remember... Read the following sentence in that style.  I will be doing my masters degree in communication and journalism at Kamaraj University this year.  Finished reading, come back...   I wanted to tell this news earlier but I had a doubt whether I had submitted my TC and provisional to my office. Spent the last two days searching for it. Found it yesterday night only. So study for two years.  My fellow MSITMians, some news for you. MKU has started M.Phil courses in Computer Science this year. Guess what, MSITM is eligible. So those of you willing to do thier M.Phil, you've got three options,   ->  M.Phil. Computer Science  - Fees: INR 12000, payable in lump or two installments (6250 each). ->  M.Phil. Management  - Fees: INR 6000, payable in lump or two installments (3125 each). ->  M.Phil. Entrepreneurship  - Fees: I don't know  All above courses are of one year duration.  The applications are being given, INR 200 by post or INR 150 in person.  My MCJ (Master of Communication and Journalism) fees are a very paltry for a two year course - INR 1985 per year.  The SW monsoon has begun, they say. It is raining here. Sorry, Drizzling steadily, not raining heavily. I started from home to my office at 8:03, a distance of 1.5 km or 1 mile. By the time I arrived at my office, I had    -> escaped skidding off on three to four occasions -> missed hitting two to three persons who choose to come in front of my vehicle instead of the lorry coming behind me -> refused lifts to atleast one person.   Arriving at the office, I have to be careful as the mosaic floor put up in front has a tendency to remind people of friction. Many people have understood the laws of physics on that floor, especially on rainy days. It doesn't end there. I run up three flights of stairs up to my office and then swipe in my id card. The time would be 8:05:54. I made it with five seconds to  spare.  A week had conme and gone. So what are your plans for this weekend? Mine is as usual, church, browsing, computer or tv. If anything interesting happens, I'll let you all know of it.  Yesterday, my net connection was down since afternoon. It still is at the time of composing this. Malaiikaga browsing centre pakkudhilla odhungunaen, I saw my friend there. She had come to see her results. She read out Valli's post to me. She seemed interested in our method of communication.  As we make multimedia CDs, I develop the content for voicevers that come in the cd. The irony is that the person who does the voiceover gets over 10k for half an hour's reading while the poor developer (myself) get only a fraction of that amount.  more from me later,

You typed all ur words with the fingers in ur hands... u were facing the monitor when u were typing things out... at times u don't look at the keyboard while typing and at times u look... and while this entire process was going on, u were constantly and continuosly doing one thing - breathing...  ;-))

      hey Xavier,  It was interesting to read all ur predictions man.....u were going on the right lane, but suddenly drifted, & started predicting wrong......   You use a Win Xp with IE6  : right  used AOL to view the blog  : right, i always use AOL to hook up to the net  You accessed the blog somewhere around a university  : Based on which date was this prediction made?....Library is near the Univ, But i went there a couple *                                                                                        of  weeks back I'm going to do A.S in University of Ketucky.....& i guess CalTech is California Institute of Technology....California is nearly 2400 miles from my place..... we don't have any  street named San Pasqual Street, Pasadena. Cross checked this with our Lexington maps too....Ofcourse, i've a printer near me & i'm facing the printer....  appuram indha  Vending machine ellam buruda dhaana???.....how can u predict a vending machine man?....yaara aemaatha paakkura?....  I'm not sure if they offer a course in "Information Design or Architecture"? in CalTech....But there's a department called IMD(Infomation Management & Design) in UK(Univ of Kentucky) & a web designing course in Sullivan Univ(private), Lexington......  It was a good start man.....continue to practice this art....  Happy week end Guys..... shld pack up things for our journey...starting off early  this afternoon.....bye...

      Valli, where have you planned to do your Associate degree in Computer Information Systems? CalTech?    Ok, here is some information. I may be right or I may be wrong. Anyway, I tried.    You use a Win2k machine with IE5? BTW, does your ip address begin with 216.52.229?     You access the net from Jorgensen Center for Information Science. It is situated on San Pasqual Street, Pasadena. The Jorgensen Center for Information Science (Building No. 80) is the under graduate computer science dept. computer lab of CalTech. Interestingly, the computers are named after currencies there.    If the above info is correct, read on. There is a printer near you. If you are facing the printer, there would be a vending machine to the printer's left. I don't know the exact distance but it is there.     Valli, tell me how correct was I? Awaiting your reply?    Also Valli, could you find out if they offer courses in "Information Design or Architecture"?      "Reality no longer has the time to take on the appearance of reality."   &nbsp;   Kicha, I will get back to your post soon.    CSS link(opens in a new window):  urlLink www.w3c.org

      Sad to hear Valli's plight... she's going to school after completing college ;-)  Was just thinking of what cud be our next topic for discussion. The previous topic on "carrying-over" traditions got some response from ony 3 or 4 people. It's great to hear varied view points about many ideas and it all surely adds up to our wisdom and our ways of thinking. The discussion on M:R cud not have got much response as many might not have seen it...   One interesting link I came across y'day... Not sure how many of us are aware of it... but if u have really known the source of our national anthem, then u can check the validity of what is below.   Check out this link on  urlLink national anthem  and do share ur views.

      Kavi, Sorry, forgot your new posting. Actually i thought I had typed in Chennai. seems I goofed up. I'll correct the same.  Valli, thanks for posting your message. Well let me try yours then. You accessed the blog somewhere around a university. You use a Win Xp with IE6. Am I right? You can just say, 'Yes' or 'No'. i'll try to find out the details myself. A few days ago, you used AOL to view the blog. right or not?   I'll tell you more tomorrow.

      Hi Jax,             I can always send it the second time Jax....It was just a small disappointment yesterday....that's it.....Maybe, i'll also use notepad in the future...            Welcome Mahendran!!!......expecting lot more interesting news from u.....Adhukaaha, hindi la ellam type pannina....India vandhu udhaippaen....either convey it in the Universal Lang or our mother tounge man.....convey my wishes to ur sis....  this's what i was  trying to post yesterday.....  I've planned to go to school from this summer.....I'm going to do an Associate degree in Computer Information Systems....this's a 2 yrs course....classes r starting from next wednesday..... I can take only 7 credits in summer....but still, it helps me finish off the course as soon as possible....Initially we had opted for M.S....But, know what.....even the deadline for 2004 spring is over....so i can do M.S only in 2004 fall.....but there's more than an yr's gap inbetween....i cud finish off A.S by then & get into the work stream.....  So guys, if somebody's planning to do M.S here.....think far ahead, so that u don't waste ur years & age.....  Hey sindhu, this "Toll system" is existing here for nearly a decade or so.....in almost all the metros......I doubt if that's going to be a reason to reduce the percentage of traffic......here they do that for revenue......For all of us, there's the federal tax & the state tax.....But for people in metros the Govt collects a city tax also...this toll system is a way of collecting city tax from both the stagnent & the floating population....But ofcourse, US is really weak in public transport systems....so maybe in UK it may act as a traffic reducing agent......  I guess, this system already exists in India......For ex, I"m not sure....but just recollect.....on your way to Pazhamudircholai from Azhagar kovil, they stop us & collect money & give back a reciept...remember???....that's ofcourse a toll system....maybe  a manual toll system, unlike here....This's just an example.... Actually,  i shld have quoted a freeway or a state highway...but since i did'nt know anything in particular, i'm saying this...   hey Rini,.....great that u were able to get three weeks off from ur work......  this weekend we are going to Chicago for an Engagement....The bridegroom is my cousin & the bride is Ganesh's Cousin......looking forward to have a great time, after a very long time....It takes nearly 8 hrs to reach Chicago from our place......This's totally a family get together...so we'll not have much time to tour around Chicago this time....but i'm waiting impatiently, just to see one place...the Indian bazaar there.....One full road, with boards & signs written in hindi, tamil, telugu...It's typically our Renganathan st, it seems....inclusive of kai aendhi bhavans .........poor Ganesh is trembling to take me there....'coz i've been making a list for the past one week...&  i wonder, the list never seems to end....i still get things in my mind,  to purchase every now & then....  Xavier....trying to become a cyber detective?....nice to read all ur guesses...but why is that, everytime, u end up in either guessing Kicha's machine or Sindhu's?.....if u continue to do this....i'll have to conclude that it's an agreement b/w u & those two...try to guess something else man....    bye

      Hi,  Ranjini, ur invi looks great....so..how many months u r going to be on leave???  Welcome Mahendran....convey my wishes to your sister....  still no sign of sangeetha yet???  hey Jax, If I get into posting the receipe for kesari, we will definitely get ' hits ', but not the one you are looking for.  They have introduced new system in London and in few heavy traffic motor ways...called ' Toll system '. It means we have to pay for every mile we drive during the peak hours, in the most congested areas. Soon they are planning  to extend the system in all major cities in UK. It is believed to rduce the traffic by 19%. The transportation system is good here, in particular the tube rails in London. So this system will make people to opt for public transportation instead of cars. It has a good success rate as well. I was just wondering if we bring in the same system to India...how far will it be effective in reducing the traffic??   cheers

      Valli,  I noticed this before. I presumed it was something at my end, (the pages being retreived from my machine's cache). Actually, if you hit the Post button, Blogger stores your post. It doesn't publish the post. It gets published only when someone like me hit "Publish all recent posts", which I often do.  You should hit the "Post and Publish" button, which you might see if you are using IE6 on the top corner. Otherwise you can go to the publish status tab. If it shows "no posts published in this session". hit the publish recent button. Everything would be fine.  If you're still facing difficulties, let me know.  And if you can remember what you have typed, please type your four paras for us without considering the pain. Valli, I also have lost quite a number of posts like you did in the past. So I came up with a solution. I usually type my posts in Notepad and Copy it and paste it in the post window. That way, I don't lose anything because of vagaries of the Internet.  What happened to the others? Still waiting for Sangee's and Manny's first posts...

Now, if it was false, I shud be hanged. In which case my statement wud become false and I shud be beheaded...this throws up yet another paradox...  btw, I'm in Electronics city... but PIN code is 561 229 and not 562 158...

      " Within this realm of choicelessness, we do choose how we live ". - Joseph Epstein     Hey, here is something for you to think about (today or tonight):    "A prince has put a law on poaching in his land. Poaching is punishable by death. In order to give the culprit a choice, he decreed that anyone caught poaching will be given the privilege of deciding whether he should be hanged or beheaded. That he can choose his mode of death. The person was permitted to make a statement. If it was false, he would be hanged; but if it was true, he would be beheaded."

So would you like three to four pop-under windows to be shown whenever you visit the blog. So, can't use it for the blog, da.  BTW, What happenned this weekend, No news from anyone?

      Guess what this quote is about and by whom?  "It's about the search for identity, the struggle of life, trying to find out the mythical themes of the messiah, of the lovers, of the teacher, of the shaman. It's such a great platform for how we can sometimes think about our own lives."  Sangeetha has joined us in this blog.   Welcome to the blog, Sangee  . Waiting for Sangee's first blog...  The blog strength has increased to eleven. I have added Mahendran. Is mahendrapallavan at yahoo his mail id? If I'm wrong, someone inform me asap.  BTW: the above quote was given by Keanu Reeves when asked what the Matrix Trilogy was?

Invitation: 1011x974 pixels, size 120 kb). You could saved a lot of bandwidth by reducing the size a little bit. Just a suggestion. Waiting to get my hands on the hard copy shortly.    Kicha seems to trying something . Good.     I've got a new design lined up for the blog. You can see the original version  urlLink here .

      Back after a sober weekend. In fact, didn't have more than 2 hrs of work on saturday. I just came to while away some time. The weather was a beaut that day. I joined with a coupla my friends and walked around the campus. It was such refreshing. Saw M:R in the evening before going home. Could make a lot of sense watching it first time itself, as I had already read a lot of reviews. Its really a unique deal with fiction. And to realise how much truth a fiction could radiate, u need to watch that film.  If u also concentrate on the conversations there's a lot more to enjoy. Some conversations are still lingering in my mind...  "You see only what you choose to understand"  "Comprehension is not a requisite for cooperation"  Neo to the Oracle: "You already know my choice. How is it a choice then? What if I do not choose?"... Oracle: "Even that is making a choice"  and lot more...

      Hi,  To add to jax's view on discussions...  Just like I had mentioned as my views, in one of my earlier mails, every entity that is part of nature will undergo transformation and death. "Discussion" is just another entity in nature. And its bound by the same laws that bind every other entity. The "process" of discussing is another entity and its going to have its own tranformations and end. We notice this at the very basic levels of interactivity. Ans its in nature to transform whatever it binds.   Given this, its nothing surprising that our discussions take different forms at different times and sometimes come to an abrupt halt or take a different direction altogether.

      Hi all,  Got time to blog.  Following is the description of our enjoyment in Manny sister's marriage. Rajesh.Vijay & myself started off to Trichy on Tuesday evening from Koyambedu. all of us started to eat the chips & biscuits which vijay had bought.  as usual after Chengalpattu Rajesh started meddling with his cell phone. both vijay & rajesh did not allow me to sleep at all.  reached trichy at 1 at night. found the lodge which manny had booked and found ajyan,bala,sam,sandil,vinoth kumar & manny already boozing.since it was late they had already started the party. i got only 2 rounds of our favourite "Old Cask".  Vignesh came at 4 in the morning.went to sleep a short while later.ram & murtu came in the morning while we were still sleeping.  got ourselves ready & went for the marriage at 8.30.had a nice breakfast. immediately after the marriage ate our lunch & went to the room to continue our sleep. ajayan,vijay,ram  & bala went to Srirangam.   woke up in the evening & went to Mapillai's house at BHEL to have the feast which it seems is a custom.   since the mission of having free food was completed (hihihihi) each one of us started to our respective places.manny,vijay ,sam & myself started off to chennai.  that's how it went.  then saw "Nalla  Thamayanthi" on Thursday. Witty movie with lots of humour. But the best part comes in the last 5 minutes of the movie when my "Thalaivar Kamal" comes with the "Sandiyar" costume.  Unknowingly I started shouting "Thalaiva". Just could not wait to see the movie.  hope it was not boring  bye

      Ranjini had asked why our discussions all 'go to den'. Why?   My take on the issue:  Rini, It is difficult to maintain the same level of thinking right through a discussion that too a discussion that is interspered with lots of interferences in the form of time zones, geographical boundaries and other things.   Why, it is difficult for people sitting face to face to continue a discussion for more than two hours. Tell me what end should a topic be discussed.   The Third Law of Online Discussions says "There will be a death of the discussion after a point of time." The corollary says that after such an event, it is not wise to continue a discussion.  If this law is not valid, we would still be discussing about the "which came first, the chicken or the egg?". Hope you get it.  Is it interesting? Maybe we should try a discussion on "the effectiveness of harakiri vis-a-vis other traditional self killing methods" or "the correlation between lunar orbit and the growth of deep-sea anemones". Both seem to be interesting. If Darwin's theory could be brought into context here, you'll find that only the fittest survive or only the interesting threads survive.  The Fourth Law of Discussions (also known as the Law of Threading) states that "discussions will lead to discussions". This discussion is an example.  More after lunch,

       And me too... for a change, travelling almost to Tamil Nadu from Bangalore on a saturday. I mean, coming to office on a saturday... (which is just 15KM from TN border and 20KM from Hosur bus stand). Hope u got the context. Life is another matrix. There are invisible relationships between the many visible elements of life. You always seem to be understanding things but still never understand anything. Hindu philosphy calls precisely this, as "Maya".  The Vedas state that whatever is happening all around is Maya, a dream which Lord Vishnu sees as He sleeps. Maya, as a concept, is both fluid and unstable. It exists but, at the same time, it is fictitious.  This explanation is analogous to The Matrix philosophy, which states that we live in an illusory world and only an unplugged/awake world is the real world. In the movie, Neo, Morpheus and Trinity often leave the real world behind and, by computer wizardry, enter the Matrix. But it is not their physical beings, but their mental projections which fight all the battles. This recalls the Vedanta concept of ‘mithya’, the belief that only the Almighty is real.  As jax put it, Matrix (both parts) abounds with theological references and has a deep profound meaning than what looks at first sight.   Hail Matrix...!!!

      Sorry, couldn't blog much for the past couple of days. I ws very busy working. yes, working after a very long time. Might be doing the same today. Will check the blog often and update if possible.  To understand movies such as The Matrix needs a lot of understanding and concentration.   For example, in Matrix, Neo's room number is 101. Consider it a binary number, 101,. When you translate it into decimal, it becomes 5. The binary series starts with 000, not 001. So the sequence would be 000, 001, 010, 011, 100, 101, 110, 111,..... 101 comes as the sixth element.   Now consider Matrix: Reloaded, Neo is told by the Architect that he is the sixth anomaly. See the connection.   Another example of Matrix's deep meanings, the number plates of the cars used by major characters in the movie are all Bible references. The first two characters consist of the book name, the next two numerals, the chapter name and the last two characters, the quotation name. The quotations are related to the movie context.  Saw "The Matrix" last night. saw only half of the movie. Will be continuing tonight also.  To end a quote from the Matrix: "I can only show you the door; it is up to you to walk through the door" - Morpheus.

      English people are champion whiners... they whine about anything and everything...  they'll like something kinda traditional and very formal stuff. Try to improvise on something and they start cribbing at you.   Well, these are not my views. They were told by Sunil Gavaskar is one of pre-match conferances during the time of Cricket World Cup 1999. Also in the panel were former English players, Allan Lamb and Geoffry Boycott...!!!  No wonder, "Matrix: Reloaded" is a flop there...

        From the pages of our history...    Time: Tuesday, June 11, 2002 Location: CED Campus, Madurai Event: Project Viva   It was almost 4 months after we all had met. The exams got over on Feb 26th and slowly we parted for our project. And it was at this time that we met for once... and for last. The day when the entire class was present. No one was trying to escape out into city bunking the class... after all, we were all waiting our turn into the Audiseshiah hall/Old Lab-IT incubater to take up our viva...  As people walked out with a blushing smile... there were people swarming around him/her and wondering what happened "inside". And some waiting with bated breath and turning the pages of their documentation like the last minute hunting for points to remember during the exam days... Atleast 6 or 7 cameras including one digital,  that were capturing this final moments of an era. Yes, it was never going to happen again. The class to its full strength and everyone raring to have their go...  With some emotional moments also... (well, not quite ;-) ) some tears from a few people's eyes... and looking back they'll now know, how silly they were to cry...  and a final dose of Gowri Ganga and the famed walk thru the railway station... as the sun began to sink for the day... the noises too began to diminish... there were the really emotional touches of bidding adieu to their dearest buddies... just hoping that sometime later in life they might meet again and spend some great time as they did here...  All the world's a stage. It was fortunate for all of us to have played a part together in that scene called MS(IT&M)... and now, we are off to move to the next scene and a new part to play and new persons to play with... But the impact the earlier scene has created on all of us is here to hang on to us for long.  The very fact that there are still so many around to read this expression of mine, seems an indication that the scene is, after all, not over... and that the Part-2 of it is still continuing ... and may it continue for long...

Kishore, if I'm the ruler, who condemned the murderer, i wud have given a fourth option....that room will have "Kishore" in it....there r even chances for the murderer to escape from the other three rooms, but  he can't escape from Kicha's Kadis....  Nothing interesting during the week end other than going for a party...it was a pot leg get together......my contribution was "aloo kofta".....  Guess everybody is going to have a great time in Mahendran's sister's mrg....Have a great time guys....  Nice to see the site summary Xavier  Instead of uploading my photos in the groups album, I've uploaded it in my own briefcase & given rigths for all the blog members. U can have a look at those with ur own yahoo ID's & passwords at  urlLink http://photos.yahoo.com/vallichidambaram    Waiting for ur true comments. For Sindhu most of it wud be a repetition.

      jax, I leave the answer open for further discussions. And about the other query. I'm open to anyone who is interested in active participation. But it shud not become like msitmmb where everyone exists but still no one gives a damn. For example, (with due respects to everyone concerned) sangee's status has been "pending" for quite a while. If joining takes an eternity then I wonder if she wud really be interested to contribute. Someone can please check with her if she's really intersted in participating.  My only point is, the growth in size must not dilute the existing tenacity...

      It is a well-known fact that education is becoming costlier and costlier everyday. Commercialization of education is rampant. I could rant on and on...  Everyday I listen to  FM  radio, the  RJ  would ask a telephone caller (if he is a student, what he would like to be. The answer would a default - doctor or engineer.I have never ever heard another reply, excepting an odd collector.)  Why?...   Because our society places a high premium on these so-called professionals. So everyone is really willing to pay whatever it takes to become one. And when people are willing, who would let go of an opportunity to make a buck or two?   In the end who suffers? People like you and me (like Manny said).   Oops! I forgot about the students. they are really a pitiable group. They spend so much on getting a professional qualification while losing out on thier education. How else could they pay thier debts other than turn to fleecing people out of thier money.   The next time I hear someone say thier child wants to become an engineer or a doctor, I am surely gonna give them a piece of my mind.   But it would be wrong to compare our education with the ones in Europe and US. There people know that they have to know something else in addition to thier professional qualifications.  That is what that makes them be on top. During the recent dotcom burst, we in India cry hoarse over the nr. of s/w pros sent out. How did the average US s/w pro fired at the same time take it? He would have gone out searching for any knick-knack jobs that came his way till the tide turned. How did he bear things out? Because he might have learned it from childhood that education alone doesn't count in life. I guess you might know what counts here more.   Bye for now.

      Hey jax, whatever u r doing... Half of ur previous post is coming with a "Strikeout" style... Archives could be a drop down box, and I feel 50% is less space for posts.. may be it should be 70% the least. After all, thats our primary area of concern, the others are value additions... But am not sure if any other part will be affected on increasing this size... suggest, atleast try to increase to a more possible extent... and also one more good thing would be name at the top like "Jax says...", that really adds flavor to the blog...  The Rock says... If u smellllllallalalala... what the rock... iiiisss cookin....

      Hi,  Regarding the blog layout I more or less feel the same as Ranjini.  The archives section - I think it's better to have that as a list box. Imagine if you have some 100 archivves, the whole page will be like flooded with archives section alone.  About All in a Day's work and Archives box looks too colorful (bright yellow). The blank space after Archives box also looks a bit odd.  We can have a single background color for the whole layout instead of 2 colors for the RHS of blog. I feel the part which contains the blog title shd have some background color as well.  will continue later... bye

      Hi,   Color : Getting a right colour combination is a headache. As I had said, there will be corrections to the blog now and then. The older one was nice with just grey and white. Stil trying out various colour combinations. if you out there know of any good colour combinations, help me out.    Font : The font used for the title is "trebuchet ms, times new roman, monospace". I agree Monotype Corsiva would look superb for the title. But the problem is a MTC is a cursive font, which not many systems came installed with. That's why generic fonts have been used. Anyway I'll try to add it to the title. If someone doesn't have MTC installed, then they will have to adjust with trebuchet ms or times new roman or monospace.   -    Fixed.     Font spacing in title : I'll try adjusting the letter spacing a little bit.  -    Fixed.    Empty space : The space after Menu box is intentional. It is present to allow resizing of the window to any size. The size of the boxes are as follows: Blog content: 50%, First sidebar (the one with the Archives section): 30%, The second sidebar (Menu, Info..): 18%. It adds upto 98%. The remaining 2% includes the empty space + paddings and margins for the other boxes.  If you still don't like it, then you've got to talk to Bill Gates and ask him to improve CSS support in IE.     Layout : The Layout used is known as a "Liquid layout". If I start explain about it, I would be going on and on. So the best place would be Google. Try searching for "liquid layout" including the quotes.  But remember that this layout is not 100% liquid. It will liquidise upto a certain limit only.  BTW, today Google has launched its India specific version @  urlLink  Google India  .   Horizontal Scrollbar : About searching for the horizontal scrollbar, it is really funny if that happened. But the above liquid layout information might explain it better.   Borders : Regarding borders for the boxes, If it is not present it gives an appearance of patches all over the blog. so it is required. Also the different color is my fault, I forgot to change the colour of the Archives sidebar.    Green : It's true about the green colour. I'll look into it.  -    Fixed.    Blog content being cornered : Actually it is not. AS said earlier, the blog content takes 50% of your screen space. I don't think it has been cornered. I woulld say that it is dominating.   Centered layout : I started with the centered layout, but later on changed my mind. I wanted to put the blog content on the rightmost side, but decided against it.   Menu : Menus ought to work in almost all browsers. I hope you aren't using  NN4 . It might also be that the corresponding link is being displayed on the screen. Try hitting Alt+C+Enter. Does a new mail window popup? If not, inform me, I'll look into it. The best way to check out the menu is ensure that the item you need is not on the screen and then use the access keys to navigate to that module. Say you go to the bottom of the page and then hit Alt+A+Enter, the screen should focus on the About Box.    Ad appearing on the top : If someone sends me USD 15 every year, I can remove the ad from there. More details: visit  here . Sorry, nothing can be done about it right now.   Viewing source code : Try again... If you still can't see the source code, log into blogger and click on the Template button and then the Main Template button. You still got admin privileges. Copy the template to a text file locally. I've explained a few things in the template. Go ahead and take a look at it. But please don't make any changes to the template.    Counters : There were two counters on the page earlier, One showed the visitors to the page. It was present in the Info box. It is still there the last time I looked. The other gave statistics and other details. I didn't copy it to the new layout. It will be done soon as soon as I get the source code for it.   Thanks for spending your time picking apart the blog and sending your suggestions, I'll try to implement as much as I could after getting everyone's suggestions and ideas.

      Right from the beginning and still now the education system in India has been tailored with the “One size fits all” kind of attitude, which no longer works well with the emerging global competition. This might be due to the huge population we have which prevents us from customizing the education system according to the talents of the individual. The student was restricted with limited number of choices and he has to go with what he gets…irrespective of his/her likes or dislikes. And this leads people who want something more on education to look around other countries for more prospects.   For instance, there are more than 20.000 plus vacant seats in engineering colleges in our state alone. This does not mean that there are no people to opt for these courses. Rather there are hell lot of other factors such as the quality of education in these institutions and the infrastructure as well. Anna University has summoned 40 engineering colleges which don’t have the required infrastructure to make it up to the mark, that u all shud be aware of…  This clearly sends a message that, the education in India is not only lagging in its value but also being commercialized. For that matter, our government has granted permission to private medical colleges and the fees per year for a medical student is figured out to be around 80k. so for five years it comes around 4 lacs. This is something which a poor or middle class people cant afford to…I feel. But I don’t get into the details of which government gave this permission and what’s the deal that went on behind the screens…at last its we who are going to suffer from the treatment going to be offered by these half made up doctors who might come out of these private medical colleges with an MBBS degree which they will get out of the money they have…ha ha.  So, be prepared to go thru a newly constructed bridge that might collapse while u are passing by it and be prepared to secure your kidneys from doctors who might come out of private medical colleges…ha ha. Ok cutys…bye bye.

      dear jax,   here is what i felt about the new layout. Its not as impressive as the old one. But since u have tried to inject color i do agree that it will take time to aclimatise that look.  But here are few suggestions from me regarding the layout.   1. The font of All in a day's work (the title pane) is not so appealing. Please change it. It can be any one of Arial, Times New Roman, Comic Sans, Book man old style or Monotype corsiva. My vote is always for the MTC which is a bit curvical , but since all our other fonts are in straight alphabet facetype, i dont know how appealing it will look. Anyway try for various combinations and see. But change this font. I feel the spacing between the character's is more and they look hefty and short.   2. The boxes in which u are trying to fit things, doesnt appeal me. The space after the Menu box gave me an impression that the site spans horizontally beyond that box and so made me search for  Horizontal scroll bar. This can be avoided, if the box is eliminated and left free. As the background u have given differs for different boxes, i dont think its necessary to have borders outside every thing.   3.That green color is a bit fluorescent and so its brightness can be reduced to make the site have a much soothing look.  4. And what is this, it seems as if the blog content is cornered. Oram kattita maathiri oru feeling. May be , its becoz of the earlier layout, i am having this. but i was comfortable with earlier layout than this. So try if u could center it, which is the center for this site too.   5. Menus are not working in my page here. What could be the problem?  6. Cant we block the ad which appears at the top of the page? or cant we position it else where?  7. Why cant i view the source?  8. What happened to the vistiors track?  Ok got some work now, will get back to u when i am free Ranjini

      So things to be done:    Leave some space for the blog entry   Add name of the poster   Bios have to be put up   As for point nr. 1: I feel that the space does seem ideal, it covers 50% of the screen space. I can extend it to 60%, not more than that. Anything more than that will lead to single line posts in higher resolutions.   Currently, I was experimenting to bring the menu section to the top, below the Blog Title. Almost over, I am checking it out for browser compatibility.  BTW, have you tried out the  access key  facility for the menu, to go to the "Info" box, you can just press 'Alt' + 'I' and Enter key. That's all. Faster moving around the blog for you... This is done through  XHTML .  Ram, regarding the blogrolling section, as it used Javascript and took time to load, I removed it. If required, I can add it anytime you need it.  Can you think of something else to put in the blog other than what was there in the earlier layout? Something new.  Vijay, about Ajayan and Bala and also Kathu, I had sent them an invite to them long ago. I have not received a reply till now. So today I have resent the invitations. So someone, please help them to go through the proper procedures. What happenned to Sangeetha? She has accepted the invite, but not a single post from her yet. Could someone at Chennai look into it?   A request : Please don't use too many line breaks in your post. It adds no value to your message. A one line space is ok between paras. But don't overdo it. Also please reduce the the line breaks after the end of your message. You all know that even a single space occupies the same memory space as a single character. So use lots and lots of alphabets, not empty spaces, except when required.  P.S. Don'tpostmessageslikethistoavoidspacesandconservememoryspace. Bye for now,

      Yeah, I'll keep that in mind.   Suggestion 1:  Allow more space for the blog posts.  Working offline on the template was useful, but some issues like proper linking of the posts have to be tried out online. So I'll be working on the layout as days go by.  Try finding out errrors if you can and also suggestions to improve it.

      Kicha,   I don't seem to find any problem in accessing the blog. Can you give a more specific detail. It even works in Mozilla too sans problems.   Please try once again and let me know. It could've been that you accessed the page while I was fiddling with the template.   Bye,

      yeah, you are right jax. All those phrases not only mean the same thing but also convey the same meaning. Its only redundant and repeating over and over, again and again without adding much meaning to the meaning...  hee...heee...

      I couldn't read the Rediff news as it is blocked at office. So could Kicha just mail the news item to me at my postmark mail id, not to my office id. I'ld be able to give my views then.   Does  college-time non-serious laid-back  activities have any significant impact on someone who really has the potential to make it big"...    Kicha, how many adjectives (that too hyphenated) are you using in tha bove sentence? Doesn't 'non-serious' & 'laid-back' more or less convey the same meaning. As you had posted about education, I feel we should be able to implement it also. More later...  Busy validating the blog template as  XHTML ...

      We have some new topic to discuss now. This is in the lines of the article sent by Mahendran. All of us have completed our rounds of preliminary education...  I call it preliminary, because some may still have some plans of doing some course (as Valli does), but the fact that we are PGs lends enough to justify that we are done with the requisites. Having gone through so many phases what do u feel of our education system.  Dr.Ravichandran, once told in our class that "we are NOT serious about education" because if we were really serious we would atleast make sure we are inside the class before it begins... And we know how we did our MS degree...   My question is, "Does college-time non-serious laid-back activities have any significant impact on someone who really has the potential to make it big"... Can we say that every person WILL reach the maximum extent to which his potential can take irrespective of how/where he/she studies. Political factors have a major influence often.. but what apart from that... Is our education system really flawed...

      I would like to place a humble request in general to everybody and I don’t tell this to rajesh alone…but of course this time I am saying this to rajesh in particular…  Rajesh u can have your favor towards a particular political leader and u can be a sincere admirer of any personality for that matter…I don’t have anything to do with ur right to be so….  But for god’s sake, stop calling anybody with the word “AMMA” who don’t deserve to be called so…because no relation in this world is as serene and divine as your mother and its my humble suggestion that no one in this world cud be called AMMA unless she deserves it…and I feel that our CM don’t deserve to be called so. I don’t want to get further into describing her past for that matter which u all know obviously…there is a huge group of politicians all around who ought to call her AMMA…and we are not the ones to do so…  This is my request to all others also who are used to call her so… This is my personal opinion and I again reiterate that its only my request to u all…and don’t get this matter hard in u…ok. Bye bye...

      Its quite true that the mother tongue is the most comfortable medium for communication. No doubt each of us feel more confortable in Tamil. But the only point is, the current state where the world is moving to, forces us to use a foreign langueage just because it is going to play a big role in earning the livelihood for many people. But having said that, if u r not living in Tamil Nadu... tell me honestly... haven't u felt a new found enthusisam when u get a Tamil counterpart - a colleague or a room-mate or a friend... doesn't ur face give a quick little smile when u see a vehicle with TN registration... and if u r not in India llike sindu and Valli... the word "tamil" always gives pleasure as its so scarce that they come across this...  Even though, driven by circumstances, we are forced to use English in a lot of places that provide us the daily bread.. its always a passion and a mark of pride when it comes to interacting in Tamil... u will understand that better if u r outside Tamil Nadu... and even better if u r outside the country...

      Hi all, glad getting back to u all this time. I just want to say one thing and wind off...  Once prof. Ravichandran in our Marketing class, while trying to clarify a doubt, started out with a real life example...and before giving that example...he uttered these words to the class...it went like... "Though i feel comfortable with my english, i always prefer to speak in tamil as it gives me the feeling of completeness and i would be able to bring in my expressions and thoughts in a more lively manner..."  and he continued his lecture in tamil...  thats what I too feel...that is, language is something that has become a part of urself... for me when it comes to the matter of language... Always THAMIZH stands first... irrespective of the other reasons such as competitiveness and Global convergence...for which we ought to be prepared...Thamizh is my mother tongue thru which i started perceiving things in this world...  And yes...of course...English and other languages are always going to be there...which we cannot ignore...and get along with this world.  In short  Vaalga Thamizh...Valarga Em Makkal...  And regarding Ms.J's so called bold initiatives...  I do agree that strikes shud not be encouraged... but I wont accept the mass dismissal of 1 lac + employees in a messy manner and i wont accept the midnight arrests and harasments done to the Trade union office bearers as well...  Our chief minister says that when the 98 percent of the population is facing the financial problem, the 2 percent govt employees also shud bear with the cost cutting measures...  I cant find any rationale in this argument... i dont know how she was going to devote the money saved from cutting off the privileges of the employyees, for the upliftment of the 98 pecent of the state's population.  Ok...these things are beyond my scope and concern and out of my control for that matter. my wishes are not going to have any impacts over the happenings...so let me be a passive listener wrt this discussion. bye bye tamils...!!!  And this is for Jax: Machan...here are the details and fee structure...   Admission Procedure for the certificate course in Technical Writing  Entrance Test  The admission will be based on an entrance test covering  1. English Language proficiency  2. General Aptitude  3.

Batch Patterns  Part Time – Morning – 7.00 AM – 9.00 AM (Monday – Friday) Part Time – Evening – 6.30 PM – 8.30 PM (Monday – Friday)  Full Time – 9.30 AM – 6.00 PM (Lunch Break 1.30 – 2 PM) (Monday – Friday)  Enrolment   Students enrolled to the program will have to fill in the application form and provide 2 stamp size photograph  Fee Detail  Full Time – Rs.16,000/- To be paid in one lump sum  Part Time –if paid in one lump sum Rs.18,000/-  (or) if Paid In Installment  Rs.9000/- down payment Rs.5000/- after 30 days of the commencement of the course Rs.5000/- after 60 days of the commencement of the course  The fee has to be paid during the time of enrolment The fee can be paid either by Cash / DD / Local Cheque payable to “K9 Technologies Pvt Ltd” Fees once paid will not be refunded Fees has to be paid at our office on any working day between 10.00 AM and 5.00 PM  Hope to get back to u all soon with a more lively discussion on a really useful discussion that leads to some concrete efforts which we can make for our overall development in career and life as well. (But i dont mean that this is a useless discussion rather...cutys!!!)

      hi,       So the discussion is stil llive??!!! it's getting a new dimension....Anyway, answering to Ram's "r u really happy with only that package"......i don't think, i can give an one line answer for this question....this can be a whole lot of another discussion, as Xavier had mentioned......what all do u need to lead a happy life?...Let me recollect Maslow's hierarchy theory......physiological, safety, social, esteem, self-actualisation needs.......Let us omit the last option for now.... we still have a long way to go for that wise & mature need....Let me try to list a set of factors kindling the other four needs.....the prominent factors i can think of are  basic needs(food, shelter, clothing), security, love(need to be needed), belongingness, motivation, self-respect, recognition. Basic needs & security are highly dependent on one's financial soundness...though the other factors are still there, remember that we can proceed to those needs  only if the primary ones are satisfied.....& for the other needs too, money is an indirect factor.......i don't deny that there are things other than money,  one will need in life ....i miss my parents so much.....but that's life.....one fine day,  nee polaippai  thedi poi dhaan aaganum......Twenty or twenty five yrs from now, my kids'll will fly off from my nest......that's nature.....I still have lots & lots of thoughts going round my head abt this....tried hard to make my humble views shorter.....need to go now...  need to mention this.......Bravo to our Chief Minister Dr.J.J!!.....bold decision, firm actions.....accomplished her thoughts.....strikes are in no way to be encouraged, strikes are not solutions for problems.....though it seems to be a bit rude, this's the right tonic...medicines have always been sour & at those times doctors have always been villains, but the underlying truth is, it's for the goodness of our health...  see you guys...... happy weekend.

      Jayalalitha is a different person altogether. After the tactical blunder of the arrest of arch-rival M Karunanidhi in full view of television lights, the chief minister of Tamil Nadu seems to have bested her rivals in strategic power plays. She gave them  rope , without herself taking any initiatives, and they have hanged themselves through infighting and confusion. In particular, Karunanidhi's DMK looks like a bloodied and punch-drunk boxer who took one too many hit to the head.  Read the complete article from  urlLink News u must read

      I was on leave yesterday. So I couldn't support or refute a few points said in past few days.   Nice to see a lot of good points being brought up by everyone...  To Valli, Good to hear that you had chosen Spanish, the second most spoken language in the mainland USA. Maybe we can have a conversation in Spanish sometime, Señora.  My apologies, if my post had given an impression that NRIs are not contributing to the Indian society.   As you have said, it is true that the salary is more on the other side of the fence. I wouldn't refute it. It is also true that the salaries here are not on par with the salaries there. People here too are earning that much, even freshers. But an important point that you might not have considered is the conversion rate for a US$ to INR. That is the only thing that generates the revenue. I think this topic of working in foreign lands or motherland looks good for a discussion.   As for Tamil language, it is my mother tongue. I am proud of it. As for speaking in Tamil in public, I never have found it difficult. Yeah, there are times when I find it difficult to write in Tamil. It is mostly due to my  wonderful  handwriting ( you people might know that ). I cannot understand or recognize a single character of what I have written in Tamil, whereas somehow I can understand my handwriting in English very well. That's why I use English most often, not for me but for others to understand.   Reg. Kavi's post, " They practice it here..that’s it ." You are right in saying that everyone wants to go abroad and earn. So they are practicing it here. But there are some things and certain customs that you can never practice here in India.   Rajesh had wanted everyone to talk in Tamil. But there are a few words in each language that has no equivalent in the other or a ambigious meaning. Words like Love has different connotations in English whereas Tamil has various words to express it. I don't think no one uses the word " Kanipori " whenever he wants to say 'Computer' or " Innya Thalam " for "Internet". So I don't think we need to follow Linguistic Tamil in our day to day life. It is just that we limit the words alien to Tamil to a minimum.   In fact the one thing that irritates me while speaking to with a person is a person frequently shifting languages. They speak a few lines in English, suddenly they switch to Tamil. Then again they switch back to English. It really bugs me a lot, just as it did bug Sindhu. When they speak in English, you are forced to speak in English, when they change to Tamil, you are also forced to change to Tamil. I really cannot stand it at all  As Ram had quipped, it is not the language that is important, but the development of the nation that is important. But we can teach our children, speak to our children in Tamil. And it is our duty.  So all said, it's time for me to say  Bye/Vaaren/Ciao/Adios/Auf Wiederhören/Khuda hafiz

       It is believed to be India's first ever campaign to lure Indian ex-pats away from high-tech industries in Silicon Valley.   The glossy brochure promoting the jobs fair in Santa Clara is further evidence of a reversal in the Valley's fortunes.   Its front page boldly declared that "India is Hiring" - the subtext being that Silicon Valley is not.    Read  urlLink full-story .

      I agree rini’s point of view that language is used as a mean of communication. What we are expressing or learning using the language matters a lot. But most of the people will not see language as a medium, it’s been used as a scale or a determining factor for the living style or Aptitude of the person. That’s what influencing people & makes them use English even when you meet someone from your motherland. This might give the person a sense of security that ‘I am also belong to this group..’.   On the other hand, People are paid off in foreign lands&this is a real case. So people out here have desire to go there& earn at one time or other. So it’s mandatory for them to use English in every day life and it’ not just ‘they want to adopt the foreign custom’. It’s a competitive world & everyone has to prove themselves in all the dimension. They practice it here..that’s it. All this contribute to the mindset of a person like ‘using Tamil in public place is a disgrace’.    However It’s important to make our younger generation to learn tamil properly. But it  shudn’t  stop us from exploring a new language. My personal opinion is..It make no sense spending time in translating all the technical stuff from English into some language whether it is japanese or tamil. We can put all the efforts into some meaningful work which can contribute something to our society. If you remember the Time management chart which  Raja sir told in our class..I put this in ‘Not important & Not urgent’ group.  It’s so nice to see a blog from rajesh after a long time. I haven’t seen the mission statement which ram sent. I will see it. See you all in next blog.Bye..

      Good topic in rounds now. I pity Sindu wandering in want of the acquaintance of language in a foreign land. Instead of commenting on other's view, here i present my own view regarding languages.   Language as such was created as a means of communicating when Human beings wanted to advance their way of communication. So as far as Language is concerned i dont have preference for any particular language though i at present i have affinity towards Sanskrit because of its usage in music. Hope u all know my recent interest in Carnatic music. It sounds divine to me. But then it has never stopped me from reading or interacting with people who speak different languages.   Every language is unique in its own nature and its the convienience of usage which matters most. I remember vaguely reading what Bernard shaw said in reply to which English is the best, "The English which can be understood is the best english" It can be made generic and can be applicable to all languages. I have always felt that instead of attaching myself to one particular language let me learn to accept things which are expressed via them.   So be it Sanskrit or Tamil or English or any language, its the content which is transferred signifies most and not the language, which is a mean of transfer. so friends i really feel, i am yet to discover so many excellent master pieces in various languages! Ofcourse i may not be able to master all languages to know how good they are, but ofcourse translated versions will do for me!   This is my humble view!

      Hai All,  Welcome back Rini, Welcome, Thanks a lot for your understanding..... yes a long blog from me....  Coming to Tamil, ofcourse Sindhu is right!!!... But frankly saying Jax is Very correct...... Most of us want Tamil to be everywhere........But none of us are patriotic to Tamilnadu even to India....( IN GENERAL )  We cant compare our patriotism towards the language as like JAPANESE... They are really revolutionist... They have only Japanese as their way of commun. but still doing good, and had entered into developed nation category (as said by kicha) only because of their patriotism.... They have all the technology books available in Japanese... but where come here at TN... We cant even step out of TN within India itself...  Instead of striving hard for language... strive for growth, eradicating illiteracy _ unemployment _ poverty and antisocial activities....  I Feel Hindi can be made compulsory all over India apart from First language and second language till 8th standard...  After completion of SSLC first language is not at all necessary...except for those specialising over that....  But in +1 & +2 there should be debate among students on current topic alternatively in English, first language and Hindi for 1 hour in a daily basis... This will certainly improve their GA as well communication.... (if possible in college also in a weekly basis)  So that they can roam freely all over the world, nation and state cheerfully....  By way we Indians are more complacent & lethargic....I recently read the book "CYCBTH"....(Guesses Please....) Author Arindham Chaudhri... such a fantastic book which speaks about Theory I Management practices which ought to be followed in Indian Orgn.  Yeah Valli U r 100% Right..... But r u really happy with only that package.... if so... (after your reply)  Comming to Prof. Raja Govindsamy's Classes on Mission statements....  Have a look at    urlLink Own a Mission   More later....  Rini, v r ready 4 taste ride but not 4 test ride.... (JK)  Cheers.

To Xavier,  abt his " people have a mindset. They believe that you can be well off only if you go to foreign lands alone."......it's not a belief, it's the fact.... & to be frank, that's the only attractive force which keeps us here......"thirai kadal oodiyum thiraviyam thedu".......If some Indian coy, is willing to give us an equivalent pay cheque, i swear, we'll get back tomorrow itself.....& ideas like, "u r not serving for ur mother nation", are all, junk talks.....It's totally a win-win situation......NRI revenue, is something nobody can deny abt. But i totally agree with your concern for the future generation......yep, they'll surely be confused. It's the sole duty of the parents to clear that confusion....i know poeple who arrange tamil classes for their kids every week end....not just to read & write...but to learn isai tamil, illakiya tamil......& abt the foreign language option....i've decided to take spanish.....which is the second language here.....  poittu vaaaaaraen.....

      Had a quick chat with my PL during snacks this evening... and he asked me "How's it going...", Predictably enough, I said "As monotonous as anything..." and he pipped in saying "Come back soon, I've got some really interesting work for u...!!"   Yeah... I know, anything is gonna be interseting other than this project. My team is developing a framework called SPEED.NET ... It is going to be an out-of-the-box enabler for projects... I mean, it'll have virtually every utility that is needed in any project using Microsoft's Technologies. The bits and pieces for SPEED are being discussed now. My PL told me that I'll also be a significant contributor to SPEED when I get back from this (stupid) project. In fact, he asked me if I'll be able to spare 2 hours everyday amid my project to begin my work on SPEED. But I said that is impossible with this frustratingly ridiculous project.   It seems SPEED will be trademarked by Infy once it gets a concrete shape. So, I could imagine its significance. Just wish I had a time machine that I can rotate and move 1.5 months ahead and start working on SPEED... ;-((

The town I live in...Hinckley....has lots of wiproites, TCS and Infosys...most of them are North Indians and Telugu's.... I was really fed up of talking to them in English with their accent....One fine day I came to know that a tamilian is residing in a nearby place.....that too from madurai......i cudnt resist the temptation to meet her....imdtly I started off to find her house.....didnt even wait for someone to make an introduction.......I barged into her house...hoping to talk in tamil...hear the words im so comfortable in......she greeted me with " hey...where u from??, ooh...from MADRAI!.....U KNOW, I SEE.....".....but the irony is i kept replying her in tamil........atlast she uttered some tamil words...just bcos i was so adamant abt talking in tamil.....i returned home with disappointment and agony!  Now...im plunging into the topic as well....Tamil is our mother tongue...but how many are proud of being a tamilian.....not many.. i am sure there are people out there who think that talking in tamil in a public place or with friends, as a disgrace.....an image spoiler....it has got more or less to do with our obsession for foreign languages.....the problem lies within us....as Xavier said....with our mindset....this has to change.....the future generations should be moulded to give respect for tamil.....at the same time compatible with other cultures and languages as well...  bye.

      Hi guys, Hello to every body out there! Wow i am back to work after my wedding! Days ticked off like seconds.Only 21 seconds? no it was not enough for us. Ya our wedding went on well and we had a nice time feasting and partying with friends and relatives. Good was the entire event with everything going as desired and smooth as my beloved holds my hands for ever!  Yes, all the wedding snaps have come and all our friends are looking good! and ya i am yet to scan the snaps and so you people might need to wait a bit before i upload the pictures! I was happy to see many of the faces which i had seen a year back! Good was the ear ring which our friends had presented! It was a big gang ofcourse throbbing the center stage when they came to gift! Waves of laughter filled the dias with hearty wishes rising from the lips ,colorful handshakes and beaming smiles adulterated with mild tears making the moment more gripping and solid in my memory! Ofcourse it also made me pass a string of thought to all those who werent there but yet were remembering me and sending me love from far where they are! These fond gestures made me feel elated though i had shared only few moments with all of them and dint even have time to tell hi to all the individuals separately. but i could see them how considerate they were to understand me and be with me! Glad and gifted i am to have such a mob of friends. Thank you friends for making me feel so special!   We went to Munnar and came back Sunday morning only.Munnar is really an exotic place for those who love nature! Good was our trip jeweled with fond memories of seeing so many flowers which i thought i might not see at all live in my days! Beautiful was our place of stay and so was my Srini too, competing with nature! To grip those moments, i have wrapped him in photos which are yet to be unwrapped from fotoshop.   Hei guys, from sunday onwards, i have taken up a new venture! Guess what?  Ya i started cooking , first i did Venpongal. I am not afraid, but sometime, my hand trembles a bit for the lack of experience when i add salt or oil........... They say it tasted good. I mean him, his friends, cousins and my friends and cousins. Afternoon i dint cook and we had it outside and for dinner, i prepared chappathi and srini prepared dal. It was tasty too i believe as srini told and so did i tell other friends of his! Anyway cooking comes only by experience. Yet to learn more!  Once learnt i will invite u all for a taste ride! till then its bye for now!

      Hi all,  Interesting to see a discussion after a long time. I certainly agree with Rajesh on many of his points. Yesterday I faced a similar problem only this time; I had to translate from Tamil to English. I found it difficult. I have not completed it yet.   The political parties are making a hue and cry over declaring Tamil a national language. If it is declared so, then will other states start teaching Tamil? Definitely not. Soon we might have 30-35 national languages. Think of the country, already with Hindi as the national language, you and I cannot understand what someone from Bihar is saying or vice versa. I think those in Bang. can explain how it feels to speak Tamil in Karnataka. I really wonder how Valli & Sinduja are faring in an alien land.   As Rajesh had said, it is up to us. But the problem is that people have a mindset. They believe that you can be well off only if you go to foreign lands alone. So, what they do is that they try to adopt foreign customs without understanding what they really mean. But they also want their children to be culturally attached to our values. This creates confusion in minds of children. They don't know what to follow and end up following nothing. They know neither Tamil nor English. I remember a scene from the movie 'Minnale'. Madhavan, Vivek and a few of his friends will be having a thanni party. One of them will start off in English. Then Vivek will ask him to write a leave letter. Hope you remember that scene. It starkly portrays the modern generation. That includes you and me.   I know a lot of Anglo-Indians, lots of close and dear friends. I found out that most of them really follow the values of Tamil culture. They find it better than their own culture.   As for Tamil as a language, No political party can lay claim to it. It belongs to the people.   Bye,  ØÂÕ¿ÀÓ ÀÔ¿Ó   P.S. if the above line appears as junk, it is due to the problems that Tamil faces, just as many dialects being present in Tamil, there are several fonts for Tamil. I remember a few years back, there were talks of creating a unified font for Tamil, I don't know if it has been done yet. If someone knows of it, then we can use it to display a few messages in Tamil. The above line is my sign in Tamil. Bye, expecting other views from everyone.

      Politics apart... the times have changed from what it was in the earlier days. Competition is at its peak. It all depends how much versatile u could show urself off (even if u aren't that much)... Knowledge and the perceived importance of English is not just a question of knowing "one more" language but a mandatory one.   With due respects to the mother-tongue, there's always a comparison with countries like Japan where English knowledge is scarce but still they are growing and are more respected economies than India. But one thing we must remember is that we did not have the same past nor a similar present. We have been dependent on the West for most of our past, and continue to do so. Some industries (like the Hardware ones) are well established there and they are the most respected manufacturers in the world. But India lacks the infrastructure to be as big in many of areas owing a lot to lower levels of education, poverty etc etc... the never ending list...  So, atleast as far as the current scenario goes (which is likely to extend atleast for a few decades) we cannot afford to take our own stand simply because we are still a dependent nation to a very significant extent...

      dear friends    i have been a passive participant in this blogger for a long time ,that is because of my tight schedule where im moving between bangalore ,chennai and madurai.since i have a very less time to browse ,i usually read the bloggs and logout.but now since valli brought a discussion regarding tamil i'm now spending some time in replying for that.   regarding vallis words" shld complain abt this to Rajesh's edhiri katchi (who's struggling hard to make tamil as the first lang for the entire schooling for the future generations).....what do u guys think abt that?....", i will particularly and strongly say that the party which valli is mentioning has not done anything in interest of tamil people. They kindled the feelings of tamil society in 1960's and just used that to convert thier movement (neethi katchi) as a political party (DMK) and gained political mileage out of that.    They protested the entry of hindi and saying that they had spoilled our tamil community. Like students from other parts of the country we dont have the courage to move or relocate ourself to any part of the country.Our generation is totally spoilled by their political stance.I guess that the next generation would be competive enough like any other in our country.It doesnt mean that evryone should study everything in tamil here to make it grow.    The  growth of a language depends on the growth of the society which uses that language and so the so called move made by Karunanidhi doesnt sound sensible.so i strongly condemn the usage of words "who's struggling hard " in vallis blog.    And regarding the growth of tamil i do consider it as a serious problem that is to be addressed personally by us. just try if u can exactly translate and write one page of a english business correspondance to tamil? i can surely say that its not possible.   i faced the problem when one of our cute lady customer in our browsing centre asked me a help .i struggled for hours and finished it (exactly because of the mental motivation provided by that cute girl).but i felt bad for not able to translate one letter in my mother tongue.   our generation is not able to speak or write in tamil without using some english words in it.we have to try this from us and then we have to teach our children ,the art of using tamil and only tamil.(valli and sindu has an early chance to implement this ).we have to stop using english words when we are speaking informally.   remember tamil has crossed lot of boundaries and still it has adopted accordingly and so i beleive that this language which is the oldest and finest never die, because           "TAMILUKKUM AMUDHENDRU PEIR           ANTHA TAMIL ENGAL UYIRUKKUM MEL"  I thank valli for starting this politiced topic which provoked me to blog now.  general  im in chennai now and this sunday i met bala,vijay ,ganesh ,ajayan and manny here.we enjoyed a lot and there is good film "KADHAL KONDEIN" which deserves to be awarded the best .so if possible ,try to see that film and share your views in this blogger.  bye  rajesh  Dr.PURATCHI THALAIVI AMMA VALGHA

      Valli, "tempora mutantor et nos in illis", Anyway the blog design is almost three months old. I am planning to put something more colorful here with your help (all bloggers).   Regarding the information I put on the blog, i just visit a couple of sites and follow links from there onwards. A similar method is given explained  urlLink here .   Valli, you can't expect Tamil to be present everywhere? "Engum Tamil, Edhilum Tamil" is a just a empty election promise, which takes no one any where. BTW if you are to opt for a language of your choice, choose something like French (atleast you will be able to read the menus in the swank restaturants) or Japanese (You might improve your drawing skills).   urlLink Quod scripsi, scripsi  is just a reflection of my mood on that that day. I just compose it on my way to work. Select an apt phrase for it and then blog it when I get some time.  I think it is a good barometer of my thoughts during the previous day. That's all. You can add your comments on it, I won't mind any type of comments on it from my friends. If you feel anything is not agreeable to you, you can post your comments there. But don't post it here please.  have a  stormy  weekend there.  All of you, have a nice weekend.  P.S. I'll be online tomorrow around 12:00 IST. Hope to catch someone online then. Rini'll be joining us on Monday, I hope.

      Here's a sample lyric from the song "dating" in "Boyz" film...   Boy:  D-A-T-I-N-G... u and me were meant to be...yeah...I can clearly see...dating is a fantasy...  Gal:  Aiyyo.. love is full of pain... poda love is just a strain...  Boy:  Frienship enbadhu RAC.. Love confirm panna ni yosi...  Gal:  Friendship enbadhu full safety.. love 'il yedhu guarentee...   Boy:  Do u know I've been thinking all abt u, and I really want to know if u love me too...will u let me know that my heart is true... babe...when I see ur face I wanna be with u...   Gal:  Muga naga natpathu natpalla nejath aga naga natpadhu natpaagum...karka kasadara karpavai katrapin maraka cheivadhu love aagum...  doesn't it sound very different compared to our usual songs..?? Its sounds even better with the music...  Listen and Enjoy...

      My project is driving me crazy. The architecting and designing was done before I was assigned to this project. Now, I don't get head or tails of how to go about my coding... they've asked me to code a screen in ASP.NET ... but haven't told anything abt the dependencies like tables etc., I have to go thru the design doc and understand that... the doc runs into reams of pages... I'm struggling with it... the client timelines is also unrealistic (as in any project)...  I had a talk with my PL this afternoon (my "actual" PL... not the project's PL), and expressed my anguish to him... and said "I'm really struggling...". He coolly said "I want u to get that experience...!!" I asked him to pull me back after coding gets over and not to keep me there until delivery... He told "complete the coding... we'll see..."  But, I'm not the only one sturggling in the project... today the client has told to use a tool called Xpresso which, it seems, is for accessing DB... but the trouble is that Xpresso is compatible ONLY with Java... so, if the client confirms this then the whole project will have to be re-done in Java... in that case, I'll escape... coz I cannot be involved for Java coding...  :))  just hoping that happens... ;-))

      Fixed the archives. But as the Members box has been moved to the L.H.S. and the bios get displayed in the R.H.S., there might be some minor positioning issues in the bio display. Any way wait for a more colourful version of the blog soon.  Those who didn't understand LHS and RHS, ask Ram.  Awaitng posts from Sindhu, Manny and Rajesh. Long time since they posted.

Ram, read your comments. I'll be updating that with one post everyday. So be sure to visit it everyday.  News: Netscape is officially closed. There will be no more newer versions of IE Mac and IE Win (till Longhorn). Yahoo opens centre in India.

      Ganesh, If u want to share with 45, no probs carry on.... But dont make data redundant coz we (11) belong to that 45 also.... hence we dont want to see & get bored with the same messgs. also v wont abuse u saying u r not bloging at all...  Frankly saying, no one is forced to blog / post mesggs in grp.., if u can, u make it, else no probs, whoever makes it, u enjoy....  By way, whoever is making should not expect that others should make it.....  (2 Kicha...., Jax ur words slightly modified) according to my opinion.....  Then regarding that Link JAX.... u can download the package (Claroline 1.4.2 If I am Right) and u can upload those in free websites like geocities..... and start ur own web course....  thatz what they mean...   U try in the demo version, if u like it, or if u want some modification, download the PHP scripts, make changes upload in your own site... start providing webcourse,  I agree that its is a tedious process, if u can find time, Try it out... Pl. feel free to contact me for any help.... I will be very free to refuse also (ha ha ha heeeeheeeheee)  Maadi is kannada for tamil (Pannnunga....)

      Dear Ram, Thanks for the link, da. I had already visited the site yesterday morning itself. The trouble is that they say the demo (which is free) will be removed without notification. So I am hesitant about maybe starting a class on it.   BTW what does your last line mean? I couldn't understand it.   I would say that both Kicha and Ganja are right in certain aspects of thier arguments. But still I would repeat what Kicha had said about reciprocivity. It makes a quite a lot of difference in understanding  the other person. It should be more of a give and take policy.

      Hi, ganesh's view that we might like to share some things with 45 rather than 11 and that everyone wud have enjoyed reading some posts like my narration is acceptable. But, my point is, when only 4 or 5 are intersted in sharing such information with everyone while the other people remain passive, it provides no boost to people like me to put up something... atleast, people must let know they enjoy certain things. We can't go on assuming everything and keep posting when there is no reciprocation from the other side...  Reciprocity is a very vital factor... as a STS ganesh will know better about that...

      hi  thanx for ur views. i did not mean to say that we should repeat everything in the blog in the group also.i also agree that many will not be interested in some issues as jax said.  but there r some things i think which can be put in the group (eg.kicha's narration of his stay in chennai). but it all depends on the individual and as kicha had said he might not be intersted because of lack of participation in the group.  but the important thing is others in the groups r missing certain information which is of relevance to all of us in the class(see if kicha had put his narration in the group many would have enjoyed reading it even though they r silent members of the group)   i think u all will agree that we all want to share some information with 45 of us(atleast half of it hehehehe) rather than 11.  so these r my views reg this issue.   bye

      Just hearing songs of Boyz film. I've got the songs in my system here. Very good... the songs are pretty different.. a lot of college flavor in the song... with a tinge of western-urban touch...  the songs are named like "Ale Ale", "Boom Boom","break the rules","Secret of success", "dating", "girl friend" ... so that gives an idea of wat we cud expect...   especially the song "dating" is tooooo goood.... the song "boom boom" is sung by Adnan Sami...

      Kicha, but it is also true that we bloggers have reduced our postings to the group. You also have accepted it. I have been seeing Ganesh and others post regularly to the group (in the recent past).  I feel that the matter of relevance is very important.   I suppose not many in the group will be interested in knowing that Microsoft has stopped development of IE, both Mac and Win versions or that Mozilla is better fro browsing than IE. To them, news like the above might be irrelevant. I don't know if any of the bloggers also feel so. Additionally, we forget that the blog does not occupy any space in our system, but the mails to the group consume a lot of space in your mailbox.   Looks like start of a new discussion, I like this.

      I too support Ram's view. group and blog are two different entities... but if we feel that the information we want to convey need to reach everyone then he/she might post the same thing in both places... only thing is that for bloggers it wud be redundant.. but generally speaking, I don't see any reason why we need to post in both places just because people are not mailing to groups.   I used to send atleast some forwards to the groups regularly until not so long back, but now-a-days I've stopped that (almost) as I'm beginning to lose interest due to lack of any participation. But bloggers have been giving active participation right thru and it ain't any surprise that I'm still maintaining the same energy that I had when the blog consisted of only 4 members.   Very often we find people who have not posted for quite a while starting with a quick apology for being a bit passive. That speaks more of the interest they have in blogging...  Obviously, groups and blog are different entities...  PS: strictly personal opinion. No generalization...

      Ganesh, I think Ram was trying to say to you that you need not post messages that you have sent to msitmmb. But I disagree that we have stopped mailing to the group after the blog. Some things that are related to the msitmmb group should be posted there. Things that are informative to the blog must be posted here. It should be the reverse. Dei, Ganja, you are into marketing, that too at CP, you should know segmentation and niche markets.   Great to hear from Valli again. Valli, I invited Kathu to the blog, she has not respoded yet. Sangeeis also not responding.  Manny, no news from you, send the address of Ajayan and Bala for inclusion.

      hi all,  sorry guys....thoug i've not been actively participating for a week, i was a silent listener.....  nice to hear that Kicha's heart had no space to pump blood, & his nose cud'nt inhale & exhale for a few minutes. But the saddest part is, he's still alive!!!    Hey Sindhu, unnudan, andha Salem rowdy college, pisaasu dept la padicha adhae Madhu dhaan di....Kicha do u know that this Madhu has joined Infy?...  We are planning our visit to India....though not sure, it might probably, be Jan 2004. I'll be coming 2 months before Ganesh.....In that case i'll not register for any courses in Spring.....These plans are highly susceptible to changes.....  This weekend is Vinitha's reception....guess she'll be having a great time.......her parents are here for the occasion.....  Nothing interesting happened last weekend, other than the phone call with my parents......happened to get "samy" movie, after a long time....everytime we go to the Indian store, he used to say, that it's checked out....never cooked...saturday, it was an Indian restaurant...sunday, it was a mexican restaurant....  Tried cooking Turkey(vaan koli) yesterday.....Ganesh only knows abt the taste.....I guess it did turn out quiet good.....that's what Ganesh said....  Are the photos taken at Rini's mrg, processed????.....there are many of us awaiting to see 'em.....  bye...

      Read this informative article from evolt.org. It is about the urlLink Browser Wars .  Thinking about it, I feel that there are some truths in the article for web users like us.

      Hi, Out into the deep for a whole long week. Friday of the week-before, boarded the traditional Tuticorin express to madurai along with Rajesh, Swetha and her sister Sonia (sans "Antonio Mano")...   Saturday 5-7: Got a TV at my house. Samsung Plano Bio with 300 watts output...   Sunday 6-7: At rini's marriage. Met a lot of our friends. Covered by a few nostalgic tears, we went to Gowri Ganga that night for dinner before I sent off the chennai people in Pandian Exp.  Monday 7-7: Slept almost the whole day. The only time of the dayt I didn't sleep was when I was taking bath and doing some other indispensable chores.  Tuesday 8-7: Boarded Pandian Exp. Last time I boarded the train was when I went to take up the infy test... more nostalgia...  Wednesday 9-7: Landed in Chennai and off to VisBabu's house to wake him, bala and ajayan. Remined me of "Sangeeth" days when I wake them all up at 6AM...  Thursday 10-7: Went to attend a marriage. Ate heartily. The only  trouble was it was so hearty that there was no place for my heart to pump out blood...  Friday 11-7: Dragged bala and ajayan to Infy's Chennai Development Center. The last time I walked in there was for my interview... this time it felt awfully ecstatic to walk in righteosly... more reasons to be nastalgic. I met all my training batchmates. This time the trouble was that, the nostalgia was so much that my nose had even forgotten to leave out a few breaths of air. So, all the air accumulated inside my tummy. They got acted by some MealBananoCokicDewic acid and my tummy was proactive enough to flush out all the DiHydrogen Monoxide in differnt colors and odours. This celestial phenomenon needed a tablet shaped tablet and some holy water to take a detour.   (whatever u understood don't ask me to explain this in simple  words...) ;-)))  Saturday 12-7: Went to The Beach. Cudn't find any Leonardo DiCaprios, But were able to see some Titanics and many Kate Winsletts (esp. one yellow tintedly dressed one)  Sunday 13-7: Met Ganja and Rajesh and went to "Kaadhal Konden" film. An avial of Darr and Aalavandhan, but better much much than the latter... and boarded the Banagalore mail along with other mails and reached here this early morning... and just finished typing my post to the blog... and now on to the post...  Hi, Out into the deep for a (...etc.....etc.......etc......etc....).......

      Hi Jax,  The new layout and updates on bio etc.. are good and fine....  But I face an issue.. i.e, whatever u have typed from the new layout is not visible for me as such.... at times it is visible... But mostly I have to select the text for seeing the content.... Whether its the problem with My I.E or anything else.... or anyone else face the same issue....  By way where do u have options to design the layout of the blog page in the blogger....  Cheers Ram

      Yeah, got a little busy visiting a few clients. No post from me because I was thinking of creating  a new layout for the blog. So I got caught up with some experimentations. I saw a wonderful  urlLink site  a few days back. I'm using it as an inspiration. Let see how it comes out. Your suggestions for the layout are welcome. If you come across a nice website (in terms of design and layout), blog it. No sites using Flash. please.   Manny, send me the mail ids of Ajayan and Bala (the ids they use most frequently).   Update : Members bio.

(IT&M) and after spending more than a year in this course, itâ€™s not the time to feel bad abt your mistakesâ€¦ha haâ€¦so think accordingly and try to find a good Koli who can offer a job for usâ€¦(just kiddingâ€¦but this is the fact tooâ€¦oooh!huh!)  BTW...I wish u all a "Happpy Ganesh Chaturthi". May Lord Ganesh Bless u all.

      Hi all,  I have modified the blog to use an external stylesheet. The advantage is that now everyone can choose the type of layout they like. The blog will be displayed in the layout they want. Currently, I am trying to design a couple of layouts. I'll let you know when they are ready.   Bye,  Rajesh: I deleted the extra post of yours.

      Wonderful of you to bing out a topic for discussion. The question looks simple, but the answer isn't that simple. The more I get to think about your question, the more complex the situation becomes.   As I had quipped yesterday, if I had the chance to speak to our juniors, I would have stressed upon:     Know your core competencies  - You have to concentrate on what you do best or like doing best. Some might be interested in moving up in the IT segment and some in management.     Improve them  - Once you have identified your competencies, try to orient yourself towards it. Learn more about the areas where you would be best suited to.    Prepare a resume in line with your competencies  - Most people try coping a resume format from others. Break away from that line of thinking. Sit down and think of the job you are applying for. Write down what aspects of that job you are suited to. Prepare a resume that tells the employer that you are the best person to do the jo the job     More on this later.

      I hereby strongly condemn Mrs.Valliyammai for misleading the bloggers by using the words " beautiful young girl" for herself. I also condemn the attitude of imposing a non-real and impossible thing(valliammai can never become a beautiful girl ,which the whole world knows) into the general public who are using the blogger.I also warn her not to involve herself in any such activities in future,which on violation would be met legally.

      Manny, thanx for the ids.....muluchikko, olunga velaya paaru......  Xavier, yeah, that's one way i shld have got the IDs....Anyway....i got 'em now...  Had my first fall session yesterday.....know what....there are two other Indian ladies, with me in my Java class.....but they are all "Good looking middle aged women" & so i'm the only "Beautiful young gal"( in Rajesh's words).....  Vijay, i don't think i'll able to give any sugeestions to our juniors....i can just advise them,  not to marry an NRI  immidaitely after graduation, that too if she's very particular abt her career in IT. U cannot become a programmer  here, unless u have experience or that country's education.    Maybe i can give some inputs to our HOD.....ways to improve the standard of education given....& more particularly, how to get the best out of the students.....from a student's point of view.....   I won't say our standard was bad.....it was actually very good....that too for our batch, with the best faculties & subjects.....but we could have done even more better...guess, u all will agree with me....  that's it vijay....nee varuva, aedhavadhu public news vaasipa, oodiduva.....tell us something abt ur work, interesting & crazy stuffs u've been doing lately....atleast how many times u played shuttle cock, yesterday...something like that........else, i wud have to rename ur nickname from Roja Babu to Bulletien Board Babu (BBB)...nalla irukku illa!!!.....  need to prepare some yummy dishes for our brothers....i may not  blog for one week from now......  bye.

      dear Vijay,  actually what you said would have happened to me last Monday when I was at the dept. Kannan wanted me to give a speech to the juniors (current first years). But due to Chitra mam's intervention, I was unable to do so. I'll tell what I wanted to say to them tomorrow as I'm going home now.  Bye,

      hi,  hope everyone in our blogger family is doing well.  sorry for didnt post msg for long time. i dont want to tell any reason for that. because,  entrepreneurs dont find reasons for not doing things.                                        - Jayaraman (i dont know the actual person who said it. i only know the person who told this one to us)                                                                                i hav an interesting topic to discuss. we completed our course almost 1.5yrs ago. now everyone is having industrial experience(few has higher studies experience). assume that one fine day our HOD invite us to give a speech on career guidance to our juniors. what ll u say? what could be the core of ur speech?  while preparing for it, u hav to keep one thing in mind, ie., the dilemma we had till the last day of our couse. whether to select IT or mgmt?  people who forgot those days, pls go through the following incident. one year before, while everyone begin to search for their first job, one guy from IT profession asked one of our classmate that what is his/her specialization? for that our classmate responded as still I havnt decided between IT and Management. that guy now asked tell atleast in which area u did ur projects, because of our unique features, our classmate told that i did projects both in IT and Management. now that guy got angry(because he is a poor IT guy, he dont know anything more than that) and told, hey I am not at all asking abt Management, hav u did any IT projects or not, if so then in which platform u did it, what technology u interested? Microsoft or Java? Likewise he is going on adding questions related to S/W field, that we hardly knew. now this is the situation, we passed through those hard times and learned a lot in this 1.5 yrs of time. what ll u say now?   i expect everyone to participate and post their speech.   feelings:- ---------- class munnadi vanthu ninnu pesi yevvalavu nazh achchu. neenga pesinathu yellam innum kan(eye) munnadi nikkuthu. innoru santharpam kidaikkiradhu romba kastam, so atleast bloglaiyavathu post pannunga, atha en karpanaila neenga classla pesura mathiri ninaichchukkuven. (hmmmm sentiment work out ahhu thannu paarpom)  expecting everyone's participation, vijay

      Dear bloggers and Valli,  Everyone faces some problem with the net. regarding your suggestion of including the mail ids of all the blogers was implemented but only for a few minutes, I took it off again. That can be done when I find a way to put the bios of the bloggers. I have got a great idea now. But as it uses advanced  CSS  techniques, which  IE  does not support. If you use either  urlLink Mozilla  or  urlLink Firebird ,  then the bios would be visible. Do not try it today, try tomorrow or the day after.  Kicha, the use of   marquee   tag causes problems in the blog layout as expressed by Ranjini and Rajesh. So it would be nice if you could avoid using tags not supported by  XHTML .  This  urlLink site  would give you some idea of what I mean.  BTW: If you are viewing this site in  urlLink Firebird , you would notice a lot of nice things and also you would not have any layout problems.  Valli, you can get the mail ids from  urlLink Yahoo! Groups . Ranjini has put in her work in creating a database of our classmates. You can refer it anytime online.   Hey, did I tell you, my application for  MCJ  has been accepted. I have also paid the fees. I'll be receiving my study materials soon. So you can expect a lot of jounalistic entries in the blog from me soon. Did I mention that Firebird and Mozilla allow tabbed browsing? A wonderful feature that you all must try out.  urlLink Here  are more reasons for trying out Firebird.   Bye for now,

      Rajesh, It was really an interesting puzzle. But as Ganesh had noted, in real life the driver would have been punished.  I'm waiting to see the photos of Valli, Sindhu and Ranjini. Where are they?  BTW, where is Vijay? Never heard from him for a long time.

      Machan , i thought that the driver must be punished & why the hell the conductor must be punished must be the answer. But it turned out to be the other reason. Well u see . hehehehehe (Arasiyala Ethellam Sagajamappa)  bye

      Once there was a conductor, of a bus, who was very rude to his  passengers. One day a beautiful young girl, of around 18 years,  tried to board the bus, but the conductor didn't stop the  bus.Unfortunately the beautiful young girl came under the bus and  died on the spot. Angry passengers took the conductor to the  police station, who in turn took him to the court.The judge was  not at all impressed with the conductor and gave him capital  punishment, i.e. to be electrocuted. He was taken to the  electrocution chamber. There was a single chair in the center of  the room and a single banana peel at one corner of the room. The  conductor was strapped to the chair and high current was given to  him. But to everyone's amazement, he survived. The judge decided  to set him free, and he returned to his profession.  After a few months, this time, a good looking middle aged woman  tried to board the bus but the conductor didn't stop the bus.  Unfortunately, this time also, the good looking middle aged woman  came under the bus and died on the spot. Again angry passengers  took the conductor to the police station, who in turn took him to  the court. The judge took a look at the conductor and gave him  capital punishment. The conductor was taken to the same  electrocution chamber where there was a single chair in the center  of the room and a single banana peel at one corner of the room. He  was strapped to the chair and high current was given to him. This  time also to everyone's amazement, he survived. The judge decided  to set him free, and he returned to his profession.  A couple of months later, an elderly gentleman tried to board the  bus. This time the conductor, remembering his earlier experiences,  stopped the bus.Unfortunately the elderly gentleman slipped and  came under the bus. He also died on the spot. The conductor was  taken to the police station and then to the court, to the same  judge. Though he hadn't done anything wrong, but considering his  past record the judge decided to set an example and gave him  capital punishment. The conductor was again taken to the same  electrocution chamber where there was a single chair in the center  of the room and a single banana peel at one corner of the room. He  was strapped to the chair and high current was given to him. This  time he died instantly. The question is why didn't he die the  first two time but died instantly the third time ???  The answer is given below .... but try to solve the mystery  yourself. This is pretty interesting and the answer is perfectly  logical. If necessary read the puzzle twice.

      During the first two times, the conductor was a Bad  Conductor, therefore electricity didn't pass through him. But  during the third time, he was a Good Conductor, electricity passed  through him freely and he died !!!!!!!!

      Dear Ranjini,  I am definitely not fidling with the layout as I don't have the time to do it today. I think it must be a problem at your end. If it exists on the morrow, blog it, I'll try to find a solution.  Bye.

He gifted me a cool pair of diamond ear rings.....For my part, i threw out a grand dinner for him on the eve of our anniversery.....with all of his favourite dishes......here cakes are very cheezy & creamy. So i baked a pine apple cake myself with a whipped cream topping.....we called our parents, later that day & went to temple (nearby city)....when we came back, we had a surprise.......our friends, were waiting for us at our door step.....they had also bought a cake...made us cut it......it was, "my" dining room & "my" kitchen....& "they" were moving in & out busy arranging the snacks & stuffs....i was just watching them...I had the least idea of what was happening for quiet some time....      Saturday morning, as planned, we started out to a natural resort......It's called the red river gorge & the danial Boone forest.....we spent two wonderful days there, doing hiking & other stuffs.....we came back on sunday evening.....it's a deep forest....& we've to hike there....to see a natural bridge.....it's called so because, there's a bridge formed out of rocks connecting two mountains, naturally......we hiked for 1hr to reach that place....wow!! it was so wonderful....just a natural rock connecting two mountains.....no extra safety....we fall from there, we're gone!!!it was like walking on a wide board in the air......melae aagasam, Kelae Boomi, naduvulae naan......i had a real tuff time, controlling Ganesh, not to go to the ends.....     will upload a few photos in my album today....& u can see them 'morrow.....Rini, indha photos aavadhu paaka try pannu di.......      My excitement is still not over...This thursday, my anna & my bro-in-law are coming here...... waiting for their arrival......they wanted to have good home food .....they had a given me a list to be prepared...& guess what's the first item in the list...."Idly & sambaar"!!!!

      Congrats Rajesh! good and All the best!  Oh kootam seekureengala kovaila? Serunga, serunga. Enjoy guys!  What? A day without blog? Actually my senior had returned from Training today and so we had to finish off the work on friday and so couldnt blog any.   btw, this weekend bought a brand new Whirlpool fridge, 220litre, grey(almost looks like white) color, double door refrigerator. Need to learn to do ice creams. So bloggers, send me recipe of icecreams asap. And ya Ram had called me up, but couldnt even invite him to my place for my policy of planning to invite only when learnt cooking properly. So i am still under learning phase and dont want to trouble u guys with all those mishap cooks.  Hei guys @ TN, throw some light on Rain water harvesting. I heard that our CM has put a strict order in all corporation bound areas to have RWH setup. Is it so? I really am feeling happy. good that atleast now she has taken steps before it becomes too late. I like this. Remember few blogs away we were talking about environmental protection and we wanted people to encourage rainwater harvesting and now its becoming real is something good!  Ok then got some work and will get back to u all later

      Hi,  Ranjini....the marriage album is just 'tooo goood'. Both of you are looking charming and elegant.  Jax, though its a closed chapter Iam suggesting it cos i typed this blog long back but didnt manage to publish it.....the layout looks alright. But I feel the fluroscent green is too bright. How about a lighter shade of green instead?   Mahendra...ensoy panra pola??? anupavi rasa anupavi!  Two weeks back we went to Warwick castle. The castle was built in 1900 and ranked number 2 in UK. There is so much hype abt this castle. The castle was beautiful. Since this was my first visit to a castle, I liked it. But Boomi didnt as he had been to many. The heat was so much getting into our system that we had to literally run for shadows. There were so many living rooms, dining rooms and bedrooms, each with lavishing decorations and expensive furnitures. The one thing that caught my interest was ' The Dungeon and Torture chamber '- I was really shocked by the cruelity with which the English had treated the slaves and the soldiers captured during the war.  Later came to know that there is one museum in London exclusively meant for Torture. In India there are so many temples and buildings around which are dating back to some hundreds or thousands of years but very poorly marketed. Here they blow the trumphets in such a way that we run packing our bags to find the same thing that we have round the corner in most of the villages and towns in India.  As you all must be aware this year Uk has topped all the records this summer. The temp reached a record high of 38.1 degrees. Now the weather is slowly getting better. Ironically, France declared that the country is facing a crisis due to heat wave on the day the temp. started dropping down.... Coming weekend is long one for us. guess where we are going.......Scotland.....just desperately looking forward to this trip. It is believed to be one of the most beautiful places in the world. Most Hollywood films are shooted here. Let me see if Scotland meets my expectations.  Will upload the snaps shortly. Take care Valli.  Happy Weekend. Bye.

      Answer to Jax question...  "Uncopyrightable" and  "Dermatoglyphics" are the longest isograms in English-language. Isograms are words with no repeated letters.

      Hmmmm jax, i exactly couldnt figure out the uniqueness of both the words. But then i could see that "Uncopyrightable" has got all the vowels in it and dermatoglyphics, sorry i couldnt guess any thing about it. do give us the answers as i am eager to know about it.  and Ganesh thanx for the recipe greeting. It was good to look, but wonder how would it be to cook. Yes friends, Ganesh had sent us all the married women an amul greeting having recipe for "Chilled Salad soup" a novel way of wishing! I liked it!  and my parents are here and i am learning cooking now from my mom. With in 10 days i need to learn maximum no. of items, let me see how good i can. Ok then will blog u all later till then cares and shares Ranjini

      Hi all,  we have over ten members and I find that a few of them have not even blogged once even though they have accepted the invitation to join us. This might be due several reasons, but atleast they could send us a 'hi' post. So if anyone is in touch with them, kindly ask them to post to the blog asap.  Bye,  P.S.

      Ok, here it begin, my one day visit to Madurai.   Morning : As usual, I caught an auto to the dept. Enroute, I saw Vinodh Kumar. He was coming down from Sangeeth Lodge for tea. Thought about seeing him later, but couldn't. Came to know that I was the first person in our batch to be applying for a provisional certificate. Most of our batchmates had got thier degree certificates, so they don't require a provisional certificate. Our certificates have not been recieved by the dept. So I was asked to go to the univ. to apply and collect it.   Met Omprakash - yesterday was his last day at the dept. He's off to Mumbai in search of a job. Rajadurai was on leave yesterday. Met Kannan and Chitra Ma'm. Kannan is taking almost all the classes at the dept.   We were the last batch to have a lot of external faculties. After us, the external faculties have stopped coming at all except one or two. The trimester system has been scrapped in favour of a semester system. It seems that quality of education has dropped considerably.  I spoke to Chitra ma'm. Rini, she said she did not get the invi to your marrriage. She had marked it in her diary, but as she didn't get an invi she forgot about it. Valli and Sindu, Ma'm asked if there was any good news from both of you.    Afternoon : Made my way to the univ. went around the univ with my aunt to get things on track. I was told that I would be receiving my PC only on Wed, as Tues. is a holiday for Krishna Jayanthi. Skipped lunch. It was 4 pm when everything got over. My aunt said she'll look after things.   Evening : Had a late lunch, watched TV and got ready to leave for Coimbatore. Left home around 7:00 pm to catch the bus. Coming to the bus stand, I thought of paying Shana and Philo a visit as they were staying nearby only. Went to their apartment around 7:30. Only Philo and her younger sis were at home. Spoke about things for some time.   I came to know that Shana was working in ICICI bank nearby only. Waited till 8:30 to meet her. It seems she got her first salary yesterday only. Exchanged notes about our classmates and life in general for a long time. On their insistence, I had a couple of chappathis for dinner there. Left around 9:45 and caught a bus to Coimbatore at 10 pm.   Reached Coimbatore around 3 am today.  Valli, Philo wanted to know why you are continuing your studies and Sindu, everyone are suprised to know that you were in a marketing job. I heard that Bulb is working as a lecturer in Mother Teresa Univ. @ Kodaikanal.

      Hi,      I was not feeling well last week......fever & head ache......the usual head ache, but it was more severe this time......My doctor said i was anaemic, & has prescribed iron tablets........Ganesh worries too much abt this, & stuffs me with fruits, veggie salads & lot more....he wants my haemoglobin to increase in a single day......he refuses to understand that it's a periodic process.....now i'm ok, other than the anaemic part......     So actually we missed the I-day celebs.......it was scheduled on saturday & hosted by the Indian students association of UK......we just called our friends here & wished them.....On friday, i watched & recorded the pattimandram alone, so that Ganesh can see it later.........      I have got an "A" grade in my exams.....       Yeah Mahen, i know you are very much interested in networking...but i did'nt know that you are preparing for the CCNA exam.....great!!! All the best...i'll surely help you with the best of my knowledge.....But i doubt my future interests in networking.....Networking is a great field.....But i won't be suitable for the field, i guess....i cannot  crawl under the office floors to look out for outlet boxes & cables, nor can i climb up a ladder rack to reach out to the top most switch or hub for connections......I'm not that confident about my physique.....But i'm sure CCNA ceritified network engineers have great value......They can march amidst the entire lot with heads high!!! CCNA pannavae naan indha paadu paduraen......idhula, Ganesh wants me to complete CCNP & CCIE also in the future......        Rini, looking ahead for ur mom's arrival???.....kuduthu vaechava di!!!!

       Research paper rubbishes astrology    Extensive scientific research over more than 40 years has finally confirmed what many always believed: that astrology is rubbish, and that it is based on the principle of deception. The research began in London 1958, and has just been published in the current edition of the respected Journal of Consciousness Studies. It is hailed as the most thorough scientific study ever made into the subject.   Read  urlLink full-story

I enjoyed the three days like anything. Superb it was to be with his friends. Not even one minute did i spend my time idle. Ore aattam paattam kondattam thaan. We played pattukku paatu, Dumb charades,  etc. All the films which srini enacted, i was the one to find out first.   We went to Ranganthittu bird sanctuary, but no birds to see except crows caw caw..... but the place was good with bamboo trees & rattt tatttt sound. Have u heard those sounds of bamboo ya? Then in the evening we went to Balamuri falls. we went in parisal u know. first time in that. Supera irundhathu. Naan pant shirt potta naala i could not bath in falls, else ore ragalai panni iruppen. then we went straight to Madikeri.   Next day our adventure started with a trip to Iruppu falls. Wow the way was so slippery and watery. Should keep ur foot firm, illai keela vilunthu mandai odachikka vendiyathu thaan. The falls was so remote and beautiful. Only few were taking bath and i was the only female to take bath there. Ha evvalavu periya veeranganai. Infact srini never let his hands holding mine. illa thanni adikira adikku, avvalavuthaan, naan nera andha thanniyilaye bangalore poi iruppen. Poor srini! i never let him be with his friends, but then because of all the settais i was doing, he ought to be with me, coz i was climbing on slippery rocks, trodding on wet logs, moving towards force waters and what not.......  Finally he managed to throw me out of water as it was becoming cold and i started shivering. Then we went to Nagerhole - Rajiv Gandhi national park. They said, Elephant ride and all is there, but nay coz of dusshera, all elephants had gone to Mysore itseems. Enna panna  :-   The next day we went to Abbi falls where also i had a nice kuliyal at one of the dangerous places. There also i was the only girl among four of us who had been there taking bath. Not even some of his guys were ready to take bath and i was shivering like anything as it was very cold and early in the morning 7 o clock. Good that srini always comes with me, though he wasnt interested. Really before going only he was telling, i m not interested in taking bath, but then coz of me he had to and we enjoyed like anything. Then we went to a place called Raja's seat where from we had a majestic valley view. So beautiful, with lush green fields, some in parrot green, some leaf green, some in brown color as the field was ready to get planted, some in golden yellow with water stagnant on it and mist then and there, wow superb it was u know.  We then went to a place called nisargadhama where in we played shuttle cork and all his friends played volley ball till the last moment of sweat. On our way back from Nisarga we had ice creams drenching ourselves in rain. It was a beautiful place full of Bamboo trees and very cool on all sides surrounded by cauvery water, just like an island. So nice it was. Then we also went to a near by Tibetian monastery where in we saw some exotic and most beautiful sculpture and architectural work of Tibetian culture. Then we returned home merrily and totally exhaust! Photos eduthirukken, u all can have a look when scanned.   Tomorrow my parents are coming and i am waiting for them to turn up. From tomorrow onwards i will get proper breakfast. Enga amma panni kuduppaangale.  Ok then will blog later

      Google now has got a calculator feature. I wanted to blog it on Friday itself but forgot. Anyway you can try it out. Take a  urlLink look  at the features it has got.  I'm leaving for Madurai tomorrow afternoon. So I won't be blogging for the next two days.  BTW, someone try to figure out the uniqueness of these two words,   uncopyrightable   and    dermatoglyphics   . Answers on Tuesday, when I get back to work.  See you all on Tuesday.

      Hi Manny,  Good to hear that you are now  a  an SME . Now I can ask you any questions related to networking. BTW are you working on Solaris platform, heard it was a wonderful piece of OS.   Good to hear that you are also working on Windows installations. As a SME in that area, I can help you in any doubts in that arena. Feel free to ask.  reg. the layout, consider the issue closed for now. I will rake up the matter when I make any changes to the layout. (which will be sometime around two weeks from now)  I am hoping to hear from our NRI's about I-Day in their localities.

      Hi all, Back again… Happy Independence Day buddies…  But this is the first Independence Day wherein my independence was lost… Yes…My job sucks my time… I have to work even tomorrow. That’s the sad news…  And This is for Ranjini, Rini, Believe it or not (But u have to…ha ha)…I am now working as an SME (Subject matter Expert for all networking related projects) and am now working in preparing an e-book on Network File System Implementation In Solaris 9 OE.  Also in another project in which I am preparing a course material for troubleshooting Dual Boot Installation For All the Windows Family of Operating Systems.  Said enough abt my role, I hope.  But I am not that much excited with this kind of theoretical work yaar…I am looking for some concrete hard core networking job and may be I will get one soon.  Valli, BTW I am also preparing (of course I am preparing for the past 1 year or so) and still preparing for taking up the CCNA yaar. Let me see when I will be able to take up the exam…but for sure, I will get it soon. Glad to know that u also belong to my category, I mean the networking part of computers… Will get back to you once I get certified for knowing more abt the networking Industry in US. Hope I can expect ur inputs later…can I???!!!  And nothing more yaar.   And one final question… When will this layout issue be settled? I suspect jax, that he wants this issue to be unsolved just like the Ayodhya issue, to increase the interactions of the group…ha ha.  Bye bye Mahen.

      The layout is now looking refined as u have polished those thick lines into fine thin lines. good ya  Ok can do it later too and it looks ok now with the Archives link format and still the problem persists with the recent posts i believe. Check it out.   Hei guys, yesterday i was in full shopping spree. Actually it was unplanned and all of a sudden, we decided to go for shopping to one of the malls where they had put curtains for sale. I bought some 4 curtains for two windows and on our way back, we crossed allen solly womens wear showroom. I was in pant-shirt formals. So when srini just asked, hei u had been planning to buy some pants for the past few days, how about trying now?, i said "yes".  All these days i had been saying no, since i cant give a try when i am in other outfits, but then yesterday i thought let me. So went in and started selecting. Meanwhile, the lady there, said, there is an offer like, one garment free with every two we buy. So srini decided to get me two. Great! I took sky blue jean color, a bit elephant grey and dark blue mix color, a bit dark sandal color. Threee pants! I have given it for alteration and will be getting them back today evening. And ya tomorrow morning we and his friends will be going to a near by Hill station in coorg (in tamil its kudagu malai) called  urlLink    Madikeri    and i am going to try all my new dresses on this trip.  Oh yesterday i had a nice time removing hefty load from srini's pockets! Then we had dinner @ Shiv sagar. One tasty tasty vegetable dosa and a Gudbud ice cream. Bangaloreans, those who visit the Shiv sagar hotel in commercial can give a try at Vegetable dosa. It was very tasty and costed only 20Rs. ICe cream was ok, when compared to the all time tasty fig&Honey ice creamw hich srini had. Then came home merrily and so does my shopping story ends for the day!  Ok then see u all later Ranjini

      I have made a change in the display, but what you want requires a little bit of  JavaScript . I didn't want the blog to load slow due to usage of Javascript. I'll out something when I have some free time to jump into the depths of scripting.   I'll be going to Madurai on Sunday afternoon and be back at Coimbatore by Monday night. My visit is related to my  MCJ  course. I can't make head or tail about our university's prospectus. On one page they say I need not send the tution fees, but on the form, they want me to send the tution fees with the application form.  Got to straighten out things in person there.

      Jax, i think the month in the Archive section contains the entire name, but i would suggest it to be in first three character format so that when its listed in Archive section it would look good and uniform unlike now. and i think let the year be 2003 instead of '03. Coz there can be some problem in that single quote. If it doesnt occur, then no probs, just '03 is enough. For eg. 10 Aug '03 will do. What do u say?  and now after few days the blog is looking good once we start aclimatising it.  and that Bach CD is a collection titled Unforgetteble Classics. So there is any particular thing mentioned on CD cover regarding compilation.   Two weeks holidays for u valli? Enjoy well.  will catch u all later Ranjini

      Ram, it was a very long post indeed. but please don't post the entire html code into the blog. If you notice, I had removed all the formatting that you had specified. Sorry to do it. I had to do it because the blog started to display junk. Hope you don't mind me editing your post before someone starts complaining.  It would be better if you could post using valid  XHTML . Any queries regarding this can be directed to me.

      Thank You Valli.. Will get one gift for u... when v meet next... Already have purchased a gift for my sister so that I can handover during my native visit (Aug 15 - 17)...   Numerous ideas to discuss, from the excerpts of the day 2 day news in 2day's world scenario....  torcher ur brain.................   Dear All,  Mail might be lengthy but worthy I believe.   Don't circulate beyond the limit since it contains sensitive issues.    Where, the world leads you ??   ONGC Mumbai - copter crash - Employees demanded the &quot;step down&quot; of it's CEO. Cause of accident, safety negligence or technical snag, enquiry on it's own way.  India MPs ( including Laloo, has to surrender his passport on Aug 18 in Patna court after his return) visited Pakistan. Indian Govt not in a position to believe the Musaraff words due to previous experience. Confident level where are we.  Balbir Singh looks like one MP whisked the security of Parliament and roamed inside like Hero. Security system under lapse.  Pepsi &amp; Coke - May close to BAN due to over level of Pesticides. Will it be a election stunt like Bisleri water. Are you soft to these drinks.   Frequent MiG 27 crash. Disheartened family members of expired Pilot given request to our first citizen, who is always down to earth, to take care of the AIR safety level. Hope you all guess. Yes it is Kalam. You know the statement released by them over a Press meet. &quot;We should avoid our people killed by our own machines than the enemies&quot;.  81 people hurt in pile up, series vehicle crash at Bangalore Hosur road. Incident occur after the two wheeler rider lost his control and hit a road divider. Foreign delegates felt comparatively, Bangalore is better than Delhi. Road safety is big task.  British troops under threat in Basra, IRAQ.  Supersonic Flight service dropped.  A boy around 15 years old intruded into India border from Pakistan twice.  Ofcourse he has sent back to his country by Delhi -Lahore&nbsp; &quot;Dosti&quot; bus service because of the peace initiative started by PM.  Man from Kerala struggled for living with his family due to Pakistan citizenship which he got many years back under the wrong assumption that, with this he can enter India easily.  Reinstating Govt employee in TN. Still some people future is under dark.  Multimode train (MMTS) derailed at AndraPradesh after a day it was inaugurated.    A baby (Noor) from Pakistan got operated at Bangalore hospital. Beyond border issue.  David Kelly- weapons expert to Iraq suicide. Tony Blair - UK is cornered. Bush is out of focus.  Liberian President steps down.  Isrel denied to release the Palestinian militants after the recent suicide attack.  E- tickets (for Air Travel) introduced in India too. First ticket issued to Mr. Ramadorai CEO of TCS. Can we &quot;check in&quot; without any hassle? Let him talk after his first experience.  If I'll elect for next term, I will make AP like Singapore. AP-CM Naidu   Where as Mayawathi - MP-CM , I'll construct RAM Temple. Feel the vision focus.  Arnold nominated for California Mayor election.

      ya i do remember now, But tell us what we should do to rectify the error now? And still i dont find the recent posts links working. y?

      Rini, the reason why  IE  throws up an error is: The "Recent Posts" index uses  JavaScript  to get the titles of the posts. if you can recall our JavaScript classes (which I don't), the single quote mark is a delimiter character. When a single quote is being used in a post like "Rini's blog", the script generates an error, which is what you can see in your browser.  Moral of the Story:   Never, ever use a single quote in the title of your post.    As for Johann Sebastian Bach (1685-1750), I like his  motets  very much. Bach also wrote some of most beautiful pieces of music for a wide range of instruments. Most of his work were religious in nature, but his compositions were all easy to learn. Bach came from a musical family.  Rini, what compositions of Bach have you bought?

      No jax its not working. Check out once again. Mahen, nowadays, i am focussed very much on Classical music, so i do find time listen to light music or indi pop only when i keep fm. Preference towards music differs based on the individual. Ya will surely give a try to listen to it too when time permits!  Which project r u now into mahendran?  Ya talking about the music, i want to come out with a small question which i read in a book yesterday!  What is the difference between Indian Music and Western music? What is the cause of the difference whether its origin or expression? All can come out with your differences on it!

      Friends,  We bought some more casettes and CDs as we have music system now. A brand new Sony music system. I got MS Subbu lakshmi Annamacharya Kirtans. Kshetra Tirupathi by TM krishna, and srini got Scorpions, one of his favourite band in those days, then one western classical CD by Bach. Its a thing u know. Excellent its to listen. I listened to it for the first time and it gives u the feeling of ascending a beautiful hill as the volume and intensity of music surges and it leaves u atop. Bach is a German musician and he is one of the Maestros like Beethoven in music. U all should listen to it ya. Just beautiful. I dont know much about this musician, may be jax might help us to drill about him a bit and throw light on it.   As usual annamachrya kirtans are too irresistible , that too in MS voice it is damn good. Especially Sriman Narayana song. So calm really making u have a feel of total surrender at god's foot u know when she spells, "Sri paadame saranam". The flop of that day's pick was TM krishna's Kshetra Tirupathi. Actually there is a series of casettes released by CDW casettes. Its like compilation of songs on one particular sacred place or Kshetram. Till now five have come out, which include our Madurai(Singer-Nithyasree Mahadevan), Chidambaram(Sanjay Subramaniyan), Srirangam (Aruna Sairam), Tirupathi (T.M.Krishna), Kancheepuram(dont know).   The best of it was Kshetra Srirangam by Aruna Sairam. Naan nenaikiran, she is a vaishnavite or one who worships perumal. ya she could pronounce the devotion towards the lord so profoundly in music that u simply cant remain in ur existing state. I havent heard to any of her other songs, but this. They say, only selective listening is recommended incase of Aruna, and this happens to be one of the best pick.   We got almost all the Kshetra series except Kancheepuram. Ya Kshetra Tirupathi is by TM krishna, not the CM of Karnataka, but an upcomining vocalist. But we were impressed neither by songs, nor by his voice. May be since we dint listen to it many times, we arent much into it. Need to listen it few more times, to acquaint ourselves with it.   Mahen&Valli thanx for ur comments on our album. Expecting feedback from other dormant bloggers too! What kavi, no goodmornings also nowadays. Where is vijay babu who said who will post atleast Good morning or good evening?   Mahen whats that technologgix in ur co. name? is it misspelt in our database or its so with some significance? And y do u work late night and whats it that u are working on like this?   Jax thanx for u correction on word Procs! I just messed it up. sorry....... Bye for now

      Rini, I'm never far away from the blog. I make it a point to check it every hour.   Regarding my postings, I was trying to see how this interactions could be improved. Still no posts from many of us, but can't expect them to post as often as a few of us do. I was also try to get some of my work completed by this weekend. Clearing backlogs, you can say.  BTW, the name is made much bigger, as for the line, it is not a dashed line, but a dotted line. If you are using IE, you'll see only a dashed line, not a dotted line. Blame Microsoft for it. Get a Gecko based browser like  urlLink Firebird , it's quick and has a lot of additional features.  As your boss is not in town, can we see a lot of interesting posts from you?  Bye.

How come. btw guys, y dont u put ur current address which might be ur office address or current residential address updates on to our database. I could see some empty columns. I am planning to add one more column to the existing database with the column name, Office address. so do update that also to make the database look complete.   Hei guys, one good news, my immediate boss is out of town, for two weeks and i will be free till Aug 22. Not exactly free, but wont have much pressure though he has given me my schedule. You know guys, i am supposed to be in Hyderabad for a training in my working domain - Railway signal Engineering @ IRSET. But then since i had to go for a trip with Srini and his friends on 15,16,17, i have decided to forego. Even my division head is not ready to send me as i am the only female candidate. So he has promised to send me next year when i would have got more acquaintances and knowledge update too.  And jax, y no blogs from u for the past two days? What happened? Layout pottu pottu onju poittiya, illa color combination paathu paathu theynju poitiya?

      Hei ram, after wedding snaps ellam set panni eduthathu thaan. Those taken during our wedding are only taken by his friend. He can take wedding snaps, but cant be after us once the wedding is over na. Those which u feel like we have given pose are taken specially by a still photographer and we got it printed soon and brought it with us to Bangalore for our friends to have a look. but big album in which the entire event is covered is still @ Madurai.   Valli........ Madisar illa, just NorthIndian style. I like to drape my favourite outfit in this style. Coz it gives a rich look to the Silk sarees. Very often i tie sarees like this and it would make u look good, infact grand with very few jewels on you. So its a secret to reduce the weight of all those jewels but still look trendy and grand. U too can give a try. Its just the same as tieing ordinary saree but for paloo in the front.  Mahen did u see the snaps now? Ranjini

      Hi all,                   Xavier, layout seems good now.......Is this orange ur favourite color?....adha mattum maathavae maataengura??.......If possible try some other shades of orange.....Green is good now.......Do we need the dotted horizontal line after every title?......As Rini, said, it would be nice, if the font size is increased......Other than these minor differences, i find the layout appealing.......good job done man!!!!           Good job done by Mahen also.......such a big post from him, for the first time, with only one "Ha ha"......his trademark sirippu......Nice to hear a plastic bag free beach......          Hey Rini, Great photos di........Especially, the couples photo after the marriage looks elegant.....Are u wearing a Madisaar style saree or the ordinary one?.........awaiting to see more of yours........Pallavarukku nalladhoru uvamai koduthu puriya vaithu vittai......sabaash Thozhi.......(just kidding  Mahendran!!)           About the case study, trying to put myself in the autorickshaw man's shoes, it's quiet nominal to charge Rs.300 or Rs.400, 'coz of the constraints, lesser accomadation, petrol fuel etc......now, getting into the parents shoes, i'll surely try to go in for the cheaper commutation......The part where the autorickshaw association goes wrong, from my view, is "They have no rights to demand.....not the least one to order or force the parents to use autos".......so according to my observation, the change has to take place from the autoriskshaw man's side.......Their association, instead of demanding, has to do some attractive changes, that'll pull back the customers. Or if they try to do this, The customers will have no other way, rather than to get the corps. So my solution is (provided this same situation exists),  to go for the SECOND CHOICE.....           Saturday, we were invited by an aunty for Varalakshmi pooja.....happened to meet a lot of tamil families....got new contacts......  poittu vaaaraen...... valli.

      Sari sari oor suthinathu podhum. And thanx for ur words of appreciation too.....  and jax regarding this layout, please increase the font size of the writer and also let it be a bit below the line without dashing the line.  And kadaisila keela irukara that notice kooda romba brighta irukku. Can dim a bit.  I have uploaded my wedding album in files section in the form of PPS, prepared by srini.  FYI all the snaps in the presentation have been taken by one of srini's close friend who is learning photography and its been taken without our knowledge. So u can expect some surprising expressions on our album! As the official photographs are @ madurai, we have prepared this album, using only those snaps taken by his friend. So only his friends and not our friends are there in the album! Dont get disappointed. Will turn out with some more snaps with our friends on it soon. So wait for the next release.....  Ok then will mail u all later Bye for now Ranjini

      Hi all…  Hope everybody had a nice weekend.   And for us, it was really one of the most exciting fun packed Sundays in the past few months. Yesterday we (Myself, bala, ajayan and one more friend by name senthil who is vijay’s friend) went to Mahabalipuram. It was a nice trip where we enjoyed each and every mile of our travel.  Unfortunately ganesh was not able to join us as he had some work related to his departure to madurai for his training.  We started at 8 in the morning from T nagar in two bikes. We filled the fuel for our travel…and then we went to ganesh’s house to get his camera from him. We continued our travel in East Coast Road from ganesh’ s house at 9. The ECR is one of the best roads to have a smooth ride enjoying the pleasant sceneries of the seashore and the backwaters…this trip reminded me of the tour we went to kodai in bikes during our MS…  And on the way we finished our breakfast in a motel… We reached mahabs at 10.30 I suppose…  We went to Mahishasuramardhini temple there…we visited the light house and we saw the five rathas of the pancha pandavas…it was my first trip to mahabs and I really enjoyed seeing those sculptures there…  Then we planned to go to the Kovalam Beach. But on the way we entered a forest like area, where we found nobody was there…so, we drove our bikes towards the beach …it was a nice ride on the sands of the beach which we enjoyed a lot…we reached the shore of the sea…and it was a virgin shore…(!!!) I mean nobody was there and you cannot find even a footprint of men in the seashore…it was so beautiful to see such a shore…may be this was the first time we are visiting such a place…  And here comes the main part of the trip…ha ha…  Yes we had our drinks party in the sands of beach under the sun…It was our first experience to have such a drinks party in a totally litter free, pollution less, open space seashore, filled with the pleasant sounds made by the waves of the sea...  We had a bath in the beach with our drinks in one hand and a cigarette on the other… We were lying on the beach sand for more than 2 hours or so…after enjoying the drink and the sea breeze we started back to our destination having some tea and snacks on the way…  During our return, bala terrified me a lot with his terrific speed…in fact, I got his helmet from him and wore it on my head…I was really frightened by his way of driving because his driving reminded me of the accident we met when we went to kodai tour in bikes… Ajayan too adding to his enthusiasm was driving at a good speed…but his vehicle was not able to pick up to meet his speed so he slowed down a bit, but bala doesn’t seem to slow down anyway…once he sees a pair of couple going at a far distance he starts chasing them…ha ha…aana pakkathula pona than therinjuthu ellam dubukku couples…ha ha…  Thus we reached ganesh’s house at adyar to return back his camera by around 6 in the evening. Thanks to ganesh for loading his camera with a film roll for us…  And thus our trip went on this way and we were back to our room by 6.30. This is just a beginning and our plans are there to go to pondy and tirupathi in the near future after I also get a bike. Hope to see rajesh, ganesh and vijay to join our next trip. I will share the snaps we took during this trip soon so that you too can share our joyful moments. Of course this is just a small trip without any grand preparartion…but the fun we had was something which we had after a long time since we completed our degree…that’s it.   C u guys and gals.  Mahen.

      Layout looks good Jax, more about color combinations in later blogs. But first let me talk to Mahen. Enna settaiya? Rendu perukkum, (Ram&Mahen)appuram naan bisibelebhath senju courier panniruven jaakrathai. What u say is true about it, but the way u prepare varies and taste is also not exactly same ok. Word starum oru text editor, Ms wordum oru text editor, adhukkaga, MS wordum, Word starum onna? they differ in the features right, though they serve the same functionality. Adhe maathiri thaan iduvum. Sari onakku enga puriya poguthu? Idhellam kalyanam aana puriyum. Onakkum thaan, coz now a days guys are fast 2 learning cooking.   I could smell something smoking in Kicha's kitchen too. Now adays he sends me recipe's too. so guys be on his track and start learning. Naan vena some simple recipe's anuppi vakiren.  friends i will be uploading my wedding snaps and vinitha's reception snaps soon onto our groups section by this evening. so watch out for that!  Ok then, on to Rajesh case discussion.... Problem: Rajesh, U know in the world of FMCGs Customer is the king, similarly, here User is the king. He has the right to decide his own way of transport. Since the advent of share auto we could see that the same transport can be arranged at half the earlier price. There is no wonder if a person opts for cheap and best service. But its a subtle problem, coz, these autorickshawalas have to charge more as they can accomodate less people, where as share autos can charge less as they accomodate more people. So these auto walas will have to suffer, if they cut the cost to the extent of these share autos....  Solution: Need to think a bit, so will post it later Bye for now Ranjini

      dear friend   In Annanagar ,where i'm staying in chennai an interesting event took place.im putting it in the blog.you say your views about it.We have autorickshaws here to take school childrens to thier school.They were charging 400Rs per student till now to take them to a distance of 2 K.M nearly (to and fro).But after Share autos were introduced now a share auto person collects a minimum of 5 Rs for a person to cover that distance.So on calculating it takes 10 Rs per day for to and fro,which comes to 10 * 5 days/week = 50 Rs/week.so in total it becomes 200Rs/month which is almost 50%.On a concession he had agreed to get 150 Rs /month.But this auto persons who were on business till now are forming informal associations and threatening the share auto person not to do the job.They had also decreased the fare to 300 Rs which is still in expensive.due to the autocratic behaviour the school childrens are finding difficulties to go to school on time.   Now the matter is before our appartments association.Now we have to choose from the below decisions. 1.We have to go by the autoRickshaw persons statements and pay them 300Rs/month.  2.We have to give a criminal complaint against the auto rickshaw GANG in police ,where they will be arrested and remanded.here they will be treated as criminals.(the shareauto person is ready for service whenever we are ready to give him a legal protection)  so i want xavier,Mahendran,ramgopal.ranjini,kishore,valli,ganesh,sindu,vijaybabu to study the case and reply in this blog there opinion.  bye and take care raapi

      I guess you all must have got used to the white background for almost 4 months, so anything other than that would seem unsightly. Most of your suggestions has been to eliminate dark backgrounds.   I feel that a contrasting background would be wonderful. Right now, I have got a black background with a near-white grey text. It really looks good.   Valli, any help is welcome. That's what I've been telling all the time. The best way to check things out is to take a look at the page source. I have mentioned a lot of details to help you out. save the webpage to your computer. Play around with the styles. Any help in figuring things out, blog it.  As for the menus, Kicha, I think the menus are on the top, just below the Title. Or are you talking of the sidebar. Please clarify.  Rini, Tell me how to put the content in the center of a two column blog. I feel geometrically challenged. Can Ram help me out on this?  BTW, can someone suggest me a good birthday gift for a nineteen year old guy? His birthday falls day after tomorrow (Aug 9).  Got a busy few days ahead of me, can't say if I can blog or not? Luckily, I don't have a bang-bang project. I've got six like them. So it is bang-bang 6 .

      hi all,        I have my final exams for the summer semmester this week. I have the last one tommorrow. Had a very tuff time in my practicals, trying to terminate a twisted pair cable, with a connector & then setting up a LAN......somehow, finally i succeeded.....phoooo, stupid networking, takes so much of physical energy. Next semmester i'm going to just opt programming langs like JAVA, perl & SQL. Guess I would continue my Cisco certification, next year. My summer break starts from this weekend, & extends for the next  20days. Me & my friend, we are planning to do something in our hols......yet to decide....         Last saturday,  i recieved  greeting  cards, one from my brother & one from my parents, for our anniversery(they posted it far ahead, giving allowance for postal delays). The cards were really fantastic, with so much of touching touching words, that i started crying. Ganesh had a really tuff time convincing me that day & finally he took me out, to stop my tears. That day we ended up in getting a brand new big wooden dining table(for which i had been pestering Ganesh for the past 6 or 7 months. All these days we just had a very small one, made out of steel, which Ganesh had got before marraige). Poor Ganesh, he wanted me to smile. But that can be done, only when he cries!!!!         Xavier, that background color does'nt suit. Try avoiding dark colors for backgrounds. The green colored text seems to be even worse in this background. I understand that, basically,  u need four colors for the blog. Maybe i can come out with a few suggestions, if u want.          Rini, nice that you enjoy cooking. It takes time to pick up speed. i used to spend three hrs to prepare lunch, & three hrs to prepare dinner earlier. I purchased four books for cooking recipies on the day we boarded. Uma Devarajan, & Malliga Bhadrinath are the miracle angels who guided me throughout & ofcourse, my mom thru the weekend calls. I wud suggest u to get some good recipie books. It would help u a lot in the beginning.One more important tip i can give u is, record all ur recipies. Bisibelabath, u said u got it from ur friend....have u written it down?.....u might have to refer it atleast for the first four or five times, u prepare it. Only after that u get familiar. Have some burns oinment like burnol or silverex handy always. U might need them often in the beginning.   will blog once my exam is over,  bye.

      jax, When I said "most of ur post" I meant most of "that particular post" and not other posts... in fact, I don't even remember u mentioning about Patsy(mcox) earlier...   I too think the only drawback is the background... pretty dark...  and we seem to be more used to having the menus in the left rather than right... that might be one more option...   It was an awfully hectic day today. Some issues in my code made me bang my head against the table.... bang...bang... I went throughout the day... and it'll be more bang..bang... tomorrow. The better part in the day was, we moved to a new building. Actually not yet completely... I got mail asking to come immediately to my place (from my project place) and pack-up everything from our PMUs (Personal Mobile Unit  alias  drawers) into a big box that was given to everyone. Then they were taken by the facilities people and placed in the new building  (No.33). There, the entire ground floor will be occupied by our team..  Cubicles have been "allocated"... we were asked to search for the cubicle that had our name written on the white-board (usually every one has a white-board next to him). We have to occupy that place only. We got new terminals too. Black... Flat screen monitors..!!!! Thin ones... The terminals are not ready yet. They told it'll be ready by tomorrow and we have to transfer all our files very soon as the old ones will be formatted. Later tomorrow, I'll try to make some time from this bang..bang.. project, to transfer all files from old one to the new one...

      Hei jax,  Ennappa Background color idhu.... thoongi valiyudu.  Adhukku yellow color was far better.  Come one give a try with some other good combination.  If u ask me, Other than White i dont find any good background color, but then i wont stop u from experimenting with colors. Happy coloring! and put the blog content in the center instead in the left. Like the white and grey layout. That really eases our reading. I am not satisfied with displaying blog content in one side, be it right or left. Right or left Center is the best!  Others look ok to me. will get back to u later Ranjini

      Kicha, I guess this was my second or third post about her since this blog began. You call that  often. The reason I'm using names is that I am tired of saying 'my friend, who is ..." and "My friend said that...". I makes me feel like a hypocrite. No harm in using names though. Also the message is clear  when you use names.   Consider, "I am a member of a blog with several of my friends. We post what we can in the blog, one of the blogger got married recently. Yesterday that blogger friend of mine posted a very interesting post on her cooking experience. Another friend of mine recently posted her travels around the UK. Yet another friend of mine sadi how he had spent his weekend."   Easy to understand who did what. BTW, She isn't my cousin, otherwise I would've mentioned it. Coming to the next set of choices...  Anyway, I have a question regarding your question, ' Girl Friend/Friend who is a girl ', what's the difference between the above. Literally, they are the same. Emotionally they differ. Let us say she's both  two and three . Maybe she's  not  neither.   Rini, That was really a very interesting post about your cooking experiences.   Sindu, Continuing your tour of UK still... Yellorum Orua suthuvanga, nee nadu suthura. As Rini said, where are the photos? And Rini where are your wedding photos?  Tired to read a novel and watch a movie (League of the Extraordinary Gentleman) at tha same time yesterday. Completed half a novel and half the movie. Planning to complete the rest today.  more later,

      Hei friends Happy friendship day! u know what i did all these days, here it comes!  Friday I bunked my office to slide my hours from the monotonous work. In the afternoon I prepared Bisibelebhath. a new dish, which I listened from one of my colleague and tried out. It came out good only. Ellam naanthaan sollikiren, sollikka vendiyathu thaan. My cousin Suganya was my test subject and she gave pass mark...... I dint trouble srini this time. Next time, probably tomorrow, I will make him also to undergo the test.   Full day I thought I would take rest, but then cleaning the house and arranging things ate up my entire day and so did the week end too go with work and work. Especially washing clothes and dish washing is the biggest time eater. Its becoz srini often gives me leave in cooking, I do get a bit of time to relax. As I am new to cooking, I do cook slowly and need to pace up.  I would like to learn cooking North Indian Dishes as Srini loves it, (girls/ guys if u know any good north indian recipe kindly intimate to me especially paneer items, let me give a try) but then he insists on not spending much time in cooking. But cooking is my new venture, and as I see, that I am not such a worse cook, my interest in it doubles and I long to cook too. But srini toh, ties my hands, and I dont know, from whom to learn all those north Indian dishes. Anyway soon I will give a try at those too and surprise him.  We bought a new Sony Music system yesterday. Its in Grey&Silver color chasis. we actually ordered for grinder too, but its yet to be delivered. So as such we have now started furnishing our home. Hope by this weekend all the most necessary amenities would have been taken care.  Saturday srini invited his friends and i cooked tomato rice. It was also good and i am becoming an expert in preparing that u know.   Sunday i cooked rice, sambar, meal maker fry, cabbage and carrot poriyal. Everything tasted good u know, especially mealmaker fry, srini loved it. Arey i cook so many new items and i have to drill this fellow to eat. but he never repents and abides. But still to learn so many.  We dint go to any concert as planned before. I would have loved to go to Sanjay Subramanyan's concert on thursday, but as srini went to donate blood to one of his colleague's acquaintance, he couldnt take me and so i couldnt go. Yesterday evening we planned to go to Sudha Raghunathan's concert but then as it was raining so heavily, we couldnt. Anyway we had a nice time chatting with his friends, who are so humourous to the core. My god, what a bunch they are!!!  Yesterday evening i went home late waiting for srini. But as he was busy, he couldnt pick me up and so i had to go by myself. How boring its to be alone at home. Thanx for the music system which we bought! Then i started cooking for three of us(Srini, myself and his friend). As i started cooking, i started receiving calls after calls and so i couldnt cook properly with full concentration. Illatti mattum romba olunga samikirennu nenappu. Finally with milk boiled over and onion and dal, fried a bit (all these happened as i was talking over phone) i presented a delicious dinner to the two. Poor them!! But the thing is, it was like, u can eat and the side dishes tasted really good inspite of some hiccups.   What every body's mouth is watering to taste my samaiyal?  Wait wait, avvalavu seekiram invite panna maaten. Still i need to learn some special varieties which i am planning to do once my mom comes for a vacation from 18th Aug! So after my coaching classes are over, Bangaloreans, keep ur tummies empty to fill up with my Sourashtra Cuisine!   Sindu, nalla oor suthriya! Sari sari snaps aavathu anuppu enna. Nangalum nee kandukittatha kandukurome.   Why so many people have gone for Hibernation? Wake up everybody. Otherwise i will come out with my tasty preparations to be tasted by u all soon!   Hei other than Bangaloreans, u all have to wait till u get ur chance.  With lots of hopes to cook for u all soon, its  bye for now from Ranjini

      By now, its not a news anymore. It only throws up ripples of thoughts, of our days at our 'famed' campus. 2nd trimester... when we first had a glimpse of this "mystery man" who didn't marry a punjabi girl and who did MCA, all just because his mother had asked him to do so... and who stacked up a series of degrees next to his name... all just because he "felt like" studying them.  It really amazed us when he allocated topics for our seminar in the field that  we  were interested in. Be it electrical, mechanical, electronics, political science or even  biology , he was up there with no dearth of knowledge.   We knew him in the campus as someone who would ask his students to study Software Engineering book in 3 days, or teach the 25+ chapters in ERP or e-com book in less than a month... but off the campus, we know the kiddish side of him too... someone who would sneak into Rajesh/Ganesh's room in TTS to play a game of RoadRash or pick up a CD and sit down watching movies... or get tangled up with some frivolous conversation with our guys there... that made a lot of sense to him... but was just another pastime for we people. And who could forget the adventure of "looking for a girl" to get him married... or the day when we took him out for dinner to make him postpone our internal...  Now, he is not there amidst us. May be, his only unfulfilled wish was probably that he didn't get married... But looking back, I feel, its good that he didn't get married... if you understand what I mean...  From our side.. these are the things that peep in once in a while, reminding us of the harsh realities of life... Life could be so simple and yet so complex... There's a long way to go.. after all, we are hardly getting started with our lives...  and miles to go before we too sleep...

      I can't believe it even now......I always thought, Mr.Kannan, to be a very cool man....never imagined, he had hypertension or blood pressure......More than a good proffesor, he was a great man, with so much of patience......I've myself tested his patience a lot many times.....Remember, he was writing all his degrees once on the blackboard....I'm never going to meet such a mastermind, again, in my life.....May his heavenly spirit, rest in peace.....

His soul should rest in peace....Hope he had high BP as well hypertension.

      Hei what, what all of u r doing? Diwali is nearing and what u people are going to buy? I have bought two new chudi's this weekend. and will be getting a set of sarees too from my parents and my in laws. hope this diwali is going to be grand for me with many new dresses from all sides.   And ya during pooja hols, we are planning for a small trip u know... Ya we are planning for a visit to chennai on Oct 2nd & 3rd and then a trip to Pondicherry on 4th & 5th.   This weekend Ramgopal & Kishore had been to my house and we had a nice time. Hei wait i forgot to tell u, they gave me .. Best cook .. award after tasting my delicious Tomato rice and Rosemilk.   Others wait please........ I know all of u r eager to have their turn, but then dont worry i wont miss anyone.   Vijay u met sachina?  hmmmm must have felt so happy. but then Shuttle thavira Crickettum theriyuma?   And ya here is a small article on the Carnatic Music Trinity. Hope u all to enjoy reading it! ***********************************************************************    It is rarely that a phenomenon takes place in the world. An epoch-making event of far-reaching consequence that would change the course of history. The advent of sages, saints, great men of science, sacred men of art, have all heralded new beginnings in their respective realms. In the world of Indian art music, the advent of Shyama Sastri, Thyagaraja and Muthuswami Dikshitar changed the course and perception of music. The harbingers of a new age in classical music, the threesome are reverentially referred to as the Trinity of Carnatic music. Not without reason, the foremost of which was their being born in the same town and being contemporaries. But this was not the only reason. Their pioneering work was such that after their times, Carnatic music was never the same again.   Looking at their works, one finds a unity of purpose behind them. This unity of purpose is reflected in the fact that the Trinity refined the medium of the kriti and made it into a wholesome entity. They also brought into vogue several ragas that had fallen into oblivion. That they adopted almost the same methods and utilised the same tools speaks volumes about this unity of purpose. All the more reason why, they are hailed as incarnations whose specific task was to elevate the art form into a true rasAnubhavA. The art form as an experience that would ennoble the heart and lift the soul of man to greater heights. The purpose of an incarnation is to transcend and transform. Shyama Sastri, Thyagaraja, and Muthuswami Dikshitar transcended the mundane and transformed the way music was handled. The Trinity proved to the world through their music and through their exemplary lives, that the sole purpose of music was to make man perfect and help him realise his unity with God.     ***********************************************************************  (Jax: Since i got this interesting info thru mail and dont know from where its taken, i have pasted the entire article and so couldnt have link alone) A very good introduction on Muthuswami Dikshitar compostions is available in a semi classical-fusion album   Panchabuthams   featuring carnatic vocalist Bombay Jayashree, it contains compositions themed on the five elements. L. Vaidyanathan has composed the music with contemporary orchestration, while the rendition of the krithis is purely carnatic.   I happened to listen to this Casette. Hei do u people know that its brought by "Dinamalar" paper? Ya really surprised and indeed felt happy to see that such good music albums are supported and Canvassed by one of the popular daily. Supera irukku indha casette. U people need not know carnatic to listen to such songs, but then any good listener could see the beauty in each rendition. Its about 5 elelments of Nature. There are five songs , one each for Agni - Fire, Akash -Space, Vayu- Air, Anila-Water, Prtihvi -Earth and each song, preceeded by a hymn from rig veda. Actually its sung in praise of the Lord siva, who is represented in the form of five elements at five different temples in TamilNadu. A descriptive back cover helps us to learn more about the renditions.   So hope u people to plunge urself into some good and different music in days to come.  Till then  its bye !

      during last thursday and friday i thought that the sunday is going to be one of the worst sunday i had ever pass through. with the absence of ajayan(in kumbakonam) and senthil(in bangalore) i didnt know what to do. after analysed various possibilities, i decided to go to MAC statium to watch Irani cup. as i dont like going alone, i convinced one of my colleague(naren) and took him to "Rest of India" versus "Mumbai" match.   i didnt believe my eyes, my favourite, all time star, cricket god (romba overa irukko) sachin is standing just few yards away from me. the scenario was like, ROI has to chase the target around 320, and they were 90/2 at that time and the greatwall of India(dravid) and the local boy(balaji) were at the crease. the other key players i hav seen were agarkar, kambli, laxman and salvi.  around 12.15 they went for lunch. we too left for our lunch to naren's home. supppper sappadu. (chicken)biriyani, fish fry, white rice with fish kozhambu, rice with rasam, rice with moore,............. I really tired in this process, i was unable to get from the chair, so naren took me carefully to the wash basin...  initially we planned to go back to the match. but naren's friends came to his house, they pulled him to the "Thiruda Thirudi" movie. so we started to that movie, we went to 3 theatres, but in all those 3 we didnt find the ticket(not even in black). so they started to beach, but i decided to go to my room as i hav to wash my clothes. so the remaining day went in washing the clothes.  ram, dai venni yennada valliya orediya pugazhura. what u told??? "American school has taught u a lot". how can u say like that. in American school she has only very few things to learn but more things to teach. she ll teach there based on the knowledge and skill acquired from msitm(professors and classmates) da.   valli, beef rice - in chennai, in the road side fast food hotels, they usually call the beef fried rice as beef rice. reg. new members - chance kidaicha pothumae, vanchi theerthuduviyae. but i havnt expected my name to be the first one in ur list.  ranjini, un samaiyal mega serial enna achchu?  jax, sorry for not answering for ur qns reg blog layout, bcos i m not at all interested in it. anything is ok for me.  kicha, eppada formukku varuva.  sindu,mahendran,ganesh,rajesh,kavi - ellam enga poiteenga, bcos of ur absence i m posting lot of msgs, it is not good for the health of our blog. so return soon.

      Hi,  The Florida State University, Tallahassee, Florida has put up a very interesting Java applet on their site. It begins as a view of the Milky Way Galaxy viewed from a distance of 10 million light years and then zooms into towards Earth in powers of ten of distance. 10 million, to one million, to 100,000 light years and so on and then when it finally reaches a large Oak tree leaf. But that is not all it zooms into the leaf until it reaches to the level of the quarks viewed at 100 attometers. Copy and paste the link below to your browser address bar to view this:  http://micro.magnet.fsu.edu/primer/java/scienceopticsu/powersof10/index. htm  This is a fantastic representation of how magnificent the Universe is and how vastly infinite it is both in the macroscopic and the microscopic level.

      Hi, I might be busy today as I've got quite a lot of work scheduled for today and tomorrow.  I guess everyone would have harboured a thought of being a scientist at least once in thier life, wearing white lab coats, working with microscopes and other scientific equipment. Take a look at  urlLink some really interesting jobs  in the world of science. Tell me which job  you like.   And still be doing, never done. -  Samuel Butler , Hudibras  (pt.

      On to another weekend... am yet to be released from this project... its just the warranty period for maintenance (for 1 month)... not much work to do, but still they are hesitant... my PL wants me to time-share and begin work here also, but that project's PL is telling I shouldn't do anything until I'm released... I told this to my PL, he says, if he tells that the next time, ask him to talk to me... am getting sandwiched between the two...   Reminds me of how we had a similar situation tackling the two extremes of RT Swamy and Balaji during our placement activities... Though it didn't achieve anything atleast now I'm not finding myself in an unfamiliar situation...

      Hi, The reason why I had asked you all about inclusion of new members was because everyone was included in a similar fashion, if you can remember. I was just asking for the sake of it. Nothing else. But as Valli and Kicha have noted, things said to a person should be treated as it would be if the person is in front of them. Things intended in the light sense should be taken lightly.   Maybe we can have some rough guidelines to follow in the team, not rules but simple guidelines or a sort of docs and donates.  They could be related to the interactions between the members. For example, we mostly do not discuss political issues in the blog. I hope you understand what I amtrying to convey. Such a guideline would be helpful to newbies.  BTW, I cannot access the Yahoo groups for the past two days. Kicha, can you forward the recent mails to my postmark id? Don't send it to my office id da.  Valli, that was a lot of synonyms that you used. I have put up the stylesheet at my yahoo id. So if Yahoo fails, then you must have to view the blog sans styles. I am still working on them. Maybe soon. Thanks for your suggestion on the fonts.  Kavi, there is a "Switch Styles" heading on the right side. Click on any of the links to change the style of the blog. If it doesn't work, try clearing your system's cache. And if it still doesn't work, send me the browser details and the exact problem you are facing.   Note : Please do not use the quotation marks in the title of the post. It creates Javascript errors. If you want to use quotation marks, please use the following tags to indicate a quotation.  &amp;quot;example &amp;quot; .  It would be displayed as &quot;example &quot;.  It is good to have a discussion about the inclusion of people. Ideally I would be really happy if there were 45 members in the blog.    If we had no faults, we should not take such pleasure in calling attention to other people’s.  - Francois La Rochefoucauld

      I support valli's point... that "play with each other" point... it has been there in college days and continues in the blogger... and it has to be that way to maintain this cheer in the interaction...   Today I got a mail from  (name censored)  who told me in  his/her  own way that I'm trying to act smart by that last mail that I sent to msitmmb and that nobody else kidded like that. Oh...Boy..!! Has our people lost a sense of humour... or rather, lost a sense of differentiation between humour and something else... I've mailed a one-liner reply to that person saying  "But I thought you had sense of humour."   If that person gets to read this post of mine and that of valli's (I wish  he/she  does),  he/she  will get to know, the very informal and cheerful culture prevailing among us... if that person doesn't like this, then we can't help it...

      Two gentlemen from a bglr based mgt training institute, conducted a workshop for us at the end of our 5th semester. In that workshop they mentioned "Mind reads what it wants", and they explained that with few examples. The following one is somewhat similar to that.   Aoccdrnig to a rscheearch at an Elingsh uinervtisy, it deosn't mttaer in waht oredr the ltteers in a wrod are, the olny iprmoetnt tihng is  taht frist and lsat ltteer is at the rghit pclae. The rset can be a toatl mses and you can sitll raed it wouthit porbelm. Tihs is bcuseae we do not raed ervey lteter by it slef but the wrod as a wlohe.  to Xavier, xavy there is no point in asking whether to add someone from our msitmmb group to blogger or not. bcos u clearly mentioned in ur mails to msitmmb as, "If you want to become a member, the only requisite is 'active' participation." "The blogger group is not a form of elite group where only a few are welcome.

      Yesterday it went really nice. Myself, Ajayan and Senthil(my friend) left our home around 12pm in two bikes for purchasing dresses for ajayan. i think everyone know ajayan's another name, ie., Royal. if anyone doesnt know, then dont worry at the end of this blog u ll come to know it.  First we went to Nungambakkam High Road and get into "Cavin Kellys" show room, after commenting abt all the dresses present there, atlast ajayan selected a trouser, fortunately for his size that model was not available. i said fortunately bcos we wanted to escape from there without buying anything, so now we got a reason for that and escaped from there. Then we went to the "Basics" showroom which is also present in the same road. Ajayan only showed interest in seeing all the dress, but hasnt interested in buy one. but this time i didnt want him to escape from there, so i thought of kozhi pudichifying him, senthil too helped me, so senthil and myself ran here and there and selected some shirts and one of us told ajayan this one was really superb, then other one opposed, no da this one suits u better. but after putting all those efforts ajayan told in a very cool manner, ok i select this shirt but we hav enough time, so why dont we go to some other show rooms and come back in the evening and take this shirt. but somehow senthil convinced him and made him to buy a shirt. so he took almost 2 hours to buy a single shirt, then we had our lunch at Ceylon hotel.   We continued our purchasing, because there is no more show rooms at Nungambakkam High Road, we went to Pondy Bazaar. There we went to "Derby" show room. Here Ajayan selected a trouser immediately, bcos that trouser matched very well to the shirt we bought earlier. Ajayan told come on we can continue our purchasing, bcos he needs to buy one more pair. but senthil told we can go some where else.  Muttukkadu ---------- So we started to Muttukadu, it is famous for its backwater and boating. it is 30kms away from our place and it lies in ECR(East Coast Roadways). it was a very nice experience to drive in this road, the people who travelled in this road know y i m saying like this, bcos it is difficult to find such a road in our Tamilnadu. After rasichifying the crowd for sometime, we decided to take a boat along with a helper. once our boat moved little bit, ajayan got the oar from the helper and he begin to row the boat. initially he struggled, but after that he did well. asai yaarai vittathu? so i too tried, the helper patiently told me how to ride 3 to 4 times, but even after that i havnt did well, so he took incharge. after that we walked to the centre of the bridge present over that backwater and stand there and viewed the sea from there, it was amazing to see the sea from that view. then we started from there to our place(T.Nagar).  Continued purchasing --------- ---------- After returned to our home from muttukkadu, ajayan again started saying abt purchasing, so avan thondharavu thanga mudiyama, we started from our place. but it was almost 7.30 at that time, still we went to Madura Garments factory outlet, which is present in Velachery. we reached there by 7.45, but the security told they closed it 7pm itself. I was too hungry, so I thought of having some snacks, so we went to a Food World present in Velachery. We only entered to buy something to korichifying, but ended with a Rs.800 bill, bcos senthil and ajayan potti pottu kittu bought axe effect,this effect and that effect. i silently watched all these things and when we came out it was 8.30, but ajayan was still strong in his points, said that we hav to buy dress now itself. so we went back to our home, left the vehicles there and ran to Jeyachandran textiles. There he bought a Van Heusen shirt and Sparky trouser. Appada, oru vazhiya ajayan dress eduthu mudithan. Have u now understand what Royal means? To wind up the day we had our usual beef rice and special milk and we went to bed.   Note:- ------- If i bored u with this blog, then u can very well  scold  valli, bcos she only mentioned that if i continuously send msgs in general then she ll rename my name. so who is going to take the honor of scolding her first?  a kind request, i dont know to use a better word in place of scolding, i searched in online dictionaries, even i had come up with lot of words, i dont know whether i can use them in this place or not, so pls post some synonyms for scolding with examples of where & how to use it. this is the nice opportunity for everyone, bcos in the examples u can use the name of the person whom u like(?) most. it is default that u all like(?) me most, so dont use my name, use some others name.

      Hi,  Now on to my views... Its been kinda fancy in some channels to project countries like India and its poverty in the most "pathetic" ever way possible... A few programmes I could recollect...   AXN - there was some travel program where India's railway stations and a typical sleeper class coach was shown to be "dirty and stinky"... they showed a beggar begging in  the platform and the program host was emotional and said "this is poverty for u"...   Naional Geographic.. a quiz program was on... and the question was "What does an Indian style toilet comprise?" and the answer "A hole in the ground".. imagine some non-Indian hearing this... what would he imagine of a "hole in the ground" being used as a toilet...   and in one program in BBC there was an interview with some guy (an Indian), I forgot who... he was talking about how India is perceived by other nations.. and what he told was "Some people still think India is a country of kings and demons... while there are others too, who understand India as an intellectual capital.."  But my question is, does America stand any differnt... In fact, the so-called Americans do not even belong there... the native Americans (also known as Indians or red-Indians) are the actual natives who were overthrown by the British/European settlers... the native Americans live in ridges and valleys and most are not even aware that something called electricity exists... they are still a century behind in development... who is to be blamed.. the so-called Americans... (this part is courtesy: Oprah Winfrey show)...  But still we are left at the mercy of being projected in whatever way the world likes to see us.. We do have shortcomings... we are poor compared to other developed nations... education levels are lesser.. no doubt... but are the other countries spotless...???   Its only that, we are still dependant on the heftier nations... and they wouldn't hesitate to pass such actions... after all, they call the shots... But its only a question of time... it could be a few decades... and India might well be seen atleast much better positioned than what it is now...

      Sure Valli, I know what typing is, but I don't know how to type. I'm more of a four-finger typist. I use two fingers of each hand to type. But interestingly, a couple of days ago, I got to a site where I found a software to help  type  pout text faster on the screen. It is really an innovative piece of software. It is titled  urlLink  Dasher  . It sure looks good. I am trying it out  right now. The s/w is very small in size (about 580 kb). Try it out.  Valli, why don't you try voice recognition s/w. It is available in Office Xp. All you need is a good microphone and some time to spare. Once you get the voice recognition trained to recognize your voice, you can reduce your typing to a great extent. Any help in this regard, contact me.  Will get back to the discussion later. I've got an interesting question for all of you.

      Hi,    Great to see so many soothing words    Yep Rini, i read that article, as soon as it was posted....The moral was really good....but the style, it was presented ...was a bit tuff....I lose the ultimate point to be grasped in such cases......The author is right....we are losing our spiritual & Cultural integrity......need to debug all those corruptions.......    If i'm right, Ganesh is getting closer to stuffs offered in polytechnic schools. & his idea of "Work while u learn" is something very very very important, that has to be inculcated in our system......When students stand independently, they get the confidence to fulfil their dreams.....I really had that feel of personal satisfaction, when a group of us, worked in the Samsung exhibition.....  wanted to share many more views with you.....but, i don't know...somehow it takes a long time for me to type ...Xavier do u know typing?.....  I have my Dental appointment this evening (just the regural check-up & cleaning stuffs. It's just one of those attractive offers, our insurance company gives us). My dentist is a soft lady, who does her work so sincerely, that she flosses so hard inbetween my teeth & end up in making my gums bleed!!!

      Hi, Regarding valli's opinion, i think we should not care much about what is shown in foreign media. but there r a lot of things that have to be done here in India regarding education. I personally think that our education system needs a lot of changes.   A lot of factors can be said regarding why poor people do not send their children to school. but that can be changed by bringing in few changes.   This iam saying with those poor children in mind. my views on what can be changed are:  1. It is waste of time in having so many subjects in our syllabus. we study history & geography right from 1st to 10th standard. the same old wars, asoka, buddha, india, ocean, mountains etc. these subjects can be stopped in 5th standard.   i think basic english, maths & science is more than enough. what importantly can be taught is other subjects related to work. for eg like carpentry, painting etc. there r so many in this world. this can be taught after say 12 years of age. by this he can also earn some money along with his education.  but then we may hear a few voices which will say there should be no child labour. we think we should not care about it. if a child enjoys what he is doing then how can it be harmful to him. he will only gain more by expereince. this will not be a 12 hours job which some children go thru now. he will also get time to enjoy his youth.  Goverment should play a important role in this. it is giving so many subsidies for so many unwanted things. those can be reduced or stopped and this kind of education should be encouraged. then only we will see a next generation which thinks logically, votes to select the leader he wants, which is not poor etc.  See kicha, abdul kalam cannot come every where for everything. it is we who should do something. we r the present generation and it is in our hands to do something may be after another 5 years of time.  We should be happy that these kind of issues r being discussed here. but it is also important that we play a role in implementing atleast some of them.  bye

      Hei they are in 2003 folder of our group photos album. Hei have u subscribed to our groups thru yahoo id? Only then u can access these, else u cant. Hope u have.  Regarding education portrayal, the scenario is going to change ma. Slowly there is an awareness in people about this. U r also an example of it. the anger in u is an example that u deny the fact that the education that what we get in India is not as low as whats been portrayed. But then its obviously low when compared to the intellectual property possessed by our forerunners. Similarly in most of the fields we are depicted with low values which we have never cared to give enough attention and we let it go astray. But then now people are realising that its not the case. And i think in forth coming days, we will surely try to behave more refined and prove them that, the notion which others carry, about our nation is not true. To make this happen it needs proper understanding of our culture and live as an execution of it to them.   If u read the article which i had posted a few days ago about Education in India, it will help u understand the underlying facts that obviously we are far to go in certain things. Yes to set right things which were made wrong by british is a mamoth task, but then there is always a hope in me that it will happen. What u speak about here is the external facts of the current education system. To be frank it seems, its the poverty that made u feel anger and by the peripheral things we cant judge the education system. Read that article once again to have more light on current system of education and how britishers were higly successful in achieving what he needed. Yes, he wanted us to become a foreigner in our own land and here we are good example of it. He could wisely cut us off from all the treasured knowledge and let us squander thru all the nasty meanders of the dark part of life and let us not think but only work as said. How tragic its to imagine the once so rich nation, not so long ago, probably around 250 years ago whose % in world trade was 25% of the world trade is now having just 0.5% as its share in world trade. But USA whose history dates not so long back, and which dint exist few hundred years ago is now doing 25% of the world trade. How we have left all our riches to drain.......   Got some work now, will continue in next blog Ranjini

      Hi Valli,  The other things like social conditions, plight of women and also working conditions at times project our nation in a bad light. I would agree that a few portions are true. But generalisation of the conditions as Indian is unacceptable.  Blogger has changed a few of its services. Expect a lot more of these changes in the future. A spell check option is also available.

      It is true that India is being projected as such in foreign televisions. I can understand your anger. But you would have to admit that it is the truth. A large percentage of our population live in rural areas where education  per se  has no value at all.   There is an ad going around in Indian TV channels showing a young girl (a Rajasthani or Gujarati girl) going for an eye checkup. The doctor (a lady) asks her to read the eyechart. The girl remains silent. The doctor once agains asks her to read. Yet the girl is silent. Then the girl's father says softly she cannot read.   My first reaction on seeing the ad for the first time was rage (on the girl's father for not sending his daughter to the school.) The next couple of times I saw the ad, I noticed the dresses and the condition of the girl and her parents. They were poor people. The truth hit me. They do want to send thier daughter to school but they cannot afford it. You can see it in their eyes. Then my anger turned to pity.   I can recall a similar incident told by my aunt. This happenned in Madurai, just opposite our MK University. My aunt, working in MKU school, says that she finds it difficult to get children to come to school from the nearby areas. A parent told this to her she asked him why he was not sending his son to school.   &quot;I am a stone breaker. I get around  x  ruppees every day. My son if he works with will also earn around some  x  ruppees. We can use this money for our daily gruel. If my son goes to study, we will have to forgo a certain amount of money every day which we cannot. Additionally, we might also have to bear the education costs. So I will send my son to study if I am somehow assured of getting the same amount of money that my son will earn if he works.&quot;  How would you answer this question?  The problem is that a majority of the people in India are poor. It is a truth that we Indians should accept first. Secondly, the cost of education is high, as you might have known. Thirdly, the cost of educating a student is also high. A government has to spend a lot in terms of infrastructure, salaries and other things.   So what can be done? You cannot blame the people; you cannot blame the government. The least you can do is wring your hands in despair.  Yet all is not lost. We can change things through several ways. How you can change things is best left to the individual to decide. But things have to be changed.  Indian education is not the only thing that is shown in a bad light in foreign media. So what can be done on that? your thoughts...  Here are a couple of quotes on education.    To prepare us for complete living is the function which education has to discharge.  -- H. Spenser.     Education : That which discloses to the wise and disguises from the foolish their lack of understanding.    Which of the above is more true? You decide...

      hey,         yesterday evening, while having dinner, i was just switching over channels looking out for any game shows or talk shows. I ended up in one of the state local channels, which concentrates on kids.....they telecast kids shows & try to teach them something evrytime......yesterday, they were telecasting a documentary with the topic "Education in other countries"....for the rest of the post, just imagine the reels u used to watch in theatres before the actual movie being played......         First came a poor Japenese kid (10 yrs).....wakes up in the morning, has their kind of breakfast (inbetween he talks to the camera, which is being translated for us)Japan seems to be very clean, his outfits are really good, his classroom is very tidy, he comes back home & relaxes himself in a bath tub(remember he's poor).....Then a poor girl from Benin was shown (same 10 yrs).....has two sisters & two brothers(she too talks the same way to the camera, describing their life style).....her mother lost her job when the last baby was born......she's wearing torn out clothes, her bros were with shorts.......If the kids go to school their mom will get a stypend of $15/month & a packet of food everyday.....her class room is just a small hut, with 60 other kids in her class....they are asked to practise writing alphabets & numbers on the walls.....In the evning, they cook somehting, thta looks like porridge & everybody has that for dinner.....then came an poor Indian girl, named Neeraj.....from a village in Rajasthan......she did'nt know her age correctly.....she's going for school only for the past one yr....that too, night school, where only girls learn....she's already engaged to a guy, & will get married in another 5 to 6 yrs.....the whole morning, she works in her in-law's home.....evening she goes to school....but the guys, they go to the morning school.....her granny says education is a waste for her grand daughter.....only life'll teach her.....they cook in mud stoves (three stones on three corners, firewood in between)the place around is not tidy at all......they have roti for dinner( which was told as dry bread here)......& then came a Rumanian kid, then a brazilian kid & one another kid from south Africa.......        Finally their conclusion was, the kids from Japan & Rumania....their education is safe it seems, & hence thier lives too,....but for kids form the other developing nations, their education is not so promising, it seems.....So, when a kid here, watches this show, u know how he picturasizes India in his mind. I was really wondering.....are Kids like Neeraj, the majority in India....Shld this how, India be picturarised?.....I do agree that, there are kids who can'y afford to go to school in India.....but to give a true picture of India & Indian kids(any country for that matter), they shld have taken a kid from a middle class family (Which is the majority of our country)....ennavo oru inam puriyaadha kovam.....is my anger worthy enough????guys, need ur inputs on this.......

      yesterday i went to kumarapalayam to attend my colleague's marriage function. after that function was over i started to coimbatore to meet our friends there.  from the moment i landed in coimabatore xavier took incharge of me. from there onwards i was totally under his control, he took me to a nice hotel(where we had our breakfast during our coimbatore-ooty tour) and ordered whatever he liked, sorry whatever I liked, vittah sappittu mudichathum kaiyila rupaayum kuduthiruppan. after lunch i waited in a browsing center for either xavier or bala or rajesh to come after finishing their work.  xavier came back from the office and picked me, then we went to bala's office, he hasnt turned out from the field. so xavi took me to his house, there xavier provided me a nice bed to take rest, original home made coffee and kerala chips to refresh. bala and rajesh came there when i just started to see the movie "kakka kakka". imsainga vantha vudanae off pannittanuka. antha padathai theatrela poi than parkanumam, yenna avanukallukku theatrela ticket kidaikkalaiyam, so naanum athu mathiri kastappadanumam. rajesh told abt his first day exp, may be he ll post it.   thank God, around 8.30pm they left xavier's house, i m waiting for that moment for long time. bcos, xavier's mom prepared idly for me. so once they left, xavier asked me to take idlies, but it was 8.45 at that time, actually that was the reporting time for my bus. my watch was showing only 8.30, then only i realized it has slowed down. i thought of skip the dinner and start from there, but xavier, his mom and dad havnt allowed me, they compelled me to eat idly. nice idlies but i took only 3 as i dont hav time, his mom alos prepared paayasam, wow it was really superb, but due to time constraint i had only 4 spoons. yenna tastu, unmaiyilaiyae supera irunthuchu. BTW, xavier called to KPN travels and informed that i m on the way and asked them to wait for me. i not even told his mom abt her samaiyal and left the place.  xavier dropped me in KPN travels exactly when the bus was abt to start. omitting bala and rajesh from the scene, i had a very nice time in coimbatore. xavierukku romba nandri kadan pattirukken.  this morning around 7.30am i reached chennai safely.   intha kadhai ithudan mudinthathu. ithil kurappatta sambavangal anaithum unmaiyae. so ithu yaar manathaiyum punnakkinaal, marunthu poda kaasu kodukka pada maattathu.

      Hi guys, as our mail server had some problem, we couldnt access net for the past two days and so i had a tough time working all the work hours. Anyway it helped me do a lot of things which were pending and gear up my way of work.  Hei one more news guys, really speaking i have joined carnatic vocal classes from last week and hope to continue. Not only that, i have also joined Classical dance class too. Adha mattum yen viduvanennu thaan. But ya its for my sake i am learning and not for entertaining others. So people dont worry, i wont test u to hear all my songs. Innum kathukkave aarambikkala adhukkula ippadi oru padam pottutu irukken.   both are tough and i wish to manage it atleast for a year or so. Wish me u all please!  Hei thanx for ur response to RWH, though i couldnt read much due to net problem. Once its set right i will read and post back my opinion to our cm rajesh.   Jax that article was sent by srini and i dont know where from he had picked it up.   It ofcourse was a controversial article in his group and thought such discussion would be triggered in our group too and posted it and i could see no response. Its ok, it happens. Valli where r u photos? Have u made me eligible to access? If so send me the link. Ok. by the way i have uploaded my snaps on to our group , there are few which i dint send to u people. so check out for those in our group.  Ganesh "Midnight walking" made me feel that u r going to review some english movie. Never thought u were the hero of that movie. Thrilling it would have been.....  Hei i forgot to tell u guys .... cha blunder of my life!  Ofcourse, u people know that i am not interested in watching movies and for the first time, srini was successful in convincing me to go to a movie. He told , the movie choice was mine. I am totally untouuhed by any movie these days and i know only those which my colleagues or friends talk about, or the one whose critic or review i read. Other than that i was totally cut from movie world.   Dint know which movie to go..... But then remembered that "Koi Mil gaya" got released and read about it in some magazine and heard one of my colleague telling about the demand for the movie tickets and many hye stories about the movie and opted for that. So we along with 2 of his friends decided to go for the movie and started.....  Kadavule padam poi utkaarntha illa theriyuthu, namma oor Jagan mohinila varra alavukku kooda maayajaalam illatha uppu chappu illatha Kolanthainga padam. I was bugged up totally. Such a nasty acting by Hrithik and very weak story line. I had a good headache when i came out of the theatre u know. Dhath......... But then he had to get me Pineapple papaya ice cream @ Baskin robbins to get rid of that nasty feeling of having watched a kothu movie. Adhu supera irundathu.  It was hyped in a way that i imagined it to be full of graphics, special effects and my disappointment was deeper than Mariana's trench. Cha inime padame nee paarkaama irukarthu thaan nallathunnu srini feel panra alavukku aaiyi pochu en nilamai.  Really my hope on movies got lost like anything.  The worst part was, the two friends who accompanied us knew that the movie was not that good and still they made way, since i had opted for. Really it was sick saturday evening this weekend.  Ok then will blog more about my weekend tales in my next blog if my n/w is set right. till then bye

      Kicha, it's good to hear that your project is almost over. Looking forward for lots of posts on the difficulties you might have faced during your project.   Ganja, what was it about you being a cowboy? Has the Tiruchi sun affected you?  Valli, the photos were nice, Sindhu where are your photos of your UK roundings?  Vijay, hope you reached Chennai safely?  Manny and Kavi, how is Chennai now, hot or cold?  Rini and Ram, any interesting news? Seems both of you are very busy for the past week.

      Hi, 	Its been a while and I've been tied up a lot with my stupid project. This weekend it will be delivered to the customer. Irrespctive of whether I'll be released from it or retained for the 1 month warranty, I hope the work pressure to come back to normal over the next week.  Amidst all the hurdles I faced in the project - both attitude-wise and otherwise... a few things this has taught me - What it means to have a "work stress". I'm reminded of all the stress management workshops where we had skits and other performances on how to handle stress. It was such great fun doing all that stuff in college days.. but facing it is altogether a different matter. Its a test of nerves, as I see it.   Another aspect I've learnt... my usual dept is the R&D unit (called SETLabs, as u might know)... where its only research that happens and very little interaction with the customers.. if at all we interact with customers, it would be for some requirement analysis or consulting and never for any kind of delivery work. But project is an entirely different thing. The moment u have someone called customer to deal with, it no longer remains the conventional 9-5 job. As we've learnt "Customer is King... (and blah..blah..)".. Now I know why he is the king... and how he has to be treated.   Third point... Leadership... my PL at SETLabs is a person who takes utmost care of his words and would make sure, he get things done in the kindest possible way.. but still make it clear that he means business... But it was the other extreme in the project... I would rate the project's PL 4/10 on leadership qualities while rate my PL 8/10. And I learnt a lot of things here too... I remember a quote that I used in one of Mr.Raja G'swamy's class.. "If u want to be good, u have to know what is not good".. in similar lines, I learnt how just a little way of speaking demoralizes the entire team.. I learnt all about what a leader should not do.. coz I was the one suffering...  Its been a really hard struggle for me over the last 2.5 months or so in this project.. its not over yet... but atleast not a very long way to go (hopefully)...

      Yesterday, Rajesh and Bala had come over to Coimbatore to search for houses. Beofre embarking on thier search, they came to visit me and later on we went to see Karthiga.  I promised them I will look at a few houses, which of course I did. They saw a few houses and didn't like them.  I guess Rajesh will be posting about his house-hunt shortly.  Today, Had a surprise. Vijay Babu was in town. After lunch, I left him at a browsing center to spend his time.   More later.

      hi,  yesterday i had said that a mgmt skill is necessary.  For example if a person is an extrovert he may be suitable for marketing etc. so for identifying that the workshop would be helpful and most important is with a professor like Mr Raja Govindaswamy.  I will suggest the following tips for persons who wish to get into marketing.   First choose a city where u think  there r more oppurtunities for marketing . for eg chennai, bangalore etc.  U should know the local language of that particular city like tamil or kannada.this is a must because without local language u cannot go & speak to a local customer.  Have a definition of marketing and the difference between marketing & sales always in ur purse.becoz as a fresher these r the two definite questions they will ask in an interview if u go as a fresher.(Questions out pannitenna hehehe) I always keep one & still i have it with me.(i know u r all laughing because i used to bit adichify in exams & it continues even in interviews)   Second delete all the IT projects & packages u know from ur resume. u can include at the most Ms office.( padichethalleam waste aaa )  Third after joining in a job the same evening post ur resume in all the job websites & keep applying for all the jobs u see.  If u r in a company which is big (say for eg Reliance ) u will definitely get atleat 5 calls for interview in a week.  If u get a good offer with a hike in salary go for that job. this process can go on till u settle down into a good company where u think there will be growth and where there is good salary.  These r the tips i can give with my expereince so far in marketing and sales.  Bye

      By kidding Vijay Babu, I have heared advices / suggestions from most of you people, Thanks, Thanks again.....  Yeah coming to mine......  What we lacked (I Certainly see & feel in my job career) is v r not aware of the exact things going on in the business world while v r doing our studies..... V had a wonderfull opportunity for spending 1 month of First year vacation in a company.... But most of us didnt used it properly.... But I am not frustrated with my current job (my first job) coz we should accept whatever we get and tune overself towards what we can provide in this job; side by side sharpenning our saw (i.e, core competancy, or ur life aim whatever you put) than to get sulk over the issues arrising out of the current job....  What I have mentioned above is for tuning yourself for a long term career..... I go with Vijay's suggestion for an immediate get thru for a job after studies....  To succeed in life.... The same thing "THINK WIN - u r sure to win" Thinking any one can do...  But u should feel u r winning.... crossing a pebble over the expeditition towards Everest is also a situation where u have won....  Believe u can do with full cofidence not even a nanocm less that that... then u have achieved.  yeah, rest personally....  Cheers Ram

      Hi,  I am giving my views on what juniors could do :  1) I think when doing our course itself they should be adept in IT & any one of the mgmt side also(may be marketing or hr or finance which ever they r good in) To fine out in which they r good in i think our workshop on mgnt skills will be of great help. because if u see 50 % of the people today the work they r doing will be irrelevant to their education.  so i do not think in todays job market they should restrict themselves to IT alone.  more on this tomorrow.  bye

      hi,  I didnt mean to post my last msg.....i was typing 1 or 2 lines inbetween my work.....dont know what i did...it's in blog!!! anyway...thank you Xavier, your link abt RWH cleared my head.  Regarding Vijay Babu's question...as most of you said...i am not sure either....cos i want to change my job now..but dont know what field to choose....im in real limbo....in UK mgt job means sales and marketing.....the title may differ from company to company but the role is the same.....telemarketing!!!.....i dont want that sort of job....i want a mgt job in an IT company....this is what im doing right now! my current job profile is ok but not the company.....when i try to look out for a job there is not much scope for me.... all I can tell our juniors is.......be focussed in what you want.....develop your core competencies in the chosen field!  All the plans for TN govt sounds promising....just waiting for the day we see the result! bcos all I do is compare the atmosphere in here with what we got in India......v really wonder many times...' when these dumb heads can have such sophisticated living, why not we, who are much more superior and advanced in technology? ' as far as im concerned....the core reason for what India is today is ' CORRUPTION '.....i dont say corruption doesnt exist here....it does....but not for petty things and more importantly when it comes to the question of people's welfare!   bye

      everyone responded very well for the topic "career guidance to our juniors".   i assume that i know something more than what our juniors know abt job market and tell the following to them.  for the people who interested in mgmt - many of u think of getting into a marketing job. no problem for u, as far as u dont consider the company & the product/service u r going to market. but if u want to get into a good company, prepare general apptitude well, bcos most of the companies r conducting written test as part of screening process. thorough with basic concepts of marketing, that ll be helpful to u in the interview.   for the people who interested in IT - software development - u hav to be good in apptitude, C, C++(basics) & the technology in which u did the projects. definitely u can get into a good company. dont worry abt the companies which r not allowing M.Sc to take up the test, bcos only very few companies r like that. contacts r very important in IT field, so try to establish ur network, that ll get u the opportunities.  people who interested in getting into technical field but not interested in software development - u have got plenty of other opportunities like software testing, Call centres providing technical support, Content Development, etc.  in general dont give up at any point of time. u ll succeed.  -vijay

       On education : Rini, a very good use of an interesting article. I would like to know the source of the article. It seems familiar but I don't remember where I read it.  Universities are a fount of knowledge. Some come to drink, some just to gargle.   On RWH : You hit the nail on the head when you said that planning alone is not going to solve any problems. Execution is the other part (reference: our Principles of Management class).  I had read an interesting article in the Sunday edition of Hindu a few years back. I don't know if it is available online. I hope, in addition to Rajesh's reference, you have the time to visit   urlLink this link . It is wonderfully written with lots and lots of examples and diagrams.   As you had said, everyone is forced to invest in a rainwater harvesting system without undestanding why it is required or how it should be implemented. I have never seen anything in the media in the recent past highlighting how RWh is to be implemented. All I had seen is our CM delivering a monologue on the benefits and reprecussions if you don't install RWH.   Now every house has a RWH, but will it function as intended is to be seen in the days to come.  I have also posted another post in  urlLink "Quod scripsi, scripsi"  for your perusal. I may not be updating it daily, but I'll inform you if I update it.

      Good rajesh, it helped me to get a picture of what current TN govt. is planning. but then i would be happy to listen that all these plans have fruitified rather than a change of govt. left all these plans at the planning stage itself. I think, its not one of the election stunt which politicians usually do.  Has there been any accomplished tasks by our govt. recently, apart from planning? And did all ur people have ur houses dug up with rain water harvest pits? Yes, its there at my place and also at my inlaws place.   Hope these pits not to disappear in years time with all mud on road. Rajesh has our CM made any provision to insist that these pits should be left open or covered properly and not become waste in course of time? The sad thing is, most of them are trying to just make a pit and put some stone(jalli) and then let the water get into it rather than adopting the exact method of stuffing with charcoal, fine sand, coarse sand and things like that. Hei guys, can u come up with how the pit should be stuffed? If i am clear about how it should be, then i am interested in submitting a proposal of insisting to check the healthy condition of pits once in a year or insist that if not.  And on to Vijay babu's ques, i like answering to it with a quote in general on the current Indian Education system . Here starts the quote............. (I have posted it onto our groups too)    One of the most remarkable features of British rule in India has been the fact that the greatest injuries done to the people of India have taken the form of blessings. Of this, Education is a striking example; for no more crushing blows have ever been struck at the roots of Indian National evolution than those which have been struck, often with other, and the best intentions, in the name of Education....   The most crushing indictment of this Education is the fact that it destroys, in the great majority of those upon whom it is inflicted, all capacity for the appreciation of Indian culture.   Speak to the ordinary graduate of an Indian University, or a student from Ceylon, of the ideals of the Mahabharata he will hasten to display his knowledge of Shakespeare; talk to him of religious philosophy you find that he is an atheist of the crude type common in Europe a generation ago, and that not only has he no religion, but he is as lacking in philosophy as the average Englishman; talk to him of Indian music he will produce a gramophone or a harmonium, and inflict upon you one or both; talk to him of Indian dress and jewellery he will tell you that they are uncivilized and barbaric; talk to him of Indian art it is news to him that such a thing exists; ask him to translate for you a letter written in his own mother-tongue he does not know it. He is indeed a stranger on his own land.  It is hard to realize how completely the continuity of Indian life has been severed. A single generation of English education suffices to break the threads of tradition and to create a nondescript and superficial being deprived of all roots  a sort of intellectual pariah who does not belong to the East or the West, the past or the future. The greatest danger for India is the loss of her spiritual integrity. Of all Indian problems the educational is the most difficult and most tragic.  Ananda Coomaraswamy    There is a need for change in the education ssytem as such and i dont know to comment on what we got in our Master's! I really wonder what we get in Universities and educational institution now a days is the true education! When i myself is not clear about it, i dont want to advice others and confuse them too. so leave them to decide on education for their choice. Adhayum choicela vidaama irundha sari!!!!!!!!!!

       with reference to our discussion reg environment awareness we had on blogger a few months b4 here are some steps that are taken by tamilnadu government.Tell your views about this and if you have some suggestions kindly publish it here so that it can also be submitted to the government.   The Tamil Nadu Government is turning a welcome shade of green with Chief Minister J Jayalalithaa announcing a series of measures to protect animals and the environment.  From banning animal sacrifice and protecting elephants to cleaning Chennai's famed Marina Beach and enforcing rainwater systems in every house, Jayalalithaa is doing it all.  And most of it has happened in the last fortnight alone.  The immediate provocation for banning animal sacrifice came from a complaint about 500 buffaloes being "sacrificed to God" in a village in Tiruchirapalli district with senior police officials watching.  "A ban is already in force under the Tamil Nadu Animals and Birds Prevention of Sacrifice Act of 1950. However, the provisions of the Act are often breached. Therefore, people should be educated not to do so," said a letter from the Chief Minister to district heads.  She also ordered that the senior police official present at the spot be suspended.  For political expediency or otherwise, Jayalalitha has supported the proposed federal legislation for a ban on cow slaughter.  Responding to reports of a temple elephant running amok and injuring its mahout because it was "too stressed out" and another being forced to beg on Chennai streets, Jayalalitha took several corrective measures to "de-stress" captive pachyderms.  Elephants used and kept in Tamil Nadu's temples have been granted a holiday for the first time in their lives. Moreover, the government has ordered that all temple elephants be kept in a camp for one month in a year.  The one-month camp would not only be a holiday but also an occasion for an annual compulsory health check up.  Jayalalitha has asked officials to ensure that all 41 temple elephants in Tamil Nadu temples, on government records, are taken to the rest camps.  Besides, a coordination committee with representatives from the government and the temples have been entrusted with the task of identifying distressed elephants.  And there is still more.  To take tips on how to go about the job, a special team of experts has been formed to study protection and healthcare measures for elephants in Guruvayur temple in neighbouring Kerala.  On another front, the Jayalalitha government's environment activism has resulted in a compulsory rainwater harvesting system in every building in Tamil Nadu.  The deadline for implementation is August 31. If buildings don't comply, municipalities will enforce the system and cut fresh water connections from the corporations.  The Marina beach in Chennai too has been cleaned up vigorously by the civic authorities, which even demolished all old structures on the beach last week.  Enforcement agencies would keep a vigil to ensure that people don't litter the beach.  The government has this week also come out with a notice to fishermen asking them to confine fishing only to specially demarcated areas.  The department of fisheries held a meeting this week to give notice to the millions of fishermen working in the state's 1,000-km coastline through the Tamil Nadu Fishermen's Union.  Besides, the government has been working at Tamil Nadu's largest vegetable wholesale market on the outskirts of Chennai to generate 5,000 units of power every day from bio-waste.  To be set up at a cost of Rs 5 crore, the plant would supply power to the market itself. This bio-methanon plant would be supported by the ministry of non-conventional energy and United Nations Development Programme (UNDP).  Another pet project is Enviro Vision 2005 set up to monitor the quality of air, water and land resource in Tamil Nadu as part of a 15-point agenda for development.  A federal grant of Rs 492 crore is being used to clean up Chennai's five canals and rivers.  When complete, the city river conservation project will help plug the 422 outlets into the waterways flowing through Chennai.  A Rs 37 crore project to stop sewage flow into the Cauvery river is also being implemented.  Many more plans are expected

      A group of children are playing near two railway tracks, one still in use while the other disused.  Only one child is playing on the disused track,the rest on the operational track. The train comes, and you are just beside the track interchange. You could make the train change its course to the disused track and save most of the kids. However, that would also mean the lone child playing by the disused track would be sacrificed.  Or would you rather let the train go its way?  Let's take a pause to think what kind of decision we could make. Most people might choose to divert the course of the train, and sacrifice only one child. You might think the same way, I guess.  Exactly, I thought the same way initially because to save most of the children at the expense of only one child was rational decision most people would make, morally and emotionally.But, have you ever thought that the child choosing to play on the disused track had in fact made the right decision to play at a safe place? Nevertheless, he had to be sacrificed because of his ignorant friends who chose to play where the danger was.  This kind of dilemma happens around us everyday. In the office,community, in politics and especially in a democratic society, the minority is often sacrificed for the interest of the majority, no matter how foolish or ignorant the majority are, and how farsighted and knowledgeable the minority are. The child who chose not to play with the rest on the operational track was sidelined. And in the case he was sacrificed, no one would shed a tear for him.  The friend who forwarded me the story said he would not try to change the course of the train because he believed that the kids playing on the operational track should have known very well that track was still in use, and that they should have run away if they heard the train's sirens.  If the train was diverted, that lone child would definitely die because he never thought the train could come over to that track! While we are all aware that life is full of tough decisions that need to be made, we may not realize that hasty decisions may not always be the right one.

      The Mercedes Logo      The "Mercedes" name was registered right back in 1902, but at that time there was no logo or trademark to accompany it. The idea for the 'Star' logo came when Paul and Adolf Daimler, the two sons of the company's founder (and then in charge of the business) remembered that their father had once used a star symbol in his family correspondence.   Their father, Gottlieb Daimler, had been technical director of the Deutz gas engine factory from 1872 until 1881. At the beginning of his employment there, he had marked a star above his own house on a picture postcard of Cologne and Deutz, and had written to his wife that this star would one day shine over his own factory to symbolize prosperity.  In June 1909 the company registered both three-pointed and four-pointed stars as trademarks. Although both designs were legally protected, only the three-pointed star was ever used. From 1910 onwards it began to appear at the front of the cars as a design feature on the radiator.  The three-points of the star were supposed to represent Daimler's ambition of universal motorization: "on land, on water and in the air".  Over the years the logo evolved, to include the 'Benz' laurel wreath, and then, in 1923, the three-pointed star enclosed in a circle was registered as a trademark.  Since then it has changed little, and is now a powerful symbol and integral part of the Mercedes-Benz brand.

      Ada paavi, inime ethaachum anupinaa olunga nee eluthinathaa illa vera yaarodathaannu mention pannu ya. no probs let my words of praise soon become true. Ofcourse u too can write like them. And sujatha is not a great writer but ofcourse unique coz of his flare for writing things which are more scientific which very few writers almost none are popular. Some are good, but not all of his works. For me a writer when he attains a level in writing should be able to produce stuffs which are of better or equally good quality and not less than that. If i start feeling so, then i dont feel like getting back to the writer with the same interest as i did earlier but never shun him totally too with the hope that he might produce something better than that. Recent days i felt a sag in his writing and it double up when i read a story of his recently. At the same time, i read Srirangathu Devathaigal in Kumudam or vikadan i dont know and was impressed by his mild strokes of humour and lauded the lifestyle of their fun filled way of living in those days at srirangam except for the last story in the series. Yes when i read the stories, i felt it was true and almost could take me to those days. But then the last one failed to. dint know y! more after lunch.......

      Jax i think, u dint get what i exactly meant. See its going to be from one of the articles which interests others other than the usual fun stuff..  Again i too feel that implementing is time consuming. but then when u have done enough to create a blog with much sophistication, i think doing this will take a day or so more.And i think its not going to be much difficult if u just cut the first para and paste it and provide a link to that blog. It will remain permanent till another interesting article pops up. since u visit our blog daily and has got admin rights, u can do it in minutes time since u need to fiddle with the template to post it permanently till next change.   More over Recent posts gives me the list of titles which has happened in a week. But it doesnt give me the content and prompt me to read. Where as what i am talking about is like reading those few lines must prompt every one to read and in the end it should let them leave with a feel of having read something good as i felt in the end, after reading the down posted article. So that was my idea.  That article on sun is again not as expected. Summa summa bhaya muruthaatha. This is also a very old news. Have u heard of elnino few years back. Its much based on such natural calamities on Earth due to celestial changes. and having a solar flare is not new to us too. Get me some thing new original and fresh! And even if i keep blogging, then thats all i too will loose my job one day. But never mind, by that time i would have got another one!  Dear jax, i am not a fairy to grant all the wishes u have. But surely i will put a request to Santa to grant all ur wishes come true this christmas. By the way started anticipating christmas or u too are feeling like Vijay and manny as they felt towards Diwali.......  Source of that BCP article is not known as it came as a forwarded message from srini. So i cant help u out even this time!  Raama, nee engagement kathai solliye thapichittu irukka. Sari parava illai poittu vaa. and snaps 500k kulla anupina download panna vasthiya irukkum. sariya.  sorry vijay that day when i was chatting with u, there was a disconnection and so couldnt proceed further. anyway All the best and happy journey ya.

      The post at "Quod scripsi, scripsi" is not a poem and it is definitely not mine. It is a song titled "Can't fight this feeling any more" by an artist named Reo Speedwagon. The title would have said it all, "The way I feel". This song and another  urlLink song  keep popping up in my mind so often that I start humming them unconsciously.   The link to a story I sent you is again not my story. It was written by   urlLink Humphrey Hawksley . The link was a special preview of the first chapter of his latest book, " urlLink The Third World War ".  BTW, Sujatha is a great writer. I definitely cannot write better than him.   It is true that I haven't sent any stories to you. The truth is most of the stories I have are half written. I lost interest midway or I am thinking of an ending. I'll try to put up my earlier stories online soon.   So the first victim is Vicky. I can't say if I would be able to attend the wedding. But if I do and also Ramgopal turns up, I'll kick him for you.  Ram why don't you put it online in your Yahoo account and send us the link (don't forget to give us permissions) like your thangachi Valli had done earlier. Thangachi irrukkure mulla alluvukku kudda annanukku illa.

      Yeah jax, U r saying right... but it seems u r chasing someone.........  S Rini, its not fair from my part in the friendship focus by abstaining for your marriage that too on a holiday and paying a visit even in a working day, Any way let me wait and see what is going to happen.  But, please do remember I made on time for your engagement (working day). Reg. snaps I will get u the best jpegs in a zip(around a MB) to ur office inbox....  BCP article is good.... plng. to call kicha by noon, let u know later...  one more point for vijay's querry is that, we are matured enough to maintain balance (to some extent) between ordinary day and a festival day...........  Yeah MDGs are really scintillating, but what efforts are taken towards the same.......... I think the time period is also very low compared (just 12 more years for 8) to the goals.  coming to empty space, put something let me comment later (hahahahaha ) sorry too busy to break head......

      I guess you are mentioning the Sideblog when you are talking about "empty space". The "Sideblog" is actually another tiny blog.   To put up gists of posts is time consuming. That's why we have post titles. You can use the post titles to highlight your post, example your earlier post "Behaviour, character and personality" or the one before that "Suggestion for empty space". They really were meaningful. We can use them effectively.   The only detrimental factor is that javascript is used to pull the titles from teh blog posts and put them under the Recent Posts sidebar. So if some one uses &amp; or an apostrophe, it throws up errors and also the post title does not appear in the Recent Posts sidebar. Other than that, I feel that the title serves the best purpose in highlighting the post.  More on the butterfly note, read about the danger of the  urlLink Sun . Also be careful, blogging can get you fired as  urlLink this person  recently came to grief.  Ranjini, Kicha is still feeling sick. He'll be coming to Bangalore only on Sunday. BTW the mail you forwarded to me, I couldn't understand a single word of it. What is the job for and what are the requirements. There were some skill sets required that I have never before heard of. Anyway, I'll try to pass it on.  Were you able to change your email options in Yahoo? You can get me anything from  urlLink this list .  My usual question, where did you get it from? Please mention the source whenever you put up an article. It is always useful in case I need to get background information on the article.  It was quite interesting to read and quite thought provoking too.   The link to Rajini's fan site is to show that art and appreciation of art is universal. But I doubt how many of us would be able to sit through a Japanese film without knowing the language. I don't seem to find a theatre where they show movies by foreign film makers (other than English). I would really love to get my hands on the following movies:     urlLink O Brother, Where art thou?       urlLink Akira Kurosawa 's The Seven Samurai or any of his other movies    urlLink No Man's Land     Anyone able to find a copy of the above movies, kindly get a copy for me.

      Its too heavy for my inbox and will block the entire traffic. u can chunk it to less than 1 mb and send us ya. be it HSS celebs or Pondy trip.   And i welcome one more poet! ya Jax i read ur poem at ur jaxsays blog and found it good! By the way dint u write any stories in recent days and one more thing, the story which u had sent us some time back, i could not read fully. The story which starts at Indian PM's residence. can u resend me again? Is it a thriller? and by the way these days thrillers are not very thrilling with much twists and turns.   Recently i read one sujatha's story. Hope all of us know Ganesh & Vasanth. His prime detective characters. It was a detective story and the story was so dull that in the end there was a billow of disappointment of having read a kothu kathai. Yes, the end of the story was so plain and i wonder how sujatha could write like this and it has got a place in Vikadan's Deepavali malar. That time i felt, even jax would have written better than him! So send me some interesting story which i havent read till date or the story which i have missed.   Though got lots of work, my mood is kharaab and so dont feel like working only.

       Behavior, character and personality  are distinct levels in the evolution of the human being. When people display nice behavior, we say they are presentable. At the next level, when they have character, they can accomplish something. At a further level, being endowed with ‘personality’, they can create something original.  Let us first examine   behavior   . Behavior is superficial and comes through training. It is a channel through which a man expresses himself. The energies for behavior come from the vital emotions, whereas the energies for character come from the mind. The vital energies are short-lived responses to a situation. The ordinary man who is popular with everyone behaves well, has polite manners and does not criticize anyone. He is very presentable in society. But if this is where his growth has stopped, he cannot accomplish anything in the ordinary sense of the word.  When a person has developed   character  , he can accomplish something by himself. Character is organized in the mind. It has a memory and never forgets. When the essence of the vital experience which is behavior is received in the mind and organized well so that the mind accepts that as its central direction, then it becomes character. A man with character fits into that level of society to which his character has risen. If he has a noble character or a weighty character, he may be a philanthropist or a CEO. If he has a character but his nature is small, he can organize and raise a family successfully.   When the mind comes into play, it generally acts on an opinion or bases itself on an idea. It tries to understand and begins to think and organize itself. The vital does not think, it responds to the situation, but the mind listens to an idea. On the basis of this idea, the mind organizes its values. The mind gives its sanction to certain behaviors which it has accepted as right. This behavior then becomes a pattern. The essence of that pattern is based on respectability, on social values. The mental understanding is based on the idea that what is valuable must be respected. Once the mind accepts this, every behavior will be directed by that characteristic. If a mother teachers her child to be polite to his grandfather, the child does not know it should also be polite to his uncle. If the child’s mind, which is capable of understanding, receives the essence of this pattern of politeness towards elder relatives, the pattern becomes continuous and his mind accepts it as a general direction.   A person with a mere behavior can follow instructions, but he cannot think on his own, whereas character comes from the mind and enables the person to carry out a task with self-direction.    What is personality ?  Character is necessary to achieve something in society, but when something has to be created anew, personality is needed. Where character may hesitate to attempt something completely new, personality will not. Personality can accomplish something original, whatever the field is.   Personality is deeper than character. It does not confine itself to an organized expression as character does. Character needs the support of the social and psychological milieu. Because mind is a narrow organism which functions on thought, it draws its values from the general level of thought in the society. Something in the person feels safe in that climate and then the mind understands, the heart is able to be enthused about that understanding and the body is able to work. Usually when mind has to think of something original, it begins to shake. Personality cannot be centered in the mind. It does not care whether anyone else has attempted a certain work before. It has the initiative to start a fresh work in a new field.   Personality does not require the extraneous support of the social sanction. After it has understood and the mind has consented, it has the imagination to give a mental emotion to that consent. Once the mind is able to visualize something in its own imagination, the heart does not hesitate to release its enthusiasm for the accomplishment of the work. The support for the work comes from the Being which is above the mind. If the mind is clear and the Being supports, it doesn’t need the support of the society. That is the difference between character and personality. Character is an efficient mental organism functioning within the social fabric of accomplished levels. Personality is an energy which comes from the Being, able to understand on its own, be enthusiastic on its own and be a trail blazer for the society. Whether the field is in literature, or scientific discovery or in industry or in founding a college, this is the basic difference between character and personality

      Jax that site on Rajini is in Japanese i believe and so its not loading properly and even if it loads also i dont think its possible to understand. Think u might have sent us to make us aware that there are websites of rajini by japanese which is a very old news to me.  And that link on butterfly......... Sari kadi. Yarru adhu ippidi time waste panni ivalavu aaraaichi panraangannu theriyala. But the site on UN Millenium goals is scintillating!  Hei vicky is younger to me atleast by two years manny. and so i felt too early. Hope u guys to have a good time at his marriage. Ennadhu ram is cominga? he dint come for my wedding and now he is going to go for vicky'sa? Ram this is not acceptable. ponaa othai thaan solliten.  by the way ram did u contact kicha? has he come back? how is he now? he hasnt posted even a single blog till date. seems to be so sick.  Hei Jax we can put in that empty space few lines of some interesting blogs. For eg. a gist or some punch lines of the discussion in our blogs. What do other guys say?  coz putting a review or some good articles might demand more space where as this gist or punch lines is more short and sweet. Moreover such good articles can be posted directly on blog itself if its a forwarded one or a link can be established for such things. So lets reserve that space for something interesting .  As an attempt i will post in my next blog an article which grasped me very much by its simplicity in explaining abstract things in such a clear cut manner. And jax u can use the first para of that artcile as the highligh of the article and put it in the empty space which also acts as a gist of what the article is all about! A link to the actual blog will follow at the end of this highlight ........  This is my idea jax and to implement is in ur hands.  Ok others, do tell jax, what else can be put. bye for a moment to cut copy paste the article which i read in next blog

      Dear Friends,  Thankyou very much for your overwhelming welcome and wishes!  Manny has pointed out has rightly that I cannot trouble Jax too much for adding 1 more id. That was a lesson for me. I am happy to announce Manny @ this moment that I had successfuly closed the id vsriprasath_chat@yahoo.com to avoid any more future problems. So no troubles, no worries! Manny!  I saw Boys 3 times due to technical features involved in that film. I admire Shankar's ideas, thoughts and his love towards film career. Shankar struggled in the tamil film industry for 11 years, Vickram 14 years, A.R.Rahman 7 years to get a break through!  Don't think I am advocating these people.  These are generic lessons we should learn. The best way to reach people is media, films, TV ads.   Ok no boring again!  You may face tougher time with ur Superiors/Boss. I have Translation Software for you people.  Suppose your Superior/Boss says "I totally agree with you"  means " I totally disagree with you"  "You are Right! But... " means "Even if you agree! I don't care"  "I didn't have time to go through your mail and I can't understand what u said"  means  "I don't  know to access the e-mail software"  "We have an opportunity"  means "You have a problem"  "Convince your client for this deal" means "Hell with your Client"  Ok guys and gals!  Meet u again!  Sri Prasath Venkateswaran

      Hi,  Greetings to ALL!  Since a long time I was quarelling with Xavi, to reserve a berth in this group. I though it will be RAC, but finally I got a berth for travelling in this train. I thank all who responded to my mail.  Technological Challenge, it is the phrase which frightens u and me day to day.  I read an article in which how top tech companies invent technology and how people experiment the same! Here are some samples.  Compaq is considering changing the command "Press Any Key" to "Press Return Key" because of the flood calls asking where the "Any" key is.  A Dell technician advised a customer to put his troubled floppy back in the drive and close the door. The customer asked the tech to hold on, and was heard putting the phone down, getting up and crossing the room to close the door to his room  A customer was asked to send a copy of his defective diskettes. A few days later, a letter arrived from the customer along with the photocopies of the floppies.  Hope u enjoyed!  till then! Bye!  Sri Prasath Venkateswaran

Coming to ur question, I have the answer, but I am not sure to what extent the same will convince you... Gud man, u purchased a week b4, I purchased a day b4 that too only a shirt for formality... Yeah I watched most of the debate,  "Just we have come to know that these are yet another day which acts as a family get together, but in childhood these days are time to relish away from study, no pressure from teachers / parents the whole day, moreover new dresses only during festivals / functions... but now.. we can get dress rt. now also if needed.. those days need is not the criteria but function is the criteria, nowdays viceversa"  Kavi, since strugling with gr8 responsibility and placing little effort I couldnt find time to post, although I read often.. moreover there is no matter to be posted.  Manny yet to read your links.. will come to both discussion (Marriage & Religion later).... enna da.. pillion seat free ah??? irukooo??? hmmm irukatuumm...  Valli, Sindhu, how about ur diwali celebs...  Rini, how was urs...  During my stay at native, talked to Ganesh, Rajesh, Rohini, Sindhu, JK, Shoba...  all conveyed their wishes to all...  Cheers

      Hi All,           Hope everyone enjoyed this hols..What happened to kicha? Not feeling well. Today morning just I was wondering why there is no Good Morning mail from kicha. I came to chennai sunday afternoon itself..'coz I forgot to book the return ticket and in last moment I didn't get any tickets in bus or train.So I preferred Day journey. It was too boring on sunday evening..I was alone in home. Then just started with all the housekeeping work pending. My roomi came in the evening..Then we went out for shopping..had dinner outside.          Valli..How is your job going? I didn't see any blogs about your experience..I might have missed that also..I am not sure.           Expecting all your blogs soon...

      hi all,  hope everyone enjoyed deepavali very much. thalai deepavali, rendam deepavali, irupathi munam deepavali, irupathi nazham deepavli, irupathi anjam deepavali,... yellam eppadi irunthathu.  regarding myself, i enjoyed a lot. but comparing to deepavalies which came during my school/college days, i havnt enjoyed that much. y it so? i asked myself. during that days i start counting days for deepavali well before 2 months. like the world cup starting day counting in ESPN/Star, i used to start counting like 70 days to go, 55 days to go, next month this day it is deepavali, only two weeks to go,.... like that  i used to start purchase dresses one month before the deepavali. usually in our town all the dress shops start deepavali sales exactly one month before the deepavali. only that time they start advertising. but in my house we buy dresses before that. but for this deepavali i only bought dresses 2 weeks before, and also i bought it in 2 days.  why it so? i lost something? i m searching reasons for that? if anyone hav similar sort of feeling then pls tell me if u find reasons. i ll blog once i found the reasons.  btw, has anyone watched patti mandram in Sun TV on deepavali day? it is related to what i said above. i ll blog all these things soon.

      This year Diwali seems to be quieter than usual. Maybe the ban on the decibel level ratios is responsible or have people woken up to the fact that their hard earned money is going up in smoke.  Those who didn't read today's newspaper. Surely,  urlLink here  is a good reason to get married soon guys.  Read a description of avial and sambar, as described in the New York Times.  One of her classics is avial, a ragout of vegetables, in which she uses matchstick-size pieces of carrot, cucumber, green beans, drumstick (long, ridged pods from the moringa oleifera tree, rich in vitamin C, with a delicate flavor resembling that of asparagus), kovakka or little melon (a kind of gherkin) and brinjal, a longish eggplant.  First she boils the vegetables with green chilies. Then she adds a mixture with the texture of oatmeal, including turmeric, coconut, garlic and cumin, along with home-made cow's-milk curd and kari leaves (highly aromatic and widely used in Kerala, these are often confusingly called curry leaves in the West; they look like basil leaves and taste of citrus and bell peppers).  Sambar, a lentil and vegetable stew, makes use of two unusual spices. Asafetida, a resin taken from the rhizomes of giant fennel, is admired in Kerala for its earthy scent when fried in oil, and fenugreek seeds are liked for their bitter caramel flavor. Together with tamarind, a souring agent, chilies and coriander leaves, they give the stew intricate layers of flavor.  Interesting to read the different names that the foreigners give to Indian dishes, trying to findsimilarities between thier food and ours. Try figuring out what  sourdough crepes  are?  Anyway, Have a wonderful Diwali, guys and gals, at home or not?

      Interesting to read the essays that Manny had posted.  here are my views:  Mankind has always been fascinated by religion. As someone said,  it is the opium of the mind .  A short look at the number of  urlLink religions in the world   will baffle the mind. So many religions, so many views...  Add to this mixture, a large heapful of  urlLink mythologies , you get a totally confusing volatile potion.   But after understanding many mythologies, it is possible to point out several similarities between the mythologies, be it a greek, egyptian or matabele. So all I can understand is that there has been a common origin for the beliefs. The question is where?  Africa  (as scientists say),  Ancient Persia  (according to Judeo, Christian, Islamic and Hindu myths),  Mediterranean  (Greek, Egyptian, Atlantis). That's one question for which no one has been able to give a correct answer.  But as George Bernard Shaw said, "  There is only one religion, though there are a hundred versions of it.  "

      Dear mates,  My wishes for a happy diwali... On the eve of this festival, I came across an article abt Hinduism... Worth knowing the whats of our great religion and makes me feel something good about my identity... if u have time have a look at this  urlLink link   Also, a bit of news that i found was as follows...  "Some liberal religious historians have raised the possibility that stories of Jesus' birth, ministry, execution, and resurrection were copied, at least in part, from Krishna's life."  To see what they say in its entirety abt this issue have a look at this  urlLink link   Ur views are welcome...  Regards, Mahen

       The flight to India     The jobs Britain stole from the Asian subcontinent 200 years ago are now being returned.   by George Monbiot   Britain's industrialisation was secured by destroying the manufacturing capacity of India. In 1699, the British government banned the import of woollen cloth from Ireland, and in 1700 the import of cotton cloth (or calico) from India. Both products were forbidden because they were superior to our own.  Now the jobs we stole 200 years ago are returning to India.   Read  urlLink full-story

I'll be starting home on thursday night for diwali...  and at work.. am doing some programming with.. guess what... COBOL and CICS... Yep..!! some mainframe stuff... no... not moved from my good old .NET ... but this is an initiative to integrate mainframes with microsoft technologies.. and I'm starting with the mainframe part of it and have to look at ways of integrating it with .NET so that we could get a real-time processing (rather than batch processing) with mainframe in the picture..  And yet to see views about that topic... I too am thinking on it...

Boomi's friends are coming down to our home for Diwali...so hoping to have nice time...  I never imagined that Bulb will be such a big kozhi, at the same time prooving that she is a Diana as well! Kicha, we are not certain of how long we'll have to stay...as u said one yr is over...and our visa is getting expired by jan 2004....probably v'll get it extended for another 6 months or so... gud topic for discussion...will pour in my thoughts later!

      jax, feel free to use anything... and about the chat in blog... how personal is a "personal" chat... am sure there was nothing "personal" in that chat, that I have "revealed" to the world... its more a sharing of "something funny" that went on between two people...  I intend to propose a topic for discussion... this was going on since morning in our BB.. so just felt like knowing what all of us have in mind too...  This is was the post in our BB which started it all...  Here goes... Drop in your views if u find the topic interesting...   Hey dear guys and gals …..    This is not a silly question. It’s very tough to answer. Easy it may seem, but given a second thought it could raise a big debate. What according to you is the right age to marry? Is it in the early twenties, when you are full of the so called “josh” or should it be in the late twenties, when u have gained experience of how to handle life. Whatever you may feel right, may feel absolutely wrong for another. Doesn’t matter though, coz it’s always free to express your opinions.    Now the importance of the topic – Why should it be a concerned issue?  If you must have read last Sunday’s supplements of Times Of India, you will agree that yeah… people do choose career prior to family. And when their career is all glory, they turn to family. But then its too late. Either there aren’t too many books on the shelf, or you may havta pick what you get, not what you want.  On the other hand, we also see cases where kiddos fall in love and marry right after college. They don’t realize the responsibilities and duties involved in a married life, and often end up in disasters.  Many a time, the not so forward Indian parents come in between, and they set a deadline, which could be as late as 30 or could be as early as 20. Now again, the average Indian youth, doesn’t have the guts or doesn’t feel it proper to stand up for their choices especially, when they are against the parents. Some may call this discipline, some may call it orthodox, some may call it obedience, some may call it fear.  Tis not easy to bring a trend among a social culture. And very often, the beginners of the trend are often branded as the maggot in the apple.   Open your views, and let’s see what the Bulletin Board has in mind. Keep the ball rolling

      Bon Jour,  Kicha, that was really an interesting chat transcript. Since when have you taken over Rajesh as a chief Kozhi catcher, Kicha?  But is it ethical? is a question that I would want to ask everyone. I know there was no illwill meant. But what if two persons are having a personal chat and one of them puts the chat transcript online? Just my thoughts...  Kicha, my comments on what you sent:   Wonderful  . Can I use a part of it (especially the 2nd and last paras) in any of my stories. I'll give the proper credits for it. Can I? Those who didn't know what I am saying. You'll know soon.  It has been a long time since we had a long discussion on the blog. Anyone giving out topics, please let us avoid rehashing old topics once more. Let us discuss some new things this time.   As for movie reviews, I watched " urlLink LOTR-TTW " on  urlLink DVD  a couple of days back. It is amazing to see how a movie becomes more interesting when you watch it on a DVD. I was unlucky to miss it on the silver screen. Waiting for the next installment to be released in December.  As for books, I am currently reading " urlLink  The Sons of Fortune  " by Jeffrey Archer. Those who have read Archer before might understand this story would contain, the twists and turns etc. which reminds me. Hey Sindhu, where are my books. Does Vinod have them?   If you have not yet read any of Archer's books, start with " urlLink  Not a penny more, not a penny less  ". You'll love it.  I am still trying to get my hands on " urlLink  The Avenger  " by Fredrick Forysth. The librarian has asked me to collect it tomorrow. So I have to complete reading "The Sons of Fortune" by tonight.  Other than that, I'm waiting for my project to be completed by today.

      Hey Kicha,  had a nice time laughing......So finally did she understand that you were playing the fool around, or is she still expecting ur arrival on 22nd????  Happened to watch two wonderful movies last week......one was "Mrs & Mr Iyer".......An Indian movie.....The hero's nativity is said as Bengal, & the heroin's  is from TamilNadu....So they communicate in English, with tit bits of tamil & hindi inbetween.....& for our convinience, we get close captions when the dialouge is in Hindi or Tamil.....The whole movie is about a journey, from the deep south to Calcutta.......It was simply wonderful.....  The other movie was "Bend it like Beckham"......an Indian(Punjabi) family in London tries to raise their soccer-playing daughter in a traditional way.......Her dream is to play soccer professionally like her hero David Beckham.......Does her parents allow her to chase her dream or ties her with family values and stuffs??....This is the whole stroy about...The director is Gurinder Chadha(who's given one another hit..."Bhaji on the beach")...This movie was a sleeper hit in England.....a late pick up....but recieved an overwhelming response.....Now, picking up speed in America too......Don't ever miss a chance to watch these wonderful movies......  Kicha, so at what time u'll be at my home?....this week end we are celebrating Diwali, right????........

      Hey Rini,  I'm feeling so sick Rini...I wanna get chudi or saree for me too......But, poor me,  I've just got a pair of Van Huesen  Trousers and shirts. However i still have one unused silk saree....new in box....Persian blue (If I'm right).......  We have two functions here, conducted by the Indian community......we'll be going there.....we have planned to go to a temple, with our friends.....we don't have a temple, in Lexington......need to travel to a nearby place....one and a half hr travel....90 miles.....We have also planned to make some sweets, one dish per family(Kinda Potleg)......will sure be speaking with our parents & bro's.....  But inspite of all these, I feel, i'm missing something terribly.....the festive mood, the sound of crackers, flooded readymade showrooms, busy bakeries, my quest for chudis 'n sarees.....everything......  But this is far far more better than last year's Diwali......It was a friday......Ganesh went to office asusual......I hardly knew one family here....who were also far away from our place.....I was not that confident about my cooking experinces....So I did'nt try out anything new or different......I was afraid of deep frying also at that time(I had this problem for a long time....I've witnessed two deep frying accidents....one to my mom & the other one, to one of my aunts.Though now I'm very comfortable)......I was crying the whole day, so depressed.....nobody around me....Finally, i was okay in the evening, when i got dressed up, in my new silk saree & Ganesh took me to that one place whom we knew.....  This year, Bless me, we have so many friends around us.....we have plans to celebrate it together.....Hope we'll have a great time together......

      Dear Kicha, Good to have you back. I've been troubled by a project for the past two weeks. Not much work for me literally. All I have to do is co-ordinate the proceed and it driving me nuts. I hope I can get the project completed by the next two days.   BTW, Sindhu, if you could visit Birmingham again sometime between the 22 nd  and 29 th  of this month, visit the ITMA fair. There if you can locate the pavilion of Lakshmi Card Clothing there, spend some time to take a look at a video presentation going on at their stall and then tell me how it was. Was my work for the past two weeks worth it? Can you tell me?  Planning to work again?  Somehow, I managed to install Windows XP, Windows Me, and Windows Server 2003 (in that order) on my machine. My Visual Studio .NET installation went fine, except that I need to activate my software through the net and I don't have a net connection at home. I'm still wondering what to do. Damn Microsoft and their stupid activation scheme. I realize I have to find a way to crack that stupid activation hurdle. Anybody willing to render their services?

      Hi,  Hope everyone had a gud wkend.... Great to hear from Kavi after a long time.....yes kavi as u said it's very difficult to manage ur worklife and family in one-go.....but a lot depends on ur life partner! Xavier...i read the piece of story in the link.... it was well-written, narrative and simple in language.... Most importantly I was able to visualise things....it has a great take-off....but the momentum can be fine-tuned a bit...a few sentences can be rephrased....like... "The soldiers seperated...." other than these it was really great to read....kept me intact until the end...  this weekend we went to Birmingham along with one of Boomi's friend....a new shopping complex was opened recently called 'Bull Ring'....had the usual set of shops that we find all over UK.....everything under a single roof.....it was so much crowdy like T.Nagar Ranganathan street....but the interesting part was a  shop called ' selfridges'...it has everything and anything u need for a house...clothes, books, music Cd's, bags, cosmetics, decorative items, electronic goods,entertainment and what not....it even had a restaurant....English, Chineses, Itlalian.......just amazing but a bit messy as well! Watched ' Bad Boys II ' in a nearby cinema complex...horrible movie...it was dragging on, on and on.... oops...i forgot to tell one more thing.....I have resigned my job....right now i'm under notice period...so will work until the end of this month!....looking forward to staying at home for some time before my next assignment!...Boomi is just waiting for the d-day.....so that nan oru nalavadu Boomi ya torture pannama thaniya samaikarthukku.....

You've got good friends, And we're ALL getting older "....inba then vandhu paayudhu kaadhinilae.......  B'day went, as normal as any other day...with tit bits of celebs, then 'n there.....like, getting phone calls from parents & brothers, to bless me......Ganesh surprising me with a very very big mickey mouse (if i make it stand, it's 3/4th of me) I loved it so much (by the way, collecting  plush toys is my hobby)....getting so many e-cards from all our friends.....other than these, the day was the same.....infact, more crucial....morning, at work, one silly stupid bug, was irritating me for more than an hr....& i had'nt prepared for my test for the afternoon class.....I was "Mulichifying" like our class boys do, whenever we used to have test there at DES.....thank god it was cancelled.....  Kicha, did'nt you celebrate, your anniversery with Infy???......We need a treat man.......

         You can insert a single quote using the escape sequences. See the list  urlLink here.    Yes, you can change your posts after it has been published. There is an link called "edit" next to the post details in Blogger. You can click on it to load the post and then edit it as you like.   Your admin rights allow you to change the posts of others if you want to.    BTW the past week, I am receiving a  CD  everyday. It started with a  urlLink Windows 2003 Server  evaluation copy. A few days later, a copy of  MS   urlLink Speech Server   SDK  and a  DVD  of  urlLink Visual Studio.net 2003 . Yesterday, a copy of  urlLink Sun's latest desktop , codename "Mad Hatter", arrived. And today, a copy of  urlLink Bullfighter , a software application. The coming week is surely going to be very busy with these things.  I have also updated " urlLink Quod scripsi, scripsi " after a month's gap. If you wish, you can leave your comments on that blog.

                    Hi,How are you All..the members the blog family? I was a little bit busy so I coudn't blog, Really I am feeling like living in  island. No contact with anyone for atleast 1 or 2 months. Few calls from friends now and then keep me updated about you all. Then yesterday I spoke to vijay and he sent me all the blogs and archives...From 8.40AM I am enjoying reading all your blogs.                   When I saw sam's mail in yahoogroups..Really I shocked to get to know that kannan sir is no longer with us. It's really so sad..Then hope valli and sindhu are very busy with their work.Hey.. you know I took a flat near Besant Nagar with my friends(I don't remember whether I already updated you about this) and moved there last week. We started cooking. our Dishes are good compared to our hostel food....But yet to buy books to learn varieties. I hope valli ,rini and sindhu(Should I say in this order ganesh,srini and boomi) can help me to learn cooking. We 3 are staying together...Really I am enjoying being in home after 9 years of my hostel life.                  Valli..How is your work going? Which platform you are working now..? Gals......I really would like to know how you are balancing between your personal life and work. I had my product delivery on last week. Till last week..work is too tight for me. oct 2nd and all..I left the office at night 4.30AM(I should say 3rd morning). I couldn't find time to sleep all these last 3 to 4 weeks. Just I was thinking about rini,sindhu and valli. But in my case 'coz of some problems we went for redesign of the product and the time duration was too short..so it was like that. But really I would like to discuss '"Working women (that too married and got childrens) have time to live their life?".                  Ram, Bala told that you planned to go to cbe also..So I called bala on saturday to talk toy ou all. But he said..no they haven't come. seems all had a Great Break!!Jax...I like the present blog color which you are using for the page and title. Time is 10AM..I am going to start my work. 1.30 hrs passed by reading and typing blog and attending conf call. Have a Great Day!!    Cheers....... Kavitha.N

      Many more happy returns of the day valli! How was ur celebration? Mail us all with a big story as it follows.  Really great time i had u know. All his friends are nothing but a cloud of humour, care, smile, laughter, fun, friendliness, love, concern wrapped together to show me the rainbow of life!  Oh my! how i envied and also enjoyed being with them. Appaaaaaa, naan theriyaama savaal vituten, that i will cook for those guys when i am at chennai and they dint leave me till i cooked for all of them though i said  -n-  no. of saaljaapu. Atlast, they made me cook Veg. biryani & Curdrice. Paavam, those guys u know, they had to eat the Biryani which was almost like pongal. Ya i had kept more water and so adhu kolanji pochu. but then taste wise it was good it seems. Curd rice was really superb. In the end, with the threat that i will cook for the next time, every body submitted their results that my cooking was good! Thats Ranjini!! The thing is i cooked for 12 of them at a time. I could not believe that i cooked for so many at a time that too all alone. Ofcourse everybody helped me by cutting vegetables, cleaning rice, opening the grocery packs, cleaning utensils, operating mixie. Ore kalebaram thaan. Kadavule, Water mattum naan correct proportionla vachirundha, today i would have come out with good name & fame ! No probs, i will try sometime later too.   Really it has now given me a confidence that i can cook for -n- no. of people with out any fuss. woweeeeeeeeeee i can manage situations like this in future tooooooooooo.  Hmmmmmmm regarding our visits, we had a great time at Mayajaal, hope u know its a multiplexer and has got bowling alley. U know what, i did bowling for the first time. And the most funny part was, i was the only one who dint know bowling and literally every buddy of his taught me how to bowl. Ya, they were almost praying for me to hit atleast one pin when i was enjoying a full pack strike by them. Good they play u know, including srini. Everytime i bowl, it goes in the side lane and one time u know what happened, as i was swinging the ball front and back, before i could release, it slipped from my fingers and rolled back and almost hit srini. Poor he! then what, every body were flying away from the place, if i was bowling. It was really fun to see a guy hiding behind his friends as i had told that my next target was to hit him.   Ah, atlast, i too could shake some 8 pins in one stroke. Oh, how good they were u know, trying hard to make me hit atlest once. Obviously, had i enjoyed something @ mayajaal then it was due to their friendly move to make me not feel despaired as i couldnt hit and was struggling to hit.   With such an exhibit of concern and fun we left from Mayajaal to Muttukaad to enjoy a classic evening while surfing the backwaters in a rowboat. The whole water was almost bathing in moonlight when we reached muttukaad. Really speaking i was the only one who desparately wanted to go to Muttukad and so coz of me, all the other 12 came with us. Ofcourse worth was our visit, though it was getting dark. Everybody were happy with a new kind of boating experience. U know i struggled hard to row and all others in the boat panicked with the fear that i might drop the oar any time in water. But then they took even this risk for their new guest(its me)!  Then atlast that day i left them free as i was feeling tired and said will go back home.   The next day we started towards Besant nagar beach. The climate was so cool even at 9 o clock and oh my! the beach was clean u know. Not much of Garbage. Good it was to trod on those golden sand and get wet in white waters. All his friends played volleyball and i had a nice time watching them play. Ofcourse we both had a pleasant short walk along the waters to make our morning come live!  In the evening we went for shopping to a Casual wear shop and came out with baggages of shirts and pant for srini. Poor me, i dint buy any as i dint get any of my size and dint like too.  The next day was the day of testing! Yes i tested almost all the members out there with my cooking extravaganza. When everybody were tired we slipped to one of his close friends house to be given a warm welcome to their place. As hari happens to be one of srini's best friend they had a nice time plunging themselves in nostalgia about the heydays they had spent together and also they were discussing on how to bring those days back now! Good move!  With a warm heart we all started our move towards Spencer plaza as i hadnt seen even once. My god, its big man. Hmmmmmmmmmm bigger than all shopping malls in Bangalore. Very spacious were every shops and fully A/ced. Good shopping experience for me. I had a good time, getting into Landmark, one of the biggest book store i believe. We bought a Casette on Madukya Upanishad by Pandit Jasraj. Its a classic! We searched for it in Bangalore, but dint find any and finally caught it at Chennai.  Then we stepped into every garment shop there like Provogue, Blackberys, CP and bought one shirt for Srini at Provogue for Diwali. I liked it. His friends toh, appaaaa, teasing him like anything, coz when ever he enters into trial room, they will ask if i like it or not and when he comes out, he straightly searches for me amidst them and asks my opinion first and then goes to his friends while i was feeling shy to tell my comments infront of them and blushing a bit. Ofcourse, before trying he gets suggestion of Hari, who has got a taste similar to Srini and is more particular in getting the best for srini than me. Nice to see such friends ya!  Finished our shopping spree with a chocolate icecream and mini samosas.  Went home and started packing for our trip to Pondichery. Arey, u should see that East Coast Road from Chn to Pnd, my god, just beautiful and to value add it, the climate became so soothing and cool. So good was the weather and our travel that we never felt the distance covered.  We had a graceful darshan of Mother and Sri Auribindo and got their blessings from their Samadhi. From there we went to the Auroville a city in the making, where people from almost 30 nations are trying to realise the ideals of Mother and Sri Aurobindo. Its fully covered by nature, beautiful was the surrounding and they insist on silence which is really worth in such a divine atmosphere. Oh, it was really surprising to see that almost every soul was dipped in silence when we reached the MAtri Mandir, which is the soul of the city!  With blessings and grace, we left the city and started towards bangalore with a comfort feeling of having spent our days merrily and peacefully.

        Should Microsoft Be Liable for Bugs in Its Products?    Should Microsoft be held financially liable for the vulnerabilities in Windows and its other products?   Granted, this year hasn't been good, security-wise, for Microsoft: This summer's SoBig.F virus and MSBlaster worm interrupted businesses and individuals worldwide, albeit without any loss of data, and recent vulnerabilities in Microsoft Internet Explorer (IE) facilitated the deadly new QHost attack, which runs malicious code on users' computers when they navigate to unsafe Web sites. But Microsoft, like other software makers, has historically relied on an End User License Agreement (EULA) to protect itself from customers seeking restitution for the allegedly shoddy quality of its products.    Is the EULA legally enforceable? Can Microsoft be held liable for problems, including financial losses, its customers accrue from using its software?   Post your views...

      Dear Ram,  Here is an article that I wrote for my company's internal newsletter last week.   What is a news aggregator?  A news aggregator is "software that periodically reads a set of news sources, in one of several XML-based formats, finds the new bits, and displays them in reverse-chronological order on a single page."  A few months back, we had seen about weblogs. Aggregators and weblog software are two sides of the same coin. Weblogs are for writing, while aggregators are for reading.   How does it work?  Every hour the aggregator reads the "feeds" or "sources" you're subscribed to, as few as a half-dozen, or as many as you like. The information is displayed it in a user-friendly format, one for each source.   How do I get to read news?  A computer, running an aggregator software, reads information from various sources. There are a wide range of sources, news websites, weblogs and even commercial sites.  A search on google for "news aggregators" lists a range of software for reading news. There are news aggregator software for various operating systems.  Recently Indian Express and Financial Express (the first from any Indian news website) have put up a "feed" containing the headlines, a brief description and links back to the full story available on their websites.  Mostly all the "feed" available on the Internet are free. The news aggregator is an example of how technology can be used as an informative medium.  Hope you understood it. More on this tomorrow or the day after.

      Hi all, Glad abt blogging after a long gap... BTW...Many more happy returns of the day valli... Jax here is the reason why we are not able to name folders and files with certain reserved words...  Illegal file/folder names and conventions for the Windows Operating systems...  The following file/folder names are reserved under Windows: com1, com2, com3, com4, com5, com6, com7, com8, com9, lpt1, lpt2, lpt3, lpt4, lpt5, lpt6, lpt7, lpt8, lpt9, con, nul, and prn.  You cannot use these names for naming your folders and files.  There are lot more reservations for naming files/folders in Windows.   ok then..bye bye and meet u all in my next blog.

      So after several days, Rini has gone and reviewed the other blog and suggested improvements. Thank you. As for the book review, I have everything ready. The only thing to be done is integrating it with the blog. Due to some very tight work schedule, I was unable to put it up. Maybe the coming holidays might allow that.  Have a happy hols everyone.

      By the way jax, the plum style seems to be good! Apart from that Sea, Guava are also good. Others not so appealing to me. In Dayswork blog, black is the best and all others are not that appealing. Coz they are all of the same background with only the color changes. But jaxsays blog has different layouts too which are appealing too. Can move plum, sea& guava too to dayswork if u and give off all those similar purple, mint, peach color styles.  And those are all DOs commands i believe. PRN is for printing onto Parallel printer port and COM are for writing on to Communication ports i believe. So it might be like keywords of OS and so will not allow us to create folders of that name. Dont know exactly but! hope to see the correct answer soon.

      Oh, really i am unable to believe till now. Its a sad ending for one of the adored faculty of our course. May his soul rest in peace.  Ok guys, have a nice and long & happppppy weekend. Me too am going to have a fine weekend. will tell all fun when i am back. and yesterday too i bunked my office as i dint feel like going. so to impress srini, i plunged still into the zone of cooking. Prepared some sweets and one special item, i mean Kolukattai to eat for dinner and not usual rice. He envied the way i was enjoying my leave. And dint feel like coming to office today. But then veetla irundha bore adikkumnu kelambi vandhutten.  Hei guys, i have got a suggestion pa. Why not we write some reviews? Ya the way i have reviewed the casette Panchabhutam, why not people who read books like jax, kicha, ram, sindhu, valli and almost all i think read something or the other and keep in touch with the literary world. So it would be nice if we start posting some reviews. Need not exactly be on books, can be on Museums or exhibitions or casettes or any thing worth reviewing. Thats what i can say now.  Gadsby good lipogram work!  Ok then guys will meet u all after holidays............. bye for now

      You cannot name folders as such because they are name of devices used by the Windows File system. More info  urlLink here . But MS says that WinNT and Win2K do not face this problem. Don't know if it is caused by Fat File System. Maybe it does not occur in a NTFS file system.   Maybe Manny can help in this issue.

      Try this...  You cannot create a folder with the same name as any of the following: CON, PRN, LPT1, LPT2 ... LPT9, COM1, COM2 ... COM9  Can you tell me why...?  PS: It holds true for Win 2000/XP/2003 ... I have not tested on other OS's...

      There are more such works in several languages which leave out a particular letter. As you said " urlLink Gadsby " is one in English.   urlLink Perec 's "La disparition" in French (available as "A Void" in English) also leaves out "e".  I started reading Gadsby a couple of weeks ago, but never got around finishing it. BTW, any such works in Tamil?

      Hi all, I found this interesting story. Anyone care to tell me its uniqueness. "Warm weather, Walter! Welcome warm weather! We were wishing winter would wane, weren't we?"   "We were well wearied with waiting," whispered Waiter wearily. Wan, white, woe-begone was Walter; wayward, willful, worn with weakness, wasted, waxing weaker whenever winter's wild, withering winds were wailing. Wholly without waywardness was Winifred, Walter's wise, womanly watcher, who, with winsome, wooing way, was well-beloved.   "We won't wait, Walter; while weather's warm we'll wander where woodlands wave, won't we?"   Walter's wanton wretchedness wholly waned. "Why, Winnie, we'll walk where we went when we were with Willie; we'll weave wildflower wreaths, watch woodmen working; woodlice, worms wriggling; windmills whirling; watermills wheeling; we will win wild whortleberries, witness wheat winnowed."   Wisbeach woods were wild with wildflowers; warm, westerly winds whispered where willows were waving; wood-pigeons, wrens, woodpeckers were warbling wild woodnotes. Where Wisbeach water-mill's waters, which were wholly waveless, widened, were waterlilies, waxen white. Winifred wove wreaths with woodbine, whitehorn, wallflowers; whilst Walter whittled wooden wedges with willow wands.   Wholly without warning, wild wet winds woke within Wisbeach woods, whistling where Winifred wandered with Walter; weeping willows were wailing weirdly; waging war with wind-tossed waters. Winifred's wary watchfulness waked.   "Walter, we won't wait."   "Which way, Winnie?"   Winifred wavered. "Why, where were we wandering? Wisbeach woods widen whichever way we walk. Where's Wisbeach white wicket, where's Winston's water-mill?"   WistfuIly, Walter witnessed Winifred's wonder. "Winnie, Winnie, we were wrong, wholly wrong; wandering within wild ways. Wayfaring weather-beaten waifs, well-nigh worn-out."   Winifred waited where, within wattled woodwork walls, wagons, wheelbarrows, wains were waiting, weighty with withered wood. Walter, warmly wrapped with Winifred's well-worn wadded waterproof, was wailing woefully, wholly wearied. Winnie, who, worn with watching, well-nigh weeping, was wistfully, wakefully waiting Willie's well-known whistle, wholly wished Walter's well-being warranted.   With well-timed wisdom, Walter was wound with wide, worsted wrappers, which wonderfully well withstood winter's withering, whistling winds. Wholly without warm wrappers was Winifred, who, with womanly wisdom, was watching Walter's welfare, warding Walter's weakness.   "When will Willie wend where we wait?" wearily wondered Walter.   "Whist, Walter," whispered Winnie, "who was whooping?"   "Whereabouts?"   Welcome whistling was waking Wisbeach woods when winter's windy warfare waxed weaker.   "Winnie! Walter!"   Winifred's wakefulness was well-grounded. "We're well, Willie; we're where Winston's wagons wait."  Without waiting, Willie was within Winston's woodwork walls.   "Welcome, welcome, Willie." Winnie was weeping with weariness with watching Walter, weak with wayfaring.   "Why Winnie! Wise, watchful, warm-hearted Winnie," Willie whispered wheedlingly. "We won't weep; Walter's well. What was Walter without Winnie?"   Wholly wonderful was Winifred's well-timed womanly wisdom, which well warranted weakly Walter's welfare. Whenever wandering within Wisbeach woods with Winnie, Walter would whisper, "What was Walter without Winnie? Wise, watchful, warm-hearted Winnie!" Good Luck!!

      The art of questioning has become a lost art today. We are being taught not to ask questions. It begins from childhood. a young child begins to understand its environment. It's mind is filled with curiosities about its surroundings. What it learns forms how it will act in the future. The child is told by its parents that this is good and this is bad. It accepts that as realities. It also learns a lot from its own experinces like hunger can make you cry and falling down hurts.  It grows older. Our young lad/lass goes to school. Its mind is filled with premonitions about the school and the teachers there. S/he takes time to adjust to the new environment. S/he learns that there are a lot of children like her. S/he likes some and dislikes some. It cannot understand why.  Soon a couple of years pass. S/he is now five years old, learning quite a lot of things in school and home. The mind is now more inquisitive now. Lots of questions arise in thier minds, but no one can answer them. Parents and teachers now unable to cope up with the flurry of questions adopt a new approach. They tell the child that it is wrong to question everything. They tell that the child will understand why some things are the way they are when they grow up. The child accepts this. It knows that if it asks questions, they may not be answered or worse, it might be admonished.   Our lad/lass is now entering its pre-teen years. It understands that questioning things might lead into trouble and that it is better to accept or keep quiet. Inwardly looking, the child is like a pot, brimming and boiling with questions. But poor soul, what can it do? It accepts what it has been told or comes to its own conclusions.   Teen years - the wonder years. The child is now aware of many things. It is now becoming increasingly aware of changes, both physically and mentally. It is still hard to find answers and questioning at this age is dangerous. Unable to find answers from the people it has known for years, it turns to other avenues for information. Some turn out wonderful guides and some turn out rotten.  The teen years end, moving through college, work, marriage and finally, even at the deathbed, the child ponders on the questions left unanswered.   The child could be you...  Like I said, the art of questioning is lost, buried under fear, prejudices and pure stupidity. And people who question are treated as if they are some rebels. Kicha had pointed out instances where questioning led to eminence and improvement of society. Yet it has been drummed into our minds that questioning is wrong. It means you are not trusting what people say; It means that you do not respect your elders; it means that you are not grown up. I could go on with a similar list.   I remember an anectode I read. An outgoing teacher tells his new young replacement the following words. "In every class, you might find that there is someone who is eager to question your every statement. Your first impulse would be silence him. But before that, consider this. He might be the only person who is listening to your words." Interesting, if only teachers listened to this advice.  This does not mean that nor do I endorse that you should question everything. I say that if you don't know something or don't understand something, question. And never let go till you find out the answer. And that requires courage and tenacity.  A Norse proverb says, "It's better to ask twice than to lose your way once."

      Hi, as always it is nice to see everyone sharing their thoughts and views on various topics.   One small note on posting:    Avoid using font and marquee tags.   Instead of b, use strong, and em instead of i.   When you are including quotations, use the blockquote tag, instead of using align=center.   Whenever possible, give your post a title and avoid the apostrophe sign    Hope no one is inconvenienced by these suggestion, these are to improve your HTML skills and also have a semantic blog. If you want to know more on semantic, try googling.  I'll post my views on the last few posts later.

      Hai all,   A couple of days before, Bala was emphasizing that technology has made human being lethargic in all ways and means. I do agree that technology had made human inhuman, lethargic in some ways. But not in all. You might be wondering that why myself is speaking something without any correlation with the heading I posted?. There is relationship.  Today, I participated in urlLink Coimbatore IT.com(Achieving India's IT Vision 2008).  Among the speakers were Mr.VivekhariNarain(IT Secretrary,Govt of TN), Mr.Subramaniam(President & CEO, Covansys), Mr.Ravichandran(Sr.VP,olaris lab) etc.,  In the seminar, a lot of topics were delivered on BPO, Bioinformatics and Achieving Vision 2008 etc. But, the interesting part of the session was e-governance by Dr.Karthikeyan,(Commissioner,Coimbatore Corporation). His explanation, eye for details about e-governance is simply astonishing. He explained us elaborately about e-governance, How coimbatore corporation is doing reforms and carrying out infrastructural and corporation activities. How general public can pay taxes through payment gateways by means of their  urlLink Coimbatore Corporation  website.  He also showed a live demo how the general public feel about this modern way of using paying taxes through their website. You know what was the reply from an 60 year old citizen?(Middle class Indian). He said it is very amazing, he spend only 3-5 minutes in paying taxes. He also added that the corporation response is very positive in all the problem solving aspects(Like handling of enquiries like water problem, road problem etc). Mr.Karthikeyan is only 31 years old. He was honoured with Best e-governance implementor for the year 2001 by Mr.L.K.Advani(Dy.PM).  Technology is growing for the people. We must see it as a boon for our life, not as a stumbling block.   Bye for now.

      That was the caption of Ms Office XP. Relevant too for what am going to say. Just reminding you of Ranjini's lines in one of her posts -  the inspiration behind this post..!!   "....... is not a problem which is identified today but then long time back and a vivid solution to all such things were also proposed by eminent writers to be followed by all! "   A phrase that needs to be looked upon with utmost care and caution. There is always a tendency for everyone to "accept" something from someone who is "eminent" (and "eminent" is a relative term). The human mind is so much attuned to "follow" the "greats" that we often tend to forget our ordinability in life... That stems from the fact that we feel that we know "lesser" compared to some people who are accepted to be eminent across times... Not completely untrue... I don't say we know "more".. but that, we have the power of discretion and of course the "common sense" that is expected to ring the horns on our heads to whatever the mind tries to perceive.   What was stated as "this" by the 'eminent' person may not be "that" for me. But the mind often forces us to reject our thoughts and rather falls upon what the 'eminent' person has said, just because we feel "I can never be as right as that 'eminent' person. After all, the whole world agrees he's eminent...".  This same theory can be extended to religion and religious practices. We do things just because some 'knowledgeable' person has said it should be done. I take you back to one of my earlier post about superstitions.. and am precisely referring to those same aspects. There is also a demarcation between being spiritual and being religious.. (I'll devote a separate post to that last line later, may be next week)... Religiousness is, among other things, predominantly confined to practices laid down my "eminent" and "knowledgeable" persons of the ancient/medieval times, while spirituality is beyond the realms of religious practices.   If Galileo had accepted Aristotle's (who was an "eminent" scholar himself) Geo-centric theory, we would still be languishing and puzzling over a maze called "space". If Einstein did not dare to "assume" that nothing can travel faster than light, we would not have got the Relativity theory.   These people became eminent because they had the guts to reject eminent people of their times.   The bottomline is..  Of course, listen to your elders, teachers, sacred books, philosophy or the deemed eminent personalities..  but do remember, its not in reading sacred books or listening to 'eminent' people, that one gains wisdom...   But, Listen to your feelings. Listen to your Highest Thoughts. Listen to your experience. Whenever any one of these differ from what you've been told by your teachers or read in your books, forget the words. Words are the least reliable purveyor of Truth. And you have to dare to do that...!!  -----------------------------  Moral certainty is always a sign of cultural inferiority.  The more uncivilized the man, the surer he is that he knows precisely what is right and what is wrong.  All human progress, even in morals, has been the work of men who have doubted the current moral values, not of men who have whooped them up and tried to enforce them.  The truly civilized man is always skeptical and tolerant, in this field as in all others.  His culture is based on "I am not too sure."    - H.L. Mencken

      Hey Mahendran, that is really a moving piece of work!  Ranjini, I am anazed at your growing interest in multiple fields. Its true that if you have passion for something, you will definitely find time for it. Kudos...carry on.   The discussion is too good that i find myself in a limbo between Bala's view and the rest. Thogh there is not much i could say as everything have been said...  Had it not been for the technology i woudnt even have dreamt about coming to UK let alone living...the only link between me and my loved ones is the blessed phone and the gifted internet. Regarding the working hours, people in western countries goive utmost priority to their personal life, they make it a point not to work during weekends and after 5 pm in the weekdays. But in most cases its the other way round in India. Even if you dont want to you are forced to work longer hours, which means compromising personal life. Problem lies in our work culture.  We may be living in a mechanical world but it doesnt mean that our love for our dear ones is going into the drains. Grinding chutney with stones and washing clothes with my hands will definitely give me pleasure but will my fast paced environment let me have time for these things. The answer will probably be a big ' No '. We perfectly understand that this is not the only way to show your love for someone.  People had been expressing their love before centuries back, when the word ' technology ' sounded alien, and will continue to do so, but with a touch of modernisation as long as they have a genuine love.

      Thatz it... Jax "what if technology begins to control us?..." I hope Bala is trying to emphasize this in different manner...  I do agree with Kishore & Valli, yeah certainly's Manny's quote on how to use it....  But... the point here is... rn't we dependent on Technology rather to put us we are making use of it...  Can you stay a whole night if "Storm" rolls the electricity out...Then the city becomes a dessert / forest... yeah, U have to have control you rather than the technology... as Kicha points out... we have to switch off mobile to chew the fat lethargically.... it wont automatically sense ur mood (I heard Bill Gate's Home is designed so, How far its true, I have to taste and say)  Valli, If there is no mixer / grinder u should have prepared urself to grind on those 2 stones  or wash with the gentle palm in a single stone in cases of no current....  R V prepared for that. is the question here to put?????? Get going.... I will come out with spl.. matters....  Cheers....

      It's been a long time since I updated it. In fact the last time I updated it was back in May.  Currently I'm using it as a testing blog.  Take a look at the layout  urlLink there . Since most items that I wanted topost there is being posted at  Quod scripsi, scripsi ,  I decided to change its focus towards something else. I've got a couple of ideas about the directions that  Rantings of a sane mind  should take. I guess it might be the end of the year before it gets sorted out. So you'll have to wait for some time before it gets back on track.  I wouldn't agree that bloging is my hobby. It has become a part of my regular life nowadays. Since we use the blog as a platform for discussing, I don't feel that blogging is a hobby. It's more like a indirect conversation. You were right in saying that reading cannot be considered a hobby. Searching for a definition of hobby gave me these descriptions: hobby: (noun) -    An activity or interest pursued outside one's regular occupation and engaged in primarily for pleasure;   an auxiliary activity;   a subject or plan upon which one is constantly setting off;  a favorite and ever-recurring theme of discourse, thought, or effort;   that which occupies one's attention unduly, or to the weariness of others;   a ruling passion.    Considering point no. 4, 5 and 6, can it be presumed that love is a hobby? Any thoughts.

      Google is testing software that lets people navigate the Web without opening up an Internet browser, placing itself in a field that Microsoft has designs on -- desktop search. On Thursday, the Mountain View, Ca.-based search company debuted the Google Deskbar. The downloadable software for users of Microsoft's Windows operating system puts a Google search box in the desktop taskbar. Using the free tool, people can search for information on the Web while in a Word document or e-mail application. But instead of launching a browser, the Deskbar will display results in a small window in the lower right of the screen.

      Ya, with in two days i could see lots of happening in blog! good and FYI all the articles posted related to English literature in Elite essays are not written by me and its by a renowned person. i just do the job of just blogging! So dont mistake them to be works of mine! And apart from that there will also be articles which are not exactly related to English literature, but then they are all time interesting to read too! So enjoy reading them all and i will be updating them as and when required unlike flowers blog where i will try to update everyweek.   Valli, Ganesh is also cominga! good! hope u people to have a nice time here....  And kavi, answer to ur question of how i do get time? If some thing is interesting for u, u will definitely sift time, how so ever u are busy, to do what u need! And need not say, Srini always backs me when i start such works and encourages me at any cost. Infact he is the one who makes me do this u can say! Now got it?!  What? vijay babu has mailed ua kavi? y not to the blog? Vijay idhu sari illa.  Thanx ganesh for ur words and hope to see the snaps soon!   Hei guys i went to Sanjay Subramanyan's (renowned vocalist in Carnatic Music)concert yesterday u know. Very nice his voice is! ya , the auditorium was jam packed and when we went, there was no seat and can u imagine, people were sitting in the pathway and on the stage-near the performer, outside the auditorium-in the verandah, standing at the entrance of the auditorium and in almost all places. We too sat in the pathway and listenend. It was a different experience sitting there and listening. We sat in the pathway at the center and so could clearly see him. His gestures are funny but at the same time are pleasant too. Something different it was for me! Enjoyed it like anything! Ya both music and his gestures.  What Mahen any more blogs on Five sense or  Ok guys, i will blog later bye for now

      i am sorry, i dint inform u people, coz i was not so regular in posting it, though i had decided to do so. So thought will inform, once i go in full swing, but then since u people have found it out, i now declare it to u all!  urlLink Flowers for you ! Thanx for ur comments. All of you do pay a visit and let me know ur opinion too. i will provide a contact link thru which u can communicate with me too. Its not yet fully developed and i need to add some more stuff to the blog.   Actually, i took this as an exercise to post about a flower, everyweek to a group of people and at the same time, i used to update this blog also. but then since i had some work, i just couldnot continue doing so, this month. And since u people find it interesting, i will notify u all when updated. It will b usually friday of every week.   Apart from this, i do am maintaining another blog, which contains some great works in English literature and some interesting articles regarding them. They are in the blog  urlLink Elite-essays  . I have talked about this blog before too. When time permits do pay a visit to this blog. There is an article about the poem The Wasteland in this blog, which is much relevant to what is being discussed these days in our blog. In the poem  The Waste Land , the poet  T.S.Eliot  has long time back talked about the complexities and problems of Modern world.    Here are few lines from the essay on wasteland    As there could be no vegetation in a wasteland there is no sense of fulfillment in the modern world. In this modern world man-woman relationship has degenerated to the level of animality. Spiritual grace should come like rains and revive the moral life on this earth. This religious theme has inspired Eliot to write  The waste land .   Interstingly he has also given solution to such problems and amazingly its taken from Brahadaranyaka Upanishad ! Isnt it interesting?  Modernisation backed by technology is not a problem which is identified today but then long time back and a vivid solution to all such things were also proposed by eminent writers to be followed by all! But are we aware of such things and are we following it if we are aware is what is to be paid attention now. Coz to learn from other's experience(if one is worthy) is wise than to wait for one's own experience.

      How do we define hobby?....can we put it this way?......  Anthing you do, apart from your profession, that gives you pleasure & mental relaxation, & that is considered to be contructive.  Blogging is your hobby.....creating blogs is your pleasure......reading(I don't know, now-a-days it might help you in your profession) can also be considered...Listining to music & writing all those words in your brown diary(remember you were just behind me for two years)....you've even shown that diary to me once.....however, it was like greek & latin, to me......  Trying to be a down-to-earth person????.....  I can even say that there's no man without  hobbies......everbody should be doing something that relaxes them....that might not seem to be a hobby to them......I can never accept the statement "I don't have a hobby"....  BTW, you don't have sing that song(which i did'nt understand too), to welcome me......I'm just so much excited....can't wait to see my parents.....  expecting our first snow this week.....ooooohhh i walk out now, i'll freeze...even with my winter jackets......  yet to read Rini's new blog....

Thought of reading the whole thing sometime later. Some interesting discussion is going on. .... I accept valli's and kicha's arguments..everything depends on how you plan your life...External factors may try to take control over your life only when you are allowing it.           I bought a book of osho 'A cup of tea'  and trying to read it. Just gone through 2 pages till now. It's good. Valli..It's nice to hear taht you are coming to india...Just I got to know.When you are coming? I am going home this weekend. taking leave on friday for my friends marriage. Planning to visit cbe on friday..let me see.        Hope Again I will be tied up with work from next week. My PL is going to onsite for different assignment and we will be doing all the co-ordination and work. Next week I going to have some training in .Net.         I am searching for a good library here in adyar...After I joined here I can tell you that I haven't finished reading any book. Just 2 or 3 books I started and it's still in half way..:((        I got mail from vijaybabu.. he was describing his locality like his house is surrounded by gardens, swimming pool ,etc. Hope he is enjoying life.

      Rini, I don't remember you mentioning about your blog,  urlLink Flowers Flowers Flowers!  here. Just now got back from reading it. It's wonderful. And to think that you had kept it for almost three months is unacceptable. Maybe you had transferred your garden here. Hmm! no posts for this month yet. Good work on the blog. Hey everybody, visit the blog.

      It's good to see a discussion taking place after quite some time. BTW what are we discussing about.   Bala said that technology and modern life is taking a toll on our way of living. He cited a few instances where he would have been better off without the intervention of technology.  Kicha replies that,"our innate feelings have taken the back seat... " since technology has  invaded  entered our lives. He said that we have no option left and that it is not the technology that is to blame, but the people. Our prioritizing (or rather the lack of it) is what causes the problems.   Valli has cited an example where prioritizing allows her to enjoy a better life. And she also gave examples of how technology gave her some freedom echoing a few thoughts said by Kicha.  Manny, Valli and Kicha have all said that technology is in the hands of the individual, not the reverse. Amazingly everyone has a valid point in agreeing that we cannot do without technology  in the modern world. The question, what if technology begins to control us, is best left for sci-fi authors and writers to answer.  As long we don't surrender the things that makes us human to technology, we are doing fine. " Within this realm of choicelessness, we do choose how we live ". - Joseph Epstein  Coming back to my opening statement, what are we discussing about, 'Is technology ruining us or helping us?" Can someone tell me?   Interestingly Bala also said that " Simple pleasures in life will make a huge difference. " I wonder why no one has any comments on that statement.  So instead of giving a few examples and explanations on whether technology is ruining our lives, I will speak about simple pleasures in life. There are several such things that can help you a lot. Small things like Rini's newest hobby of collecting pictures of Indian sculptures or Manny's hobby of reading books may seem a waste of your precious time, but they are helpful in your life. I recall a story that I read somewhere, I guess in "The Seven Habits".   A new recruit to a group of woodcutters noticed that every couple of hours the woodcutters would stop their work and spend some fifteen to twenty minutes talking and joking. He thought that he should not be wasting that time (roughly one hour everyday). So for the next few days, he did not join the others during thier breaks and instead worked hard. At the end of the day, he felt proud that he had not wasted his day. But he noticed that the others had cut the same amount of wood that he had cut, inspite of them wasting an hour during the day. He couldn't understand it. Watching them keenly during the next couple days, he understood why. During the breaks that the woodcutters took, they sharpened their axes fine. The moral is that you can indulge in pleasures without compromising on anything.  I feel that everyone should cultivate a hobby. It can be anything. Anything that you feel is precious to you and worth spending some time on it. BTW, Rini, what happenend to your garden. But I have to confess that I don't have a hobby. A hobby has to pursued with zeal and determination, which I feel I lack.   Nowadays, I just go out at night as fast as I can on my vehicle. It is a refreshing experience. Especially with Coimbatore having a wonderful winter climate this year. The best times to go out is after 10 pm with little or no traffic and the fine mist descending to the ground. You should feel the cool wind blowing on your face, a mild shiver passing through your body, your breath forming little clouds in the air. It is an experience to be enjoyed. I guess it is hard to experience a similar feeling in Chennai now, but Bangalore, Lexington (i guess it is around 1 or 2 degrees C there) and Hinckley (what's the weather there, 10-11 degrees C) would provide the right climate for experience what I had described.  Waiting to see where the discussion will lead,  BTW, Kicha, your closing quote form Lennon was quite apt. But since quite a few people might have heard that song, I am posting the lyrics to the song. It becomes more meaningful.  Imagine there's no heaven, It's easy if you try, No hell below us, Above us only sky, Imagine all the people living for today...  Imagine there's no countries, It isn't hard to do, Nothing to kill or die for, No religion too, Imagine all the people living life in peace...  Imagine no possesions, I wonder if you can, No need for greed or hunger, A brotherhood of man, Imagine all the people Sharing all the world...  You may say I'm a dreamer, but I'm not the only one, I hope some day you'll join us, And the world will live as one. Though this song may seem unrelated to our discussion, I felt that everyone can have a good feel of a world if we can just imagine. I hope you feel inspired by the song.

         Having said and read all these about technology and its ill and good effects, I just remember an analogy, which I read from the book Living with Honour ...When somebody throws a dagger towards you, there are two ways to catch that. Either with the blade or with the handle...This is how we should see the technology and its effects and its up to u as to how you handle it....   Cares & Shares  Mahendran Jayavel

      Bala & Kicha....That was awesome......Hope i can expect an interesting counter arguement for this from Bala......  I'm sligtly inclined towards Kicha's arguements......One line was really catchy.."Choose your Priority"...... Bala,  career & work life is important....but life does not end with your office.......which might be hard for you to understand  at this stage of your life.....Seeing your dreams & goals come true, is your only point of focus now.....  I can quote a few examples from my own experience......Ganesh used to work till midnight, before mrg....but now he makes it a point to be at home before 7.00P.M.....Does that mean that he's not working for what he's paid?...He's just learned to balance both his work & personal life.  Bala, is it practically possible for somebody to make chutney from a stone grinder (I would'nt even call it a grinder....two stones....It's the hands that actually does the grinding).....Do you know that rice cooked in a rice cooker or an ordinary cooker is more nutritiuos than the older method of boiling it in a pot of water & finally draining all the starch?....Technology does help you to have nutritious food.....The curry powder which i use for my day to day cooking, is the one which my mom prepared for me(because we don't get it here...& i myself don't know to prepare it)..So how am i going to preserve it for an year or so, without my freezer...Does'nt technology help me out there?......  Technology has made the whole world as a global village.....Can  you imagine doing an out-of-book college assignment without the help of google or any of the search engines?.....  If you blame Edison for inventing brightness, why don't you travel even more backwards on the time wheel & complain the invention of zero(we Indians)...if there was'nt any zero, there would have been no math at all.....We would have still been as earlymen counting herds with stones.....making no use of the sixth sense.....  It was not only Indians who lost their jobs, the whole world suffered.....Economy is a cycle of booms & dips...just like a sine wave.....You did'nt complain technology, in a rising economy....& you should'nt complain technology for the fall, because it was you & me who made the field to saturate, & when the level of tolerance exceeded, baaaaaaaang!  When people here ask us, what are we doing & when we say that Ganesh is a software engg...& i'm a programmer & computer student...they have been giving this feed back always......"Ahhh! i know.  you guys are really good at that"...Is'nt this something we have to be proud of?....Indians are considered to be intellectuals.....Had it not been for the IT revolution, we would have still been unnoticed......  One final pleasant news....another feather in India's crown because of technology.....One of the American channels is going to telecast a program "India the future super power, because of IT".......A fast spreading news amongst the Indians here....Got this message from Vinitha yesterday.....  Technology can be used both ways..... a constructive weapon as well as destructive weapon.... It all depends on the hands that uses it!!

      Interesting article by Bala... its so true that in the guise of shrinking the world with technology our innate feelings have taken the back seat... But having said that, my question is.. are we left with an alternate option... We are talking globalization, competition... The days of a laid-back Govt job, that gives you job security for life and also takes care of ur post-retirement life has become a thing of the past... the days where one could start from home at a comfortable 9AM and be back by 6PM are only available to be seen in films...   On the other hand... the "cursed" WebCam is what enables an anxious mom to see her child's face who might be working thousands of miles away... imagine the happiness in her face... the equally "cursed" VoIP is what helps the beloved talk with her overseas counterpart without losing much weight in her purse...  Did anyone ever think that a simple coffee could ever be made into so many different varieties... Did the pre-modern man ever had the privilege of tasting food stuff from across the globe right at his door step... some may not be all that good for health... but then, given the pollution levels, even breathing is bad for health...   Washing machines and the chutney grinders may not do as neat or as delicious a work as does the dear one's (which normally refers to the female "dear") palm.. but it does give a break to her tired palm.. how many more eras will the so-called "dear one" spend in washing and cooking... that palm could also be used for some other creative work other than just washing and cooking that she's been doing for ages...  So.. the bottomline is.. its the way you "choose" to use it... prioritize ur activity... the means are available for u... its up to you to put that to proper use... once in a while, a visit to coffee day or McDonalds is going to be enriching... but not if we do it everyday.. as the cliche goes "too much of anything is good for nothing"...  Valli talks to her mom on weekends.. technology enables her... Bala himself has got a mobile for some special reasons... technology is helping him... And this very medium of discussion is because of a technology... Don't choose to use technology just because it is there... use it when there is a need to use... just as the simple difference between "want" and "need"... you drink coke... but you'll never use it as a replacement for water.. if you try to do it, that's where the dangers of technology begin.. as long as u don't do it... u have both coke's refreshing taste and also the impeccable panacea called water... if u understand what I mean...!!  To quote bala...  tell me one pleasant moment you and your loved one chewed the fat without being disturbed by a mobile call?    If "chewing the fat" with your loved one is sooooo very important.. then, why the HELL don't you switch ur mobile off...??? Choose ur priority...!!  Problem is with people.. not technology..!!  ---------------------  You may say I'm a dreamer, but I'm not the only one. I hope some day you'll join us, And the world will live as one.    - John Lennon, "Imagine"

      Dear Friends,  I thank all the good souls for your wishes and greetings on My Birthday. A special word of thanks goes to Rajesh and Bala(Ask them). They called me and wished me sharp @ 12 O'clock. I cut the cake with my room friends sharp @12 O'Clock. Then it was cake abhisegam like our PG birthday celebration. Those days are still evergreen in my mind.  Nice to hear Valli returning home with Mr.Ganesh. I think this will be II thalai pongal for her. Sindu, nee eppo return with unnoda hubby ooda.  I have an article why the Americans celebrate thanks giving during the 4th thursday in November  On the fourth Thursday in November, Americans celebrate Thanksgiving. We have a special meal and give thanks for our blessings. This tradition began with the first European settlers in North America as a celebration of the harvest in 1621. Some of the foods included in the meal are turkey, cranberry sauce, mashed potatoes, and pumpkin pie.   What about Vijay? Has he become the sole propreitor of Patni.  Bye for now

      Hi everybuddy,  Hope our class boys and husbands of our class girls are working hard. When my brain takes the topic of working hard and growth it coerces me to think about the technological growth.   Putting myself as an evangelist I am captivated, but conversely there are blues. Let me put it elaborate.   Technology yields growth and makes me lazy. Technology gives wealth and keeps me away from the rest.  If there wasn’t an idiot thing called Tele Vision I would have interacted more with my family. If there wasn’t a stupid device called mobile, my passion towards meeting people would have been more. If at all there was Edison I would have slept at the earliest. If there is no such thing known as computers I would not have had much of my Indian brothers without work.  Two or three plastic cards, a mobike, mobile, billiards or snookers, coffee day; my like and dislike isn’t a matter of consideration. I am forced to have these. Aren’t we missing the pleasures of meeting our loved person after years of separation? (Curse webcams, VOIP’s, Internet, e-mail etc.) When was the last time you had food with all your family members present?? (curse hot packs, refrigerators..) tell me one pleasant moment you and your loved one chewed the fat without being disturbed by a mobile call?  Isnt there a difference between a machine washing your dear one’s clothes and you doing it for him/her? Isnt there a difference between automatic oven and your loved ones palm?   Simple pleasures in life will make a huge difference. As Murtu puts it “we are marching towards making of a materialistic world”. We are playing for the sake of playing and not for the sake of pleasure.   In future if I am blessed with a whole Sunday with my dear, It makes sense for me to switch of my mobile, TV etc., and prepare a cup of black tea and say “I LOVE YOU DEAR” instead of taking her to a coffee day and order for two capacinos.       Somewhere we need to draw line between artificial good things and real good things.   Test it by yourself…..  Chutney from mixer grinder and chutney from the stone grinder.  Taste  will tell you which is the real good thing.  (tring tring….) it’s a call in my mobile and am returning to the dubious world.  Bye  Bala

      Valli, Good to hear that you'll be in India soon, Athukaga "Ghar aaja Pardesi.."nnuu engalala padda mudiyadhu.   Sri, a very happy birthday da. Hope you have a wonderful day today.  RIni, how are your dance and music classes going on? Planning on any arengetram soon. Send me your contact no's. Kicha and Ram, you too send your numbers.   Last night, Saw "Alaipayuthey" for the n th  time, where n>20. This time on DVD. Though Rahman has mixed and improved the tunes of Alaipayuthey in 'Saathiya', nothing beats the original. The background score has the best till date from Rahman. Nothing to say about Mani Ratnam's direction and the camera-work by PC Sreeram. A wonderful story.   Tonight, I'll be watching "Kannathil Muthmamittal". The two movies came packaged as a single DVD.   Meanwhile, here are a few  urlLink things to do  when your net connection goes down.

Also I would also like to see photos taken by others (Valli, Sindhu, Ram, Manny etc.) to the Yahooo Groups or through mail.   Though I cannot send you any photos, I'll try to send you as much information about sculptures whenever possible.

      Dear friends, i am interested in collecting some of the best sculptures residing in our temples. So if anybody go to some historic temple, can u please take a snap of them and send me a copy too? I can bear the amount in printing, developing and couriering by sending u an M.O.  And ganesh, i need this help from u, yes, if u happen to go to Tarasuram, do visit Airateswarar temple. its a very beautiful one belonging to 12th century and its the same temple which i had mentioned in one of our earlier blog. Do get me snap of the Gajasamhara murthy and other idols if possible. Actually there is a museum in which they have got the photograph of such idols. If u could take a snap of it and send me i would M.O u the amount it costs. Since i dint carry a camera, i couldnot catch them. But i need them. so do it when u are free..... please!  Hei guys, u know what, i have cut my hair, yes, its no more longer as it was when i was doing M.S. so those who meet me next time, dont wonder at my new outlook!  bye for now Ranjini

      Ram, hope you had a very nice birthday yesterday. Sorry da, I don't have your Bang. contact number. Infact I don't have any ones'c contact numbers at Bangalore. Could you send me your number, office and home or PP. (Kicha's and Rini's too).  Well da Bala, I see your first post was a "chotta" one. Hoping to see a bada post from you soon.  Kicha, Yes, it is deplorable. I guess that our Union Minister might have had the intention to make the selection process transparent. But how far it will be transparent is to be seen.  Yesterday afternoon, I watched  Dreamcatcher  on DVD. It was wonderful. It wasn't scary like Sinduja had conveyed in one of her  urlLink posts . I haven't read the book by   urlLink Stephen King  , the best selling horror fiction author. But I guess the director had toned down the horror factor in this film. Though many books by Stephen King have been made into  urlLink movies , the best was " urlLink The Shawshank Redemption ".  Rini, you can add Stephen King to my list of favorite authors. He writes horror stories. But the above film, The Shawshank Redemption was one of best movies that was ever made. If you get a chance to see it, don't miss it. It is not a horror film. The film portrays the strength of the human spirit in such beauty that the film lifts you up.  Coming back to Dreamcatcher, the location where the movie was shot was so beautiful that it takes your breath away. The alien creatures were not frightening. But the idea of a memory warehouse, a virtual storehouse where the hero stores his memory is so innovative and appealing, that I wish I had one like that. The movie had interesting dialogues with lot of humor that you forget that it is supossed to be a horror movie. The background score was impeccable, suiting the movie to a T.  Last night, I viewed another film, Maverick, starring Mel Gibson and Jodie Foster. a hilarious comedy. I have not yet seen it fully, only about a half an hour or so. I'm planning to watch the rest tonight.  More later,

      Ciao guys n gals,  That is a laudable debate by Infy Intelligent (Kicha). I take stance as a mid man here like the verdict of a â€œpatti mandramâ€�. Just for the sake that our seniors (age or experience) have been practicing something I cannot take it for granted. If that is so then we would have missed the â€˜out of the box thinkingâ€™ which I admire the most. Every generation is augmented with intelligence and sense of reasoning. Before a brand new idea egg hatches the next updated idea egg is delivered.  I recollect, â€œIf you want to stay where you are today, keep runningâ€� If we need to keep up with the pace it becomes necessary for us to leave even the good things ( recall my earlier blog) then how come we can practice something which has no reasoning on its back..   If there is an answer for â€˜so what?â€™ in all my Grandmaâ€™s words I donâ€™t mind following that. If she doesnâ€™t have one and if at all you accept that my reasoning power is also good, then I would leave my brain to decideâ€¦  Kicha: I find some â€œdata type mismatchâ€�error in this mail da do u? Valli: Chottu means Intelligent in Portugal. When u come to India get me a bottle of wine Xavi : dei naanae dictionary paathu copy adichu than type pandran nee yennai meeruva pola irukku. Kavi: Kya ho gaya?  Visbab: Patniyala(PCS) paavam bombayla Patniya irukkan pola. Rajesh: irukkan irukkan Sri: yevanda professionals madhiyila ivana sethadhu???? Ganja: avanukkum yennakkum 22/11/03 ku appurom yendha sambamdhamum kidayadhu Sindu: Unnayum oruthar kalyanam panni,kudumbam nadathi, Mrchh boomi boomi madhiriyae porumayanavar pola.

      Hope u are aware of what is happening around... the entire gamut of future-managers suffering because of some unscrupulous idiots... My point here is not that, the leak of CAT question papers springs a surprise.. In fact, it does not..!! For, such things have been the order for a lot of prestigiuous degrees... But what is surprising is what I read in  urlLink The Hindu  this morning...    Besides the CBI investigation, the Union Human Resource Development Minister, Murli Manohar Joshi, has decided to constitute a separate inquiry into paper leakage. It was only last week that the Ministry had indicated a likelihood of asking IIMs to restructure the CAT process by doing away with group discussions and interviews to make it more transparent.    I wonder why people are trying to infuse politics into education at the levels of IIMs and IITs which have  earned worldwide acclaim for the quality of students it produces. Was he thinking that he could enable people to "sell" themselves to the IIMs by scrapping the GD/interview in the name of "transparency"...?? Its better for the students and the country as long as politicians don't interfere with the affairs and procedures of such premier institutes of the country and leave it to the persons who really "know" what they are doing...

      Hi,  Being in SBU-Tirupur BDE for more than 1 year,  I learnt a lot from Tirupur. Here is a gist of it. Tirupur is located in Coimbatore district, 54 Kms away from Coimbatore(Bala veetula iruntha just 6 km than!!!). Most  people are mainly into Garment Exports. The turnover of Tirupur per year is estimated to be about Rs.7500 crores.   Many foreign companies like  urlLink Wal-Mart ,  urlLink JC Penny , urlLink FUBU  , Classic polo are outsourcing their T-shirts from here. Some of the main exporters in Tirupur are Eastman Exports, Premdurai Exports, Stallion Garments. Around 3,00,000 people are getting employment directly and indirectly from these garment companies. Many people from near by cities like Coimbatore, Erode, Somanur, Avanashi are coming to job by means of train to Tirupur.(Yours truly is one of them).  Indian Cricket and Hockey team players are made in Tirupur. Tirupur has taken order to supply garments for the forecoming  urlLink Athens 2004 olympics  Garments are designed for different ages from Kids to Old people.  Garments are designed by taking into consideration of design, aesthetics, colour. Nearly 1500 big companies(nearly 70% are ISO 9001:2000 Certified, 35% are ISO 14001 Certified companies are here.   Tirupur supports well for the revenue for Government of Tamilnadu. Tirupur is spearheading in revenues after Chennai. But, Tirupur lacks behind is in the professionalism in which people work. Even Tirupur is financially very strong, but infrastructure is very worst.  Ok I will continue my Tirupur episode again , after some time  Nanban Ramgopalkum, Sogothari Josibakum en inya pirantha naal nal valthugal.  Bye for now

      Hi, Back again to office today. I was on leave for the past two days as I went to Thirumala and had a big fight with Lord venkatesa... he tried a lot to convince me but in vain... Had a goood darshan of Lord Venkatesa...The interesting part is that our president APJ, Chandrababu and the governor of andhra visited Thirumala just 30 minutes before we entered thirumala...high security and there was enough crowd due to president's arrival... enjoyed a lot in this ptrip to thirupathi with my anna... we both went there and there was pretty good crowd...everybody was rushing their way to see the lord and running literally like a stampede...at one point in time me and my anna also started running on our way...ha ha...once it happenend that my brother ran too fast in between the crowd and i started shouting ..."Anna ipdi vittuttu odureengale annaannu, govidhaaa vittuttu oduriye govindhaannu...haeeeeeeheeee...because i left my purse in the room and also i dont know the way also pretty well to the room and if i miss him then we may end up searching each other....ha ha...govinda govindannu kathikitte odinen...ha ha...  This is my first visit to tirupathi since my birth... imm...let me see what's there in store for me from yeluguntalavaaadaaaaaaa for all these troubled and infact joyful dharshan!!!... and coming to dogs... imm...ranjini is right...nee unnoda voracious readers listla ennai sekkalannu three days aluthen theriyuma....he e hehhehehhehheeeeeeee... ippo kooda alugaya varuthu....nee sethukitta appuram thaan alugaye ninnuchu...ha ha... apram valli actually i started my research on man and ended up in dogs eventually(.............what to do...may be this may further lead me to apes and chimps....) I want to make a point here...hope u all remember a post by our blog father abt butterflies...so this dog's episode can be thought of as another episode of blog father's...okva... (rest about other animals in future...)  Coming to VVS...i hope all VVS members are in great varutham nowadays...no posts and active participation...may be a number of reasons can be attributed for that...one being all the members of VVS except me Ram jax and kishore may not have enough access to the net and systems... so far me ram ajayan kishore ganesh jax vijay and bala are the members of VVS rini...let me try out something to make it more lively and interactive...the fact is that I dont have enough experience as our blog father has and I suppose that I may not be able to devote my time and effort to format the blogs ( thanks da Jax for formatting my post...) and provoke the participant's interest and moreover the success of these kind of societies communities and group activities will depend more on the kind of participants and their interests...and thanks to ganesh for posting his first 4 lines in VVS. Yes. Nowadays ganja cud not find enough time as he has to brush all his dealer's teeths for proving CPL product's performance..ha ha. ( kidding machaan...dont take it serious and dont stop brushing your dealer's teeths...)  Nothing more interesting to say now...have a nice day  cares & shares Mahendran Jayavel

      I was in a training this forenoon... on secure coding... it was an amazing session... the trainer (one, Rangarajan from Microsoft), demonstrated how to hack... he simluated a small program in C to exploit a Buffer Overflow, which is the most frequent reason for security vulnerability in software products... I never thought hacking could be so easy.. that is, if u leave that much loopholes in ur code...

      Sindhu and Ganesh, good to have you both back.  Yenda Ganesh, phone panni blog pannunnu sonna than blog pannuvaiya. Illati romba busy. Kooda supporttuku un thangachi.  Sindu,"The Other Side of Midnight" is not his latest book. Look at  urlLink this site  for his latest books. I'll get my books when I meet him him the next time.  Rajesh and Bala came home last night. Last night watched half of "The Matrix Revolutions". It was too boring. No intellectual content as the previous two movies. Yet to see the fight for Zion and Smith/Neo fight.  Hope that is atleast interesting.  I'm eagerly awaiting " urlLink The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King ". Hope it isn't disappointing as The Matrix Revolutions. As for books, I completed "The Covenant of the Flame" by David Morrell. David Morell was the man who wrote "First Blood" and "Rambo". "Jack: Straight from the guts" is halfway through.   Today, I might start reading "Mayday" by Nelson DeMille. You can read the first chapter of the book  urlLink here .  Bye for now,

      Helloooooo guys!  Oru valiya yenga annan blog pannitanga...athunala yennoda virathatha  ithudan mudithu kolgiren..... my pc was having fun with some virus ...so its was behaving in a crazy manner. Ranjini....yevalo thairiyam irunda u did not turn when my anna called you...iru iru unna pathukaren! I am not sure whether i fit into those voracious readers category....anyway thanx for that....the book i enjoyed the most was ' Contagion ' by Robin Cook....i have read most of Sidney Sheldon's books...looking forward to his latest ' The other side of Midnight ' - is that right Xavier.....lately started reading James Patterson's...recently read ' Silence of the Lambs ' and currently reading ' Hannibal '. BTW Xavier please collect your books from Vinod.  Towards late October and early November there were fireworks all over Uk...i thought perhaps English are celebrating Diwali as well...no..it was for something they call as 'Bonfire Night'...i didnt have a clue about it.So when I asked one of my English friend, this was the reply i got...  "In England, we like to be a little different from the rest of the world.Take fireworks festivals, for example. In every other country they are heldin summer. That's obviously the best time: warm weather to enjoy, and clearskies to see the fireworks.Not here. We have our Fireworks Night on 5 November, when it is damp, cold,and misty. Other countries use fireworks to celebrate success: sporting victories,musical events, weddings.Not here. We don't find success very interesting. We prefer heroic failure. Fireworks Night celebrates an attempt to blow up the Houses of Parliamentin 1605 that went wrong - the 'Gunpowder Plot'. On 5 November that year,Catholic terrorists smuggled 36 barrels of gunpowder into a cellar there.They hoped to bring down the government. However, they were caught just intime, and executed in a very slow and grisly manner.  So we celebrate this day every year with fireworks. Some of us celebratethe fact that they failed. Others celebrate the fact that they nearly succeeded. Here is something else very English. Fireworks Night is also called 'GuyFawkes Night'. Guy (or Guido) Fawkes was only a minor member of theterrorist group, the man who was going to light the fuse; the leader was called Robert Catesby. But Robert Catesby is a boring name. It sounds like an estate agent or a solicitor. Guy Fawkes is an intriguing, mysterious-sounding secret agent's name, so we remember him instead. "  Welcome Sri....perhaps a bit late one from me though! Mahendra...naya pathi yellam research panra pola?  Hmmmmmmm Valli....India poriya???

      I had a fascinating night's sleep y'day. I had 3 dreams and remember each one of them to whatever precision I looked at them while dreaming... And dreams can never get crazier than this...   1. I'm fighting in Iraq... (Don't already laugh, there's lot to go)... But not wearing the army uniform, rather normally clad. I hear gun shots all around. I could hear them so well in my dream. It seemed so realistic... this proceeds for a while, and suddenly I begin to hear bigger sounds. The enemy (whoever it was) is starting to bomb... I think to myself "I don't have bombs.. they are technologically superior.. so its only a question of time before one falls on me.." moments later I hear a huuuuge thud on the roof right over my head... and I woke up... I was still alive....  2. Then the second spell started after I slept.. I'm inside the "Bhooth" film... Urmila is going around killing everyone... Her modus operandi is.. take a knife and rip from the right forearm to the left forearm... and people seemed to fall like nine-pins.. and no one was offering any resistance.. she just goes about killing people... One guy keeps looking at all this.. But it was not Ajay Devgan... then she comes to me... Now.. the same dialog that happens between the President and the alien in the film "Independence day" (which I saw 2 weeks back on Star Movies) takes place between me and her... I ask her "What do u want me to do.." and in the same hoarse voice as the alien in the film she says "Dieeee..!!" ... and I woke up... 2nd time lucky.. am still alive... and slept again...  3. This is the most hilarious one... I'm watching cricket match.. India are down under playing the aussies. Sachin hits an exquisite cover drive... not sure if it went for any runs.. Bill Lawry is commentating.. Yeah.. I could recognize that voice in my dream... it was so real... He says..."India are only 4 wickets down.. and they got 2 wonderful players to follow.. Dhanraj Pillay and Mohd Kaif.. its a tough time for aussies"... Yep.. u read it right... Dhanraj Pillay - the hockey player.. in the Indian cricket team.. not sure what happened afterwards, but once I woke in the morning.. there was a large smile writ all over my face - I had made Dhanraj Pillay a "wonderful cricketer".. and Bill Lawry himself acknowledged that..!! Nevertheless, It happens only in dream..!!!   Just feel like analysing a bit... and examine the sequence of events over the past few days that lead to imagining the specific images of these dreams.. will post my analysis as and when I get some points... Sigmund Freud into action..!!

      Rini, I had said earlier that I am trying to update the style sheets. But I am unable to do it from office. A look at  urlLink Quod scripsi, scripsi  will show how blockquotes work with different style sheets. Check out all style sheets.   As you might have noticed, most of the current style sheets in  All in a day's work!  use a white background. I use the mint stylesheet. I don't know about the style sheets the others prefer.   I am working on a couple of new styles, this time with background images and different presentation layouts. I hope to have them ready by next week. One will feature the sidebar on the left, and another design will feature the sidebar on the right. I have got the basics details worked out. Still got some work to do on fonts, spacing etc. Maybe by the end of November or start of December, they will be ready. So till then, you've got to adjust with the present format.

Ellatheyum addikadi format panna vendiyadha irrukku.  Ram, I didn't understand your case study at all. Anyone made any sense of it.  Dei, I can understand Eco, but not your case study. As Kicha said, the answer is a road, actually I was thinking of a highway.  I guess this weekend will be a treat weekend for those in Bangalore, Kicha and Rini completing 1 year at thier work. Ram celebrating his birthday. Enjoy it.  I was planning to go to Maduraio this weekend. But as my parents are going to Hyderabad, I decided to stay at home.

        Learning About Life from a Dog         Hi bloggers, i have been reading all the posts and watching as a silent observer for the past couple of weeks as i did not get any thing to say about philosophy or literatures...may be it takes some more time for me to taste those stuff...(may be after marriage when I may need peace of mind...) and here is a piece of information that i came across while surfing the net for info on dogs...quite interesting and i hope some of u may have read this earlier...even I suppose that I have read this previously...anyhow with respect to rini's words, I want to publish something...ha ha. and thanks rini for adding me too in the list of Fortune (500) Voracious readers...see i have been reading these kind of stuffs related to dogs and all...definitely I deserve a place in this list ma...ha ha.    Dogs have a natural, inborn philosophy toward the life they live. It doesn't matter where they are or who they are living with. You can learn some good attitudes to follow by observing what a dog does and enjoys.       Questions you may have about this are:           What can I learn from such an animal?         Can this be applied to business?         How does that relate to my life?          18 things to do       Observing what dogs do can teaches us how we can lead a better life. The following list of 18 things dogs do--written by an unknown author--points toward attitudes to follow:      Never pass the opportunity to go for a joy ride    Allow the experience of fresh air and the wind in your face to be pure ecstasy.   When loved ones come home, always run to greet them.   When it is in your best interest, practice obedience.    Let others know when they have invaded your territory.   Take naps and then stretch before rising.    Run, romp and play daily.   Eat with gusto and enthusiasm.   Be loyal.   If what you find lies buried, dig until you finally get it.   Never pretend to be something you're not.   When someone else is having a bad day, be silent, sit close and nuzzle gently.   Thrive on attention and let people touch you.   Avoid biting when a simple growl will do.   On hot days, drink lots of water and lie under a shade tree.    When you're happy, dance around and wag your entire body.    Delight in the simple joy of a long walk.   No matter how often you are scolded, don't buy into the guilt and start to pout. Rather, run right back and make friends.      In conclusion       We would all lead happier lives if we followed these 18 principles, taken        from observing the way dogs act.    You must lift a leg to do things...ha ha...with Regards,  Mahen

      A blockquote is a HTML tag that is used when you want to quote something, usually something that's more than a line. You can use a blockquote as described  urlLink here .  Yeah, the Yellow color looks great on Black, but horrible on the other backgrounds. Use blockquotes instead.  It is a pity that Rajesh will be out of India during Christmas. I was planning to invite him home. Anyway maybe next year da.

      I went to Nithyasree's concert on Monday. That day my workload was heavy and i had to go to dance class and then have to go all the way to Chowdiah hall to attend the concert. I was exhausted. But when i stepped inside chowdiah hall where the concert took place, i just forgot everything and felt anew when i stepped out.   She is very good at delivering songs in tamil than in other languages. Her pronounciation is so crystal clear and she is highly energetic too. She sang Kaatrinile varum geetham, really classic and so many other songs, never to say, throbbed me!  Guys at B'lore those who get to attend any concerts at chowdiah hall, dont miss, its a beautiful auditorium, fully a/ced and the building is of the shape of violin. Looks aesthetically designed too.  And it was a non ticketed event and so the crowd was heavy, but then since the hall is too big, we could see people coming after the concert had started too.  Valli, welcome home after a long time! Hope to meet u, if possible!   Jax, That was something big and interesting too on semiotics.  I think manny is angry coz i dint list him in voracious reader's list. Sari onnaiyum sethukalampa, appo appo blog pannu enna.  y rajesh threatening us?  Ram, i cant get the case study........... i am going to get help from ........................ All of u please vote for the following.  I can get help for the case study posted by ram from   1. Balaji sir  2. P.C.

      The broken white line stretches far into the horizon. The tiny bumps reflect the bright lights. The dark swath cuts through the land with no regard for man made boundaries and at times with utter disregard to nature. Who am I?

      Valli, Good to hear that you'll be returning to India soon. Hope to see you then if possible.   Sri, I guess you would  have to give me a double treat for 1 year and for your avartham. But before that we have Ram's birthday. That too on a Sunday, So I guess he cannot escape from giving a treat to those in Bangalore.  Anyone knows where Ganesh is? I am not finding time to meet Rajesh and Bala here.   Since my last post was too long, I am keeping mum today. Of course, as the final between India and Australia will begin in the afternoon, I guess that's all from me today unless...

      NOVEMBER 18, 2002: It was a warm weather in Mangalore. So I didn't care to touch the geyser.. while Dhinesh made the entire bathroom fill up with vapour... Went to have the complementary breakfast that was given everyday at the hotel.. Got to meet a few more joinees at the restaurant... with some hot bondas, idli and tea... it was a perfect breakfast for the first day... Then off we went to the bus stop with the offer letter tucked in our hand.. we knew what bus to catch.. as we had rehearsed it the previous day...  We kept  looking out of the window, as none of us were sure of when the stop comes... and finally got down at the right place... The security at the gate quickly glanced through the letter verified something with his list and sent us in... and there were already loads of people standing at the reception, not knowing where to turn... and we both joined the searching fun...  And someone then showed us the way.. to a hall named "Nalanda". This is where most of our training classes would be held. And then, people flocked in to the hall... and took their most comfortable seats..   There was lots of murmering.. after all, we still were more of college students.. yet to come to terms with the professional realities... it was around 9AM, when finally someone wearing the ID card tag around his neck came into the room... and suddenly all noise ceased. How college like... He was the HR guy there.. and we played a little game.. for trying to know each other's names.. the icebreaker...   And then, came one  by one, and showed different presentations, on the company, policies.. and lots of forms to fill up... In the afternoon, the ICICI people came and opened an account for us... opening an account was never so easy an affair...   We went home with a big load of forms to fill up overnight... the training, in genuine terms, was still some way from starting.. but we could already feel the ferver in the air...

      Dear Rini, It is unfortunate that you could not get any snaps. But anyway a good description with photos. When you are using a short quote, use the blockquote tags. Please, you seemed to have copy-pasted the short poem, it appears in bright yellow color, which is not nice at all with the white backgrounds. So I have changed it into a blockquote. Check the source code or click on edit within blogger to see how to put up blockquotes.   Regarding semiotics, I am preparing a rough guide on semiotics. Here is a short culling from my notes. Semiotics can be roughly defined as the study of signs. Semiotics comes from the Greek word, semeîon, meaning 'sign'.  Semiotics involves the study not only of what we refer to as 'signs' in everyday speech, but of anything which 'stands for' something else. In a semiotic sense, signs take the form of words, images, sounds, gestures and objects. Semiotics is concerned with everything that can be taken as a sign.  In simple terms...  For example, the word, ' Open ' , when you encounter it on a shop entrance, you come to know that the shop is open and you can go inside to purchase something. The same word, when seen on a button within a lift, lets you know that the lift will open when you press the button. You may also see the word on a cardboard box top, specifying the direction in which the box is to be opened.   What did you do now? You encountered a single word, yet the same word prompted you to perform different actions. The study of how a sign, in this case the word ' Open ', could take on different meanings to different situations is called semiotics. It is the study of how signs take on thier meaning with respect to their context and surroundings.  I could probably give lots of similar examples on how images or sounds, even gestures and objects could have different meanings in different contexts. You might have remembered a similar examples in our Marketing class about cultural differences or linguistical differences a brand can have.   On Eco, I don't think that he is too hard to understand. In the excerpt that I had given, the third para speaks about simple maths and the value of pi. Remember no one has still understood how all circular objects are united by this seemingly simple, but complex number. The fourth para speaks on physics and the properties of the pendulum. The fifth one is really a tough one. It contains references to both mythology and geography. I had to read the para more than a couple of times to understand it.  One interesting coincidence was that I had thought that Novaya Zemlaya was a mythological place, since I had never heard about it. The next day, I had gone to client's place. At the GM's office, I saw a huge map of the world. While waiting for the client to complete a call, I was looking at the map. I was trying to see if I could locate the places I had read the previous day. And to my surprise, I located Novaya Zemlaya. It is in Russia, very near to the North Pole. Back at the office, I searched for about it to see why it was mentioned. Amazing facts surfaced.   For people to go to the Pacific Ocean from the Atlantic Ocean (Europe was located in the northern postion of the Atlantic Ocean) entitled a long and dangerous journey around South America, if you can recall our high school geography. So seamen tried to find ways (north-east and north-west). The North Western passage would go through the North west Atlantic ocean and join the Pacific Ocean at the Bering Straits between Siberian Russia and Alaska. The North Eastern passage passed through the island of Novaya Zemlaya. While a few were successful in finding a path through the Northwest passage, many lost thier lives navigating the northeast passage. This was before aeroplanes came into existence and the railways were in thier infancy. Later on, the railroads across America paved the way for the country to become an advanced industrial nation it is today.   Interesting to know how just a small passage can help you understand geography and history a lot. That is one thing I liked about his book. Each page and paragraph was so full of information that Antony Burgess, another great writer, said that."This book needs an index." Interestingly, Avalon mentioned in the excerpt is a mythological place in British myths. Microsoft has chosen the name as a codename for thier user interface in thier upcoming Windows OS Longhorn.   Rini, the first page of the book starts with this quote.  Only for you, children of doctrine and learning, have we written this work. Examine this book, ponder the meaning we have dispersed in various places and gathered again; what we have concealed in one place we have disclosed in another, that it may be understood by your wisdom  - Heinrich Cornelius Agrippa von Nettesheim, De occulta philosophia, 3, 65 In case you are interested in reading this book, I have an electronic version of the book as a text file. If required, I can send it to you. It comes around 1 MB.  That's all for today,

      Hi everybody, ya it will b the first anniversary for me here in US&S.   And ya jax, i had a slight hint, that it might be a prediction from any one of the astro site. But couldnt think, since it look so personalised. any way good prediction man. Closely matches u.   Valli kolanthai, odambai bathrama paarthukko da.  sorry jax, Umberto Eco seems to be difficult for me. Ofcourse i think reading such paras will really be like reading a book in a language which u know least and trying to understand it with the help of a dictionary/encyclopedia.   Onakku purinja, engalukkum sollu so that we will also know some thing different like Arcane mythology. And rather than providing links for all the search results on semiotics, it would be better if u urself give us a simple definition, so that it will help us understand better, rather than going to all the sites and letting us know.   Hei today evening i am planning to go to Nithyasree Mahadevan's concert.  Hope to have a ncie time.

      i had been to almost all the Navagraha temples in and around Kumbakonam. It was nice to see all those temples in a leisurely manner. My parents, my sis and we both went in a car from Kumbakonam. So we had a pleasant journey and the climate was also very good.  First day, it was raining but still so enjoyable and the second day, it was sunny, but not scorching.   And in all temples we had a heartful dharshan. It was a satisfying trip for us. Especially we went to  urlLink Airadeeswarar  temple in Tarasuram. U cant just imagine the richness our ancestors have showered in the form of sculpture there. Simply beautiful u know. Full of  urlLink pillars  high in beautifully carved dance postures, fighting postures, all great saints, lords, and there were some very good sculpture which i think are worth sharing with u people.   There was one sculpture, where in there is a head of a women and four bodies, which are sculpted in such a way that which so ever way u look, the head is attached to any one of the body. Really so nice.  One more sculpture namely  urlLink Gajasamhara murthy  in Tamil, shows that Lord shiva is coming out from the inside of an Elephant. There are similar kind of sculptures found in Belur Temple and in Meenakshi amman temple too. The one which i have provided here as link is the one found in Belur. But the one which i found in Tarasuram was the most beautiful of all the three. I am sorry since i dint take snaps, i couldnt provide u one found at Tarasuram. It so gracefully shows how Lord Shiva tears out of the stomach of a mighty elephant like that of a tearing a Banana leaf and stepping on the head of that monstrous thing as stepping out of the bed (sombal murikira maathiri kai vachirukkar) It was really a thing to watch.Expressions on the face was infinite!  To end this blog, here are some mystic lines which held me most!   Overpassing lines that please the outward eyes   But hide the sight of that which lives within   Sculpture and painting concentrated sense   Upon an inner vision's motionless verge,   Revealed a figure of the invisible,   Unveiled all Nature's meaning in a form,   Or caught into a body the Divine.

      Rini, I guess your short trip to Thanjai and Kudandhai went off well. So, are you and Kicha planning to celebrate your respective first anniversaries at work? Hope your curiosity on who wrote "My Identity" was satisfied.  Manny, Sorry da, didn't get the mood to post anything on VVS. This week surely, there will be a few postings from me.  Started reading " urlLink Jack: Straight from the Gut " by Jack Welch, ex-CEO, General Electric. Got the book from Sri.   Guys, anyone planning to go to "Jay Jay". My advice: Don't. I learnt a lesson the hard way on Friday. First day, last show. The previous Tamil film I had seen in a theatre was "Rojakootam". After that, this one. No more watching tamil films in theatre here onwards. If it was a fifty rupees note in Rojakootam, this film features a hundred rupees note. I guess the next film that "Oscar" Ravichandran produces will feature a five-hundred or a thousand rupees note. The film is a total waste of time and money. And to think I skipped dinner to go to the movie makes me feel .....  The film is a straight copy from "Serendipity", shown on Zee MGM last month. The funny thing is that Nov. 7 saw the release of "Unnai Partha Naal Mudhal", Nov. 14 - "Jay Jay" and Nov. 21, "Ennaku 20, Unnaku 18" will be released. All three movies have been copied from "Serendipity".  If you think, you can watch the movie for Madhavan, it is a total waste of his talents. If you think you can watch the movie for the heroines, forget it. The music by Bharadwaj gets irritating after a couple of times. Location-wise, Kolkatta and Greece provide some succour. There is no comedy at all. Villains are totally pathetic and cliched.   If you have any hard feelings towards anyone, get them a ticket to this film and your revenge will never be such sweet.

      Hi everyone,  Kicha and Rini, congratulations on completing one year at your concerns. Valli, It's good to have you back. No news from Sindhu. Any calls or mails from her. Yahoo Groups seems to be accessible again. I don't know how long it will be before it is banned again.  Rini, you had asked me about my favourite authors. The truth is I have no favorite authors. There are several things that I like in different authors. For example:   Frederick Forysth  has the knack of keeping you on the edge of your seat through his prose;  Wilbur Smith  explains the richness and beauty of Africa through his works and  Jeffrey Archer  provides the most insane twists in the tale that you kick yourself for have not seeing it earlier itself.  Ken Follet 's stories are so thrilling and captivating that you want to read them again and again.  Tom Clancy  provides so much accurate information on military hardware that you become an expert on the subject.  David Morrell  writes about the strength of human spirit.  Jonathan Black  provides an insider's view on the power struggles and behind-the-scenes of the rich and powerful people and corporations.  Michael Crichton  blends technology and fiction that you are left wondering what is not possible by man.  Colin Forbes  and  Craig Thomas  provide interesting information about the British Secret Service and its part in the world stage through their works.  Umberto Eco  stitches different subjects to provide hours of excitement and discoveries.  Different writers have different styles. So  it is really difficult to pick any one. Even one-off writers like  Bill Gates  and  Jack Welch  have imbibed thier books with thier unique styles that at the end of the book, you feel like understood them. I like books that make me feel that I have lost a great friend when I complete it. Anyone writing such a book will be my favourite.  Bye for now,

      Hi, I'm completing 1 year of my career tomorrow.. and so is Ranjini... if u r not aware.. me and ranjini started our careers on the same day - Nov 18 - last year... so, here's a piece of my nastalgia...  NOVEMBER 16, 2002: I started from my home early in the morning and boarded the bus to Thiruppur.. to Bala's house... I had to catch West Coast Express to Mangalore that evening from coimbatore... after lunch we started to coimbatore.. Bala had some meeting in office... I put my luggage in cloak room and went for browsing.. chatted with vijay babu... then around evening.. sriprasath, bala, jax and ajayan were at the station... lots of talk about that Sri's famous letter to Rajkumar of Edge.. and amid a lot of hullabullo and noise and fun, I boarded the train...   NOVEMBER 17, 2002: Reached Mangalore early morning at 5.30 ... and my eyes fell on someone whose face seemed familiar to me.. and it didn't take much time to realise who was walking past me.. it was Kadri Gopalnath.. the saxophone maestro... then, called up home and informed of my safe arrival and went out looking for an auto...   Met the guy (Dhinesh) who would be my roommate, in the auto... incidentally he was also from Madurai (near arappalayam)... and we went to our hotel.. a 3-star one... and admiring and enjoying the luxury that had befallen us... after some chatting and breakfast.. both of us fell asleep... Dhinesh woke me up around 1.30PM for lunch... had a lousy lunch in a hotel... something that still makes us laugh our hearts out... We were curious to see the campus.. so enquired how to reach there and went to the campus... It was a very small one compared to Chennai .. but was looking very good, nevertheless...  Came back from there.. and there was a big marketplace adjacent to our hotel... we went walking for a coupla hours around that place.. he got a earphone for his walkman.. and I got "Kaadhal virus" cassette... and came back to the room... got to meet some other joinees who were staying in the hotel... and slept for the day with lots of anxiety on how the next day - the first day of our career would turn out...

      Hi...after quiet a long time.  Early last week, i was not feeling well.....Didn't go to college & work  for a couple of days...& now i'm running behing all my schedules......  Although I keep reading all the blogs daily, I really don't know, what to talk about today....So many issues, going around, i guess.....I might have to sit down & read them all, one more time, before i can post my views.....I hope i'll do that....  Had a chat with Kicha last week, & so I remember this one isuue very well....posted by Kicha.....Female Identity & words like "for men, their work is the life's purpose.. while for the women servicing their hubby is the life's purpose..." & Horoscope.....  About the saying above, I don't think 'servicing' is a right word there......Sure i'll always put my family first, not my career...I do  that because I love my husband & in the future I want my kids to get the best care.....  My opinion on this would be, I do agree with the point that, Family is very very important for a woman....But it does not take her entire time & brains to do that..... Though life might be quiet busy, turning back after years, we might get the eternal satisfaction that i've satisfied both my family & me.....  & about the horoscopes....I'm really confused myself.....Why is the divorce rate so low in arranged marriages? Horoscope is a science, It's not a myth.....i know just that much.....Maybe, I too need more inputs on this issue.....Would like to hear from you guys.....  Ok time for my class.....going now.... bye

      Ranjini, as you had said, it is his words that are interesting. Umberto Eco, in my opinion, is one great writer. He is a professor of semiotics at the University of Bologna, Italy. His works are absolutely brilliant. You can read a short biography  urlLink here .  Eco does not write. He instead constructs sentences. Sentences enhanced by the architecture of semiotics. To understand his works, you need to have a through understanding of subjects ranging from arcane mythology to simple logic. The best way to read one of his books, especially his  The Name of the Rose  and  Foucault's Pendulum , is to have an entire library at their disposal for reference.  If some one says to me, they read a lot of books, I ask them, "Can you tell me if you have read Foucault's Pendulum?" That's it. That one book is equivalent to reading several books on a wide range of subjects. For example, I am reproducing the first 5 paragraphs of  Foucault's Pendulum  below. Read it and tell me your thoughts on it.   That was when I saw the Pendulum.  The sphere, hanging from a long wire set into the ceiling of the choir, swayed back and forth with isochronal majesty.  I knew—but anyone could have sensed it in the magic of that serene breathing—that the period was governed by the square root of the length of the wire and by &Pi;, that number which, however irrational to sublunar minds, through a higher rationality binds the circumference and diameter of all possible circles. The time it took the sphere to swing from end to end was determined by an arcane conspiracy between the most timeless of measures: the singularity of the point of suspension, the duality of the plane’s dimensions, the triadic beginning of &pi;, the secret quadratic nature of the root, and the unnumbered perfection of the circle itself.  I also knew that a magnetic device centered in the floor beneath issued its command to a cylinder hidden in the heart of the sphere, thus assuring continual motion. This device, far from interfering with the law of the Pendulum, in fact permitted its manifestation, for in a vacuum any object hanging from a weightless and unstretchable wire free of air resistance and friction will oscillate for eternity.  The copper sphere gave off pale, shifting glints as it was struck by the last rays of the sun that came through the great stained-glass windows. Were its tip to graze, as it had in the past, a layer of damp sand spread on the floor of the choir, each swing would make a light furrow, and the furrows, changing direction imperceptibly, would widen to form a breach, a groove with radial symmetry—like the outline of a mandala or pentaculum, a star, a mystic rose. No, more a tale recorded on an expanse of desert, in tracks left by countless caravans of nomads, a story of slow, millennial migrations, like those of the people of Atlantis when they left the continent of Mu and roamed, stubbornly, compactly, from Tasmania to Greenland, from Capricorn to Cancer, from Prince Edward Island to the Svalbards. The tip retraced, narrated anew in compressed time what they had done between one ice age and another, and perhaps were doing still, those couriers of die Masters. Perhaps the tip grazed Agarttha, the center of the world, as it journeyed from Samoa to Novaya Zemlya. And I sensed that a single pattern united Avalon, beyond the north wind, to the southern desert where lies the enigma of Ayers Rock.   Since you have got me interested in Eco, I will be posting more on him later. Maybe after you come back from your tour. Take pictures and put them online. Have a wonderful weeekend.  Others, see you tomorrow!

      I could see that half of the books in ur Wish list had Umberto Eco as the author. Whats so interesting in his words?  And ya friends i want to know who are ur favourite writers and what are ur favourite books.   Voracious readers like Jax, Sindhu, Valli, Kicha, Ram can post some reviews of their own on what they read recently on blog na. All r busy with tight schedules i believe.  Btw, i am going for a two day pilgrimage tour to Tanjore and Kumbakonam. I will be back on monday. Those are places rich in temples in and around the city. i think we will have a nice time, visiting and imbibing some beautiful sculptures in us.  bye for now!

      Hi,  The  urlLink final chapter  of  My Identity  was put up today morning. Unlike an exercise in egotism, it was really helpful in understanding a little bit about myself. Though I am not sure how of it is correct and how much it isn't. I really liked a few portions of the chapters. There were a couple of inconsistencies also at times.  I guess I have the rest of the month to sift through them and understand myself better. BTW, any guesses on the origin of the report.  Kicha, I'll check things out at my end (mail not being received). I had read a similar article a long time ago. It was more or less the same (I don't know it it is the same, cause the dates differ). I don't feel anything taboo about it. The article was clear and spoke about reality as it is. The more things are spoken about, more everyome gets to understand them. For example recently, Vijay had posted a mail that he received about being infected in public place with the Aids virii. People, unaware of the fact that the Aids virus cannot survive outside the human body very long, get tense and stressed. The reason is they are not properly educated on the Aids virus or on how it spreads. Likewise your article.  I was sick yesterday. Didn't come to office. And God, how boring it is to sit at home doing nothing, no TV, no computer, no books to read.  Seems the blog is becoming more philosophical nowadays. Two posts on Philosophy. Kicha's post, I got it as a forward some time ago. I don't know if it was from msitmmb or any other group. It was a stark representation of what we are today. Incidentally, from the posts during the past couple of weeks, more posts have been about questioning everyone's inner self through literature, philosophy and personal. It is good to hear that we also get to speak about quite a lot of thoughts and belief structures from everyone. Hope it continues in the future.  Bye for now,

      GEORGE CARLIN (post 9-11... his wife recently died...) (mouthy comedian of the 70's and 80's)  The paradox of our time in history is that we have taller buildings but shorter tempers, wider freeways, but narrower viewpoints. We spend more, but have less, we buy more, but enjoy less. We have bigger houses and smaller families, more conveniences, but less time. We have more degrees but less sense, more knowledge, but less judgment, more experts, yet more problems, more medicine, but less wellness.  We drink too much, smoke too much, spend too recklessly, laugh too little, drive too fast, get too angry, stay up too late, get up too tired, read too little, watch TV too much, and pray too seldom. We have multiplied our possessions, but reduced our values. We talk too much, love too seldom, and hate too often.  We've learned how to make a living, but not a life. We've added years to life not life to years. We've been all the way to the moon and back, but have trouble crossing the street to meet a new neighbor. We conquered outer space but not inner space. We've done larger things, but not better things.  We've cleaned up the air, but polluted the soul. We've conquered the atom, but not our prejudice. We write more, but learn less. We plan more, but accomplish less. We've learned to rush, but not to wait. We build more computers to hold more information, to produce more copies than ever, but we communicate less and less.  These are the times of fast foods and slow digestion, big men and small character, steep profits and shallow relationships. These are the days of two incomes but more divorce, fancier houses, but broken homes. These are days of quick trips, disposable diapers, throwaway morality, one night stands, overweight bodies, and pills that do everything from cheer, to quiet, to kill. It is a time when there is much in the showroom window and nothing in the stockroom. A time when technology can bring this letter to you, and a time when you can choose either to share this insight, or to just hit delete.  Remember, spend some time with your loved ones, because they are not going to be around forever. Remember, say a kind word to someone who looks up to you in awe, because that little person soon will grow up and leave your side. Remember, to give a warm hug to the one next to you, because that is the only treasure you can give with your heart and it doesn't cost a cent.  Remember, to say, "I love you" to your partner and your loved ones, but most of all mean it. A kiss and an embrace will mend hurt when it comes from deep inside of you. Remember to hold hands and cherish the moment for someday that person will not be there again. Give time to love, give time to speak, and give time to share the precious thoughts in your mind.  Life is not measured by the number of breaths we take, but by the moments that take our breath away.

      Friends, we all would have heard of Upanishads and vedas, but how upanishads sprung after vedic age and what it speaks about is so beautifully explained in the following article.  ************************************************************* The symbolism used in the Rig Veda prevented the deep knowledge of Veda Samhitas from becoming widespread and the age of Rig Veda came to an end. Much later attempts were made to recover the knowledge of the Vedas and this lead to the emergence of the Upanishads.The Upanishads were discovered by personages called rishis or the seers (of thought). These spiritual principles  were not created but discovered  by the rishis. These truths are the utterances of the sages on the basis of their illumined experience. These illumined experiences of the sages were not ordinary perceptions, inference or reflections, but experiences of an independent reality which impinge on their consciousness. Sri Aurobindo states:  The rishis of the Upanishads sought to recover the lost or waning knowledge of the Veda by meditation and spiritual experience and they used the text of the ancient Mantras as a prop and authority for their own intuitions and perception or else the Vedic word was a seed of thought and vision by which they recovered old truths in new forms. What they found, they expressed in other terms more intelligible to the age in which they lived. It is because the seers of the Upanishads reveal to us their pictures of the splendours of the unseen, that we are inspired to rise above the attractions and distractions of the materialistic life. These Upanishads have inspired generations of Indians with vision and strength by their spiritual power and their life-giving message. Swami Vivekananda declared: Strength, strength is what the Upanishads speak to me from every page. This is the one great thing to remember, it has been the one great lesson I have been taught in my life. Strength, it says, strength O man, be not weak. Are there no human weaknesses? Asks man. There are, says the Upanishads, but would more weakness heal them? Would you try to wash dirt with dirt? Will sin cure sin, weakness cure weakness? Ay, it is the only literature in the world where you find the word  Abhih , fearless, used again and again. In no other scripture in the world is this adjective applied either to God or man.  And the Upanishads are the great mine of strength. Therein lies the strength enough to invigorate the whole world. The whole world can be vivified, made strong, energized through them. They will call with trumpet voice upon the weak, the miserable, and the downtrodden of all races, all creeds, all sects, to stand on their feet and be free. Freedom - physical freedom, mental freedom, and spiritual freedom are the watchwords of the Upanishads.

      Thanks Ram,  I thought the page would have been corrected long ago. But now I find it has not been. I wonder how I didn't notice it this morning also. Well as you said, that's life. This shows how you cannot expect everyone to do things perfectly. At times, you've got to set things alright by yourself.  I was expecting a few posts on your Thoughts and kept checking it twice a day, but it wasn't. When will it be updated, da?  Kicha seems to have turned quite philosophical during the past few days. No Thought for the day or jokes from him. It is just a passing phase in everyone's lifetime. And it is also good for the mind. Hoping to hear a lot from you soon. BTW, anyone gone to view the match today?  Busy keeping an eye on the scorecard now. Bye.

      ram, I can't figure out what error u r trying to point.. can u elaborate...   And these days, there's a lot of literary flavour in our blog. I'm doing some reading too... but those are predominantly satirical in nature... not stories or fiction or poems but articles/write-ups ranging from comments on the bygone days to certain issues/topics of my personal interest... they are certainly helping me look at things with a "different" perspective... a down-to-earth understanding of things which are so obvious yet difficult to comprehend. This certainly is a unique experience am undergoing... and my interest towards such reading is only increasing as I read more of them... hope to share a few things with u too...

      Dear Rini,  Yeah, Rini, I went through the poem that day itself and like you, I have been trying to understand the poem. I took down a  few notes for posting later. Since you were also searching, I am posting it now. I would say that, based on my experiences,  The Waste Land  is the poetic equivalent of Eco's  Foucault's Pendulum .   As a poem, it references a wide range of works spread across varying subjects from philosophy to mythology. It is an excellent example in semiotics.  The basic method used in The Waste Land may be described as the application of the principle of complexity. The poet works in terms of surface parallelisms which in reality make ironical contrasts, and in terms of surface contrasts which in reality constitute parallelisms. -   urlLink Cleanth Brooks   Since you wanted a paraphase to the poem,  urlLink here  is the site I was referring to when reading the poem. As said earlier, I was reading a lot about semiotics the day you posted the link to the poem. Was it a coincidence that the poem was a real life example of semiotics. I don't know. If you are wondering what  semiotics  means, here is a list of definitions from  urlLink Google .   urlLink T.S. Eliot  was called one of the great poets of the 20 th  century. I hope you remember the following part of a poem of his. We shall not cease from exploration And the end of all our exploring Will be to arrive where we started And know the place for the first time. He wrote an entire book about cats. The poem was modified into a musical by Andrew Lloyd Webber and it became a wonderful success. Recently, it was shown in TV.

      Hei can u get something out of it? coz i heard that Eliot himself had to write some notes for his poem when he wrote the next version. Its language is simple but embedded with lines from German, might b french or latin and even Sanskrit too. He seems to be Erudite scholar. And without any paprphrase its really really tough to understand him i believe. Anyway i am making attempts to further bury down to the meaning behind those mystic lines!   Oh atlast tomorrow its going to end and i havent read other chapters for the past few days. Will have a look or read and then post my comments there!

Here is a small list of its practical  urlLink uses . We have used it in Angler to explain our company in a better manner. You can see it  urlLink here  and  urlLink here .   My Identity  has reached its  urlLink ninth  installment. Tommorow, I'll be posting the final installment. Kicha, you can mail the article. Don't send the link as I may not be able to access it.  Hey, it's been a long time since we heard from Sindhu. Seems to be enjoying an extended vacation at home. And Valli also, are you caught up in your course work.  I am yet to receive my  MCJ  materials. Seems like I might receive it just in time for my exams. I wonder when they might be.   BTW , I have been given an additional designation at Angler,  Project Co-ordinator  in addition to my previous designation of  Content Developer .

      jax, Your point is true. But the fact of the matter is that, there are issues which are delicate enough to be addressed like other normal issues (in an "Indian" sense).   If u r interested I'll send the link to that article to ur postmark ID. Its available in their website as well... I have quite a lot of things to say about all that is in that article. You read that and tell if I can post everything I feel about it in this blog. You'll understand, that will not be possible...!!!

Kicha, I don't think that anything is taboo in the modern day. The more people understand things, the more mature they become. If we are bound by things that are not to be spoken off, those things have no reason for existing at all.   More later.

      to jax, ok da. i ll do according u said.    Pitha Magan  i do agree what sri told. everyone acted very well.  as sri told, if u take scene by scene, that movie is really superb, in each scene everyone acted very well. if one scene vikram acted very well then in the next scene sivamainthan overtook him and at the end of that scene laila come and make her mark. so if u consider the entire film as scene by scene, sure everyone ll like it. this movie will score high marks, if it is shown in SunTV super scenes.   by this time everyone could understand what i m trying to say. yes it is. if u see it as a entire movie, then from the next time u wont go for anyother Bala's movie. Psycho paiyan, kevalama padam pannirukkan. i went to this movie on the very next day of deepavali with my sivakasi gang. this is not only our comments, this was the comment by most of the people who saw with us. everyone murmured only like that.  bcos i took my bike out of the theatre and waited for one of my friend in the roadside, one family came out of the theatre also stand nearer to me and waited for someone. everyone in that family gave similar comment like what i told, then my friend arrived there and told "dei machan oruthan intha padam supernnu solranda". then uncle(head of the nearby standing family) told "yaaruppa appadi solrathu, antha punniavanna konjam parkanumnnu sonnaru".  bala took this movie for only the five or six persons whom sri mentioned. he gave them a very good chance to act and they too did well. but if u ask what is the story??????? nothing is there? its very boring? and u cant imagine a girl like laila from a village. family girls can be bold, but they should not fight with rowdies in the road.  reg. vikram character - u can not imagine a person like him in the real life. bcos he was not born and brougt up in forest, but he behave like that.  i can appreciate only one thing, that is surya's acting and characterisation, both are good. apart from that nothing is there in the film. this is only my view, but u can consider this b4 going to that movie.  but my friend in chennai told that Pithamagan is a box office hit. so it seems more people hav Bala's view, if suppose u have Babu's(hihihiiii myself) view then dont go to that film.

      Yesterday I saw Pithamagan directed by Bala. Really superb movie.  Vickram, Suriya, Laila, Sangeetha(Rasika) lived as the concerned characters of Sittan, Sakthivel, Manju, Gomathi.   Suriya's comedy are reality fantastic. Vickram does not have a dialogue to speak. I did not see these sort of acting from Laila in her previous movies. Manobala and Karuna's comedy superb.  Illayaraja has composed heart throbbing music and background Score. Each and every credit goes to Bala only.  "Don't fail to see Pithamagan once"

      Got to read an interesting article in y'day's Times of India. But it feels sad, that I will not be able to share my views on the article nor give a link to that article. The reason is... that article is written about a societal taboo...!!! something which has a negative halo attached to its head... and I'm not sure how many would really see the other side of things. I do wonder why some things are considered to be such "bad" to even talk about, while they are nothing but a component of life...  In the recent times, things have changed a bit.. but such things are still looked upon with "disgust" and "fear" ...

      Dear Friends,  First of all my best wishes to u all for a prosperous New year 2004. Friends, I welcome all of ur decision to arrange for a get together in Madurai. The problem for me is, I have been told that the Gettogether will held in Coimbatore.  But, now I have been told it will be held in Madurai. Friends, I was on my way to Madurai yesterday(30/12/2003) and I could not go through the blog. Due to this get together, I have also cancelled my personal trip with my mother to Sivakasi on the same day(25/1/2004).   I was not given a fair chance not only in this situation, but in all the aspects of the blog. I was always seen as Hobson's choice in the blog proceedings. I am sorry to say all this, but it is the fact.  I predict the decision making in the group is fully centralized and I had not given a fair chance too.  So I voluntarily took a decision to quit from this group.  "Wish U all again Happy and Prosperous New Year 2004"  I wish all the bloggers in this group all success in all their endeavours.

      A good try, Manny. I expected this answer. But is it the right answer? There were a lot of questions that are hidden within the sentence. The first sentence reads, " Five frogs are sitting on a log. " Ok, this is a simple fact. The second statement, " Four decide to jump off. " is an ambigious statement. Are the four mentioned in the statement, a part of the five already present on the log. Or maybe there are four frogs that are ready to jump off some other log on to this log? You can never know. The same logic applies to the third statement," How many are left? "  The riddle, split up into individual sentences, makes logical sense but it does not provide any meaning. This was just a simple exercise in semantics. The phenomenon is known as intertextuality. Intertextuality, as defined by Michael Riffaterre, "depends on [a system of] limitations in our freedom of choice, of exclusions, since it is by renouncing incompatible associations within the text that we come to identify in the intertext their compatible counterparts."  Those of you who are still puzzling on what the last paragraph meant, relax. I'll provide examples after the New Year. Till then send your thoughts on how the blog looks now. It is still a work under progress. It will be gradually improved in the days to come.

Most girls can make it.. and arrangements can be made for guys.. what we are going to do there is entirely up to us...   Please let me know ur confirmation... so that arrangements can be made...

      Kicha, you had told a few points that I wanted to convey. But I wouldn't say that my year wasn't dramatic. It was largely uneventful, but a few incidents have really touched my heart.  The year began with suffering for me. I had a bout of severe cold, coupled with wheezing. To add to the mix, I was supposed to sing in the midnight mass at church. I decided to endure it through. Somehow managed to get through the first day of the year sans complications.  A few major incidents that taught me about life were the Gujarat riots, Cricket World Cup and Invasion of Iraq. Each of this incident taught me a different outlook on life.   The Gujarat Riots taught me about preciousness of human life.  urlLink This  photo is a stark reminder of its preciousness. I am not blaming anyone here but the riots are a blemish to Indian secularism. The unacceptable fact is that the perpetuators of the horrifying incidents during the dark days of the riots were people like you and me. They were not terrorists who were trained by a foreign power. They were just ordinary common people like you and me. This is what frightens me.   A terrorist is a person who believes in some ideological doctrines (whether it is right or worng is another matter). Thier policy of terrorism is summed by Lenin's words,"The purpose of terrorism is to terrorize." Simple and crisp. It is easy to understand them. But violence by ordinary people is unacceptable.   Amidst all this, India's performance in the world cup gave me great joy. Though we were beaten by Australia, I can feel proud that it took the best team in the world to beat us. Australia's performance was as expected. I think the last year has been really good for India in the sports arena, in hockey, chess, tennis, athletics...   I believe this blog also took shape during the fag days of February amidst the riots and cricket. Though a few came to know of it by the begining of March, the blog was in its incubation much earlier than that. It has provided to be a wise investment in terms of time. I guess everyone would agree to that.  The invasion of Iraq by the US and its allies was another major incident. I feel it is just an act of desperation by the US. A classic case of high school bullyism by Bush. Fortunately it did not escalate into a major war. I had mae by views on the war in several of my earlier posts. So I need not reiterate all those once more.  Other than the above mentioned incidents, there were several other small incidents that had shaped my life in 2003. I may be posting them here or in  Quod scripsi, scripsi  later.   Sri had asked last week on how the past year has been, personally and professionally. I guess this answers a few aspects of the past year.   Professionally, I can't say much. Maybe, you can read it in  Quod scripsi, scripsi  later on.   I think plans for the new year warrants another post, which will be posted later.

       Am writing this trilogy of sorts.. my views about myself in the past year and going forward.. the first one is "The year that was"  for the past year... this would be followed by two more... about the present and one about the future...   -----------  As I look upon the last 48 hrs of this year... I'm overcome by a strange avalanche of mixed feelings.. its been a year sans anything dramatic.. most of that is to do with my lazy attitude about going about my life and living.. which seems to take new turns every now and then...  This year saw some relationships become hazy and some new ones that seem more precious than anything... I got to know new people and understood some people better... and felt for doing so at times... Ignorance sure is bliss..!!  This year did teach me some new lessons on how to cope with life... and why one should not be as lazy as me... My career has steadied myself and channelled my plans and thinking to a very significant extent... I can call myself a "fresher" no more... feels happy to know I've grown up.. but that also means increased responsibilities... somtimes I wonder why do we ever grow up.. why can't we always be the cute little kids for our parents... and such childish wishes still continue.. there is still a lot of child in me...   But that has not deterred my "futuristic" thinking... I feel I have grown stronger.. but yet to have enough tests to validate that... a bit of arrogance has also creeped slowly in... I try to use this as positive as possible though... but, after all, I'm just a human being...  I become too much of a future planner at times... and try to make unnecessary "sacrifices"... may be because, I'm still learning to distiguish between some of my wants and needs...   Its been just another year in my life... the first one that I spent as a "working lad" in its entirety... with most of my time devoted to "learning the trade"...

      Travelling has always fascinated me. Being surrounded by people gives me a lot of opportunities to watch them, learn about them. Spending quite some time with your fellow passengers can be irritating as well as interesting. Your  co-passengers  fellow passengers can make or break your journey. My journey to Madurai was uneventful. On getting into the bus, I saw one of my sanguinal cousins in the bus. Ok, I have company. He said he was going home. OK, I thought, atleast I have his company for three-quarters of the way. I was wrong. He went off to sleep immediately as we crossed the city limits. The in-bus movie was horrible. I had seen it earlier. So I decided to rest. But the noise from the movie was too loud. Finally after a four and half hours and two movies later, I reached Madurai.  Reaching home, I found that everyone had left for the midnight mass. I decided to go to the mass, but it was halfway though. I could hear the clear voice of the priest reach my ears. Sitting down on the steps awaiting the arrival of relatives, I had a few mosquitoes for company. An hour and a half later, they arrived. The next few hours were spent in exchange of pleasantries and information.  Morning saw me get up and go to Christmas Mass. Came home to have Breakfast. Everyone decided to watch a movie. Watched a typical masala film, 'Winner'. By the time, the movie was over, lunch was ready. A heavy lunch followed up by another movie, "Allaudin" saw me get to late evening. Nephews wanted to burst crackers, and so we did. Got hold of a camera. Spent time shooting fireworks and crackers. Got a close look at the new moon.  After the fireworks, decide to blog it all and went in search of a internet centre. Could find one. So just went to Philo & Shantha's house to wish them. Spent some time there exchanging notes. Dei Ram, they asked me to convey thier congratulations to you. Due to a confidential agreement, I am unable to post what we discussed. Anyway it was good to spend sometime with friends again.  The next day, Boxing Day, cricket match at  MCG . Saw Sehwag hit a century before hurrying to the campus as usual by auto. The auto drivers near Fatima College have decided to have a photo of me as thier patron. I get salutes from them everytime I go to Madurai. Good to see customer care being practised by automen.  I met Kicha at Campus. spent sometime at the railway station discussing a lot of things from marriage to friends. We then went to Jayaram Bakery for Kicha's treat. Didn't eat much there. After a couple of hours, we parted on our separate ways. Spent time at home in frot of the computer, playing with nephews and chatting with cousins. Caught the evening bus to Coimbatore. Had a lovely girl, (name : Anu) sitting across the aisle.  Faded in and out of sleep watching another couple of horrible movies in the bus.  I reached home after a lonely trudge in the dark. Went to sleep immediately. These two days brought out a new vigour into my life after quite sometime. Travelling always does this. It invigorates me. I only wish I could travel a lot more.

        Just I read the onsite story which rini posted..Really it's true and I'm seeing few of the stories in day today life.Now-a-days in IT field average age for marriage is slightly increased..'coz after degree we get into IT and it will take atleast 2 or 3 years to get the next promotion or to get a onsite chance..so no one want to postpone all these... But individual has to decide on  what they really want .     I am in chennai . My mother and grandma has come down to chennai..so I am here @ my home.I may go home for pongal..That too if I have some work at that time then need to be reconsidered.     I applied for Visa this week. No immediate onsite chances since I have only 6 months experience..But just like that few of us in our account applied as per our IBU HRC's mail. Then it' s been so nice to hear from sindu after a long time..Valli I will try to meet you. Till jan 30th -There is a build for next release on that day.-I can't take leave. But try to take permission. Meet you all in the next blog..      Happy Hol's. Have Nice Time....  Cheers... Kavi

      I think, from the mid October itself contribution to the blogs from my side is comparitively less. Its not that I dont want to blog, or its not that I dont have info to share but,  its that I am in a crucial change process which may / not click although a career is assured but Where!!! is the question?. Obviously believing in the best and hoping the gr8, I made use of stealth technology in the chessboard betn 2 careers either Infy / nway @ HSS.  After MS, and deep search all ways(but not always)... finally goto into HSS on Nov 25 2k2. I started with a 3 months contract with the confirmation that I wont be confirmed thereafter, may be based on performance and mutual understanding the tenure will be extended. Fortune played in my life after 1.5 months of service: my responsibility increased, at that time I was very comfortable with clearcase (configuration mgt. tool) and a person (senior work wise) left the orgn. So I am very confident that they have to extend my tenure, they did so for another 6 mths with the confirmation that end of this period; if am doing good, I will be absorbed thereafter. After 9 months, fortune played in my life for the 2nd time, now, I am handling performance testing apart from my usual role and also supporting 2-3 projects. They came and convinced me by saying, everything is ok with me but the HR policy is something like they can take into their role only after 1 year contract period, nothing to worry, if u r maintaining the current level u r given the role etc...etc....   But, Ram Gopal cannot digest this, and on that day he applied for 3 orgn. although 2 clicked one out of which is onsite.  I didnt left coz. 1. I wanted to be in a reputed orgn. HSS is doing good, so HSS or better than that 2. I dont want stay in the role of Support engr. i.e, config. mgt, cc admin, build and release engr. I want to be a s/w engr. Testing / Develpt will do for me... as I am doing performance testing thru which I am very familiar with the test envt. and since I am handling Build activities I can walk thru code and grasp to some extent. I saw an Add for 1-3 yr. exp needed in infy. I just applied, moreover by that time its 9 months completed from my earlier attempt for Infy. I do prepared to the maximum I can. Only Kicha / Manny know this directly from me...Appeared on Nov 02 2k3 with full confident that they cant reject me... The test was bit easy. I did 5/9 puzzles. 4 should be certainly right. I was called for interview...(altogether 4 rounds) it was too.. superb... Did well. In the final round I am very much confident they will call me...the same above two persons and some more know this....but 15 days I have to wait for the result... oooh... its difficult time, anytime HSS can give me the confirmation letter, Thank God, Till Nov. 17 I didnt received my confirmation letter. by Nov 15 I have received offer mail from Infy. Immdtly I shoot the mail to my manager for my relieving letter from Nov 28 2k3 moreover my contract also ends on Nov 30. All 3 mgrs. spoke to me. Saying everything is clear from our side, You can continue as Senior operations engr. But as I said I am moving to Infy as S/w engr. and as they are aware of its value which will be better for my long term career than theirs, even though they tried to convince me... atlast left with my own will to continue wherever I wish with their wishes for me. By this time most of our classmates know the info.... But I havent published directly.  Atlast d'day came for me... and I reported in infy Dec 01 2k3, I am not very sure where they will put me, I joined as s/w engr. and I know I will be put in Unix Envt. (I like it) I was taken into Product Eng. and delvry Bsns unit. into a Cisco project... I was in trng. till date... now will be into projt. its for cisco&reg networking domain, going fine...

      Hey frenz,  Just last week I blogged u all that sify didnt award a Laptop for me to carry. Dream came true and now my Laptop is on my Lap top. Though not Wi-Fi it is as cute it normally used to be. The other news is that I am the only employee of my company in my cadre to carry one such.  Not that they gave me , to put it right I got it from them. yes I borrowed thoughts from Jack Welch and asked my boss " why not  Lap top for me?" Being the fact that I have been sanctioned a PC at my office it became much more difficult  for me to put justify my stand.  Hurray ! at the end of the day my boss gave me his Lap top and said "best Of Luck". I can write a story named "Bala in wonderland". Nothing would make u more happier than an appreciation. I have imagined carrying one after 5 years. Ok I have also kick started my other dream ' fly within India twice in a day at the cost of my company'  God stop me please! stop me please!  Dei Vijay I always have appreciated your efforts to rise up every time you fall. None is 100% in this world it is the ability of winners to rise consistently. I belive you are a winner get going da.   What Kicha, what Bala,what rini, what Manny.... ever body is trying to climb the ladder da. No body is on the top. Just press ur accelerator harder for a month and there you are over taking all of us.  Best of Luck  bala

      Rama finally decided to go against the decision of his family. Her family opposed her in going to work. Her elder sister Kowsalya said "Look Rama, ur child is only one and half year old. At the bar age of 33, will you be able to work? by staying away from your child and husband  for more than 500 Kms". Rama wholeheartedly said "I want to give my child good education, Infact my hubby's dream is also that! We want to put our child in top of the charts, we want to give him the best in the world"  Rama finally signed her appointment order. She joined as a clerical assistant in Housing development corporation India on 1st April 1977. To tell more about Rama, she was the last child of Sri.Ramasamy and Lakshmi ammal. In Hindu mythology,it is believed that the fifth girl child of any family will be a curse in the forecoming days. Rama was not an exception to that.  When she was 7, her father's printing press was ransacked. The family lost Sri.Ramasamy and also its wealth and prestige. The elder brother-in-law of Rama, has got authentication from Rama's mother from unsigned papers and become the power of attorney of the family. Rama and his brother Srinivasan, Lakshmi ammal was caught by the death trap of poverty.  The IInd brother in law is a dumb folded guy. While, the 3rd sister is about to get married. Rama's brother Srinivasan is on his way to acquire his IIIrd grade form in High school. Rama's elder brother-in-law threatened to suspend Rama's education. Lakshmi ammal, a lady of vision,  supported her children in their education by pledging her jewels.  Days passed by, Rama completed her PUC and his Brother Srinivasan got married to the Pattukottai Highness daughter Alamaermangai. Alamaermangai was brought up with a golden spoon. Rama had a additional burden to her education by washing Alamermangai clothes and assisting old Lakshmi ammal in her daily activities.  Rama completed her BA, and she registered herself in the employment exchange of Madras. Rama's brother Srinivasan became the key of Alamermangai and he started scolding Rama and old mother. Rama and her mother lived seperately following the behavioural change of Srinivasan.  The auscipious moment in Rama's life also took place. She tied her nuptial know with Parthasarthy. Parthasarthy failed in his PUC, passed his ITI and was working as a mechanic in a private company. The parenthood in Rama came by means of Sreevatsan. When Sreevatsan was one and half years old Rama took the decision to get into a job. Parthasarthy and her mother supported her decision.  Rama was first posted in Muttam a small village in Kannyakumari district. Sreevatsan stayed with Parthasarthy, since Muttam did not have the facility to support Sreevatsan in his education. Sreevatsan was longing for his mother during his childhood days. The memories of Sreevatsan struck Rama in her work. Rama came to her hometown, to meet Sreevatsan once in a month. Sreevatsan grew in the midst care of his Grandmas.   Parthasarthy and Rama, gave the best to Sreevatsan in all his academic activities. He was given best school education, good food, clothes, toys and kimps everything. When Sreevatsan was in 8th standard, Rama moved to her home town by getting transfer.  When she came to hometown, she noticed a lot of change in Sreevatsan's behaviour! Sreevatsan spoke to Rama only a little. He was happy with Parthasarathy and his Grandmas.   Rama could not accept the change in Sreevatsan. Parthasarathy assured her that things will be smooth in the fore-coming days. But everything went topsy-turvy for Rama in Sreevatsan's case.   Days passed by, Sreevatsan completed his studies in IIT Rourkee, and he was appointed as Quality Control Engineer in HAL, Bangalore. He loved and married Ambika, who was his collegemate in IIT Rourkee. Ambika got selected as Maintenance Engineer in BHEL, Trichy. Ambika decided to stick to the job. But Rama opposed their decision. When Sreevatsan questioned her she said "Son I was the victim of my son's love , But you 2 don't be a victim of your lovehoods"  Has Rama taken the Right decision?  Is her case applicable in today's reality?

      Hi all,  Merry Christmas Xavier....Hope you see this blog before friday.....  Sorry for not answering your questions.....Finally my exams are over, & i'm working from home this week....  To anwser Xavier's & Kavitha's questions: I'm starting on Jan 11th.....My last leg is from Germany to Chennai & the flight's arrival time is, 13th, January, 12.00 A.M.....Kavi, I'll be there in Chennai for the next 13 hrs....My train to Karaikudi, is at 1.00 P.M on Jan 13th... But i would have to visit Chennai atleast three times, i guess....though the dates are not decided....  Had i got my tickets in British airways, I would have met Sindhu....unfortunately, could find a convinient one, only in Lufthansa!!  Congrats Kicha......Keep Going man....You still have lots in store......  My boss gave me a gift for Christmas!!!.....A cool hand-knitted colorful woolen scarf.....The gift itself was wonderful & getting it from her, was even more joyful....  Yeah, so what do you guys think abt the get-together...Does that sound feasible?....If you feel it's feasible, please do e-mail Kicha, so that we could finalize our venue.   That copyright issue.....was indeed an experience!!!....we have had lots of inputs about copyrights......Mahendran kalagam nanmayil mudindhadhu!!!  The book review was great Vijay Babu.....

      Hello guys,  Thats a absolutely amazing Kishore...congrats!...maintain the same temto thru out. Keep going Vijay Babu...will post mine in the near future.  The blog on onsite tempted me so much that i decided to deviate from my usual course...so here iam blogging! To be honest the whole of last month i was torn between my career and personal life...life being highly uncertain...we dont know whats in store for us after 3 months...continue in UK, back to India or in a different country?   Kishore questioned the decision of the couple to stay together in onsite...have they got any other choice?...i can quote instances where people got fired for declining onsite assignments..its no jolly ride for career oriented people to live in onsite.The barriers are too many that i really go crazy at times....cannot apply to goods jobs in top companies as they do not entertain applications from non UK and EU nationals...cannot get into any contract employment..if we end up in a different country or India and if at all i manage to get into a job will the stay be long enough for me to settle in a decent job...to top it cannot plan any vacation to India without concerns..in total my career is in a total disarray...the only thing I am clear about is I am not going to compromise my family life at any cost!   Hey Ranjini..nan oru thara blog panna 100 times panna mathiri...so treat kuduthudu. Xavier your gift is on its way....ni ketta sundal!...here the xmas fever has reached to a height that people are going crazy...never seen so many hanging out in the streets after 8 in the evening...came across a dozen santa claus..dont think we'll have a white xmas but hoping one for new year...Merry Christmas.  We are visiting Leeds and Manchester during the weenend....  Bye

      Hi everyone,  I really feel bad for not participating in the blog. But 2 things are keeping me stay away from the blog, 1. Patni is not providing me internet during working hrs (9am to 6pm). 2. The content of the blog is threatening me. Most of the blog members are sending their book reviews and discussing some technical and managerial topics, which I hardly know.  I can overcome that first block by either ask kicha to send me the blog content or by browse in cyber cafe. But I don’t know how I m going to overcome that second block. Whenever I read your blogs (mahendran, ranjini, xavier, bala, rajesh, ganesh, valli, sindhu, kavitha, sri, ram), I always ask myself that when I am going to post a blog like this??? But my inner mind says never. Then I again ask, hey u r a confident person, how can u say like this? Suddenly a reply comes like, if only u really know something, u can be confident in that thing.  But the argument with my mind didn’t ends there; i tried to convince it by said that i also read two books recently named "One minute manager" and "Who moved my cheese". May be i took six days to read such a small books, but still for the first time in the past 24 years i completely read an English book. I may not be able to give a good review on it, but still i can mention some points from them.  One-Minute Manager ------------------ It is a very small guide, which speaks about, 1. One minute goal setting 2. One minute praising and 3. One minute reprimand  The first two points we heard many a times from many people. But the third point is the special one. It talks about how the manager has to react when he is not happy with his subordinates work. Like praising, whenever a subordinate commit a mistake, express him at that point itself and make him understand that u r only unhappy with his work and not unhappy with him as the person.  I recommend this book for all our blog members, who haven’t read it earlier.  Who moved my cheese ------------------ Hope almost everyone read that book, or at least heard about that book. This book is about change management. I think we learn a lot about change management than it is mentioned in that book. But the presentation of that book is good. They tried to explain it using interesting characters. It falls into “Needhi kadhikal”(if you read siruvarmalar from dinamalar then u know it) category. So I strongly recommend it to kids in your home.  While reading this book, I came across the phrase “Better late than never”. Whenever I come across this phase one incident suddenly come into my mind. During our first trimester, one day infront of our library myself, kicha, valli and sindhu met balaji. He asked as about our welcome party. He told us why don’t you give pressure to your seniors to arrange it soon, it seems they are going on postponing it. For that except me all others replied something. While kicha replying, he told that “Better late than never”. I heard that for the first time. So always this sweet memory is attached to that phrase.   After completing this write-up, my mind slowly begins to say; yes you can also contribute something to this blog. Thank God at last I convinced it. ------------------------ congrats for ranjini, ram and kicha.   Mahendran:- eppadi da irukka. Sorry da I cant send mails to yahoo, rediff, and hotmail ids. That’s y I havnt send any mails. Pls send me ur official id, I can only send mails to that id.  If anyone want to send mail to me, pls send it to the id, vijaybabu.balasubramanian@patni.com (don’t send from any mailing sites, I wont receive it. Send it from ur corporate id) ------------------------  I have to really thank our classmates, especially our blog members. For what???  Soon I will post it.

      Kicha, Nice link. On reading it, two quotations came to my mind.    Fortes Fortuna adjuvat. - Fortune favours the brave   Chance favours the prepared mind - Louis Pastuer    Both statements can be considered an addendum to the article.   BTW. Who was the first president of the United States of America? George Washington. Nope. Read  urlLink this  to know more.

      jax, I'll be leaving tomorrow night and be in Madurai on 25th morning.. But I'll be going to meet one kozhi.. whom I have caught for giving me a christmas treat at his home... He was my roommate when I had training in Mangalore... after the treat I don't have any more kozhis.. so may be, we'll try to meet that evening...   The thing that jax was mentioning as the one me and valli were discussing is about a get-together... we are planning to have one somewhere.. and the dates will be Jan 25,26 ... the place is yet to be decided... so, if u can make it on that day please let me know.. bring in ur suggestions on where we can have it as well...  only constraint is it must be relatively easy to reach for most people... depending on the number of people other required arrangements will be made...  jax, send me ur mdu phone number.. i'll call u after I reach home on Christmas day...

      Ranjini, the problem (the blog is displayed without any styles) appears the first time you open the blog for the very first time. Once you choose your favorite style, a cookie will be set in your computer so that you get the same style the next time.  Incidentally, Mozilla based browsers are the only browsers where style switiching is enabled in the browser. Under the  View  menu, you can see a  Use Style  menu item. If you select it, you will be presented  with a pop-up detailing all the styles that page links to. You can choose any one.   The reason why a separate style switcher is provided with the blog is for those who use Internet Explorer, which does not have an inbuilt style switcher &aacute; la Mozilla. At first I left out the Style Switcher in the blog, but since IE users cannot select style sheets, I had to search for and modify the style switcher to use it.   So it is not my fault. I feel that instead of  urlLink Mozilla , you should use  urlLink Mozilla Firebird . Firebird is faster, smaller and flexible than Mozilla or Internet Explorer.  The reason why the blog is loaded with the Black stylesheet is because I set the blog to consider that stylesheet to be the default one. After loading, you can choose any style that you want to.   Kicha: Congratulations. And when do I see you in Madurai? I am leaving tomorrow evening and will be spending the 25 th  and the 26 th  there. I'll collect my treat there.   Manny: I was online when you posted your poem. But due to a problem in my system, I was unable to log into Blogger and give you my comments. It was interesting to read the success poem. I felt some tinges of "Man in the Mirror" in the poem. Inspiration!!. Hope to see more from you.  Valli: No reply from you regarding your visit or the one Kicha and you were discussing?  Bala: Unnaku, Wi-fi vennumma. Modhalau hard diskilla irrukura paddatheyyum, Rajesh oda mp3'sa delete pannu. Appuram floppy, hard disk ellam ollunga work pannum.  Sindu: How's Christmas season there? Tell me about it.  Ram: Mentations!!??!!  Rini: Don't know why it bounced. I'll see what to do then. By the way, I see two lines appearing in the centre of " urlLink Flowers for you! ". Does it appear on yours? I'll try to send a screenshot if possible.  There are quite a lot of Indian blogs in the blogosphere. The blogroll links to a few of them. I feel that Indian blogs are not much publicised. But there are quite a lot of blogs being written by Indians. the trouble is that we don't know them.   Interestingly, " urlLink Elite Essays " had an article about one of my favourite novels,  Pride and Prejudice .   I guess I haven't given any book reviews for the past two weeks. I'll have them ready soon.  Sri:  Prof. Raja Govidaswamy's words is one reason why I still keep reading. Anyway my line of work requires it. As Valli had once said, reading has now moved from being just a hobby to a part of my job.   See you all later.

      Hi all,  Good day to you!!  It is always a tough competition between my floppy and the system at office. As I dont get enough time reading and replying blog I just deploy floppy to transfer docs from office to home. when my brain starts working my floppy does not and when my floppy starts working  I dont  get time. When everything is fine, sad that I travel outside coimbatore. Let me get a wi-fi Latptop soon.   So I thought If not today then it is going to be never. Rini that was a faux pas. yes it was the cost and not the price that I referred. When the cost goes up, adding to that my production units are fixed, naturally my quality comes down. Hope u would appreciate.  Kicha sorry da once again my floppy didnt work. Bear with me dears because I am a sales guy, will not get enough time to sit and type.  chottu  Try to work smart; the day u feel u cant, start working hard.  good luck frenz

      Rini, Looking at the photos, I got a thought rolling in my head. The groups photo album, right now is divied into three directories:   2003  Memories  Wedding Snaps  The classifications seems good and based on functionality. (This is Xavier, the Information Architect speaking.)So what are a few wedding snaps doing in   2003 . They should be within  Wedding Snaps . Since 2003 is almost over, snaps being uploaded in 2004, must be put in 2004.  I have made the necessary changes. Photos of weddings (including engagements) are now present in the  Wedding Snaps  album. Hope you don't mind it.  BTW: In case you didn't know, ROASM is updated everyday. Rini, as you had requested, it is now present in the blogroll.

      ya i did think of taking leave, but then dint want to waste my leaves, and on top of it, its LOP.. So thought let me come to office late than not to come at all. Yes kicha, its a valid point that, they ultimately decided to stay ON-SITE in the end too.....

      The focus of the story makes one thing clear about the couple.. they want to row two boats with a single oar...   And the simple reply is, they are not going to do it.. There must be some point in time where a line needs to be drawn between family and career... Vivek and Shobana did have a number of ways to handle the situation. But they kept considering that an onsite opportunity is the "holy grail" that needs to be obeyed irrespective of family circumstances... which should not have been their attitude...  Even at the close of the story, they decide it the hard way to stay "onsite"...   This just needs a little thinking in the lines of their common goals... and the steps they need to take to support each other to achieve their individual ambitions too... And, what it requires is mutual understanding and proper prioritization of their life's activities...

      Rini, Seems to be a very tough problem to figure out. BUt that's life for you.  So the moral of the story: If you are in IT, don't marry someone in IT. Is that it?  BTW, Ram said you were on leave today. Couldn't resist blogging or is he mistaken?

      A Story about Onsites!  One fine day, Vivek's PL Bhatia asks him whether he has any time for a small meeting. Vivek obviously has time and so the two go to a conference room.  Bhatia then clears his throat and says "Vivek, there is an on-site requirement. It is in Covina, Los Angeles. It is for six months. I can suggest your name. Do you have any problems?"  Vivek cannot believe his ears. Of course why should any one have problems going to the Sam land. "Of course no Bhatia.. I have no problems." he says.  Bhatia looks at him very kindly and says "You better draw up your personal plans with your wife and let me know in a day or two" That's when Vivek remembers that he has a wife.  Then it strikes him that there is a himalayan problem in front of him.  Shobana is working. She is in the middle of a project in which she is a moduleleader. She cannot leave it all and come to Covina with Vivek. On the otherhand it will be cruel on Vivek's part to leave her here and go to Covina for more than half a year. Moreover, they have just been married.  Vivek can stay back. But one day he has to go.. He cannot stay back in India indefinitely. Project requirements are too demanding. Shobana can resign and accompany Vivek. But what is the guarantee that she would find such a nice job in such a nice company after they come back from Covina?  So Shobana and Vivek discuss this issue. They reluctantly agree to get separated for six months. Vivek hugs Shobana in the airport and says "I will be BACK" in a typical Arnold Scharzegger tone and then boards Delta Airways leaving Shobana in tears.  In Covina Vivek gets lots of work and his stay gets extended by two more months. The days and months move very slowly. Vivek starts counting even minutes. During this period, Shobana's PL Ashish Mehta calls her one day and asks her whether she has any time for a small meeting. Shobana wonders what that meeting is.. They go to the conference room and Mehta tells her  about a great on-site requirement in Berlin, Germany for their customer.  "It is for six months and you are most suited person for this. I am going to suggest your name. Do you have any problems?" Mehta asks her. Shobana gets excited.. Berlin!  She has never been out of India. So she instantly nods her head. Mehta then smiles and says "Okay discuss with your hubby and let me know in a day or two"  That's when Shobana gets the gravity of the situation. It will be two months before Vivek can come home..... By the time Shobana will have left to Berlin for six months. Shobana cannot decline this as this is an important assignment.  That night Vivek spends hundred dollars on telephone to discuss this matter with Shobana. Finally they decide to go ahead. Shobana breaks down in the phone and Vivek breaks down thinking about his phone bill. And then Shobana leaves to Berlin.  One month after that,Vivek comes back to India. Then Shobana calls him almost everyday and they discuss about all petty things on the phone. Shobana applies for a loan to clear her telephone bills. Vivek gets into a new project which is not yet started. His PL Prateek Ray calls him one day and says that he has to go to Toledo Ohio for the requirement analysis of that project. Vivek frantically says no. Shobana is arriving next month. He doesn't want to miss her. But Ray assures him that the work is only for one month and that he would be back before Shobana comes to India. Thus Vivek flies to Toledo Ohio and gets into the requirement analysis of the new project. That's when he comes to know how difficult it is to retrieve information from the users. You can design a system the user wants only when the user knows what he wants. Vivek gets baffled by the questions his users put.. "Do you think I need those fields "GMG_TYPE_HJHJ_TW" and "Auto_level_ind"? What are they by the way?"  The requirements analysis stage continues for three full months at this pace. Shobana comes to India one month after that. And she tells her PL that she doesn't want anymore on-site assignments. "I understand" says Mehta and she desperately waits for Vivek to come back to India. It has already been two months over a year since they last met.  Vivek then gets the role of an on-site co-ordinator for this customer. He calls Shobana that night and they really don't know what to do. Shobana offers to resign her job and join him in Toledo. But she is getting 21 grand per month in India and Vivek doesn't want to lose that. "Two more months Shobana and I promise I will be back"  Shobana retorts back, "There is no solution for this problem." Vivek gets surprised. "What are you talking about?" he asks her.Shobana fights back her tears. "As long as I am in this co. I will be getting a lot of on-site opportunities. Even if I decline all of them, what about you? You also work for a software company and there you need to go abroad almost once every quarter. I cannot accompany you as you don't want me to resign my job here. Does that mean we have to stay like this forever?  Vivek! I love you and I don't know how I spent fifteen months without even seeing you once. I may not recognize you also if you come in front of me now...  Tell me Vivek, is there a solution for this problem?"  Vivek doesn't speak anything for a moment. He then realizes the truth in her sentences. It is a neverending problem. But what about the 20 grand she is getting per month?  "Vivek, is money everything? Can't we comfortably live with what you are getting? Please Vivek, try to understand the situation" Shobana breaks down. Vivek is still undecided. He married a software engineer with a hope that with two incomes he would have a good deal of money to plan their future.  "Let us face the reality, Vivek" Shobana says, "How much are you paying for the phone calls now? More than 20 grand per month. If I am with you there will your phone bill be so astronomical? Just tell me one thing.  Won't you be happy having me there with you?" Shobana slowly turns hysterical.  Vivek gets into the crux of the situation. It is true. He has been spending around 600 to 700 dollars per month on India calls... that is far more than what Shobana is getting then. He thinks and thinks.. for two days he does nothing else but thinking. Finally he decides that he should have Shobana with him all the time from then onwards at any cost.  Shobana gladly prepares the resignation letter and submits it. Her PL smiles and says "You've made the right decision Shobana.. Congratulations for the bold step. I understand your problems. Anyway! you have a three months notice period here, right? We have a one month assignment in Singapore..."  Heard that this is a true story!

      Hi Sindu, Seems you are visiting us after a very long time. I think the only job you can get during the Christmas season is  "Pottallam Madikirathu". Go to any shop and apply for a shop assistant work. It's going to be a lot more fun till January. As the Christmas season extend till the 12th day after Christmas.  Though I have not given any gifts to others till now, I am always ready to accept gifts. Please send your gifts to my home address. You can get it from Yahoo Groups!.   Since a few of you might not be available at Bangalore, I guess it's Madurai for this Christmas. Don;t know whether to take a holiday on 24th or 26th. Have to decide. What about you Rini,, Coming Home?  BTW, Could someone call up Kurinji and convey him my Birthday wishes today.  Valli, hello, where are you? When will you be in India?   Bye for now.

      Hi  Looks like Xavier is getting the international attention..and the credit going to 'ha ha ha' Mahendran! I too would recommend Rini's suggestion.   I think we should also be wary of publishing any information that is internal to a company. Azim's letter is purely internal and confidential.  There is not much progress in my job hunting process..have too many restrictions in terms of location and commutation. Adding to it is the winter weather and peak christmas season. Everyone busy in shopping and fetching gifts for their loved ones.   I am just gearing up for the long weekend. Xavier do you give any christmas gifts?    Hey Ram and Rini....congrats...mariyadaiya nan India varrappa treat vattiyoda kuduthudunga!

But I'm going home as one would expect... after a pretty long interval by my standards... and I'll enjoy a christmas treat from my friend who was my roomie in Mangalore at the time of my infy training...!!  And to top the icing, we have holiday on Dec 26th to enjoy a long weekend and will be compensating that by working this saturday...

      This Christmas seems to be a bit dull. I'm missing the excitement and the joy associated with the season. I'm thinking of spending it  outside Coimbatore. One choice is Madurai. But even there I feel that I cannot really enjoy it. Chennai seems another place, But I don't know what I can do in Chennai  for two days. Bangalore is another option. Lots of places to see. Hey you Bangaloreans, Anyone working on Christmas?

        Hi all,  wrt the copyright issue... I read that poem in the Living with Honour book and I felt impressed with that and I reproduced the same without any alteration to a single word of it except the title... Thats all...  and Jax I leave the ball in ur court and u can delete or place a link or do what so ever to freeze it up...  rini, coming to the girl in my dream, there is an inspiration which made me write this small (poem like one...ha ha).  When we were in the hostel, we (me, rajesh, sandil, ram and others) used to write kavithais in english translating the tamil songs...you might be remembering the one kavithai..."I had a girl friend...I had a girl friend..." ( A translation of the "enakkoru snehidhi..." song in priyamaanavale film...) It was a fun time to read all those and yesterday i was hearing the same song in my system and thought of all those that happenend in hostel...  Just thought of doing the same...but somehow a gal who inspired me came in the picture...(whose face yet to be seen by me...ha ha)...  That resulted in this outcome of my thoughts...but for that, I have to find my girl who came in my dream...ha ha.

      Good to see that everyone understands copyright issues. Kicha made a valid point in saying that "It takes to be the owner of an IPR to feel the pain when someone infringes that." Really, I would be annoyed to read a story that I had written attributed to someone else or if it has been modified.   This has been a reason why I had said we could not simply copy and paste from a website. I know sometimes, you may feel that you want the article to be present so that we can understand it more. But if an article can be found on the net, it would be better if you can just provide a link to it. The least thing we can do is atleast acknowledge the rights the author has.   Kicha had rightly pointed out that we often take IPRs for granted. That time has ended. Companies have started /starting to have IPR policies in place. Clients too have started to understand the importance and are now demanding the same. As most of us work for s/w companies, our understanding of Intellectual Property has to be higher than when we were just students. Though it is not enforced properly in our country, plaigarism in college can get you suspended. All universities abroad view plaigarism as a serious crime.   This doesn't mean that you cannot quote anybody without permissions. It means that if you can explain an article in your own words, you can do so and provide a link to the original article quoting its source. For example,  The Hindustan Times today reported that Infosys has acquired an Australian IT firm, Enterprise Information Services for 23 million USD. Read the  urlLink article  on Hindustan Times... Here I am not breaking any copyright laws, I am just linking to an article in a newspaper that is available freely to all netizens. The trouble is when we get articles through mails like  Daddy's Day , we do not know who the author was (till now). It is a good idea that Cheryl suggested, Type a few lines of the poem in Google within quotes, you'll get results (with a little patience). It is better to spend a few more minutes online than be stuck with a copyright infringemetn case.   BTW, I had mentioned this quite some long time ago about using images. It is also not an ethical practice. When you display an image in a webpage, every time that page gets loaded, the browser tries to display the image from its original location, which might on somebody's server. This uses up the bandwidth of that person. So someone else has to pay for displaying the image in your webpage. It is a bad practice. So when ever you want to display an image, you can link to the picture through text links.  There is a wonderful way available on the Internet to share content. It is called  urlLink Creative Commons . Have a look at this site and the ideas they wanted to share.    Update : Before I could post, Kicha had posted the news suing the same method I was about to explain.   Meanwhile, Manny, it is your call. Shall we credit the author of the poem (Daddy's Day) properly or remove it and give a link nstead (Rini's suggestion)? You can also put your name under the poem you posted, so that you can slam a copyright infringement case on some poor soul.  BTW: Please close the HTML tags you use properly.  Now someone has forgot to close an italics tag. Everything is in italics now.

        yes...It was from the book Living with Honour and I suggest blog father to do the needful to fix this issue... BTW here is some which will not bring any copyright issues for sure...'coz this was written by me....he he he..." ok then c u all in my next blog...       It's between a dawn and a dusk, My head on my desk, Dead are my mind, But the work I should mind... Though I tend to work, My lids tend to sleep.  A girl in my dream, One from the cream. A dream that's so rare, which wasn't a nightmare.  She passed by me, And made my self freeze, Had no doubt in me, She was a passing breeze.  She looked at me, I looked at her, Stunned at once, seeing each other.  Its that moment, when she passed by me, Its her face That went into my heart's base.  With a will in my day, I walked through the bend On her way till the bay, to see a face... that's filled with gay.  As I rushed so fast, I left her go my past. In a dream not so bright, Amidst the dim dull light, When I turned to my right, It was the same face so bright.  The moment I cherished, When my dream now got perished. In my damn dumb terminal, Again a day full of work. Let me wait for a dusk, till my head is again on my desk.... to see that girl in my dream who's one from the cream...         Mahendran Jayavel

      The mail from Cheryl does give us all a knock on our heads. I suggest, we add the required information and retain just "a link" to that beautiful poem, with due credits to the author.   I do want to bring upon another vital point. Very often, we do things so unkowingly that we may be doing a grave legal mistake... We frequently need to get content from google for a lot of our personal/official purposes, but how often have we worried about IPRs... It takes to be the owner of an IPR to feel the pain when someone infringes that... As "friends" we do have the habit of sharing some information from/about our organizations without giving a second thought to the IPRs and piracy.   So, please take some time to learn about these aspects. Googling would surely aid u in this... Let me tell u some facts I'm aware of. ..   1. Can the material available on the Internet be copied?  Free content available on the Internet can be copied for "personal use" only... This means, if you want to share some information available on the Internet, then you can only give a link to the place where it actually exists... You are not allowed to copy it and transmit it to any group of people...   2. Can the material available on the Internet (or other publications) be used as a reference material ?   Borrowing segments of content from a source as is does constitute a violation in most cases... though many websites permit this form of "violation" as long as two conditions are fulfilled: The user indicates the source of the original content along with the terms and conditions of use as prescribed by the original creator and No modifications are made on the borrowed content...  For more on this, visit the  urlLink Indian IPR Law .   Please make sure you follow the IPR guidelines at every possible instance.

      anyway it wont cost us much to do the changes he had suggested. So i dont find any difficulty in doing that, but then if some one else claims to be like what cheryl demands now, then it surely becomes a problem. Lets try to adopt what he says in our forth coming blogs and as such, lets remove the poem (since its read by everyone) and instead lets provide a link to the original poem in that place!. I dont think, we will be infringing any copy rights if we provide a link to the poem..  BTW ram, y rnt you making much updates to your mentations?  The latest blog which u had posted cliked some words in me, which i recalled today, " If you are busy thinking what others are thinking about you, they are busy thinking, what you are thinking about them". What do you think about these words ya?  In blogrolling section jax, why dont u provide a link to ROASM too, which will help us to navigate quickly b/w blogs.

      Hi everyone,   I got a mail today for copyright infringement. I am reproducing the mail below for your understanding.   Someone has illegally altered my copyrighted and published poem "Daddy's Day" which you are displaying on your site at:   urlLink http://dayswork.blogspot.com/2003_11_23_dayswork_archive.html  You have the title as "On a Daddy's Day".      "Daddy's Day" was first published in the year 2000 in the book "Chicken Soup for the Parent's Soul".  It was later published in the earlier part of 2001 in the book "Stories for a Teen's Heart 2".  Because of those publications my poem ended up on the Internet and due to so many sites either displaying or circulating my poem without including my name, several have either plagiarized my poem or altered it, either by changing the title or adding lines pertaining to 9/11.  As you'll note by the 2000 publication and copyright date of my poem, it was published before the 9/11, 2001 tragedy.  The lines You see he was a fireman and died just this past year when airplanes hit the towers and made the meaning of freedom very clear do not belong in my poem.  Someone took a national tragedy to infringe upon my copyright and in turn to break the law.  A tell/tell sign that you are displaying the altered version of "Daddy's Day" usually starts with the first line.  The line should read Her hair up in a ponytail and not Her hair was up in a ponytail.  The word "was" does not belong in my poem.     You are more than welcome to continue displaying my poem, but only if you do the following . . . use the correct title, which is "Daddy's Day", as well as the correct version, which would exclude the 9/11 lines and the word "was" in the opening line.  Include the copyright date, which is 2000, add my name, Cheryl Costello-Forshey as the author.  Also, you need to include the line, Cannot be copied or reproduced in any form without the written consent of the author.  Furthermore, I ask that you mention that "Daddy's Day" has been published in the books "Chicken Soup for the Parent's Soul" and "Stories for a Teen's Heart 2".  I realize that it seems like a lot to ask, but I'm sure you can understand why I'm asking.  If you don't wish to do as I've requested then you will need to remove my poem from your site, otherwise, you are infringing on my copyright.  By law, a person must exhaust all efforts (and prove that they have) in order to find the author of something before they can legally use it in any manner, otherwise, they are infringing upon that writer's copyright, which is against the law.  Most people are not aware of that.         As a personal favor I'd like to ask that you never display or circulate any material without knowing and including the author's name.  So many writers are having their copyright infringed upon due to the Internet.  There is a simple solution to finding the author of any material that you are hoping to display their work.  Simply type a line, any line, from the story/poem within quotation marks into the google.com search engine and within seconds you should be able to find the author's name.  Of course it may take a little bit more work than that, but in my case you would have found me within four seconds.  If you don't know the author's name, please do not display the work because it leaves the door wide open to plagiarists.  It's better to be a part of the solution for writers rather than part of the problem.   Please contact me once you've made the changes.  The longer my poem remains on your site without making those changes, the more damage that is caused for me.  Warmly, Cheryl   So what do we do? I feel we should respect the copyright and do either one of the two options available:    Use the correct poem with due attributions and changes   Remove it completely    I am awaiting your thoughts on this. I particularly liked the penultimate paragraph in the mail where it speaks about avoiding copyright infringement.   BTW, Vijay how was yesterday? My belated wishes to you, da. NO posts from you. Mumbai girsl keeping you busy?

      Looking back at India's victory, it really feels good to win a test match abroad. Watching Dravid score the winning runs broughts out hurrahs from everyone watching. But it is still a paradox that we have to consider. We can go about boasting that we have won a test match in Australia. But we have to remmeber that they had won in India too the last time we met. Except for the heroics of Laxman and Dravid, we would have lost the series too.   I expect Australia to come back with vengenace. I know they will. But as Kicha had said, they may have a minor worry of the loss rankling in thier mind. But with Brett Lee coming back to third test and McGrath for the final test, I feel that we might have to raise our levels much higher. And I have seen no other teamin the world that has raised the bars of performance higher thatn Australia. The last World Cup was a small example. After trying hard to reach the performance levels of the Aussies, we had managed to claw back into the final, but they had raised thier game to a much higher level on the day it mattered.   With almost ten days before the two teams met again, it is to be seen how we put back the victory behind us and look at the games ahead us. Incidentally, we have nothing to lose. Even if we manage to draw the remaining matches, it will be termed a success by all. But I would call it a success only when we manage to win the tri-series after the test matches. They will be a very big challenge for our players, both physically and mentally. The true champion would be the team that manages to stay on its feet at the end. I believe the Americans term it "the last man standing". Will it be us?

      As we celebrate a hundred years of flight today, I wish to share my experience. I can hear a plane preparing to deposit its load of passengers and take to the skies again. Mankind has always been satisfied about flying. It must be because we have no way to lift our bodies off the ground. This deepest desire to take to the skies is well reflected in all mythologies. Almost every religion on earth has a figure who could fly. You can find that almost all superheroes  in  modern day fiction have an ability to fly, either on ther own or through devices. I don't know about girls, but I know every boy's fondest ambition in his childhood would have been to be a pilot. I had it too.  Fascinated by planes, I recall reading a lot of books on flying and planes. I used to tear off pages from notebooks to make planes. I would then go to the top floor and let go of these paper machines. As our house lay adjoining a cemetery, it was pretty much an open space. I was so much into planes that I did not use written and used paper. All my planes were of the purest paper, cut with precision and folded with care. I had drawings of various paper plane models. I learnt the laws of aerodynamics, thermal drifts and properties of paper in my quest to make the perfect paper plane. People say try and try again. I did, meeting failure on several occasions and learning from them. I now can make the perfect paper plane. But it will not fly.  The course of my various experimentations has allowed me to understand the laws of physics well. I knew what goes up must come down. The trick was to slow down that law of Newton. I learnt about ballasts.  I designed planes that could fly for a few metres in a straight line and then plummet down to the ground head first. I called them missiles or suicide bombers. I learnt about aerodynamics. I then made planes that would land gracefully like a swan. Modelled on the now grounded Concorde, these planes could land perfectly.   Fighter aircraft are a complex piece of machinery, but extremely maneouverable. I wanted to make a plane that would be as maneouverable as a fighter jet. Trials after trials, reams and reams of wasted paper finally gave birth to a plane that could fly and turn as smooth as a fighter planes. I realized that a simple cuts in paper could be folded and they could act as rudders or aerofoils. I could make a plane move in what ever way I wanted by simply adjusting these small flaps. I could make it glide in circles in both clockwise and anticlockwise directions. I could make them rise high and swoop down like an eagle in pursuit of its prey. Aileron rolls were a breeze. 180 degree turns were hard, but after innumberable tries I got it right.   After all these years, I still wonder why I didn't pursue it as a career. Maybe some things were just meant not to be.

      India had traditionally been known to be vulnerable away from home, with a bowling which lacked enough punch to take 20 wickets in a test and batsmen who awkwardly revolved around repeated gutsy knocks by Tendulkar and played second fiddle to him... When India toured Australia in 1999-2000, the commentators at Channel Nine (Bill Lawry, Tony Greig et. al.) named the Indian team "Tendulkar Ganguly"... as these were the only 2 players who withstood the ravaging pigeon called McGrath and the wizardry of Warne...   Come 2003, and things seemed hardly changed. This was despite a team which showed its class with a record breaking win against England in the Natwest Series, followed that up with Test victories against West Indies, Sri Lanka, Zimbabwe and England away from home, and reaching the finals of cricket's biggest event... and helping such onlookers was India's below par performance at home against New Zealand and Australia earlier this year.   They were written off even before the series started... and the warm-up games didn't help their cause either... After all, what could a bunch of men who thrived on slow low tracks at home have done to the might of the Aussies at their own backyard...   But for once, the answer was different. Rahul Dravid did what the flamboyant Laras and meticulous Kallis'es could not do... A puny Agarkar accomplished what the prodigious Wasim Akrams and the giant Donalds could not accomplish.. After Melbourne, February 1981, the newspapers would again read a similar headline.. only that,  this time its Adelaide.  When the world least expected, India handed over the Aussies the unique distinction of being the first side in 110 years to lose a Test match after scoring 500+ in the first innings...   Hats off to John Wright, who started his coaching career with a sedate test series against Sri Lanka and went on to stop Australia's 17-test winning streak in India and has peaked by questioning the Aussie domination at their own backyward. Saurav Ganguly, deserves praise for the way he has handled this team after taking over the mantle from Tendulkar. His courage and leadership qualities make him stand-out as one of India's finest captains.   One could perceive an over-confident arrogance in the Aussie camp when they came out to start every inning. But looking back, they would only be licking their wounds hoping to salvage some of the lost pride at home... India may not go on to win the next 2 matches, but this victory is enough to give the Aussies a few sleepless nights lamenting on what could have been... and reinstate the rightful place of this Indian team in world cricket...!!

      Being sick isn't fun. And working while sick isn't much joy either. I was and still am sick for the past couple of days. I guess it is just my body fighting back for the rest it badly requires. No time for rest also.   Reading through the blogs over the past week has brought joy to see atleast one discussion going on, though frankly I didn't understand a single word of it or why I should rejoice or wince at the appearance of my name as an example in the discussion. At the end of it  can  some one tell me whether I am a multimillionaire or not. I would like to donate a few millions to the upkepp of Bala in a special institution.  Since he is worn out by his struggles to make other millionaires. As our recent political dramas have revealed, he again need not worry over Rajesh's political fortunes. He can make money in a political party without being its leader.   As I had said, I am going home now to take some rest / read. See you all tomorrow. It was good to see India win comphrehensively, though there were moments towards the end when a couple of wickets went in quick succession. Got to see how the next test on Boxing Day will turn out to be.  Sri, If possible, I'll deliver your book in the evening.

      That was an etymologically challenging article by Bala. As I think on the crux of the issue, it seems to be either going for   "more produce - less quality - less price - more consumers"  or  "less produce - more quality - high price - less consumers"  I guess, there is not too much to choose between the two at first-shot. There are a lot of market driven forces that need to be taken into account as well... Xavier starts to sell the t-shirt for INR 50, without much investment in marketing and brand building, but I have a few more questions to ask.  1. Is he the first one in the business..? If so, well and good... but probably there are roughly atleast 5 other vendors who might price t-shirts as much as Xavier and are thinking of similar strategies as him. And some vendor's additional cash reserves might enable him to invest in building a brand even though it may be a small investment, and it might have the capability to impact xavier's sales.  2. How many direct competitors are there for the product in the region where xavier is concentrating and how many of the "strategy-2" kind of businesses are looking at expanding with a "strategy-1" range of t-shirts. If Xavier is beginning his business with some entries in this scenario, the entire outlook of the business changes.   3. Given the segment and pricing, how long and sustaining could a product be in the absence of investment in designing/R&D/branding etc., over a significant period of time. Once Xavier starts a business, and Ram begins to concentrate on "strategy-2", Bala might get some commission for all his consulting work that he did for them, and build up considerable cash reserves and then start a business of his own choosing a via-media between his two strategies... by going for a larger produce than Xavier, but lesser quality than ramgopal, and priced in between his two counterparts and use his cash reserves in some brand building efforts.  And he might showcase his product as "almost as good as Ram's with lesser price" and "much better than Xavier's with a little higher cost". So that he could cater to multiple income groups at one-shot.. and unless Xavier and Ram act quickly Bala is going to suffocate their business... after all, he knows their tricks...

      By the way chottu..... Price and quality are directly proportional i believe. I mean they are not two sides of a see-saw. I think its quantity and not quality which should be talked about here.(i mean if u are taking two sides of see-saw).  I mean quantity (mass production)against low cost, or quantity (Customised prodn.) against high cost can be two sides of see saw. Is my understanding correct?  If its quality, then as far my knowledge goes, Price increases with increase in quality and decreases with decrease in quality. So i opine that they cant be two sides of see-saw (since both sides can't be high or low at the same time except at the equilibrium position which u have said has got nothing to do with the business we are talking about) except for some exceptions.... So bala make me more clear if i go wrong in my words and thoughts. good that u did give us some inputs reg. mktg... too !Good marketing! unlike sri 's glossary.....  Btw Sri it can be just a mail from AJK to show that she too is there in the group. Nee pathu pakkathukku adicha glossary vida andha mail evalavo mel.  Jax i have replied to ur mail ...  Oh kicha, had a nice time at ur Inter DC meet....... So no wonder u dint attend that play. By the way friends, i had been to watch a play &#34;In the Hour of God&#34; which is based on Sri Aurobindo's epic poem &#34; urlLink Savitri &#34;  for those who dont know the story of Satyavan savitri, wait for the jist of the story in my next blog.....  The play was really very good with all the actors performing so well and excellent accoustics, BGM, good story line and concepts explained in simple words thought it might mean different to different persons based on their level of understanding. Except for few flaws in the framing of some characters and dialogues, the play was almost like a movie. Since its not directly based on the original version of Savitri, but on a reproduced version, virtue of some characters were diluted to suite current day needs which i felt is not needed for such themes.   but then, i enjoyed the play like anything, esp. the character of savitri is such a strong character and the actress was damn good in performing, by giving herself to give the character a real soul. Splendid were her expressions as her words spoke of her emotions, and strength of her inner self. Oh kicha and ram, u missed it ya.  Ok then will blog u all later till then bye for now!

      Like Kavi had mentioned there was an inter-DC (Development Center) meet in Bangalore on friday and saturday.. but unlike Kavi had mentioned only Kishore enjoyed it, Ram didn't come...  Samavesh means "encompassing"..  true to its name, participants from all the development centers had come here... it was one of the best events I've ever witnessed... it had virtually everything u could hope for... the span of events were spread across sports (volleyball, throwball, football, TT etc) to the usual stuff of Antakshari, Dumb C, JAM, Ad Mad etc...   Friday evening show was the dance. It was unbelievable to see a bunch of software engineers dance like true professionals.. it was not just a shake of hips... every team had chose a theme for the dance... and presented them very meticulously... Saturday, there was even more in store.. the antakshari made everyone remain on their toes... How in the world do they remember so much songs..!! The quiz was both informative and interesting... there were lots of animated moments that only a "live" audience could ever enjoy...  We (people like me) did our part too.. even though we were not taking part in any event, we were the ones who added color to the show with our "cheering-up"... shouting at the top of our voices.. The team from Chennai had brought in drums and a huge flag... it was more like sitting among a crowd watching cricket match...  Nandan was in the middle for sometime during quiz... as he kept his first step on the stage.. the drums began to roll... and we were not far behind... we got empty Kinley bottles and started banging on the tables and chairs... and of course, our voices were at their largest decibels... Nandan was quick to remark with a smile "I never got such a 'lively' welcome in my life...!!" He sure was spot on...!!  Saturday evening, as prizes were distributed there was a crackers display.. The sky was lit with color... the darkness could be realised only if someone reminded that it was late evening... night seems to have meekly handed over the baton to the day... it was so colourful that the gifted eyes which were fortunate to witness it were saturated with delight... it was around 9.30PM when everything got over... as the people from other DCs slowly and tiredly walked to their respective buses.   They were truely, days to cherish...

      Hi all,  Every F5 in our blog screen makes my eyebrow touch my fore hair. Astonishing to see the quantity and the quality of the words. Excellent. Ok me let get in to the stuff before you yawn. I am left at the back seat when I see technological blogs in a sequel. There is no body to advocate on Marketing. Let me lend a hand for Marketing, which is giving me both hands and lifting me up.   To my understanding there are not more than two strategies for an upcoming business unit.  1.Manufacture more with low quality, price it less and find more customers. 2.Track down end consumers, manufacture less with higher quality, and price it high.   If Kicha puts me a query “ why not manufacture more with good quality and find more customers?” I will reply “ yes da but in this competitive world a penny expended should get 5 in reverse hence being meticulous in every thing we will end up in a mess”. Price and quality are either side of ‘see saw’ if one goes up naturally the other gets down. If Sriprasath argues “why not place equal weights on both sides and keep it stable” I would say “that is not for See saws are made da”.  So by now hope you would agree to my two points. That is fantastic. Then, I must proceed to the pro’s and con’s of being one among the two.   Now that Xavier has agreed to follow strategy one for his textile business (Coimbatore) I must also convince him that why should he be a part of strategy one. It is because we at India associate value with money and not quality (we means majority) hence xavier can anticipate more customers. Mahendran, his partner might ask me “so what”. He knows that I will convince him by highlighting the following points  1.Marketing expenses will be the lesser in your balance sheet(xavi sells a t-  shirt for INR 50 hence people will go for it). 2.There are people to try your new product released in future (he might release  a cargo for INJR175). 3.Investment in Brand building isn’t necessary.  4.Rub your huge advertisement costs; it is not necessary (one advt in “dina malar” as T-Shirts  at Rs.50 for sale ). 5.Packaging, designing R&D- what do they mean in dictionary?  6.Ambassadors costing crores are out of our game. **( I will give u my call sheets da)  So why is Ramgopal pinching my hip on the other side. Oh sorry da I have promised you that the second strategy is the best. This idiot Xavier has told Ram what I have told him. Don’t cry Ram I will justify my stand. We will follow second strategy and soon overtake Xavi’s revenue. Now that we have spent a bit in understanding the Indian customer need   We are to manufacture T-Shirts designed in Germany. We will also give them the power of being exclusive. We are creating an excellent advt with Judev as the ambassador. Valli was surprised to see our advt telecasted during India Pak cricket match. So at last Ram has bought me a BMW for being his strategist. Now that I am supposed to address his executives about how we succeeded I am putting the following in my ppt presentation  1.We had priced our product in the skies which balanced all our expenses. 2.We have our showrooms present in all the metropolis hence we have the cream. 3.We have built loyal customers, who are lavish spenders. 4.We concentrate on every single customer, deliver delight and compel him for repeated purchase. 5.We had a “tour urope” scheme for family day in April, carrying them in the “cruise queen” 20 yards lengthier than Titanic. 6.We bagged best design awards from BW. (Oh God now Ram goes multi national).**  Being worn out after working for years, making Xavi and Ram the multi millionaires I am unable to help Rajesh for his upcoming Political party. Give me a desk and a chair I need to pen my first book “ who cannot loose”.   ** please call toll full number91-98433-36512 for more valid points

      Yeah, I forgot this interesting issue......A week back, I was in my school, working in the Lab..... there was pin drop silence...When suddenly, the Lab assisstant, stood up & shouted loudly, "there's a bomb threat & i request everybody to move out of the building immediately".....We started moving, & the fire alarm in all the buildings were turned on.....It was very cold outside, & there was no place to go.......we were asked to go further beyond the parking lots too......Cops were rushing in, Bomb squads with all thier outfits poured in, fire engines were called, everybody was nervous.......In this scenario, we were waiting out, for like one hr....I literally froze, could'nt feel my toes...After one hr, there was an announcement, that it was only a threat & we were all allowed in.....ooooohhhhhh!!! finally could get some warmth....The next day, i got fever & eventually cold & suffered a lot......But, it was an experience....Witnessing those cinematic scenes, in real life......

Ram, mariyaadhaya, Infy experience pathi seekarama blog pannu.......Do you guys meet each other?...You & Kicha?.....Guess, You should be under training now.......  Sriprasath, I don't know if that    It news   is your own research on different issues or just a replica from a magazine. But I can say you, that AOL is worth for its $23.95, when compared to wal-mart's dial-up service. I've had both the providers, in the past (Wal mart's was just for a week, I was really frustrated)....There is a BIG difference in quality, i would say......BTW, Why have you given the same news twice?....If you've missed something, you have the edit option, to add it on, to your previous blog itself......  I was a bit busy with my final exams & the 11th hr assignment submissions.....Yet to be relieved....My exams are over next week...I thought I would'nt be able to blog till then.....  But when I read Xavier's  "Ranting" , could'nt resist blogging......Who's the gal man?.......I could infer one thing... Of all those, who've read Xavier's other blog, Ram seems to be the one, who's most affected.....Whoz your gal Ram???? Others who have'nt noted this, I would recommend to back to Ram's last blog.....  will post my views on  "She hated losing. That was the last time I played chess."  , in my next blog

      I currently read an article in a magazine that Online Hackers are making serious threats to Online gaming, gambling websites. Recently an online gaming site in US was threatened to pay a sum $50,000 for not bringing the site down. The Company discontented to the request. The site was brought down. Even the Department of IT security services is not able to trace out who is the root cause for the problem.  Microsoft has announced a Bonanza price of $5 Million to encourage King of hackers. Currently, Microsoft has planned to prize the hacker with $1 million who traces out  the culprit who is responsible for m32.redhot.hack virus in the coming 6 months.(I am happy the software giant can't able to trace out the same).  AOL is losing its customers day by day.  It has lost most of its customers to cheap dial-up providers. AOL is losing the battle on price. When you have Wal-Mart  offering service for $9.94 a month, AOL has a hurdle to clear at $23.95 a month.

      Most of u might know where the Headquarters of Infosys is located. But what you may not know is the long stretch of virtually fatal corridor through which people travel everyday to reach there... I’m talking about the NH – Hosur Road stretch, that connects the "Electronics city" which houses a large number of corporates with the mainland and is fast becoming a leading contender for "the most fatal road" award.. especially for people traveling in 2-wheelers... let alone pedestrians. Three infoscions have met with fatal accidents in that road over the past 1 month. And god knows how many more of other friends... Despite hues by corporate heads including Azim Premji, the Govt responded with hardly a benign reply... It seems to be every man for himself on that NH...  As a step to stem this rising menace, we at Infosys have launched a scheme. We call it the  Car Pooling ... The number of employees commuting in cars is much of a 3-digit figure with almost as many number of cars.  Car Pooling  is all about every willing person who has some seats vacant when he drives out, announcing that he has N vacant seats to accommodate that many people... and he goes to place X via place Y at time T... and interested persons can contact him directly and join him to their destination and reach safely to their home.   A tyical post would be...   Subject:   3 seats available To: Koramangala 3rd Block, Raheja Residency - via: Silk Board, Fern Hills, IGate Contact Person - Sriram (extn. 59121 /  mob. 98451-81367) My Car - Light Green Santro Xing, KA-01-A-1672 Location - Parked between Building 20 and 23. Leaving around 8 PM.   This "announcing" is enabled by having a new folder specifically for  Car Pooling  in the Bulletin board, where willing persons can post their willingness or people who want a ride can post their requirements...  Now, what does this solve...  1. The number of people taking to 2-wheelers can be reduced this way by optimum use of available vacant seats in cars and thereby reducing traffic risks in the NH. 2. Reduces the internal traffic within the Infosys campus by reducing the number of 2 wheelers getting parked and moved around. 3. Enables people traveling to places not well connected by buses. 4. Facilitates people who may have to travel at an "untimely" time.  Today is the first day of its launch and the folder is already brimming with activity... People posting their willingness to take others and also others posting their needs of a ride to some place... There is also an initiative to launch an application in the intranet that will channelise and better organize this entire procedure.   Hope, friends in other corporates around this place too start to follow some such means.

      " She hated losing. That was the last time I played chess. "  But why..?? I understand, she is everything a woman ought to be.. but why do I need to stop playing chess if she hated losing. If I'm so serious about having a companion for life, the smallest expection I could have from her is, she comforts my sorrows and enjoys my victories as hers, and that I do the same thing with respect to her...   Why does it have to be a one-way "giving in"...?? And its obvious that such one-way giving ins are soon going to evaporate as life moves on and responsibilities take the better of the "trying to please her" phase...   She might be the most precious jewel I would ever have wanted in my life... but jewels too need polish... (and this holds for the "He" too)...  PS: jax, u don't have a comments section (atleast, I could not find), so I've posted my comments about ur  urlLink ranting  here...  --------------------------  Pretty woman, don't make me cry Pretty woman, don't walk away,  If that's the way it must be, o.k.

      You may have already read this.. but still... this is quite thought provoking enough to repeat...   A mechanic was removing a cylinder head  from the motor of a Harley, when he spotted a world-famous heart surgeon in his shop. The heart surgeon was waiting for the service manager to come take a look at his bike. The mechanic shouted across the garage, 'Hey Doc can I ask you a question?'       The famous surgeon, a bit surprised, walked  over to the mechanic working on the motorcycle. The mechanic straightened up, wiped his hands on a rag and asked, 'So Doc, look at this engine. I also can open hearts, take valves out, fix'em, put in new parts and when I finish this will work just like a new one. So how come I get a pittance and you get  the real big money, when you and I are doing basically the same work?'      The surgeon paused, smiled and leaned over, and  whispered to the mechanic..... 'Try doing it with  the engine running'.   Good one, ain't it... I thought a little more starting from this... will say more about that tomorrow... I'm beside myself today...

      Hei, i was occupied with my Rational training last week and so couldnt blog. But then i will not leave u all without sharing what i did for the past two weeks.  first and foremost, i went to a concert. Yes, Pandit Jasraj and L. Subramaniam's concert. I struck with one beautiful feeling. Have u people heard an instrument singing a song, or have u heard anybody's voice echoing like an instrument? Yes, i did. L.subramaniam is a renowned violinist and in his play of bow, u can hear the song just as its being sung. To be frank, i dint even know the verses, but i was carried over by the first Melancholy of his performance. His work was getting improved as it usually happens in any concert in the most unusual manner. Pandit JAsraj's voice toh, was so beautifully orchestrating with the thugs and thumps of Tabela and other instruments and at one point, they both merged and made me feel the oneness too. Both are stalwarts in their domain, Jasraj in hindustani vocal and L.Subramaniam an international violinist.   The whole concert was divided into 3 sections where in first panditji perfromed, then L. Subramaniam and then their most awaited "JugalBandhi". JugalBandhi is nothing but, two different artists performing together simultaneously but in sync.   I am already mesmerised by Pandit's voice. First I happened to listen to Panditji's voice in his Mandukya Upanishad casette. It was the first avenue for me in Hindustani music and i was spell bound when i listened to his voice. It is liquid gold glowing all the way it goes. I was infact happy to have made acquainted myself to Devotional music thru' such a rich voice, rendition and hymns.   There are some voices which sound different in different medias, esp it differs between live and recorded one. but great people's voices are always alike and i experienced it live there in that concert. He was fully vibrating with life of music and though he was turning 75 years, his voice is still the same without any haircrack.   They way both were enjoying themselves made the audience to enjoy them also along with music. Panditji has got a smiling face and so he was in full smile after every line..... And so after every play of bow, L.S. also, though looks resolute, gave a mild smile unique but marvellous by its own. When the show was over, audiences couldnot resist themselves and they gave a standing ovation and cried for once more. Never have i seen such a response from audience. Infact when they were carried away by the artists and they lauded it with claps, even it was musical.   And to our surprise, after sometime, it was S.M.Krishna who was amongst us enjoying the show.  Hei i dint tell u where we sat na... When we went to the concert, the tickets were sold out and so we dint know what to do. So we waited to know any means to get inside. The concert which was about to start at 6 o clock started at 7. There were so many musical enthusiasts like us waiting outside. So the manager, made some arrangement. Yes, we were allowed to sit on the dias, just few foot away from the artists. No ticket fare too. I was amazed, since we were the first on the dias and were placed perfectly. God, All the performers and CM of the state were standing just a foot away, but since music seemed to occupy my mind , it dint strike me much at that moment. Only aftersometime, i felt how lucky we had been. good was that evening!  Rest of the events i will blog later Ranjini

      The coconut oil which was frozen when I left for Madurai last week is liquified now... Bangalore is warming up... and so are some of our people... to face the higher challenges in life and career...   Jax, is commencing his MCJ course, Bala is looking forward to Brand Management... Bala, I had a look at the ICFAI site about the course.. seems impressive as far as the course structure goes... so its just the decision of spending that u need to consider... if u feel u can eke out the required fee and also confident of doing full justice to studying the course amid ur work right at this moment, then u can go ahead applying for the forthcoming academic year itself...  Myself and Kavi will be starting our MCAD preparation soon... But I don't have an option of thinking if I can do it now or later.. its been made mandatory for me... and I have registered for my first (of three) papers for April... so I have 2 months in between to prepare whatever I can, and then need to finish the next 2 papers within 3 months after clearing the 1st paper... otherwise we won't get the fee reimbursed...   Kavi too will be beginning soon...   So.. anyone else looking to warm yourself up this summer...

      Hi all,  Thanks for your inputs regarding the resume. Also there seems to be a lot of TW opportunities available for the taking. Rini, I visited the link you specified. they don't seem to have a requirement in their opportunity list. As for today's Hindu, could someone send the details to me. The versions and opportunity listings differ from city to city.   Could someone also check  urlLink this company . Looks good, still better to be safe.  Rini, I don't remember the name of the school. But I think it was not the school you had mentioned. I'll try to recollect if possible.  Bala, the format of the resume is to mimic the  XML  format. It is not  XML , da. It is pure  XHTML . Putting it in  XML  sounds good. Let me see if that is possible.

      Starting from colors, till the content....... all are good and impressive, though i dint read it word by word. But first impression was really good ya. Keep it up. Looks very decent and pleasant, but then how far it will be legible to the HR's who are the ones who will receive ur resume is a small question which popped in my mind and so think about it too. If he happens to be a techie guy with a little sweep on mark up langauages, then he will surely be happy to have u, but other way?

      The number of  IIT s have increased. Good to hear that. The number of colleges and universities (including deemed univs) have increased. Nice. The  UGC  has mae it compulsory for faculties to pass either  SLET / NET . Wonderful. But where are those bright graduates, the future architects of India?  I can agree with the later part of the article - IITs being the only advanced educational model. There may be other models, like CEDs for example. But I feel that the refinement of the education model has to be from the grassroot level. There is no use trying to improve only the  creme de la creme .   We have been following a mish-mash of education patterns, some practices handed down by tradition and some copied from other influences. The education system should be more life-oriented, i.e. more education that would be useful practically need to be taught. I am not advocating total westernisation of education, but instead a ecletic adoption of best educational practices . I believe there is one such school somewhere in Chennai. I don't know its name. But the education system followed sounded good. Students studying there might not go on to be engineers or doctors, but they can handle the challenges of life more comfortably than thier peers in professional streams.  BTW, western institutions have become great institutions over the years because the sense of 'alma mater' was high among the students. The students did thier best to build up the institution that had taught them, through whatever means they could, from monetary funds to physical labour. Somehow, I find that sense of giving back is mostly missing in our country.  That could be a reason why the IITs (no, the entire education sector) looks hoary.The final words, "educators and lay people would consider India's future educational needs", is the point that one should ponder upon from the article.   All said and done,  it is interesting why this issue has come up with the elections just round the corner? Maybe this speech by Joshi is slated to appear in the election agenda? Maybe someone really cares... Maybe...  Kicha, Thanks for sending the article by mail.

      The Laws of Explanation are simple. I guess everyone can guage thier meaning. The person who gave the Laws is Tim Bray, the founder of  XML . He had postulated the two laws when he faced a particular problem understanding how a software worked. Here is the explanation he gave for the first Law.    When you’re explaining something to somebody and they don’t get it, that’s not their problem, it’s your problem.   The practical take-away from this law is that for anything that’s deep enough to matter, you’re going to have to do a lot of explaining, and you absolutely totally can’t afford to get impatient or irritated when it isn’t going fast enough, you just have to explain better.  This is difficult, but not all that difficult. People who can’t get their message across usually don’t get too far in this world, so anyone who’s making an impact almost by necessity combines the articulateness and patience to (eventually) get the job done.  The Second Law is   When someone’s explaining something to you and you’re not getting it, it’s not your problem, it’s their problem.   The practical take-away is that you have to be totally courageous and truthful in saying “I don’t understand; please explain again.” Otherwise you won’t get the message and you’ll be the loser.  As far as I know, I felt that these two laws were somehow related to everything we do. Additionally, I thought that it perfectly matched what we had been  discussing   arguing  discussing earlier.  As for the Delta Law, I had given a small description about the Law below the law itself. So I don't think I should repeat myself. Hope you remember what "  po  " means. The Delta law was just another form of that  po . I find this law very useful when I come up against a wall in my mind. This is more related to problem solving and creativity.  The above two postings did not have any significance with the recent events. But Bharucha's Law was a quote I posted. I can't explain why. But maybe later. Manny, they are not about, 'unseen words'. It is about understanding the context in which the message is conveyed. A somewhat complex repostulation of the Theory of Communication (Claude Shannon/ Networks). Here is one more law I guess that might need no explanation. Anything that can be misunderstood will be. -  urlLink David G. Myers  BTW, could someone mail (postmark id) me a copy of the rediff article, not the link but the entire article? I cannot access Rediff at office. That was a good point on CED. I don't know about the quality of the course right now. But it definitely could not have got much better than ours. BTW, here is the link to  urlLink Brahmos  website. I had a couple of book reviews written down. But I decided to post it to  urlLink QSS  as it offers a category-wise listing. Here onwards, please find my book reviews  urlLink here .

      ...all said and done, there is a thing which still makes the difference. As I said we could have had 1000 CEDs for one IIT.  But the difference would have been, as we had one IIT, it lasted for few decades and still there alive and on the other hand probably if we have had 1000 CEDs then none would have lasted longer as it happened with our CED.  mrchhhhh!!!!

      I was just reading the article in rediff.com about this IIT brand and its there now in our blog.  Of course one cannot deny that IITs are really worthy feathers in India’s cap. But the irony is that all the birds of the same feather flocks together not for the goodness of our community but rather the IIT brains are  patented almost by someone who can afford to it. And Its my opinion that instead of having one IIT we could have had 1000 CEDs. It was rightly put by Murali Manohar Joshi that the huge amounts spent on IITs did not yield the expected ROI. Reason being the product we produced was not realized for our benefits. I often wonder why the kind of bullet trains that was there in Japan was not here in India.  It is not the lack of ability for such a country like India, which was able to produce supersonic BrahMos Missiles, to implement the bullet trains. Rather, the bullet trains may not be a viable means for today’s Indian Mass. The same is the case with IITs. Its not that we were not able to afford to employ an IIT product but rather the IIT product itself was not a need for today’s (or probably the near past) Indian mass. Of course it was the power of knowledge that makes what you see as today’s India. But as you see these developments was not because of the knowledge produced by the IITs. Rather it was due to the rest of IITs, which has the lion’s share for this upsurge in our development.  I have seen people doing research in big heads like IITs and IGIDR still researching the Great Depression of 1930s and getting a hefty monthly grant for what they do like a conventional report generation.  On a personal note, I feel that, for such huge investments and grants on IITs and other such premier institutes, The ROI should have been even more and who knows…had IITs been with a private professional hand, the output would have been different.

      A very different view about our famed IIT... read  urlLink full-story ...   What do u feel about this...   But is the IIT model the only, and best, model for advanced education? Probably not. This is why I say the IIT model is aging. It is a fact that the IITs have not really kept up with the times........  ...........But as far as I know, not a single IIT has a well regarded program in any of the great new frontiers of technology, in particular in biotechnology. Nor in nanotechnology, in new power technologies such as hydrogen fuel cells, in any cutting edge area, really. Why is this? One reason is that they are insulated from the market, as they are guaranteed a Rs 75 crore grant from the government every year.

      Interesting point by Bala.. In this context, macroscopic thinking is not what is aimed at.. but the attitude of a customer and how a salesperson could prevail over him... Even in our daily routines our efforts are more at proving others wrong rather than substantiating why I could be right...   Its simple human psychology... We always tend to feel we know just that little bit more than others and in our enthusiasm to demonstrate our efficacy we forget our good points and start targetting the other person's points should we feel them conflicting... But the ideal way to deal with the situation is to render enough leeway to the other person's ideas too and extrapolate it with our own points and refine an inference...   Its never going to be easy to change what could already have been a "well-thought-out" decision by a customer... It pays to dispense with some of our ego and go down to the lees in making more sense of our points rather than offending his ego by snubbing his views... It does take more effort, time and patience to bring the subject under our sway, but its far more effective than the "blind denial" method...

      As you said the salesman might lose the customer. He might just move off to the next shop to buy Timex. If you looking at it from just the viewpoint of the cutomer and a sales person, it is the customer who wins. Maybe by following your approach, the salesman may gain a customer.  But if you look at it from a macroscopic POV, the Tata Group wins both ways.  As Timex and Titan are part of the same Tata Group. Was the usage of both brands done intentionally or a wrong choice of watch brands? If you purposely used Timex and Titan brands, what I said above holds true. If it was unintentional, just ignore the previous para and brush up on company information (just an advice).   So it depends on what you see and where you see yourself. That is what I see from your post.  BTW: Ranjini didn't you feel that the movie storyline was very similar to 'Dhalapathy'. You noted tinges of Mahabharatha. I noticed tinges of "Ronin". A Google search would allow you to note the allegories of the film with the story of 47 Ronin.   What happened to "Virumaandi"? I expected at least a couple of reviews. As I was sick, I was unable to complete my review. It might be ready by tomorrow mostly. As for my banglore trip details, they are not ready yet. But on my train journey to Bangalore, I had a lot of spare time to write. I chose an hour's journey.  It is just a description of an hour's journey. I started writing at 4:45 pm and stopped at 5:55pm. You can read it  urlLink here .  A funeral procession I saw while journeying, inspired me to write  urlLink this . I still have got a few more of my writings I did on the train. I'll have to type them in first. I am a very slow typist.

      Hi all,  Our current crush made to re examine what we have done and that throwed light upon few of the blues.  When two persons have different views and they talk to each other. We are more interested in proving the others point wrong rather than proving why we are right? (including me)This gives me an excellent overview of a sales call.  Imagine a guy walks to a watch show room and asks for a Timex watch. Sad that the shop does hold Titan pieces alone. How do u think the discussion proceed?  The sales person would criticise his decision to buy a Timex.  He thinks that when u prove that his decision is wrong he might sell his Titan to him.  But when u put your legs on the customer shoes. He will have his legs burried to Timex. we must understand that before the customer has decided to buy a Timex  there would have been a process strating from   Should I buy? what to buy? Which to buy? How do I buy? Where do I buy? How much do I buy?  After having analysed he himself confines to Timex. When we try to prove him wrong it disturbs his ego and thus we end up losing a customer.   But understand he can be convinced at any point of time to have a deviation from what he has decided. This is where the role of the Sales Man comes in.  Imagine if the Sales person convinces the customer by putting "sir though Timex is good Titan would be a better option because...' Do u think we will not make a Sale here?????    Balachander

      Rini, Just now I watched the movie last night. I thought I may be able to give a review by tomorrow. But you beat me to it.   Ram, should your post title be related to the laws rather than to Delta. I expected a better answer to the question. Try again, Who is Tim Bray?

      Those who explain can’t afford to get impatient or irritated when it isn’t going fast enough, they just have to explain better. So anyone who’s making an impact almost by necessity combines the articulateness and patience to (eventually) get the job done.  Those who can't understand should have the courage to say, “I don’t understand; please explain again.”  Tim Bray is not a lawyer, but have enough exposure to the field of Intellectual Property to have developed immense respect for its complexity and subtleties.

      Tomorrow I'm going for a project party... Yippeee...!! This will be my first project party in over 14 months of infy life... we don't have any project parties in my department (SETLabs) as we don't do projects in its literal sense and so there is no budgetary allocation for such parties...   The current project I'm supporting will finally be giving me a taste of it... Kavitha has gone for atleast 3 parties in 9 months at infy and ram went for a party in his very first week... so this becomes very significant for me...!!

      Zwick(Director) explores an interesting idea of an American Civil War veteran who is finding it difficult to shake off his own battlefield demons, drawn into yet another civil war.We first see Capt Woodrow Algren (Tom Cruise) punishing himself with too much alcohol and self-pity. He is performing a one-man show in San Francisco to sell Winchester rifles. We slowly understand that he has been traumatised by the massacre of an Indian village carried out under the command of Col Bagley (Tony Goldwyn).Yet Bagley is not out of Algren's life. He and another army officer Zebulon Gant (Billy Connolly) persuade Algren to train the conscript army of the Japanese emperor who wants to modernise his country.Algren realises quickly he is against formidable odds.   One of them is posed by a band of samurai lead by Katsumoto (Ken Watanabe). Early in the movie, Algren is wounded and captured by the samurai.  When Katsumoto spares Algren's life despite the harm he has inflicted on Katsumoto's men, the film begins to take a predictable turn. We now suspect the two foes are going to change their hearts towards each other. In one of the film's unbelievable sequences, Katsumoto even lodges Algren with his sister, Taka (Koyuki), the widow of the samurai the American had killed. Even then, things are not going to be easy for Algren. For he has to take a lot of beatings from one of his bitter foes among the samurai, Ujio (Hiroyuki Sanada).  Soon Algren goes with Katsumoto to Tokyo for a political showdown with the emperor (Shichinosuke Nakamura) and businessman Omura (Masato Harada), who wants to modernise Japan. But Algren suspects he is doing it for his own personal gains.In Tokyo, Katsumoto is arrested and offered the choice of taking his own life. Algren and the other samurais free Katsumoto and they flee from the imperial army. But they know they will have to confront the emperor's large and comparatively modern army. A big challenge to the two men is how to neutralise the big guns so the Samurai can have an advantage in hand-to-hand combat.

      Guyes, better we would hav gone for this movie! Watch "The last samurai" . Classic movie talking about Japanese warriors -samurai. Beautiful movie, with good music and good acting and on top of all, excellent theme. The core is similar to what happens in Mahabharatha. Yes, When the japanes king decides to modernise his army, the warriors riot against it (not just like that, but since he employs modernisation in a way against their core values). The samurai leader, though the teacher of the king, cannot correct the king when his student(the king) takes a wrong decision. This is similar to all those great stalwarts in the Hastinapur, who were unable to educate dhuriyodhana when he decides to fight against pandavas.    Ultimately, the samurai leader gives his life for his cause and only then the king realises his state. But by then, they had lost the entire set of legendary warriors. Excellent are the dialogues, though u need to have an idea of the subject dealt.    If u see, superficially, u might think, y these samurai's are fighting against the king, but they do, coz, he does so without understanding the age old tradition of fighting and he takes up the words of those who work for their own welfare rather than the nation. Samurai forces were built to protect the nation and there lies the entire interest. But the king is interested in just modernising and strengthening the army with more arms and ammunitions and training them. so there comes a conflict in his motive of modernising and doing it at the cost of losing the tradition. But what is their tradition, that u will have to grasp from the movie! So do film it and view it ya.   Hei u know what guys............. yesterday i went to a concert ya. To Pandit Jasraj and L. Subramniam's concert. Both are stalwarts, the former in Hindustani Vocal and the later an international Violinist. We dint get tickets, but then we waited and atlast succeeded in getting seated on the dias. Excellent was the concert! Simply amazing were both performers and i was filled with ecstacy!will share about my experience in my next blog.   My training in RUP(Rational Unified Process) started today and will go on for the next two weeks. Ok then meet u all later Ranjini

      I already have Framemaker. I am about to start downloading Robohelp. Don't worry. I am at iway. The speeds are amazingly fast as I had said to you earlier. You said you had some documentation on FM. How big is it? I am in Yahoo Messenger now. I'll be online probably for the next hour or so fiddling with the templates.

      I am officially on leave today. I am typing this after a visit to the doctor. Interestingly, checking my mail, I came across a quote that was sent to me. It goes like:  Delta's Law   There are three sides to every story.  The Greek letter delta is a symbol for change in formulas. This triangle can be taken personally to create a philosophy that can be used as laws. For example, the 3 points of a triangle create a possibility space for change. Two points in a debate provide nothing more than a tyranny of dichotomies, whereas adding a third possibility is always more interesting, and closer to the true complexity of life. Does anyone have any opposing views that this law isn't valid?

        The First Law : When you’re explaining something to somebody and they don’t get it, that’s not their problem, it’s your problem.   The Second Law : When someone’s explaining something to you and you’re not getting it, it’s not your problem, it’s their problem. So I guess it must be my problem on both counts. So much for playing  advocatus diaboli .  Since you guys wanted something interesting, the above two laws are from Tim Bray. Any guesses on who he is?

      ... I should be going to a girl I had never even laid my eyes on before in my life and say 'I love you' to her. I don't know about you. But I have never believed in love at first sight. Maybe you were talking about some other form of love here. I guess you might be speaking from experience regarding unseen words.   Manny, I am glad that you know what a team means.   As for the part about reaching out to the world, As you had said, I could have done anything with this blog. But I am interested in getting everyone's views before that, not two or three. Anyway for your information, neither Rini nor Srini was interested in enrolling Srini as a member. It was I who requested if we can have him.   Since you asked why I haven't added anyone who had asked me to join this blog, I'll tell you the reason. What happened in the past few days is why. I had this plan for sometime as I had explained earlier.  I was just wondering if I should tell everyone as a responsible person or just add them and then let you know.   I guess now after reading the posts for the past few days, I wouldn't surprised if they decide not to accept the invitations. Surely I wouldn't after all this hullaboo. As I said in my post, you never knew what you are missing.

      i am not interested in knowing what a team is all about from u jax... U said...   I have been getting mails from several people asking me to enroll them in the blog. These people were not from msitmmb. I have had requests from U.K., U.S., even one from South Africa and Australia, other than India. The people seem to be interested in joining the blog and participating.   Its as simple as that... why is that u did not have the time to add those to the team...? You cud have reached out to the world by then...ha ha ha ha ha ha...  Then coming to the unseen words... Jax try saying "I Love You" to a girl ( cute pretty girl) whom you dont know and see what happens... Of course "I love You" is not an offensive phrase as such and could convey a number of meaning... But when said to a girl what wud be the predominant message conveyed....? ha ha...The slap in your cheek could say u the meaning... I can go on substantiating futher and i can address ur questions...but later...bye bye.  I am retiring...

      Manny, what does a team mean? "A group of people working towards a common goal". Is that right or do you have any other connotations for a team? As per my earlier post, the description suits the blog aptly. So I am not changing it.   BTW, I noticed the lack of the word, 'msitmmb' in the blog description. I cannot see it. Can you?  If people want to read unseen words and meanings, it is not going to be the writer's responsibility.   Yeah, it was me who ' urlLink presumed ' that everyone could belong in a group. Maybe I was wrong in that.  Going by your " urlLink Ennamo ponga " post, I suppose I am not allowed to discuss anything about the blog with anyone else. Am I seeing a sort of  NDA  here? I cannot post what, say my girlfriend or parent feels about a particular issue, just because it is someone else's thoughts. Isn't that what you were trying to say?   Coming to the point of one's views, what do you mean by 'one's view'? If you say, it is your point of view. I have a question, Is that an original thought? Did you think about it, all by yourself, without being influenced by others? (I mean by another person's views through any communication media.) If it was influenced by some other person, it never was your thought at all. I am going too philosophical here, I guess.   As for the rest of my post, I feel it is relevant to the blog in terms of ideas, influences, and quite a lot of things. As you said it has been precipated by the recent issue, but this has been on my mind for quite some time. That was why I took two days to respond.  But before that, I would like to hear from everyone.

This blog description below wud have made me and some others feel the way they are now...   "just a team weblog about our work, lives, hopes, dreams, disappointments, disasters, and any other issues that we get time to discuss on."   For the rest that u have discussed....I hope its irrelevant to the present issue and its neither ranjini nor the others who wanted srini to be included in the blog but its u who presumed that he cud be in our group...It is not a no to srini but in generic terms this means something in general though the reason for this issue cud be out of srini...  ok Bye bye

       I want this blog to be closed for non MSITMians. Hey wait a minute. Who said something about this blog being only for msitmmbians? I never mentioned it when the blog was started. Did anyone else specifically mention that this was only for msitmmbians? I don't think so. I just checked the archives. I found no body saying that this is a limited membership blog.  I am not participating just because the topic is interesting and the discussion is good. But because it is  we  discussing good topics. Bala, if this is the core reason for your objection, I guess you might have selective amnesia.  We  have a group called  urlLink msitmmb  for discussing. We have had discussions in them in the past. So why don't we continue using it. The members are limited to only those who had studied M.S. (IT&M) between 2000 and 2002 at Madurai Kamaraj University. It is everything you want except of course  the participation part .  Why do you need a blog when you have a group? The raison d'etre for this blog is to be a medium where everyone can post thier views and be subjected to criticism/praises. Since a blog is put onto the Internet, everyone has the right to praise or criticise it. I hope you understand what I am speaking about. It works quite wonderfully.   Let me give an example. A few months ago, I posted a link to a  urlLink CSS House . The designer had mailed me saying that I had projected misleading information. I said that I may be right and sent him a few screenshots. Accordingly, he used the screenshots to improve his design. That is what the web is about - improving people and lives.   I recall having telling a few of you that I have been getting mails from several people asking me to enroll them in the blog. These people were not from msitmmb. I have had requests from U.K., U.S., even one from South Africa and Australia, other than India. The people seem to be interested in joining the blog and participating. At first, I had my doubts about them. But on frequent correspondence with them over a period of time, I found that the blog would do great with them participating.  I recall a mail I had sent to the 'msitmmb' group. I used the following words (with special emphasis): "If you want to become a member, the only requisite is 'active' participation.  The blogger group is not a form of elite group where only a few are welcome ." Everyone agreed to it, if I remember. Now what happened to you? Selective Amnesia?  If we had no faults, we should not take such pleasure in calling attention to other people’s . - Francois La Rochefoucauld Incidentally, reading of what a few of you had to say about Rini posting a few of Srini's comments. I feel that what you say is not appropriate. I had posted quite a few citations and quotations like the one above. So do you object saying that I am using someone's observations, instead of my own? Can someone clarify this point?   So let me be clear on a few points.  The blog was never meant to be only for msitmmbians. Those who want to cater to only a select few like your classmates, please use the msitmmb or mail them individually. Do not post it here.    Since the blog is on the Internet, I feel anyone has the right to complain/congratulate anything being said on the blog. If you cannot stomach that thought, it is   your   problem, not some one else's.    Everyone has the right to substantiate what they say. The sources can be from  anywhere ,from websites, books, other people (both living and dead), as long as they cite the source and do not alter it to suit thier purpose.  Since I brought up this issue in the first place, I did it in the hope of improving everyone.  I never thought a few had this idea of the blog being a elite group. They may not know what  they are missing out. because  there are things you never knew  you never knew .  I don't know if the blog has helped anyone else. But it surely helped me in understanding quite a lot of things. I expect it to do so in the future too. I don't want to enclose myself within a small limited circle. I want to reach out to the world. A blog is a wonderful tool to do so. That was one of the reasons why I started " urlLink Quod scripsi scripsi ". I am not afraid of being criticised  for my thoughts, my ideas. I can accept it from anyone. That is why I have enabled comments in that blog. The question is "  Are You Afraid?  "

      There is nothing wrong in presenting ones views as long as he is a member of this blog. If I go on and present the views of the non-bloggers with whom I have my contacts, then it would be like taking our parliamentary affairs to the United Nations Security Council!!!!!!! This is a simple matter…but still a matter of privileges…  Hope you people should be remembering a day when our Chitra Mam wanted to be a member of our msitmmb group during the end of our course. We said “NO” to include her in the group, though she wanted to come in our group in order to keep in touch with us…isn’t it…  Bye bye then guys and gals…

      I take an opposite stand in this regard. I am not participating just because the topic is interesting and the discussion is good. But because it is  we  discussing good topics.  The sense of being among professionals backed by the synergy we had created for years is what which keeps me ticking in the blog. If suppose it was an X blog with unknown members and the same kind of discussion prolongs for sure I would not be so interested...   I cannot go to US for their economy is growing good and feel happy. Rather I am appreciating the growth of India being in India. did I make sense?

      Bala, I guess you can post  a list of reasons why this blog should be open to only msitmmbians?  Others can post thier views as well (  Should the blog be open to only msitmmbians or to everyone?  ).   It would be better if we can list the reasons down. It would be easier to discuss them point by point and also we would not be reiterating the same again and again.   I'll post mine soon, mostly by today.

      Sorry to disturb the discussion in the middle. A long time dream of mine has finally come true. A  urlLink Movable Type  blog. I had been waiting to try it out for a long, long tiem, well almst a year to get my hands on a blog running on MT.  After a couple of tries, I finally got a free hosting at  urlLink Weblogs.us .  Pongal seems to be a start of a good month. Initally, I am transporting my " urlLink Quod scripsi, scripsi " blog  from  urlLink Blogger  to  urlLink jaxsays.weblogs.us . I have not transferred the entries there completely. Just to keep you informed, I have posted a poem there. Hope you like it. Please update your bookmarks to the new site.  Bye and have a happy Pongal. Jax.

      Where did I come from..?  Why am I here..?  Where am I going from here..?  Why does the Universe exist..?  These are hardly the tip of an ice berg... submerged deep inside is the rejoinder to these imposing questions... and every attempt to reveal the concealed always leave us with another new vaccuum to encounter...  Over the centuries, the human mind has been so much impounded with presumptuous attitudes that the closer we try to move to an answer the farther it gets... Questions keep cropping up about the most fundamental pillars of our belief systems and how they have affected us and continue to affect...   The basis of any human's belief system - be it an atheist, agnostic or a believer - is just his/her contemplation of what constitues a "better" living... and this contemplation is in turn ruled by all the presemptuous attitudes I mentioned earlier...  The resultant is a menacingly assorted ideology of what could make his/her life to be "perfect"... and again, "perfect" is a relative word... its an iterative progression between what he/she feels is needed for a "perfect" living and where the presemptuous contemplations of the forerunners have left the person standing. A difficult phrase to comprehend..!!   Lost amid this mystification of life, the human psyche craves to move towards a calmer, more compassionate, more tolerant and more patient humankind, in search of a logical assessment and approach to our limited understanding of Divinity and Reality...  The search may lead some to a logical conclusion, which may not be scientific.. some may never ever reach a convincing conclusion... some may choose to just adopt other's conclusion... and such conclusions compose their belief system - the system they exercise on, to try to unravel the mystification in ways that every unique individual may be most comfortable with...  Its not in figuring out where one belongs among this three.. or where one should ideally belong... but in living true to their "conclusion" and appreciate the "conclusion" of others...   After all, irrespective of someone feeling good or bad about others "conclusion" the ever-concealed truth of where we came from, where we are going et. al. are never going to change...!!   Hopefully.. the after-life (if there is one) may answer it all...!!

       Do you have any opinions that you would be reluctant to express in front of a group of your peers?  If the answer is no, you might want to stop and think about that. If everything you believe is something you're supposed to believe, could that possibly be a coincidence? Odds are it isn't. Odds are you just think whatever you're told. Thought this  urlLink essay  would be a little useful to everyone involved in the current discussion.  Rini, If Srini is willing, You or me can add his name to the members list. Hope it's ok with everyone.

      “Thatz it” I would yell like that when I come across such lively topics. Let me get in to biz.. To my understanding whoever puts up his views about God and spirituality puts God on one side and alms on the other side of a balance scale. Investing for God is poles apart from providing alms. A devotee who spends crores in God can also be helping poor and the vice versa. Why is that we always advocate that “instead of spending Rs.5 for God I would spend Rs.2 for a poor or the disabled”. Why not do both? Why is that we have either of two and not both of two?   Hence I hope the point to be mulled over is whether decorating God with costly ornaments is necessary or not? To your surprise I would reply “yes that seems necessary”. To elucidate, normally God’s and Goddess are perceived as another ‘human’ super power and not as super power alone(why is that people don’t call Murugan as Mr.Murugan or add ‘inga’ at the tail) it is clear that   They observe Gods as living being  They assume themselves to be acquaintance for God.  Hope u would abide…  So what?   It is as simple as buying a necklace to your mom or a bangle to your wife. People want to give the best for the best and they are happy doing it. Why do we quarrel? .  To conclude ‘people are not offering ornaments thinking that they are doing good thing, it is not understood as an alternative to alms’. There is selfishness alone. It is like sharing your profit with your partner. He is offering a minor share to God because he thinks it is God who gave him that and not because he wanted to do something good.   To add few more points(forgive those who have faith). I would rather compare believers of God as Piggy backers. Yes people have two reasons to pray God   1.Thanks to good things  2. Rescue from bad things.    To my belief he himself is the cause for both. People say I get peace when I pray God. Of course when you shed your responsibility to some other person, you get peace of mind. So when I believe that it is because of me and I am the one to face it and set it right, so when I believe , my success is due to me; then why should I thank God who has done nothing.   I have the courage to confront issues. I am responsible for what has occurred to me. Only people who don’t accept this will accept God and that is what I call it as piggy backing. Ranjini advocated that spirituality has awarded this society with good things. Please tell me one at the least.. The sense of God has made man irresponsible. The first thing we do when something goes wrong is to find a person to blame or to find a reason to say ‘I am not the cause’.   Except mother nature I wouldn’t accept anything can be a cause other than us. Don’t argue now with a valid point ’aren’t you piggy backing on nature’ certainly no. I am talking about floods, sunlight..etc Please do not also argue that nature is created by God..etc   I am interested in asking you why do we need GOD? Rather than asking you is there a God?

      " if the poet "earns" millions with his poetry, what does he do with that.. does he admire the beauty of a million with costly furnishing of his house or does he also "intend" to utilise a portion of it for social activies..."    I don't know about the poets who earn millions  with their poetry.. But most of the true creators that i know were never after money and as a rule mostly they're indifferent towards "millions"..they seem to know the true function of money in human life and even if they care to take hold of money it has always been disowned by them in an act of generosity as against the planned spending of a Philanthropist towards feeding poor...! It' rare that a Poet who is sensitive to Life will ever try to become a dry Philanthropist..     In the same lines, what does the religionist/spiritualist do apart from his material manifestation of his inward vision... what steps does he take to help lesser fortunate ones also enjoy such a spectacle... shouldn't they enjoy too..??    In manifesting his inward vision, a true religionist/spiritualist gives Himself entirely(what else we can expect ) to the Highest which is the goal of  humanity and he knows that the Problem of  hunger and strife cannot be solved by Philanthrophy until humanity changes itself radically..and works in colloboration with the Divine Will in uplifting humanity from it's present animal moulds to the next levels..and his way of working is itself a  living art and to appreciate any true art requires discipline and training..and this natural discipline can be accessed by all who're in touch with Indian spiritual tradition...   And... just a curious question... What is the purpose of God...??    That depends what's understood by God..? One has to go thru' different conceptions and notions of God before one can truly know what it is..   - Srini

      Whatever it may be, The person who earns millions due to his efforts (poems, films, science whichever way it shall be) can't be compelled to utilise his money for the social uplift. Its up to him to spend his money appropriately for the personal/human welfare coz its obvious that he cannot carry to his funeral.  Kishore, do you think those persons who donated thousands for the Ekadasi festival will provide the same to a NGO activity??? Certainly not... But those who have collected in the name of Ekadasi, Can spent the entire amount for NGO activity?... it also cant be, coz they have their own liabilities / willingness... so they have to be spend towards what its meant (What they mean) for... Even by spending in decorations also; they have given oppors to hundreds of people's time / work.  If we keep on questioning there is no end for it.  Its upto you in deciding how u spend your money.   Note:     Millions   stands for more than your basic need... But for some, basic need may be "Mercedes E-Class" No body cant question the same!!, unless he goes against from law for earning such an amount.

      I think I have tailed off the scope of my points.. let me make it clear...  Starting on a lighter note.. rini, my title was not "the hunger for beauty" but it was "The hunger of Beauty".. whatever it meant...  jax and ram, I meant to use "hunger" as a metaphor for any strife - which could be anything from a handicap to old age to anything under the sun... so there is no question of "motivating" beggars...    What practical purpose does the toil of a Poet / Author ..to bring a piece of good poetry really serve?   Very valid...!! But the question just begins at this place... if the poet "earns" millions with his poetry, what does he do with that.. does he admire the beauty of a million with costly furnishing of his house or does he also "intend" to utilise a portion of it for social activies... In the same lines, what does the religionist/spiritualist do apart from his  material manifestation of his inward vision ... what steps does he take to help lesser fortunate ones also enjoy such a spectacle... shouldn't they enjoy too..??   What practical purpose does our Living really serve? How does it helps to feed the hunger of the poor?    I may not be able to tell anything on the purpose of "our" living.. but atleast "my" living would certainly bring a satiating smile to as many faces that I can manage (not forgetting my family responsibilities)... that would be the purpose of "my" living...  And... just a curious question... What is the purpose of  God ...??

      I have mixed up a concotation of Javascript to solve Ranjini's suggestion. Now if you hover over the links in the recent posts section, the alternate title will display the nickname of the poster.  Take a look at Quod scripsi, scripsi. GO to any month in the archives. What abou the calendar present there. Can we use it here? Your ideas are welcome.

      First few Questions:   1. What practical purpose does the toil of a Poet / Author ..to bring a piece of good poetry really serve? 2. What practical purpose does the grandiose theory/discovery of a scientist really serve?   It seems we have answers for the above questions...and it's quite right also. But we're not becoming critical on a poet or a scientist...for the reason that we believe in their roles and the service they've done to the humanity.   The religionist/spiritualist is trying to manifest materially what he saw/arrived inwardly as much as the poet tries to manifest mentally what he saw/arrived inwardly..In a certain sense, the work of art  by a spiritualist is more practical and real than that of any poet/scientist...   It appears to me that the religion/spirituality evolved by Indian Tradition seems to have performed more powerful role/function in uplifting humanity than anything we know so far on this earth..Only that it works from different outlook than that of the modern..and missing which we raise doubts based on  the premise that 'it should function the way we (the modern) expect it to function?'   Before this grandiose outlook, all our fleeting doubts are not annihilated but enlightened and illumined..only if we care to embrace it!   To become more sincere in our questioning we can ask such questions to ourselves, because we know ourselves better than our tradition..and starting from oursleves may not be a bad idea.   1.What practical purpose does our  Living really serve? How does it helps to feed the hunger of the poor?     - Srini

      Hi,  25th post in the 13th day of the New year 2k4 from RamG...  First Sriprasath volunteered himself out of the blog group... All the best for his future endeavours... Second Colin made himself into the Infy BandWangon... All the best for his forecoming challenges...  This blog is regarding my mail accessibility... As I am in Cisco project our network is separated from infy's, so rarely I do check my infy mails during office hours... So pl. dont expect quick reply for those mails...  S, its an apt quote, quoted especially for people like us reg. commn..... Coming to "The hunger of Beauty", I also do agree that instead of spending crores in decorations and functions we can spend towards hunger, but it should remove poverty ultimately instead of motivating beggars to be lethargic coz nyway there is someone to give food...  Got lots of work... will come later  Cheers

      So Kicha, you say that free access alone would not bring communication, but instead it is up to the individual.   Maybe the factor is  willingness to participate . I feel that communication can take place only when people are willing to tell something akin to thinking out loud. If they wish that they want others to know something about thier life they will communicate. The 'something' I speak about could be anything: personal anecdotes, work-related, hobbies, in fact anything they wish to.  Amazingly I see extremes in communication. I find people who never speak at all in public are vehemont communicators in private. People you wish would close thier mouths for a few minutes never speak at all in an electronic conversation. Seems to be good topic for a research paper. Why does this anomaly occur?  Relating to the group/blog, a few point that Kicha made echoes my thoughts.  Now, consider in real life, a group of five are discussing. When after a time period, some one begins participating less and less in the discussion. The others try a couple of times to involve the person, but to no avail. Then they start ignoring the person. Has anyone seen an example of this in an electronic discussion?   More later,  P.S.  I am unable to access my postmark id from today morning. So I may not be able to mail anyone. If it starts working again, I'll resume the communications. Those in the know about Lifetree, I will mail you all later.

      Very thought-provoking quote... It does seem so true with respect to our blog and our group... But in this case the factors are not restricted to the access to communication medium alone... I can give quite a few names who do have unrestricted access to the medium but still are reluctant to participate...   Equal access to communication medium is a vital factor.. but not THE factor... a lot depends on the attitude of the person as well.. does he/she really want to get it going... if they do, they would try to eke out some time somewhere and participate even though they may not be as active as a few others.. but if they don't want to.. then give them months of unrestrcited access to hundreds of equivalent media and still u r not going to extract a word out of their mouth...

         The title has been adjusted/resized and padding added   Recent titles lists all post titles. But it is hard to identify the author. Currently, I am playing around Javascript to work out a method.   Padding added to the post, so that it does not touch the borders   Archives have ben changed to monthly. But I guess they may take some time to download, due to a large number of posts    Anyone else having any ideas, blog your suggestions. More changes are just round the corner.

      Just came across this quote. The quote is known as " urlLink Rushkoff 's Law of Media".   True communication can only occur between people with equal access to the medium in which the communication is taking place.  It set me thinking. I wonder how far this law or its implications can be true with respect to our blog and our group.

      A very good question. One I have pondered upon quite many times. I find it easy to drop money to a poor person than to drop in the church. At the same time, I wonder if I am doing right or wrong. Giving them money so that they can eat or allowing them to remain in drudgery. There is a Chinese proverb: Give a man a fish to eat; he'll not be hungry for a day. But teach him to fish, he'll never be hungry in his life This has always been a problem when I think of giving alms. So I usually avoid giving money. Instead, I try to give them clothes or other materials, rather than money. I am waiting to hear of anyone has faced such a dilemma.

      From rini's post..  The whole entrance was painted in gold...   This brings to my mind one more aspect of life and living that I often ponder... Its been a part of the Indian tradition (I'm not very aware of other ones), to have the idols of gods to be embossed with gold and jewellery costing to a few good deal of rupees... I truely wonder what big significance they might be having... a decoration is needed and a costly decoration might also be..   But why can't some portion of these be channelled towards the needy... The idols do look awesome and do give a serene feeling for all the spiritual hearts.. but I would prefer bread for a person on the steet rather than personal serenity...  A lot of temples and trusts taking care of such temples do have the practice of providing food and rendering a helping hand to a lot of people.. but still a very huge amount seems to be spent on the beautification of the temples and the idols which beyond a limit seems to serve no practical purpose...   Lord Venkateshwara in Tirupathi, wearing a diamond studded crown worth 50 lakh rupees sure looks wonderful and does give a refreshing feeling to all the thousands of people craving to have a peek at Him... But how does it help my hunger...

      My new year ! really good it was though with not much of hungama!   Yes, i wanted to take srini by surprise that night and so planned on 31st Dec afternoon to get some gifts for him.  ya, dint know what to buy as usual and so, planned to pay a visit to Gangarams book shop.  Actually Srini wanted to read Bharathiyar Kavithaigal and so i thought it would be better to gift him a book he had loved to read once.     But to my dismay, they said there wont be any Tamil books at Gangarams. My friend was supposed to join me over there for shopping. So while waiting there, slowly i browsed thru' the greeting card section of theirs. In the front panel i searched and searched and could not find even a single new year card for husband. i was getting still more irritated. But then suddenly when i was onlooking some post cards, i found some beautiful and exquisite post card pictures of Indian sculptures and temples. yes they were awesome and i was so impressed. Then i remembered that Srini wanted to make an album of such things. So stat, i bought some postcards and picked a beautiful album too for that. Decided, let me gift this album of cards for him!  Then when i went inside to other panels i could see so many new year cards, but dint buy any, coz i thought one of the post card was much better than those cards! So planned to convey my wish thru' that simple postcard!   Then my friend, she came and took me to higginbothams and to my joy, there i found the book i had wanted to gift to Srini! Yes, now i got book and an album for him. To add sweetness to the day, i bought some rosagullas @ K.C. Das    When i came home after shopping, i found Srini sitting at home hungry and angry?! since i dint inform where i had gone. Then i told i had been out for shopping. then we were chatting and rang to almost all his acquaintances and wished them. At dawn of new year, at 12 MN, we went upstairs to see the splendid crackers display in shivering cold weather at Leela Palace and gifted him my presents.    Think he liked! both book and album! Next day got his blessings and as usual went to office and  in the evening went to Domlur Perumal temple and wished for his blessings! Good did the first day of the year end.   I planned to take 2 resolutions, one was to practice dance and music daily for sometime in the morning which i am not able to do till date. The other one is to improve my reading habits, which i think i am doing regulalry.   On Saturday we went to ISKCON temple. Its was Ekadasi. In the entrance they had put a beautiful swing decorated with flowers and had laid the Ananda Sayanam(sleeping pose) of Lord vishnu with his mistress besides. The whole entrance was painted in gold and it was so splendid and serene to go under the foot of Lord at the entrance.    Spent almost a day there, since it was fully packed. But then since, they had very well organised, we dint feel the pain of waiting. Then in the evening went to Leela Palace, did little bit of bowling, but to my dismay i could not even touch even a single pin how so ever i bowl.  So did the first week of the year end with pleasant events and happenings. This how was my new year!

       A decade old dream was about to come true, A four year craving about to be satisfied. I shifted my weight to position my body better in the chair. The room was dark. As the screen began to clear from black, I was high. The music, haunting yet uplifting filled my ears. The next three hours was the ride of my life, my emotions riding a rollercoaster. At the end, I felt as if I had lost a good companion.  '  The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King  ' - Seems to be a lofty pompous name for the title of a movie. The book was a wonderfully scripted work of art. The movie went one better. It brought the book to life. There are critics who say that Peter  Jackson has taken some liberties with the book in the movie. They always say that. Even personally, I was disappointed by the absence of Christopher Lee as  Saruman .  Setting those things apart,  LOTR:ROTK  was a rich feast. A feast for everyone. There was quite a lot of technical wizardry behind each frame in the movie. The locations were a treat to watch. It is difficult to believe that places like these really exist. The extensive sets, especially  Minas Tirith  was breathtaking.   The characterisation were so beautiful. The transformation of Smegol into Gollum, which formed the introduction, was just a prelude to what was to come. The beautiful picturisation of the  The battle sequences, Osilogarth and the siege of Minas Tirith were not as long as the battle of Helm's Deep in  TTW . Yet they were a showcase of amazing battle scenes.   The yearning of Eowyn for Aragorn was subdued in the movie, but Tolkien's strongest woman character was just reduced to mouthing insipid dialogues and brandishing a pretty little sword. The funnny thing about the movie was that the bad guys were not given any importance. They just came and left without much ado. The scene where Faramir goes to battle against all odds was touching, but the sub-plot was jarring.   The music score by James Horner was totally amazing. Must try to get the soundtrack of the movie. This movie is definitely worth watching more than a couple of times.   Totally I was satisfied with the trilogy, not like the Matrix trilogy. The movies were enhanced by technology, not dependent on it like the Matrix trilogy.   I have planned on taking a day off and watching the LOTR trilogy back to back. Go and see it. I wonder what Tolkien would have said if he could see his beloved Middle Earth come to life in the movies.

      jax, I too think the positioning of the name of the author doesn't look appealing despite its logically correct placing... may be, the "by jax" could be aligned with the title and time of post appearing a little below it or below the post...   The font also could have been smaller by design rather than requiring adjustments to IE Text options.. may be some other standard font like arial with a lesser size might be handy.. check on that...

      Over the past three days, I watched the following movies. Here are my reviews of the movies.    urlLink  The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King   I guess I need not give a gist of the story. The movie warrants a detailed post. I'll put it later.    urlLink  The Hunted   In the green woods of Silver Falls, Oregon, Aaron Hallam, a trained assassin AWOL from the Special Forces, keeps his own brand of wildlife vigil. After brutally slaying four deer hunters in the area, FBI Special Agent Abby Durrell turns to L.T. Bonham-- the one man who may be able to stop him. At first L.T. resists the mission. Snug in retirement, he's closed off to his past, the years he spent in the Special Forces training soldiers to become skilled murderers. But when he realizes that these recent slayings are the work of a man he trained, he feels obligated to stop him. Accepting the assignment under the condition that he works alone, L.T. enters the woods, unarmed--plagued by memories of his best student and riddled with guilt for not responding to Aaron's tortured letters to him as he began to slip over the edge of sanity. Furious as he is with his former mentor for ignoring his pleas for help, Aaron knows that he and L.T. share a tragic bond that is unbreakable. And, even as they go into their final combat against each other, neither can say with certainty who is the hunted and who is the hunter.   My comments :  It was wonderful. Can watch it more than once. This movie reminds me of David Morrell's works. It was ironic, reading a novel and watching a movie that were so similar.     urlLink  Confidence  : A con man gets into big trouble when unknowingly tries to scam an accountant that works for a mafia kingpin. Now, he has to pull off yet another scam to pay the mafia off before they get tired and decide to "collect their losses." Confidence is one of those heist films with plenty of twists, a lot of characters who are guaranteed to back stab at least once and flashy direction to put everything together. It is quite clear that by the end of the movie.   My comments :  It was interesting, humorous and twisting. Can watch it once or twice (if you like the dialogues).     urlLink  The Identity  :  Caught in a savage rainstorm, ten travelers are forced to seek refuge at a strange desert motel. They soon realize they've found anything but shelter. There is a killer among them and, one by one, they are murdered. As the storm rages on and the dead begin to outnumber the living, one thing becomes clear: Each of them was drawn to the motel, not by accident or circumstance, but by forces beyond imagination, forces that promise anyone who survives a mind-bending and terrifying destiny...   My comments :  It was a nice thrilling horror movie. Can watch it once.     Ennaku 20 Unnakku 18 : I guess this film does not need any story line.    My comments :  Yet another copy of Serendipity. The only best thing about the movie was the music. There were mistakes galore in the movie as expected from a Tamil film.     Janasheen : The newspapers seemd to say the movie was good. So this was my first Hindi movie for quite sometime. I don't know what the title means. Maybe someone can elucidate on it.    My comments :  It was a typical Hindi masala film. The usual baddies, songs in foreign locations, fights ad romances and infuriating makeup and dresses. THe one thing I liked in the movie was the bike race. It was filmed beautifully. I don't know if it was an archived footage or it was shot for the movie.

      i just noticed it now, when u r in the middle of the page, then the posted by X at the top of the blog confuses, since there is no proper demarcation to tell where the blog ends, its hard to define whether it belongs to the next post or to the previous post. so cant we have a single line to end the blog?   About fonts, ofcourse its good to use normally used fonts but then i say its not fitting properly and each font look unique in its own way and not setting into the blog whole heartedly. so fit them jax.  And yes, i think everybody would have noticed the layout change, but then not much interested, since they are more contented with content i believe.   There is an article about Anna Karenina in  urlLink Elite-essays  blog. Those who are interested can have a look to know about the novel which i am reading now.  Apart from jax and kicha, y rnt u people talking about new year celebrations, resolutions, predictions? i will join the bandwagon soon, probably next week! till then little bit busy!

      The CROSS  A young man was at the end of his hope, seeing no way out, he dropped to his knees in prayer &#34;Lord, I can&#39;t go on,&#34; he said. &#34;I have too heavy a cross to bear&#34; The Lord replied, &#39;My son, if you can't bear its weight, just place your cross inside this room. Then, open that other door and pick out any cross you wish.&#39; The man was filled with relief and said, &#39;Thank you Lord,&#39; and he did as he was told.  Upon entering the other room, he saw many crosses; some so large the tops were not visible. Then, he spotted a tiny cross leaning against a far wall. &#34;I'd like that one, Lord,&#34; he whispered. The Lord replied, &#34;My son, that is the cross you just brought in.&#34;

      After eight days, someone has noticed that the layout has changed.  Coming to Ranjini's points:     Font Sizes :  I feel an explanation for the font size is required. I have used 'em' as a font size measurement. An 'em' is the size that a capital em, 'M' occupies on your screen. This is a relative unit of measurement. If you resize your text size, using the "View > Text Size" option in IE or "Control + or Control -" in Mozilla browsers, the text size reduces or enlarges. This is not possible when a fixed measurement unit like pixels are used. I'll reduce them as requested.    Font Style :  Different fonts were used only to distuinguish between items like Dates, Titles and Posts. A serif font like Times New Roman or Georgia is used for the Date. Sans-serif fonts like Verdana, Arial, Trebuchet are used for the rest of the items. Since the fonts installed in a system may differ from user to user, I have used only the common fonts.    Style Switcher : The Style Switcher is ready. But I didn't want to put it up till I got this stylesheet ready. Since any changes made in this will be reflected there, I decided to wait a little bit.    Archives : Since I was using an unordered list, they appear as a really long list. Monthly archives seems to be a good idea as you had suggested. Will try and see how that works. I had an idea of using a archive section just like the one you see when you login into blogger. But it would take some little programming work in Javascript. If any of our prog. geniuses can help me out, it would be really wonderful.    Blogrolling : Actually, I was thinking of eliminating it. The current blogrolling section is an external script called from  urlLink Blogrolling . Since Javascript slows down the page a little bit, I was thinking of transferring everything to a manually maintained link. This would also allow everyone to have a list of favorite links/bookmarks. Need to discuss about this in detail.   Other minor corrections are in place. This is a work in progress as I had mentioned in my post. So  WYSTMNBWYST .

      sorry this oops has got nothin to do with Object orientation, but about my earlier blog on layout. ye, the blog rolling is there and it was a refreshing problem i believe which dint make a proper display of all the links.! so, good that u still hold the good old blog rolling!

      No, its not as good as the old one. this is what i said when we switched from b/w to colors right! so though i say this now i have a tell, that we can groom it to a better layout.  So, here is my feed back about the layout sir!  1. title: too big and it is, as it touches the blogspot ad and looks awkward. so can be reduced a bit. All together the layout has got a funky look i believe. 2 Recent posts title is too bold and even the day and date is not appealing. All the fonts look coarse to me. no smooth finish it has got. cant we polish the fonts a bit? Cant we stick to one particular type of font, rather than experimenting with many number of fonts? 3. the box in which our blog content lies: Grey background is good, but the letters touching the margin looks as if we are trying to stuff more in less space which can be avoided by giving enough padding. 4. Switch styles is not working and so pls. do look into it. Infact i dont use it much, but then since i wasnt that impressed by the layout, i thought lemme switch to different style, but to my dismay it dint work. 5. Since the archive section is a weekly one, its taking a long space and cant we switch to monthly archive from now on. Anyway we have search blog option which will help us to retrieve required info based on date or content and so i dont feel it necessary to maintain the archives to be done weekly. Monthly will do. 6. no links under blog rolling. what happened to that? i cant switch between the blogs just i do before. i want that back now immediately. how can u remove it without asking us? atleast me! 7. And the box of declaration can be had in the side bar as its now. it looks good! 8. y contact alone is not in pink as other links like home, about etc in the menu bar below the title?  Hmmmmmmmmm........ as such only this much i have to say about the layout, fix these if u feel they ought to be else, .........  And sorry guys for not being active for the past few days. Got some work at our office and these days i am spending my time in reading a fantastic novel........ Yes its by a famous russian author! can u people guess it?Yes, its Anna Karenina. Really if i say i have read a book worth a read all of my life time, then this is going to be one of them. Yes, i am in Part two and its so huge and its so alluring that its the only entertainment for me at office these days. yes, i dont own that book, but read it online! Its so so interesting that i have almost given up the art of mailing or blogging, except if needed.   My thoughts about the book, yes ofcourse i am planning to post a review of each part from next week. Its a big novel which runs into 9 parts and so many pages. Let me see if i can or not! Since i am not a pace rider on books like jax, i cant finish off in a week's time and i read it online in between my work to relax myself. but then, coz i love to read this book, i dont want to finish off soon too........  Ok meet u all with reviews and my new year resolutions in forth coming blogs.  bye for now!

      After Sachin Tendulkar held a catch at deep square leg he had just run a few paces when he stopped and with a hitherto unseen uniformity started clapping his hands... and so did everyone in the Indian cricket team and so did the entire 40,000+ audience at the Sydney Cricket Ground... for, he had just sounded the final gong to draw to the close a legacy... a legacy called Steve...  Stephen Rodger Waugh had a rather ordinary start to his career with 18 runs in his first test.. little did he think that he would play for that many more years to come... He was not a naturally gifted batsman as his brother Mark, but he had his own imaculate style and an indomitable grit that won many a lost match for his team.  The world called him the "ice man" when as a young 21 year old lad he bowled splendid emotionless spells to help his team win the '87 World Cup... But the real steel in him came out in the 1995 away series in West Indies.. where he braved some fierce bowling and stood ground with a finely carved century to beat the Windies in a series for the first time in over a decade...  When he took over the mantle from Mark Taylor, he had already a strong team at his disposal... all he had to do was to continue the momentum set by his predecessor.. but he had a rather sombre start drawing against West Indies... his captaincy drew flak from the media... but it was not before long that they had to eat their own words...  He has always been seen by the cricketing fraternity as a man for the crisis... The unbeaten 120 against South Africa in the '99 World Cup, is probably the best One Day innings I ever watched live... and his famous words to Gibbs when he dropped him in the middle that innings "mate, you've just dropped the World Cup" is still etched in every mind.. Steve could never have been so true.. Gibbs did drop the world cup...  He was class apart from his other counterparts.. his personal definition of the so-called Aussie sledging was different... neither does he have the theatrical histrionics of Brett Lee when he takes a wicket nor has he ever been as noisy as their "famous" slip cordon... When Ganguly was hit on the head by Lee... amid a lot din from the slip cordon he went close and asked "Are u fine Saurav..?"..   He also did his bit of parenting too... when the little kid, Parthiv Patel's typical adolescent gimmick at him made him softly tell "Learn to show respect, Parthiv. You were in nappies when I started playing"... just like he would advise his son...  The greatness of this man is not just on the field... But he has done his bit with the Udayan foundation in Kolkota that takes care of the orphans and children of lepers.. one could see the glow in every child's eyes there as Steve pays his routine visit.. the banner "We love you Steve" held by a small girl when he stepped in, says it all about him...  A cricketer par excellence and a human beyond the ordinary... The sun might have set.. but the shine remains...

      Here are a couple of books I read last week.  "Along Came A Spider" was my first James Patterson novel. It was also his first novel featuring Alex Cross. Though the novel was not that great in terms of the storyline, the characterisation was impeccable. Those characters were totally real-life. I loved it. The book was an amalgam of a kidnapping story, multiple murders and psychos with a few insanely infuriating twists thrown in. It was made into a movie, starring Morgan Freeman as Alex Cross. Now I am looking forward to meeting Alex Cross in "Kiss The Girls".  David Morrell's "Testament" began with the line,"It was the last morning the four of them would ever be together." After that it was one of the most shocking story of what it means to be hunted. For journalist Reuben Bourne the nightmare begins when he breaks a promise to cast a paramilitary white supremacy group in a favorable light-a fateful decision that will shatter his life. A basically peaceful man with a paradoxical attraction for violence, Reuben suddenly faces an enemy driven by an obsessive, unrelenting hate. Now to survive this ordeal, he must lead his family on a desperate flight into the wilderness-a world as harsh and unforgiving as the fanatics who hunt him. The story has a totally unexpected shocking ending. I really did not expect the novel to end like that.

      The desert is never dead. Life is always present. Thouugh it may not be visible on the surface, it is ever present beneath it. The seasons keep changing but the order in which they arrive never change at all.  Some planters might have left, some biding time. As they should know by now, there is a time for sowing and a time for reaping. And there is always a time between reaping and sowing. Perhaps it is that time now...  awaiting the rain to fall...

      It was an interesting patch of land. Initially, there was not much to say about the lengthy strip.. no one knew it could ever be of some use to someone in the first place... then,  time moved on and there were some early planters who observed this barren patch could be of some use to them.. and they started planting.. but with a little caution at first...   It did not take much time for them to realise the potential that lay buried underneath this scratchy surface... they just had to wait a little longer to see the richness in their hands.. just as the good people that they were... they took this exciting discovery to the outside world.. and soon there were more planters and more richness coming their way... people learnt the secret of differentiating wasteland from rich land.. and inturn succeeded in finding more such lands and more planation and more cultivation and more richness and more prosperity...  As the days moved on.. the initial patch of land seemed a sensation no more.. for it was not the only thing around now.. there were many such... the people sure were growing richer but this land that was the first of its kind and a noble servant for a handful of planters now seemed to be losing its lustre.. its initial discoverers have seen more of its kind and have too much already to think about and are in no big ideas patting this patch as they did in the early days...  It now needs some real "change" to make this already semi-arid desert into the lush fertile terrain that everyone loves...  If u understand what I'm talking......

      It felt that someone had hit the replay button. Last year started in sickness. This year, it was a repeat. Spending the day at home sick is no fun indeed.   The beginning of a new year, the air abuzz with enthusiasm and eagerness for the new year. The first time I went out in the new year was to relatives’ and friends’ homes. That was my only sojourn for the next couple of days. By late evening, I was sick and bed-ridden. Memories of the previous year flashed across my mind.   It was ironic. New Year’s Eve, I was standing in the church braving the elements, while my friend nearby complained it was cold and wore a jacket. Twenty hours later, it was my turn to shiver in the cold.  The next couple of days were spent indoors. Unlike last year, I didn’t have to suffer much. Just a feeling of frustration on not being able to go about my regular chores pervaded my thoughts.   For the first time in almost three days, I emerged out on Saturday, planning to spend sometime in the sunshine. It was not meant to be. The skies were gloomy and dark. Rain looked certain. So I returned home with a mood as black as the skies above. Another day gone in the new year. I had not even done anything worthwhile yet. Is it the shape of thing to come this year?   Three days later, yesterday was really the first day of the year for me. I went out to play early morning in the cold, protected from the chill by a thick windcheater. A good couple of hours play brought back the vigor for the new year.   Somehow, I have put the past few days behind me. Now let us see how the new year is going to turn out to be.

      It was a wonderful new year day for me. Simply because, I did nothing all day.. and yet did a lot of things...!!  The previous night, I went to a hotel with my house-mates and we were up there at the stroke of new year.. and came back home around 1.30AM... slept a few minutes later and woke up early in the morning at 9AM...  It was a holiday for me... Everyone else had left for work... and there was no cricket on TV to bring out the couch potato in me.. I was all alone at home.. all to myself... I relished the sound of a staggering silence... there was a calm I never experienced in a long time.. the solitude was ecstatic... I spent time in bed introspecting on my recent past few years.. sequels of my disappointments, successes, promises, thought-waves reeled in front of my eyes... I praised my triumphs, thanked for my achievements, prayed over my failures and chuckled my naughty nit-wits..  I sat with the "Speedpost" book and started reading a few pages... and that only added to the already brimming delight... the way Shoba De had described her childhood and the comparision to her children's childhood sent ripples of thought of my childhood... its amazing how mothers could be so similar...  we do owe a lot to this gracious species called mother...   It was late in the evening when I finally decided to peep into what the idiot box had in store for me... as I switched on... MTV was up, and I saw a black-and-white picture of a railway station, where Palash (of  Euphoria ) was standing with his guitar... that brought a wide smile to my face.. one of my favorite songs was just starting... "Mai Re"  by Euphoria ... and the song kept up its hum all through that evening as I looked up to drawing the line on one of the most blissful days of my life...   How better to start a new year...!!

      Hi,  I had an sudden impulse to redesign QSS. Tell me how the new design looks. Also I find some funny behaviour by the site. Once the page is loaded, you might find that the right side bar has a lot of padding. Just move you mouse over any link on the page. The extra padding disappears.   When I checked, this particular behaviour appears only in Internet Explorer. In Firefox, the website appears normal. Anyone else having such problem, send me a screenshot and the browser version you are using. If possible, send the screen resolution also.   Bye,  P.S. Bala, you left out Russia. There are more millionaires in Russia than Hong Kong, when compared to to ecomoic scenario prevailing in the country. (Compare thier GDPs)

      Thank you so much Jax,  Its a well written article on RSS & NA,  Not more than this one could ask from a Content developer, Gud and thankx.  Yeah sure, I have to install a news aggregator in my system for segregating web articles... will contact you soon regarding that, slightly busy nowdays.  I think, u were regularly visiting "my  urlLink Thoughts " page, and got fed up with out any updates and ultimately found out a tool for automatic request for viewing modified webpages...  Cheers

       All of us might have been visiting the blog on a regular basis, maybe once or twice a day to see if there are any new posts. Probably you might be opening up your favorite web browser and typing the url to visit the blog. Similarly there might be quite lot of things you might be accessing regularly everyday like news headlines, site updates, blogs etc. Let me explain with my own experiences.  I visit almost thirty-odd websites every day. The list contain websites, magazines, news headlines, and web logs. It is difficult to remember each site. So I bookmark these sites and visit them. Most of the time, I find that not all sites are updated regularly. A couple of sites are updated more than once in a day and some sites once in two days. There is no way of knowing which sites are updated and which are not. Imagine opening up nearly forty websites and finding that only four or five of them have been updated. Consider the costs involved in terms of time and bandwidth. It is huge.  News Aggregators:  This is where aggregators step in. My news aggregator helps me keep up with all my favorite sites by checking if they are updated and displaying the new items from each of them. Now I find that my news aggregator can find and classify them so that I get to read the latest items. I thereby get to save my time and bandwidth.  There are several type of aggregators available. Web based aggregators like  urlLink my Yahoo!  and  urlLink myFeedster  collect information and display them in a webpage. Aggregators are also available as standalone applications. They are also integrated into e-mail clients and web browsers.  A search on Google reveals numerous aggregators. You can choose one that suits you. I use " urlLink RSS Reader Panel " with  urlLink Mozilla FireFox 0.8 . Since the aggregator integrates into the web browser, I find it very easy to find sites that have been updated using it.   How do aggregators know which and when sites have been updated?  The answer is through an XML-based format known as RSS.  What is RSS?  RSS is an XML-based format that is used for  syndicating  news and the content of news-like sites, including major news sites like BBC, news-oriented community sites like Slashdot, and personal weblogs.   But it is not limited to news alone.  urlLink Mark Pilgrim  says that "anything that can be broken down into discrete items can be syndicated via RSS". He cites examples like the "recent changes" page of a wiki, a changelog of CVS checkins, even the revision history of a book. Once information about each item is in RSS format, an RSS-aware program (read aggregator) can check the feed for changes and react to the changes in an appropriate way.  RSS feeds:  An RSS feed is an XML file that is available on the webserver just like a HTML page. Once a feed is available for a website, and aggregator can visit the file and perform the required action. A feed contains a list of items, each of which is identified by a link. Each item can have any amount of metadata associated with it. Metadata usually consists of a title and a description about it. It can also have infomation like the publisher of the feed, the date it was updated and other metadata items.  Versions of RSS:  There are several formats of RSS currently available. Lots of heated discussions have been going on about which format is the better format. Even the expansion of RSS is a bone of contention among various people.   Atom, the new kid on the block:  Recently, several people have been pushing forward for a better and enhanced RSS format called Atom. This project has gained acceptance among major CMS and blogging clients, including Blogger and Movable Type. Several RSS aggregators have begun supporting Atom and the list is expanding regularly.   In case you have more doubts,  urlLink this tutorial  will help you to understand the basics of RSS. Several real-life examples of RSS are given in  urlLink this website .   In case you want me to choose a RSS aggregator for you, I can help you out. Your comments and feedback are welcome.

      Rini, can you enable the Atom feed in all the blogs you post? Just like I did for 'All in a day's work!' You can find it in the blog setting under feeds. Since you don't mention that you have posted in them, I have to visit each one in sequence. If you enable the feeds, I'll know whenever you update them. And I can visit them. What do you say?  Ram, I'll reply to your query on RSS soon. I am collecting info on them.

        Fee-cut will weaken IIMs: Narayana Murthy, Banga   Murthy was speaking to the press along with Hindustan Lever Chairman M S 'Vindi' Banga. The two corporate stalwarts, along with marketing consultant Rama Bijapurkar, said that IIMs are not elitist.   Banga said: "Nearly 18 per cent of the IIM students are from the families whose annual income is below Rs 150,000. Another 60 per cent have a household income of below Rs 500,000. Only 22 per cent of the students come from families whose annual income is above Rs 500,000. So to say that IIM is catering to only the elite is wrong."  "The government should not spend more on students who would be earning much more," Murthy said, adding that the average salary of an IIM-Ahmedabad graduate was about Rs 825,000 and the loan for fees could be repaid by the student easily in a couple of years.  Describing the Union HRD ministry's decision as unilateral, Banga said there were a number of stakeholders who should be involved in the process. He noted that IIM-A was promoted by the central government, Gujarat government and corporates.  "There are 45 million children in India who don't go to school. There are 350 million illiterate people and in every rural school of our country there is just one teacher for two classes. So instead of reducing IIM fees, we should pay more attention to those things in our country. I mean we should not rob the poor and pay the rich," Murthy added.

      How often have u thought of times in your past when u had a habit.. a trait... that drew a lot of attention from ur peers... things that used to be so natural for u but very unseen for most others and that had even become a mark of identification for u... sometimes you were known more by those acts rather than yourself... Years hence, it would look as funny for ourselves as it was for the others in those days...   How often have u tried re-enacting some acts... that blows an inexplicable air of nostalgia taking us back to our "good old days" for a few moments... and at times becomes a revelation to us about ourselves as to how we have changed over the years... and may be teach us a lesson or two...   Sometimes.. it pays to ponder the past...

Ofcourse Kicha is right.. but moving as per the standards is quite difficult.. after proj. delivery for the sake of maintaining the level one completes the process on time b4 the actual Audit... (ha ha ha)  Anyway its really really helpful during future review...!!! :)  Cheers

      Good to see Rini involving in a lot of non-technical aspects of work.. these "paper-work" are so much important in the paperless offices of these days... there's really so much to gain in defining a proper methodology and standards and sticking to it during the various phases of a project execution... It sometimes feels a nuisance to do a lot of homework for a seemingly trivial task.. but in the long run when XYZ needs to work on something that was done a few years back.. such standardization is going to be a boon to that guy...   Such models do not just provide an organized way of working but also a sustainably efficient process that aid in optimized usage of time and reduction in cost...

      Actually we are going to implement it soon and our road map shows that we will be level 3 certified , 9 months from now. But it reaaaaaaaaallly needs lots of sweat on our part to stick to the road map, coz that road map is for organisations which are having enough resources and are following some processes atleast. But in our case, since our department is not full fledged and is in a developing stage and also not many process areas identified, i mean u can consider we dont have ODSP at all which CMM suggest. So just imagine about starting from scratch, where in i was even asked to prepare a template for making a proposal for a project and need to prove the rational behind every element in the template.   Ofcourse, we do have some standard templates like those provided by IEEE (Institution of Electrical Engineers) but then still, it needs to be customised to our company and thats where the entire work goes in. Atleast i am happy that we have some references like that of IEEE.  The next few months is probably till mid April, its going to be Process definition and the rest to follow is process implementation. and mind u, this is additional work, which we have to perform along with our regular work load. But then as all transition demands exra work, we see to it with new hopes of much regulated and consistent way of working, to deliver a quality product.   Ofcourse i would also like to talk to you people about the kind of exposure to certain project management issues too in course of time. Yes, i will also keep you updated of how a company moves in different stages when it tries to reach further. Esp. a small company like ours which has a very meagre or no presence i can say in pure s/w projects,  must have proper vision to see where we are heading towards. And i think, our seniors have thought over it and so we are getting equipped ourselves to meet any kind of project in railway signalling domain in forthcoming days.   Ok guys will share more in days to come. but then what happened to other bloggers? Looking glum for quiet sometime........ Anyway, if u people are taking a bit of rest, before u shower us with all kind of posts, then i wait for it with glee.  till then bye!

      It has been some time since I had posted anything here. I had been caught up in work, both at office and at home. Somehow I managed to get some time to try and structure QSS.   One thing I have done is to remove the movie and book information from the main page. So now visitors will not see posts that are about the movies I had watched and the books I have read. They will instead be listed under 'Recent Reads' and 'Recently Watched'. But even this might change soon.   It is really a pain in the neck trying to fit all information in a single page. Maybe  urlLink this  might help.   Rini, Your post was a refresher course in CMM. So when do you plan for CMM?  Till the next post,

      The Capability Maturity Model for Software (also known as the CMM and SW-CMM) is a model for judging the maturity of the software processes of an organization.   A process, which involves all the operations in an organisation dealing with software projects starts from the time, a quotation or proposal is made for acquiring the project to the end/closure of the project.   A process is sequential, and is also augmented with parallel flows of operation across various process areas (popularly known as Key Process Areas or KPAs shortly) of an Organisation's process.   There are Five levels which are talked about in CMM. Each level indicative of the level of evolution of the process in terms of its maturity. Maturity here by means, the ability or capability (how well )of the process to handle the variations in the process. Hence forth CM stands for Capability Maturity in the Model.  The first level is " Initial " level, where in the organisation is not having any define process.  The second level is " Repeateable " level, where in there are some best practices followed or process is defined, but its not same for all the projects. These processes, since are found to be effective, are repeated for the forthcoming projects, but remember, still its not a standard ( means, a process which is used across the organisation).   If a company is in level three, then it means, they have a defined ODSP (Organisation Defined Software Process) which can be understood from the very expansion of it that, there will be only one process, with enough flexiblity to contain any kind of project the company wishes to undertake. Once this ODSP is defined, then PDSP (Project Defined Software Process) is tailored from this ODSP. Obviously level three is about " Defining "  Defining a process i mean here, is to write a set of procedures for handling the KPA's in a process and create the necessary templates like a Quotation template, Project plan template, Requirement Analysis Report template, Architectural Design document template, Detailed Design Document template, Design plan template, Code review report template, Test plan template, test report template, Acceptance report template etc. and so on.   Along with this, guidelines which help us in taking decisions regarding the design like different life cycle models, and others like different project estimation techniques, and guidelines for good coding, standard coding practices etc. are also evolved and they are bundled together to form a process. And traceablity of all these across the process is also maintained. Traceablity here by i mean the ablity to tell, what gave rise to what. Yes, for eg. Software Requirement Specification  will be derived from Customer Requirement Specification . similarly, Detailed design is made of Architectural and Requirement specs, etc. So a link across all the affected documents is also made explicitly known, for the sake of maitaining consistency and hence quality of the product deliverded.  Since we have a process defined now, its tailored or customised for a project. for eg. we might have a maintenance project where there is no development phase at all. so we will tailor the ODSP to contain parts which will contain maintenance related KPAs and ignore others.   This is about an organisation at level three.   Now in level 4 and 5 we try to do what?yes, we try to improvise on the process defined.  Yes, in Level 4 which says about " manageable " process, we try to enhance the process by using some statistical tools like control chart for measuring the deviations, Use CPM / PERT method for detecting the critical time required for completion of project , what guys if u were attentive in some OM classes, i think u can easily track what i am talking about, if not dont worry, u can always learn them once u start managing projects. In level 4, these tools are used to fine tune, what are called " Assigned causes of variation ". These are variations, which are explicit and whose causes can be assigned to one particular cause and is static.   Obviously in level 5, they try to attack " Random Causes of Variation "  (a clear pciture of which i can be able to give, when we get level 5 i believe) and hence " optimise " the process!   ........................................................................................................  wondering why i wrote this? yes, last week i was in CMM training, since we are aspiring to be in level three, few months from now. And since we dont have a ODSP, we (a team of just 8, with, to be honed skills) are trying to evolve a process. Surprising isn't it? And so, will be busy in writing procedures, creating templates, gathering guidelines and what not, which is going to be absolutely interesting as i can see. Thought would give u guys a flavor, how Level 5 companies work and  what they did to achieve this.  To learn more about this, click  urlLink SEI-CMM   Ok then, back to local settings, yes,  Jax, wish you a very happy 25th b'day!   And hope to see u guys giving some inputs on latest Technology too. Bye for now

      Y do u think...  spirtuality would not come with splendour???  Moreover, Meditation coincides with Divinity... coz.. both leads you to Bliss...   Jax, gud... when can we have our Annual day celebration?...  coming to Excellent effort by our HRD ministry:  Although the right to speech / express ur views are allowed in a democratic nation, I dont think coming out with points like kicha has mentioned is _____ ....... It seems to be very hypothetical...  Before commenting something we should take into consideration of what really we are meaning...  May be / Not IIM Fee cut reduces its quality output / input... Actually coming into consideration of loans... Banks provide loans only if u do have a high security...  And, Let us know first what the IIMs really do with the huge amount it receives now from the students as well from grants...  and how the fee slash is going to affect its performance .... after that let us start our arguements / discussion...  if u see, CDAC, C-DOT, ISRO, DOS, Military (Most of the PSU) are paying less for their employees compared to outside private units... do you feel any quality lack in it???

      Meditation is just a process that leads to a state of consciousness that brings serenity, clarity, and bliss... And just that and nothing more than that...!! It has got no direct correlation with God or divinity, but only that the meditater could use his new-found bliss for any good things that he may ascertain to take up... and in his views "good things" may encompass spirituality...   The reason why meditation finds links to Godliness is more because the "teachers" of meditation find no other better way to attract people to this amazing art... after all, in the name of God, people are even ready to do things non-sensical to the common sense... this stems from the homegrown "fear" of God... and the attitude of bargain -  get me passed in the exam and I would break 108 coconuts  (as though God asked for it)...  Often, meditation also finds links with religiousness rather than spirituality... and these days the former takes root at the expense of the latter... A reason for the Srirangam tragedy (where 40 people, mostly women and children, were burnt in a marriage hall) was given that  "the temple failed to perform a vital ritual and such a tragedy was always on the cards" ... Rubbish..!! Would the "holy" person dare utter this line if he was a victim's kin...!! He would rather be better off trying to help the victims if he can or else keep his mouth shut...!!!! Another classic example of spirituality lost in splendour is the ISKCON temple in Bangalore... that seems to be growing into a market place rather than a spiritual avenue...  The contemporary "teachers" of meditation are no different... they use this "fear" of God to inculcate this practice... except a few organizations, quite a few are more interested in the business of teaching meditation rather than the service of helping people find peace...

      A year of blogging. One year! I cannot believe it. Exactly 12 months ago, I came across this new phenomenon that was spreading across the web. The phenomenon was called   blogging  . Actually, I was searching for something else. The concept of blogging seemed wonderful. Posting one's thoughts to the web immediately. It was a kind of a diary/journal. Online, accessible from anywhere by anyone.   Then I took some time to understand what it was all about. I came across several wonderful blogs. The concept had been taken to great heights by several of those I had come across. Then came an idea of having a team blog. But before that I needed to have a sandbox to play around. 'All in a day's work!' became that sandbox. For a couple of weeks, I made myself comfortable with the concepts of blogging.  Soon by the end of last February, ' All in a day's work! ' was let loose with the help of three more members. Soon others joined, the ranks swelled. Overall, it has been a tremendous year with lots of things learnt and discussed.  What was your experience? Tell me what was it like?

       It was ghost&rsquo;s time on Saturday night when I called up Sumathy and told her  &ldquo;I am planning to go to Dhianalinga temple tomorrow morning&rdquo; . As like you, she was also taken aback. With sumi&rsquo;s perseverance I got up by 4&rsquo; O clock. When I started my vehicle it was 6 sharp. Except 2 or 3 milk vala&rsquo;s and five to six buffaloes I am the only awaken living being. Filling my tummy with a tumbler of milk and my bike with 3 litres of fuel, I raised my throttle.     Dhianalinga  was erected at the foothills of vellingiri. Mind started expecting too much as it does always. I Imagined myself driving in to the deep woods with BSA Slr advt lion crossing the other side. Cool breeze ended up in drizzling.I became a bit confused when I was unable to select BPL Mobile, my home network itself. Later I realized it was BPL Mobile, Kerala and not Tamilnadu. Only when I quivered, I found tat the road beneath is of stones and not tar. For sure I am out of Coimbatore.Other than twice to reaffirm the direction, I gave my victor no chance to have a deep breathe.   Thou enthused by the travel,  &ldquo; IS IT WORTH IT? &rdquo;  clouded my mind. The second my wheels touched the mud road, the environment was immediately painted with green. At one moment a big crow crossed my head from left to right. Only after applying the brakes to check how big is the crow, I found tat it is not a crow but a peacock. &ldquo;Peacock and lion both are wild animals&rdquo; I told myself and added more value to my travel.  When I stopped by a tea shop and asked for &lsquo;dhianlinga temple&rsquo; eyebrows raised and exclaimed &ldquo;who sent u in this direction?&rdquo; Annoyed, I was about to turn my way back. Bulb glowed in my brain when I heard &ldquo;only Siva temple is 2 kms away&rdquo; and rolled my wheels towards Shiva temple (As) &lsquo;Dhianalinga&rsquo;.   There were sacks tied to every tree and with markers it read &lsquo;please use dust bin&rsquo;. Good to see people had followed. Between the leaves of the trees, like a smaller sun was the yellow doom of the temple. A security in uniform, dressed like that of a corporate one welcomed. After verifying if this is my first visit he conveyed the same to some one over the phone. He also asked me to wait until &lsquo;ji&rsquo; comes. Ji (must be in his later 20&rsquo;s) greeted and took me to a small museum kinda room. He xplained me the history of Dhianalinga.  Dhianalinga was erected by Sadhguru, who claims to have attained divinity. He guided a virtual tour of the temple thru a portrait. He then took me to a tank of water filled with Lotus and wanted me to take and offer to Dhianlinga, if I wish. After showing me the places of needs he left me at the entrance and posted me a constraint of maintaining silence.My first sight inside the temple landed on four to five symbols of various religions.   &lsquo;only Hindu&rsquo;s after this line&rsquo;   in Madurai Meenakshi temple flashed in my mind. Steps were not enclosed by copper, instead it gave me the feeling of being massaged. Ji have quoted me that the steps would open the inner valves of the foot.   The temple was built encircling the Linga. The roof was a semi spherical structure built with bricks and dust from the forest. If true, that it is built without concrete it is a miracle then. Interesting, to see mother forest worshipped. The chamber where Linga is placed is the temple by itself. Except a mercury lamp hanged high, there were 9 oil lamps . No poojas, no iyer, no bells but an appreciated temple of Coimbatore.   At the point where the spherical roof ends, there were hovels to comfort a 6 feettall or a 3 feet fat person. They are meant for practicing meditation. Though I was unable to talk to Linga as conveyed by ji I understood   &lsquo;meditation soothes&rsquo;  . An hour have passed when I completed meditation!!! and examined the temple sculptures (hardly 3 or 4). When a team of college gals wondered how good the temple is, a girl in saffron rushed to keep them silent. The weather was as pleasant as it begun for the day. My travel, the environment, the linga, the nature, the meditation thou unable to make out which, something has given me peace and a sense of accomplishment. Supplied with handful of pamphlets and information on the forthcoming Shivrathri events I walked to the parking lane. Once I turned up to see the yellow doom might be to convey  &ldquo;I will be back&rdquo;  To my surprise I had 4 idli&rsquo;s and 3 dosas on the way and they collected Rs.10 for tat and that is a different story. I am mulling over a question and want you also to.  The question is &ldquo;Meditation is always associated with God, isn&rsquo;t that different from divinity or is it not?&rdquo;       Anbe sivam       Balachander   click  Dhianalinga  for more

      Now that the fee cut for the elitist IIMs has been announced... after careful thought and consideration the following steps need to be urgently announced..  1. Do away with the CAT, GD and Personal interviews... After all higher education cannot be the choice of just the intellectual few... Every Tom, Dick and Harry has an equal say to it... And since CAT, GD, and the Personal interviews were separating the elitist from the non-elitist, they have to be discarded...  2. Introduce a new quota for the kith and kin of Government employees... they are the most underprivileged of the lot...  3. Decide the curriculum... Mr.Joshi being a Ph.D. himself... who better a person to decide the curriculum than the erudite Dr.Joshi…  4. Day-1 companies during campus interviews should be the PSUs... and there need to be a rule that the top 50 brains in the IIMs should necessarily stay in PSUs... after all, isn't the country losing the best brains to the MNCs..

            I dont know how to formally begin for a book review. Particularly a book from such a distinguished scientist and Honorary President of India. In this book, Dr.Kalam provides insights about his interaction with young minds of India. Dr.Kalam has taken case-studies from almost all spheres of India to illustrate how the young people in particular the students think about their dream to live in a developed Nation.  Dr.Kalam see his Role-model through celebraty leaders like Mahatma Gandhi, Albert Einstein etc. Dr.Kalam has spread the message of National Integration in every page of this book. One important message Dr.Kalam points out in this book is that amalgamation of Science and Religion would make an enriched nation.  "When A.R.Rahman sings Vande Matram, he is seen as an Indian not as a Muslim". This statement made me to think about a scene from the Movie Kovil(Although it was a comedy scene, the message was very powerful). Dr. Kalam assures only the young Indian People can make the dream to happen "India 2020" (a developed Nation). A developed Nation can happen only when a country is self-sufficient in education, defence, non-poverty and social scenario.  India is rich in natural resources. Only if we tap and use the natural resources in an effective and efficient way, we can able to become a powerful nation. An example, Dr.Kalam points out is the Jamshedpur Steel Plant.   Instead of me saying all those points, I recommend all the members to read this book compulsarily. This book is not just to Ignite the young minds, but our minds(all the Indians) too!

      Ok Ram, I guess that shows how the laws work. Ha ha ha... Since you had asked for it, here are the five basic laws of stupidity.    Always and inevitably everyone underestimates the number of stupid individuals in circulation.   The probability that a certain person be stupid is independent of any other characteristic of that person.   A stupid person is a person who causes losses to another person or to a group of persons while himself deriving no gain and even possibly incurring losses.   Non-stupid people always underestimate the damaging power of stupid individuals. In particular non-stupid people constantly forget that at all times and places and under any circumstances to deal and/or associate with stupid people always turns out to be a costly mistake.   A stupid person is the most dangerous type of person.    Confused, read a more detailed explanation  urlLink here .  When I had siad, i'm looking out for designs, I meant something like  urlLink this   urlLink list .

      I read an interesting article on human stupidity. It is a pretty much long article, but it is kind of interesting. Read "The Basic Laws of  Stupidity". It is been a couple of weeks since I posted some laws. So consider this as a continuation from where I left off.  So  urlLink Friday the Thirteenth . And Tomorrow is  urlLink Saturday the Fourteenth .  urlLink Valentine 's day. Wonderful.  I am looking out for new designs for this blog and  urlLink QSS . Anyone having any good color schemes, send them to me. BTW, does anyone else use a RSS reader?

      Its ok, if its a tedious work leave as such... and as I was bit relaxed, I thought of reading ur links...

      Sorry Ram, I thought about and also looked. Blogger does not have an option. It can be worked around. But that means I would have to dirty my hands with Javascript, which I don't want to.  There are already too many scripts running in the blog. One for the blogroll (which I have plans of replacing), a couple for the "recent posts" section, another couple for the website visitors and referrers. I think everyone should visit the logs. Click on the image. You'll get to know find amazing information from it.   If you want, I can sort and put the archives listing in the descending order, I'll add it to my to-do list. No posts on your "Thoughts", Have you forgotten it?  BTW, if anyone is still linking to my Quod scripsi scripsi blog hosted on blogspot (http://jaxsays.blogspot.com), please update it to the new one ( urlLink http://jaxsays.weblogs.us ) and I have deleted the blog hosted on blogspot.

      Jax, Just 2day I noticed that it would be nice if we have the current archive's list in the reverse order... Thats recent in the first row towards the actuall_first in the last row...  Others, Any thought?  coming to kicha's Know (K)not, I feel its just for a companion sake... (moreover its a well to do & decent job only)... Only for company's sake means No brandy shop owners will get a bride!!! and other gender-specific roles also? Its similar to finding wouldbe's in the local sorounding itself instead of geting from 50000 miles away although they are of same caste, creed etc....  I think, its better not to think about these things...   Rini, while reading ur splendid summary I can visualize what all could have occurred... but sorry anyway missed the event, let us c a year later...  Cheers Ram

      Valli - Cyprus Semiconductors Sinduja K - Wipro Ramya R - don't know Vinitha - healthcare company Ranjini - Wipro Ramya P - Deutsche s/w  No prizes for guessing what they are... But if this is any indication, there seems to be a minor inclination on part of the parents to getting their daughters married to someone who has had a similar education as her... Irrespective of the girl working after marriage or not, there seems to be a mindset that there might be a better understanding if the two have learnt similar things in their "student" life.. or is it..??  I'm saying "similar learning in student life" because in quite a few cases the girl may not work post-marriage or after some period after marriage... So, the case of having relatively "similar job nature" and "similar work pressure" and "similar timings" cannot be made generic...  So, what could be the big idea... does learning similar things as students got to do anything with better understanding in marital life... If so, which kinda parents would get their daughters married to the umpteen marketing professionals, does a financial consulant necessarily need a wife who did something sort of MBA Finance, so that they understand better in their life... or is it all only confined to the big fella called "Information Technology"... ???  PS: Only arranged marriages are in the purview...!!

      Vasanta Habba!  If North India is known for celebrating the Arrival of spring with colours, Bangaloreans have found a novel way of inviting it with Arts. Yes, its VasantaHabba, the popular "Festival of Spring".   It is a dusk to dawn programme with Dance and Music forming the glory of the time. Celebrated every first Saturday of February, this was its 13th year.   The first half of the day/night starts around 6 o'clock, filled with stunning performances of some professional and some to-be professional ensembles of three different dance schools and goes on till midnight.  The next half sings about music and only music.   This year the performers who stole the stage were stalwarts in their own schools. It was like all under one roof or u can call it as a Dance and Music supermarket, where in they hosted a variety of concertos to pickup, which no other event can boast about.  Nrityagram, the Dance school which hosts Vasantahabba, aims at not only bringing Classical / refined forms of art to public, but also the basic forms such as folk dances into the premises of the public. So did it start with patronising  "Dollu kunitas" where the Dancers do dance and create a pattern of music with their big drums, which they carry. Full of Raw energy, really it was amazing to see them perform with good beats and heats of sound with uniformity.   Then on the line-up awaited us, the Village Ensemble, where in the children, belonging to the nearby places of Nrityagram, did give a really impressive program. Yes, first was the school of Odissi students on the go. The uniformity, the costume, the expressions were something so good, that one would really fall in love with Odissi, at the very site of its performers.  Kathak, is one more form of dance which was displayed with village children, is unique in its own way with lots of twists and turns and as any dance form, needs to have a subtle expressiveness more in account and so did the performance too was.  Bharathanatyam - Bha - "Bhava", Ra - "Raga", Tha - "Thala". So, there were all the three elements of dance in the presentation to us.  Village Ensemble did prepare us for the heavy dance feast waiting for us. First, started the Bharathnatyam performance by Priyadarshini Govind, who took us to various moods under different themes of her performance.   While she went from her Main act on Devi's Samhara of Demon, It did kill the demons out there, and as a symbol of victory, brought in rains too. Rain was the pleasant surprise visitor and she did invite it with a dance of inviting Krishna to a devotee's consort. She did insist on dancing in Lord Varuna's(lord of Rain)abode and so, the visitor had to get back, when she performed an excellent piece on Lord Shiva. The tailpiece of Vande Mataram, did tie everyone to the motherland! Nevertheless the audiences were the most enthusiastic of all times.  In Odissi, The movements are so graceful that, it gives a feel that, its more feminine. It was hard to believe the All-male Odissi performance of Dasavathara-The ten incarnations of Lord Vishnu by the native performers of Orissa.   High spirits that had risen was then subdued by a martial art and classical contemporary dance mix up performance by Astad Deboo. Of course, initially, it was not so legible, to much of the audience, coz of the subtle and fragmental movement, but its the high degree of control to exhibit such movements was the one which kept the audience tied up to the show.  Oops, a Bhangda then to make u smell the wheat after harvest......... It was a surprise act and so did the audience liven up to the performance. Meanwhile a trailor of what’s going to be the performance in 2005 from Odissi dance school was played to lure the dance enthusiasts, the next year too. Oh, lots of variety in dance and the time now has  flew to Midnight and was time for Music concerts to start.   The first artist in that section was the all time audience favourite, Bombay Jayshree. So calm and composed was her concert, with few beautiful embellishments like Nannu palimpa, Krishna nee begane, and et al. Of course how would the audience leave such a sweet artist who hasn’t fussed to get herself booked at a midnight slot, without asking once more? yes, they did so, and so did she sing one more thillana to quench their desire!   Then was a Sitar-Violo cello duet concert which was a feast to the audience ears. The music of Sitar is so vibrating and it, blended with the customised coarse sound of Violo cello, kept the audience awake till the end. "mile sur mera tumhara" is what the artist told and started playing once again, when the audience asked one more!  Followed by it was Kadri Gopalnath's Sax concert where in he really lived up to the audience by playing lots of familiar pieces like Alaipauthey, Kurai ondrum illai, Brahma mokhate, Krishna nee begane et al.   Antaragini was a Bangalore local band, gone to international level in their performance these days and they were the ones to touch the audience next. Great was their, effort to keep the audience live by giving some enthuse pieces of music. Ya, they were also, no exceptions to audience' "one more" request and had to abide them by singing one of their most sought after piece, "Mysore se".   Last in the line up was "Indian ocean", a kind of fusion music which we dint find time to witness, coz of time constraint.  Oh, how many performances and all performances were not less in anyway and unique in their own way and my god, i can't imagine how they managed to organise and coax performers for midnight and after midnight slots in the chill weather of Bangalore. Whistles and applause were some of the best gifts, which all artists would never, forgot to take from the audience. For all those artists, who were accustomed to disciplined fans, these kind of casual fans must have been a different ambience altogether. And the audience were one of the most unique, with people thronging from all parts of B'lore and from villages near by, climbing on wall, near by trees and what not, to get a glimpse of what’s going on.....   With a fond memory of having witnessed an excellent event, i await for the next year celebration too.

      hi friends,   caught up with some training. so couldnt blog. Kavi is blogging??!!!!! Sri that was a good and interesting piece of info.   And here is one small story on gifting which i would like to share with u .......... ****************************************************  Hatim Tai had a great reputation among the Arabs of old for the lavishness of his gifts and alms.   “Have you ever met anyone more excellent than yourself?” his friends once asked him.   “Yes,” replied Hatim Tai.   “Who was he?”   “One day I had forty camels sacrificed and I offered a feast to whoever would like to come and share in it. Then I set out with several chiefs to invite guests from far and wide. On the way we came across a woodcutter who had just cut a bundle of thorns. This was the way he earned his livelihood. Seeing that he was poor, I asked him why he did not go to the many feasts given by Hatim Tai. `Those who earn their living,' he answered me, `have no need of the bounty of Hatim Tai.' “   Why then did Hatim Tai declare that the woodcutter was a better man than himself?   It was because he thought it nobler to work and to provide for oneself than to give others gifts which cost no effort or sacrifice and which, moreover, discourage them from being self-reliant.   Of course it is quite natural that friends should give presents to their friends; it is good that strong arms should come to the help of the poor and the needy; but an able-bodied man should work with his hands, not hold them out for alms. Of course this implies no reflection on those who consecrate themselves entirely to the contemplative life and the search for wisdom.   ************************************************* will be back with a tale on Vasantahabba -a festival of spring celebrated @b'lore to which i had been this weekend.

      Oneday Philip Kotler took classes  for IIM - A students and Illustrated the marketing concepts by means of a live example under different real time situations.    You see a gorgeous girl at a party. You go up to her and say, "I am very rich.Marry me!" That's Direct Marketing.   You're at a party with a bunch of friends and see a gorgeous girl. One of your friends goes up to her and pointing at you says, "He'svery rich.Marry him." That's Advertising.   You see a gorgeous girl at a party. You go up to her and get her telephone number. The next day you call and say "Hi,I'm very rich.Marry me." That's Telemarketing.   You're at a party and see a gorgeous girl. You get up and straighten your tie, you walk up to her and pour her a drink. You open the door for her, pick up her bag after she drops it, offer her a ride, and then say, "By the way, I'm very rich.Will you marry me?" That's Public Relations.   You're at a party and see a gorgeous girl. She walks up to you and says, "You are very rich.." That's Brand Recognition.   You see a gorgeous girl at a party. You go up to her and say, "I'm rich.Marry me" She gives you a nice hard slap on your face. That's Customer Feedback !!!!!   You see a gorgeous girl at a party. You go up to her and say, "I am very rich.Marry me!" And she introduces you to her husband That's Demand and supply gap.   You see a gorgeous girl at a party. You go up to her and before you say, "I am very rich.Marry me!" she turns her face towards you ------------ she is your wife ! That's competition eating into your market share.

      Here's another silly wonder that we could ponder on.. just like the 'hotel' thing that bala sent...  "Why do (generally) women grow long hair.. while men prefer to keep it short."  I put that 'generally' in bracket because these days women also tend to keep their hair short.. at times as short as men, if not shorter... and while there are men too who like to keep their's as long as women, if not longer...   But having said that, its been a norm down the generations that as we utter the word "girl", "woman" and any of its sibling synonyms we visualize a homo sapien with a longer hair... When would this ever have begun..??  Stone-Age humans would never have thought of cutting their hair... in fact, they started dressing with leaves and twigs only after quite a while as their 6th sense of civilization began gradually to take root... But this case happened for both men and women of stone-age.. but how did the "cutting the hair short" thing held on only with the male species...  I do have my explanation for this.. but would like to hear from u too...

        Ctrl+Alt+Del Inventor Retires Today   The engineer who invented the Ctrl+Alt+Del keystroke combination is retiring today from IBM, leaving behind his legacy as an inexorable part of the PC experience. David Bradley developed the key combination while working on prototypes of IBM's first PC. He needed a way to quickly reboot the buggy machine because a hard reset--which involved flicking off the power switch and waiting a few moments before retoggling it--took too much time. "The intention was to be cryptic," he said. "It was a key combination that was the moral equivalent of turning the power off and back on again, so it was not an action to be taken lightly. It wasn't something you wanted to happen accidentally."   Today, many people use the keystroke combination on a regular basis and not always because the machine has become unresponsive. Microsoft adopted the keystroke combination for use in Windows; today's Windows versions use the combination to let people log on to the system and to bring up a diagnostic screen. "I might have invented Ctrl+Alt+Del but, as I like to say, Bill Gates made it famous," Bradley joked.

      Nice links on various types of personalities. It was interesting too.  I have added more  urlLink book reviews  and a  urlLink movie review  at  urlLink QSS . BTW, I have not enabled comments on many of my recent posts. What is your opinion, should they be enabled or disabled? I would like to enable them, provided they are used. No use in enabling comments and no comments are present.  Rajesh had come home last evening. Vijay had called. Watched a lot of movies, (reviews soon) and books (reviews  urlLink here ). Other than that the last week has been spent deleting hundreds of virii infected mails. Still deleting them... That's why I could not mail/reply to anyone.  On the work front, a coupe of days absence has precipitated a lot of pending tasks. I am striving hard to complete them  asap .  Rini, the colors were nice, but the best thing I liked was the use of asterisks in the title. It was fabulous. Hope to see a lot more posts in the future on flowers. BTW, any snaps of your garden available.  Manny, the link you gave didn't work. Send it to my postmark id. Any luck with FrameMaker tutorials???

      Its human psychology that we prefer to maintain a distance from a stranger... Here's the actual theory behind it from a  urlLink psychology source ...   People surround themselves with a "bubble" of personal space that they claim as their own, and they tend to become stressed when other people invade their "bubble."   Ashton and colleagues found that when they asked pairs of friends and strangers to stand at various distances from each other, both men and women felt more comfortable when an opposite-sex friend stood close (about 1.5 feet) than when a stranger of either sex stood at that distance.

      It was an interesting piece that rini has shared with us... one thing is that the measurements used to arrive at the supposedly precise date of Lord Ram's birth is based on planetary positions... And this has been the very root of any astrological theory... horoscopes are mainly based on 12 (if I'm not mistaken) objects that constitute the planetory standings...   Now my question is how does it really get to affect our lives... if at all it does... How does a saturn moving from a left to a right have an impact on whether I would succeed in an exam or not...

      bit rot     n.     [common] Also bit decay. Hypothetical disease the existence of which has been deduced from the observation that unused programs or features will often stop working after sufficient time has passed, even if `nothing has changed'. The theory explains that bits decay as if they were radioactive. As time passes, the contents of a file or the code in a program will become increasingly garbled.  There actually are physical processes that produce such effects (alpha particles generated by trace radionuclides in ceramic chip packages, for example, can change the contents of a computer memory unpredictably, and various kinds of subtle media failures can corrupt files in mass storage), but they are quite rare (and computers are built with error-detecting circuitry to compensate for them). The notion long favored among hackers that cosmic rays are among the causes of such events turns out to be a myth; see the cosmic rays entry for details.   The term software rot is almost synonymous. Software rot is the effect, bit rot the notional cause.   More such interesting computer jargons can be found  urlLink here !

      here is some more news about new locations(both mine and srini's too)! My new office is in a laneadjacent to the old building and both buildings are connected by a staircase at the terrace. so my office address is still the same!  And ram, u gave the caption, but only when u define, others will know what the caption means. so Kavis words were self-explanatory!  About Srini's location, SanJose is his destination for the next 45 days. Its popularly known as Silicon valley and located in California. Its situated in the West coast where temp. is moderately cool, unlike east coast areas which is very cold , where our valli and vinitha reside! Nearest big city is San Francisco.  He is going for a KT(Knowledge Transfer) session regarding his Cisco project. Hope this info. would suffice! ok then , got to do lots of packing and shopping. so bye for now.

      Rini,              basically the difference between both is How you want to project yourself, in other words how you want others to perceive you irrespective of  your actual nature and what you are.  When you do something for your outer self, most of the times it's all to do with what others will say, what they will think, all possible kind of pretention. Innerself is what you think, what you hear from you, who you are...... Being myself is the time when I can express my innerself without having the fear of being rejected for anything.             Ram, I din't mean the outer look or heart feeling. Rini..Give us more update on what kind of work srini is going to do at onsite? Even I don't know where it's located. Then..Today I stayed in office itself. We are having an audit for CMMI in April. My PL is going onsite this weekend. So we sat all through the night and finished something. Buy..see you then

          Since My exam got postponed, I am not coming to banaglore tomorrow. They haven't mailed about the reschedule. So I don't know when it will be.       To Rini's question, My answer is  When I can do whatever I want to.. without giving a second thought about it . When I am not bothered much about my outer self . It's the time for anyone to hear more from their inner self. Being with anyone who can accept you as you are.        See you guys...  Kavi

      That was the headline in today's Deccan Herald. I switched on the TV this morning... MTV was showing the song "Hum ko hai pura yakin..." - a song made for the World Cup '03 to motivate the team.... [V] was showing the latest hit "Jeet Lo Dil.." the official song of the Samsung Cup... NDTV shows y'day's  press conference... If u thought that's passion for the game.. then here's more.. Infy is broadcasting today's match Live in the big-screen...!!  So much for being passionate... Its amazing to notice how a sporting event raises so much nerves bringing the entire country on its toes..   Lets get to the other side of the whirlwind... there have also been scattered deliberations of the "unnecessary" adulation given to cricket when there are innumerable people just down the street who wouldn't care for who plays or who wins as long as they find enough to satiate their hunger... or sparing a thought for the jawans on the border who are eating bullets for breakfast and dinner...   There have been occasions in the past when the fans themselves have gone overboard..  a case being the burning effigies of Indian players when they lost to Australia in a preliminary World Cup match... Where was this "anger" when coach S6 was burning in Godra... where was this "anger" when Fr.Staines was burnt alive... this list would never end... There is a very thin line between just being passionate about a game as an individual and seizing things to the deepest of emotional depths...   Being passionate is not wrong... as long as we believe that its just 11 guys playing a sport and trying to give their best... But monitization and politicization by the media and politicians does go a distance in fuelling phony emotions that is far from the margins of "love for the game"...  Its the "love" for the game that is important and healthy.. and not an irrational, emtionally inflicted passion...

      Very interesting question by Rini... "But what makes u feel urself.."  let me try to make an exhaustive list..  When I do what "I" like to do.. when I have the freedom to do everything "I" want to do... when I have my dear one(s) near me... when I see that smile on the face of the special someone... when I can express myself with a wide genuine smile...   when someone cries for me.. when someone smiles for me… when I know I have one, to do these two for me… when that person is near me.. when someone tells me "I miss u"…  I may not be exhaustive.. this is all that I could manage at my level of spontaneity… but this does make me a point... a lot depends on the companion you are with – parent or friend or spouse... depending on what stage of your life you are in... its that companion and that companionship that imbibes a sense of belonging.. to instill an "all is not lost" feeling when all seems lost to you.. to re-instate what you are composed of.. and to make u feel yourself..

      Hi all,  Seeing the last couple of posts by  urlLink Rini  and  urlLink Kicha  people might think that I have given up blogging.  They seem to speak in the trend of pre- and post- eras. Hmmm.... I think Kicah has been doing too much reading and Rini too much thinking.  As Kicha has pointed out, I may not be able to blog as much as I usually did in the past, you can blame the lack of net access at Manny's company for that.  But if you had noticed, I had posted a few posts at  urlLink QSS  in the recent past.

      Good to see a flurry of activity... I guess jax might not have access to net... so activity is likely to decrease on his part... so its up to the others to make up for that.. I had been to madurai this past weekend... I too have to take up the exam Kavi is referring to.. though at a later date... But considering a few other things coming my way and considering my limits and priorities.. I'm not one bit confident of taking up this exam in the next 2 months or so... still counting my options... But this is mandatory for everyone in our dept... and I become answerable to my heads in this aspect.. lets see...

      Yes, yesterday's match was so good! Though i got little time to watch, since i was held up cooking for more than half a dozen guests crowded at our place, i enjoyed watching it! Ofcourse, it was not a thrilling match, but the way we enjoyed it all together, cracking jokes, what will happen, if an announcement is made that, the next match winner will get Kashmir! If such an announcement is made, then......... The story reeled on and on , containing Musharaf as opening batsman in Pak. team and Vajpayee as Opening bowler and what not comments and arrikais will be there and who would umpire them? None other than Bush ofcourse!  Really, socialising is always a vibrant task esp. when it comes to people of same circle or simply speaking among friends. This I realise, every time when there is a small gathering of friends at home. It gives me the energy to live with for the whole week and no wonder i anticipate weekends like anything and start planning for the next one, the very second its over!   I have seen people enjoying themselves, if they could feel the belongingness and if they feel "themselves" at home. And if, somebody is not able to coz of his/her own constraint or due to outer constaints, then every moment u spend is like spending it in hell though u grin all the time outwards! But what makes u feel urself is a question which always pops up in my mind when i see such events. Can anybody help me in finding an answer?

           After a long time..I read a book. 'Tuesdays with Morrie' by Mitch Album. I liked this book so much.  Mitch narrates the final days of his professor Morrie . This book talks about human values, Regrets,Emotions,Marriage & lot more. Had a good feeling after reading this book.  What happened? No blogs for long time. I am preparing for my exam now. Since my project itself taking lot of my time.. It's tough for me to find time to prepare for the exam. But anyway I sent an confirmation mail. But ????.I will be coming to bangalore this thursday to write the exam.       Bangalorians send me your contact numbers to my infosys id. I have to come back to chennai on friday itself.

      Hey goodbye Nanba are the words hummed by today's Yuvans and Yuvathis(Yuva's). The Maniratnam classic has done it again. The trio comprising Mani, A.R.Rahman and Vairamuthu has been success from Roja. I bought the CD of Aayatha Ezuthu with a roughtough fight on March 15, the release date. The cost of the CD is Rs.125/- released by Sony Music. Mind you the CD is  copyprotected. Don't try to Pirate the cD. Lets get into Business    1.Hai Goodbye Nanba  By  Sunitha Sarathy, Shankar Mahadevan, A.R.Rahman, Karthik  All of us know about Silmisam. What is Kalmisam? if Anybody know the meaning plz explain me. This song has a touch of youthfulness with a low pitch female Voice and staggering high pitch male voice. This song distinguishes the difference friendship and love. Siddarth and Trisha will choreograph for this song.    2.Janaganamana   By  A.R.Rahman, Karthik  This songs rises the youthfulness in today's yuvas. I thought Rahman might have replicated Vande Mataram. But he did not. This song emphasises the youth capabilities, their strengths their ability to chop down the social and political bottlenecks. (Vairamuthu may get national award for this song)    3.Sandai Kozhi   by  Madhusree, A.R.Rahman  In Tamil poetry there is a term called "Oodal". Themed in folk, this song well explains the love feelings of soulmates after pink ponk fights.     4.Dol Dol   By  Blazee, Shaheen AKthar  This is the theme song of the film. The English verse of Blazee and Electrical Percussion of Shaheen Akthar is good. But this song is as good as "Yennendurum Punnai" from Alaipayuthey.    5.Nenjam ellam Kathal   By  Adnan Sami, Sujatha   Adnan Sami tamil fame started with Shankar's Boys and now he sung for ManiRatnam. This song focusses on the difference between love and love's destination. Vairamuthu clearly explains the destiny of love.    6.Yakkai Thiri   By  A.R.Rahman, Shalini Singh  This is a typical "Marapu Kavithai" song. It can't still find the answer what does this song mean?!  I will award 8 out of 10 for this film's music.

      the ears begin to see... I reached Bangalore at 9AM today morning... 2 hrs behind schedule.. and reached office just in time for lunch... the bus travel y'day was the best one could ever hope for... I felt I was travelling in a rocket... in fact, even better... even a rocket wouldn't have trembled that much... nor would it have been so noisy.. that bus provided a feel of both... Even though it was an AC Sleeper bus, in theory, it was a typical Govt bus in reality...   Sometimes, I wonder if handing over the entire roadways to private players would make more passenger-sense...

      It may sound strange but this is a truth, that mind is not your intelligence. Mind can be intellectual, which is a very poor substitute for intelligence. Intellectuality is mechanical. You can become a great scholar, a great professor, a great philosopher ? just playing with words which are all borrowed, arranging and rearranging thoughts, none of which are your own.  The intellect is absolutely bankrupt. It has nothing of its own, all is borrowed. And that is the difference between intelligence and intellect. Intelligence has an eyesight of its own, a capacity to see into things, into problems.  Intelligence is your born quality.       - Extract from some mail..... **************************************************** Few more insights into the difference between an intellect and intelligent is given by writer J.Krishnamoorthy. Here is it!  Intelligence, not intellect: There is a vast distinction between intellect and intelligence.  Intellect is merely thought functioning independently of emotion.  When intellect, irrespective of emotion, is trained in any particular direction,  one may have great intellect, but one does not have intelligence,  because in intelligence there is the inherent capacity  to feel as well as to reason;  in intelligence both capacities are equally present,  intensely and harmoniously.  ***********************************************

      "Just like a child goes through various stages of education before he reaches the University a person goes through several changes in his musical tastes before he learns to appreciate classical music. Rock, Rap, or Pop, are smaller schools of music and the very fact that somebody listens to this music means he has an ear for it. Classical music is like a university. You need to graduate to it."  "Throughout history different forms of music have gained popularity but these have not taken the place of classical music. Thirty years ago if we got an audience of fifty it was considered great. Today, we can expect even 10,000 people. It is wonderful that in today's fast-paced life people do find the time for a classical concert. What is more heartening however, is that the audience is made up of young listeners, the so-called Rap generation. Does it really indicate classical music is losing out?"  - Pandit Jasraj

      Rini, I'll tell u how u forgot... First, u woke in the morning... hoping to get back the feel of the good old days of going office... "old" because ur holidays almost seemed an eternity... then, u started on all ur daily chores thinking to continue as u do normally in any other week day...   Then, u came to office... and as u glared at ur anti-glare monitor, thoughts of sharing ur experiences started treading the noble path to ur mind... and u started off with a quoty post and followed that with a posty post.. all the while wondering if the comprehensive mechanism for detecting if any Vital Information Resource Under Siege cases could occur on "Hi"ing at the blog subject... and a gush of the nobly treaded path of ur thoughtwave began to overflow as ur fingers started typing out the frills across those paths... and as u typed them u didn't notice what was present in the otherside of the fence in the middle of the road...   As u didn't notice it u didn't put it in ur posty post.. quoty post was not supposed to have it... and posty post missed it.. And this is how u forgot... If I'm wrong.. then I'm wrong.. otherwise I'm not...

      ya, i forgot to tell u guys, that i listened to two casettes last week. Exquisite. Both were, simply exotic! One was "The best of Pandit Jasraj" and the other was Venkateswara Panch ratna mala vol-3 by M.S. These days i am falling in love with the voice of Sangeeth Maartand (as pandit is popularly known!). Especially i listened to one particular piece, "Om namoh bhagavate vasudevaya" and i felt like, he was singing it in the most beautiful way possible. yes, the flow was something so natural and true that i felt so pleasing! Ofcourse, since its a hindustani devotional kind, its rendered like a bhajan and it gave me a feel that he was teaching his followers how to sing, by profusing the rendition with more music and devotion.   The other one was by M.S. Subbu lakshmi and needless to say about her for any kind of carnatic lovers. Every piece in the casette was a gem. i was attracted to all songs equally and no wonder would be my favourite for the next few weeks, till i get them by heart.   Apart from this, we also bought a casette of BombayJayshri with songs on "Kashi". Need to hear some more time, to get lured by that casette. Hope i dint forget anything else.  bye for now.

      Ranjini, it is good to have you back again after a week long hiatus. Ram, the site you suggested was nice. Did you suggest them for its design or the information in it?  It is good to see everyone moving into newer areas in terms of opportunities.   For the past one month, I seem to notice a drop in the number of posts and an increase in the number of mails. Is it a sign of the blog outliving its usefulness as a communication tool?  People usually have the idea that only women ought to take care of thier skin. But the skin is really an important organ for men also. I came across an  urlLink article  today. Though the products specified may not be available in India, the articles anyhow gives several tips.

      Yes everybody, here i am back to work after a beaming off for a week from my work. Yes, i claimed my LTA last week and so applied leave for a week. So couldnt check blogs and update it frequently.   Hei guys, Congrats on Manny's and Bala's new ventures! Good going guys.   BTW Bangaloreans, did ramya priya contact any one of u guys? since i wasnt in town, i got a news that she called me up. so if u people have contact no. do pass it on to me! Would love to chat with her!  Had a great time at home, finished reading Anna Karenina at last, and also one more book, a subtle humourous play by Oscar Wilde, "The importance of being Ernest". Also half way thru' "Mahabharatham". Excellent book full of life i can say, but then, its a very brief version by kirubananda vaariar and ya do u guys know any author, who has written Mahabharatham in the most comprehensive way? If so do pass on the info to me, i would like to purchase it and read it once. Or guys like kicha, ram can enquire elders in your family and let me know! Meanwhile, i too would keep my search on.  Got so many other books on shelf and feel like reading them all at one stretch, but adhukkula leave mudinjiruchi. enna panrathu. anyway will finish them off soon too.  ok guys, got some work, so will update later.

      ......spirituality is not a high intellectuality, not idealism, not an ethical turn of mind or moral purity and austerity, not religiosity or an ardent and exalted emotional fervour, not even a compound of all these excellent things; a mental belief, creed or faith, an emotional aspiration, a regulation of conduct according to a religious or ethical formula are not spiritual achievement and experience.  These things are of considerable value to mind and life; they are of value to the spiritual evolution itself as preparatory movements disciplining, purifying or giving a suitable form to the nature; but they still belong to the mental evolution,—the beginning of a spiritual realisation, experience, change is not yet there. Spirituality is in its essence an awakening to the inner reality of our being, to a spirit, self, soul which is other than our mind, life and body, an inner aspiration to know, to feel, to be that, to enter into contact with the greater Reality beyond and pervading the universe which inhabits also our own being, to be in communion with It and union with It, and a turning, a conversion, a transformation of our whole being as a result of the aspiration, the contact, the union, a growth or waking into a new becoming or new being, a new self, a new nature.

      My favorite Techno Director Shankar has incepted his new project with Seeyan Vickram as the hero in his film "Anniyan". The film will come out in Oscar films V.Ravichandran's Banner. Shankar has tied up with Harris Jayaraj for the Music and Background Score for the film.(A.R.Rahman gone). With Manikandan Behind the Camera, Sujatha will write the dialogues for Shankar's screenplay.  Peter Hein will compose the action, while Raju Sundaram will make the Choreography. Sabu Cyril will make haste out of waste.(Art direction). The film story is made for Kamalhaasan(ROBO!), but Shankar is quite impressed with the acting of Vickram in Samy.  The story is said to be an action thriller, while Vickram playing the duo role. But the questionable part is Shankar has made Jayam Sadha as the heroine of this film. (Irresistable!!!!).

      Just when one begins to think that the lustre is lost... he comes up with a beaut.  Meenaxi - A tale of 3 cities  is nothing short of an AR Rahman magnum opus.. MF Husain's (the painter) directorial second with Tabu playing the lead role, Meenaxi is a masterpiece creation of 8 exquisite works of art.. certainly Rahman's best in Hindi.. after Taal and Lagaan.    1. Yeh Rishta  (Singer: Reena Bharadwaj)  Turning out as another of Rahman's revelation, Reena's debut song would have pleased many a heart. Her opening line, and the opening of her career, is as soothing as running water and just bewilders you.. Her rendition of the entire track is superb, and in particular the feeling with which she sings the title line "Yeh Rishta Kya kehe laata hai" (What does this relation signify?) could not have been more perfect...   2. Chinnamma Chilakkamma  (Singer: Sukhwinder Singh)  My favorite. Rahman and Sukhwinder team-up again to bring out another foot tapping number... This song is based in Hyderabad and is a blend of Telugu folk with a Punjabi twist... The song opens with a flute rendering coupled with a mild "women folk" chorus of the title line and moves into a rhythmic percussion...   3. Do Kadam aur sahi (Singer: Sonu Nigam )  A melodious melancholy... its beauty lies in it's vocal-musical melding. Rahman doesn’t add a single hard beat, yet he creates an evenly symmetrical rhythm that flows smooth...   4. Dhuan Dhuan (Singer: Asha Bhosle)  There is more of Asha than Rahman.. the vocal genius of Asha coupled with the synthesized music gives us another ever-green creation...   5. Cyclist's Rhythm (Instrumental percussion: Shivamani)  How do u feel when u hear the sound of 10 distinct bicycle bells going off at the same time... noisy nuisance...?? For Rahman and Shivamani even that rings musical tunes... this is the height of musical creativity...   6. Rang Hai  (Singer: Alka Yagnik, Dallinda)  A Rajasthani folklore... the most unusual part of the track is the very beginning, opening with a mysterious voice of the Lebanese singer Dallinda.. It is said, Tabu danced with 4 stitches in her leg to this song and on asking how she managed.. she repied "It is the music of the film. It just did something to me. It's almost divine."   7. Potter's Village (Instrumental percussion: Hossam Ramzy)  This one carries an Arabic feel to it, most probably because of the extensive use of the guitar throughout the piece.    8. Noor-Un-Ala (Singer: Murtaza Khan, Quadir Khan)  A Qawwali composed by MF Husain himself... Rahman continuously provides us with the quick-paced beat of the tabla and the flowing melody of the harmonium, characteristic of most qawwalis.. another catchy composition...

      Kicha, you were spot on when you spoke of certain aspects related to the economic  factors. It is true that a political rethink is necessary.   The feel good factor has generated such a lot of discussion even before the elections are underway. The growth of a country is to be applauded but the politicisation of the growth is an area that has to be avoided.  One party says it is instrumental for the country to achieve great heights. But did the party do it on its own. No, it just ramped up the prevailing growth. For that cause it is to be congratulated. The other party says that the government is a failure and that they would have brought greater laurels to the country.   I feel that the development of a nation should not be handed over to a bunch of political parties who change idealogies and partners faster than a formula 1 driver changes gears. Instead, the plans foir the nation's growth have to be decided upon and the government must be able to execute that plan, regardless of thier party manifesto. Such a  growth is a true growth of a nation.  So what do you think? Should the plans for the growth of the nation (say our five year plans) be constant with each government working towards achieving it or should each government bring out thier own five year plans?  P.S. This was to be posted yesterday morning. Due to some problems with Blogger. It is being posted aday late.  Manny, congrats. I'll call you tonight without fail.

      Hi all, Hope everyone is doing fine. One good news for u all. I have joined one of the Inc 500 Hall of fame companies...A CMM Level 5 company too... Yes I am now a part of US based  HTC Global Services Inc.  in its Global Development Centre, here in MEPZ, Chennai. Joined today as a Technical Communicator...  There is a long and interesting story in my past one month's life. Yes! It was a situation when my company (Vannet Techloggix) went bankrupt and one fine morning I (not only for me but to all my colleagues too) got a notice from my company that the operations are going to be closed by Feb 15th...  I was left stranded and till feb 13th I did not have any other options at hand. But on 15th morning.... I submitted my papers and got the relieving order and in the same evening I got the offer letter from HTC.  Yep!!!!! I did not believe it at the first place, but its true...ha ha...somewhere I should have done some good at some time in my life...and finally everything was sorted out and I joined HTC after all joining formalities have been completed...   I am now in my induction program and will be kicked off with the project in another couple of days. Thats it.  And one more news. Hope some of you might be knowing that Sandil is here in chennai. Now he is working as the Distribution Manager at Grandix Pharmaceuticals and has rented a house near CMBT. We are used to meet once in two days atleast and we enjoy riding the roads of chennai...  And I am also expecting one more good news, which I know but waiting for that person to tell u all and take that pleasure himself...everything well and good. And yes...This is why I was not able to participate in the blog for the past couple of weeks as I was preoccupied with hell a lot of things...  Ok then, bye bye and take care friends. Mahendran Jayavel.  Note: Jax can you give a call to me at this number: 044-55384745. Its urgent and make the call without fail tomorrow after 9'o clock in the night tomorrow. I have a message for u. Dont fail to call me da. ok.

      It is not very surprising that we don't have many to speak of in that Forbes list... its just that with the kind of economy that India is, its really hard to produce more such people compared to the likes of European countries and some others...   The EU believes in growing up together.. trade barriers are very flexible... travel regulations are tourist-friendly... once u get to some European country, travelling to other European countries is very easy.. remember, sindhuja has already visited Scotland and Wales.. so tourism improves and adds to the economic kitty and now-a-days the EU (except Britain) trades with the same currency too...   But in the case of India, the dependency on the developed economies is so large that we seldom get to call the shots... further, the ASEAN exists just for the sake of existing... there is immense unrest between the neighboring ASEAN countries... and most delegate meets are spent languishing over the political instability...  While EU has very relaxed and cooperative trade norms... the Asian "giants" China and India are considered to be competitors... in this age, growth is only possible with a cooperative and liberal sharing of selective core competency.. that is the whole raison d'etre of the concept called ECR (Efficient Consumer Response) which is still taking roots..   George Fernandes asked in the '70s, "Why do we need a Unilever to make such measly things as a toothpaste".. Unilever did enter India.. and the rest is history... Georgian socialsm has no place in this era.. the "feel-good factor" in the economy is just a fog veiled over the election atmosphere...  India has a long way to go before it could become a force to reckon with... and it would require a revolutionary political re-think..

      It has been a month since I came to Chennai. I expected to roam around  urlLink Chennai  during the weekends. I was wrong. I had spent only one weekend in Chennai. Every weekend, I find myself spending the weekend out of town. I had been to  urlLink Madurai ,  urlLink Bangalore ,  urlLink Coimbatore , and coming weekend, Bangalore again and then to Coimbatore next weekend. I wonder when I can get to visit the sights and sounds of Chennai other than commuting to work.  Kicha, expecting a treat from you for getting a new mobile and Rini, expecting your birthday treat. My plans for a mobile are posted  urlLink here . Leave your suggestions/comments for my mobile there.

      I  know its been a long time since i blogged something... but yenna panrathu periya alunganna apadithan...adjust madi pls!  About a month back, on a friday evening we went to A R Rehman's concert at Symphony hall in Birmingham...it's one of the best halls in UK...it was jam packed with 70:30 ratio of Indians to English...he's quite popular in UK as his english stage play 'Bombay Dreams' was very successful which won him acclaims among British...and his next project 'Lord of the Rings' stage play to add to his credit...it was no 'singing dancing' show..but very professional with orchestra comprising of local english people belonging to Symphony hall group.  I wouldn't call the show a great one...according to Rehman it was first of its kind from him...so for a start it was good and made it one of my memorable evenings!  hey kishore...ticket varathu kulla sollitiya...but as he said, on may 3rd hopefully nan india manna thodauven....Right now im in a shopping spree...dont know if i'll be able to stuff all the things under the permissible weight limit. Coming weekend we are going to London...to pay a last visit before we leave! already Ram has promised me a red carpet welcome ;-) Ranjini sonna mathiri virundu pottudu yenakku...  Looking forward to seeing you guys in India...  Cheerio Sindu

      Hi all,  felt bad that I could not join the get together. Had to be in Chennai for our Branch Training Program for 3 days.It was enjoyable on all the 3 days.  Managers & supervisors from all over kerala, karnataka, andhra & tamil nadu were present. After all the training program during the day the evenings & night were the most enjoyable.  The first evening saw us celebrate with a model named Malaika and a AJ named Ashok. It was full of "Kuthu" dance if thamizh songs were played. With drinks also available in the hall u should imagine the fun.  Right from the branch manager, regional manager & district manager danced with us.  The second evening had swimming pool games followed by casino with drinks and dance(ellam dapankuthu thaan).  Also met many of my UG friends after a long time.  Had a busy week after the program.  On satirday went for "Ghilli" movie. Vijay babu wanted me to tell about the movie in the blog. So here are my views.  RIGHT from the start to finish it is so fast & enjoyable.  Director Tharani like his previous movies follows a single line story but makes it so much enjoyable with his screenplay.  The story is Vijay protects Trisha from her uncle Prakash Raj who wants to marry her any cost. How he does it is shown with lots of twists & turns.  Songs are for the masses.The whole theatre dances for all the tunes..As usual Trisha is Ravishing(hihihi) and Vijay has acted in style.  The chasing scenes have been taken in style.  It will be a good entertainer for all.  Bye

      Poet-seers who have achieved the highest realisations and have endeavoured to  share that experience with the rest of humankind.The teachings and  very utterances that spiritual masters of this calibre offer to the world come from the most sublime realms of consciousness that human  beings can attain to. Their poetry transcends the page to become mantra,  an invocation to the transcendental consciousness.  Do you think we know any poet seers? or have any of us come across the works of poet seers?

      	 A couple of days ago, I had the opportunity to visit the  urlLink Namma MTR  foodchain. My cousin, his roomate, his roommate&#8217;s friend and me decided to go to a movie,  urlLink Ghillie  that afternoon. Since the show was scheduled to start only at 16:30, we had the afternoon to while away. We decided to visit Commercial Street. On an impulse, we chose to visit Namma MTR instead of  urlLink Caf&eacute; Coffee Day . We were in for a surprise. 	 This summer, Namma MTR has launched an unlimited  urlLink icecream  buffet scheme. You pay 50 ruppees and you can eat as much icecream as you want. You can choose from various flavours, additional items like sauces, dry fruits. It was a good bargain to beat the summer heat. So those in Chennai and Bangalore, rush to the nearest Namma MTR outlet and enjoy this offer.  Rini, I tried calling your home. But no one picked up. I guess you had gone out to browse as I got your message on my mobile. Kicha, I called your office. You weren't there at your desk. Ram, sorry da, I didn't know your extension number. I tried to call Bala, but I could not reach him. Anyway the next time, I come to bangalore, I'll meet all of you. maybe we ca have a treat at namma MTR.

      It is good to see atleast one get-together taking place. I think the experience was very rich on seeeing the number of dollar signs in Kicha's posts.  As for me, this Easter went off well with my relatives, just like Christmas. I guess I've stopped celebrating festivals at home with family. I hope it is not the sign of things to come.  I know I haven't been posting much here, unlike  urlLink there . One reason is that most of my posts were either links to other sites I had come across during my browsing. But since I don't have that opportunity now,  I find it difficult to post anyhting. BTW, there seems to be any discussion at all, both in the blog and the group.   Any way here is  urlLink http://www.goodtyping.com/" title="Surely you'll benefit through this site.">one link  I came across while watching television. Nowadays, it keeps me company during evenings. But due to the stupidity of the government (CAS), I cannot get any movie channels. I have to manage with music channels and news channels.  Sri, nice to read your post. It kept me and Manny laughing for quite some time. Any way can you call me on my mobile (09840171578) asap.

      For the past couple of days, I did not have time to enter to barber shop for hair cut and shave. Some of my clients and colleagues interrogated me "Enna Love failurea?" What a Ticklish question?   I called Mom last week and said I want my hair to be Bald and Beautiful. Mom replied why can't u take  mottai? That sounds great. I agreed to mom's plea. I am goving to take mottai tomorrow.  Spending 3 to 4 days with pappa and Mama will be very much interesting and make them delightful. When one of my client asked the love failure question yesterday. I replied " This week I will be in  urlLink Anniyan  Vickram Style. Next week u will see  urlLink Aaiyetha Ezuthu  Maddy in me.

      There was soemthing interesting that happened in the past week... As I was racing against time to finish some work.. valli came online.. and then jax and then ram came out of his invisibility and we started a conference... though I didn't take part much because of work.. I followed the talk.. and then sindhuja joined in too.. it was nice talking with all at one go... and then I felt a bit naughty... I asked sindhuja for her number and called her up from office... through VoIP... just the inspiration of making so many calls to UK everyday (my current client is in UK) made me that much naughty...   I don't know if I'm allowed to reveal.. but still I do (I continue to be naughty)... Sindhuja is likely to land in India on May 3rd.. and go to Madurai etc., for a month before returning back to Bangalore... sindhu, would still like to hear this from ur mouth in this blog...  And there is going to be a get-together of sorts this weekend... some of the guys will be in blore this weekend for a day's bash.. while some are not able to make it... we'll plan something bigger soon...

      Quiet is a condition in which there is no restlessness or disturbance.  Calm is a still unmoved condition which no disturbance can affect—it is a less negative condition than quiet.  Peace is a still more positive condition; it carries with it a sense of settled and harmonious rest and deliverance.  Silence is a state in which either there is no movement of the mind or else a great stillness which no surface movement can pierce or alter.

      Dear friends please note that this election is not going to do anything with TN.The results are noway going to influence our Honourable chief minister Dr.AMMA.   this is parlimentary election and so dont fall inside the trap of thinking locally .   If you are satisfied with the nadional democratic alliance and support all the hard steps taken by AIADMK government in ensuring financial stability and uniform growth among all sector of people ,if you want them to continue in power  VOTE FOR BJP/AIADMK alliance(which is a natural alliance).   if you are not satisfied with the performance of NDA and still believe that DMK and alliances who where with BJP till yesterday and blamming it as an religious party today,a party with a symbol of rising sun and with a policy of rising son and rising grand son ,a party which always beleive that acting against Hindu beliefs is called as secularism, can give better governance along with Mrs.Antoniyo meno of ITALY ,then kindly vote for thier alliance.   always note that inspite of all critisism and blames Tamilnadu has almost reached the first position in all sectors as promised by our CM.   also note that Majority can not be right always.   ready for further discussion    Note: Kicha : - can you please copy this mail and put it in blogger for me?

      Hi ram, regarding ur doubt of East/West coast, i got a mail from vinitha which answers ur queries. here is it! "Regarding your doubths in the blogs whether Valli lives in the East Coast. Well, I live on the East Coast. Valli lives in the east but not on the coast. She follows Eastern timings as well like me. She lives in Kentucky. You can check that out in the map. The four timings followed here are Eastern, Central, Mountain followed by Pacific. Srini will be following Pacific Timings.  It's actually split into four areas longitudinally. So, one full long side is East and then followed by the rest. That's about it."  hope ur doubts are clear now! And to all of u, Srini reached Sanjose safely and he is merrily spending his time, relaxing, cooking, visiting places and preparing himself to go to office tonight(it will be day for them)! I am also having great time with my inlaws, though they will be moving tonight to Madurai! but never mind, my cousins are with me (en uyirai edukka)! ok bye for now all of u!

      In the blue of the sky, in the green of the forest, Whose is the hand that has painted the glow? When the winds were asleep in the womb of the ether, Who was it roused them and bade them to blow?  He is lost in the heart, in the cavern of Nature, He is found in the brain where He builds up the thought: In the pattern and bloom of the flowers He is woven, In the luminous net of the stars He is caught.  In the strength of a man, in the beauty of woman, In the laugh of a boy, in the blush of a girl; The hand that sent Jupiter spinning through heaven, Spends all its cunning to fashion a curl.

       A tech cold war comes to an end   Calling a truce in one of the business world's loudest and longest-running rivalries, Sun Microsystems on Friday settled its legal feud with Microsoft in exchange for nearly $2 billion in payments and a 10-year cooperation agreement with its former nemesis. The two companies will collaborate over the next 10 years to make each other's products -- notably Sun's servers and Microsoft's dominant Windows PC operating system -- work together well. McNealy said the deal with Microsoft would make Sun's products more valuable because they will now be able to work smoothly with products running Microsoft's software.

      A legal notice has been issued by GOI to Wipro that it should pay Rs.261 Crore Income Tax for the fiscal year 2003-2004. This Income tax does not cover Wipro's other portfolios like Healthcare, FMCG etc, but covered only Wipro's IT and ITES. Wipro will have only Rs.13 crore as profit, if it agrees to pay Rs.261 Crore to GOI(Profit in III Qtr of Wipro Rs.274 Crore).  According to STPI laws and amendments, Software companies which are registered under STPI are exempted from I.T. for the earnings and profits which comes under software exports. It doesn't make any sense for a company like Wipro to come under Section 10A of Income Act, 1997.  What I feel is such amendments of I.T will affect the morale of a company like Wipro. Any arguements and criticisms for the above point are most welcome.

      Yeah, it was a kind of obligatory post I had to make because I liked  urlLink this approach . Just in case you didn't know, many people I know read my blog. It keeps them in touch with me. I could've easily posted everything here and asked them to view it here but somehow I felt it wasn't the best solution. So when I have an alternative, why don't I redirect them there?  As for my participation in this blog, don't feel that I am abadonning this blog for that. Each one serves its purpose and neither shall one replace the others.    Obligation is not to taken as 'something you do because you are indebted to it'. And I also feel that obligation is a first step towards internalisation. So unless and until I start fulfilling my obligations, do they become closer to me and as a result, internalisation occurs.   That's all from me for now.

      Its been a while since I posted something substantial.. not that I don't have time.. but that I don't know what to post.. I do get my so-called "breaking news"... but a series of that would be just posting something for the heck of it...   jax, even though u told some days back in reply to my "post-jax era" post etc., that u would always be around.. its kind of going to be hard for u now.. understandable.. but as rini pointed out, it would have been more heartening for all of us if u had kept a fraction of that gusto to this blog too... all we got was something that u yourself acknowledge as an "obligatory" post... that was the saddest part of it all... I was just fearing this... posting in this blog need not be an obligation.. but it must be an internalised exertion.. obligation is the last thing anyone would want... Anyways...   rini.. keep pondering about the question.. I too will... some riddles (if I may call my question one) are difficult to be solved... but riddles need not be solved to be enjoyed..!!

      Since our company's performance was good last year, we have been given an incentive.  Quiet a good amount! Ofcourse, i was worried a bit of how to save money to buy gift for srini's birthday. That problem is solved now. good na! Yes, Srini left to SanJose yesterday without any hassles! (all becoz of my proper preparation plan) summa sollikka vaendiyathu thaan! Hope i dint have any leak holes in them..... Waiting for his call from there. Jax, this is very unfair, to leave this days work job like this and keep updating only QSS. come on, we all need u, in this blog too. this is highly unfair ya!  About ram's question, Vinitha only told me that both of them live in East coast and he is going for his ERP project only!  About kicha's question, Astrology is more on beliefs and to answer questions on, first we need to believe of which i can hardly help u out in describing what it is! so sorry i think, i may not help u in answering it, probably lets ask my senior to help u out with this regards. Really a complex question for an not fully formed individual like me!  ok guys will blog u all later!

       Language and its achievements (literature) are nothing to the mind worked up by the  modern trend of moneymaking and position-seeking.  Such a condition makes our mind so poor in understanding, inferring, and stating, that we are beings now without the force of real thought and feeling directing us. Usually our present state is that we are in an emotional mess. Emotions and sentiments of a cheap sort are our prop. Noisy verbal expression of musty ideals and appealing exhortations is the limit of our mental power. If we imagine that we are right, and that those whom we admire are 'really' great, we are well contented. If you look carefully at our writing, you will not fail to see that we scarcely realize that  we have a mind whose function is to think.    It has not been possible for us, since the inception of modern education to master a text and comment intelligently on it. This condition leads us to dependence upon Western resource, of intelligent application of mind. It means subordination, as long as we do not acquire any ability to keep ourselves independent. Suppose we attempt now to do some writing independently without this ability, we produce hogwash only.  It has this effect, namely, that we see clearly the superiority of the Western mind, but there is no stimulus to improve our mind just because mental improvement does not strike us as worthwhile beside planning and acting for bourgeois success . Let us be quite clear that there cannot be mental improvement without concentration on language and its classics&quot;

       Imagine you have applied for a job. You are awaiting   the results of that interview. One day you get a letter saying that your   application has been rejected. What do you you do now? Sit and sulk or take it   positively and move on?  Both of the above approaches result in you not   getting the job. Try  this   approach , you will be amazed at the result.  You can use the same   approach to any other situation in your life, but I cannot say the result will   be successful every time.

      These Blogger profiles are quite interesting. It gives a lot of information that is quite interesting to read. Details like no. of posts posted, no. of words posted give an interesting statistic.  When you fill up the profile, you can search for bloggers who have the same interests. For example, I had quoted Alaipayuthey as one of my favorite films. When someone views my profile, they can click on "alaipayuthey" to see who else have listed the film as their favorite films.  Similarly you can click on locations, say you want to know how many bloggers are from Tamil Nadu or perhaps Chennai. So why don't everyone update their profiles. It is going to take only a few minutes.

      I think it would really be useful if you can give a  gist of the article whenever you post some links. Maybe a kind of teaser  preview. Just keeping in mind the principle of AIDAS. Anyone remembering what  that means.  Just plain links alone is not useful to anyone. I&nbsp;recieve any new  posts through email. And all I can see is just a couple of links.&nbsp;It is not  usable. I guess everyone knows enough HTML to add a 'title' attribute to any  hyperlink you post.   If you can give a small note on the link, it is fine. But if you feel that  it might spoil the surprise, atleast give a  hyperlink  title to the hyperlink so that people can know  what they are clicking.  That is if it is not too much trouble for you.

      My first thoughts on reading the article were : "What was Francois Gautier  trying to convey?" Is he ranting about the obsession with white skin? Or is he  commenting upon the political scenario? I cannot comphrehend.  He started off with politics, somewhere in the ensuing paragraphs, he moved  on to the image of india in the western world and then later on to bollywood and  then accusations and then ends again with politics.  I don't know whether what sort of image he wants to project in the minds of  the indian readers, an Indophile or an Anglophobe?  I doubt if a majority of the educated people in India have ever heard of  the aryan invasion theory, nor is it taught in schools as history. It has always  been a bone of contention among historians, not the common man.  I feel that this article is mainly targeted in arousing confusion in the  reader. I wonder how the editor of the newspaper let this nonsensical article  get past his desk. BTW, since when did Ouest-France overtake Le Monde as the  largest circulated French daily.  BTW, why don't we reply in the comments section, instead of posting it  individually.

      "The fact that an opinion has been widely held, is no evidence that it is not utterly absurd; indeed in view of the silliness of the majority of mankind, a widespread belief is more likely to be foolish than sensible."  Right! In the outset let us see Who said this? Again a white skinned man called "Bertrand Russell"... Why this quote when there are too many satires quoted by intellectual Indians? why this obsession? Do you need a white man's quote to authenticate your stand point? and this is what Francois Gautier has qutoed in his write up as ...  "Obviously, colonisation has frozen the Indian mind in certain patterns and the British made sure, through Macaulay's policies, of leaving behind an enduring inferiority complex among Indians, by constantly harping on the flaws of Indian culture and inflating them. That is why today Indian intellectuals repeat like parrots what their masters had said before them..."  In retrospect, this is infact the mind set that has been sowed deep inside the indian minds...And I won't agree that Francois is a racist...had u read the writings of Francois, you might not be in a position to brand him as a racist and as a constant follower of his writings I wont agree upon the facts put forth by kishore that he's a racist.  I dont want to further quote some quotes as if quoting some IPC sections here now as it makes this discussion more like a court script...Instead the objective of francois was to discover the unknown inferiority of the majority of the indian minds (if not the whole of indian minds)...right!  :: Mahendran

Since I have found a way to keep in touch with the   blog (via email), you can expect me to be posting more than   often  As for the recent discussions , I would like to   read the original article.

      Manirathnam disappoints... no story-line... no punch in characters... no choreography... no nothing... These were some of the comments I read before watching the movie on sunday... Ayitha Ezhuthu is another Manirathnam classic... But for those who expect to see another love, another duet, another dance with a scenic beckground, another fight, another suspense and another happy ending.. this is not the kind  of movie to bet ur money on...  Manirathnam spends ample time with the flashbacks, which is the only way he can stress on the ingenuity of the characters he wants to portay... The screenplay is awesome.. There is not much choreography.. but given the positioning of the songs in the film it is not logical to spoil the flow by inserting unnecessary choreography... You cannot expect creativity in "yakkai thiri" nor can you expect special effects in "Jana gana mana"... the songs must be seen in the context of the film and a scenic choreography would have made no sense... No wonder that all songs put together comprise not even 30 minutes...  The way the characters are handled is very unique only to the Mani style of films.. from the unpredictability of Inba (Madhavan) to the endearing expressiveness of Esha Deol the actors fit their roles very aptly... The most impressive part of the film to me was the screenplay... though a shade in the style of alaipayuthey, Mani weaves his magic once more and does not disappoint... The songs are already a hit so there's no repeating that... Rahman shows he is still in form...  Watch the movie if u want to see something beyond the ordinary.. For the rest of the lot this isn't your piece of cake.. so just wait until the next movie with a lot of "masala" stuff comes your way...

      I'm referring to that article "The white woman and India". Its a pity that people are influenced by the senseless scribblings of a "White French man".. if I may call you that way sir.. his racist mentality is evident from the way the "colour of the skin" becomes the only theme in the article. More than politics or history his words are an offence over the skin of people.   I don't understand why the feeling that the image of India is "harmed" by images of our poor. USA has a significant population of "native americans" (or the so called "red indians"), who have been overthrown by the "white skinned" European settlers for their own selfish motives... The native Americans live in valleys and ridges and many unaware that there is another world and that there's something called technology... Are we Indians more selfish than such a ruthless American lot..??  Indians respect Mother Teresa not because she's white-skinned, not because there's no one else "brown-skinned" in India to take care of poor but because we respect every human and honour his/her good deeds irrespective of his/her skin color...   White people spend hours on the beach and put on a hundred creams to get tanned. And in winter they even artificially lie under infrared lamps in beauty parlors to get brown! Why this obsession for the Indian woman to have white skin?    I ask the same question to Mr.Gautier, why do your people want to become brown like us Indians... Isn't white beautiful enough for you..??? Why this obsession to become brown..??? You are that sect of perennially irrational ideologists for whom grass is always greener on your side...   Junk can never be junker than this...!!  ---------  The fact that an opinion has been widely held, is no evidence that it is not utterly absurd; indeed in view of the silliness of the majority of mankind, a widespread belief is more likely to be foolish than sensible.   - Bertrand Russell, Marriage and Morals (1929) ch. 5

      hi friends, for the first time in mumbai i went to see a tamil movie in theatre. it turned out to be a great occasion. the movie was perazhagan and i got a chance to see three suriya and three jothika. yes, i saw 2 suriya & 2 jothika in that movie and remaining 1 jothika and 1 suriya in person...... they came to see how the movie was going in mumbai. totally around 10 people only knew that they r in the admin room of the theatre. so we went there and meet them, i was just standing nearer to jothika.... wah what a beauty...... machan ganja, nee miss pannittada.. that time only i understood y u r telling her as ur thalaivi.....hmmmmmmmm.... we had only few words with them, a4 that they left from there. in that movie comedy was really good, vivek + suriya turned out to be very good combination. atleast for the comedy and suriya/jothika, film lovers can see this movie once.  - vijay

      Hope all of you are busy in your respective schedules. After Jax left ANGLER, there seems to be not much response in this blog. Only a few members have the enthusiasm to participate in this blog. Moreover, this is a ideal time to work(idle time of work). Pats to Kavitha, for such an wonderful article on lead management. We already have a software called ANGLER CRM, a part of the software already focuses on lead management.  Today, I had my ISO internal audit, out of the 15 parameters I got 5 Non-Compliances(NC's) in which 3 goes to my team. I have to prepare my corrective action report within a day or two. I am crewing up with my team to discuss the ways for eliminating the NC's.  Nothing much to discuss, Tomorrow I will be in Erode and tomorrow night, I will be watching Mani Ratnam's Aaiyatha Ezuthu. I have been told that the hindi version of the movie Yuva is not much to expectation. More Comments will follow through after seeing Aaiyatha Ezuthu....

Srinath quoted once "Let him take his first five wicket haul, and u'll see him take many more soon after that"... Zaheer took his first five wicket haul against New Zealand in 2002... and ended up as 3 successive hauls in that series... I had not spent night-outs at office in all of my 18-month career..

       In 1883, a creative engineer named John Roebling was inspired by an idea to  build a spectacular bridge connecting New York with the Long Island. However  bridge building experts throughout the world thought that this was an  impossible feat and told Roebling to forget the idea. It just could not be  done. It was not practical. It had never been done before.   Roebling could not ignore the vision he had in his mind of this bridge. He  thought about it all the time and he knew deep in his heart that it could be  done. He just had to share the dream with someone else. After much  discussion and persuasion he managed to convince his son Washington, an up  and coming engineer, that the bridge in fact could be built.    Working together for the first time, the father and son developed concepts  of how it could be accomplished and how the obstacles could be overcome.   With great excitement and inspiration, and the headiness of a wild challenge  before them, they hired their crew and began to build their dream bridge.   The project started well, but when it was only a few months underway a  tragic accident on the site took the life of John Roebling. Washington was  injured and left with a certain amount of brain damage, which resulted in  him not being able to walk or talk or even move.   "We told them so."   "Crazy men and their crazy dreams."  "It`s foolish to chase wild visions."    Everyone had a negative comment to make and felt that the project should be  scrapped since the Roeblings were the only ones who knew how the bridge  could be built. In spite of his handicap Washington was never discouraged  and still had a burning desire to complete the bridge and his mind was still  as sharp as ever.   He tried to inspire and pass on his enthusiasm to some of his friends, but  they were too daunted by the task. As he lay on his bed in his hospital  room, with the sunlight streaming through the windows, a gentle breeze blew  the flimsy white curtains apart and he was able to see the sky and the tops  of the trees outside for just a moment.    It seemed that there was a message for him not to give up. Suddenly an idea  hit him. All he could do was move one finger and he decided to make the best  use of it. By moving this, he slowly developed a code of communication with  his wife.   He touched his wife's arm with that finger, indicating to her that he wanted  her to call the engineers again. Then he used the same method of tapping her  arm to tell the engineers what to do. It seemed foolish but the project was  under way again.   For 13 years Washington tapped out his instructions with his finger on his  wife's arm, until the bridge was finally completed. Today the spectacular  Brooklyn Bridge stands in all its glory as a tribute to the triumph of one  man's indomitable spirit and his determination not to be defeated by  circumstances. It is also a tribute to the engineers and their team work,  and to their faith in a man who was considered mad by half the world. It  stands too as a tangible monument to the love and devotion of his wife who  for 13 long years patiently decoded the messages of her husband and told the  engineers what to do.   Perhaps this is one of the best examples of a never-say-die attitude that  overcomes a terrible physical handicap and achieves an impossible goal.    Often when we face obstacles in our day-to-day life, our hurdles seem very  small in comparison to what many others have to face. The Brooklyn Bridge  shows us that dreams that seem impossible can be realized with determination  and persistence, no matter what the odds are.   Even the most distant dream can be realized with determination and  persistence.     Be the Change YOU Want to Bring About

      Ever thought of spending a good part of the night at office...?? its been long time I posted something... and I finally felt like posting... a simple way to celebrate my presence in office at 2300 hrs... its kind of different to work with that tinge of sleep lingering on the corner of the eyelid... and u keep trying hard to pull up ur eyelashes to keep the eye open for just a little while longer... when u feel like a pillow would be more than a luxury to let u have a good night's sleep... and amid all this u keep doing that little piece of thing called "work"...

      The QSS blog got spammed yesterday. Some bloody @&*&%# spammer had posted comments yesterday. It took me quite a lot of time in deleting them and closing all the open posts. So I have decided to close all comments after a week. I still don't know if I had deleted all the spam comments.  But to a hectic schedule, I missed out watching the Euro 2004 Cup matches in tha last week. But thanks to  urlLink BBC , I was able to watch the goals scored. You might need to install the latest version of  urlLink Shockwave  if you don't have it. I suggest you download the latest one. It is worth the download.

      We have seen Spiderman swinging from American monuments several times. Now we can get to see him on Indian monuments soon.  We wont't be seeing him in a complete body hugging suit. Instead our friendly Indian neighbourhood spiderman will be wearing an Indian traditional kurta with a mask ofcourse.  No, I am not talking about a Bollywood version of the Spiderman blockbuster series. I am talking about Spider-Man India, the comics.   Marvel COmics is bringing out a Indian version of Spiderman.   "Spider-Man India interweaves the local customs, culture and mystery of modern India, with an eye to making Spider-Man’s mythology more relevant to this particular audience."  Read more about it  urlLink here . Nice desktop pictures are also available.

       urlLink FireFox 0.9   has been released yesterday.  Due to heavy traffic, the Mozilla FireFox site is swamped. I found it very difficult to connect to the website. The latest version is smaller than the previous versions (around 4.8MB). Anyway any one of you wants it, I can mail it to you (i.e if your mail server can handle 5 MB attachments).

      We were topped a Rupee a day for that additional service... Nothing comes for free.... Somebody is incurring the cost for the benefit that other guy is receiving!!!   Even if it comes to ration / free elec or anything... it will cost the tax payers / national fund etc...  Coming to Anonymous rubbish SMS, those who ought to send will do at any COST...  More lessons have to be learned.

      Airtel raised the local sms rates to 30ps for Aitel-Airtel... which was free until then.. and national sms to Rs.2 from 30ps... If the latter was accepted with a squeaky frown by the users (including yours truly), the former was a shocker... How the hell can they charge for something which was free until now.. After all, in Chennai/TN people enjoy free national sms..   We could find a couple of unpleasant things about the mobile services that I hope would change sooner than later.. but when it comes to charging I feel Airtel (and other service providers in Karnataka) has set the right example which ought to be tagged on by others as well...   My queston is.. Why do u want something for free..?? Businesses are not here to give something out for nothing... Talking of a capitalistic economy which forms the order of the world, its as simple as 'if u use something, pay for it'.. Freebies make people take things for granted... atleast.. in the case of sms its very true... There are umpteen girls who get some rubbish sms to their mobiles from anonymous numbers... Just because sms is free some unscrupulous idiots resort to such insane mischiefs.. Lets see how much of this comes when sms is charged at Rs.2.   Besides this, with such freebies the means outlives the purpose... phone/mobile/sms/mms are primarily a means of communication and not for teen hijacking... there are many articles in papers where parents of teens worry about their child's addiction to sending messages which cost absolutely nothing to the parents in terms of money but costs a lot to their peace of mind... and not to mention unnecessary distraction for the teens for whom the "interesting" anonymous guy at the other end always adds lots of "glamour" to their living...  The moment u add a price tag.. its intersting how things change rapidly... teens need to go back to parents if they want to dole out some currency for their mobile.. thereby giving parents an idea of their usage and hence a constant check... the mischievous jacks are sure to find spending 2 rupees for every mischief they do become harder by the day.. after all, if this is their only occupation then they are likely to run out of money soon... and for the other "professional" users this would make their hair sit up and use the means within the boundary of its purpose...  In the age when we talk of removing all subsidies and a no free electricity for farmers syndrome et. al., why should the salaried class be spared with freebies..???   A lesson learnt..!!

      Friends and supporters of Tejas Parmar, a programmer with SysMind, say he's in urgent need of rehabilitation after sustaining fractures in his neck region and paralysis of the lower body.  ....the situation, she said, points to an extreme double standard in America's health care system. "If [other] short-term immigrants come here, is this what they will face if they get injured?" she asked.  Read  urlLink full-story .

      Narayana Murthy on BBC...  We believe that if India has to solve its problem of poverty, we have to embrace capitalism, ensure that jobs are created, and make sure that market-driven policies are accepted," he said. "However, to do that, the people who are the evangelists of capitalism, must conduct themselves in a manner that will appeal to the masses.   "People must be able to relate to them easily. They must lead a normal life, a simple life, and people must be able to say, 'look, if these jokers can do it, we can do it better'."   Read  urlLink full-story

       Ayuthe Ezhuthu was nice. I have watched it twice in the last week. Anyway, I was wondering what   யாக்ைக திரி   meant until I found about it  urlLink here .  Incidentally, I also found about the new features in  urlLink Nokia's 3220  there. "Wave writing" seems to be an interesting idea. I wonder when it is released in India.

         John Grisham's  The Last Juror  kept me   company during the journey back home last night. Heavy rains and traffic kept me   seated for almost three hours. Luckily I had the book to read. otherwise, it   would have been a terrible waste of time. But somehow I managed to get home   without getting soaked.  Ram and Kicha, how did you fare last night?

      Heavy rains brought traffic to a standstill last night. I had been enjoying my nap in the bus while my mobile rang. It was someone from Citibank. The executive wanted to know if I wanted a credit card. I noticed I had a new message waiting for me in the inbox. It went like this: "Hi Xavier, r u stil n office? Sorry it took me so long 2 contact u. no excuses! Forgive this poor girl". I was surprised to see the name at the end of the message. It was Sinduja.  I called her back. We decided to meet. There was a blackout at Koramangala. It took me some time to find her place. She is enjoying life at Wipro's guest quarters. Three people at her beck and call. Hmmm. I should have utilized the services when I had the chance. I spent a couple of hours chatting with her and catching up on the latest news on everyone.  Today, she is attending an interview in some software company. She promised to give us a treat once she moves into a new house(she is shifting this weekend in Koramangala).

      The day of the first budget of the new congress Govt... And there are hopes afloat.. on what Mr.PC would unveil to the billon people of the country... surprisingly, he would also be more worried about pleasing a few tens of people rather than this billion.. the few tens I'm referring to are the noble-hearted, people-minded, kind, generous, compassionate lot called the communists...   How far would it be a dream budget in the lines of what Mr.PC presented in 1997.. his only other budget... that won him laurels across the salaried and waged class alike... VDIS was touted to be one of the revolutions he envisaged.. so much as the concept of competition postcards.. This time however, Mr.PC is facing a brand new India... economies are at an unseen height... Forex is plumpy at $119bn.. all he needs to do is to continue the good work that has been happening in the country... Hope Mr.PC springs up another one just like the good ol' fella that he is...
