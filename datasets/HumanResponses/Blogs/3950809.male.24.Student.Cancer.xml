      Wow! Had a fantastic night with me buddies at Cydus (a gaming cafe)! I think it was the best game we played so far, with the largest turn out (10 in total) too! Competing with one another and against each other, shooting and throwing (gre)nades frantically at each other (more like at TANKS while on foot... heh), there's no better way to get an adrenaline rush than that! Especially with your mates at the end of a long tiring semester!    Dinner was good. Ate at Laksa King but with a smaller group. Actually bumped into Dawn, Nelson, Eddie and Stephanie (more of the other way round...). Quite surprising in a way cos Dawn called me to ask directions to a place called Raffles Place (no, not the Spore Place). And a couple minutes later, they walk in. Beat that!    Well, last week of hols before I start a gruelling 15 week semester that will be intense from start to finish. Hope I survive. :S Thinking of "preparing" for next semester - going through my surgery notes just to refresh my mind (more like to retrieve what I've already forgotten long ago). Mom's been "reminding" me to do that so I should shouldn't I? :)    To sleep I shall, some shut eye and comfort in my nice warm cosy bed under my soft all-encompassing doona. Shall think of what to do tomorrow... besides sending my prized possession, my beautifully crafted, sexy and gorgeous dreadnought acoustic Maton guitar for a long-overdued servicing at one of the guitar shops in Melbourne. About time I think. ;)

      This is quite interesting. Writing a blog. Recording your thoughts and  feelings with a virtual pen on a virtual paper hoping that it doesn't  get virtually wiped out. :P Right... I'm bored and what else can I do?  What else do people with spare time do except blog, right? Join the  club I said.      Anyway, I have no real idea how this looks. I have no idea how to  change the look of my blog. I think it's HTML or something... Don't  think I'll improve myself by learning how to use it. I'll just focus on  one thing now...      Well, term starts in 1 week. Can't say that I'm looking forward to it.  I think it'll be exciting but very tough. Will be doing my surgical  rotation at Geelong for 5 weeks. I don't know how I'm going to wake up  at 6.30am just to be at the handover (handover of patients by the  overnight staff) at 7am. It's crazy! I think I'd need 3 alarms. Also  just found out that my days will be rather long... as long as an  intern. We'll basically be shadowing them throughout their shift.  That's about 10 hours a day. Maybe longer if we have tutes at the end  of the day. I guess it's about time I start training myself waking up  at an ungodly hour. How will I survive next year? :S *sigh*      Can't wait till the results of the matching process are released. 9th  of Aug. Applied for internship in Vic and WA and the results of my  application (along with every other full-fee-paying student who  applied) will be released on the above date. WA will take a little  longer. If all goes well (and God shows His favour upon me!), I may  just get a job offer... We'll see.
