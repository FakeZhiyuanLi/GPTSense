      So now it's "official" - anyone opposed to Israel is defined by Webster as anti-semitic. Isn't there another dictionary that we could demand be used besides Webster's? Why can't we create our own damn dictionaries - how did Amerikkka and Israel suddenly get the power to dictate the definitions of words of a language spoken by millions?   Maybe we should all boycott the english language completely, i'd be down for that...  This is a great line in the article below:  "it is Zionism, and not anti-Zionism, that is the equivalent of anti-Semitism."   ANTI-ZIONISM VS. ANTI-SEMITISM WEBSTER'S AMERICAN-ISRAELI DICTIONARY  Al-Ayyam (p. 18) by Ali Al-Khalil -- [June 28] In this time of escalated oppressive Israeli practices against our people, our rights and existence in our torn and devastated homeland, any criticism of Israeli policy is automatically translated into "anti-Semitism." This is prevalent in both the Israeli political-cultural-media discourse and its American counterpart, which conforms to the Israeli discourse of falsification. No matter the nationality, identity or association of the critic, this systematic Israeli-American change, or "conversion," turns him into an "anti-Semite" who is haunted everywhere by this discourse and is besieged and stifled by the dangerous accusations of "anti-Semitism."  The Israeli-American discourse silences any voice that is critical of Israel's policy with a firm, terrorist policy of silencing. This kills those voices, distorts and discreds them, and silences other voices that dare merely to approach the threshold of this forbidden and hunted criticism. On both the declarative and practical levels, the current American policy of a world war on "terrorism," as per the modern colonialist and imperialist definition of this term worldwide, has increasingly become intertwined with Israel's policy, particularly in the Middle East. This discourse encompasses a greater Middle East, which is comprised of the Arab world, Afghanistan, Pakistan and Iran. Silencing by means of leveling accusations of "anti-Semitism" has silenced the voices that criticize American policy (crimes) in the Middle East.  It is an historical and geographical fact that "anti-Semitism" is strictly a European term that was born in Europe and spread across the continent. It entered European languages for economic, social, cultural and political reasons that stemmed from that European reality. The term was religiously based and meant being against Jews or Judaism in Europe. The term was coined by the German journalist Wilhelm Marr in 1877 in his book, The Victory of Judaism over Germanism. But Zionist thinking sought to strip this term of its historical and geographical constrictions so it might, early on, successfully impose a formula equating anti-Semitism with anti-Zionism.  At first, the Zionist ideology that Israel was built on failed to impose this abusive formula on any governmental or civil body outside Israel. In the fall of 1975, the UN passed an important resolution to confront the Zionist goal by deeming Zionism to be a racist movement, just as anti-Semitism is racist. To wit, it is Zionism, and not anti-Zionism, that is the equivalent of anti-Semitism.  The UN resolution turned the Zionist formula upside down and contributed to the exposure of the truth that Zionism is a racist movement. It is a religious movement that is focused on a formula of settlement, occupation and displacement-relocation (occupying Palestine, expelling and exterminating its Palestinian Arab people and relocating Jews in their stead), by means of invasion and violence as a solution for the Jewish problem.   Ten years later, Israel was able (more correctly, the US was able) to force the UN to rescind this resolution by issuing a new one that defined Zionism as a national liberation movement . etc.  In the new UN resolution, Zionism practically spits in the face of the highest legislative body in the world while, at the same time, Israel, with its deep-rooted Zionist ideology, has refused to comply with all of this body's resolutions regarding the Palestinian cause and has made a mockery the UN. Israel perceived the UN to be nothing more than an old colorful rag, as one of its Zionist thinkers once put it, when it passed the revised resolution that we have the right to call the resolution of submission to the American-Israeli tyranny, or the resolution of "defection," or the humiliating betrayal of international law and the facts of history and geography.  After that achievement, Zionist thinking went back to work to achieve its goal of equating anti-Semitism with anti-Zionism. A few days ago-and 20 years after the "defection" resolution was passed- I learned that the new edition of the American dictionary, Webster, includes a new definition of anti-Semitism. The new entry notes that an anti-Semite is "one who opposes Zionism and sympathizes with the enemies of Israel."  In this definition, the Israeli-Zionist-American falsification was not satisfied with equating anti-Semitism with anti-Zionism, it compounded the distortion and the stifling of critical voices by silencing anyone who sympathizes with Arab and Palestinian rights in the confrontation against Israeli aggression. This rendered those "rights," which are supported by international law, "enemies of the state of Israel."  This clearly terrorist definition did not appear in a newspaper article, an internet site or in a political speech. It arrived fixed and firm in a famous dictionary that is used worldwide.  The Palestinian representative at the Arab League was on the lookout for this dangerous development. He demanded that this dictionary be boycotted by all organizations, institutions and committees, and that "it should not be approved [for use] in the Arab world until the aggression and distortion of truth is corrected." When will this correction take place? Will it really happen? The Arab American Anti-Discrimination Committee reportedly has lodged a complaint with the publisher, insisting that a correction or "change" be made. But it was met with a deaf ear.   At any rate, the "correction" or "change" or call it whatever you wish, if it ever is made, won't occur until the next edition of the dictionary is published. That means that it will take at least ten years, by which point this terrorist definition will become known all over the world, including in the Arab world!  Israel now is taking advantage of this definition not just to silence its policy's critics, but also to bring more European Jews for relocation in occupied Palestinian lands. Israel has set its sights particularly on the Jews of France, after its political-media discourse successfully spread the idea that "anti-Semitism" has become a "daily phenomenon" in France. The solution, therefore, is for the Jews of France to immigrate to Israel.  The Israeli newspaper Ma'ariv recently reported that hundreds of Jewish Agency activists, with the direct support of the Sharon government, have already arrived in Paris to launch "an unprecedented immigration campaign." The paper quoted a senior official in the Jewish Agency who was made responsible for the French Jews as saying, "the atmosphere in France is ripe and we must not squander the opportunity."  The Israeli newspaper Ha'aretz reported on June 11 that the Israeli government was planning to absorb 55,000 new settlers in the largest new settlement that is being built to the south of Jerusalem. With that, the Israeli government is preparing, in advance, more than 13,000 housing units on stolen Palestinian land for the immediate welcome of the new immigrants/settlers.  Is boycotting the dictionary sufficient? Is demanding a change of the definition sufficient? There are other means of stopping the aggression. What is amazing is, as I presume, that we can be sure to find the Webster dictionary warmly welcomed in our prosperous libraries!

      have been incommunicado due to travelling. there's so much to write about.   a couple weeks ago, an indian friend of mine told me a pretty disturbing story. she was in new york with some other desi friends and it was late at nite (after the bars and clubs had closed) and they were looking for a place to get some food. they saw a small young crowd of what turned out to be arabs, and they asked them if they could recommend a place to eat. one of the arab women in the group was speaking loudly in arabic to the others there; my friend heard her say a long string of something in arabic and finish it off with "Fucking Pakistanis!". Needless to say, a confrontation almost ensued.   my friend asked me if this is a common occurence, is there tension between arabs and pakistanis (even though she's indian), why would that woman say such a thing?   the sad thing is, i had no good answer to give her. "many arabs are racist towards desis" i told her. i told her about how there is a lebanese variety show of sorts that comes on arab satellite and one night we had it on and there were two lebanese guys dressed in "browner" face, dancing around like idiots, and putting on hindi accents while the audience (primarily fair skinned lebanese) laughed their asses off.  but of course i added that there is racism on many levels, i.e. light skinned arabs towards dark skinned arabs, arabs towards desis, arabs towards blacks, etc.  how do you define "arab" anyway?

       The title is a link to the full article in Al-Ahram.    Very typical. Neighboring arab governments are collaborating with the zionist entity on how to deal with "the Palestinian problem". See, the Palestinians are not just a "cancer" to the zionists, Palestinians are not welcome anywhere. Check the excerpt below:  "Egypt has agreed to send 200 military experts to Gaza and the West Bank to shape the Palestinian Authority's (PA) dissolute and mutinous security outfits into some kind of police force. One hundred guards will also be moved up to seal Egypt's porous border with Gaza, seen by Israelis as an entry port for Palestinian arms. But it is not just about Israel's security. "Tunnels have two ends," said one Egyptian security official."

      Thanks Jac for sending this to me.   This is no joke, there may be a draft coming up which means OUR brothers could end up being sent to murder iraqis, afghanis, and whoever else is on the empire's blacklist. Even without this draft, they are recruiting our youth HARD. They are in the high schools, offering around $12,000 sign-on bonuses (to 16/17/18 year olds!), promising free educations, career opportunities...all of my friends who did sign on tell me "we never thought this would have ever happened (going to war), otherwise we wouldn't have signed on".  and when you're just getting out of high school, not sure what you want to do next, not sure how you're going to pay for it - the military is right there waving money/education/careers in your face as if it's free. but those who sign on pay the heaviest price in the end...  spread the word. especially about these high schoolers who are taking action!    June 6, 2004  NORTH SIDE -- Students at Senn High School at 5900 N. Glenwood Ave. are  taking action after hearing political leaders are talking about reinstating  the draft.  A petition is circulating at the school and students are sending e-mails  and writing letters to their congressmen in protest of two bills: U.S.  Senate Bill 89 and House Bill 163. The bill would require all young persons  in the United States between the ages of 18 and 26, including women, to  perform a period of military service or civilian service.  Brandi Mora, a volunteer with Amnesty International, said she was floored  by the students' reaction.  "They wanted to know as much as they could because they were so upset by  it," she said. "They wanted to know who they needed to write to and what  they could do to stop it. I just didn't think that they would be that  passionate about wanting to stop something that is really political."   Copyright © 2004, Chicago Tribune

      Jammed to radiohead in the car (i don't typically listen to them that often, but they are musical geniuses) and arrived at the office. What a crazy change of environment. Same security guard every morning, exchange fake smiles (which i've stopped doing completely here) as you show him your badge, up to the sixth floor (when i'm being good i'll take the stairs), sneak past dull, empty walls into the office real quick since i'm late as usual...  spend as long as possible getting "settled in" - get the computer on, get the coffee, fill up the water bottle, bathroom, back to the desk, pick music, check email...check more email....surf the web... officemate number one stops by for a full 30 minutes. People walking by with disapproving looks.... finally i am here, settled in, and writing this. I don't think anyone in the office spends more than a couple hours a day doing actual work.   Everyone is dying a slow death here - in one of the highest polluted areas in the country, across from exxonmobil's largest oil refinery. Superficial living - no one gives a damn how you're really doing, no one gives a damn that we are polluting and killing the local community, no one even cares when employees join the casualties of cancer - who are MANY in this town. Soul-sucking, mind-numbing, dull, dry corporate world - especially here in the all-amerikkkan corporation, the original oil company re-united,  in the middle of big-truckin', alamo-lovin', bush-supportin' HOUSTON, TEXAS.   How the hell did i end up here?!?!?!?!?

      1. Where has my language gone? The poet searches for words to wrap around these times Make them sense   Make them pretty   Make them useful  Words from the past haunt our conversations Empire and Crusade Plans and Centuries All these words cleared understanding before Fall heavy now And weightless into this abyss of bad news  I have seen the photographs Again words   Prison   Torture  Desperate for words I can write That are not profane   That are objective   Read as rational So people will not stop reading this self-conscious poem So my parents will not be embarrassed So Americans will demand the return of their own  Desperate for words I can write So I can keep from becoming something hard and unforgiving  Language has failed me  I am told to believe nothing I read Then everything I read I am given my own face to be wary of I am told to fear colors as alerts I am told over and over Iraq is not Palestine Kabul is not New York  The photos Women Raped Posed as girls gone wild This is entertainment   This is staged   This is recorded Men Chained Do words such as humiliation and torture Truly fit the immensity of these acts? What happens to those who survive? What happens to those responsible?  Haiti is not Chechnya Chiapas is not East L.A. Iraq is not Palestine Over and over I am told  I am given a vantage point and a lens and instructed Do not move   Do not look up   Do not look down  I am falling  2. No connections here No illuminated parallels Two different histories and two different peoples Make no links Do not confuse the issues  Only confuse the people  For 56 years Israel has legitimized This type of behavior Sanctioned violence in the name of a god Who does not have enough love for us all A god who chooses sides A god who has favorites and chosen ones A god who cuts deals and shuffles souls The type of god who does not answer prayers Who understands only one language A god who does not worry his beautiful mind with Such ugliness I am told this is America’s god  The photos from Rafah Palestine It is 1948 and 2004 in the same frame Their eyes say to the camera What will you do with this pain? Where will you take it? Can you take it from me?  This space between the lens and the subjects Is concentrated with pleas for witness With promises of cycles unbroken With children’s bicycles under the rubble of once were homes  Another level of exile is being constructed  And I am falling  Aaagghh, ya Phalesteen What is it about us they hate so much? This face?  These eyes?  This obstinate refusal to die? How much trauma can one nation endure with the world staring? Some mouths open in shock Others silent and sneering While women scream at a frequency the living cannot hear Again?   Again ya Phalesteen?  3. How fucked up is it that I have to choose between ending One occupation or another? Partition my time and portion my information  I have to make Nice   Play Fair and Polite When I want to tear open my chest to void it of this emptiness This ache has eaten into my head and wears down my dreams My friends worry I am not eating enough Am taking too much on   Too much in I find nowhere to rest this responsibility  If I say nothing I am complicit If I say something I am isolated as extreme As a theorist in conspiracy As if war is ever a coincidence As if genocide simply happens  This is about oil and land and water This is about illusion and the taking on of airs The poor once again the munitions in rich men’s cannons  This is about light and dark There is no black and white in humanity  I am told Venezuela is not Cuba Rwanda is not Kurdistan  I am not the woman kneeling In front of soldiers and their cameras and their weapons I am not the child shot in the head by the Israeli Defense Forces I am not the starving AIDS inflicted mother Praying I live longer than my children So they will not be orphaned and sick and have to bury me I am not the child who watched Her family chopped to death in Lebanon   in Sudan   in Nicaragua I am not the father who leaves his children so as not to hear their empty Bellies call out Baba, where is the bread?  I am the woman whose taxes outfitted this tragedy The American the Authority does not speak for The Arab the Arab leaders do not speak for The woman whose shouts of Not in My Name Were spit back at me as a slogan of the misguided at best I am the girl from Brooklyn told to mind her business I am the poet in search of new words And a new world   Not Mars  4. We use antiquated terms that cannot stretch enough to touch this truth We have not learned from the past enough to not repeat it  I am told it has always been this way War and Pillage Rape is older than prostitution And prostitution is the oldest politic The way the world has always been The pimps and those they pimp  The human race has always left Those who fall behind  If I am to survive then I learn from the present From the future promised  We learn to live with madness One cannot be healthy in a sick world Only navigate illnesses   Only medicate wounds Pray you are not contagious Try to hurt no one  My elders say dissent has always been watched Radical ideas have always been recorded But even those who have lived on the margins admit Under breath   It has never been this bad  Not everyone is suffering   True Most thirst A few swim in pools that fake connection to seas Most starve I throw away meals I have no appetite for You can shop from your couch and eat food fast And never think about anything other than your credit card debt And the next hour’s purchases Shop and stop asking questions I have envied this stupor Even knowing it is the least honorable suicide Even knowing its apathy is another kind of murder  5. Sometimes all you can do is inhale and exhale Life a shallow version of its potential Sometimes all you can do is search for life where you are In the city   A flash of yellow on the basketball court The divine geometry in the pattern of a girl’s hijab  For a week I have been cleaning and knifing enough Parsley for tabbouleh to feed hundreds I pray over the green That what I make will feed those in need of a meal  There is still love in us The proof is that we are watching it die There is still hope in us Hope is there in my sisters’ eyes There is still enough resistance in us To create a world where there is no Your people or my people But our people Our people who kill   Our people who are killed  I somehow know love will save us The proof is in the stories not broadcast The poems not published The truth between the lies The stories whispered in the dusk of this day  I know somehow love will save us Though I can’t find the passion or desire in my body to make it There is still a source for peace deeply embedded in this chaos  I know love will save us Though words fail to point out how  Amazingly I still pray To a god I envision to be larger than any nation   Any religion  And I still hunt for language to gather into a poem That I pray will feed those like me In need of proof they are not alone

      Another translation by Nihaya.    Al-Hayat Al-Jadida (p. 20) by Ahmed Dahbour -- [June 3] Until this moment, I still do not know where I can and cannot travel. And I still do not understand how the world sleeps soundly while the occupation authorities practice collective punishment on this tortured miserable people. The moment I had to go somewhere, I went-as all Palestinians do-to inquire at the border crossing. I received a full, satisfactory and clear response: It depends on your luck!!  Me and my luck? How? [.] The occupation authorities torture our people for whatever reasons of their own. This torture is not in forbidding us to travel, but in confusing us. If you want to check out the possibility of traveling, you have to bid the children farewell as if you are headed for the sea of death. Allah may destine you to be safe and you will arrive in Rafah with the memory the roadblocks and whatever else happened. At the crossing you see bewildered people, unshaven faces of people tired of traveling, people who are exhausted by waiting. You don't have the energy to ask if the crossing is working or not because with the instinct of the powerless, you try to postpone the response. I do not advise you to harden your heart because the response might not be negative, but don't be happy because I don't guarantee a positive response. But it will be, as experience proves, somewhere in between. [.]  This is not the comic part of a boring novel. It's a reality that at least Kofi Annan knows about. And there is no Moroccan fortuneteller or a computer wiz who can provide the answer. Why does this happen to us out of all humanity? Must we be reminded of the biological coincidence that we are humans, like all humans, with needs and capabilities of endurance? And that we have elderly, children and ill people among us? And if the occupier is sick with the pleasure of torture, how can his sadism be satisfied when he does not see us? And how can he see us when he makes his insane decisions to hinder travel or hinder the thought of the possibility of traveling without knowing what happens to the tortured in this land?  But no ..  We don't want this sick enemy to feel sorry for us or have mercy on us. He is an occupying enemy and we are the owners of the occupied land. In our culture an old poet used to say: Allah knows that we don't love you and we don't blame you if you don't love us. If this is the price for rejecting the occupation, then close the border crossing. But will you stay here forever? As for us, we are staying in our homeland forever.

      This article was translated by my good friend, Nihaya. Of course it shouldn't be surprising that Zionists have no regard for nature. Clearly they have no regard for human life, so why should they feel guilty about uprooting thousands of olive trees if they don't feel guilty about uprooting thousands (millions) of palestinians from their homes? It's ironic that their propoganda claims that they made "the desert bloom", when they are the ones causing the desertification of Palestine. Here is the article:   Al-Hayat Al-Jadida (p. 20) by Hafeth Barghouthi -- [June 3] The Dead Sea will die again, but this time at the hands of a murderer, after the water from the Jordan River was sucked up by the occupation. The Jordan River will die too, as a result of Israel's thirst for water for the settlements. Every Israeli farm depends on irrigation while our farms depend on the sky's mercy. The occupation does not have a merciful relationship with the sky, and the riverbeds have dried up and are filled with piles of junk and garbage. The laurel trees have dried in the riverbeds and are covered with plastic bags and rags from the settlements' pollution. The settlement of Ariel dumps its filthy water into the riverbed from Salfit to Brukhin and has destroyed the fresh water springs. Wild boars that destroy plants have multiplied on their banks. Every settlement has its filthy sewage that harms nature. Even the land has died as a result of intensive farming and chemical insecticides and fertilizers. The water aquifers in the West Bank and the coast have been polluted. And I believe that all the water springs have been polluted and are not good for human consumption. As for the birds, they no longer sing in the riverbeds. Many eagles, hawks and goldfinches and other birds have gone extinct because the occupation had introduced insecticides that killed the birds while the wild boars multiplied.  This land is slowly becoming a desert and is drying up. The settlements have not left any hilltop, but rather have landed on them like crows of bad omens. There is no riverbed they have not polluted, not even a drop of water has been left without being muddied, and the wall, like a wolf, will devour more vineyards and fields.  On the international day for nature, I thought of our environment and nature. The occupation has not left us any nature. It has transformed everything into its own horrible wolf nature. It destroys nature, farms, humans, stones and cows. As if it has sentenced life on this land to death! A few days ago I looked at the land I grew up in, the riverbed west of my village. There are no longer birds sharing a sweet tune in the oak trees. Even the eagle that hunts snakes no longer flies in the sky and in its nest on a tree, his babies call for food. The shepherds say that a huge snake thick as a tire lives in the riverbed and eats everything that comes in its path. Even the flocks of birds no longer are heard in the valley. There is only the dung of wild boars, a huge snake and occupation and they are all destruction and anti-nature.

      Nizar Qabbani: "I am with Terrorism"   We are accused of terrorism: if we defended rose and woman and the mighty verse ... and the blueness of sky ... A dominion .. nothing left therein... No water, no air .. No tent, no camel, and not even dark Arabica coffee!!  We are accused of terrorism: if we defended with guts  the hair of Balqis and the lips of Maysun if we defended Hind, and Da`d Lubna and Rabab .. and the stream of Kohl coming down from their lashes like the verses of revelation. You will not find with me a secret poem or a secret logos or books I put behind doors. I do not even have one Qasidah walking down the street, wearing Hijab.  We are accused of terrorism: if we wrote about the ruins of a watan torn, weak ... a watan with no address and an ummah with no names  I seek the remnants of a watan none of its grand poems is left except the bemoans of Khansa.  I seek a dominion in whose horizons no freedom can be found red .. blue or yellow.  A watan forbidding us from bying a newspaper or listening to the news. A dominion wherein birds are forbidden from chirping. A watan wherein, out of terror [ru`b], its writers got accustomed to write about nothing.  A watan, in the likeness of poetry in our lands: It is vain talk,  no rhythm, imported Ajam, with a crooked face and tongue: No beginning No end No relation with people's worry mother earth and the crisis of man.  A dominion ... going to peace talks with no honor no shoe.  A watan, men peed in their pans .. women are those left to defend honor.  Salt in our eyes Salt in our lips Salt in our words Can the self carry such dryness? An inheritance we got from the barren Qahtan? In our Ummah, no Mu`awiya, and no Abu Sufiyan No one is left to say "NO" and face the quitters they gave up our houses, our bread and our [olive] oil. They transformed our bright history into a mediocre store.  In our lives, no Qasidah is left, since we lost our chastity in the bed of the Sultan.  They got accustomed to us, the humbled. What is left to man when all that remains  is disgrace.  I seek in the books of history  Ussamah ibn al-Munqith Uqba ibn Nafi` Omar, and Hamzah and Khalid, driving his flocks conquering the Shem. I seek a Mu`tasim Billah Saving women from the cruelty of rape and the fire.  I seek latter days men All I can see is frightened cats Scared for their own souls, from  the sultanship of mice.  Is this an overwhelming national blindness? Are we blind to colors?  We are accused of terrorism  If we refuse to die with Israel's bulldozers tearing our land tearing our history tearing our Evangelium tearing our Koran tearing the graves of our prophets If this was our sin, then, lo, how beautiful terrorism is?  We are accused of terrorism  if we refused to be effaced by the hands of the Mogul, Jews and Barbarians if we throw a stone at the glass of the the Security Council after the Ceasar of Ceasars got a hold of it.  We are accused of terrorism if we refuse to negociate with the wolf and shake the hand with a whore  Amrika Against the cultures of the peoples with no culture Against the civilizations of the civilized with no civilization Amrika a mighty edifice with no walls!  We are accused of terrorism: if we refused an era Amrika became  the foolish, the rich, the mighty translated, sworn in Ivri.  We are accused of terrorism: if we throw a rose to Jerusalem to al-Khalil to Ghazza to an-Nasirah if we took bread and water to beleaguered Troy.  We are accused of terrorism: if we raised our voices against the regionalists of our leaders. All changed their rides: from Unionists to Brokers.  If we committed the heinous crime of culture if we revolted against the orders of the grand caliph and the seat of the caliphate If we read jurisprudence or politics If we recalled God and read Surat al-Fat-h  [that Chapter of Conquest]. If we listened to the Friday sermon then we are well-established in the art of terrorism  We are accused of terrorism if we defended land and the honor of dust if we revolted against the rape of people and our rape if we defended the last palm trees in our desert the last stars in our sky the last syllabi of our names the last milk in our mothers' bossoms if this was our sin how beautiful is terrorism.  I am with terrorism if it is able to save me from the immigrants from Russia Romania, Hungaria, and Poland  They settled in Palestine set foot on our shoulders to steal the minarets of al-Quds and the door of Aqsa to steal the arabesques and the domes.  I am with terrorism  if it will free the Messiah, Jesus of Nazareth, and the virgin, Meriam Betula and the holy city from the ambassadors of death and desolation  Yesteryear The nationalist street was fervent like a wild horse. The rivers were abundant with the spirit of youth.  But after Olso, we no longer had teeth: we are now a blind and lost people.  We are accused of terrorism: if we defended with full-force our poetic heritage our national wall our rosy civilization the culture of flutes in our mountains and the mirrors displaying blackened eyes.  We are accused of terrorism: if we defended what we wrote El azure of our sea and the aroma of ink if we defended the freedom of the word and the holiness of books  I am with terrorism  if it is able to free a people  from tyrants and tyranny if it is able to save man from the cruelty of man to return lemon, olive tree, and bird to the South of Lebanon and the smile back to Golan  I am with terrorism  if it will save me  from the Ceasar of Yehuda and the Ceasar of Rome  I am with terrorism  as long as this new world order is shared between Amrika and Israel half-half  I am with terrorism  with all my poetry with all my words and all my teeth as long as this new world is in the hands of a butcher.  I am with terrorism  if the U.S. Senate enacts judgement decrees reward and punishment  I am with Irhab [terrorism] as long this new world order hates the smell of A`rab.  I am with terrorism  as long as the new world order wants to slaughter my off-spring. and send them to dogs.  For all this  I raise my voice high:  I am with terrorism I am with terrorism I am with terrorism ...   Nizar Qabbani London, 15 Nisan (April) 1997.

      (the title is a link)   It all works out so perfectly for Israel: they get to test all their amerikkkan-made toys on the palestinians - specially-made amored caterpillar bulldozers, apache helicopters, unknown chemicals and gases, etc. Meanwhile saudi princes are partying all around the world, dropping money as if the whole world were partying with them, and the money that DOES get sent to the palestinians goes straight to Suha Arafat's private account so she can get the latest designer wear while she's living it up in France.  Sickening.

      Last nite several of us went to see the movie "Carandiru"...on the way out, we set up an assembly line and made chicken shawerma to eat in the theatre. Just as we all busted out the shawerma (and smelled up the entire theatre), some jerk comes in there and points at us "You, you and you - i don't want to see any of this after the movie!". Was hard not to laugh, especially considering i had left a pile of eaten bizir (watermelon seeds) on the floor...  About Carandiru, the movie is about the incredible life in the largest jail in Brazil and ends with the tragic massacre committed by the state, which murdered over 100 of the prisoners. One of my friends commented that there was more life in that prison than there is in american society. Some of the more interesting things about the movie include: the prison warden and his open acknowledgement that it was the prisoners who ran the prison (not himself), the way all the rest of the prisoners treated the rapist (even the convicted killers didn't believe he deserved any mercy), and when one poor brother who had killed many many people desperately asked the doctor if there was a cure for guilt. There is much more to the movie, it mostly centers around a doctor who commits himself to helping fight AIDS and other diseases in the extremely over-crowded prison.  I highly recommend it - it's beautiful and horrifying at the same time.  but why do they bother to demolish places like that? Just like how they are promising to demolish abu ghraib. What the hell does it change? Of course the concept of locking people up like animals is beyond me, but why do they pretend that prison demolition puts an end to the torture, massacres, and other extreme atrocities committed by the state? When so many of these places are way over their capacity, are breeding grounds for all sorts of diseases, sources of slave labor for corporations and social experiments for the governments...

      It's midday on Friday, the weekend is almost here. As usual, i'm wondering how i got myself into the living-for-the-weekend lifestyle. My brain has shut off two days ago, after one of those boring-ass day-long meetings. Meanwhile, so many people around me are travelling the globe while i'm stuck here with only a few vacation days left till the end of the year.   Sometimes i don't know where the lines between morality, stupidity, and selfishness are anymore. And when have I ever let fear hold me back?   i am coming more and more to the realization that i need to learn to appreciate life. even with all the bullshit that surrounds all of us. quit trippin' over everything and look out for our sanity.   so, a sister has invited me to take part in a fast with her, and i accepted with no hesitation. i already know that she is and will always be a blessing in my life, sent from someone/something knowing my sanity was on the way out the door.   well it's lunch break time. let me get out of this office building and into the toxic Baytown breeze...

      A Black Woman Speaks...  Of White Womanhood  Of White Supremacy  Of Peace  It is right that I a woman  black,  should speak of white womanhood.  My fathers  my brothers  my husbands  my sons  dies for it; because of it.  And their blood chilled in electric chairs,  stopped by hangman's noose,  cooked by lynch mob's fire,  spilled by white supremacist mad desire to kill for profit,  gives me that right.   I would that I could speak of white womanhood  as it will and should be  when it stands tall in full equality.  But then, womanhood will be womanhood  void of color and of class,  and all necessity for my speaking thus will be past.  Gladly past.   But now, since 'tis deemed a thing apart  Supreme,  I must in searching honestly report  how it seems to me.  White womanhood stands in bloodied skirt  and willing slavery  reaching out adulterous hand  killing mine and crushing me.  What then is this superior thing  that in order to be sustained must needs feed upon my flesh?  How came this horror to be?  Let's look to history.   They said, the white supremacist said  that you were better than me,  that your fair brow should never know the sweat of slavery.  They lied.  White womanhood too is enslaved,  the difference is degree.   They brought me here in chains.  They brought you here willing slaves to man.  You, shiploads of women each filled with hope  that she might win with ruby lip and saucy curl  and bright flashing eye  him to wife who had the largest tender.  Remember?  And they sold you here even as they sold me.  My sisters, there is no room for mockery.  If they counted my teeth  they did appraise your thigh  and sold you to the highest bidder  the same as I.   And you did not fight for your right to choose  whom you would wed  but for whatever bartered price  that was the legal tender  you were sold to a stranger's bed  in a stranger land  remember?  And you did not fight.  Mind you, I speak not mockingly  but I fought for freedom,  I'm fighting now for our unity.  We are women all,  and what wrongs you murders me  and eventually marks your grave  so we share a mutual death at the hand of tyranny.   They trapped me with the chain and gun.  They trapped you with lying tongue.  For, 'less you see that fault -  that male villainy  that robbed you of name, voice and authority,  that murderous greed that wasted you and me,  he, the white supremacist, fixed your minds with poisonous thought:  "white skin is supreme."  and therewith bought that monstrous change  exiling you to things.  Changed all that nature had ill you wrought of gentle usefulness,  abolishing your spring.  Tore out your heart,  set your good apart from all that you could say,  think,  feel,  know to be right.  And you did not fight,  but set your minds fast on my slavery  the better to endure your own.   'Tis true  my pearls were beads of sweat  wrung from weary bodies' pain,  instead of rings upon my hands  I wore swollen, bursting veins.  My ornaments were the wip-lash's scar  my diamond, perhaps, a tear.  Instead of paint and power on my face  I wore a solid mask of fear to see my blood so spilled.  And you, women seeing  spoke no protest  but cuddled down in your pink slavery  and thought somehow my wasted blood  confirmed your superiority.   Because your necklace was of gold  you did not notice that it throttled speech.  Because diamond rings bedecked your hands  you did not regret their dictated idleness.  Nor could you see that the platinum bracelets  which graced your wrists were chains  binding you fast to economic slavery.  And though you claimed your husband's name  still could not command his fidelity.   You bore him sons.  I bore him sons.  No, not willingly.  He purchased you.  He raped me,  I fought!  But you fought neither for yourselves nor me.  Set trapped in your superiority  and spoke no reproach.  Consoled your outrage with an added diamond brooch.  Oh, God, how great is a woman's fear  who for a stone, a cold, cold stone  would not defend honor, love or dignity!   You bore the damning mockery of your marriage  and heaped your hate on me,  a woman too,  a slave more so.  And when your husband disowned his seed  that was my son  and sold him apart from me  you felt avenged.  Understand:  I was not your enemy in this,  I was not the source of your distress.  I was your friend, I fought.  But you would not help me fight  thinking you helped only me.  Your deceived eyes seeing only my slavery  aided your own decay.  Yes, they condemned me to death  and they condemned you to decay.  Your heart whisked away,  consumed in hate,  used up in idleness  playing yet the lady's part  estranged to vanity.  It is justice to you to say your fear equaled your tyranny.   You were afraid to nurse your young  lest fallen breast offend your master's sight  and he should flee to firmer loveliness.  And so you passed them, your children, on to me.  Flesh that was your flesh and blood that was your blood  drank the sustenance of life from me.  And as I gave suckle I knew I nursed my own child's enemy.  I could have lied,  told you your child was fed till it was dead of hunger.  But I could not find the heart to kill orphaned innocence.  For as it fed, it smiled and burped and gurgled with conent  and as for color knew no difference.  Yes, in that first while  I kept your sons and daughters alive.   But when they grew strong in blood and bone  that was of my milk  you  taught them to hate me.  Put your decay in their hearts and upon their lips  so that strength that was of myself  turned and spat upon me,  despoiled my daughters, and killed my sons.  You know I speak true.  Though this is not true for all of you.   When I bestirred myself for freedom  and brave Harriet led the way  some of you found heart and played a part  in aiding my escape.  And when I made my big push for freedom  your sons fought at my sons' side,  Your husbands and brothers too fell in that battle  when Crispus Attucks died.  It's unfortunate that you acted not in the way of justice  but to preserve the Union  and for dear sweet pity's sake;  Else how came it to be with me as it is today?  You abhorred slavery  yet loathed equality.   I would that the poor among you could have seen  through the scheme  and joined hands with me.  Then, we being the majority, could long ago have rescued  our wasted lives.  But no.  The rich, becoming richer, could be content  while yet the poor had only the pretense of superiority  and sought the murderous brutality  to convince themselves that what was false was true.   So with KKK and fiery cross  and bloodied appetites  set about to prove that "white is right"  forgetting their poverty.  Thus the white supremacist used your skins  to perpetuate slavery.  And woe to me.  Woe to Willie McGee.  Woe to the seven of Martinsville.  And woe to you.  It was no mistake that your naked body on an Esquire calendar  announced the date, May Eighth.  This is your fate if you do not wake to fight.  They will use your naked bodies to sell their wares  though it be hate, Coca Cola or rape.   When a white mother disdained to teach her children  this doctrine of hate,  but taught them instead of peace  and respect for all men's dignity  the courts of law did legislate  that they be taken from her  and sent to another state.  To make a Troy Hawkins of the little girl  and a killer of the little boy!  &nbsp; No it was not for the womanhood of his mother  that Willie McGee died  but for a depraved, enslaved, adulterous woman  whose lustful demands denied,  lied and killed what she could not possess.  Only three months before another such woman lied  and seven black men shuddered and gave up their lives.  These women were upheld in these bloody deeds  by the president of this nation,  thus putting the official seal of fate  of white womanhood within these United States.  This is what they plan for you.  This is the depravity they would reduce you to.  Death for me  and worse than death for you.   What will you do?  Will you fight with me?  White supremacy is your enemy and mine.  So be careful when you talk with me.  Remind me not of my slavery, I know it well  but rather tell me of your own.  Remember, you have never known me.  You've been busy seeing me  as white supremacist would have me be,  and I will be myself.  Free!  My aim is full equality.  I would usurp their plan!  Justice  peace  and plenty  for every man, woman and child  who walks the earth.  This is my fight!   If you will fight with me then take my hand  and the hand of Rosa Ingram, and Rosalee McGee,  and as we set about our plan  let our wholehearted fight be:  PEACE IN A WORLD WHERE THERE IS EQUALITY.

So now that they've got the West Bank Palestinians also locked up in gaza-style reservations, what will they do next? Send the Palestinians living within israel (20% of its population) to the reservations as well? They've got the popular support to do it.   Do these people have souls??

      Two translated articles from Al-Ayyam (thanks Nihaya) that tell of the brave and heroic fighters in Palestine.      NABLUS TUNNEL  THE TUNNEL AND THE SEVEN MARTYRS OF NABLUS  Al-Ayyam (online edition) by Ghazi Bani Auda -- [June 30] There was genius in the Jeitan complex in old Nablus. But this was not the genius and bravery of the army, which was in short supply, having been supplanted by the fear and horror felt by the soldiers when they found themselves confronted with the incredible daring of the owners of the place-the tunnel.  Contrary to the Israeli version, it was pure coincidence, and it was neither the army's genius and bravery nor its intelligence capabilities that led to the martyrdom of the seven resistance members in Nablus. The details of the operation and all the evidence confirm what El-Aksa Martyrs Brigades told Al-Ayyam.  There were ten resistance members in the tunnel. Seven were martyred and three survived under circumstances that seemed to have been taken straight out of a science fiction movie. This was confirmed by the details revealed by El-Aksa Martyrs Brigades spokesmen, who lost their top leader, Nayef Abu Sharkh and seven of his comrades in this operation -two from Al-Quds Brigades and the Izzadin Kassam militias. Bassem Abu Sirriye, who is known to his comrades and the people of Nablus as "Qadaffi," Amer Tabanja and Sadek Nabulsi, three resistance members who truly owe their lives and the fact that they survived their certain deaths to the cowardice of the soldiers and their fear of the ghost of the hunted after they-the hunted-were in range of their fire and within their reach.  Bassem's indescribable daring was his weapon and his rope of survival when he found himself faced with a barrage of bullets and grenades that did not protect the soldiers from the fear that resides in their hearts.   The Israeli politicians and military men spent the hours of the past few days celebrating the achievement of the Paratroopers Brigade in Nablus. They celebrated the brigade's bravery that led to the success in eliminating seven of the most prominent activists in the Palestinian resistance.   The martyrs fell in the Jeitan complex. The complex is a traditional, old residential complex comprised of several houses that are connected to each other with upper and lower sections, with a yard and an entrance for every house that leads to a main yard, and this leads to the main street in the old city.  The leaders of the Israeli army, government and media did not forget a single word of praise for the courage, daring and genius of the paratroopers and their officers, who were honored personally by Sharon for their achievement in Nablus. But everyone ignored and neglected the question that deals with the details and circumstances of the survival of the three resistance members who were with Abu Sharkh inside the tunnel and how they escaped from the clutches of the paratroopers.  The hideout where the resistance members were martyred is an underground small room (some 16 square meters). The roof of the room is a small yard in front of a house where a couple live in the Jeitan complex. This yard is closed off on all four sides by walls some four meters high,. The tunnel had just one entrance, but it was camouflaged in a way that made it almost impossible for it to be discovered. Fadi Fishi, a member of El-Aksa Martyrs Brigades, said that part of the yard was used for breeding pigeons.  Fadi, who previously sought refuge in that hideout, said, "It was impossible for the soldiers to discover it and that's what the occupation army admitted when it said after the martyrdom of the seven young men that had they stayed in it for a hundred years, no one would have found them."  Abu Sharkh's comrades explained the circumstances surrounding the discovery of the entrance of the hideout. They said that martyr Nayef suffered from respiratory problems after having spent three consecutive days in the hideout, which had no opening for ventilation. He asked to leave for some time but neglected to have the area checked out by martyr Nidal Al-Wawi, who normally was responsible for that task.  Bassem Abu Sirriye said, "No one knew that the army was patrolling the perimeter of the area. Nidal and Abu Sharkh left and shut us in and went to the room in the house after Nidal asked about the whereabouts of the army."  After some silence he added, "when they came back and after Nayef was in the hideout, a soldier peeked from over the wall that leads to the nearby garden. He saw Nidal and shot at him."  The martyr, Abu Sharkh, tried to pull in Nidal Al-Wawi, who was about to enter the hideout, but the shooting continued and the soldiers shot him in the arm and immediately proceeded to fire tear gas and missiles into the hideout through the opening that was exposed to them.  The resistance members knew that there was no other exit in the hideout except for the one where the missiles and tear gas were coming from. Inside the hideout there was a narrow crawlway that led to a brick wall. "Qaddafi" explained, "the hideout didn't have another exit, but we knew that there was a brick wall at the end of the small tunnel that was about 5 meters long. When the soldiers showered us with missiles and tear gas I started, with my comrades, to crawl inside the tunnel that was closed off by bricks. When I reached the wall, we were on the verge of fainting from the tear gas. I vomited repeatedly, but I got to the brick wall, which we previously had widened. I took a big rock with both hands and banged on the wall until part of it collapsed." After he made  approximately an 80-centimeter hole in the wall, Bassem found himself looking into a small kitchen where a group of soldiers were standing at about a meter and a half from him.  He said, "when the wall collapsed I saw part of a kitchen curtain and a group of soldiers standing in front of me. Martyr Omar Mismar was next to me and Sadek Nabulsi, who survived and was arrested after he was injured, was behind me. The soldiers backed up and shot tear gas at me."  Bassem continued to relate the details of his survival, saying: "After they shot tear gas at me, I jumped toward them. They moved away in fear that I might blow myself up near them. They withdrew and left the house."  After Bassem jumped, Sadek followed him; while Bassem went into one of the rooms, Sadek left through the main door toward the soldiers who withdrew and took up positions in a small closed yard in front of the house that was surrounded from all sides.  The wall surrounding the yard is about 15 meters high and completely surrounds the yard that has only one narrow passage whence the soldiers withdrew upon leaving the kitchen.  The angel of death did not yet leave Bassem; it even got closer, so he jumped again from the window of the house toward a corner that is part of the yard where the soldiers were standing by its side.  From his new spot, Bassem saw the window of the nearby house, which was about 3 meters high. There were two clotheslines attached to the wall right below the window and they became his ropes of safety. The day before yesterday Bassem reenacted for us how he jumped and crossed 4 meters, which is the width of the yard that separated him from the window. Then he grabbed the lower clothesline and from it moved to the higher rope and then with his fist he shattered the closed window, threw himself into the house from where he was able to leave from the opposite direction.  While Bassem survived, the soldiers shot Nabulsi when he ran toward them. They injured him and would have killed him, had it not been for a group of women who threw themselves on top of him to prevent his death.  The details of Amer Tabanja's survival are no less amazing than Bassem's. During the invasion Bassem tried to dig another tunnel inside the hideout, but after digging for two meters he realized that it was going to lead to a nearby garden and that made him stop his work. He said, "Tabanja went into the tunnel after they shot tear gas and missiles into the hideout. He put his body inside the tunnel and his legs were stuck outside." Tabanja was rescued-he was injured in the legs-after the army left the spot.   According to the version of those who experienced these events, the paratroopers whose courage was the subject of praise and who stayed in the area for two hours after the first martyr, Nidal Al-Wawi fell, did not dare to enter the hideout even to check if everyone who was in it had been martyred.  Bassem Abu Sirriye, who was injured 7 times in armed clashes with the army in the Intifada, said this was not the first time he had found himself in a tight noose but had managed to survive. He said that the hardest time was when the army besieged a building from whose roof he and martyr Fadi Abu Zant were shooting. He said, "Suddenly, we realized that all the surrounding buildings were besieged and there was no escape for us. So we got into a water tank on the roof when it was winter and it was raining."  He added, "We got in together and stayed in the tank that was filled with water until the dawn prayer. The soldiers got on to the roof, walked around us and we survived."  Despite the agreement that the departure of those martyrs was a loss, their comrades said that El-Aksa Martyrs Brigades would come to an end with their departure.  Fadi Fishi, who has been injured three times and in one incident lost three fingers on his right hand, said, "Our loss is great, but we will continue in our path with no hesitation."  Fadi, who is a father of a four-year-old girl, pointed to the continuity of the resistance despite the assassination of its leaders and members. He said, "There are dozens of hunted men in Nablus, but beside them and behind them there are tens of thousands of people who do even more than what the hunted men do."      EIGHT BOYS IN A SINGLE EVENING  Al-Ayyam (p. 18) by Ghassan Zaqtan (op-ed) -- [June 28] It was harsh, perplexing and disturbing. Eight fighters in one battle! Eight leaders in less than a hundred square meters! Eight boys in a single evening! Eight martyrs!  It won't be easy to fill the profound void their absence has created. It will be hard for Nablus to forget the night of June 26. But it is the sense of loss the prompts the naive and difficult question to the surface again. How can this happen?!  How did it happen that they were all together in that narrow and dark space in the Jeitan complex in the casbah in Nablus? It is impossible to hide the sense of bitterness when one is forced to ask again the simple, common and painful question that pursues our "hunted" boys like a bloody hunting party.  The boys that run exposed in the valleys, hills and neighborhoods of the country without protection.  The issue is simple: the neglect of personal security, which is one's helmet and shield, especially in our case, where there is no central body that provides protection.  All of the practices that guarantee avoiding the ambushes, Apaches, snipers and traitors need to be improved. At the same time, a serious and calculated campaign against the network of collaborators must be launched by the Palestinian Authority's security and judicial institutions, in keeping with a comprehensive national vision. Topping the political agenda should be a demand that insists that the policy of assassinating the resistance members be stopped. The cause of those freedom fighters must be organized in a way that honors their justified role and position.  The policy of dividing the Intifada, of handling the national arena in a piecemeal manner, of dividing and categorizing the Palestinian people into As, Bs and Cs, such as "hunted" and "wanted," or dividing prisoners into two groups-those "with blood on their hands" and those "with no blood on their hands"-is a policy that leads to the isolation of specific individuals and areas by Israel, which, with its army, settlers and politicians, has become entrenched in our blood.  The strength of the resistance can only be guaranteed by keeping the resistance fighters alive and free. The PA's role should go beyond providing salaries and job opportunities, and ought to extend to protecting our people by all means, if it is unable to do so with arms. The PA can start by cleansing the collaborators' network, by providing a  decent life for the families of the martyrs and resistance members in hiding, and by making the resumption of the political process contingent upon assurance of their safety.

      64% of jews in the zionist entity was palestinians out. Sickening, isn't it?   even worse: one-quarter would vote for Kach? (Baruch Goldstein, the butcher of the Ibrahimi mosque, was a Kach supporter!)  Can you imagine if 64% of white americans wanted blacks shipped back to africa, if one-quarter of them would vote for the KKK, and if half of them complained about mexicans stealing all the jobs? hmm, sounds familiar doesn't it? i don't think white america is *that* far off, after all, weren't they complicit in the expulsion of the natives of this land onto reservations? and aren't they currently complicit with the unfair imprisonment of blacks today? For example, African Americans represent 12.7% of the US population, 15% of US drug users (72% of all users are white), 36.8% of those arrested for a drug-related crime, 48.2% of American adults in state, and federal prisons and local jails and 42.5% of prisoners under sentence of death.  what's happening to the palestinians is essentially what has happened to native americans here - portrayed as terrorist savages, expelled from their lands, rounded up into reservations, and eventually...you know the story.  you can read the article by clicking on the title.

(The title is a link w/ trailers, if you haven't)  I saw it, and I must say that it was an excellent movie for reaching out to white middle and working class america. obviously for us, who already have a sense of what's going on, it was kind of preaching to the choir, but i don't think that was his intention anyway. so congrats to michael moore for successfully trashing bush and co.  because this movie was so successful, many leftists/radicals have been reluctant to criticize it. but i am going to point out some things that really bothered me:  1) the pro-democrat undertones were disturbing - for palestinians especially the prospect of having kerry in office is pretty horrifying. he has been going around professing his love for the zionist entity at every opportunity. but then, i've heard michael moore is not anti-zionist. hard for me to swallow that for anyone.  2) some scenes really made me squirm - for example, while demonizing the saudi family, why throw in the scene of thousands of muslims praying at mecca? and when going through the countries in the "Coalition of the Willing", why the racist stereotypical images of moroccans (and others in the coalition)? ESPECIALLY after what happened to arabs and muslims after 9/11 (which he made no mention of)?  3) and one of my dear friends, who wears hijab, was really bothered by the stupid white feminist who was complaining about the burqa that women are forced to wear in afghanistan...don't you think that glorifying plastic surgery (aka "The Swan" and "Nip & Tuck") is a little more oppressive to women then a burqa?? are those stupid white feminists (sounds like a good book title, eh?) in denial about what is happening to women here or are they just fantasizing the idea of being the saviors for us ignorant moslem women?  so if michael moore's intention was to smear bush, he did a really great job. but if he had any intention of dispelling stereotypes about "brown-skinned people" (as bush calls us) as backwards terrorists, he failed miserably.

      How many of you have heard that line? I have, too many times.  "If you don't like it here, why don't you go back where you came from"  How dare we, as an "IMMIGRANTS", question them? We are told to know our place,  since we are enjoying the fruits of this society - so we must enjoy it and obey! (as an FBI agent told me once)  Every time somebody says it to me, I turn that shit around.  They are not the rightful owners of this land. Stop claiming something stolen from beautiful nations with rich cultures destroyed and many lives lost.  If their twisted government(s) would quit raping the rest of our countries, I'd GLADLY go back where I came from.  But they better go back where they came from (Europe, the depths of hell, whatever) and quit raping this country.  In a society that prides itself as a "melting pot" with a democracy and free speech, questioning the system suddenly means get the hell out (or IN - in our jails!)? This aint no melting pot, it's just a tossed salad.  Maybe I should just keep it simple and tell their racist ass to shut the f*** up.
