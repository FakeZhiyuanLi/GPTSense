      aw man! for a while there i thought i was actually going to have a relationship  for real . after all those pseudo-relationships, i was beginning to warm up to the idea of stabilizing my commitment potential. well, it ended as swiftly as it began. i don't blame him... i was being such a pest. but, hey, you can't blame me either. i was still in that experimental stage. i am entitled to make mistakes, goddammit. otherwise i'd be a prodigy at this and that's not  normal .  but that doesn't take away the fact that i'm deadly sad.  qui ver???

      1. text brigade everyone in your phonebook about the job opening. cordially answer all "WHAT?! YOU'RE QUITTING?" replies. either they haven't heard of such a thing as a promotion or they don't think you deserve one, so be patient.  2. save your boss's name and address appended with c/o (your name) in your cell phone. DO NOT DELETE UNTIL DEADLINE OF SUBMISSION OF APPLICATION. a torrent of unidentified numbers will enter your life to collect these vital info, so spare yourself from typing them over and over and over again. plus, cheerfully acknowledge those who actually make the effort of  calling ; they save you P1 worth of text.  3. LOOK BUSY. and always be in your corporate best (including makeup). you never know when these interested applicants would drop by to submit their resumes. they must see you in your element. they must be led to the impression that they are trying to replace an  irreplaceable . (but you're not...)  4. do not be intimidated by highly qualified applicants. i mean, if they're so good and earning so much in their current job, why are they leaving it, aber?! they'll probably drivel on about finding meaning and wanting to try new things and all that crap. if they want to be relevant, suggest that they join the salvation army. there's no aesthetic in the corporate setting, only crabs.  5. if a girlfriend/boyfriend calls/submits in behalf of the applicant, and it is the girlfriend/boyfriend who does most of the inquiring and following-up, put his/her application form at the bottom of the pile. this kinda shit happens.  6. when you call for interview and lecture rehearsal schedule, be a good cop. you wouldn't want to scare away those with potential at this point. but don't be a weenie. if you could be a voice prompt as thorough as supercat's booking computer, you'd rather be that, trust me.  7. if applicant is a friend, as much as possible let someone else do the calling; lest you want to be answered with a " ha?! naa pa gyud diay lecture rehearsal? hala uy ...." helloooo, this is a training officer position. dammit.
