      Freedom is just around the corner. Freedom from Devin and Gabriella's athletic and academic schedules that is. Now if they just weren't so social like their dad. Let me tell you this, if any of your children ask you if they could join track SAY ANYTHING to dissuade them!! Devin and Gabriella have participated in soccer, basketball, gymnastics, swimming and volleyball to name the majors but never track, UNTIL this year! Yeesh!  I have never spent so much time at an event as I have with track. A minimum of 3 hours to watch Devin run the 55m hurdle (best time : 10.7s) and 400m relay (55:78s) with the varsity team which is all 8th graders (I am mom! Hear me brag!).  Anyhoo, my evenings are now somewhat free pending on the degree of whining, bartering and sucking up from our rugrats Richard and I can withstand.

      Richard is thirtysomething and is employed by Gentex Corp. He is prior USAF (Hoo-rah!!). He played weatherman for them and the Milwaukee ANG. He is going back into the Guard because he loves his country (which explains his relationship with Toby Keith).  His second love is the Arkansas Razorbacks. Which explains why when he calls the pigs...Devin comes running :(   Devin is 12 and currently testing her boundaries (I think it would be more effective if we installed an electric fence!). She loves music (Richard corrupts her with 80's hair band music!), sports (when asked if she would like to be a cheerleader she responded "I want to BE cheered") and the color purple. She is not into hair (ponytails or just down) or makeup and is most comfortable in athletic gear. She woud rather go fishing (watch out! cuz she will steal your spot if you're catching) then shopping :(   Gabby is 10 and wishes she were born a beauitiful princess! She loves ladybugs, dinosaurs, Brats, Polly Pockets, sweets and the color pink! I think she could be an actress...my little drama queen! God may not have given her height but He didn't tell her that! She will go head to toe with you whether your 2 ft tall or 10!  She has an inquisitive nature and there are no awkward silences around (if ya know what I mean!).  And lastly, me. I would tell you about me but I don't want to shock, scare, or annoy anyone. You'll just have to come back and read what I write and then judge for yourself.

      This weekend we are taking off for a little break. Accompanying us will be my parents and my brother and his family.  Saturday, we are visiting Lincoln Park Zoo where the animals will run amok, amok, amok.  And maybe, their animals will too. Sunday, we head toward the Dells. Chula Vista Resort to be exact. This resort hosts 150K sq ft of waterpark where hopefully, Devin and Gabriella will wear themselves out and live to remember the great sacrifices I make. Richard wants to visit the fish farm and I know the girls will want to go with him. YEA! Spa Del Sol for me :)  They can do without me...let them bait their own hooks! Richard just mentioned someone has to take the pictures! See...there is crack in Arkansas! You think by now he would realize I am NOT that kind of wife. But I digress, the cool think about this resort is that they host a Fab 50's show and I know my parents will dig that. So something for everyone. There's even a bar! Woopee!  Will give more details upon my return.

      and the kids are home. I still remember that feeling of the last day of school, unfortunately now it's the "dark side". Let me explain.  Kids stay up past their 9pm curfew watching movies, dancing to music (which currently travels from the basement thru the living room and declares itself in my bedroom while I try to sleep). Aargh! I must maintain discipline in my household. I struggle for this on a daily basis. It's a fight against "Mom can I have some ice cream?" or "Mom can I get wet?" Sure I tell them, get jacked up on sugar and track that mud and grass in my house! What are they sniffing while I'm at work??? Kids...can't live with 'em and can't kick them out until they're 18.
