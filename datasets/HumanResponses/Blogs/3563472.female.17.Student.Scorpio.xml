      I just got back from Iowa American Legion Auxilery Girls' State. For those of you who don't know what that is.. it's a program that sends 350 of the Top girls in the state to Aimes and they spend six days learning about government and parlimentary procedure, campaigning for various positions, and getting to know the strangers that they are surrounded in.   It was the best experience i've ever had. Everyone there was so accepting and fun. I went in being upset and homesick and left crying because i didn't want to leave. The bonds that are made between friends are endless. you get to know ppl in a way that know one can understand. I miss them all ready (Cassie, Stephanie, Mary, Sarah, and everyone else). I hope we stay in touch more than anything else. They've taught me so much about myself. I can't thank them enough for that.

      I spent the past two evenings in Iowa City. Thursday night was very enjoyable. Donald and I drew random portraits of people for free and I met and billion and one cool people. We met Donald's future roommate and I believe that he will be great for Donald. Reminds me a lot of Mere's brother in some ways. Anyways, he played Francis Flute/Thisby in A Midsummer Night's Dream. So, he's fine by me. AND he likes pirates.  Last night was less enjoyable for me. I only met a few new people. People looked at me in a strange way all night and it freaked me out. I guess if you're planning on going to Iowa City, you should plan on being hit on by a bunch of drunk college boys, but I was deathly afraid when walking to my car alone to put my guitar away. My whole body was in defense mode, my car key between my middle and index finger, just in case.  Also, Alex, JC, and Tim came up and were playing music on a street corner with some girlfriend of a guy named Mustaffa. For some reason, I became very depressed in seeing them, even physically sick. I guess I've just been really worried about Tim recently and I'm confused at what to do. I miss Tim. Tim, as in the Tim I used to know. But, you'll have that. And what can you do?  I'm very sad today. I don't know why, but something feels wrong, I feel different. No, it's not PMS either. Just my stupid mind overthinking things again. YUCK

      Sometimes I just wake up so happy, it's incredible. This morning, I set my alarm for 7am so I could go run before work. I woke up 15 minutes before my alarm. I lied there for 45 minute, feeling the warmth of the sun from the windows on my exposed legs and the breeze of my fan caress my face, listening to the birds sing me the song of morning and watching the white curtains of my windows dance in the wind. OH! I love the mornings sometimes.

      I'm in such a good mood. It's about ready to rain, I started an amazing book today, I'm listening to good music, I'm talking to swell people, and I'm about to hang out with Danny, Meredith and Jacko! YAY  Anyways. I love storms.. well rain basically. I love rain, but especially warm rain. Oh man, it's one of the most beautiful, relaxing, wonderous things. I love rain! Me=freak. I want someone to ask me to marry them in the rain. Dammit, i'm hormonal again! Hah  About the book, it is called   Sophies World  , I think. Anyways, It's a great philosophical book, so far. I like it emensely.  Oh man, I was thinking, isn't it weird that you meet everyone out of pure coincidence? Basically, it's weird the world is the way it is.   Did you know it supposedly took the first "human" species over 1,000 years to develop their first utencil?  Through evolution, the human brain has developed a lot, obviously. Did you know that apes have tools to gather food and such? So maybe someday, they'll be like us... and just think what we humanoids will be like then, we'll probably be dead, but who knows.  I wish I could take away the intelligence of the modern age away from myself. Take away the modern schooling, the explainations about the world, just everything. I want to know how I would view the world, with a child's innocence and endless wonder and curiosity.

      I watched   A Walk to Remember   today. I don't know why I've seen it so many times, but it makes me cry every time. I guess I have a secret love for cheesy love films.   I decided that the reason I like these movies are because I am so fucking stupid/desperate/lonely/i suck. Haha.. no not really.. well probably.. but I guess I don't really think about it THAT much, although it would be nice to have... oh nevermind. I do suck.   haha on a brighter note  "Would you like to put a bullet in your head so I can fuck you real good?"  ~pick-up line for a necropheliac~

      I'm so bored... this summer started out with constant fun. Now, I'm just bored. It's not like I sit and do nothing all the time, it's just that everything I do is boring. So I need something exciting to do.  I DID dye my hair yesturday. You see, it was a reddish color, and it was growing out. So, I thought, "My hair looks like poop; I should dye it".   So, I did. It went from a light reddish color, to a dark brown color. It excites me greatly!  Enough. I want fun... Pity me!!!!

      Life would be so much easier if loving yourself was as gratifying as loving someone else.   I like me. You know? I like who I am just fine. Of course, there are things i wouldn't mind changeing, but I'm content.   Sometimes, I just wish that life wasn't so love oriented. With every new guy I meet, I think "maybe?". With every relationship I see, I say "aww they're so great".  How is it that someone like myself cannot find one person who would ever be with me? I mean, sure I've had a few relationships, but only because I believe in giving everyone a chance. My first kiss was one from some stranger who tried to get me to have sex with him. Someone I didn't know at all. Something I didn't want.   My second kiss was from a good friend who was horny. Nothing that really mattered to the opposite person, but it's all I have.  I don't know why this should bother me either. I mean, most of my time is well spent. It's not like I'm desperate or anything. Hell, I've been lonely my whole life.. woopy shit if it's another day, week, month, year. I should be able to have enough love in myself for myself that I can satisfied with life.   Don't get me wrong though. It's not that I'm depressed or unhappy all the time.   It's just that I'm lonely.   Not "staying at home all night because you have no one to talk to" lonely. Not "going to a public place just so i can see people" lonely. The lonely I feel is constant, whether I'm with someone or not. It's a hole in my being. It's a weight on my soul. It's a desire to feel something more than the everyday highs and lows. It's the need for spontaneity. It's the feeling you get when you take an online quiz and find out you have an extremely compatable personality and realize that still no one wants you.  I dont' know what to blame this horror on. Myself, indefinately. But what is it about myself? My fear of rejection that stops me from saying what I feel? Or is it my sick sense of humor? Maybe my intellect scares ppl away. Or maybe I'm just to bold. However, I think it all boils down to my extended stomache and my ugly face.   I don't know why I decided to post this. I mean, it's awfully depressing, and it makes me sound extremely fucked up. I'm really a rather happy person.      I just need someone.    At least, for tonight.

      I need something to do, someone to talk to, and to lose 10 more pounds. Other than that, I think that.. I am great!  By the way, Relay for Life was amazing, I met a lot of cool ppl and I was able to hang out with ppl i dont' see very often.   Shubblenuffler

      Today I took the ACT's. Wahoo.. I had a total of 4 hours of sleep last night because my body is fucked up, and it wasn't quality sleep either. So before the ACT's I had 2 cans of pop and a Sugar Daddy Latte. By testing time, my hands were shaking from the caffine!   Anyways, the first 2 tests (english, math) were extremely easy. I finished them really early and had time enough to go back and check every single answer. This was helpful because I had a few many on the math that were dumb errors and I corrected them.  I don't know what it was, but after the break, I couldn't do anything. The reading test was really strenuous for some reason. It was like I could see the words, but they had no meaning because I didn't give a shit about it. I got through it all right. And then they gave me science .. which is basically reading charts. So, I did that for awhile. It sucked, but i'll live  After ACT's I went to PRIDE FEST!! I actually had a blast despite the fucking heat (which makes me really sick because i have an unusually low body temp). i saw a lot of ppl i met at the Matthew Shepard counterprotest I went to a while back. YAY. And I Saw JUEVOS (aka. BOBBY) and it was rather swell. YAY FOR BOBBY!!.. anyways.. I'm going to go to relay now.. stay up all night... and then work tomorrow at 9

      I went to Iowa City with my mom today. I got the only JD Salinger book I haven't read,  Raise High the Roof Beam, Carpenters . (I didn't know it existed). I've never been quite so excited to buy a book. So yay for that!  Relay for Life is tomorrow! I'm rather excited about it!! WAHOO.. The only thing that sucks is that I have to work the next morning. Oh well, I'll get over it.   Lordy I'm bored.  God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater  I'm the Queen of cheese and everything good in this world.

      It's weird. I have these stupid tests that cost hella money and I have no desire to do well. I wouldn't be surprised if I fell asleep while taking them. I guess i'm an ass like that. I think being stressed out would be a lot better than not giving a shit because then i might study and such.. but I guess I don't care.. so that ends that whole deal. I hate standardized tests and i'm going to find out I'm an idiot. That's all that matters. Wish me a 20 at least ;)

      Okay.. not really, but I think having an honest,logical man with a humanitarian eye might be nice for our country. I've been reading Columns from the NY Times for a little while now. I think it is a good idea to do so, it helps you see the world from different eyes.   I have grown particularly fond of the liberal mind of Nicholas Kristof.   Since the Iraq conflict, most of the other columnists have been focusing on the state of Iraq, prison scandals, Bush-Cheney Administration, and now they're moving on to the upcoming election.   Kristof has clearly said what he thinks about the previous topics, but he doesn't dwell on them, however upset they may make him. He travels the world and touches base with many good and bad things he sees.   Cambodia- many girls as young as the age of 9 selling their bodies because their families are too poor to live otherwise.  China- their economy is booming. The government is making a switch from communism to socialism with several branches controlling different areas of china. More freedoms for people to speak out.  Sudan/Chad- Sudan government is performing genocide on native tribes. Refugees run to Chad where food is scarce.  Africa, in general- Africa is in breaking down. There is an obvious AID's problem. More have died here in civil wars since WWII than in all the rest of the world combined. When Imperialistic countries left, no one really helped Africa get back on their feet. Civil wars began to break out between Arabic Muslims and African Muslims. Now, young boys fight for who knows what reason. No one wants to go aid Africa because they don't offer a lot back for help. So, basically any aiding country would be throwing their money down the drain.   Iran- America is viewed as wonderful by the people, not the government.  Mr. Kristof offers his opinions about what we should do or not do for each of the previous scenarios. I'd rather not go into that.  So, there are more issues in the world than Iraq. I don't necessarily agree with everything Mr. Kristof says, but I credit him on being original, honest, pretty fair-minded (at least on the previous issues), and most of the points he makes are pretty good points. If he ran for president, he'd get my vote!

      I guess I don't know who I'm talking to when I'm blogging. Especially since I haven't told anyone what my blog is yet. I probably will eventually, but for now, I like it being just an irrelevant blog.   Anyways.. To whomever   Have you ever seen something--something very small-- that captivated you? Something that, in fact, made you question your existence or made it more worthwhile? Something that forced a little more life into your nearly drain heart?  Not too long ago--an hour maybe---I was driving home from Mary Beth's. I had just dropped Jacko off, and I was turning off S. Iowa onto the four lanes when I noticed a biker in the lane I was in. So, like any other driver would do, I switched lanes and passed the biker. I caught a glimpse of the person on bike, and it was a man... I'm guessing he was 76 years old. His bike was packed with many bags, and it was nearing midnight. He rode with much determination.  You are probably wondering how this had any influence on my thoughts, life, etc. So, I will describe for you my thoughts.  At my ripe age, sometimes I feel my life is leveling off. It has always been my fear that in everyone's life they reach a point where growth stops and people just settle in. I guess I'm a free spirited type of girl, and I never want to reach a point  where life is a routine.   So...I guess this man is what I want to be when I'm old. I want to have determination to see/do new things. I want to be able to pack my bags on a bike and ride to wherever I want. I want to keep my free spirited soul and never live a life of routine.    I guess it's strange I can learn so much from a brief experience with a stranger. I hope someday someone will look at me through the same eyes I saw through today.

      Kurt Vonnegut has a quote that goes something like this  "Every person, living and dead, is purely coincidental"  If that be true, than is the world not a little more chaotic than we ever knew. Yet, we have social classes, organized government, elected leaders, and standards. So... like organized chaos. Maybe I'm interpretting the quote differently than he meant it. What are your thoughts?   Also, have you ever looked  a slab of meat and thought it was rather disgusting? because that's what i generally think when i look at it. Not that i'm a animal right's activist or that i'm imagining a dead animal on my plate, but the first time i looked at raw meat... it really ruined eating for me... at least for awhile

      Sometimes, life grabs you by the ankles and pulls, and dammit if you're able to break the fall or not.   Ehh, I've been generally happy for the past year, but i don't know. Sometimes i forget to smile and laugh. Sometimes I forget to cry. I feel like my highs are not so high, and my lows are not so low. I guess i'm slipping away from reality. I don't know if i feel anything anymore.

      I'm not sure what to talk about. So i'm just going to give you some of my recent thoughts.  The funny thing about irony in books and movies is that the writer specifically sets a situation up to be ironic. Which kind of makes the situation not Ironic. Now an it is ironic that premeditated irony isn't really ironic at all.  I read a column by David brooks. It really touched base with a lot of things that are going to affect the upcoming elections and other things in the future of our country/gov. It basically talked about how people choose parties and then form their ideas afterwards and once people find a party they don't switch. The American People no longer evaluate both candidates and see who they think is best for our country's future. Voters almost always vote within their party. If you want to read about this topic,  urlLink click here.   I'll talk more later.. my brother wants to use our computer or internet rather.

      I keep feeling the need for love and compassion and all that sappy shit. It makes me wonder if the search for a soul mate is something everyone does/wants (so the&nbsp;longing for&nbsp;a true lover is innate)&nbsp;or is that just because our society expects that. I'm&nbsp;thinking it's the latter because there are a lot of societies that don't marry for love. However, wanting a true love and trying to pursue a relationship are two very different things. If it's not expected in the society, people longing for true love are not likely to pursue it. I feel like I'm running in circles. I don't know. I'm bored.. I hate love songs.

      Last night was great. I went to the Terminal with Kipp, Emily, Ashley, and Stevo. It was a very amuzing movie. It made me laugh tremendously. After the movie we went to Ben's. There was a small party going on there already with a RootBeer Keg. Kipp and Drew had a root beer drinking contest. Kipp won, of course. He had 10 1/2 cups of rootbeer and Drew had 9 (actually he cheated so he probably only had about 6 cups). Anyways.. Kipp puked twice. The first time he puked, Drew gave him a dollar to eat a piece of puke. It was rather disturbing, but still amusing. The second time he puked, it was like a fire hydrant. I've never seen so much puke in my life. And I've never enjoyed watching someone puke so much either.&nbsp; Drew puked once, but it was pathetic. He had to gag himself.. and it wasn't even enough to make him feel better. haha DREW SUCKS!! No, I love Drew.&nbsp; Anyways, it was decided that Root beer drinking is definately a spectator sport.

      Yesturday was strange. Caleb from Iowa City was dropped off at my house. Neither of us knew what was going on or what to do. So we walked around washington all day. It wasn't very exciting, but the whole situation was bizarre.  I really like Martin Sexton. He makes me hot and his falsetto is super sexy! Great guy he is.  Moving on, there is person named Mike that told me he knew Caleb. Caleb knew nothing of Mike. Mike is a philosopher, and he's probably my soul mate. A lot of people are my soul mates.I found this whole scenario kind of strange. Maybe I imagined this Mike character up because I wanted to meet a philosopher that day. I did meet him July 3rd at Jazz Festival. I like this.  James and Donald threw a party for James' dog's birthday. Strange? I found it very amusing either way. Donald brought his dog and cat to the party. I wanted to go but i don't know how my animals would react with other animals. I should've taken a cow.  "You know I don't like the way I am. You know I don't like the way I am. Oh no." -- Martin Sexton  "Cowboys are pretty cool. Pirates are pretty cool. If a cowboy and a pirate got together, their offspring would be super cool"--Caleb

      I'm so bored. I worked today from 8 am. til 1:10 pm. It sucks. Hey! has it ever bothered you that noon is 12 pm and not 12 am? well, if it doesn't, then it should.  So, I've been pretty bored since 1:10. I was going to watch Confessions of a Dangerous Mind again, but I didn't.  My current screenname for MSN messenger is "My Love For Steve Buscemi". I do love steve buscemi. he makes me laugh, and he's half of all the movies ever made. Okay, not quite. BUT he is in 80+ movies. That's freaking crazy!   Funk RULES! I am the FUNK GODDESS!!!!   I'm going to see the County Fair Queen Contest tonight. It should be rather amusing. However, Mrs. Loula just asked me if I wanted to go se Antigone at Brucemore. I really want to go, but i already made plans. Plus, I'm broke  Plato was one crazy guy. He probably needed to get laid.

Anyways, County Fair Queen Contest coming up! Oh boy.... I have quite a few friends in it... so i guess i'm obligated in some way to go. I think it will be mildly fun. And the fair should be exciting. I hope I see my Mid Prairie friends. How I love them. hahah.  I think I may go to Iowa City tonight. It will be exciting, and I need excitement. But i may have to kill a herky or two. Everytime mere sees one she says "I hate those f-ing herkies. If they had tires, I'd slash 'em" It makes me hot.  Confessions of a Dangerous Mind. Go rent it. I did last night. It was great.

      I am helpless. I don't know what I feel. I just keep pondering silly things. I guess that's what reading SOPIE'S WORLD does to you. I don't know though.   I mean, no one really knows about this blog except me. At least, not from washington. So, I can be completely open to all subjects.   Tonight, I thought of a new theory. It actually occurred to me previously, but i never thought in depth about it.  I believe that every man and woman is one of 2 types of people. A person seeking love. or A person seeking knowledge. Now, you can have both... and to a certain point, need both. But i think if you have supreme knowledge you can survive without love, and vice versa. But i guess i will never know, seeing how it may very well be impossible to reach either extreme. I guess it's just a wild theory  I'm tired

      Mysticism is a very interesting topic. There have been many people throughout the world who claim that they have become part of a higher being, leaving themselves behind. Can you imagine? A certain divinity that we all have inside of us.. the same divinity in everyone.  And leaving yourself to become part of it all. It's rather exciting actually!:D I mean.. those who have experienced are very diverse with religions that don't necessary link, and it's such an interesting concept. If we all have the same divine internal self (soul).. then we are all the same... in an eternal sense. Just thinking about it gets me excited.. because.. hate and love become pointless in a way. We spend our whole lives building relationships and associating ourselves with certain people, but if we're all the same in the end it seems sort of redundant. But if we all work for self improvement, maybe it'll improve everyone. I don't know if I buy into all of this, but I do find it extremely interesting.
