      I just read this column from MSN & i wanna share it with you guys! Have fun reading it!!!!     Playing hooky Dan, 40, has fond memories of a last-minute decision to leave work for most of the afternoon on a beautiful fall day when he was just starting to date his current girlfriend. "It was one of the last warm days before winter. We took off for an afternoon and evening of roaming the back roads in my Miata, and then had an unplanned dinner at a very romantic spot."    Fun e-mails  Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery. So is going along with the whims of your partner or date to feed their ego. Martha, 46, tells the story of her boyfriend's crush on a local female sportscaster. She supports his blatant fawning over the sportscaster's weekend telecasts and enjoys ribbing him about it. "One day out of the blue I got the bug to send him a joke e-mail from my alternate e-mail account and even included a photo image of his crush with a mash note. Of course he knew it was from me but he got a huge kick out of it."   Diane, 44, recalls after one particularly steamy night with her boyfriend, she spontaneously found herself composing a congratulatory e-mail to him the next morning. "I sent him accolades for being the sexiest man alive. I acted like he was a winner of a contest and that movie star hunks took second to him. He loved it."   A true romantic   Kevin, 50, has a number of spur-of-the-moment tricks up his sleeve. His personal favorite: "We rented a small boat on one of the city lakes. Had wine, cheese, music in the boat on a sunny afternoon." If he's so inclined, he also likes to spring for flowers for a date at dinner or after dinner, make an unexpected stop for a treat such as ice cream. Another chestnut he enjoys is to "plan a date where she doesn't know your plans. Surprise her, just be sure to tell her what to wear."   The mundane will do  Marco, 42, notes he sometimes pops the question. Not that question — but something like "wanna go to Home Depot?" If there's some item he needs to pick up, he often asks a potential interest if they would like to accompany him shopping. "I find women are typically open to shopping and like to give their opinions on things. Plus, it's simple, relaxed and can be made quick or if things are going well, extended longer." It's also a natural lead in to work in a lunch or dinner, he says.

      Life's full of challenges,through challenges life is presenting us with the opportunity to deal with someone or something which will demand that you stretch yourself beyond what is easy, what you know or what is comfortable for us. This is a real gift. A fabulous opportunity to show ourselves & others that there is more to us & that we can extend ourself in positive & contructive ways.

      Love is like waiting for a bus. When the bus comes, you look at it and you say to yourself "eeee...so full....cannot sit down, I'll wait for the next one."   So you let the bus go and waited for the second bus. Then the second bus came, you looked at it you said, "eeee...this bus is so old...so shabby!"   So you let the bus go and again, decided to wait for the next bus.   After a while another bus came, it's not crowded, not old but you said, "eeee...not air conditioned ... better wait for the next one."   So again you let the bus go and decided to wait for the next bus.   Then the sky started to get dark as it was getting late. You panicked and jumped immediately inside the next bus. It is not until much later that you found out that you had boarded the wrong bus!   And you wasted your time and money just to get into the wrong one!   Even if an air conditioned bus comes, you can't ensure that the air conditioned bus won't break down or whether or not the airconditioner will be too cold for you.   Wanting to get what you want is not wrong. But it wouldn't hurt to give other people a chance. If you find that the "bus" doesn't suit you just press the red button and get off the bus! Hey, who said life is fair???   The best thing to do is be observant and open-minded. If it doesn't suit you, get off.   I'm sure you've had this experience before. You saw a bus coming (the bus you want of course). You flagged it but the driver acted as if he did not see you and zoomed pass you! It just wasn't meant for you!   The bottom line is, being loved is like waiting for a bus you want. Getting on the bus and appreciating the bus by giving it a chance depends totally on you. If you haven't made any choice, WALK!   Walking is like being single. The good side of it is you can still choose any bus you want...the rest who couldn't afford another ride would just have to be content with the bus they rode on, ugly or not.   Also, sometimes it is better to choose a bus you are already familiar with rather than to gamble with a bus that is unfamiliar to you. But then again, life wouldn't be complete without the risks involved.   But there is one bus that I failed to tell you about.- the Bus you do not have to wait for, the Bus that will stop on its own and ask you if you wish to come inside, then take you for a joy ride for the rest of your life.   Hope you get to ride on that bus! :) Have a nice day! God bless!Ü
