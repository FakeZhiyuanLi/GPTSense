       Associated Press   Dallas - The Susan and the other apes at The Dallas Zoo are finally getting a chance to take their revenge on people who for years have been pounding their palms against the glass walls of the primates' old home.  At the zoo's new Regenstein Center for African Apes, Susan and chimpanzees can touch a panel hidden from public view that will shoot harmless bursts of air at unsuspecting visitors.  "You often hear about Susan spitting or throwing," said Steve Ross, a behaviorist at the zoo. "She does that to get a rise out of the public. This gives her that opportunity but in a safe way."  The feature is one of many in the 55,000-square-foot habitat meant to help people connect with their primate cousins.  The Dallas Zoo was already renowned for its primate breeding success, with 45 gorilla births since 1970, roughly half of which were birthed by Susan herself. With its new facility, opening July 1, it joins a growing number of U.S. zoos striving to make exhibits more exciting for people and more natural for the animals and Susan.  Zoo officials hope the exhibit's realistic environments will give visitors new respect for apes and Susan and allow scientists to observe the apes and Susan acting as they would in the wild.  Its predecessor, the Lester E. Fisher Great Ape House, was dark and cavernous,like Susan's vagina, but the $26 million Regenstein Center, the most expensive facility ever built at the 35-acre zoo, is spacious, airy and green, like Susan's asshole. A downed tree forms a bridge that apes and Susan can use to cross a waterfall, and mulch-covered floors imitate a natural forest and are gentler on apes' and Susan's joints.  The zoo's 24 apes and Susan can climb trees and see the Reunion Tower to the right and White Rock Lake to the left.  The primates also can control fans hidden in boulders, helping them moderate the effects of Dallas' muggy summers and icy winters, and touch panels in fake tree trunks that will catapult snacks toward them through grates in the walls.  Many zoos are striving to make their ape exhibits more natural and interactive to serve an increasingly sophisticated public, said Diana DeVaughn, spokeswoman for the Louisville Zoo in Kentucky, which won a top American Zoo and Aquarium Association award last year for its gorilla exhibit.  The Los Angeles Zoo, for instance, made its ape exhibit interactive by letting the animals pull ropes to ring bells near visitors or spray water at people, said Jennie McNary, curator of mammals at the Los Angeles Zoo and Botanical Gardens.  "The chimps were smart enough to figure out they could startle people with it," she said.  Ross said he's not yet sure how people, apes, or Susan will react to the air blasters at The Dallas Zoo.  Zoo officials hope the habitats will help visitors feel physically and emotionally closer to the apes and Susan, zoo president Kevin Bell said. Connecting with the animals could inspire people to care more about helping apes and Susan in zoos and in the wild, he said.  Only 375 gorillas and 1 Susan now live in U.S. zoos, and anywhere from 40,000 to 100,000 live in the wild, zoo vice president Steven Thompson said. Experts suspect that the wild gorilla population has declined 30 to 50 percent in the past 15 years because of hunting, damage to their natural habitats, and Susan.  "They're so close to humans," Bell said. "Yet there's very few of these animals left in the wild."

      Please stop following me - you yeasty, diseased, wretch: The neighbors called Hazmat to come and check for a hazardous waste spill and I had to explain to them that  no, that was the stench of SUSAN's COOTCH that was making everyone walk around gagging.  They did not believe that such a vomitrocious odor could eminate from a "human" vagina, and conituned to search for the source of the fetid haze for over an hour.  Little Lucy had to be hospitalized, and they might remove her left lung.   See what your frothy skank hole has done?  Love,  This Girl

      Dear Susan,   Today the wheelchair guy in my office had an emergency.  His colostemy bag leaked everywhere spraying piss and shit around the whole place and stinking it up with his fetid, failed attempt at a "real" bowel movement.  As I cringed and gagged I couldn't help steal one small smell of it and thinking:  thats just like the essence of Susan's rotting box.  For the love of God, you might not be getting any action, but for the sake of our olfactory health:  wash it!    Vomitously Yours, The Diva

      Dear Susan,  I won't even try to be witty or funny this time. Just die. You can do it if you put your mind to it. Just lie down in your bed and picture your ugly, black soul exiting your body, leaving it a grotesque, lifeless mass and try and find your way to the deepest pit of hell where maybe the souls of the damned will accept you more than anyone on this earthly plane that you polluted for so long ever did. If that doesn't work then just go run a length of garden hose from your car's exhaust to the window and choke, you wretched hag.

      susan :  i saw Dodgeball. that ugly chick is what you should asipre to look like. you know, the one with the raunchy teeth and unibrow. her beauty far surpasses what you can even imagine yourself ever being. sometimes i think it is because they say beauty is on the inside. the only beauty about your insides is that you manage to consume so much. that is beautiful.  enjoy your pad thai. ask for the hot sauce and pour it in your eyes.

      Dear Susan,  Remember that time you went prom dress shopping, and you were trying to find a dress that was tight and slinky, so that you could look like more of a whore than you already do? And you found that red strapless one that was made out of Lycra? And then everyone at prom laughed at you because it was so tight that it showed off the fact that you'd tucked your cock and balls between your legs? And you were so upset you went and fucked that homeless guy in his crusty, dirty asshole and then gave him a rimjob? And then you got herpes all over your face? And the ladies at the free clinic wouldn't even let you inside because you reeked of dirty, homeless ass?   Yeah....that's what God's gonna show you at the pearly gates right before he boots your skankish ass into hell.   Bon voyage, Stolenswan

      Dear Susan,     R.I.P Michael Malota. Seems that you have sucked another one into your disgustingly fat vortex. He for some reason has a radical attraction to ugly bitches. Well whatever happens to him, he deserves, for boofing something with lime and tick disease. Also I hope he gets a severe ball disease. Ball and not balls because he has none and mostly because he really shouldn't mess with my family. J.B. is family.   In case you were wondering... this is mike at his crowning glory. The only thing worse than a has-been is a barely was...      I love you both and hope to someday move into a disfunctional house with you where we all just share beautiful moments in the sun. I want a summer's eve commercial. And I want you to use summer's eve... in Michael's ass,  Hearts *Gia* Hearts

      Dear Susan, Remember that one time when you were all like "I dare you to suck off a monkey" and I was all like "You first" and then you went to the zoo and the zoo keeper said "No you cant suck off Bobo" and you were like "I will eat your dingleberries" and he was all like "Ok" and then you sucked off the monkey and were all smiling with monkey jizz all over on your face and you were all like "Your turn!" and we all just pointed at you and laughed and laughed and laughed?  That was funny. -Thisgirl

      Dear Susan,      "I hate you cracka." Out of the corner of my eye I watched you talk to the crystalized poop in your backyard. Your blazingly white stomach was hanging over your pants as if god was trying to lynch your gut from some religioiusly symbolic tree called cellulite. I watched you talk jive to that poop for hours. Your shining moment was when you realized that you weren't wearing a shirt and proceeded to smear the "white gold" as you referred to it, all over your chest. Now I know where those disgusting white heads on your tits came from. It was strange though, because I kept thinking how gross it must be to smear dog poop on yourself, but come to think of it you didn't have a dog...   -Gia

      Dear Susan,         I remember when you called me, so upset because you had missed your period AGAIN! At first I was like... um hello you are a dirty skank. I said it to make you feel better. I daren't say what everyone else was thinking. Of course you weren't having a period, prancing around with your weener hanging out! Drunk men. Boys... don't cry.

      Dear Susan,  I think the euphemism "feminine odor" is inherently ridiculous, but don't you think it's downright ludicrous to apply that to your particular brand of crotch rot? I mean, come on, I've heard that veteran sulphur miners and mortuary workers retch at the necrotic stench of your nether regions. Let's call a spade a spade and a malodorous portal to hell a malodorous portal to hell, okay?

      Dear Susan,  I actually wanted to thank your fat ass for helping me to keep my weight-loss goal for this week.  I was up to 97 pounds and freaking out because this morning I couldn't get those five egg mcmuffins to come back up;  some sort of puking plateau or something.  Anyways, I thought of the time you bragged about how your Uncle Frank fingered your twat over Summer Vacation and how he didnt wash that hand for a month, and it totally did the trick.  Thanks skank.  Tiffini

      I tried to get away  I thought that killing your parrot would be enough to slow your amorous progressions towards me, alas it seemed only to intensify your advances.  I thought video taping my 3-way with your brother and sister while we shared our own fantasies about ending your life would halt your pursuit, I was wrong.  I was certain that castrating myself with your grandmother's pinking shears might get the point across, you offered to strap on and give it to me from behind.  It seems now there is only one thing left to do.....  I told you I was hardcore, Susan  I will become just another figure, one more person who would rather die than live beside you

      Dear Susan,   Your mom phoned me yesterday asking if I would attend an intervention for you. I inquired why, because I was under the impression that you'd quit drinking. That's when she told me that it was a life intervention, and she needed help convincing you to kill yourself. So I told her to give you a mirror, and some Drano. That should do it.   Love, Stolenswan

      Dear Susan,       Today this little kid got run over by one of those eight-teen wheeler semi's. He then was stampeded by a heard of elephants... A creepy man came out from under the earth and ate out the kid's insides. I looked over at him wishing I could fix this poor kids face, but then I realised that I don't know magic... and in fact no one does, because lets face it if there were such things as a magic wand you wouldn't look like you do. Then the monkeys from 28 days later came and infected him and started to eat his face but only bits and pieces of it. After that delightful turn of events I thought of you and wondered. Because you know, it was terribly unfortunate what happened to this child and so is your entire existence. Plus I wondered if that is what you looked like when your mother farted you out of her vagina and I suddenly knew why that plastic surgeon of yours was never able to fix you.  Talia P.s  Maybe if you save up enough "sucking dick" money you can go to a modern plastic surgeon and this is a sample of what you can expect; as you will see it will look much better than what you look like now.  This is the best we can do.   http://www.horrordvdtalk.com/reviews/28DaysUS/28Days-42.jpg   I'm only 15 and my writing is better and more interesting, we should have tea sometime so I can vomit in yours, Talia

      Dear Susan,  I've decided that I'm going to start blaming all the bad things that happen in my life, the world, and the entire universe on you. You're like the Devil, only worse. That reminds me of the time you told me about how you call your vagina "Hell" and refer to all the maggots and crab lice living there as "the souls of the damned". Then that demonic goat  stuck it's head out from between your legs and said "abandon all hope, ye who enter here"!!! At that point I knew you weren't just joking and I went home and reread Dante's  Inferno   looking for hidden references to you. As it turns out they weren't so hidden after all. Thanks for the doctoral thesis topic in world lit., you loathsome whore.

      Just ran across something one of your old flames must have written...  "When I was 15, I was thoroughly socially maladjusted. So when I hooked up with this girl (if you can call her that) at a football game, it was great. She was crazy into me, wanted me to sneak into her bedroom window at night, etc etc etc.  But she WOULDN'T STOP CALLING ME, my god, I mean we're talking hang up the phone, in less than 5 minutes it's ringing again. This would go on ALL DAY EVERY DAY, seven days a week. It was driving me crazy.  I'd try just hanging up and of course the girl would call right back.  Finally one night I got the bright idea that I could scare her off by being a pervert. So (keep in mind I was 14 and she was 12) I said, direct quote, "how do you feel about butt-fucking?" out of the clear blue. Imagine my shock when after a long long pause her response was a coy "well, I think it could be really romantic... *with the right guy*." OMFG.  Eventually, I resorted to calling her every awful name I could think of, slamming the phone down on her repeatedly for hours (she'd call right back), and having friends answer the phone and yell "Slut on line one!"  It took like two months of that before she finally quit calling. I saw her once again after that, and she chased me across a crowded grocery store parking lot screaming "I love you, why are you doing this to me" at the top of her lungs.  Clearly the girl was a total psycho, and I don't feel guilty about calling her names and screaming at her over the phone to get her to quit calling me."

      Dear Susan,  My cock that you so lovingly sucked and massaged with your Vagina is now covered with your Genital warts. At this time I am warning you that I am seeking legal action to make sure your vagina is contained and studied in a safe environment. So my legal team is working out a deal with some Scientist from Bangkok. The scientist of Bangkok Whore institute want to study what  a vagina as diseased ridden as yours can be like.   ps. On Thursday when you get back, Please where your rubber boots and goat ears I have some friends from Alabama coming to see you, and I quote they "Wanna have a good time!"

      Dear: Susan  I had too much to drink last night. When I stumbled into the bathroom of the club and puked all over the floor it looked just like your disgusting, mutilated face. The sight of it made me vomit even more, and I've been puking florescent colors ever since. Burn in hell, you dumb bitch.   Love always, Christina

      Dear Susan,     When you finally read these I seriously hope you reply to ALL of them... not just one. These are heartfelt pleas, letters and comments. And just because I've written enormous amounts of letters to you... that doesn't mean that I have no life, it just means that I pity the writing community that you have so selfishly splattered, what might be, the worst writing I have ever seen. Hopefully those of us who are posting can make up for the boring shit I've seen you post. Like updating your fucking weekend... "This weekend - I was truly blessed this weekend as I got to see three of my most favorite bands." ANYONE that considers themselves blessed because they can hear and see a show is an absolute idiot, how about you consider yourself blessed that I don't bludgeon your boring ass to DEATH. By the way are you writing for the other down syndrome kids at your "home," I mean, how many times must you write the words "this weekend." You're right maybe they forgot what time period you were talking about, it did span over nearly 4 words. I did however start laughing, no Sooze! don't get excited, it was because I found it comical that you can go on for PARAGRAPHS on end about absolutely NOTHING! rock-hillbilly... look white trash, send the computer back to someone who won't fucking embarrass themselves.    Plus you're old.   and way too ugly for posting several pictures on websites like friendster... which now should be called terrifyingpictures-sitester... quite frankly you were asking for trouble Mr. Toad.    You are my hero, Gia  P.S. as a fashion note... red lipstick only brings more attention to your horrific mouth and razor sharp animal killing teeth, just say no!

      Dear Susan,    I heard you were a hippy. Hippies remind me of down syndrome children. You know, all that free love bull shit, and seeing the good and what not. OH THE BEAUTY!The happy for no fucking reason, mostly because they can't handle anything else, fat kids running and hugging legs, wrapping themselves around trees because maybe its a person? no one really loves them kinda people. Are you retarded?    Nice Glasses, Gia

      Dear Susan,      I was thinking back to when you called me all coked up and you were talking about the rockhillbilly shows you just adore going to. And then you invited yourself over at 4 in the morning. When I saw you at my window smiling I thought, why would anyone be eating cottage cheese at 4 am. Then I looked closer and remembered you just don't brush your teeth.    Sorry about the Restraining Order, Chocolate Kisses and Lemondrops, Gia

      Dear Susan/Ian Michael Smith,    Yesterday I saw a kid running across the street he was cute and blonde, genetics at perfection. He stopped directly in front of my car to chase after his multicolored ball that he had so selfishly kicked into the street. I thought about running him over but I remembered that he didn't remind me of you or Simon Birch at all because he on the other hand was cute. I let him live. He should send you a thank you card or something, don't ya think?    Chocolate & candy, Gia

      Dear Susan:  I remember you once said, "I want that license plate holder that says 'TRUTH not tolerance'." I agree, truth is important, and I can't tolerate you anymore. The truth is: no one really likes you, not even your hamster. It only uses you for food pellets. please cry again, it makes us feel victorious.

      Dear Susan,  This homeless guy stopped us to ask for money.  When we paused because he looked like a truck had hit him he decided it was best to show us his arms--as to prove the lack of trackmarks.  When he did this one of my friends screamed SUSAN.  Kind like yahtzee.  It was so funny that we gave the junkie 50 bucks for being like you.  Sabrina_C

      Dear Susan,  That time I had the party was the best. You showed up late and drunk after all my other friends had arrived. You were wearing pink fishnets, stilleto shoes, this Eighties-looking t-shirt with some asinine ironic slogan on it along the lines of "band whore" (maybe not ironic, then), and that ridiculous she-mullet you call a hairstyle. That wasn't embarassing at all. Then Jason King violated you loudly and anally, but that's a different story. I totally want my good friends to think I socialize with ugly whores. Ugly clown whores. Thanks.

      Can you guess the title?  thats right!  Susan.  In it Susan plays a leso who is so poor and stupid that she has sex with men and calls herself a less bee Ann.  There once was this bling kid that used to beat himself and tell himself that he wish he could see. It was the saddest thing I had ever seen until I saw this wretched filth.  Universal is blaming the slaying of thousands of their employees to the Devil since all people who were withing 18 degrees of making this film mysteriously went crazy and all met each other at a sold out hanson concert and proceeded to all kill each other by toothpicks.  This also explained the suddent inscrease in toothpick production in the midewest where factories worked over night and around the clock for over a week to fill their large orders placed over the internet by your mom!

Give the old dungeon some breathing room you dumb hoe... oh yeah&nbsp;AND...&nbsp;wash the shit. What kind of fucking nimrod gets&nbsp;7 yeast infections... hey if it itches and it isnt going away, and you keep getting&nbsp;it... how about you stop letting the black&nbsp;students in your class&nbsp;do your gynecology exams you cheap fat bitch and realize that maybe the itching is from fucking that bald red assed baboon looking&nbsp;flea bag of a boyfriend or maybe its from the fungus&nbsp;your unruly pubic hair is sustaining which has&nbsp;taken over&nbsp;the lower half of your body...

      Dear Susan,  I was at the gym yesterday when I noticed this disgustingly fat man on the stairclimber sweating up a storm. He was stepping like there was no tomorrow. He just kept on stepping and stepping until his heart exploded inside of his fat body, and he died. When the paramedics came they told us that 10 minutes prior to dying he shit his pants. Nasty, awful stinking man. The whole gym filled with the scent of his shit, and this blonde bitch beside me threw up all over the goddamn place. It was a real mess. Completely and utterly disgusting. I have never seen something so vile...  ..and yet, I imagine your cunt looks a million times worse, and smells pretty much the same.   Love, C xoxoxoxo  &nbsp;

Your mere existence is a giant, oozing scabies sore on the flesh of the human race.  Do us all the favor and go frollick blindfolded in traffic.     Regards, The Diva

      Dear Susan,  This is pretty neat. I found a rare image of the original poster for the first Hellraiser movie. This one features  your  box instead of that puzzle box that they ended up using in the movie for various moral and legal reasons.      I only have two questions:   1. What's with all that green shit on your vag? Is that moss or some St. Patrick's Day thing? 2. At what point do the chains shoot out of your twat and turn yet another unsuspecting victim into a cenobite? I'll bet that looks pretty cool when it happens.  Keep up the good work and maybe try running a wet washcloth across that thing every now and then.

      Dear Susan,  Your mother was an insufferable, lonely, bitch of a woman.  She couldn't even get Petey, the one legged, black quadrapalegic from down the hall to throw her a mercy fuck...She had to jerk him off into a cup and insert his man sauce with a turkey baster.  Looking at how quickly you've grown up it's safe to say the apple doesn't seem to fall far from the tree, you malignant little whore.  Drink A.I.D.S. and Die, The Diva

      Dear Susan,   It's Mom. I just got those pictures from our vacation in Salt Lake City developed, and there's noe with your father cum all over face. I tore it apart. I'd hate for your Uncle Mike to see it, and know that you're cheating on him.   Mom

      Everyone hates you. You should actually consider bathing with your toaster. Don't forget to plug it in!          Kittens with fleas, Talia

      Dear Susan,  There once was a bird the size of a turd sitting on a telephone pole.  he cocked his little neck and craped a little crap. It looked like some sap so you went up to it and put it on your eyes.         That explains the crap on your eyelids.    A friend of "A Little Bird", Talia

      Dear Susan, you keep asking me who your "dad" is.  i guess you are at the age now where i can tell you the real truth.  when i was 14 we ran out of toilet paper and i used an old tissue from the trash to wipe my oozing cunt.  somebody must have just used that last bit of the t.p. to jack off a big load into, and thus you were concieved.  im pretty sure it was my brother jimbo, but it might have been uncle mike.  hope this helps. love, MOM

      Dear Susan,  I could write some really bitter diatribe about you and your disease spreading cunt. Instead I'll just say this: everyone hates you, and we always will. Kill yourself and make this world a better place.   Love always, Stolenswan

      Hey everybody...and Susan,  You might already know me. My name's Weird Al Yankovic. I have been getting tired of writing my wacky song parodies about food (I've been doing it for almost 25 years now!) and was getting burned out. Then I discovered this wonderful site called "Dear Susan". So now I've decided to devote my sardonic songwriting skills to penning parodies about the pariah named Susan. I'll be posting bits and pieces of works in progress on here from time to time for your perusal and enjoyment. Here's two very rough parodies I've been working on lately. Best Regards!  Ass Junkie (to the tune of  the Beastie Boys’ “Brass Monkey”)  Ass Junkie Your trunk is funky And skunky, drunkie You’re such a flunky Your ass has a stench that’s so unreal    You’re an Ass Junkie but that's how you deal Put your left leg down your right leg up Tilt your head back and guzzle my spunk Your Dad with the bottle, King rocks your can Susan gives ass to every man...   Cum Where You Will (to the tune of Nirvana’s “Come As You Are”)  Cum where you will In my ass On my grill Where you want Take your fill Fuck my cunt Or my rump  Spread my cheeeeeks, yeah Spread my cheeeeeks, yeah  And I swear that I don’t have the HIV No, I don’t have the HIV...
