       The Mathe"Magician"   I was watching "Goodwill Hunting" a few days back and it reminded me about one of India's greatest Mathematicians, Srinivasan Ramanujan. He is respected as much as Euler, Jacobi and Gauss for his natural talent. His lack of formal education did not deter him from leaving his mark on the mathematical plane. Here is a short biography of the this great man.   urlLink Ramanujan

       Why is arranged marriage so much like getting a job   1. You have to have good qualifications. B.E is okay...M.S is preferable with EE given special consideration( since the S/W market is down).  2. The candidate should be a local candidate meaning Guy should in the U.S. irrespective of whether he works in Texas Instruments or Texaco Gas Station. RBI Governor in India means rejected.  3. He will have a phone interview with the manager( bride) and then on site with the company authorities.(bride's parents)  4. He has to clear immigration( Green Card Holder and should be able to sponsor spouse).  5. GPA should be above 3.5

       Direct Reflection of Fixation    This is just an introduction about this God's creation. I was brought into this world after operation , but with much celebration on June 17, 1979 in the middle of a summer vacation. My  parents were happy with the propagation of the generation through this new addition.  I passed Matriculation with hesitation and very little preparation. I followed the procession into the arena of technical education. The four years of under graduation was spent in utter frustration and very little jubilation. The concotion of foolish regulation and needless stipulation had pushed me into a state of desperation. Numerous acts triggered my vexation and irritation.   After undergraduation with little qualification and no other option, I took to graduation in the land of many invention. I had written an examination to test my English erudition to get admission to the nation whose pronunciation makes it a different version. Upon approbation of the application, I proceeded to the office of the immigration to get permission to fly to the destination.  On reaching the office of the immigration, the realization that so many people had been sharing my intention and fascination left me in state of exultation. On getting the information that I have been granted authorization to continue my specialization in a dynamic situation put me in excitation.  I left to the United States after much deliberation, negotiation and contemplation. This   location would give me a lot of inspiration to work on my dissertation. My mind was in a state of pre occupation with dreams of no limitation as I was on board in one of man's greatest innovation.  The touchdown in the land of temptation had me brimming with expectation, exhilaration and trepidation. I passed the interrogation with great satisfaction and proceeded to board my next aircraft to fly to my institution.  On landing at the city of perspiration, I found my accoutrements had be lost in utter confusion. I expressed my extreme agitation to the airlines organization who were in a world of stultification and treated me with obvious neglection. All of a sudden, the land of numerous temptation was turning into a grave of infinite deception.    Await in continuation...

       Association For India's Development    I volunteer for a non profit organization named Association For India's Development. It gives me a great kick to work for the upliftment of the country that has given me the identity in this world.  India has a very large tech population and still, when to compare it to the population of a huge country like India, the techs only represent a microscopic minority. There is more to India than the techies.  There is a huge population still living way below the poverty line. People who cannot even afford the basic amenities and struggling to make the ends meet. Association For India's Development is a non profit organization formed by the Indians, for the Indians, of the Indians. We work for the upliftment of the poor and underprivileged sections of rural India. The organization had its roots as a $200 project in a student apartment in University of Maryland, College Park. After 12 long years, AID has grown into a few hundred thousand dollar organization spreading its wings to 36 chapters across America.  So whats so great? AID has no paid employees, only volunteers. Volunteers are basically Indian graduate students. Grad students who have seen the best of the western world and yearn for the overall development of their motherland. AID has close to 400 of these committed individuals working in unison for a noble cause concerning the rural and urban poor.  So why did I join and why should you? For a long time, I have wanted to something of substance to India. Like most of us, I had wasted 22 years thinking what I could do and then I bumped into AID with whose founders and fellow volunteers I could identify myself. The common thread was Indian graduate students in the United States wanting to make a difference in India and the cause attracted me and I have become as addicted to it as a kid would be to a PS2 gameset.  I urge fellow students, professionals in India as well as in the United States to join AID for one reason - You Can Make a Difference and the satisfaction you get when you realize that you have made a difference is ineffable. We have complained and whined about the situations and scenarios in India for a long time. We have waited for the Government to force changes with little cooperation from citizens. Now its our turn to take things in our hands. Here is a social movement that we can support, join and contribute thereby launching our contry on the path of  "Real" Development.  Please  urlLink www.aidindia.org  for more information regarding the organization.   For all your days prepare  And meet them ever alike  When you are the anvil bear  When you are the hammer strike

      It has been a pretty dull day. Had my finals and had to prepare my cheat sheet which my room mate promptly called "BIT" (Its a piece of paper used by College/High School/ Kinder Garden kids in India with written notes and it is strictly prohibited). I can hear Auto Shankar etc. sending out loud groans as if to say if only they had allowed Cheat Sheets in their schools they would not have become criminals.

       Honesty is the best policy - Says who??   How many Indian students with an undegraduate engineering degree from an university as prestigious as Indian Institute of Technology will stay back in India and work for the Indian Government?   An Indian student is a valuable commodity abroad. We stand out due to our technical acumen, hardwork and dedication. The press has never ceased to write about the "Brain Drain" from India. The Indian Government over the years had done very little to keep the qualified engineers in their homeland. Very few Indian students choose to live in India after their undergraduate degrees and Satyendra Dubey, a Civil Engineer from IIT Kanpur was one among them.  Dubey was working on the "Golden Quadrilateral" project. His honesty and commitment to work were not the need of the hour there. Conspiracy theory was hatched on him. He fell a prey to the unscrupulous men who put money over men, them over us and I over we.   Its time to unite against corruption and put an end to this chapter of shame.

       Tale of Two Cities      All Characters in this article are purely real and any resemblance to anybody living or dead is definitely not accidental.      Triplicane is a traditionally Iyengar locality ( Vaishnavities) largely due to the beautiful Parthasarathy Temple adorning this place. Mylapore, on the other hand, has large Iyer community ( Saivities) also due to the famous Kapaleeshwarar temple situated here. Iyers and Iynegars are at logger heads in most of the issues but one common thread ( other than the sacred cross belt) that unites these communities is that they are TAMBRAMS( an acronym coined for Tamil Brahmins).     TAMBRAMS are quite unique in their thinking. TAMBRAM kids are raised with an amazing singlemindedness which would put the Al Qaeda terrorists to shame. The first words that a TAMBRAM boy hears as soon as he is out of his mother's womb is his father commenting " My Son will go to IIT". Every TAMBRAM irrespective of his grey matter, is born to become a Engineer, be a successful Engineer and breed a few engineers. I wouldn't be surprised if the American Governemnt changes their immigration laws for the TAMBRAMS just like they did for the Hispanics due to the contribution of the TAMBRAM community to the silicon valley.      Ask a TAMBRAM schoolgoing kid, his favourite subject.If he says anything other than Mathematics ( Kanakku, as his grandparents would have called it), then it means that in 20 years he will be a social outlaw. Mathematics and Math Tables are fed to him along with his baby foods which includes a daily diet of ladies finger( which exponential increases the retention capacity and makes a TAMBRAM remeber every formula deduced in the time from Pythogoras to Ramanujam). His lullabies go something like this "(a+b) = a2 + 2ab + b2, (a-b) = a2 -2ab + b2" sung in a lyrical fashion. A "CENTUM" in Maths is very important for his parents. A 98 or 99 in the subject even in a monthly test will put them to great shame in a community which soley measures the intelligence of a kid by his marks in Mathematics. Anything less than a centum would push his family into great depression and I have even heard of cases when the parents have put their children to concentration camp like rules so that he bridges the gap with the rest of the students.      The worst time in the life of a TAMBRAM is during his transition from high school to College. The Entrance Exam really takes a toll on him. He would be made to write exams in every nook and corner of this vast country so that he is not left alone and will surely join the herd of engineers produced by his community. Any credit to securing an Engineering admit will go to his parents and all the blame( if he fails to secure an admission) would be directed at the kid, who burnt the midnight oil studying for these exams. Even in Engineering, if he gets into any department other than Computer Science or Electronics, his parents would be considered unfortunate. Chemical Engineering, Production Engineering etc are considered equivalent to nothing more than a 12th Standard pass and his neighbors who end up playing a major role in his life would constantly advise his parents about putting him into NIIT or APTECH so that he works close to software, code and TAMBRAMS ought be the modern day equivalent of Karna and his armor.        After Engineering, the next stop in the TAMBRAM railway has to be a Masters in The United States. San Jose, CA is the dream destination of almost every TAMBRAM older generation. If it is not San Jose, it has to be Seattle or one of the Intel facilities.  The application process to the land of fruits and honey evokes a lot of animated conversations. Typically, our next house thatha( old man) would say " Apply in Stanford, my son lives in Ohio( pronounced o-eee-o) and he will come to pick you up from the Airport". For a TAMBRAM who is not well versed with geography and is a faithful follower of elder's words, this would seem like a really good idea. Little would he know that, Stanford and Ohio are thrice as far apart as Delhi and Chennai.      When a TAMBRAM lands in the United States after much hype and hoopla, he will start missing the single best thing that he liked about home - Mom's home made recipes. Idli with Sambar, Dosa with Millaga Podi( Crounded Chilli Powder mixed with Oil), Curd Rice with Mango Pickle, Adhirasam, Appam, ( traditional TAMBRAM sweets). Not able to get anything close to these, he settles for the next best thing which are Hamburgers with French Fries, Tortillas with Chips, Fried Rice with Lemon Grass Chicken, Brownies and Bagles. For a TAMBRAM family, a boy in the United States is a point of great pride. He is considered to be a few rungs higher in the social ladder than his cousin who might be finishing up his Masters in Economics writing up a good dissertation on " Poverty and its Effects in India". An Ecomincs Student is nothing but a COMIC NOSE in the family, a guy who had to settle for something as lowly rated as Economics.     Await more in the journey of a TAMBRAM......

      Steve Waugh - Australian for Mental Toughness  The Sun has finally set over the Australian Empire. The guiding light of this great cricket team Steve Waugh has hung his boots and will not grace the cricket grounds around the world with his red handkerchief. Few men have had better farewells in sport. The one who comes to recent memory is another legend in his sport, Pete Sampras. In a field where memory is short lived, the name of Steve Waugh and his deeds will be sung and remembered for time immemorial.  I started following this Australian Cricket team with such great intensity purely due to the "ICE MAN". I read far and wide about this extraordinary cricketer from Bankstown, New South Wales. I passed some of the vintage Waugh stories to my brother, with whom I had relished and cherished numerous Waugh moments. Whenever the run rate is a little below the normal rate and Steve Waugh is facing a spinner, both of us would cry out "Steve slog sweep him", to the extent of almost pleading him to slog sweep the ball over midwicket. Ironically, it was this slog sweep which proved to be his undoing in the final innings of his glittering career. Whenever the Aussies are in a spot of bother and Tugga walks to take guard, we both would say in unison " ICEMAN pathu paan da"( Iceman will take Care).  We rubbed on the spirit to my mom who has many times faced the brunt of our Waugh superstitions. I am sure she will vividly remember the 120 that Waugh made in the final super six game against South Africa in the 199 World Cup when she received the best hospitality from her sons. The truth being that we did not want her to get up from the chair as soon as Steve Waugh started unleashing his repetoire. But I guess, she should be thankful to us for having made her some exceptional rearguard action from the modern day gladiator.   I would rate the hundreds that Waugh made in the Caribbean as the most memorable moments of his career. I stayed up all night to watch Waugh battle out Curtley Ambrose and the West Indian pace battery. In an innings which ended the West Indian domination over World cricket, Waugh displayed character and silenced his detractors who had suspected his technique against the short ball.  If Waugh was hardness personified in the field, he was softness personified off the field. His human gestures ad philanthropic efforts have earned him great admiration and respect even in his final frontier of India. His endeavor to build homes for the leprosy affected children in Calcutta has ensured that his deeds will stand the test of time and will be remembered for a long time.  He has chosen to go out on a high. Few men can ever come close to him in terms of toughness and leadership. I will always revere him as my greatest idol in life.  For men may come men may go Waugh stays on forever.

       Much Ado About Nothing   The one news on everyone's lips over the past three weeks has been the India Pakistan Cricket Series. The fever is gripping even non-Indians and many of my office mates have wanted to know the basics of cricket. I have even been asked many a times to compare and contrast cricket and baseball. The joy of watching cricket with your friends ranks far ahead than sipping a beer and watching Super Bowl( not to mention the halftime shows).  This tour has had its fair share of controversies as well. The recent one being Rahul Dravid's decision to declare when Sachin tendulkar was just a hit waway from yet another batting record. there has been too much noise about the decision. I think all the attention is because it is Sachin. Ultimately, cricket is a team game with team's interest taking priority over the individual's. At this juncture, I would like to recollect a similar declaration by Mark Taylor while he was on 334 batting like a rock against Pakistan at Rawalpindi. Taylor decided to declare when he was not only a run short of obliterating Bradman's record for the highest individual test score by a Aussie batsmen but also when he was in sight of a world batting record then held by Brian Lara. He self inflicted the declaration and was glad to be bracketed with Don Bradman putting the team's interest ahead of himself. Such selfless deeds lift up the morale of the team and make the team a more cohesive and competitive unit.

       Turncoats   Yesterday was 4/4/4. It happens once in a 100 years. Isn't it amazing that our busy lifestyle does not allow us to spot some of these very minor but peculiar occurrences. More importantly, the clocks were advanced by an hour in the Pacific Coast yesterday.  Neither in India nor in AZ, the two places which I have called home ever since I was born, they observe daylight savings time. I slept the same amount of time as I would on any other day but suddenly it dawned on me that my sleep had consumed an hour extra. It seemed very weird and different because I have never experienced it before.  I am an avid follower of the Indian General Elections. The Largest Democracy in this world going to polls. Kudos to the election commission for organizing such a massive exercise with such great efficiency. The one issue that has dominated the last two polls in the country has been the foreign nationality of one of the candidates to the PM's chair. My viewpoint on the whole thing is very clear. "Can a person of foreign nationality lead India?" . My answer would be a yes if the person had spent sufficient amount of time in India working with the masses, relating to their problems and helping them resolve it. Someone in the mould of Mother Teresa or Annie Besant. I am not entirely favor of the person in question because of the sole reason the person is heading the oldest party in the nation only because of her dynasty. I do not see the person managing the demands of the topmost position in the country with ease and grace.   That doesn't put the other parties in any better position. They have their own shortcomings and anyone who wins must be deserve the victory and repay the people in kind for electing them.  Jai Hind

       Weekend Waiting   Hey its Friday... Two Days of break from the monotony... says who asked one of my mangers... I got to come this Sunday to work... Still I love breaks and I love Saturdays. Saturdays are spent in relaxation and Sundays are spent in tnesion of the week ahead. Thank Goodness, I was asked to come on Sunday and not on Saturday.....  I think it is going to be an exciting weekend. I am looking forward to the Final Four, a continuation of March madness into April. I am surprised at the amount of interest College games generate in the United States of America. A University of Madras versus Madurai Kamarajar University cricket  match would not even attract curious passers-by. United States of America is a marketing haven.   I am always hoping to finish a few more chapters of Ayn Ran'd pillow size book " Atlas Shrugged". The book is really riveting and within a few hours you get so addicted that you even start carrying it to the loo.

       Random Ramblings   India won the first test match. I hope we win the series and unless we win the series this series doesn't assume historic significance.   I woke up with four legs and seventeen hands this morning. I was bitten by an alien bug in my sleep last night. The doctors tell me that I might develop four more ears and have five pairs of genitals. I am worrying about how I will survive in this cruel Earth and I am planning to relocate to the moon during the first half of 2007. I heard United is flying a specially designed Boeing 1047 to the moon during that year and many real estate companies are selling chunks of land on the moon. I bet the Moon would be a great place for the United States to monitor the activities of Osama Bin laden and ultimately nab him.  If you think this is absolute bullshit then check out Google's futile attempt to April fool you today and tell me what you think about the same.  Even in this job market, people will not get fooled by that prank. Maybe, Javed Miandad can join Google in the moon as he is the only guy who is in immediate danger of losing his job.

       Whirlwind Weekend                     I had quite a long and happening weekend.. On Friday night, I hit the movie theatres to see Ayutha Ezhuthu- the latest offering by India's numero uno Manirathnam.. The movie reviews were not good but only Mani can present a movie with such class and depth in an era of masala potboilers.  The story is very uncomplicated... the offering is about three young men whose lives are changed by an old man... no points for guessing that the old man is a politician.... I have absolutely adored Mani's style of narration in his earlier movies especially Dalapathy, Mouna Ragam and Alaipayuthey and this movie seems to be no less.... The tales of the three men in their late twenties are presented in an episodic fashion with story of Arjun( a pseudo American played by Siddarth) following Michael( a reformist played by Surya) following Inba( a convict played by Madhavan)...I could identify myself with Michael Vasanth more than any other character... Madhavan brings out the best in him for Mani's movies... be it a lover boy in Alaipayuthey or a short tempered journalist in Kannathil Muthamittal or a convict in AE... Meera Jasmine plays his wife and she plays it well... Siddarth is definitely an improvement over his earlier Boys and Trisha has nothing to do but to look good... Surya plays Michael Vasanth and I am sure would win many hearts with his neat portrayal... The only distraction in the movie is Esha Deol who plays Surya's love interest and could have been completely avoided.Ironically, Esha is the only one common to both movies... I should say hats off to Bharatiraja for playing the politician's role with great elan... The veteran director should stop making films and start acting in them.. I hope his son is able to pick up some histrionics from his illustrious father...I think Mani should make his movies without songs although ARR has come up with some good music... In Mani's movies, songs slacken the pace... Just for the theme of youth taking to politics in an age when the country is ruled by 70 year olds, this movie needs to be welcomed....  Saturday... I should say was inspiring, to say the least. Had a chance to attend a talk by Balaji Sampath and really see the vision of the man through his words. Even though I have been involved in a little bit of community service, I am still driven by materialistic pleasures and goals. Balaji to me is one man who has given it all to the cause. I am 24 and someone asked me now to leave the United States and work for villages in India, I would either go crazy and kill the person or think the person is  lunatic. But Balaji is a role model, a person who at 24 decided to forgo a life in the United States amidst Mercedes' and BMW's for a life serving the 750,000 villages in India. His simplicity coupled with his ability to really use his background in Engineering to solve some issues is simply breathtaking...  As I write this, I like to be anachronistic and talk about Friday. May 21, 13 years before Rajiv Gandhi was gifted to the pangs of United States favorite topic "Terrorism". It sometimes seems to amuse me that the United States takes this topic very seriously after 9/11 whereas we have been facing the effects of it ever since Independence. I am also happy that sense finally prevailed in the land of honey and milk...  I also observed a fast on that day to show my support for Satyendra Dubey, a relatively unknown yet special IIT who was made known when he was murdered in Bihar for unravelling a scam. I hope the corrupt are brought to book and corruption is dealt with seriously atleast by future Governments. I sincerely would love to see that the issue is not swept under the carpet. If at all it is, then it is time to clean the house. Lets move the carpet and take out the skeletons. Let us start teaching the wrongdoers a very strong lesson.

       A Slap in the face of Democracy   As an Indian living in the United Sates, I am really perplexed and frustrated at how we have handled the issue of Sonia's foreign origin. The ground relaity is that an Italian Born was able to relate better to the issues of the common man in India rather than the "swadeshi" politicians in the NDA. It is a shame that while India was shining, the poor had actually been waning.  Sonia spoke the language of the people, she and her allies made the people realize that the incumbent government has not done anything much to them. BJP has been reaping a bounty of votes by stressing repeatedly on religuious and social divides. How long a country with more Muslims than Pakistan could have tolerated such a divisive attitude  There has been huge outcry from my friends here about Sonia donning the mantle. Most of us forget that it is always the poorest of the poor who always throng the election booths to vote. The reason behind this is very easy to comprehend. The rich never care about who runs the country because whoever runs they will stay rich. The middle class according to me  is one of the most selfish section of the Indian society. This class of society commments, complains but when the time arises when they can do something, they behave worse than insects. They act as spineless bodies who would rather watch "Bade Miyan Chote Miyan" on election day rather than casting their votes. The next day when the results are out, they begin their political analysis. The educated middle class in India does not have the right to talk about anything in this country. The poor are the only folks who go and vote in huge numbers atleast in a hope that the new Government might bring back some smiles to their faces. They really don't care whether Infosys is doubling their bonus or Intel opens a new facility. They care about their basic needs. They want three meals a day, a decent harvest and a peaceful atmosphere. BJP and its allies were not doing it and they bit the dust.   When Sonia's foreign origins come up, most of the Indians in the U.S have to say that this thing can never happen in the U.S. To me, it reflects two things 1) The inability of the United States to embrace diversity at the highest office 2) Indians here want to be just slaves.

      Why BCCI should really become MLC ( Major League Cricket)  Indian Cricketers- the ones who don't make it big find it hard to make ends meet. Money has to be pumped into the domestic league and ideally we should be following the franchise format that American sports follow. it increases competition and also gives options for people who want to take up to sports as a career. 11 people representing a country of a billion is very very cockeyed and its high time we started packaged it and marketed it a little better. Sport has to become a mainstream career option in India to produce better sportsmen and to make people start thinking out of Engineering Colleges.   Here is the other side of Indian cricketer. I hope the Dalmiyas and the Muthiahs wake up.   urlLink Columns - Jobless in India? Go abroad : HTCricket.com

       Indian Examinations For Dummies  "Poitu varan amma" ( Mom, I am leaving) screamed my girl next door. Today was her first exam for her tenth grade. "Nanna Paathu Ezhuditu Va"( literally tranlated it means See carefully and write) , a common pre exam one liner used by parents/grandparents/passerbys all over Tamil Nadu and often misunderstood by the LLB's( Lord of Last Benches) that he has to see the next person's paper and write.  Little does the parent and often times the child, know that the Indian Examinations fall broadly into the domain of Karma where you do your best and leave the rest to the examiner. Here are a few unwritten rules to taste success in your examinations.  1. Do we need margin on the right or on the left? The answer is both. Basically start drawing the margin on the left and move to "right", top and bottom. Imagine yourself to be a chess player, moving your ruler to every  conceivable space on paper and placing your pencil and drawing a line on it.  2. Just trust your instincts and keep writing in the direction ascertained by your mind. Adherence to word limit often leads to AIDS( Arrears In Differen Subjects) and might result in eventual fatalities. Most examiner don't correct but just weigh your paper to weigh your knowledge.  3. Don't get discouraged or underestimate yourself. But for a belief in preparation, the other person is no better than you.  4. Bits of Information is very important to succeed in exams. Make sure you carry Bytes of bits wherever possible. You can always acces data from them when the invigilator is in the drowsy mode.  So to every Tom, Dick and Hari writing exams perennially, Indian Exams nuture the unique "can-do" attitude in you and makes you strongly believe in the cliched "anything is possible" phrase.  DISCLAIMER: All thoughts mentioned in the above piece are valid in all Indian States except Bihar, where they have always believed that the "Sword is mightier than the pen".

       Sorry State of Affairs   12 soldiers were killed in a militant bombing of a bus carrying combat troops in Kashmir. No attention was paid to dead families by the men who rule the country. What a notorious act of neglect of patriotism. The whole country would be crying foul if Sachin Tendulkar had got a small hit on his helmet by a beamer by Shoaib Akthar. Jawans need to be treated with more respect and they are the ones who ought to be treated with most respect. Jawans are the reason why the inland India is safe.

       The Joy of Childhood   The weekend went quietly. I had to take up a defensive driving class to negate the effects of my overspeeding. It was a long, sleepy session but I came out of it a little bit wiser than before. I was happy even though I had a grudge that the amount of time spent was not proportinal to the amount of knowledge gained. I was at a Potluck on saturday and watched "Couplings", easily my most favorite TV comedy.  I watched "Perazhagan" on Sunday. It turned out to be quite a decent entertainer. I liked the casual air about the villian of this movie who unlike the usual movie villians did not have thirty people at his beck and call waiting to be beaten up by the heroes scissor kicks, somersaults and what not. Vivek made my heart light with his humor and its time somebody said "Achu"( over) to Aachi.  I played a little bit of cricket which was disrupted quite frequently by two American kids who wanted to join the game as well. I personally feel it is quite difficult to be a child in America. Its not often you get to play in the mud with your friends, fool around in the streets and while away time like you never can. The days of childhood were probably still the best in my memories. I still recollect in soltitude the times when I had homework pending till the last minute, was chucked out of class for calling the next kid by names, cried everytime Boris Becker lost a tennis match, went to each classroom and gave out choclates on birthdays, accompanied my best friend on his birthday,  wrote names of the talkative class mates on the board, took my cricket bat and went home just because I was given out.   As Bryan Admas would say " Those were the best days of my life"

       Bride Hunt or Maid Hunt   "Oru Paatu Paadein"(Sing a Song) uttered an old but formidable Mami,a card carrying member of the Mamiland, quite a busy group that stays inside the house only as long as their husbands do. The life of a Mami revovles around husband and kids, but the context differs with the axis of the earth. Mamis cook sumptuously for their husbands and kids in the mornings, gossip unendingly their neighbor's about husbands and kids in the afternoons and cry uncontrollably about Chitthi's( Sun TV serial) husband and kids in the night.  My friend, his family, Mami and me had come to inspect( colloquially "check out") a girl from a typical Iyengar neighborhood. Her life, his life might be decided in the next two minutes, I am almost as excited as watching a boxing bout in the thirteenth round. Suddenly out of nowhere this Mami, whom I had presumed all along was like me-someone who had agreed to be a part to this public dating exercise just for the sake of the delicious food that will be served, audaciously asked this three word sentence. Woe betide anyone who took it as just a three word sentence because in Mamiland it is really a camouflaged barometer of the girl's cultural upbringing and readiness to the marriage market.   By the time, the girl cleared her throat, my friend had adjusted his collar a million times and was  just about  ready to go into a duet with her. I was feeling sorry for this poor guy who was going to mortgage his carefully constructed life to this  one minute of madness. The setting with him eating the Bhajji and sipping  his coffee transmitting amorous signals made me think of a slaughterhouse where animals are ruthlessly guillotined after feeding them with a tummy full of food.  At this moment, I was feeling like an unwanted intervention in a family get together but my friend's father, who I had always thought was way more pragmatic than my friend intervened. "God Save(d) the Queen" was my immediate reaction(brought up in a country which would have supplied most of the Queen(s) jewellery collection, I have a natural aversion for the Queen and "God Bless the Queen") The stoppage in play was due to the Dad's unwavering dedication to garner attention for his son's education and qualification. Uncle (My Friend's dad. This is how I refer to him although I would love to call him by his pet name "Cheemachu". ) began by saying " My son did his Graduate studies in America" which did not surprise the girl even a vee bit. A Centum in Mathematics, IIT, Graduate Studies in the United States, San Jose, Microsoft were all carefully arranged furnitures in the dining room of a TamBram and show me any deviation from this pre-conceived set, I show you something wrong in his genes. Mr. Cheemachu continued in his baritone voice about my friend's apartment to his car to his savings scheme. Everybody knew where he was getting and I was listening in rapt attention to finally see the price tag on my friend, whom I had considered was not worth more than a dime.   I wouldn't want to elaborate beyond this point about what happend. The parties could not strike a deal for the merger and we lived another day for some more Bhajji and Kesari. I heard that this kind of pattern matching is called "Maid Hunting". How aptly named- I might anger some  feminists by agreeing with whoever called it "Maid Hunting" but the reality of the matter is that often times the feelings of the women are sabotaged. I hope that the utterly disgusting and business-like Dowry is totally eradicated.

       Shock and Awe  The Characters in this narration are imaginary but the narration is real.  "Adhavadhu, Sir" began my next door MAMA( tamil for unwelcome, unwanted 2 cents of advice. MAMA also means uncle but this MAMA is not that MAMA). MAMA is a torchbearer to the long standing belief in the community that a 1935 tenth grade is yards more cognizant than an IAS officer of today. He never forgets to remind you that "Naan antha kalathu SSLC da" ( I studied SSLC(tenth grade) in those days) and you are often left wondering why you were born in free India.  MAMA's opening words are often reflective of his mood. "Adhavadhu, Sir" usually meant "Danger"- the man has been bored sitting in his house, he has read the daily newspaper from the date to the obituary column, called his wife for his nth coffee and has been forcefully pushed out of the house. With the whole world (news) now in his fingertips, he needs some local news( in colloquial English, this is what we term "gossip")He ventures out of his apartment and by the time, the next door hapless neighbor could react, he is in their sofa munching some mixture and coffee from their house.  MAMA exasperatingly continued "Adhavadhu Sir, intha Sonia Eppadi Pannitalae?"( How come  Sonia could do this?)in a tone which might suggest to passive, ignorant onlooker that Sonia was his daughter-in-law. The next few words, from his mouth often punctuated with the sound of the mixture hitting against his teeth, would make his stand a little more clear. "Ennava irundhalum, Jannanga ellam avulluku thane votu potta" ( Afterall, the people voted for her). My brother and me started exchanging the bemused looks as we knew MAMA to be a strong advocate of no-foreigner policy but then we knew MAMA changed colors often just like Vijayaganth( intended typo) would in the dream songs. When my brother was waiting for his Engineering admission, all that MAMA had to say in encouragement was " Waiting list number 745 ah, edhavadhu Arts college la  admission Kadaikkum" (Waiting list number 745 is it, you will get into a Arts College.). When he eventually got the admission, MAMA's somersault would have  made Ganth proud -"Naandhan appove sonnenolloyo, unnakku Enginnering Collegela edam kadikuumnu, naan andha kalathu SSLC Da.. Naan sonna Thappa irrukadhu" (I have told you time and time again, that Engineering is your destiny. I am never wrong, I studied SSLC in those days)  Then my dad retorted by giving his thoughts on the Sonia situation. We were hoping that Mama has had enough for the day as his mixture plate was empty and there was nothing in his coffee tumbler but a few flies. MAMA was inspired by Rahul Dravid today and he seemed immovable like "THE WALL". MAMA went to blame Indira Gandhi for sending Rajiv Gandhi abroad  and this is from the man who exhorted my reluctant brother to go abroad for his studies by saying "Poi, Intella Sendhurungo" (Go and Join Intel as if Gordon Moore and him shared the same bed while he was at Michigan) and he also added a communal angle to the issue by saying  "Vellinatla thanda, Brahmanalluku Madhiipu" (Brahmins are respected only abroad).  By this time, we all knew MAMA had come for a long innings and would fade away once the serials started in Sun TV. Little did we expect, what MAMA had to say next. MAMA cautioned my dad - " Paathu da, Un paiyanum edhavadhu vellakarriya kuttindu vandhuraporan" (Be careful, even your son might grab a white chick.) Little does he know, that my brother with a name which is 18 characters long, dark moustache and eating a daily diet of Vattha Kuzhambu, Paruupu Thogaiyal, Curd Rice doesn't even stand a chance with a desi girl. As soon as my dad eys wandered out of boredom, MAMA knew where to target and he said "Enndi Saroja, Ennoda co-brother oda moonavathu sisteroda rendavadhu machninanoda nallavathu ponnu kudda americala enggayo San Jose amme angathan irrukal,Pnnu peru Ranganayaki avala vennumna on paiyan aravadmudhuku pakkalama" ( Saroja(my mom) , my co-brother's third sister's second brother-in-law's fourth daughter is in America in a place called San Jose, shall we hook up your son Aravamudhu and her... her name is Ranganayaki). Alas, my brother is going to get hitched to some XYZ who thinks sex is like Crocin which needs to be taken only when necessary i.e when your parents are forcing you to have kids. My brother and me were freaking out at the thought of this and my dad was trying his herculean best to put an end to this topic which usually interests my mom every minute. After 5 hours of gruelling wait, our moment of triumph did come and it was because Mama could hear "Annamalai"( not be the mistaken with the Thalaivar padum. This is the run of the mill Sun TV serial in which the dad predictably has retired out of a Government job after 35 years of service. He has spent his last penny bringing up 4 kids- 3 daughters and 1 son. The son is predictable married to a girl from a richer household and is predictably living with her. Daughters predictably are being treated cruelly by her husbands. The serial is predictably brought to you by the glycerine making company) title song which was resonating off the walls of every house in the apartment.  MAMA never came back again as Manmohan Singh took charge. My brother after years of toil without avail finally got a girlfriend of his choice...  Until MAMA returns with the next WMD- Wambu MahnaDu(Gossip Conference), we are all safely bachelors.

       Sympathy, Antipathy and Venkatachalapathy     urlLink  Ahead of its time  was how Hindu's Sudish Kamath has described Mani Rathnam's latest classic in two lanaguages. I somehow do not agree with Sudish that the movie is well ahead of its times. It is a well made, well thought out movie about youth belonging to three different backgrounds. The very essence or beauty of Manirathnam's movies is that you can identify with some of the characters in the movie. As a rebel, I am able to identify myself with Surya. As an utopian who dreams about living in America, I can identify with Siddarth. Manirathnam always makes movies about characters you have seen or you have heard about.  Only hypocrites will reply in negative if you ask them whether you have been or seen the Madhavan character in Alapayuthey or Karthik's role in Mouna Ragam. Nandita Das in Kannathil M... or Pankaj Kapoor in Roja are folks whom we have read and heard about. Also you should commend Manirathnam for shooting his movies in India and India only. Some of the locales in Roja, Bombay, Dil se would make you gape at the aesthetic beauty of the Indian landscape. Even the title of the Tamil version is so thoughtfully coined. Ayutha Ezhuthu is Aak( represented by three dots , two on one side and one on the opposite side. If you see the movie, you will realize the two dots which were on the same side.  On a related note, I heard that the Hindi audience did not like the movie. Why am I not surprised?. Hindi movie audience do not want to accept reality. They would rather see Shahrukh Khan as a school student winning his Chemistry teacher than Ajay Devgan winning the By-Elections.Having seen a few of those megahits in Hindi, I have developed an Einstein like understanding of those movies. Take a Manirathnam movie and rip away reason and logic, you will get a Hindi blockbuster. If you are not capable of doing that, then go to your Aunt and I am sure she will have a video tape of her wedding. See the wedding and replace your Aunt with Shilpa Shetty or Madhuri Dixit and your uncle with one of the Khan's and you have a winner on your hands. Do not forget to give it a long name - " Meri Aunty Ki Shaadi" (MAKS). It is a no brainer that the hero and the heroine meet in either the hero/heroine's wedding. It will be a bigger hit if the hero/heroine is already hooked on to some useless rascal within the family by their parents. There has to be a minimum of 8 songs with three songs shot anywhere outside India.How about returning to some of those after dark movies you watched in your teenage years. Squeeze your brain, remember the fleshiest parts and build an absolute no- sense plot around it and what you have in your hands- "Cheat", "Boyfriend", "Teacher", "Neighbor" - all offerings that would catch fire with the Hindi Log... Here is one of my friends thought about Hindi Movies....  urlLink  Hindi Movies   So, are Tamil movies any better? Puhhhhllleaassse would be the most popular retort. Making a Tamil movie is probably easier than heating up milk in the house. All you need is a village, one boy, one girl. Needless to say that each belongs to a different caste and their dad (usually one of them is Vijayakumar and the other is Sivakumar) heads their respective castes. Intialize your variables by showing some instances of fatherly affection between daughter and dad, some tearjerking between mom and son whenever he goes into the village and drags a fight with anyone who speaks ill of his father. Start your process by firsting NANDing the hero and heroine and finally ANDing them in a loop. One usual comedy track irritatingly headed by Vadivelu or Vivek beheading the value in humor. Throw in two romantic songs, one utterly disgusting song praising Vijayakumar and one sentiment song. If guys cannot guess the climax, then rush to the nearest video shop and close your eyes, take any movie, rewind it all the way till the end and watch the climax. If Hindi movies show hearoines with hot bodies and no brains, Tamil movies show heroines with neither. What you have is so called "Bombay" heroine with no "Bomb".    Sympathy for Manirathnam that he is living in a time ruled by sex, lies and pirated CD's. Antipathy for Hindi movies and only Venkatachalapathy can save Tamil movies.

       Diamondbacks Vs. Yankees at Phoenix   Does it make me feel nostalgic or what? 3 years back in October 2001, baseball was still alien to me. It did not make any sense at all. Why would I hit and anlways run knowing that the fileder is going to get me? Sounds crazy....  It all changed in a span of 14 days. Arizona Diamondbacks, my home team was in the World Series and the mood was electric. I learnt the game in a jiffy and the seventh game victory, with Luis Gonzalez hitting a blooper off "He-Man" Mariano Rivera to win it alll was just unbelievable..... At the end of it, I used expletives at the Yankees like I would never do again..  The party went on till midnight on the roads of Tempe, AZ. We took to the roads with traditional South Indian rural music and we were dancing in the streets.... Relive it all, Yankees face the Diamondbcks at the Bank One Ball Park in Phoenix for a three game set starting Tuesday.....  I hope the D'backs whack the shit out of the Yankee team...

       All about a Dawg   I watched "What Women Want" last night and freaked out at the idea of listening to what other people thought about me. I couldn't hold my excitement longer. I logged into the internet and noticed at a friend's blog that there was a personality test which would tell me what other people thought of me...... Great!!! took it and this is what it had to say   "Others see you as fresh, lively, charming, amusing, practical, and always interesting; someone who's constantly in the centre of attention, but sufficiently well-balanced not to let it go to their head. They also see you as kind, considerate, and understanding; someone who'll always cheer them up and help them out."   I almost felt like this unique amalgam of Charlie Chaplin, Mahatma Gandhi and Buddha. Suddenly I got the feeling that maybe it also meant I was Narcissistic.  I tried another test and this is wot it said   "Others see you as one who exaggerate achievements, expecting others to recongize you as being superior. You possess a sick sense of humor often bordering on chauvinism. They see you as an epitome of self centeredness. You also tend to exaggerate friendships and relationships, believing that everyone loves you. You are often manipulative."    In seeking to find out "What Women Want", I am left screaming "Who am I"

       The Flip side of the coin   The last few weeks after the elections have been interesting. There has been a widespread Hindu bashing. Indian Express ran a story today about how Indians have forgotten the "Hindu" civilization. It also points out how the gravest of religious massacares have occured even during the "secular" regimes.  I totally agree with the writer on certain points but I strongly believe that Hinduism is a beautiful way of life where each Hindu is given an wide space to practize his religion. Hinduism is not governed by tenets, it does not say how many times you should pray, how many times you should visit the temple, how many times someone should fast etc etc.  Every Hindu decides what is Hinduism. That space ought to remain inviolable. It is a space worth living and dying for.  Hinduism should not be imposed. Hindus don't want to be associated with the word "fundamentalists"  and with all the state sponsored aggression in Gujarat, the world over the Hindus have been assigned the unwanted tag. Being proud of the civilization and being imposing are two different things and the previous Government had crossed the line.    urlLink This inner voice too needs hearing

       Yash Raj Films Present "Olympic Jyothi 2004: A Shame in the Name of F(l)ame" Featuring Aamir Khan, Bipasha Basu, Aishwarya Rai, Vivek Oberoi and Milkha Singh   I would excuse anyone who thought this was the muhurat of a new movie. But unfortunately not, these were the folks who carried the Olympic torch through the streets of Delhi. India has a dearth of successful Olympians agreed but do even Aish, Bipasha Basu , Aamir Khan and Vivek Oberoi watch the games. Can't Indian Olympic Association find some other hands for that famed torch. India has once again proved that it is fast becoming a prey to sponsorship, glitz and glamour.  They could have atleast called the "Olympic Hopefuls" to carry this torch. Paes, Bhupathi would have been a better choice than Oberoi and Aamir. I also take a strong exception to the belief that "Sachin or Sunny should have been called". I am not sure why cricketers need to carry the torch. Cricket is not a part of the games and these cricketers pay mainly for their monetary benefits. The one time, they were asked to represent the country in the Commonwealth games , they made a huge hue and cry about not these matches being scheduled in the same time as the sponsorship driven "Sahara Cup" played in cold Toronto.  India can become a stronger sporting nation only if we started thinking out of the stumps, bat, pads and gloves.

       AUSTIN POWERS MINI ME    I am neither a spy nor a baddie. I am just reacting to the AID Conference that I attended in Austin couple of weeks back. It was inspiring to say the least. It invigorated the me inside ME and has given me the vision to look at the larger picture. Where do we stand in the pantheon of useful people to this world has always been a burning question torching my thoughts. I finally found an answer... I stand nowhere.   I had this golden opportunity of listening to Rajendra Singh, the man who shattered the myth that "Large Dams are pillars of India" by professing that traditional methods of water conservation and harvesting done efficiently can make India a water sufficient country. I am not proficient in Hindi but somehow I could realte to what he was saying even before the intrepreter called it in English. The problems that touch your heart always reached your mind irrespective of the language they are conveyed....

       That That Man, That That Problem   I found this following narration, recitation, frustration or whatever you may call it extremely funny and relevant. I should narrate a personal incident that happend a few years ago. When one of my friends quizzed me about Salman Rushdie's girlfriend, I guessed and said " Elizabeth".... He laughed his butt off and said "Padma Lakshmi". Padma Lakshmi is a traditional South Indian girl's name(often shorterned to "Paddu") and it has won the attention and admiration of Sallu. I am left wondering when Partha( elongated to ParthaSarathy) is going to have the same fate with Liz or Beth.   "The Travails of Single South Indian men of conservative upbringing"   or "Why we don't get any..."      Yet another action packed weekend in Mumbai, full of fun, frolic and   introspection. I have learnt many things. For example having money   when none of your friends have any is as good as not having any. And   after spending much time in movie theatres, cafes and restaurants I   have gathered many insights into the endless monotony that is the love   life of south Indian men. What I have unearthed is most disheartening.   Disheartening because comprehension of these truths will not change   our status anytime soon. However there is also cause for joy. We never   stood a chance anyway. What loads the dice against virile, gallant,   well educated, good looking, sincere mallus and tams? (Kandus were   once among us, but Bangalore has changed all that.)   Our futures are shot to hell as soon as our parents bestow upon us   names that are anything but alluring. I cannot imagine a more   foolproof way of making sure the child remains single till classified   advertisements or that maternal uncle in San Francisco thinks   otherwise. Name him "Parthasarathy Venkatachalapthy" and his inherent   capability to combat celibacy is obliterated before he could even   talk. He will grow to be known as Partha. Before he knows, his smart,   seductively named northy classmates start calling him Paratha. No   woman in their right minds will go anyway near poor Parthasarathy. His investment banking job doesn't help either. His employer loves him though. He has no personal life you see. By this time the Sanjay Singhs and Bobby Khans from his class have small businesses of their own and spend 60% of their lives in discos and pubs. The remaining 40%   is spent coochicooing with leather and denim clad muses in their   penthouse flats on Nepean Sea Road. Business is safely in the hands of   the Mallu manager. After all with a name like Blossom Babykutty he  cant use his 30000 salary anywhere. Blossom gave up on society when in   school they automatically enrolled him for Cookery Classes.   Yes my dear reader, nomenclature is the first nail in a coffin of   neglect and hormonal pandemonium. In a kinder world they would just name the poor southern male child and throw him off the balcony. "Yes   appa we have named him Goundamani..." THUD. Life would have been less kinder to him anyway. If all the women the Upadhyays, Kumars, Pintos and, god forbid, the Sens and Roys in the world have met were distributed amongst the   Arunkumars, Vadukuts and Chandramogans we would all be merry casanovas   with 3 to 4 pretty things at each arm. But alas it is not to be. Of   course the south Indian women have no such issues. They have names   which are like sweet poetry to the ravenous northie hormone tanks.   Picture this: "Welcome, and  this is my family. This is my daughter   Poorni (what a sweet name!!) and my son Ponnalagusamy (er..   hello..).." Cyanide would not be fast enough for poor Samy. Nothing   Samy does will help him. He can pump iron, drive fast cars and wear   snazzy clothes, but against a braindead dude called Arjun Singhania he   has as much chance of getting any as a Benedictine Monk in a Saharan   Seminary.   Couple this with the other failures that have plagued our existence.   Any attempt at spiking hair with gel fails miserably. In an hour I   have a crown of greasy, smelly fibrous mush. My night ends there. However the northy just has to scream "Wakaw!!!" and you have to peel  the women off him to let him breathe. In a disco while we can manage   the medium hip shake with neck curls, once the Bhangra starts pumping   we are as fluid as cement and gravel in a mixer. Karan Kapoor or Jatin   Thapar in the low cut jeans with chaddi strap showing and see through   shirt throws his elbows perfectly, the cynosure of all attention. The   women love a man who digs pasta and fondue. But why do they not see   the simple pleasures of curd rice and coconut chutney? When poor   Senthilnathan opens his tiffin box in the office lunch room his female   coworkers just dissappear when they see the tamarind rice and   poppadums. The have all rematerialized around Bobby Singh who has   ordered in Pizza and Garlic bread. (And they  have the gall to talk of   foreign origin.)   How can a man like me brought up in roomy lungis and oversized   polyester shirts ever walk the walk in painted on jeans (that makes a   big impression) and neon yellow rib hugging t shirts? All I can do is   don my worn "comfort fit" jeans and floral shirt.      Which is pretty low   on the "Look at me lady" scale, just above fig leaf skirt and feather   headgear a la caveman, and a mite below Khakhi Shirt over a red t   shirt and baggy khakhi pants and white trainers a la Rajni in "Badsha".   Sociologically too the tam or mallu man is severely sidelined. An   average tam stud stays in a house with, on average, three grandparents, three sets of uncles and aunts, and over 10 children.   Not the ideal atmosphere for some intimacy and some full throated   "WHOSE YOUR DADDY!!!" at the 3 in the morning. The mallu guy of course   is almost always in the gulf working alone on some onshore oil rig in   the desert. Rheumatic elbows me thinks.   Alas dear friends we are not just meant to set the nights on fire. We   are just not built to be "The Ladies Man". The black man has hip hop,   the white man has rock, the southie guy only has idlis and tomato   rasam or an NRI account in South Indian Bank Ernakulam Branch. Alas as   our destiny was determined in one fell swoop by our nomenclature, so   will our future be. A nice arranged little love story. But the agony   of course does not end there. On the first night, as the stud sits on   his bed finally within touching distance and whispers his sweet   desires into her delectable ear, she blushes, turns around and whispers back "But amma has said only on second saturdays..."

      An Hair -Rising Experience  Sushma Swaraj was going to take away the swaraj from her name. She was wedded to her politics which died a sudden death at this year's elections. Hence Madam Sushma Swadeshi decides to mourn the death of her political style by shaving her hair and taking sanyas.  What a good riddance for the country? Widowed ladies not being able to carry on with lifer after the death of their husbands has been a tradition that has been criticized and decried by everyone from Dayanand Saraswathi to Golwalkar. Yet, Sushma used this cheap and stupid traditional method to intimidate a "Videshi Widow". Don;t you think the country is better without women like this.   Women like Sushma, Umabharti, Mamta, Jayalalitha and Mayawati are a strong case of reducing the reservation alloted to women in politics.     urlLink India Together: Sense and nonsense - opinion by Kalpana Sharma - June 2004

       Support Bihar and Assam   "God cannot be so cruel. We are poor and needy. We work hard to make ends meet. Now he has rendered us homeless. God cannot be this cruel" would be the common lament among the 40 million people ravaged by floods in the eastern states of Bihar and Assam. With over 200 people dead, thousands of lost homes and the lingering threat of an epidemic this year's floods have been particularly massive and are having a widespread devastating impact. In this hour of deep sorrow, the least we can do from far away America to the grief stricken souls, is help. Isn't it better to light a candle rather than blame the darkness?  Association for India's Development Inc. (AID), a nation-wide charity with over 30 chapters has been communicating with our partner organizations and other NGOs in Assam and Bihar over the past few weeks to assess the disaster and assist in the relief and rehabilitation efforts. Relief efforts are particularly essential to support health needs and essential medicines, temporary shelters. Efforts to ensure access to food and clean water are also of immediate importance. Long-term rehabilitation efforts may be needed in terms of livelihood opportunities.  AID has set up a special fund for supporting relief and rehabilitation efforts and has sanctioned $10,000 toward the fund to begin support of relief efforts. This is just a small as the actual need for supporting our partners' work alone may be four to six times this amount.   With over 22 million people of Indian origin living outside India and half of this 22 million living in the United States, AID appeals to the community at large to contribute significant additional amounts so that prompt relief and a more enduring rehabilitation effort for affected populations are possible.  Any contributions in excess of the present need made toward the AID's Relief and Rehabilitation Fund  will be used to fulfill other disaster relief needs on a case by case basis in the future.  Contributions to AID can be made through secure on-line credit-card deductions from AID's website:   urlLink www.aidindia.org/AssamBiharFloods/AssamBiharFloods2004.html   where details and updates are available. Please indicate that your contribution is for the relief and rehabilitation fund. Contributions can also be sent by check mailed to:       AID - Zone 3,      P.O. Box 4801      Mountain View, CA 94040-0801      (Indicate "Relief and Rehabilitation Fund" in the check memo)  Please feel free to contribute any amount as at this time of need, even a small amount can make a huge difference.

       "What's in a name? That which we call a rose By any other word would smell as sweet."    After  days of Ganth Bashing and Moore loving, I saw a great movie "Autograph". A very realistic depiction. Cheran had done a wonderful job of walking on thin ice and maintaining viewer interest in the film. The film would have easily fallen into the panthenons of the boring art movies had he slowed the pace even a wee bit. I remember a similar practical but very very boring movie of yesteryear's "Veedu" - which had emotions and sentiments that everyone could identify with but the pace of the movie was too slow. I remember Balu Mahendra would show how the old man( popularly called "Veedu Thatha") brushes his teeth clean and this reel would go for five damn minutes.  More importantly "Autograph" - the title mystified me. Wasn't it apt to name it "Autobiograph(y)" . Maybe the masses would have heard  the word "Autograph" and not "Autobiography" which sounds more like a Crichton novel than a Cheran film. He could have named it "Autobiography : Edhu Ungallin Kadhai" just to make sure that it was not an English movie and also attract the village masses. It would have reversed the irritating trend of giving a tamil name and using a english punchline like "Narasimha : The Ultimate Force", "Alexander:Where is Wasim Khan?" , "Vallarasu: Please Run Away" , "Nattamai: Reverse the Judgement" etc etc.  One of my friends was remarking that English films dubbed in Tamil were the best moneyspinners these days. Isn't that strange? Imagine the names of the dubbed movies. Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon - "Padhungum Puli Marayum Pambu", Harry Potter and the Sorcer's Stone- Harry Potterum Mandharavadhi Kallum, Rush Hour- Avasara Neram( you want to piss) , Rush Hour II - Avasara Neram II ( you want to pee),Van Helsing - "Komberimookan", Beautiful Mind - "Azhagiya Moolai", Spiderman - "Ettukal Manidhan" etc etc  Names are the ulimate testimonials to the term "Deceptive Packaging". A guy named "Arokiyasamy" ( God of Health) would be visiting the doctor just as often as you would use the restroom. "Harichandran" ( an Indian mythological character, known for his honesty) will  embody the characterstics of  "Harshad Mehta" than "Harichandran". Raman will have multiple affairs and Monica might be a virgin for lifetime.  How about nicknames? Nicknames stick on to you like a leech. I have friends named "Oops", "Fider", "Pistol" , "Pop" , "Bellagio"  and I don't recognize them if people refer to them by their real names. More mysterious behind the nicknames are stories behind those. Some of them can even be A-Rated. We recently named a friend PKS - "Pall Kutti Samiyar" due to his obsession to get sainthood at an early age. I am sure he sincerely hopes the name doesn't stick on as he approaches matrimonalism as guys atleast the desis,strongly believe that names play a vital role in landing a good wife. A belief stemming from the stories of Palpandis, Poonguzhalsamys etc etc. For non believers, browse through my blog and you can find one such story written by a frustrated soul.  If a certain dude named William Shakespeare ever meets you, send him to me because he wrote in Romeo and Juliet "What's in a name". How untrue when so much depends on your name and when that name is not Romeo Montague?  Yours Truthfully Nahsradus Hserus

       Comfortably Dumb    I had this wild imagination last night about Vijayaganth(Ganth) starring in Farenheit 9/11.&nbsp; Ganth would have seen the approaching flight even with this back facing the flight and he would react by flinging a nylon rope from the ground to the needle atop the Empire state building(ESB). He would then make a  timely dive from the top of the ESB and catch the wheels of the plane. With all his might, he would then pull&nbsp; down the aircraft vertically and make it land safely. He would use his extra sensory perception to realize that there is one more threat and order "Tamil Nadu Police" ( whose help would have been sought by &nbsp;the defence secretary) to throw a huge net close to the Statue of Liberty. Just when everyone is wondering why there is a huge net, Ganth would get to the top of the WTC and wait for the aircraft to fly in. The terrorist would outsmart Ganth and would basically fly in from the other side. Ganth would do a huge somersault and kick the aircraft on its base and the craft would do a million circles in the air but would fall in the net. He would then nab Wasim Khan ( conveniently christened for the sake of luck, supersition and numerology) and hand him over to a Tamil speaking President of United States. Secruity Advisor would then warn him and ask him to be careful with Osama as he is a very dangerous guy. Ganth would reply "Andha Osamava pathu&nbsp;vellai maligaila&nbsp;irrukra neenga vana bayapadalum, aana intha Tamil Nadu polizzee bayapadadhu" ( People living in the white house might be afraid of Bin Laden but not Tamil Nadu Police). He would then walk away in his long coat and thiruvizha cooling glass.   Osama would be in the caves drinking&nbsp; kalla sarayam ( Illicit Arrack) and watching disco shanthi dance when one poor soul would come and convey the news.&nbsp; He would then call Ayman Zahiri and the rest of his associates to hatch a plan to get Ganth either alive or dead. Once again all their conversations will be in Tamil with an alien accent. Ganth would get intelliegence pictures of the caves and "joom" into the rocks using MS-DOS and find out with GPS accuracy where Osama is hiding. Ganth expectedly would go all alone and meet the lion in its own den( how apt the phrase is for Osama). After Ganth finishes off all of Osama's adiyals( henchmen) who will be waiting to get hit just like people wait to see the Lord in Tirupathi, he would take the bull by its horns, sorry the beard. At the end of the long tussle where Ganth will make gravity defying moves, Ganth would pull the Osama's beard and to his astonishment, he would find that Osama is none other than his father-in-law with a beard.&nbsp;Ganth would then sermonize his father in law about how he has chosen to sabotage the world etc etc and then finally would kill him.The whole world will praise Ganth's brilliance.   All this might sound brain dead to most folks. But this is not exaggerated even a vee bit. You have no "kloo" about the heights to which logic can be sacrificed. At the end of the whole experience, you are left wondering "Ignorance is such a bliss".    urlLink Gravity = 9.11&nbsp; Defying Newton - Click here

       Achamillai, Achamillai Acham Enbathillayae ( Fear nothing) sang the great Tamil poet, Bharathiyar. The song is often taught in schools and the kids are made to repeat it as if courage itself is an offspring of memorization. But today, the teachers who preach have chosen not to be followers.  urlLink This heart pounding  piece from rediff tells you how cowardly these teachers have been in at the time of need.

       Oops , we did it again    In one of the most unprecedented blunders( whoa!!!) in reporting, NY Post on its July 6 issue ran an anchor story that President-to-be( I am an optimist and anti-Bush) Kerry had chosen Dick Gephardt( Dick-Who??) as his running mate.&nbsp;I am sure John Edwards isn't&nbsp;as amused as us&nbsp;.For guys who don't follow American politics, it is like reporting Sonia Gandhi has picked Govinda to lead the country. I am not comparing the credentials of Govinda and Gephardt but I am comparing the enormity of the blunders. Gephardt is no mean politician. He champions labor causes and also ran for the Democratic President ticket.   They made a similar error last year when they wrote that Red Sox won over the Yankees in the game 7 of the American League Championship series. Followers of baseball know that it was in fact the Yankees who won and not the Red Sox. I guess the reporter, editor wanted to go the Broadway show that night and decided that Red Sox would win as they were leading after 8 innings. How good it would have been had the Sox actually won, atleast Mr.Grady Little( Boston's coach)&nbsp;wouldn't have lost his coaching job.  &nbsp;  No newspaper blunder ever comes close to one of my favorites. This one would have made Chicago Daily tribune look like an idiot. They ran a headline in 1948 saying "Dewey Defeats Truman". History would tell you that it was actually the opposite that happened.  &nbsp;    urlLink "Post" Tabs Wrong Horse

       We are not Tata, Birla    This is a common lament amongst Indian middle class families comparing their lifestyles to rich Indian families.

       Hey! Teachers! Leave them kids alone!   My cousin is in middle school. He carries a pile load of books on his shoulders. He goes to school at 8 in the morning and comes back at 4. He has a shit load of homework to do. He does it until 8:00 and then goes to sleep. There have been days in his primary school when he had not been able to finish the homework due to their sheer volume and I have written some stuff for him in my left hand. Aren't schools supposed to be more fun and engaging???  Many schools have forgotten the old saying "All work and no play makes jack a dull boy". They are merely profit making organizations with an eye for edging out the other school in terms of academic results. Kids are being sacrificed in the deal. They are made to work harder than they can, beaten up for any small mistakes and some have even chosen to take the route of ultimate sacrifice in order to escape from the teachers.   The blame for some of the young kids commiting suicide not being able to cope up with these "concentration camps" also rests with the parents. All parents want their kids to become a doctor or an engineer and are not open to nuturing the talents of the kids. Pressure coupled with Punishment is not the best environment to grow up.   I hope the Government listens atleast to this   urlLink The Hindu Article-Terror in schools  and does something to enforce a stricter rule regarding the dominating and often "Nazi" like teachers.

       Jeff Murdock    A-Rated : Not recommended for conservative women, children and my mother :-)   Sometime in late 2002, we decided to watch something else other than Saturday Night Live on TV and we started watching a British Comedy on Channel 8. What a good change!!! The British Comedy happened to be "Coupling"- easily the most funniest thing that I have ever seen since Charlie Chaplin. America till then was obsessed with a certain dude named Joey but Jeff proved that Joey was not nearly in the same class.....The Giggle loop, even now I am wary of it when I am in a serious situation   Sharing Jeff's wisdom ( thanks to BBC)   "I mean, where exactly do you take your socks off? My advice is to take them off right after your shoes, and before your trousers. Thats the sock gap. Miss it, and suddenly youre a naked man in socks. No self-respecting woman will ever let a naked man in socks do the squelchy with her."   "Only an interview? What if I panic? You know, what if I say an accidental word... theres pressure, you know, the wrong word could just pop out of my mouth by accident... Nipples!"   "Oh, wouldnt that be great... being a lesbian. All the advantages of being a man, but with less embarrassing genitals."   "I need breasts with brains. I dont mean individual brains, obviously... I mean, not a brain each. You know, I like intelligent women, but youve got to draw the line somewhere... I think breast brains would be over-egging the woman pudding."   "You know, when I was a kid, I used to write the word 'naked' hundreds of times on a piece of paper, and then rub my face in it."   "This is the curse of Jeff Murdock. I meet the woman of my dreams and I cant take my trousers off."   "All of us in our time are visited by the Melty Man... Dont say his name, Patrick. Dont even think his name, or he will rise from the shadow dimensions to do his evil work inside your terrified pants."   "Steve, its a bad idea to actually count womens breasts. The whole bus stares at you."   "You know whats great about skirts? When a womans wearing a skirt, you know, you know, that somewhere in that room, shifting all the time, there is the VAA: the Visual Access Angle. A clear line of sight back to base camp."   "I am a prison for sperms. Those poor little tadpoles have been sentenced for life in Jeff Murdocks groin. And let me tell you, that can be a pretty lonely place."   "When God made the arse, he didn't say, 'Hey, it's just your basic hinge, let's knock off early.' He said, 'Behold ye angels, I have created the arse. Throughout the ages to come, men and women shall grab hold of these, and shout my name.'"

       Hail Thee Shane "O" Warne  "Warnie Warnie" was the chant, when one of my greatest supporters and best critc, Vani comes in thinking I was calling out for her and asks me to stop being so ecstatic about an Aussie cricketer. Shane Keith Warne- the synonym for controversy- has done it one more time. He equalled Muralidharan yesterday with his 527th wicket. It is incredible because he plays in Australia where the wickets are suitable to fast bowlers and he has a colleague in Glenn McGrath who has 435 wickets himself. Muralitharan plays in the sub continet where the pitches are more suitable to spinners and SriLanka don't have a genuine wicket taker other than him and to a lesser extent Vass. I never got to watch his ball of the century live but I watched the ball that bowled Basit Ali around his legs in Sydney, I don't remember the year maybe my brother does. I can still hear Richie Benaud in my ears  - "You wouldn't believe it, he has bowled him around his legs" .

       A Childhood Crush   Everytime I see Steffi Graf, it is almost like seeing an ex girlfriend. To say I adored her from 1987 through 2000 would be a shameful understatement. I simply revered her. I remember seeing her on the cover of Sportstar(my mom always bought it for me on Wednesdays ever since I began to spell) for the first time in 1987 when she won the French Open. It was love at first sight. I never missed a match of hers on Television in the good ol days of Doordarshan and I never missed a photograph of hers on Sportstar. There were always prayers on the days of her finals and the folks who knew me - knew Steffi and my unabashed love for her. I picked up fights supporting her and crazily even called Gunther Parche(the guy who stabbed Seles) a "patriot". Many a times during my adolescence I have dreamt of dating Steffi. Even now if Agassi ever changes his mind, I am there for you - STEFFI!!!!!   urlLink    Steffi Graf&nbsp; was inducted into the Tennis Hall of Fame yesterday urlLink

       Viva Las Vegas   "Cash Out, Cash Out" I screamed this morning while I was woken up. What a rude awakening- the pleasant dream was ruthlessly stopped by the screeching alarm clock which chose a jackpot moment to remind me that it was time to go to work.  I was having this glorious hangover of the Sin city.The realization- vacation over, back to work - left a sour taste in my mouth.  Las Vegas, where a temple for Shaguni( for modern day freaks, the guy who wanted to striptease Draupadi in Mahabharata)wouldn't be out of place, is a 9 hour drive from the San Jose- sanctum sanctorum of drudgery and monotony. We took off on Saturday morning after Maria Sharapova showed us more than her looks by winning Wimbledon. The car was gallantly racing up when it hit a road , the pace on which can only be matched by the classic sunday afternoon Doordarshan movie "Veedu"( Just as a clarification, this is the one which comes after the news for the hearing impaired on DD-1.). We dragged and drove and dragged and drove until we hit a free flowing road where I drove as I was in love with the police officer. I was consistently testing the speed radars with a minimum +10 over the speed limit. We reached Las Vegas finally after a tale of traffic jams, twilight zones, late start and missed exits.   Vegas is a city of dreams. I am sure the political activists who read it will be howling at me for admiring the undisputed capital of capitalism, but I cannot hide my appreciation for the creativity of men. Out of nowhere in a place where even Osama would think twice about living, comes a single strip of land which holds sway over everyone who comes across. The only road where you can find the Pyramid right across the street from the Eiffel Tower, gasp wide-eyed at the tall stratosphere and glance wide-mouthed at the dangerous yest seductive curves of  Women. If you dichtomize the pulchrititude of women across the globe as ones that are beautiful and ones that are sexy, Las Vegas will lead you to thousands belonging to the latter.  We hit the road, intrestingly named "Strip",  and visted "Bellagio"- the target of Ocean and his 11 men's nefarious plans. Bellagio was the nickname of one of my roomies at ASU and the similarity being their respective prosperities. From Bellagio, we hit the palace of a man who quite audaciosuly declared "Veni, Vidi, Vici" and lady luck took the form of Cleopatra to smile at me. I won at 25c slotting machine. I made 100 bucks there. In a fleeting moment of unadulterated egocentricity, I was already making plans to buy Caesar's palace and declare "Vandhen, Villayadinen, Vendraen". Joy was shortlived as I lost my $s to the machine, which like Monica Lewinsky, asked us to insert.   My luck was running out and so was my sleep. We stayed out till 5 in the morning and left to sleep as the sun slowly was waking up from his sleep. The next day began with a sumptuous meal at a multi-cuisine buffet where the number of desserts outnumbered the number of deserts in the world. Driving around in BMW Z4 like Lord Labbakku is everyman's afternoon dream after a good meal. I wanted to live the dream and decided to annex the BMW with a puny investment of $20. As a first installment for the money I put, I got to spin the wheel.. I spun and doubled my fortunes but the BMW reamined where it was.  After a few more spins, the BMW was still were it was. After a few more spins, the BMW was still where it was but my money wasn't where it was..  I hit the next casino and lost more. Just when I had given up, I hit the jackpot( in a poor man's parlance) in a relatively nondescrpit location - I don't even remember the name of the Casino. I made close to $150 and I decided to take it easy after that. Played easily throught the night, taking less chances. Aladin was the hotel I enjoyed most. I loved the artifical roofs, the spacious courtyards- it almost took me to the days when I used to play "Prince of Persia" religiosuly. I listened to some live music and slept in a friend's hotel room.    I slept for a little bit and woke up to get back to San Jose. A drive once again punctuated with heavy traffic, barren mountains, veggie burritos and late landings. The drive might have been tiring, the nights might have been long but the experience itself is priceless. Sorry  Master Card for borrowing your puncline.

       God Save Indian sports   urlLink One Billion people and one medal!!!!  It is that time of the decade again. India is sending a contigent to the Olympics. I am sure in a contigent of 70, 45 will be officials and 25 will be sportsmen. A fact that was noted and ridiculed by Jay Leno in faraway America. Our medal prospects lay in the hands of twenty people- Leander, Mahesh, Karnam Malleswari, hockey team and Anju Bobby George. Others are just pretenders, I would say. I am sure most of the Indian fans will not even recognize the last two as they don't get enough media attention. Indian Media and people always lap up the cricket like a pet son of a family. What they have done to the country is a sole World Cup in 1983 and a lot of empty promises. India would have been a much better overall sporting nation if we had spent all the money they spent for building better cricket stadiums from Kargil post to Gummidipondi, in building a better sports infrastructure. Now all we got to cheer about is a bunch of 15 jokers( include the reserves) who flatter to deceive all the time and laugh all the way to the bank endorsing everything from an underwear to a credit card. The situation is extremely pitiable when you think about a person like Anju Bobby George who won India's first medal ever(stress) in the World Championship of Athletics was struggling to find a sponsor for training in the Europe. When the circumstances are this lamentable, there are cricketers who move the Governemnt to get a tax break for a luxury car. What a gulf between one sport and the rest.   Anyways, I sincerely hope we come back with a few medals and Sunil Dutt( Munnabhai's father and if you dint know, Union Sports Minister) allocates a lion's share of money for sports other than cricket. I also have a brilliant and a radical idea of making the BCCI pay 80% taxes and leave them with just enough to run the sport in the country. Sounds like Tughlaqian isn't it?

      Ishtyle Statement  "He is a cheapo ya" commented one of the girls about me as I was trying to exchange glances with a goodlooking girl in Besant Nagar Beach. "Cheapo" - is this really English?? Nope- but who cares? Girls in Chennai use this all the time to describe guys who enjoy the pulchrititude of the women through sharp long glances.   urlLink Reading this piece in Hindu today , I wanted to say a few things about college "lingo". Most guys  in Chennai often use "Wassup? Machan" related closely to its cousin in English "Wassup Dude?". Most guys till 12th standard wouldn't have even heard the word "Machan". By most, I meant the really "fruit" ones who used to listen and really write down every single syllable that used to come out of the teacher's mouth. Two months later, the same fruit would have ripened and would be really using the "f" word as if he was the one who coined it. Reason: Ishtyle.   Coming from a school which was really an apology for a co-education environment, I was not sure about girls' lingo until I reached college. "Cho Chweeet"( In her majesty's language it translates to "So Sweet") exclaimed a girl the first time she saw me. I was already in the third rock from heaven but was quickly transferred to cruel earth when I realized that she was really refering to the dog which has on the huge billboard behind me. That day was the day I started hating two things. Cho Chweet and Dogs..Girls find everything from Street Dogs to Bill Clinton -"Cho Chweet" although both Clinton and Dogs have one thing in common with respect to women- they really lick as if you were "Cho Chweet".   The most outstanding lingo of all time has to be "Arre Yaar". My Hindi is as good as my Armenian but I have always got along with my Hindi speaking friends by interspersing my English sentences with "Arre Yaar".  Arre Yaar, What movies shall we go to? Arre Yaar!, Tendulkar is out. Hare Rama Arre Yaar Hare Krishna. I truly suspect whether most of the Hindi speaking "log" even know anything other than "Maine Kya Kaha!" " Tune Kya Kaha"  "Arre Yaar, Sab Gadubadu Ho Gaya" "Ok Chal Bye". Use these four sentences in permutations and combinations and you have groomed yourself into a Hindi dude.   What the f***, its 7, Arre Yaar got to go Yaar, Sab Gadubadu Ho Gaya yaar, this code is not "Cho Chweet". Whatever Ok Chal Bye...

       vi chennai.MEM   This weekend resembled Advani's rath yatra. The speed was hectic and the number of stops were more. Santa Cruz on Friday night, Livermore on Saturday morning, Big Sur on Saturday evening, Gilroy on Sunday morning... The theme was largely "beaches"  Being a Chennaite, I have a special affection for "beaches". Everybody from Chennai loves the beach, maybe because it is the only place where they can see Water. It is probably the only city in the world where water is as precious as Gold. A truly beautiful city with a long coastline. Chennai has to blame itself for its problems. The city had been with blessed with two water channels "Cooum" and "Adyar" which were polluted, spoilt and rendered useless by the inhabitants. Cooum might soon make it to the Thesaurus as a synonym for asphyxiation.  Coming back to the beaches, they always remind me of home. Its seems as if the approaching waves carry those long lost memories of Chennai. As I sit there in the sand watching those waves, nostalgia takes over. Those days at Beasant Nagar beach- when one cared more about masala peanuts and fountain Pepsi than record books and transmission lines; when we went to classes as a break from going to the beach; Your heart flutters for those glorious moments spent in the pavement of Besant Nagar beach. As I get up to go home, I see those waves go back in the same speed they came.   The Summer of 96.....
