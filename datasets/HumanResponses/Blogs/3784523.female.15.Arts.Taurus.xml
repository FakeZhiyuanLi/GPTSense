      So here I am...I can't believe I am doing this. ME! Of all people...using a blog server thingy...I usually just make them myself on my websites....but i am bored with alllll the html and stuff ness....I couldn't take it anymore. Plus this will be alot easier for me to do, just hop type up an entry and press publish. PERFECT for when school starts up again in the Fall. I just back from a cool trip up to the mountains in PA, a mountain called, Spicewood nect to a fourteen block long town called Renova. We don't take showers because there is no running water also meaning no toilets....EXCEPT FOR THE OUTHOUSE! I swear I think I hold it in whenever I'm up there....flies buzzing around you when your trying to "go" just isn't my fancy but I do love it up there. We go swimming in a cool creek and catch funnny looking newts...I wish I caught one...I would have named him Fig...like a Fig Newton....HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHA. Anyway. I am baby sitting right now and totally bored cuz the kids are out playing with there little rodent friends. My one other kid that IS here...IS SLEEPING! poor guy he ws up late last night puking his brains...ew. I am still in my PJs and probably should get dress....BUT I DUN WANNA!!!!! Well I'm going to go squeeze some hamsters...BYE.

      Maybe I shouldn't write my entries in the mounring because something happens by the afternoon and I forget it by the time I do get around to a next entry. This sucks. Devon somehow got her self in trouble an isn't aloud down during the week in Wildwood so I'll pretty much only have Sunday to spend with her but that won't even be a day. Sometimes I wonder if there is the forever cycle of good and bad. Once something really good comes long you have to brace yourself for the bad's slap. No, the whole thing about not being able to hang out with Devon isn't the slap but there are few things involved but have no connections with Devon. It has to do with a good friend of mine who I found has been cutting themself. I will not say my friends name but I will say I thought so much better of that person. I had thoughts that my friend would try cutting so I let them borrow a great Manga I own about this sort of thing. Its Confidentail Confessions Book 1. The first story is about a girl who contemplates suicide and it just totally deminishes the idea of cutting yourself and suicide. I thought that the idea would stick with my friend and they would get the point its sending across. But I think they got mixed signals and didn't get the idea. Maybe its my fault, maybe I shouldn't have given my firend the book in the first place. I thought it would help, but maybe it gave my friend the idea in the first place. My friend seems so angry but at what? Maybe its deeper then I'd like to look, my friend has a wonderful home life. Both parents together, even though the Dad is a bit of a raging Christian who doesn't trust his son enough to let him wear striped gloves or black nail polish. I believe if you hold the leash too close the og will just try harder to run. I wish I could say that but I don't want to seem as though I am questioning their abilities as parents but form my knowledge of watching my friends...the dog always ends up runnign out in the street like the owner feared int he first place. Freedom just a smidge of freedom might make the dog understand. I hate refferring to my dear friend as a dog.

        LaLaLa.  I am  so  frikkin' bored. Just sitting her at my Auntie's House. I like my cousins....When there actually entertaining  *DANCE MONKEY DANCE, buwahahahaha*   LMAO.  Anyway, nothing much is new. I think Ed is avoiding me but I'm sick of wasting my entries on him so  moving on . I have been having some writers block which  sucks  because I wanted to use my whole summer for writing so that I may have something to show my English teacher next year...But she might turn out to be my Theatre Arts Teacher  instead .  Damn.  I have to get the  worst  teachers. I really dislike her. She has like emotional overlfows, first she's your best friend then she'll do a 1-80 and be the  Wicked Witch of the West . She needs to take a chill pill, and finally by the end of the year I got sick of her and began giving her  "lip".  That's the first teacher I ever gave, "lip" to before.  Ew.  That didn't sound right, what I mean is snap back at her, but doing it in a  smart   way  as not to get sent down to the office. I'm hoping Devon has an adult shaperone for the  Warp Tour  so I can go, I have money finally so I can go. I would die if I could go, I know its just the Warp Tour but  I HAVE NEVER EVER EVER BEEN TO A CONCERT BEFORE! &nbsp; I'm  geek  so sue me. I took a personality quiz to prove it, I was hoping to get the  Fast Food Mascot  Personality but it turns out I'm a geek instead.  DAMN YOU FATE!  Anyway, I have an idea for a new webbie, alllll about online comics. You know,&nbsp;interviews with artists and such, mega list of links, reviews. You know all that  schnizzle . Well I'll probably get bored with it after awhile so I'll update you on that  pronto  next entry. Well, check you homies on the flip side,    PEACE IN THE MIDDLE EAST!       &nbsp;   BTW,  Visit  urlLink http://www.lowbright.com/ &nbsp;because the artist is kickass. I love his comics and he seems like an awesome person to know.  VISIT I SAY AND FALL IN LOVE WITH ITS GOOD-NESS!  Hey, he's one awards which he totally deserves I might add.

       Whats wrong?   &nbsp;  Thats what I wanted to ask  Ed  when I finally talked with him on the phone. He seemed so far away. Almost as though he didn't want to talk with me. I told him I miss him, but he was only silent. This  hurts , this hurts  really bad . He didn't get any sleep so he says, maybe that was it ?  It feels as though my stomach is  digesting  my  heart  and I'm getting massive  heart burn .   Whats going on?   I asked him that and he just said that everything is pretty  crappy . He is staying clean,  so he says  but everything is dirt. Why won't you tell me why it is  dirt?  Are you waiting for  me to ask?  This isn't  fair . What if this is nothing, then I go and make a big deal over nothing?  I don't care.    DO you have something to tell me?   Will you get the balls to tell? If your going to break up with me, then do it already. I'm sick of being  dragged  along.  I heard you thought I was going to break up with you. Could you still be thinking that? Even after I tried everytime when I was at my aunt's or father's to call you, after my night's of  insomnia  of hating myself for not getting ahold of you. How could you keep thinking that I wanna leave you after I said,  "I Miss You."   I don't know what it is. Maybe I do know and I just won't let you know. Maybe I am making  something  out of  nothing . Well whatever the  hell  it is, I want to know. I am not going to be dragged forever,  I'll dig my heels in the dirt sometime .  Sooner or later.   &nbsp;  I just noticed this turned into a letter to Ed more then a blog entry,  sorry . Just feeling a bit  depressed . I hate being depressed, nothing is ever color its always an array of&nbsp; shades of grey .  &nbsp;  If your looking for a luagh here....it ran away and won't come back till I give it some mash potatoes and cookies with ice tea. But you can find another laugh at this wonderfully draw and written online manga:  urlLink http://www.tea-club.net/index.html

      Six Flags was fun. Bought a cool Goodbye Kitty bag...I yikes it alot.  Dadummumumum ...I am  bored , but is that really surprising? Thats about the only time I do type in this blog...is when  I AM BORED . Babysitting right now,  of course . When am I not babysitting?  AHAHAHa , well I've been only babysitting my sister for a little while lately but now I'm babysitting my monster sis  AND  my crazy cousins. Anyway, did I say I got ahold of Ed yet? Yeah, I did...on AIM last week. I guess he was just tired or something, not that you can get emotion through AIM but it just seemed like I was more happy to see him then he was to see me. I am just being stupid right.  Atleast that is what Adam tells me, but Adam uses being stupid as an excuse all the time so you can never trust his judgement.  LMAO . Its just that when I worry about stuff its usually nothing but then when I don't worry about it usually as worse as it seems. I tried to call him again today,  no answer . I don't want to see like I'm stalking him so I only try calling once a day whenever I am at my aunt's or father's house. I don't want to be a clingy girlfriend, I just want to talk with my damn boyfriend.  WHY IS GAIA SO CRUEL TO ME??!!  The gods look to torture my existance, I guess they like my reactions too. I was told many times that people like to pick on me because my reactions are so funny. I guess I'm a good actress.  Wooowa, go me . I'm just stupid, oh wait....note today I pulled an  Adam Excuse . God save my soul, ew, I heard God likes  Crystal Pepsi .  Oh yesh before I forget. The old boring Alice is going to the garbage bin because she gets her ass kicked by the manga:  urlLink A Sorta Wonderland  and its uber cuteness.  LOVE IT I SAY!

      Sooo much to do...soooo much time. HA! thought I was going to say so little time, didn't?! DIDN'T YOU?! Well actually I didn't maybe I should have but every secodn my mother doesn't call me back someone gets hit by a car. And thats not good. She needs to call me back so i can smooth out the details for me going to my fatehr's then from there to my friend Adam's but thats not until i am done with my dad's. I am going to Six Flags with Adam and his family. I am not much of a rides person but it'll be nice to see Adam again. I'll be able to give him his Sheep X-ing sign. I am bored. Where is my cousin Robbie...I need to annoy him. My life is incomplete if I am not annoying someone. Maybe I jump in a chat rooma and start annoying someone. Thats sounds fun but then I dun wanna annoy someone i don't even know. I was thinking while laying in my and eating milano cookies in my pjs this mourning and I was thinking about Ramen flavors and which ones are the best. I personally like Beef and Creamy Chicken the most.  I was also wondering what flavor exactly is "Oriental"? Is it like the taste of asian people? If so, then if you eat that stuff are you considered a...cannibal? EW! I AM A CANNIBAL?! Thats not right.... :( I don't want to be a cannibal. I use to wanna be a clown but not a cannibal. Oh where, oh where is shadow? Oh where, oh where, oh where is shadow? Where can shadow be? Kisses.  This is my new blogchalk:   United States, New Jersey, Woodbine, English, Samantha, Female, 13-15, Manga, Writing.   :)

      Well, I am back from my father's house. I had lotsa fun, and tried to contct Ed but still no answer at his household...I am  feeling even worse. I miss him uber lots...:( I went to the boardwalk alot when i was at my father's. Sunday I was watching my friend Devon do DDR and this guy just walks over and stands next to me. So he is standing their and I watching him from the corner of my eye because I can see he keeps looking at me. So Devon's bag is getting heavy (i have to hold it because i don't play DDR) and he reads the back of my shirt that says, "This is my back" When I turn back he leans over and says, "When I read your shirt it made me feel stupid." I laughed. He was like........hitting on me? Atleast thats how my friend put it because she was listening the whole time as she was breaking down on the DDR machine. I was flattered and that was it, but I like Ed better. Although the guy gets points for courage. Those DDR games are so cool. I tried it a few times but it just isn't for me, i like watching better. I watched a guy play on both dance panel things. It was awesome! I might try it again, maybe it will be my cup of tea this time around. I change my interests too much. Lik my favorite color changes atleast once a month. I wear out new hairstyles then stay up late looking for a new one. Yes, that is me and i am done rambling.  You are the weakest link...GOD-BYE

YaY, well its great cuz I get to see my dad whom I haven't seen in like two months and  DEVON! YEAH DEVON!  *does a happy dance* Well anyway its going to be great! I feel so bad, Ed (my boyfriend) should dump me! I am the worst girlfriend... I DON'T DESERVE HIM!  I'm horrible, I aven't spoken to him in like... I DON'T KNOW HOW LONG!!!  Isn't that horrible, please flame and curse me off. I have been trying to get a hold of him but the only time I can do that is at my aunt's house when I baby sit, because at my house we don't have long distance.  AND I'M SO BUSY CHASING THEM ROTTEN RODENTS AROUND I FORGET TO CALL HIM , then when I do no one answers...or it's busy. I'll when I'm at my dad's house but Ed is usually never home on the weekends.

      LALALALA! Its about ten minutes til 9am and I am bored as...well a board. Well at the moment no one is on my buddy list...except for my cousin's friend Bill but he isn't an original buddy of mine...so he no count. LALALA. That's such a fun song to sing. LALALALa. I am babysitting today, of course. That is what my whole summer will be filled with...my cousins and my lil' sis...DRIVING ME CRAZY! Still no idea on what my new AIM name shall be...NO ONE IS HELPING! Peopel were sleeping, the children I mean...till I got bored and sat on then and jumped on their beds till they woke up. They're still boring, my youngest cousin mark is crying to his mother on the phone cuz he has to do chores. Sometimes I just want to smack him. He is soooo annoying, he asks way to many questions and some are ju st not important. I get to see my friend, Devon. This weekend when I go to my father's, she lives next door. Well technically she doesn't live there because she only comes down on weekends and in the summer but I still say she lives there. Because well, she eats, sleeps, and "goes" there. She is so much fun. If devon were male, I would have snatched her up years ago...its sucks she is two years younger then me...because then I would be considered (by other teens) a pedifile. And well people are sick, because devon is awesome and I'd marry her if she were male! Or I'll take her female, but I don't swing that way baby. YAY! BABY!. *cough* that was my other personality who likes to copy, Austin Powers.. YAY, Mike Myers.

      Wow, heard alot of stuff about Ed. Nto goign to get into it but I will say. I still haven't cried. Sory Ed, but I didn't fall to pieces because "you broke up with me". Actually, I broke up with you, unless you missed that part. Oh and prude is actually considered a compliment you ignorant arrogant lying ass monkey. All becaus eI didn't have sex with you, I consider that a good thing. So farewell to that part of my life. Toodles and moving on....  I went to WARPED TOUR! It was so fucking awesome! Argh, there were so many hott guys with mohawks and piecings (drools) there was even this guy with those black square rimmed emo glasses who talked iwht me...(love sigh). The bands kicked ASS and I got a hella bunch of free stuff! I really loved this one band called Opiate For The Masses, they were the BEST! I screamed out to the lead singer after he took his shirt off, to take his pants off....and....HE DID! He was singing in his underoos for the last song! I also got the shoe he threw off stage...lol...I named it Todd. YEAH!  I am feeling so great and excited for the next year of High school. I went to see my "girlfriend" yesterday and wished her happy brithday. you see Amanda and I have had this year long joke that we are dating. Turthfully we are not but we are just good friends we like to say we are...some very stupid people even take us seriously, but that might be because I've licked whipped cream and cake icing off her chin.....lmao. I am so stoaked to be a sophomore! I'm not going to be an icky sophomore, I'm going to be nice to the new fresh batch of freshies. Because at one point I was a freshman too, I think alot of people foret that.
