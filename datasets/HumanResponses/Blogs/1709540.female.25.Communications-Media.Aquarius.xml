       i'm in ocean city maryland, a place that elicits a groan from most normal mid-atlantic residents.  actually i find it kind fun.  although i'd find it much more fun if i wasn't stuck in a hotel room with family, who deem it the only answer to the rain--instead of seeing movies, playing indoor golf, walking around with umbrellas.... i mean, it's not like it's a monsoon or blizzard, it's just not good tanning weather.  i'll write more on this later.  unfortunately my usage is being clocked and timed at a little place on 7th and philadelphia avenue (i think) and being the paranoid individual i am, as well as the broke individual i am, i'm going to sign off.    no im here either!  man!  what is the world coming to!?  thank god for text messaging.

       well the bust finally came through today... no more IM/MSN messenger for us at work b/c of "complaints" about "chat rooms".  ahhh the lingo of the computer illiterate.   "but officer!  i'm not in a chat room!"  oh well.  i'm not going to argue technicalities with them.   my problem with the situation is this.  my 9-to-5, at times, provides me with more free time than i know how to manage.  thus, messanger is ideal.  plan my night, catch up with friends, less intrusive than yakking on the phone...  and i'm not talking about when there is work.  when i'm on deadline, when i have projects, when i have actual work... any of my IM buddies will tell you that there's an away message posted or better yet, i'm just not on at all, when i actually have work.  even minor amounts of work.  so either give me more to do or quit yer bitchin'!  and there's always email.

       so this is my first attempt at this sort of thing.... rather voyeuristic... like screaming out entries from your own diary over the screen in times square... though i don't know how much of an audience i'd have...  i'm 24. i live in washington, d.c., where i grew up... yes i am one of those all-elusive natives.  i am not involved in politics.  i think i'm a writer.

       after getting back to the apt late last night, i park in a rush hour spot.  in DC, rush hour spots mean you better move yo' ass during the hours of 7 am and 9:30 am, or 4:30 pm to 7 pm, cuz you'll get towed otherwise.  but so i park there vowing to be up early to move le vehicle.  so at 7:30, after a totally sleepless night, i'm in the shower, and i'm thinking well at least my commute is shorter today.  and then i remember i was supposed to move my car.  i throw on clothes, don't put in contacts, don't comb my hair, and run outside.  my car is not there.  i realize i better start walking to the metro before i'm late to work.    so once at work, with wet hair, no makeup, and sweaty as hell, i call the DMV.  oh yeah, we just moved your car around the block.  apparently this is pretty standard practice.  me, being the idiot that i am, did not know this.  so i grab a cab with my last $7 and go to my car.  there it is!  with a big fatty ticket for towing costs.    so, at least happy that my car hadn't been hurt, stolen, destroyed or further fined, i drive on to work.  some banker-type corporate asshole in a boxter keeps cutting me off and making kissy faces at me.  so i flick him off.  my karma ratings are so low today.  question of the day:  if i need a "sleeping aid," will my health insurance company pay for red wine?

       ok, so yesterday i have my weekly dr's appt.  mention to him i'm stressed/anxious and not sleeping all that well.  this can be troubling b/c when i stop sleeping it tends to wind me up into a manic phase.  he gets out his pen to write an rx for a "sleep aid" so i don't go into hyperdrive.  i stop him b/c well past experiences and stuff.  now here's my question:    a) is he the idiot for wanting to prescribe me sleeping pills   or   b) am i the idiot for turning down possibly fun drugs?     (sigh.  sane adulthood is  no  fun.)

       well i have no clue as to how i'm still awake right now, but i am.  i'm at work.  it's dull.  i'm feeling better today, i suppose.  making progress on the grad school fiasco, takin' names, planning trips... all with a bank balance of $-163.  go me!  i rule!  and surprisingly i didn't spend any of that on shoes, booze (er, well), or massive quantities of lip gloss tubes from wal-mart.  some  urlLink humor for ya  courtesy of the onion.

       ever have the feeling you just want to throw yourself from wall to wall in a room?  like a ball hit perfectly by the cue held by someone with a nonshaky hand?  well too bad i got those shaky hands... still wanna just run and slam myself into things to maybe get it all outta me.  this is why people cut themselves.  to feel, to realize, to come back into their bodies.  i've got the tunnel vision right now, from outside of my head looking into my head thru my eyes, like the being john malkovich sensation.  shit there are somedays that i really wish my meds would work.  you know, there's this whole sensation of "i'm ashamed, oh the stigma", well you know what--FUCK THAT.  you're reading this and maybe you don't know me, or maybe you do.....and i don't care.  maybe this comes as a shock or maybe you knew it all along.  whatever it is, yeah.  mental illness sucks.  yeah i'm on meds for misfiring neurons, and you know what?  i wish the hell they worked right now.  otherwise i'm REALLY going to have a manic monday.  i'm a fully functional individual but i have my bad days (and my too good days).    so deal with it.    i have to.

       or me.  yesterday i successfully managed to have my feet shoot out from underneath me while nagivigating granite stairs to the parking garage in my building, and slide--or rather bump--down about 7 steps.  i think i've broken my ass.  does this mean i get painkillers for life?  this is not an unusual occurance.  while recently having lunch with a friend at a house office building (that's capitol hill/Congress for you non hill rats), i managed to fall down some marble steps.  that time i didn't bruise my ass, but isntead bruised my shin so that it was black and blue and purple and yellow for a good two weeks.  my yoga teacher thought i was being beaten.  and on a daily basis, my big buddy sam laughs at me for being unable to walk without tripping over my own feet.  i must be developmentally challenged.  i think i need a helmet.  why can't i ever trip into a padded room?  i suppose i could if i really put my all into it.  hmm.  i'll leave the levels of meaning up to y'all.  sigh.  spent last night chowing down on seafood and then out on a boat on the severn river with some good company.  that was a lovely break from the crazy world of science policy... and  urlLink oysters ...

       um, something about holes? Not having one?  I dunno where i was taking this anyhow!  I've been working overtime lately, so no updates until now.  Put some poetry on my website, would love some feedback.  Even bad feedback, as long as there are helpful hints in there.  You know, I'm really sick of people telling me how useless an MFA in creative writing is.    NO SHIT  .  Anyone who knows me knows that I'm doing it to write for two-to-three years uninterrupted.  And I know that too.  But if I have to explain one more goddamn time to someone who doesn't get it... I mean, could you just not ask?  I do have a list of 30 schools right now that I need to narrow down, so stop wasting my time.  But seriously, how many "starving artists" do you know who claim to be writers and artists and actually aren't because they're too tired from their "easy" job that they took so that they would have time to write!?  Granted there are a lot of people out there who do that route and succeed, but I have motivation and discipline issues, apparently.    Sigh.  Good shit of the day:  urlLink Antibalas   urlLink Indie Hipster Bingo

       there is one thing that i've learned in my wisdom, and it is to never bullshit a bullshitter.  i've been swallowing bitter pills since god knows when and every time i take with a smile and say, well better luck next time, old girl!  there's no better luck next time and there's not going to be a next time.  if for one moment i actually looked out for myself rather than just going with the flow, i might actually be able to keep my head above water.  everyone always says they want someone who goes with the flow, but going with the flow means drowning.  i'm sick of excuses and i'm sick of people.  yes, people.  not "people who..." but "people."  the only good news that i've got today is that another one of my friends (an old friend from h.s. who i recently just got back in touch with) just got engaged and i'm very happy for her--and her fiance better know he's the luckiest man alive!

       not a totally unproductive day.  broken ink met for the first time.  excited to meet the new people and see work of people i already knew.  left the house after 24+ hours without electricity, cable tv/internet or clean water. took a shower at work.    fairfax is still under a boil order except my family keeps insisting that the water's fine.  i am so about to go straight up ocd on everyone's ass.    of course the really great thing is that i can tell i'm being paranoid (or else everyone really does hate me) because i'm getting twitchy.  even better, my shrink's on vacation beginning tomorrow, for four straight weeks.  apologies all around in advance or for past damage.

       damn, kiddies... even NPR is having trouble broadcasting!  i got the day off since the feds closed and my NON GOVERNMENTAL ORGANIZATION (we are not the feds, donkies--ooh hanging around AJ too much--get it through your mind).  my grandmother is nervous and my mother has holed herself up in her room studying.   me, i'm writing.  funny, i'm writing a piece for class my nonfiction writing class on anorexia in older women.  that's not what's funny, what's funny is that i'm writing about the storm i experienced when my mother was sick--because whoever thinks that eating disorders are only for 13 yr olds who read too much Cosmo is wrong--in the middle of a storm.  it's really difficult.  the research part comes naturally, a part of that good ol' journalist training.  research, report, analyze and spew it back.  but the personal aspect is difficult still to get out.    and the thought of interviewing my mother about it scares the fuck out of me.  LINKS--please use them if you or someone you know has an eating disorder (or thinks that something with the way you eat isn't right).   urlLink http://www.anad.org    urlLink http://www.nimh.nih.gov/publicat/eatingdisorder.cfm    urlLink http://www.nationaleatingdisorders.org

       ahhh time out.  it was supposed to be a bad thing, really.  when you were all of four, cranky and feeling frustrated, you pushed another toddler or threw a toy at someone else.  and what would happen?  you'd get time out.  sit by yourself until an adult comes back, all in the name of thinking about "what you did."  (this is at least what happened in my household and preschool.)  but to have a whole 30 minutes.... lovely and amazing.... all to yourself.  and nap time.  mmm nap time.  and juice and cookies.  it seems to me that so many people are on edge right now.  people are snapping at each other, doing stupid things, and just being shitty.  (myself very much so included).  dunno if its the hurricane, the war that supposedly doesn't exist, or what, but i think everyone (including myself) needs to take a big friggin TIME OUT.    starting....    NOW.

       so i'm reading back thru my entries, wallowing, etc., and i see that i wrote an entry on Sept. 11, not even thinking about how that time two years ago I couldn't find several of my close friends or my just-broken-up ex boyfriend because all the phone lines were down from here to nyc, or how i couldn't sleep for days, or how i saw a plane go down in my rearview mirror thinking it was landing at the airport and a few seconds later heard a crash.  my self loathing is reaching new depths.

       it's about the ex girlfriends.  i manage to put myself in bad positions alot.  (on my back, maybe?)  but seriously, i need to stop trusting people again.  so many old friends are totally out of the picture now and i keep thinking i'm meeting new and wonderful people that will be in my life forever--not even romantically just as fixtures, as figures, as important characters in the novel that is my life--and then i am shocked and overwhelmed when i realize i'm dreaming.  always always dreaming and so convinced that someday i'll be proven that the world IS a good place and that everything WILL work out ok.... and yet i still have no proof of it ever.    i'm just a wisp of grey matter in someone else's mind, a short term memory.  stupid stupid stupid.

       damn for a writer i really tend to be at a loss for words sometimes.  i'm feeling totally fucked.  i have work (which is no longer--thankfully--the cushy shit job i used to have--must actually use brain), class, applications, fines, fees and taxes (thanks DMVs of both DC and VA!), trips i'm supposed to go on but looking unlikely, familial duties (slave labor) and somewhere abouts this part i'm supposed to be sleeping and having a life of my own.    oh wait, this   is   my life.    now a note, before anyone jumps on me for bitching, and how lucky i am and how i should count my blessings--get yer own blog.  i'm stressed, mfr's.    get it?!    only bright spot:  finally received my copy of kelly cherry's  rising venus .  damn there is some fucked-up-ed-ness in there.  and i love it.  at least i'm not the only one feeling lost.

       Ok, so let’s try this again.  I just wrote this great blog entry and I was signed out and it was all deleted.  Fuckin’ a.  So this week shall officially be known as “this is your life, the week” (as opposed to The Movie, or The Made For TV Movie, or The Tell All Book).  Let me explain.  Wednesday night I was out with a “nice young man.”  (Hello nice young man!)  Driving home, my phone rings.  Now, as a general rule, I never answer numbers I don’t recognize.  Could be that paranoid thing.  Could be that prior experience with stalkers thing.  Anyhow, I answer it on a whim.    Turns out to be someone I was romantically involved with in the beginning of the summer.  For me, it was a fucking junior high style crush.  Couldn’t sleep, couldn’t eat, couldn’t breathe, couldn’t think.  And as much fun as that is, and as rare as it is, I knew that because it was a crush, I would   get   crushed.  In the end (of course) it didn’t work.  He had his shit and I had (have) mine.  He moved elsewhere.  Hadn’t heard from him, and in the grand tradition of men in my life, was not expecting to hear from him.  And to my credit (in my opinion), I let it go.  So when I answered the phone, I just about slammed on the goddamn breaks on I-395 South.  Totally shocked.  We talk for a while, catch up on things, say we’ll keep in touch and all is cool.  I go study some, read some and go to bed.  It isn’t until the morning that I fully realize how nice it is to have one chapter (no matter how short or small) fully closed and moving on to the next.  But wait!  There’s more!  Last night, I meet up with my cousins Laura and  urlLink Nick , Nick’s girlfriend Emily, and Laura’s friends Cara, Nicole and Shahara.  I was thrilled to see Nick and meet Emily, and hang out with Laura since our schedules don’t often match, but when I saw Nicole and Cara, my heart sunk.  Nicole, Cara and Laura and I went to high school together.  They were the “it” girls, I was the “nerd” girl.  We were those great and wretched stereotypes to the Nth degree.  Suddenly I was 15 again and I didn’t know which way to run.  But I keep telling myself it’s different—I’m different, they’re different, it’s nearly 10 years later!!  And so, through dinner, I begin to realize that my cousin and her friends, like me, have changed.  People calm down, toughen up, grow into their skins and keep moving forwards.    I think sometimes people get stuck in their own heads—mainly because I know I do—and it’s not a case of being selfish, but just of not being actively engaged in their perception of others.  Faith in humanity sometimes goes a bit beyond faith alone and proves itself to you in unexpected ways.

       the theme song would have been "soul vibration" by the dining rooms.   (see hi fidelity lounge, vol 3 and that beer commercial where the pretty boy and the hot girl get it on in the elevator.)    (no i did not get it on in an elevator.)  my music director would have also included some built to spill, modest mouse, lamb, and the roots.  definitely the roots.  ok enough random thoughts from my mind, which is currently all over the place--the only thing i can concentrate on is the law and order marathon, and laundry.  my god.  the laundry is great.  and mighty.  and skeeery.  in the past 72 hours i have drunk more than i have since my last trip to nyc, most of it wine, which makes me happy, eaten at my fav. restaurant, ogled pretty boys at the new H&M, drunk dialed (twice), confessed bipolarity to more people than i have in several months, stayed up waaaaaaaaaaaay late/early and slept in waaaaaaaaaaaaaay later, and made some new friends.     i also got to play clean up where a ceiling in my grandmother's house collapsed due to  a leaky pipe.    and supposedly i studied for the GRE.   and that's the general round up.   CDs of necessity that i ordered today after realizing my life was less than complete without them:   urlLink High Fidelity Lounge Vol 3   urlLink Liz Phair, Whip-Smart  (before she sucked)   urlLink Ash, 1977 (essential--lost my original copy)    Books also:   urlLink Kelly Cherry: Rising Venus   urlLink Lynn Emanuel: The Dig and Hotel Fiesta   urlLink Best American Magazine Writing 2002   urlLink The Elements of Style, Strunk and White

       who stabs themselves?  what anger, what torment did this sad sad soul have within him?  it's not the conventional anger of slashing one's wrists, or the fuck you of a gunshot to the head, or the gothic terribleness of hanging, or the overdone overdose that never really works.    who stabs themselves?   in the heart?

       there's an email address on  urlLink sweet adeline  where you can send his friends and family messages.  i wrote them this:  part of me feels like who the fuck am i to send you condolences, but i have been following elliot smith ever since i left the movie theatre and couldn't stop thinking about the scene in good will hunting where the guys are driving home from boston late at night.  "what is that song?!"  and i didn't rest until i found it.  the more i read about elliot smith the more i appreciated not only his talent but his struggle.  i'm one of the lucky ones who found a combination of meds that worked to stabilize my demons, but i know how he feels.  and i know how much it hurts.  i saw him play live at traxx nightclub in charlottesville, va in 2000.  i wept during the show because it was the most beautiful thing i had ever heard.  he had the most angelic voice.  i will keep you all (his friends and family) in my thoughts and prayers.  i know it doesn't make the pain go away but i hope it helps everyone realize just what an impact he made on the world while he was here.  love,  heather mcd

       I'm well on my way....  I've sent out my first major draft of what will end up being most likely my first major piece for editing from past and present friends and respected editor types.  I'm getting positive feedback but I would rather someone kick my ass than get wrapped up into the matter.  I'm a sucker for abuse.    I was really stunned though that my one friend wrote back:  "I like your sense of immediacy, and the fact that you're not sentimentalizing it.  Straight up.  Intense."  Coming from he who christened me "Future" and while the king of b.s. hates it as well.... well I take it to heart.  Thanks F la P.  I have a feeling that in the end, no matter what I write, I may well be thrown out of the house.  (All donations of monetary value are welcome, as well as couches to sleep on if this does indeed happen).  Or else my life will be made very very difficult.  For the first time my words are not cloaked in beautiful vague poetry or lost in the dance inside my head that passes as fiction.  (Not, however, that those are never appropriate... sometimes those forms are.... but this, well, I couldn't make this shit up, so why try?)  And, for the first time, I have crossed some serious-ass boundaries with the family... which is a lot less scary than I thought.  I don't quite feel guilty, but I do feel something... some strange sense of ablution and damnation all rolled into one.

       this rant is said laughingly though partially not so.  the whole situation is so ridiculous i cannot do anything but laugh.    i got my gre scores and essay rating back last night.  first of all, they screwed up the score sheet and failed to include my score from the first time i took it.  secondly, i apparently write better than only 28% of the population.  i wrote an essay on steinbeck, radiohead and gigli.  i doubt any of the population could do that.    let's see:  i am an intelligent person.  i am a solid writer.  and some test score is supposed to tell an admissions counselor that i a) dropped nearly $500 on taking it twice, bounced check fees (hey i was po' last year), a review course; b) studied my fucking ass off while working full time, taking a class and running my own business and c) that i am old beyond my years and have more stories than his washed-up, dried-out, draggedy ass could ever imagine no matter how much acid he dropped in his hippy days?!  you know what's stupid?  how much time and energy i spent on your goddamn test.  FUCK ALL OF YOU!  damn you, absurdist playwrights!!!  and damn you, ETS!   urlLink OH GODDAMMIT!!!

       why is john keats so damn amazing?    last night i read  urlLink j.t. leroy 's fucking amazing jaw dropping book  urlLink  the heart is deceitful above all things  .  and i realized yet once again i have no room to complain about life.  go read it!  now!  it is nothing less than stomach churning, jaw dropping and pain inducing and i love it.  today in my pathetique orphan-like way, i decided to take a nice long walk at lunch, go visit a friend at work and buy books of poetry, lovely old books of poetry, and then i realized that the flower man was still at his spot on 21st and P.  the flowerman to me is legendary.  he is always out there.  he is ruddy faced and white haired and has a rather unplaceable generic european accent.  he has gorgeous perfect flowers.  and, while they are not inexpensive, he will usually cut you a break now and again.  today he asked me where i was off to.   "back to work, i'm on my lunch break."  "why are you working today!?  today is holiday!"  "but you're working too!"  he laughed, gave me a great big hug and kiss on the cheek and gave me a red carnation with the stem trimmed short so i could wear it behind my ear or put it on the inner edge of my purse.  and now i have three lovely pink stargazer lilies in my office that are fragrant and just downright lovely.  another note.   urlLink jeff  told me that the blogger-generator banner on my site was advertising help for schizophrenics.  tee hee.

       135 pages down the drain..... hundreds, mebbe thousands of MB.   computer froze.  5 days' work scrambled.  down the drain.  originally due tomorrow and THISCLOSE to being done.  my brain has just short circuited.  car accident yesterday.  minor.  no one hurt, just a pain in the ass, and my fault to boot (sorry to complicate your life ms. 1992 toyota corolla, 34th and mass ave.,  if you're reading this.)  i am oh so very very very very very very tired.  and i am sorry, poet, if you are reading this, for not showing at your party or your reading tonight.  how very uncouth.  and disrespectful.    the autopilot has called in for permission to land.... roger.

       and some bowls of chicken noodle soup, I've ended the pity party.    I'm definitely sick, have the office cold, but I went out and just bought two issues of The Believer, and one issue each of Vogue, Paste (holy shit what a promising magazine), and the special edition Q on Radiohead.  And finally, I bought De Stijl.  The low fi and blues + punkness of it all may be aggravating my sinus headache but fuck it.  It rocks.  The Beatles were wrong.  All I need is rock, not love.  Back to writing.    Oh wait, a quick aside.  So someone quite close to me yesterday said, "But why would any of these schools accept you?" in reference to me applying to ninetymillion MFA programs.  That comment was right up there with the time I was told I was proof that the Pill is no guarantee against pregnancy.  I love the appearance that these statements are merely factual evidence, not the cruel unnecessary comments that they truly are.  Wolfie, it's hard to hide the blood running down the side of your mouth even when in a sheep's costume.

       while i try not to fall asleep and/or vomit.  thanks.  the GRE is over, may we all rejoice that i'm amongst the living once more.  well not really.  i bombed it.  now that everything is computerized, you cannot go back and change your answers, a rule i find unnerving.  and also now that it is computerized, i actually do know that i bombed it, and that it's not a case of "maybe you'll do better than you thought."  no.  i didn't.  i scored a significant amount of points less than when i took it last year, while clinically exhausted, slightly manic, and just a wee bit hungover.  my only redemption at this point is that some essay reader will be amazed at my unbelievable seamless weaving of Steinbeck, Radiohead and Gigli into one soundly reasoned essay.  or not.  then last night i met up with the usual suspects and drank at the black cat.  again tried my hand at playing pool while an ever patient megan tried not to laugh  too  hard at me messing up.  ah, home sweet home.  everyone bailed on the early side, which had i a brain i would have done too.  instead i end up eating burgers w/  urlLink jeff  at the diner at 1:30 in the morning.  mmm.  burgers. and really good french fries.  that wouldn't be so bad on a weekend, but right now i'm sleepy and my stomach feels kinda funny to say the least.  upwards and onwards... my office RULES.  maybe i can shut the door and take a nap later.

       it's been awhile.  hi everyone.  i think i'll rewrite this later, but i'm seeing more absurdity in my life.  things i have learned and/or remembered in the past 24 hours  1) wine beer and liquor do not mix--ever, not even in small amounts.  2) my grandmother wants to put me in detox and my mother is not speaking to me.  3)  red lobster, a terrible restaurant by any means, is ten times worse when you are hungover, unable to eat anything especially fishy thingies, and when your family will not speak to you but they still insist you go with them.  4) seeing live lobsters and breaking apart crab claws makes my stomach turn on even a good day, but today even more so.  MAN I NEED TO GET THE FUCK OUT OF HERE.

       John sent me the link to  urlLink  fish on Prozac  .    So take that Kirstie Alley!  You probably already have the meds in you anyways!  Seriously though, I wonder if this will affect people who shouldn't have various medicines.   For example, if you take  urlLink MAOIs  (though not many people do these days), you're not supposed to take  urlLink SSRIs .   But, if someone on an MAOI ingests enough fish/water/whatever that has traces of Prozac (an SSRI), will it interact?  Hmm.  Gotta lessen my sushi intake before I have trace elements of Thorazine in me.

         urlLink Jeff Conlin  wrote me this today.  1.  Jeff rules.  2.  He introduced me to Smithwick's last night.  But for reals, here's his response:   Saw your blog post from today.   Looking at Phelps' website [ hmcd's note: site edited out--i want no links from my blog directly to his site counter ] he actually has an entire debate session with John Rankin posted.  I met Rankin in college... right about the time I gave up on "church"  but not theology. Unbelievable speaker... nothing but intellect and  logic... yet a dead-on 100% Gods word kind of Christian apologist.  One of the social-shelter campus ministries brought him in for an  open talk/debate under the auspices of promoting cross-theological  awareness... they threw him softball fake arguments to debate which  he wound up throwing right back in their faces and making them look  like idiots... without them knowing. It was incredible.  Anyway, it's a hard listen... Phelps is just an evil man, period...  but the sessions where Rankin is using nothing but logic and  scripture to show more or less that God loves all creation, and  Phelps is babbling on and claiming that Rankin is making ad-"HOMO- nem" arguments is pretty entertaining, if not depressing.  To answer the "where does this hate come from" question you pose...  at one point, Rankin alludes to the same thing...  John : In 1988 at Harvard, three women classmates once approached me  during lunch. They said they were lesbian, and that every lesbian  they knew had been physically, sexually or emotionally abused as  girls. When I heard this, I prayed in my spirit, "Dear God above,  does the church know this testimony, or do we just condemn?"  Now, speaking as a man, a husband and father, I ask any father here  today: How would you respond if you learned years later that your  daughter had been so abused, and thus turned to lesbianism out of the  fear of men? Would you look at her, and say, "God hates you, you  dirty hell-bound faggot?" Or would you wrap your arms around her in  protective love and seek to minister to her wounded soul? How much  more does our heavenly Father love all his children, the sons and  daughters of Adam and Eve... One final, simple question. Fred, what  are the influences in your life that have led you to believe, speak,  and act as you do?  Fred: Are you trying to hurt the feelings of my thirteen children?  John: I asked you an honest question. You can ask the same question  of me.  Fred: Are you trying to get personal?  John: In an honest way, yes.  Phelps then makes a passionate "God called me to when I was ordained"  excuse and that's that... but it's not too hard to figure out.    urlLink  transcript only       urlLink audio    What's really amazing is that Phelps put it up on his website... as  if it was a victory for him.   Thanks for the info Jeff.

        urlLink Monument From Hell - Make room for a Matthew Shepard hate monument in a town square near you. By Emily Bazelon    While I said I wouldn't be blogging as much, it's a slow day here and this news from Slate.com sickens me, especially after the  urlLink Law & Order SVU  I saw last night (Season 5, Episode E4410 "Abomination").     Where does this kind of hate come from?  It's beyond ignorance and beyond religion and beyond anything I've ever encountered.  More and more it seems to be that just because people disagree with an issue or a characteristic or ANYTHING, it gives them fuel for hatred.  Not dislike, not general disdain, not even indifference...but full on flames-of-hell wrath.  Even something as simple as smoking.  On the  urlLink Ban the Ban blog , some of the pro-ban people's messages directed at smokers are downright offensive.  I perfectly understand why some of my friends support the ban, and we choose to disagree.  But hating someone because they light up?   Please!   It's like hating someone because they are from the South, or because they choose to wear purple, or they have body piercings.  I'm not saying smoking is good for you--no one is arguing that--but I'm not saying you should be gay, or that you should do or not do anything...  I don't know what I'm saying anymore.  I'm just incredibly sad for the world right now.

        has always amazed me, at least from afar.    Up close, it seems, is another matter entirely.  I seem to be suffering from acute myopia.  Like most people who are near sighted, if I don't wear my glasses, I can do everything from trip and fall while walking, to crash cars and kill people.    Several private (and not so private) incidents of late have lead me to some radical self-evaluation.  Until today, these incidents seemed rather lacking in relationship to one another, but after some serious consideration, I think they are linked indeed.  I've been on a crash course with myself a lot lately, not solely in Internet-related ways, and I'm digging my heels in here, before I end up alienating everyone I know or ended up on a tile floor somewhere (both have been known to happen).  My life especially lately has been spent in front of a computer screen.  I am constantly accessible via instant messanger, school, work and personal email addresses, listserves, Friendster, and other means (like my cell phone).  While the Internet is a great way to stay in touch, stay informed and stay on the ball, I also think that these things have overwhelmingly taking precedence in my life--rather than say, living said life.   More and more I research causes, people, events and everything else online, and simply out of ease.   I affiliate myself with these "links."  They become less and less real in each passing day.  I am a complex, convoluted, confusing person, not an online character.  I'm not worried that other people don't realize this--I'm worried I don't realize this.  There are many simple solutions, but none that resonate fully with what I needed to do.  I've deleted my Friendster profile.  Friendster is a great way of networking, staying in touch with old friends, making new friends, helping causes, and keeping the population informed.  I also, despite thinking otherwise, found myself constantly trying to reinvent myself on it.  This isn't Friendster's issue, it's mine.  I've got enough variations of my personality as is to deal with day to day....I don't need the added pressure of making myself simply sound as such online.  Which, sadly, is what I think I have been doing.  I'm staying off instant message devices, at least during my working hours.  As much as I love chatting it up daily with people, I'm realizing that is often my only interaction with those people.  Instead of writing great books or great articles, I write great instant messages.  I think I'd prefer to save my energy.  I'd also like to go home at theend of a day knowing a did everything I could to make sure that Report X got the full coverage it deserved, at least in my hands.  And, I'm turning my damn cell phone off.  I'm not pitching it or cancelling my service yet--it's the only phone I currently use and I like it for both convenience and safety reasons--but you can leave a message and know I will receive it, and even possibly call you back.   I'm more human than even I ever realized.  Coming from someone who traditionally has felt either much much less than human, or much much more than human, it's a new sensation.  It's oddly freeing, but also unsettling.  While I work my way through that, I probably won't be writing here much either.  Instead, I'll be writing my stories elsewhere.  I'll work on crocheting the sweater I started last year.  I'll actually do what I'm paid to do.  I'll spend time with people in person.  And maybe somewhere along the way I'll figure out what the hell is behind what I've been doing wrong lately.

       Liam Lynch's  urlLink Fake Songs  rules.  But even better are my fake bands.  First there were the  Truckstop Waitresses , my conceptual band of rowdy, angry, loudmouthed girls wearing name tags with names like "Marge" and pink lipsticked cigarettes dangling precariously from their lips as they growled out songs.    Now, there is  Das Pop Star (there should be an umlaut somewhere, only I haven't figured out how to do that via blogger).  It's a one-man show, like Badly Drawn Boy, Self, and Sebadoh/Folk Implosion/Lou Barlow, but with more of a  urlLink Dieter and  Sprockets' mentality, with a little Stereo Total thrown in.  This was all inspired by the story I heard on Marketplace last night, entitled "   Germany's Real School of Rock   ."   Basically this is my worst nightmare and a damn good idea.  It also makes me wonder why no one, in this era of overly produced and promoted created crap-pop music, that no one ever draws parallels between "Sucky Group/Band/Singer X" and Malcolm McLaren and the Sex Pistols.  McLaren's art project was at least an art project, but a human one that went bust.    More on this later.

       Or,   Washington, the evils of drinking and salvation in our Lord Jesus Christ  .  Well apparently I'm going to hell, like that was any big news.  My organization recently put out a very controversial report on underage drinking.  I work in communications area of my organization, not the policy organization.  I'm not providing links because I like to keep my blog separate from my work most of the time, but this bears mentioning.  I take no position on the report itself.  I know nothing, I just work there.  I answer a lot of phone calls.  Today, at 9:10 a.m., a man calls our office.  "Where are you located?"  Huh?  Address-wise, building-wise, city-wise?  I decided to start off generally.  "Washington."  "Washington, eh?  That's a good start."  And I realize this is going to be one long drawn out conversation.  He continues.  "Do you know what I'm referring to?"  The weather?  The war?  One of our hundreds of thousands of reports published?    "Um, no sir."  "I am referring to the evils of..." And at this point I can no longer quote him verbatim because I tuned out and started checking email.  Basically, this gentleman called to tell me his plan for stopping underage drinking entirely through incorporating anti-drug educations beginning everday in second grade.  (Because alcohol and not accepting Our Savior Jesus Christ are why people are going to hell.)  I'm not commenting on his plan, though I enourage you to please do so.    Anyhow, said gentleman goes on a rant for 15 minutes, despite my attempts to be polite yet interrupt.  He even interrogates me on Washingtonian drinking habits and my organization's connection to the federal government.  When I explained we are contracted to review policy decisions that either have been made or are being considered, he replied, "Well why do they have to do that?  Shouldn't they get it right the first time?  But then I guess you wouldn't have a job.   Blah blah blah blah blah ."  "I wouldn't know sir you'd have to ask them."  I finally am able to interrupt and tell him he should speak to the people who did the study.  I forward the call, and I usually just transfer it it, but I warned the staffer I forwarded the call to.    Beyond my general distaste for such grandstanding and self-righteousness, I have some suggestions for anyone who calls organizations looking for information, contacts, and just about ANYTHING.  1.  Why do people ever think that the first person they speak to is the correct person?  My organzation employs something like 2,000 people.  Most places have a SECRETARY answering PHONES and know NOTHING of which you SPEAK.  Does caller X ever think about this?  Of course not.  Please take that into consideration.  There is nothing that makes all of our lives easier than a caller asking "I have a question about the new report on such-and-such. is this the right place or can you direct me to it?"  YES I CAN HELP YOU.  Fifteen minute lectures on government, alcohol and Jesus Christ?  No, honey, nobody here can help you.  2.  As an extension to #1: Do your research and make sure you have an idea that a) you are calling the right organization and b) have an idea of who you'd like to speak to.  Have your questions written down.  I understand people feel the need to grandstand, like, all the friggin time, and I'm not going to deny anyone their rights to do so.  However, choose your audience.  Save your breath and time and blood pressure levels.  3.  Especially for reporters, not just random people calls:  Most answer to your questions can be found on the organizations' web sites.  Assuming you have Internet access, which I realize a substantial portion of America does not, but for those that do have access:  DO YOUR G* D* RESEARCH!!!!  For Pete' sake, I know this and I got a C in "Introduction to Reporting."  Stop bothering me with your dumbass questions.  We are one person short, can barely keep up with phone calls, are in a hiring freeze and just plain tight on time and money.  My job isn't just answering phones, it is a lot of other stuff.  Take your head out of your ass and think before you speak.  When I vented to my supervisor, she smiled and said, "Did you tell him to wait one moment while you poured more Bailey's in your coffee?"    I wish I had.   The even more ironic thing about this is that I'm currently on a nondrinking binge, which has started an office pool on how long I'll last.  I'm not an alcoholic, I swear.  Just can't hold my liquor but it likes to hold me.

       What a week.  Whataweekwhataweekwhataweek.  Currently I'm recovering from a total of 6 hours driving in under a 24 hour period, a nasty hangover (apparently it doesn't take much these days for my stomach to rebel and say no!), and some good ol' college-style drama-rama.  Oh yeah and getting lost in Camden, NJ.  Wheeee!  The drama is not so interesting though it took up most of my week.  End of story.  Friday night I saw  urlLink Cesaria Evora  at Lisner.  Wow.  So rarely do I go beyond my usual haunts (well, haunt really), and do anything remotely different.  Complacency is dangerous.  But when one of my supervisors asked me if I wanted her tix for that night, I jumped on the chance.  A night of incredible musicians and a singer who shakes it a little and lights up a cig on stage during her set break.  She has the voice of a fallen, melancholy angel.  Part Etta James, part Edith Pilaf, shaken and stirred with a conga and some sax.   JAAAAYSUS!       Saturday I feel blah.  No work to show at Broken Ink, no desire to experience post Halloween weekend b.s and the ending drama from the prior week.... and then I remember, it's Christine's going away party before she goes to Antarctica to study, um, soil stuff for two months.  (Rockgirl is entering her PhD program and knows lots of wonderful things about the earth.  While at times she has tried explaining to me these things, my wee little brain doesn't really hold it all.  Anyhow.)    I hop in the Olds (because Le Golf is in the shop), and drive to Philly.  Wheee!  Show up at Christine and Charles' place around 8:30 p.m.  Party.  Chat.  Laugh.  Cry.  Drink.  Pass out.  Wake up next morning and drive home with the hangover of all nations.  So damn happy I went.  Back to the applications b.s.  Right now it's all work on the essay and portfolio.  Any desires to write me recommendations?  Let me know  urlLink here .  Trust me I'll take you up on it.

       WHOA.  My Friendster fingers are itching as I've heard of  urlLink Joanne's  new time-passer... but I can't bring myself to break my good streak!  It's like falling off the wagon if I start again, and since I'm not so good about never smoking again or never drinking again or never dating again, or what-have-you.  At least I'm keeping my Friendster resolution!  I think I'll create a  Friendsters anonymous .  My real reason to write is that, being bored and stopping the hell of data entry, is that I was reading blogs of friends of friend with blogs, I have stumbled upon the blog of one of my close friends from elementary school and middle school.  I am completely weirded out by this.  I mean I'm really weirded out.  Middle school was a really painful time for me, so I'm not into reliving it when I don't have to, even with people that  I danced around on a barge in Lake Barcroft  singing "hamon, lechuga, tomate, con pan" for a school video.  ( That  was a funny memory.  Having my life threatened by a fellow student, getting sexually assaulted every day by jerks and then not having teachers do anything about it, those kinds of things-- not funny  memories.)  Part of me is dying to send an email catching up on the past eight years or so.... and the other part of me is completely mystified that this person I used to know has now grown up and done wonderful things; that I can read her blog and know what's going on with her and what she's thinking without her knowing--which is just  weird ; that for all I know she could be doing the same thing.   The world in its vastness has shrunk to ridiculously uncomfortable proportions .    And, call me chicken, but I doubt I'll write her.  Sometimes I think some things are best left in the past.   In Other News:    Almost all of the MFA applications are in the mail.   A huge massive weight has been lifted from my shoulders, and it feels great.  I'm finishing one essay for a school that refuses to use the normal format for personal statements (argh!) and waiting for three recommendation forms ("sealed in an envelope, signed across the seal") to arrive in the mail.  I wonder how long it will take for me to start getting anxious about hearing back.  Right now I'm just glad to sleep at night.  I just want to go somewhere that will do me good, and not set me too far back in debt.  That's all.    I'm really incredibly happy that 2003 ends tomorrow.  It's been a rough and tumble year for me, but I think I'll emerge on Jan. 1 2004 stronger than ever.  This past year has almost encompassed my entire life but in short spurts, and I also feel like I've cause a great deal of pain to others this year.   One of my mantras is to do no harm, but if you harm yourself in doing no harm to someone else, that's still harm.   For years, I did not understand that, and in realizing this, I caused some people a great deal of pain.  In full karmic retribution, I was hurt some this year too... it all comes full circle, dear... but in the end, I hope everyone knows my actions were without malice.  And, everything works out in the end, I always say.  I'm still working out on not harming myself  AND  others, but one thing at a time.  I have met some really incredible people this year.  This isn't a complete list but some who definitely deserve mention.  Liza made me realize that there is still wonder and beauty in the world.   urlLink Jeff  reaffirmed that some white boys do have rhythm.   urlLink Megan  found me crying in my beer and ever since we've been wondering why the hell we didn't know each other in high school... me especially since I could have used a sweet, loyal and just damn cool friend like her (but I'm glad to have her now!)  AJ and Mark made me write more, and I hope I end up going to school with Dan next year so I actually see him sometimes!   urlLink Joanne  reminded me that smart girls are the most fun.  My old friends too have proven their mettle, even in times of my most obnoxiousisity.  Leah, Sam, Mimi, Chumpie, Hollister, Mike, Vanessa, Lamotte, Christine, Shauna... they all never cease to love me, and I thank them.  I can only hope I've been as good a friend to them as they have to me.  And last but not least.... I met John... and basically,  John just gets it .  Happy New Year everyone.  Be safe out there.

       Heather's rules for the holidays:  1.  Stop sending out those stupid letters, especially if a) I never see you during the year and b) you're under 40.  I swear to god one of these days I'm sending out a letter of my own and it's not going to be appreciated.  "This year, Heather spent $400 on application fees just so she can get into a program she likes, while doing mad amounts of xeroxing and smacked her mom for being a crazy bitch!  P.S.  She doesn't like any of you."  I don't give a rats ass about the fact you attend church, that you love your job, that you have a girlfriend, that you've been taking care of your parents.  I don't hear from you more than once or twice a year.  Take me off your lists, jackasses!  2.  Gift certificates = yes.  3.  Stop the baking.  2 dozen cookies:  good.  10 dozen cookies: bad.  4.  If I'm laid up in bed puking every three hours and running a fever, chances are, I'm not "faking it" to get out of my "holiday responsibilities" which involve mostly being a verbal punching bag for when my mom burns a batch of (well, see number 3) or needs a ride somewhere.

       So I was trying to think of a good gift for a relative who is very heavily involved in anticonsumerist action.

       I am home sick.  I don't have full on upper-respiratory issues; instead I ache and I am exhausted.  I mean dog-tired.  What's frustrating me is that this isn't all mental for once.  I know exactly how to deal with mental issues like that.  Get up, force yourself out, keep pressing on.  This--dude this sucks!  I went to class last night to drop off my final paper and it seemed like I was there all day.  Nope, not even two hours including drive time.    I can't even read or write and I keep falling asleep during Law & Order.  Now that is just wrong.

       You know how emails build up, and sometimes there are questions with nine million responses and explanations to a question because nineteen million people are CC'd on it?  Yeah.  So it's Saturday, and I'm hauling ass on applications finally, and I check my work email.  (Mainly because that's where my New York Times updates go to...)    WHY DO I DO THIS?  (Note to self: Don't do that!!!)    Yesterday, someone my office works with was having web issues.  She CC'd three people on this question, on why she couldn't find something through our search engine.  The search engine for the site representing my organization does indeed suck ass.  However, none of the people she emailed (including myself) were the ones to ask this.  Her email basically implied that someone had fucked up (namely ME, and implicated my other two supervisors, just so's they'd know).  I immediately, in order to cover my bureaucratic, gear-in-the-machine ass, shoot of an email and CC the correct person with a retardedly in-depth explanation so that just about everyone in the animal kingdom can understand the issue at hand, from gnats to dolphins.  So there's basically a just plain stupid amount of emails over a very minor issue, and the person who the question should have been directed in the first place answered, explained and the situation was taken care of in all too roundabout a manner.  Today, bright and early, one of my supers who has been out of the office, had shot off a very accusatory email on why this document had not been archived properly.  It was clearly in response to the very very very first email, without having read any of the other emails following (that all are clearly marked, "Re: X dumbass subject at hand."  I HATE THAT SO MUCH.  I mean, read the rest of the goddamn explanations!  HELLO!  So I fwd her the LAST appropriate explanation, with headers etc, and write out yet ANOTHER explanation of the situation.    For fuck's sake, people.  This waste of everyone's time and server space could have been solved with a simple phone call, even to me if the originator thought I was the point person here, so I could have directed her to the information.  Mountains out of molehills, really.  This kind of crap was a daily occurance in my old office, so I've gotten kind of lax about the need to constantly be on the defensive.  It's just stupid and unnecessary, and a total mismanagement of time, funds, email and people---these people are "managers" in their positions and should know better.  I feel like I'm being kind of harsh, especially since I really like all the people involved both on professional and non-professional levels, but I'm also intensely sick of stupid email wars, be they work-involved or not.    UGH.  Now that I have that out of me, I'm back to analyzing this:  http://www.utexas.edu/coc/journalism/SOURCE/J395smF0/readings/slatetx1.html  OH!  HAPPY FIRST SNOW!  [And Jeffy---I know you're reading this and hate me right now.  But as I said earlier, I was not about to haul ass from Alexandria to Balto in the snow and rain last night, especially when I got in bed at 7, thinking I'd take a quick nap, and instead woke up around 11 pm.  I suck.  So I hope all went well and I'll buy the CD soon.]

       Ok Washington Post.  Way to  urlLink cover  the City Council debate on the smoking ban.  They managed to talk to everyone involved with SmokeFreeDC, talk to people from out of town, and at the very end of the article, mention "Joanne McNeil, a nonsmoker."     urlLink Joanne McNeil , a nonsmoker, is also one of those who started up  urlLink Ban the Ban , the DC-based, grassroots effort to stop the ban!    HELLO!?!?!?!  As someone who was a journalism major in undergrad, nothing pisses me off more than poor reporting and unbalanced coverage.  There is no such thing as totally unbiased media or totally balanced coverage.  I accept that knowing that we as journalists have to .  WAY TO SHOW BIAS, WASHINGTON POST.    But the really funny thing is that Carol Schwartz's  urlLink proposal  to reward nonsmoking restaurants and bars with a 15% tax cut (but still allowing smoking in places that choose), has seven co-sponsors!    Seems like all of your hot air, SmokeFreeDC, has gone up in smoke.  Now shut up and move out of DC and leave the natives and natives-by-choice  alone .  Pass my lighter and the Parliaments, honey.

       1.  My car insurance is going down. 2.  I can rent a car without the added "young'in" fee. 3.  I have made it a quarter way through my life.  This is a good thing--and quite impressive. 4.  We had "unscheduled leave" so while I waited for the snow to melt some, I slept in. 5.  During my commute I was listening to the radio and heard some songs that just made me happy as a clam: --Dynamite Hack's "Boyz in the Hood" (cover of the Eazy E song) --Jimi Hendrix's "Foxy Lady"  --No Doubt's "It's My Life" (AWESOME keyboard action!) --Heart's "Crazy on you" That was some good radio, if you ask me.   6.  I can finally shout  urlLink this  and mean it.  (Turn up those speakers, listen and read.) 7.   urlLink This  (pretty cool) and  urlLink this  (ok, kind of depressing). 8.

       1.  it is mutha-f'n cold out there.  oh wait, it's now 10 degrees with the windchill.  that's higher than the 4 degrees it was when i first woke up.  it's a heatwave.  2.  i saw some GWU student walking down virginia ave just now wearing low-slung sweatpants and a thin zip up hoodie, with her hips all showing.  BARE SKIN!  HELLO WHAT KIND OF IDIOT ARE YOU!?!?  if she were homeless, the shelter volunteers would have come by and told her to come on in, that exposed skin freezes in 30 min. right now.  JEEZ.  if i had been closer to her, i mighta smacked her.  3.  speaking of low-slung, i was outside because i had to return a great pair of jeans that i bought from girlshop.  these bad babies were the perfect shade of blue, perfectly faded, and perfectly fit everywhere... except that they were so low, i would have had ass cleavage on a constant basis, whether sitting or standing.  they were so low that it would regularly show 75% of my secret tattoo.  they were so low, that christina aguilera's jeans would be considered high-waisted.    i didn't even know they MADE jeans this low!!  i just though people pulled them down...  back on the hunt for perfect jeans again.

       Sometimes I really like taking a step back and looking at my life---seeing how situations come full circle, how your perceptions change as you get older, all that good stuff.    In case you forgot, I ran across an old friend's blog, and I wrote about it  urlLink here .  However, in my usual way, I thought about it and thought about it and thought about it, until I thought I might go loopy, and decided that there was no harm in emailing her.  I mean, that's why people have blogs, right?  To read, communicate and shrink the world a bit?  Anyhow, I did, and a little while later, she wrote back!    So dear  urlLink Anna Utgoff  and I met up, had coffee and went to hear Ron Suskind (author of the infamous " urlLink Paul O'Neill " book speak at  urlLink Politics & Prose .  Just like that.    I can't even begin to tell you how happy the whole situation made me.  It was literally like the past ten years hadn't even occurred--well, that's not quite right, we quickly tried to fill in the blanks (Anna: "So, well, how was high school?"  Me: "It just kind of happened, I guess.").    It was like this strange gap had just been closed, and I realized that even though I was so miserable all through those years, so was everybody else.  I have always had a real knack for telling people off and alienating others (as well as myself), supposedly as a result of fun psychoanlytical diagnoses (email me and I'll reply with the laundry list).  But I'm glad that while I'm still young, I'm able to see outside myself once in a while.    And I think it's safe to say that Anna and I will be seeing each other soon and somehow integrating national politics, witty lyrics, and the plot of  Alias .  YAY!

       it's sunday and i don't have to work tomorrow, thanks to the Martin Luther King, Jr. Holiday.  at my  urlLink alma mater , they usually had a MLK/Robert E. Lee joint birthday celebration, since Lee is an important figure in the history of my college.  however, it didn't take a northerner to see the hilarity and irony in that.  although many people didn't see the hilarity and irony in that, and that's why there are still alumni celebrations for REL's birthday this week.  i tend to avoid those.  they're not really my schtick.  last time i went, two years ago, i came late, missed the appetizers, and decided to drink my $35 entrance fee's worth of bad red wine.  later that night i ended up passed out in  urlLink Chadwick's  bathroom.  so the lessons learned here:  1.  i was broke and $35 for one night was too much for me then. 2.  i can never go back to chadwicks 3.  i was drunk and in georgetown, for christ's sake.  i absolutely hate georgetown nightlife and me drunk and in gtown, and surly, and running into people from college i don't like, is like mixing natty lite with a handle of mr. boston gin.  any way you look at it, it's going to be ugly.  leading us to .... 4.  i went to a friggin REL birthday alumni bash in the name of communing with alumni.  good grief!  was i on crack?  and lastly... 5.  my undergraduate institution is a crackden of inequity.  in the meantime, going on with the ramblings, i had a great saturday night.  made it into town despite the dire winter conditions (ahem), slid about the city sidewalks with john and went to  urlLink jyoti  for dinner (oh curry vindaloo, how i love you), then to  urlLink tryst  where i proceeded to load up on caffeine and liquor, and then to  urlLink st. ex .  the crowd there on weeknights is much much better, but alot of john's friends were there and it was a good time.  the DJ was good too, until he started splicing things too quickly (only 60 second of "under my thumb?"  that was just mean, as well as the short intros to "ain't nuthin but a G thang" and "like this and like that."  man i love me some snoop and dre).  also ran into my friend chris (hi!!) and skillfully held my turf while deftly avoiding high school encounters.

       There is nothing I hate more than bitchy emails.  I got this today from a school I applied to:   Dear Ms. McDonald,  We have not received your transcript from George Mason University.  English Graduate Department   GMU didn't send out my transcripts until last week as they didn't release Fall 03 grades until recently.  I replied with this kind note:   Thanks for letting me know.  I checked with George Mason and they sent the transcript out last week.  I can fax you an unofficial transcript if that will help (It's only two classes long.)  Please let me know.  Thank you.   I got this perky little message back:   I really need the official transcript.   NO SHIT?!  REALLY?  Is that why I requested all of mine from W&L and GMU back in OCTOBER AND NOVEMBER?!?!  And double-checked?  Triple-checked?  Why I felt incredibly pissy when I found out that GMU didn't send mine out until last week?  GEE WHIZ!  I do however know that a school MUCH FARTHER AWAY FROM D.C. than this institution does indeed already have my GMU transcript.  So I wrote this:   I understand that, and it's on its way.  Unfornately, despite requesting it back in November 2003, GMU didn't release anything until last week because they were waiting for those grades from the class I took Fall term.    If I request it to pick up in person, I could probably overnight it for delivery on Wednesday, if that's not too late.  However, other schools have received my transcript from GMU this past week so I'm assuming you will receive it soon as well.   I then just got this:   We can handle this any way you would like to.  We can wait, however, I will not be sending out any other e-mail so you will have to keep on top of it.    Are you fucking kidding me?  Because I expect handholding?   Honey, do not even try that.   I may be alot of things but incompetent is not one of them.  I responded tersely:   Understood.  I'll call early next week to confirm it has arrived.   You're damn right I'm going to call.  I also realized in my flusterization over my insane week at work, that I'm 36 hours and counting into not taking my meds.  This is NOT good.

       1.  SUVs and minivans  2.  People who drive like maniacs, not just in above vehicles  3.  People with no managerial skills who somehow make 10 times what I make (or at least twice what I make) who somehow are some of my bosses  4.  My mother, AKA Little Miss Mary Fucking Sunshine  5.  People who don't go to doctors despite their hacking coughs and loss of hearing or mental disorders  6.  Most of my family, notable exceptions being my cousins  7.  The committee members who talk loudly in the hallways to each other or on their cell phones, and or come in my office to simply look at my bookshelf and not speak to me.  What the fuck, people?  A Ph.D. is no substitute for common sense.  8.  People who are pissed off at me because they think I deleted them from my Friendster list.  I just found out yesterday that one person thought I had deleted him from my list, and I then thought, huh, I wonder how many people think I just deleted them and not just myself, even though I wrote a whole entry here about how I was leaving Friendster.  Turns out  a lot  of my so-called friends thought that.  People who I knew in real life knew that.  Get a grip people.  All of you have my phone number--ever think maybe something was wrong?  That it wasn't about you?  How come people I know solely via the Internet knew that it wasn't a personal thing?  Oh wait, because they read my blog and we email regularly.    All of the above were previously on my shitlist which nearly exploded this morning when #4 decided to speak to me this morning about absolutely nothing thus taking up my precious morning rush out the door despite that she has been intolerable lately, after stupid unnecessary drama from #3 yesterday, and two days of #1 and #2 after two weeks of none of them being around and then #2 cutting me off thus nearly slamming me into a #1 this morning.  But of course, I'm the one who gets cussed out and flicked off because I don't drive a gas-guzzling big honking slab of steel and I'm not talking on my cell phone, because those are the only people allowed on the road these days.  The rest were just on my   What the Fuck   lists.    Anyhow, I figure if I ban them entirely from Heather's World, I never have to deal with them ever again.  So,  BEGONE, INTOLERABLES!     I ban you!    Sigh.

       my weekend has be awash in gush over material goods.    friday i went to the world's most horrible shopping location, horrible because i hate all the people who shop there with their stupid golden hair and fake tans and dried up skin, and horrible because i practically splooge when i walke amongst all the pretty pretty clothes and shoes and shiny sparkley nothings that cost hundreds and thousands of dollars.  fabrics and colors and unique cuts and materials all give me a sense of bliss--but big whopping debt for things that i may  not like next season does not.  (and i have indeed been there)  but i was indeed on a mission.  i had a gift card from my last birthday that i had never used and bought a quilt from one of my favorite stores.  this gift card, which i thought was $25, was for $75!!!  i found this out at the register, got the quilt i've been madly in love with for quite some time for a steal, and still need to call my cousin laura and thank her.... why i didn't use my gift card earlier is beyond me.  go figure.  YAY!  then i went to whole foods and bought good smelling things--a reiki charged candle smelling of lemongrass and spice and yummyness, grapefruit essential oil, shower gel scented with citrus and thyme.  so my room, with its happy quilt and citrusy scents and citrusy me underneath the happy quit.... is now a small retreat away from the rest of my insane household.   no dirty details there, really, i have bitched enough about my family to john this week.  no need in repeating it.  classic quote however when i suggested a certain maternal figure stop doing laundry in the damp basement as to not further aggravate her sinus infection:  "well, we weren't all smart enough to go to washington & lee."  my reply, "fuck you, ya bitch."  i suppose that's not very karmically sound.  today went shopping with john... bought tasty condiments at world market (CITRUS!) and new shoes that make my feet as blissful as, say, me snuggled under the happy quilt with a good book and some tea and maybe another individual.    god, i'm awash in gush.  i hate when i'm blissfull and just gush constantly.  somebody smack me and hand me a 40 oz or a big fat j and remind me of the days where i'd break a bottle and threaten people.  but it's also really nice too.

       You're  Ulysses ! by James Joyce  Most people are convinced that you don't make any sense, but compared to what else you could say, what you're saying now makes tons of sense. What people do understand about you is your vulgarity, which has convinced people that you are at once content to wander around aimlessly, taking in the sights and sounds of the city. What you see is vast, almost limitless, and brings you additional fame. When no one is looking, you dream of being a Greek folk hero.

       This kind of sucks.  Late April to May?  I may have already chosen a school by that point, and if I got a full ride here (hahahahaha, oh that hurts my belly to laugh that hard), it would screw everything up.  I HATE waiting.   Dear Heather:   We at School of the Arts would like to thank you for applying to one of our Master of Fine Arts Divisions this year. We realize that you had many choices and appreciate that you chose to apply to  School X .   Applications are now in the midst of the review process. We received a large number of applications and already know that you are amongst a distinguished group. Because each portfolio is looked at thoroughly, by several people, the decision process takes some time. Notifications are typically mailed in late April or early May.   If you have questions, please email admissions-arts@schoolX.edu. Once again, thank you for choosing to apply to School X.  Best,   Admissions

       Well my weekend, though relative uneventful, was a two thumbs up.  Friday I hung out with John, who was sick, and we watched  urlLink Dummy .  Good cast, which featured Adrien Brody (sigh), Milla Jovovich (as the love child of Karen O and a klezmer band--totally hottt), and Vera Farmiga (whose name I love).  It was just a really cute movie about a loser living at home (shut yo' mouf) who finds happiness in his dummy and his unemployment counselor.    Saturday I cleaned my room, which was a massive undertaking.  I can actually see the floor now.  I also think I went a little manic as I decided it was damn time to clean out my closet, rearrange all my drawers by style of clothing and whether it is for work or hanging out or going out, and scrub all my candle holders.  Hmm.   John and I went to Iota, where I proceeded to get smashed off of a tasty Riesling, and rock out to Monopoli and Army of Me, both with whom I was impressed.  Met up with Joanne (who proceeded once again to know everybody, Anna and her friend Lindsey, and a good old' Dubyuhnell person who I wasn't disturbed to run into.  Go  urlLink Twan !    Sunday went to lunch with my mom, caught up on a lot of stuff, realized that I don't totally hate her or my grandmother--just want my own space.  Really interesting piece on  urlLink children moving back home  on  urlLink NPR's  Morning Edition.  I'll post the link once it's up.  I think the piece picked an unusual group of people who moved back with their parents, but I do think it raises awareness of just how bad the friggin economy is, and the various reasons why people move home.    Sunday I also finished  urlLink Chaseworld , and realized I am completely literature reader, and reading things as a folklorist/anthropologist.  There is a completely different lens that one uses to analyze everyday actions within a community, and I'm having trouble realizing that this or that is something analyses-worthy in the world of folklore, when it wouldn't mean anything in your average literary analysis.  Also, breaking down these customs into flow charts and equations seems rather...unnatural to me.  It's like economics; I understand supply and demand, but once you get to the equations, my brain shuts down.  If it's all in words and theory, I'm fine.  Equations, charts, diagrams?  No.  All in all, I'm getting frustrated, and I'm feeling stupid.  I've got a meeting with my professor, which should help, but in the meantime, I'm taking a break from the reading and breathing deeply.  Speaking of deep breathing, I've returned to my yoga practice.  Never have tight hamstrings felt so good... and my shoulders have gone down about two inches.  Mmm.

       Ok.  I wrote this in response to Joanne's posting (and responses to her posting) on Valentine's Day, and realize that it was so long I should just replicate it here.  It seems to range the gamut from my pet topic of domestic violence, to commercialization of holidays, to the everpresent philosophical and folkloric bent I have right now on "Sense of Place."   urlLink Don't Be a Hero.: V Day   I don't think raising awareness on V-Day for such a scourge as domestic violence is necessarily a bad idea. Using a holiday that focuses so much on the "good" part of love (at least in theory) has potential to draw more awareness to a very serious problem that occurs more frequently than most of us would like to admit. According to a DOJ study published in 1998, estimates range from 960,000 incidents of violence against a current or former spouse, boyfriend, or girlfriend each year to 4 million women who are physically abused by their husbands or live-in partners each year. NOTE: That's not just against heterosexual women, but woman against man, man against man, and woman against woman.   I think unfortunately a handful of "radical" feminists have given a bad name to any woman who sees herself as a freethinking independent individual--which was, and still is, the goal of the mainstream feminist movement. I also think that the women who rant against feminists fail to realize that the only reason they have the ability to rant at all was because of several key figures throughout history who were ALWAYS considered "radical feminists", like Susan B. Anthony, Elizabeth Cady Stanton, and Lucretia Mott, even up through Gloria Steinem and Geraldine Ferraro. Without them, we all might still be stuck in the kitchen and unable to vote. Not every feminist is a riot grrl, a lesbian, or a man-hater. The most effective are quite humanist in their beliefs--feminism is just the piece of the pie that pertains to the civil rights of women.  Mr. Buckley.... Armature has just as much right to voice his opinion that what you say in your post seems a little off, just as you have right to say it.   I find it frightening that people get so angry about V-Day, just as I find it frightening that some people buy into it. If you think it's a scam... don't buy into it. I get a little sick of the constant red boxes of candy and teddy bears, but I'm not a big fan of candy and teddy bears any time of the year either. I agree with Armature. I don't buy into the candy and flowers b.s., and I probably wouldn't date anyone who does either. If someone considers Valentine's Day the only day of the year they "show" love, be it to give or to receive, that's pretty messed up.  All of the holidays in the U.S. have been extensively commercialized, probably as a means to create a sense of either national identity, community or what have you (and of course, to make the bling). Think about it: Halloween was once the pre-cursor to All-Saints and All-Souls day. Then it was a harmless holiday for children. Now it's a mega-consumer enterprise it gives adults an excuse to dress up, get drunk and act like fools. The same can be said for New Years', July 4th, and lots of other holidays. Would you get blazingly angry over the commercialization of Easter? I don't buy into the candy baskets for kids or adults. Easter tends to be a big deal in my very Catholic household, at least in terms of meaning--not in terms of bunnies and that annoying plastic "grass" in baskets.   While I'm not devout, I don't appreciate the glamorization/commercialization/what-have-you of ANY holidays. Holidays were originally sources of celebration within communities to mark religious days, or at least days that had a historical significance within the communities' minds. But I'm not going to rant about Big Corporations fuck it up, or Big Government fucks it up, or how men fuck it up, or women fuck it up.... I'm simply going to carry on doing what I'm doing and celebrating whatever holidays I choose to celebrate in ways that mean something to me and to my family and friends.

       i've gotten a lot done today, but in talking to john over coffee, i realized that i'm sinking.  i'm wrapped up in my confusion over why i am where i am right now.  my class, "sense of place," has me pondering all things existential, but it's starting to take over in my personal self, not just the academic self.  essentially, i'm crashing or i've crashed.  i'm better about seeing it these days.  i've been using the sunlight lamp, getting outside, trying to sleep normally, eating well, and not letting myself think about it too much.  however, it's still there.  the it is "the darkness" (unfortunately, not the band), which is what a friend of mine in college and i used to silently nod our heads in agreement to, while watching "hellraiser 4" and then the video for Coldplay's "Yellow", at 5:30 a.m., because neither of us could sleep.  it's not to the point where i crawl into the bed, curl up and cry until i cannot cry anymore and then proceed to just stay there, immobile, for a few days.    i'm scared of that happening again.  i'm frustrated that i'm still living at home, i'm frustrated that i put up with the quirks of my family and pay (a very nominal amount of) rent.  i'm pissed as hell at myself for not having more cash saved.  i'm having recurring fantasies of  urlLink alias -like action sequences where i track down my  urlLink other DNA contributor  and give him what-for.  i'm convinced that if i sell my entire wardrobed and buy a new one, all my lifes' problems will be solved.  i've got no home, despite i've lived in the same place for 25 years.  i've got no place, at least not yet.  sometimes i feel like i don't really exist in my full capabilities.  i'm philosophically and chemically mind-fucking myself.  and unlike masturbation scenes in the  urlLink L-Word , it's not hot.  it's just to the point where i feel like sitting and crocheting until it all passes over.  just sitting and waiting until it all stops.  i want to scream and stop my feet and have people listen to me instead of simply hearing me.   i don't want a bunch of comments of "feel better heather."  i may tell you to fuck off.  this isn't a cry for help---i have a very good shrink, i'm on my cocktail of meds, and i just have to wait this shit out.    i just want people to understand.  that's why i'm writing this.  even normal, working, socially active, relatively functional people have mental illness and here it is in a low-level glory.  this is the opposite of a  urlLink chet baker mood  .  more of a miles davis circa bitches' brew... disturbed, depressed, and slightly dangerous.   so i'm going back to my writing, and at least until the law&order marathon finishes, i'm going to sit and wait.

       Last night in class, we were discussing that week’s assigned reading,  urlLink  Getting Back into Place: Toward a Renewed Study of the Place-World, by Edward S. Casey  .  The first chapter deals with “implacement” and the second, “displacement.”  In the first chapter, Casey makes the distinction that our contemporary world and culture revolves around time as the situating force: we are running out of time, we have saved time, we are just in time.  He is trying to make the case that using place as the center of culture gives a more grounded community.  (That is a very rough summation, a disclaimer just in case my professor or any other classmate happens to read this post.)  So far, this book is the first reading that has grabbed me by the proverbial shoulders.  It is a readable mix of history, philosophy and cultural observation and opinion.    During the class’s discussion on time, I abruptly interrupted a fellow classmate who usually makes some interesting points.  (It’s only the third class, and second I’ve attended, so I’m not going on much.)  He described our slavery to the 9-5 machine to survive, and said,  “We essentially become victims to Time.”   I think his tone was slightly tongue in cheek---my read on this is purely in my head, as is my take that the class overall is witty, has a sense of humor, and at times will be snarky, thank goodness), but at the same time, far be it from me not to speak up.  I butted right in.   “I have a problem with the use of the word victims.”   (What am I, I a prosecuting attorney?!)  “More often than not, my job annoys me, and I hate the 9-5 drill.  However, I chose to work this job.  I choose to keep it for now.  These are all decisions I made.  There are plenty of people who make liveable salaries working nontraditional jobs or by freelancing.”  I went on to describe my point.   My professor chimed in too that our options far exceed those of someone in rural China, who might have the option of being a farmer and starving, or working nonstop at the factory.  And then, a strange sensation crept over me.   I had just told my whiny alter-ego to shut the fuck up.   This has increasingly emerged from my subconscious to my conscious in the past few months, and now that I’m looking at new plans for Fall 2004 (five more weeks till I know where all I got in… just five more weeks, 3 days, 5 hours, 34 minutes and 53 seconds… or something), I’m realizing just how in control of things I am.  I am indeed staying in my admin-monkey job while I save (which I’m realizing now is just as much a choice as it is to buy clothes… this is a hard concept if you come from a family where new clothes solve all problems), and looking at freelance opportunities, and at the possibility of going full time come the fall… because I want to spend 2 years writing, not being tired and exhausted and broke because I’m doing school and work half-assed.    So yeah.  That was my great revelation.  I’ll be posting more on thoughts about my class as I find damn fascinating, even though I’m completely lost as to the anthropological history and theory.  Today’s drink:  urlLink Naked’s  Green Machine: Consisting of 1300 mg of Spirulina, 400 mg of Chlorella, 100 mg of Green Tea, 100 mg of Broccoli, 100 mg of Spinach, 50 mg of Blue Green Algae, 50 mg. Of Garlic, 50 mg of Echinacea, 75 mg of Barley Grass, and 75 mg of Wheat Grass, plus 1 full pound of apples, pears, mango, banana, pineapple and kiwi.  And it tastes pretty good!    Next thing you know I’ll be wearing Birkenstocks and stomping on Granola.

       a friend of john's went to see the shins last night, who i am going to see tonight.  he gave them a so-so review, claiming he didn't get their "next big thing" status, and claimed they rivaled the strokes for female listeners.  here is my convo with john:  hdogg915: i think [friend] is a bit cracked with concerns to music chapin103: yes, he is. hdogg915: i mean, gushing over my morning jacket and not understanding the musical gloriousness of the shins? chapin103: haha. hdogg915: it's not a next big thing issue at all.... they play great music hdogg915: have witty, intelligent lyrics hdogg915: and are a story of a band that IS good actually getting some attention as such chapin103: he's too caught up in the scene, methinks. hdogg915: yeah hdogg915: he's not even so underground though... hdogg915: his tastes are quite mainstream college boy chapin103: his favorite band ever is WEEN chapin103: i think ween kinda sucks. hdogg915: ok.  i'm sorry.  i can never discuss music with [friend] ever again. hdogg915: i have far more respect for people who claim their fav. band is pearl jam, or led zeppelin hdogg915: while i'm not huge fans of either, i do respect them musically hdogg915: but WEEN?!!?! hdogg915: no. chapin103: lmao. hdogg915: ween is just wrong. chapin103: push-a lil' daisies and make 'em come up. hdogg915: ? chapin103: (retarded ween lyrics) hdogg915: phish is better than ween chapin103: lol hdogg915: in fact, i place ween on the indie-crap level with creed. hdogg915: if solely for dumbass name alone.

       So yesterday was really ridiculous, to say the least.  Apparently I posted something around 4 p.m. here.  Funny, I don't remember doing that.  In fact, I don't remember most of yesterday afternoon, except for the godawful, searing, insistent pain from a  urlLink migraine .  (I link that because people always think, "Oh, a migraine is a bad headache."  No.  It's worse than that.  It's the clinical definition for the worst thing you will ever experience, except maybe having your arm sawed off without any anesthesia.  In Trainspotting, heroin is defined as feeling like a full-body orgasm.  Well, a migraine is like the polar opposite of that.)  Around 4:15 I closed my office door to keep out the noise and laid my head on the desk while praying that the medicine I take for this kicks in.  Around 4:45, I shoot up, answer the phone, and my supervisor comes in.  "Bill K just came in and said you were passed out on the desk and he couldn't wake you."  "Huh?"  "Heather GO HOME!"  Apparently I was pretty much face down on the keyboard.  I apologized to Bill today (who I was supposedly helping yesterday with a massive shit-hitting-the-fan release that got leaked, but then it actually wasn't leaked, and everything was hunky dory), who laughed.  Apparently at the time he was totally freaked out and wasn't sure if I was dead, passed out or what, so he got Carol.  Thank god I work with  mostly cool people.    I actually don't really remember driving home from work yesterday either.  Frightening.  I got home, passed out till about 8ish, woke up, ate, and went back to sleep.  This all just reminds me of the time I fainted in class my senior year of college.  While at the height of a mixed episode from hell (some of you probably remember this...), I didn't sleep for weeks.  I was finally given an anti-depressant with the side effect of making me very very sleepy.  The first night I took it, I slept for 15 hours.  It was fabulous.  The next morning, I woke up late, rushed to class, and spent the hour feeling woozy.  Next thing I know, I turn to my friend, and ask her to get me to the bathroom as I think I'm going to vomit.  Apparently I went straight down after that.  My professor (who was appraised of the situation) called security, who then took me to the health center on campus.  It was a greatly embarassing moment, as I was essentially hauled out pale and limp by two campus policemen, right between classes changing.  GREAT.  It was kinda funny, actually.  So my goal today: I'm going to try not to pass out.

       in my hopes to blog not only the heatherrificness of my life, but also all things writerly, i've decided to keep public my writing submissions and the track record (accepted, letter of "keep working it at it", form letter, post card that says "thanks but no thanks, sucker."  i want to keep it in the margins, but as i'm working on the design issues plaguing this site (i.e., it's ugly as sin), it may take a while.  so keep your eyes open for it.  i thought about blogging acceptances and rejections into MFA programs, but that's just not a good idea... i don't mind admitting public humiliation and loss in terms of trying to get published, but if i go 1 for 9, i don't necessary want everyone knowing where i'm applying.  if you can think of a reasonable reason that others might benefit from any knowledge i learn from being accepted into or rejected from the academic halls of the writing craft, lemme know, and i'll think about it.  also, i bought a domain name.  next stop:  camera phone.

       And I love it.  I love every dirty walked-on inch of New York.  John and I went for the weekend, and while a whirlwind trip, managed to fit in a lot.  Friday: shopped, hung out at my Yaffa sweet Yaffa Café during the day, met up with John’s friends Barry and Marla, and my friend the Cooker, headed to bars  urlLink Hell ,  urlLink Pastis  (where there were reservations till 3 am, same with  urlLink Apt ), Red Room Lounge (not too different than the Black Cat’s Red Room), and  urlLink Pop Burger .    Pop Burger, btw, fucking rules.  I could get a burger, a martini, french fries, a shake, a hotdog, a root bear float, and beer, all while watching nasty Dutch porn projected onto the walls, while sitting on comfortable swank leather furniture.   Saturday, hit the  urlLink Museum of Arts and Design  with John’s parents, as well as the  urlLink Garth Clark Gallery .  Shopped a bit more.  Got dolled up and learned to tango (“learned” being a loose term) at John’s aunt’s birthday party.  Hit some meatmarket bar in the East Village after that and got home frozen.  That’s what I get for wearing chiffon in January.  Whatever.  So beyond my itinerary, I love NYC.  I love it.  LOVE IT!  My shoulders relax a bit and I slip into a swagger.  It’s my home, even though I wasn’t born there.  I’m still waiting on grad school notifications---it’ll be a while---but I realized just how badly I want to be back in New York.  It’s not the bars and nightlife, though that’s great.  It’s not just the artistic and intelligent life that can be found all over the city.  It’s not just that the people dress well for the most part.   It’s that I can get Indian food at 4 am.  It’s that I can go somewhere and start talking to people about everything and nothing.  It’s the Strand.  It’s  urlLink Tompkins Square Park .  It’s the  urlLink Yaffa Café .  It’s NYU, The New School, Columbia University, and the CUNY institutions all within a few square miles. I want to sprawl out on the sidewalk at Astor Place and roll around in its’ fabulous filth.  Fuck your claims of “expensive housing.”  It’s expensive here in D.C., and in San Francisco, and in lots of other cities---at least in NYC you get a lot of bang for your buck in terms of location.  I’m not going on to a "D.C. sucks" rant… it does suck, but there are times where I appreciate and even like D.C.  But I think I’ve got the NYC bug again.  It just raised it’s itchy fabulous head again and hopefully soon I can satisfy it.  Maybe with some Dutch porn.

       It's  urlLink TWAN !  So Anthony Allen is the shit drummer.  Period.  And a really nice guy.  I went to college with him.  Go read it!  NOW!  Go see him play sometime, even if it's solely to see his gravity-defying hair.

       So it's only 48 degrees Fahrenheit today... doesn't mean it's not spring.  Right?  I said, RIGHT Just as I've been cleaning up my room and cleaning out my closets, I've been clearing out clutter, both physical and virtual.  I'm working on decluttering the blog some, and adding other pertinent information (see updated links, added bloggers, etc.).

       so i had a quick performance review today, to possibly set myself up with a fat raise.  unfortunately, we are in a budget crunch.  and, i happened to mention i might be leaving at the end of the summer, depending what happens.  this of course was a surprise, especially since i'm most likely taking over for a woman going on maternity leave July-October.... if I leave in august, this may be difficult to do.   PROS OF ATTENDING A PROGRAM IN DC:  * paycheck *tuition reimbursement *near friends and family *good MFA program with good writers    CONS   *working full time, school part time = writing not a priority *i've lived here for about 20 years.  i need a change.    PROS OF GOING TO SCHOOL X *full time writing  *kick-ass faculty and kick-ass program *possible t.a. position *city where cost of living is way below national average *city where culture takes precendence *still relatively close to all friends on east coast and family    CONS   *loans *even colder winters *no job  *leaving a job that i don't absolutely hate, with people i really happen to like, and am finally quite possibly being promoted.  my grammar structure is indeed all screwy because i'm tired.  spent last night finishing  urlLink The Myth of Santa Fe,  which reminded me of two of my favorite words:   pastiche  and  syzygy .  thoughts on pros and cons?

       ... and featured  urlLink Sartre ,  urlLink Shiva Rea  and Terry Gross, and maybe Julia Stiles as a commentator, it would sound something like this.  *This* is a really long and random story, but all true, and very strange.  I went to a holistic healing event Saturday that was completely amazing.  I had a mini  urlLink reiki  session, and I was told I would have dreams, most likely, that I should pay attention to, because they may provide answers to questions I’ve had.  When the reiki session was finished, I felt nothing but a little tired.  I did feel a funny pang at one point in my right kidney.  Mimi said I was glowing though.  Then we did a yoga session and left soon after, refreshed.  I rushed home, showered and changed, and got back on the road to meet  urlLink Anna  and Lindsay in Georgetown to see  urlLink the new Julia Stiles  movie.  Yes I did just write that.  Sigh.  Fourteen year old girls squealed in glee at the Prince and lady's first kiss.  Delightfully terrible, but not so delightfully terrible soundtrack, and nothing compared with Julia Stiles' seminal body of work "Down to You."  Afterwards, we went to Anna's new p(a)lace where there was a Super Mario Brothers 2 old skool battle where I proved my overall ineptness with video games. I putzed out early because I was suddenly so tired and had family obligations Sunday (more on the fam in later post).  I went home and went right to bed.  And then I had a really weird dream.   I was in a homey room, big comfy couches and kind of dark wood and low lighting, with a character in the book of my life whom I barely know and haven’t talked with in ages and kept thinking, why is *HE* in my dream? We were talking and he seemed sad and distant.  Something you commented on, something he was really proud of, made me say, “Well you know hundreds of Cubans died in the revolution for that,” like when you say that small Malaysian children with dysentery made your Nikes.  Except it wasn’t in that tone, it was more matter of fact, like a trivia question.  He looked shocked and overcome.  Sometime before or after that, he commented that I should stop wearing jeans all the time, how he was so sick of me wearing jeans all the time, and my response was, “Well, I like corduroys.”  I got up and went on with my day, and then had a sinking feeling, and began calling him on my cell, and it kept going straight to his voicemail.  I ran around what seemed like a campus and finally found him, the police trying to restrain him from something, which seemed like suicide, but somehow it wasn’t.  I was crying and he was crying and kept accusing me that I didn’t care and that I was so blind and I kept saying but I didn’t know!  I didn’t know!  And then he calmed down and just seemed sullen.  Then I perked up and said, “oh yeah, but you got into the New School and I didn’t, so you know, it’s all ok, right?”   Which brings me to the first thing I thought when I woke up: So, poet, did you get into the New School?  And, are you ok?  I don’t know what questions this dream will answer, other than pointing out how my brain picks up images from the movie, memories of people on the periphery of my life, audio clips from  urlLink Fresh Air  where Terry Gross talks to everyone with whom  urlLink Spaulding Gray  was close, and folklore ideas involving the  urlLink Cuban-American diaspora and the Cuban Revolution .    Who knows--I'm still recording it for future reference.  (Massive thanks to Tazima, Oya, Sonya and Zahra and everyone else involved with Saturday's day of healing.  Next time I'm alotting the whole day for it.)  (Anna and Lindsay: I'm finding an old skool nintendo set and practicing until I can serve as a better teammate and/or frightening opponent.  Prepare to meet the pink shoes of doom!)

       So I called the cops today to get an update on my case regarding my identity theft.  The update is that there is none.  There is no way to find the person who stole my SSN, my debit card and used it to get a phone.  They don't have enough information for a warrant and they don't have the manpower.  They can't track anything.  "If its any consolation," the officer told me, "These guys do get caught eventually because they get greedy."  What I'd like to know is how billions can be spent on a war that the majority of American doesn't support, but there are teeny tiny departments in police forces nationwide who can't handle the influx of identity theft cases.  The Federal Trade Commission  urlLink says  that 214,905 people reported cases of identity theft last year.  Operative word being  reported .  I realize that's faulty logic, in a way, comparing an international war to my relatively puny battle, but security is security.   I'm just lucky that I got my money refunded from the bank... unfortunately, no one pays them back.

       Today I emailed the rest of the schools I have heard from, and I had  TWO  updates.   3 in, 3 not in, 3 to go.      Dear Ms.  McDonald,  We were delighted to  receive your application to our MFA program, and are even happier to extend you  an offer of admission for fall 2004.  While we are not able to provide you  with an offer of a Teaching Assistantship at this time (we have very few of  these to offer to entering MFA students), you are actively on the wait list for  one of these positions; I will contact you immediately should one of them become available.  In the meantime, you should expect to receive a formal offer  letter from our dean's office very soon.  If you have any questions about  the offer or the MFA program here at XXX, please don't hesitate to contact  me.  Please also feel free to contact the Director of the Writing Program,  Professor XXXXXXX.  I know that he would welcome the opportunity to discuss the  Writing program with you.  I would also be  more than happy to put you in touch with current creative nonfiction  graduate students and faculty.  All the  Best,  XXXXXXXXX   also got an email rejection today, but whatever.  it was a nice one.  apparently there were only four spots and 111 people applied for them.     holy crap!     next year i might be studying at the  OLDEST CREATIVE WRITING PROGRAM IN THE NATION  under the  "GODFATHER OF CREATIVE NONFICTION," at least according to  Vanity Fair ...   yeesh.  i need a stiff drink.

       thursday night my life changed twice within eight hours.  of course, now that i write that, it sounds like i'm saying people died that were close to me and then i got into a car wreck and now i have no right arm.  but actually it was really amazing.  thursday, my anxiety re: school admissions was at an all time high.  i call home to see if the mail has arrived.  it has, and there are two letters for me, from two schools in dear nyc.  i was rejected from both, and it stung like hell.   so i'm trying not to bawl my eyes out in the middle of the office, and i'm talking to john, who reminds me that i have big plans for the evening--which at this point i almost call off entirely.  john took me for a tasty dinner at local 16, got the good window seat, and had some amazing food.  (john btw, just gets it.)  he then pushes me off to my big night, thank god.  my plans for the night were to talk with kelly cherry.  i didn't really think it would happen until i got there (late, because i have the navigational capabilities of a two-toed tree sloth), and saw her reading.  for some time now, i've been in correspondence with her because i wanted to study under her, so i wrote her asking where she taught.  she is now retired from teaching, but we kept writing, and i saw she was reading through the Cafe Muse series in Friendship Heights.  i wrote her and asked if she wouldn't mind meeting up with me...  ... and she said yes.  i had met her once before, and seen her read several times, while down at dubyuhnell.  i have difficulty explaining why i just absolutely adore her so much, but i'd liken it to some people's fascination with the greatful dead, or phish, except i don't stalk her and i bathe regularly.  but nonetheless, we spent three hours talking about writing, MFA programs, writers conferences and communes and retreats, books, authors, latin translation, writing and being a woman, and all sorts of great stuff.  that's a pretty watered down synopsis, but i'm not providing a transcript.  sorry.  all i know is that there is she didn't mind telling me that i probably won't get published until roughly ten years after my mfa, and that the mfa is a good thing to do to get in the writing habit as well as making connections, and that it is all worth it.  i can't think of a better way to have spent my evening, or better timing for two rejection letters to have come, or a better night to have sat down with kelly cherry.  she absolutely renewed my spirits and gave me a huge boost of confidence where it was lagging.    thanks kelly.  and thank you john.  and thank you for all the people who have been listening/supporting me through my overly dramatic return to grad school  score: 2-2-5 (2 in, 2 not in, 5 to go)

       When I opened it again, as I cram at the office for an assignment due tonight that I've had weeks to work on and conveniently left till the last minute, those nights came rushing back.  I had almost forgotten I had them, amidst all the other drama I spent my time on in college.    Those nights of sitting awkwardly, one leg bent with my head resting on my knee, the other stuck straight out, foot resting on the back support bar of the desk, chain-smoking and drinking black coffee to stay awake and all but ruin my inner organs, windows open all the way so the smell wouldn't linger and the cold January air would keep me awake too, as I wrote about Nietzsche and Heidegger, Joyce and Faulkner, Mao and Steinbeck, O'Conner and Porter, Greil Marcus and Plato.  I could go on.  I wrote about them on my black Dell laptop that I broke twice before it died completely, and then on my bovine Gateway.  I wrote about them on my old, Greek-society-inscribed desk.  I wrote about them as my residents screeched sorority chants in the hallways or came into my room just so they knew someone else was awake and secretly smoking in her room too.  It smells good, and it makes me happy.  Soon I'll be doing all the academic stuff all over again--the good stuff, not the growing-up-college-isn't-all-about-class stuff.  This time it will be all about class, and books, and writing, and I absolutely can't wait.  Now somebody finish sending out those acceptance (er, rejection, quite possibly) letters and fin-aid packages.  I'm sick of waiting.

       DUDE.  While wandering around i-Tunes, I found  urlLink Carina Round's  debut CD.... like the genetically spliced child of PJ Harvey, Fiona Apple, Jack White and Juliana Hatfield, with maybe some Magnapop thrown in.    She is my new favorite.    I want to be her.    Go check her out.  Then I found out that PJ Harvey is releasing a new CD (via Pitchfork) this summer and Sleater-Kinney is touring veddy veddy soon (also via Pitchfork).  All after listening to some good ol' Ani diFranco (living in clip, CD 1... ohhh sooo good) for the past two days.  These things make me happy.  Funny, because my serotonin levels are at almost nil and those are all angry chicks, but nonetheless, veddy veddy good.  I'm going to go watch more Law&Order now.

       so i got notice that a college i've applied to had not receive fin aid materials last night, including "non custodial parent returns and statement".... so i emailed them this a.m. to see if they had received them yet, and they had, but then they said this:  "As for the non-custodial parent information, I'm cc'ing this email to your aid officer.  If she is unable to waive those forms for any reason, she'll get in touch with you and let you know the situation."  1.  i am filing as an independent student.  my mother and grandmother will in no means be aiding me financially or otherwise in the next year.  2.  there are no forms to fill out because there is no non-custodial parent, except on paper, because i haven't known where the guy has been for the past 15 years.  you don't want homosexuals to marry and raise families because of the "sanctity of marriage" and that apparently heterosexuals on the whole have done better raising families?  puh-leeeeeeeeeeeze.  my parents were married under a year, my sperm donor (aka mother's ex husband, aka biological father) has never done anything to be parental in terms spiritually, mentally, emotionally, physically, locationally or financially, and while i have no guarantee that a homosexual couple could raise a family better, i have no doubt that they should at least have the same chances as the heterosexual fuckups.  as cher horowitz said so eloquently, "whatever!"

       so in my serotonin slump i have thought of some things:  1.  patterns.  whenever i slump, i start writing again.  some stuff in the works, at least up in the cranial attic.  some stuff on paper/on file as well.  2.  queer eye.  i think i love it almost as much as law and order.  anyone see last night's?  i text-messaged jeff at a gig to tell him that jai and thom just smeared vaginal lube over each others hands and noses, as jai said, "well you can't have too much SPF!"  i can't think of a more clever, more witty, more on-the-money show, especially for a fag hag currently without the former.  (i'm accepting applications.)  3.  vegans.  do vegans swallow?  i realize the poor taste (oh crap, no pun intended) of that statement, but really... or do they forgo that act entirely to avoid any animal product ingestion?  it is a sincere question.  i respect anyone with discipline and faith enough to give up cheese and honey on principle alone.  i think i had more thoughts, but i can't remember them now.  i need a weekend in  urlLink lexington , with some good weather and plenty of meals at the blue heron.  or else a year in tahiti.

       A collection of stories from John Updike, ZZ Packer's debut collection, Caryl Phillips and Frederick Barthelme, and Tobias Wolff's first novel are all nominated for the PEN/Faulkner book awards.  I'm not a fan of Updike, I am vaguely familiar with Packer's stories from the New Yorker, and I don't know Phillips and Barthelme.  It's like the Oscars.  You root for the person you're most familiar with and read/see the others when you have time.  And if you aren't familiar with  urlLink Tobias Wolff , please go loan/buy his books now.   urlLink Yahoo! News - Updike, ZZ Packer Among Nominees for Fiction Award

       . . . to the stupid motherfucker who stole my debit card number and social security number:  Dear fuckface,  You're about to go away for some time, honeybuns.  You know why?  Because I've caught you.  (Well not really... I caught up with you momentarily because you were stupid enough to cancel your cell phone plan early and I got charged for it.)  Yes, I'm that Heather A. McDonald whose card number you used and whose social security number you used for a friggin cell phone.  I've called your cell phone provider, I've called my bank, I've called the credit bureaus, the Federal Trade Commission and the police and filed reports.  You, my dear, are going down.  I realize you thought you could get away with this.  But you can't.  You know why?  Because your mere $150 charge means a lot to me.  You know why?  Because I'm probably a lot like you--I'm young, and I don't make a big salary.  You know where I'm not like you?  I don't think its cool to take what's not mine.  I don't think its cool to rob people of their hard-earned cash.  I don't feel entitled to whatever technology comes my way.  You picked the wrong numbers to mess with, because they are mine, and I don't shut up easily.  So, jackass, if you're reading this, get ready for nine federal and local law enforcement agencies to be breathing down your lazy ass faster than you can say "PayPal."    You screwed up.  --hmcd

       chris wrote me a great comment pertaining to my post on the quiz.  here's what i say to him:  mmm celexa.  celexa is my friend and has been for some time.  i'm a big proponent of medication when used in conjunction with psychoanalysis and other forms of therapy, as well as alternative forms of therapy (yoga, acupuncture, biofeedback, etc).    i think a lot of doctors and patients alike think that SSRIs and other psychoactive drugs will simply cure them, like an antibiotic cures a case of strep throat.  that's one problem i have with my mom.  she takes her meds (which definitely make a huge difference), but if she has a bad day, she thinks she needs to have her dosage upped or her meds changed, when actually it just could be she had a bad day, or didn't work on her own reactions to the bad day.  awhile back i went off meds, thinking i could actively contain my "moods".  for four months i was doing great.  then i stayed up for two days and was hallucinating at work on the third, and scared the shit out of family and friends. meds can be a crutch, but when used as a form of treatment, they can make the other treatments more effective.   and that's what i gots to say about that.

       I've been listening to a constant stream of Sigur Ros and the Shins, circa  Oh Inverted World , which is slightly less happy than  Chutes Too Narrow , and Radiohead.  This soundtrack has created a world for me where I am on the verge of tears, or perhaps it was the other way around.  A few basic facts:  I live with my mother and grandmother, as I always have (pretty much).  As you can imagine, three generations of women under one roof can be tempestuous at times.  However when you combine a woman in denial, a woman who uses her illnesses as a crutch, and a frustrated young woman who is trying to get past her past and is still living in it at the same time… well it's a movie script in the making.  Laura Linney will play my mother, Sally Field will play my grandmother, and any suggestions for who should play me would be appreciated.  I'm thinking Clea Duvall, or possibly Rachel Leigh Cook.  Who knows.  Angelina Jolie is too old to play me, but too young to be my mom.  Maybe if I did a flashblack sequence…  Ok, hi, I'm the heroine.   Of course I'm biased.   Use your concept of the biased narrator, you silly English majors.  Anyhow, back to the story.  So three generations + massive dysfunctionality + anger simmering over time = World War III.  I'm usually pretty adept at dodging the dysfunctionality and coping with my feelings and their behavior (thanks Floyd!… played by Sam Waterston), but I totally, in sum, lost my shit. Blind rage aside, once again, I was told I am mean, ungrateful, lazy, spendthrift, miserable, and dress terribly.  So crying, screaming, slamming doors, saying things that were true but shouldn't been said to both moms and grams… like all wars, it was gruesome.  And in the midst of it all, I'm asked whether I'm on my meds and seeing my doc.  Check my insurance statements, motherfuckers.  Unlike my mother, I don't use my illnesses as a crutch.  I actively work to contain the fact that if I change my schedule much, don't sleep, or whatever, I run the risk of swinging into mania, or swinging into debilitating depression.  I work my ass off to be "normal", and I'm not given that credit by my family.    It's just like when I graduated college.  I survived the four toughest years of my life, and moms didn't want to send out graduation announcements because  "You really fucked up college"  and grams didn't want to send them because "It's asking people for money."  Neither are true (ok, maybe the latter).  We didn't do graduation lunch with Christine and her mom because my mother couldn't stand the thought of eating at a French restaurant (all those sauces were caloric), and two days later she's in the hospital nearly dead.  I get into one school and I'm told, "well certainly school X is more prestigious than school Y."  Actually, not really.  If you listened to a damn thing I said, you'd know by now.  So, done with self-righteous whining, I lock myself in my room, humiliated, embarassed, hurt, and angry, and start going through the classifieds.  If I move out, not only do I spend money I should be saving for school, but I hurt my family and I "lose".  I moved back home not only to save money but to repair relationships that were in disrepair.  That will be shot to hell if I move out in a rage.  However, if I stay, I continue to simmer in my anger, my family will continue to be angry at me for whatever I do or don't do, and in six months, some nice china might be broken at the rate we're going.   So either way, I'm fucked .    I'm very much aware of how much I owe my family for everything during the years.  I'm also aware that I'm sick of the damn guilt trips and I'm sick of not being able to realize my full potential because I'm treading water, trying to appease everyone and trying to get where I want to be emotionally, spiritually, and intellectually.   It all makes me feel sick.   Right now I'm just at home as little as possible, and in my room writing the rest of the time.    Special thanks to John, Liza and Megan who have been listening to me rant nonstop.  And all of this after finding out I'm  two-for-two on acceptances .  Seven more schools to go.

        The Scene:   My old office.  Hordes of 20-something ecological policy wonks everywhere.  Old paternal boss known for saying the wrong thing at the wrong time, but not as wrong as the guy under him, who is a lawsuit waiting to happen.   The characters:  my soon-to-be roommate, my good friend/previous supervisor, and boss dude.   Roommate:  Hey boss!  Guess what!  Heather and I are moving in together!  GF/PS:  I'm so excited for you guys!  Boss:   GREAT!  [Face darkens]  Is Heather medicated for her depression?  Because that could seriously affect your living situation. [Several heads around office, designed to be open to foster communication, turn.]   Roommate and GF/PS:  [dumbfounded.]   GF/PS:   I think that's really inappropriate, boss.   Roommate:   I agree.  OOOOH KAY.  First of all, some of this is my fault.  When I first came into the "Real World" at this office, I had just been diagnosed has suffering from chronic depression with hypomanic tendencies.  This means I'm slightly bipolar/manic depressive.  Highs and Lows.  Etc.   My shrink was adjusting my meds.  Prior to that I was diagnosed with "just" depression.    So.  Because of silly meds, I was falling asleep during work (including a Congressional hearing.  Oops).  I woke up late.  I'd get emotional.  I told my boss what was going on, in order for her to realize I wasn't flakey, just going through a rough patch.  She suggested I tell both bosses higher up.  So I did.  BAD IDEA.  Second in line boss once brought it up to a coworker of mine and a committee member at a dinner.  I wasn't even involved in their project.  I've only recently been able to not have an extreme urge to murder him lately any time I see him.  He has other issues.  His name is usually "dirty old man."  Boss-boss, paternal-boss, could relate, having been medicated himself for several years.  Which he discussed with me, and which I appreciate.   However, does anyone else not see how totally ina-fucking-propriate that comment is?!?!?!?!?!?   1.  My roommate and former supervisor/friend may not have known.  They did, luckily, and have been there in several situations for someone to lean on.  It kind a was an open secret, and I tend to be very open about the matter--I mean, hi, I'm blogging it--but nonetheless, I think I have a right to expect that my bosses will behave in professional manners and keep what we discussed in private as just that--  private  .  2.  Other people overheard, probably some I don't want knowing my personal business.  3.  Well there is no three.  I covered my points.  I really glad that my two close friends were on the receiving end of that conversation, instead of god-knows-who.  It makes me wonder who else has been privy to that information.  I learned my lesson though.  In this office, the only person who knows for sure what my deal is and what my happy pills are is my friend Megan, who was friend first and then hired.    It's disgusting that this can happen.  I justifiably discussed my medical history because I was naive, as well as so I wouldn't get fired.     This is why mental illness stays a dirty little secret.  No one would say, Will your roommate's chemo affect you?  No one would say, How will your roommate being on antibiotics affect you?  Same thing with my chemical imbalance.   (And yes.  I am taking my meds.  I've only been off once before, when I was out of that office.  It was okay for four months.... and then it got crazy, which is why I'm back on.)

       Throughout college, I had big black glasses.  Not geek-chick, not emo-style, but big, cheap black plastic frames that bordered on the downright ugly.  Why?  Because anything more (or less) would have been unfitting to my college personality (college radio and English major, coffee and cigarettes, yet hung with some frat guys, and of course, snarky before it had been a word.)    I found out during my senior year that a certain group of frat guys-- whom I did not know-- knew me as "sexy librarian girl."  No name, no identification, no affiliations, just "sexy librarian girl."  (No I am not putting photos up.)  I took a sense of pride in being a symbol of hottness for the minority non-sorority, non-generic, non-total-nerd group on my campus.    And here, Tina Fey does it big time.

       Way back when I was really crazy, I had a class with one of my favorite professors on literature and existentialism.  My end report combined Heidegger, Nietzsche, Blake, Dosteyevsky, Kierkegaard, and Sartre.  Before I start being attacked in the comments section with flames like "You pompous emo existentialist all-black wearing liberal intelligensia pinko commie whore," let me explain.  I haven't read this in a while, and I'm going to go back and read it once this current paper I'm doing is finished.  The night before it was due, I had stayed up for something like 36 hours on end (it pales in comparison to the time I stayed up for 2 weeks.  Another day, another distraction, another entry).  Those 36 hours were spent immersed in analyzing those philsophers, as well as whatever I was trying to prove.  I floated into my prof's office the next day, claiming I had found enlightenment, at which point I knew I had to stop writing, or else I was going to die for being a puny mortal having found this secret.  Kind of tongue in cheek, but kind of not.  (So I was a little manic.  Let it go, people.)  It's like a runner's high, when you get into that mental groove when you're writing, be it a paper, or poetry or whatever.  I miss it.  I'm kinda getting into that with this paper, but its near impossible to work uninterrupted when you live with family.  But this can definitely help.  " urlLink Psychedelic Dreams " is a sweet sweet mix that is getting me into where I need to be on the office space paper.  (I'll post a link to the paper when I'm done, if I like it.)  NB: When I post and my formatting is lacking, it's because I'm working at home on my iBook.  I loves my iBook muchly, but the Blogger interface doesn't support Mac (or vice versa) very well and the automatic HTML buttons are missing.  And I'm lazy in learning HTML.  GMail also doesn't support Mac yet, which is a pain since I switched over... the yahoo address is still working but email me to find out what the GMail addy is.

       As I’ve been glued to a small card table in the back of my grandmother’s living room, writing and researching for two days now, I have been enjoying the greatness of Internet radio.  I was rocking and writing to  urlLink 3WK  Radio, and then to my local NPR affiliate’s Sunday programming.  I listened to an hour-long show,  urlLink Speaking of Faith , that featured an  urlLink interview with Thich Nhat Hanh .  I am familiar with him, but had never read any of his spiritual teachings.  About midway through the interview, he said that  “the kingdom of god is not a place with no suffering... in such a place they have no ways to learn to be understanding and compassionate.  The kingdom of God is where there is understanding and compassion, which mean there is suffering”  (paraphrased from the show).  He also said that  “suffering and happiness are organic, like flowers and garbarge.”   One turns into another, which turns into another.  These ideas made me smile and gave me an incredible sense of well-being.  In the past five days, my life has gone from teetering and unsure to calm and more sure-footed.  I have decided (*finally*) on  urlLink American University’s MFA Program , of which I am both excited, pleased, proud and incredibly glad to be a part of this coming fall.  Sent in the paperwork, signed the forms, stamped and mailed them off.  WHEEEEE!     I found an apartment and a roommate, both of whom are light-filled and open (tee hee).  There I will have room for writing, and laughter, and yoga, and most of all, room to breathe. . . and room for flowers (and garbage too).  I also quite directly emailed a very old friend of mine, with whom, sometime in the past two years, I had a falling out.  I’m hoping it gets us talking about the great big elephant between us, whose existence we fail to acknowledge.  Nonetheless, I feel more at peace just knowing that I have called attention, and apologized (rightly so) for my wrong actions in the past.  There are also some other less-bloggable items (I want some privacy, despite my exhibitionist tendencies) that made me very happy.  Clearing the air is always good.  So are wonderful significant others who never cease to amaze you in their own ways.  I’m currently hauling ass on the office space paper, which is suddenly incorporating far too much Kant for my liking.  I’ve spent the day wading through  urlLink Casey  and the MOMA’s book on  urlLink Workspheres  (soon to be a coffee-table favorite, along with Mary Kay’s autobiography...) and my bwain hoits.  So I’m keeping this relatively short.  American it is, and to all a good night.

       Cathy wrote  urlLink this :    Don't kill me dude, but...why don't you just get a shit job and start writing? I'm working in a gardening warehouse part-time and am learning lots. For one thing, I'm seeing once again how out of touch I am with a huge chunk of the wage-earning world.   Just this reader's unfiltered response.  And if you really want to go to grad school, just pick one and commit to it. You'll find what there is to find wherever you end up. You're already a good writer. You don't need some fancy schmance grad school to teach you. You just need to fucking do it.  See what happens when you post things on the internet for everyone to read?   It is a valid point.   Why am I doing a graduate program for creative writing?   In the first place, I want guidance.  I have never spent time solely on my writing, and I see this as a good way to start.  However, I still feel like I'm at the base of a mountain, and that with some guidance I'll get to the top.  The top symbolizes getting to that "level," fulfilling that potential that I know I have.  I need a writing support group, which I don't feel like I have.  I don't know lots of writers anymore, and the ones I do are not in close contact with me any more.  Doing an MFA program helps to solve that problem.  Also, I've been out of school for three years.  I recommend that everyone delay a grad program for a few years until he or she has worked in "the real world."  I 've worked shit jobs; I've barwenched, sold t-shirts, barista'd, and temped.  The only things they allow me to do is bore and tire me, and make me hate humanity.   I like my jobs to foster a sense of creativity in me, that flows through the rest of the day.  Now I'm in public relations.  My current job is getting that way, since I write and edit and promote during the 9-5.  While in grad school I may quit my current full-time job to do freelance tutoring and editing and writing, but for now, this works for me.  As I've said before,  I have never thought I needed a degree to write.  I do need a degree to teach at most places.   I do find it unsettling that you describe it as a "fancy schmance grad school."  Some people do degrees because they have nothing else to do; I'm getting mine because I have lots to do and see it as a way of reaching my goals.  No one needs to "teach" me  how  to write.  I'm seeking guidance and support, which is what fits me.    So Cathy, I hope that makes sense to you.  It does to me.  I think your approach is what works for you, and I applaud any writer who does whatever he or she can do to write.  But know this--that's what I'm doing too.  P.S.  Re: the blogging wrath of heather:  I only verbally assault those who piss me off with stupid, irrational, unresearched and/or unfunny comments.  Disagreement does not necessarily count as any of those--in fact, I really hope whoever disagrees or has other opinions to share does post them, because I like replying to them.  However, if you accuse me of a missing payment, or ask why I don't have nudie girl pics up, prepare for some serious shock&awe.

        "in regards to dc, i've been reading henry's blog for a while now. his blog leads to me to some of his dc friends' blogs. they all have this "would the last person out of dc please turn off the lights" mentality. i'm curious.  urlLink  what do you guys not like about dc?   i spent a summer there in college and loved it. i'm there a couple weeks a year for work and always enjoy the capital more than NYC or detroit."   Dear Jamie,   Yes, there is a Santa Clause.   I mean, oh wait, wrong response.    It's true.  A lot of people hate D.C., and many have valid reasons.  JFK described it once as a city possessing Northern charm and Southern efficiency.  I don't think anyone could put it better.  It's smaller than NYC, and larger (I think) than Detroit.  It's beautiful in the spring and snow, though I think most cities are.  However, the transiency of D.C.'s population has left it with a fickle sense of being; most people move here for a job, usually with the feds, and then leave after a few years.  They bring with them a sense of idealism and leave with a bad taste in their mouths.  The people who have lived here for several generations are either extremely wealthy (Think Georgetown and upper Northwest), or extremely poor (Think Trinidad, Ivy City, and most of Anacostia).  More and more, there is no in-between living standard, much like New York.  Only we don't have New York's established cultural superiority--all we've got is politics.  And if that's your thing, good for you.  This is the place to be.  If it's not your thing, you're kinda screwed.    As a visitor you don't necessarily get the whole story, mainly because you don't see yourself as the gawking tourist D.C.'ers love to hate.  (Not saying that you wear short shorts with white knee socks and a camera around your neck, but you know what I mean....)  D.C. is not a state.  Whether you agree with statehood or think the region should stay a federal colony, it is true that the city continues to have serious management problems, especially for paying high taxes (to a non-state) without getting many benefits out of it.  Residents are essentially all tourists or squatters.  The money they pay in taxes goes for a corrupt school system and city government.  The water is lethal.  The metro goes nowhere.  The streets are potholed and terrible.  The rats are the size of Arnold Schwartzenegger.    However, as much as I bitch and moan about D.C.,  I'm considering staying .  I grew up around here, and I'm one of the few who moves into the city and leaves the burbs behind.  There is a history to the place that you can't find in a lot of other places.  A cultural scene has been slow to bloom, but it is budding.  As more people consider staying as  a means to change the area, we can create our own sense of place rather than just being pissed off about it all the time--which is what I'm thinking about.    So dear Jamie, there are good and bad things to D.C., like every city.  I want D.C. to be less of a stop-off for young professionals, and more of a place where people decide to stay.  Only thing is, there are a lot of changes that have to successfully be made to do that.  Sincerely,  Heather (a closeted New Yorker)

       Ok, so it's not that late for normal people, but if I am one thing, it is not normal.  Or something.  I can't sleep.  I keep going back and forth between my two options.  (some clarification here)   School A) top-notch, hard-ass program with high-profile writers.  I thought, "Oh the things I could do here," but with a strange uncomfortable feeling in the pit of my stomach.  not uncomfortable as in fear, but like something was wrong.  School B) hard-ass program with less high-profile writers (but all respected in their own rights) with a more nuturing sensibility.  felt really good about it.  felt like i belonged   Fuck.   So much for a sort of decision.  I'm afraid if I say no to the program elsewhere, I'll always wonder if I could have done it.  I'm afraid if I say no to the program here, I'll be slashing my wrists in a year and a half.  Meh.  On the bright side, Doc Conlin just reminded me of a great saying.  " Don't sweat the petty things, and don't pet the sweaty things."   Or, as he said, " Don't sweat the petty things, pet the sweaty things ."  Eew.  Also, my flipflops broke Saturday night, and I bought rubber tooth-paste turquoise flip flops at Rite-Aid to get me through the evening.  There were some evil skinny bitches givin' me the eye for wearing them too.     Hos.  The lot of them.

       I visited one campus and their MFA program today.  Tomorrow, another.  Here's the deal:  I am someone who regularly knows exactly what she wants.  I can dilly-dally all day long (or polly-wolly-doodle, if you prefer), but in the end if I just sit for a moment quietly, I can usually hear myself think.  When I take a long time to make a decision, it is usually not because I'm carefully weighing evidence--it's because it's too noisy (internally or externally) for me to ponder what is the right thing to do.  This is true in all aspects of my life.  Relationships (friends, boyfriends, family), writing, domiciles, jobs, clothing, makeup, ordering food and/or bar drinks.... if i hesitate and have trouble making a decision it's generally a) because I'm tired, b) because I'm being obnoxious and I have that tendency or c) I'm in a state regulated by drugs, legal or illegal or both.  I am somehow refusing myself to let myself make the damn decision.  Why?  Apparently I'm in love with drama.  (Hey!  I heard that snicker!)  I feel like staying in D.C. is somehow a cop-out.  I've wanted out for *so* long, and now I have that option--plus the option to attend an excellent program--and suddenly I feel like staying in the city (clarification: city proper, not the 'burbs) is the right decision.  I was absolutely positively overwhelmed to my positive reaction to the school I visited today.  Met the directors of the program, some students (including a friend of mine already there), and some program staff.  Walked around the campus.  Realized that like with all Metro stops, its nowhere near campus to which it lays claim.  I had a ridiculously picture-perfect day to visit, since the sky was halcyon blue, the grass, well, grass-green, and the flowers in technicolor hues of yellow, orange and pink.  And I said.... yes.  But as I have a hotel room booked for tomorrow night, and meetings with various writers et al tomorrow, in a city I've never been to, I'll just say I'm still thinking.

       So usually if I mention an award or news of special commendation, it pertains to poetry or fiction (or maybe something in my soon-to-be-field of creative nonfiction).  However, my post is a little teensy weensy bit about poetry, and alot about some kick-ass journalism.  Anthony Shadid is a Washington Post Foreign Correspondent whose work I began reading last year.  Disgruntled by either the traditional journalism tactics being used by embedded reporters (who were/are not in traditional situations), and further disgruntled by the alternative media's "reporting," I began reading Shadid's articles to fully understand what was going on in Iraq.  In his articles, he conveyed what seemed like snapshots of every day Iraqi life during wartime.  These were not the Iraqis of Saddam's courts, nor those in Fallujah now taking hostages or fighting the Americans (if they really are Iraqis and not outsiders or mercenaries).  Shadid was not embedded with troops, but instead went from home to home, living with Iraqi families and relaying what he wrote back to the Post.    It was a breathe of fresh air, and a badly needed one.  Stories of tactics tell only the war strategy, not the human toll, and much of war reporting has been skewed to either support or non support the administration's stances---with little regard to the actualities of war.  Shadid's reporting however gave photographic quality to the war's effects on people like you and me.  Furthermore, his writing is at times poetic, which is why I started working on turning his articles into "found poetry."  This is often a poor excuse for poetry, and results in cheap imitations of the art.  I often do it when I have writers' block, so I'm at least playing with words, sounds, rhythm, etc. (Many writers do translations for this purpose.  I unfortunately speak no other languages, cad that I am.)  However his images, words and lyricism lent themselves wonderfully to poetry, and became another way of providing images of this increasingly madcap, horrific, absurdist war.  (My words, not his).  All I can say is how glad I am that such an excellent writer and reporter earned recognition.  Journalism gets such a shitty rap these days, most of the time for valid reasons (can we say plagiarism?).  It's good to know that there are reporters still out there, beyond  urlLink my journalism professors , who give the biz a good name.

       Anyone who has ever watched a good docu-drama knows the importance of repressed memories.  I'm sure I have some of my own that I don't even know I have.  (Yes.)  But what about imagined memories?  I'm cleaning my room and trashing things, all things--papers, knick-knacks, barettes, half-burnt sticks of incense--preparing for my impending departure in the next few months.  (No *where* just yet.)  It's rainy, cold, and I'm listening to Iron & Wine.  Spent the weekend with great people, new friends and very old friends.  And here I sit, dissatisfied, wondering why I slept past noon and didn't go to mass with my family, or have their Easter baskets ready, like in the old days.  But then, those pretty Easters with new dresses, and hiding eggs, and chocolate bunnies, well those perfect Episcopalian-blonde Easters never really happened around here.  At the end of the winter I was usually just emerging from hibernation.  My mother was on whatever rollercoaster she decided to have jumped on.  A few years ago she stopped eating for Lent.  Granted, it was a lot deeper than seemingly pious Catholic zeal, but by June she was hospitalized.  Last year I rolled in around 5 a.m. high as a kite, having scared the crap out of my family for never calling.  They missed mass that Easter.  So instead of sitting here moping about the rain, I'm thinking about "Jesus the friend of the weak," accepting my dissastisfaction with organized religion and thinking more and more about why I turned my back on God years ago, this time when I was fourteen.  I thought God had turned a blind eye to me after several unfortunate events.  That Easter mass I began to refuse to go to church.  I told God I didn't believe and I was ok with it, even though I really wasn't.  I'm not as lost as I thought I was, but I know now it was nothing personal.  I still don't know what I believe, and I hate labels, so don't throw the term Agnostic at me.  So as I clean house, I'm cleaning my mind, preparing it for the next stage of my life---which, for all intensive purposes, will be determined within the next three weeks.  There are no Easter baskets here, but I'm kinda glad there are none.    Thank goodness for lavendar-scented bio-safe cleanser.

       Alright, alright.  I was shot in the thigh with a heavy dose of spring fever yesterday, and thank goodness.  I went running yesterday. . . for the first time since college.  My shoes arrived, I put them on when I got home and I ran out the door.  About half a mile later I was winded and had side splints, but whatever.  I walked it off and spent some time around a nearby park.  It's one of the few places I truly adore in my neighborhood.  The horticultural center located on the park had finished planting for the early spring season, so the bulbs were in full bloom.  Narcissi of all sizes and colors were popping up, as were tulips, snowdrop, croci (pl. of crocus), hyacinths large and small, phlox, violets, pansies, johnny-jump-ups and a gorgeous flowering quince.  (To anyone who knows where I can find a flowering quince, please contact me!  I would love a potted one or one in a yard or what not.)  Then, when I was on my way home, I saw a black squirrel romping across a neighbor's yard.  I rarely see black squirrels, and he was a cute one.  When I got home, I couldn't remember why I was so tense, or why I stopped running years ago.    I did, however, remember why I liked running.

       Liza says my life is screwy because Mercury is in retrograde, and all Aquarians are feeling it right now.  Astrologist  urlLink Susan Miller  agrees:   The exact dates of Mercury's backward slide will be from April 6 to April 30, but its affects have been apparent since March. . . .   Communication problems arise under this aspect, too, so it is not wise to sign contracts with Mercury retrograde, nor is it a good time to accept a new job. If you are looking for a job or a new apartment (not likely by your chart, but in case you are), see if you can give your final decision in May rather than in April.   When Mercury is retrograde, it is like trying to walk through a blizzard. It's nearly impossible to see where you are going, and the wind keeps pushing you back. You could go off course without realizing it and wind up in another country! After you work with Mercury retrograde for a while, you will recognize that, no matter how perfect a new opportunity may seem, there is almost always something wrong with a situation that arises when Mercury's in its backward orbit. Unfortunately, you often don't notice such flaws until well after you have made your choice. . . .  If you have sent in an application for a college or graduate school, you should get good news in your mailbox during the same full moon period, near April 5. The same is true if you took an exam and are anxious to know the results. Some Aquarians work in academia. If that includes you, you might hear some good news about your career on this full moon. If you want an answer on just about any question involving your work, ask on April 4 or April 5.    Riiiight.  And you say this stuff isn't true!  In other news, my stress from yesterday has been taken care of.  The documents were officially emailed and confirmed received.  I checked some other things.  Found my signature request slip from the admissions dept, signed and dated for these items.  Searched online and saw all my items had been received end of December and entered into the "system" end of January.   All of them.   Anyhow.  If you're bored at work from 3:30 p.m. on and have extra bandwidth, listen in on the webcast on  urlLink Health Literacy .  ADDENDUM AS OF 4:20 p.m.  Heheheh.  I said 4:20.  Um, yeah so I was planning on partaking in the  urlLink Blogorama on Kalorama , courteously posted by  urlLink Andrew , but now I can't make it.  So while your favorite panicky blogger will not be there, you should go, meet cool people, and drink one for me.

       If I have to wait any more, I'll gouge my eyes out with my hand-carved wooden crochet hook.  I have a problem with waiting.  It's not so much that I'm impatient, though I am.  Somehow I have a deep seated fear that waiting = not hearing at all.  It's a backhanded rejection rooted in waiting on Sundays for the sperm-donor to show up and never knowing whether he would or not.  (Talk to my shrink for further Jungian details.)  And this horrible horrible horrible anxiety surround waiting has taken new meaning.  I am having nightmares, or panic attacks in my dreams, or something.  Friday night, I dreamt that both Lindsey and I were pregnant, like 8 months into it.  She was crocheting, and we were sitting in rocking chairs on, what I'm assuming, is her porch in New Orleans.  I was flipping out.  Somehow I wanted it all to stop.  "I can't be pregnant!  I can't!  This ruins everything!!!" I kept screaming.  And Lindsey, in her loving earth-mothery way, was planning how our kiddies would be best friends, and how everything works out for the best.  Now, I am not preggers.  Nuh-uh.  No way.  Some people have interpreted the baby part as giving birth to a new creative project or a new chapter of my life.  But then why am I fighting it?  Nevertheless, I repeatedly dreamt that Friday night/Saturday morning, and woke up in cold sweats.   Saturday night, after a lovely day including brunching with Dan-Dan-the-Weatherman (my best friend from high school and prom date, turned Ph.D. student extraordinaire), and coffee and shopping with Vaness and Pat, and John, I.  Flipped. Out.  I went from laughing hysterically to sobbing so hard my face swelled up like a pregnant woman's ankles.  And for what?  No reason other than I'm a big nasty ball of anxiety.  Just to freak out John and myself and convince everyone that I truly am nuts.  Slept very little that night, which may have been due to not being able to breathe.  Several work projects, family, current class, mix-ups and missed deadlines for admissions into MFA programs, trips, appointments, scheduled events.... when does it all calm down?  I'm not asking for the world to stop.  I just want to be able to breathe again.  I did order a pair of running shoes today however.  Rightly so, I've been told by several people to start working out.  This time of year I especially miss the  urlLink Woods Creek Trail  I used to run (ahem, jog or walk) down in Lexington.  But no worries, I've got Rock Creek Park (of course, during daylight and with a partner), and the Mall.  Something's gotta give, even if it's more like dynamiting it out of my way instead of just gently pushing.  ADDENDUM:  Something did give.  The nice nice person from that glorious university where I want admission called me back after speaking with me yesterday.  What happened?  They never got my portfolio, despite that someone signed off on the package.  Nice nice director told me to keep breathing and not to panic because they had not decided on anything yet, and that I could email him everything.  I still panicked and stopped breathing, and called John and Vanessa and screamed in my office, but I do appreciate that admissions and the MFA department didn't just say "Fuck this slacker" and nix me from the pile.  But, I'm still upset.  How can two universities officially screw up like this?  Granted they are handling it with grace, and I appreciate it greatly.  When talking with Vanessa she told me that 30% of her applications got screwed up by the admissions offices of the schools where she applied.    Dude.  It is SO wrong.

       As it seems to be rather uncivilized to scream my fool head off in the office (where it would freak out several coworkers), or in the house (where it would make my grandmother have a heart attack), or in traffic (where I would be unfairly cited for road rage), or walking along where (where I might be arrested and/or committed to a psych ward), here goes a scream into the blogosphere:  AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH.  That is all for now.  More later when I sort out my head, enter a space where I don't want to murder everyone I encounter, and stop having panic attacks whenever I start to think about this summer and fall.  That being committed thing actually doesn't sound too bad. Wouldn't that mean I get Valium, or at least Ativan or Xanax?  (4/7/04: I edited the scream for blog-clarity.  But I agree with Mike's comment, it seems to make a good point.)

       Yeah.  It's that kind of day.  To start, my stomach is killing me.  It's raining, and I got to deal with my "missing" payment.  Just a moment ago, a woman came back and harrassed my coworker Megan about "press packets" and "abstracts" for a lecture going on today.  She couldn't remember who she spoke with, or which office.  Megan was unclear about what she was referring to, and came and got me.  The woman then came and found us, to which I told her, we don't have "press packets" for meetings we don't organize.  She stomped off muttering about stupid press offices and how she wasn't impressed.  Hmm, let's see.  1) You don't know which office or person you spoke with.  2) There is one hour of this lecture thingy going on today.  3)  You're nuts.  None of which are my problems!  Be gone, hag!

       When stumbling around the GMU Student Accounts Access site, I see that not only has my payment not been credited, but that I have a late fee.  Um, excuse me?  I may drop serious-ass cash on unnecessary items at times, but I also know that I shelled out that check for the last half of my tuition for this semester's class, and that the check was cashed a week ago.  I call, someone tells me to fax over proof (which includes the print-out from my bank statement, she says).  Then I find this in my email inbox today:   Subject: Your "missing" payment!    Dear Heather:  We received your fax. . . regarding your check that hasn't been applied to your account.  For us to research this, we need a copy of the front and back of the negotiated check from your bank.  Please provide that to my attention.  Signed, XXX    My  "missing"  payment?  Yeah.  Ok.  Quotation marks, my ass.  I'll be sure to send y'all the invoice for the $2 fee I'm being charged to get a copy of the cancelled check.  And oh yeah, what's with the spam-esque subject?  I almost deleted it.    So I just wrote this and sent it:   Ms. XXX,  Just wanted to let you know that I just got off the phone with my bank regarding my "missing" payment, and today they are mailing me an official copy of my cancelled check, indeed cancelled by the GMU Cash Office.  This process should take about 3-5 days, depending on the post office.  I hope no added and unjustified fees will be added to my account because of the delay.    Again, please let me know which fax number I should send this to, or if you would prefer certified mail (which I can send you the invoice), or if you would prefer I present it to you in person (which would mean me taking off half a day from work, which I could also send you the invoice for lost pay).  The bank is also charging me $2 for this service--shall I send your office the invoice?    Thanks for your prompt attention to this matter regarding a very (no quotation marks necessary) missing payment.  --Heather McDonald   GRRRRRRRRRRRRR!

       Man oh man.  I finally got around to seeing Mean Girls last night, with the lovely ladies Leah (soon-to-be roommate and Mary Kay pusher) and Liza (previously my pimp, now the bird lady of Georgetown).  This is the smartest, truest movie about the social structure of high school (and college, if you went to W&L or another small, preppy, wealthy liberal arts school).  Seriously though, that mix of love/hate/awe/disgust that surrounds the "it" girls is inexplicable yet dangerous.  The movie was so witty and well-written, and I almost peed myself whenever Amy Poehler would prance about as the "cool mom."  I'm pre-ordering it once it is available on DVD.    Prepping for my friends Pat and Vanessa's wedding this weekend in Toronto.  I'm not in the wedding party, but as a reader, I'm doing all the rehearsal stuff, which is essentially a big-ass pre-party.  It's a big deal to me, because back in the days when Vanessa and Pat were just friends, she would call me and talk about how she think she had a crush on him, but was pretty sure he didn't.  In the meantime, my friends who were close to Pat were saying the same thing about him.  Meanwhile, they drove cross country prior to our senior year in college, and BAM! they started dating.  It RULES!  I can't think of two better people to be matched up and I can't think of two people I'm happier for.... it's so rare these days where people get hitched because they see their lives more as business mergers, or because they are so lonely they can't think of anything better to do.  See  urlLink Jeff  for more on this topic.  Seriously though, these two will be old and grey and goofy together, and I'm glad, because then I can still hang out with both of them and corrupt their children.  ("Back in the day, your mom was so drunk this one night that...")  Had an interesting session with the shrink yesterday.  (Of  course  I see a shrink regularly, do you not know me better than that, dear anonymous blog-reader?!)     Ever since driving the car through the yard, I have felt so  free .   The one constant in most of my psychological history is that I feel trapped (see post below).  Not like "Oh I'm stuck here," but, "Oh my god, I'm going to live with my family the rest of my life and constantly have a curfew even when I'm 40 and everyone will move upwards and onwards in life but me because I'll be playing scrabble every night at 7:30 p.m. with the fam because I'll not be able to leave..."   Emotional blocks are huge and take a lot of work to dissolve or at least shrink.   While unconventional, I found a loophole in my crazy family and drove right through it.  It has been a huge improvement to my psychological issues, beyond me moping about because of my dumb job.  (But that may change soon.)  Anyhow.  Onwards and upwards.  Toronto this weekend, possibly a day trip to Lexington next week.... blogging will most likely be minimal unless there is Wi-Fi to be found.

       I got an email from my friend Micah this morning, who has been in Shenyang, China (near the North Korean border), for over a year now.  He was teaching English to little 6 year olds, a thought which never ceased to crack me up.  (I can only imagine the tots trying to wrap their tongues around the words "Bald Soprano" as Micah tries not to laugh.)   right now in shanghai i am returning to the states tomorrow after finishing a month and a half of travelling around china with my girlfriend. went to beijing, then trained down 30 hours to the sichuan province and visited chengdu (a place of temples and teahouses) emei shan (a medieval timewarp of a mountain covered with small active buddhist monestaries and rascally thieving and violent wild monkies) and then leshan (home of the biggest buddha sculpture in the world) and then jiuzhaigou, beautiful wildlife and nature reserve in the remote north of the province, then down to yunnan province to hang out with my matriarchs in lijiang, home of the naxi ethnic minority (a matriarchal society), and then out to zhongdian (the beginning of the tibet world, yak butter tea, yak milk, yak meat, and a lot of yaks, and people yakking in dialects i didn't understand) then back down to dali, this ancient sleepy town where you can pick your own marijuana and which is home to the bai people another ethnic minority and where it rained and rained and rained for three days flooding the streets and souring the faces of the city's millions of homeless cats, and then into kunming for a couple of days, neglected to see the stone forest because i was too depressed because my girlfriend had to go back to shenyang to resume her journalism studies so i sat in the hotel room and drank little bottles of burbon and watched nba basketball and chinese warrior soap operas and took long hot showers and crapped with the door open while i filled in the last pages of my yearlong journal, and then a couple of days ago i flew into shanghai and have been to the bund waterfront and the shanghai museum and while these places are all very impressive the truth is i am very very weary and travelworn these days and i have lost a fair amount of weight and i basically just want to go home for a while and speak to people in my language and not have to worry about people calling me a white ghost or a foreign devil or harry potter because i am white and wear glasses or telling me to go home because the united states government decided to sell a one point two billion dollar missle radar detection system to taiwan or people staring at me when i walk down the street or being so condescending as to spend ten solid minutes explaning to me the intricate workings of a water faucet the red is hot the blue is cold or people distrusting me and charging me exorbitantly high prices because i wear a cutsie yellow fannypack that makes me look like i've got one of those big piledrivin asses that only an american could have and being american in china means one thing to the chinese: money.    I adore Micah and can think of no other person more capable for these journeys.  But, being human and in a constant state of 20-something misery, I am also insanely jealous.  If anyone told me three years ago that I would be working an administrative job still in D.C. and still living with my family, I would have offed myself for good back then.  Someone once told me, "You know what your problem is?  You're too  responsible .  Let loose, go live a little."    But I can't... I have too many responsibilities here.....  He was right.    All I know is that I don't want to turn 30 and still be in the same place doing the same thing.    I got five years.

       Only one week into it, and I'm tired of the "Washingtonienne" scandal.  If you don't know about it, consider yourself lucky.  I'm not linking to her or anything about it because I don't feel like supporting her egotrip beyond the rest of the post.  It was interesting while shrouded in secrecy.  It does make for a fabulous story: young Hill staffer gets around and gets paid.  But coming out three days after being fired in the Post and Wonkette?  Come on!  Live a little!  Keep the world guessing!    My problems with this "scandal":  1.  $400 for sex is no more than your mid-level streetwalker (who is not an addict).  Heidi Fleiss and her women got paid WAY more, and HF demanded respect because she was *smart.*   A good businesswoman is a good businesswoman, be you Mary Kay Ash or a financial-saavy hooker.  2.  You're moving to the Big Apple because someone will hire you for a sex scandal?  OK, in the New York of Tina Brown,  maybe .  MAYBE.  If you couldn't cut it on $25 K a year in DC, you sure as hell can't cut it on an editorial assitant or intermediate-level editor's salary in NYC.  This story is small potatoes for most NYC gossip, my dear.  So you blogged for three weeks about how you slept with lots of guys and they paid you (gifts my ass,  no pun intended)?   Big deal.   3.  Everyone knows what Hill staffers make.  They make shit and do shit for work.  That's D.C. low-level policy staffer/Hill staffer/intern life.  If you want the big bucks, go into investment banking, or hooking, full time.    4.  Her fame will be so shortlived, just like her blog.  You made it into the Reliable Source on a Sunday?  You'll be a nobody by Saturday.  Try not to take it personally.  I really wish it had gone on all summer, but she's taken all the fun out of it.  I love a good sex scandal as much as anyone, but at least do it while Congress is in session and before an election.

       Rarely do I say the 'burbs have something the city lacks, but today, as I sit at home and go through boxes upon boxes of Kleenex and bottles of Robitussin, I know now that Northern Virginia definitely has something D.C. lacks (beyond congressional representation):  Cicadas.  They are everywhere.  Monday night, most people I spoke with joked about the nonexistant cicadas.    "You wanna know why you don't see any?" I asked.  "Because they are all in my goddamn yard, that's why!"  I'm not kidding.  Our rose bush has at least one on every leaf.  The scotch broom, while a wiry, hardy brush-type plant, is nearly bent over because there are so many of them.  They cover the wisteria and lilac vines with their little tan shells and their red beady eyes and green bodies cling to the leaves.    They drop out of the oak trees and hit you on the shoulders or on your head and flit about and try to detangle themselves from your hair as you squeal over the ickiness of it all.  They are covering the tires of Otis and I can't even bear to look at them after I drive it because it is covered in more goo than caused by my allergies/cold/sinus infection trio.  And they are so goddamned loud, it's like my house is in some-sort of fantastic sound net, where the government is trying to make us all go crazy with white noise.  It sounds like a babbling brook that took too much meth.  I can hear it over the t.v., the stereo, even NPR.    Yes, Washingtonians and others lacking cicadas, they have arrived.    And they are all crashing at my place.

        I've returned to being a semi-social entity.     I spent most of Saturday evening with an old college friend who is finally out of the closet, at least with most people.  I don't think I have ever understood exactly how fearful it must be to go up against family, friends and societal norms and admit to the world that your bedroom tendencies are different than mine, or yours, or his or hers.  I know what it's like to admit that you're a bit nutty, but I don't think it really compares in the end.  Combine normal in-the-closet levels of panic with being at a fabulously anti-gay, anti-open-minded, super frat-tastic campus and what do you get?  A whole campus of repressed and frightened individuals.  Anyhow, I'm really proud of him and all of his friends who have come out within the past few years, since graduation.  Plus, this gives me new fags with which to hag.  Thank goodness, too...I was gettin' lonely, boys.  Later that night met up with John's college friends, some of whom just moved into town for internships this summer.   It's one of the best feeling in the world when you like your boyfriend's friends.   It's going to be a really drunk summer, let's just put it at that.  Last night, met up with Chris at Sparky's, and then met up with Joanne at Cafe Nema with lots of other people who I thought merely existed in cyberspace.  A big enough crowd to meet and greet, network a bit, but not so big it was overwhelming.  Was mistaken for a waitress at one point as well, by someone who when realizing her mistake, was thoroughly embarassed.  I just thought it was funny.  Also got to be antisocial with Andrew for part of the time, which is always time well spent.    All of this made me realize exactly how wonderful my move will be.  I know I know, I won't shut up about it.  But soon, I will be 2 minutes away from everyone and everything, and I will have a fully functioning oldskool Nintendo set with which to kick ass.  It's on, motherfuckers.  For now, though, I'm sitting at my desk, answer calls and suffering from a sore throat and head cold, so that's what I get for being  urlLink social .  Bah!

       It is our civic duty to wear these shirts.  I read about it on the  urlLink Washington Post's  front page:   Here comes Sarah Shain, typical Metro rider. The 22-year-old District resident is hustling down the left side of the escalator to the lower platform at Metro Center, clacking on the moving metal steps in her sensible pumps, until she hits a roadblock: a pair of tanned tourists in shorts standing two abreast, talking and blocking her path to the Orange Line train idling at the bottom of the escalator.     "The train is right there and you see the doors closing and it's like, 'Get out of my way!' " said Shain, a behavioral and social researcher who missed that train by seconds.   Then, a moment of empathy. "A lot of the people who visit here come here from Middle America where there is no subway, so they're not used to it," said Shain, who grew up in Kentucky. "You have to just expect that if you live in this city. You have to deal with the tourists."    Seriously though, how many times has that happened to you?  I'm a fast walker, and while I can handle being stuck in traffic for periods of time, I have extreme difficulty navigating tourists with nine screaming children, especially on a day with a migraine.    And, though people claim ignorance, there are signs posted on each of the escalators in most of the Metro stations.  "Stand right, walk left."  It's just like traffic.  Now shut up and get your nine screaming children out of my way.  I have to get to my piddling, nothing job so I can blog all day.

       I've done some ballsy things before but today took the cake.    I got home about an hour later than I predicted yesterday.  I had planned on helping my mom and grandmother plant some scotch broom (a relative of the heather plant), and a mini crepe myrtle in the front garden.  I came home, apologized for running late and getting stuck in traffic.  So, I go out to help.  My mother, incensed that I promised to be home at noon and came in at one, tells me to fuck off.  I try to reason with her and she goes off.  I mean, we started a tug-of-war in the middle of the front yard with a heavy old shovel.  And instead of being the rational good adult I tend to be, I lose my shit.    I tend to cry when I'm angry.  So I start sobbing... the big, breatheless type with tears that blind you.  I grabbed my keys and got in my car.  The driveway was blocked by my grandmother's red Oldsmobile.  I revved the engine as my grandmother repeatedly tried to reason with me and my mother.  My mother comes over and tells me to get out of the car and just help.  They keep saying "What are you going to do, leave?  You can't leave.  All you had to do was do what you said and apologize."  I'm furious, and I stop for a minute and try to drive around my grandmother's car, but it's too close to the bushes on the left, and I scrape her sideview mirror.  I back up, and moms and grams are screaming at each other and me at this point.    I wait a few minutes, rev the engine, and drive through the front yard, around my shocked-as-shit mother and grandmother, to the street.   There are some lovely tire tracks in the front yard, but luckily no deep grooves, just some crushed grass.  I drove to John's place, and he dropped his plans and came back home (thanks you... sorry M&T and TLC&CL-Dub).  When I calmed down, I came home and apologized for losing my temper and embarassing my family in front of the neighbors.  They apologized as well.  I was too tired to argue anymore.  All of this seems so silly, but in a family of passive-agressive, manipulative, control freaks, I just laid down the law.  No one will tell me what to apologize for and what to feel bad about.

       My breakfast consisted of a Parliament, an iced Americano (three shots of espresso and some water), and a shitload of Sonic Youth blaring from Otis' wee little veedub speakers (Otis, btw, is my VW Golf).  Alls I need to do now is start scarfing Vicodin and Stoli and I'll be back to senior year of college.  I found out that I got into GMU last night.  No, I don't know what I'm going to do.  I have no financial info, I don't want to live in the 'burbs and I don't want to fuck over American.  I don't know, I don't know, I don't know.  It's great to know I got in.  It's a fucking bitch that I find this out now, as I'm finally a move into D.C. and have been excited about American for so long.  I do know that I feel like going on a bender.

My late grandfather, G. Maylon "Rick" Miller served as a minesweeper in the Pacific during World War II.  When he came back, he went to American University on the GI Bill, and earned an English degree.  Then, he went to work for the FBI and worked there for 30-some years.  I admire, respect and adore my grandfather and his memory.  I am proud that he fought for his country, and I am proud of his work at the FBI (even if it was under Hoover).  I also know that he may never have gotten his B.A. without the GI Bill.  I have a major problem that most Americans can't afford their education without having to serve in the military.  Look at Jessica Lynch---she just wanted to go to college!  Instead she ends up halfway across the world and taken prisoner and nearly killed.  Now, with the prisoner abuse scandal emerging, whether it was a few acting inappropriately (ahem, that's putting it mildly) or the entire chain of command, why would anyone want to be associated with that?  I can think of other ways I can serve my country and not be ashamed.    I also think that the prisoner abuse scandal reveals something about Americans and education in general:  we are a society conditioned for compliance.  John and I were talking about this the other night and it got me thinking.  Then my aunt said that my cousin had to get home and study for his SOLs (Standards of Learning Test).  He has to study for a test making sure he knows what he's supposed to know according to the government, a government whose leader cannot form a sentence using proper English?  Sorry.  That last was a barb too good to let pass.  From birth, Americans are encouraged to just shut up.  Babies are given pacifiers, rather than encouraged to explore sounds and words.  We overmedicate children who are "disruptive" or "uncompliant."  How may of these kids are just creative?  How many just need someone to pay them some attention?  Hey, it doesn't matter, just take a pill and shut them up.  I'm all for medicines to help ADD, ADHD, depression, etc., but isn't it worth trying other means first?  Then in jr. high and high school, we are encouraged to join team activities, from sports to student government.  Few students lead; the rest follow because "doing something" will get them into college, and college will get them a job.  There is little thought to how education will help them create a better world, influence change, or just make their lives more interesting.  Post-college, many of us start off in little pissy jobs that lead to increasingly littler pissy jobs that just have bigger and better titles.  We all report to supervisors who advise us to do as we are told and we will be somehow rewarded, and often are not.  Thus, if you go into the military and do as you are told just for an education, at this point you may be court-martialed.  Worse yet, whether simply affiliated by the group at large, you may not be able to look at yourself in the mirror anymore, knowing that you are fighting an unjust war, and that your government lied to you.   Hell, you just wanted to go to college.   Education means this much to much of America and it is getting to be so unattainable to the average American citizen that many are ready to risk life and limb for it---be it community college, vocational training, or Ivy League.  I'm not in any way saying get rid of the GI Bill.  I think a strong military is important, despite being a dirty hippy liberal.   I think the GI Bill has helped a lot of people get where they want.  By why aren't there more programs like this?  There is Teach for America and Americorps, but what about other programs that will help pay for school?   No other program offers those kinds of funds. Why is education so inaccessible?    Because if we are encouraged to think, the terrorists have already won.

       I did a rare thing this morning.  Instead of my usual newstream drip, I found some mixtapes last night and popped them in the cassette deck (yay VW!) and listened to them.  The first tape was one that was made for me the end of my sophomore year in college.  The first song was by Dave Matthews.  Following that was some Doors, Jimi Hendrix, Beastie Boys and Luna.  Not really my kinda music (except the last two, of course), but it works so well on this tape.  This tape is one of those made with such loving care and heart and soul and attention to lyrics that it was and still is a work of art.  About half of my commute was like a drive down memory lane involving lazy days at Goshen, Buffalo Creek Music Festival, illegal activities, and wandering around campus and town with nowhere to go and noplace to be.  Good times.  The second tape was one made for me while I lived in New York, by someone who deeply hurt not one but two of my friends.  Somehow, I was the one who ended up with the mixed tape.  (I don't get it either).  Nonetheless, it is a fantastic mix of Weezer, the Replacements, XTC, Pavement, Sonic Youth and Modest Mouse.  With each of these songs, I thought of different people.  The Weezer song reminded me the first time I met my friend Matt H., who played that same song in order to woo the girl I was with.  She wasn't much impressed but he and I managed to start our college radio empire (heh) soon after.  Pavement reminded me of New York, the Union Square Farmer's Market, nights at Yaffa, and Conor and Dave.  Modest Mouse's "Heart Cooks Brain" reminded me of Chumpie and our "Dead Buffalo Theory" (available on request) concerning men and women, as well as my ex who loved Modest Mouse.  Made me wonder what he's doing these days, and if he still hates my guts for my brutal honesty.    Ehh.  I think I know the answer to both.    This should be saved for another post, but I also got thinking about "hot-girl" songs.  Maggie McGill, Maggie May, Kimberly Austin, Scarlet Begonias (either version), Tigerlily, Suzanne, Katie Aplanap (sp?)... they are all songs about hot girls who have "it" whatever "it" is.  I want to be the focus of a hot-girl song!  Someone write me a hot-girl song!  Of course, that would mean I'd have to actually care about my appearance and return to my bar/party circuit, neither of which I'm really energized to do these days, but whatevs.  Anyhow, it was a good morning drive.  Made me realize that summer is mixed tape (ok, I'm lazy, mixed CD) season... and many of you are going to get some kick-ass mixes just because I think you need some mixed-CD love.  Got me thinking, got me dreaming of good days and happy endings and that this summer is going to be the greatest yet, dammit.  Vanessa and Pat move here sometime soon, John's friends move here Saturday (and they have a rooftop pool in their building), I have time to catch up with everyone I haven't seen in ages starting tonight, and all in all, just kick back, drink some wine and listen to some good shit.  [UPDATE: Move date: June 12.  Pizza and beer provided to all who help.  Official party to be thrown late June, early July.]

       ...and then I woke up.  An interesting few days, and not just because of my mother's ongoing moodswings.  Friday, I left work early under uncertain auspices, and ended up getting a guided tour of a national news organization that shall remain nameless due to fear of incriminating colleagues.  Met some people, got some business cards, made some new friends, and proceeded to have a happy hour with them there--in their offices!  Hopefully I didn't come off too drunk (DN--that's why I didn't stop by... by the time I left at 5:30, I was rushing to meet my roommate-to-be and trying to make sure I didn't stumble).  One individual keeps a full bar in his desk drawer.  This is truly a great place to work and I  will  get there.  Soon, dammit.  I would say more about how cool this whole situation is, but I'm afraid of any public repercussions.  So email me off the blog and I'll disclose.  Maybe.    Also discussed the possibility of a new blog venture with fellow embittered and snarky colleague... we shall see.  Friday night, watched  Love Actually  with John.    "JAH, DAHLING!"    I can't believe how much I adored this movie.  Great cast, hilarious Brit commentary on stupid Americans (Billy Bob Thornton as The American President was ingenious).  I also loved the unfinishedness of it that reflected the title.  Well done.  Saturday, made a dinner that went a little bust.  Of course, when dealing with individuals with borderline psychosis who pout and refuse to eat, what more do you expect?  Sunday, did more yardwork than god.  My arm muscles hurt from the hedge clippers, but there's no better way to get a little sun and muscle toning than from gardening.  Also splurged on herbs, including a pineapple sage, that I'm sure will be prominently featured in the housewarming party of the centure's fun drinks.  Also packed nine boxes of books and winter clothes.  Planned on watching Alias, but stupid ABC is  holding off the season finale for TWO MORE WEEKS!!! WTF?!?!!?    Today, back at work, and writing on fuel economy.   Did you know that larger-model SUVs do not fall within the government's fuel efficiency regulations because they are too heavy?   Man that pisses me off.  Wheee,  urlLink bylines !

       So.  Many of you who know me know that I veer on the flakey side.  Flake-errific.  Flake-tastic.  Mother of all flakes.  I change my mind, I'm fickle, I'm moody even with the mood-stabilizers, I'm a little self-absorbed (what kind of personal blogger isn't)?   But dammit, I hit the motherload of asshole qualities last night.   I decided last week that a situation between an old friend/ex was long overdue for a talk.  I've been friends with him since back in our intern days, dated for a little bit long-distance, promptly freaked out when I heard he was moving to D.C., didn't see him due to a then-boyfriend's insecurities (since when do I let people tell me what to do?!), and then got pissed when he started seeing someone new (because I'm a girl and I have insecurities as well).  I've since gotten past that, and realized he was long-due for an apology.   I went to yoga for the first time in months last night, and for some reason, it ran 30 minutes late.  I wasn't really in a position (no pun intended) to get up and run out.  I also didn't know the time.  So when I got into the car to meet up with former friend/ex who I have recently been trying to amend the situation with, I see, oh, it's 7:00.    So yeah, it's 7:00 p.m.   I was supposed to meet him at 6:30.   I frantically listen to his messages.  Unfortunately, I don't have a callback number listed for him because the yoga studio doesn't get reception.  I search for his number.  Oops, don't have that either since I lose my cellphone on average of once every 78.5 days.  By the time I get to the appointed place at 7:20, he is long gone.  I frantically emailed him once I got home, but I still haven't heard anything.     It feels even worse since I know that if the situation were reversed, I would have left and never called again too.   Please leave your hate mail below.  I need extra scourging like the bad Catholic I am.     Later on Friday, 1:37 p.m.   So I've been in touch with said friend and all is well.  Not to say that he wasn't peeved, but he is rational.  I however, still am not, and Chris (see comments) is right.     Other good things:   I am not slouching as badly as I have been, probably because of yoga last nighit.  I am now the proud owner of a pink sparkly pen.  I am leaving work early to go talk to some "friends" . .   Some "friends" that plan on "helping" me with my "job search."   I am going to stalk   urlLink Owen   urlLink Wilson  .     I hope that doesn't affect my plans with John tonight.  Wink.

       After a long boring day with about the last 30 minutes making my blood boil, I realized that it's time for me to get my ass in gear.  No, not about grad school... well, not entirely about grad school.  I've begun the job hunt again, in case the proposed changes (both in duties and in salary) do not take effect as planned.  Where I work, those kind of minor details changes often.  I've sent out some cover letters and resumes and clips, and as I'm doing this, I'm realizing, there are lots of part-time jobs out there--decent part-time jobs, like editing, and researching, and those kinds of things.  They are jobs that value my skills more than my mere presence.  While I have anything but a mere presence, I want something that exercises more than my phone and filing skills.  A part time job would allow me to continue on a career path, while still making my writing a top priority.   Jobs I think I'd like and/or ones at which I would be good:  Teacher or Tutor Researcher Copy-editor Proofreader Commentator Desktop publishing People who create mixed tapes and soundtracks for a living Furniture refinisher/refiner   Oh yeah.  Duh.  Writer.

       I now have been an "assistant" for three years, and will be one for yet another year.  I just got my "raise" information.  I fought hard for at least a title change, to "Media Associate" or even, "Senior Media Assistant."  I showed calculations how I make 7% less than the average entry-level media assistant within the D.C. nonprofit world (and am in the bottom quarter of all entry level media-relations assistants across the board).  I outlined my current and future duties and proved why I should be shown monetarily how much I am valued.  That value?  3%.  Three measely fucking per cent.  (It was the across-the-board raise.)    It depresses me more than anything that my office thinks that this treatment is acceptable; that this "thanks" for my work is sufficient; that I am only worth a certain amount to them; that I need my job more than they need me.  It makes my job search that much harder too---I think I haven't been getting call backs because people see that I have been an assistant for three years now, with the same company, and no promotion in duties.  I can hear possible employers mutter, "Hrmmm" and see them shift their eyes to the next applicant's resume.  "Ah, but he is an associate...."  "Ah, she is an editor."  If I loved my job, I wouldn't mind being underpaid.  I have a problem with underpaid, underworked, and underutilized.    Now, I must give serious consideration to selling my car, because I can't afford it and rent for much longer.

        They'd send a limousine anyways....   I am SO excited about  urlLink this .  Normally I'm not into concert and music-video DVDs, but I cut my baby punk rock teeth on the Clash.  My mother and I wept when we heard Joe Strummer died.   This is going to rock so hard :    In addition to the original album and the demos, "London Calling: The 25th Anniversary Edition" will boast a DVD chronicling the Clash at that point in its existence. A 45-minute documentary was created by longtime biographer Don Letts, and features recording studio footage, previously unreleased live performances, interviews with Jones, late singer/guitarist Joe Strummer (news), drummer Topper Headon and bassist Paul Simonon and a conversation with one-time band manager Kosmo Vinyl.

       I heart food.  No, really, I do.  It's why I hate being poor, or not having time to cook, and why I often find it difficult to be vegetarian.  I love all sorts of foods, cooking styles, healthy and artery-cloggin.  So I'm taking a page from Christine's blog, and blogging my cooking.    Last night, Mimi, Michelle, Tamara and Liza came over to see the semi-finished place.  We had  urlLink curry-roasted shrimp with chutney and yogurt , with a side of steamed snow peas, jasmine rice, and tempeh sauteed in olive oil, garlic salt, sesame seeds and cilantro for the vegetarians.  I used fresh herbs from my pots (makes SUCH a huge difference).  For desert, I fixed a  urlLink mango-rhubarb crumble  with rhubarb straight from the farmer's market in Dupont.  I would highly recommend the chutney-yogurt sauce even by itself, as well as the tempeh.  But beyond that, not to sound egotistical, it was one of the greatest meals I've ever made.  I don't know if it was because  Leah was doing back-up (serving bread, olives and GREAT wine, as well as chopping and mixing some stuff for me), or if it was because it was made with great love, or what.  The shrimp was cooked perfectly, but not overdone.  The crumble was both sweet and a little tart.  The rice was fragrant.  The tempeh was lovely.  And all of the recipes were very very simple.   Put bluntly, it was some good-ass shit.     It's the greatest thing having a kitchen and friends to cook with.

        You pass up an awesome fucking show because you're saving money.   That may sound like common sense to most of you, but those of you who know me know that while I'm quite competent with most forms of common sense, I lack financial common sense.  Example:  Once I lived off tea and toast for two weeks when I was broke so I could afford my first pair of Diesel jeans.... not so I could  fit  into them, just so I could afford them.  That was stupid.  Now, I should say, I used to lack financial common sense, but it seems to be sprouting along with all the basil, sage and thyme in my apartment.  I had been planning on going to see  urlLink Iron & Wine   at  urlLink Iota  tonight, with Anna, only to hear that my car insurance just went up a gazillion dollars because of my move.  That, and I'm registering my car for a student permit.  Stupid Otis!  (Aww honey, I didn't mean that.... not really).  Geico sucks, and I'm switching companies, but in the meantime, my pockets are kinda empty.  Instead we're making dinner and watching the encore presentation of North Shore on Thursday, as we both have tendencies to lust after bad Fox television shows.    So I'm missing a good show, and maybe my priorities are out of whack, but the budget's tight... I mean, my underpaid, newly married and soon to be law-schooling friend Vanessa responded, "WHAT THE F***?!?!?!" when I told her how much I make the other night.   I'm currently ranking in the bottom 25% of salary ranges for pr people doing nonprofit, not to mention the fact I'm underpaid and undertitled for my skills, experience, and overall scintillating personality.     I would make significantly more as a substitute teacher.... which I am looking into.  One of my friends also just got hired at a massive international media conglomerate as a senior account exec.    Well done  !!

       I despise Ann Coulter as much as the next bleeding heart member of the urban liberal intelligensia.  However,  urlLink this  is exceptionally good.  However, when cruising the 17th Street strip with the boys, I have been known to hear *and* use the term "c***," or "c***y," (meaning,   fabulous  ) affectionately.    Hoffman should have known better to admit it.  It does matter in context, as in, when I call up Chumpie and say, "Whadup, f***face," and she responds back "You f***ing c***" in her worst  Trainspotting -flavored Scottish accent.    Difference is, we aren't on a male-dominated, women-hating team that will later harrass and/or rape us.    (Oh yeah, and Ann Coulter is totally a you-know-what.)

        urlLink I gotta get on this and check some stuff out .  Poetry is truly an oral art, at least in traditional terms, and we have lost much of that oral tradition in our era of written/typed/e- word.  Some journals make an effort to keep this alive, but Gioia, as quoted in the article, is right: "I grew up believing poetry was a common pleasure of humanity, not something highfalutin'."  My mother used to read me Poe, and James Whitcomb Riley, and all sorts of various rock lyrics from Dylan to the Clash to Bowie to Bob Marley.  The pleasure was in the words and sounds.   What a shame it is that I practically faint and/or vomit if I give a reading.

       The human condition often depresses the shit out of me.  Hearing about the war in Iraq, the war and genocide in Sudan, and all the Big World Issues bothers me just as much as having some asshole in a BMW SUV lay on his horn because I can't move my wee Otis around the SUV stuck in front of me (and if I can't get Otis around it, you sure as hell aren't getting your monster vehicle around it either--but I digress).  I'm not saying my petty annoyances are showing the same level of hatred and evil as exterminating entire neighborhoods, not at  all .  Don't even think that.  Hell no.  What I'm saying is that if you live long enough with your head up your ass, demanding that the world revolve around you and your SUV and your petty grocery-market-checkout-line-disgruntlement, that eventually that philosophy can mean you can justify anything, from kicking out families out of housing so you can make a fat check to further pad your account, or funding war, or actually making the decision to bomb out an entire nation since their leader pissed you off years ago.  With that rambling done, my point:  Last night, I walked home from Megan's shindig and marveled at the neighborhood in which I now  urlLink dwell .  I live  here .  I have a place I consider  home .  I feel like I am the luckiest person in the world.  So many of these buildings prove that people actually make a home in their space.  There are homes with stained glass windows, and gardens overflowing with leaves and flowers, and strollers sitting on the front stoops, and you can look inside the windows lit from within and see all the little things that make these units and buildings unique, that make them actually homes.  I see the same things in John's neighborhood, which is rapidly gentrifying, but in the buildings that are still hanging on for dear life, the little ways that the neighbors make the place look a little bit nicer, a little bit more theirs.  I even encountered some friendly motorists the past few days!  (Of course, none of them were driving SUVs.)  Maybe I'm just less heinous now that I've eliminated 60% of the stress from my life since moving.  On my walk home, a man in a shirt and tie, looking very K Street, walked by with his scruffy little puppy.  Normally I stomp my way through the streets with my "Touch me and kill me, motherf***r" look on my face, but I am easily distracted by pups.  The puppy immediately came up to me and jumped, putting all of her five pounds' weight on my legs.  The man immediately started apologizing and insisting, "Oh she's friendly, she's sweet," I guess in case I was afraid or not into dogs.  I crouched down and began playing with my new puppy friend, who was very friendly indeed, and he seemed relieved.  He and I discussed dogs and then the weather for a moment and then I went on my way.  He wished me a good night.  You see a simple interaction here: two approximate neighbors, making the city a little smaller.  No pretense, no ulterior motives, no power play, no reason except to break up an evening walk and say hello and pet a happy little wiggly puppy.  This is what I've craved for so long, and it feels weird to be settling into it, but in a good way.  I hardly ever say this, or in the past I have hardly ever said this, but I honestly can't wait to get  home , just so I can sit and be content in my  urlLink place .

       Yesterday I managed to make  urlLink this  a near-annual event.  No, not the part about all sorts of good fresh seafood in a pot with garlic and white wine and buttah, but the falling down the stairs part.  I think I may have a developmental disability that left me born without a sense of balance, or coordination, or something, because I have a real knack for inflicting physical injury upon myself.    Upon leaving work yesterday, I hauled the two boxes, one for my new, retardly pink and lime green floral print wellingtons and the other for my new alarm clock, down to my car in the office garage.  The stairs leading to the garage are old, worn, and slippery (even when not wet).  There are three flights consisting of one large set and two mini sets of stairs.  In the middle of the second one, I start to put my foot down, when I realize I can't see where I'm going due to awkward width of said boxes.  I put my foot down, only there is no stair beneath it; I missed a step and went straight to the landing, where I promptly skinned an elbow, landed with the sole of my foot facing the right, but somehow my knee facing the same direction, and realized that I was in great, flibberdegibbiting pain.  I pull myself up, limp to my car, and drive to John's office where I make him leave work a bit early so he can help me wrap and ice my ankle, since I was locked out of my apartment.  [Yeah, I had no keys yesterday because I had given them to Matt so he could leave, lock up, and shove them under the door.]  It's not so bad today, just a little swollen and painful.  It's not nearly as bad as the pinched nerve from last year where I wanted to die every time I put my foot on the accelerator or the break, simply from a shift in my lower back.  I just hope these incidents are over with for the remainder of the summer.  I think some of it happens when I'm stupid-tired.  I've been waking up at 5:30 and going to bed no early than midnight... for no good reason.  No alarms, no nothing.  And while I feel fine initially, by mid-morning I'm in a near-comatose state.  Couple days of that and all the yoga in the world can't improve my innate lack of coordination.  However, between the cafeteria now carrying Starbucks'  doubleshot  (YUM!) and my blindingly pink wellies, I think I'll make it through today.

       I've moved! I've moved! I've moved! I've moved! I've moved! I've moved! I've moved! I've moved! I've moved! I've moved! I've moved! I've moved!  (dances around waving arms)  I'm running on a serious sleep deficiency right now and I have a sinking feeling I will end up falling asleep or falling over mid-sentence sometime today.  But the fuel that's running me is the fact that I now live in a  baaaadaaaassssss  apartment with a  baaaadaaaassssss  roommate and I have some  baaaadaaaassssss  friends who went above and beyond their duties as friends to get my shit (and Leah's) moved.  Our saga begins on Friday.  We were told to be at our management company at 9:30 a.m. to pick up keys, sign papers, etc.  Our leasing agent that we've dealt with on the phone, who we have never met in person, is out.  Leah and I are there, sign our lease, and the assistant helping us tells us that our super will have our keys.  Cool, we say.    We get to the apartment, and the super has no idea we're moving in the next day.  This is a minor problem, especially since many things in the apartment were not ready, and there were no keys.  That's right, no keys.  We could care less that the bathrooms are a bit dirty, or that the window needs some tweaking, or the gas isn't turned on yet.  We kinda need those keys.  We go back to the management company and tell them we're not leaving without our keys.  The assistant isn't really sure what to do, and she gets our leasing agent on the phone.  "They're not moving in until June 15."  Um, what?!??!?!?!?   Bitch lied as we were sitting right there listening to her conversation!   Good thing we have her confirmation in writing---she told us even though the official lease start date was June 15, that we could move in this weekend.   WRITING .  Signed, confirmed and dated.  So then, we convince the assistant to call her boss, who was not happy.  We speak with her, explain the situation, and she confirms that no one had ever told her of this situation, but that we would have our keys by 3 p.m.  And, we did.  Crisis averted, for us at least.  I have a suspicion that our former leasing agent will be fired soon.  So, 8 a.m. Saturday, after a sleepless night, I pick up a sleepy John and we go to the U-Haul on Capitol Hill.  Fletcher, the manager, is busy cussing out one of his slacker employees on the phone.  I love Fletcher.  We get in line and they can't find my reservation.  Why?  I had made it for Sunday, not Saturday.    (Yeah, and scarily enough, I've got the brains in my family.)  So the nice people at U-Haul switch some stuff around for us.  Thank you Fletcher.  I go pick up Matt and Taylor, and John heads to my place.  My old friend Dan-Dan-the-Weatherman is already there, and the five of us managed to pack up the truck and get it into the city by 10:30-11ish.  We get to the apartment, and  Leah and Liza join us in unloading the truck.  We all head to her place after that, load up her truck and her shitload of large furniture, and managed to unload that.  Then, Leah and Sam go get the sofa.  The sofa is large, and heavy, and blue.   It did not fit in our elevator .  We waited, and then later that evening, John and Sam and Leah (with me "spotting", climbing up and around banisters, and occasionally pushing) get this big ass mofo of a couch up eight flights of stairs.   EIGHT.   Sam and John are amazing.  (And Leah too, but they definitely took the brunt of it).  Our sofa, while comfy, is kind of evil, and has the ugliest throw pillows featuring a "Southwestern" print.  We will be replacing those ASAP.  I'm really sad I missed the PRIDE parade on Saturday evening…although, I did hear ALL of it from my window.  While looking for parking, I kept wondering why everyone was wearing rainbow flags and why there seemed to be a larger than normal number of manly women and girly men (ahhh, gender stereotypes).  And then I realized that the Madonna blaring was not, in fact, just part of the neighborhood charm, but part of a parade group.  Duh.  Sunday I went to Ikea for the first time.  I think I had a minor stroke.  It is such a sensory overload… but I picked up some cool shit and I'm almost done in my room.  Then I finally met up with Matt H., who is in town from Pasadena (good weekend to visit, Mattie!!), and is now sleeping his lazy-ass self on our evil sofa.  Matt is like my brother.  I don't know how many times I stole his clothes, stormed into his house in a fury over someone or something, or how many roadtrips we took for good shows.  It's been over a year since I've seen him---too long!  I'm hoping to sleep today at work, I mean, during my lunch break, and then tomorrow.  Tonight, Mattie's getting the tour of indie-hipster D.C. bars on 14th and U.  Track us down if you can.  I've moved! I've moved! I've moved! ….

       In a particularly hellacious, miserable, agitated mood the past few days, and no real reason I can think of beyond the fact that I'm out of sorts because of the move.  Friday I had dinner with John and my two closest friends from elementary and middle school, which was surprisingly awesome.  Not that I was totally surprised, but those kinds of events always leave some room for total and complete disaster.  There was none.  V. good.  More on that later.  Everyone and everything is getting on my last damn nerve.  Successfully fought a migraine this morning and came into work because the thought of staying amongst the boxes nearly brought the migraine back.  I don't know why all of this is coming at me now.    My mother said, "Oh honey, are you having second thoughts, you can stay here as long as you need to, you know."  I nearly smacked her.

       Maybe it's the nonstop ingestion of decongestants, but I've suddenly been melted into a big weepy pile of mush.  I've been packing and cleaning out nearly 25 years' worth of ... stuff ... and I got to the cards boxes today.  I keep cards and letters and envelopes sand notes and everything.  I'm a serious packrat.  I had about four boxes of correspondence and I've gotten it down to just one shoebox.  I'm proud of myself.  I am  not  proud that upon finding a stack (and I do mean a stack) of chronological letters from my first serious boyfriend (now ex, three years running), that I just lost my shit.  I mean, I just went through a box of Kleenex.   The story starts off with me being a fucking lunatic my senior year in college.  I didn't sleep for three weeks.  My life was turning into Fight Club, except I don't think I bombed anyone.   Sure hope not.    Anyhow, when you don't sleep, you crave contact at the worst hours... 4 a.m., 5 a.m., etc... so I started hanging around The Spark's personality test.  Somehow was connected to an English teacher in NYC only a few years older than me.  We started writing, really hit it off, and IMming and all that.  No he wasn't an insomniac, but he did usually stay up till at least 2, so we got a lot of talking done.  After a few months, it turned out I'll be in NYC for a job interview and was staying with a friend on the Upper East Side.    "Oh that's my neighborhood" he says.  "Oh my friend's at 89th and Lex!" I say.  "So am I..." he says.  Turns out he's right across the street from her.  I then say, rather riskily, hey let's meet up.  We meet up (with friends en tow, just in case, in a public place, etc. etc.), and, the rest was history.  We were together long-distance for about 6 months.  It was probably the happiest memory I have from the year that could have been a painting by Dali or an Ani DiFranco song.    We started realizing that it wasn't really working, right before I graduated.  I graduated and moved home.  Then my mother was hospitalized.  A few days later, he broke up with me, via cell phone, prior to a cruise with his family through Norway.  After a while we began keeping in touch; he helped me with grad school essays and I helped him with papers for his psychoanalysis program.  About a year later, I tell him I'm thinking of NYC schools.  Then he tells me he's been seeing a girl for nine months, and he just took her to the Bahamas.  At that point I had been seeing someone else, and he knew, and we had just broken up.  He never told me he was seeing someone else.  Awkward yes, but I would think he would have shared that with me.    I never responded.  That was about a year ago.  Part of me wants to write him now, fill him in on stuff since he was at the time helping me with grad school stuff.... and the other part of me thinks that was his way of cutting me out of his life.  He knew me too well, and he knew exactly what he was doing in that email.  If he truly wanted to keep in touch, he would have written eventually, so I know what the answer is.  I trashed a lot of meaningless notes and cards tonight, but I still kept those in the box with everything else.  But, I put all the cards and notes that John has given me since we started seeing each other on top, because  as upsetting as my memories may be, it doesn't negate or dampen my current life one bit .

       Security at Toronto's Lester B. Pearson airport is very strict.  It is also exceedingly polite.  Maybe I looked like a terrorist, or like I was smuggling drugs (I was wearing hippie orthopedic clogs), but I was a marked woman on Monday.  Coming through the metal detectors, I set off an alarm as my one carryon also was x-rayed and deemed to have suspicious material.  I went through the detector twice, once with shoes and once without.  Then I was wanded.  I think my jeans zipper or rivets may have been setting it off, but no matter.  I still got patted down.  A petite, very manly female security agent with a thick and nasal French Canadienne accent came up to me.    "I must pat you down.  May I?"  She waited.  I didn't think she was really waiting for an answer, but after a moment, I said, typically American-ly, "Uh, yeah."  She wanded me some more, and then felt the areas that were setting off the detector--rivets, outside button and zipper.  Then the wand went off near my chest--most likely because of the underwire.  She asked again, "May I check?  If you are wearing a bra, it may be the underwire"  and I replied, "That's probably it, since it is an underwire."  So she felt for the underwire as John laughed his fool head off at me, was deemed secure, thanked for my patience, and then I got to the next security agent who was waiting for me with my suitcase.  He was another little security agent, but he was Indian and had a thick Indian accent to boot.  He asked me to open my suitcase, please and thank you included, and then began rifling through my items.  "What is this?"  He asked pointing at my evening purse decorated to look like the Anick Goutal parfumerie in Paris.    "It's a purse."  I opened it for him.    "Ahh.  Thank you.  And what are these?"  He pointed to my clear zippered vinyl bags that I keep my toiletries in.  Aparently the deodorant bottle and toothbrush weren't explanation enough.  "Those are my toiletries."  "What's in this silver bottle?   May I open it?"  "Yes, it's soap."  "Liquid soap?"  He said this incredulously, as he opened the bottle and sniffed it.  "It smells funny."  He gave me a dirty look, like it was some sort of drug or biological substance of which I have no concept of since I'm an English major.  "It's organic citrus-thyme body wash."  I try not to roll my eyes.  "Oh.  Okay."  He puts away the toiletries bags and then turns to my mesh pouch on the inside of the suitcase.  "Is this cough syrup?  Do you have a cough?"  "Yes I've been having allergy issues."  The woman behind me is desperately trying not to laugh.    "What about these?"  He holds up my two prescription containers, both clearly labelled.  "The Celexa is an anti-depressant and the Neurontin is a mood-regulator."  I try not to cringe.  "Oh.  What are they for?"  The woman behind me begins to laugh openly.  I'm glad, because I can't, because mounties might arrest me.  "One makes me not sad and the other regulates my moods."   And combined, they keep me from losing my patience and ripping off people's heads first thing in the morning when they ask me stupid questions!!!!   "Oh.  And what's this?"  He holds up a baggie with a tube of clear liquid in it.  John sits on the ground about 50 feet away and laughs uncontrollably.  "Oh, that's my personal lubricant."  The security agent thanks me for my time and sends me on my way.  The woman behind me pats me on the shoulder, and says in a Irish accent, "Well my dear, so much for hiding the dirty laundry!"    I laughed.  Indeed.   Then the same thing happened pretty much verbatim before boarding the plane.     I only wish I had one of those gigantic porn-quality vibrators that's purple and glittery and veiny for security to question me about.  Ha!

       So Tuesday I called in sick to work, and drove 3 hours down to  urlLink Lexington  to visit  urlLink Micah .  After three years of having him be my partner-in-crime in and outside of the classroom, I hadn't seen him for almost two years.  Then, he ups and moves to China.  So when I heard he would be on the East Coast for a week, I had to go see him.  We spent most of the day wandering around campus and then headed out to  urlLink Goshen  to sit awhile on the banks of the Maury River.  The only way I can really describe how happy it all made me is that it was better than a Blue Heron Salad.  Which, actually, I did have for lunch that day.  Any more description of my day involves too many inside jokes and strange nuances that would only be funny, or sad, or understood, to those who were there.    The great thing is that while we still all understand the old jokes, we've been able to progress to new ones.  Sometimes once you leave a particular setting, relationships become less of a relationship and more of a memory.  The greatest friends will traverse time, space, place and circumstance.  They not only can laugh at your past but laugh with you even harder about the future.

       This morning, as I waltzed myself home from John's, I got a lot of dirty looks.&nbsp; I was clearly wearing the clothes I had worn the night before, and my eyemakeup was heavily smudged and streaked, and my abundance of sweat and rumpled hair and squinting surely screamed, "Hi, I'm Heather, and I'm hungover."  Last night at Blogorama, I pulled my usual anti-social self and hung out mostly with Jeffy who I haven't seen in eons.&nbsp; I also guzzled vodka like it was my job.&nbsp; Despite telling John that I would call him in about an hour, I show up at his place 3 hours later, after midnight, and definitely a tad tipsy.  So, as I race from his place this a.m. to show up to work an hour late (go me!), I was vaguely reminded of the   urlLink walk of shame  --when you crash at the place you partied the night before, most likely in the&nbsp; bed of an unknown gentleman, and then stumble home with the hopes that its too early for anyone to see you.&nbsp; Of course, it's never too early, and someone always does, and as you work that pleather skirt and heels that looked so kittenish the night before and only look like whorish in the daytime, someone inevitably yells out:   Walk of Shame!   Yeah.&nbsp; Pretty much.&nbsp; So as I walked home relishing in that all the people boarding the bus are sitting there going, "Huh, she's just getting home," I remembered that if you saunter and swagger and throw your shoulders back and hold your head high, you can get away with anything.  Same holds true for life.&nbsp; So with that, and with last night,  I rejoin the ranks of humanity, slowly but surely. &nbsp; So what if I don't have a  urlLink head covering ?&nbsp;  Strut, baby, strut.

       In case you couldn't guess, I'm disgusted by Ann "Spawn of Satan" Coulter's attempt at a column.  I am a pretty girl who wishes she were at the convention, and I wouldn't be one of her allies.  I'm liberal, I'm smart, I'm not a "pie wagon"--although, anyone is fat to an anorexic or bulemic, so sure, I guess I am a bit hefty--- and I would much rather she attack the party's politics than the women of the party.    Of course, that would be hard, being the misogynistic bitch that she is (nice Adam's apple there, honey... what, you got both chromosomes?).  If you can dish it, you should take it.

       I got this in my inbox today:    I am a recent graduate from W&L class of 2004 , and I found your  information on the Collonade Connections.  I am currently looking for a job in DC and noticed that you work as a  Media Assistant in the Office of News and Public Info. I would love  to speak with you at your convenience to ask about your time since  graduation and your current job. I would love nothing more than to get  into the Communications and PR field.  I majored in Journalism/Mass Communications and plan on taking graduate  level courses at George Washington University in Marketing.  Any help or advice you have to offer would be greatly appreciated.  Thank you so much for your time, and I would be more than happy to call  you during the week if it suits you.    Sometimes I really hate these letters, like the one I got from someone scoping for internships who had no clue what I did. But the recent grad seems earnest enough. Plus, I like to help the recent grads as much as possible, since lord knows no grads back then helped me and it's hard enough.   But what do I tell her? "I despise my job, my B.A. is worth nothing, and go work for a big PR firm if you really want this?" Seems kinda cruel. I don't want to be the one to burst the bubble.   It only reminds me of three years ago, when I had planned to take over NYC when I moved there in October 2001. I never moved, I never took over NYC, and I'm still doing jack shit.   Me and my open, oozing wounds are going to now go wallow in the salt mine now.&nbsp;

        It all started about a week ago.    I stopped caring about deadlines, personal or work-related. Even when I told myself, "Okay, you have to do x, y, z", I just sat on the couch staring at checklists and to-do lists I had made myself.   I stopped listening to my alarm, and came in later and later to work, until I took a day off. Yesterday and today, I used all my energy to drive myself to work and not cause an accident.   I spent Saturday in bed with a migraine. My body is falling apart. I feel like dough, I'm having assorted foot issues, my nose is dripping like a faucet.   Little things are happening: I realize I'm driving in a daze. An entire gallon-bottle of windshield wiper fluid spilled in my car and soaked the upholstery. I realize two hours later that I have been watching infomercials, or just staring at the ceiling. Normally I would find humor in these things, but apparently my sense of humor went on a vacation without prior notice, and without telling me when it would return.   My dreams are weird, until, I sleep less and less. I go to bed later and later, and wake up earlier and earlier. Only, I'm in bed earlier just staring at the ceiling, and hitting the snooze for longer.   Why all of this is happening now I don't understand. So many wonderful things have happened recently, and I can't seem to enjoy them. I keep telling myself to count my blessings, but it doesn't do anything for me. To smile, to interact, to socialize even in passing, saps my energy and all of the alone time I can have doesn't replenish it.   I can't seem to see past this shroud.    I dreamt I was in Iraq last night with my grandmother, and all I could think about was that I had nothing with which to properly cover my head.

       My dreams are usually  urlLink quite   urlLink odd .&nbsp; Last night was just par for the course.&nbsp; I went to bed late after a fun evening on (gasp!) Capitol Hill (happy birthday again, Joanne), and then a drink with Megs.&nbsp; Then I dreamt that an exboyfriend showed up to my housewarming party, with his girlfriend.&nbsp; Only his girlfriend was someone else, someone famous or someone that I know, and she was pregnant.&nbsp; He also confided in me that he had two other girls pregnant right now.&nbsp;&nbsp; What?!  I'm sure some of this has to do with one) discussing the ex yesterday in passing and two) my old coworkers demanding to know when I'm getting married and having nine kids just to piss me off.&nbsp; (Answer: NEVER!!!!!!!!&nbsp; RAWR!)&nbsp; Probably some to do with the Joseph and Elizabeth in Steinbeck's  To a God Unknown  also just conceiving a child as well in the novel.&nbsp;   Somehow my brain fused it all in a strange concoction but it had me really panicky when I woke up.&nbsp; Too much pregnancy talk!&nbsp; Keep the hormones away from me!&nbsp; Eeew!

        It's Sunday evening. I've had an excellent weekend of eating, drinking and wandering, as well as sleeping. Lots of sleeping. I decided that I should go get some coffee and go write. I head to everyone's favorite Adams-Morgan coffeeshop, and don't expect it to be crazy busy at 5 p.m. on a Sunday. It wasn't packed but I had to share a seat. Not so bad. The people I'm sitting with leave, and I take over the loveseat.     &nbsp;  A man comes over and asked me if the seat is taken and I say no. I go back to writing. He is talking rather loudly on his cell phone. I soon realize he is reading what I'm writing. I fucking hate that. I know Curiosity so well she is my middle name, however, I'd appreciate some common sense and respect here. Then he starts talking to me. He asks which waitress is ours. Perfectly reasonable question. I point her out, save my work, and shut down my 'puter. I figured I can at least drink my tea and read. "Hey so, I don't mean to be rude, but you seem very familiar. . ." I quite visibly roll my eyes, but he goes on. "Yeah I worked for awhile over at Heaven &amp;amp; Hell, you ever go there? You familiar with the area?" "Nope, sorry."    &nbsp;  &nbsp;I try go back to reading, but he extends his hand, introduces himself and says again how familiar I look. Why do I attract the freaks? I'm wearing a blank tank, my indie hipster glasses, dark raddy jeans, and a bandanna around my very dirty hair. I look just about as hippy/indie/grungy as I get. I look like I should be chainsmoking outside the Velvet Lounge waiting for it to open five hours before it actually does. It's like when Navy guys don't understand why I don't want to do shots with them, as I sing along the lyrics to a Patti Smith song on the jukebox. Social cues people!     &nbsp;  "Do you like to go out? You like to go dancing?" "No." Not a "nah," not a "nope," not a "eh..." but a flat out no. No.  No!!!      &nbsp;  I go back to reading. The waitress comes over, I ask for my check. I pay. I leave.     &nbsp;  The kicker is that he was holding and "reading" some book about "how to read people." What about my body language didn't he understand? The back turned to him, the open book, the slowness to respond, the rolling eyes, the negative answers??? Jesus.     &nbsp;  The WiFi wasn't working at that place so I headed down to my new favorite spot to check email and whatnot. The owner who is usually there doesn't speak much but greets me with a smile. I get my usual, and headoutside. There is chatter at the tables, but one large table is filled with six or seven deaf people who chatter excitedly with their hands. Other tables seat friends, or strangers who need a seat, sitting and reading, drinking, smoking and minding their own business.     &nbsp;  I put on my headphones, and watch the people go by.     &nbsp;  Now I remember why I come here first.     &nbsp;

       Like a bolt of lightning, I've gone from being sluggish and dense to realizing what I need to do.  Between readers' comments and today's most exciting email, I've realized my life's plan.  Either that or I'm rapid cycling.  I opened my email this morning to find two emails from my old adviser, Marc Conner.  Despite having a constant war with him on Steinbeck (one which I'm winning, btw), he is a great teacher and a great friend.  He cc'd me on an email to a current w&L student:  I'm delighted to hear of your interest in the Steinbeck book.  It's not a book I know well, but never fear!  A former student who graduated a few years ago knows more about Steinbeck than most of us know about ourselves!  I'm copying this message to her, and encouraging her to write you back with some thoughts about this book and how it fits into Steinbeck's world.    That former student is me!!  I rock!  At least in terms of Steinbeck scholarship.  Anyhow, I start thinking, and researching, and reading, and talking to friends.... and I have decided upon the following events:   1. Sell car by September 2004 2. Quit job in December 2004 3. Travel over winter break 2004-2005 4. Substitute teach 5. Go to school full time and complete MFA, 2007 6. Complete  urlLink Master's of Teaching  at American, 2008 7. Travel 8. Go to San Jose State University for M.A. in  urlLink Steinbeck Studies , tba 9. Complete Ph.D. and/or complete M.A. at St. Johns in  urlLink Eastern Classics , tba 10. Teach (ongoing) 11. Write (ongoing) 12. Travel (ongoing) 13. Crochet (ongoing)  It all makes sense!  I have through December to settle my finances and then I can concentrate on learning, teaching and doing what I love: reading and writing and teaching.  I don't really care about the actual degrees... it's just the process of learning that I crave to be a part of, on both sides.   It's time.

       I'm looking for the reference that Detocqueville made that all Americans are wanderers, or something like that.  Vagabondry.  If you can point me to the complete quote and reference, I'll, um, do something nice.  Like dedicate a yoga practice to you or something.  My normal bribe of buying people alcohol will be on hold, most likely through me finishing my MFA.  Also:  polls for thoughts:  Should I, if I keep failing to find a new job:  1.  Quit and volunteer as a writing teacher at homeless shelters and kids afterschool programs, living off of loans and freelancing and possibly tutoring or giving crochet lessons?  2.  Stick with my shitty job and use my time writing instead of sitting around whining about how much I hate my shitty job?  (Did I mention it was shitty?)  3.  Put my green thumb to a more profitable use to fund my MFA?  (NOTE TO DEA: THAT IS A JOKE.)  4.  Enter your own suggestion here.  Thanks.  All votes and entries will be considered, but some less seriously than others.

       What's really sad is that I completely understand these fraternity brothers' reasonings on both sides.  Glad to see how four years at W&L tainted my logical reasoning skills.

       I found this  urlLink AP story  published in the  urlLink Seattle Post-Intelligencer  via  urlLink Idealist.org .  It made me think back to the other night when John and I had dinner with Mike and Melissa.  Melissa is about to start her second year with Teach for America, and is stationed in Baltimore.  She said that several of her students have grandparents in their twenties and thirties, because the traditional generations have broken down because of teenage pregnancies, and parents themselves are often entirely missing, because children are being raised by their not-so-old grandparents.  I'm glad to see that affordable, safe, and stable housing is being made available to grandfamiles... I just hope it doesn't serve to also stigmatize a situation.  It shouldn't be stigmatized; according to the article:  The housing options are filling a much-needed void. U.S. Census figures show that roughly 2.4 million grandparents nationwide in 2002 were raising their grandchildren, up from about a million in 1990.  I was raised by my mother and grandmother; my mother moved home shortly before giving birth to me for many reasons.  My mother was always physically there, if not always mentally so, and my grandmother made sure things stayed relatively stable at home.  I tried not to be self-conscious about my weird family growing up, but it was hard when my classmates would ask me questions like "Why do you live with your grandmother", or "Why does your grandmother live with you," or--my personal favorite--"Why doesn't your mom work?" and last but not least, "Where's your dad?"  I was never really able to answer any of those questions, and instead would feel something like a mixture of tears and burning shame and rage at the rude snot who was asking questions she or he were probably just repeating from his/her parents.  I asked Anna and Allison about that a few weeks ago.  They both said they never really thought about my family, that it just seemed to be the way things were for me (and now I know why I was friends with them).  But Allison put it best:  "When I was little I just thought your family loved you more."

       Because I don't just exist in cyberspace.  Because I am a  real  person, with  real  issues, and a  real  life to  really  live.  Because I am quick to anger and quick to react, and I am learning now to face my anger instead of simply deflecting it to whomever is nearest, be it in real life or cyberspace.  Because while I take heart that my blog has a decent following of loyal readers, no one will ever compare to my friends who are there all the time.  And with that,  I am officially back .  I actually thought my hiatus would last a lot longer, but as it seems like there are a lot of interesting current events in both my personal life as well as current events, etc., to comment on and write about, I figure a week was enough.    Also, several things I choose not to blog about directly are in the process of resolution and renewal, so I'm not worried about being sued for libel.  Oh that temper.  Plus I'm kinda tired of the bank account debate.  I'd rather just concentrate on my own bank account instead of talking about theoretical ones.    Now buy my shit on E-bay, bitches!

       Ok, the debate has escalated into people being vehemently opposed to the bank account analogy.  The analogy itself is black-and-white because it is a theory, an analogy, an  idea .  Of course relationships are not black-and-white!  I'm also getting frustrated that it's all guys commenting on the topic.  Where my girls at, yo?  Plus, may I re-iterate, that I already said that I don't always buy into the Men are from Mars, crap.  Communication is communication.  However, I would love to study the gender lines of this debate if any women would friggin' comment.  Henry is continuting the debate  urlLink here .

       Even though I said I wasn't going to blog, I wanted to share this quote, paraphrased and names deleted, from my goodfriend and roommate, who read it in a book by that guy who wrote  Men are from Mars ...  Whatever, its a damn good concept.    There's this perspective of looking at relationships like bank accounts, and being with a person, you're constantly making deposits into their bank account: depositing love, trust, memories, all those good things...and the bank account grows, and all it takes is a big fat  withdrawal , and now you're  overdrawn , and it's gonna take so many deposits from here on out to build it up to where it was, and the fees add up, and they compound.    Coming from someone who knows all too well about both overdrawn bank accounts, and broken hearts, it makes sense to me.

       I received a response:    Sorry to here that my site offends you. I, a librarian, thought it's be fun to start the blog and see if i could find any sexy librarians, or people who thought of themselves as such. I see you say " And by "interested," I mean trolling the net for porn" to describe the site. There are - I believe, currently 19 links from the site, of which 5 link to naked women (and as one of these is a shot from Camden Library's (London) librarians calander for charity, I would not personally class that as porn) So 4 out of 19 links, my god, what a pervert I am, I should be locked up now!   True, I have said "Send me a pic to post on the site , clothed or otherwise, but must be sexy!", but I haven't said just send me naked pics. In fact the point of the site is not meant to be a giant porn repository. Will it link to porn? Yes, if the link shows how the idea of librarians being 'sexy' has been been exploited to do so, but it is not meant to be the main aim of the site, and frankly I do not really have time to sit and trawl the web for porn. It really was meant to function as a 'fun' release from my day blog.   One final point. I was slightly worried, reading you last point in the comments to you post of your message to me, that you are kind of missing the point of the internet by saying "people who didn't even ask if it was cool if they linked to my site". (Do you ask everyone who links to your site to get your permission?)    Once again, I am very sorry to have offended you, I am more than happy to remove the post     I responded:   First, thanks for removing the link.    The site itself doesn't offend me.  My own name and writing being linked to a site with some questionable matter by an individual I do not know bothers me.  There's a difference.  Your reasons listed were exactly why I wrote you a note asking politely to remove the link.  My blog is my own, just as yours is yours.  You have every right to create whatever you want with your blog, and I don't care if people send you photos or whatever.  That's your business.  I never insinuated anything about locking you up for your tastes nor implied you were doing something evil or wrong.  I'm not going to campaign for a purer Internet, or rules to ban porn (if you don't like that word, then how about suggestive images and words concerning an overtly sexual content).  Have fun with it.  I don't really care.  Personally, it's not my thing and that is why I wrote you, and made clear on my blog my interpretation of it WITHOUT linking to your site, to prevent any insinuation of libel, etc.    You make a good point about asking to link.  And, with the exceptions of large corporations' sites (national/internation media, etc), or sites without contact info (such as links to wildly left or right leaning manifestos) I generally do ask if people mind if I link to them, especially when they are more "personal" blogs, rather than political, cultural, etc.  I consider it common courtesy amongst friends, cyber or otherwise, especially when I may be criticizing an opinion.  That is not to say I've never just "linked," but I think increasingly we forget that there are people behind those sites and email addresses.   While I've never had a person say no, it's not going to offend me if they do--it's why I ask in the first place.     Ultimately, all of this hoo-ha has me wondering about what to do.  Should I keep blogging?  While somewhat of a mental exhibitionist, I really hate being objectified in any manner, and I find this is much easier to do over the Internet.  It's also easier to stalk people that way too.  I'm not into stalkers or even cult-like fans, even though I may enjoy them at first.  Or, should I invest some cash into a better site where I can track traffic better?  Get a crack webdesigner?  Focus my blog on a few particular relevant topics (writing, publishing, etc)  All in all, I have a lot to consider.  Any thoughts or suggestions would be appreciated.

       So  urlLink somehow  I got listed on a blog that's geared to people interested in sexy librarians.  And by "interested," I mean trolling the net for porn.    I wrote the webmaster this note:   I'd appreciate it if you wouldn't link to my site, since your site is definitely topic specific, and mine is not, at least regarding that topic.  Back in college the nickname was a joke, and yes, it was the glasses.  And, you note the definite lack of photos, because I'm not a pornstar--amateur or otherwise.  I'm not thrilled with actually being linked on the same site with links to porn.  If you don't edit it, that's your decision, but I would appreciate it. Thanks for understanding.      I hope s/he understands.

        Yesterday I climbed a wall!  Literally! Joanne organized a group to go out to Sportrock in Alexandria, where we had a basic skills class for rockclimbing. Completely contrary to my character, I said, "Yeah, I'll go. I'll try it." Leah, my roommate, and Lauren, my coworker, came too.  Stuck back in the industrial section of Alexandria, in an old warehouse complex now housing various shops and businesses, Sportrock is basically an old warehouse with faux walls with grips. (Which makes sense if you've ever done a climbing wall; however, being the ignorant novice to anything remotely athletic, I didn't really understand that.) We played around on the bouldering walls, which I approached very, very hesitantly.  And then, I started to climb. My legs powered me up and I suddenly trusted my own grip. My arms reached and then I touched the top. I momentarily panicked and thought, huh. How do I get back down, but then I just started moving down.  That was only the beginning. Bouldering is the crawling stage of climbing, and we had to learn to walk. The walking stage is belaying, where you put on a harness, strap yourself in, hitch yourself to a rope, and someone holds that rope on the ground as you climb higher and higher. My partner was none other than my twin-in-catastrophic-behavior Lauren. (Our motto is we trip on air.) After quadruple-checking my parter's gear, I began moving up. And up. And up.  I touched the rafters. I again panicked thinking, "Should I even look down?" I did look down, and realized, huh, those people down there look really small. No panic, no fear, just that everyone seemed so far away, so I climbed back down and we prepped Lauren for her try.  We did this throughout the afternoon. Leah and I came home exhausted, but definitely with better posture. I'm not even all that sore today.  But as soon as I sell my car, I'm joining the  urlLink Y  for their climbing wall!! I can't wait to do it again.

       Call me a lapsed Catholic, but doesn't it say somewhere that "the meek shall inherit the earth?"  After locking myself out of the apartment for four hours last night all in hopes of going for a run and instead wandering all over Northwest D.C. looking for roommate, friends with people's numbers, and boyfriend, I decided not to walk to work on this glorious morning (though that was my original plan).  Shoulda stuck with the first plan.  The bus was 20 minutes late. Then, a gaggle of "Women of Faith" (stated by their purple tote-bags) get on the bus at about L and 16th Streets. They were loud, and from what I gathered, were part of a church choir. They wore shorts. They were loud. They had visors. They were also very loud. They were tourists in the worst sense. I keep reading, trying to ignore that they have me surrounded. I felt rather snobby, having just started a translation of Gaston Bachelard's  Poetics of Space , but worked on concentrating on what I was reading.  That proved impossible. One woman hung from the overhead bar, like a child on monkeybars. Some shouted back and forth (across the two-section bus) about who woke up whom last night in the hotel. Others giggled about the bus's sudden stops, and the circular joint used to connect the double bus that turns when the bus turns.  I kept thinking things would settle down. The young man to my right, who had been very politely and quietly talking on his cell phone hung up saying, "I'm sorry I'll have to call you back, it's quite loud here," in a voice much louder than he used to speak with previously. I turned to him, he turned to me and widened his eyes in amazement and I cracked up. Unfortunately, I could not make funny snide comments to him as he got off at the next stop.  But that means he missed the really amazing thing. These "Women of Faith" cracked into a loud rendition of "The Wheels on the Bus", complete with Kumbayaa-style clapping.  No dear reader, I couldn't make this shit up.  I sat immobile in a state of shockandawe while women who are easily in their late 40s and 50s, shouted "The wheels on the bus go round and round..."  For a choir, they certainly seemed out of tune. And the even sadder thing is that they paid no attention to anyone else who was staring at them in amazement for their lack of respect for the commuters (ahem, taxpayers who pay for the bus system, cough) surrounding them.  When they all departed the bus, there were five riders left, who burst into simultaneously giggles and guffaws the minute the "Women of Faith" were outside.  Meek, my ass. Somebody slip that verse under their hotel doors!

       Can somebody please point me to the disclaimer on this site? Please? I'm very very afraid and about 90% certain that it's satirical. However, after spending my lunch break dodging security guards and military policy and bomb-sniffing dogs and all other things associated with the military zone that is D.C., I'm kind of paranoid.   urlLink Lacuna Inc.    Posted later in the day:   OK.  I get it.  It's from   urlLink Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind  , which I still haven't seen since I never see movies.  I came across it when looking up the definition of the word  lacuna , which is also a really awesome song by  urlLink Carina Round .  The definition is: "An empty space or a missing part; a gap; a cavity, space, or depression, especially in a bone, containing cartilage or bone cells" (from  urlLink Dictionary.com ).  No more pseudophedrine for me.  Stuffy nose be damned.... that shit makes me nervous.

       Well, the crazy kids at Slate beat John to his idea of writing an open letter to DQ via  urlLink McSwys . When driving down to N.C. for a wedding, John and his friends Matt and Taylor stopped at DQ. Matt asked the woman behind the cashier, "So that MooLatte? Is that like a chocolate thing and a vanilla thing?" "Yup pretty much" was the reply.  What next? The High-Yeller Caramel Macchiato? The Doppio Negro? Who didn't catch this nasty lawsuit-viable joke gone totally, totally wrong?  I mean, this isn't just guilty liberal outrage. I'm laughing my ass off. Don't get me wrong.

       In a sudden burst of energy, fiduciary responsibility, or just plain compulsion, I have begun the not-so-slow process of putting all of my wordly goods up for auction on eBay.  I'm not talking about the stuff I  had  been putting up (for instances the leftovers of former entrepreneurial endeavors involving pink boxes), I'm talking about clothes I don't wear.  CDs I've burned onto the iBook or no longer are worthwhile.  Books I never read fully once and never will read.  Knick-knacks.  Jewelry.  Bags.  Candles.   Stuff.   I may eBay my car too... but if you're interested in a 2003 silver 2-door Golf GL, automatic, CD/Cassette/AM/FM+ more, with 13,500 miles and a great personality, and answers to the name Otis, please  urlLink email  with the subject line: OTIS.  I'm asking $14.5K OBO.   He is a wonderful wonderful car, but I can't afford him on my shitcan salary and hopes of writerdom.  Forgive me Otis.... but I will find you a good home.  Oh, and fyi, y'all... it takes between 2-3 hours to fully roast a 7 lb chicken.  I had forgotten that last night.  Tofu and tempeh are so much quicker.

       I'm not a frequent moviegoer. I think most movies out there are crap, and I don't have the patience to sit through most of them, and the ones I want to see are easier seen on video/DVD usually just because I'm broke.   But once in a while, I see a movie that pushes all of my buttons, makes my jaw drop, hits every nerve, and makes me gush about it all of the time.  I saw that movie last night.  I won passes to see  urlLink Garden State , the Sundance Film Festival pick that's getting mixed reviews in various places, and is being touted as the next big indie-hipster flick (C).  urlLink Zach Braff  of Scrubs' Bambi/J.D. fame, wrote, directed and starred in the film. The film synopses really don't do it justice. After seeing the trailer, Doc Conlin proclaimed that he thought it might be our generation's  Benny and Joon . Supposedly the movie is about a kid who returns home after being medicated out of his gourd by his psychiatrist dad for all of his life, and leaves his meds at home. And, ostensibly, yes, yes it is. But it is oh so much more!  This is the best. Film. Ever. There are scenes in the beginning where the grainy texture and greenish light and film angles and everything threw me back to the days where I was so numb and blind and sick that it was the way I perceived the world around me. There are scenes where I laughed so hard I couldn't breathe, like Sam's "individual" dance. ("Bleaah!") There are scenes where I laughed so hard I cried, and then there were the scenes where I just wept, like when Andrew and Sam are sitting at the bar, discussing how if you don't laugh, you won't keep going.   urlLink BP  said last week, when I was feeling horrendous, that I needed to somehow finagle my way into a sneak preview of Garden State since it wasn't yet playing in D.C.  He said it would renew me, or just put everything in perspective.  It did both.  I went to bed last night brimming with ideas, wrote some of them down, and slept a happy exhausted refreshing sleep.   I'm already planning to get tickets for another showing this weekend, and this time, I'm bringing a box of Kleenex.  I don't think I can possibly do this movie justice without seeing it nine more times. But one more thing:  best.   urlLink  Soundtrack   . Ever!!!!!

       Or rather, the housewarming was just warm.  Humid.  Hot.  Tropical, even.  Our a.c. decided to go on the fritz right as guests began arriving.  So what did we do?   Drink more rum, of course!  The  foggy bottom  was a hit.      Yum, Malibu.  The party ruled for 12 hours.  While there were no women passed out in the  cabinet de toilette  or people going home with their feelings hurt (at least, not to my knowledge), I would say that it was a good time.  Plenty of booze (a shout-out to the liquor store dudes at 17th & Corcoran for not laughing at us everytime we returned for more ice), plenty of food, plenty of people, plenty of everything.   Thanks to all of you who came and rocked with us, and a double thanks to those who brought clothes/cash for the Central Union Mission.  We raised nearly $100 and also have several bags of donations... not bad when most of your partygoers work at nonprofits.  My state at the end of the night was best described as "stupid drunk".  I suddenly realized my room not only reeked of gaggles of sweaty bodies but also of smoke, and that my bed had be the primary seat for this said party.  It didn't bother me at the time, cuz hi, it's a party, but after a while I freaked and told John I had to leave.   Who leaves their own party?   Does it make it better when I tell you I got a big greasy nasty Big Slice?  MMMMMmmmmmmm.
