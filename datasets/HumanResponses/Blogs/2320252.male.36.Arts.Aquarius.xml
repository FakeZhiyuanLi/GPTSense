       I am back..........  Read this carefully. The story given below is quite interesting and  really gives us an insight into DECISION MAKING.   Which one will you choose?   A group of children were playing near two railway tracks, one still in  use while the other disused. Only one child played on the disused track,  the rest on the operational track. The train came, and you were just  beside the track interchange. You could make the train change its course  to the disused track and saved most of the kids.   However, that would also mean the lone child playing by the disused  track would be sacrificed. Or would you rather let the train go its way?  Let's take a pause to think what kind of decision we could  make................   Everybody makes mistakes; that's why they put erasers on pencils.

       I was study in Wanganui from 91-94. One week before we left for good i received pink form from immigration for permanent resident. I was too hurry packing up my stuff at that time so have to throw away the form without reading it. What does it meant? Does this form come from immigration depart to offer PR? If yes can i still apply eventhough its already 10 years now. I am Malaysin.    From what you are saying I should just write it off and forget it. After 10 years away theres no way you could use this to apply for PR now! You will have to lodge an Expression of Interest, EOI, in the normal way.    I was a PR back in 1991 and returned to the UK with a returning residents visa which I allowed to lapse. Even under these circumstances you go back to square one......a bit like snakes and ladders...sorry to dissappoint you!    Thanks for the reply. I found out these day very hard to apply for the PR since their system keep changing every years. I heard from my friends the easy way is to married local women then you will awarded PR status. How about in Uk, Karl? Is that hard also to become permanent resident?   I can't speak for the UK process. As a British Citizen I would personally take a very dim view of a marriage of convenience just to get PR!  I have a Chinese friend who went through the process the 'right ' way and I was happy to be a reference for his citizenship application. He tells me it is very hard to get into the UK/EEC countries. He married a Russian girl he met in the UK and they are very good friends of mine.   So you are seatledown in NZ for good now? What a good choice ... I really love this country actually. Since i left on 94 i dont have any chance to go back.. maybe i m too poor with the currency or with my commitment in Malaysia. But i am sure sure one day i will NZ live in forever.   Hiya Jas - I lived in Kuala Lumpur a few years back and LOVED it!!! I used to work for Yaohan - u know it? I lived in Damansara region ....    what a nice thing to hear u lived in KL before. Yaohan not doing well rite now maybe there are too many competitor here. You should come once more time to look at a new big building coming up in KL especial Berjaya Times Square... the biggest shopping complex so far in town

       Oh dear, I need to get into the habit of spelling that "neighbourhoods"...   Anyway, after a bit of research it seems that Wellington is the locale where most likely to find good job opportunities. I've checked out various real estate sites, but although I can get a good idea about housing prices I'm coming up a bit short in learning about what areas would suit us best.   We'd prefer to be close enough for an easy commute to the city, and are willing to settle into a older, smaller house with little land (a townhouse is fine but we don't want an apartment). We'd like someplace funky rather than family-oriented. Schools are irrelevant, but we're going to need a veterinary clinic. And darn it, I'd love to have a harbour view!   Any suggestions? I was contemplating the eastern Wellington suburbs (like Miramar), but don't know what the commute would be like.
