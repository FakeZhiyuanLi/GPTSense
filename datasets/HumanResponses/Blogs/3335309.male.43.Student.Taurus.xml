      Today's post is dedicated to Randy Rapp.  Good friend from college, a mentor if you will and just a goddamn Prince.  It was he who told me during my freshman year, "Bill, there's nothing worse than a bad blowjob."  At the time I nodded in agreement, imagining that what he said was probably true.  Of course, I had nothing to offer on the subject at that time since my experience was limited.  You could say my experience was nil.  As the years passed and my sexual adventures increased, I came to agree with Randy.  But today ...  I can honestly say that there  is  something worse than a bad blowjob.  A bad massage.  It was horrible.  Beyond terrible.  It was dismal.  I felt like I was getting manhandled by an egg beater.  I got  on  the table a little tight and got off more stressed out than before.  I felt cheap and dirty and cheated.  Yet another of life's sacred pleasures ruined by a beast.

      With the dog days of summer fast approaching, I offer my appreciation to the desert gods for the following:  A seemingly unending supply of FREE citrus fruit:  starting with oranges & tangeloes in January, lemons (meyer & sunkist) in February, tangerines in March, grapefruit in May, I've never experienced such a natural wealth of mixers for vodka drinks.  Bouganvilla:  shades of orange, pink, fuscia, red & white.  Hibiscus:  too many colors to mention.  Eight months of FREE golf.  Not wearing long pants since February.

      I went to my favorite, local (and free!) driving range this afternoon to hit some golf balls.  It was a bit warm, the time of day that most Coachella Valley residents take refuge in their homes.  Lo and behold I got there and a large Latino family was at the range.  And none of them had ever hit a golf ball.  I'm relatively new to golf and remember the time when I first tried to hit a ball.  I remember going to driving ranges, insecure and embarassed about my ability (or lack thereof) to hit the fucking ball.  I remember the sly smiles of those witnessing my folly.  No one ever said anything.  Golf is a very odd sport with way too many rules.  There is an unwritten rule in golf etiquette:  Never, ever offer advice on how to play.  I'm not sure why this is such an important tenet of the "gentile" sport but I'm guessing it has something to do with superstition.  I'm betting that most golfers wouldn't dare to offer advice lest it somehow come back to haunt them on their next tee shot.  F that.  Something in me just wanted to reach out to this family, give them a few pointers and help them enjoy this game a little bit more.  I spent about 15 minutes showing them the very basics of a good golf swing.  Many in the family had played baseball.  I could tell because when they swung the club, they led with their hips.  In golf, one must learn to delay the forward rotation of the hips to coincide with the movement of the trunk.  My new friends took quickly and kindly to this unsolicited lesson.  Especially the younger ones.  The father sent the oldest child back into the clubhouse to get more range balls to hit.  They had the fever.  As for me, I still can't hit my 3-wood straight.  All my friends pretend not to notice.

      If so, have you seen mine?  I can't seem to find it.  You see, I've been on the massage table for three hours today.  I have no ambition other than making myself a couple of drinks and drifting into a heavy, blissful, womb-like experience called sleep.  Stop the world and melt with me.

      By far, my favorite class is Acupressure.  I'm half way through the semsester and have become fascinated by Qi (pronounced 'chi').  The Chinese developed this system 3000+ years ago.  The underpinnings of the theory of Qi goes something like this:  in the beginning, there was Qi (invisible) energy.  As time passes, Qi energy begins to organize itself in 12 distinct alignments (chronologically, in order):  Lung, Large Intestine, Stomach, Spleen, Heart, Small Intestine, Urinary/Bladder, Kidney, Pericardium (muscle around the heart), San Jiao, Gall Bladder, Liver.  In time, the invisible Qi develops further into the physical realm, creating the vital organs to facilitate it's own processes. Yet the energy of the particular organs extends throughout the body on specific meridians.  Some energy systems connect from the hand to the heart, other connect from the feet to the head.  I suspect that one could spend a lifetime perfecting these relationships.  But I am only 6 weeks into this and my eyes are wide open.  *SP6 refers to a specific point on the spleen meridian that helps to activate energy blocks that might exist in the genitals.  Since most of us are always looking for ways to enhance our sexual experience, this is a must know for everyone.

      There's no easy way to broach this subject without somehow exposing myself as a porn-watching pervert so I'll just say to you upfront that I'm a "porn-watching pervert" and let y'all deal with it ...  That said:  Enough with the shaved pubes, shaved treasure trails and bare chests.  I understand that there may be advantages to a little trim here and there ... especially the nutsac.  Shaving the balls helps to increase the sensation.  But shaving in the pelvic region does nothing to heighten sensations.  And if you believe the ol' wives tail that shaving helps to make the penis look longer, then you're missing the boat.  Despite all attempts at illusion, a 7 inch dick is a 7 inch dick.  It does not magically become 8 inches just because you shaved your pubes.  To me, it's like this weird "childhood, little boy or girl" worship.  There must be some bizarre denial of maturity (masculinity or femininity) that underlies this fad.  F that.  Why is pubic hair bad?  PS:  The irony is that the "clean shaved look" is running parallel to the whole ink/piercing body modification trend.

      Why was this Berg character in Iraq?  Like Halliburton, he was there to profit from the Bush/Cheney/Rummy war.  Losing his head to the Al Qaeda cowards does not make him a hero or a martyr.  Just somebody that was in the wrong place at the wrong time.  Berg knew this.  For anyone to suggest that Berg lost his life because of the "sins" of Bush, Cheney and Rummy is irresponsible.

      Greetings to bloggers one and all.  I come to you from Palm Desert, CA, nestled in the Coachella Valley.  I'll have more to share on the topography of this place, it's history and mystique.  I'm knee deep in my studies of Kinesiology, Acurpressure, and Swedish Massage.  It is much easier to focus on studies since the afternoon heat is becoming unbearable.  Will post later this evening.

      Alas the end is near.  Finished up with Kinesiology today, Acupressure yesterday, Biz Ethics awhile back.  All that's left of my education as a massage therapist is a perfunctory written exam in Swedish Massage class on Friday & a few hours in the clinic.  Sigh.  I came to the desert hoping to reinvent my life, it's direction and meaning.  I've spent the last 12 weeks touching & feeling several strangers' bodies.  In time these strangers have become friends.  Of note, John and Natalie, expatriates from across the pond, have become good friends.  We had them over for dinner last week.  The festivities lasted well into the night.  My mandibles & masseters ached from so much laughing and frivolity.  Then there is Simon, our little Cypriot friend, by way of Paris.  A mere child of 26 years, with baby face looks and a pedigree as a stripper.  He's hot, he knows its and he only wants you to touch him.  Over and over again.  Stacie, straight outta Compton, a security guard at a local casino and an outright natural as a healing therapist.  I get the sense that he's as solid as the Earth itself.  The Bosnian women who sat in the back of the classroom, speaking at a volume appropriate for Wall Street.  And Mersada always commanding some young male with less girth than she, "You, massage with me!"  I'll miss everyone one of you.  Looking forward to Sports Massage in two weeks.

      The grapefruit trees are dropping the very last of the season's offerings ... BUT! I discovered an Orange/Tangerine tree hybrid that is just hitting it's peak.  To the point, I will be transitioning from greyhounds to screwdrivers for happy hour nourishment.

      Who is the   most important   artist e  of our time?  My nomination goes to Quentin Tarantino for his brilliant, off the wall, innovative and brain-shattering mastery of the visual arts.  He's a director/writer with an encyclopedic grasp of the history of cinema, pop culture and all things human.  He's a dork, a geek and a genius.  On the 10th anniversary of the release of his first great event,  Pulp Fiction , I salute you Mr. Q.  Thanks for knocking down the walls and lighting the crevaces.

      Another infuriating season comes to an end.  This series has been employing "bait and switch" tactics since the 1st season.  They bait you with incredible writing & superb acting in the first few episodes and then abruptly change the directors and writers midway thru the season.  All momentum is lost, the feel of the narrative is completely uneven.  Plot lines are developed only to be abandoned.  In the immortal words of Nancy Kerrigan, "Why, why, why?"

      Figured this one out for myself:  Frozen tortellini, cheese or meat filled.  Remove from freezer at least 1/2 hour before preparation.  2 roma tomatoes, diced 2 cloves of garlic, chopped Handful of fresh basil, chopped Salt & pepper to taste   Put 2 tablespoons of olive oil in hot skillet.  Add garlic.  Add tortellini (say 10-15 pieces) and saute quickly.  Add 2 tbsp of butter to brown.  Add tomatoes & basil.  Cook for 2-4 minutes or until tortellini is browned (even crispy!).  Remove prompty, place in pasta bowls, add salt & pepper to taste.  Right before serving, add freshly grated Pecorino Romano.  Too easy.  Serve with an ice cold Pinot Grigio.

      Another disconcerting experience in massage class today.  And I need your help to sort through it.  As I lay there, prepared to get my full-hour swedish massage, the masseuse put her hands on my forehead and began praying to God on my behalf, asking Him to help me accept this "healing" I was about to receive in the "most blessed" way.  She made several other references to her faith throughout the session.  I tend to be accepting of everyone's spiritual proclivities but was offput by this flamboyance.  If you had a massage therapist, or doctor or lawyer, what would you do or say in this situation?

      One of my favorite things to do is making CDs for friends.  I've an eclectic taste for music and a CD collection to match.  More than anything, I love introducing people to new music.  To wit, some new(er) friends have recently discovered the band Massive Attack.  For those of you out there who are not familiar with this band, they are what was happening in the club scene in Manchester, UK when grunge was (supposedly?) happening in Seattle.  Because of this, few Americans were ever given the opportunity to hear their music because corporate America music decided we needed to hear some angst-ridden heroin addicts deride the evils of corporate American music.  In a voice that echoes the '90s, "How con ven ient."  Who would argue?  They sold millions of discs.  But time flies and few of my friends, if any, still listen to Nirvana, Pearl Jam, Screaming Trees, Alice in Chains, etc.  The grunge thing just doesn't sell 10 years later.  But Massive Attack does.  They are a seminal "studio band" that learned early on that the sound is more important that the band.  With this philosophy, they cycled in lead singer after lead singer.  They embraced reggae, dub, gothic, r&b, soul, gospel one and all.  Whatever worked.  Tracey Thorne (Everything But the Girl), Sinead O'Connor, Elisabeth Fraser (Cocteau Twins), Nicolette, etc.,  all took their turns at fronting this chameleon band.  They even spawned their own brand of music:  trip hop arose out of band member Tricky's mumbled, soulful, bizarre poetics.  Today's project was making a Massive Attack greatest hits CD.  I love a challenge, especially when I get to toss back a few brews and burn a CD that I hope a good friend will get years of enjoyment from.  Not easy when it comes to Massive Attack.  They started out r&b, moved onto beautiful pop/trip hop melodies, graduated to haunting reggae/goth grooves and are now somewhere in the ether with Sinead O'Connor.  I arrived at the following:  Angel, from the Mezzanine CD What Your Soul Sings, 100th Window Be Thankful, Blue Lines Protection, Protection Karmacoma, Protection Three, Protection Safe From Harm, Blue Lines Sly, Protection Heat Miser, Protection Teardrop, Mezzanine Unfinished Symphony, Blue Lines  This list is heavy w/cuts from  Protection   BUT  if I were to choose their best, I'd go w/ Mezzanine .  This is just my wild ass theory but I imagine that the title comes from that in-between space between the reggae groove and the gothic/dark space that is cultivated by Massive Attack on this CD.  Don't believe you can be reggae and goth at the same time?  Buy the CD.  You won't be sorry.

      After 2 weeks in the Pacific Northwest, visiting family & friends, I'm back in the desert and can attend to my bloggings.  When the time is right, I'm sure that we'll have a summer residence in Portland or SW Washington.   To get you up to date on the goings-on:  : Noel and I are in the midst of purchasing 320 square foot cabin near Idyllwild.  It's rustic and small but it's at 6200 ft above sea level.  And it's just an hour away.  We take possession on August 16th.  : I start a week intensive course in Polarity Therapy.  More on this later.  : Incredibly, the tangerine/orange hybrid tree is still bearing sweet fruit.  : Joe, our gardener of 5 years, will no longer be trimming our backyard hedges.  It stands at nearly 10 feet and adds an additional 6 inches every week.  I hope that we can find someone to do this.  Otherwise, they're coming out.  : Noel and I have graciously offered to paint the large living room of our dear neighbors, Hans & Lorraine Berg.  We owe them big time for all of their assistance, especially Hans, in home repair.
