      It is ok. Not very nice but ok. I hope it is not too ugly. I wasted around 130kr on the curtain. I have bought the second nicer curtain. I will go to Paris and some cities in Italy from July 14th to July 24th. I have ordered plane tickets. It can be a big adventure for me and my mother. All together is 10 days. Sorry to Romain that I have no time to visit you because of my tight schedule and budget. Hope you have a nice summer with your family.

      I had a canoe trip on Friday. We went to a canoe trip in Nosebro. It is very nice. I got some nice pictures. The scenery is very nice. I saw some cows and sheep. At first the weather was ok, but later it began showering. And then when I wanted to get into the canoe I fell into the river once because my shoes were wet. When we went back, we had BBQ and my companions had a nice bathe in a wooden tub. Enjoy the pictures.

      Yes. I felt so sorry for Beckham;) In China somebody wrote a review for the football match called- 'Come out and See the God'. Motoi, I didn't draw the curtain. Liu said the curtains are too dark to put in the room. So maybe I will use the cloth to sew a nice skirt, hehe. I tried to make some paintings but later found out that I am lack of some art gene.

      It is good to see a new post from Romain. I was busy with my new room these days. It is a small room but ok. We get to know some friends. Two guys are really interesting. They are newcomers too and very nice.  Liu got a big old TV from a friend, and found a bed in the storage room. So now we have a lot of useful stuff. We watched Eurocup yesterday. It is really a good life with TV. The internet speed is really fast here. We downloaded some movies. I watch 2 movies per day during the weekend. Have a nice summer everyone.

      Hello nice people from ex fro20, Hope everybody's doing allright. I read your posts, it seems that life's cool for you!  Sorry for being so silent but I dont spend so much time here in St-Lo... I've been to Barcelona with some friends and we got a lot of fun there. Camping, beach, parties, sun, girls? No. I'm serious of course... Now I'm thinking about my way back to Goteborg and our fantastic flat in which i should live for 2 weeks (15th to 31st of August). I guess i will be a bit nostalgic... :-( I 've found a thesis in Chalmers so far but we are under negotiations to work for a company (hope it will work, if not i'll probably spend many hours in Bulten...so unlucky ;-) ). I wish you happiness and lots of fun ! And i will try to visit the website more often !!! I miss you all. Julien.

      Thank you for your regard Motoi. I am back. It was a tiring journey because I had to take care of my&nbsp; mom. Finally&nbsp;my mom and I are safe and&nbsp;back. Because I have been to Paris and Rome, there were not so many exciting places for me. But Venice was a nice place to me, although I lived in a terrible hotel.   In Paris I saw the national firework. It was a fairly splendid thing, although the firework is not new for Chinese. We waited for 2 hours without dinner to see that firework. My mother became not patient. Later at around 10:30 the firework began. At the beginning it was just so so. Later it became better and better. But when we came back, the crowd was like a chaos. Hundreds of people went into subway station. People were like fishes in a can. I was really afraid to lose my mother. Thank god, later we arrived the platform together. We arrived our hotel at 1AM:(.  When I was in Paris, I missed Romain and Julien. I was thinking what you were doing when I was wandering in the crowded street in Paris.   Venice is a nice place. I regret that I had been there so I can not have an exicting honeymoon there. Anyway, I suggest you guys go there with your girlfriends and enjoy the water town.   If I have time, I will write more and better articles for my travel.   The only experience that I got in the travel is that home is always the best place.

      He is too lazy to register here. So I can report his news. He is going to begin his thesis. But now it is summer holiday. So he plays games and watch football matches.  I will travel for around 2 weeks. On 7.14 my mother and I will take plane to Paris. Hope I can see the national celebration. Then the journey route is Paris-Milan-Venice-Rome-Frankfort-Göteborg. If I have time, I really want to build a nice homepage for my travel.  Dont feel lonely, Romain. We still gather here. The only difference is that the SoRomantic 20 room remains in a digital space...

      I sent a picture from my landscape during the sunset to Yan. My computer is quite bad, and my connection too. So i'm not able to download pictures in a nice way.  So the weather is really hot and sunny everyday. Sometimes, i go to swimming pool. Motoi i'm going to buy a laptop because of my frequent travels now. It was hard to sell all the components just few days before leaving Sweden. So i think i will buy a Sony... If you want the reference : Sony vaio VGN-A115B. I think, it's a really good one. We don't have so much news about Julien and Lyu. It would be nice to have some even if Lyu uses Yan to keep in touch.  Well i will try to send some pictures later... Aurelien is going in Singapour soon, on saturday more exactly. I will join him the 13 of august. And today on french tv there is a transmission about Singapour on the afternoon. So Motoi when are you coming in France ? And Yan and Lyu ? And Julien ? I'm wainting for you all ! My family...
