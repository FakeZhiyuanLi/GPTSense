      and I'm getting a little worried that everything won't fit into my car. I really wanted to only have the trunk packed, and with light things, but it looks like there may be some overspill. On the other hand, I had Ethiopian food for the first time tonight, and it was very good. the restaurant was pretty nice on the inside, but the from the outside it looks like a place I wouldn't look at twice. I should be better about trying small hole-in-the-wall places, but I let other people try them first and then persuade me to go. Heheheh.

      It's been a great weekend. Yesterday Mom and I took my car for a test spin down to Monterey. We stopped at Gilroy on the way and shopped but did not drop--and now I've got two places to wear earrings again.  Monterey was beautiful, and we spent an hour shopping for jewelery. We also took lots of pictures, and ate waaaaaaaaaaay too much out on the pier. The car held up great. Pictures will follow.

      I'm new to all this blogging, despite hours spent reading other people's blogs. What a strange way to waste time...reading the thoughts of people you'll never meet.  Unlimited photo hosting, eh? I'll have to test that, once I figure out how to add more than one photo to each entry.

      Phew! Six days of driving and a broken computer later, I'm in NY! The last day (last Saturday) I drove form Joliet, IL to East Northport, NY. For those of the lazy persuasion, that's 847 miles, according to Mapquest.   I'm online for the first time using a wireless router. The internet connection is downstairs, in a small room with a hard chair, while I'm upstairs lounging in an armchair, going "Mwaaaahaaaahaaaaaa, my bottom is sitting on a soft thing instead of a hard thing." My friends know I'm here and of course are busy people, so I'm trying to figure out how to relax. I'm not good at it.   Look for pictures coming soon; I have to sort through most of them from the trip. My computer died on the second day, so I have a lot of pics from the first day of driving that are now on the hard drive, but all the rest of the week is still on the camera.  It's strange; somehow being here in New York is making me think a lot about what it was like living in Hawai'i. Strange. I am looking forward soooo much to school starting!

      I just realised that I'm leaving the country in a little over a month,  and I have no pants!  Perhaps I should repharase that, as I'm heading to England, where they'll think I have no underwear. All I know is, for some reason when I was packing to drive to NY I thought that I would never need pants again and threw them all away. I'm hoping it's because they were all too big, and not because my brain was rotting away...  I've been doing a lot of thinking the past few days. Yes, I know it looks like sleeping to all of you outside my head, but I assure you if I'm sleeping it's because I'm trying not to think. I talked to Leslie about this (Leslie, not Leslee) and it's just mindboggling to me how incredibly my friends are growing up. Yes, all both of them. They have retained all the essential them-ness and developed to be so interesting. Here I thought I've changed so much, and then I see them and I begin to worry that I haven't changed as much for the better as I had thought.  That's enough philosophizing for now; I've got to count sweaters. More later, oh unread silly blog of the ages.

       urlLink    Nevada is very boring. Very. And the signs lie. They told me it was 40 miles to the next gas station, so I kept going, but it was 97 miles and I was worried about how long I would have to wait to get off the side of the road. I'd probably still be there.

      Having just joined Secret Pal III I felt that although from this blog it looks like all I do is drive around and take pictures, I really do knit. A lot. In fact it's becoming an obsession, but fortunately I won't have a LOT of time to do it in about three weeks...hopefully. But since most of what I make seems to find its way to other people's houses anyway, I may as well find someone else to make happy with random acts of fiber thingies.
