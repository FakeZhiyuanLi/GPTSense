        I am very sad right now. Due to my current illness, I am to miss out on my dive trip to Mexico. It is bad in some ways, but also good in others. I guess we should start with the bad........     1. Stuck with my parents for the rest of the summer 2. Miss out on some awesome diving spots 3. I have to miss out on my only vacation this summer    Ok, now to the good......    1. I will not have to worry about being so far away from home if I start getting really sick 2. I will be close to mom 3. There will be more time to go school clothes shopping :) 4. I will not have to miss my 9th grade orientation 5. I can spend more of my summer with other friends besides Alyssa!!!    Well, at least the good over rules the bad! hehehehe. Now I don't feel so upset about having to stay home. I know that I got sick for a reason and it might just be the fact that God does not want me to go to Mexico. Maybe He is really doing me a favor by keeping me here in the states. All I know is that my life is in His hands and I know that He will help guide me through the hard times.    Since I am already on a roll with writing, I would like to say how very thankful I am to have my mother. She means so much to me and it makes me sad because without meaning it, I kind of forget how important she is to me a lot. It's funny because at times like these, when I am sick or down, she is always there to comfort me and do all she can to make me smile. I defiantly owe God a lot for blessing me with such a good mother. If it weren't for her, who knows where I'd be right now. Surely I'd be lost without her. I LUV u mom!!! :)

        Oooooo! My stomach hurts really bad. I think that I have some type of stomach flu or sumthing. Hopefully it will go away by Friday b/c that is when I leave with my friend Alyssa to go diving in Mexico. Man, that would suck on ice if I had to stay home and miss my vacation. EEEK!
