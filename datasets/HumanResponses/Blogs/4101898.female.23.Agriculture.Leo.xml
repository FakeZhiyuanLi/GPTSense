       urlLink    Ick, disgusting, biggest spider I've ever seen in real life. That is a quarter by it, so you can see how nasty it is. Notice the little spidey underneath of it that it's trying to eat.

       urlLink    The spidey a day later getting ready for the escape. Notice that he is no longer atop the little spidey!  The disgusting monster has moved over and got most of its legs freed.

      Here is the rest of the story that  urlLink Jack  didn't tell:  The first pic is of the spider on the sticky board yesterday. The next is a day later when he has moved himself about half an inch over and managed to get almost all of his legs off the sticky board. So I armed myself with hairspray and took aim. The spidey survived my first attack with aerosol hairspray, so I gathered my wits and went for the oven cleaner. After I frosted him with over cleaner, he reared his legs up and thrashed himself back and forth.  I knew he might get away, so I screamed and injured my throat in the process, then ran upstairs. Jack immediately came over to lead me downstairs to find if the spider had really been able to escape. Alas, he had. Jack searched for what seemed like hours while I held my hair tightly in my hands panicking when he lifted up various furniture and items. We searched and searched, but to no avail.  Finally, we had all but given up, so I asked Jack to simply stand guard while I did a moment of necessary business on my computer. Then he stated, "Uh, Mara, maybe you should go away."  At this I screamed and again injured my throat and threw myself out of my chair knocking it backwards and against the wall. I ran into the living room and heard murderous sounds coming from the computer room.  I asked Jack if he was dead yet. Jack replied, " I don't know." I responded, "Grind his body into the carpet! I don't care!" And with that he said, "OK."  After more beating and sounds of death, he allowed me to return to glimpse the enemy's dead carcass. Jack told me of the three-inch span of his legs as it walked, yes it was still walking, a spider of Satan's own no doubt. We took one final picture of the spider to document his death. It has been an eventful two days.

      5. They call people fun names like “Turbo,” “Tiger,” and “Kiddo”  4. They all wink at each other for any reason  3. They reminisce about when they were in their 20’s and divulge crazy things like “I was the girl who would dance on the bar and give boob shots!”  2. They say we’re “corrupting” them when we keep them out till 10:30 on a weeknight ;)  1. They rave about music that was popular when we were probably still in the womb (That's fine - as long as we don't have to hear it on karaoke night!)

      Just got done meeting with the CEO. I’m not sure how I feel about it yet. I got another dollar raise. That’s a good thing, I know.  I got a dollar raise the week before after my first meeting with her too. That was a good thing too. But even after $2 worth of raises within a couple of weeks, I still don’t know how I feel right now.  I brought this list of job duties I could do for more pay to the meeting today. She, the CEO, looked at my list and said, “I thought you were already doing these things.”  Ha ha ha. Nope. Strike one for Mara. She then tells me the best she can do is $1 more an hour for the duties described, as we are a not-for-profit organization and my wage is competitive and blah, blah, blah.  She then said, “But I really would like to see you do these things.” She points to some items on my list.  We talk about them.  I think to myself, “Pay me more money, and you’ve got it.”  She continues, “I know you’re capable of doing anything here. You’re just like me. (laughs) I don’t know if that’s good or bad! You could do anything. I’ve got a doctorate in Pharmacy, big deal, did that for ten years, then did outcomes research, then I started this company, I could even see myself managing a retail store. You’re not like most kids your age, sorry to call you a kid, but you are.  I feel confident that you do any of this well.”  She’s trying to placate me now. But it has to be a good thing if the CEO compares you to herself. Unless she does a lot of self-loathing, but I seriously doubt it with this woman.  She then tells me, “Why don’t you go out and do these things?  Meet with employers, give them recommendations, show me how they benefit. Give talks if you’d like. I could even come watch. Then come back and meet with me again.”  Hmmm, I think I just got it. She knows I’m capable of the work. She’s seen some of my advanced work already. She wants me to do more. She just wants me to do it for FREE!    She must have read the look on my face because she immediately went into a little monologue about how I’m the kind of person who could advance easily in this company, told the stories of two top execs who started as secretaries, yadda yadda yadda.   So I guess I should be happy. I got a little more money and the “opportunity” to prove myself for more.  In other words: I’m obligated to do more, and after I do it well, I might get more money. Smart on her part – she gets more work for free for a while.

      It's getting to be that time of year again. Pendleton Round Up time! Time to buy tickets, get the campsite reserved, and prepare for a weekend of the "Let 'er Buck!" room (shoulder to shoulder guys and gals getting drunk on hard alcohol in a room as crazy as Mardi Gras!)  Top 5 reasons to go to the Let 'er Buck Room  5. If you have no choice but to come with your significant other, you know you can immediately lose him or her within 10 minutes and get to the fun stuff  4. Guys: Women flashing you their jugglies for a 25 cent plastic beaded necklace or sticker Gals: No cameras allowed, so what the heck? Go for it!  3. Gals: Masses of cute, yet stupid men throwing themselves at you for the chance to buy your next drink. (Did I mention only hard alcohol is served?)  2. Ass-grabbing. Go ahead and pinch, grab, grope, smack or feel anyone's ass you'd like. It's well-known that anyone in the Let 'er Buck room has consented to it, and having a boyfriend or girlfriend has nothing to with anything in there.  1. You may honestly get to experience the motto of the Let' er Buck room when you stumble out sometime later in the day only to realize that everyone is leaving, and you haven't even seen the bull-riding yet. You look down at the sticker on your shirt that someone gave you: "What Rodeo?" and realize it just happened to you.  Ah, I can't wait!!! Anyone else want to come this year?

      I am busting to tell some fun stories right about now. But then I realized, "Crap, I sent out an email to half the people I could tell cool stories about - to tell them about my blog."  That makes it hard to tell funny stories behind their backs when they know I have the blog now.  Dang, what was I thinking?  I should have done like Asian did: Don't let the girlfriend read the weblog because she's in it all the time! It's so obvious.   Maybe I'll get brave soon, just write my stories, then lock myself in the basement for protection.  I'll think about it.

       My new roommate just moved in today. His name is Scott and he is 2 days older than me. He just graduated from the Air Force Academy and is stationed at Fairchild until May. His dad is here with him too helping him unpack.

      I just bought my first house and moved in a few weeks ago. The house is just absolutely adorable inside and out, very clean. Not the kind of place that looks like it would have spideys all over the basement.  But when I was down in the basement in my computer room one day, I happened to see an itty bitty spider run across the floor. So I ran screamed, fell out of my chair, and ran upstairs. My typical spider response.  I was talking to this lady at work, she's 30-something, and therefore old and experienced in the ways of the world, and she told me to go buy some sticky traps. I did it. I ran downstairs, threw it hastily on the floor and flew back up the stairs.  I checked it the next day and the little spidey was on it. Rock on. I was so happy. He was alive of course, but trapped. I didn't want to touch the icky thing, so I figured I'd just leave it on the floor until I could get a guy over to the house to get rid of it.  But the next day, there was a spider TWICE the size of the first one on it too! I screamed like crazy. Yes, I know, it wasn't going anywhere, but it was still disgusting. And again, I left the trap.  Then, the day after that, the mammoth spider appeared on the sticky pad directly over the first itty bitty spider caught.  See picture below. Cannibals!! I screamed and had an upright seizure, then ran upstairs. I called Jack and told him how terrible it was. So he told me he'd come over and take a look.  Jack took all sorts of pictures of the thing, coaxing it into posing for the "money shots." We left the sticky trap there. Why?!? I have no idea. I guess we figured he'd eventually die, in about, oh, 6 months!!! That was our near fatal mistake.  My entry titled "The Real Spider Story" takes it from there.
