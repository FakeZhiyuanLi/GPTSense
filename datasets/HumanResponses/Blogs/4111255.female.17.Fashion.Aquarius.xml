      phew... so sianzzz. was rather touched by her msg...jo, thks... i thought... i dunno how long i can carry on... theres a kind of fear of projects... i dunno wat to do and where to start from. it seems like there is no goal, and im only doing projects. thats all! whats more interesting in life? nothing rite. maybe i need... a relationship. but that distracts. sickening. that asshole i hate really irritates me! insensitive freak, and all! why am i so unlucky! do project with him for the 3rd time liao! argh! he himself shuld realise that no one wants to do project with him, including me! i dun see his total contribution and his efforts! and he is so much a last minute person. hey, u better keep ur face away frm me or i'll blow! argh... sorry... lost my grace... what can i do if i am very upset... sigh... God is a little unfair to me man... sigh... life is very unfair... seperation for me and my frenz means alot to me... they seem to be like... like... erm... how to say.. maybe i am so dependent on their existance than i feel so vulnerable and useless without them, when i am feeling low... i'll accepted.. but... i had this blog so that i can let my frenz noe my feelings and happenings, thou they may not be interested. and i am utterly disappointed that i got such a reply frm u...fall off member. is using this making me remind u of the orchard pack? u say there can be other ways. are u convincing me not to use this stuff? there is no harm at all! i dun like talking over the phone n the diary, where issit? when can there be time for us to meet? haaa... seriously, i take it as a very big offence. ive not changed. its u who think i hv. thou i may not like friendster(or whatever stupid thingy u cast as)in the past, ive realised its usefulness and decided to become part of it. it can also lemme find my long lost friends. ur opinion doesnt affect me but ur indirectly insulting did. perhaps to u u didnt insult. but i think u did. and really. u want me to listen to u. do u noe that everytime this kinda situation happens, u are always the one talking, trying to convince me? u nv listen to the points i am trying to explain and i am very much irritated by my lack of ability to talk better than u. tahst why i am always on the losing side. i dun have the gift of gab. im not good in language expressing. sometimes im really too tired and heck to keep on explaining when u just wont take in what i am trying to say, like yesterday. i know u will be angry seeing what ive wrote. it doesnt affects me. im used to it. u will not put any chances of u uindrestanding what i am trying to express to u. i dun hate u. i love u, very much as a friend. i care. its just that i hate it when this situatuon comes in. u noe why i think its easier for me to talk to jo... perhaps becuz she listens. i noe u listen to me. but u talk and i got no chance to say out totally wat ive met... perhaps i really have to heck care bout friendship to stop the thinkin that i cant spend time with u guys... its really goaless without u ppl in my life... its so dry... really feel like crying out loud... sigh. the sighing period means life is so sianz and stress is very much. take care my friends.

       life has been pretty meaningless nowadays... and i'm quite bored with all this stuff... feel like quitting but think bout how much i wanted to get in to this course that time and how Moses had given me a chance, i find myself stupid, to have that thought. I miss my friends. So much. But they dun seem to bother... yesterday, sunday, was finally a day for me to relax. but i dunno why its so sian! i keep searching for somethin to do but theres nothing, and i've simply wasted my day, by doing what? Sleeping. So SIANZ! life is so boring! goaless... sigh... i need a boost!
