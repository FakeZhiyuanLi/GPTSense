      The  urlLink WWASP  programs have an interesting twist on more conventional forms of  urlLink incarceration  - the role of parents.  So, you're a wealthy kidowner, but you can't keep the kid from smoking the pot.  You can't go to the police because, well, there's not much of a crime there and they can't give the sort of guidance that unliscensed professionals can.  Isn't it worth $80/day to send your problem child to Jamaica for rehabilitation.  It's 100% hassle-free parenting.  Tranquility Bay escorts will even  urlLink pick up  your brat unannounced so there's no time for awkward explanations or goodbyes.  The good news is that you, the parent, are still in charge.  Afterall this is the eagle way - pay someone to give your child the draconian third-world upbringing you can't be bothered to administer yourself.

      Back to  urlLink camp  and still just sandals on my feet.  Quiet stretch mark plus paint splatter vinyl wouldn't be so tough if not for the smell.  But I've got run plans and a future without  urlLink fisheye breakfast  wherein all big toes will live lint free.  And so I take my showers  and try not to clog the drain with  urlLink feathers .

      The highly annoying color display issue has been resolved.  More importantly, I've seen  urlLink Spirited Away  which knows a thing or two about color, character design and what happens when a Stink God tries to take a bath.  More than  urlLink Princess Mononoke ,  urlLink Hayao Miyazaki's  last movie, Spirited Away reminds me of most of the ps2 game  urlLink Ico .  The two share a similar tenderness - a feeling that stops short of seeming precious because it is so subtly evoked by the gestures and expressions of the main character.  Also like Ico, there is no excess of backstory or mythological explanation.  But this doesn't matter as the world shown is so complete that it makes intuitive sense, despite the fantastical setting.  We saw the matinee with a full house of little kids - it seemed to have entertained the good chunk of them ... lots of laughs and some crying in the sad parts.  However, there were also those who weren't really buying my 'intuitive sense' argument.  One kid in particular was desparate to figure out a variety of unanswerable questions: "Why's the dragon white!?  Where does that door go?  Why's that girl got hair!"

      It was foggy in the city by the bay, but we went to the beach anyway.  Did we ever.   Fortunately, it was more grey than actually cold.  That being said, we marvelled at the psycho-lady (not pictured) who boldly marched into the sea wearing a blue bikini.  By the way, I'm having some "non-display of color" type issues with the individual entry pages ... until a crack team of blog specialists has been able to resolve the problem, uh, imagine colors.

      26 years old is half of 52 - which is to say, I had an excellent birthday.  I started my day with a walk in Diamond Heights wherein I saw that most suburban of fixtures - the playground/stripmall.  If you can't get frozen yogurt and takeout chinese immediately after swinging, what's the point?   The point is catfish and mashed potatoes at the Lucky Penny.  Not to mention a trek into the foggy Presidio for some serious bowling.

      The DVD of the original Rollerball includes a memory game in which you have to correctly sequence 16 thumbnail scenes from the movie.

      Apparently all varieties of animals have been found  urlLink sealed  in stone, iron ore and even chalk.  Mostly frogs are found but every once in a while you stumble upon a live  urlLink pterodactyl .

But then again they may be reincarnations of those  urlLink stuck  in one of the outer circles of Buddhist hell.

      The current SF Weekly  urlLink cover story  is about getting to the bottom of the "Monkey Knife Fight" streetmeme currently plaguing the Mission. They basically pull their version of Salon's  non   urlLink Un-Masking of Deep Throat  - altho' you don't have to buy the eBook.  The weak conclusion - "It's with this realization that we come up with a theory. 'Monkey Knife Fight' means NOTHING."  Sweet.  So will it stop now?

      Ari Fleischer was asked why the President doesn't support a national ballistic fingerprinting system given, you know, certain media-hyped gun violence in the DC region.  His  urlLink response : "And certainly, in the case of the sniper, the real issue is values. And that's what is at stake here. The real issue is values. These are the acts of a depraved killer, who has broken and will continue to break laws. And so the question is not new laws; the question is the actions here represent the values in our society." See, it's that whole culture of death we've got going on that's to blame.  If only we didn't have abortion and violent video games this never would have happened (NB: the death penality is not, despite appearances, part of the culture of death).

      This evening's  Frontline  is on everyone's favorite intersection of pork barrel politics and unscrupulous militarism,  urlLink  missile defense .  I'm confident the folks at PBS will do their usual bang up job; the episode has already received a ringing endorsement  from the  urlLink National Review . Yes, I'm sure that by the end I'll be shouting at the TV and afraid to go to sleep lest I discover that a military-industrial junta has taken over America.   urlLink Oh &nbsp; urlLink wait .  That being said, my favorite account of missile defense comes from JoAnn Wypijewski's article in the December 2001 issue of Harper's.   urlLink The article  is quite lengthy, so here's a little taste: "Sometime after I returned from Kwajalein, I came upon a newspaper column by Paul Loeb, recounting a meeting he'd had with executives at Lockheed's Missile & Space Operations in Sunnyvale, California. He quoted one fellow saying, 'Let's get real. We all know that if anyone ever attacks America, the bomb is going to be delivered by a suitcase, a car or a truck, or in a boat.... We all know that we're lobbying for these programs because they make us money. We don't care whether they'll ever work, or even be useful. We care that the dollars come our way.'"

      Anthony Swofford, a Marine sniper in the Gulf War, has an article in this month's Harper's.  It's similar to, but much better than, his op-ed  urlLink piece  from the NYT last month, and presumably like his upcoming memoir due out this spring.  His take concerns both the terror of war generally and the absurdity of the Gulf War in particular.  So he writes about both the personal effect a Blood for Oil policy has on the soldiers ordered to carry it out: "We joke about having transferred from the Marine Corps to the Petrol Corps, and while we laugh at our jokes and think we're damn funny jarheads, we believe we might soon die, and this is not funny.  We have been deployed to protect oil reserves and the profits and rights of American companies, many of which have direct ties to the White House and oblique financial entanglements with the secretary of defense, Dick Cheney, and the commander in chief, George Bush, and the commander's progeny." and what happens when you come under Iraqi rocket attack: "I stand in place and piss my pants again, piss all over and running into my boots, thighs both, knees both, ankles both, bottom of my feet both, clear piss and no underwear, because otherwise chafed crotch because Vaseline only works to mile ten and all wars and battles occur farther than ten miles from all-safe points, and rotten balls if you don't remove your underwear at mile ten, and rockets landing red glare and more rockets, hitting everywhere around us, but they haven't hit us, so far they have only caused great amounts of terror and oblivion." It's interesting the response Swofford is provoking in the converative press/blogworld.   urlLink Some  seem only blithely aware of the larger point being made while others are  urlLink embarrassed  for a soldier made afraid by battle.  
Ah, the marketplace of ideas.

      The first college debate tournament I attended was hosted by Penn.  I thought I had a rough time because my partner kept wanting to run cases about Star Wars and we ended up losing more than we won.  However, I now realize that I got off  urlLink easy .

  Being crammed into unlocked common rooms is the norm for tournament housing, and you've got to expect a touch of uneasyness when a horde of dorky debaters takes over a shared college space.  But I can't begin to understand how a Penn student finds himself walking around West Philly with a container of motor oil in his hand and mischief in his heart.  Of course, this is the campus where a peace protester  urlLink self-immolated  a few years back, also around the time of the debate tournament ... so it would seem there's some kinda rhetoric-related bad vibe going 'round.

      Despite the full moon and the  urlLink light pollution  of a major city, the Leonid meteor shower did not disappoint.   urlLink Conditions  were favorable enough for me to see nearly two dozen Leonids between 2:15 and 2:45am while sitting at the corner of Hill St. and Sanchez here in San Francisco.

What a great idea to make an apocalyptic movie that goes after the absurd rather than the sentimental.

       urlLink Aquarius Records  is quite a fixture in the San Francisco boutique record store world; a peacock diskery of the highest caliber.  Their mailing list is highly recommended in that it offers succinct reviews of a huge number of new items each week complete with soundclips.  However, nearly the entire staff seems to completely despite Stereolab.  As the store philosophy is "We only stock what we like," there aren't typically a lot of negative reviews.  Which makes comments like "in my opinion, this new album sees Stereolab retreating even further into the wallpaper that they already have become" come off all the more harsh.  
I guess when you're a band specializing in 7 minutes of organ drone punctuated with lyrics like: 
"True life embodying pleasure 
 principle's noblest triumph over 
 the cowering mendacity 
 of bourgeois Christian civilisation"
 
you're going to inspire some difference of opinion.

      Speaking of  urlLink Rushkoff , I've really been wanting to catch his Merchants of Cool special for Frontline and,  urlLink hey , it's available in its entirety from the PBS website.  (Altho' not in QT, and part 5 wouldn't play for me in RealPlayer).
  
The coverage of Total Request Live's rise to dominance is particularly good and the way in which rebellion against marketing has itself been co-opted seems entirely accurate.  However, Rushkoff glosses over a crucial question he only poses rhetorically: "Has it always been this way?"  He clearly thinks it hasn't and that the marketing of pop culture has somehow become less authentic ... including that of wrestling.
  
Thomas Frank in The Conquest of Cool makes the best case against this idea in his analysis of the authenticity of the 60's counter-culture.  But it's a quote I've relied on  urlLink too often  ... mainly because it bags on Bob Dylan and the Grateful Dead.  Also, I understand Rushkoff's making a larger point about the particular image being propagated by youth marketing today.
  
I'm interested in the harm of training today's youth to be ever more receptive consumers.  But I find it hard to get worked up about teens being sexualized by MTV and South Park or to sincerely wonder "whither the authentic, non co-opted youth culture of today."  In the first case, the sexual identities that people adopt as teens are probably not indicative of the sexual lives they will later lead, regardless of what role the media played in the formation of that identity.  In the second, Rushkoff points out that the only way new, authentic youth culture gets created is by the co-optation and death of the old.  Basically there's always going to be something ... but it's probably pretty safe to say it's been  urlLink played out  by the time it shows up on Frontline.

       urlLink   When I was training to become a man, the rabbi told me that my chanting was decent enough that I could pursue a rabbinical path should I be interested.  I didn't have the heart to tell him that I wasn't even returning for the Sunday School classes I'd promised to go to the following year, let alone strive for the golden yarmulke.  But I mean, come on, it was a Jewish temple with  Sunday  School.  And don't get me started on the stained glass windows.
  
I thought of this off and on while reading  urlLink Douglas Rushkoff's  Exit Strategy which has a lot to do with Jewish myth, selling out and the ability of the free market to seduce and delude its partipants.  The way in which he explores the latter two concepts within the context of a near-future dot-com morality tale is quite interesting.  It's the myth part that gives me pause.
  
The conceit of the book is that the story being told takes place in 2008, but is being published two hundred years hence by futurefolk who've only recently uncovered this testament.  This plays out on two levels.  The first is that the structure of the story is very much a fable and, as such, there's really no doubt from the early going that the narrator is cruising for a comeuppance.  In fact, in doesn't even take that long for us to be able to pretty well infer the exact form that comeuppance will take some 200 pages hence.  So that's kind of a bummer.  
  
The second level is that the book was conceived as the first "open source" novel.  This means it was first published on the web and readers had the ability to annotate the book as if they were the future scholars studying this found text.  Very "Talmud as hypertext" and I'm all for the idea.  But in practice it comes up a bit short.  Most of the notes end up being jokes of the reverse Caveman Lawyer variety rather than contributing to a genuine, multi-narrative metatext.  The note for Reece's Pieces is indicative of the trend: "A peanut butter candy made famous by its paid placement in a Steven Spielberg film about a friendly alien.  This was long before extra-terrestrials' true nature had been determined."  
The other type of annotation is the one-off political commentary which makes it difficult to buy into any sort of concept of the proposed distant future because the comments are so based in our current political reality.  For example, this disturbing note on the Triborough Bridge: "destroyed in the Palestinian Liberation Terror attack of 2004, which poisoned the East River for several years.  It is believed that Palestinian Mullah Yasser Arafat ordered the attack shortly before his own assassination in late 2004."  Yikes!  
This brings us back, as it must, to Jews.  In an  urlLink interview  with former NYU debater Julian Sanchez, Rushkoff talks about his ideas on Judaism.  He says: "Why don't we just give the best parts of Judaism to the rest of society, then give up being the chosen people, and just basically promote a secular humanism. What I want to do is tell people that Judaism is not a monotheistic religion, that Judaism is basically the process by which people get over believing in god."  Certainly a nice idea, and this idea of transcendence is played out in the last 10 pages of the book.  But I simply didn't buy it.  Instead the resolution works by literalizing the concept of deus ex machina and, without support from the future chorus showing how this world came to pass, it seems pretty tacked on.

      There's a great  urlLink article  about the Anticon crew in the latest issue of Wire magazine.  It's about as straight ahead a piece of music journalism as you'll find on underground hiphop.  Which is amazing because often the artists involved are too busy being aloof and, you know, arty to answer questions sincerely.  And usually the writers are too busy stylizing themselves to pieces in order to prove that they get this whole art-hop deal.  
I especially like the exploration of Anticon's music as indie punk hip-hop with the focus on DIY and found art.  And I love the fact that Dose One seems to live his entire life speaking only in poetry: "Our lacking in artistic raw talent or schooling is made up for with chance and the willingness to drag a cash register or parking meter back to our apartment because it looks like it belongs there for awhile.  It also applies to our sampling nature and open palette collage writing style - basically it's an unlearning adventure in charmed and nervous lives." Basically.

      Harper's published a list of wacky protest slogans seen at the San Francisco peace rally ... the rally back in October, for some reason, not the one just this past week.  Anyway, in addition to "Beat L.A., not Iraq!  Go Giants!" and "Tango for Protest", their list also includes "Transsexual Lesbian Vegan Epidemiologist Punk for Peace."  Funny thing is, I saw the TLVEP in question while waiting for the bus on 16th and Valencia that day.  Unless, there was a second one ... which, I mean, come on.
  
But do you realize what this means?!
  
My life is being published by Harper's ... the Readings section, sure, but that and the Index are all anyone bothers to read, right?
  
It's weird being famous.

        urlLink   My most glaring geek deficiencies:  I've never made it past the first hundred pages of Fellowship of the Ring.  I've never played Risk.  And just hearing the Dr. Who theme song makes me uncomfortable.  Recently, I decided to kill the first bird and wing the second with the stone known as  urlLink Lord of the Rings Risk .  My friend Mary bought this for her husband Eugene and the three of us sat down last Friday for a little game of Middle Earth domination.  First off, it's been awhile since I've played a game where the object is to wreck the other people.  Although we started off good naturedly, there was some tension as the little elf battalions started dying by the handful .  This was probably exacerbated by playing with a married couple ... lots of idle "If you invade Rohan, I'll divorce you" threats.  Also, even though we were playing the 'quick' version, it still took over 4 hours.  That's longer than the movie, for crissakes.  In the end, I lost horribly, Mary almost fell asleep and I think we all learned an important lesson about the futility of war.  Except for Eugene, who won, and would do these little dances after successful rolls of the dice.

      Since MacWorld, there's been lots of talk about Apple's new web browser, Safari.
  
"Wow it's superfast." 
"Yeah, but it's got no tabs." 
And then to a lesser extent, "Hey!  This web browser  urlLink wrecked  my operating system."  
I spent some time this weekend exploring the minority opinion.  
Basically, I got de-metaphor'd.  No copy and paste.  No drag and drop.  And all because a Safari preference file wasn't being parsed properly.  How rude.

      Minor disturbance in my geek hemisphere ... I can't find a good video game to get into.
  
This may be for the best as my brief dalliance with CivIII nearly cost me my life, or at least kept me from seeing the sun for a weekend.  Of course, this is why I thought Tropico would have a greater draw.  The problem is I can't keep myself from playing as the benevolent communist.  I'm sure it's fun to throw dissenters in jail and have members of their families summarily executed, but I just keep trying to pass literacy programs.  Panzy.
  
This leads to the problem with Freedom Force.  I love real time strategy and I like superheroes okay.  It's the 60's style that kills it for me.  I've had enough of listening to the main character's pseudo-ironic declarations like "Let's get those Reds" and "I can't hit a woman!"  Well, that and the fact that the game will randomly go into Cubist mode in which all the polygonal surfaces are exploded and rearranged hypercube fashion.  Not fun.  
Jedi Knight II is probably the strongest candidate thus far.  You can choke people with the Force, you can shoot purple lightning, and, most importantly, you can go absolutely buck wild with a light saber.  Incidentally, I don't know why it took so many Star Wars games until LucasArts realized that without light sabers you've basically got a pile of nothing with high priced theme music.  The trouble is that Jedi Knight II is apparently among the buggiest ports to the Mac.  There's a  urlLink forum  where a guy is collecting crash logs and the discussion of video tweaks is well beyond my interest.  
I think this is where I say I'm going back to Snood and  urlLink link  to the post about giving the little game its propers ...  I'm sick of Snood.

Due to his DSL outage,  urlLink Sutter  worked from my place today.  Together we managed to finish off a box of Gille Swedish Ginger Snaps which are now my favorite cookie.   Okay, I had a head start at finishing them off.  But the best part is, you get a giant box of 'em for only $1.50 at the corner store (assuming your corner store has swedish cookies).  As far as scandinavian sweets go, I'm also a fan of swedish fish, but apparently there are some that will  urlLink summon  a plague of flies when opened.

      I didn't have a favorite republican governor until today when Illinois' George Ryan commuted the sentences of everyone sitting on death row.  Sure he's on his way out and this is really an extension of the moratorium imposed 3 years ago, but it's an amazing decision - especially coming from the heartland.  If you ever wanted to know why the death penality is wrong, here's a pretty good  urlLink breakdown :
 Because our three-year study has found only more questions about the fairness of sentencing, because of the spectacular failure to reform the system, because we have seen justice delayed for countless death row inmates with potentially meritorious claims, because the Illinois death penalty system is arbitrary and capricious -- and therefore immoral -- I no longer shall tinker with the machinery of death.

       urlLink   Just finished reading Cory Doctorow's  urlLink Down and Out in the Magic Kingdom  and it's certainly the most enjoyable long read I've ever had on a computer (I found the html version much more comfortable than the pdf ... or, you know, you could buy it).
  
More than that, it's a great sci-fi story that reminds me a lot of Philip K. Dick - a mystery where the identity of the victim is more important than the identity of the criminal.  As in Do Androids Dream, you learn about the future through the accumulation of small, fascinating details rather than the expositional dump.  This is good.  As is repainting Disney World as ubergeek utopia.  To wit: The Haunted Mansion was experiencing a major empty spell: the Snow Crash Spectacular parade had just swept through Liberty Square en route to Fantasyland, dragging hordes of guests along with it, dancing to the JapRap sounds of the comical Sushi-K and aping the movements of the brave Hiro Protagonist. Everything that goes into the future of Magic Kingdom is a little more interesting than the mystery to be solved, so the resolution doesn't come off as super-satisfying.  Still, it's a great read.

      Some network maps I have known and loved:
 
 The  urlLink puerile and geeky  
 The  urlLink tribal  
 The  urlLink partisan  
 The  urlLink beautiful and conspiratorial  
 

In the case of the first two maps on this list, the network is created explicity; it only exists because of the opt-in of its members.  With the Ryze map, the members signed up and provided their own list of links which were then translated by hand into the network map.  And you'd like to think that some amount of free choice was invovled in gaining membership to the sexchart network.  In other words, these maps serve as mirrors for the members of the network.  You look a the map to see who's connected to you; to find your place in the overall network.  And, of course, to find out if you accidentally kissed your sister by virtue of the transitive property.
  
With the second two cases, the creator of the map is trying to uncover the implicit connections of the underlying network.  This network isn't created because of the opt-in of its members, but because of the question the creator wanted to answer.  So, instead of a mirror, you have a window into the system.  And a somewhat hackneyed metaphor.
  
What if you could automate the creation of these maps such that they didn't rely on explicit opt-in, but also shielded the results from the influence of the creator.  For example, maps based on the collaborative filters of Amazon or the All Music Guide.  Instead of just seeing lists of "People who liked this also liked" you'd generate a map showing the web of inter-related items.  More interestingly, what if DayPop used a similar tool; showing connection between blogs based on the similarity in links that they post.
  
Well, you'd have a pretty cool map, that's for sure.

      Lessons learned by a pyromaniacal jew this post-holiday season:
 
 Christmas trees do, in fact, burn well 
 But only briefly ... the needles burn off like they're covered in hairspray, the rest of the tree stays behind 
 Trees with a little tinsel left on them are preferable.  The tinsel goes off like a string of firecrackers 
 Trees with ornaments should be avoided.  They will probably blind you with exploding shrapnel 
 Trees with the angel still on top ... man, even jews find that too angsty 
 If you want to toast marshmellows over a burning christmas tree, be quick.  Also be ready for turpentine flavored smores 
 Lighter fluid ... really just overkill 
 If you run out of christmas trees, trying to substitute various leafy trees will not work.  Walk away gracefully 
 People who water their christmas trees are no fun

      Christopher Marlowe is the 16th century dramatist best remembered for being played by Rupert Everett in Shakespeare in Love.  But more than that, he was also an Elizabethan  urlLink secret agent  who worked to uncover Catholic plots against the crown.  This is apparently true.  
What's less certain is whether he ran afoul of the notorious  urlLink Star Chamber  for being an atheist and decided to fake his own death to escape torture.  Assuming that he did, there are those who further believe that he fled for Italy where he continued writing.  These pseudoposthumous plays, some set in Italian towns, others about exiles, were sent back to England and published by the man we know as William Shakespeare.  Now, I heard about this by watching Michael Rubbo's  urlLink documentary  on Frontline.  When this documentary first came out last year, Rubbo himself  urlLink posted  about it to Metafilter ... but only identified himself as the filmmaker in comments.  So, this is the guy we're meant to believe in an authenticity of authorship debate?

 Update : Thanks,  urlLink Stephanie  for the lowdown on jouebs ... it's a contraction of journal and web.

      Riding a far too bouncy bus home from Golden Gate Park, I was reminded of the death of Danish astronomer Tycho Brahe.  Tycho was the one who got a whole island for the purpose of building his naked eye observatory.
  
He also lost his  urlLink nose  in a rapier duel and had it replaced by a fake nose made out of precious metals.  And he had a pet moose.  He was kind of a big, dorky, 16th century weirdo, that Tycho.
  
But I was thinking of him because I'd heard he had died from urine retention.  The  urlLink story  is that he was at a royal ball and refused to use the Danish facilities until the king left the table.  As a result, he developed a massive kidney stone and several days later his bladder burst.  Altho' new evidence suggests he may actually have died from mercury poisoning ... he had a sideline as a alchemist, you see.
  
Regardless, it certainly wasn't the 3 glasses of mercury I had at breakfast that nearly caused my own breach of protocol on the bus ride home.

Moreover, I'm quite relieved that the story is out there now.  It's weird having to tell your Mom, "Listen - you can't tell anyone in the teacher's lounge about this Google news."

      I saw  urlLink Wild Style  for the first time over the weekend and feel I may have missed out by seeing it on DVD rather than its more traditional presentation on 8th generation VHS.  Because it's the DIY feel of both the movie and early hiphop that really helps to connect the dots between the NYC punk and rap scenes.  As does this factoid from the commentary track featuring director Charlie Ahearn and Fab 5 Freddy.
  
Charlie was freaked that if the soundtrack featured one of the 7 rap tracks available at the time that they'd get in trouble for not clearing it.  So Freddy created an original breakbeat record for the movie with the help of a drummer and the guitarist from Blondie, Chris Stein.  The record was pressed and given to the DJs who appeared in the movie and that's what they used for all of the filmed routines.  Guitar riffs by the man who co-wrote Heart of Glass and Sunday Girl.

      My mom tells me that there are district-mandated steps her  urlLink school  has to follow when the TerrorMeter is elevated, as it was this past week.  For example, Orange requires that all teachers check their voicemail more frequently.  I guess the idea is to make sure that al Qaeda didn't call up a second grade teacher in suburban Missouri to give advance warning of a terrorist attack.  If we go to Red, outdoor recess is cancelled ... which is totally lame because you can only play Heads Up Seven Up so many times before you realize everyone's cheating.
  
The thing is, the idea behind the whole color coded terror level is working.  When the alert level is raised to Orange, parents call my mom asking what their elementary school prinicipal is doing to keep their kids safe from anthrax.  Fear is the mind-killer. Fear is the little death that brings  urlLink total obliteration .

But there was this horrible tension between me and Real World 3's Judd Winick ... perhaps because he knew  urlLink Ev  was going to  urlLink David Egger's  826 Valencia the next day to set some kids up with blogs.  And there's that whole weird Real World thing in Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius which I've not read, but, like, totally appreciate anyway as the most important post-modern deal written about my generation, except older.
  
Or maybe the tension was because everyone at the convention had really nasty things to say about Judd Winick.  I kept quiet 'cause it's best not to make enemies with other celebs.  Even if they're just reality show famous.

       urlLink   Don DeLillo's Mao II is a short book crammed full of big ideas.  Lots of nuanced arguments about the power of images, the roll of the mob in modern society and the nature of identity.
  
The thing is, if your read almost anything about Mao II you'll read a similar catalog of its major themes ... which I don't think is terribly satisfying.  But the experience of reading the book certainly is.  The prologue, a mass Moonie wedding at Yankee Stadium, had me completely hooked: "They want to snatch us back to the land of lawns.  That we are willing to live on the road, sleep on the floor, crowd into vans and drive all night, fund-raising, serving Master.  That our true father is a foreigner and nonwhite.  How they silently despise.  They keep our rooms ready.  They have our names on their lips.  But we're a lifetime away, weeping though hours of fist-pounding prayer.  World in pieces.  It is shock of shocks.  But there is plan.  Pali-pali.  Bring hurry-up time to all man." 
I love the shift in language, the use broken english, bringing you into the mass mind of the Moonies.  It may be a specific skill but DeLillo is the master of telling a multi-narrative story from the perspective of a ballpark crowd.

      NextBlog served me up an Illuminati conspiracy page wherein I read of the Bush administration's plan to find aliens.  I was a little skeptical.
  
Turns out it's based in some  urlLink fact  as the recently submitted budget calls for $279 million to explore the Jovian moons for traces of water.  A far cry from "we're building a Casio keyboard on a mountain to communicate with our celestial bretheren through electro" but it's interesting.
  
What's funny is that someone decided to punch up the budget by titling this section "Where Are the Real Space Aliens?"  Can't you hear the Texas twang?  Both in the distinction between the  real  space aliens and those bogus bastards who almost fooled me with their fancy autopsy special on Fox.  And then also between the  space  aliens whom we want to find and that other kind of alien whom we want to unlawfully detain.
  
Anyway, all this talk of aliens got me excited enough to look up an online  urlLink Drake equation  calculator.  Plug in your own values and determine whether or not we are alone.  Using my numbers, I found that there should only be 0.1 communicating civilizations in the galaxy.

      Since seeing  urlLink Morvern Callar  and not responding to it, I've been on a trashy movie kick.  To that end, I've watched Reign of Fire and Near Dark on back to back nights.
  
Reign of Fire is, unquestionably, the superior movie as the dragons look pretty sweet and lots of things get incinerated in an eye pleasing manner.  Also, Matthew McConaughey takes a flying leap at a charging dragon while brandishing an axe which almost makes up for his religious hotbody role in Contact.  
  
On the other hand, the box for Near Dark claims that it is the scariest horror movie ever made but really it's just about hick vampires and lots of slow, delberate scenes of people stumbling through dirt fields.  It's like Days of Heaven meets John Carpenter's Vampires but really crappy.  After Dark was written and directed by Kathryn Bigelow who is the ex-wife of James Cameron which explains why Pvt. 'Game Over'  urlLink Hudson , Pvt. Vazquez and Bishop from Aliens are all vampires in the movie.  But the worst offense is the inclusion of Joshua John Miller as a kiddie vamp.  His name isn't familiar, but his  urlLink face  and annoying lisp have ruined episodes of Family Ties, Growing Pains and the Greatest American Hero.  Fortunately, he explodes fantastically at the end of the movie.  And if I've ruined this mess of movie for you, you're welcome.

      I heard about the Challenger disaster in an elementary school classroom and thought it would be my "remember where you were when it happened" event until a couple years ago.  This morning I found out that Columbia broke apart over Texas while reading RSS feeds in NetNewsWire ... looking at  urlLink ev's  blog, to be specific.
  
This is the first national disaster I've read about primarily through weblogs.  It's strange because you feel connected to the other folks who are going through the same thing, in the same way ... experiencing it in a public way rather than each of us alone with our CNN.  But you lose the sense of the enduring ache.  Something that hurts for longer than the one post dedicated to it.  Even on the larger community sites, with their active comment threads, it's sooner rather than later that someone posts the next post.  And it not only seems, but feels, that I've moved on too quickly.
  
I feel the reflexive tug of cable news because that's how the Gulf War trained me to deal with national events.  Race home after school and watch the war during dinner.  The event endures and we experience it passively; comforted by the illusion of being tied together in an experience mediated by patriotic banner graphics.  It's the desire to say "I am a part of this - I am going through this."  To somehow reduce an entire war, or shuttle crash, to my experience of it.
  
Better to make the one post.

       urlLink   This is how  urlLink All Music Guide  usually looks to me when I view it in Chimera.  The content of the banner ad at the top of the page leaps out of its box and applies itself as the background.

      The  urlLink truth  is I can't help myself.
  
The hardest decision I used to face was figuring out what to eat.  Now, my weekday lunch and dinner choices are made for me ... and they're "all you can eat" choices.
  
Last Thursday I didn't stay at work for dinner and, when I got home, found my own devices sorely lacking.  All I had was some apple sauce and a sack of popcorn kernels.  So I decided to order pizza from the joint arond the corner.  Went to pick it up ... not ready yet.  Came back later ... they couldn't break a ten.
  
(In fact, I don't think they could break anything as all they had in the register was 3 singles, a twenty and a fifty.  Honestly, how's that gonna work out for you Pizza Joint Around the Corner?)
  
I knew this libertarian who used to say that subjecting yourself to any moment of paternalism or dependency was to play the role of the animal being hand-fed by children.

      The War to End All Wars was the name of the 1914-1918 conflict until, you know, it didn't.  So it makes sense that you'd want to put some thought into naming your military exercises.  
With the benefit of 90 years of post-modern advertising, the naming of the Second Gulf War has been turned into a  urlLink branding exercise .
  
For less important exercises and conflicts, naming is governed by the Navy's Code Word, Nickname and Exercise Term System - the regulations of which you can read  urlLink here .  I especially like section 7.d.5, "Exercise terms may not contain words that convey anything offensive to good taste or derogatory to a particular group, sect or creed."
  
I guess that's why Operation Chocolate Clarinet is on the permanent assignment list.

      Some time before us Bloggerfolk joined up with Google, Al Gore dropped by Mountain View HQ for a visit.  He's a good tech nerd, that Al, and a  urlLink Mac  user to boot.  
Which is why I feel really bad about the dream I had last night.
  
Al was a homeless knight, wrapped in chainlink armor and driven mad by circumstance.  "I've not the wherewith to carry on," he babbled.  It was hard to hear his voice; his chafed and windburned lips slurred his speech.
  
Yet, I felt he hadn't come to seduce those of us huddled around a burn barrel we'd found under a city overpass.  A gathering of those made apostate from politics, those who felt caught bewteen both war and  urlLink anti-war .
  
Al didn't say "It could have been different" or "I told you".  He sat and watched the fire.  And we watched his breath curl out from under scarred lips, leaving wavelets of moisture in the night-time air.

      In 6th grade, I had my mom for a teacher.  Okay, it wasn't for homeroom or anything but still.  
  
My biggest challenge was figuring out what to call her.  Obviously 'Mom' was out of the question and 'Mrs. Goldman' was just going to crack up my friends.   So I ended up never once referring to her by name.  To get her attention, I'd sort of snap my fingers or subtly cough.  It worked out alright ... except for the one time I really got under her skin by mouthing off and I realized that I was in trouble with both my mom and my teacher at the same time and therefore in about as much shit as a 12 year-old smart-ass could possibly be.
  
My mom's now principal at the same elementary school.  Today she won the Pillar of Parkway award which is sort of the equivalent of being inducted to the School District Hall of Fame.
  
Congrats, Mom!  I'm proud to say I knew you when you were coming up through the minors.

      You know, us Jews don't fit in so well sometimes.  In elementary school, for example, I had to tell the story of Hanukah every Christmas as part of my ambassadorship from the dreidel-people to the land of the stockingfolk.  But as I was the only kosher kid in my school, and since I don't actually know the story of Hanukah, I just made up a new one each year.
  
"Then Moses said, 'And I'll form the head!'"
  
And I've always felt left out that all the stories about seeing God in bread mold, or a skid mark, or a  urlLink street sign  invariably involve the big JC.  Well, no longer.

      The passengers of Caltrain #81 knew we were in trouble long before the conductor announced "We'll be trying to leave the station soon ... pray for us."  After all,
cars on the 25mph frontage road had been passing us easily, putting the lie to our express train status.
  
An hour later, when we finally arrived in downtown SF, a concerned crowd was gathered to meet us.  They were concerned as we had delayed their southbound departure on the same suspect train by half an hour.  As such, the unstated sentiment between the arriving crowd and that departing was both one of well-wishing and misplaced resentment.

      The newly released Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas  urlLink DVD  contains a 1978 BBC documentary on Hunter S. Thompson.  Basically, the BBC and  urlLink Ralph Steadman  show up at HST's place and try to re-enact the book.  They roadtrip it to Vegas and then to LA, all the while trying to shake out the crazy.  Hunter's not having any of it and ends up hiding from the camera most of the time.  When he's not blowing lines from behind a clapboard, that is.
  
In the doc, Hunter says he has trouble with his public persona because people are usually expecting to meet Raoul Duke instead of him.  And this conflict plays out in his commentary track for the movie.  When he launches into a sustained high pitched squeal, or a sudden burst of "fuck you's" it seems somewhat like an act.  On the other hand, he has great things to say about the book of Revelations and launches into an eloquent dressing down of Timothy Leary and his role in the demise of the 60's.  
  
The other bonus features are a hoot, too.  The producer, Laila Nabulsi, talks about how she tried to put Terry Gilliam on a dwarf quota.  And when that didn't work, she tried to bribe him with midget porn in order to keep more little people out of the flick.
  
It didn't work.

      More quasi-comical dreams of being hunted.  Last night I was pursued by a mad scientist who looked like a cross between  urlLink Henry Gibson  and Dr. Finklestein from the Nightmare Before Christmas.  His dastardly plan was to get me locked up in the booby hatch by injecting me with a madness-inducing serum.  At least he had a better plan than the shark.
  
I remember seeing the mapley syrup substance shot into my arm and thinking "Hey, being crazy's not so bad."  Altho' there was a loud buzzer that went off just as the madness set in that was pretty annoying.
  
Later, after I'd been locked up, I heard the same sound while careening through the halls of my asylum.  And I remember thinking to myself, as in the end to a sitcom, "Well, there's goes another one off to the booby hatch."
  
I was a little upset that the dream didn't end at that point ... it seemed like good closure.

      William Gibson  urlLink waxes  nostalgic on outmoded tech, including a grade school favorite, the mimeograph: "You typed, once, on a waxed paper 'stencil', clipped this over a silkscreen device with a moving pad or drum of ink behind it, and your mimeograph ran off (or silkscreened, really) as many copies of your document as you required. Owing to the physical peculiarities of the medium, though, it was unwise to underline too frequently on a mimeograph stencil: the single unbroken line was particularly prone to tear, producing leaks and smudging." 
 urlLink Jason , Aaron and I were talking about the mimeograph and other printing processes and we couldn't figure out why blueprints were still in use since they seemed to involve such a wacky production process.  I imagine it's both because of size and because draftsmen draw on trace.
  
I didn't remember the details at the time, but blueprinting is a wild scene.  It was invented by  urlLink John Herschel  in 1840 (his father discovered that funny planet between Saturn and Neptune).  It involves  urlLink coating  a piece of paper with a chemical whose structure is unknown and then explosing it to a ridiculously strong light.  The process is so old that the blue produced is referred to as Prussian blue.  That's like having a color called Ottoman orange.
  
I know it's still somewhat used because I saw the blueprint machine that belongs to the city of Baltimore do its crazy photochemical voodoo.  Leave it to Charm City to keep alchemy alive.

      My stepdad is a vet with a purple heart and I'm a whiny liberal who lives in San Francisco ... which is why I'm often confused that we both love Full Metal Jacket.  I think it comes down to appreciating the movie as a true depiction of what it was like to go to Vietnam vs. a statement of why not to go to Vietnam in the first place.
  
 urlLink Kottke  recently said something related to this, "it must be difficult to recruit someone who has seen the first 15 minutes of Saving Private Ryan or Full Metal Jacket (although some may sign up because of such films)."
  
It turns out the parenthetical is the truer part - at least, according to  urlLink Anthony Swofford 's Desert Storm memoir, Jarhead.  In it he  urlLink says , "Vietnam War films are all pro-war, no matter what the supposed message, what Kubrick or Coppola or Stone intended. . . The magic brutality of the films celebrates the terrible and despicable beauty of their fighting skills. Fight, rape, war, pillage, burn. Filmic images of death and carnage are pornography for the military man.''
  
Obviously there's a great documentary to be made on the free play of signs and signifiers involved when soldiers watch anti-war war movies in the battlefield.  But moreover it shows that depictions of war, regardless of the political intent, are compelling because of the horror, not in spite of it.

      Last Thursday, I saw where the internet  urlLink lives .  It lives in a cold, glass  urlLink box  protected by biometric scanners and a regulated power supply the size of a bus.  Knowing I had no business in the holy of holies, the internet winked at me as I trundled off to the Blogger alcove.
  
I'd never thought of internet security in terms of floor-to-ceiling black metal cages, but that's how it works where the electronic meets the physical.  I never thought the internet had an off switch, but it's a start to see a set of emergency shutdown switches that would bring down the entire data center.  Of course, like launching nuclear weapons, you have to press both buttons at the same time.
  
I once knew a responsible, well-mannered young woman who, as a girl, set off the fire alarm in her elementary school.  Not out of mischief aforethought, but just because she felt her hand drawn to the big, red switch.  The alarm pulled her.
  
Best not to think of such things.

      There's really not much difference between the state of Missouri and the State of Nature. 
  
I mean, we've got some laws there, like the Boats on Moats  urlLink amendment  allowing 'riverboat' casinos to be classed as boats as long as they sit in a manmade pool of water.

      In the 6th grade, Andrew Askuvich picked up this kid and pile drived him into the rail road ties lining the playground sandbox.  I was one of only 2 eye witnesses to this event which would quickly become a fight of epic proportions in the history of Craig Elementary.
  
This week Andrew and his fiancee visited San Francisco and we took in a Giants game together on Sunday night (the Giants won on a 12th inning RBI double from Marvin Bernard).  As the pictures reveal, I was somewhat obsessed with close-ups of Andrew's mellon.   For one thing, he's got grey hair and that's a little weird to see on someone with whom you spent the majority of your childhood. 
  
The other thing is that we had a running gag as kids about the size of Andrew's nose and how, you know, it would one day destroy the world.  I must admit it doesn't look too menacing in the photographic record.

It's not working.
  
The other night, I invented a new kind of soy milk that was pre-packaged with cereal.  The dream kinda fell apart when I couldn't figure out why the cereal was still crunchy.
  
Still, that was more coherent than the one where I got invited to a taping of the Clint Eastwood Show.  It was more dinner theatre than anything else and Clint wasn't even there.  Instead, I sat next to Matthew McConaughey and tried to convince him that I thought Reign of Fire was a legitimately great movie.  "No, really ... when you jumped at the dragon with the axe!  Man, that was heroic."  
  
And then everyone got up and started line dancing ... I felt pretty excluded.

      Since destroying a statue and thereby winning the war,  urlLink some journalists  have been touched by the poet ... Shelley in particular, and his poem  urlLink Ozymandias  in specific.
  
The use of the poem is not really surprising as it seems readymade for the occassion.  Even the part about "Two vast and trunkless legs of stone" recalls the broken pipes that remained attached to the pedestal after Saddam's body had been pulled away.
  
Ozymandias came about as the result of a sonnet writing competition (ESPN2) between Shelley and Horace Smith.  Smith's  urlLink version  concludes with:  
We wonder, -- and some Hunter may express 
Wonder like ours, when thro' the wilderness 
Where London stood, holding the Wolf in chace, 
He meets some fragments huge, and stops to guess 
What powerful but unrecorded race 
Once dwelt in that annihilated place. 
The theme in both is the impermance of all things, not just the reign of a dictator or pharaoh.
  
In this case, the pharaoh is Ramses II (Ozymandias is his greek name) who built lots of temples, defeated all his enemies and was generally well loved by his people ... well, except for those who Moses asked to be let go.  Still, the 'works' referred to in the poem truly were great and emblematic of the last great period of the Egyptians.
  
So, rather than self-congratulatory triumphalism, the real message in toppled statues is that 1) the Jews are probably involved somehow and 2) all empires end up buried under lone and level sands.

      "It's finished.  It's finished!" the renegade commando screamed on this week's episode of 24.  He'd been shot and the doctorfolk at the MiniMed couldn't save him.  He knew he was dying and cried out to reveal the location of the secret evidence.  Altho' he died one sylable too soon, Kiefer quickly figured out that the microchip was implanted in his side.
  
Here's the relevant part.  Kiefer whips out a scapel and starts rooting around in the dead man's body cavity ... using his fingers to probe the side wound.
  
And that's how we know that Kiefer's going to eat it at the end of the season.
  
The 'it is finished' dialogue combined with the wound probing is clearly meant as an allusion to Jesus and  urlLink Doubting Thomas  (with Kiefer as Thomas).  And, as everyone knows, Thomas got speared to death in India.  Ergo, Kief's a dead man.
  
(Okay, he's not gonna die next week.  But it's him or Kim, I guarantee.  And, they could kill him and still do another season ... just set in the past.)

      I had to call QuickBooks the other day and was chatting with support as we were waiting for my request to process. 
"Are you down here in Mountain View," I asked.
  
After a long pause, the support guy replied in a conspiratorial tone, "Did they tell you that?"
  
"They?  Uh, no.  It's just I'm at Google which is right across the street from the Intuit HQ ... if you were down here, maybe I could see your office."
  
"No," he said.  "You can't do that ... I mean, we're in Reno."

      Elizabeth Stanley-Mitchell  urlLink points out  that regime change doesn't work too well unless you have something else to change into ... and, coincidentally, that's precisely what's lacking in Iraq.
  
Fortunately, we've got the benefit of experience on our side.  Twenty years before this  urlLink photo-op  took place, the US engineered the last regime change in Iraq when, in 1963, the CIA helped oust Gen. Abdel Karim Kassem by  urlLink aiding  the anti-communist Baath Party. And the Baath Party brought peace and freedom to Iraq, turning the country into a model of liberal democracy.
  
You know, all of this is making the Bay of Pigs look really sensible.

       urlLink   There comes a time in a young man's life when he must open up his heart and home to a lady.  Even if only for one night.
  
Mabel's owner, Elizabeth, is out of town and I took over dogsitting responsibilities from her roommate, Meredith.  Actually, that's not fair.  Mabel could have stayed at home for one night ... it was more like she watched 8 Mile with me and then stood guard against the weird noises in the night.
  
Pretty good deal considering all Mabel wanted out of it was to be pet and taken around to see the smells of the Mission.  I mean, I know I had a good time ... I think she did, too.  
  I promised to call later this week.

      I'm back from the soggy graduation proceedings in Providence wherein I saw many remarkable things.  I saw a baccalaureate service held in the First Baptist Church in America that opened with the Muslim call to worship, featured a Taoist prayer and closed with Chinese dragon dancing.  I ate a lobster omelet, heard a kickass song about seaweed and drank one of the best Chai teas I've ever had.
  
And got to see my brother graduate in a soaking wet cap and gown.  Never one to miss an opportunity to exploit sibling embarrassment, there are naturally many pictures (in deference to my mother, the shots of his crackden dorm room have been withheld).

      As I've not driven regularly in over 8 years, I'd forgotten a couple things about my driving habits.  In particular, the fact that I sing along loudly with the car stereo and play a mean set of steering wheel drums.  And nowadays, I'm using my iPod to pump out the jams so I've got 2500 of my favorite songs to belt out.  
  
Incidentally,  urlLink this device  from Belkin is just great.  It's an iPod charger that also has an amplified line out for use with cassette adapter.  Perfect for giving you that extra jolt needed to hit the falsetto intro to New Order's "Temptation."

      I ended up hating on the first Matrix movie because everyone kept talking about how amazing it was from a metaphysical perspective.  And the movie supported this kind of over-seriousness: "No one can be told what the Matrix is."  Well, actually, you can.
  
It's for this reason that I was completely blown away by Matrix Reloaded.  There's an NYT  urlLink article  today about Cornel West and his cameo in the movie.  He's quoted as saying, "The second Matrix movie actually critiques the idea of the first. It's suspicious of salvation narratives. It's deeply anti-dogmatic."  
I completely agree.   urlLink Those  who would try to sweep the sequel under the easy "brains in jars" philosophizing of the first are really missing out.  Reloaded goes far beyond the original by building layers of myth around the central question of "What is the Matrix?" so that there is no easy, superficial answer.
  
All of which makes me wonder why the effects are all that's mentioned in every review I've read.  I mean, it's got to be said that the effects are phenomenal.  The chase sequence certainly makes the Coruscant chase of Episode II look like the unimportant cutscene it actually was.
  
But when I was leaving the theater all I could think about was the first time I saw Dune or 2001 and knowing that there was more going on than I could have possibly absorbed in the first viewing.  It's science fiction at its best - creating a complex, complete otherworld and filling it with questions that extend beyond the plot.  To call it a " urlLink popcorn movie " is like calling Blade Runner a stereotypical film noir.

 Saddam Hussein is/was a man. 
All men are mortal. 
Therefore, Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction. 
 
In  urlLink this NRO article , Jim Lacey tries to come up with a reason why we've been unable to find WMD in Iraq.  Occram's razor be damned, Lacey says.  It can't just be that there weren't weapons there. 
  
Instead, he concludes, "Saddam wanted the program and was willing to endure crippling sanctions to have it. However, his henchmen were unable to deliver and, unwilling to be on the receiving end of Saddam's zero-defects program, they faked it."
  
So let me get this straight.  First off, it was these folks on the right who kept trying to get me to understand that Saddam was a megalomaniacal dictator so evil that he might as well have been the love child of Stalin and Hitler.  Now these same people can't possibly see why said megalomaniac would get pretty prickly on issues of sovereignty and forced inspection.
  
But the part about the WMD program being faked, well, that's just a new level of self-deceit.  So, our intelligence is so bad that we can't tell the difference between a real threat and a staged one?  If that's the case why should I ever believe you when you say that we must use force now in order to protect ourselves from the Big Bad?
  
But the biggest question of all is that what does this say about the ethicality of having invaded Iraq if, in fact, the WMD was a fake.  The pro-war arugment has seemingly become that pre-emptive force is justified not only in the case of an actual threat but also in the case of one that ultimately turns out to be a fake.  
  
In the name of efficiency, we've managed to remove the second step from the doctrine of Shoot First and Ask Questions Later.

My $8 upper deck tickets at today's A's game were no exception.  The angle made some foul balls seem fair, but the view was good enough to see Roger Clemens rack up career win 298 and Jorge Posada deposit a monster homerun into the left field bleachers.

      There's an SUV ad with the tagline "Go climb a driveway."  It means, "We know that you know that you're never going to use your SUV to climb a mountain like in those other SUV ads.  But you want the SUV anyway.  That's cool."
  
The point of this form of irony is to disarm the audience; to remove the need to pass judgement by making fun of yourself.  The catch being that you never actually own up to anything.
  
Anyway, Zoe Williams has a great Guardian  urlLink article  on irony in general and this point in specific: "So, you take a cover of FHM, with tits on the front - and it's ironic because it appears to be saying 'women are objects', yet of course it isn't saying that, because we're in a postfeminist age. But nor is it saying 'women aren't objects', because that would be dated, over-sincere, mawkish even. So, it's effectively saying 'women are neither objects, nor non-objects - and here are some tits!'" 
This reminds me to reread The Fall at some point wherein  urlLink Camus  admonishes the existentialist set for being such dicks. "I was wrong after all, to tell you that the essential was to avoid judgement.  The essential is being able to permit oneself everything, even if, from time to time, one has to profess vociferously one's own infamy." 
Well, yeah, the thing is you're not supposed to like the guy who says that.

 Yo la Tengo at the Fillmore: You've not heard "Little Honda" until you hear it build into a noise-feedback climax only to drop back down into the next verse of "It's not a big motorcycle, Just a groovy little motorbike." 
 
 A drunken lover's spat in my backyard at 5am: Not sure which of my crazy neighbors were involved.  It was hard to place the low, droning male voice who slurred for 15 minutes, "You're not going to hit me anymore.  You're NOT going to HIT me anymore." 
 
 Winged Migration: This movie's French, yo.  Gotta lot of good-looking bird photography.  The soundtrack's got various bird-inspired tunes that sound like the soft-rock offspring of Rush and SpinalTap.   
 
 Santa Cruz: I got to be the guy who gets to the front of the parking toll booth line and realizes he has no money (I'd gotten a pass that apparently wasn't good for anything). I'm really sorry ... but what do I do now? [Angry stare]  You leave.

      So, this past Sunday I saw The Matrix Reloaded for the third time at the  urlLink Coronet Theater .  I'm still incredibly impressed.
  
And worried about the sequel.  I'm sure that whatever the Wachowskis have planned for Revolutions will be great.  But I feel it won't be as mind-bendingly wonderful as I initially  urlLink thought .
  
Specifically, I now have a $1 bet with  urlLink Jason Sutter  about the trilogy's conclusion.  He is of the "nested matrix" camp - those who think that the reason Neo can control the sentinels at the end of the movie is because the "real" world is, in fact, another matrix.  I believe that Neo has this real world ability (no quotes) because he is now part-machine.  The natural resolution in this scenario is that machines and humans realize their inter-dependence and must combine as the yin and yang to advance together (translation: big fight with Agent Smith).
  
Anyway, Scott Manning has some great things to  urlLink say  on this topic.

      I used to be a hotdog technician.  On a hot and muggy afternoon in St. Louis, I tended to the sausage needs of overweight suburbanites as they rested from digging through discount software bins to snarf on free snacks.  If you want to get people to spend $50 on add-on floppies to Strip Poker 7, you need to provide some snackage.  
  
That was the first time I almost died.  Sweating my heart out over an open grill in the St. Louis summer and trying to field absurd hotdog requests from the thrifty .  "I want mine completely black on one side but raw on the other!"
  
Jason Sutter eventually took pity on me, but hotdog jokes have followed me to this day.  To wit,  urlLink Lane's  recent portrait.

Who would've thought that a rock n' roll concert could go so far off the rails.  The New Pornographers show started out with just a few generic problems.  A bad soundcheck that left the vocals basically inaudible during the first song.  A too drunken keyboards player who was occassionally way out of sync and would snap his fingers arhythmically when not playing as tho' he was trying to convince himself that he'd found the beat.
  
But then the band noticed the kid in the Rush t-shirt at the front of the crowd who was playing air guitar along to every song.  "Hey - c'mon up here, kid," they told him.  And up he trundled to hop around stage playing air guitar during the next tune.  
At the end of that song, his friend came up to play air bass.  Then their lady friend played air drums on the song after that.  Eventually there was an entire shadow band pantomiming the show, spewing plumes of chugged beer in mock rockstar glee.  It was a nightmare.
  
The two albums that the New Pornographers contain only amazing songs so it was still fun to see them played live.  But I get a little nervous when the accepted standards of performance are so blatantly flaunted.  Audience in the crowd, band on the stage.  It's the natural order of things.

      I'd been warned, but I waited for the  urlLink 22 Fillmore  anyway.  Very foolish.
  
20 minutes later I jumped in a cab.  The cab driver explained to me that the Union Street Fair had messed up everything.  He also explained that he was from Tunisia and that he's sick of hearing tourists complain about the cold summers in San Francisco and that he moved here to get away from the heat.  I liked him immediately.
 
"I hate the heat, too.  And Tunisia, that's like desert hot," I said.  
"Nah ... the desert's further south, Tunisia's more Mediterranean."
 
I felt bad for being another American completely ignorant of world geography.  But I looked it up later.  Where this dude's from may be all riviera'd, but the Sahara's definitely in that deal somewhere.
  
Passing Dolores Park, we saw a paddy wagon being stocked up with homeless people who'd been sleeping near the tennis courts.  The cabbie said he used to run in the park but stopped because he was afraid of all the homeless who slept there.
 
"Do they have a lot of homeless people in Tunisia," I asked.

      Just got back from driving around  urlLink Treasure Island  with  urlLink Jason Sutter .  What a fucking misnomer.  Treasure Island is what happens when the Navy decides to float a suburban turd in the middle of the San Francisco Bay.  
  
Also, it's largely abandonded.  The Fleet Admiral Nimitz Convention Hall?  Not that happening.  Good place to film a zombie movie, however.
  
After returning home, I remarked to my diminutive friend that I was feeling pretty worn out.  He wondered why that was.  So I turned to my new/current employer for  urlLink advice .
  
I'm still tired, but as a result of the Feeling Lucky hit, I found this helpful  urlLink info  about Myo-Blast CSP3.  Sounds great: 
"Well guys, ive been using this for a while now and although i have had seriously satisfying pumps at the gym i have found that i have diveloped large warts around the crack of my arse and in between my now muscular toes. Sadly as a result of this i am no longer having satisfying dumps in the can since it stings and this sensation never stops hurting me. Does anyone else suffer from these symptoms?"

      Just picked up a bottle of Crisco and a 4 pack of batteries from Walgreens.  Crisco always seems dirty on its own, but the C cells suggested some additional level of depravity.  Does vegetable oil conduct?  Some sort of auto-electro-lubricatory ridiculousness?

      I'd been wanting to see a game at  urlLink Wrigley  for a while now and finally had the chance a couple weekends ago. 
  
Moreso than even Fenway, Wrigley Field is all about the old timey baseball feel.  Instead of a Jumbotron, there's an electromotive scoreboard for keeping track of balls and strikes and hand-turned placards for everything else.  I was sitting dead center in the outfield bleachers, directly beneath the scoreboard.  Whenever there was a one ball count, you'd hear an electric whine from the board laboring to display that number.  During the 7th inning stretch, rows of heads popped out of the empty holes on the scoreboard to see the guest conductor lead the crowd in Take Me Out to the Ballgame.
  
From the outfield, you can't see any ads at Wrigley.  There are two small video strips in the grandstand that show the score and have a Sears logo.  Aside from that, nothing.  Quite the contrast to PacBell park.
  
At one point, some of the rowdy bleacherfolk I was sitting near tried to start the wave.  They were mercilessly heckled and revealed to be out-of-towners posing as locals.  A guy in my row turned to the would-be wavers and said, "I was born 3 blocks from here and have been coming to Wrigley my entire life.  So let me tell you, there's no fucking wave!"  Right on.
  
Modern baseball park design has focused a lot on trying to incorporate the stadium into the city rather than just dump it on the side of some highway.  Nowhere is that neighborhood feel more authentic than at Wrigley.  From our seats, I could look straight down Waveland and Sheffield Avenues.  And in addition to the folks watching from the rooftops across the street, I saw parents playing catch with their kids in the street, others flying kites outside the park.  Wrigley is the neighborhood.
  
All this and the Cubs won.  Certainly, not disappointing.

      When Errol Morris talks about self-deception, he doesn't do so from a superior position of "This only happens to other people."  He argues that we all self-deceive; perception easily deludes us into thinking of ourselves as protagonists in our own personal dramas.  Well, maybe not Buddhists or something.
  
It's this sense that's lacking from  urlLink Spellbound , the spelling bee documentary.  There's a lot of "Man, these kids and their parents are freaks" and not enough of "And so are we all."  
  
The kids are wonderfully dorky and the movie has great narrative tension.  But instead of pulling back to show the spelling bee as just one of the many ways we create arbitrary definitions of 'smart' and 'successful', the movie tacks on some ad hoc conclusions about the American Dream.  Spelling as the great American scholastic tradition and lots of Algerisms about how anyone can succeed in this Great Land.
  
Bah.
  
The flipside of Errol Morris' argument about Perception: The Great Deluder is that there is such a thing as historical truth.  "There's a real world in which real things happen.  And in some small way, my job is to look at that world and to try to figure out what those things might be."
  
Andrew Jarecki's documentary  urlLink Capturing the Friedmans  takes a somewhat different slant.  In this story about a Long Island family torn apart by a pedophilia and sex abuse scandal, the hook is that it's all on tape.  The Friedmans were meticulous in recording their familial meltdown and surely there's some interesting stuff going on about the American compulsion for  urlLink self-documentation .
  
Of course, the alleged abuse itself, that's not on film.  Most likely because it never happened.  There's a lot of Thin Blue Line moments with prosecutors and witnesses doing a great job discrediting themselves.  But Jarecki's not coming down one way or the other, and, according to  urlLink Debbie Nathan , that's part of the marketing strategy: "While the film was in production, Jarecki told the Friedman family he thought the two were innocent of the charges. Polling viewers at Sundance in January, he was struck by how they were split over Arnold and Jesse's guilt. Since then, he's crafted a marketing strategy based on ambiguity, and during Q&As and interviews, he has studiously avoided taking a stand. Teaser ads pitch the film as a Long Island Rashomon: 'Who do you believe?' For Jarecki and his PR people, the question is rhetorical." 
That ain't so cool, Mr. Moviefone.  It's much more interesting to walk the tightrope between "the struggle with perception" and "the truth is out there".  To wit, Errol Morris' next movie, Fog of War, consisting solely of interviews with Robert McNamara.  In this LA Times  urlLink piece , Morris says: "What it does is take you inside someone's head. It's part dream, part history, part self-analysis, part self-justification, part mystery.
   
People say nothing can redeem McNamara's conduct during the war, and maybe that's true. But the fact is he's trying to grapple with who he is, trying to come to an understanding of himself and the world. And just because there is one voice, that doesn't mean I wasn't hard on him, it doesn't mean the voice is left alone in some uncritical way." 
I can't wait.

      Sigh.
  
My adopted home state has decided to do its impression of what democracy looks like in a recently westernized Baltic country.  
  
With all the recall talk, I had some trouble tracking down what the ballot will look like come October 7.  It's not good.
  
According to this  urlLink article  there will be two questions.  First, an up or down on Gray Davis.  Then, if the answer is down, the election of the replacement governor.  
  
The election of the replacement governor (who will serve until 2007) will be based solely on a first past the post vote.  No redistributive voting, no ranking - just winner take all. 
  
This is a bad system of voting in general, but absolutely retarded when the election is going to happen in less than 80 days and the field will be flooded with any random weirdo who's managed to get 65 signatures.  Like the  urlLink guy  who's running on the legalization of domestic ferrets platform.  
  
A lot of the commentary about the recall has been very folksy.  Isn't America great?  We've got accountability for our leaders and anyone can run for office. 
  
Yeah, anyone can run.  But with only 80 days to campaign, it's not going to be about who's got the best ideas for how to fix California's problems.  It's going to be about who has the most money and name recognition.  And, yes, these are the dominant factors in modern politics anyway, but they will be the only factors for a hyper-crowded field of candidates with no real time for debate.
  
Which means we're totally getting Arnold.  
  
And I didn't move to California to end up living in Minnesota.

       urlLink Errol Morris : You know, I have this version of the expulsion from the Garden of Eden. 
  
God, in expelling Adam and Eve, kind of felt bad. He had gotten very angry, right? You know, you get angry and then you feel, "Well, maybe I overreacted." 
  
So, God was in that kind of mood when he expelled Adam and Eve from the garden. But his hands were tied. He had to go through with it; he had made the decision. God doesn't want to constantly second-guess himself. But he thought, "I know. I'll give them self-deception. Things are going to be truly horrendous out there, but they'll never notice."

      Political outcry only works if there's a handle.  Congress wasn't willing to make the larger argument that the war on Iraq was unjust.  But now there's the Case of the False Nigerian Uranium and all the would-be presidents are gearing up to beat the administration with its own  urlLink 16 words .  
  
To wit, Howard Dean's  urlLink got  16 Questions for President Bush.  The one I found most remarkable was: "4) Mr. President, we urgently need an explanation about the very serious charge that senior officials in your Administration may have retaliated against Ambassador Joseph Wilson by illegally disclosing that his wife is an undercover CIA officer." 
What!
  
The source is a Nation  urlLink article  and, apparently, senior officials used Bob Novak to out the wife of Ambassador Wilson.  All because Wilson came out with the story that there never was any reason to believe that Iraq was getting uranium from Africa.

      When Aaron and I saw Winged Migration, he said that the music really reminded him of  urlLink Nights in White Satin  (extended version).  I said it sounded like  urlLink something else .
  
Last night, I heard the 8 minute version of Nights for the first time and I feel I've seen the other side.  There simply isn't a more pretentious song.  The song builds into a majestic orchestral surge and the breaks down into a spoken  urlLink word  litmag crapfest: "Bedsitter people look back and lament Another day's useless energy's spent Impassioned lovers wrestle as one Lonely man cries for love and has none." 
I don't understand how this song was a hit.  Moreover, I don't understand how it was a hit 3 different times in Britain during the 70's.  People really couldn't find another song to make out to?

      Jeffrey Lee Parson gets made fun of by the  urlLink NYT  for not disguising his identity when he launched the Blaster worm: "As a byproduct of each infection, every victim's computer sent signals back to the 't33kid.com' Web site that Parson had registered in his own name, listing his home address.

Congrats to the Paper of Record for being hip to l33t-speak.  The editor of Virus Bulletin further ribs Parson for being so conspicuous, "I guess we should praise the Lord for stupid people, right?"

      From Nelson's  urlLink blog , I learned the State Fair's this weekend ... home of many fine attractions, including: 
 B.J. the Goodwill Ambassador  
Look for this charming puppet in his Coca-Cola Model-T meeting and greeting guests and handing out souvenirs to his new friends! 
 
Speaking of  urlLink Big Fun , I watched the commentary to Heathers last night and learned many fun facts. 
 There's a lot of Kubrick infatuation: director, Michael Lehmann made everyone watch Full Metal Jacket before the shoot - hence, the ultra-wide angle lens look.   
 Writer, Daniel Waters, also loves Kubrick.  Originally, the movie ended with the death of Winona.  In one version, she was to have watched Christian Slater explode, give the kiss-off to Shannon Doherty and then siddle up to Martha Dumptruck ... who pulls out a gun, says "Fuck you, Heather" and shoots Veronica in the mouth.  As Veronica lays dying, Dumptruck rises from her motorized wheelchair and exclaims, "I can walk!"   
 Kubrick love notwithstanding, Lehmann and Waters ... really never did anything ever again.  Waters next wrote Ford Fairlane and then Hudson Hawk.  Lehmann last directed 40 Days and 40 Nights.  Sad, really.

      The first time I heard Birdhouse in Your Soul was on a mix tape of  urlLink Aaron's  sister.  Because it came right after It's the End of the World as We Know It, for a long time I thought REM sang Birdhouse as well.  I had a troubled youth, in many respects.
  
Just got back from seeing the They Might Be Giants documentary,  urlLink Gigantic , and it was a rockin', dorky good time.  I've never had a stronger mimetic experience than watching high school debaters argue over the meaning of Particle Man.  
But the most impressive thing to me was what was left out.  Somewhere toward the end, there's footage of the two Johns doing a release show at Tower Records for Mink Car.  The card reads "September 10, 2001 - Midnight in Manhattan."  And you're just like, "Oh, man here it comes - time to make contact with the great touchstone of national tragedy."  Instead, you've got TMBG singing  urlLink New York City , and the film simply transitions from the record store appearance to a stage performance of the same song.  And that's it.  No falling towers - no channel-flip style news footage.

      After walking to a lighthouse surrounded by an old growth forest, I decided to do my Zelda: Wind Waker imitation today.  I rented a motor boat from up in  urlLink Horseshoe Bay .  
I was a little worried that since I lost my driver's license a while back, I might have some trouble.  Turns out there aren't many rules up here in regards to renting a boat.  You don't need to actually know how to drive one.  You don't need to wear a life jacket.  Basically, you just get in the thing and point it at the pretty stuff.  
And, man, is it fun.  Howe Sound is dotted with islands you can zip around, some of them peopled by lazy sea lions.  I was amazed by the distance I covered in 2 1/2 hours.
  
Having spent the afternoon communing with marine life, I decided to spend the evening eating it.  Whole mess of oysters, whole mess of trout.  Good times.

I walked all over Stanley Park which, I feel, is better than NYC's Central and SF's Golden Gate if only because there's an unlimited number of places where you can stop and eat salmon.
  
But the real kicker was the all-you-can-eat japanese restaurant.  In some ways I feel I'd been waiting for that meal all my life.  12 dishes later I stumbled back to my hotel.  
Tomorrow I predict there will be more eating.

       urlLink Letterboxing  is a particular type of scavenger hunt in which the goal is to decipher a clue leading to a box.  The box contains a logbook and a rubber stamp.  When you find the box, you stamp the box's book and use its stamp to stamp your own.
  
So: clue -> box -> stamp & stamp.  
  
Apparently, this all  urlLink started  in Dartmoor, England when a guy left his business card in a bottle.  Hobbies have a funny way of getting out of hand.  Now there are between 10 and 40 thousand letterboxes hidden in Dartmoor alone and a published catalog listing the clues.  Letterboxers have a scoring code to indicate how many boxes they've found and left.  And there are funny variants of letterboxes like the Hitchhiker box - a letterbox placed inside another letterbox and moved from place to place when it is found.

Derek Jeter on the situation: "They're canceling everything around here -- schools are canceled, the government left, the Navy's pulling out, and the Orioles and Yankees are playing baseball."

      The debate still  urlLink rages .  My favorite theory:
 "K" is short for "Thousand", as in Kilobyte, and therefore "K-Rad" means "A Thousand Times As Rad".

      My hometown has seen better days.  First, a school board member called down a  urlLink curse  upon the mayor for allowing a corporate turnaround firm to close down 16 schools ... which, you know, fair enough, sometimes cursing's all that's left.  
  
But now, they've got  urlLink digital bugles  playing Taps at our military funerals and clearly it's only a matter of time until one of them's accidentally set to Reveille.

      I've been warning people about the impending demise of the banana for weeks.  Most are dubious in a "that asteriod's not really gonna hit us" sort of way.  But really, as the Guardian  urlLink explains , it's all a matter of time.
  
The bananas we enjoy today are mutants and susceptible to fungi like yellow Sigatoka.  In fact, such a fungus would have completely wiped out bananas in the 1950s if not for the heroic Cavendish variant.  But now! there's a new form of Sigatoka ... black Sigatoka.  And the Cavendish is imperiled.
  
There is some  urlLink hope  that a new hybrid may save the day.  But only if we get the world's best  deep core driller  mutant fruit hybridizer and his ragtag crew of misfits to head on down to Honduras and show those boys at FHIA what real cross-breeding is all about!

      The whole  urlLink Omnimax &nbsp; urlLink v. &nbsp urlLink IMAX  thing has confused me for a while.  The Metreon in SF has an IMAX theatre, but it's not of the domed, planetarium style.  It's more of the "WHOA! That sucker's HUGE!" style.  After seeing so many movies projected on tiny multiplex screens, it's really something to see Matrix Reloaded on a 80' x 100' megasurface.  
  
Basically, you end up seeing a lot more detail.  Laurence Fishburne's face is quite bumpy, for example. 
  
The side effect is that if a small gnat happens to settle on the projection glass, you end up with a 25' killer bug stuck on the side of Keanu's face.

      Matt Groening  urlLink says  that Fox News threatened to sue over an episode featuring a fake news crawl.  Apparently, the crawl featured such stories as: 
Democrats cause cancer? Find out at foxnews.com ... Rupert Murdoch: Terrific dancer ... Dow down 5000 points ... Study: 92 per cent of Democrats are gay ... JFK posthumously joins Republican Party ... Oil slicks found to keep seals young, supple. 
Some of which are almost as funny as "Network sues self."

       urlLink Camille Paglia 's a nut.  She's compelling because she intermixes pop culture and social critique.  And, you know, my generation's greatest contribution to the world is obsessive Simpsons-quoting, so I'm all about stuff like:
 
What a bunch of crap this Clark boom is. Clark reminds me of Keir Dullea in "2001: A Space Odyssey" -- a blank, vacant expression, detached and affectless. There's something sexually neutered about Dullea in that film -- a physical passivity necessitated by cramped space travel -- that I also find in Clark.
 
Sci-fi + sexual identity + politics ... I'm with ya'.
  
But then she's gotta go poop all over blogs:
 
Blog reading for me is like going down to the cellar amid shelves and shelves of musty books that you're condemned to turn the pages of. Bad prose, endless reams of bad prose!
 
While, in the next breath claiming she invented them (fair warning here, Camille ... this is a crowded field):
 
Now and then one sees the claim that Kausfiles was the first blog. I beg to differ: I happen to feel that my Salon column was the first true blog.
 
Really her issue is that there's no blog super-celebrity.  That someone needs to do for blogs what Rush Limbaugh did for AM radio - make it "buzzing and vibrant" with voices that have "energy and vision."
  
To which I say, first, we already have these  urlLink folks .  And, second, my  urlLink debate team  kicked your butt!

      Netflix will mail you your complete rental history upon request (a partial list is available online).  In 134 days of being a subscriber, I've rented 79 movies.  So, 0.6 movies a day seems a bit ridiculous ... I mean I do leave my house and, like, bathe.
  
It would be nice to have that list, maybe sorted by ranking, in an XML feed.  I'm not a huge "must document everything about me in a sidebar" person, but I could get behind including that list on my blog.  Or at least a link to the movie most recently seen.

      The worst type of DVD commentary is when the director decides to narrate the film.  
  
"He's walking down the hall to get to the bedroom.  When he gets there he will sit on the bed ... our set designer is a genius, by the way, completely captured the feeling of the bed."
  
Of course, the exception to this rule is a movie where you find yourself saying "What the hell were they thinking here - who thought this was going to work?"  In other words, the Logan's Run commentary track.
  
The costume designer pops up once in a while with such gems as "Well, this is a future society based on free-love and free-expression.  So we didn't really see the need for anyone to wear underwear."
  
But the majority of the justifications come from director Michael Anderson.  For example, the ice cave scene.  Logan 5 and Jessica 69 have just escaped from Hamster City and find themselves moistened and alone in the layer of the evil robot, Box.  This gives rise to one of the great lines in any movie, "It's freezing ... let's take our clothes off."
  
Director Anderson explains, "Well, they were freezing ... and thought their clothes might freeze ... so they decide to get undressed.  And then they wrap themselves in some furs that are lying about ... which god knows how those things got there."
  
Sadly, no deleted scenes on the DVD and according to the commentary there are many.  The Sex Shop scene got cut way down because of censors.  (Anderson on this: "It's a shame because we spent hours applying flesh covered tape")  And, in a scene cut from the above-mentioned Box lair, the dastardly crapbot tricks our heroes into getting naked (again!) so that he can sculpt them in ice.
  
Hopefully, there'll be a Platinum Edition one day.

      Today's my  urlLink brother 's birthday.  When we were kids, and I was waiting for him to die in Super Mario Bros., I would use the other controller to 'control' the bad guys.
  
"I'm that Koopa that got you.  Fear my turtle wrath!"
  
This may explain why I'm a Yankees fan today.  Yeah, we're the Big Bad of MLB ... ruining the game by buying up everyone and winning so much.  The Evil Empire.
  
Evil because the Yankees have more money to spend than anyone, an owner willing to spend it, and a lack of any rules to prevent that from happening.  It's really great.  When I was sitting around with some Yankees cohorts watching the ALDS a couple weekends back, there was a lot of "Hey - that guy's pretty good.  Maybe we can buy him before the next round."
  
There are some drawbacks.  You get called  urlLink names .  You gotta worry about getting jumped in a Boston sports bar if you cheer too demonstrably.  But still, when your team comes back on Pedro to win Game Seven with a walk-off homer in extra innings, it doesn't feel evil at all.  In fact, it feels real good.
  
It's understandable why Red Sox fans would want to experience this for themselves one day.  But the truth is, there's solace to be had in the Curse.  I mean, for one, it's all the BoSox have.  It's not like there's moral superiority in having only the second highest payroll in baseball ... selling out the Green Monster in order to grab a few more dollars (Hint: get your own TV network ... very lucrative).
  
And, second, I don't think they've thought about what would happen if they won.  It's not like it actually erases all those other botched opportunities.  Now, you're just the team who's won once in a hundred years rather than this super-mysterious tortured team of doom that's haunted throughout the ages by a fat man in pinstripes.  That's the thing that suprised me about all the Cubs v. Red Sox hype - how does that work out well for anyone.  All you end up with is a team who's Curse wasn't as big and hairy as the other guys.  No one wins ... someone just loses more.
  
So, embrace the Curse, Boston.  It's what makes you special. 
  
There's also a lot to be said for certainty.  Now, I've got to worry about the team of freaks from Florida and the fact that Mariano Rivera's arm may fall off and that we've got no starters on full rest.  The Yankees win a lot, but they still haven't figured out how to win all the time.  
  
Maybe if we can buy Pedro.

      Something I never realized about WarGames until I listened to the writer/director commentary ... Joshua's voice is a processed and cut-up version of John Wood (Falken) reading the dialogue backwards.  
  
Which is funny because Falken was supposed to be a ornithological-proxy for Stephen Hawking ... wheelchair and all.  The idea got dropped when Hawking was asked how he felt about it.  He said that he would be interested in talking if, in fact, the filmmakers were interested in him because of his work as opposed to his affliction.
  
Yeah, not so much.
  
There's some discussion about the kinds of things WarGames accurately predicted.  In particular, they take credit for inventing the  urlLink war dailer .  But they couldn't understand why having computers talk hasn't caught on more.

      From the liner notes to Dear Catastrophe Waitress:
 There are four towers to choose from though.  Orthanc, Morgul, Tirith and Barar-Dur.  
 I'm surprised Tolkien didn't give the Hobbits a tower as well. 
  
Well they had a sort of mound.
  
They (sic) are twelve ways you can  urlLink pick  two towers from four, right? 
In related news, in listening to the Themselves remix album, I noticed there's this slowed down sample in Home Work that goes, "He's gone back on his old job - hauling sand.  No!  He's working at the office, that's right."  
  
It's a quote from Florence Rasmussen, the Sweet Ol' Grandma from Hell, who shows up in the middle of Errol Morris' first film, Gates of Heaven.

You know, today was Yom Kippur and while I ate lunch like normal, I'm guessing that Holy Joe didn't - I'm surprised I couldn't find a press release on this, actually.

      Jinxes are an interesting thing.  I had predicted that this weekend the Red Sox would see their hopes dashed and was proved, infuriatingly, wrong.  I blame myself.  Still I had the good luck to be able to watch the game with a bunch of old college friends - cursing the TV and  urlLink Joe Morgan .
  
The game was cursed because of the A's penchant for squandering every opportunity to put away the BoSox.  Joe Morgan was cursed because ... well, largely just out of tradition.  In post-seasons past, we got into a bad habit of throwing soda cans during Morgan- & Miller-commentated games.
  
The A's have lost 8 straight games in which they've had the opportunity to clinch a post-season series.  Here's hoping their luck will change tonight.

      I'm experiencing insomnia for the first time this weekend in Boston.  It's just like being awake all the time.  I feel I could be a much more productive, yet insane, person if this were to keep up for a few more days.
  
Despite that, I had an excellent time at Day One of BloggerCon.  Great panel on education filled with passionate folks and new ideas about how to make blogs work in schools.  And not to be too aw-shuckish, but it's been a real treat meeting folks who say "I use  urlLink Blogger  - thanks so much"  and then getting to hear their ideas on what we should do next.

      Mathworld has this kick-ass  urlLink page  on special numbers and number theory.  
  
Maybe that wasn't the greatest sell.
  
But how great is it that we've got folks who can spend time finding and naming special numbers like the  urlLink Vampire Number .  A vampire number is one with an even number of digits that is the product of a combination of its digits.  So, 1260 is a vampire number because 21 x 60 = 1260.  
  
Here's the great part.  If a number is a vampire number, the pair of numbers multiplied together to form it are called its fangs.  Fangs!  Mathematicians are wacky.
  
They've also got some fascinating info about the  urlLink Beast Number , 666.
  
I'd never before heard the theory that the reason it's 666 is because in roman numerals it contains one of each symbol (sans M): DCLXVI.

      In the PS2 game, Ico, you're a behorned kid that must escort a princess through a giant castle.  
  
It's the best game ever made.  
  
Recently, I played Prince of Persia: Sands of Time which reminded me a lot of Ico as you're a very athletic kid who occasionally escorts a princess through a giant castle, engaging in acrobatic ass whoopin' along the way.  The acrobatics are particularly nice - lots of swinging, wall running, Ninja Gaiden-style wall-hopping.  
  
But, the whooping of ass is a little formulaic.  The baddies are slow and telegraph their moves in a "Grr!  I'm swinging this hammer around my head cause soon I'm gonna try and hit you" sort of way.  The first time you run up a sand troll's belly to slo-mo flip over his head and slice him up on the way down, it's impressive.  When you realize that that's all you need to do to beat 80% of the bad guys, it's a bit tedious.
  
Prince of Persia's level design is expansive and beautiful - doing flips while balancing atop the Ultimate Tower of Doom at sunset is breathtaking in both a pretty and a "that's gonna hurt" way.  And they do the little stuff well, like leaving trails of dust behind you after you wall scramble and doing clever things to avoid the feeling of load times.
  
Finally, you can  urlLink unlock  a fully-playable version of the first Prince of Persia game.  Which certainly is cool, but man did I quickly grow frustrated.  I don't know what we were all doing before analog controls.  I ended up humping the wall repeatedly because I'd overrun the place where I needed to jump - something I remember being endlessly amusing when I first played the game on my Mac SE.  Less fun now.

      Today I sold the '89 Camry that I had shipped out to California back in  urlLink May .  A car with 150K miles on it wasn't up to the daily grind of a 70 mile round-trip commute.  It's brakes needed to be replaced, the muffler was shot, it needed a new radiator and the driver's side door lock had been turned into a gaping hole by folks looking to steal the fat load of nothing I kept in my car.  
So, farewell.  
I'm happy that I was able to unload it without any hassle and that its new owner is a grizzled hippie mechanic who will make the necessary repairs and turn the car over to a young cousin just learning to drive.

      Biz has made it across the country, all the way to Mountain View.  I didn't realize that along the way he left an audblog  urlLink post  from Iowa in which he bagged on 2 Mid-Western institutions.
  
First off,  urlLink Steak n' Shake  is incredible.  I mean sure, not a safe haven for vegans given the foodstuffs it's named after.  But trying to impale the maraschino cherry at the bottom of an orange freeze is one of my fonder childhood challenges.
  
Second, the convenience store named Kum n' Go.  Okay ... this really isn't a Mid-West institution.  I only ran across one once when visiting  urlLink Matt  in Kirksville.  But its name and the fact that the locals refered to it as the Ejaculate n' Evacuate captures both the irony-free superficiality of the Mid-West and its underlying sad wit soul.  
  
Ah, home.
  
 Update : My mom tells me that in her day they refered to Steak n' Shake as Stoke n' Choke.  I'm trying not to think about what this phrase meant to the youth with whom my mom parked back in said day.

      According to the  urlLink IHT , the director of Brazilian staging of Tristan und Isolde mooned the audience when he was booed on opening night.  
  
His opera seems fairly ridiculous ... a woman masturbates during the overture, there's a chorus of Hasidic Jews - it sounds like Springtime for Hitler, but for real.  So, you know, maybe booing was appropriate.  
  
What's wacky is that he'd now being tried on indecent exposure charges ... in Brazil!  Where, I've been told, the whole country's indecently exposed.  
  
What's next?  Folks getting charged for public drunkeness in Scotland?  Excessive cheese-eating in France?  Crude national stereotyping in America?!

      Jason Sutter gave me the Goonies DVD for my birthday and I'd been trying to hold off watching the commentary, but finally succumbed to temptation this past weekend when I found myself uncharacteristically bereft of fresh Netflix.
  
The DVD does not disappoint.
  
The commentary features all of the original kids ... even Short Round from Temple of Doom.  What's more, they videotaped the commentary session so the movie will occassionally go into picture-in-picture mode so you can bathe in all of Sean Astin's plumpness and Corey Feldman's assholic irrelevance.
  
Sean Astin's the big highlight here.  Apparently, he's not well liked.  At all.  
  
Repeatedly he will start to tell a story - usually one that starts off very promisingly such as "Cyndi Lauper, there's something I've always wanted to tell you" - only to be cut-off and trounced by someone else in the cast.   People just talk over him and if he persists they'll throw in some kinda Rudy or Samwise Gamgee jibe to really shut him up.  Even Jeff "Chunk" Cohen gets in on the action.  This is a guy who never appeared in movies again, went on to win student body president on a "Vote for Chunk" campaign and is now a lawyer of some kind.  He gets to beat up on the Son of Gomez.
  
I think it has something to do with Sean Astin being the only commercially successful actor left from the cast.  There's a lot of "in this scene, you can almost hear Sean thinking about what this movie means for his career."  Which really makes not a ton of sense as before he landed the role of Frodo's manfriend, he most recently portrayed Hercules in the video game Kingdom Hearts.  
  
Eventually all the abuse proves too much for the omega hobbit and he bails on the commentary session well before his dramatic speech at the bottom of the Wishing Well.  The man quits the commentary! 
  
This does not lessen the abuse.
  
Also on the DVD is the epic, two-part music video for Cyndi Lauper's theme song, Good Enough.  It picks up where Girls Just Wanna Have fun left off ... that is with Captain Lou Albano.  The whole thing last twelve minutes and ends with Andre the Giant scaring off the Iron Sheik and Rowdy Roddy Piper who play both pirates and evil foreign investors.  It's all very confusing.

      So, I've got an obsession involving a chicken.  And a sheep.  And a pregnant cow.
  
Every day, I am compelled to gather the eggs, pet my sheep and feed my knocked-up cow.
  
My name is Jason and I am a  urlLink Harvest Moon  addict.  Harvest Moon: Friends of Mineral Town for the Game Boy Advance, to be specific.  
  
One of the key aspects that makes this farming sim so consuming is that each day you only have a certain amount of time and strength to make things happen for your pixelated livestock.  You've got to make your animal friends happy (so that they'll produce higher quality eggs, wool and milk) while simultaneously working on your 5 Year Plan for Agrarian Life Fulfillment.
  
Sitting atop the Harvest Moon pyramid of needs, above even Win the Sumo Chicken Contest or Teach Your Dog to Catch a Frisbee, lies Getting Hitched.  And there are many fine ladies from which to choose.   
  
Initially I was courting Popuri, the chicken farmer's daughter, because, not to be crass, she seemed kinda easy.  All she ever wanted was flowers and those were easy to come by.  
  
But then she showed up at my house looking for treats on Halloween and I was all "First off, this is a holiday for kids and I'm not looking for no child bride.  And second, we are so not in the point in our relationship where you can just show up at my house, when I'm trying to tend to my crop of eggplants, and demand that I provide you with snacks."
  
So now I've got my eye on the tomboy-ish barmaid.  I hear she likes eggs.

      Finding Nemo does all things I've come to expect from a great Pixar flick: funny characters with entertaining celebrity voices, lots of meta-pop culture jokes, a bunch of anthropomorphic/"Sharks don't really have 12 step programs" gags.  Nemo is the most impressive of their stable because it also looks pretty as all get out.  The design philosophy is all about density of information - packing in a crazy number of plants and animals into every under-seascape.  There's so much stuff going on that the background is frequently more compelling, from a dramatic standpoint, than the narrative.
  
Which is why it's super-hot that they built in a DVD feature that allows you to soak in the digital coolness.   Most DVDs boast a "interactive animated menu" feature - which is basically one step beyond simply saying "contains movie" - but Finding Nemo repurposes the idea.  Each menu of the DVD contains an animated background and a button that allows you to drop out the titles and main soundtrack.  So you're left with just the infinite loop of, say, sea anemones gently swaying.  
  
Kick ass!

      First, the  urlLink power  goes out for a big chunk of San Francisco.  And now we've got  urlLink earthquakes , what with the ground moving and the shaking and such.
  
This is my second quake ... it was like being on a boat, gently rocking.  Afterwards I felt landsick; appreciably dizzy and sort of sick to my stomach.
  
Not to be excessively naive, but this is what makes earthquakes really interesting and sort of personally terrifying.  I have this expectation from the ground that it's not going move and 99.99% of my life that's been a fair assumption.  And then it's not true.  In a very significant way. 
  
It's as if gravity were to be dimmed down a bit for a few seconds - just a little bit of lightness, like going over the hump on a rollercoaster, but in a way that you could tell was affecting people for miles around, not just you in your rickety car.  
  
It's the inescapable bigness of the thing that's amazing rather than just the thing itself.

It's erotica, not porn. It's speculative fiction, not sci fi. To which the only honest response is: Bullshit.

      The Believer is based loosely on the true story of a Jewish neo-Nazi.  In the film, Danny Balint is an incredibly articulate skinhead whose arguments in favor of anti-semitism and murdering Jews are based in his childhood yeshiva studies.  And also, he gets to bone Summer Phoenix.  
  
There's a pivotal scene where he and his bald droogs vandalize a synagogue - spray painting swastikas, tearing up prayer books, peein' on stuff ... the usual.  But Danny can't go through with descrecating a torah.  Unsurprisingly, the gentile neo-nazis aren't exactly won over by being told about the special sacredness of the torah and Danny ends up taking home the torn up torah in order to repair it.  Which, you know, is like a symbol for his return to judaism.  
  
This is a great movie, what with the self-struggle and the contradtions and the unsympathetic hero.  Good.  
So, of course, it's gonna be a rabbi at the Simon Wiesenthal Center who  urlLink stops it  from seeing wide distribution.
  
The scene I described is the one that gave him pause because it's "a primer for anti-semitism."  Or, you know, a scene about challenging anti-semitism ... depending on which movie you saw.
  
Also, it's interesting to note that the director (who was a non-practicing Jew that became re-enjewed because of making this movie) went to all sorts of lengths to mitigate his guilt around showing the torah being torn.  For example, they found a section of the torah that didn't include the name of God and offset that to make a whole scroll's worth.

      According to  urlLink this article  from the NYT, NASA's Mars rover  urlLink site  has received 32 million visitors in the past three weeks.
  
The thing I've been most impressed about with the rover missions is the amount of information NASA has made available.  They're seemingly posting every image the rovers capture and are even including  urlLink screenshots  to show the controller-eye view of the rollout on Mars.
  
What's more they compliment the raw data aspect with a bunch of well put together videos on the technical aspects of the mission.  For example, the cg  urlLink animations  of the decent and landing stuff really breaks down just how amazingly difficult it is to land on another planet.  
  
The NYT piece rightly points out that this openness has helped folks (like me) feel a greater connection to the rovers.   And by connection, I mean obsession: The flow of updates from Mars has led to a new addiction among some Americans, who find themselves checking for news dozens of times a day. In interviews, many reported feeling depression and withdrawal symptoms when the Spirit stopped communicating last week. That NASA kept up the information flow even while suffering serious setbacks is really a testament to how much they want to share the science.  And now that there are two functional rovers on Mars, there should be twice as many updates, right ... right?!

      First, there was the local radio station who introduced Nine Inch Nails' "Closer" as 'classic alternative.' 
  
Now, it's the fact that I'm developing a serious Sunday routine that involves rebalding myself, drinking chai tea and reading Harpers.
  
In the latest issue, there's a great piece by Carter Burwell (who's the composer for all of the Coen brother's movies) about the music written for the news.  Ultimately, it's about how the networks chose a different type of music for the latest war in Iraq than they did during the first.  Peter Fish, the composer for CBS, is quoted as saying: "The second time it was more like they were trying to promote the war the same way they would promote Terminator 3 - it was like "Battle of the Megaheroes."  So the first time what I delivered was vaguely militaristic ... the second time it was just Techno-Ali vs. Frazier-IV, we're-going-to-knock-the-crap-out-of-them music." 
There's also a great excerpt from Don DeLillo that was part of a Lee Harvey Oswald documentary.  I'm definitely going to read his book Libra soon. "If there was a plot, it was small, crude, and largely improvised - not the master plan that would allegedly balance the loss of the president.  Our state in the world, the fact that we are human, is the only element the equation needs in order to be balanced.  We're able to think into the stars, imagine alternative lives for ourselves, and there are times when we feel equal, some of us, to the vast social reality around us.  What else would make a man decide he might run for president?"

      I'm watching live coverage on my laptop, over wireless, of the Opportunity rover's  urlLink landing on Mars .
  
And incidentally, at work we occassionally have to do a reboot on a production machine - not that this is completely out of the ordinary or particularly serious, but, you know, it's always possible the machine's not coming back.  If it doesn't, you have to get somebody to go to the cage and physically restart the bastard and hope that it hasn't gone dark forever.  
  
All of this can be stressful but it's not as if the computer in question is on another frickin' planet.  It's damn impressive that the folks at JPL were able to re-establish contact with Spirit.  This whole deal is truly geekery in its highest form.

      The worst thing I ever lost was a one-foot headphone extension cable.  
  
Several years ago, I bought a pair of Sony egg-style  urlLink headphones  and they are still my favorite pair.  The fact that they continue to have flawless sound is amazing as they've been kicked around in my backpack every day for over 3 years.  What's more I prefer them to my more expensive studio headphones which, really, was just showing off.
  
Anyway, they're made for the MD market, so they come with a short cord to fit nicely with the wired remotes you find on nearly all MD players.  But they also shipped with a short extension cord, just in case you were using them on a remoteless device, like a laptop.  Which I did.
  
And then I forgot to take out the extension cord before turning in my laptop at my last job.  And since then I've been frustrated by cables.
  
Nowhere seems to sell the short cord, so I had to get some six-foot monster with extra-gnarled sheathing.  The looks you get from airplane seat neighbors when you pull out a gordian knot of goofycord are none too kind.

      In the slow-burning chemical process that controls when I do my laundry, clean underwear is the limiting reagent.  You just can't go to long without clean drawers.
  
The specific trigger is when I reach the last pair, which is always the same pair as they're my least favorite.  They're cotton shorts I got during orientation week when I was a freshman.  They really should be boxers, so I don't feel bad using them as such.  Whether they should still be my omega undergarment after 9 years is debatable.  
  
The real problem is that since they're shorts, they have pockets - which is wacky but harmless.  But they've also got no fly ... which is a nightmare.
  
Also, there's a lag between when I receive the "nothing but flyless shorts left" signal and the time I actually have clean laundry again.  So my awkward time at the urinal can go on longer than it should.  Nothing untoward, mind you ... just a couple days.  I'm a very hygenic person normally.  Really.
  
Anyway, all I'm saying is that I've got a dresser stacked high with clean underwear, and it feels good.

      There's a scene in the restored version of Spartacus where Laurence Olivier attempts to seduce his recently acquired bath slave, Tony Curtis.  Yeah, hard to see how that one didn't make it in the original 1960 release.
  
I hadn't seen Spartacus before but I'd heard about the scene in Celluloid Closet. Tony Curtis mentions that his character recoils and ultimately runs away when he realizes that Olivier's talk about oysters and snails is really none-to-subtle code for "Did I mention I'm a Roman played by Olivier and you're my bath slave."  In the documentary, Curtis said of the scene "'Take me out to dinner first ... show me a good time.  Don't get me in the bath and drop the soap.'"
  
What I didn't know was that when the scene was put back in for the 1991 release that Tony Curtis had to redub the dialogue.  And what's more Olivier was dead so they had Anthony Hopkins read his lines!
  
It's odd.  It's as though, in 20 years, they were going to re-release The Dead Zone and had Kevin Spacey fill in for the Christopher Walken part.
  
That's assuming that  urlLink Biz Stone  had better things to do.

I love the fact that OmniOutliner now comes with the OS.  I'd believed in my heart that outliners were really important, but I'd not gotten behind them in practice.  Now I understand the fuss.

The only thing I'm not wild about is the trackpad.  Musn't it be the case that user-testing would show the eraserhead mouse as the preferable laptop solution?

You're pushing it in and it's like "Well, it still hasn't caught ... still not catching ... man it's in pretty far, I wonder if it's - Holy Crap!"  But I'm willing to say that's just me.

      The Professor and the Madman by Simon Winchester tells the tale of how a schizophrenic Civil War veteran helped write the Oxford English Dictionary.  
  
The story behind the hook is quite simple to tell and really could have been covered in a decent magazine article.  So you end up with a lot of padding regarding the deterioriation of Dr. CrazyPants, the Mad-Speller of Connecticut (not the madman's actual name).  But you also get a lot of fun facts regarding the creation of the OED. 
  
There's lots of love heaped on the OED.  It's treated like a literary cathedral that took 70 years to create and is frequently called the most important work ever printed.  I'm cool with the love - the OED is certainly one of those pinnacles of human obsessive-complusiveness: "Not just every word ever spoken - but the original quotation for those words as well!"  
  
Winchester also has some good stuff on subjectivity in dictionaries; how the tone of the entries and choice of what to include are these fundamental choices by individuals going about the business of socially constructing language.  But that commentary is somewhat beside the point in this book and nowhere near as interesting as David Foster Wallace's  urlLink essay  on a similar topic.
  
On the plus side, there's also lots of fun facts about words and medical trivia.  For example:
 The surgical removal of the penis is at the best of times a dangerous practice, rarely performed even by doctors: An attack by the renowned Brazilian fishlet known as  candiru , which likes to swim up a man's urine stream and lodge in the urethra with a ring of retrorse spines preventing its removal, is one of the very rare circumstances in which doctor (sic) will perform the operation, known as peotomy. 
Note to self: never pee in Brazil.

       urlLink   My family came out to visit me in San Francisco during Christmas.  It's like going home for the holidays, but I didn't have to go anywhere.
  
The non-trip was a blast, and I had an especially great time hanging out with my brother.  Because we don't see each other for long stretches at a time, there's a lot I forget - specifically how much fun it is to have a brother.  First off, little brothers are just so fucking game for anything.  Do you know how I got David to pose for this photo?  I said, "Look, there's some big old nasty seaweed ... pick it up and pretend to eat it - I want to post pictures of that on the Internet."  Awesome.
  
Also, whenever we hang out it's like a giant dork braindump.  "Here's every game, scifi show and geeky thing I've seen since last we met."  My friends pointed out how similar we are in appearance and, like, vocal mannerisms.  Obviously, this is to be expected.  As Sutter said, "Is he not the person you've shared a bedroom with the longest?"  
  
It kicks ass.  There's like this other me living in Providence but with special skills.  Example:  
Me: Hey, Eugene.  Did you know my brother can sing the music from any video game he has ever played? 
Eugene: Okay, how 'bout Rygar? 
David: The first screen or the opening level?

      In the commentary for Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, you get some of the dirt as to why the original director, Alex Cox, was dumped from the project.  The producer, Laila Nabulsi talks about how there were creative differences and that it had something to do with the inclusion of the Wave Speech from the book.  That's the one that goes: 
We had all the momentum; we were riding the crest of a high and beautiful wave. So now, less than five years later, you can go up on a steep hill in Las Vegas and look West, and with the right kind of eyes you can almost see the high-water mark---the place where the wave finally broke and rolled back. 
In the new documentary,  urlLink Breakfast with Hunter , you get a much more detailed picture of what went down.  Filmmaker Wayne Ewing is there at Owl Farm when Alex Cox and co-writer Tod Davies come to visit to talk about the script ... which Hunter's not read.  So he's caught flat-footed when he finds out that their idea for the Wave is to show an animated version of Raoul Duke being carried back to Las Vegas after he tries to flee to LA at the midpoint of the story.  
  
Hunter's first reaction is to threaten to sue the filmmakers.  Then, he rants about how he hates animation and how this is simply turning his writing (and himself) into a gross characiture.   He goes on to say that this is the best writing he's ever done, that it's a giant fucking sapphire and they've turned into into a dumb fucking cartoon.
  
As Alex Cox tries to explain how it's all motivated by the Ralph Steadman illustrations, Tod Davies actually starts weeping because she feels her adaptation of the material is also a giant fucking sapphire.
  
It doesn't make any difference.  Which it shouldn't because it's a really stupid idea. 
  
In addition to reducing the text to a plot device, it's also a flawed metaphor.  The point is that the wave of Sixities Freakitude broke before it engulfed America and the world in its righteous patchouli-scented energy.  The speech is Hunter's lament for the failed movement and is great because it evokes the tweaked-out isolation and madness he feels being trapped in the American Nightmare of Las Vegas.  
  
As he says, the wave broke and rolled back - it's not gonna carry him anywhere.
  
Finally, Hunter threatens to kick the pair out and they take it upon themselves to skedaddle.  At this point, the documentary cuts to Hunter, Laila and Benicio del Toro watching the footage we just saw and figuring out that they'll need to get a new director.
  
Which, thankfully, they do.

      ... unless you're a black dude looking for a job.  NYT  urlLink reports : 51.8 percent of black men ages 16 to 64 held jobs in New York City in 2003. The rate for white men was 75.7 percent; for Hispanic men, 65.7; and for black women, 57.1. The employment-population ratio for black men was the lowest for the period Mr. Levitan has studied, which goes back to 1979. 
The cited report looks at the employment to population ratio as opposed to the more traditional unemployment rate.  With the former, you capture everyone who isn't working regardless of whether or not they actually looked for a job.
  
So, this is a number that conservatives would hate because they'd claim "A whole bunch of folks probably don't even want to work else they'd pull themselves up by their bootstraps in this great land of ours."
  
The article contains a baked-in response to this implicit argument. "If job losses land disproportionately on one group of people, a disproportionate share of that group may give up looking for work. In that case, changes in the unemployment rate for that group will tend to understate the relative impact of the recession on that group" 
This seems true.  It makes sense to think about aggregate, cultural effects, rather than just "This one person didn't look for a job because of his own failed internal motivation."

      See, here's a great  urlLink example  of rant from Rep. John Dingell (and courtesy of  urlLink Steve Yuhan ).
  
If you're a congressman from Michigan, you've got to be a pretty salty dog with respect to how blue collar workers have fared during the current administration / past 50 years.  And yet, Rep. Dingell was able to take a ludicrous decision by the Council of Economic Advisers to class fast food jobs as manufacturing positions and turn it into a funny (but pointed) screed: I am sure the 163,000 factory workers who have lost their jobs in Michigan will find it heartening to know that a world of opportunity awaits them in high growth manufacturing careers like spatula operator, napkin restocking, and lunch tray removal. 
Plus, all references to defunct McDonaldland characters should be applauded when made by elected officials.

      I'm not sure why but I've been coming across a lot of rants recently.
  
In the blog world, it's mostly "I have discovered this deal and now I must vent my venom upon it."  A lot are funny but there are a couple of rhetorical traps that these rants typically fall into.  
  
First off, more is not better.  Having a giant ordered list of reasons isn't usually effective.  Often it's numbing and you end up padding the list with trivial bits.  For example, "And why are people still using drop caps!  It's a webpage not an illuminated manuscript, you degenerate hack!"
  
That actually leads into the next common pitfall - self-righteousness.  I see a lot of political blogger taking pride in enumerating the logical fallacies in the arguments of their opponents.  Fallacies are fun to point out ... they've got cool latin names like reductio.  But too much of it just makes you look like an pompous ass.  As does writing stuff like "And to you I say, 'Fine! Be happy with your bowl of gruel, spoonfed to you by the masters of government.  But I deserve a better fate.  One I shape myself ... partially by writing Randian fanfiction."  
  
Well, maybe, that would work.  Self-deprecation is the great salve. 
  
Finally, have a frickin' point.  Argue in favor of something.  Point to a better way you actually believe in.  
  
Fear of sincerity's a big killer and certainly one I struggle with.  But, as the man says, you gotta put your deal out there in order to feel the wind.
  
Oh yeah.  The &lt;/rant&gt; joke ... not funny!

While walking downstairs to claim mine, I caught a whiff of microwave popcorn being popped.
  
And that's when it hit me.
  
Popcorn-flavored bagel schmear.  
  
Clearly, I could've kept this idea to myself and made millions.  But I'm giving back to the Net that's given me so much.

      John Ashcroft is being  urlLink sued  over the mishandling of a major terrorism case in Detroit.  The lawsuit alleges that the Justice Dept. "continuously placed perception over reality to the serious detriment of the war on terror."  Specifically, the plaintiff claims that a confidential informant was compromised and that results of the war on terrorism were exaggerated as a result of interference from Washington.
  
Which, you know, hardly seems like news really.
  
Except that the plaintiff is the former federal prosecutor in the case.
  
The prosecutor, Assistant U.S. Attorney Richard Convertino, has filed suit after being made the target of an internal investigation following his testimony to Congress.  Turns out the Justice Dept. doesn't it like it when you criticize the War on Terror to the U.S. Senate.
  
In fairness, there's no reason the Senate should know how the folks in charge of prosecuting the War feel about the job they're doing.
  
I'm sure it's going just fine.

      The Yanks are getting A-Rod and (as  Jeter will still be at short) I'm tickled pink.  It's worth noting to all the "Yankees buy their championships" haters that:  Well, this is just demonstrably true, isn't it?  The Red Sox tried to do the exact same thing but couldn't get it done.  So thhbbtt.  
The NYT has a great  urlLink account  of the financials behind the deal which are pretty fascinating.  One tidbit: The Yankees also got Rodriguez to defer an additional $1 million a year for each of the first four years with no interest. They offset that reduction in value by giving Rodriguez a hotel suite on the road (an old players' perk) and allowing him to link his Web site to the Yankees' Web site (a new perk). I like the fact the being in someone's blogroll has become a part of business negotiations.

      Anna  urlLink points out  that Timothy McVeigh and I have more in common than stylishly short hair cuts.
  
But you've got to ask yourself, who doesn't like the movies Red Dawn and Brazil.
  
McVeigh's love of Red Dawn is easy to understand.  You can picture Tim urging his militia brethen on with a full throated cry of "Wolverines!!"
  
What's really interesting is to see Brazil through McVeigh's eyes.  This is, afterall, a movie with hero-terrorists battling against a monolithic beauracracy that has stripped its citizens of their freedom.  They blow up fancy eateries, they make illegal heating repairs and are lead by a mustachioed and swaggering Bob DeNiro.  
  
Except that's not what the movie is about at all.
  
In fact, there's not much in Brazil that actually establishes a real terrorist network.  DeNiro's character is a freelance heating repair man.  No connection is made between him and the bombings.  In fact, those that try to make that connection are portrayed as fools.  For example, Michael Palin's character Jack DeLint who says, "There are no coincidences, Sam. Everything's connected, all along the line. Cause and effect. That's the beauty of it. Our job is to trace the connections and reveal them."
  
The plot of the whole movie turns on this erroneous chain of events.  Jill Layton is wrongly suspected of being a terrorist because she tries to help her neighbor who was wrongly suspected of being Tuttle who, himself, is not a terrorist at all.
  
The movie is not really about the righteous struggle against an oppressive society, a society so absurd in its machinations as to be inadvertantly malign as opposed to calculatingly so.  Instead it's about Sam Lowry's struggle to escape the complacency of his own life.
  
All I'm saying is, I wish Timothy McVeigh would have seen the Criterion box set.  There are some good supplemental inteviews which would have set him straight.

      Two truisms about bad publicity:   There's no such thing as bad publicity.   The Anti-Defamation League has consistently refused to learn this lesson, most recently with respect to Mel Gibson's Passion movie.
  
By way of recap, 9 months ago, Mel Gibson had a privately financed movie about an Italian Christ with no distribution, no dialogue in a language spoken by living people, and no subtitles.  Now, fueled by months of controversy (e.g. members of the ADL passing themselves off as members of a fictious church in order to see an advanced screening) the movie has enormous support from a wide cross-section of christian congregations, a predicted opening weekend of $25M, and, of course, subtitles.  
  
More than any other group or marketing strategy, the ADL has kept this movie in the news and made it a cause celebre for evangelicals.  Congrats!    The publicity's bad if it's not about you.   Why are the sponsors of the Super Bowl so pissed about the Boob.  Obviously, it can't be the case that Anheuser Busch is legitimately concerned that the recent boob viewage has forever damaged the moral health of America.  These are the people who had a whole campaign based around bikini models romancin' a dog in sunglasses.  
As the  urlLink Guardian  points out, the sponsors are pissed because no one was talking about how great the ads were after this year's Super Bowl.  The big to-do over the hoo-ha is not because American families were subjected to boobie; it's because boobie distracted them from the annual dose of mega-advertizing.  In this respect, the Boob is a threat to the most basic of American values: commercialism.

      Kazaa's headquarters down under got  urlLink raided  today after an Australian judge issued a "search and seize order".  
  
To begin with,  I had always heard that the Kazaa headquarters was like the Shadow's secret lair.  When you tried to find it, you ended up having your mind be-clouded and your plans be-fuddled.  Apparently not.
  
Second of all, it wasn't the Aussie police who conducted the raid.  Instead it was the "Music Industry Piracy Investigations, a branch of the Australian Recording Industry Association."  
  
So I'm to understand the the recording industry has its own stormtroopers?  Who are empowered to conduct court sanctioned search and seizures.  I mean this is Australia, where as far as I can tell, you have to murder someone to get a tank of gas.  But still!  
  
Are there other industry consortiums that have their own paramilitary wings?  The Mechanized Infantry of the Plumbing and Heating Industry Alliance, perhaps?  
  
"We gotta roll up to the vill' and investigate an illegal channel lock possession ... lock n' load!"
  
 Update : Apparently, "The raid was conducted under a rarely used law, known as Anton Pillar, which allows litigants in civil copyright cases to gather evidence."  Which is a messed up law with a goofy ass name.

      I recently played the arcade game Ninja Baseball Batman on the  urlLink MAME  machine we have here at work.  As a wacky synthesis of japanese and american culture, it knows no equal.  The powerups alternate between french fries and bbq eel donburri.
  
You are a robot baseball player out to save ... something.  You have your choice of heroes - the fat yellow robot with donuts on his bat, the skinny blue stickball robot with the longball swing, etc.  Your enemies consist primarily of anthropomorphic robot baseball equipment.  There are nasty yellow baseballs with metallic mohawks.  There are evil umpires who will throw their face guards at you.  I think the ultimate baddie might be a pitching rubber.
  
The game's primarily a side scroller in the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles style but the level design is a chaotic mindfuck.  One level starts off on the Golden Gate Bridge which collapses and drops you onto a passing cruise ship which takes you to the docks where you have to fight a 4x4 miniboss driven by baseballs.  And, as these  urlLink screenshots  show, the design philosophy seems to have been 'wild monkey colorgasm.'
  
In this respect, the game is a complete success.

      Boob.  Boob.  Boob.
  
The level of rhetoric around the Janet Jackson boobie incident is simply unbelievable.  FCC Chairman Michael Powell: "Like millions of Americans, my family and I gathered around the television for a celebration. Instead, that celebration was tainted by a classless, crass and deplorable stunt. Our nation's children, parents and citizens deserve better."
  
Good use of the Rule of Threes, here ... "classless, crass and deplorable" and "children, parents and citizens."
  
Speaking of celebrations, a 21 year-old who had swarmed the streets in Boston to celebrate the Patriots win was run over and killed by a guy in an SUV.  Who fled the scene.  And, of course, was determined to be drunk.
  
At this hour, it is not yet known how many people died as a result of seeing Ms. Jackson's boobie.

      Devil's Playground documents the Amish rite of passage known as  rumspringa  whereby 16 year-old Amish kids are allowed to experience the 'real world.'  You know, drink, drive ... roll over on crank dealers in order to avoid jailtime, etc. 
  
In explaining the philosophy behind  rumspringa , Faron Yoder (the main teen subject of the movie) explains that it's like a vaccination.  It's meant to give teens a taste of what they won't have so that they don't end up missing it. 
  
Faron ends up snorting a lot of vaccine.
  
The ostensible tension of  rumspringa  is that the kids have to make a choice at the end of it: continue to live in the real world or join up with Amish church.  However, it's basically a false choice.  The 'real world' the kids experience is a hyper-realized and completely closed teenage existence.  They only hang out with other Amish teens.  Most still live at home.
  
So while they're allowed to throw as many drunken Amish parties as they want (usually at their parents' farms), their understanding of what it means to be a teenager is completely involuted.  As in everyday teenage life, things trend towards homogeneity - it turns out that kids are good at picking up what's considered cool despite an austere upbringing.  Amish kids quickly go from being completely bewildered by Wal-Mart's CD section to healthy pop culture consumers thanks to the social queues of their peers (and, you know, MTV).
  
But because of the in-bred nature of their society (even before getting the same haircut, the kids look a lot alike if you know what I'm sayin') and the temporary nature of their furlough in the real world, any random behavioral mutation will quickly spread through the group.  To wit, the aforementioned crank. 
  
It's interesting that even when completely strung out on meth-amphetamines these kids never question their faith.  Heaven and hell are completely real and definite places.  It must be a really bad trip to be totally spun on meth and the only thought rattling through your head is  that you're bound for a literal hell much worse than the one in which you're trapped.
  
As if all of this weren't enough reason to see the flick, it's also got a great soundtrack.  Selected Ambient Works volumes 1  and  2.

      Boeing  urlLink announced  its plan to offer in-flight internet connectivity: The flat rate, which would give a user unlimited Internet access, will cost $29.95 for flights lasting longer than six hours. Each three- to six-hour leg will be charged at $19.95, while access on trips under three hours would cost $14.95. 
That's no free hotspot at the local coffee shop, to be sure, but I was expected something far more pricey.  I mean, doesn't it cost like $20 to make a 4 minute phone call in the air?  
  
One weird detail ... the initial plan is for wireless and they hope to offer Ethernet later on.  Seems a tremendous expense to go around laying wires to every seat for people who will only have laptops.

      A while back,  urlLink Gavin  at gavinsblog.com linked to and excerpted a post in which Dr. John "Men are Mars ..." Gray was alleged to be a fraud.  The claim is that he doesn't actually have a PhD.  
  
His lawyers caught wind and sent a nastygram - not to the person who originally posted the story, or the authors of the original outing in Men's News Daily - but to Gavin.  Which is pretty beat.
  
But also funny because in the letter, his lawyers attempt to establish his bona fides by pointing out that "Previously, Dr. Gray received his Master's degree from the Maharishi European Research University ... where he also obtained his Bachelor's degree."
  
I'm sure Maharishi U. is a totally legit university.  They've even got an  urlLink MBA  program which combines higher consciousness and professional excellence.

      At lunch today, we were talking about Disney's classic foray into sci-fi, The Black Hole.  Specifically, we were debating the super-creepy end to the movie wherein everybody ends up taking a tumble through ye olde singularity.
  
The results of this are mixed.  
  
On one hand, the do-gooders of the Palomino end up in the Land of Tubular Bells - a shiny place, full of shiny goodness and, like, gossamer-winged adventure.  
  
On the other hand, EvilBot Maximilian and scruffy scientist Hans Reinhardt end up ... somewhere else.  They're shown drifting towards one another in the hazy fog of the black hole.  As general relativity tells us, when a robot and a man are put in a black hole, they will embrace gently.  And then they'll be fused together into some sort of cyborg, standing watch for eternity over slaves toiling in a smoky hot pit.  
  
It's quite the metaphysical end to an otherwise subphysical movie.   urlLink Steve  pointed out that he'd turned to the Internet for help in understanding this symbolic stew and the  urlLink IMDB forums  provided the hook-up.
  
Obviously, the simplest answer is that the filmmakers decided they need some sort of "far out" ending like 2001.  But lacking imagination or actual talent, they tossed up a weirdly literal, pseudo-spiritual meditation on Heaven and Hell.
  
Alternatively, they may have decided to make the most out of the fact that Maximillian was also the first name of the actor playing Dr. Reinhardt.  "What if, like ... they were the same person!  But you know, in Hell!  Hey, man, puff, puff, give."

      Google's going public.  You may have heard.  Or not.
  
It's hard to say; to me, it seems like this is all anyone's been talking about anyway.  The pressfolk lurking outside our offices today seem to suggest a general interest.  But my perspective is probably a bit skewed.
  
I've never been more proud to work at Google than when I read the S-1.  Ever since seeing a Frontline about how auctions were the solution to IPO corruption, I had dreamed of the day when some responsible corporation could show Wall Street how it's done.  I never would have guessed that I'd be working for the company in question when it happened.
  
I also am glad about the dual class offering.  Larry Page points out all the remarkable things that make Google a unique place to work in his Founder's Letter.  Any system that allows him and the current management team to retain control is a good one in my book.  My god, the man specifically called out free lunches as an important part of employee culture! 
  
Finally, I love the fact that, as noticed on  urlLink /. , the actual sum to be raised by the IPO is $2,718,281,828 or  e  x 10^9.  Given that I was a debater, quizbolwer and officer of the math club, it's really something to be at a place where I don't even come close to the top of the dork-o-meter.

      Another Sunday, another pleasant afternoon working up a head of rage while reading about the state of the world in Harper's.
  
There's a nice piece about the various legislation that small communities have passed ordering their local police departments not to comply with Patriot Act investigations.
  
Which got me thinking about an idea for an educational campaign.  In the tradition (and, possibly, style) of the School House Rocks civics lesson, it would be called  America: Looks Good on Paper .  
  
Essentially, it's a way to let people know about their fundamental rights as guaranteed by the Constitution.  Whereas each phrase of the Constituion can be dissected with hundreds of years of case law, I believe the overall import is easily understood.
  
Episode One would start with the title card: "The 4th Amendment: Damn, That Seems Pretty Specific!"  And then it would be followed by the text of the amendment as read by some easily-snagged celebrity.  Maybe Leonard Nimoy.
  The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized.   Later episodes could be more fanciful, like, "Which Amendments are Better: Odds or Evens."  (Odds).  Or "Habeas Corpus: Suspend This!"

To wit, Sutter's got documentary  urlLink proof  that we saw Hellboy this weekend at SF's best theater, the Coronet.

      Woot to JetBlue for providing great service and free wifi here at JFK.
  
Last night I was at Princeton for Reunions.  When I mentioned to folks that I was planning on hitting up my reunion while out here, I invariably got the same response: "What?  Your college reunion?"
  
College reunions may be a rarer breed, but at P'ton it's a tradition.  Wrapped up in the graduating ceremonies for the current class is a multi-day, drunken extravaganza for all sons and daughters of Old Nassau.  It culminates in the P-rade - a march through the campus of all classes, lead by the superannuated Old Guard.
  
After some consideration, I've decided the whole thing is whack.
  
I'm all for the idea of running into old friends; certainly the best part of this trip has been spending time with so many folks from back in the day.  In particular, I got to see a good chunk, tho' sadly not all, of the debate folks with whom I spent nearly every weekend.  Partly as a result of spending so many weekends away from Princeton, I feel that going back to campus didn't resonate with me in the same way as it does for others.
  
But it's more than not having the same sentimental bond with the place because of time spent away.  I found myself recoiling at the parts of Princeton which I was able to ironically dimiss when I was an undergrad ... the spirit of self-congratulation; the exaltation of the place for its abstract qualities alone.
  
Yes - this is a Caufieldian argument.  And it's not as tho' 'phony' sums up all my feelings about Princeton; I loved it there and had the proverbial kickass time.  But, walking around campus last night, all I could see were the places where I'd nearly had a nervous breakdown broken up by packs of middle age white men slapping each other around in celebration of the grand trajectories of their lives.
  
I'm sure in another 5 years, I'll see it differently still.

By the way, the  urlLink Cristo deal  that's going to be going on in Central Park next year is going to be something to see.

      The SoHo Apple Store is housed in a former post office giving it the coolest exterior of those I've seen (tho' I'm still voting for the Michigan Ave. Apple Store in Chicago for best evah).  The wireless is also free ... I'm blogging this during a lecture on OS X which makes me feel like a bad student.

  
Yesterday, Steve and I drove down to Baltimore to catch the Yankees at Camden with Anna, Lauren and LEG.  During my debate days, I drove up and down I-95 oodles of times, en route to Hopkins, UMBC, Georgetown and so on.  Whenever we'd pass over into Maryland from Delaware, we'd see signs for the  urlLink Decoy Museum  in historic Havre de Grace.  Many, many jokes about it being a carved, wooden museum.  

  
Not so!  Steve and I stopped by, and tho' it was closed, we could easily see the many cases of 19th century duck decoys.  Seriously.  I'm not sure what's going on in historic Havre de Grace, but, man, they *hate* ducks.  There are poems on pedestals about tricking ducks into going after the decoys.  
 
 
 
The hunter's ploy has worked. 
For it was not real canvasbacks that lured the ducks, but well crafted decoys. 
 
 
 
When we reached Baltimore, we heard that there were tornado warnings in surrounding counties.  Giant, black thunderheads gathered over Camden and during the 2nd inning it began to pour.

  
I'd realized recently that I hadn't seen a serious thunderstorm in many years; I think there's been lightning once in SF in 4 years.  

  
After last night, I've seen it all.  
  

Saucer-sized raindrops forced our retreat to the top railing of the upper deck.  That's when horizon-wide forks of lightning erupted over downtown Baltimore and thunderclaps rocked the interior of the stadium.  Hearing thunder reverb off of the seats of a baseball stadium is quite the harrowing experience.
  
But not as freaky as noticing that the sky had turned green.  As every midwesterner knows, green sky = windy death.  I was seriously figuring how I could use the straps of my backback to lash myself to the handrails in case a tornado touched down on homeplate when we realized that the strange sky was due to the setting sun.  
  
The storm passed, the grounds crew drained the 3 feet of water from the visitors' dugout, and the sun set spectacularly as the Yanks went on to win behind a monster A-Rod homer.

      This evening  urlLink Steve  and I saw Jehane Noujaim's new documentary, Control Room.  Noujaim first flick was Startup.com, a big favorite of mine.  (I find myself quoting "But I wanna name it renderuntocaesar.com" a bit too often around the office.)
  
Control Room is signficantly better.  It documents the media coverage of the current war in Iraq from within Al Jeezera's headquarters and the US CentCom in Qatar.  It's an amazing illustration of one of Robert McNamara's points in Fog of War - the need to empathize with the enemy.  The US military repeatedly and continually refuses to understand why Arabs across the Middle East would react with horror to the death of civilians at US hands ... regardless of the brutality of Saddam.
  
That being said, there is an amazing scene in which a marine media officer reflects on how he felt at seeing images of the war's brutality.  And another when an Al Jeezera correspondant confidently declares that he believes completely in the US Constitution and the American people to take it upon themselves to stop what it happening to Iraq.
  
Damn.
  
In the spirit of proving him right, I think Rummy's on the way out.  There's no way he can survive Chalabi being turned out as an Iranian spy.  Steve and I were discussing who should be his replacement and we decided on McNamara.  Basically, he's on this redemption kick anyway ... might as well give him his shot at pulling us out of this generation's Vietnam, caused by another Texan president.

      My tour of famous, public WiFi hotspots continues ...  Today's stop:  urlLink Bryant Park .  
  
This is a swell fusion of old and new.  Bryant Park feels like an old world public commons - largely because it is.  On my left, the Great Lawn stretches out to New York Public Library.  On my right, 41st stretches out to Times Square.  And in the middle ... hot & free WiFi.  With tons of available tables upon which to perch your 'puter.
  
Good work Bryant Park.  Someone needs to do this for Dolores Park back home.

Incidently, things in the ole' debate world have taken a turn for the preposterous.  Which is saying something because it is collegiate debate afterall.  But while we may have been an astonishing group of obsessive dorks, no one ever created a  urlLink debate fantasy draft .
  
This is sort of like if you've got a group of dorkfriends with whom you play Dungeon & Dragons, and all of a sudden they start getting into LARPing.
  
Also I hear that there was a musical.

      I've been having this intermittent problem with my 15" PowerBook where it won't wake from sleep.  I've asked various  urlLink experts  but been completely unable to figure it out.
  
Today I was clicking through  urlLink Jason Sutter 's blogroll and went to read  urlLink Daring Fireball , which I check out infrequently.  Basically, there're a whole host of sites I check out every couple weeks - these are the links in blogrolls of the sites in my blogroll.  
  
Anyway, DF has a post about how he had this problem with his Mac and when he wrote it up, he wrote it not as a blog post for his blog readership, but for Google.  "Or, more specifically, for people using search engines to find an answer to the same problems I had."
  
That's savvy thinking and the sort of thing that makes working at Google so cool.  Folks understand how they can make the product better without even using the product.
  
But what's amazingly hot is that the  urlLink problem  he's describing is the freaking Mac-won't wake-up trouble I've been having for the last 3 months!  And now it's hypothetically fixed (altho' if having a custom date format is what threw off the energy management thus Rip Van Winkling my Mac, that's odd).
  
And, of course, I found it not because of Google, but because of blogs!
  
And thus I learned why we were acquired.

      So ... it's weird.  I've got, like, free time now.
  
Last Friday, my mom came in from St. Lu and graciously  urlLink sat around BloggerHQ  as we sanity checked the Blogger release candidate.  'Happy Mother's Day, Mom!  Wanna execute some test plans?'
  
 
A side story here.  My mom enters the bloggerarium and there's a bunch of dudes hanging around.  You know, the team.  I say, "Hey guys, this is my mom - Mom these are the guys.  Uh ... we also have some  urlLink ladies  but just not right here."  
  
 urlLink Chris Wetherdeal : "Yeah, it's a regular sausage factory up in here."
  
Nice!
 
Had a great weekend with Mom - nearly distracted from thinking about work obsessively ... but you know, not entirely.  Sunday happens.  Sunday is amazing!  And I've spent the whole of this week in some kind of bouillabaisse of stressed, joyful amazement.  
  
And now things are creeping back to normal.  It's no longer about the giant huge thing that's left to be done.  So I need to find a hobby or something.  I'm not sure if blogging counts.
   
Luckily, I'm going on vacation week after next.  A week in NYC with side trips to various points on the eastern seaboard.  I'm looking forward to catching up with old friends, both  urlLink lanky  and  urlLink ffoggy .  And just breaking away from the set of activities that, tho' immensely satisfying from a personal and professional perspective, have completely defined my life for the past little while.

      Donna Hughes'  urlLink take  on the Abu Ghraib tortures is a perfect example of why I keep coming back to the National Review Online.  
  
I thought to myself, "What spin can the NRO put on documented torture at the hands of US soldiers."  I was ready for a claim that torture is a justifiable wrong or even a blanket denial of the evidence.  But never could I anticipate the following stumble of logic:  The torture of Iraqi prisoners is horrible.  Hey, I once interviewed some European hookers who'd been abused.  That's also horrible.  Ergo, pornography is really what's to blame.  
Seriously, that's the point of this article. Here are four consecutive, unedited tidbits: The images from Abu Ghraib are trophy pictures. The sadistic MPs are shown posing, smiling, and gloating over their victims and what they have made them do. I'm with ya', sister.  Definitely bad stuff in those pictures. Similarly, I found numerous offers on the Internet from pimps for men to bring cameras and video recorders with them to make trophy images and videos of their sexual use of women and girls. Holy propositioning prepositions, Batman! But if the point is that there's weird sex stuff on the Internet, I'm with ya' there as well.  A little unsure of the connection between your points, but let's press on: Why are we shocked by these images from Abu Ghraib, but when the victims are women (or gay men) the images are called pornography or "adult entertainment"? Wha? So, first off, it's weird that straight men can't be in pornography ... or maybe they just can't be victims of it.  But second, she's gone and condemned all porn based on the site wherefrom pimps for men do tape of women having sex.  What a slut!  Here's the best one tho': What if the Iraqi men had been forced to smile, could we be convinced that there was a newly formed "publishing and film production" company in Baghdad instead of sexual abuse and humiliation being perpetrated? No! No we couldn't.  Never would it occur to us that what happened in Abu Ghraib was okay if someone tried to pass it off as porn.  That's like Pol Pot trying to pass off his skull collection as avant garde sculpture.
  
But, of course, the lesson of Abu Ghraib is all about porn. These similar images are what the young American soldiers from the Internet generation have grown up with and learned to call "adult entertainment." Did they become desensitized to the harm of doing such things to people by seeing multiple images of similar abuse to women? Did they learn how to violate someone by being a voyeur to abuse, and in Abu Ghraib they had the chance to become perpetrators — and pornographers? Obviously, yes. In the face of such compelling logic, how could you say otherwise.  Hustler taught these soldiers how to violate basic human rights and the Geneva Convention.  Cinemax gave them the hard heart needed to do what they did.  The fault, dear Brutus, lies not in our unjust foreign policy and destructive occupation of Iraq, but in our porn.
  
Also, I think Howard Stern may have been involved.

      Both American and British troops are accused of torturing Iraqi prisoners.  One difference between the two cases (besides, you, know, the uncontested photographic evidence of the Americans) is that Britain is now party to the International Criminal Court. 
  
As explained by the  urlLink Guardian , there is an increased burden on UK officials to get to the bottom of these allegations.  The ICC "has the power to launch war crimes charges of its own against authorities including the commander-in-chief - the Prime Minister - if necessary."
  
So, Tony Blair is legally compelled to make sure a proper investigation is carried out lest he be forced to answer to The Hague.  Nice!  
  
This 'rule of law' stuff is starting to make good sense.

       We hung about the tenderloin and tenderly you tell 
About the saddest book you ever read 
It always makes you cry 
The statue's crying too and will he may. Not my favorite Belle & Sebastian lyric, but it was fun to hear it sung at the Warfield last night when  urlLink CaseNotes  and I waded into what has to be the one the more polite and cheery rock n' rock audiences around.  
  
It reminded me a bit of a Sesame Street Live show - folks get very excited from the first chord of every song and actually cheer individual elements of the tune.  "Woot!  It's the trumpet bridge."  Good times.
  
Of course, as the evening grew later, there was a bit of desperation in the voices of those yelling out their favorite songs.  Not everyone's going to get to hear what they want.  In particular, the tracks off If You're Feeling Sinister were all but unrepresented ... but Get Me Away from Here, I'm Dying was a quality closer.
  
And I loved the impromptu cover of the I'll Be Your Mirror with Stevie Jackson singing the part of Nico.  This after the initial suggestion of a Morrissey cover was rejected with the reply, "Cover Morrissey?  I'd like to cover him with a rug."

      I saw two solid flicks this weekend.  And it's a close call but, I'm giving Dodgeball the nod over Fahrenheit 9/11.
  
Partly, it has to do with crowds. 9/11 was showing at cramped, underlit Metreon with a riled up hoard of liberals who were very agitated about proper line etiquette.  Also, seriously, thanks SF Lefties for taking the time to make neat anti-Bush fliers and dress up like a tranny Condi Rice, but you kinda get on my nerves after awhile.  Especially when you refuse to pass out your own pamphlets.  
  
"Take one and pass it down" does not a movement make.
  
Dodgeball on the other hand was at the spacious Coronet.  (Incidentally, I called 411 to find out the theater's number and they gave me the movie times!  Who knew.)  And while it is solely a broad physical comedy with a Ski School-inspired plot, man, is it funny.  
  
With respect to 9/11, I agree with Matt's  urlLink comments  about how there're some good Morrisean touches, especially the soundtrack.  However, I was a little bothered by the amount of time spent on Carlyle Group stuff and the now-revised Bin Laden Airlift business.  Also, there's no denying the relevance or power of the story of the mom who lost her son, but, gosh, he really left her up there to bleed for us.
  
It was only slightly harder to watch than the Senate footage of Al Gore certifying the 2000 election results.  That's got to be the single most agonizing professional experience of all time.

      I've heard lots of speculation as of late about what wacky tactic the GOP will whip out to turn the tide.  Not listed among those at  urlLink October Surprise  are the following:
 
 Instead of dropping balloons at the GOP convention, Osama bin Laden will be lowered from the rafters in a cage 
 The GOP will launch a "John Kerry blows goats" smear campaign (courtesy Dave) 
 Bush announces a new reality show: "Who Wants to be King of Iraq?" (Johnny B's vote) 
 Cheney is dropped from the ticket and is replaced by Colin Powell 
 
The last is pretty scary, don'cha think?

      Ralph Nader tried to  urlLink explain  to the Congressional Black Caucus what the hell he's doing in the presidential race ... and it didn't go so well.
  
Apparently, his explanation is that "he will help elect presumptive Democratic nominee John Kerry in November by splitting the conservative vote and siphoning support from President Bush."
  
In what world does that make sense? Which conservatives are gonna say, "You know I was gonna vote for Bush because I'm a pro-life supporter of the war in Iraq, but now that Nader's involved I just gotta make sure that whacko liberal doesn't get elected.  Count me in John Kerry!"

Impose their dark vision ... so that's like when the Emperor shoots Force Bolts at Luke in order to get him to submit to the Dark Side, right?
  
I have to say, this is a powerful phrase.  I think whoever wrote probably saw Lord of the Rings the night before.  You can just picture the forces of Good being beaten back by marauding hordes of barbaric beheaders.

      Moderation, I know ye not.
  
On Saturday, I took a double dip of Mission-style BBQ action.  Final poultry-fruit sausage count: 3.
  
But that was just the opener to yesterday's showcase of intemperance.  By way of background, I've recently been having a Netflix-based crisis of conscious in which I only rent really bad movies.  For example, Deep Impact followed up by Gods & Generals.  (The latter being Ted Turner's 4 hour paean to the muscular piety Stonewall Jackson.)
  
It's hard to say why I watch these movies.  Partly, I believe you can sometimes find a kernel of beauty in the dungheap of mediocrity.  Mostly, it's trainwreck curiosity.
  
Anyway, I went to see Chronicles of Riddick yesterday.  That's the epic, far-future sci-fi movie that's gonna end Judi Dench's career.  I had such low expectations, that I was quite pleasantly surprised.  
  
In the minus column you've got cringeworthy dialogue and downright goofy action editing.  But it is a legitimately good story with awesome production design.  Three Headed Staff of Evil = KickAss!  And Colm Feore's supervillian is Evil from Time Bandits with badass superpowers and a penchant for inlavafying planets.
  
Inspired by Riddick, I decided to go back-to-back and catch the Harry Potter flick as well.  Here's a case where the collective opinion is right on; it is the strongest of the three, partly because it is more 'mature' i.e. the kids are older and some of that stuff's downright scary.
  
And, like, the scenes with the hippogriff were pleasantly reminiscent of Spirited Away.
  
All-in-all a fun, supersized weekend.

      This month, Ronald Glasser writes the quintessential closing lines to a Harper's article:
  We have grown so foolish and so incompetent that perhaps we do not deserve to survive.  Perhaps it is simply time to die.  
In this case, doom is coming in the form of super charged diseases.  Diseases to which we are particularly susceptible because of a lack of a coherent public health policy.  
  
Incidentally, back in the heyday of high school debate,  urlLink Matt  was running a killer opp based on the rise of supertuberculosis due to health care mismanagement and the over-prescription of antibiotics.

      So, yeah, Ronald Reagan's dead.
  
In 1984, we had an elementary school mock election.  I knew that my mom was going to vote for Mondale, but that all my friends (and, it turns out, everyone else) were going to vote for Reagan.  I stood in the voting booth for 10 minutes and changed my vote 3 times before finally going with the herd.
  
I've been dreading Reagan's demise for awhile.  Now, it's only a matter of time until Mt. Rushmore and the $5 are remade in his likeness.
  
However, like Christmas, it seems that by living in San Francisco and avoiding TV you can escape almost any mass marketed phenomenon.
  
I did see some CNN today.  It was Anderson Cooper but without sound.  The banner graphic at the bottom read as follows: "Ronald Reagan Remembered - What to Remember."  
  
It's nice that TV wants to be so helpful.

      Previously, when I  urlLink wrote  about the documentary Control Room, I was particularly struck by Lt. Josh Rushing's struggle to make sense of the war and his role in it.
  
Rushing, now a Marine captain,  urlLink talked  to the Village Voice about the depiction of war:
 
 
"I think it should all be shown, the dead on both sides ... In America war isn't hell — we don't see blood, we don't see suffering. All we see is patriotism, and we support the troops. It's almost like war has some brand marketing here.
  
"Al Jazeera shows it all ... It turns your stomach, and you remember there's something wrong with war." 
  
Today, Salon is  urlLink reporting  that Rushing is leaving the military having been ordered to keep quiet.  His wife is quoted as saying:
  
"Everything that my husband represents in the military - the defense of freedom, and hopefully the expansion of freedom throughout the world - that's what a soldier is supposed to be, one would think. But it seems that he's denied some of those basic freedoms."
  
Genius.

      Despite it being a favorite of friends far and wide, I've never known anyone who saw Donnie Darko in the theater.
  
Turns out it  urlLink made  $500K when it was initially released in 2001.  On opening weekend it was only ever on 58 screens - by the fourth weekend only 6 theaters carried it. 
  
By way of contrast, I did see Congo in the theaters - a movie featuring laser-armed grey apes. It made $81M.  
  
I also saw The Next Karate Kid (starring Hilary Swank in the title role) on opening night no less.  It managed to make $9M domestically.
  
Fortunately, Donnie Darko's being given a  urlLink second shot  this summer.  Even if it's only in 50 theaters again, I'm betting that 5 will be in SF and that opening night will be completely sold out.

       urlLink   During my junior year of college, I once stayed up for 50 hours during which time I wrote my semester thesis, flew to Athens and physically collapsed during the welcoming ceremony at the World Debate Championships.  The upshot is I broke something in my brain such that I no longer have the ability to function without sleep.

 Last night I got about 2 hours before trekking to Logan and hopping the 6 hour flight back to SF.  Around an hour into the flight, I honestly thought I wasn't going to make it.  I'd already tried listening to the KLF's Chill Out but there was still 5 hours to go and my eyeballs were trying to claw their way out of my skull. 

 But then - a miracle.  JetBlue, the world's best airline, was testing out a movie channel supplement to their signature DirecTV service.  This meant I didn't have to try to occupy myself with 5 hours of Animal Planet as I did on the flight out - the highlight of which was a heartwarming tale of, seriously, a blind  and  deaf dog who befriends a three-legged cat (see above). 

 Instead, I had the Princess Bride (which is a special treat if you know  urlLink Biz Stone  and can imagine him doing all the parts as he's often wont to do) and The Sound of Music. 

 Man, The Sound of Music is good.  Best movie involving Nazis?  Possibly, if you discount Das Boot.  

 What made it especially compelling is that I quickly realized I'd never seen the theatrical cut.  The copy I watched growing up was taped off of TV and severely editted for length.  As a result, there's all kindsa stuff I'd not seen despite having watched the movie dozens of times (so much so that I have a clear memory of where each commercial break occurs in the 'movie'). 

 Anyway, Sound of Music is also good because it's 3 hours long ... it was already time to land and the Von Trapps hadn't even escaped to Switzerland. 

 Thanks JetBlue!

 Welp, that about wraps it up for the DNC.  My back is killing me from having sat for 6 hours waiting to see  a bunch of ballons  John Kerry. 
 But I thought the speech was solid.  Strategically sound if not inspirational - "health care is a right," "screw the Saudis," "we're taking back the money from the rich" ... these are all messages I can get behind.  I  urlLink talked about  it some with Noah and I assure you that when I said President Douche instead of President Bush, it was an honest slip.

       urlLink   Yesterday was a wacky, hectic day filled with Indiana Jones-themed parties (for the congressional  whips  don'cha know) followed by the traditional scramble for convention passes.  But it all turned out well when Shellen and I gained access to the delegate floor and got to experience the full force of Al Sharpton's amazing speech.  

 I talked about it with  urlLink Noah  on the  urlLink audblog  - I feel the Democrats had to address the recent Republican effort to court the Black Vote.  Sharpton nailed it with his "we decided we’d ride this donkey as far as we could take it" line and the Florida delgates with whom I was embedded went stark raving nuts. 

 And then we retired to the Blogger afterparty.  Blogs are big news here even if most people aren't sure why.  But it's always fun to get together with clever folks and talk technology ... I did some  urlLink audio rambling  with Noah on the state of the blogowhatnot. 

 This is definitely one of most heavily mediated environments I've ever seen.  Everywhere you look someone is covering something ... sometimes it's just the coverage itself.  The intermingling of politicos and celebrities feeds some kinda primal excitement - last night I saw a woman lunge outta nowhere just to rub James "That'll do, Pig" Cromwell's arm.  She just wanted to grab a little squeeze to take home with her. 

 I find it painfully weird to run up and try to capture a celebrity momemt, but I also don't want to be left out of what's clearly an essential part of the convention experience.  Therefore, I present my own series of awkward celebrity photographs:   urlLink Gov. Ann Richards    urlLink Rob Reiner    urlLink Al Franken    urlLink Natalie Merchant    urlLink John  Cougar  Mellencamp   
Eat your heart out, Anne Leibovitz.

       urlLink   The big thing I've learned on day 1 of the  urlLink DNC  is that political conventions, like politics, is all about access.  As I  urlLink talked about  with Noah, we started out the evening as uncredentialed outcasts - stuck on the wrong side of the riot-proof fencing, deafened by over-amped protesters and under-muffled diesel generators.  By the end of the evening, we had traded up our color-coded badges several times and were able to peer down on the convention floor from a lofty skybox inside the Fleet Center.   It's like a baseball game where you try to sneak into better and better seats as the game goes on.  The whole process is a little strange because it relies on exploiting connections and a good deal of guile.  (Neither of which are paradigms I'm particularly comfortable with).    But both led to us jumping a partition into an adjoining skybox which happened to contain Michael Moore.  There was a weird celebrity awkwardness as folks were struggling with their digicams to snap souvenir photos.    But we ended up having a real conversation about blogs, Google and the terrible state of copyright.  Michael Moore is a clueful dude.  And hungry ... which I can appreciate.  The one completely genuine moment of the evening was Barack Obama's  urlLink speech .  The man gave me chills.  In terms of what public service should mean, Obama nailed it when he said "If there's a senior citizen somewhere who can't pay for their prescription and having to choose between medicine and the rent, that makes my life poorer, even if it's not my grandparent."  That the poverty of others can make all of our lives poorer goes right to heart of the problems government is meant to address.  (For what it's worth, the least genuine moment of the day was dancing to Come on Eileen at a convention after party.  Apparently, I'm going to be awkwardly dancing to that song for the rest of my life.)

       	 		 		 The Flacksmiths recently got new bicycles, so we set out this morning on a  urlLink Grand Bike Adventure .  The initial plan was just to cruise to the Embarcadero but before we knew it we were in Sausalito.   The weather was perfect and along the way we took in many great sights ... including an elderly gentleman with a head full of white plaster.    We got to cross the Golden Gate Bridge (a hoot!) and stuff ourselves full of fish parts over in Marin.  I also highly recommend the ferry ride back.  Ferries  always make me feel like re-enacting the opening scene to Working Girl.     Or that one Madonna video.  Regardless a good time was had by all. 		 		 		 			 urlLink     			 				 			 urlLink Golden Gate Bridge (detail) 			 			Originally uploaded by 			 urlLink goldtoe .

      During August 1997, before my junior year of college, I watched the filmed version of Jesus Christ Superstar approximately 7 times in row in less than 2 days.  After some viewings, I would cry.

 It was a confusing time and, frankly, my weepiness was much more a pharmacological by-product than a spiritual awakening. 

 Needless to say, I approached the new direct-to-video version of JCS with some trepidation.  Filmed in 2000, the goal of the producers was to update the look so as to reach a wider audience.  So it's out with bell bottoms and in with the Gap. 


 As a result, when we first see Jesus, he's wearing a ribbed wifebeater and cargo pants.  The apostles are portrayed as some kinda metrosexual paramilitary group outfitted with blue camo muscle tees and automatic weapons. 


 Which brings up a confusing part of the whole production ... who exactly are we rooting for here?  The apostles force Jesus to go pop, his followers quickly become an unruly mob, even the lepers are shown as being annoying ... well, maybe that's not a stretch. 


 Pilate, as is the modern style, comes off amazingly well.  Sure he's wearing Goering's hand-me-downs, but that's just 'cause he's Roman.  Pilate hearts Jesus. 
  

 In fact, one of the movie's more interesting touches is the scourging.  In the film, folks from the mob come running up and slap their hands on JC's body as Pilate counts out the lashes.  Their hands are dripping with red paint so the streaks they leave on Christ's torso represents the whipping.  At the end of the scene, we zoom in on the ghoulish jewmob (they're wearing goth eye makeup) as they reach out with their blood stained hands. 


 Them's my peoples!

      Recently, I had to send the following message to the good people at Netflix:  
 
  Hello -  



  I am an idiot.  



  I accidentally sent back a non-Netflix dvd in the return mailer.  The  
 movie I was trying to return was Derrida.  Instead, I sent you back my friend's copy of the second disc of the Two Towers.   



  I know.  



  I just dropped it in the mail this morning (7/10) so you wouldn't have received it yet. But I'm wondering if there's anyway you can send it back to me once you get it. (At my expense, obviously).  



  Thanks for you help.  I love Netflix and have always found it very easy to use.  



  Which is important, considering the fact that I am quite stupid.  
  
And, what do you know, less than a week later Eugene's copy of the Two Towers was returned!  



 Right after I sent this message I also ordered a replacement copy from Amazon just in case. I briefly toyed with the idea of not telling Eugene and just replacing the missing disk with the new copy in a covert-Blue-Heaven-this-is-the-same-turtle-you've-always-had style. 



 In the end, I confessed and now have my own copy of the Two Towers to accidently send back to Netflix! Incompetent honesty truly is the best policy.

      I don't miss owning a car, but I have noticed that my view of San Francisco has shrunk to a very small strip that extends from the Mission to Lower Haight. I've gone on some bus-bound adventures as of late, but inertia pretty much keeps me in the neighborhood and at the same restaurants I've been eating for nearly 4 years.
 
  Don't get me wrong - I love the hood. But I need a little expansion. (Partly I feel this is due to my obsessive playing of the new Spiderman 2 game. Long since having won the game, I continue to swing around Manhattan just because it's so frickin' cool to be able to go  anywhere .  How sweet to swing from the Chrysler building and leap into Times Square ... and do it all in high pixelated-style). 
 
  Anyway, as I cannot (yet) be Spiderman, I bought a bike. I don't know much about bikes but mine's red and silver and let's you sit upright instead of hunched over and has a giant squishy seat. And it rocks! On my maiden trek I made it all the way to the ocean and saw parts of Golden Gate Park I never knew about (including the SFPD horse stables). 
 
  As soon as my legs recover I fully intend to cruise the Embarcadero ... I hear there aren't any hills.

       As discussed  elsewhere , we've released&nbsp;a wizz-uh-muh-wig editor for Blogger. &nbsp; 


 It's got features and such and will be a boon for text manipulators everywhere.&nbsp; I'm a particular fan of the new glyphs that Chris came up with for the toolbar.&nbsp; I feel like quoting stuff all the time now.

      NPR's got a good  urlLink audio clip  on the Senate's 500 page 'Fuck You!' to the CIA.  I'm fond of this quote by Sen. Jay Rockefeller:   "Our credibility is dimished, our standing in the world has never been lower, we have fostered a deep hatred of Americans in the Muslim world and that will grow.  As a direct consequence our nation is more vulnerable today than ever before." 
 So, it was a good thing, right?

      Once upon a time, Charles and Marie Robertson gave $35M to Princeton in order to establish a public policy school.  The result, the Woodrow Wilson School, is housed in a neo-neo-classical temple and home to the most over-achieving of what's already a massively type-A student body.
  
Perhaps unsurprisingly, in recent years the would-be wonks are pretty much not becoming the nation's next generation of career diplomats.  So the Roberston kids want their  urlLink money back  as the school is "instead turning out journalists, bankers and -- most appalling of all -- a professional oboist."
  
Yeah, fuck oboists.  The kids should definitely get a refund ... with interest it comes to $600M.  D'you think they'll take store credit at the bookstore?
  
I have a hard time picking a winner here.  On one hand, $600M lawsuits should probably involve some kind of mutagenic orange juice sold to orphan children.  On the other hand, the Wilson school is primarily used as an elite credential for undergrads seeking to maximize their future remuneration.  
  
Princeton should be forced to put all the money into fusion research.  Success will lead to oil independence thus negating much of the diplomatic cost incurred in having to do business in the Middle East.  
  
While not a funding of diplomacy per se, there will be more diplomatic resources left over as a result.  Which will allow us to invest in international affairs where we might have a snowball's chance in Saudi Arabia at having a positive impact.

      I first read Tom Stoppard's Arcadia in the winter of 1999 when I was busily dropping out of grad school.  It turned out that studying astronomy as a techincal discipline wasn't the bucket of fun I'd been hoping for.  The wow factor I felt in doing astro as an undergrad was replaced by dread at having to slog through another problem set session.  
  
Arcadia covers a lot of thematic ground; one of the main ideas is the tension between rationalism and romanticism.  Throughout most of the play, characters lash themselves to one or the other of these two poles and teeter about as a result.  The teetering's pretty damn funny.  (In reading the play, I've always been amazed at how much mileage he can get out of stuff like 'the conversation at cross purposes.')   
  
Last Tuesday, Sutter, danah and I saw Tom Stoppard's Arcadia at the Mountain View Center for the Performing Deals.  It's quite something to see it performed after having read it so many times.  For one thing, the sucker is dense.  Reading 10 minutes of dialog on iterative functions is one thing - to see it pulled off is something else.
  
Also, the play takes place in a single room in an English estate, but in two separate time periods (early 1800s and present day).  In the last few scenes, the action from both time periods overlap, with both sets of actors performing at the same time.  To make the staging of such a thing seem important rather than gimmicky is quite a feat.
  
Technical stuff aside, Arcadia's always hit home for me and that was strongly reinforced seeing it live.

      Steve and I, having been  urlLink prevented  from seeing baseball at PacBell due to the insidious trickery of the US Naval Observatory, reveled in good-seat glory last night in Oakland.

 One of the great pleasures of baseball is that its slow pace gives you time to contemplate the mysteries of life with good friends. For example, what would your intro music be if you were a major league closer? My list: 
     "Isolation" by Joy Division     "Closer" by Nine Inch Nails (probably only in New York)     "The Centaur" by Buck 65     "It's the End of the World as We Know It" by REM     "Personal Jesus" by Depeche Mode     "Personal Jesus" takes it for me by a wide stretch because of the salvation themes.  But it's clear that there can be no  urlLink worse choice  than "Dancing Queen" ... maybe the PSB version of "Go West."

      As widely  urlLink reported :  "Kerry said he would have cast the same Yes vote in Congress that he did on Oct. 11, 2002, to authorize the president to launch a pre-emptive war that began March 19, 2003, even if Kerry had known that Saddam Hussein had no ties with Al Qaeda terrorists, no weapons of mass destruction and posed no real threat to the world." 
How is this anything less than Kerry slitting his own throat?  Besides just being wrong in principle, it makes no sense politically.  If Kerry can't distinguish his stance on Iraq from that of Bush, he's nowhere.  
 
Bah.

      Today, Alan Keyes  urlLink said  the following ridiculous thing about abortion:
 "I would still be picking cotton if the country's moral principles had not been shaped by the Declaration of Independence," Keyes said. He said Obama "has broken and rejected those principles he has taken the slaveholder's position." 
 
Obviously, the point was to have the quote picked up.  He's said something similarly preposterous in a number of other  urlLink interviews  - for example, arguing that Barack Obama (by supporting gay marriage) has turned his back on everything decent in the world and that Keyes, like Lincoln, must defend our fundemental principles of Union.
  
Will Barack Obama, the greatest thing to happen to Democratic politics in a generation, be sidetracked like so many others by the social issue sideshow?   
 
Fuck no. 
 
"As I travel around this state, I don't get asked about gay marriage, I don't get asked about abortion.  I get asked, 'How can I find a job that allows me to support my family.' I get asked, 'How can I pay those medical bills without going into bankruptcy.'"
 
Alan Keyes, Barack Obama is a righteous political whirlwind.  You are but the cracked out trailer park in his path.

 But seeing it did make me check out what Mamet's up to next ... apparently he's working on a Will Farrell vehichle called Joan of Bark: The Dog that Saved France.

       urlLink   Sick of being bald?  To cheap to buy a real hairpiece?  Help has arrived!

 Now you can own a homemade toupee in just 5 easy steps: 

 1. Find a friend with a thick head of hair.  The thicker, the better.  Take  urlLink Eugene , for example.  His hair is so thick he gets it cut every couple weeks ... with garden shears! (buh-dum-bum). 

 2. Next, go over to said hirsute friend's house when he's getting a trim.  Try not to salivate as you watch all that luscious hair pile up on the floor (the spit would make the hair clumpy). 

 3. After the haircut is over, get a couple strips of wide, transparent tape.  Packing tape is perfect.  Duct tape, not so much. 

 4. Dredge the the strips of tape through the piled hair clippings. 

 5. You should now have a couple chia-esque strips of tape.  Plop those suckers on your noggin and you can hold your  urlLink head up  high from now on!
