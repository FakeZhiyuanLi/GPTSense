      So I havn't posted in a few days, mainley because I am very lazy. Nothing new has really happened to me. Yesterday was a bit interesting, I was in science class and had just finished taking chemistry notes and my science teacher said that the class should take a break. She lead us down into the biology lab and showed us a cow heart and lungs. I know!. One second we are discusing conversion factors and the next thing we know we are looking at a cow heart adn lungs! It was quite gross, but at the same time interesting. People poked them......ewww. I guess that now if I am trying to think of small talk with someone I have an interesting subject.  "so how are you today" "I saw a cow heart" "well thats..." "And I saw its lungs too" Lets hope it never comes to that. I guess that is all I can mention today, I am tired. I suppose that I could do some homework.......nevermind. Well I am off now Cheerio

      It is 2:36 and i am in Conservation class, need I say more. We are in the computer lab and our teacher has given us the remaining part of class to "surf" the net. I then decided that I would start a "blog". This is almost all new to me, I had one before and I think that I made one post... then I forgot my username and password so that was the end of that one. I think that I will take better care of this one..unless i get bored of it, or run out of things to talk about. I do attend the Rural so I dont think that that will happen, there is always stupid people doing stupid things. It is now 2:40. As I look around I see many different a people, to my left Lindsay Mcinnis, to my right Amy somethingorother. Nick Constable and Matt Smith are behing me, and as for the rest of them im surounded. I have thought this through and Conservation class is pretty useless. I dont plan on getting stranded in the Canadian outback and living off of moose and making shelters out of snow. I also don't think that I will ever be in a situation where knowing what type of leaf i am looking at will save my life. I will not complain about everything though, it is a very, very easy class. It is now 2:43. I suppose that I have said enough for today.... I guess that I can "surf" the web now. Cheerio

      I would like to make a correction to something that was brought to my attention about my last post by a Mister Patrick. That tuesday I went to the comic store and bought some comics. I am a loser... but I do not care. Hmmmmm so now what shall I discuss.....world peace,naaa......hmmmmmm what else is there... Nothing to important happened at school today, tomorrow I am going outside canoeing with my conservation class, in the so called "pond" outside,do I remember how to swim.... needless to say there shall be an update on how that goes. The weather lately has been really sucky, I don't think that I can stand any more rain, or cold weather, it should be warm and sunny but it is not. I wish that I could do some crazy voodoo and make the weather change but I can't,I must put that on a things to learn list...or not. Like most other days I am tired today. At the moment I am listening to some tunes, you know a little bit of this a litle but of that. Today is Thursday and tomorrow is Friday, I work tomorrow but after work I am going to go see the new Harry Potter movie. Saturday I am not quite sure yet what I am up to I think that I may be going to town, I will have to see what is going on. Now I am listening to Death Cab For Cutie, I like them. I suppose I could something useful with my time this evening but most likely I will not. Looking into the future I see myself in front of and computer or t.v scree, and I complain that I am in bad shape..haha. I don't like "laughing" on the internet. "LOL" is a saying that is overused. I often find myself using it more then I should but what else is there, "haha" and "hehe" sound kind of weird in my mind, maybe that is just me....but I still use them. Well I smell food and I think I shall follow the wise words of Mr.Tucan Sam and "Follow My Nose"  c-ya

      Yes the title speaks the truth, I am again in conservation. We are in the computer lab again. Class will be starting soon and to no suprise I believe that we are doing some research questions on a tree of some sort, or possibly a racoon...who knows. Wait I just herd that our research is on forest fires, woo woo, hint the sarcasm. Last night I went to an artsy thing here at the school. People sang and danced, they did artsy things. I believe that it was called an arts fair. I am very tired. There is 9 days of school left until exams (school is almost over:good, exams start soon: bad) There I just finished the assigement and I can now say that I can build a solar oven, and cook and nacho salad in it, yippee. If we ever lose the power due to the heat I can now make food using other means then an oven. I will take this information with me forever. So today is tuesday. Tomorrow is Wendsday. And if I am correct then the day after wendsday will be thursday. Oh the things I have learned so far in High School. Class will be ending in 8 minutes, then I will be able to go home. Quite often my bus driver is a crazy driver. I always feel so safe going across the bridge at high speeds.That does not happen often. 6 minutes left of class. Well I guess that I have rambled on enough, there is nothing for me to carry on about. I shall depart now. Good bye

      well, I must say that I waited a little longer then usual to write another post, about a month and a half long. Awel. I suppose I could update what happened when I went conoeing with my conservation class. Hmmmm let me think back.........aw yes here it is. I didnt fall in that is a key point. One conoe did though and I found that to be most amusing, what is funnier then watching 3 teenage dudes flailing around in cold water, no to mcuh i can tell you that. They all survived, but their egos took a hit. Or maybe not I have no idea. It is now almost midway through July, my summer thinking has kicked in so i am not quite sure what the date is, I do know that it is a monday.... So far I havnt done too too much, I am not complaining though. I went to some bonfires at the beach, they were fun, and I went to the beach and swam, well i got in the waterm that counts as swimming..., that was very fun aswel. I was visiting family on the weekend in Rexton, that is in NB, some people don't know that. We went to their mall and got all tuckered out because we went to all the stores, I shall list them, Co-op, subway, and the co op clothing store. There was a sale there, I didn't buy anything. I saw my family, that was fun, I don't see them too often. I believe that I am going over there again in like 2 weeks for another get together. It will be a beach party. Woo, Woo Parrrrtayyyyy. There will be no cops breaking up this party, for I am not even sure if there is cops in Rexton... and it's a lobster supper, I dont think that they would break up that...unless.. the lobster were smuggled illegally, wait I am getting a little off track here, stupid summer thinking. Hmmm what else is new, I got my hair cut, buzzed it right off, whats better then feeling the wind roll of your scalp aswel as the rain, answer me that. Wait i got a little of course there too, my hair is not buzzed off it is like shoulder length. Real interesting huh. Tomorrow I have guitar lessons. I work on Saturday. I saw Anchorman on the weekend, i found it to be very funny indeed, a stupid kind of funny. But then again what movies today arn't. What ever happened to the timeless classics like The Lion King, and The Little Mermaid, no we have Japonese carttons that are seizure inducing, "mommy look at the pretty little, ahhhh my brain......" Well I suppose that I have done enough talking to last another month... just kidding, or am I... Cheerio
