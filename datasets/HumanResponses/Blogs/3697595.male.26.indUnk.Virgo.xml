      Bad pun, strong sentiment.    I'm not much for activism, but I'm a huge fan of inspirational thought.  I'm a thinker more than I'm a talker, and I'm a talker much more than I'm an doer.  I've voted once in my entire life, and I'm proud of my vote.  I knew more about that particular election than most people did.  It was a Presidential primary.  I left the city of New Orleans during the Mardi Gras festivities in order to return to my then home state and vote for a person who I already knew would not win the nomination since Super Tuesday had taken place on Mardi Gras itself.  It was important.  It meant something.  I truly believed in my choice.    I choose that story as an example of inspiration because (a) I had never voted before, nor have I voted since for that matter, and (b) it's true inspiration simply because I left something I was very inclined to do to do something I was not at all inclined to do.  That's what I think true inspiration is...something that bridges the gap between occasional thought and determined action.  This is a tribute to inspiration, in whatever form it may take in your life.   If I thought therefore I was,       then what was it I thought?   I think the thinker thinks along       the actions he does not.  Your tendencies are what you do      when true to inclination To make the thinker start to do      requires inspiration.  When thinking's simply not enough      to satiate....and more And the voice inside that drives      seems to be much more than yours  The time has come to act       in whichever way you ought Because just being human is not being      without the step beyond just thought.

      My first post....ahhh....take me away.  This is really nothing more than a place for me to ramble.  Should anyone ever stumble upon it to read it, I beg your mercy.  Should anyone care to return to read again, I beg your tolerance.  Should anyone care to post something themselves, more power to you.    Along that note, I cannot imagine the circumstance that would lead anyone to come here in the first place; but I am forced to realize the cirumstances that compel me to create it.  This is my new haven...my silhouette of independent thought and expression...my release...my avenue of tossing ideas, thoughts, and feelings out into the world in their relative undoneness.  God bless any and all that come here.  For my first post, it seems only fitting to pay a little bit of tribute to a constant source of inspiration to me.  For those of you who may have wondered where the title of this blog originated, it's from a line in an Ani DiFranco poem.  For those of you unfamiliar with her or her vast contribution to this world, I encourage you to read one of the many sites dedicated to her as well as support her and any other Righteous Babe recording artist.  But enough of that particular soap box.  Below is a rant of thought composed while listening to Ani and thinking about...well, the conflict that exists in me between that part of me which seeks only myself and that part of me which seems to have some sort of moral compass.  I also feel compelled to say that I'm a guy, but everything else in the song felt somehow applicable at the time.  The song is "Joyful Girl" by the way.  Here goes nothing.    I do it for the joy it brings I do it cause I’m a joyful girl ‘Cause the world owes me nothing We owe each other the world   I’m evil.  I’m evil because I find the good in everything.  I’m evil because of indulgence.  I’m evil because I give in.  Conflict descends upon me like a plague resulting only in me tearing up myself.  Even when I win I lose.     I do it ‘cause it’s the least I can do I do it because I learned it from you I do it just because I want to Because I want to   The good in me no longer outweighs the bad.  The volume of good seems to be overcome by the density of the bad to the point of sheer reckoning.     Everything I do is judged I mostly get it wrong, oh well.   How can the me that is me continually coexist, as those that are separate but equal seem to exist only to perpetuate themselves and eliminate the other?  It is the perpetuation of elimination that overwhelms me.  And when one’s natural reaction to stress is to ignore its very existence, it becomes elimination that is perpetuated.  And the cycle begins anew.   The bathroom mirror has not budged The woman who lives there can tell   With blissful ignorance but an oasis of thought, self-limiting stupidity becomes a substitute catharsis.  The only problem is I’m not stupid.   The truth from the stuff that they say She looks me in the eye You prefer the easy way Oh well ok then, don’t cry   I’d like to think that it’s as easy as a problem of circumstance, but the circumstance simply reveals the desires.  It’s not even about a desire over a principle as the desire itself is principal.  The four-square game within moves consistently onward resulting only in the undeniable truth...that which is last cannot go back any further….a fate to which all else is possibly subject….regardless of current position.  But I digress.   Whooooooooaaaaaa. Hey-Ah.  Hey-Aaaaaaah. Whooooooooaaaaaa. Hey-Ah.  Hey-Aaaaaaah. Heeeeeeeey-Aaaaaaaaah. Hey-Ah.  Hey-Aaaaaaah. Heeeey-Aaah.   Or is it regress?  Or repress?  Or recess for that matter.  As that seems to be the only constant.  Recession.     I wonder if everything I do I do instead Of something I want to do more The question fills my head.   But as much as I seem to know about that which torments me…knowing the question doesn’t mean I know the answer or even understand the question.  Because the fundamental question is not what.  It’s why.  And I can’t even answer the what.  What is it that I really want?  Why does it seem to change?  All the time at once?  And it changes to that which excludes that with which it is unnaturally mutually tied?  At least Douglas Adams knew the answer.  I can’t even settle in on the question.  But I do have a pretty good idea.  Or is it a bad one?  Do I really want what I do?  Would I even be doing this if that was the case?  But when is it that I’m not really happy with what I’m doing?  After?  Before?  Very rarely during.  Although that happens to everyone.  Me less than most though.  Perhaps therein lies the problem.  Obviously, I don’t really know.   I know there’s no grand plan here This is just the way it goes When everything else seems unclear I guess at least I know  I do it for the joy it brings ‘Cause I’m a joyful girl Because the world owes me nothing. We owe each other the world.   Joy is not evil though.  Nor will it ever be so.  Perhaps therein lies the answer.  Joy.  The pursuit of happiness is full of both liberty and justice for those that choose it as is afforded under the constitution of our very being.  The pursuit of joy, however, is freeing and just in and of itself.  The very world that serves up happiness in the moment provides joy in all tenses if the joy is sought in a manner which is true.  Satan is the thief of joy.  And God seeks not simply happiness for those He created.  But what do I know about all that anyway.  For in being owed nothing, one finds that you deserve nothing.  And nothing becomes that which you expect.  Nothing.     I do it ‘cause it’s the least I can do I do it because I learned it from you I do it just because I want to Because I want to   Nevermind.     (That's it, and that's all....for now.)

      The dawning of a new America  is spoken of by many  promised by few  and realized by seemingly only those whose job it is to figure the statistics   the 2.1 million here  the 150,000 there  the top 1% of 200,000 with 5,000 each that was set aside and returned and recouped and renegged and....relived....  every four years....   or less  if you pay attention  to the diversely representative upper middle class minority that is the media today  or at least the face of the media today   because seeing is believing and a picture is worth a thousand words  and you can make a difference and in order to form a more perfect union  you need to vote....  especially if you're in Florida, or Ohio, or Missouri, or New Mexico   or if you help make up the sea of domestic tranquility that is Medicare and MTV  or if you support the troops and hate the war  or if you support the war and hate the enemy  or if you support the notion that hate is the enemy  or if you think it's more than just terror that's domestic  for the first time   Franklin looked and saw a rising sun on the back of a stationary chair  at the dawning of our country  the dawning of a new America  I wonder if that was before or after he invented bifocals.  And I wonder what he would say now   as people would bludgeon him with questions  about his faith or lack thereof  and his love for the French  and how could you dare say that BEER is proof that God loves us and wants us to be happy?  besides we all know Thomas Edison invented electricity anyway   we learned all about it in our reformed schools  with waivers, or not  and new computers  and without the children who were left behind  and with the children that weren't  from our state-funded, federally-managed, government-tested somehow logically-defying internationally inferior school system   but is that really what's important?  I know the kids can pick out a picture of Bin Laden.  that's what really matters  next to money of&nbsp;course,  Just ask the teachers.   The dawning of a new America is again upon us  thank God we treasure our wisdom now  and we respect our elders  and we follow our minds, we follow our hearts,  and we balance both with the utmost discretion   Right?   May the sunset be brief this time.  Come dawning, come.

        &nbsp; I think the less I say about this one the better.&nbsp; Here's to the realization that sometimes life can be a little too real, and you may not even know it when it happens. &nbsp; &nbsp; I now know what it's like to see your dreams laid out in front of you  residing in the lives of others &nbsp; I now know what it's like to see what you've wanted even when you didn't know yourself exemplified by those around you &nbsp; I now know what it's like to feel cheated by yourself as others have overcome themselves &nbsp; I now know what it's like to regret when I never have before &nbsp; Knowing sucks &nbsp; At least for now

      Snoop fans unite.  Imitation IS the highest form of flattery, you know.    While my rendition of LBC's finest might not ring true in your heart, this next "collaborative" effort often rings true in mine.  This is actually a recreation of a poem that one of my best friends wrote waaaay back in the day.  The first few lines and the last line are his, but the rest is continually adapted to whatever mood and situation I find myself in that prompts me to remember the point of the entire endeavor.  This is the latest adaptation.  I apologize in advance for the cheese factor, offering only in my defense the statement that sometimes there's power in cheese.  Just ask Wisconsin.   I have a friend named Harry  who stands facing the wall. Harry sees what Harry sees, and Harry sees it all.  Harry sees but doesn't see his eyes faced right ahead Harry hears what Harry sees his ears, his eyes, instead.  Harry knows what Harry knows; it's us that tell him so. Harry's back is to the world in front...nowhere to go.  So Harry is not blind to each of our attacks... the slings and arrows that we hurl at him behind his back.  And Harry knows our hate is not  confined to simply him. Harry sees us talking;  he knows who did what and when.  Harry sees the image of ourselves that we betray Since how we act does not always match up with what we say.  Harry knows our hearts,  and where they truly lie Harry sees us as the very selves we can't defy.  Harry sees the overflow of truth contained in speech. Harry knows JUST what we say at times, the worst, in each.  Harry sees our whispered words can bring both joy and pain And Harry knows that there are times at which we will refrain  And Harry knows that other times we let loose our mind and tongue Our senses do not tell us though exactly who we're among.  Harry sees us both in our best and worst of times. Harry even hears our silly poems  filled up with rhymes.  So what would Harry tell us  were he to turn around? Would he let us have it for the hate that we impound?  While I can't be exactly certain as I have not come out and asked I think Harry would tell us that the feelings that we mask  Perhaps should simply stay within should they even exist at all For any thought expressed aloud  is heard by at least the wall  And Harry, as you might have guessed has the patience of a saint Compassion is his to spare and share  with those victims of complaint  Which Harry tells me is much more  than just the others we discuss Harry tells me that the subject,  at times, turns to each of us.  Harry goes on further to   suggest a simple plan. Being "careful" just is not enough It takes kindness to be a man.   If you can see with your ears, you can listen with your heart.  Thanks, PTG.

      This is a tribute to all the families facing the death of a loved one and all the people facing those families.  May you all have lived life to its fullest and take solace, in at the very least, that fact alone.   Watching waywardly as time approaches means life is passing you by.  One dives head-first as one indulges without the question of why.  Only later does the wind throw back your caution into your now realistic face.  The drones of life come calling  when life then slows its pace.  The moments are few and far among when freedom and circumstance meet.  When cares far away have been flung and responsibility seems to retreat.  Grasp strongly such times in gentle hands the nexus that harmony wrought.  For life that's lived often itself demands much more than just what we've sought.

      Today's post is dedicated to those codependent people out there who coincidentally happen to be featured in the horrifically bad pun that is my chosen title for the day.  Truth be told, we all have our various vices and asundry supports.  There is always something that someone cannot live without, and I don't just mean water.  Something that would alter the very fiber of your being so much that even the water I just spoke of would sublimate straight to vapor.  (Oooh...big words...and misused at that!)  So here's a little light-hearted affair to shed much-needed light on our mixed-up, muddled-up, muggled-up, made-up world of the things that we think we know we just have to have and the idiots out there who fail to recognize our brilliance.   Mary had a little lamb.  Or did the little lamb have Mary?  The lamb was sure to go everywhere that Mary went.  (How cute.) But make it a bear....and then it's scary.  The thing in life that we cannot truly live without, is the very thing you make it.  But look upon another's choices, and we can hardly stand to take it.  Coffee?  Sportscenter?  A sale at Neimann Marcus? Greeting the morning sun and spells? There was a road to Damascus?  The big account, the deal just closed, the script that's finally read. Decorating shows, motorcycle builds, and books just before bed.  Cats or dogs, fish or birds, or pets be damned I say! Kids are my life, I love my wife, or single to my dying day...  We laugh and judge the lambs and Marys  that exist outside our world.  The simple fact of life is that we all have parts of both. Mutton is as mutton does, as long as you're the shepherd.
