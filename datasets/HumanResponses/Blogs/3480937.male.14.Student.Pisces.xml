      Watch this...  [Chorus] These are my confessions Just when I thought I said all I can say My chick on the side said she's got one on the way These are my confessions Man I'm throwed and I dont know what to do But I guess I gotta give you part two of my confessions If I'm gonna tell it then I gotta tell it all Damn near cried when I got that phone call I'm so throwed and I don't know what to do But to give you part two of my confessions  [Verse 1] Now this gon' be the hardest thing I think I ever had to do Got me talkin' to myself askin' how I'm gon' tell you 'bout that chick on part 1 I told ya'll I was creepin' with, creepin' with Said she's 3 months pregnant and she's keepin' it The first thing that came to mind was you Second thing was how do I know if it's mine and is it true Third thing was me wishin' that I never did what I did How I ain't ready for no kid and bye bye to our relationship  [Chorus] These are my confessions Just when I thought I said all I can say My chick on the side said she got one on the way These are my confessions Man I'm throwed and I don't know what to do I guess I gotta give you part 2 of my confessions If I'm gonna tell it then I gotta tell it all Damn near cried when I got that phone call I'm so throwed and I don't know what to do But to give you part 2 of my confessions  [Verse 2] I'm steady stuck on stupid tryna figure out When, what, and how I'mma let this come out of my mouth Said it ain't gon' be easy But I need to stop thinkin', contemplatin' Be a man and get it over with (over with) I'm ridin' in my whip Racin' to her place Talkin' to myself Preparin' to tell her to her face She open up the door and didn't want to come near me I said 1 second,baby Please hear me  [Chorus] These are my confessions Just when I thought I said all I can say My chick on the side said she got one on the way These are my confessions Man I'm throwed and I don't know what to do I guess I gotta give you part 2 of my confessions If I'm gonna tell it then I gotta tell it all Damn near cried when I got that phone call I'm so throwed and I don't know what to do But to give you part 2 of my confessions  [Breakdown] This by far is the hardest thing I think I've ever had to do To tell you, the woman I love That I'm having a baby by a woman that I barely even know I hope you can accept the fact that I'm man enough to tell you this And hopefully you'll give me another chance This ain't about my career This ain't about my life It's about us and what we go through  [Chorus] These are my confessions Just when I thought I said all I can say My chick on the side said she got one on the way These are my confessions Man I'm throwed and I don't know what to do I guess I gotta give you part 2 of my confessions If I'm gonna tell it then I gotta tell it all Damn near cried when I got that phone call I'm so throwed and I don't know what to do But to give you part 2 of my confessions

      Its should had been like that months ago, yet it happens right now.. Life ish gone, a settled case for me..its going down..downhill..too steep for me to climb up.  Too many stupid problems for me to take, i am fragile right now,if u want to kick me in the face,insult me,or whatever,do it now..i won't do anything.  a fake front ish all i need to get over the year,then at least it will be better..wish the year can end right now..i can't do it anymore,i can't help anyone, noone can help me either, nort even God.  I am sinking, right to the bellows of hell, no return, no remorse, no nothing, nort even a single breathe of life emitting, guess its over now.

      [Intro]  I don't understand why  See it's burning me to hold onto this  I know this is something I gotta do  But that don't mean I want to  What I'm trying to say is that I-love-you I just  I feel like this is coming to an end  And it's better for me to let it go now than hold on and hurt you  I gotta let it burn   [Verse 1]  It's gonna burn for me to say this  But it's comin from my heart  It's been a long time coming  But we done been fell apart  Really wanna work this out  But I don't think you're gonna change  I do but you don't  Think it's best we go our separate ways  Tell me why I should stay in this relationship  When I'm hurting baby, I ain't happy baby  Plus there's so many other things I gotta deal with  I think that you should let it burn   [Chorus]  When your feeling ain't the same and your body don't want to  But you know gotta let it go cuz the party ain't jumpin' like it used to  Even though this might ruin you  Let it burn  Let it burn  Gotta let it burn   Deep down you know it's best for yourself but you  Hate the thought of her being with someone else  But you know that it's over  We know that it's through  Let it burn  Let it burn  Gotta let it burn   [Verse 2]  Sendin' pages I ain't supposed to  Got somebody here but I want you  Cause the feelin ain't the same by myself  Callin' her your name  Ladies tell me do you understand?  Now all my fellas do you feel my pain?  It's the way I feel  I know I made a mistake  Now it's too late  I know she ain't comin back  What I gotta do now  To get my shorty back  Ooo ooo ooo ooooh  Man I don't know what I'm gonna do  Without my booo  You've been gone for too long  It's been fifty-leven days, um-teen hours  Imma be burnin' till you return (let it burn)   [Chorus]  When your feeling ain't the same and your body don't want to  But you know gotta let it go cuz the party ain't jumpin' like it used to  Even though this might ruin you  Let it burn (let it burn, let it burn, you gon'learn)  Let it burn (gotta let it burn)  Gotta let it burn   Deep down you know its best for yourself but you  Hate the thought of her being with someone else  But you know that it's over  We know that it's through  Let it burn  Let it burn  Gotta let it burn   [Bridge]  I'm twisted cuz one side of me is tellin' me that I need to move on  On the other side I wanna break down and cry (ooooh)  I'm twisted cuz one side of me is tellin' me that I need to move on  On the other side I wanna break down and cry (yeah)   [Breakdown]  Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh oooh  Ooh ooh oooh (can ya feel me burnin'?)  Ooh ooh ooh oooh ooh oooh   So many days, so many hours  I'm still burnin' till you return   [Chorus]  When your feeling ain't the same and your body don't want to  But you know gotta let it go cuz the party ain't jumpin' like it used to  Even though this might ruin you  Let it burn  Let it burn  Gotta let it burn   Deep down you know it's best for yourself but you  Hate the thought of her being with someone else  But you know that it's over  We know that it's through  Let it burn  Let it burn  Gotta let it burn
