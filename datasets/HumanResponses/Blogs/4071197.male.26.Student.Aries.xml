       Hello gang!   To get started, I have decided that Stephanie and me will argue for a centralization and Bernhard and PK for a decentralization.  Secondly, if you all email me your email adresses, I can send you an invitation to become members of this blog. However, that is only for you own amusement, you can still just post your stuff at WebCT and I will copy it over to our blog.  If you have any questions, just let me know.  Yours truly, Carl :-)  urlLink jonaswallentin@yahoo.com

       Think first  Some subjects are more suitable than others to take online; it all depends on the student’s background and experience. While a student with a BSBA in Accounting might prefer to take the grad accounting course online, another student, who is not as charmed by numbers as the first one, might prefer to take it in class. Generally, the classroom environment is apprehended as more helpful and supportive, as it provides a closer link to the instructor face-to-face. Therefore, an in-class course might be preferable if the subject is perceived as very difficult and complicated. Lastly, it is a good advice to always, if possible, take concentration courses in-class. In my own experience, they are usually a little less theoretical, as they often offer more personal and practical points of view.   Self-discipline  Some online courses have weekly chat room discussions, while others are a little more flexible in their structure. Still, there are fixed deadlines and due dates, which demand continuous efforts throughout the semester. Since an online course, due to its impersonal form, is easily apprehended as less impending than its in-class version, it is very simple to postpone work to a rainy day. Therefore, an online course requires students to not let their self-discipline subside. If there is group work involved, it is particularly important to not wait until the last minute, as this might cause trouble for will-powered team members.   Access  Access to a computer with an Internet connection is probably the most critical success factor. Without Internet access, success will be truly hard to accomplish. While the computer lab might be sufficient for ordinary school work, it is by a hair’s breadth sufficient for an online class. Potential online students should bear in mind; an online class does not mean less work, in fact, more often than not does such a class signify the opposite. On the other hand, a broadband connection is not of vital importance. Though it makes it a whole lot easier, a dial-up connection is certainly sufficient for online success.   Computer literacy  Just as certain courses have specific prerequisites to simplify matters, basic computer literacy is to recommend to anyone considering taking an online class. Knowing your way around the Internet and using fundamental software like Microsoft Office is of vital importance. The risk, otherwise, is that the student spends more time solving irrelevant and unrelated problems rather than participating and resolving course related assignments. However, considering that the student in question is assumingly already accepted into grad school, we can only hope that he or she posses a fundamental understanding of computers and their accessories.   Motivation  Without motivation it is hard to succeed in any endeavor embarked on. An online class is no exception. Enthusiasm and a genuine interest to do well are the driving forces of success. Since it is harder for an online instructor to empower his or her students – after all, an in-class a professor’s true zest for the subject is more easily transferable – the online student benefits the most if they behold a craving desire already before the course starts. Furthermore, by carefully reading the syllabus and other information provided, an online student can better plan the semester, and thereby avoid future bottlenecks. By continuously keeping up with the current schedule, the student increases his or her chances to thrive.

      With customer-focus as one of the business world’s most important strategies, implementing customer relationship management (CRM) initiatives is becoming a progressively common feature in all industries. O’Brien (2004) explains that by using CRM information systems, companies try to increase customer value over time and to gain a competitive advantage over competitors. CRM initiatives aim at creating a cross-functional framework within an organization, an enterprise system that combines and computerizes many of the processes that involve the customer, including sales, marketing, customer service and support, retention and loyalty programs, and contact and account management. Furthermore, the CRM system integrates these customer service processes with the remainder of the company’s business functions.  Reference O’Brien, J. A. (2004).

       CRM Links - General Information    urlLink A Lesson from Toys ‘Were’ Us: Use Tech to Personalize , by Evan SchumanPublished in eWeek, August 14, 2004The article argues that Toys “R” Us’ announcement that it might leave the toy business has less to do with Wal-Mart and more to do with the company’s inability to exploit technology in building positive customer relationship. According to Shuman, Toys “R” Us has only perceived technology as a means to cut costs, but failed to utilize CRM systems to understand customers, anticipate their needs, and, eventually, fulfill these needs.   urlLink IT Buyers Weigh in on CRM Progress , by Peter Coffee Published in eWeek, March 29, 2004  Coffee (2004) reports from Ziff Davis Media eSeminar, Best Practices for Customer Relationship Management. It discloses what IT buyers expect to gain from CRM systems, for example how to identify, acquire and retain customers as well as sharpen the companies’ competitive edge. Additionally, readers are reminded that the C in CRM is too often missing. According to the article, CRM systems may increase sales, but they do not necessarily increase and improve customer relationship.    CRM Implementation Links - Methodology &amp; Lessons Learned    urlLink Anatomy of a Successful CRM Program , author unknown Published on FullView Consulting’s Website, no date given  The report tells the winning story of how InfiNet Company implemented a CRM program that came in on time and under budget. It describes the methodology the company used to transition from its old legacy and support system. Focus is given to various parts of the process, such as establish the requirements, create a strategy, design of the program, and implementation. Weight is also given to what challenges InfiNet came across and what lessons it learned.    urlLink A CRM Success Story , Christopher Milliken Published in ComputerWorld, November 7, 2002  Milliken explains how Boise Office Solutions implemented a successful CRM system. He describes the process used and points out that it is the same procedures the company utilizes in all technical endeavors. According to the article, the main objectives are to know your customers, understand their needs, and ensure that the implementation phase is as easy as possible for them. In other words, by fostering a culture with a customer-focus, projects will have long-term prospective rather than short-sighted opportunities.    urlLink Lessons Learned from a CRM Success Story , by David Southgate Published at TechRepublic.com, January 13, 2003  This text tells the story of how TidalWire, a Massachusetts-based company, implemented a CRM initiative. Southgate explains how TidalWire overcome the biggest barrier for the success of contemporary CRM projects – the resistance to change that is infused in a firm’s culture – and what lessons the company learned along the way. Lastly, the author recognizes that return on investment can be hard to measure, unless performance metrics have been benchmarked before implementation.

       Subject:  Centralization vs. Decentralization of Information Systems   Assignment specified:  The management and control of information systems must be centralized in the business. Debate the issue.  The leader chooses one side (centralized vs. decentralized) and selects one of the group members to argue the point. The leader assigns the other two members to argue the opposing view point.   Arguing for a centralization:  Carl Wallentin Stephanie Tancayo   Arguing for a decentralization:  Bernhard Lehner Pisith Kulkanchanachewin  * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *  Introducing the terms centralization / decentralization   According to Wall (n.d.), information systems (IS) are major part of today’s businesses. Currently, though, it is becoming a controversy whether IS should be centralized or decentralized. Generally, IS can be centralized, decentralized, partly centralized, and partly decentralized. Wall stated that decentralized systems provide flexibility, independence, empowerment, and service orientation to individual business units or departments. On the other hand, centralized systems allow an organization to allocate all of its IT resources to one particular business department, for example the IS department that provides IT services to the whole company. This approach brings about control, efficiency, and cost reductions  *********************  Argumentation in support of centralization   After a decentralization trend of ISs in the 1980s and 1990s, more and more companies are now moving towards recentralization of the IT recourses. No longer are IT operations merely a solver of efficiency problems and other unit crisis at factory floors, call centers, and other parts of a business. Now, as expressed by Stephanie Stahl (2004), “cost cutting, intense ROI demands, … and other factors are driving a new level of automation and efficiency within the core IT department.” While the decentralization increased local sensitivity, as argued before, costs and control bolted away. Therefore, to gain improved control over resources and budget, “these departments are [now expected to] incorporate the constant improvement and process optimization in their own operations”.  According to Darrell Dunn (2004), more than three out of four managers consider obtaining better return on IT investment a top priority for their companies. Taking that objective into account, automating more ISs, thereby “boosting utilization rates, cutting costs, reducing downtime, [and] speeding up application … deployments”, saves both valuable time and money. Another advantage by centralizing systems is that companies can more swiftly spot trends. Dunn describes, for example, how consumer electronics retailer Best Buy Co. uses a centralized program to monitor activities in its more than 600 stores. With help of the program, Best Buy can quickly recognize recurring problem and swiftly assess whether it is global in nature or limited to one store or one region. This has, additionally, reduced help-desk volume, thereby saving both money and increasing customer satisfaction.  *********************  Argumentation in support of decentralization   Contrary to what was stated in the last argumentation, a recent study presented by Kahai (2003) shows that 46% of all participants would describe their IS in the past as highly centralized. However, only 27% still say that it is highly centralized in their current configuration, and a prediction for the future resulted in only 16% highly centralized systems. Kahai discusses the problems associated with this trend of decentralization, such as difficulties with maintenance of the IS. Despite this disadvantage, the article comes to the conclusion that the decentralization trend will hold in the future. Two reasons exemplified was: (1) Employees computer skills will increase further, thereby requiring less centralization. (2) Technological developments will benefit decentralization, as PCs get more and more powerful, they are able to perform processes, which in the past only where abled by centralized “super computers”. Much more than that, todays business environment is changing faster than ever before, and with out decentralization, companies are just not as efficient in adapting to the changes at different places and times. The article, however, states that some centralization will be necessary in the future, to provide some of the advantages such as easy adaptation of new software and limited management control.  *********************  Argumentation in support of centralization   The trend in business today is, no, not decentralization, but for companies, as mentioned earlier, to push to recentralize their IT operations in order to reduce costs and achieve better economies of scale on technology purchases. As explained by Hoffman, recentralization can be counted on to yeild savings on “infrastructure and other IT services that are driven by a large level of fixed costs.” For example, companies that consolidate their data centers generally see a cost reduction of 10% to 15% in that area. Nevertheless, a major stumbling block to recentralization is to effectively communicating the rationale for the process to all IT staffers and business users. Many may feel threatened by the new structure because they may feel as though they are losing control of their operations. However, if these users are properly informed, educated, and involved in the process, the transition can be a much smoother one. Organizational change is nearly always a difficult and threatening process. Therefore, it is importnant to help end users understand the value of IT and a centralized IS.  The most common approach to business intelligence, according to Whiting, is to assemble a team of developers to build a data warehouse or data mart for a specific project, buy a reporting tool to use with it, an disassemble the team upon the project’s completion. This however is like “reinventing the wheel,” and such implementations can result in high development and support costs and incompatible buisness-intelligence systems throughout a company. Some companies are, consequently, taking a more strategic aproach: standardizing on fewer business-intelligence tools and making them available throughout their organizations even before projects are planned. To execute these strategies, companies are creating dedicated groups, sometimes called competency centers or centers of excellence, to manage business-intelligence projects and provide techincal and analytical expertise to other employees. These centers are ususally staffed with people who have a variety of technical, business, and data-analysis expertise, and the centers become a repository of business-intelligence related skills. Again, cost reduction is often the driving factor for companies to create these centralized competancy centers to consolidate business-intelligence systems. Chris Amos, a reporting solutions manager at British Telecom, says that standard technology and implementation practices can reduce the cost of some business-intelligence projects by up to 95%.  *********************  Argumentation in support of decentralization   There are many advantages of decentralized IS. First of all, a decentralized system provide a company organizational responsiveness. Second, the startup costs for decentralized IS are relatively low. Third, an organization can tailor and scale the system to meet individual needs. Fourth, the most important advantage of a decentralized IS is that it provides organizational flexibility. This stems from the fact that each individual unit control their own IS. As a result, multiple computer systems are involved. If one of its network systems fails, other systems will still be able to run. Lastly, decentralized IS also provide company benefits of increased accountability, motivation, and management responsiveness.  To exemplify some of the disadvantages of decentralized IS it has to be recognized that a decentralized system of course lacks the control provided of a centralized one. This can lead to the second disadvantage, which is duplication of resources. Because of multiple computer systems, the company may have duplicated resources. In addition, decentralized IS can sometimes cost the company more than centralized IS in the long run. In defiance of these disadvantages, a decentralized IS still provide more advantages to organizations. For efficiency, decentralized information systems allow users to directly control there IS budget and their demands. In addition, decentralized systems also reduce costs and risks of a whole system breakdown. Moreover, decentralized IS reduce top-down communication, flatten organization hierarchies, and increase innovatively responsive. In order to achieve this goal, a organization has to break free of any bureaucratic constraints.  *********************  Argumentation in support of centralization   Some will argue that being locally sensitive while running a centralized information system is impossible. They will defend their standpoint with tooth and nail claiming that running the IS decentralized is the only valid option for a large, global company. Contending that view is Kevin Turner, Chief Information Officer (CIO) of Wal-Mart, who in an interview with Abbie Lundberg (2002) talks about how his company copes with global growth in spite of a commitment to run IS centrally. To understand how large Wal-Mart really is, consider these facts: last year the company generated more than $256 billion in global revenue, managed almost 5,000 stores in 10 different countries, obtained the services of approximately 30,000 suppliers, and operated 1 (o n e!) information system. According to Turner, “running centralized IS with homegrown, common-source code gives Wal-Mart a competitive advantage and helps the company maintain one of the lowest expense structures in retail”.  Nevertheless, in the article Turner recognizes the difficulties of balancing the advantages of a centralized system with the disadvantages in local flexibility. Therefore, three fundamental philosophies govern Wal-Mart’s IS strategy. “The first philosophy is to run a centralized information system for … operations all over the world, and … run that from Arkansas. The second is to have common systems and common platforms. The third is to be merchants first and technologists second.” By keeping the processes and systems almost the same no matter of geographic location, Wal-Mart has managed to drive down costs, become exceedingly efficient, and minimize downtime and start-up time during transition of people. Furthermore, to ensure local flexibility, the company has come up with a model of decentralized decisions but centralized systems and controls. This model bestows people in local markets with a great deal of flexibility, so that they can perform their jobs in the best, most effective way.  *********************  Argumentation in support of decentralization   In times like this, where computer crime seems to be a sport and a terrorist attack could happen every day, a decentralized information system might be the best way to protect a company from disasters. After the attack on September 11, financial institutions are thinking about making their trading networks and their ISs less vulnerable to disasters. As suggested by Thibodeau, decentralized systems, such as those used by electronic communications networks ECN, did have the least problems and were, actually, intact after the attack. Centralized networks, however, were destroyed and it took quite a while to get them working again, not to mention all the lost data. Steven Randich, CIO at Nasdaq Stock Market Inc, explains to Thibodeau that the best way to secure the information systems is not to harden a single point, but not to provide one point of vulnerability. Giving these circumstances companies should rethink the cost cutting advantage of a centralized IS, in comparison to the effect a terrorist attack or even computer virus can have on such a system.  *********************  References   Dunn, D.

       The posting below was made by group member PK on August 1.      Generally, it provides background information and arguments useful for both sides of the debate. Overall, however, the posting positions itself for a decentralization of organizational information systems.      * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * According to Wall (n.d.), Information systems are major part of today’s businesses. It is becoming a controversy that Information systems should be whether centralized or decentralized. Generally, Information systems can be centralized, decentralized, partly centralized, and partly decentralized. As Carl assigned to me, I would like to explain why the management and control of IS should be decentralized. However, I still want to explain briefly information about centralized system. So, it could help our teammate to get some ideas about centralized system too. Wall stated that Decentralized systems provide flexibility, independence, empowerment, and service orientation to individual business units or departments. On the other hand, centralized systems allow an organization to allocate its all IT resources to one particular business department like IS department that provides IT services to the whole company. Its approach is including control, efficiency, and economy. It also allows a company to save its cost when the company centralizes its system. There are many advantages of decentralized information systems. First of all, an autonomy system that brought by decentralizes information systems provide a company organizational flexibility and responsiveness. Second, the startup costs for decentralized information systems are relatively low. Third, an organization can tailor and scale the system to meet individual needs. Fourth, the most important advantage is decentralized IS providing organization flexibility. Due to the fact that each individual unit control their own IS. As a result, multiple computer systems are involved. If one of its network systems fails, the other system will still be able to run. Lastly, decentralized information systems also provide company benefits of increased accountability, motivation, and management responsiveness. However, there also are disadvantages for decentralized information systems. First, decentralized system lack a centralized control. This can lead to the second disadvantage which is duplication of resources. Because of multiple computer systems, the company has many duplicated resources. In addition, decentralized information systems cost the company more than centralized information systems.  Even though decentralized systems have some disadvantages, they still provide more advantages to organizations. For efficiency, decentralized information systems allow users to directly control there IS budget and their demands. In addition, decentralized information systems also reduce costs and risks of a whole system breakdown. In addition, decentralized systems reduce top-down communication, flatten organization hierarchies, and increase innovatively responsive. In order to achieve this goal, a organization has to break free of any bureaucratic constraints.  ReferenceWall, P. (n.d.).
