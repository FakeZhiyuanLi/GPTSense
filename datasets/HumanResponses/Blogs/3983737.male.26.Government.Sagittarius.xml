      My Panamanian sources have just confirmed that a large cargo ship headed for Boston harbor is carrying 300 lbs of Helium-Nitrate.  Helium -Nitrate is most commonly used in small quantities of flouride tooth pastes.  It's strength lies in the bonding structures it creates with other covalent electrons, which attribute to toothpaste's half liquid half solid state.  But in large quantities Helium - Nitrate acts as an analgesic inhibitor which has been known to cause respiratory effects in lab rats.  These studies were conducted in the 50's at the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota before they were stopped by the then FDA head, George Aucher.  Why were they stopped?  Well simply because the test were getting nowhere.  Lab rats were reported to go into convulsions, then followed by a "trance-like" state.  The horror of this report is found in the conclusion which is quoted as follows: "The rats became quite disturbed when the H-N [Helium-Nitrate] was added to their daily diet of sugar and orange juice.  Their aggitation stemmed from their reaction to the H-N.  This reaction we aptly named pow-wow because of the similarities between Native American trance state at gatherings known as Pow-Wows, and the behavior of these rats."  Basically what this says is that they were discovering a new type of psychadelic drug.  Around this time Dutch scientists were perfecting the drug LSD and naturally America's competitive spirit prompted these tests.  The Helium - Nitrate failed to produce the mind altering visual that LSD was able to produce and therfore they trashed Helium - Nitrate Tests.  So what's the cargo ship doing with the 300 lb shipment of Helium - Nitrate to Boston Harbor?  Simple the Democratic national Convention.  And would it suprise you that the ship's last port was in San Luis Obispo California?  And where are the Republican Headquarters for the State of California?  Los Angeles.  Where's the connection?  There isn't one, but if we look a little deeper we might find some answers.  Let's start with the Kennedy's --> Maria Shriver --> The Govenator.  This is where the buck stops.  The estranged Austrian has always been an outsider in the Republicans mind.  Let's put two and two together shall we.  I'm ending here cause my cab shift is about to begin.  I've just set my GPS to align with the geo-synchronous satelite Archibald IV to those interested in watching my progress for tonight.  Remember to keep your eyes and ears open for strange or just a little out of the ordinary actions at the DNC this year in Boston.  When H-N is combined with Betty Crocker cake frosting (sacharine--remember the lab rats daily diet and the "aggetation").  Don't be suprised to see Teressa Heinz hangin from the rafters.  cause JJ Snooka says so
