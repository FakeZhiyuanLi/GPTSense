        Never would I imagine being so tempted to take "him", to hold "him"...to smell "him"....Everything about him drives me onward, draws me closer to "him"...."He" is not like n e other man I've met in my life thus far......and I like the way "he" makes me feel.....That burning desire to be with "him"..... If only we were 2gether.......but sadly we are not....and all I have are the sweet, yet at the same time painful memories within me.... Still n e thing is indeed possible...once u put ur mind at it.....

        No but seriously, what ever happen to them in truth?....where r they?...do the still exists til this day and age?.....r they indeed the care taker of the household, the well-brought up, trustworthy son to their mothers?.....the polite, well-decent boyfriend to their girlfriends?.....the loving and respectable husband?.....r they the protective father to their children?.... do they still exists? that's the question.....i believe there are a few of them....and surely i've met a few...the rest are a pile of shit (the one's that i've so far encountered with of course)

          Some times that feeling would creep up upon you when you least expected it...Take for instance all now so..I am just minding my own bloody business, doing some work online..at the same time checking out some websites, when suddenly I felt that "feeling" from deep inside me...  I know I am human and surely that "feeling" would come and go.....I'm very use to it but at the same time..it can drive you nutts.....  So what did I do to tame that "feeling"?......  I took a bloody cold shower..

        So recently, my friends and I went cinema to check out the movie Alien vs Predator.....and it was good, not excellent, but good...the face off was sweet yet no one fully succeeded at the end...Both the alien and the predator were very much even....(boo!!!) I thought just maybe the predator would get a clean sweep and collect the heads of the aliens as its personal trophy collection or something like that....but instead the alien got the last laugh with an unexpected parting gift 4 the predator at the end of the movie....(hmm very interesting)
