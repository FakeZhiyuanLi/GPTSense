      Well these past two days have been high on one end and then low on another. I guess you have to lean as much as you can and move on. Last night Kevin and I went to a revolving sushi place and by revolving I mean the food. It was great. I tried many things that I'm not sure I would have a year ago. It was good times and by the time I started stared being lulled asleep by the melodic moving food it was time to go. So we walked towards Union Sq.  ( it was an awesome night, the kinda night where the air is the same temp. as your skin). We went to NaNa's kareoke bar again. It was fun, but I think we were both tired and still kinda bummed about some stuff that had happend earlier. But it was a good time. I learn a lot everyday, even if it's as simple as the words to another David Bowie song. Today was strange, it feels kinda like it hasn't happend yet. I went to the bank to deposit my check, which here takes about three hours. By the time I came back a lot of things had happend. Needless to say and without me saying more than I should, Kevin and I went for pizza. Cheese and dough, they solve a lot of problems. I took off tonight a little early, returned some shoes, called my mom to find out the status of the fam. and her current QVC purchases. In a few hours I am going out for another movie, probably kareoke again and maybe who knows...I'm not sure, it's too soon to tell.

      Ah yes welcome to the wonderful world of confused direction. I guess I need to learn to stop being so hard on myself. I have made it a personal goal of mine to really learn to stop taking myself so seriously. I've decided to put myself in as many situations as possible that give me opportunities to look silly. I'm thinking of taking classes at the Fred Astare Dance Studio. Hmmm, what do you think? Dancing with strangers? That could cause some potentially awkward situations. Anyway, I'm doing it. I've already picked up some info. I think I want to start with Salsa. We will see this could lead to a possible career switch. Well, as to the title of this note today we had another meeting. Gesh I'm just really sucking ass right now.  Ah well, as long as I'm learning something and keeping myself busy all will not be lost. It's just a bummer. I just want to break through. I think maybe my brain is still acting on Atlanta time. Maybe I need some fried food or sweet tea to get things going, although I've tried the sweet tea here and it's not the same. It's not even close.

      Sigh...*dramatic pause*...sigh.  Okay, so a little more frustration. We won't talk about that though. There's more to life than the crap. So I'm going to Ohio for Megan's wedding. It's awesome b/c the flight voucher I had from my London trip is more than enough to cover my ticket to Ohio. I can't wait to see the girls. It's crazy, all the weddings and babies and stuff. I feel a little behind, like maybe I should have a mortgage or have developed a smoking habit or something by now. I have bounced a few checks and as of now I'm $45 overdrawn in my account. I still haven't got paid yet, so that doesn’t help. But no worries I will Thursday. So tomorrow I have to wake up early and go to the Delta office to get my ticket. Riding the train in the morning is good times. People are all rushing about trying to avoid eye contact, keeping their hands in front of them so as not to brush anyone without permission. It's funny to watch it's like a watching a human moving maze. It's funny how people just know where to go. I'm right...you're left. My umbrella goes up....yours down. I sit you scootch. I sat down next to a guy, he was older, kinda bald, in a blue suit with a stare like he was trying to looking through his paper. I rode for a while and as soon as the bench cleared he grabbed his bad and moved to the other side. I was kinda hurt. We'd shared so much, like five stops and my reading over his shoulder a little. I didn't mean to offend. Ah well, everyone has their quirks, I guess I should just learn to study them a little better.

      So it's Monday and the new guy Josh is cool. Another cool kat. And he's got the Circus insider talk. I like it, makes me cry a silent tear for all my friends back at school. Steph is coming next week and I'm so excited. Well, this weekend I had an idea for a new concept website that I"m going to work on. It's about pennies, finding them, picking them up...all day having good luck or all year even. I thought it would be cool too see how many pennies I can find in NYC in a year. I just know how much the penny has become totally obsolete. I drop them and usually don't pick them up. I want to see how much I can find in a year. My not so important, not really a goal, goal is $50 which might be kinda high since right now I only have $.12. We will see. I'm going to create a website and really document my finds, ie which neighborhood and the best places to find them. Right now I'm saying the subway, since this weekend I found 4 in the subways. It will give me something else to do until work gets a little more busy. Which should be soon. I'm getting a little more comfortable here. I love the peeps. They are super cool, very laid back. I like our corner and all the creatives that sit here. I like that Kevin is a great ping pong player and that he takes me to Karaoke. He doesn’t know it, but it freaks me out a bit, but I still go b/c it's teaching me to chill out a little more. We will see if this sticks or not. But there is totally good vibes here. Smart people. I could learn a lot here. I wish I could take everyone home to go see my metropolis. I'd take them all camping and maybe explore a few mines. I'm sure my mom would make them a giant dinner of turkey and dressing with homemade bread, but I know Chauncy wouldn't eat a lot of  that...he's still on Atkins, and sticking to it.

      Um yeah, yesterday...not so much. Had big plans really. Thought things were going pretty well and then the rain came and with it the monkey wrench into the plans of my life. Sorry to sound so dramatic it'd seem worse if it was you I guess. Sometimes I like to get caught up in my metaphors whether or not they have much relevance. Anyway what happened I'm sure is a common occurrence with the younger breed of creative folk...aka the brush-off. I'll give you the short version...We were supposed to meet....we waited and waited and kept getting bumped by other teams. No biggie we are the new kids, we will wait our turn. But then I had to push a meeting back. No prob he didn't mind and I really wanted to get some feedback on my ideas, some kind of direction for the weekend. So when it go to be our turn. It was pretty much time to go home. We had 15 min. to ramble through everything. Sad, bummer, sucks. I wish I had done a better job of speed presenting. I need to work on that. And then my meeting. I called him, he said call him on my way out. I did, not answer and I didn't want to run through the rain to the Westside if he'd already left. So I waited at Starbucks for an hour or so with Kevin. We stewed, talked about creative injustice, talked about maybe how we could change things and what if this and what if that. I decided that I was too salty for human contact and Kevin caught the train to Astoria. Florence called a few hours later. We got Thai and she wanted to go to a Poetry reading. I explained I was too salty but we'd do it next Friday she said it was cool. I went home to my journal and I think she went out to go dancing. I'm glad she did. She's awesome.

      Well today is a lot of new things. We have a new art director if I didn't mention it before. She's super cool and even lives in the village really close by. She likes the same kind of music as me, which is awesome since I haven't been to a show for so long. She also has three years experience at Ogilvy. I am really going to pick her for information and help as much as I can. She seems to be very willing to help me figure everything out. Plus she's funny, highly important I believe. Her partner isn't starting till next week, but is a Circus grad apparently. Also new is the new business that we are working on. Sounds fun, it's fashion which is totally my middle name...*insert sarcasm here* but really it sounds like they are looking for some really alternative viral stuff which could be really fun to work on. I'm looking forward to really sitting down with this. Also new are these shoes that I'm wearing, or was wearing until they shredded my heels and toes into blistered centers for a pain festival. God please help not give all my paychecks over to Band Aid. Anyways, these are going back. I'm just going to start putting my money towards house slippers and socks. I don't know how people survive here. I really believe that the people of this city are all amputees walking around on plastic and peg legs. I guess either that or they have an amazing threshold for pain. Whatever I might have to start walking on my hands to mix things up.

      Things here are okay. I am happy about my place, the E.village is cool. It's kinda an eclectic mix of warped tour meets flea market meets hipster. If you guys remember the  Andy Griffith Show and the town square, you know where Barney ticketed Aunt Bea for jay walking? Well it's nothing like that at all. Anyway, I've met a lot of cool people. My partner Kevin is great and has been showing me some great Asian restaurants and karaoke bars. He's way cool and a great designer. I've also met a cool girl named Florence who lives one window shout away from me on St. Marks. It's random how we met through craigslist when I was trying to find a sublet. But she's great and has been taking me around the different neighborhoods. My job right now is okay. Not super creative yet. It's been a little frustrating and I find myself a little stir crazy.  So far New York hasn't failed to deliver surprises. From the crazies who like to yell at me, the pure hatred for female footwear, utter respect for lifetime New Yorkers, and my new love of anything Thai. I absolutely believe that this city could teach me a thousand things a day. I guess it does have a lot to do with the outcome of my job hunt 2004, but we will see. I'm hopeful that if anything I could raise some money by acting crazy and yelling at tourists in Central Park.

      Well yes the weekend is over. It was a good one. Saw some cool movies, ate some good food, drank a lot of Starbucks coffee. I'm currently reading three books so I spent some time with a C.S. Lewis book "Screwtape Letters" I recommend it, if your not in the mood for a light read with a short attention span. Good stuff. Anyway, perhaps your are wondering as to the title of this note. Well today as I was people watching from my perch in the coffee shop I overheard this guy kinda of singing to himself. Someone would walk past him in a cell phone shuffle and he would just start taking their conversation and turning it into this kind of jazz rap type song. He kinda looked like George Carlton, hmm maybe it was. He had a newsboy cap pulled down over his eyes that I'm sure were bloodshot from a night of jazz and smokes. He just kind of taped his foot like he was hearing music that he would write. Of course all in black with gray greasy hair tied back in a pony tail. All I could think of was "crazy, crazy cool kat." NYC is a total city full of characters. All the sitcoms live here, the sketches, the stand up routines, the one-liners and maybe even the dirty jokes (I'm pretty sure I saw a one-legged stripper). There's been so many stories I've heard about this city, the crazies, the black outfits, the music, the stories and I'm slowly understanding that to a certain extent they are all true. Florence the other day mentioned that her friends on the upper Westside were informed that they just discovered that the woman one floor above them had died, one month ago. Yikes, does this really happen? I guess so. There's no commercial breaks in NYC. It's life in fast forward.

      So, here it is Thursday. Last weekend was my first weekend here alone. It was good, nothing too special. I watched a movie at the Sunshine, a cool independent theater near here. Go see "Napoleon Dynamite" it is very cool. Lots of details to watch for, very cool lighting and set. The characters are awesome and plus any movie with a Trapper Keeper is okay by me. But this past weekend I just did a lot of wandering. I walked pretty much from Chinatown to Midtown. I met up with Michelle from Atlanta and we had Bubble Tea which is awesome. It's like sweet tea with these gelatin balls in them. Saturday after the tea Michelle and her friend went off to get manicures and pedicures. I don't know I'm sure someday I will really like my feet enough to have some one shine them and polish them, but for now I wouldn't want to force anyone to go through that. So after they left for the grooming I started walking. By the time I got to Times Sq. I was starving and wondering why I'd left my Geo back in WVA. So I met up with Michelle and her friend at some Cafe where I ate pickles and could never get anyone to take my order. The girls took me to some fancy places on 5th Ave. where the doors were giant and the clothes were tiny. Um, yeah not so much for me. Please if I ever decide to clip my hair up with a $45 rubber band you all have free reign to punch me directly in the face. So needless to say my flip flops and denim attire didn't have merchants running to show me the dressing room. Alas I will save my gold card for another day. Anyway this is getting long. So then dinner, cool place on the lower east side where we ran into Dave Rudd and David Schwimmer from Friends. Then to a Cuban club for some dancing and fancy drinks. I've gotta find an Irish Pub soon. I can't handle anymore drinks with leaves or fruit. After a quick dance I jumped a cab back to home.

      Well, yesterday Miss. Price arrived. It's nice to have a framilar face here for a while. We went out to Bar 89 with Kevin and got overpriced cheeseburgers and were amazed by their crazy, posh bathrooms. Afterwards Steph and I enjoyed some Sangria and talked about school and what I've been missing. The nicest thing was I think being able to show someone around. I've liked having people take me around the city, but I think just showing Steph a little made it feel just a little bit more like a home. We will see if it wants to keep me. I have some meetings and this and that in the next few weeks. I will try to find something. If not then I wouldn't mind spending September camping back in Cannan Valley. I really do miss quiet, trees, the river and gravel roads. I'm sure it will be there whenever I get all this running around out of my system. And as everyone back home tells me...I'm pretty sure it will still be the same.

      Um, could it be any hotter? I think this past weekend was the closest I've been to being on a train in S. France since actually being there. New York metro in the summer is the equivalent to walking into an arm pit. At a constant state of sweating this weekend, I believe I might have to up my laundry time to once a week. Which is unfortunate due to the creepy guy who works the Laundromat and keeps trying to sell me detergent. Perhaps the heat is a good thing. It is probably good that with all my eating out I usually sweat off the calories on the walk back to my apartment. Besides sweating this weekend I also managed to visit the Met. and see an exhibit on the Lombard school of Italy, including Carravagio. Unfortunately there weren't a lot of his paintings, although there was one that I hadn't seen. There was also an Andy Goldsworthy piece  on the roof which was awesome to see in person. The Met. is an insane blur of greatness. I couldn't take it all in. I'll have to plan better next time. Last night after the Met. and church, Kevin and I went to an Indian restaurant where I ate too much as always and then we met up with Kevin's friends, drank Sangria and talked about aspirational things like what where we were going to eat on Monday for lunch. These decisions take time.
