						    The Sabbath   I am convinced, as I have been for a few years, that the Sabbath does not begin and end at midnight.  Nor do I believe the Sabbath somehow begins (or germinates) when one goes to sleep, awaking to the Sabbath.  Rather, I believe the Sabbath begins and ends at sunset, as it did for the Jews.  Though our American days do not begin and end until midnight, I do not think it is the manner experienced by the Jews and Christians in first century Palestine.  The practical implications of the Sabbath beginning and ending at sunset far outweigh that of a Sabbath beginning at midnight (when everyone is asleep) or when one awakes an hour or two prior to corporate worship.  At sunset, on Saturday evening, a person or family can begin preparing for the Sabbath corporate worship.  One can prepare the whole evening prior to going to sleep, rather than trying to prepare an hour or two prior to corporate worship.  A family or individual can worship together on the Sabbath, preparing for corporate worship prior to resting the night away.

						   Though I started volume eight of  The Works of Thomas Goodwin , as well as  Justification Vindicated  by Robert Trail, I have decided to pick up a good piece of fiction.  The latest book I take with me to work, the bathroom, the living room, study, and bedroom is  A Confederacy of Dunces  by John Kennedy Toole.  The book is about a thirty year old man, Ignatius Reilly, who lives in New Orleans with his mother, Mrs. Reilly.  Ignatius is the epitome of an arrogant dunce, though not to exclude his intelligence and creativity.  His efforst are slothfulness to the Nth degree.  He has a flare for overdramatics at every point.  It is quite hilarious to read about his life, especially in the dialogue.  He is a large and obese man of thirty years of age; lives with his mother; doesn't have a jog; graduated with a masters, though; is a slob; a pig; and an absolute repugnant person.  It is a classic.  A Confederacy of Dunces is a pulitzer prize-winning novel, and it is easy to see why.  The book is a modest 400 pages, and I'm only in the mid-one hundreds, and I'm already "hooked."  I was hooked from page one, though.  I do believe this book (behind the title page) contains one of the best quotes I've ever read:  When a true genius appears in the world, you may know him by this sign, that the dunces are all in confederacy against him (Jonathan Swift--"Thoughts on Various Subjects, Moral and Diverting").   There is some "language" in the pages, but it is not rampant or gratuitous.  Anyone who can stomach an occasional "cuss word" must read this for a good laugh.  It is a classic piece of contemporary fiction.

						   I have decided to make " Theological " its own category, too.  Under this I will related all of my personal religious reflections, whether of academia or subjective natures, and ponder many queries.  It is amazing how my sinfulness is revealed in such  interesting  manners.  I own a bookstore.  I sell books, theological books, for a living.  Therefore, most of my customers are professing Christians.  That, in and of itself, has its advantages.  It's nice to know that most of my customers will profess faith and be restrained by God's grace to the gospel obediences.  Yet, amazingly enough, these customers can really bug me, though not necessarily out of anything they do or say to me.  I'm reminded of the movie "Clerks," in which a "cash register attendent" states: "This job would be great if it weren't for the customers."  *I do not recommend or endorse the viewing of this movie.*   And, as a Christian, I feel this way too, and my customers are  professing Christians !  What is it I loathe?  My sinfulness is pricked by a customer wandering around the store for an hour, especially if they don't buy anything.  Why?  Well, I'm not free to act as I want, leave the store, stretch my legs, or "be myself."  I have to wait for them to leave.  Also, why is it that people always want to talk to me at great lengths on subjects that have nothing to do with why they are in the bookstore?  Do I have a sign on my forehead that reads, "Argue with me!"?  Or, "Vent to me!"?  Or, "Annoy me!"?  Or, "Ask me one hundred questions!"?  Now, don't get me wrong.  This is not how I usually and sinfully feel.  However, there are certain days--and certain customers--who provoke my sinfulness at an instant.  It is very difficult and frustrating.  I don't WANT to be this way.  How do I escape such sin?  How do I mortify my flesh so that this does not flame the fires of sin?  All I know is that I have a LONG way to go.  As someone, somewhere once said, "It's a long road to glory."

						   "Now, what was Moses's petition?  It follows, ver. 9, 'And he said, Now if I have found grace in thy sight, O Lord, let my Lord, I pray thee, go amongst us, for it is a stiff-necked people, and pardon our iniquities and our sin, and take us for thine inheritance.'  In which, as I said, he puts into use and practice (laying hold on the words now spoken by God) himself to speak a good word from thence for that people.  The effect of which prayer is, that although they were indeed a sitff-necked people, as any in the world (this he first confessed), that yet God, for this his name's sake, would not leave them, but pardon their iniquities, and mine own too, Lord, says he, for the expression is, 'pardon our iniquities.'  Which for God to do was the plain intent of his declaring it.  And it is implied that God would do this not for the present only, but to continue to do it.  He prays for the future as well as for the present when he says, 'Pardon our iniquities,' &c.  This the words foregoing, 'for it is a stiff-necked people,' i.e., they will ever and anon be sinning against thee, and also the words that follow, do shew, 'Take us for thine inheritance,' says Moses, which words CAlvin renders ut possideas nos, that though mayest possess us for thine inheritance.  As if he had said, says he, God cannot come to enjoy and possess his chosen as his inheritance, otherwise than by pardoning their sins continually; for man's frailty is such that they would, after his receiving pardon, fall from that grace, if they be not continually reconciled to him; which concerns us Gentiles as well as them then.  God must not only take us to be his, but keep us to be his, and continue to be merciful to us, according to this his great name, or we shall be utterly lost and undone" (Page 19 of Volume Eight of  The Works of Thomas Goodwin ).  And elaborating on this including us Gentiles in the New Covenant, Thomas Goodwin finds a similar typology in Jonah, as Jonah proclaims the very same verse of Exodus 34:  "I only add this comfortable observation (comfortable indeed to us Gentiles) from Jonah's allegation of these words, even that 'Jehovah,' gracious and merciful,' &c., as in MOses it was proclaimed, that this proclamation concerned not only the JEws, or was a measure for God to go by towards that people, but was intended by God, even at the first delivery, for us Gentiles also.  For he proceeded according to the tenor of it with thos Ninevites, who were an handsel of the Gentile's conversion to come.  And therefore let us Gentiles, from the apostle's instruction, Rom. xv. 9-11, adore and glorify God for his mercy, and exercise our faith much upon these blessed words,'Jehovah, gracious, merciful, long-suffering, abundant in kindness and truth,' as having been proclaimed and written that we might have as much hope as the Jews had therein, and so turn to the Lord, as these Ninevites did.  This for Jonah" (Page 23 of Volume Eight of  The Works of Thomas Goodwin ).  Goodwin is a master.  There is no doubt about that.  He stresses that the object of our faith is that of God's mercifulness toward us sinners.  His mercifulness is the foundation and pillar and of our faith.  It is in mercy where we beseech God to pardon our sins.  And it is the merciful in whom we Trust.

						   I think I will venture to post my thoughts regarding the literature I am reading.  These will be under the heading of " Readings Analysis ."  I'll post excerpts from the books and comment on them.  Some of these thoughts seem to be very profound and simple at the same time.  For that I greatly appreciate them.  I'll also critique the books I read under this heading.  The other two categories already created,  Readings  and  General Ramblings , will remain as they are; posts regarding what I'm reading, or want to read, or want to study and 'every day' thoughts such as this one.

						   Well, I started two books:  Justification Vindicated  by Robert Trail (Puritan paperback published by Banner of Truth) and Volume Eight ( Justifying Faith ) of  The Works of Thomas Goodwin  (twelve volumes in all--published by Tanski and Banner).  Justification Vindicated is about a controversy in the Presbyterian/Congregational world of the U.K. in the mid to late 17th century, specifically the antinomianism of Crisp.  Trail is attempting to point out the errors of antinomians and Arminians (or legalists, as they are called by the 17th century reformed), and show the biblical balance of what justification truly is (i.e. it is NOT lawlessness, but it is not legalism).  This is doctrinal and historical theological.  Thomas Goodwin, on the other hand, is expositing justifying faith in a much more timeless manner, so far only dealing with his errouneous contemporaries in a cursory manner.  However, Thomas Goodwin is not an "easy read."  The type-setting is small, which does not help one's reading the style of puritanism.  But, just like Shakespeare, after a few pages one's eye and mind becomes well acquainted with the language, grammar, structure, etc.  Still, it is cumbersome read, though a  necessity !  I think this book will be extremely beneficial both doctrinally and pastorally.  It's amazing how Goodwin is intertwining these high and lofty theology ideas and our use of them as mere believers in our Lord Jesus Christ.  The whole point of Goodwin is to apply these truths to the believer, rather than systematizing for the end of systematics.

						   I finished reading  The Doctrine of Justification  by James Buchanan, today.  It was one of many I've read in the past few weeks in a long line of justification-type books.  Previous to reading this book, I finished Berkouwer's  Faith and Justification , which is a very interesting philosophical and theological reflection of his contemporaries.  It's a great read for historical theology, but also good in the affirmation of justification by faith alone.  However, both Berkouwer and Buchanan are "dated" in the sense of the historical conversation one enters when reading their treatises.  Both are easy and quick reads, though.  in fact, reading Berkouwer in such a quick manner made me want to read his complete set of dogmatics.  Who knows, though.  I'd rather read the complete works of John Owen this summer.  I think I'll start on  Justification Vindicated  by Robert Trail, or  Justifying Faith  (Volume 8 of 12) by Thomas Goodwin, or volume two of  The Economy of the Covenants between God and Man  by Herman Witsius.  I really need to hit the Hebrew vocab and grammar, too.  Ugh... so many things to do and read, so little time!  And here I am online, posting a blog, when I need to be working!  I wonder if any great theologians were ever as I am regarding such things as discipline of study?  Did Machen, Edwards, Owen, Aquinas, Augustine, Calvin, and the like enjoy slacking off?  Did they procrastinate?  Any good book suggestions in the area of "faith" or "justification"?  I'm looking for something that describes the substance of faith, not the instrumentality of it.  Buchanan ventured a wee bit into it, but he didn't cover it in any satisfiable regard.  And by substance I do not mean the properties of which "faith" consists.  I'm definitely looking for something that compares and contrasts our justifying faith with Adam's and Christ's faith, which is logically a faith other than what we are required to have in order to be justified before God.  Anyone?

						   For some reason I have the idea that my first "blog" should be profound on one level or another.  Generally, I believe this blog page will be rather incumbered with high and lofty thoughts of the academia nature, but I would hate to make it as such all of the time.  Therefore, I will talk about my new kitten, "Guffman."  If one is familiar with Christopher Guest, who happens to be married to Jamie Lee Curtis, one knows of the great mocumentary movies in which he stars and for which he writes.  My kitten, who is an orange tabby, came into our home June 6, 2004 at six weeks of age.  After finding out he was a boy (which is NOT as easy as one might think!), my wife, Beth, named him "Guffman."  The name "Guffman" is an unseen, unknown character who does not appear in Christopher Guest's "Waiting for Guffman."  She named him Guffman on my behalf.  You see, the cat I got from our barn in Oklahoma, Jael (Yah-El: see Judges 4), disappeared one night a month ago.  I had Jael two years prior to moving to California in the summer of 2000.  Jael was  my  baby.  She was something else.  She had so much character and personality.  She would literally talk to me, though in cat language, not human.  She would lick my lips and give me kisses.  She would always shower with me and partake of ALL of my bathroom activities.  The cat followed me around like I was a dog, and she never slept anywhere but on my bed.  As I use to say, Jael also had battered wife syndrome.  Not to make light of such a horrible crime, but Jael LOVED for me to beat her roughly.  She would meow, purr, and come back for more and more.  My wife (who does not have battered wife syndrome, nor need to have it) became very attached to her as well.  Jael was a great family cat.  We looked forward to her growing old with us.  Most likely, Jael, who was able to go outside when we moved to our new house (in Marh of 2004), was eaten by coyotes.  I would explain to everyone the punishment I am inflicting upon the coyotes, but I would not want any proof provided in a court of law.  Let's just say that the sword of vengeance and judgment is falling upon them.  So, the new cat, Guffman, is now being trained and reared accordingly.  I'm seeing to it that he gets plenty of rough play and delicate cuddling.  It is quite fun warping a new kitten.  I have great hopes and expectations for his personality.  I think I do very well with animals, as my family can attest.  He has a lot of potential.

						   Mortification of Sin for the Believer  Mr. Owen, whom I have just read regarding the mortification of sin in the believer, is so practicle, wise, and prudent with his application of our personal duty, as well as that which consists of a true Christian's constitution.  One of the most helpful means by which we mortify sin, though seemingly obvious it may not be, is to (1) look to the law of God in guilt, but also (2) look to the work of Christ in guilt.  Yes, the proper use of the law is to drive us to Christ in dispair, knowing that we are forsaken and without any hope.  Yet, the believer also looks to the Cross of Christ in shame and guilt.  The Christians fixates his heart on the grace, love, mercy, torment, and pain undergone by Christ on the cross.  This only brings more shame to one's choice of sin in light of it.  How can we behold such suffering on our behalf and so contritely sin before God?  That seems more horrible than the law in many ways.  I'll quote some excerpts from Owen with his poetic language on this issue.

						   For those who do not know me, I am a huge Harley fan.  After several years of riding a Honda Shadow V-Twin (a good bike), I finally purchased a Harley.  It is a 2004 Roadking Classic with a metalic red/maroon paint.  A friend of mine,  urlLink Gene Cook , just brought his Harley (2004 Fatboy) to my store and showed me what he just purchased.  It is a beautiful bike.  The chrome is pretty.  The cutsom paint was well done.  And his pipes sound amazing.  I believe they are  urlLink Vance and Hines .  I'm still thinking about purchasing a true dual exhaust by  urlLink Rinehart .  Anyone own a Harley who can tell me their preferences?

						   In addition to the many other readings I am attempting to complete, I've started and almost finished Owen's Mortification of Sin ( Temptation and Sin: Volume Six  of  The Complete Works of John Owen ; pages 1-83).  Those who complain about the "accessibility" of the Puritans, given the style and grammar in which the Puritans write, really do need to learn how to read such works.  I liken it to Shakespeare.  In my undergraduate studies as a Theatre Arts major, I found Shakespeare difficult when first introduced to him as an actor, though I was familiar with him during my previous emphasis and bachelor degree major of English Literature.  However, after a few months of working with Shakespeare I became quite fluent and versed in his writings.  It isn't that I'm smarter than other people, or that one has to be intellectual to read Shakespeare.  It is simply a matter of practice, much like any other language (i.e. Greek, Hebrew, Latin, German, etc.).  One must be diligent in learning how the language is used.  I do wish others would read more of the puritans.

						   Several weeks ago I went  urlLink 'round and 'round with Mark Horne in a chat forum  regarding the nature of justifying faith (notitia, assensu, and fiducia) and its relation (if any) to our personal obedience to the Law of God (i.e. the first commandment).  You can review our discussion and exchange of ideas.  And, much to my gladness, Mr. Horne  urlLink has written a short, concise paper on this very issue .  I'm glad that he has written and expounded upon his position; showing that he believes indeed we Christians are justified by and through our personal obedience to, and exercise of, the law of God.  I certainly do hope I was a strong motivation and catalyst for such a reaction that will hopefully expose his theology for what it is: Arminian at best and Romanist at worst.

						   Man, I can never seem to get into good sleeping patterns/habits.  Who else struggles with this?  I know I'm tired.  I know I need the sleep.  I know I'll be "sorry" tomorrow.  Yet, I still cannot make my mind shut off in order to calm myself to sleep!  If it isn't theology (which it ALWAYS is), then it's my business, my schooling, my wife, my finances, etc.  My mind NEVER stops racing.  Anyone else have this problem?  And as soon as I sleep "normally" for a week, my body seems to be "all caught up" on the much needed sleeping schedule and it starts all over again.  Tonight I have taken my regular medication (for the never damage, which also makes one drowsy) and two Tylenol Sleep Aid pills.  It's been just over an hour and I can finally feel it start kicking in, thankfully.  I hope my previous theological post wasn't too incoherent.

						    Law and Gospel: Covenant Theology   Yes, I believe the law-gospel distinction and paradigm is the correct paradigm with which we view, read, and hear Scripture.  We hear of our condemnation in our personal works the law or our justification by faith alone in the person and work of Christ.  However, how does this apply, or better yet, how does reformed orthodoxy systematize this into the tri-covenantal schema of ( 1 ) covenant of works, ( 2 ) covenant of redemption, and ( 3 ) covenant of grace?  How does the law-gospel distinction relate to these covenants and to us?  How is it practical for us as Christians?  For any theology without the intention, aim, scope, end, and goal of furthering our growth in grace and knowledge and benefiting our comfort in Christ is of little consequence.  I believe "the law," as stated previously, is that which we are commanded to do by God for our justification; namely perfect and personal obedience to the law of God.  I see this in ( 1 ) the covenant of works.  We tell our congregations, our family, and ourselves that God demands this perfect obedience unto His moral law/will that we might enjoy Him forever and merit (yes, earn!) eternal life.  I believe "the gospel," as stated previously, is that which Christ Jesus did on our behalf; namely His perfect and personal obedience unto the law of God (a covenant of works between the Father and the Son).  I see this as ( 2 ) the covenant of redemption.  What of the covenant of grace?  In what relation does this stand between the law-gospel distinction?  What is the involvement of the covenant of grace between the covenant of works (our personal obedience to the law) and the covenant of redemption (Christ's personal obedience to the law)?  The covenant of grace is that covenant in which the elect are made partakers by grace alone, through faith alone, in Christ alone.  The "gospel," or the person and work of Christ, is preached unto the people through the various administrations of the covenant of grace (i.e. Abrahamic and New) so that people might obey the "law of faith" (Rom 3:27) or have the "obedience of faith" (Rom 1:5; 16:26).  "Faith," or the command to believe is NOT the gospel.  It is the means by which the gospel--the person and work of Christ--is embraced and obtained by each individual who obeys this command.  The covenant of grace does not impose the law of God as found in the Ten Commandments or Decalogue, but a "law of faith."  The condition of the covenant of grace is not obedience to the law of God in any form, but the obedience of faith alone in Christ Jesus.  The covenant of grace imposes and proclaims the law of faith for justification in the sole ground of Christ's active and passive obedience.  The covenant of works is " the law ."  The covenant of redemption is " the gospel ."  The covenant of grace is " faith ."  God commands obedience to the law of faith, not "the law" as defined above or as found in our condmenation.  Through our "obedience to faith," or trusting and resting in the person and work of Christ and promises thereof, one is justified.  Faith is the sole instrument of our justification.  It is the sole instrument of an individual entering into (and maintaining--for it is not maintained by any works, obedience, etc.) the covenant of grace.  Faith is not a work of "the law."  Rather, "faith" is a wholly other category with which Paul works: the obedience and law of faith.

						   Law and Gospel  It seems as if Federal Visionism, New Perspective on Paul, and Shepherdite theology revolves around the distinction (or lack thereof) of the  Law and Gospel .  What is  the law ?  What is  the gospel ?  I think the issue stems from an incorrect view of the law, which in turn distorts and corrupts the Protestant doctrine of justification by grace alone, through faith alone, and in Christ alone.  As James Buchanan argues:   "It may be safely affirmed that almost all the errors, which have prevailed on the subject of justification, may be traced ultimately to erroneous, or defective, views of the Law and Justice of God" ( The Doctrine of Justification  by James Buchanan; published by Banner of Truth Trust, page 268).   I believe that is as true today as it was in the 16th, 17th, 18th, and 19th centuries, though not necessarily true as to the various accidents in which the problems occur.  I believe many problems in today's controversies are due to the Law and Gospel distinction (or lack thereof).  Douglas Wilson says of the "law gospel distinction" that all of Scripture either comes to the individual as law or gospel, but never is there a mix between the two in Scripture ( urlLink see the Douglas Wilson Church Website in A Short Credo on Law and Gospel ).  Scripture is always either law or gospel.  The two do not comingle, as it were, to either the believer or unbeliever.  This, I believe, is one of the main problems of Federal Vision theology.  What is the law, properly speaking?  And what is the gospel, properly speaking?  I believe that the law and gospel paradigm is present all throughout Scripture, but that paradigm must be defined and explained.  I believe the law of God is that which God requires of man for righteousness and justification, namely perfect and personal obedience to that which God prescribes (i.e. the covenant of works between God and Adam, or the Mosaic Covenant as a typological republication of the covenant of works).  I believe the gospel is that work which Christ Jesus (God) performed as required by the Father and on behalf of the  elect during His earthly ministry as one born under the law (i.e. it is the covenant of redemption between the Father and the Son).  Therefore, I think the law is "the law" to both believers and unbelievers, and "the gospel" is that work which Christ Jesus did during his earthly ministry.  So, while the covenant of redemption is a covenant of works for Christ Jesus, it is the gospel proper for all of us.  The law and gospel are not relative depending on who hears it.  They are absolute categories that are either embraced or denied by individuals.  Regardless, though, the law is law and the gospel is gospel for either believers or unbelievers.  The gospel--Christ's person and work--is not the law to the unbeliever.  The law--our person obedience--is not gospel to the believer.  So, I believe the Pauline category of "law and gospel" (as framed in the Pauline doctrine and exposition in the covenant of works and covenant of redemption) stands firm for both elect and non-elect who hear it proclaimed.  If this can be settled, maybe some of the controversies regarding justification would subside?  However, until the law-gospel distinction is settled and understood, I fear the doctrine of justification will always be skewed by those federal visionist proponents.

						   Of course anyone within a confessional church (Westminster Standards, Three Forms of Unity, Savoy Declaration, and London Baptist Confession) knows of the controversy regarding Norman Shepherd, N.T. Wright, E.P. Sanders, J.D.G. Dunn, Douglas Wilson, etc.  So much  buzzing  is happening and it is hard to keep up with all of it.  However, I am trying to keep up with it.  I'm working through the  Auburn Avenue Theology: Pros and Cons  edited by Calvin Beizner and published by Knox Theological Seminary.  Although some of the articles/essays are interesting, so far (though I'm only on Peter Leithart's article) I don't see anything of interest.  I see problems, mind you, but nothing that piques my curiosity.  I know I have a lot of interest in the debates, but so far the "heart of the matter" doesn't seem to be displayed.  Maybe I need to read the whole thing to understand the nuances of this particular book (i.e. the direction, cases, points, etc.)?  Either way, though, I hope this year's OPC committee will get to the heart of the issue regarding justification.  I'm sure it will.  I'm very excited to see our own David van Drunen in the group.  Though I had hoped Steve Baugh (who I believe to be the foremost New Testament scholar in position at a North American school) would be appointed/voted onto the committee, I have no doubt that he will help the individuals in it.  I think the crucial question is:  Is our extraspective faith in Christ Jesus obedience to the moral law/will of God (as summed in the Decalogue)?   Steve Baugh seems the whole issue revolves around the mediatorship and surety aspect of Christ Jesus.  However, I think there is something undergirding even that question, namely the "obedience of faith" (Rom 1:5; 16:26) and "law of faith" (Rom 3:27).  This, for me, gets to the heart of the question.  Is our obedience to the the law, which is faith in Christ, the means and instrument of our justification?  Are we justified by our obedience to the law of God?  And, even more peculiar, are we justified by an obedience to the law that Christ and Adam themselves did not uphold (i.e. extraspective faith in the person and work of another)?  This is highly problematic.  I think the reformed position of (1) the covenant of works, (2) the covenant of redemption, and (3) covenant of grace needs to be improved upon regarding this question.  And I think there is a solution when thinking in those Pauline categories.

						   After getting know and hear William Lane Craig last year, I've been exposed to a greater idea of the knowledge of God.  I'm not saying the reformed concept of God does not honor his omniscience--the depth, width, and length of God's knowledge.  However, it wasn't until Bill Craig spoke about God's knowledge of all the possible worlds.  Now, I'm not advocating Middle Knowledge, or Molonism, but the idea did cause me to think of God's knowledge in a whole new light.  For that I am thankful.  The question regarding the logical order of God's foreknowledge and decree has always been a  difficult issue , especially for me.  I do believe God's foreknowledge and decree is coterminous, but to what degree and in what manner?  And what does one make of the free agency (not libertarian free will) of man in relation to God's foreknowledge and decree?  Can one say God decrees events in a manner in which he knows the person will choose "A" or "B"?  This way man's free agency is left in perfect condition and unadulterated, as some anti-calvinists might contend.  God, knowing all possible worlds, and all possible counter-factuals, decrees in a manner that free agents will necessarily choose according to God's will and plan, so that God's plan--from a mouse farting to Christ's crucifixion--will be fulfilled perfectly.  This does not "cure" the common accusation that God has decreed sin (for not even Molinists can escape such a charge), but it does enlighten man's free agency and moral responsibility in a way that most Calvinists don't seem argue.  So, God decrees events X, Y, and Z in order that Person A might choose option D, even though options C, D, and E were real and possible.  God, though, wanting the person to choose option D (whether it is brushing one's teeth, sinning, or performing a good work), decrees all events so that the person will necessarily and freely choose (as an Edwardsian free agent understanding) the option God desired.  To me this magnifies the knowledge of God as well as his involvement, all the while "protecting" and securing and clarifying man's responsibility.  I dunno... why not?  Anything wrong with that as an Augustinian, Calvinistic confessional man?

						   Another "heading" will be Family and Home, as is evident by the heading of this post.  Here I will discuss many things pertaining to my home and family life.  I will be not so personal as to embarrass my family, but will happily discuss many things.  Today I tried working in the yard.  However, my chronic headaches from permanent nerve damage in my left inner ear have incapacitated me far beyond being able to do at home today what I  needed  to do.  I have to put together a table saw, as well as arrange my garage (it's a mess!).  Mondays, in the months of June and July, are my days off from the  urlLink bookstore .  So I needed to get a lot done today.  My backyard is growing in nicely, but I have too many bear spots of dirt in which I cannot seem to grow any grass.  Because of the headaches, though, I just mowed, weed-eated, watered, did a few little things in the garage, etc.  It wasn't too exciting or fruitfull.  Our house is looking better and better.  Beth and I bought it in December (three bedroom, two-and-one-half baths--1450 square feet, etc.).  The yard is coming along, but there are many things I need to do in it.  After the grass is grown in this summer I'll work on putting the sprinkler system in the yard, though one is already in our slope.  The birds, squirrels, and rabbits all seem to love the constant feed we put out in the back yard.  At any given moment during the day there are twenty birds (finches, doves, humming birds, sparrows, orioles, etc.) in our back yard.  It is very relaxing to look at these birds as they sing and eat.

						   Mr. Mark Horne has continued in his bid for our justification through our work of the law (see  urlLink below ).  In his  urlLink recent attempt  at claiming subscription to the Westminster Confession of Faith by stating one is justified by one's work of the law, faith, he posts a link to an interesting  urlLink website and article .  It is this article used by Mr. Horne as "proof" that the Mosaic Covenant was not a republication of a covenant of works.  I read the article down to the fourth paragraph, which began by stating:  But a republication of the covenant of works would mean that we are under obligation to be perfectly and perpetually obedient in order to inherit glory. That simply is not true.   Now, I assume Mr. Horne is trying to argue against men such as Meredith Kline, Michael Horton, Steve Baugh, Bryan Estelle, John Owen, Herman Witsius, etc., when referring to the Mosaic Covenant as not being a "republication of the covenant of works."  That is how I understood the counter-position of Mr. Horne.  Maybe I assume too much, though?  Anyway, it was this part of the paper that made me stop reading.  No covenantal theologian states the Mosaic Covenant of works, as a republication of the Adamic covenant of works, was unto glory.  Firstly, such theologians state it is a typological republication of the covenant of works, not  THE  original Adamic covenant of works made in prelapsarian redemptive-history.  It is a republication of what natural and moral laws to which Adam was to be obedient, but NOT for the same  promises .  It is the same moral law, but for promises that were typological of Adam's by his personal, perfect obedience and merit, and ours through Christ's personal, perfect obedience and merit as it is imputed unto by faith alone (faith that is not an obedience to this covenant of works, lest we are justified through our obedience to the law).  No covenant theologian who argues the Mosaic Covenant is a republication of the covenant of works believes what Mr. Horne states they believe: To claim that one might inherit life by keeping the moral law perfectly is to adopt the pelagian idea that we are not from conception, already guily and corrupt in God's site. The Mosaic law is not a pelagian covenant.   It is hard to understand why Mr. Horne disagrees with a strawman and not the actual theological ideas as those against whom I assume (incorrectly?) he is attempting to argue.

						   I decided to create yet one more category for this blog entitled, "Antinomianism."  I really do hope I can keep the blog titles to a minimum.  However, I believe this is a good one.  In this I will speak about all those nasty "vices" in which a Christian may be grasped; such as liquors, beers, (alcohol in general), cigars, (tobacco in general), night-life activity, fine pubs, etc.  Tonight, since my sweet Beth is still away on the east coast, I bought more cigars to find a "decent" and "cheap" one I can purchase in larger quantity to fill my humidor.  You see, I smoke cigars so rarely because I only like the expensive AVO's, Monte Cristo's, Dunhills, etc.  I cannot afford to smoke as often as I would like to because of the cost.  Who can afford $10.00 and $15.00 cigars?  I certainly cannot... yet!  So, I've been purchasing cigars from a smoke shop in Escondido (which has a NICE walk-in humidor) ranging in price from $8.00 to $4.00.  If I buy a cigar in a shop for $8.00, that means I can buy it online in a box of twenty-five for at least $5.00 a cigar, and maybe less!  The first few times trying several cigars in that price range I almost puked.  They were horrible!  HOWEVER, I have now found a great cigar that is the cheapest I've purchased so far at $3.95 per cigar.  It is a Don Thomas short.  It is the PERFECT cigar to buy by the box-load.  The taste and aroma are similar to my favorite Monte's and such.  I tested the cigar with my single malt, twelve-year aged Glenmorangie Port Wood Finishd Scotch.  I must say it passes the test with flying colors!  I will now search for this Don Thomas cigar at R.J. Reynolds and the likes.  It is worth it and then some.

						   Justifying Faith in the First Commandment? Type and Antitype in the Mosaic Exodus  Some thoughts I've had regarding the first commandment and its relation to commanding justifying faith are ready to be "worked through" on this blog and further in my mind.  I'm a big type-antitype kind of guy.  Vos' understanding of this theology has always piqued my curiosity.  Men such as Ricki Watts and Pao, in their works pertaining to the Isaianic New Exodus in Mark and Acts (respectively), have also caused me to give pause to the discussion of faith in the first commandment.  The exodus of Israel from Egypt unto the promised land was a type and shadow of Christ leading the victorious exodus of his people out from slavery and bondage of sin.  So, I thought I would look at the Exodus and claims of the demands of the first commandment in this partiuclar light.  I believe, because of the typology of the Exodus, that justifying faith is not commanded by the first commandment.  If one looks at the "exodus" of individual souls, as compared to the corporate exodus of Israel, one will note that both exoduses follow the ordo salutis in a peculiar manner, or at least should be seen as such individually (corporately is another issue, but not one that is unrelated).  The exodus of Israel is the exodus each individual walks through in their lives.  We, personally, are in salvery and bondage to our sin and Satan.  Christ, though, victoriously triumphant against the strong man, Satan (i.e. Pharaoh), has set us free.  We are regenerated and given faith.  At this point, like the Exodus of the Old Testament, God declares (once saving us from bondage and slavery) that we are his people and he is our God.  This presupposes faith in our spiritual exodus as revealed in the New Testament.  God is our God because of our faith.  The type of the exodus, as pertaining to the first commandment, presupposes a justifying faith, or redemption from bondage and slavery of sin.  We are delivered already (and there is a not yet aspect to the Exodus, too, specifically entering the land of Canaan, or heaven) by God, and we are given faith.  Therefore, God declares to us that he is our God.  The exodus and freedom of Israel is a type of our salvation through faith alone.  God, then, being our God through faith alone, commands of us to walk in his ways in manner more peculiar and special than those same commands binding all of mankind.  The preamble of the first commandment and the typology of the exodus, to this author, presupposes justifying faith when commanded to obey the law of God.  Justifying faith, then, is something other than obedience to the moral law of God.  These are just some thoughts.

						   My wife and I saw Spiderman Two tonight.  We caught the 5:45 matinee.  The movie was awesome!  I will not go into details, or positive and negative criticism, in order to keep from spoiling the movie for anyone else.  I will say if one is a Spidy fan it is a must see.  I grew up collecting "The Amazing Tales of," "The Web of," "Spectacular," and every other Spiderman comic book.  After the movie I took my wife the San Diego airport.  She is visiting her family in Cape Cod, who is celebrating her mother's parent's fiftieth wedding anniversary.  I was unable to go because of work and finances.  I come home at 10:20 PM from the airport and the freaking cable is out!  So, I put in one of movies, Snatch, and am trying to enjoy it without the presence of my wife.  What I miss about watching movies with my wife is looking over at each other during certain moments.  You know, when something is unusually clever, funny, stupid, ironic, interesting, scary, etc., we both look at each other and give appropriate looks.  Beth doesn't return until Tuesday night!  Last time we were separated I had to sleep with a body-pillow next to me in order to cuddle with what is usually my wife.  I wasn't a cuddler when we were married, or any time prior to that, but she has effectively trained me so that I can ONLY fall asleep while cuddling with her.  It will prove difficult these next few nights, but I know the trip will be worth it for her.  I'm glad that she could go and celebrate with her family.

						   PDuggie  urlLink wrote :   Couldn't someone belibe that justifying faith is in fact, obedient to a command of god (moral law), but not, for that reason be justifying?  A romanist might claim both: that the reason the faith is an instrument of jsutification is that the faith is considered by God as a de facto meritorious work.  I don't hear Mark claiming this, merely *noting*, that, hey: God tells us to have faith so having faith is aa species of obedience to a command.   First of all, thank you for the comment.  Second of all, I feel a little silly addressing this to PDuggie, as if you were a brother of P-Diddy.  :)  Third of all, regarding your comment, I do think faith is an obedience to one of God's commands.  But I do not think that faith is an obedience to the commands of God as pertaining to the works of the law (or obedience to the law of God).  I think someone could apprehend your first paragraph in such a manner, but I do believe it is biblically and logically untenable.  Yes, Mark is not necessarily using the same vocabulary used by the Roman Catholic, as is possibily formulated by Rome in your second paragraph in the comment.  However, this does not mean the two are not equivalent in crucial areas and conclusions.  My concern, PDuggie, is the distinction Paul deliberately makes is lost when one states our justifying faith is a "work of the law" (i.e. obedience to the moral law).  Faith is something we actively do, which is a relinquishing of ourselves and resting in the work of another.  I agree that faith is an obedience to God's command.  See my post on "Law and Gospel: Covenant Theology."  However, one cannot say our justifying faith is obedience to the command of the law, which is what Paul contrasts with faith.  While Mark notes, as do I, that faith is an obedience to the command of God, to what command is one being obedient?  How is "faith" not "faithfulness" if it is a work of the law (i.e. something we are commanded to do in the law)?  Is it merely vocabulary?  I do not think so, but I pray it is.  I find a lot of troubles do occur over vocabulary (i.e. "grace" before the fall--what is meant by "grace"?).  I do believe that this is where Protestantism, especially Reformed churches, must start doing work.  The questions posed by NPP, Shepherd, and Federal Vision proponets are GOOD questions.  They are wrestling, in some places, in not many, with difficulties that have not been codified by the Reformed and Protestant traditions.  But, like Horton states, their "cure is worse than the disease."  They are the right questions looking at the right difficulties, but they must be answered differently.  I do not believe Protestantism has faced such intriguing questions, which will spur the holy catholic church, including the reformed churches, toward a concise understanding (hopefully!).  I simply believe the understanding must come in this area: (1) what is faith and (2) to what command is the active believing obedient?  Let me just say that, because of recent controversies, any historical work on this issue (i.e. as by Ursinus in the Heidelberg Commentary, which I will post forthcoming) must be examined in light of the recent problems, meaning that the past explanations may be well invalid.  This is where the church, in my opinion, needs to go in relation to these questions.

						   Recently, Douglas Wilson has posted numerous remarks regarding  urlLink "The Foolishness of the Gospel: Covenant and Justification Under Attack."   The posts are entitled, "Yelling at My Windshield, Part __."  You may visit  urlLink Doug Wilson's blog  to read these.  Also, Mark Horne has contributed to the discussion about the conference  urlLink here .  Here is the response from the accused, Dr. Hywel Jones:   Here are a few comments for clarification which can be verified from the tape of the address.  (1) The offending words are part of a single sentence in my script.  (2) The other part of the sentence was/is a question.  (3) The words are therefore to be understood in the light of that question which is 'What role does justification play in sanctification...?  (4) Therefore they are not a definition of justification which is how Wilson construed them, but a description of how justification impacts sanctification. I had given notice that our consideration was going to proceed along the lines of personal rather than doctrinal inquiry because of the old and 'new' charge that sola fide cuts the nerve of a pursuit of holiness. The doctrinal definitions are laid down in Our Testimony and were endorsed in an earlier paragraph of the address.  (5) My statement does not need to be 'edited back into orthodoxy' as Wilson suggests. It just needs to be read in its context.  HRJ

						   It appears as if it was assumed I called Mark Horne (1) an Arminian at best and (2) a Romanist at worst.  Well, let me make it clear that I stated: "expose his  theology  [in the paper] for what it is: Arminian at best and Romanist at worst."  I inserted "in the paper" for clarification.  His theology regarding our justifying faith being an obedience to the moral law of God is historically Arminian and Roman Catholic.  But, as stated previously, I stipulate his conclusions and those of Arminians and Roman Catholics may very well be based upon different presuppositions.  For instance, the Arminian believed in a prevenient grace that enabled the person to perform the good work of faith (obedience to the law) with such a helping grace.  Roman Catholics believe faith working through love is a gospel obedience (faith being a work in and of itself) that produces justification.  Now, these are oversimplified for brevity.  It is also true that some replace the performance of the decalogue with a "new obedience" that is faith.  Patrick Buchanan discusses many of these issues in the varying views of justification.  I did not state Mark Horne is an Arminian or a Roman Catholic, as badly as some may wish I would.  I stated his theology (specifically pertaining to faith and the obedience to the law) is Arminian and Roman Catholic.   If we are justified through faith, and faith is an obedience to the law of God, then we are justified through our work of the law.   It is that simple.  Can this not be understood?  Are we justified through/by our obedience to the works of the law?  When Paul speaks of works of the Law (i.e. the Mosaic Covenant that contains the Decalogue), and that we are not justified by/through them, does he mean every work of the law except for faith, which is obedience to the first commandment?  Those who teach our justifying faith is obedience to the law must redefine (as NPP does?) Paul's use of "the law" in contradistinction to "faith."  If I stand against four hundred years of reformed orthodoxy (or two thousand years of the holy catholic church) by stating we are not justified through our obedience to the law, which includes this type of faith that is obedience, so be it.  When Paul states we are not justified by the works of the law and distinguishes "faith" to "the law," then I am left with a simple conclusion: the faith through which we are justified is not a work of the law.  Why not simple state: WE ARE JUSTIFIED THROUGH OUR OBEDIENCE TO THE LAW.

						   Another comment made by Matthew is of worthy note regarding my  urlLink Theology blog on Mark Horne's essay .  Matthew has written an  urlLink interesting critique  of Mr. Horne's essay on  urlLink Faith Commanded by the Moral Law of God .  I've read the critique once, and it definitely needs a second glance, but I do believe most of what Matthew notes is worthy of pause and reflection.

						   I've decided to create another new category entitled, "Comments."  These labeled threads will address particular comments left by visitors of this site in order to clarify and discuss an issue.  Under a  urlLink Theology thread , specifically that pertaining to Mark Horne's  urlLink paper on the first commandment , a man named Michael left the following post:   Interesting hierarchy of being in your kingdom. Reminds me of a prayer once uttered by the Tannaic rabbis (who you would presumably condemn as legalistic Pharisees.)  Here, "Thank you, Adonai, for not making me a Gentile, a woman, or a dog" becomes "Thank you, Lord, for not making me a neo-legalist, an Arminian, or a Romanist."  Labeling Rev. Hornes with either moniker is absurd and foolish. Both accusations produce more heat than light and I would be interested to know if you have any appreciation of the complexity of opinions found within the Arminian and Roman Catholic communions anyway.   Firstly, I am gracious that God has enlightened my heart and soul toward Calvinism and the Reformed Faith.  I am thankful that God has not abandoned me, which would have been perfectly just, holy, and good.  I am thankful that God has shown me truths that He, for some reason, has not shown others.  Who would not be thankful?  Who would not praise Him for His calling and election of such a sinner?  Who would not praise God for saving and illuminating a sinful man such as myself?  Who would not praise and adore God for such a grace as that?  I am thankful that the Lord has not left me in Arminianism.  I am thankful that the Lord has not forsaken me to the false church, the whore of Satan, the synagogue of the antichrist known as Rome.  It is clear to me that people should be thankful for such an act of God's grace.  Do not confuse my thankfulness in such a way for that of the Pharisees.  For they are not the same.  Secondly, it is not foolish to label Mr. Horne in such a manner.  One need only read the Canons of Dordt and read what Arminians thought of faith as an obedience.  They may arrive to the same conclusion based on different foundations and premises, but they are the same nonetheless.  I do not think Mr. Horne is Arminian or Roman Catholic.  I think his teachings--as pointed out--are Arminian and Roman Catholic.  His views  are  at best Arminian and at worst Roman Catholic.  Yes, I realize the complexities of Arminian and Roman Catholic theology.  I would be a fool to say I knew both systems as one ought, or as many do.  I would be a fool to say they are simplistic, ill prepared, under-developed, or not well thought through.  They are large systems that have hundreds and thousands of facets supporting, under-girding, and stemming from all areas.  It is not "cut and dry."  However, this does not necessitate Horne's views and conclusions are different than the Arminian or Romanist theologian.  Again, they may arrive to a conclusion on different supositions.  But one must ask, "Can Horne's supposistions be reformed if he arrives at a non-reformed conclusion?"  Certainly, he can be inconsistent and make wrong conclusions about right theology, as I believe (and do others) John Murray was with his view of the "creational covenant."  Norman Shepherd has taken Murray to Murray's logical end, but Murray would never deny imputation as does Shepherd.  Murray was inconsistent as we all are.  Maybe Horne has the right theology and makes a wrong conclusion?  Maybe Horne has bad theology and has come to its logical conclusion.  Only time will tell as the PCA "cleans house" of those doctrines in disagreement with the standards of the Westminster Standards.  Regardless, though, Mr. Horne's conclusion is as I've stated, if one is familiar with the Arminian and Roman Catholic view of faith.  Lastly, all of this is to say that your comment on the post has misunderstood the intention, scope, and goal of the post.

						   Jeremiah 32:37-44 states:    37  "Behold, I will gather them out of all the lands to which I have driven them in My anger, in My wrath and in great indignation; and I will bring them back to this place and make them dwell in safety.  38  "They shall be My people, and I will be their God;  39  and I will give them one heart and one way, that they may fear Me always,  for their own good and for the good of their children after them .  40  "I will make an everlasting covenant with them that I will not turn away from them, to do them good; and I will put the fear of Me in their hearts so that they will not turn away from Me.  41  "I will rejoice over them to do them good and will faithfully plant them in this land with all My heart and with all My soul.  42  "For thus says the LORD, 'Just as I brought all this great disaster on this people, so I am going to bring on them all the good that I am promising them.  43  'Fields will be bought in this land of which you say, "It is a desolation, without man or beast; it is given into the hand of the Chaldeans."  44  'Men will buy fields for money, sign and seal deeds, and call in witnesses in the land of Benjamin, in the environs of Jerusalem, in the cities of Judah, in the cities of the hill country, in the cities of the lowland and in the cities of the Negev; for I will restore their fortunes,' declares the LORD."   Now, this is pertaining to the New Covenant, which was introduced in Jeremiah 31:31-34.  So, what does a Reformed (covenantal) Baptist make of the inclusion of blessings unto the children in verse thirty-nine?  I asked a prominent Reformed Baptist scholar if he was familiar with, or did any work with this passage of Scripture.  He had not.  It seems as if he was not "familiar" with this passage, or had not done any work in it.

						   I wasn't sure under what heading to list this particular post.&nbsp; I was visiting  urlLink a blog  today (one of those I frequent daily)&nbsp;and noticed  urlLink the latest entry  was in response to  urlLink my most current blog .&nbsp; I think the person writing&nbsp;about me is&nbsp;under the assumption that I was addressing he (or those with whom he is seemingly personally and intimately acquainted) in my blog regarding the efficacy of baptism.&nbsp; I would like to address some points addressed about my particular blog at hand.  &nbsp;  Firstly:  &nbsp;  The title of the blog about which I'm commenting is, "Doing Analysis by Gossip."&nbsp; I assume&nbsp;"Reverend" Horne is speaking about the manner in which I do analysis, which is by means of listening to, reporting upon, and continuing in the sin of gossip.&nbsp; Well, the addage about what happens when one is to "ass-u-me" is clearly prophetically fulfilled with both of us at this point, if indeed I am being accused of sharing in "gossip."&nbsp; I would ask him, but I cannot find a means of "commenting"&nbsp;on his blog.&nbsp; I certainly look like an ass because it appears as if I'm promoting the sin of gossip, or am reporting from sinful gossip.&nbsp; I do pray he would ask me about such things, or dialogue with me, as we have in the past in an chat forum.&nbsp; He may feel free to email me at  urlLink bradfordmyers@cox.net .  &nbsp;  Secondly:  " urlLink Supposedly  someone claims baptism is efficacious apart from faith. This second-hand information is linked in some way to the New Perspective. I assume the writer is actually targeting "the Federal Vision" because nothing coming out of the New Perspective even addresses the issue."&nbsp;  Yes, someone with whom I was speaking this past week did claim that baptism was efficacious regardless of faith.&nbsp; He adheres to this, as he says, because he is "more or less supporter of NPP."&nbsp; I am not saying--nor did I say--this was a characteristic of NPP supporters.&nbsp;&nbsp;And it&nbsp;wasn't second-hand information.&nbsp; The person about whom I was speaking in my post told me first-hand what he believed.&nbsp; I am not actually targeting "Federal Vision."&nbsp; For instance, in reading  urlLink Douglas Wilson's  "A Short Credo on Baptism," one can find that he does indeed state: "The blessings [of baptism] are appropriated by faith."&nbsp; I would discuss other things in his  Credo , but that is neither here, nor there.  &nbsp;  Thirdly:   First, baptism objectively admits a person into the visible church whether they are elect or reprobate, and therefore whether or not they genuinely trust God in the Gospel.  Secondly, there are now reams of columns, essays, articles, and mp3 recorded sermons, and lectures available and no one claims that baptism saves without faith. In fact, such an idea is totally denied.&nbsp;   I would go further than this, even.&nbsp; I would say baptism is the means by which one enters in the New Covenant (the New Covenant is not to be confused with or equated to the Covenant of Grace).&nbsp; I believe one enters into the New Covenant (not to be confused with or equated to the Covenant of Grace) through baptism; regardless of "whether or not they genuinely trust God in the Gospel."&nbsp; As for his second protest, I would like to probe the issue regarding how baptism does save  with  faith.&nbsp; Certainly, I embrace Peter's language in 1 Peter 2:18ff.&nbsp; I thrive off of it.&nbsp; I can proclaim from the roof-tops that our baptism "now saves us" (present active indicative).&nbsp; But what does that mean when I say it?&nbsp; What does it mean with NPP says it?&nbsp; What does it mean when Shepherd says it?&nbsp; What does it mean when Federal Visionists say it?&nbsp; I would be willing to bet my answer&nbsp;to "what does that mean" would be&nbsp;the "which one of these is not like the others" answer.&nbsp; Maybe we are having difficulty with the language of "efficacious"?&nbsp; I would be willing to posit that idea. &nbsp;  And as for the quote from the Westminster Catechsim Q&amp;A 91, after seeing what the author of the protesting blog has done and taught with the catechism in other areas (see his understanding of Q&amp;A 153 in  urlLink this article , as well as his use of Q&amp;A 153 in his  urlLink Credo on Justification ), I have no idea what his use of the catechism means.&nbsp; I wouldn't even begin to assume I know what he means when using the Catechism, as neither should any other person who adheres to the Westminster Standards.  &nbsp;  All of this is to say: MY BLOG IN QUESTION ISN'T ABOUT YOU OR YOUR CREDENDA AGENDA/CANON PRESS&nbsp;BUDDIES, MARK HORNE.

						   A conversation ensued between a "more or less supporter of NPP" and me regarding the objectivity of baptism regardless of personal faith ever being present in the person baptized.  It seems as if I've heard this numerous times from such NPP sympathizers.  In this latest conversation, this person told me that baptism was efficacious regardless of faith ever being present.  I guess we must define "efficacious" when used in such a way.  Are we equivocating when speaking of the efficacy of the sacrament for the reprobate and elect?  I do not know.  All I do know is that one absolutely cannot claim the heritage and teachings of John Calvin if one asserts baptism is efficacious without faith.  The conversation revolved around Calvin's view of the efficacy of baptism from the Geneva Catechism (the Latin translation of 1545).  I was somewhat unfamiliar with the catechism, but am thankful I was forced to review it to actually see what Calvin DID teach regarding the objectivity of baptism in relation to the efficacy of it from the Gevena Catechism.  It is overwhelmingly clear John Calvin taught baptism was only efficacious if accompanied by faith, but that faith could either precede or follow the sacrament for efficacy.  Either way, though, if faith--before or after the adminstration of the sacrament--was not possessed by the person, then baptism was of NO value or efficacy in relation to "union with Christ."  The 1545 Latin version translated into English can be found  urlLink here .  There is a version wherein the questions and answers are numbered, rather than labeled "Master" and "Student," denoting who is asking and who is answering.  That version can be found  urlLink here .  Either of these are good resources for further studies, devotions, reflections, and the like.  Here are some examples of Calvin's view of the efficacy of the sacraments.  What must ALSO be noted is Calvin's clear distinction between the sign, the thing signified, and the power of God using the instrument of the sacraments.  The sign is never the thing signified, and the thing signified is only present through the sign if faith is present in the person.   Master . - But what confidence can there be in the sacraments as a means of establishing the conscience, and what certain security can be conceived from things which the good and bad use indiscriminately?    Scholar . - Although the wicked, so to speak, annihilate the gifts of God offered in the sacraments in so far as regards themselves, they do not thereby deprive the sacraments of their nature and virtue.    Master . - How, then, and when does the effect follow the use of the sacraments?    Scholar . - When we receive them in faith, seeking Christ alone and his grace in them.    Master . - Why do you say that Christ is to be sought in them?    Scholar . - I mean that we are not to cleave to the visible signs so as to seek salvation from them, or imagine that the power of conferring grace is either fixed or included in them, but rather that the sign is to be used as a help, by which, when seeking salvation and complete felicity, we are pointed directly to Christ.    Master . - Seeing that faith is requisite for the use of them, how do you say that they are given us to confirm our faith, to make us more certain of the promises of God?    Scholar . - It is by no means sufficient that faith is once begun in us. It must be nourished continually, and increase more and more every day. To nourish, strengthen, and advance it, the Lord instituted the sacraments. This indeed Paul intimates, when he says that they have the effect of sealing the promises of God. (Rom. iv. 11.)    Master . - But do you attribute nothing more to the water than that it is a figure of ablution?    Scholar . - I understand it to be a figure, but still so that the reality is annexed to it; for God does not disappoint us when he promises us his gifts. Accordingly, it is certain that both pardon of sins and newness of life are offered to us in baptism, and received by us.    Master . - Is this grace bestowed on all indiscriminately?    Scholar . - Many precluding its entrance by their depravity, make it void to themselves. Hence the benefit extends to believers only, and yet the Sacrament loses nothing of its nature.   Calvin's exposition and defense of infant baptism, too, requires faith in order for any baptism of an infant to be efficacious.  Let those who claim baptism is efficacious to believers and non-believers (in the same way, or in any way at all) be assured that they do not adhere to the historically reformed position of baptism; the sign and seal; the sign and the thing signified; or the likes.  As long as those who argue for a view contrary to Calvin and the reformed admit it is contrary, I am a happy man.  Let those who hold such a view contrary to Calvin, who claim Calvin, be forgiven of their lies and blatantly false misrepresentations.

						   Yesterday, a nice shipment of my new-favorite cigars arrived.&nbsp; Though I love Don Thomas as a cheap (i.e. $3-$4 a pop) cigar, I have now gone to Davedoff's Private Stock.&nbsp; I got some nice five-inch, fifty-gauge cigars for $50.00.&nbsp; The seven-inch, forty-eight gauge cigars, though, are lighter and taste better.  Also, I'm really enjoying the nice, peety flavor of LaFroig single-malt.&nbsp; Yummy!

						   In a fairly  urlLink recent blog , Douglas Wilson raises what I consider to be the most important questions regarding the development and codification of covenant theology.&nbsp; However, I believe--as do many others who affirm the valid questions asked by them--the answers provided by the Federal Visionists lead reformed theology in an erroneous and dangerous direction.&nbsp; Here is Mr. Wilson's brief blog:  I want to raise a question I have asked before, only in different terms. According to our discussion partners, within the Covenant of Grace does the Covenant of Works have any members? Are the elect simultaneously members of both covenants? If members of both, please explain. No man can have two masters. If of one only, then why do the residual terms of the covenant we are not member of have any force or authority at all, even as directions for living?  These questions regarding the federal theology of historically reformed theology (covenant of works in Adam; covenant of grace in Christ) are what have prompted myself to "nuance," or even "redefine" certain terms and categories within covenant theology.&nbsp; I think these questions--and the lack of consistent answers provided by historical covenant theology--are what must be addressed.&nbsp; These questions looming over covenant theology (especially with paedobaptists) will lead unto Federal Vision if not considered and reexamined.&nbsp; Allow me to answer these questions. &nbsp;  "[W]ithin the Covenant of Grace does the Covenant of Works have any members?"  &nbsp; No, those who are within the covenant of grace are not within the covenant of works.&nbsp; The covenant of works' federal head is Adam.&nbsp; We are in Adam by virtue of being condemned.&nbsp; We enter into the covenant of grace through faith alone.&nbsp; Upon entering into the covenant of grace, Jesus Christ becomes the federal head of that person.&nbsp; The covenant of works and covenant of grace stand diametrically opposed to one another.&nbsp; One is either in the covenant of works in Adam, standing condemned before God dead in their sins, or one is in the covenant of grace in Christ, standing justified before God righteous in Christ. &nbsp;  "Are the elect simultaneously members of both covenants?"  &nbsp; No, the elect are either in the covenant of works in Adam prior to regeneration and the gift of faith, or in the covenant of grace in Christ upon and after regeneration and the gift of faith. &nbsp;  "If of one only, then why do the residual terms of the covenant we are not member of have any force or authority at all, even as directions for living?"  &nbsp; This question assumes one leaves one covenant (works) for another (grace).&nbsp; I do not believe Mr. Wilson is speaking about going from the covenant of grace unto the covenant of works (which is a question most paedobaptist covenant theologians cannot answer with any satisfaction).&nbsp; However, the "residual terms of the covenant" of works, that covenant of which members of the covenant of grace are no longer a part, still plague those in the covenant of grace in very specific manners.&nbsp; The curse of the covenant of works takes its toll on all people due to the corrupt nature of man.&nbsp; This is  already  destroyed in Christ, but  not yet  completely until the consummation of the heavens and earth (i.e. glorification and the recreation of the universe).&nbsp; Those in the covenant of grace still die, become ill, sin, etc., but such will not be the case after death and the resurrection.&nbsp; The covenant of works had the terms of blessings and curses.&nbsp; We still experience the curses, and in Christ do in part and will fully experience the blessings in the eschaton.&nbsp; The covenant of works does have force and authority regarding directions for living.&nbsp; This is the third use of the law.&nbsp; Though we are no longer condemned by the law, being free from its curse and demise, we are still bound to be obedient the law, though not under the same terms as the covenant of works (personal, perpetual obedience for everlasting life). &nbsp; Mr. Wilson is asking the right questions.&nbsp; And from these, there are many more questions and answers to be provided.&nbsp; It is a shame, though, that such questions are answered by the Federal Visionists in such a way to deviate from reformed orthodoxy in many areas.&nbsp; These are great questions, but, unfortunately, the answers provided by Federal Visionism are fallicious.&nbsp; And until paedobaptist covenant theologians can answer such questions with any degree of satisfaction, which I do not believe they can or do as of yet, such horrid answers provided by the Federal Visionists will continue to grow in strength.

						   The following comments and further reflection upon them is found  urlLink here .  However, I am going to put them all on this post.     pduggie said... I think Wilson may have been interacting with Hortons article in MR to the effect that when we see that the torah gives commands that promise some kind of inherited blessing as a result of obedience to those commands, that demonstrates that the Torah is a typical republication of the Covenant of Works. But since Reformed theology has usually affirmed that the Torah is still a rule for living in the covenant of Grace, this would seem to be impossible for if we're under the CoG, we can hardly be bound to the CoW.      W.B. Myers said... "I think Wilson may have been interacting with Hortons article in MR to the effect that when we see that the torah gives commands that promise some kind of inherited blessing as a result of obedience to those commands, that demonstrates that the Torah is a typical republication of the Covenant of Works. But since Reformed theology has usually affirmed that the Torah is still a rule for living in the covenant of Grace, this would seem to be impossible for if we're under the CoG, we can hardly be bound to the CoW."The difference is "why" we are obedient to the commands of the COW. Is it to inherit the blessings resulting in our obedience? Or is it because it is the express moral will of God, and we do it out of grattitude. No reformed theologian states that in our freedom from the covenant of works we are no longer bound by the morality of it, but that we are free from the condemnation of it. So, while the law is a typological covenant of works, we are still bound by it in the covenant of grace. One is performed out of obligation for a reward, the other is performed out of gratitude for what has been merited on our behalf.So, while we are not obligated to uphold the COW for a reward, we are obligated to uphold the law of God (which is used in the COW and COG--as per the three uses of the law taught by Calvin and Luther) in gratitude--hence the guilt, grace, and gratitude of Ursinus and the Heidelberg.    pduggie said... Well then I'm still left wondering, because it seems to me there are plenty of examples of the new covenant laying out an offer of reward for some kind of obedience.I can think of Paul's words to children, to Honor their father and their mother that their days may be long, which he says is the first commandment with promise, and John 15:10, where Jesus says if we obey him, we will remain in his love. Heb 10: 35-36 says that when we have done the will of God we will be richly rewarded.I'm not very comfortable looking at all these texts that seem to be motivating me to obedience through the promise of a reward, and claim that I should eschew the offered reward in the interests of only obeying out of gratitude (which ultimately, is the will of God for our obedience too)But then we're still left with a curious continuity between the way obedience is treated in both the new covenant and the older covenants.    Let me state that there are rewards for us who obey the moral will and law of God.  As noted, the first commandment with a promise is to honor/obey your parent that you might live a long life (Eph 6:1-3).  But the promise upon obedience is not the reward of the CoG, namely eternal life and salvation.  I beleive Hebrews 10:35, 36 is not talking about reward based upon obedience to the moral will of God, but the "obedience of faith."  I believe the obedience of faith is epexigetical, or that our faith (trusting and resting in Christ) is the obedience commanded of the New Covenant.  Remember, I also distinguish between the "obedience of faith" and "obedience to the works of the law," as does Calvin (see his commentary on Romand 3:27).  Faith is not a work of the law, or obedience to the Ten Commandments.  The "confidence" about which the author of Hebrews (who I call "Not Paul") is that which is our assurance in the finished work of Jesus Christ, or faith.  It is through faith alone that we will receive the reward of eternal life.  It is faith alone that meets the obligations of the New Covenant.  I believe Hebrews goes out of its way to show this difference between the Old (Mosaic) and New Covenant.  The "endurance" spoken of in Heb 10:36 is persevering in faith in Christ, who is the fulfillment of the Old Covenant (the Old Covenant being that to which the audience of Hebrews was contemplating turning).  We "endure" through life through faith alone, which receives the reward.  Performing this "will of God" is performing the conditions of the New Covenant: faith alone.  One endures the trials and tribulations, not turning from Christ to the law of God, but continually living a life of faith.  As for John 15:10, this is a more "difficult" verse for me, personally.  On must also decide about whom this passage is speaking.  Is this passage speaking about believers and unbelievers in Christ?  Of is this passage speaking about believers--who will never go to hell--who will be "judged," not "condemned"?  Though I am inclined to think this is speaking of those "in Christ" through baptism, or members of the New Covenant (i.e. Judas Iscariot being the prime and contextual reference for being taken away/off by the Father), I would not say our remaining is based upon our obedience, but that our obedience (or lack thereof) reveals those who truly do and do not believe.  Before one jumps to this text, we must ask what it is to "abide" in Christ.  For it is this "abiding in Christ" that causes good fruit to bear, or obedience to the commandments of God (here it is identified as loving one another, summing up the whole law--John 15:12).  We must simply state the indicative (who we are in Christ) is assumed when speaking of the imperative (obeying Christ).  If we abide in Christ through faith alone, then we will produce those good fruits.  If we do not abide in Chrsit through faith alone, then we will not produce good fruits.  If we do not produce those good fruits, then it is evident we are not abiding in Christ through faith.  I am not going to state performing good works is the basis of receiving and maintaing his love.  We cannot say the reward of eternal life is based upon our personal obedience, but Christ's alone.  This does not mean our personal obedience does not play a role (forgive the double negative).  However, the sole ground and reason we obtain the promise of the CoG, eternal life, is the finished work of CHrist.  Our obedience merely testifies to our resting in Christ.  Our obedience is necessary for salvation.  It simply is not the grounds of our salvation.  This is a matter of ensuring the indicative always precedes the imperative.

						   Another issue regarding the covenant of works is the extent to which it is still binding upon fallen man.  I have no doubt that all of mankind is commanded to be holy and righteous, always obeying God.  However, regarding the covenant of works, because it is broken--Adam and us in him breaking it--can we say that mankind is still  in  the covenant of works?  Are we still under the covenant of works, which demands personal, perfect, perpetual obedience?  If we are covenant breakers by virtue of being born--for we were in Adam's loins when he broke it, making us covenant breakers when we come into existence--then can we be  in  or  under  this same covenant of works?  I think it is safe to say that like Adam, as soon as he broke it, the covenant of works ceased to actually be a binding covenant in which he and we existed.  So, though a covenant of works does not remain binding all of mankind, the curse of it does.  Okay... how does that sound?  But what has that got to do with the price of beans in Brazil?  That simply means we cannot say of the unregenerate that he is under or in the covenant of works, demanding perfect and perpetual, personal obedience.  Rather, regardless of how "good" he is, he is a covenant of works breaker, unable to earn his eternal life because he is not a member of the covenant of works, but a covenant breaker.  These are simply random thoughts I am putting down on paper as I reflect.

						   Though I am a staunch tri-covenantal theologian (works, redemption, and grace), my rationalistic tendencies have not been happy with federal theology and the lack of a one-to-one correlation between our federal headship in Adam and Christ as it corresponds to the covenant of works and covenant of redemption.  The covenant of works was between God and Adam.  We--all of mankind--were also a party of the covenant in Adam.  So, what ever Adam did, and what ever Adam merited or demerited, we merited or demerited.  The covenant of redemption is between God and Christ.  The Father and the Son were the parties of the covenant.  We--the elect--were not parties in the covenant as we were with the covenant of works.  The covenant of redemption promised unto the Son several things.  We, in Christ through faith alone, also receive some of those promises due to Christ's fulfillment, but we do not receive all of them.  Christ was promised a people of His own overwhich to rule--the elect.  That was  a  promise of the one covenant of redemption.  We are not heirs to that promise.  However, we were heirs to all of the promises made unto Adam.  So, because we were not heirs of all the promises of the one covenant, I cannot state that the elect group was a party of the covenant.  If there was some way I could state we were in Christ in the covenant of redemption as we were in Adam, then federal representation would be nicely wrapped up federally.  If that were the case, I could side with Meredith Kline that the covenant of grace was made with the church, not simply the elect.  Berkhof notes that the majority of reformed theologians have insisted the covenant of grace is made solely with the elect (see page 273 of  Systematic Theology  published by Eerdmans).  I do not think it is valid to say we were a party in the covenant of redemption because only some of the promises in keeping it perfectly (the condition of the covenant of redemption being perfect, personal, perpetual obedience of Christ in all of the law--even unto death) are ours.  We do not receive all of the promises Christ Jesus received through obedience to the covenant of redemption.  Does anyone have any suggestions?  Has anyone thought about this issue?  Is it an insignificant issue I am bringing up?  Am I leaning toward rationalism if this keeps me up at night?

						   The Gift of Faith?  Reformed theologians often espouse "faith is a gift," as over and against the Arminian or Libertarian. But to what extent is "faith" a gift? What is this "faith" that is a gift? There are different senses in which "faith" is used in Scripture, and even to which it is a gift. Romans 12:3 speaks of being given a "measure of faith." Ephesians 2:8 and Philippians 1:29 allude that "faith" is given, or granted. My question is about the faith that is a verb, or the active resting and trusting in Christ for salvation and justification. I believe "faith" in Rom 12:3 is speaking about factual knowledge (a noun), or the substance that consists of the "Christian faith" in general. Paul always talks about the "faith" of Christianity, or that which comprises the doctrinal tenets of Christianity. Ephesians 2:8 and Philippians 1:29 seem to be speaking of "faith" as a verb. My focus and questioning revolves around the verb of believing, or the action man takes in coming to Christ empty of himself.  Ephesians 2:8 is quite highly debated as to what the gift (kai touto) is referring. One need only read Eadie's or Hendriksen's commentaries on Ephesians 2:8 to catch up on the debate of the Pauline phrases. The phrase in Philippians is less debated, though I have very few commentaries on the verse that speak of any controversy at all.  I do not believe it is proper to speak of "faith" as a gift without qualifying it. This conversation is rooted in my view of the free agency of man, though. I am Edwardsian regarding my view of the volition, in that man can only choose his strongest desire at any given point. Man can never choose contrary to his strongest desire. But why is this true? This requires we examine the three-fold compartimentalization of the area, namely: nature, desire and will (will or volition).  I believe the nature of any agent, or those properties or attributes that consist of the substance of a person in terms of morality, is that which dictates desires. Desires are produced by the nature, but one's desires is not one's nature. So, the nature dictates the desires of an agent. For instance, God's nature is holy and perfect, therefore it is impossible for God to desire to do anything contrary to holiness (i.e. lying). God only desires to be truthful. Man's nature works the same way, especially the postlapsarian fallen nature of man. Reformed orthodoxy, and I, agree that man's nature is totally depraved in that it never seeks to do any good out of a righteous desire, but if any good is done it is based upon a selfish, sinful desire (i.e. pride, notoriety, etc.). The human nature produces sinful desires. These sinful desires are used to facilitate the will of man. In other words, the desires produced by the nature direct the will of man to choose accordingly. Therefore, man, in his fallen condition, is never  able  ("ability" also needs to be defined) to choose righteousness, or to beleive in Christ, because man does  not want to  believe in Christ. This is not to say fallen man lacks the faculty of believing and trusting, for we see fallen man ultimately trusts and believes in himself. However, man's desires do not allow him to choose to believe because man's nature does not produce such desires. Fallen man has the cognitive faculty and ability to believe and trust in many things, but the choice to trust and believe is directed by his sinful desires.  I do not believe faith, or the volitional act of resting and trust in Christ, is something given unto man from without. It is true that no man will ever believe apart from God's active work of our regeneration; regeneration being work done to us from without. We are passive in regeneration. It is something done to us. It is a new heart and mind, or nature, that is given tous from without. It is totally and solely based on the will and work of God apart from any of our volition, desire, will, etc. God graciously changes our natures and gives us a new heart and mind. However, this is where I want to clarify what kind of "gift," if any, faith is.  I believe that God sovereignly and actively regenerates us, giving us a new nature. However, it is this new nature that gives man new desires. It is an inseprable consequent of regeneration, as is faith. The new nature gives us the desire to please God in obedience, both in obedience to the law and obedience of believing and resting and trusting in Christ (both obediences are distinct and are not identical: obedience to trusting and resting in Christ is not an obedience to the works of the law). This new nature gives us the desires to trust and rest in Christ. Using our faculties with which all men are created, we then bring to God our faith that he might give us salvation. Faith is an act of our volition performed by our faculties.  So, God is gracious in that he regenerates us, which necessarily produces faith. But faith is not something given to us by God. God does not give us the volitional resting and trusting in Christ. That is what we do because of our new nature and desires necessarily. Once man is regenerated, man will use his faculties to believe. Faith originates solely from man's own faculty. God regenerates. Man has a new nature. Man's new nature give man new desires. Man's desire is to trust and rest in Christ. Man volitionally chooses to trust and rest in Christ. Though God is the author of our salvation, and he is the one who makes us able to believe by regeneration, faith is not something done to us or given to us from without.  I believe John Calvin has hit the nail on the head as to the meaning of Ephesians 2:8. Calvin does not say "faith" is the gift of God, but that salvation is the gift of God. He says:   First, [Paul] asserts, that the salvation of the Ephesians was entirely the work, the gracoius work of God. But then they had obtained this grace by faith. On one side, we must look at God; and, on the other, at man... The next question is, in what way do men receive that salvation which is offered to them by the hand of God? The answer is, by faith; and hence he concludes that nothing cnonected with it is our own. If, on the part of God, it is grace alone, and if we bring nothing but faith, which strips us of all commendation, it follows taht salvation does not come from us.   Calvin comments that salvation is the gift of God. We--man--is what is brought to God that we may be saved. It is in opposition to any works of the law (moral, ceremonial, judicial). Salvation is given to us without anything we do, but in our coming empty to God in faith alone.   When, on the part of man, the act of receiving salvation is made to consist in faith alone, all other means, on which men are accustomed to rely, are discarded. Faith, then, brings a man empty to God, that he may be filled with the blessings of Christ. 9. Not of works. Instaed of what he had said, that thier salvation is of grace, he now affirms, that "it is the gift of God."   Calvin is emphasizing the text is not saying "faith" is a gift, but that salvation is a gift. It is a contrast between earning salvation by works, or it being given to man by faith. Faith, though, is not the gift in Calvin's estimation of this verse. He later adds:   [Paul's] meaning is, not that faith is the gift of God, but that salvation is given to us by God, or, that we obtain it by the gift of God.   I believe Calvin's theology not only agrees with what I've stated, but demands it. Faith is what man does, or that which originates from the will of man as caused by the new nature, but faith is not something given to us by God from without. I'll speak more on Philippians 1:29 later.
