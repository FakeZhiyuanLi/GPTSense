      Totally not in a good mood  I thought everyone in "The Cure" died of drug abuse a while ago. Guess not, apparently they're releasing a new CD.

      So. I've been really out of it for a long time. I'm starting to think that it's not just a passing thing. Maybe i've changed for the worst. I dont want to talk to anyone. I just want to be left alone in this little pool of vomit i've created for myself.  So i had one of "those" talks with my counselor today. They basically told me the same old junk. You know, the talk when they explain to you how if you dont get motivated or if you dont start caring you going to live a horrible life and die poor and alone and young. Either you do well in school, socialize with other well and become rich and famous or you can do poorly in school, be an unmotivated, loner, and eventually rot and die. So let me rot, i dont care anymore. I just dont care.  I seem to be in a bad mood. I always am.  No one understands. I just want them to stop trying to.  Leave me alone.

      That was messed up. There was this guy stumbling around my backyard while i was on the phone with this shockingly beautiful woman. He was so drunk. I hate my neighbors.  I need to do something tomorrow. Maybe sit outside and read? No, probably just sleep.  Paul's Naked!

        Franz Ferdinand  is definitely my favorite band!  right. So some of you may have noticed (ok, everyone) i've been really out of it lately. I totally dont feel like i cant talk to anyone anymore. maybe it's just i've run out of things to say, maybe i just dont feel like saying them anymore and not being listened to. or maybe still it's just the way i've been feeling lately. incase you didn't know, i've been pretty bummed out lately. i just feel... well you all know, "like that". bah, whatever, what it all comes down to is dont look to me to talk anymore, or at least until... um.... later.   urlLink SafeSex  Rocks!  bakers dipping chocolate, need i say more.  f*** it, i'm sleeping through tomorrow. maybe i'll wake up around 4, maybe not. call me if you need me or want to do that "we're worried about you" crap. *sigh*, sorry.   urlLink OMG!   i need friends. and by friends i mean active friends  eyedrops are SOOO hard to use   F*** all you people who say McDonalds is bad for you.  urlLink Here.     &nbsp;You leave me broken, shattered, I lie  I'm just a crosshair  I'm just a shot, then we can die     Wa min God! Se Ã¦x on min heafod is!
