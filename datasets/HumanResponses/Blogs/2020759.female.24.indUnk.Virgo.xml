      Hello all  What a fortnight it has been! So much has happened that I hardly know where to start. I guess the best place to start is a snapshot of the most memorable moments (like the alliteration?). Then a drill down into a reflection of the vicissitudes of life ... without being too philosophical because I probably don't have the insight to be and wouldn't wanna come off as a try hard ;p So now that we have a structure, let's begin:    2 weeks of conditions simulated to resemble hell. Okay, perhaps a bit too harsh of an evaluation of College but all I know is that I am now sick (and without a voice), mentally and physically drained, emotionally scarred and dreading going back in August.  On the plus side, I think I passed (fingers crossed anyway), and have a better appreciation of the legal profession. Actually that statement should be qualified because some people there were absolute pr*cks! Example, on my last day of College, I had 2 hearings. My practice one earlier in the week was hunki dori so I wasn't expecting the horror that was awaiting me. Admittedly I was slightly apprehensive considering a few people had burst into tears after some friendly grilling from the pretend magistrate. Little was I to know that my problem would be my arrogant pr*ck opponent. He spent HALF AN HOUR objecting to my affidavit - bearing in mind that most people FINISHED their entire case in 20 minutes (we were there for 40 minutes). He objected to nearly every single paragraph in my affidavit. This behaviour would have been quasi-acceptable if his objections were valid, but here I was standing up, sitting down, standing up again, sitting down etc, trying to answer the impossible. What do you say to questions such as "Why are bananas yellow?". Okay, an analogy but you catch the drift. I was getting so pissed off! So afterwards I approached the pretend-magistrate and asked him whether I was the incompetent one, and thank gosh he told me that he too was getting pissed off at his "tenuous" objections.  Moral of the story is that some people just become completely evil when put in an adversarial situation. We weren't marked on our objections, but noooooooo, he still chose to be an arrogant pr*ck. He didn't win the case anyway so suck crap ... justice was on my side - muahahahhahahaa    Watch out for yours truly in the 2005 College pamphlet. Too bad I looked like crap. I hope that do some airbrushing on me.    Realisation 1: I am terrible in stressful/pressure situations. Realisation 2: I must work on public speaking. Realisation 3: I have a speech impediment when I get nervous, "may it prease the clort" (i.e. may it please the court). Realisation 4: Classical music saved me during the fortnight ... thank you ABC FM. Realisation 5: Computers ALWAYS break down at the MOST inopportune times (thanks heaps Gregan ... again).    Spent Saturday revisiting childhood games. A few of us were at Hyde Park and it was exactly what I needed after a tough fortnight. So there we were, a bunch of 20ish year olds playing brandings and all sorts of games involving tennis balls. We must have looked like idiots! Especially when we were playing that 'spin 10 times around on 1 spot and 1st person to grab the tennis can wins' game. Oh my gawd ... I was in TEARS watching Sharlene do it. I'm talking about tears streaming down my fat cheeks laughter. Haven't laughed that long in ages! Anyway, went for a run around Hyde Park and stopped off @ St Marys because I had never been in there before. It's an absolutely amazing place. Very majestic! Then it was on to CRAB for Bec's bday. Hope you had enough claw to last you the rest of the year Bex :)    Today I heard some bad news from a friend. Okay let's cut to the chase, Duane will be leaving our fair shores in a matter of weeks. Not such great news to woken up to. Funny how things can happen so suddenly but I guess this is where my reflection of vicissitudes bit comes in. The word 'vicissitudes' always reminds me of the 'business cycle' in macroeconomics (ooo Keynesian Theory), but I digress.   I guess it sucks seeing a door shut in front of your face, but as that lovely bell hop says to Julia Roberts in "My Best Friend's Wedding" (excellent movie that) - "When one door shuts, another door always opens". So I guess that's the angle that you have to approach the business cycle. When you are in the lower region of the business cycle, you should take comfort in the fact that the upper region is around the corner. Or even better, let's look at the Butterfly Theory: "The Flap of a Butterflyâ€™s Wings in Brazil set off a Tornado in Texas". Drawing from that, I guess that means for you Duane that you will be creating chaos in Singapore! :) So don't be too dejected, you still own the best interpretation of a pink diamond ring ;p  So it's back to work for me and since the most of the group in my next rotation have been retrenched, it should be interesting times ahead. Plus the fact that Samantha Jones has shingles does not help, considering I haven't had the pox yet.   PS: Easy kill, Cannon Fodder ;p

      Stupidity just doesn't cut it, at the best of times. And at the worse of times, it is just unequivocally (har reminds me of Dawson's Creek) abominable.  Failing to look at the prescribed timetable, I naturally assumed that my 100% trust and accounting exam begins at 9am. This meant that I got up at 6:30am and rocked in St Leonards by 8:30am. This is until I realised that nobody bothered to turn up for the exam (bargain). But really, the reality is that it actually starts at 10am. So my caffeine adrenaline has now gone to waste, and I have had the past hour to stress about how little I know. At least I got to do my morning dump (ok too much information). Very very angry and annoyed at the moment.   Anyway, should go prep myself for the impending doom.  PS: Happy bday Bex for yesterday *hugs* - hope you enjoyed the non x-rated version of de la guarde.

      Day 3 of College On Site coincides with Day 3 of Insomnia and general mental instability.  Sleeping has been a mental battle since Sunday night - a contradiction really - expending effort to get some winks.  College has been a bastard, I so wish with all my might that I don't have to be here. Just went through a mock trust and office accounting exam and I lost it after page 3. Another contradiction as I have a major in accounting. I have always maintained that accounting is the crappiest subject in the whole wide world. I don't get this man-made crap and 3 years of studying it has not provided any sort of enlightenment or appreciation of it.   Am suffering from extreme levels of stress and hoping that I will be able to get a good night of rest sometime in the near future. The coughing fits at night are not helping with my cause. 20 minutes of spewing my guts out and what does my mother do? Come in my room with ONE fisherman's friend! Before I leave you with this sad account of my life, can I just share with everybody what I found extremely funny on Saturday night. I was watching "Indecent Proposal" (no that's not the funny bit) and there was a scene in the movie that went like this:  *Demi Moore is teaching a citizenship class* Demi Moore: Where do you come from? Foreigner: Kuba Demi Moore: OK, now say that in American like this ... cuba.  CAN YOU BELIEVE IT? The audacity! The movie really is an indecent proposal if they think they can get away with that.  On other news, welcome to the 9-5 world Mindy, and congratulations to all those buff paddlers who will escape potential terrorist threats in Athens but nevertheless still get the glory and privilege of representing their country in China.

      Quick update:  Day 1 of College On Site and it didn't get off to a very good start. Was on the train (stupid City Rail) for 1hr 10mins (standing for 1 hour), and staggered late into the room with messy hair, bags/folders everywhere, coffee in one hand threatening to spill, escargot in another threatening to soak through the paper bag, and mega ching-chong eyes. And if that didn't win me any friends, I'm sure splurting phlegm in everybody's direction will do the trick.  Anyway, it's been pretty intense. I can't wait til 4:30pm rolls around so I can go into work and print out more stuff for tomorrow's edition of College On Site.

        Qantas Lounge is Cool! and I am sick!    Here is my week in review - pictorially         Picture 1  - (Last Friday) A try hard black & white shot of Hyde Park en route to Sydney Uni law library. Although the usyd library has the priviledge of being located in close proximity to the judicial end of town, I must say that I found it a bit disappointing. Oh yeah, someone was getting married in a blue wedding dress that day - what was she thinking?!? I think they were Canterbury supporters in light of the blue and white theme, and the ethnic background (I know ... generalisation).   Picture 2  - (Last Sunday) Mother's Day dinner. Spent a considerable amount of time learning how to hold my chopsticks properly. How can I label myself an Asian if I insist on 'crossing' my chopsticks. It's so shameful! But the stomach vetoed the shame when the food was disappearing and I was still trying to hold those sticks in a parallel fashion. It's painful to watch people dig at the fish whilst you are paralysed in the non-parallel chopstick mode! I look like a sped in that photo, either that or I look like I have braces.   Picture 3  - (Wednesday) Mindy's graduation. Nice affair with an impassioned speech by the lady who is representing Australia @ the Robo-Dog Soccer World Cup. Funny how all the Asians line up at the food table, just like it was a buffet. At least you didn't have to use chopsticks in the correct parallel manner, or else I would have missed out.    Picture 4  - (Wednesday to Thursday) Picture of the Novotel @ St Kilda.  I had a very fulfilling coupla days in Melbourne - bar for the fact that I am now stricken with the flu. This is disastrous in light of the fact that I have a fortnight's worth of exams coming up. Who am I kiddin' ... it would be disastrous regardless. Ack! Feeling all delirious and non-mentally stable.  So yeah, I had lots of fun this trip, largely due to the following:    Samantha Jones Even though I'm pretty damn sure she was the disease carrier, she is one of the most left-field characters I have ever encountered in my life. She doesn't conform to any notions of normal or professional, and neither does she give a damn about that. She talks about sex incessantly, draws pictures of 'mushroom patches' (think phallic because she does), makes passes at any eligible guy between 17-60 (she was ACTUALLY flirting with one of our N.Z colleagues who was no doubt married), asks my manager whether he got some on his wife's birthday, flashes her belly button to get an upgrade to business class, claims Morticia Adams as her role model (because she is the perfect 'corporate' wife and has her every whim attended to by Gomez), makes bras out of tissue/napkins,  misses out on work christmas dinner because she has to get some ... oh the list goes on and on. I really think that a lot of the men in this office are completely flummoxed by her and just don't know how to handle her. All I can say is that I am never sitting next to her for an extended period of time because she is TOO distracting. I should mention that she is equally as intelligent and capable as well as crass and shocking.    My Restaurant Rules As mentioned in the comments, I was actually in the same lift as Simon (the Brisbane guy from My Restaurant Rules). And to answer your hard hitting questions Rebecca:  * He looks far better in real life - he is SOOOOO blonde! * Yes I think he was visiting the Melb restaurant - we were at a pub literally 10m away. * Gobsmacked because I am a sucker for any celeb ranging from A to Z class. * I was paralysed in the lift for at least 3 seconds too long - my work colleague was motioning me to get out but I was too awestruck to move. I must have looked like such an idiot. Reminds me of the time I met Penny Taylor - so exciting!  And Chad - we were across the road from Toppolina's but didn't get a chance to go in for a bite ... maybe next time.    Qantas Lounge How cool is the Qantas Lounge? Answer: very cool! Albeit there seems to be more people in the lounge compared to the departure Lobby (phenomena reminiscent of the MBA conundrum - i.e. the more ppl the less prestigious it seems). Nevertheless, you still get FREEEEEEEE wine, beer, soft drinks, coffee/tea, food (buffet style), massages, showers, wireless, magazines, TV. Although I was too scared to scam a free massage because they may have figured out that I'm a phoney!    Small fish in Big Pond (no intended reference to Telstra) Sometimes it's good to be out of your element, other times it's just completely overwhelming. I realised the following over the past 2 days: I am hopelessly knowledge/skills deficient; no matter how hard you try and be mature, people just don't respect you when you are the youngest in the mob; big boys club is alive and kicking in corporations; presentation/public speaking skills is the key to providing that extra edge. So what do you do when faced with all that AND having to introduce yourself to the room - rely on self deprecating comments of course, specifically: "My name is Marissa Wong and I started last October. I guess you could call me the pleb of the group". At least I got a chuckle.  PS: New photos added - more to come due to FTP suckage on the part of fotopic. PPS: Anyone think of a nice getup to hold a 21st - please leave suggestions in comments. You may even get an invite ... though there is probably a disclaimer to that offer.

        News Flash:    Short break extending to a possible lengthy time-out from blogging ...   Heading down to Melbourne tomorrow for a "planning conference" after Mindy's graduation (congrats Mindy) @ UTS. Shall be back on Thursday but cannot promise updates due to College exams/assessments for the next fortnight.   Well the realities of working in the corporate world finally hit home today after 1/8 of our department was made redundant. I guess you have to go through atrocities like this once in your career. It has made uncertain times even more uncertain, and really hammers home the fickleness of the business world. Something else it really highlights is the value of education and a wide ranging experience, because it seems that only those with limited expertise were made redundant. I should thank my parents for making me endure secondary/tertiary education. Anyway, it's all been too daunting and I am feeling sufficiently lifeless. I am lucky I have an awesome manager that is looking out for me, but it goes to show that nothing is ever engraved in stone.  Ack my brain is all mushy and confused. I shall leave you with the wise words of Steve Martin in "The Man with Two Brains" (excellent movie):  "Point Birds" O pointy birds, o pointy pointy, Anoint my head, anointy-nointy.  Wish me luck ...

        News Flash:    New Photos Posted - Click on "My Photos" in Side Nav Bar      Just another  Manic Monday  - right on Bangles!  To celebrate the start of another working week, here is a picture of my office. See the artwork on the walls - NOT MY CHOICE! Perhaps I will bring in my 2 Grant Hill posters and blue-tack them up. I'm sure that will go down well. It will match nicely with the incoming tackarama bball ring and my Golden State Warriors mini basketball (thanks Michelle).  Hmmm, not particularly in the mood to divulge about my weekend today - purely because it was a crappy shit weekend. Intentions to study for exams (which are looming ominously) were thwarted, but only by assignment deadlines. What kind of existence is this? Makes you want to pull your hair out really - but maybe only the grey ones.    I have an insight as to WHY I have recurring 'teeth falling out and choking on them' dreams. One interpretation is that teeth decaying/falling out symbolises the death of childhood/innocence (cf. milk teeth) and the onset of responsibility/accountability/quarter-life century crisis. Though I am not too sure what the 'choking' bit is an allegory for - perhaps that I don't chew my food properly, which is entirely true. Ahhh ... the vicissitudes of life, it's bumming me out at the moment.  Anyway, watched a few movies on the weekend starting with:    Harvey Crumpet (on recommendation by Dr Yan Dan Goh) I found it thoroughly entertaining and extremely humorous. 40 minutes worth of dry humour involving subject matters that are not entirely savoury but still manages to end on a positive note.     Love Actually I have a violent objection to this movie. In fact, it borders on being an insult to my intelligence. For a movie purportedly about "love", it failed miserably to deal with the subject matter. They kinda just figured they could chuck a whole bunch of storylines together, not bothering to develop ANY of it and just brand it as a generic LOVE story to lure the masses in. Pssshhhhh. What's even worse is that they failed to even take care of the simple things like when that guy visits Keira Knightley's character with the cardboard messages, what if Keira's husband had answered the doorbell?? What would happen then?? Only saving grace was DARCY!    Intolerable Cruelty I loved the witty banter between George Clooney (he's handsome!) and Catherine Zeta Jones (she's beautiful!) - it was refreshing. And with character names like Rex Rexroth and Heinz the Baron Krauss von Espy - you really can't go wrong.    Honey Oh the dodgy homey talk was sooooo lame: "Your flava is HOT" *spew spew* Only saving grace were the bball references namely: inclusion of a cross-over dance move; Jessica Alba dating a baller; getting inspiration from basketball. Even all that was slightly lame too. At least she looked hot in it.  Anyway, shall end here but before I go, I was told by our office version of Samantha Jones to "be a brazen hussy". Anything for professional advancement I say!

      Alright let's get the blogging out of the system so I can get down to business.  Well it's been a cleansing week. Managed to clear everything out of my in-tray and finally rotate to my next group with no loose ends (and those loose ends were really starting to fray). For those that are innately cat-like, I will spare you the impending curiosity-induced death by noting that my next rotation will be with the 'technical regulation' group (and yes I will be the main source of estrogen).  It's been a fiery morning, as reflected in the comments left on my previous blog. Notwithstanding the fact that Terence Koo BARRED me this morning (someone get me Dr Phil), today has gotten off to a decent start.  Updates since Wednesday:  Tried studying last night as I realised that exams are coming up in 2 weeks! (eeeeek!). But as luck may have it, the College site was down - damn I so wanted to study. The only time I have sat down to study, and the forces of nature conspired to work against me. Oh well, I will have to use the 'act of God' excuse on my 'special consideration' application.  So instead of studying, I ended up watching on my compy episode 7, 8 and 9 of the current season of Alias (while trying to look up on the Internet whether Jennifer Garner and Michael Vartan are still going out ... jury is still out on that one). Climbed into bed at 1am after promising myself I would sleep early - that's just sad when you lie to yourself.  We won basketball on Wednesday, albeit it was against a team called "The Fourty-Somethings". You almost feel like you shouldn't be playing hard since it could be your mother that you are elbowing/kneeing. Apparently one of them was breast-feeding on the sidelines, then promptly sub'd herself back on after tucking her boobies back into her sports bra. What is this? My restaurant rules?  Went to yum cha @ Market City yesterday. Why is it that they fail to mention all the 'good stuff' like tripe and scallop dumplings when they are squawking out all the other 'common' dishes? And their demeanour is so scary that you are afraid to ask what else they have in their little trolley. Apparently yum cha trolley pushers now have to sit a pseudo-driver's test to be an eligible trolley-pusher (this is what Shar tells me). Failure rate will no doubt be very high considering all the candidates are Asian ;p (ooo I'm not being very P.C today)  WNBA season is about to start *so excited* Penny Taylor has been drafted to Phoenix along with the first draft rookie Diana Taurasi. Looks like I will be supporting Phoenix & Seattle this year, and hoping yet again for the downfall of the 'Bulldogs' of the WNBA: LA Sparks.  I must say that herein our office exists a real life version of Samantha Jones (Sex in the City). Oh the stories I have about her are absolutely fantastic. Shall save these for another day ...

        News Flash:    YAY! Back on Blogger!   Hello Blog-ders! (as in Blog Readers)  I realise that I failed to meet the self imposed 3rd May blog-target, but it's been a case of 'I am so busy I could be a bee' (obviously not a Queen-Bee though ... *sigh*).  Where do I begin (from the very beginning insists Julie Andrews). Well I was down in Melbourne last week for 3 days, and it looks like I will be back there next week (which means I will miss out on basketball AGAIN! *sob*). Melbourne is a very classy city. Just walking through the CBD you realise a few things, namely: buildings are FAR nicer, transport system is much more efficient (but then you can't possibly imagine anything worse than City Rail ... don't get me started!), people are much better dressed, people seem to be better looking (though quite possibly an illusion effected by the better dress-sense), there are more inter-racial couples, it's a fantastic place to shop! Moreover, you realise the inherent EVILNESS of big coffee chains such as Starbucks and Gloria Jeans (sorry Joe). Melbourne is littered with wonderful cafes and bars. You can't walk 3 steps without bumping into one. Demonic things such as Starbucks really take away the personality and character that you find in these cafes/bars - and each one is so different. Plus the coffee is so much cheaper than the sub-standard crap you get @ Starbucks (except when you're the coffee-master Joe of course).  Anyway, I was actually half-entertaining the thought of migrating to Melbourne until I realised that I enjoy the bogan-ness of Sydney too. Walking down the streets of Melbourne with a pair of tracky-dacks would probably be a violation of all sorts of standards, whereas I would be quasi-comfortable sporting my trackies down George St (maybe). There were a few horror stories during my stay. First I got lock INSIDE my hotel room. And what made it even more dire was that I was running late for a bus. Had to ring up concierge TWICE and once someone came to rescue me, I didn't even have time to check out whether he was cute ;p Fully bolted through the CBD - thank gosh it was cold or else I would have had sweat patches all over my clothes. Second, I went gambling alone - and yes Fiona didn't fail to remind me the sadness of that sight. Third, I was the only one that turned up in 'Sydney casual gear'. Obviously Melbournites have a different standard of 'casual', and that involve something more than jeans and an abecrombie top!  Moving on, work has been hectic lately. Been average 3.5 hrs sleep for the past couple of days, and coupled with deadlines for College assignments ... well it's a perfect formula for nose bleeds. My nose began bleeding in bed 2 nights ago and you know, it is really the acme of laziness/tiredness when you decide that you're going to swallow your blood rather than the expend energy to grab a tissue.  I have been working on a presentation which my manager was due to give to a bunch of masters students. It becomes a whole different ball game when your work is to be displayed and critiqued publicly on transparencies - and the worst bit is that I had to account for myself by being at this presentation last night. Anyway 52 transparencies later, and with all my reputation, dignity and self worth at stake, what should happen??! The FIRST SLIDE HAD AN ERROR! For the love of everything sacred! WHY WHY WHY! And on the FIRST SLIDE?!? Could not have been a worse start! I had repeated the word "estimated" twice - admittedly one was in parenthesis, and the other wasn't. But when it's magnified times 1000 on a transparency, there was no saving to be done. Oh the shame and horror! So BAD!!!!! This is something you only read about! Gradually I began to sink lower into my chair until the next whammy - someone decided to question of my slides. Feeling far too incompetent to verbalise anything, I decided to let my manager handle the situation. And that folks is how to manage to appear completely incapable in front of your superior. Excellent work! *sigh*  Should mention that we had our end of season party for dragon boat on Saturday. All I have to say is that I am henceforth vindicated of my shameful Bar Ace incident. Stepping in to take my place is Sharlene Wong, whom although spewed somewhat gracefully, still managed to hurl in excess of 7 times throughout the night. Twas a good night - movie was great, music was good and company was happy.  I realised something earlier today. If you track through all the truly 'strong' female characters that have appeared on the movie screen, their motivation stems from the love they had for their children - think Ripley and Newt (Aliens), think Sarah and John Connor (T2), think Black Mumba/The Bride and her child (Kill Bill). So my point is that perhaps I will never be 'strong' because I don't desire to have kids? Speaking of which, didn't you love the way Quentin Tarantino managed to squeeze in 10 minutes all the different stages of grief in that coffin scene. And they were visually so succinct and distinguishable: denial, anger, bargaining, depression, acceptance. I guess moving past that last hurdle was the true sign of Black Mumba's strength. Because if it was me, I would probably reach the acceptance stage but just kinda be content with lying in the coffin thinking of the best way to breathe my last gulp of air - quite possibly because I don't have a child you see ;p  Anyway, it has been a long diatribe so I shall stop here. Happy birthday to Gregan for last Wednesday! More photos to come soon so stay tuned.

        What An Exciting Weekend!    My brush with fame continued on Saturday night when I got to meet and greet Penny Taylor! Woohoo! My encounter was captured quite succinctly on camera (thank you Wayne):    Here I am getting very nervous at the thought of being in the presence of PT. Armed with a program (which we rorted from a corporate box) and a pen (which turned out to be dodgy), I was contemplating what topics of conversation I could muster with PT (apart from Bunsen burners and the periodic table).   Shar & Wayne were completely flummoxed by my excitement & enthusiasm. They were patiently watching me go completely loco like a kid in a candy store. They eventually got fed up & kept saying "I want to go to KFC". But chicken can wait whereas celebrities cannot - although hot'n'spicy is only back for a limited time.   What a golden moment! Started off a bit shaky with my dodgy pen not working. After laughing at my use of the word "dodgy", PT asked her mother for a pen (how embarrassing) - she even introduced me to her mother! After searching extensively in her hand bag, no pen was to be found so PT [continued below] ...   A fruiful night notwithstanding the fact that we were probably the only ones there that weren't under the age of 20. The Opals allowed some time for signing autographs. I left the stadium a very happy little cherub. And yes, everybody did get their KFC.    The only question that remains outstanding is whether our asses would look bigger or smaller than the Opals' in those body suits.  ___________________________________________  [continued] ... had to ask this little boy to borrow his pen. Why couldn't I have just brought a pen that works? I asked her about Phoenix and she gave me a very detailed answer. She even told me that her team lost to L.A that night by 2. I decided to do some sucky-uppy by telling her that she would have made the difference. She was extremely nice and polite, and an absolute treat to meet. I wished her good luck with her future endeavours and although I could have possibly stayed and chatted longer, I was getting too tongue tied and felt I should leave before I made an even bigger fool of myself. Definitely the highlight of my night considering the actual game was pretty crap and the cheerleaders were OH SO BAAAAAAAD! They were a good source of (bad) entertainment though.

        I AM FAMOUS!    OMG! I made it on to the most pre-eminent website of our times:  urlLink WNBA.com  Check me our  urlLink  here  ! (See Question 2) I think I've had my fair share of '15 minutes of fame' this year. Damn, I hope I am not wasting it on undistinguished feats. By my calculations, I still have a good 8 minutes left which hopefully will be worthy of Daily Telegraph/Today Tonight mentions.  I think I have something similar to SjÃ¶gren's Syndrome and/or Multiple Sclerosis. Why do I say this? No, not because I have Munchausen Disease ... but because I keep attacking my 2nd finger on both hands. I can't stop myself from cracking it! I crack it when I'm bored, when I'm stressed, when I'm reading, when I'm thinking, on the toilet, on the train ... everywhere, every time. I have these abnormally sized knuckles on my index fingers now and it's GROSS.

      There has been a deafening silence of late which must be filled with verbose crap poste haste.  Apologies for the lack of updates, but since the move to the dreaded 'open-floor plan' (accessorised with low partitions) I've had to be more accountable for my time, work and internet activity (since the entire floor has a bird's eye view of my screen now).  Where to begin? Well I just returned from a 10 minute massage session with the workplace masseuse and OHMYGAWD! Luckily he had one of those chairs where you squish your face in the hole, or else I would have been moaning away like a silly git. You know the other day when we were in a video conference, I saw myself on screen and I was shocked to see just how BIG my head is vis-a-vis the rest of my body. It makes me look like a child! And the big cheeks just adds to the BIGNESS of my head. And someone actually called me "button" the other day!? At first I thought it's because he couldn't recall my name but could it be because of my appearance?  It's been a week of rude males (again).   Rule Male Incident No. 1  As we were reversing into a car parking space outside Eric/Fiona's apartment, this man decides to stand right in the middle of it, supposedly because he was minding it for his work colleague (who had yet to arrive but when he showed up was on the wrong side of the road). At first Wayne tried to have a chat with him. Becoming increasingly impatient and pissed off at the situation, I jumped out of the back seat and intervened with the objective of speeding up the 'piss of stupid male' process. As predicted, he had the usual "I'm allowed to stand wherever I want on the road"; "you're not allowed to reverse into me" arguments. Initially I tried the respectful technique of addressing him as 'sir' and utilising logic, but obviously a discussion based on logic is futile when dealing with stupid males. We ended up resorting to the following points: "does that mean you can stand in the middle of George St since you're allowed to stand wherever you want on the road"; "does that mean that anybody can camp out on the street to mind parking spots". After some painfully obvious statements, he finally gave up and walked away somewhat disgusted. To make the point a little more cogent, I decided to walk across the street and mind an empty spot for his work colleague. But alas, the gesture was not appreciated and his colleague drove right past.  I'm kinda amazed he took me seriously considering I was wearing my beanie and bball gear (i.e. loser pet store). Goes to show that justice prevails even when you look completely disrespectable.   Rule Male Incident No. 2  Last week's touch footy game was marred by the following remarks between myself and bastard No. 7:  [Me on defence]  No.7: *whinges* (because I accidentally tipped him too hard - so he reckons anyway) Me: "Stop bitching and play the game"  [Next set of attack - me of offence]  Me: "Watch the tits" (as he whacked me across that region pretty damn hard) No.7: "Stop bitching and play the game" (in a mocking tone) Me: "Wait til you have tits, then you can come back and say that to me"  [Later on in the game - talking to the referee]  No.7: "Sir, I think the girl in yellow shorts (me) has a problem"   Rule Male Incident No. 3  Same touch footy game. Equally as rude male but fatter and slower. Rude Male: "Stop touching my balls"  He was clearly delusional and probably took up the sport because it has the word "touch" in it. Ok, a bit harsh but how offensive and disgusting is his suggestion? Makes me want to puke. This same guy had the balls to apologise after the game - should have really kneed him at that point. What an idiot! I cry "chivalry"!!  On completely different subjects:   Felicity  On a major Felicity craze at the moment, which could explain my Felicity DVD watching long weekend. I forgot how much I love that show. Seriously need to purchase Season 3 and hopefully Season 4 will come out soon. This show really tugs at my heart strings and affects me in the most profound ways. Yeah lamo I know. And unlike shows such as Buffy & Alias, it is not completely devoid of reality - I mean, I could never really fall in love with a vampire ;p Ok, shall stop talking searchingly about this before I begin ranting on why they had to cancel the series - bastard males of network television!   Basketball  Opals playing in a pre-olympics tournament this weekend. Am very keen on watching them, especially in light of the fact that Penny Taylor will be in town - woohooo! Can talk to her about Bunsen burners again. Can you actually believe that we discussed about bunsen burners last time we met? What the? I have no idea how it came up. Perhaps I can bring up the periodic table this time and how helium looks all alone in the right hand corner. Checked out the Opals' draw in the Olympics - they have a good shot @ the Gold this year.   Nice Japanese Waitresses  I don't know why but I have an issue with nice Japanese waitresses, especially the one on York Street. Every time I go to that restaurant, I get extremely upset and end up leaving the eatery depressed and lamenting on why she is smiling all the time. Is she truly happy? Is it a facade? I felt so bad one time that I left a note for her with the bill thanking her profusely for the wonderful & kind service. She came out running after reading it and smiled her gentle smile. That made me even more upset. Settle petal - need a grip on reality I think ...   College  Some results are out and woohooo - I got a H.D for one subject! More results pending.   Miss Universe  Couldn't resist the temptation of commenting on the 2004 pageant after viewing some weeks ago. First, the Australian delegate was so much more substandard than first imagined. Not only was she the only one without a degree, but her walk resembled that of Demi Moore's in 'Strip Tease'. But then, the most beautiful of the lot (Miss Paraguay) had this to say when asked which female leader she'd like to interview and why: "I am here in Miss Universe pageant as a finalist." What's going on? Do beauty and brains have to be mutually exclusive these days? Surely not with shows like 'Extreme Make Over' and 'Queer Eye'.   Work  Development/career plan time - ackkkkkkkk. I wish myself mental health and a good dose of self esteem.  Okay long enough blog. Outtie ...

      Let's aim for a bit of sporting and cultural flavour today.  I read in the paper this morning that Miss Australia won the Miss Universe pageant. Considering this site is a slight homage to the Miss Universe cause (only by title), I thought I'd give this near miraculous event some 'PR'. By the way, welcome to all those people who have done searches on "miss universe 2004" and unfortunately ended up here. Even though I am Australian (by citizenship) and share aspirations of donning my native traditional dress,  urlLink 1   I am afraid you have been duped by either yahoo, google or ninemsn (this is why you shouldn't buy shares in Google).  What luxury is it for a girl to claim that she "never really wanted to be a beauty queen" and "joked about Miss Universe as she watched it on television with her mother" but nevertheless goes on to winning the darn thing with minimal effort. Though I must say that her description of winning the pageant really perplexes me: "It's like having a really bad car accident - you don't see it coming and it changes your life significantly". Somehow, I would have used a more up-beat analogy ... but hey, I'd be happy if someone sings me the "you are my star ... la la la la" song. AND do you notice how quickly the runner-up gets whisked away when they announce the winner. We're talking milli-seconds. Isn't that the ultimate feeling of being a loser - being carted away because you don't deserve the limelight. Cut up.   For those that are partial to the NBA, it looks like it will be Detroit and L.A in the finals. And now I would like to make a bold statement - Detroit will win the championship. Why? No mathematics or probability involved (because I don't understand the crap). Purely due to the fact that the WNBA finals played out in exactly the same fashion and Detroit ended up stealing the championship convincingly.  And speaking of basketball, our team had a really good win last night. I haven't enjoyed a game of basketball as I much as I did last night for a long time. Hmmm that was a bit of a nebulous sentence. Nevertheless, enjoyment came at a cost. I am now suffering from what is medically coined as "blunt trauma" (colloquially known as a cork thigh). I'm a bit concerned in light of the fact that a certain resident of Hornsby Hospital did NOT know what a cork was. What are they teaching in med school these days? Oh yeah ... and I am NOT A CHOKER ANYMORE! YAY! Actually managed to sink all 4 of my free throws in the dying seconds of our tied game. I am now officially in the same league as Michael Jordan *cough* Looks like I'll have to take up softball soon.  Will have to be moving building soon, into an open plan office. Oh the horror! Though the kitchen is much better and there is a vending machine. But still ... OPEN PLAN! No more dodgy conversations on the phone.  Managed to eat foil yesterday after insisting on warming Sylvia's leftovers (which was wrapped in foil) in the microwave. I knew that it was going to catch on fire, but somehow I managed to convince myself that the laws of chemistry was not going to apply to me and my food that day. The power of denial ... it's what Dr Phil makes a living out of. So it caught on fire and melted bits of my lunch box. That lunch box has been through so much. First, it was dumped (down the loo), and now it's been burnt (via microwave). It's almost like it's been in a long-term relationship. So I ended up crunching on bits of aluminium foil, but hey, at least the food was yummolicious. You're a great cook Sylvia!  And Mindy ... when you're sliding into first, and you feel something burst ...  ___________________________   1  urlLink http://www.smh.com.au/photogallery/2004/06/02/1086058896254.html

      So what do you say when someone barges in your office with "I'm sick, I've got the shingles and I just got my period".  Do what I did throughout chemistry class in High School, that is, *smile and nod* And if it wasn't smiling and nodding, it was singing the Nigel Song, or sucking up to my Maths teacher whom I absolutely adored (no hanky panky though).  Anyway, found out yesterday that I could have gone to Singapore for 3 days to do a presentation that I prepared for the Spore Telco Code but nooooooo I had stupid College. I really must have bad karma, or extreme bad luck, but then again luck is only how you perceive things apparently. So in another words, I am pretty lucky since NOT going to S'pore means I won't put on weight and get that ugly yellow air-conditioning skin colour that is so predominant amongst people of that country (no offence). Instead I can put on weight here (since it is winter) and get that awful white chocolate dry skin colour. Woohoo!  Speaking of winter ... how cold has it been? I almost died of hypothermia last night during touch. It took a good hour to regain feeling in my fingers. Perhaps I will have to start being hard core and wear those Rocky fingerless gloves. But then that defeats the purpose of gloves huh? Go figure. Last night, there was this guy who FULLY blew his nose (twice on the right nostril, and once on the left nostril) on the field. Then he has the audacity to shake everybody's hands after such an act of human indecency. Was really torn as to whether I should shake his hand or not. I hope the sub-degree temperature of my hands manage to sedate the snot germs.  Seattle play Phoenix on Friday morning 2:30am! How exciting! Will have to hold a nigel party reminiscent of the nigel World Cup Soccer Party I held in 1999 (as soon as I find someone who will lend me their Optus/Foxtel).

        Mortification Part Deux ('Der' would probably be more appropriate)    Another cause to rip into a tirade of unpalatable language - albeit circumstances are more towards embarrassing rather than aggravating (stupid HECS debt).  Well  mortification  usually equates to Marissa making a fool of herself (again) in front of her manager. WHY WHY WHY? As if the errant SMS wasn't enough **cringe** **shudder**   Occasion: Fortnightly coffee catch-up Location: Cafe on Castlereagh Street Scene: As we were about to wrap up, this conversation ensued:-   Manager:  Maybe you should wipe the chocolate off your mouth before we leave.  [ I begin my clean up as the psychologically scarring effects from the embarrassment & the mortification set in - while trying to act calm & collected of course ]   Manager:  Oh wait, you are wiping the wrong spot. It's on the other side of your mouth.  [ Okay no more saving to be done. The only question left on my mind is whether I had crap on my mouth the ENTIRE time. How can you possibly take a person seriously when they have crap around their mouth. ACK AAAAAACKKKK!! ]  Learnings:   Never take yourself seriously because something trivial like chocolate sprinkles will mock you!   Stick with water when dealing with important people.   Food usually ends up on the right side of your mouth.  I wonder if we will win tonight?

      Those who are offended by foul language - please turn a blind eye now:  FUCKING HECS DEBT!   I hope the government can justify squeezing the livelihood out of us poor maggots who have to contribute to their unsubstantiated, dodgy, logically unsound policies whilst bearing an obscenely grosteque debt in excess of $26K that is accumulating interest at a rate in excess of $600p.a. Crap I'm pissed off!!  Talk about a deterrence to getting a freakin' education. Talk about stymying higher learning. Do you know that before the Howard Government came into power, students were only liable for a HECS debt of $2442 a year, regardless of what course they enrolled in! Ahhh nostalgia!

        How Exshoiting!    'What could be so exshoiting?' I hear the curious screams en masse. Only that I get to wear my knee-high footy socks at touch footy tonight. Woohooo! I don't know why it never dawned upon me to do so earlier. It's the perfect solution to all my woes: it keeps your legs warm during those cold winter nights when one should really be under the doona watching Queer Eye; it keeps manky puss-ie (amended spelling just for you Tony) wounds from getting re-infected (hence the lack of need to sue local council); gives the opposition a false sense of security since they will most likely equate girl wearing gay knee-high socks with unco tryhard la-hoooos-rrr. It's all very 'fetch'.  I went shoe crazy last week and bought 3 pairs in 2 days. I have since discovered that I have a complex with high-heeled shoes. No, it's not because I sometimes walk like a bigger wally when I have heels on - it's much more profound. I simply dislike being taller than my work colleagues. I feel awkward and uneasy and accordingly feel the need to slouch - and if I slouch anymore than I already do, there would be no need for me to grow old. Plus it's so much easier to run for the train when you have flat shoes on. Same goes for jay walking and escaping that person you know but don't want to talk to.  Verdict of POPP Party: resounding success. If only I could metamorphosise those fake notes into real cha-ching.  And oh yes - bets are on as to whether we choke on Wednesday. Details are as follows: KGV @ 6:30pm - Tracey to provide the music every time we score.

        Manky ... Very Manky    I have a woefully manky left leg due to excessive contact with non-plush grass during touch footy. I am the proud owner of a "festering wound" that will not stop pussing. It's ridiculous the amount of puss that is oozing out of this thing. I've had to wash all my work pants because there are all these spots of puss everywhere - it's all very crusty (pun intended)! Anyway, I thought my manky, pussy, festering wound was crippling my leg because I was starting to lose all feeling and movement - probably not a good thing just before a basketball semi-final (which we won btw - yay!). But it's amazing the placebo effect a doctor's words (albeit still lacking sympathy) can have on worried patient. And some people take WAY TOO MUCH pleasure inflicting pain-sensitive people with hydrogen peroxide.  My shoes decided to break down on me this week - it's so sad! It's so broken that it fell off while I was walking up the stairs at Town Hall Station - very embarrassing - also didn't help that I had really daggy socks on. So had to go to buy some shoes during lunch time today. In addition to my festering wound, I now have a huge ass blister on the same leg. Very ouchy.  And oh yeah, a bird pooped on me at lunch yesterday. Stupid pigeons! I hope more of them get toasted when they light up the Olympic cauldron at Athens.  Basketball Finals next Wednesday @ 6:30pm - you've all been officially informed. Should be a cracker, and hopefully we don't choke like we usually do. Let's hope I recover from my manky wounds before that time.

        Birthday Bonanza!    All I can say is that there were plenty of oldies during the period 1975 til 1983 who had spring break fever. Why? Because I have been celebrating birthday after birthday for the past 2 weeks. And not one of them was even my chinese birthday - what's going on? ;p That being said, happy birthday to the following (won't reveal ages for privay reasons):   My mother - whom apparently still looks like my sister;   Mindy - the big TWO ONE, not to mention a new double bed and a bigger room;   Shar - definitely making a mockery of the post 1/4 century crisis theory;   Wayne - not quite at the eligible age yet;   Sylvia - you can have your cake and eat it too;   Vicky - a win at touch footy in honour of your birthday;   Justin - your girlfriend works down the road from me.  So all this cake-eating, birthday celebratory dinners and extra calories are not conducive to maintaining the pre-winter taut physique. Oh I remember the days when I could nearly lick water from my pubescent shoulder dimples (what's the bet google will have an advertisement about puberty on my blog now). The manifestation of winter became horribly evident the other day when, after work, I peeled off my pants and saw that my 80 denier stockings  urlLink 1   had holes and ladders at my feet. I should explain that I have worn these stocking previously and thus they have been stretched sufficiently. This being the case, the ONLY reason these THICK 80 denier quality stockings could have ripped is because it could not contain the excess amount of fat I have stacked on. I point your attention to the following analogy: if you put in too much water in a balloon, what is the likely immediate effect? *whimper* That's it, not eating meat pies at the snow this year. But how can you resist?  Saw the movie 'Mean Girls' the other night. Possibly the best movie I've seen this year. Portrayal of personalities that are clearly excessive was spot on, without being too cheesy or lame. I was not bored for a single second, and was laughing throughout the entire movie: "I shall call you caddy". Plus there was a seriousness about the movie that was endearing too. Then again, I do have an offbeat sense of humour but definitely 4 stars out of 5 in my books.  Managed to pull of a sick post move last night! Woohooo. Also managed to have snot fly out of my nose while attempting a second post move. The ball ending up hitting the side of the backboard. This is what happens when you're too concerned about appearances. Alternatively, this is what happens when you have 2 dibs in the pot. And no, I'm not naturally snotty - I have the flu.  The reason there have been no updates of late is because I wanted to leave the P.T photos up as long as humanly possible - looks like 11 days is the extent of human capabilities these days.  And quick question: do people read aloud in their heads when they read? I've always thought that was the wrong way to read when I was young. I hated the fact that reading was so noisy. It's meant to be a peaceful activity right? But how can it be peaceful when you're voicing all these words in your head? Do monks read out aloud?  ________________________________   1 For the benefit of non-females, this means really really thick stockings.

        It's The Final Countdown!    Oh the spine is tingling; hairs are standing on its tippy toes; eyes are widening ever so slightly (impossible as it may be for ching chong eyes to do so); Rossini's overture to The Barber of Seville is blaring to aid the momentum into the last hours before sui juris! The  Rossini Crescendo  is very fitting! Haven't been this excited in days. Maybe playing ball today helped? I've become so feeble that I might as well have given the ball away every time someone came close. Though I did block the crap out of some girl - you KNOW it's a good block with the referee blows his whistle out of shock and then apologises for accidentally stopping the game.  Maybe I am talking it up a bit - but I haven't talked to anybody in days so it's allowed.   Can't to forget to mention: 'Walking (or should I say boarding) in a Winter Wonderland'. Hope the snow is plentiful and that the pillow won't make another appearance in my ski pants this year.

        Woohooo!    On the home stretch and managed to score record breaking 3 hours sleep last night. That's the most in 4 days! Vitality is pretty good at the moment in light of rather weird 'walking on air' sensation the past few days. If only I was a Tekken character doing those time trial things, where you just collect "CHICKEN" every time your vitality level drops ... "CHICKEN!" Does anybody know what I am referring to?  My forearm is SO sore, not from exercising (because I've don't jack all for 2 weeks). It's from squeezing condense milk from the bottle for my coffee. I've decided to go anti-cow and stick with the unheathier, rich-in-sugar option.  Okay, property exam here I come ... GRRRRRRRRRR!!!!

        Fat cells are not working!    I have been living voluntarily in solitary confinement (ridiculous as it may seem) for the past 5 days. Tomorrow will be the first day I get to interact with humans! I sound like Sunny from I-Robot (although I haven't seen the movie but I was never a fan of Asimov - don't hurt me Dr Goh). The excitement would be entirely warranted if only the purpose of my interaction was something a little more meaningful than bitching about how hard the exam was with fellow sullen sleep-deprived quasi robotic-state students. Okay take breath.  So it completely sucks living the life of Jodie Foster in Nell - even better that Liam Neeson does NOT come save me. At least I've been able to curb my exponential increase in food intake during my nigelness. It's amazing how fast time flies when the pressure is on to cram loads of useless crap in your head. There were mornings where I forgot to go to the toilet - I know! Impossible feat.  So yeah ... my fat cells are completely useless. You'd reckon that if your body was blessed with lots of fat cells, the least they could do is perform properly! How's this for 'I want a refund':    track pants   flannelette PJ top   thick wollen jumper   one of those sleeveless ski jumpers   knee high socks   pink bed socks   gloves   heater on   mickey mouse beanie (which may or may not be gay)  and  ... still too cold to sleep.   Okay, must try and realign sleeping patterns so I can wake up for this damn exam.
