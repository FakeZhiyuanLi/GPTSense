						   Oooo weee... I'm stoked. I just got a shipment of  urlLink Omaha Steaks . I can't wait to fire up the grill. Todays menu is going to feature a couple of filets and some ribeye.  They say red meat isn't good for you. I say screw that... Steaks are my favorites and after I apply my special seasoning for them I'll be in heaven.

						   I took a half day at work today so that I could study. Geez I hate studying, especially on Fridays. This Friday is no exception. I've got to study so that I can pass this stupid exam. An exam that doesn't really help me on the job or even enrich me in some fashion.  The profession that I'm in is notorious for having high barriers to entry. The exams that we have to pass are ridicously detailed and hard, but still they are passable. I'm committed to passing this time so that I can get through with them. I just wish the material was a little more interesting.

						   I've felt horrible all day. Seems like I hurt someone very special without even realizing I did so.  Emotions are so hard to understand. Is it even possible for a man to know how the emotions of a woman operate? It's said that women are the fairer sex. I think that a good characterization of men should be the denser sex.

						   5 HOURS!!!!  Awww yeah... It's hard to study that long, but I did it. My eyes are sore and I'm starving, but I put in 5 hours today... not too shabby... not too shabby at all.  Now it's time to get something to eat.

						   Another 1.5 hours down... that leaves a total of 90 minutes left to reach my goal of 5 hours for the day. The last part is always the toughest, but I'm shooting for another 2 hours just to give me some cusion.  My neck is sore from looking down at the books... My fingers are sore from doing problems and writing note cards... In the end these are just minor inconviences because meeting my goal is more that worth the effort.  As much as studying gets a bad knock, sometimes it can be exciting. It's certainly exciting trying to reach this goal.

						   I'm on a mission to study for 5+ hours today. The rewards for doing so are worth so much more than the actual time investment. 5 Hours seems like a lot, but I'm going to break it up into 3 pieces.  I don't care if it's 2AM before I finish studying... I'm gonna do it dammit!!!

						   Today has been a yucky day.  I woke up not feeling to well, but I still went out and did some errands this morning. I went to Kroger and Meijer looking for some Gerber infant vitamins but neither store had them. While perusing the vitamin section I decided to pick myself up some. They had a 100 pack on sale for $5.99. Not a bad price at all. I know I haven't been eating well, so I'm hoping that the the vitamins will help fill the gap until I get my diet back up to speed.  Why do vitamins have to be so big though?  I'm feeling a little better now after a nap and some Tylenol, but now my day is only left with my obligatory study time.

						   I'm on my way to take the baby to see my mom. She hasn't gotten a chance to see her in about two weeks. I know she misses her, but time for visiting is always scarce.

						   Well I'm finally back home after a day of taking the baby to different doctor appointments. The morning appointment was absolutely useless and could have been skipped.  Ugh... I'm so tired of different doctors asking about developmental milestones that the baby should be achieving, but that she is missing. It's always so depressing and heart wrenching. Seems like they should talk to one another so we don't have to keep repeating how bad a shape the baby is in.  This last doctors appointment was about the baby throwing up so much. The had to cathederize baby to get a urine sample. They think it might be a kidney infection but they will let us know tomorrow. They also said it could be gasteroineritis (I don't know how to spell that). More follow ups are scheduled for tomorrow and Friday.

						   The baby has been sick since yesterday. She throws up almost every time she eats now. I gave her a suppository and she pooped good after it. If she doesn't start eating good tonight we'll make a trip to the doctor.

						                                 I was shamed into washing the car last night after several people made comments regarding how dirty it was. It got so dirty by driving through a construction zone on Telegraph road that had standing water on it.        &nbsp;        Last night I pulled out the hose and gave it a really good wash, along with polishing the visible parts of the  urlLink Magnaflow Exhaust  system. I got into all the crevices of the wheels and got ride of two weeks worth of brake dust as well. The chin spoiler still needs some deal of scrubbing to get some grime off of it, but I'll have to tackle that another day.        &nbsp;        This car looks sweet when it's cleaned. I'll have to post some pictures of it later on in the week.        &nbsp;

						                                 I just an IPod Mini for the first time. Those things are sweet!!! I want one so bad.        The person that showed it to me has always been at the top of the cool scale, but now they have just shown that they can surpass all expectations of cool imaginable.        &nbsp;

						                                 I was partially right about it being a rough night last night. I ended up getting 3 hours of sleep instead of 1.5. 3 hours isn't so bad.        &nbsp;        Physical therapy went good today. The baby wasn't too crabby there. It might be because she was a little too tired to be crabby. Who knows, but I hope that she does better and better each time.        &nbsp;

						   The baby threw up her medicine tonight.  The rule of thumb is if she throws up her medicine before 5 minutes goes by then we can re-adminster it to her. Well she threw up right at the 5 minute mark. That means that she probably only absorbed a little bit of her medicine.  When this happens it usually means a crabby night. It's my night to stay up with her and check on her when she cries. My guess is that I'll get 1.5 hours of sleep tonight. With that in mind, I'm off to hit the sack.

						   I just realized that the man sucks. The man discourages individuality. Should we all become like sheeple?  Life is short enough as it is. To have to spend our short time second guessing ourselves is no way to live. I often wonder why we are actually here. Sometimes it seems like we are here to suffer.  There are so many things to keep us down, why can't we do things that please us?  I guess the old saying "life sucks and then you die" is true.

						   OMG...  Doom 3 is so scary.  The lights are off and I'm in the basement. I turned off the game for now but I'm scared to get up. Why did I ever get that game???  I think I'm about to crap my pants.

						                                 I'm getting Doom 3 this week. I'm pretty excited about that.        I don't know when I'll get a chance to play it yet. I'm sure it will be late at night. I hear the game is pretty scary, so I hope I don't have to end up changing my pants from playing it in the dark, then walking in the dark to bed.        &nbsp;

						   They updated the baby's medicing last night.  I'm not sure if it was because of the higher dosage, but she slept through the night. I got up to feed her at about 3:30 to make sure that she wasn't hungy because every once in a while she sounded restless but when I checked on her each time she seemed to be asleep. She also took the whole bottle that I gave her, so that was good. Lately she hasn't been gaining weight like she should but just recently she started eating more.

						   1 hour of total sleep composed of two 30 minute segments.  I'm so tired I'm dizzy.  I had to send the baby ahead to the doctor without me. If I go to work, I'll be going in late. For now it's back to bed.

						   I just finished a 4 hour stint of studying. This is in addition to a 3 hour total for earlier today... 7 hours in one day and I'm wiped...  It's my night to feed and take care of the baby when she wakes up. It's going to be a rough day tomorrow for sure. The baby has a 7 a.m. doctors appointment. I guess I'll pack a can of Red Bull in my lunch bag.

						   Well her collar bone is broken alright. I never knew how swollen a shoulder could get. My mom only weighs about 90 poulds, but it looks like she has a shulder from a lineman. It's also all black and blue.  They wanted to send her to a nursing home, but she refused. Instead she will stay in the hospital for a few days then they will send her home. That's all I need right now because I'll have to run back and forth to look after her. I've already got so much on my plate, I'm not sure how to deal with this too...

						   I got a call during the night that my mom is in the hospital again. There was a fire alarm at her place and when she went outside her wheeled walker got away from her. On the phone they said that her collar bone was broken and she had a large bump on her head.  I'm on my way to visit her now. I hope she'll be ok.
