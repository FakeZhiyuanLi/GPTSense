      Sadie is doing much better now.  I took her back to the vet for a check yup.  Her ear is looking a lot better.  I'm going to have to put drops in her ears for another 2 days then one week off then another week of drops.  She was a lot better this time.  She didn't hiss or growl as much.  That made me feel better.

      My Cat Sadie has a real bad ear infection.  Boy was she pissed at me when I had to wrap her up in a blanket so the vet could clean her ear.  She hissed and growled at me.  After I got her home I had to treat her to some good wet food.    Sadie is a great cat.  She talks a lot.  Sometimes too much.  I have to hold her like a baby for about 20 minutes after I get home or she yells at me for an hour.  I rescued her from the Feline Foundation a cool non-kill shelter.  She sleep behind my knees or right net to my belly under the covers.  She is a little heater.  The vet told me to use some drops in her ears for the next 4 days.  If ther is no improvement they will have to do sugery.  I hope it doesn't come to that.  I gave her some treats before I left back to work.

      Well the boy called me last night and told me that he would be writing me an email.  Well I looked in my In box and there was no email.  I can say I'm a bit dissapointed.  I was really looking forward to reading he reply to my last email.  I'm just being overly emotional.  I guess I just want people to do what they say they are gonna do.  I'm just as guilty for not following thru too.  I guess I should work on that in my self before I start making comments about others.  I'm not wanting to go to work today.  I just wanna chill at home and veg on the couch.  But that is not healthy.  I hope he calls or writes to me sometime today.  Well time to get dressed and head to work....

      Ahhhhhh I feel much better.  I got my house cleaned, got my laundry done.  I had 7 loads of laundry.  OMG it took so long.  It took almost 2 hours.  So I'm hoping to hear from this boy who is suppost to call me.  I hope he calls.  So now I'm just gonna relax at home.  Things are getting better, working through emotions.  Watching Millionaire.  It's kinda dumb..... Well I'm off.

      Man what a day already, had a meeting with the county health department.  Lots of stuff going on.  I sit at my desk and think about where I was a year ago and where I am now.  I have my own place, I have a great job, I have great friends, I'm back in Fresno which is not bad but not good either.  I miss the City.  I miss the people there.  I sometimes think that I'm gonna be stuck here.  Who knows.  I have to get stuff done at home tonight.  I need to do dishes and lots of laundry.    Sometimes durning my day, I drift off to a place in my brain where things are perfect.  My question is how do you make those things come to real life.   I have a guy that I have known for years finally tell me he has feelings for me.  I'm excited but also worried.  I don't wanna be jumping from the frying pan into the fire.  We have a lot of talking to do.  I will admit that I had a crush on him from the first time we met.  But alas I felt like I was below him, not in the same class.  He is well educated and knows the finer things of life.  I'm just a middle class kinda guy.    Well I needed to get something of my chest before I get back to work.  Lets see what happens.

The pain in my heart is so unbearable.  I just let out deep sobs of pain.  You have no idea what you mwnt to me or how much I loved you.  You now tell me you didn't love me and probably never would.    You questioned Did I care, you can ask anyone, I even said you were my great one, now it's over but I do admit I'm sad it hurts real bad I can't sweat that because I loved the hoe...  Love sucks, the one time I let someone in completely and I get hurt and burned.  The brick wall has been reinforced around my heart.

      This weekend was the most fun and the most dramatic weekend I have ever had.  I got to see my favorite DJ spin in SF and broke up with my boyfriend the same weekend.  Karma is sometimes a real bitch.  I just really need a hug.    I'm thankful for having such a close knit group of friends.  I thank the higher power everyday for them.  When I need a place to have fun, chill, or a shoulder to cry on, they are there.  I hope by having this place to vent I well feel better.  HUGZ & Kisses Franco

      Well damn what a month.  I'm probably moving again.  I need to get the hell out of fresno!  Well let me think where to start.  Well I have been spending time with this guy named Robb.  He is so damn Hot!  I really enjoy his company.  He maked mee feel special.  I have been going to Sacramento the past couple weeks.    Well he came here to spend the weekend with me.  While we were out at one of the gay bars here, drama had to follow.  I was there about 30 seconds and walked out to the back patio and there it started.  There was a guy there that has a lot of anger towards me.  I got caught having sex with his BF who was my ex from a long time ago.  Yes I do accept that I messed up and apologized for like 4 months for it.    Well as I walked out to the back patio, he looks right at me.  "OH Shit, I could have gone the whole night without seeing this mother fucker!"    I turned around and walked right back into the bar.  I told Rob that we maybe leaving early.  Lucky for me I hade my two bestfriends there with me.  HA HA HA john asked if I was ready to get into a fight.  I was like, there is no need.  Well he as in my ex's new BF walks in and walks right up to me and squares up to me, so I'm thinking that he wants to BOX.  Well he comes over and is like, what the fuck is up.  I'm like I heard you talkin shit in the back patio so instead of going out there and getting not a fight with you, I just walked back in here and I'm just chillin.   We talk and he's like, well my ex his BF told him you better get over this, because Franco (me) will be in my life and you better get used to him being around.  Swell.     We hugged and got over it.  Come to find out....he my ex's BF had messed around on him.  And he told me the only reason he was mad about catching up having sex, was because we didn't invite him to join us.   Fast Forward.....   So I worked late on friday night then was out at Fresno Gay Pride and was handing out condoms.  So since I worked over time, I took monday off from work.  I had a horrible foot infection.  I had to go to the hospital.  They had to lance my toe open to get the infection out.  I was suppost to be off for the rest of the week.  The doctor gave me a note for work.  I came in on wednesday to drop my note off at work.  I was off wednesday and thursday.  My boss called me 10 am on friday.  She told me that I needed to be at work that my doctors note covered tuesday wednesday and thursday.  Well since I had gone to the hopsital on tuesday, the bitch counted tuesday as one of my days off.  HELLO I went after work.  Well I took a shower and came in.  When I got in I was asked into my boss's office.  She gave me a write up for taking the monday off.  Then she told me that we had not recieved and information on a new youth contract.  So I'm lossing my job.  Well then after getting this news I fell into a deep depression.  Lucky for me, Robb convinced me to go to SAC.  So I went.  I had a great time with him.  I'm falling in-love with him.  I get back just before midnight sunday.  I get up the next morning and get ready to head to work, and my truck was broken into.  The bastards took my stereo, and thru my paper work from my glove box and papers from behind the seat all over my carport.  I spent 20 mins picking it up.  I'm not a happy camper.  But look on the bright side this weekend is a pool party weekend, Robb is coming to stay with me this weekend.  Drama Drama and More Drama.

      Well what did I get my self into?  Let me break it down for you.  I moved from Fresno to Sacramento.  Before I got here, I had already secured a job.  My job is fun, busy, and can work your last nerve.  All I have to say is please be nice to the person that is schedueling your appointment.   So now here is where it gets interesting.  I'm living with this guy.  I'm sort of dating him, sort of live-in boyfriend, but yet not boyfriends, oh and I live with his ex too.  So I'm really kind of like a third wheel.  Well the guy that I "dating" has some anger problems.  Let's face it we all have our issues, but he can take them to an extreme.   Well there have already been a couple times I have asked myself what did I get myself into?  I really really like him a lot I could say even to the point of saying that I'm falling for him.  But each time one of these tantrums happens, I think oh shit, I have no place to go if all of this blows up in my face.  I don't have any local friends that I could fall back on.   I hate sometimes being a realist.  Knowing that things don't always work out.  I know that I have my own issues to deal with and I'm not sure I want to take on someone else's.  I really do care for him, because when he is doing good, he is one of the most kindest, loving, caring person, he makes my heart melt, but when he is bad, Oh My God, can he cut you with his looks and his comments, and his ability to make you feel like nothing like you don't excist.  I just felt the need to vent.
