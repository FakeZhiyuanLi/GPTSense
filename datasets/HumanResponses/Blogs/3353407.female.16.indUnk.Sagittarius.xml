      Well i got up this morning and went to school to take my chem final... i knew the best possible grade for me to make in the class was a C so i just did as good as i could... I ended up with a 77 on the final which makes the final grade a 77 for chem.  I just got home and my mom asked how it went... yeah i told her and she flipped out... but she can't say i didn't study because i've studied for the past two weeks.  Well its too late to do anything about it now... tomorrow i have my history final with hoyle and my spanish 3 final.  Im not too worried about history because i'd have to get a 98 to get an A and a 48 to get a B.  Theres no way i could get lower than a 48 so im not working on that as much as im thinking about spanish.  Its starting to hit me that school is ending tomorrow... in band its just wierd that david, nick, and brittney aren't there... and im not too excited to see all the little freshies move up either.  But i guess thats just how it goes, one class moves on with their lives while the next on is preparing to do the same.  I'm definitely going to be glad to be done with these finals though because im tired of the studying... but im going to miss seeing everyone every day.  Not to mention the fact that im leaving tomorrow night for my vacation.  My flight leaves at 7 to go to Orlando.  Me and the family are goin to Disney until the 28th and then we're going to the tween waters resort in Captiva.  Im glad that i get the chance to do stuff like this with my family but i hate that i have to leave the first day off.  Every single year we have to go on vacation at the earliest day possible.  I just wish i could bring everyone with me... but that kinda defeats the purpose of the family vacation.  Well other than that nothing else is goin on... just studying for those dumb exams... i think its a tradition for me to always say that next year is going to be different. Around this time every year i promise myself that im going to get all higher A's.  Im hopeing that my fear from not being accepted to FSU will help make that promise become a reality.  Speaking of grades i guess i've stalled long enough.. bring on the books.........

      This morning i got up and got ready for church in about 30 mins (an all-time record for me).  Today's sermon was all about money and how we need to spend more of it for god instead of materialistic things... well if i had money then i'd probably be able to put it towards god, but i can't give what i don't have so i guess i'll just have to do what i can later.  We came home and it was raining so of course my dad said that i won't be driving in the rain... i'm hopeing that it stops raining and drys up a little so i can drive to church and meet stephen.  Now im just hanging out and getting ready for the week ahead of me.  I've got my oral part of my spanish 3 exam tomorrow, my chem exam on wednesday, and my history and written part of the spanish exam on thursday.  Then im leaving thursday night for our vaca to FL.  Well i'd write more but i better go study.  I forgot my history book at school so i have to go hurt someone down who has one.  I'll post again before bed.

         Today was a fairly decient day.  I got up early after spending the night at rhea's and went home cuz she had a denist appointment.  Then i went to the gym biked 12 miles... and wasn't too inspired to walk or run on the tred mills so i just went on to the muscle machines.  Then i came home and started to wash my car.  I was talking to my grandma and i missed Stephen's call by about 2 mins... so i called him back and he said that he was having fun but wanted to see me... yeah i know "awwwwwwwww" So then me and rhea met nick and joe at taco stank.  It was cool hanging out at good old taco bell again.  Then i came home and i've been sitting around doing nothing waiting to hear from stephen... he's going to call within the next hour so it will be good to hear from him.  Well im gonna try to stay awak that long... i shall return.

      Saturday was a good yet bad day.  I got up and went to the gym.  It'd been waaay too long since i'd been.  I biked 10 miles, walked 2 miles, and did all my other muscle machines.  It felt pretty good to be in there again.  Then I came home and got cleaned up and stephen came over for a couple hours before i had to go babysit.  It was really nice seeing him.  Then i went to work and they got home around 11:30 which was around when stephen was suppose to be laoding the bus. So i went to his church to say goodbye.  It was good to see him go but i knew i'd miss him.  He told me that he'd call sunday when he got to daytona.  So sunday morning i woke up and sat around and did nothing.  It was nice... it was the first time this entire summer that i just got up and sat on the couch for a while.  I was expecting him to call me around 1 or 2 so you can only imagine how worried i was when i hadn't heard from him until close to five.  But it was good to hear that he was ok and having fun.  Then i had to pick my little brother up from one party and take him to another.  After that i went to rhea's to spend the night.  It was really great seeing her and talking again... it seems like it was forever since we'd seen eachother.  We talked about everything, guys, movies, our vacations, guys, religion, shopping, guys.... yeah that pretty much covers it.  LOL Nick came over and watched the last half of my best friends wedding with us and we got to hang out.  Then to my surprise stephen called again last night.  It was kind of wierd though cuz we were just talking about him and then the phone rang.  But i was happy (as always) to hear from him.  He said that he'd try to call today but he wasn't sure... he'd definitely call tomorrow tho.  So that brings you to today... im about to go to the gym.  FUN FUN! lol im trying to get myself back into the habit of going because its getting harder and harder to make myself get in the car and drive over there.  Well i'll be back....

      Friday was a long day... I woke up and went right outside to tan for a while. Soon enough sarah called and was on her way over to tan with me.  It was cool to see her again and be able to talk like we used to.  Stephen had been working hard to fix his grandma's lawn mower, fix his car, and finish the trailor for his mom for the past two days and i hadn't been able to see him much.  He stopped by on the way to his grandma's to say hello.  I thought he'd be able to do something that night once he finished his work so i made him leave so he'd get done faster.  Well he wasn't able to get much done and that night Lynn made him go to scott and shelby's recital.  I felt bad because he was mad at lynn and we couldn't do anything that night.  Plus he didn't even get inside the recital because there were so many people there.  So we didn't end up doing anything really that day.  ANYWAYS, Then sarah left and i kept tanning -and yes tanning can be fun, its not boring at all- and about 20 mins later davy boy calls and comes over to hang out.  It was good to catch up with him too because since things have been over with him and sarah we haven't really been able to talk.  The rest of the day was pretty uneventful...

      Yesterday was sarah's b-day.  I got up and went swimming with stephen for a while before he had to go to work and then i went shopping for sarah's gift.  My mom ended up comming with me cuz she said she'd pay for my gas since i was low on cash after getting sarah's gift. My cash is disappearing faster and faster each day...not fun when you have a limited income...Anyways- We went to a bunch of places and ran some errands for her and picked up my little sister from her friends house.  I ended up getting sarah this pretty bracelet and earrings.  I liked them.  Then i went to walmart to get her card. By the time i got home i had maybe 5 mins before i went out to dinner with sarah and her family.  It was pretty good. We went to macaroni grill and one of the waiters sang to her in italian.  He was awesome.  Then i came home and stephen came back over.  Nick wanted us to come over and hang out for a while so we went over for a few minutes before coming home and watching a movie.  After stephen left i came upstairs and got ready for bed.  then stephen called my cell (which i found out that i get free mins after 10 at night...YAY) and we talked for a couple hours until i was about to fall asleep.  This summer is goin really good for me... im staying busy and seeing alot of my friends.  Now its off to the dentist-but this time its for my brother and not me.. haha

      Well yesterday was a great day compared to monday.  I got up and went to get my car and pick up my dog from the vet.  I wasn't crazy about the fact that i had to take my car to get Bowden because now i have dog fur all over the back of my car.  But im going to have to wash it some time soon anyways so i guess i'll deal with the dog hair.  Then i got to see stephen!  It felt like i hadn't seen him in a really long time, but it felt so good to be back and hug him.  We went to burger king for lunch and then we went to Shelton park.  There was a man who was flying a gas powered remote control airplane with his son.  It was fun to watch them try so hard to fly it and then finally get it into the air for about a minute before it crashed.  I missed him so much... Ever since our one month i've had mixed emotions... i mean i really care about him no doubt... he makes me so happy whenever we're together... but sometimes i feel like i should be holding myself back.. i guess its just because my other relationship didn't last much longer than a month... i just don't want to lose what i have now but its like my brain is telling me not to get too attached because i don't want to hurt as much as i did last time.  Maybe its just the fact that i was gone for so long.  Its hard though because i really care about him but its like deep down i know that theres a high chance that i could get hurt again.  Things changed for me and brandon in a minute, and thats what scares me.  The fact that he could want someone else or care about someone else and i could be hurt again scares me.  Im getting better about it the more im around stephen and the more i get to know him.  I just don't know much else other than being used and left and i really hope that he changes that.  I know that we're only in high school but the fact is that i really care about him and he's always going to be in my heart -if not as my bf, just as b is now- I just hope that things go better for me with stephen.  I don't want to think of how things could happen and how he could want to leave.   ANYWAYS- back to yesterday.... Last night after we went to the park stephen had to go to his mom's and then mow his yard.  I went to see my brother's game and then me and sarah met joe, philip and nathaniel at the movies to see the day after tomorrow.  It was a pretty good movie, i was just glad i got to see some of the drumline again.  Then i came home and talked to stephen for about about 2 and a half hours.  Im feeling a little better about the two of us because as each day passes i feel like i can trust him a little more.  Theres nothing he's hiding from me and that makes me feel better about us.  Well i'll post tonight before bed.  This summer im gonna post everyday.  I'll be back later!

      It feels like its been forever since i posted.  Alot has happened since then so im going to get my blog upto date before it gets any worse.  Well i took my finals and wasn't so excited to find that i got a 61 on hoyles, but i felt a little better when i got a 83 on my spanish3 exam.  Anyways school was finally over and me and sarah went to chick-fil-a for lunch.  It was really good to just be us again.  Since she and david broke up, i've worried that i'd lose her friendship.  But now that we've seen eachother more i know it just takes us keeping intouch.  Anyways, after lunch we went to the card store and i got stephen a card that he could open once i'd left for my vacation.  I was feeling so bad that i had to be the first one to leave and i had to leave that very night.  But before i took sarah home, we wrote the card and then we delivered it... haha it was so funny because we were going to just put it in his mail box but she wanted to put in in his car so she ran all the way up his drive way, threw the card in his car window, and ran back to the car yelling for me to hurry because stephen's little brother saw her.  Later i asked stephen what scot (his little brother) said about it and he said that scott just came in and said "i just saw your girlfriend" but in that mocking voice that ppl who don't have bfs or gfs use to make fun of you.  So i took sarah home and then stephen came over for a while just to hang out before my flight left.  On the way down we had a direct flight and we were in this little bitty plane.  Im not a big fan of planes, much less the little ones that you have to go outside to climb those little steps to board the plane on.  We arrived in orlando aroud 1 their time (midnight our time) and picked up our rented van.  Then we went to the condo where we were staying and slept until 10.  The first full-day there we went to typhoon lagoon.  (i don't remember a whole lot of specifics...) The next day we went to Magic Kingdom where my brother and sister where two big chickens and we didn't get to ride Splash Mountain cuz they were too scared. But i did see a street band with an awesome drummer.  He had all kind of crash cymbals and double bass and everything-granted he was no Jeff Queen-but he was pretty good for a theme park player.  The day after that we went to Epcot.  It really sucks because they stopped the ride in the Seas and they got rid of alot of the good shows that used to be in the Land.  BUt they did have this new ride that was alot of fun.  Its called mission space and its a simulator ride.  YOur put into groups of four and your assigned different jobs-navigator, engineer, commander or pilot.  So you get into the simulator and theres a dash board that comes in toward you closing you in the seats.  It had a movie that you watch and each person had two main buttons to press are specific times that correlated to the movie.  I liked it because it was like that old centerfuge ride that the space and rocket center where the whole thing spins so fast you can feel the g-forces when you take off and land.  Me and my brother must have ridden that ride atleast 15 times... it was pretty fun. That night we were listening to Paul Revere and the Raiders-they were really big back when the beatles were popular and i got an autographed picture and cd.  I thought that was cool. After the band played my dad told me that the next day we were going to Discovery Cove. (thats the place where you can go swim with the dolphins and fish) I was so excited.  That place was so much fun.  And the best part, besides the dolphin, was that they limit the number of ppl they let into the Cove so it wasn't crowded.  It was really fun swimming with the dolphin.  My dolphin was named JC and the trainer taught me all these signs to get him to do different tricks.  One thing i got him to do was to give me a kiss.  Well after my interaction with the dolphin, my mom got a cd disk with a picture of me kissing the dolphin.  That night i thought it'd be cute of me to send the picture to stephen with a little note on it.  The note said that i still cared about him but i'd met a guy(meaning JC) and that i'd spent the day with him and we ended up kissing.  CUTE huh?  NOt really, stephen couldn't download the picture. So here he is worried that i'd really met someone because i never said that it was the dolphin in the e-mail.  I felt horrible for the rest of the vacation. He finally got his e-mail to work and then he said that he felt kinda slow for not realizing that it was the dolphin.  I felt soooo mean.  Its all alright now tho.  Back to my vacation..... the next day we went to MGM and rode the rockin roller coaster about 20 times - fun stuff. I thought that it was cool yet kinda wierd that i was recongized by this guy while i was getting on the roller coaster.  He was talking about the drumline and how he enjoyed the show this past year.  He asked me a bunch of questions and then said that he looked forward to seeing us next year.  I remember that he was from Georgia but i have no clue what school he went to. Its good to know that our line is known, we're not an unknown line anymore, YAY! That night my dad took me down to Pleasure Island.  It was pretty fun but there were too many cops around and too many drunk people.  We went to two different clubs before getting dinner and going home.  I just liked the fact that me and my dad had time to do something just the two of us.  He's always working and i don't get to see him much when we're home so it was just fun to hang out.  Then we went to Blizzard Beach the next day.  And the last day in Orlando we went to Sea World.  Over all i had fun in Orlando, but it would have been nice to see some old friends while i was there.  The day we went to sea world, we drove down to Ft Myers to see my uncle chuck and aunt terry.  I was so glad to see my cousin kelly!  She just graduated high school this year and it was just good to talk to someone within a few years of me. (by this time i'd already had plenty of the oh-so-loved family time and was ready to get back to my friends.)We hung out friday night and then saturday morning we went to the mall.  We were only suppose to be looking for shoes but she ended up getting a 3rd hole in her ear.  It's so not fair because her parents wouldn't even  notice.  But that took us an extra hour cuz she had to pick out some new jewelry and a new belly button ring.  Then we drove down to Captiva.  I was just happy that we had some time to hang out.  Captiva was pretty fun.  It felt like it lasted waaay more than 3 days but i was just anxious to get home.  We went to captiva to see all my dad's college buddies-who i call aunt or uncle, they're not related, just friends.  These guys were completely crazy-but they're fun to hang out with.  For pretty much the entire weekend all of them were drunk.  Its kind of sad because ALL of us had been drinking... but im proud to say that my parents were the most sober of all of the adults.  I got to have many a mudslides, magaritas, and dak-a-ries (can't spell) last weekend.  But the funniest thing of all was that the night before we came home all the adults went out to dinner-inturn dumping ALL the kids on me to babysit- and got really wasted.  My rents weren't drunk at all but they didn't trust themselves to drive back so they called me and my cousin ryan(he's also 16 and in my opinion looks just like bogan but more muscular) to come get them.  So it was kind of funny, kind of scary that me and ryan had to go get them but atleast they all made it back safely.  So Monday i wake up at 7 FL time -6 our time- and we went to the air port just to find that our first flight was delayed by about 3 hours.  We didn't get out of Ft myers until 1 or so.  Then because of our last delay we missed our flight from atlanta so we had to wait another 2 and a half hours just to get from atlanta to huntsville.  The day was not a good one.  We didn't get to huntsville until around 7.  To top it all off, the air lines lost my entire family's bags.  That made my dad sooooo mad.  He was suppose to leave yesterday morning-the morning after we got home- on a business trip and he needed his bag.  They finally found our bags and the air lines delivered them that night. Thats my vacation for you.  Im gonna write for tomorrow and today on another post because this one is getting really long.  Overall i had a really great vacation.  It makes me sad to think that i only have two more with my family before i leave for college.
