      actually i did not hate that egg thief from the day that she stole my eggs from that day onwards... it started on 14th may... which is malcolm's bdae...... after skool, we went out and and had our meal at mac... we had our meal and mal started opening his present... it was layer after layer... sianz... the present was undesirable for mal went through all the trouble to open that present he recieved... after that... we went outside mac to play flour... it was not very nice as the egg thief kept aiming me with the flour she had at hand over at the playground behind mac....... i went all white and she said that she was not aiming me... if she was not aiming at me and i was all white... wtf who could it be except her?????

      for those who may not know the story and wish to know it... i will try to "yi wu yi shi de shuo chu lai" it was a fine day at school when a gang of 1/4 kids decided to go to adina's house to enjoy the company of some dogs(prince,cutie and charming)... we trotted very slowly as it was a very hot day then... we stopped at the bus stop and waited for the bus... Vrooooooom.... the bus came we&nbsp; got on and chatted very happily throughout the journey... when we alighted at the bus stop opposite the hong kah grc.... we again slowly walked to adina's house as the heat was unbearable that day.... we stopped by a mama shop and did some 'looking shopping' a few bought nothing but a very handsome and very thin(very sarcastic though...) bought ten eggs at price of $1.50 which is $0.15 per egg... he paid the money happily and rushed up to adina house to meet the dogs at her house... den wei zheng, very hungry at the moment, fisrt thing he did was to go into the kitchen and prepare the things he needed for cooking the eggs he had at hand... when wei zheng finished preparing the utensils he needed, Jolyn came about and asked wei zheng wether she could cook first... wei zheng, being very gentlemanly(again very sarcastic), allowed Jolyn to cook first... jolyn also wanted to fry eggs, so she took all of wad adina had left at her house which only amounts to 2.... i went out to play with the dogs... she started to add in the eggs which she had beaten... den she say the frying pan got too much oil... so she took the already beaten eggs by wei zheng which amounts to 3 into her fryin pan(i already told her beforehand that nobody should touch the eggs when she was starting to cook and she agreed...)... i came in when she called me in to cook... i found out that my chicken eggs are missing... den a VERY innocent looking Jolyn said that she had used up her eggs... i asked her why... den she said there was too much oil added to the frying pan which was prepared by me... den i told her,"eh, why dont u throw away some of the oil until it is left until the desired amount?" who is in the wrong?

      jolyn is so bad... she told her godbrother about me... but she is in the wrong... her godbrother does not know that she is in the wrong... she stole eggs from me and she did not tell me... if she told me that she needed those eggs... if she told me that she needed those eggs i would surely give it to her... as we were in good terms at that moment... after stealing my eggs, we became arch-enemys from then... now, she and her godbrother both think that i am in the wrong discriminating jolyn all the time... especially during the last day of both miss tans teaching... i really would be REALLY good friends wif her if she had asked me she wanted those eggs to eat... I DUN LIKE HER...
