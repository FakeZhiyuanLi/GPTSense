       A man named Joe wanted to go visit his brother is Pittsburgh...He decides to take the train...  He goes to the train station and sees a woman at the ticket counter with extremly large breasts...He cant help  but stare...so he walks up to the counter and  trys to play it cool...and says, "I would like 1 picket to Titsburg..." He apoligises and boards the train...  Joe is bummed out and has a sad face on...he sits down..and the man in the seat next to him asks whats wrong...Joe replys with the story...  the man sits and ponders that for a moment then replys.."some times i mean something and say another...like this morning..i meant to say to my wife...could you pass the salt?....but i said...YOU F*CKING B*TCH YOU RUINED MY LIFE...
