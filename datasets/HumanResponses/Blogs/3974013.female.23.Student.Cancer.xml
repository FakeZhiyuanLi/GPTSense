       urlLink    Recognize this sign? Think Seinfeld. It's really called Tom's Restaurant (they just cut the Tom part out for the show). Walked all the way from 30 something street to 112th just to eat dinner here. Inside it looks completely different from the show. I hear there's another restaurant in NYC that they used to film the show. &nbsp; urlLink

Some appropriate offerings are...incense, candles, money, roosters, tortillas, rum, cigars, silk scarves, coca-cola, citrus-scented perfume and herbs. &nbsp; urlLink

       urlLink    I met up with Angie (we went to UM together) in Antigua the previous night. We spent that day together at the toro. We were the only two white people on the fence, let alone, part of the minority of women that were not in the stands.  &nbsp; urlLink
