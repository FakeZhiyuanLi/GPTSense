      Already I've become idle and stopped blogging....  Today I accepted the challenge of tutoring a *stats* course for first years! Am I insane? I hate stats! St. Petersburg in 3 days :) VODKA HAHAHAHAHAHA! Don't know why the thought of vodka makes me happy, but I'm glad it does.

      My first post, on 9/11 of all days.   My previous record for keeping any sort of record of my life lasted a few weeks at most, the latter half of entries rambling on about "not having done anything". I now see the error of my ways, as by simply including things like "Had 2 dumps today" or "saw Sabrina the Teenage Witch, became aroused", I could easily fill up a blog. Also, I have hit upon the idea of blogging out things that didn't happen, since it's not like all this is of significance anywhere.  Right, best go do something :)  I wanna dress as a pirate, a camp one at that.

      Whilst looking adoringly at my blog, I couldn't help but notice that those lovely chaps at google were advertising "pest control" on the ad above my blog. Clearly they wish to destroy all wasps and thus my livelihood. And they said I was mad when I suggested Google was run by a sinister gang of bee loving scientists...

      Work is boring.  Finding it hard to motivate myself to write a literature review on Polistes wasps. It'd probably only take me a few days to expand on my previous review, but I still would rather look at pseudo-pornographic pictures of meat on the net than actually do it. My wasps are still alive (well, one nest of them anyway) and the parasites still kick ass. But not much I can do with them other than feed and water them. Suppose I could release them into the air conditioning vents, bwahahaha.    Gonna hit the showers early today, read up on St. Petersburg so I'm prepared for when I go next week :)  Geoff Capes.

      Having read some other blogs, I feel safe in the knowledge that no matter how boring I make this, I'll still be in good company. I've already seen what basically, after 1 month of reasonable blogging, amounts to a "breakfast blog" i.e. "Today I had *2* slices of toast and some honey, it was nice". Clearly in the top trumps world of blogging, a log of arousal beats breakfast hands down.  I have been tempted to use the "p.s. I am w**king as I write this" signature in tribute of the wonderful TMWRNJ, but i don't think anyone would get it.

      Drank far too much beer last night with my good friend Tom, now I feel the pain from such decadance.  Got a party tonight and I think it'll be me in the corner with the mug of Horlicks and a nice cosy blanket...

      As predicted, my entries have become almost non-existant. I wish I could blame a hectic social life, but sadly the pursuit of slackery is the culprit...

      ...but now is the time for a quick blog...  George Best gets a new liver and *still* binges on booze. What a twat! He might claim that alcoholism is a disease, but the stupid motherfucker should be getting treatment for it then, and not poisoning a liver which could have been used to give someone else a few more years. In my opinion he's an arsehole and no matter how well he once played football he'll remain one until he finally acts responsibly.  It just pisses me off so much that he could do something so pathetic.  Grrrrrrrr

      A lot of people have shown disgust at Johnny taking part in something so commercial, some accuse him of "selling out" the punk ideal. I don't agree.  The punk questions what is being sold to it, tries to see the true intent behind the news fed to it. It is cynical, often overly so. But at its heart there is an overwhelming love of humanity, and an acceptance of its flaws. It is the exploitation of these flaws that punk rages against so much.  One of the first things that the media zoomed in on with punk was this rage, as it was both exciting (and hence drew in the viewers) and dangerous. What it rarely did was show the human side of punk, something which I think John Lydon is doing now. He is on a primetime show and is acting the most sensibly and entertainingly of all the "celebs". People who have previously written him off as some mindless violent thug who just shouts instead of singing etc. will now have to challenge this view. If they can identify with him then perhaps they might re-evaluate punk as well. This can't be a bad thing.  Song of the day:- Human Punk by Miss Black America

      http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/3936463.stm  Pesticide levels 'high in fruit'. In accordance with EU directives, previously labelled "Fruit, high in pesticides" have been renamed to indicate their main ingredient.   Of course, I'm probably being a proto-pedant and misreading it. IT probably means that there's so much synthetic chemical matter being sprayed onto fruit nowadays that one can obtain a "high" from it should one wish to go out licking the Marks and Waitescoburys fruit section.

      http://www.nme.com/news/109251.htm  The BPI continue their crusade against "music piracy" with this further piece of evidence that online file swapping is robbing the artists, raping their wives and children and then burning down their villages. Oh no! Music sales have only increased by 2.1% in the past year! Oh no, they're at the highest they've been for ages!  But wait a minute....this is for *album* sales... And bugger me if online sales of music mean that people are more likely to buy certain tracks and not albums, thus skewing the data accordingly as people buy *more* music but *less* albums.  The BPI are acting hysterically over something which probably promotes music much more effectively than advertising ever did. Hype is generated by filesharers about albums that are genuinely good, and this no doubt leads many sharers to buy the albums, and also influence their friends into doing so. The only reason for the BPI to be worried is if it were linked to advertisers, promoters and other people who don't figure in the artistic process of making music, but do like a nice fat slice of the cash generated by it. Bugger me if that's exactly what they are.  I predict the next claim will be on the lines of  "CD piracy causes global warming" or "Pope killed by counterfeit Steps cd"

      Saw the 'Spree' last night, was mightily impressed with their new multicoloured robe setup. The songs from the new album were nicely done, carrying over themes from the last one to great effect. I think the new songs are more solid and structured, relying less on repetition yet still giving the impression that the Scientologists have somehow subverted pop in an effort to indoctrinate the young and impressionable.   After seeing them, I got thinking. Just how many of the new bands coming out have resorted to having 30 odd members? Has it always been this way? Was there a "Take That" Crew that spawned the well known and revered boy band?  I did a search on google, but after removal of the usual "the, is , of" etc. it came up with a search for "Music Bands Large Members" and a whole deluge of Motley Crue websites, as well as sites devoted to the "Big Band" movement.  It's so intriguing that I'm going to track down one of those music enyclopedias and find out who is/was the band with the largest number of active members live on stage (thus ruling out any Live Aid collaboration).  Finally, a use for the blog!

      Today I saw my coffee machine die. The cracked pot spewed forth all the love I had invested in it, leaving me spoilt and decaffeinated. I am forced now to cast her aside in the pursuit of another, hopefully one with an espresso function and a milk frother...  I drink my coffee black in mourning.

      This is a test message, seeing if I can actually publish on the blog via e-mail. I shall attempt to avoid Ronatkinsonising by removing the microphone from my comuter now. There, it's off. He's a flipping lazy little blogger that Edd. Oh poo, is this still on...
