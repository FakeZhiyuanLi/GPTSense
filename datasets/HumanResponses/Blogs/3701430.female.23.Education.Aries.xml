      So on break from essays actually ventured into the big wide world (well, Tottenham Court Rd, scary enough for me) I spotted a rather noteworthy set of port-a-loos sitting in the middle of Bloomsbury Square. If port-a-loo is the right word, these were special, these were classy, these were posh port-a-loos. From the  urlLink  IGLOO   company.  They are weird, so are kind of hard to describe. Imagine tacky hotel toliets ripped out of their natural habitat and supplanted in the middle of a road. Mmmmmm, when I say tacky hotel, a mean like quite a posh tacky hotel, or at least one that prides itself on its appearence, like Falwty Towers maybe. They had wallpaper. Wallpaper, not dissimilar to the stuff in the Big Brother Bedsit. Silver handals and a seporate wash-basin section with Molton Brown quirty liquid handsoap thingies, no less. Wish I'd had my camera (so need to set up photos on this thing). They were obviously set up for an event, and were still wrapped in plastic.   A quick vist to the IGLOO website (noted down URL emblazened on the outside of their van) tell me these are the "ultimate temporary loos". Apparently they use "vacuum technology" to avoid the whole chemical thing and you can choose from "Traditional Georgian Style", "Egyptian Cotton Style" or "Contemporary Oak Style" - I can't tell which of these was the one I spotted as there website's a bit poo and kept sending me to "page not found"s. They work all over the world, and trendy-toilets that they are they supply to London Fashion Week. They even do bespoke.   And on this point, I'd like to send out a big "good luck" to anyone using the bogs at  urlLink Glasto  this weekend. Have a good one!

      mmmm, not that impressed.  Only ones in library, so have to go up stairs, along, then down some others. They STINK of air freshener (so much, hard to breathe, and the IoE library is stuffy at best of times). Anyway, went through small cubicle into main bit and was (for once) almost thankfull of the air freshener.   The first cubicle was already inhabited. And eminating from it was strong smell.   Not of useual toilet smells, more a sweaty, not very hygenic kind of smell.     Anyway, the middle one was blocked so had to go for number three, which has a cracked loo seat. When you sit on it, the seat expands, thus making gap in said crack wide enough for some flesh to squeeze into it. when you stand up though, the seat contracts, catching a bit of your skin in it.   this seat has been like that for 9 months at least now.  But the smell left with the first cubicle's inhabitant. And sinks were ok. Not greasy like they sometimes are. and surface area by sinks was clean.

      OK went to a public loo this morning.  Institute of Education, ones above the Student Union. Needed an excuse to leave the library for a bit, and went on way to buy coffee. They have very thin cubicles which makes the proces of getting in and closing the door rather difficult, especially when laden with book bag and gym kit.   There was a drip of liquid (unknown) on the back of the seat.   But loo roll in appropriate abundance, the sink wasn't blocked (though did take a while to drain) and nothing smeared on the walls, and choice of rolling-cloth thing or hand-dryer.  No graffiti, which was annoying in a loo so small that its hard to bring reading material in with you.
