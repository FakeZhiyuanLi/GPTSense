       ... Lets see ... I been a mess lately ... Like today i had a pop up .. and i got so pissed off i broke a pen and thew it acrossed the room. I dont know why i been acting like this but to me its just come naturaly. Its not a good thing. Ne-ways I have no way to fix it, I dont know whats cusing it. And then something happened and Yahoo ... was gone i kicked my chair and fell on the floor crying. Over nothing it was just a thing. I need to get checked. I think I'm a fucking nut. They are going to send me to 45th Street. I am going to e locked up w/ my grandmother .. So i can even go more nuts, I truely need to get my shit striaght. But again I am to young to go fucking nuts. I am just 17 years old shouldn't this be happening when&nbsp;I am like 45? I dont know but ... Its nuts like I&nbsp;am nuts! I truely just need to blow some hot air and everything will me ok!. I hope I pray! ... I think I will be fine!... :D

       Ok, I have no idea where to start. I have like so much to say and that needs to be said. But I have nobody to say it too. Like I dont wanna sound like a whiney lil 5 year old, But Its not like that at all. I just need to tell someone other then Jon how I feel just to say it and get it off my mind but It will never get off my mind cuz he is always on my mind like 24/7 I dont think I will ever stop loving him. But one day I will have to get over this block in my life. I will probably I did it once I can totally do it again. I think. Ne-ways enough&nbsp;about Jon. Even if I miss him alot. But Ne-ways I try to be a friend, I try to be there for everyone no matter what, But they never seem to open up I want them to know that No matter what I am right there, Just for them. And I will try my hardest to be there but you know you cant always be there ur not perfect&nbsp;nor Superman. No matter what you do one day you wont be there for them. Which sucks but its life. Or maybe they just dont want to talk about it or to you. Thats something I guess I will have to live with. I have to learn that I can always be everyones listener I need to have a turn to have a voice and not just judgement .. I have a VOICE TO bastarders! lol But most of the time I dont wanan talk about it so its all good. Maybe I just need to like deal with the fact that Its better for me to bottle up everything, seems better like that. I am happier if i just dont think about them... It works me thats all that counts. I just need to be myself and everything will be okies!:D hehe

        Well, Today I was talking to someone ... No names ... that i liked I dont even know what I saw in him hes 100% dick lol. I dont think I will ever found someone Like Jon... Or maybe I will, Hard to say. Ne-ways Lately I been thinking about Erin ... alot I really miss her. I wish she was never take from us, I know its been a year but I wish I would change what happened to her but I can. Its done and over with, I have to live with that forever. I never understand how someone can kill someone and they can get off with it like it never happened. This is not the first time he has DUI, it just dont make sense. I lady can "get" hit by a cop, The cop dies and its all her fault, Then she has to spend time in jail. I dont undertand the American Justice System at all. In my eyes its all bs. And a waste of taxes dollars. Just like other things around the world. Its all bs but nothing we can do about it, No person cant change the world, So we are just going to have to deal with idiots and retardes running the systems. Maybe one day it will all be taking care of and People will beable to have justice. Pretty soon the death of Erin will be forgotten by people, But not the people who truely care. I know I will never forget about her and what has happened to her. I guess thats all ... :) R.I.P Erin loves ya!:D 1986-2003

       Lets see ... Its been a normal ...&nbsp;day yet there is so much to say and let out in the open. But There is no way to do it, Cant let nobody know, But one day your going to have to let it all out no matter what you do, You have to yell it and maybe you can get on track, but again thats may never work, Your just a waiting time bomb just ticking waiting to pop. I know this is totally me, I have so much to say but never know when its the right time to say what I have to say. I wanna tell Jon, I love you, But thats just a waste of my time and words. He will never care like he used to!.&nbsp; Or Tell someone I have a huge crush on them and I cant live without talking to him, My live is better when he is around But I dont know if he feels the same, maybe I should just tell him how&nbsp;I feel. I will always be there for him no matter what! and To the person who dont know who he is I love you w/ all my heart and I cant stand not talking to you for a day!:)
