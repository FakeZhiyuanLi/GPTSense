      Hey ppl!....decided to finally give into peer pressure and put down my thoughts for the world to know.One word, scary. For a person who didn't keep a diary for the fear of someone finding out what really went through my head this my friend, is a big step.  Looks good so far. Spent ages picking out colors...(whaaaaaaat?!) and other 'useful' things like picking a nice title for the blog(typical fears of being associated with an 'uncool' blog title..:D...HEY! atleast I'm honest...sniff)....but then again that would totally depend on one's definition of 'cool'...  Ever watched 'ewoks'?...one of my favorite cartoons. Worshipped wicket and totally identified self with Kneesa....and for those of you who know me personally..NO the physical aspects have nothing in common...(HUMPF!)...  Just recovered from a very bad bout of illness and am a shadow of my former self!...In addition I was victim to a certain 'accident' that left my nose in need of plastic surgery....sniff! &lt;ouch&gt;....(naah...it's fine...just hurts when I twitch my nose..&lt;ouch&gt;...shouldn't do that)...so there...that my friends has been the kind of luck I have been experiencing. But did I cry?! did I fall!!? did I scream "kill me now and put me out of my misery??!(yes)....NO!...I hung in there,sipped my 'jeevani', rubbed my nose and said "Bring it on!"....  So there...!!

      Hey, I'm baaack!Kind of forgot for a while that I had a blog to update.What can I say,had some spider-man-like duties to attend to; Saving the world,Being modest etc.(:D)  Weekend was hectic.Mostly out of choice.Checked out 'Day after tomorrow'.Thought it was watchable.Despite the fact that the US was the only country with "enough computer power to analyse the collected data" and UK having a grand total of 3 ppl working on the Armageddon style scenario, marooned in some uninhabited land in Scotland with enough fuel to last them a grand total of 3 minutes!Sheesh!They killed off Japan in the first 5 minutes or so of the movie and voila!America to the rescue.&lt;Rolls eyes&gt; Ever watched independence Day?..Do you see a pattern here?  The most hilarious part of the movie(what?it's isn't a comedy??) was when good ol' "Mr.President" spends hours on the phone chatting with his wife or some such thing and gets himself killed trying to get out in the last minute.How duh is that??!  Real sorry if I'm ruining it for some of you who might have not watched it btw...(the pleasure is all mine..:D)  Nevertheless I enjoyed the eye candy(Jake Gyllenhaal)..Mmmm...

Its killing me here.Especially since I have a hectic evening coming up.No, it's nothing fun as such.Just one of those thigs you HAVE to do and get it over with.Not too thrilled about it.Too sleepy to even think abt travelling to any place other than home right now, but no such luck. Sigh.....  ohh and errr..did I mention SIGH!?

      Watched 'Snatch' yesterday(Kinda old I know).Interesting;Crude,but intresting.If the morbid just fascinates you then it's the movie for you.Pretty funny actually.Like Brad Pitt in it.NOT related to his rear in anyway as opposed to his latest 'unveiling' in Troy. Been indulging in a movie binge these couple of days,due to excessive time on hands(refer "hello world").  Watched a total of 5.33 movies(watched only 1/3 of Troy) in 3 days.Which averages pretty high for me.Jersy girl was so-so.Thought they'd done a good job in picking the little girl that resembles JLo to play her daughter.She does a pretty good imitation of her mother's jerk-neck-arguing.  Shrek 2 - one word, excellent.Loved "puz" &lt;pause&gt;"in boots"... Watched this other feel-good movie "Mrs.Winterbourne"...I know I know..There's nothing spetacular abt it at all.Just a regular boy-meet-girl.Got it solely because of Brendan Fraser.Forgive me father...for I have sinned!

      Feeling all undecided and aimless. I never thought I'd be happy to be stuck behind books and attending lectures but there...I said it....I miss having that. So I checked out some other stuff I can study but am now feeling lazy to sacrifice my weekend for that. Classic case of cake. I guess I'm one of those ppl that just cannot sit still for a minute and then complain I have no time for myself!  The Wait to see where my career is headed is killing me. Hate being in the dark. Forced to hang in there till September to decide on what I want to be doing for the next bit of my life. Want to do so many things, but my hands are tied. Sigh.

      Ever had moments where you thank your lucky stars thinking that you're spared of all the traits you dislike in your parents and you're blessed with only the good ? Well think again. You are exactly like your parents;the good AND the bad(Give or take a few traits of course) It's a package deal really....buy one and get it all free.  We hardly need cloning if you leave out the technicalities. You are already a replica of your parents whether you like it or not.Not that that's entirely a bad thing or anything.Infact in most cases it's a good thing.Only point I'm trying to get at are the little things that annoy us,but nevertheless subconciously indulge in ourselves.But maybe it's more nurture than nature  &lt;ponders&gt ;Could it be a case of imitation more than a case of genes?  Anyways there are certain traits that you need to work on regardless of it's origins. Sometimes simply because you know how it feels to be on the recieving end of it.
