      The more I talk to Reegan, the more I find out about her. I found out today that sometimes she goes to the concerts in the park. I figure that that might be a good a place as any to meet up. Her cousins supposedly teaching her how to skate tommorow.  I should really start that up again. Maybe if she picks it up Ill finally have someone to skate with! Im so glad we share the same kind of political veiws. Its so hard to find a girl in this place that isnt a total right wing hawk. The more I get to know her, the more I want to meet her.

      I dunno what to do....I dont want to look rude by not calling, but I allready called and she wasent there. I dont want to look rude by calling again. Hmm....I wonder if she knew she was going to be at band? Could she be trying to avoid me? *confused* I hope she gets online before tommorow.

      So Reegan told me to call her around 7. So I call her up and some guy answers the phone. The connection is kinda sketchy, so he hads the phone off to her mom. "Reegan? Shes at band practice. She'll be back at 9" Wow did I feel dumb.

      If I do end up asking Reegan to do something with me. It will be for the sole purpose of getting to know her better. I dont want people to think Im weird asking someone out I have never met. But there is really no other way for me to meet her. No common activities or anything. I was thinking maybee just aranging to meet somewhere, like the park or something. Nothing big, maybe with some other people. Again, it would be  to get to know her . I was talking to Li today, he saw her at some class at the police station. He thinks she wouldent mind getting to know me better. I just hope hes right. Anyway, Im still waiting for her to get online. I dont want to call her two nights in a row, it might seem a bit obsessive. Post later.

      Im going tommorow to get my permit. Its the last day one can get a permit and only have to hold it for 6 months before they can get a licence. After tommorow, I would have to wait a year. I downloaded the drivers handbook, its fucking huge. Im really worried that I wont pass the test. If any of you have tips, please post on the tag board. Post later.

      Ok, Ive been doing some thinking, and rememberd that sometimes Ariella can be a little harsh to judge. The things she said about reegan just dont hold water agains my experiance talking to her. I think I might keep talking to reegan, and possily ask her out.  TO GET TO KNOW HER . if things work out, then Ill ask her out again. I think I need to make my own desicions. Also, I remember the countless times Ariella has over reacted to my actions. Reegan just seems so unlike everything ariella says she is. Ariella, if you are reading this, I mean no offence, I dont mean to make you angry, you are still my best friend. I just need to find this out for my slef

      God I wish Britt lived here. She is so cool. I would ask her out in an instant if she did. GAH! Why do all the girls I like have to live so far away!? Its driving me insane. I just dont know what to do.... Post later.

      So, I told Ariella what was going on, and she went ballistic. At first I tryed not to listen to her, but I couldent. She has been my best friend forever. I trust her judgement over anyone elses. She told me what she thought of Reegan, and I decided that I no longer want to go out with her. The Reegan I knew was nice, and I dont have any first hand experiance with the stuff Ella said, but I belive her. Its a real bummer though, It would have been cool. Anyway, she has promised to help me find a girlfriend :D. heh, anyway, thats what Ill be up to for the rest of the summer. Post later

      I got her mom....She asked me to leave a message, so I spent 5 minutes trying to phrase "does she still want the div tag" so her mom would understand. Eventually she just put Reegan on the phone. I guess speaking with her mom scared me off asking her out..She has a really pretty voice...God, I was so nervous, my hands were shaking. I think Ill send it tonight, and then call her tommorow, tell her I sent the tag, and ask her out...I really hope she dosent get freaked out. *counts bakwards from 10*   (5 minutes later)  Ok, I just told ariella, and she is on the warpath. That was a fucking brilliant thing of me to do! *bashes head on keyboard* Fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck! Shit!!!!!!!  You know what, I dont care what ariella thinks. I like reegan, and Im going to go with it. post later.

I bet shell come online right in the middle of the party, and I wont be able to talk to her. Screw you Murphy! Anyway, Im scared out of my mind. Post later.

      Ok, from now on, things are going to be different. I will actually go to the gym, not just say I will. I will take greater care of my personal appearance. I will go out more. I figure its time for a change. I just had a greatly refreshing shower. Washed the old me away. I also washed my hair. :P Anyway, I figure if I am to have any chance with Reegan I have to stop being a hermit. Im off to find a winamp alarm clock plugin so I can wake up nice and early.

      This is awesome. Apparently on the 1st and 2nd, Pete can take as many people as he wants to eliches. So we are gonna invite everyone, including Reegan (yay). We figure we will have everyones parents drop them off at the light rail stop on Broadway, and then go from there. This is going to be soooooo awesome. I just hope Reegan can come....Im not sure if Ill go if  she cant. Post later.

      There is something seriously wrong with me. The more I read her blog, the more I liker her. I know I should really wait until i have met her to say that, but whatever. But she just seems like a really really cool girl. Fun and energetic, a perfect match for my personality.  I was talking to Kyle, and apparently she is Bi. Im ok with that. To each their own. Im waiting for her to get online so I can talk to her again. Post later.  **Watching The Thin Blue Line**

      Ive been reading all these blogs, and in all of them, the people drive. Im starting to think maybe I should get my permit. Yeah, Im really lazy. I guess it would be good to get it, even though we dont have any money for drivers ed. I guess I can start getting my hours in. Anyway, I think Ill go look up what I need to get a permit.

      Yes, Im back.....I should thwap myself for letting myself get like this over a girl. But the more I try and think about something else....the more I think about what could be...:Sigh: Petes still here, sleeping like a log as allways. I swear that boy could sleep in the middle of a bombing raid. Thoughts about her keep pouring through my mind... GAH!! I hope she comes online again today. I really enjoy talking to her. I wonder if I would even have a chance with her...Anyway....Ill probably be back again before tommmorow.   **Listening to Jamiroquai - Drifting Along**

      I couldent sleep last night, what with sleeping on the couch and all. Anyway, I couldent stop thinking about Reegan. I mean gawd. I have never even met this girl, but I cant get her out of my mind. I dont know what exactly it is, there is no way to know, I dont know her well enough, but still...She knows HTML, which is awesome because there is a commmon interest right there. Ive been reading her blog, and I think she plays the drums. Ok Dan, snap out of it. Anyway, its 5AM and Im sitting here blogging....how sad.

      Ok. So me and Pete went downtown tonight and started talking about the parties that I wasent invited to. Right now, I feel like crap. Yeah, I know I dont normally like parties, but when it is with a group of people I like, I love it. I guess being Mr. Anti-Social for the past 5 years dosent exactly make people want to invite me. I guess Im just a late bloomer. Also, even if I wouldent come, and Ariella knew this, she still should have invited me out of common courticy. It hurts when one of your best friends throws a party and dosent invite you. Anyway, I really hope that I will be Invited to the next one. Ive been talking to Reegan the past few days, she seems really cool. I dont know her that well, but I really want to get to know her better. She seems like somene I could identify with. Anyway, if any of you party planners read this, PLEASE INVITE ME! post again tommorow.

We tried for about 30 minutes to try and get her on the chat, but it wouldent work for some reason. I got my copy of Visual Basic.net today. Nice program, but it takes up alot of space.

      So, Nerd Paradise is having another Photoshop contest. I figure Ill submit an entry. Instead of using Photoshop though, Im using The GIMP (GNU Image Manipulation Program). Great proggy. Pretty much just as good as photoshop, but.....FREE! Ill post what my work looks like so far later tonight. Been playing more Deus Ex. What a great game. Went out to breakfast this morning with the family to The Pancake House, best chocolate chip pancakes I have ever had. Post the pic later.

I got pretty far, and only used one cheat (and only to find out a code that I had found out earlier but forgotten). My taskbar is being stoopid again, not popping up the date when I mouse over the time. Post again tommorow.

      So...We took grandpa to the airport today. Gonna miss him, but its nice haveing one less person in the house. I love airports. So much going on at once. Jarrett finally brought Deus Ex over today. I really appreciate how he considers me just like him, not a little freshman, but a friend. We talked for about an hour about computers and stuff. Im probably going to be building a system with him this summer, which will be fun. Im kinda annoyed because I cant display 32bit colors when I have another monitor connected to this. Oh well, I would rather have one good quality screen than two crappy quality screens. Im also kind of annoyed because I cant seem to get my Deus Ex demo save games to the new saved games file. Oh well...Post again tommorow.

Ive got it to think my name is Anus. For those like me who are easily entertained (well, sometimes), smarterchild should be something you check out. To talk to it, simply send an instant message to "smarterchild" on AIM. Hmmm...I need to clip my finger nails....Anyway, I think I might go to the pool later. Im heading out to Barnes and Nobles to get a collection of J. G. Gallager (or whatever) stories. Im pissed off because I cant find my copy of "Asimov on Numbers" and its out of print.

      I hate traveling with my family. They make me do things I dont want to do, go places I dont want to be. They "cramp my style". I walk fast, navigate well, and have a feel for the streets. They, however, have none of those traits, and thus stand out and cause me to enjoy my time less. Its not so much that they embarres me, which they sometimes do, but that they just seem to stop me from having a good time. Post later.

      screeching tires, revving motors far down on the street below.the constant ebb and flow of traffic soothes my restless dreams. red, green, and red again, the mechanical guardian directs our lives. honking of horns, out late, get home, and sleep sweetly to the sounds of the city. this world creates a vivid visual pallet of colors for wonderstruck eyes to gaze at endlessly. each sound a story, each story a life, each life alone, but one with the others.  the city never sleeps, though its people do, resting to once again inject their life into this hollow concrete shell.  lazily down the tree lined street a bycicle rolls, its driver unknown, its purpose certain.  this is MY city. this entire world existing for me alone to enjoy. but as it is my city, so it is everyone elses, theirs all their own.  together these worlds make up OUR city. the city we love, the city we are.

      The City, I crave it, it flows through my blood and latches on to every cell in my body.  Constantly driving me toward the centers of our modern civilization. There is allmost nothing I hate more than the rancid-sess-pools-of-anti-culture-black-holes-of-action-and-exitment-sucking- -smothering every last particle of my sanity. In a city, you go out, you dont have to be doing something, just go out. You cant just go out in Denver. I just cant stand it anymore. Post Later.

      As we level off at 35,000 feet, I look out the window to see growing thunderheads to the east. I sit back and listen to the radio chatter as I think back on what the afternoon has bestowed upon me. :wanes world dream sequence: Didley-do Didley-do Didley-do......As we walked into the airport I could feel the tention between me and dad growing. I hate flying with him, he is allways so uptight. We get inline and wait...and wait..and finally make it up to the check in counter. As soon as we tell her where we are going, she askes for out passports. I inform her that we do not need passports for travel to Canada. She insists, her computer is telling her that South African citizens must have a passport. But, we tell her, we are traveling as US residant aliens, not as SA citizens. She will not deviate however. Eventually, she calls in a supervisor who goes to the back and verifies that we do not need passports. Secure in the hope that our travel troubles are behind us, we head to the gate. The call for boarding is announced, and me and Steve step up to board. I am suddenly informed that I need some sort of other ticket to board, and that, "your parents must have it". Mildly frustrated, we find the rents and proceed to the back of the line. Still unsure of what exactly it is I need, I inquire the gate attendant. She then informs me that I need to be security screened for a second time, and that I should have been stopped at security for an advanced search. Angered, I wait for the TSA agent to show up. The hour is getting late, and the plane will soon depart. Eventually, at the eleventh hour, the scanner shows up. In short order I am scanned. As I walk toward the gate, an attractive girl, my age, possibly a bit older, stops me. "Are you guys from South Africa?" she asks. I tell her we are, and we exchange smiles. That being the one consolation I have had, I board the plane and take my seat. So here I am. Post later when we get to the hotel.         Ok, so Im here in the hotel, accessing a wifi network that Im not quite sure I am allowed on, but I am sure Im not paying 10/day for internet. This is the coolest hotel I have ever stayed in.

Then, when I finally do get someone on the phone, I will argue with them about how close I am to the CO, and then tell them to clear the lines by tuesday. AHhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!

      Watching "The Endless Summer". So far its pretty good. Love te sarcastic humour. Cinemetography is amazing. Unfortunatley it on ESPN, so there is a fucking annoying socre bar at the bottom. I wonder how Reegans trip is going. Been talking to Kyle, hes being really great, supportive of both sides. Post later.

      I just spent an hour playing Santana. In the words of the Beatles, "IVE GOT BLISTAS ON ME FINGAS!" But, I am so much more calm now. Its amazing how much healing power music has. I now realize that, yes, Im mad, and thats ok, but I will move on, Find new friends, keep some of the friends I have now, and everything will be grand. Anyway, Im off to watch family guy.

      She is stealing my life. The first time I thought I had a chance of actually having a social life, and she steals it away. She is going to turn everyone away from me. I am so angry.

      I no longer consider her a friend. She is possibly the most horrible person I have ever known. I hope to god that I never have to interact with her again. I just got out of the shower to hear that she had infact rescheduled the party. She... I hate her so much. I cringe at the thought that I was once her best friend. It is impossible to fathom the pure evil that exists whithin her soul. I have never felt such hatred toward someone before. I cant type anymore, Im just to angry.

      I have no idea what has got into her, or why she is acting so weird, but until she starts respecting me, I am not going to talk to her anymore. Practically every time I talk to her she berrates me for something else I have purportedly done. I think we need to just stop talking for a while.

      Ok, this is kinda weird....On Jennas blog, the link to my blog is this:   Looks kinda like shes saying Im a stalker dosent it? Then, on Reegans blog, the link to her e-mail adress is this:   Now, this wouldent stand out by its self, but because she does all the formatting for Jennas blog, so im starting to wonder if she means anything by this. It could be a total concidence and I am reading way to much into it, but i doubt it. Post later.

      Whoa, Exiting day. Got up, worked with Annelise for 2 hours, and came home. When I got home, mom told me dad was in the hospital for superventricular tachychardia. So we drive out to the hospital and find that he has allready been discharged. I get home and find that comcast has finally added video on demand. Jennas blog has a new skin, as well as Reegans. Thats about it for now. Post later.

      I am having an absolutly horrible night. First the concert, then I had to come home and deal with the internet. Then my new moust broke, and the trackpoint is acting up. The keyboard is sticking, and everyone is making way to much noise. Help me.....

      ...But, I can tell you it wasent what happend. I went to the concert with pete, we found kyle there, and hung out for a while. Jenna showed up, and, surprise surprise, Reegan was with her. So we go and say hi to them, and that ends up being the only thing I say to her. The rest of the time was spent me kyle and pete following them around like dogs. It was so unbelivably pathetic. Im not really sure how to take this, I expected at least a "hi, how are you", but its like she didnt even realize I was there. Its really discouraging, but Im not going to give up. I guess it will be a long while untill I talk to her again, so I was hoping to at least talk to her tonight, but, such is life.   ** Jimi Hendrix - Various Artists - The Wind Cries Mary **

      I just called Reegan to see if she was going to the concert on tuesday, got her mom.  "Is this Daniel?"  "Yeah"  "Ok, just a sec, Ill get Reegan." So Reegan gets on the phone and tells me that Im not allowed to call her anymore. I have really no idea why. Apparently her parents read my blog, but there is nothing on there that is bad. Just the thoughts of a teenage boy with a crush on a girl. No drugs, sex, booze or anything like that. I am really destressed about this. I want to know what, if anything, I did to bring this ban. Crap, the first girl I really like who lives here, and Im not even allowed to call her. *sigh* Post later.  P.S. - If anyone knows anything about this please let me know

      Apparently Reegans parents found her blog. I feel so bad for her. I know how much of an outlet this thing is for me. It must  SUCK  to have your parents read your blog. A blog is something personal that you share with your friends. A modern outlet of teen angst. *sigh* Oh well, such is life. She probably got in loads of trouble as well. Im soo sorry for her.

      Have you ever just sat infront of a phone and waited for someone to call? Thats essentially what Im doing. Sitting here, afraid to leave for fear of missing Reegan. Its unbearable! *sigh* I just hope she gets on soon.

      I cant call her, I just cant. To call someone, you have to have a reason. I dont have a reason other than I really want to talk to her. And if I give her that reason, shell think Im weird. Gah! I just realy wish she would get online. Post later.

      So I spoke to Reegan this morning. I tried to be really subtle about trying to get her to go the concert. I really hope it works. I want to meet her so badly. She said she would let me know if she is going. Even if she dosent let me know, I might go anyway, just incase she goes. If she dosent call me by the time we head out, Ill call her to see if she is coming. Post later.

      We have so much booze laying around. Just makes one think. I mean, I have no desire what so ever to drink, and thus, all the booze is kept in plain site. But if I did want to, it would be hidden. I figure if it was hidden, I might want to drink, for the exitment of getting something Im not supposed to have. Pete is allways amazed how little tabs my parents keep on that stuff.. Just a thought...Post later.

      I have this huge red bug bite on my leg. It started out as a normal itchy thing. I scratched it a bit last night, and when I woke up, it was huge. Right now its red, hard, and about the size of a  half dollar coin and growing. I dont want to go to the doctor just yet, because I want to have a chance to talk to Reegan, and we are going to be out later. I spent the day at Eliches, it was ok, exept for my leg kept hurting me. I think that the next time Reegan get online, if I havent called her by then, Im just going to throw pleasantries to the wind and try and arrage a meeting. I hope it works. Post later.

      I just realized that I am the stereotypical nerd. I cant carry on a phone conversation very well, but I can chat for hours online. Gah, its not Reegans fault that she is never online, she has better things to do. I would call her if I knew she would be there. Anyway, Im going to eliches tommorow. Ill have my cell phone incase anyone has to reach me.

      Ok, So I really dont know what to do. Reegan is never online long enough for me to try and arrange a meeting. When I ask when to call her, she is allways very sketchy about when to call......Im talking to Ella. I just talked to Reegan, she was drunk....I need some time to think. I just wish she could get online for 5 minutes so I can arrange something. Post later.

      I hate phones. I cant stand them. Whenever I try and call somone, I end up misscomunnicating myself to them, dealing with family members and such. It dosent make it any easier calling the girl I like. God, I wish she was online more. I just dont know what to do. I want to meet her, but I just dont know how to arrange it. *sighs*....  ....5 minutes later [22:19] endlessummer899: hey cant talk call me [22:19] DanTekGeek: i cant [22:19] DanTekGeek: no one ever answers [22:19] endlessummer899: i will [22:19] DanTekGeek: or your not hom [22:19] DanTekGeek: now? [22:19] DanTekGeek: or when?  then she signed off. I have konw fucking idea if she wants me to call her now, or some other time. I dont think Ill call her. I dont want her getting in trouble for someone calling this late. I think Ill call her tommorow morning, like 11. God, this is all so complicated.

Ariella isnt coming,.....fuck, Im just going to go with pete. I cant just call Reegan and invite her. Ill go, and worry all day that this was the day that fuck, i dont know if to go or not. FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUCK! shit, why the hell is reegan never online!

      I know its weird, but every time I call Reegan, She is busy. I dont want to look weird or anything by calling all the time. So I left my number on her tag board. Pete and I are going to Eliches tommorow. He dosent want to take the trouble to Invite everyone, but he said I could come, and probably invite Reegan! Anyway, if she dosent get online by 9:30, and if pete says she can come, Ill call her anyway. Post Later.

      So Im walking around china town today, and I have walked down pretty much all the streets, but I see that there is one that I havent, so I begin walking down it, and notice that there isnt really much to see. I notice a lady walking next to me, and she askes me for the time. I give it to her. I keep walking and she askes me what a kid is doing in that part of town alone. I guess that I had strayed away from the touristy area. She tells me that I shouldent be around there, and asks me if I needed a tour guide. I told her no, and turned the corner in the direction of where I had started. She then started asking me if I had any money. For some reason, the only times I have coins in my pocket, I have alot, and those times, however infrequent they are, people ask me for money. I give her a few coins, and she says she hears more in my pocket. By this time I had deduced from her slutty cloths and mannerism that she was a whore. I gave her the rest of my money and she finally walked off. Now, normally this would be something to look back on and laugh about, but for some reason it has really unsettled me. I have been uncomfortable all day since that happend. I dont know what it is, but it keeps going through my head, and Im scared. Please help me...
