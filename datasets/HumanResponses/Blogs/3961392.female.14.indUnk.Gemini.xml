      i dunno.. but have you ever done sth that you might not think you did but you did for someone else?Well. i have.. for the one i love.. i did many things that i neer thought i would do.. some of which i think i never did wan to let go.. coz it was very important to me .. but i did let go.. for him.. i did.. coz i thought it was worth it.. but now.. i regretted till deep down to my very soul.. i let one of the most precious thing in my life go.. that was having a chance to serve God.. he was my "god".. i listened to every word he said.. i cried when he hurt mi.. but i still held on.. hoping tat nuttin will go our way.. yes.. i admit along the way i met this guy.. who i knew was willing to give mi happiness.. but .. i couldn't accept his kind offer.. b'coz i was in love.. wif this guy who doesn't even deserve it.. but i still held on.. believing his every words.. till den .. 25 dec 2003.. he had enough of me.. i guess.. for no particular reason.. he juz left.. left mi... walked out of my life.. it was the saddest day of my life... i did so much.. for him.. i gave up.. almost everything...that's not all.. we met again this year.. i still loved him den.. and he claimed that he still loved mi.. foohishly i believed him again.. he even kissed mi and i clinged on to that hope.. but ... my hopes were dashed..i tried to let go.. but.. i was hard..    Now.. i love another .. and yes.. i'm still as devoted to him as i am devoted to my past love.. but i love him more.. more den anything this world can provide..With him i find joy and happiness.. everything that i was looking for.. everything that i ever wanted.. sometimes i scold myself.. "why didn't i meet him earlier?" Yes i agree.. tat we still go thru our ups and downs.. but than he was very supportive.. supporting in everyway and i truely appreciate it..wad more could anyone ask for?..and now.. i hope tat we are able to go to the next stage..together.. yes.. i noe we are still youn.. but anything is possible right?  To Wenjie :   thank you for being so supportive in my life.. And though many times i became the "morning glory" who always need something to cling on .. but still you've helped mi.. even though we juz met.. but you've give to mi happiness.. much much more than wad he gave to mi.. he nv really gave mi wad i wanted.. but than i still held on.. but that was then.. now is now.. i never regretted knowing you.. althought we've juz met.. but you already made and impact in my life.. and even if we are not able to make it to the next stage ..together.. i juz wanna let you noe that i love you.. it doesn't matter how you look like.. i will still love you .. because ..wad really matters is the inside not out.. i love you wif all my heart honey..i love you..
