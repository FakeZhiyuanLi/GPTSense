      I was in  Hyderabad giving this lecture, when a 14 year old      asked me for my  autograph. I asked her what her goal in life is.  She  replied: I want to live in a developed India.  For her,  you and I will have to build this developed India. You must proclaim. India is  not an under-developed nation; it is a highly developed nation.  Do you have  10 minutes? Allow me to come back with a vengeance. Got 10  minutes for your country? If yes, then read; otherwise, choice is yours. YOU say  that our government is inefficient. YOU say  that our laws are too old. YOU say  that the municipality does not pick up the garbage. YOU say  that the phones don't work, the railways are a  joke, The airline  is the worst in the world, mails never reach their destination.   You say that our  country has  been fed to the dogs  and is the absolute pits. YOU say, say and say. What do YOU do about it?   Take a person on his way to Singapore.   Give him a name?   YOURS.   Give him a face?   YOURS.   YOU walk out of the airport and you are at your International best.   - In Singapore you don't throw cigarette       on the roads or eat in the stores.   - YOU are as proud of their Underground Links as they are.   - You pay $5 (approx. Rs.60) to drive through Orchard Road (equivalent of Mahim Causeway or     Pedder Road) between 5 PM and 8 PM.   - YOU comeback to the parking lot to punch your parking ticket if you have over-stayed,      identity.   In Singapore you don't say anything, DO YOU?   - YOU wouldn't dare to eat in public during Ramadan, in Dubai.   - YOU would not dare to go out without your head covered in Jeddah.   - YOU would not dare to buy an employee of the telephone exchange in London at 10 pounds     (Rs.650) a month to, "see to it that my STD and ISD calls are billed to someone else."   - YOU would not dare to speed beyond 55 mph (88 km/h) in Washington and then tell the traffic     cop, "Jaanta hai main kaun hoon (Do you know who I am?).  I am so and so's son. Take your     two bucks and get lost."   - YOU wouldn't chuck an empty coconut shell anywhere other than the garbage pail on the     beaches in Australia and New Zealand.     Why don't YOU spit Paan on the streets of Tokyo?   Why don't YOU use examination jockeys or buy fake certificates in Boston?????   We are still talking of the same YOU.   YOU who can respect and conform to a  foreign system in other countries but cannot in your own. You who will throw papers and             on the road the moment you touch Indian ground.   If you can be an involved and appreciative citizen in an alien country, why cannot you be the same here in India? Once in an  interview, the famous Ex-municipal Commissioner of     ay, Mr. Tinaikar, had a point to make.     "Rich people"s dogs  are walked on the streets to leave their affluent droppings all over the place," he said. "And then the same  people turn around to criticize and blame the authorities for inefficiency and dirty pavements. What do they expect the officers to do? Go down with a broom every time their dog feels the pressure in his  bowels?  In America every dog owner has to clean up after his pet has done the job. Same in Japan. Will the Indian citizen do that here?"    He's right. We go to the polls to choose a government and after that forfeit all responsibility.   We sit back wanting to be pampered and expect the government to do everything for us whilst our contribution is totally negative. We expect the government to clean up but we are not going to stop chucking garbage all over the place nor are we going to stop to pick a up a stray piece of paper and throw it in the bin.     We expect the railways to provide clean bathrooms but we are not going to learn the proper use of  bathrooms.  We want Indian Airlines and Air India to provide the best of food and toiletries but we are not going to stop pilfering at the least opportunity. This applies even to the staff who is  known not to pass on the service to the public.     When it comes to burning social issues like those related to women, dowry,      child and others, we make loud drawing room protestations and continue to do the reverse at home.  Our excuse?   "It's the whole system which has to change, how will it matter if I alone forego my son's rights to a dowry."     So who's going to change the system? What does a  system consist of?  Very conveniently for us it consists of our neighbours, other households, other cities, other communities and the government.   But definitely not me and YOU.   When it comes to us actually making a  positive contribution to the system we lock ourselves along with our families into a safe cocoon and look into the distance at countries far away and wait for a Mr. Clean to come along & work miracles for us with a majestic sweep of his hand or we leave the country and run away.  - Like lazy cowards hounded by our fears we run to America to bask in their glory and praise      their system.     - When New York becomes insecure we run to England.     - When England experiences unemployment, we take the next flight out to the Gulf.     - When the Gulf is war struck, we demand to be rescued and brought home by  the Indian     government.     Everybody is out to abuse and rape the country.   Nobody thinks of feeding the system.   Our conscience is mortgaged to money.   Dear Indians, the article is highly thought inductive, calls for a great deal of introspection and      s one's conscience too?..   I am echoing J.F. Kennedy's words to his fellow American to relate to Indians?. "ASK WHAT WE CAN DO FOR INDIA AND DO WHAT HAS TO BE DONE TO MAKE INDIA WHAT AMERICA AND OTHER WESTERN COUNTRIES ARE TODAY " Lets do what India needs from us.   Forward  this mail to each Indian for a change instead of sending Jokes or junk mails. Thank You, Dr. Abdul  Kalaam

      A speaker opened his seminar by holding up a $20.00  bill.      In the room of 200, he asked,   &quot;Who would like this $20 bill?&quot;      Hands started going up.   He said, &quot;I am going to give this $20 to one of you  but first, let me do this. He crumpled up the $20 dollar bill and then asked, &quot;Who still wants it?&quot; Still the hands were up in the  air.      He replied, &quot;What if I do this?&quot;   And he dropped it on the ground and started to grind  it into the floor With his shoe. He picked it up, now crumpled and dirty.  &quot;Now, who still wants it?&quot; Still the hands went into  the air.     &quot;My friends, we have all learned a very valuable  lesson. No matter what I did to the money, you still wanted it  because it did not decrease in value. It was still  worth $20.      Many times in our lives, we are dropped, crumpled, and ground into the dirt by the decisions we make and the circumstances that come our way. We may feel as though we are worthless, but no matter what has happened or what will happen, you will never lose your value.      Dirty or clean, crumpled or creased, you are still priceless to  those who love you.      The worth of our lives comes not in what we do or who we know, but by who we are.      We are all special - don't ever forget it.&quot;      And remember: amateurs built the ark ...professionals  built the Titanic.      If God brings you to it - He will bring you through it.

        This is one of the ways to do a Self Appraisal :-)  A little boy went into a drug store, reached for a soda carton and pulled it over to the telephone. He  climbed onto the carton so that he could reach the buttons on the phone and proceeded to punch in seven digits. The store owner listened to the following  conversation.  The boy asked, "Lady, Can you give me the job of cutting your lawn?"  The woman replied, "I already have someone to cut my lawn."  "Lady, I will cut your lawn for half the price of the person who cuts your lawn now."  The woman responded that she was very satisfied with the person who was presently cutting her lawn.  The little boy found more perseverance and offered, "Lady, I'll even sweep your curb and your sidewalk, so  on Sunday you will have the prettiest lawn in all of  North Palm Beach, Florida."  Again the woman answered in the negative. With a smile on his face, the little boy replaced the  receiver.  The druggist, who was listening to all this, walked over to the boy and said,"Son... I like your attitude,  I like that positive spirit and would like to offer  you a job."  The little boy replied, "No thanks:) I was just checking on the job I already have!"

                      My Lessons in Life       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   By Azim Premji      ******************************************************* Azim Premji,  Chairman and Managing Director of Wipro Limited, India shares his  perspective on success and effective living  with teenagers *******************************************************    The funny thing about life is that you realize the value of something  only when it begins to leave you. As my hair turned from black, to salt  and pepper to finally salt without pepper, I have begun to realize the  importance of youth. At the same time, I have begun to truly appreciate  some of the lessons I have learnt along the way. I hope you will find them  useful when you plan your career and life.    &nbsp;    The first thing I have learnt is that we must  always begin with our strengths. From the earliest years of our schooling,  everyone focuses on what is wrong with us. There is an imaginary story of  a rabbit. The rabbit was enrolled in a rabbit school. Like all rabbits, it  could hop very well but could not swim. At the end of the year, the rabbit  got high marks in hopping but failed in swimming. The parents were  concerned. They said, "Forget about hopping, you are good at it anyway.  Concentrate on swimming". They sent the rabbit for tuitions in  swimming. And guess what happened? The rabbit forgot how to hop. As for  swimming, have you ever seen a rabbit swim? While it is important for  us to know what we are not good at, we must also cherish what is good in  us.    &nbsp;    That is because; it is only our strengths that  can give us the energy to correct our weaknesses. The second lesson I have  learnt is that a Rupee earned is of far more value than FIVE found. My  friend was sharing with me the story of his eight year old niece, she  would always complain about breakfast. The cook tried everything possible,  but the child remained unhappy. Finally my friend took the child to a  supermarket and bought one of those ready-to-cook packets. The child had  to cut the packet and pour the water in the dish. After that, it took two  minutes in the microwave to be ready. The child found the food to be  absolutely delicious. The difference was that she had cooked it! In my own  life, I have found that nothing gives as much satisfaction as earning our  rewards. In fact, what is gifted or inherited follows the old rule of come  easy, go easy. I guess we know the value of what we have if we have to  struggle to earn it.    &nbsp;    The third lesson I have learned is that no one bats  a hundred every time. Life has many challenges. You win some and lose  some. You must enjoy winning. But do not let it go to the head. The moment  it does, you are already on your way to failure. And if you encounter  failure along the way, treat it as an equally natural phenomenon. Don't  beat yourself for it or anyone for that matter! Accept it, look at your  own share of the problem, learn from it and move on. The important thing  is, when you lose do not lose the lesson. The fourth lesson I have learnt  is the importance of humility. Sometimes, when you get so much in life,  you really start wondering whether you really deserve all of it! This  brings me to the value of gratitude. We have so much to be grateful for.  Our parents, our teachers and our seniors have done so much for us that we  can never repay them. Many people focus on the shortcomings,  because obviously, no one can be perfect. But it is important to first  acknowledge what we have received. Nothing in life is permanent but when a  relationship ends, rather than becoming bitter, we must learn to savor the  memory of the good things while they lasted.    &nbsp;    The fifth lesson is that we must always strive  for excellence. One way of achieving excellence is by looking at those  better than ourselves. Keep learning what they do differently. Emulate it.  But excellence cannot be imposed from outside. We must also feel the need  from within. It must become an obsession. It must involve not only our  mind but also our heart and soul. Excellence is not an act but a habit. I  remember the inspiring lines of a poem, which says that your reach must  always exceed your grasp. That is heaven on earth. Ultimately, your  only competition is yourself. The sixth lesson I have learnt is never give  up in adversity. It comes on you suddenly without warning. One can either  succumb to self-pity, wring your hands in despair or decide to deal with  the situation with courage and dignity. Always keep in mind that it  is only the test of fire that makes us find steel. A friend of mine shared  this incident with me. His eight-year-old daughter was struggling away at  a jigsaw puzzle. She kept at it for hours but could not succeed. Finally,  it went beyond her bedtime. My friend told her, "Look, why don't you just  give up? I don't think you will complete it tonight. Look at it another  day." The daughter looked with a strange look in her eyes, "But, Dad, why  should I give up? All the pieces are there! I have just got to  put them together!" If we persevere long enough, we can put any problem  in perspective.    &nbsp;    The seventh lesson I have learnt is that while  you must be open to change, do not compromise on your values. Mahatma  Gandhi often said that you must open the windows of your mind, but you  must not be swept off your feet by the breeze. You must define what your  core values are and what you stand for. And these values are not so  difficult to define. Values like honesty, integrity, consideration  and sensitivity have survived for generations. Values are not in the  words used to describe them, as much as in simple acts. A wise man once  said, "You do not have to change the world to make a difference. If on the  way to your house, you can bring a smile on the face of a crying child, you  have done your bit". At the end of the day, it is values that define a  person more than the achievements. Because it is the means of achievement  that decide how long the achievements will sustain. Do not be tempted by  short cuts. The short cut can make you lose your way and end up becoming  the longest way to the destination.    &nbsp;    And the final lesson I learnt is that we must  have faith in our own ideas even if everyone tells us that we are wrong.  There was once a newspaper vendor who had a rude customer. Every morning,  the customer would walk by, refusing to return the greeting, grab the  paper off the self and throw the money at the vendor. The vendor would  pick up the money, smile politely and say "Thank you, Sir." Oneday the  Vendor's assistant asked him, "Why are you always polite with him when  he is so rude to you? Why don't you throw the newspaper at him when he  comes back tomorrow?" The Vendor smiled and replied, "he can't help being  rude and I can't help being polite. Why should I let his rude  behavior dictate my politeness?" So it is, my young friends, with all of  us. In my youth, I thought of myself as a rebel and was any times, a rebel  without a cause. Today, I realize that my rebellion was another kind of  conformity. We defied our elders to fall in line with our peers!  Ultimately, we must learn to respond instead of reacting. When we respond,  we evaluate with a calm mind and do whatever is most appropriate. We  are in control of our actions. When we react, we are still doing what the  other person wants us to do. I wish you all the best in your life and  career. I hope you achieve success in whatever way you define it and what  gives you the maximum in life. Remember those who win are those who  believe they can.

                      A  few weeks ago NIMH (National Institute of Mentally Handicapped, Hyderabad)  had conducted a sports meet for all the Physically &amp;   mentally handicapped children at National Stadium Hyderabad.    &nbsp;    In one race.., Nine contestants, all physically or  mentally disabled, assembled at the starting line for the 100-yard dash. At  the gun, they all started out, not exactly in a dash, but with a relish to  run the race to the finish and win.    &nbsp;    All, that is, except one little boy who stumbled on  the asphalt,  tumbled over a couple of times, and began to cry. The other  eight heard the boy cry. They slowed down and looked back. Then they all  turned around and  went back......every one of them.    &nbsp;    One girl with Down's Syndrome bent down and kissed  him and said, "This will make it better." Then all nine linked arms and  walked together to the finish line. Everyone in the stadium stood, and the  cheering went  on for several minutes. People who were there are still  telling the story. Why??    &nbsp;    Because deep down we know this one thing: What  matters in this life is more than winning for ourselves. What matters in this  life is helping others win, even if it means slowing down and changing our  course.    &nbsp;    If you pass this on, we may be able to change our  hearts as well as someone  else's. ----------------------------------------------------------------------- "A  candle loses nothing by lighting another  candle" -----------------------------------------------------------------------
