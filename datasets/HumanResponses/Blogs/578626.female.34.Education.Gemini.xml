      Friday afternoon, and work has slowed to a crawl and so has the clock. I"m looking forward to the weekend and a trip to Shelburne Falls with Ben and Liz.   This week has been calm, but Grace is spinning in my head. Grace Kelly Greenberg is the main character of a novel I've been writing for the past 10 years. OK, only 2 of those I've been actively working on it. But I'll perhaps post some excerpts here. I don't expect anybody to see them. But perhaps it could help me get them done.

      We watched the last episode of Angel on Thursday night. I was really sad to see it go. I think it went rather quietly. At least Buffy had a 2 hour finale. Rich got me a Tivo for mother's day. I thought with Angel, Buffy and Friends gone there would be nothing left to Tivo. But we seem to have become obsessed with various HGTV shows. It's taping "Designed to Sell" (Because we're going to sell our condo in a year) "This Old House" and "Dream House." We're getting psyched up to do an addition at what is now our income property. We're also taping Scrubs, Family Guy Ab Fab and Coupling.   The thing that makes me nuts about these DIY shows is the budgets. They have at least 2 professional carpenters and a designer thrown into a 1k budget. The labor alone on some of these projects is a few thousand dollars (at least in this area). IF you can get somebody GOOD with the skills who is willing to work on a small job. But these people in "designed to sell" are so depressing. They live in these dated houses for decades without making changes. We bought a house last year and found out that they had no electricity in their half bath. There was no outlet and the overhead light wasn't connected to anything. to fix that and 2 others (also disconnected) was all of $300. How can you have no power in your bathroom? How do you read if you want to go at NIGHT? And the clutter! My GOD. We take many carloads a year over to Salvation Army and Good Will. I'm not a "stuff" person. I get rid of things all the time. My parent's house is really cluttered. Both my parents fantisize about backing a dumpster up to the house and throwing out the other one's stuff. But neither is willing to part with their own stuff. Another fact about my family. They don't use suitcases. They move their stuff back and forth to their weekend place in plastic laundry baskets. I think my husband has been a good influence on me in this respect. We use luggage when we go out there.

      Today was nice. It was my day off to play with The Boy. I met up with a friend of mine and we went to the park with the babies. Her son is a week younger than mine.   a lot of "SAHMS" (Stay at home moms)often tell me emphatically how busy they are. (Not the mom I was hanging out with today). But a lot of them are really defensive to me about their choice. I went back to work after a 12 week maternity leave. I think staying at home with your baby is a lot more difficult than going to work and getting a break from your baby. I am crazy about The Boy. Having a baby is like falling in that crazy falling-in-love that can be SO unhealthy when you're in you 20's. It's that rush, but it has none of the dangerous elements to it. But hanging out with a baby day-in-day out is exhausting. It's much easier for me to go to work and use the grown up part of my brain. I do feel bad for women who leave jobs that they didn't like that much, especially if they are in their 30's. It must be tough to be at that point in your career and not have found a job or a career that you're excited about. And I'm talking about women who have had all the advantages, good education etc. And after over 10 years in the workplace, they still don't like what they're doing. It's a bummer. In some ways, I wish I wanted to stay home with The Boy, but I think I'd really miss work. Plus, I work in IT, so I'd have to start over if I took a few years off. I feel very lucky that I even got to choose. These days I feel lucky most of the time. I wonder why America has this fear of aging. Perhaps our bodies start to disappoint us, but life keeps getting better. Most of my friends have started to settle down with babies and partners as we start to swim into our mid thirties. Some of them ended up with really horrible partners, but those are few and far between. Most of them are great partners.

      Last night after The Boy went to sleep, The Husband was applying for new jobs on the Internet. He said he'd written an enthusiastic cover letter. I said what did it say? and on the spot we made up the worlds worst cover letter. It sounded somethink like this:  Dear Sir,  I really want to work as your company. Last week we had company at our house and my wife made them dinner. So I would have my wife make dinner for your company sometimes. I will not come to work naked.  Sincerely,  Rich  We went on and on. We laughed so hard we woke up The Boy.

      I feel slightly nauseous that the seemingly female friendly Curves is giving money to  urlLink millitant  anti-abortion groups. There could be so much common ground in the abortion debate. However nobody seems willing to see it. I think the pro-choice movement needs to be just that, about CHOICE. If a woman gets pregnant under sub-ideal circumstances there is a lot of pressure to terminate the pregnancy. I think these groups could work in conjunction to create resources for women who want to have 'inconvenient' babies, but don't know what to do. Anti-abortion groups pour all their time and energy into preventing abortions and not enough time supporting the millions of unwanted children in the US. The foster care system is a disaster. Let's get that fixed and then we can talk about allowing more unwanted children into the world. Teach kids about birth control and STD prevention. It's completely unrealistic to think that people aren't going to have sex until they're married.  Enough bleeding heart liberal suff for today.

      Eric is eight and a half months old now. He is sleeping at the moment. He has started sleeping four or five hours at a stretch alone in his crib. I am unprepared for how much I miss him. I can hear his little sighs on the monitor, the heavy breath of deep sleep. I am unprepared for this profound love. Unprepared for his innocence. I’ve seen it in other parents, the way they try to keep their children happy. Their kids seem spoiled and sullen. But are they just trying to recapture this time? This time where everything in the world is a source of joy to them? Will an ice cream cone do it? A Nintendo? A volkswagon? What is the magic combination that will make my child’s face light up and his arms reach up for me to hold him? What drug, what material possession could compare to the look on  your baby’s face when he recognizes you when you get home from work? How can parents hurt their children?  I cut the label of his t-shirt that Helen, our realtor gave us when she came by to do our appraisal. I figured I'd stick it in the wash with the other new clothes. It is HUGE, but I realized that it’s an 18-24 month size, the size we’re buying these days. This time is so fleeting. I want to bottle these feelings to pull out when his voice changes and he rolls his eyes at me. When I am an embarrassment to him. I want to drink from that memory because I know this perfect time will pass. It will be replaced with something as wonderful, but I can't picture it yet. It's like a movie I've been waiting for, but I've only seen the previews.  this is terrifying sometimes. I have no idea what I did to deserve this flawless child, this cheerful little boy that rarely cries, sticks out his tongue when he's concentrating and communicates in a language made completely of raspberries. But here he is when I wake up in the morning whapping at my breasts grinning for his breakfast.  I watch my husband with him. He is the perfect father. He works too much, but when he's here he's all about the boy. My husband is big and goofy, sturdy and pragmatic, loving and loyal. I am grateful for my insane 20's that gave me the wisdom to grab at the chance for this family. Please, God, Buddah, Yaweh, Allah let me keep them safe.

      Thank GOD! The Boy went to sleep last night in his crib around 8:30. I gave him some ibuprofin in the afternoon after much cranking and the difference was amazing. I got my cheery little guy back! Last couple nights had me feeling a little doomed. Every time I say out loud that he's doing well, we backslide. He woke up every hour and a half or so and fussed. But that's OK. I just go in touch his face and hands softly and whisper "shhhhhhh... It's ok little pumpkin." and he goes back to sleep. He was nursing a lot in the night again, but that's OK. He's getting so many teeth at once. Poor little dude.  I'm reading Kate Atkinson's "Human Croquet." It's just heartbreaking. I have a completely different take on books about parents and children now. It's about 2 misfit kids growing up in Gleeblands, England. Their mother disappeared when they were little and they live amongst broken depressed adults. This is where it gets weird. The fabric of time begins to shift and Isobel, the main character finds herself in Shakespearian times. But it's SO sad to think of kids growing up without parents.   Kids so often fancy themselves orphans. Their "real" parents are kings and queens and will come rescue them from their cruel step-parents who make them eat spinach and clean their rooms. But the reality is that kids love their parents and crave their approval, no matter how flawed the parents are. That's such a daunting responsibility. Your kids will love you and need you no matter WHAT you do, so don't fuck up!! You may get that love, but you won't be worthy of it. Will I be the one to destroy that innocence? God I hope not.   My neighbor has a four year old daughter who is the sweetest little girl. Every time she sees my son she gives him kisses and says how cute he is. She's got a heart of gold. This poor little girl is so uncool. The kids will make mincemeat of her in public school in a couple years. I can just tell because she is me at that age. And I was brutalized by my peers. Girls can be SO nasty.

       urlLink Johnny Depp  as Willy Wonka? It could work. He does some really amazing mime stuff. I never really liked "Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory." Charlie and the Chocolate Factory was one of my favorite books ever when I was little. The movie never did it justice. The focus switched to Wonka, and Charlie was not a hero. He was merely less rotten than the other kids. Why am I thinking about this? It's on AMC and we have it on in the background. The thing that really bugged me about it (and bugs me now) was that Rohld Dahl wrote these amazing poems for the oompa loompas to sing, and they rewrote them. And they sucked! I could go on, but I won't.  Last couple nights have been tough getting The Boy to sleep. It's weird how he'll go down easy most of the time, then we just hit a wall. Last night, there was much fussing and much eye-rubbing and crying ensued. Then there was an ENORMOUS poop and he went right to sleep once I changed his diaper. Today, no poop, just exhausted sobbing boy rubbing his eyes and crying. Eventually we gave up on the crib and now he's fast asleep in my bed. It's pretty tough because I usually don't make dinner until The Boy goes to sleep. But I'm usually really hungry when I get home from work. Whine Whine.  I'm whining tonight.

      I just figured out how to use HELLO! Like the British tabloid, only with cute babies instead of celebrities-I've-never-heard-of. So, here's pictures of The Boy. I intended to use this Blog as kind of a journal of motherhood, but it's a place of random babbling as well. That's OK because I don't think anybody reads it but my wonderful husband (who made me quesadillas for dinner tonight).

       urlLink This  makes me very happy. Although I did not see "the Passion of the Christ," it's nice to see alternative voices still out there. Life of Brian looks at the ways in which we choose to follow/worship in a very funny way. As an agnostic Jew, the whole Jesus/Rockstar thing makes me more uncomfortable that I really understand. I HATE violent movies, so even if I were still amongst the DINKS (Double Income No Kids) I probably would not have chosen TPOFTC.  I very seldom go to movies any more. I've seen exactly ONE movie since the birth of The Boy, and it was the horrific "Cheaper By the Dozen."  Although I did not exactly *choose* Cheaper By the Dozen. Cold Mountain was sold out and we were trying to seize the day and the free babysitting from my in-laws. So we went to a movie that said: "You should have no life beyond the needs of your children." The kids in that movie were HORRIBLE, complete brats. I thought it might be kind of a remake of the story of the Gilbreths, but although they were mentioned, it had nothing to do with them. It was not a good first movie for new parents to see. We tried to see Big Fish a few months ago, but The Boy got really upset and my mom spilled the bag of breastmilk I left her so she had to call us home before it even started. I really miss going to the movies. I'm looking forward to taking The Boy to the movies when he's old enough. I'll go see any Disney/Kid flick he wants to. My parents HATED all things Disney and it was banned from my house. My mom thought it was corny, and my dad still has nightmares about the queen in Snow White. So, no Disney for us. We didn't even own a VCR until 1986, then my mom wouldn't get a membership to a video store for another year. It's pretty funny in retrospect.  Life of Brian is one of my favorite movies of all time. It was the first time I ever saw a naked man. I don't find Monty Python nearly as funny as I used to, but I still love those movies.

      We went to a dinner party last night. My wonderful friend Jeff decided to have a party early enough that we could leave by 8. Even so, The Boy crashed in the car on the way home. He slept for about 45 minutes then he didn't want to go to bed until we did. That's fine. We're a co-sleeping family for the most part. On a "normal" day he falls alseep in his crib anywhere between 7:00 to 8:30. Sometimes he wakes up around 11 when he goes to sleep. Friday night he stayed in there until 2. Then he sleeps with us. Some nights, we just take him to bed with us if we're going early.  Co-sleeping is way more contraversial than it should be. I know he'll be in my bed at least another year. But he's a boy and getting more and more active by the minute. The only real snuggling he does is when he's drowsy and sleeping. We're trying to have the best of both worlds, so he's used to sleeping in his crib for naps and that's where he starts the night. But I have to work in the morning and I dont' want to be getting up as often as he does. So, co-sleeping it is. The only conflict I can forsee is when we have another baby. He won't be able to sleep in our bed initially when the baby is very tiny. But I think we can set up a place in our room for him to sleep if he hasn't transitioned out of our room by then. I saw this thing on the discovery health chanel on toddlers. A family was trying to get their two-year-old out of their bed and their idiot pediatrician said to do it cold turkey. I'd rather move into my kids room for a few weeks and transition them out that way. The poor parents on DHC, could stand the crying for about 5 minutes then, the little girl was so upset that she almost puked. And they took her out of her crib.   I'm NOT a fan of 'cry it out'. I purchased  urlLink this book  recently and it helped a lot. One thing it said was to trust your instincts. For the past month or 2 he's been waking up to nurse a LOT. Like 4 times a night. I figured something was up, but I didn't push it. But last weekend, he popped FOUR new teeth. Compared to what my friends with teething babies are going through, (hours of inconsolable crying on end) some extra nursing seemed like a dream. Now the teeth are out, and he wakes up 12ish to come into our bed, then at 3 then 7ish we're up for the day. I can live with that. Sometimes it's more than that, but he's such a cheerful guy. Everybody at dinner last night was amazed at how "well behaved" he was. One of the guys was the oldest of 5 kids, and he really knew how to play with babies. So, if he's crying, it usually means that something is really wrong. I want to that crying to MEAN something. If we start ignoring it to "train" him to sleep, then that communication will be broken.   On the flip side, a friend of my sister's let their baby cry for hours until she threw up on herself and they still didn't go in. But their daughter sleeps through the night, and my sister's daughter still wakes up and goes into her mom's bed. I'd rather encourage a family bed than break that trust. It's just the way I'm built.

      Eric turned Three Quarters Yesterday  I took the day off and visited a preschool that offered us a spot for next fall. I LOVED it at their open house, but I did not love it when I visited it. I was very underwhelmed. To begin with, it was very expensive. They only had one teacher, plus a parent helper for six babies. The parent helper today was a sub, who spent the entire hour we were there cutting fruit for the snack. While I was very impressed to see the kids all munching their fruit, I couldn't believe this woman had her back to the kids while she fixed the snack. I also couldn't believe it took her an hour to cut fruit. I've made five course meals in less time than it took her to cut up the fruit. But the regular teacher was so nice and the space was great. The clincher was that they required six hours of parental time PER WEEK. It's not really designed for working adults. It's designed for families where one parent doesn't work, and the other makes a butload of $$$$. Plus, until we move to Harrison Street, it will be very difficult to get him there.  So, we called our local Mulberry. They're significantly cheaper and they don't require a parent helper. The only caveat could be he'll start when he's 12 months, and the toddler room starts at 15. I think it would be really tough on him if he has to switch classrooms after three months. But this way we can keep Sara the Super Nanny part time. I really want to keep her together with Eric.  The upshot of the day was that we learned that sending him to daycare is the right thing to do. He was so happy to be there looking at the other kids and exploring the room without somebody chasing after him. There seem to be no catboxes at daycare :-). When they all sat down for story time, he sat down too. He was the only kid there trying to eat the book, but he seemed to get it.  Sara the Super Nanny was sick today for the first time since I went back to work in November. Fortunately I already took the day off to visit the pre-school, so she couldn't have picked a better day. We're so lucky like that.  We're off to Minnesota in a couple weeks. I haven't been there since my grandmother's 75th birthday party in 1993. We're paying for this trip ourselves. We NEVER pay for our vacations. We usually go to Florida to see my grand'rents or go to The Farm. Both trips are all expenses paid for the most part. But I think it's really important to bring Eric to meet my aunts and my grandmother. I also really want him to meet Kathy and Bill, the parents of the Eric he was named after.  Should be a good trip.

      Memorial Day Weekend 2004  We headed west around 5 on Friday and got to The Farm around 7:30. It was just family this weekend. Zaida, The Neice, was up with my parents since Thursday. Sarah turned up late Saturday night. We hiked up the mountain with The Boy in a backpack. He's started wanting to nurse all the time again, day and night. It's strange. He seems to be going through phases. Perhaps it's the fact that he suddenly has 7 teeth. Tonight it's only 9:30 and he's woken up crying 4 times. But usually we just go back in there and make shushhing noises and he goes back to sleep.  But the weekend was lovely. My mother got a six burner stove, so GO MOM. With all the cooking we do out there, it really makes sense. They're in the process of reconfiguring the kitchen to create more counter space. However I don't think they'll actually get anything until they find something PERFECT. And that's tough.  Somebody in Salem is selling  urlLink this house . I totally want it. I've had this fantasy about living in a converted church. As much as I love Salem, I don't want to live there right now. I'd rather be closer to my parents. We hang out with them a lot. I like having the help with my kid :-) And all our friends are here!!

      They don't update the "Blogs of Note" very often do they? I was kind of grooving on that Andy Kaufman one. It was nice to pretend he was still alive. but I guess the joke got old. He hasn't written for nearly a month.  yesterday  it was my birthday. It was an astonishingly low key event at my office. Recently our office manager decided we weren't going to have birthday parties any more. Which is fine, but now nobody even says happy birthday. I'm getting a little  sick of it.  Rich is miserable at work. He comes home pale and stressed looking like his soul is slowly being sucked from his ear. I really want him to quit, but it just seems better for us if he waits until September, unless of course he finds another job in the interim. I'm keeping my fingers crossed. In September, I'll go back to work full time. To say the least, I have mixed feelings about this. I do like my job, I like it a lot. But I don't make enough money to pay for fulltime childcare and groceries for me and my family. Rich has to give me an allowance. I can't believe how expensive groceries are. I thought me cooking all the time would be cheaper than going out to eat and getting takeout-- and it is, but not cheaper enough. My point is, that I won't be netting much more than I am now after paying for 5 days a week in childcare. AND I won't have a full day to spend with The Boy and run errands.  I was feeling outrageously guilty this morning about not wanting to be a Stay-at-home-mom. I feel like it means that I don't love my baby enough. But I love my baby more than I ever imagined possible. He is my favorite person in the whole world. When he's resting in my arms I feel like I'm holding the worlds most precious gift. That ring from Lord of the Rings has 1% of the allure of my son (who has all the draw and none of the evil) But I don't want to not work. I see so many women who didn't like their jobs much and thought, "I know.. I'll have a baby and I won't work for a while!" And they're even more miserable than they were before. but now they're racked with guilt about being miserable. I think, the best thing we can do for our kids is be happy. I know some SAHMS that are SO happy with that choice. There's nowhere else they'd rather be, and I know some that seem to want to eat their own heads. The most ideal choice for me, would be to continue working part time. But methinks that's not an option. My second choice is to get paid really well so that I'm not just breaking even on the childcare and the groceries. My third choice is to stay where I am, because at least at Emerson, I can have a very regular schedule.

      Looks like I'm ranting today...  There are a few things I'd like never to see in the news again.   One: The interworkings of the Catholic Church, I mean NOTE to the press. For the millions of NON and NON-Practicing Catholics in Massachusetts, we don't really care what Parishes are closing, nor who has been slated to run what. I have worked at many different companies in Boston and maybe one percent of the people I've worked with are practicing Catholics. They closed a public school in Somerville this year and there was no Globe coverage of that. I'm sure it effected as many people as Our Lady or Perpetual Grilled-Cheese-Sandwiches or whatever it's called, over in (Insert Random Boston borough here). Yes, I do think it's news that they've been covering up decades worth of child abuse. But they report it like these guys are elected officials. Report it in the Catholic press, but don't waste precious airtime on it. The more time wasted on who is going to be the archbishop of whatever, the less time is devoted to exposing the hideousness of the Bush administration.   Two: I'd like never to see: "President" Bush with out the word "Former" before it.   Three: I would really like never to see Jennifer Lopez. I despise her. I've tried to watch a couple of her movies and she's such a zero talent. And they've all flopped!! Why do they keep casting her? Her music is completely devoid of soul and originality. I just don't get it. Why is she such a celebrity? I totally see the appeal of say, Beyonce, even if I don't particularly enjoy her music. When did the Boston Globe become a gossip tabloid? When did it become a mouthpiece for the Catholic Church?  Enough ranting. My birthday is coming up on Thursday. I'll be the big Three FOUR! I think I'm practicing getting crochety. I cut all my hair off, or at least a good ten inches of it. and it's light brown instead of blonde who knew? But now, the magnificent little dude can not grab it as easily.  Speaking of the dude, he had a little fever on Sunday. But it seemed to have resolved itself by the end of the day. I've been letting him crawl around the sandy area in our local playground. He loves it. He gets filthy, but he's a little boy. That's what they do.  We signed him up for 2 or 3 days a week at our local Mullbery daycare in Davis Square. It's not ideal. I'd like somewhere a little more touchy-feely. But I think he'll do just fine there. Once he's two, hopefully we'll send him to  urlLink Bigelow  where my neice went. She did really well there. The best thing about Mullbery is that they let the kids fingerpaint with pudding. How cool is that?

      We're off to Minnesota for a week tomorrow so no blogging for a week or so. I know my vast public will be SO disappointed!!   Thanks to Rich's inattention to details, we now have an extra thousand dollars. He didn't know we were escrowing our insurance, so he went to pay it. But I said he didn't have to, and I was right, so GO ME.  Eric was really fun today. Rich surprised me by telling me he had to day off. He didn't want to tell me ahead of time in case it didn't work out. But last night he brought home "50 First Dates" and said we could stay up late and watch it because he didn't have to work tomorrow. Fifty First Dates was way better than I expected. David Lindsay-Abaire who I went to college with wrote a play about a woman who lost her memory every time she went to sleep. The movie stole much of that plot, but it wasn't dark like David's play.  It took me two hours to get Eric to take a 40 minute nap. sigh.. My breasts are completely flat from all the nursing.  Breastfeeding was such a monumental struggle for me for the first few months. My nipples split in two and it was the most painful thing I've ever done (including labor). I had to stop nursing on my right side and just pump because my nipple was so badly damaged. I almost gave up after 12 weeks, but it got easier. From the time I started nursing in the hospital it was so painful. I couldn't believe it. Every time he latched on my toes would curl and I'd try not to scream. I took naproxin three times a day just to get through the pain. It hurt when I wasn't nursing and it hurt more when I was. But it just started to get better and then it stopped hurting completely. I can't believe how easy it is now. I'm so glad I stuck with it.   Now I just have to  worry about weaning him..  It's always something!!!

      From Rich about his morning with The Boy:  "Yeah we had much fun.  After breakfast and a change we went to the park.  We played on the swing ... he didn't think much of the slide ... he had a great time in "the tube" standing and looking through the holes until he fell on his butt ... then we played in the sand with the bucket and met "Colin" who was also wearing 18-month size clothes but who was actually 18 months old!  Once I could no longer keep him from eating the sand and sticks (I could keep the sticks out of his mouth but it was hard ... he got the sand past me once or twice) we headed home and I cleaned him up.  He drank a lot of water/juice (sand probably made him thirsty) and he fell asleep in my arms around 10:10.  When I left around 11:05 he was still asleep in the crib."

      I'm a little creeped out by the adds at the top of my 'blog. A rant about the Catholic church has caused "Meet Catholic Singles" to pop up. Not that I have anything against Catholic singles. My husband was a Catholic until it was time for his confirmation and he told the priest that he didn't want to say those things. And the priest said OK. And that was that. I don't think he's been in church since, except to go to weddings.  Eric slept well last night, but he woke up at 6:30 and nursed and chatted for a half an hour before Rich finally got up and played with him. I swear he knew it was Thursday-- the day that Rich spends the morning with him.  I'm always on the cusp of sleep deprivation. I do crave a full night's sleep-- no brief awakenings to pee or to nurse, just straight through sleep. It sounds better than chocolate cheesecake to me at this point. Although last night was entirely my fault. I decided I wanted to finish "A Dark Adapted Eye" by Barbara Vine/Ruth Rendell. But Eric woke up around midnight and I took him into my bed as per usual.  I ended up with about 10 pages left which I finished on the T this morning. He is doing better (knocking on wood and crossing my fingers). I can put him to bed between 7:30 and 8 and not hear him cry or anything until 11 or 12. Last night he wasn't even crying. I just heard him waking up and moving around on the monitor because I was awake. I went into his room and he was sitting up in his bed blinking and rubbing his eyes. I changed is super-wet diaper (which usually elicits sobbing at that time of night, but he seemed pretty cheerful about the event last night). I honestly don't know when he woke me up to nurse -- or if it was once or twice before our 6:30 AM chat/nursefest 2004. He sleeps snuggled up between me and his dad.   I work with so many college-aged men. I see them and think that their parents must have blinked and whoops.. their boys were off to college. This baby time is so brief, so unique. I know we'll have a battle to get him our of our bed at some point, but I just don't care. I love having him snuggled up against me in the night. I know he's safe and loved. And he knows it too. When he sleeps alone, he wakes up and cries and he's disoriented. When he wakes up with us he's happy and chatty. Fortunately for us, he's not a thrasher, he's a snuggler. Yeah.. a snuggler.

      Rich and I finally got a chance to take in a movie last Saturday. We saw Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban. It's a little dull to watch a movie like that when you know from the start that this scary dog chasing Harry is really his beloved godfather just trying to clear his name. I think it was better than the other movies, but it was a little lacking in exposition at the end. If I hadn't read the book, I would have left it more confused that I should have. I want to see the Stepford Wives, but I don't think we'll be getting to another movie any time soon. We're just in TiVo country now! That's how we watch T3-- Which was incidentally a setup for T4.. However how were they to know that Arnold was to become governor of California and hence not available for Terminator movies. I'm sure the franchise will continue.  When we went to see Harry Potter, Sarah watched Eric for us for 3 hours. She was SO tired chasing after the two of them. We came back to her house and she and Zaida were sacked out on her bed with Eric between them bopping around. He of course fell asleep in the car on the way home.  I've been so happy at home lately. Eric has gotten genuinely affectionate. He give hugs and snuggles, and big wet sloppy things that I think he thinks are kisses. But they're completely lovely. I've always considered myself a very loving person, but parenthood has brought out another level of love that I didn't know about. It's like discovering a color that you've never seen before. It's new, complete, profound and overwhelming. I love him so much. It's going to be so hard to watch him discover the world is unfair. But we just have to teach him that he's strong and that he can handle it. Part of the reason it's so important to me to work, is to that we will have the money to pay for private school if we need to.   Yesterday we were playing and he almost pulled my nose off my face.   It was cool.

      I had a bar-b-que for my birthday on Sunday. It was just lovely. We ate and ate. I made a great marinade with balsamic vinnegar, maple syrup garlic, thyme, evoo and rosemary. It was VERY tasty.   I'm a little sick. My throat hurts and I'm extra tired. I made some turkey burgers and salad for dinner and now I'm chilling with The Husband and watching T3, which I never got around to seeing. I wish our computers fixed themselves as fast as The Terminators.  The Boy is doing fabulous. He's pulling himself up to a standing position and he'll start cruising any minute. he's so obviously proud of himself every time he does it.   I'm reading "A Dark Adapted Eye" by Ruth Rendell. I saw a BBC miniseries based on it YEARS ago. I loved it, it was so spooky. But now I remember the little boy in it loses his family because his mother kills his aunt, and everybody is too ashamed of what happened to take him in. I can't bear stories about sweet little boys being unloved. I'm a big dork or a big softie. I can't quite make up my mind which.

      I have a new favorite book  I read  urlLink The Time Traveler's Wife   while I was on vacation. What a fabulous book. I can see why it's been spending so much time on these bestseller lists. It's one of those books that make me gnash my teeth with envy. Why didn't *I* come up with that? She deals with time travel, in the context of a love story, not as science fiction. It's just wonderful, engrossing and all that good stuff.

      We're back from our trip. It was very restorative in all ways.   We started out in Minneapolis. Eric was very good on the plane. However, I don't think I'll do another flight where he doesn't have his own seat. It's just too hard. We spent the first night at my uncle's house amid their clutter. But they are very loving and open people so we felt very welcome and wanted. They live inches from one of Minnesota's 10,000 lakes and we were able to go for a spin in my uncle's boat. Rich rode on the jet ski and he fell off. My uncle's house is in a fabulous location. The back walls are almost all glass and they have an un-obstructed view of the lake. However, the walls are covered in teak wood paneling and the floors have orangey carpeting. It is straight out of the 1950's. The formal living area has some type of stone floors, but they look like linoleum because of the flecked pattern on them.  the following morning we headed up to Laporte Minnesota about 200 miles northwestish. Once again Eric was a trooper for most of the trip. We stopped for lunch at a diner about an hour South of my aunt's house. He ate cheerios and I ate some very tasty strawberry pie with extra coolwhip. YUM!! We got to my aunt's house around 3, and my father's oldest sister was there as well. She was with her daughter Jennifer (who is 5 months pregnant) and her husband. Everybody was so good to Eric. My aunt Donna (Dad's youngest sister) had two miniature horses. They were SO cute.   We spent a lovely relaxing week there. We stayed at a cabin about a mile from my aunt's house. I got a pedicure at a salon in Walker, Minnesota called "The Razor's Edge." It was one of the nicest pedicures ever. The woman really took her time and said it was her favorite thing to do. She was five months pregnant and still working hard. I didn't realize until later that she was. I hope those chemicals they use for nails don't hurt her baby.  Eric was a superstar. He crabbed for his sleep in the middle of some fun moments and we had to leave. But my GOD he's a good baby.  After our week at the  urlLink Cry of the Loon Lodge  we headed back down to Minneapolis. We got to visit with the Kemper family. My friend Emily Schwartz now Kemper happened to be in Minneapolis from Houston at the same time we were there. The big news is that Eric had is first kiss with Emily's daughter Fronia. It was very cute. At two, she knows how to give a hug and a kiss, and she did and a lightbulb flashed above Eric's head and he grabbed her back and touched her cheek with his lips. Of course we had put all the cameras away by then. But it was still fun.  There's some huge news coming here next week. But I don't want to post it in case it falls into the wrong eyes...

      Faux marble rules.  As usual I'm watching some variant of HGTV. I'm SO hooked.   I'm completely spent tonight. more so than usual, and I'm not sure why. I went to Trader Joe's this morning. Then I got The Boy to take a short nap and we had lunch. Then I took him into Boston on the T for the first time.   It was FABULOUS.   The elevators on the T are horrific. And from what I understand they're better than they use to be. They're slow and they smell like pee. And even worse, they don't always work. I had to schlep Eric's stroller down a couple flights of stairs at South Station. This was after we found the out-of-the-way elevator that went to the hallway to the Redline. When I got out of the Long Hallway, I wasn't sure which way the redline was because of the throng of commuters flooding from the door I was supposed to go in. I thought maybe they were getting off a different train. (no idea why I thought that, I guess I was still rattled from the Long Hallway). But I shoved the stroller through the throng and found the turnstyles. Then I found the elevator down to the platform was out. So I carried the stroller down. It was heavy and people were trying to get around me. Cranky people were trying to get around me.  But it was a lovely day. Eric and I went to the Frog Pond downtown, where he splashed and frolicked. He kept trying to crawl through the water. His head was well above the surface, but I was worried he'd fall and drown. So I held his hands and he walked through the water taking these giant steps. He moves his feet as far apart as possible then throws his weight in the direction he wants to go. If we're holding him he can lurch quite a ways like that. Only this time, he was trying to splash as much water as possible while we he walked. Then I took him up and his diaper weighed about 15 lbs and puffed his little tushy out like a bowling ball was stuffed underneath his onesie.   But I got him into dry clothes on the grass on the Boston Common. He played with a ziplock bag full of cheerios to distract him while I snuck the new clothes on him. Getting him dressed is all about distractions these days. Unless he's holding an object that he thinks he's not supposed to have, he just flips around and around and it's impossible to fasten his diaper, wipe his tushie, dress him, undress him, put lotion on him and all the other things you need to do to a baby to keep him safe and dry.  Then we went by my office for a visit. He played with all my coworkers. Then I took him to Rich's office and he played with Rich's coworkers. He was a hit. He didn't fuss at all, he just flirted with everybody and had a great time.   My parents came over for dinner. I made a marinade with Dijon mustard, maple syrup, red wine, chicken broth, balsamic vinegar and orange zest. It came out fabulous.  All in all it was an A+ day with my family.

      Last night Rich rented  urlLink The Station Agent  a study in trains and boredom. OK, it wasn't that bad, but I don't think trainspotting is a very interesting hobby.  When I was pregnant we were channel surfing and I changed the channel off of some shark thing Rich was watching. Then I stopped on some restoration drama starring (of course) Colin Firth. Rich said, "When we have the baby there will be more sharks and less Colin Firth around here."  Last night he said: "Did you like it better than a shark movie?"  "Yes"  "Did you not like it as much as a Colin Firth movie?"  "Yes"  "In that case, it was the perfect compromise. Right?"  Tee hee.. my husband is so funny. I want a divorce!!

      Thursday night, something kind of snapped in me. Eric's waking up to nurse every couple hours and I just can't take it any more. So, about five Thursday morning, I drew the line and said no more nursing until the morning. He cried and thrashed for an hour and I rubbed his back and told him it was OK, and he fell asleep until 8.  &nbsp;  Then Eric looked really tired yesterday around 1:45, soI tried to put him down for a nap. Same thing happened that morning and I spent nearly 2 hours (nursing/rocking) trying to get him to take a nap that lasted exactly a half hour. So, Friday afternoon I went to put him down with much rocking and nursing and he stood up in his crib as soon as I put him in there. So I just decided that he was going to get his nap, and he needs to learn that he has to at least try to go to sleep when it's time. So, an hour of heart-wrenching crying later he took an hour an a half nap.  &nbsp;  Then today, he seems to understand that I'll stay with him and help him go to sleep as long as he's trying. But as soon as he pops up and starts messing around, I'll go stand at the door. This afternoon I stood at the door for a total of 2 minutes and he got it. He has to lie down and try to go to sleep when it's bedtime/naptime. It takes him a while to fall asleep, but at least he really gets that it's what he's supposed to be doing.  &nbsp;  My goal is to work on falling asleep in the crib without hours of rocking or nursing first. I still rock him and nurse him first to get him in the mood. But I'm not waiting until he's just on the brink of sleep. Because if I do that, and I put him down asleep he doesn't sleep as well if he did it himself. I'm really astounded that he figured out what I was after in a day. Especially considering that I wasn't sure what the goal was initially, other than I needed him to fall asleep on his own for his naps. And I needed to be able to put him down a little more awake at night. So, as long as he's lying down I'll stroke his back and legs and that seems to make him very happy. And it helps him fall asleep. We'll work on less night waking next. I'd be totally happy with one night waking after he comes to bed with us. This process has been empowering and horrific.  &nbsp;  I told my mom what was going on and she was very supportive. She said that kids don't want to be in charge. They want a vote, but they want you to run things for them. That made sense to me. I think what made me able to stomach this, was the first time I did it, he was lying in bed next to me. So apart from me not letting him nurse, he was being held by me and Rich. That first night, Rich took him and changed his diaper to make sure he'd be comfortable once he found out what I had decided to do. So, I know he didn't feel abandoned. This morning around 5(after much nursing) he wanted to nurse again and I held him and petted his legs and he whined and whimpered back to sleep, but didn't cry. Overall he was a little subdued today -- a little more clingy than usual. But he was fine. I was really careful to spend a lot of time with him and nursed him whenever he asked.  &nbsp;  So, I feel like a changed person. I swore I'd never let him cry it out. But I needed to do something.&nbsp; And suddenly, I felt like we were ready to get to the next level. And I thought it was really important to do it before he started walking. I had been trying and trying to help him learn this stuff without any crying, but we had made almost no progress in MONTHS.  &nbsp;  So on the one hand, I'm an evil villain. On the other hand, my son finally understands what he's supposed to do when I turn down the lights and lay him down in his crib.  &nbsp;  This is tough. But I'm sure it will get much tougher. And he brings me so much joy, sometimes I feel my heart will burst.

      I'm on Day 3 or 4 of Eric sleeping in his crib all night. I watched that commerical yesterday where the middle aged couple chases giant "Z"s with legs through a landscape of twilight strip malls. That's me right now. Only I look as desparate as a diabetic child in a candy shop. It's so close.. but it's not for me. Only the insanity has just begun. I can't believe Donald Rumsfeld thought that depriving inmates of sleep wasn't torture. I feel like the front right side of my brain has frozen into a thick chunk of lead.  Sleep. It's all I can think about. I want it more than food, sex or chocolate. I want to go to sleep, and stay asleep for five or six hours.  The nights are going like this.&nbsp; He goes down at 8, no problem. He's up at 1 to nurse. Then he goes back down. But this whole process takes about an hour. Then it takes me an hour to fall back to sleep. I can hardly fault Eric for taking his time getting back to sleep at night. God knows I can't do it. So, I fall asleep at three and he wakes us up at 5. Then I get him back to sleep without nursing. He really works at it, so it's not like I feel like it's OK to let him cry.  I think this will go on about a week, and then we'll be down to 1 night waking. These two are just habit. I can hear him waking up and going back to sleep at other times. It's just that he thinks it's time to nurse. So he wakes up all the way. My theory is that if there's no nursing he'll stop waking up.  I think this is the most tired I've ever been since I had him.  I really don't mind the first time he wakes up.&nbsp; We nurse and cuddle in the dark and he goes back to sleep. But he really wants me in the room while he does that. I've been creeping closer to the door every time he falls alseep. Eventually, I'll stand more or less out of sight and he won't need&nbsp;my help.  But there has been progress. We went from 3-5 night wakings in our bed to two, in his own bed. But none of us were sleeping well with him there any more. This is really hard. But it really feels like the right thing to do now. He's adapting really well to the new routine. If I could just get him to not wake up at five I would be so happy.  I'm not praying about this. Now, I only pray for good health for my family. I don't want to waste my prayers on anything that I know I can live through. I just pray for help being a good mother.  I don't believe in organized religion, but I do believe in God.

      What a difference a couple days make.  &nbsp;  Yes, I still feel guilty about letting him cry on Friday. But he knows how to fall asleep now, and he keeps getting better at it. Yesterday, I told Sara The Wonder Nanny that she was to put him in his crib awake. This elicited a deer-in-the-headlights look of fear. But I told her to give it a try.  &nbsp;  Not only did he go down, he did so quickly and with no crying or fussing. Then he did it again for his afternoon nap. This is amazing.  &nbsp;  Now Eric is not a fussy guy in general. That's part of why it was such a heart-wrenching decision to let him cry. He only cries when he's trying to tell me something is wrong, and I was terrified I'd break that covenant with him. He cries, I try to fix whatever is bothering him. But we were getting nowhere with his sleeping.  &nbsp;  Last night he went down with nary a peep. I sat in the glider in the corner. He thrashes around until he achieves the perfect frog position, his legs tucked neatly underneath him with his tushy sticking up in the air. Then he picks up his head to check and see if I'm there, and he falls asleep. A day ago, I had to stand over his crib stroking his hair and help him stay focused. Now I just do that if he forgets to lie down. I sit and make the occasional shusshing noise and presto! He falls asleep. But now he stays asleep until close to 2:00 AM, and that folks is the medical definition of a baby sleeping through the night.  &nbsp;  Then last night he came in bed with me an nursed and he proceeded to thrash around. It's so cute. One of the positions he tries is leaning back on Rich resting his head sideways, arms akimbo. He looks like a dude in a movie theater trying to look casual as he attempts to cop a feel. It's especially cute if he leans back on his dad and yawns.  &nbsp;  But last night I thought,&nbsp;"If he's going to thrash, he may as well thrash in the crib, because there's no way I'm falling asleep&nbsp;before he does at this rate."&nbsp;So, I recribified him, stood over him for a few minutes and then worked my way to the glider and dozed while he got himself back to sleep. Then I went back to bed. At five he woke up.&nbsp;(He usually nurses around 5, but I'd rather he did it after 6:30 when it's officially OK to get us up.) So, I sat there&nbsp;dozing in my chair and it was about half an hour from start to finish and he was down again with no crying, just some thrashing. It was pretty amazing. A week ago, he was waking me up every 2 hours to nurse, and now he seems OK sleeping in his crib.  &nbsp;  Tonight, I think I'll nurse him in his room at 2, and put him back down in the crib. I could probably make him sleep completely through the night with no nursing, but I don't want to push for that until he's one. But that will be in about six weeks, so it's good that we're working toward that.

      Today was the first day of the rest of my life.  I signed my first (I'm sure of thousands) permission slip for my child. We dropped him off at Daycare today for the first time ever. He was so enthralled with the teachers and the toys, he didn't even notice that we left.  He slept badly last night. He woke up and fussed every few hours. Eventually it would get bad enough for us to go in there and pet him. I think he was cold, because we'd put his blanket on him and that seemed to solve it... Until he kicked it off... Then a few hours later, fussing. But he stayed lying down in the crib all night and ended up getting up for the day around 7, so it wasn't too bad. We just had to visit him 3 times in the night. It's like Marley said "You will be visited by your parents 3 times tonight!"

      In other exciting Eric news.. He's been standing on his own these last few days.  The first time it was an accident. He was holding and empty water bottle in his hand and put his other hand on it, then he had this Wyle E. Coyote moment where he realized he was standing on his own and fell WHAM on his butt. I swear if he could have whipped out a sign that said "Uh Oh" he would have.  He's standing more and more, and Rich said he took a step yesterday too. It's just so amazing.  Big birthday bash for him coming up on the last Sunday in August.  It should be fun.

      Oh Happy, Happy Day!  We went on vacation at The Farm last week. Eric slept in the room adjacent to ours. The rooms are joined by a pair of French doors. I was going in at 3 to nurse him when he fussed. But I realized that he was grumping on his tummy because he was trying to get back to sleep. So, instead of picking him up, changing and nursing him. I made that shushing noise that helps him get back to sleep.  Then the next day, I put him down around 7. Lo and Behold!! I woke up around 5 and realized I had not heard a peep out of him all night. He woke up at about 5:45 for the day, and WHOO HOO! He's pretty much been spending the night in his crib -- uninterrupted ever since. He sleeps from about 7 or 8 to 5:30 to 6:30 depending on the day. I don't begrudge him the early start because I get to SLEEP at night.  Oh happy, happy night.  Zaida came over on Sunday night for a party we threw for Sara the Wonder Nanny. Zaida FINALLY decided to play with Eric. They played a game she named "Escape" where she crawled in lightening-fast circles around our den and Eric chased her shrieking with complete and utter joy. He was all sweaty and exhausted at the end, so we gave him a cool bath and put him to bed. He was asleep in an instant, and didn't wake up until 6:30!!  This is huge. I totally didn't expect this to happen so quickly. I've learned so much.  If I put him in his crib, and he doesn't want to nap and he's fussing and hopping up, I just leave the room once or twice and then he'll settle down and listen to me and he'll fall asleep. However, usually I just have to lay him down a couple times and he decides he wants to sleep.  If he pops up and sings to himself for a while, and he's cheerful and won't sleep, I take that to mean that he's really NOT tired, and we go play. Now that the crib thing is pretty well established we can abort a nap and it doesn't really affect the next one.  In other GINORMOUS news, my darling husband is now unemployed. After much rumination and discussion, he quit his job before we went on vacation. He's networking his big tushie off trying to figure out what he wants to do with his life. While this means we take a financial hit, I'm really happy about it. I've never seen him this contented.  It also means that he takes care of Eric in the morning so I can get my relatively well-rested self off to work on time for once! So whoo HOO!  Life is good.  Margaret
