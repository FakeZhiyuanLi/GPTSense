						   Finally hitting a dry track Phantom Rose put in a much better performance. Carrying 119 lbs. she finiished 5f in 101.99.&nbsp; After todays performance there is hope that her mothers talents have been passed on. However there is still a long way to go. She will now go into a training program to bring out the best in her.

						   A 2 year old filly out of Quest for Glory and Cup Day.  She has hit the track twice at Lone Star but was unlucky hitting a muddy and sloppy track.  So far she has run sixth and seventh.   This has not put me off as I know somewhere within this filly are the abilities of her mother. I will find them a draw them out.  She is now at ELP and will cross our fingers for a dry track. She races again on the 18th of July.  Stay tuned we will hear more of this filly.

						   If you are after cheap claims keep an eye on CBY. Most will be in the $4 and $5 claimers. I won't tell you they are good because if they were they would not be there. But, perhaps there is something that you may want to work with.

						   Unfortunately Power and the Glory had to be a late scratching in the Scuylerville &nbsp;due to not enough training. Now she has transfered to Del Mar in hopes of lining up on the 7th in the next Grade II.

						   With high expectations for her this race, it was not to be. She started slow and when she had room to run I thought she would pick it up but instead DR Flores ran her straight into the back of Ramathorn. And then she was done for the day. I don't think i can take much from this race as I noted Easy Rhythm finished behind her. &nbsp; She is one tough horse to manage as she gains stamina at 9-10% per night. Her works say she doesn't run as fast with blinkers but perhaps it's time to try. Or perhaps I need to remove the shadow roll being as her best race to date was without it. &nbsp; So now it's off to SAR to contest the Grade II over 6f for fillies on the 28th. &nbsp; &nbsp;

						   Power and the Glory is a 2 year old filly which was born in January 2004.  She has now hit the track 5 times and been in the money every time. In her second start she put up a track record at Lone Star over 4 1\2f on the dirt.  In the Hollywood park  Nursery  she came in third place.  She then traveled to Belmont to win the  Fashion  in fine style.  Her latest start was in the Tremont where she placed third not being able to match it with the boys.  Best workouts : 3f on dirt 34.1     Lone Star                 6f on dirt 1:12.2   Hollywood park  Her next race will be to contest the HOL Juvenile Championship - Grade III against the boys. Her light weight should play an important role here. Stay tuned for more.

						   In an expensive lesson Papa Bear scorches the turf in The Read Handicap - Grade I. After that race Brew will search for races just against 3 year olds. I guess he is just not ready to take on the older horses. It has been a valuablelesson though. Next up may be a turf race at SAR on the 9th.

						   A 3 year old named Brew started his racing career for the JHamilton stables in November 2003. Jhamilton immediately gelded him early in his career.  He started his career with a track record over 1 1\8 on the Hollywood Park dirt in a maiden.  He then went on to win 2 of his next three races in allowance company.  Then it was on to  The Caltech Handicap  with a concincing win over 1 1\8 on the turf carrying 122 lbs.  He then had concentration problems that led to failure in the SA Derby.  He then ran second to Knighthood in the  Coolmore Lexington   who has gone on to bigger and better things.  He then headed to Churchill Downs in the  Crown Royal American Turf   over 1 1\16th on the turf to record a track record.  Then came  The Will Rogers   He ran fourth after not handling the pure speed in the race.  And then came the biggest race of his career,  The Belmont Stakes  He raced very well on the dirt against some of the very best 3 year olds going around at the time. He was able to run fourth.  And the most recent race was The Cinema BC Handicap back at Hollywood Park. The poor performance in this race can only be explained away due to a bad day at the track.  In another big test in his career and hopefully a return to form. Brew has been sent to DMR to contest The Read Handicap - Grade I. On arrival today he was sent out with the trainer to put in a 1 1\8 workout on the turf. He was a little sluggish due to being over rested from travel but he did the trip in 1:51.4. Its not a great time but he will improve as get closer to race day.

						   In his 3rd race with 2 wins under his belt Arwon tackled the Sanford over 6f. He ran up to his ability finishing in 1:13. He managed a third place earning him $22.50 and 2 valuable BC&nbsp;points.

						   For the first time in a year I have&nbsp;pulled most of my entries and have an almost empty entry list. It has come the time for a real stable assessment. &nbsp; For the next couple months stable horses will go into intensive training to see what they can really do. The best to DMR, average to ELP, and the rest to CBY. The only entries for awhile will be a maiden or two and stakes races for the best in the stable. Last night about 25 horses came back into work from the farm. Nothing spectacular from their first work.  &nbsp; I have&nbsp;sent about a dozen no hopers to the glue factory. And yet I still have 125 horses with at least a dozen more on the way at the end of the month.  &nbsp; Will be a quiet couple months but can only improve some of the decent stock in my stable.&nbsp;
