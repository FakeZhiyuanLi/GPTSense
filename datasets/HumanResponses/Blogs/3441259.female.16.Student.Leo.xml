       [The Empty Streets]      It was as she expected it to be...            He  had always returned home at the stroke of nine o'clock, when it seemed as if the lights were shinning at its finest. She'd been watching him from her apartment that vaulted just a crossed the street from his humble abode. Her hazel brown pools, the orb like eyes, concentrated on him from time to time. Always noting when he had changed his hair or done something new with his appearance. Each morning she would wake up to the sound of his guitar. And the smell of his cigarettes would shift its scent through her window, which was lined with black curtains. Ribbons of silk and lace hung among the thin sheets of drapery that almost seemed transparent when the brightest rays of light shot through the fabric like material. That night she slept, her eyes peering out her window to his room. He was smoking yet another stick of cancer, letting the red embers drift flawlessly into the wind. Soon, her body would wander over to the massive window, as sweet summer breezes thrust into her room carrying along with it the scent of his body - and his cigarette. The man looked at her as he exhaled a puff of smoke and his dark sapphire eyes would scan her body for a second, flicking his cigarette so the ashes would fly into the air. He had seen that she was a thin girl, beautiful - small, compact and something about her had always lead up to question of what nationality she was. Her skinned was sun kissed, lightly tanned and her eyes were like gems. They were naturally bigger than the average gaze was; they were like orbs and in the darkness the color of her eyes seemed jet black. The girl slid her hands over her body, wrapping her long sleeping gown around her frail frame. Long strands of her obsidian hair, which had some hints of brownish highlights in them, swayed gentle in the warm breezes. The man leaned over his windowsill as if he was trying to get a closer look all he did was smile, and as he smiled he put out the fire that was in-between his fingers. Stretching, he would slowly back away from the window. His eyes never left her, white curtains flung over his body, and he would disappear from her view, when the wind had stopped its rampage.  He had vanished.  [ Inspiration:  The thing is, I just described myself as the main girl character. And the boy, well I don't know who it is yet -- blue eyes I just love blue eyes and maybe I'll make him have dark hair. Yes, my dream guy.]        The  next morning, she had woken up to the same smell - smoke. She did not bother to remove herself from her bed, but she just turned her head allowing her eyes to peek outside her window. He was there, smoking away his life, peering into her bedroom. He could see her lying in her bed perfectly, this time he was sitting in a chair that was stationed beside his window. Leaning against the windowsill, he watched her in silence, letting the stick burn to ash in-between his figures. The girl was silent, soon her gaze lifted from the man's form and she shifted her body to face away from him. As she did so she heard a soft chuckle echoing softly from the man's general direction. She turned back quickly to see him, but he was gone. The only thing that remained was a blue rose that laid lifelessly on his window, some of the petals floating off into the air. A few of them would reach her room and float to the ground. She flung her blankets off of her, and walked over to the abandoned pieces. There were three of them, and as picked them up she smelt the warm smell of smoke, again. Those brown eyes of hers abruptly looked upward to see the man smoking again, and in his hand he held the rose. His free hand removed the stick from his mouth as another puff of smoke escaped his lips. He smiled. She shuffled her feet as she moved towards the window, and pulled the curtains shut. A small sigh and she placed the remains of the petals in a small wooden box that rested on her desk. The man left the rose on his windowsill, still keeping that smile on his face. He slowly worked his way out of his room, flinging his jacket over his shoulder as he strolled down the steps - that allowed him to exit his apartment complex. He was gone.   [ Inspiration:  The anime Cowboy Bebop is giving me a lot of inspiration. I have always admired blue roses -- it's my favorite flower. Something about cigarettes always give off a sort of mysterious air...]           Breakfast  was ready, she made it herself. A couple of slices of hash browns, a bowl of fruit salad and a glass of grape juice was what she had. She had always loved grape juice. It was one o'clock in the afternoon now. She usually slept in when she didn't have anything to do. She was an English teacher, who had many passions - such as the arts and music. Somehow everything had tired in, and her life was as perfect as anyone thought it could be. Either way, it was summer now and she had no classes to teach. Only a few letters of recommendation was all that really worried, her and to plan the course for next. She cleared the table jumping into the shower; she barely had time to submerge herself in the hot drops of liquid. She heard knocks on her door, so swiftly she wrapped a towel around her wet body and stumbled towards the door. The knocking had stopped and as she opened the door, revealing a small rectangle like box that was black in hue, lifelessly sitting there in the middle of the desolate hallway. She looked left and right to catch a glimpse of the man or woman who had left the package. She leaned over and grabbed the box in her hand, she closed her door - and as her eyes glanced out the windowâ€¦ He was there.  [ Inspiration:  Described my dreams and wants. The package was just something I thought up... I am trying to be mysterious and... I don't think I am succeeding very well. The shower scene was inspired by well... people have to keep clean and when I shower I always want it really hot for some reason.]   To be continued...

       Greetings ,        Somehow you came across this site. Whatever the reason, I am now going to tell you why I created this [website] in the first place. This site isn't just some ordinary journal online it is more of a story within a story. As I continue onward to create my story  "The Empty Streets,"  I will also reflect on what has happened in my life that changed how the story would go. I am thinking I would turn this into some sort of movie, anime drama, play or just a regular old book. Either way, I hope you enjoy my piece of work. You can post comments and whatnot; maybe you could get me to change a few things. Ideas are always welcomed. Further more, I look forward to the first few paragraphs I will be posting. Kick back and relax. Remember, I -am-  GOD .
