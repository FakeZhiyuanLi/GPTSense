      I went out today in the morning... to find my 2 st john cadets... they wanted to study First Aid... So i went out at 10+ and walk from my house to Braddell MRT station... halfway thru (abt 10.45), my cadets call and say that they are on their way here... i asked them where they are... they say they are at Queenstown... I was thinking "What the hell??? 10.45 and u r at Queenstown???"  i walk back to the market near my house... i eat wonton noodle... haha... tasty... then i walk back to the MRT station... on the way, i saw my primary sch friend... we juz exchanged a few words and left... nuntink to talk abt, seriously...  i walked to the MRT... feeling so SWEATY and SMELLY... puei!!! saw them coming out of the station... i 'scolded' them... hehe... we then walk out of the station... on the way up the escalator, i asked them why they wanto come braddell... they told me they wanto walk ard here... then i saw "open ur eyes and see what is braddell actually"... when we reached the top, my cadets were like "Huh?? All flats???"  I say, glad they know that... then we went into mac... they ate breakfast... finish liao, we walk to the study corner of a flat... the place is sooooo windy and cooling... haha... simply fantastic...  i went thru with them the whole First Aid manual with them... then some time later, a couple walk into the study corner... a PLUMP couple... then sat on the right side of the study corner and we sat on the left... they were talking so loud... i purposely tok louder to fight them... haha  one of my cadet say that the couple were looking over us here... then we begin discussing if they are robbers... haha... cuz they got the evil look... haha... then finally, finish teaching... we walk away in the speed of light... hehe...   The conclusion of today's event is that... Always siam(escape) when u see someone evil no matter he is actually good or not... haha...

      Actually, i get kinda bored once in a while... so i tend to think of the future... i suppose i will start thinking "what i will be doing in the future???"  then i will link back to the present... "what am i doing right now?"... i suppose i only have 1 answer... SLACKING!!! actually, to say frankly, i dun think that i am working towards my goal... SAJC!!! i am still playing and sleeping... not studying at all... it's oredy june le... i cant imagine wat i will be doing for my prelim... getting 60%+ and scoring top 10 and i am satisfied???  i simply cant imagine it!! that's totally absurd... how to go SAJC with that kinda result... i might as well go to poly!! or aim for pioneer jc or catholic jc... they dun even want me i suppose!!! NO WAY!!! I WUN LET SUCH THINGS HAPPEN ON ME!!!  there's one thing i shud clarify... i keep on saying i hate my class... actually, i shudn't use such a harsh word lah... i dun hate my class actually... i juz dun like... i am not motivated to study bah... if there's no motivation, i dun seem like working towards my goal... i seem like easily contented... as long as can get top 10 i satisfied? i dun think that's wat i want lah... i wanto see some competition in my class...  aniwaes, 402s... have u thought of wat happen when u come back and get ur O level result???  Will u be hugging one another and say "Hey, buddy... Long time no see" or u will be juz greet one another a "HI' and walk away??  What will u be doing when u get back ur o level result slip from ms lim? elated cuz u get extremely fabulous result? or sad becuz u din do well for certain subj?  that's tooooo far... hehe... dun think too much... WORK HARD bah!! maybe u may have a better senario than those mentioned...

FINALLY!!!  we met up and they went to 'bought' the tickets... then i chatted with liqing abt the sj teacher and her husband... haha... then all of them went downstairs to eat mosburger... i stayed upstairs to eat long john with liqing... cuz... both of us cannot eat beef... haha...  times up... we proceeded into the threatre... the movie started... we sat right at the back... the sound effect so bombastic siaz... the show quite nice actually... abit sad, so many ppl died... abit happy... sam and his father finally met up... some parts quite funny... but overall i graded the show alright lah... hui kheng and shu hsien cried... i say they all siao... where got ppl watch show until cry one... not as if the show is meant to be sorrowful... oh yah, smth i find it funny... there's this gal sitting in front of hui kheng... when it came to the part of the wolf attacking sam they all, this gal like siao one... like jumping up liddat... then me and hui kheng keep on giggling... but frankly speaking, that part was really scary... REALLY!!!  then liqing some sort fell asleep... haha... then the rest of us continued watching... i felt so cold!!! luckily i brought jacket... but still very cold... haha... then i begin to think of biology... when we enter the cinema and exit the cinema, pupil reflex action... haha... then when we feel cold, it's homeostasis... crapzz  finally the movie ended... we left the theatre.. we were dicussing where to go... liqing and linus left first... then i realize i am the only 'extra' left... i am the only 402 left... in fact all along... but at least got liqing (403) one, then i dun feel odd... she left liao... then the whole lot of ppl from 404... omg.. i decided to left too... i walk to the bus stop and take 105 (towards toa payoh, of course)... i wanto watch tv.. my fav jap show last episode today...  managed to reach home at 3pm... my show half gone... nvm lah... actually i wanto watch the last part... the guy accepted the gal he dislike in the past... haha... sounds romantic? to me no lah... juz find that i like this funny show...  as i lied on the sofa watching tv, my left side of my head suddenly hurts... very pain... i went to take a shower... then i log on to the internet... and here i am typing out an entry with my headache... ouch...  muz go rest le... cya :p

      Hehe...Shuli... relax lah... Nuntink can be impossible (though sometimes i tout so..) ...  Friends can be a real headache(sometimes)... hehe... my personal opinion lah... one thing, u wanto trust them fully, yet u afraid that they'll betray u... or sometimes, u dun even noe how u have offended them, that makes them so angry (speaking from experience)...  U know once, during sec 2, i really dunno wat have gone into me... i quarrel with someone considered my friend for no reason... but then i realise it's my fault? did i apologise or not? i forgotten... hehe  but frankly speaking, the education systems is sort of disruptive lah... breaking all of us up... i missed my 202 life... cuz i was really freak off with my present class... *not all of the ppl*... they detest the form teacher last yr, we finally changed... our present form teacher not bad... yet they give that kinda f***ing attitude... ai mai ai mai one... so freak man...  another thing i wanto know... why they all juz simply wun listen to the teacher during geog lesson??? they complained of mrs siva.. yah, we have our geog teacher changed... so wat now? they dun even bother to listen to mrs brenda tan... no point changing... it's a matter of attitude...  i dun wanto be sarcastic, but i have to be... i really wonder when my class will start to become hardworking? simply not near Os then work hard baz... that's too late lez... haiz... still prefer my sec 2 life... at least they all study, (i don't) but i'm push to work harder during that time...  aniwaes, u can make aloooot of friends in the near future... u may find it terrible without friends... but u will get used to it... i have only a few true friends to talk to... but... i am still fine with it... hehe...  end here, cya...

       Woah... it's been a long time eversince i've last updated my blog... anyway, let me update u wat have i encounter recently...     ermz... i go to sch juz as normal... then quite a no of things happen to me...     firstly, i almost fail my accounts test... my worst record... it's no&nbsp;doubt why mdm low wrote such a big chunk of sentences on my test paper "You really didn't study! How come? How have you been doing?"     well, i din study for the test in fact... but it's due to a fact that i lose interest in studying for now... FOR NOW i mean!!! not only i did badly for accounts... i did the same to Geog mot test.. it didn't motivate me at all!!!     that's not the worst... my chem is all along alright... now i dunno why i suddenly give up on Qualitative Analysis... omg... i really muz have go mad... partly may be due to that i have been to stressed last yr and the first semester of this yr.. so i am now relaxing...     mdm low say that i have to strive for the next 3 mths... she say i've studied for 10 yrs for the O level... i cant give up juz like that... haiz... i am really tired... :(     anyway, let's say smth nice... i bought my mp3 player... haha... got alot of songs to listen liao... hehe...     well, i wun give up so soon de lah... i've come so far for the O level... i wun back out juz like that... same for all of u... kkz...

      Haiz... Had a bad morning... I woke up with headache... haiz... felt so painful... my mum say i slept late last night that's why... but i know myself too well... it's due to stress!!!  after massaging my neck, i lie down on my bed... then i played with my nokia 3200... listening to the ringtones basically... then as i was browsing the folders... i came across this full polyphonic version of SHE - mo li ringtone... so i listen to it... my tears started to flow down suddenly...  i recalled that the last time i cried listening to 'mo li' is when mr ashraff scolded me last yr during st john... he threaten to sack me... hehe... long time ago... so dun really take it to heart le..  as my tears flows... my cadet cum jie jie msg me... she send me a joke... then i laugh a while... then sad again... haiz... i really dunno wat to do... so i msg hui kheng to tell her abt it... then she ask me to relax... but i really cant relax.. the more i think i more stress...  u all will be asking me why i so stress... basically, i am stress over alot of things... my studies... next sch life.. u noe something, when we doing the survey right, then got ask "i always look forward to come to sch" i wrote i strongly disagree... cuz i find that sch is a very very bad place to stay in...  u meet all sorts of ppl... bengz, lianz, attitudez... many kinds... and for ur info, i found out that 1 classmate have double personality... he appears to be very 'guai' in front of the teacher... but behind the back, he will sabo u if he dun like u..  juz becuz i accidentally say "I dun like indians" (i dun mean it!!!), he went to tell the farking attitude guy... then that farking guy wanto find me trouble... then the classmate realize he's gonna be in deep shit, together with the 404 ass... they came to call me names... they call me "gay boy"... fark!!! they think they not gay ahz... they come notice me for wat... this show they r gay oso lahz... BUT I AM NOT A GAY OK!!!  this thing was in my mind... i cant get it out... so i realise i muz do smth... go find teacher to help me resolve this thingy... i cant take it anymore... they are forcing me to the corner... i wanna have a peaceful life in QSS!!! i am suffering in torment for the past 4 yrs.. it's time i do smth!!!  haiz... really, i'm tired le... how i wish school's ending soon!!! then i wun need to face those farking faces anymore... really!!
