      On Tuesday, Andy took me to hang out with some of his Earlton friends at the swim club.  I met them before a month or so ago, in hopes of meeting some new women.  Well this was round 2, however, no magic.  The girls seem like nice people, however, there just wasn't any natural clicking, ya know?  The first time we went out with them, there was this girl Laura, who was my favorite of the bunch, but she didn't come this time.  She seemed the most personable.  And we really didn't do anything that special with them this time.  We got to the swim club, talked by the pool, played ping pong, played Mafia (which was really lame), and then we were gonna go to somoene's house or see a movie, but we didn't have a house to go to, and then the movie idea fell apart too, so it was just like "ok, bye then".  I had a lil fun though.    Today, I went over to the pediatric center to see if I could sign up to volunteer.  They gave me an application, so I gotta return that tomorrow.  I really need volunteer time.  Its the only thing keeping me from having a good college resume.  I got the grades, activities, sat scores (1330), awards...but the community service part is weak.     Tonight I saw the controversial Fahrenheit 9-11.  I thought it was very good.  Moore brought up a lot of great, scary points.  Tons of things made me go "Wow, I can't believe they got away with that."  So I am glad that Moore is bringing these things to a mainstream audience.  A lot of people complain that F911 is too onesided, it doesn't give the other point of view enough attention, etc.  Well here is my reply to that.  Do the government and Bush himself tell both sides of the story?  Of course not.  That's why we need Moore to let us know about this stuff.  So now we have both sides.  Bush can tell us his story, Moore can give us the other side.  It works nicely.  Also, there is tons of manipulation of editing in the film, and although thats technically a negative, if it means convincing more people not to vote for Bush, then its ok by me.

      Andy and Amit came over and we watched Pulp Fiction.  I've never seen it start to finish.  Damn good movie.  So funny.  So bizarre.  So many good quotes.  And andy and amit are hilarious people, so we had a many good joke.    I'm on a Beatles kick.  In the past week, I've gotten a hold of mp3's of the white album, please please me, abbey road, the original let it be, and sgt pepper to add to the 85 mp3's I already had.  There is soooo much beatles stuff out there its insane.  But I gotta take my time and learn the songs I have before I go get more.  13 fuckin albums plus 2 cd's full of songs that were never on albums.  I've just been desperate for something new to listen to, and I know that buy getting classic stuff, I know I won't be wasting my time.  The White album is weird stuff.  All these odd odd songs, some which would make good children songs.     urlLink Everyone go to alex's xanga and write him a goodbye .    And with alex willy-man mangone now, it's made me feel all reflective, so I would just like to be corny and say a word or two to my friends.  Thanks for an amazing year.  We have such a nice group of boys and girls and you guys have really made things great.  I've always had friends and stuff, but this year we've really got something special.    "I love ya man." "I know." "No, man, I love you."  - waynes world  "What would you think if I sang out of tune, would you stand up and walk out on me  Lend me your ears and I'll sing you a song, and I'll try not to sing out of key  Oh, I get by with a little help from my friends, mm, I get high with a little help from my friends  Mm, gonna try with a little help from my friends, what do I do when my love is away, does it worry you to be alone?  How do I feel by the end of the day, are you sad because you're on your own  No, I get by with a little help from my friends, mm, I get high with a little help from my friends  Mm, gonna try with a little help from my friends, do you need anybody, I need somebody to love  Could it be anybody, I want somebody to love  Would you believe in a love at first sight; yes, I'm certain that it happens all the time  What do you see when you turn out the light, I can't tell you but I know it's mine  Oh, I get by with a little help from my friends, mm, I get high with a little help from my friends  Mm, gonna try with a little help from my friends, do you need anybody, I just need someone to love  Could it be anybody, I want somebody to love, oh, I get by with a little help from my friends Mm, I get high with a little help from my friends, mm, gonna try with a little help from my friends  Yes I get by with a little help from my friends, with a little help from my friends "  - the beatles, "with a little help from my friends"  Funnyboy88: was andy in a speedo hahaha ShipmateSlore: i dunno ShipmateSlore: i guess ill find out ShipmateSlore: haha i surel hope so ShipmateSlore: lol ShipmateSlore: :-D Funnyboy88: hahahaha ShipmateSlore: hehe ShipmateSlore: ill have to bring my camera  no thanks.

      I'm back, everybody!  I was on some vacay with my family in Massachusetts from sunday to thursday.  It was quite fun and nice to kick off the summer.    sunday - we stopped at my grandpa's in new york on the way to massachusetts.  Had a nice dinner, some famous Ralph's water ice (a traditon for whenever we go).  Then it was back on the road.  We got at the  urlLink Red Lion Inn  at about 10:30pm.  We had a nice big room and I slept in a cot.    monday - Breakfast at the inn; then we went to  urlLink Jiminy Peak .  There, I did some really fun things.  First, I did this thing where you are strapped into these bungees and you jump on a trampoline.  It really started to hurt after like 45 seconds though because all your weight is on your crotch.  I hope I can still have children.  I also did this rock climbing thing.  It is soooo much harder than it looks.  I could barely do it.  I felt like such an ass as these little kids went up it right away yet I couldn't get past 7 ft above the ground.  I learned that my dreams of rock climbing are not going to happen.  The last activity there was alpine sliding.  Imagine a water slide with no water, and you sit in a sled. That's basically it.  Once and a while, people do go off the track and get injured.  Well, I was really pushing it with the speed and I started to lose control, so the only thing I could do was grab the cement track and ended up gettin g a pretty bad burn, but I luckily regained control.  So I have this huge nasty thing on my arm.  Marc made a great joke that it looks like I tried to slash my wrists using sand paper.  Or is it the hicki from jess...hehe.  After Jiminy Peak, we went to see the terminal, starring Tom Hanks.  It was pretty good, a lot better than I thought it was gonna be.  I recommend it.    tuesday - We drove an hour to this museum only find out it is closed on tuesdays.  shit.  It was quite a good laugh.  I have a good pic of that I'll have to post.  So we drove back and went to the  urlLink Norman Rockwell museum , and I'm not much of an art lover, but his illustrations were atleast entertaining.  That night, dad, ash, and I went to see "blue skies over alabama", a play.  It was very good.  Funny, yet it had some very dramatic, serious parts dealing with abortion and homosexuality in the 1930's.    wednesday - one word:  urlLink llamas .  Yes, we went hiking with llamas.  What an experience.  It felt so surreal walking along these star wars creatures.  Lots of great pics and video.  You go out to this guy's farm, you each get a llama, and you walk through the woods, receiving a nice tour.  One of the most unique things I've ever done in my life.    thursday - departure.  Outlet shopping on the way back.  I got a couple shirts and a pair of shorts at the Gap outlet.  Dayum cheap shiz.    As soon as I got home I headed over to Andy's for our "Good-bye Alex Willemin" party.  Alex and I have been friends since around 1st grade, and he's moving to somewhere in Pennsylanvia.  He's leaving on Saturday, so tonight was our last real chance for a celebration.  We watched wayne's world, a george carlin special, hung out in the backyard, had pizza, cake, etc.  He drove me home and we said farewell.  It's hard to believe I won't see him again, or I will, but it just won't be for a long time or often.  I've known him for so long, and even when we weren't close friends, he's always been in the picture somehow, ya know?  Plus this year we got real close cause he was in my media class in school, and formed a partnership that eventually became titled  urlLink Mush-Min Productions .  We made some real good movies together.  And we got even closer outside school, as we were both part of the same social group, with "movie nights" every weekend, etc. GOOD-BYE ALEX!  I WISH YOU THE BEST OF LUCK!

      Thursday was truly amazing, and it will be a night I will never forget.  Yesterday I worked from 4-10pm and it was absolutely horrrrrrible.  Everything that could possibly go wrong went wrong.  Every single order, there was either some confusion or mistake, or the customer was being a pain, etc.  I was so frustrated.  I'm a really easy going guy, but I have never been thaaaat pissed in a long long time.    Today, Sat, I worked the same shift and it was so much better.  Everything ran smoothly, I wasn't stressed.  I was a happy camper.  Still only 2 deliveries though so I only got like 5 bucks on tips along with the usual 5.50 an hour.    Tomorrow through Thursday, I am gonna be on a family trip to Massachusetts. Hopefully it will be fun.  We always end up having amazing food on our family trips.  Bloation from eating way too much.  I invented that word and my dad, a stomach doctor, says he's adopted it into his practice.  Maybe a boring museum or two.  Lots of head-phonage in the car.  Got my 20 gig Rio Karma all set to go.    So, don't miss me too much.  I shall be back.    Thursday was the last day of school, and we had our English final.  I got an 86, and a 94 on my final essay, which is truly amazing for me in ap eng.  I still got an 88 for the year, and an 88 in ap government, but I got all A's for the rest my classes.  Awesomeness.

      Everyone knows the Tom Petty song "free fallin." I wrote a parody called "free ballin".  If you wanna listen to the original Petty version, listen here   urlLink Tom Petty - Free Fallin'   Now, here is "free ballin"  "He’s a good boy, he loves his johnson No undies, under his pants He loves to jog with lots of swinging Feels a huge bounce as he does a dance  It’s a long day, at work in the office No other way, to stay comfortable through And I’m a bad boy cause I don’t even miss them I’m a bad boy for letting this habit start  Cause I’m free, free ballin No undies, free ballin  I got skid marks all over all my pants I spread my legs, here’s a jiggle for you All the good boys are standing in their boxers I let mine hang, do a jumpn jack or two  Cause I’m free, free ballin No undies, free ballin Free ballin', now I'm free ballin', now I'm  Free ballin', now I'm free ballin', now I'm   When you tell a girl you are free ballin It’s a pick up line sure to create romance I’m never ever gonna wear any  boxers Oh shit maybe I should, cause I just got pantsed.

      On on Friday and Saturday, I had my first 2 nights of work at Casella's, a pizzeria type place in Haddonfield.  It's on Kings highway where all those h-field shops are.    I basically do anything that needs to be done.  Cash register work, heating pizza, grilling meat, making salads, wiping tables, sweep floors, mopping floors, taking out the trash, washing dishes, etc.  It can be tough sometimes, but all the cleaning is disciplining.  My coworkers are alright.  My boss is this guy Angelo, who's really hard to understand.  Then there's Fernando, who makes all the food.  He seems like a nice guy I suppose.  There's this cute girl Jaqueline.  JJ is this weird guy who's been working there for 3 years, even when the place was a bagel shop.  He seems kinda  messed up.  Frankie, my sis's bf who works there and hooked me up with the job, trained me well, and we talked vastly about Brian Wilson and Pet Sounds.  So today was my last day that I would get to see the senior class.  Cause we have finals the next couple days, we won't be seeing them.  It's kind of weird to think I'll never see most of them ever again.    Tomorrow is my US History 2 Honors final and Algebra 2 Honors final.  Should be very interesting.    Yesterday, June 13th, was the bday of Rivers Cuomo and the Olsen Twins.  Thanks to alex for making this.

      On May 27th, 2004, Justin and Alex created the Teenage Victory Blog.  However, after a stunning 16 day run (that's over 2 weeks), the two have decided that the dual blog idea isn't just working out.  They are in talks of taking the other elements of the TVB, such as movie reviews, music reviews, recommendations, etc, and still having a site together.  However, the journals will be separate sites.    Usually blogger-made blog have a little profile in the corner, with my pic, and a list of all my interests, however, blogger is currently repairing that feature, so my profile should be up in a couple days.

      So in case anyone noticed, my blog has a title now.  Before it was just "Justin's Blog" cause I couldn't think of anything.  But I decided to hunt for a good title, and going through my vast mp3 collection, I found the Rooney song "Oh what a day."  and BAM, I had it.  Cause basically, all I do hear is talk about my day.  So there we go.    You can download the song on the right side bar thingy.    Last night Mike and I watched Starsky and Hutch.  Originally we were gonna get Men in Tights, but Mike was like,  "Hey, just wanna see starsky and hutch?"  "er ok sure why not."      HORRIBLE.  I thought it was gonna be atleast kinda funny, but it was severely disappointing.  It did have some really funny bits, but the jokes were soooo far apart it was insane.  For like the first half hour of the movie nothing funny happened.  Usually comedies have a big intro with a huge laugh that pulls you in, but the movie just kinda...started without anything special.  So avoid this movie.  It has a couple good laughs, but only a couple, and lots of dead space.  It's like watching River's 5...ZING.    During the movie, Mike and I would make comments that made us laugh a lot harder than the movie itself.   For example, I started to say something about the oovie: "Wait, did Husky..."  *pause*  *enormous eruption of laughter that the movie never gave us*    And I know maybe you don't care, but Rivers Cuomo, the lead singer of weezer,  is going back to Harvard and he posted an  urlLink essay  he wrote for a class on his myspace.    JAW DROPPING.  Rivers talks about everything that he has been doing the last couple years and it is simply a gigantic wower.  fasting.  volunteering 6 days a week.  living in an empty apartment outside rick rubin's house.  studying and studying his craft.  If you are a minor or major fan of weezer, you should read that essay.

              Ok, so now that you are wondering "what the mother fuck?"    Dear friend Andy Keith has mono. And all he does is lay like a blob in bed, by himself. So, Mike and I decided to pull off a covert operation. Using white trash bags, we cut up these wicked costumes to make ourselves look like we are from the Centers for Disease Control. The day before we went shopping for gas masks.     The Berlin Mart had real gas masks for 43 dollars. Nope. Raul's army and navy shop also had expensive real ones. Party City didn't have any toy gas masks. So we were really depressed. But, as I pulled up to my house, I see Louis Kang's dad mowing his lawn, wearing a perfect mask! I asked him if he had any extra, and he gave me some. One of the most amazing coincidences ever. He could've picked another day to mow his lawn, or even another time.     So in full gear, we headed over to the Keith house, went right in, ran up the stairs yelling "MOVE MOVE MOVE", and burst into Andy's room.  Andy looked really out of it and confused until he realized it was me and brower.  He was still pretty dead though.  So after running around the room with the vacuum, pretending to pick evidence and look at the "readings" on the vacuum, and zapping down andy and his family, we sat by his bed and talked to him.   It felt nice to visit him and make his day brighter some how.  After, I kinda joked with Mike, "I wonder if he even realized who he was talking to."  His voice sounded pretty funny too.  We wanted to record it but oh well.    The day before I went to lunch with shannon and brower at the Palace Diner.  I enjoyed the meal, but it was so pathetic.  It took the three of us a good 20 minutes to figure out who owed what for the bill.  We kept moving money back and forth, exchanging, passing, switching, making a tip pile, taking from that pile, AH IT WAS HORRIBLE.  And we are smart ap/honors class students too.  The table next to us found it entertaining.  It was kinda weird when espn, which was playing in the diner, started showing 9-11 footage.  It was all "hey we are friends laughing together" and then the tv starts showing the creepy 9-11 footage of the planes going into the WTC and people running and crying....it just felt odd and inappropriate heh.    so yeah.

      In case you don't know who alex of pittsburgh (acewepeel) is, he's been a friend of mine for 2 years.   But here's the catch.  I haven't actually met him.  He was just some random dude I started talking to online cause his sn had to do with weezer, and he was on an snl board, my 2 favorite things.  We discovered we were the same age, and had a lot of similar interests and opinions.  Tv shows, music, movies.  We like all the same things.  We would both say what the other was just thinking or saying at the same exact time.  I think the creepiest was when we were both listening to some obscure random song at the same time, when we were asking what we were each listening to.  We talk everyday at length, and have been doing so for EXACTLY 2 YEARS NOW!  And I'm not just talking about "hey, whats up notthing yeah", we talk about everything.  I know so much about this kid, and I haven't even seen him face to face.  He's like a best friend or a twin brother.  I've had other online "friends", but none like him.  With the others, there are fallouts, or just not as close.    Then there's his friend, Kiersten (kiersten1232) whom he goes to school with.  My IM's have been quoted in alex's profile many times, and one time Kiersten noticed me there and IMed me to see who I was.  I still remember when we first talked, I said I was Jesus.  We hit it off immediately.  We would talk for HOURS on end, and our conversations would be so addictice, it would literally take us 25 minutes after we would first say "bye" to actually sign off.  Kiersten is an amazing girl.  We don't even have that much in common, but we get along so well and tell each other everything.  She calls me her diary haha and will tell me stuff she wont even tell her real friends.  I know it sounds really pathetic and crap, but if I knew her in person I would ask her out in a second.   Well on the weekend of August 7th...DUN DUN DUN....WE ARE ACTUALLY GONNA MEET.  My mom's bf has family in Upper Saint Clair, where alex and kiersten live.  WHAT A FREAKIN COINCIDENCE.  So him, me, and mom are taking a trip there, and I guess while he visits family, I'll be with alex and kiersten.  I'm still in denial that its actually gonna happen.  It's going to be sooooo weird.  I'm gonna "meet" these people that I already know inside and out.  I met an internet friend before, well thats cause she lived around the block from my dads house, but we met online, and when I first met her, I was in denial.  It was the weirdest sensation.  So I can't even imagine what its gonna be like for alex and kiersten.  My body may spontaneously combust.  I may die right there.  And I can be shy around new people...am I gonna be shy with these guys?  I don't know.  Originally alex and I planned it that Kiersten wouldn't know I was coming, that scheduling conflicts were preventing me from coming.  We wanted it so she would have NO idea.  I would just walk up to her house, ring the doorbell.  She would answer it, and I would be there, with alex videotaping hahaha.  However, we had to make sure she was still available, and even more than 2 weeks in advance, she actually had drivers ed for that day.  Alex and I panicked at first, but then settled on having alex tell her "you may wanna free up that day, cause there is a big BIG surprise.  Kiersten kept bugging and bugging him about what it is, and the next day he couldn't hold back anymore cause she was going insane bothering him about it, so he broke her the news.  Here was her reaction after alex told her I was gonna be there.   (he sent me the convo)  [I can't change the font size on this blog for some odd reason on this computer, but kiersten increased her font on aim to the biggest possible] kiersten1232: SHUT kiersten1232: UP kiersten1232: SHUT UP SHUT UP SHUT UP acewepeel: yessssss kiersten1232: NOO WAY kiersten1232: HOLY kiersten1232: CRAP kiersten1232: OH  kiersten1232: MY kiersten1232: GOD kiersten1232: OH MY GOD OH MY GOD kiersten1232: IM GOING TO CRY kiersten1232: IM ABOUT TO SHED TEARS  acewepeel (11:35:21 PM): then she called me and freaked out some more haha  Funnyboy88 (11:34:57 PM): lol so i hear you heard the news kiersten1232 (11:35:03 PM): AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH kiersten1232 (11:35:20 PM): AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH  The three of us are gonna go to Kennywood on August 7th.  Kennywood is a big amusement park, a six flags type of place.  I can't wait.  To quote Mike Myers, "I'm as happy as a little guuurrlll"

      Tuesday night at 11:30, I get a call. It's Marc. He gives me an assignment. The Mission: To meet him and mike down the shore the next day. Soon after the call, I went online, only to learn that Jess somehow got convinced into driving her sister to OC the next day too, and she will meet up with us. Suddenly, Mari joins in, and getting a ride from me, the group was assembled!    You know when they make movie sequels with missing cast members (kinda like my urlLink  matrix rehashed ) ? It was kinda like that. No norm, bryan, shannon, or andy. They wanted more money to appear in the sequel, heh. However, we lacked the "new guy" that shows up in the sequels, but thats cool.    I had a blast. We hit the beach immediately and it was soooo nice. It was a little on the too hot side, but the water was sooooooo nice. I could've died happy then in the water. It was super super warm. It didn't even take a second to get used to the temperature. No jelly fish, no seawood, lots of piss, ah so beautiful. Jess actually fell for the "deep spot" trick in the water. You know, when you get on your knees in the shallow and go "omg, theres a deep spot here!" Yeah.     We grabbed some food on the boardwalk, went back to marcs, changed into our civilian clothes. Then we watched Dr. Phil. What a funny show. Well, its not supposed to be funny, but it was cracking me and Mike up, as everyone else watched in seriousness as issues were conquered and uncovered! Then we got sucked into part of the evening news, and after a sad story about this little girl that was shot in the city, it was like "WEEEE, LETS GO ON THE BOARDWALK!!"     We had planned to go on some rides, but by the time we got there, my mom called me, informing me of when I needed to get home, so we didn't really have time to go on the rides, so after ice cream, it was back to marc's house, which is a long walk. And mari and I were off back to home. Mike, jess, and marc stayed, planning to leave 10ish.     And now I'm here...    work tomorrow.      back to the grind.    I'll try to get some pics of the event from Mari.      Oh yes, how could I forget.  There was one phrase we said 5 million times.  "NOW!" - arnold, in terminator 2.    I recorded a demonstration of it.   urlLink here .

      Thursday - I watched Wrongfully Accused, a Leslie Nielsen movie from 1998. I remembered it being hilarious. But I was really tired when I watched it, so it didn't seem as good. Maybe its not as good. Probably a combination of both.     Friday night - worked.  blah blah blah    Saturday - to the shore we went! The ride took about 2 hours. I drove since my sis lacked her license. After you spend a while going 60 mph and above, and then you have to go back down to 10-25 mph cause of traffic, the car acts weird. Sometimes when it shifts gears, theres this loud boom found and feeling from the bottom of the car. It's like the car wants to go 60 and not 15. But it provided some entertainment during the traffic. we saw a father and son peeing on the side of the road. we rolled down the windows and yelled, "YOU'RE PEEING", just in case they didn't know.     After a day on the beach and dominos for dinner, I met up with Marc on the boardwalk. It was mighty fun. We played skeeball and tore the place apart. If you got a score of 260, you got a free game. Marc really sucked, but after I taught him my technique, he kicked ass too, and we racked up a bunch of free games between the 2 of us. What a thing to brag about, eh? We also played some air hockey (a dollar per game, WTF). I think we played two games, and we each won one. Next, we went to the Air Circus toy store and played with about every toy in the store. There was this creepy girl who kept trying to play with us. She would pick up one of those jacob's ladder toys and play with it as if it took skill.     Then at the counter they had these amazing prank things that shock you. They had a shock pen, measuring tape, and cigarrette box. Marc tried out the measuring tape one and he dropped it and screamed from the shock. Quite funny. The pen and the cigarrette weren't as strong though, but still great. The pens were 8.99 or two for 12, we did the 2 for 12 deal and each got one. So if you wanna borrow a pen from me or marc this coming school year, WATCH OUT. I already got a couple people with it at work. We had soo much fun with the pens on the boardwalk. Haha. Probably too much fun. The shock is strong enough to travel through metal, so we came up with the genius idea of shocking the metal railing of the boardwalk and seeing everyone leaning on it get shocked. We were sooo scared to try it out. We fantasized over the idea of the entire board walk railing shocking everyone, with people sitting on it falling off backwards and such. So we finally tried it, only to learn that the shock isn't strong enough to travel that far. :(     Then sunday it was work. blah blah. This girl I was kinda eying (kinda, as in I was still trying to get to know her), I learned she smokes. It may not seem like a big deal, but I dunno, smoking says a lot about a person. It's a pretty dumb and dirty habit. I got off work at 4. It was amazing not having to be there for closing, which entails tons of cleaning. I spent the rest of the night watching I love the 90's. GREAT show. Michael Ian Black is god. Hal Sparks rules too. A lot of daily show people are on that show. Mo Rocca, those 2 blonde hair women who comment a lot, and this other dude who used to be on it back when Craig Kilbourne hosted.     Marc and Mari introduced me to Isketch.  You basically play pictionary online.  Its sooooo fun and sooo frustrating when you can't get it.  Play it sometime.     Question of the day. and please comment your answer.  WOULD YOU EAT MY SHIT FOR A BILLION DOLLARS?  Marc: Yes.  But you must add sweet and low first.    Jess: You'd be insane not to.

      On July 14th, 2004, Amit, Mike Brower, and I gathered at my house for chillage.  Little did we know we could experience such ecstasy.  We all agreed it was seriously one of the funniest nights of our lives.  I seriously never came closer to pissing all over myself.    We ordered cheesesteaks from my local pizza place.  There had to be something in those.  We were literally high on life.    After dinner, we did something that I cannot reveal...yet.  But it is a comedy classic.   When we have confirmation, we can share it with the world.    Then we fooled around on the computer some more, and we discovered all these web sites dedicated to showing what happens when you play certain records backwards.  Such as http://www2.memlane.com/jmilner/stairwaybackwards.htm  or http://www.reversespeech.com/music_reversals.htm  After listening to a bunch of these, strange ideas came to brew.  We decided to reveal to the world the satanic messages hidden inside the song "Happy Birthday" when you hear it backwards.  So, here is the production we made.    urlLink Happy Birthday - REVEALED!    Enjoy.

      For the summers of 2001, 2002, and 2003, I attended Camp Walnut at the Walnut Street Theater in Philly.  At the end of every summer, we'd put on a play.  My first year, I was in the development group, and the other 2 years, I was in the Theater Performance division, which puts on a show that does not involve singing.  Camp Walnut helped me grow so much as an actor.  Before Walnut, I had potential I never knew about.  It opened doors for me.  In the fall of 2001, I was casted in the lead cast of the school's fall play.  Coincidence?  I think not.    I've also built good friendships there.  I still talk to a few of the campers I met back in 2001.  Well this year, sadly, I opted for having money (aka working at casellas) over attending camp walnut.  It was a tough decision, but I need money and work experience.  I decided it would be fun to drop in one day and say hello and such.  Today was that day.  It was soooo nice.  I got there at 1:00, knowing the campers were at lunch, so I decided to walk towards Wawa, the main place of foodage for the walnutters.  Across the street was Austin, my fellow improv champion, whom I shouted for his attention.  He had the biggest "wtf" look ever haha.  From there, I met up with all the other campers, reunited at last.  It was so awesome seeing them all again.  Sam, austin, kristen, anne, jon, tom, gretchen, sara, macrena, jamie, will, frank, and everyone else.  It was like I hadn't missed a thing.  After they ate lunch, I went with the group where they were set to do warm ups and rehearse.  We did freeze improv, and it was sooo funny.  Good times had by all.  Many a good chuckle.  I even got to revive my role as Prince Tartaglia (the character I played last summer) for a brief nostalgic moment in one scene.  From there I watched them rehearse the show they are doing, "Taming of the Shrew".  I did that show in the fall of 2002.  I was Lucentio, and coincidentally, Austin is Lucentio for their version.  It was so weird watching them do that show, because all the lines were coming back to me, and I was comparing all the blocking compared to how we did it.    You know on SNL when the former cast members come back for a special cameo or host?  It felt exactly like that.  Like I was the "special guest" haha.  It'd be really funny if I could do a quick walk on role during the show.    In other news, Marc and I have discovered the magic of ytmnd.com  You must check these out. http://picard.ytmnd.com/ http://whatsnewkhan.ytmnd.com/ http://cosbymon.ytmnd.com/ http://karmachamelekahn.ytmnd.com/  Theres a million of those that use the KAAAAHN clip.  classic.

I LOVED it.  Best comedy I've seen in a while.    In related news...I have money.  By having a job, I have recieved it.  So, feeling generous, I treated friends to ice cream.  The half-jew inside of me was against it though.    Work wasn't so bad today.  Sure, ther was some usual suckage, but I got so tired, I think I was a little delirious, so I was much more interactive with customers and co-workers.  And theres this new girl megean who was my partner at the counter.  I put the pizza in the oven.  She rang up at the cash register.  She seems like a nice girl, and its always awesome to have another normal person who speaks english clearly and doesn't act like an asshole.

      Woof.  What a long freakin day.  Worked from 2-10.  Sucked major balls.  I made barely any money too cause the owner decided there would be no deliveries today since it was so busy.  So I ran around the place doing everything that needed attention.  I hate that place so much.    Tomorrow they want in me in at 10am, which is odd, cause I usually do the 2nd half of the day, not the opening.  So they better not be expecting me to stay until close.    I really have nothing else to talk about.  I miss being able to hang with friends.  I feel like I haven't done anyting social in so long, even though its only been a week. Still, in the summer, thats a long time. Hopefully tomorrow I can see anchorman, unless they want me working the whole day.

      I got up early today.  11am.  What the hell?  And I just woke up naturally too.  I usually need an alarm for 11am.    Tonight I went with ash mush to the free Phantom Planet concert in philly.    It was a pretty ghetto set up.  It was outside, with the kind of stadium seating where the stage is lower than the audience.  And then there was a concrete break for walking, and then more seating.  So if you weren't in the first seating section, the next best spot was at the top of the 2nd section, and by there, you are so far away from the concert, I felt like I was watching a concert rather than attendning one.  But hey, I got my money's worth.  The setlist was good, and PP put on a great, energetic show.  Alex, the lead singer, used to prance around and make chaos, but since their 2nd guitarist quit, he's had to take on guitar duties, so its really changed their stage show, but everything sounded fine.  It was kinda sad when there was a massive exodus of people during their set.  I guess more people were there for Sugarcult, which is a crime.    I got hungry and bought this pretzel.  It was so nice and warm, like a BUTT.  We parked soooo far away it was reDUNKulous.  We parked at the lot that the venue recommended, but we didn't realize the lot was soooo far from the place.  We walked and walked and walked, and then when we got there, they weren't letting people in, so there was this maaaaassive line to get in.  I called it the Trail of Tears.    Family friend Julia selznick also attended, but we couldn't find her.  I kept my eyes peeled though.  And I finally saw y100 morning dj's preston and steve in person.  Steve Morrison is a hilarious hilarious guy, and I've been listening to him for 7 years.  I've also discovered up close why they are on the radio.

      Here are some belated pics from my vacation in the Berkshires in Massachusetts.  Sorry that these pics are mondo big.  First, my dog annie wasn't allowed to come, so here she is, all happy, thinking she is going on vacation, only to be dropped off at a relatives house.      Here's my dad in his "doofy" hat.  He's doing his dad thing.    From the hotel, we drove an hour to his art gallery, only to learn that it was randomly closed on Tuesdays, the day we just happened to decide to go on.      We went hiking with llamas, as previously mentioned in an older post.  Heres a nice group shot.  But my llama was misbehaving, so I am not looking at the camera.  I was too busy trying to get mine to face forward.    Here's a great pic of Ashley with her llama.      Here's me being an ass by the lake.    Last night mike brower came over and we watched my fave movie of all time, the naked gun.  Just as good as always.  We also went to dianes water ice and bought a quart.  Cheaper in bulk.    Then tonight we went to my lil sister's swim meet.  Go ari!!!  We were the only people cheering and making a scene, but we didn't care.  After, the cousins (ad, jules, and liv), their dad (uncle chuck), and the fam went to this really nice restaurant restaurant...and we got hoagies.  Almost as good as subway ;)  The phrase of the summer for my cousins and I is "like a butt."  Anytime we need to use a simile, we throw that in there and it always works.  "Ah, these cookies are good...like a butt."  "Can I have a soft roll for my sandwich, like a butt."  "It was pretty tough, like a butt."  But its not just butt.  You really gotta say BUTT.  Don't ask.

      new song to try out!  franz ferdinand's take me out!  delish!  Funnyboy88: i didn't get raped on my walk home! knivess out: haha dude you're lucky!! knivess out: my walk back home was not so fortunate knivess out: but i kinda... enjoyed it  So after another shitty night of work on Friday, and I went down the shore with la familia on Saturday for a fun-filled weekend filled with fun!  Lots of beachage.  Chillage with the cousins.  Hot dogage.  Sun-burnage.    On the 4th, we had our annual US jello dessert, its a jello mold of the all the states.  However, in its making, it got messed up, with half of the country mushed up and destroyed. "This is what will happen if Bush is reelected" - me.  my sister: "Global warming!"    Then that night on the boardwalk, with the fireworks, I met up with Shannon.  We walked around the boardwalk and went on the amazing sea dragon ride (my 2nd time that night, first with the cousins).  I love that ride.  Then after more walking, we FINALLY got in contact with Marc and found him.  More walkage.  It was so sad.  Marc and I, standing next to each other, tried calling each other's phones, but it wouldn't work.  We both had full service, used the area code, and everything.  So ghetto.    Then I walked home by myself (hence the rape joke above), hit the sack.  Then hitting my balls got boring and I went to bed.  Ba dum psh.  *sitcom audience laughs*  Today, I went home with my dad so I could get to work for 4pm, while everyone else stayed at the shore.  I got all dressed for work, got there, and the place was closed.  THANK YOU TO MY WONDERFUL MANAGER ANGELO FOR GIVING ME A PHONE CALL  "NOT!" - waynes world  What a jackass.  I hate that place so much.    xellessdee 420x: im so sad Funnyboy88: why xellessdee 420x: im finally accepting Siskel's death Funnyboy88: siskel? xellessdee 420x: from Siskel and Ebert Funnyboy88: that was like 4 years ago xellessdee 420x: dude xellessdee 420x: how do u get to two of the most reputable critics? xellessdee 420x: caz i mean..... xellessdee 420x: "Drop Dead Funny" -Mushnick and Brower Funnyboy88: haha Funnyboy88: siskel and ebert just sounds really good too.  say it.  "siskel and ebert" xellessdee 420x: i know xellessdee 420x: i wonder  xellessdee 420x: if it was always that way Funnyboy88: "ebert and roeper?"  wtf xellessdee 420x: or just xaz we were brought up on it Funnyboy88: haha i was wondering that too Funnyboy88: well ebert and roeper sounds retarded Funnyboy88: and who is this roeper guy?  can I really trust his thumb? xellessdee 420x: or both of them? xellessdee 420x: "TWO THUMBS WAY UP" -Ebert and Roeper on Jaws VI  Funnyboy88: hahaha xellessdee 420x: how the F do u put ur thumbs way up Funnyboy88: i always thought "2 penises up" would be a good way to critique pornos. xellessdee 420x: lol xellessdee 420x: thats prolly used somewhere Funnyboy88: probably xellessdee 420x: or like "5 Tissues" xellessdee 420x: like 5 stars Funnyboy88: LOL

      So, it finally happened. I just got back from Pittsburgph, PA, where I met my internet pals Alex and Kiersten, although they are now more than that (*sitcom audience awwws*).  They were sooo annoying. I'm kinda glad they are 6 hours away. Ah Kiersten was so weird and alex was a total nerd. What a disappointment. I kept telling them "oh I wanna come back", but I just wanted to sound nice.                          [/end of joke]  In all seriousness, it was AMAZING. I had sooo much fun. LIKE A BUTT. Now a summary of the trip.  I got up at 9ish on Friday morning, and by 11am, I was sitting on my bed ready to go, however, my mom's boyfriend Tom had to make some conference calls, and we didn't end up leaving until...gasp...1:30pm. It kinda ruined the plans we had for that night, but hey, it was nice enough for Tom to make this trip and he needed to do some business, so I have nothing to complain about. The ride was alright at first. I brought my 20 gig Rio Karma mp3 player with 1900 songs at my disposal for entertainment. So I was entertained pretty well. However, we ran into some trouble when we got to Pittsburgh...we got lost. The MapQuest directions were misleading and semi-wrong, so an extra 90 minutes was added to the trip trying to figure out where we needed to go.  FINALLY we got to the Comfort Inn Hotel at 9:30pm. When I stepped out of the car there, my cell phone vibrates. It was Alex.  A: Guess where I am? J: Uhh I have no idea A: The Comfort Inn  *!!!* = my brain. I got so excited and started looking all around. So we stayed on the phone trying to locate each other. "Get out of your car, "I told him, I still didn't see him. I even got to the point where I was yelling "HELLO" in the parking lot...then we discovered...he was at a different Comfort Inn. HAHA! Boy, that was funny.  So finally Alex got to the right Comfort Inn. I saw a car approaching with a teenager (or peenager). Alex waved. I walked up his window. We shook hands. First contact was established. I then called down mom and tom and introduced alex to them.  I must say, it wasn't as weird as I thought it was gonna be. It's probably cause of the times on the phone or when we would glophone, so I knew what it was like to talk to him. The first couple minutes in the car felt a bit odd, like "holy shit, i'm in the car with acewepeel", but I got used to it kinda fast.  We proceeded to Kiersten's house. It was kinda funny, cause when we pulled into her drive way, there were all these other kids walking down the street, so we joked that they were here to see my arrival. I saw Kiersten coming down the steps and I experienced more *!!!* feelings. So we had another whoaahh this is it kinda moment and we went inside her house to meet her parents. Her parents were pretty nice and welcoming. I tried to be a responsible and friendly kid and apparently I suceeded. I felt like I was on 20/20 being interviewed. We talked about everything from them seeing my movies to the chairs they got 20 years ago. They seemed like normal people, so its kinda hard to imagine all the horror stories about their strict rules are true.  In Peensylvania, their jr. driving license has a curfew of 11pm, which is hella dumb. Ours is 12am. So we didn't have time to go out to eat or anything. Alex drove me back to the hotel, and he picked me up the next morning at 10ish to go to  urlLink Kennywood , the amusement park alex works at. We had some good bonding time together, getting used to each other and such. We arrived there 11am and by the time Kiersten got there after 3pm, I felt pretty normal. None of the roller coasters went upside down, which was kinda disappointing, but the rides were still very fun anyway. We went on the Phantom 4 times, but the 2nd time was absolutely amazing, cause we had the front row and the wind was incredible.  We went on the log jammer twice...here is a pic of that.     I was trying to look at the camera, but oh well.  Then...we DID THE SKYCOASTER. It's basically a bungee swing. Here is a corny pic I found on the internet.      We were all sooo nervous, especially Kiersten, who had this gut feeling that we were gonna die. WHAT AN EXPERIENCE. The initial 2 seconds of the drop are pants-shitting scary. You get to discover what you sound like when you think you are about to die. Then as soon as the wire catches, it is tons of fun and not really stomach dropping.  The 2nd time we ate was really bizarre. We were literally high on life, acting extremely goofy. We played spit-your-ice-into-your-cup, and at the moment, it was the funniest thing in the world. Kiersten even told us a story about how she peed her pants last October. LOL! I doubt she would have told us that story if she was in any other regular mind set. Later that night, we actually almost got her to pee her pants from laughing, to the point where she let go a little and had to crouch down hahahahaha. Aw man, CLASSIC. Sorry Kiersten :)  Now for the really cheesy part. All good things must come to an end. After we did the sky coaster at 10pm, it was time to go. The walk back to the car was depressing. On the ride back, Alex and I sang along to obscure Weezer songs, revealing our awful falsetto skills. It was so much fun doing that with another Weezer nerd haha. Poor Kiersten hehe. We arrived back at the Comfort Inn. It was a tough good bye.  That day I truly learned why Alex and I have been able to keep contact for 2 years and with Kiersten for 1 full year too. They are just like my friends here in Voorhees, and they would fit in perfectly with my group. The transition from internet friend to real life friends was completely easy. I can't say that about the other internet friend I met. They are cool, hilarious people whom I had BLAST with. I only hope they felt the same way, and judging from all the fun we had and the painful goodbye, I know they liked me in someway, hehe. Alex hasn't blocked me on aim yet, so that's a good sign. But its painful to thing that these people that I am so compatible with are 6 hours away, no easy trip. With no one else can I make both an extremely obscure SNL reference and then an obscure Weezer reference within 60 seconds. Ok, now the corny part is done.  I shall post pictures soon. They are currently at rite-aid being developed.
