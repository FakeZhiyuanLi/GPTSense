       Of the few attempts I've seen, nothing seems to hit on Devin like anime does, the standard truer-to-life artists seem to be missing a part of his personality, and I think that comes from manga art. So here is the best Devin attempt I've ever seen, drawn by a close friend of mine. Enjoy!  Yes, this is Devin, drawn bishonen (pretty boy) style, the kind of art you see in Sailor Moon and Vampire Hunter D. The idea of this art form is to make angelic-faced boys who are stick-thin and almost feminine in appearance. The style works for Devin because he has a young face and he's tall and slender, as well as having several emotional traits that would appeal to the ladies and convince the men he's probably not gay, like that fact that he has boundless confidence and a ridiculous trouble-making sense of humor but also carries an aura of mystery and secret burdens he alone has to carry. He has a darker, violent side to him that only shows itself when he feels innocent people are threatened, and can be ruthlessly efficient in dealing with threats when he is pushed to anger. Though he is friendly and outgoing, he never stays in one place for very long, and avoids close contact with anyone, for reasons only he knows...

       You know ever couple of years a craze hits the portly folk of North America. After years of binge eating on the excesses of food we don't need but will kill to get we hit a point where our children look like tightly wrapped sausage links and redneck wives look like Jabba the Hut in a mumu.   Then, the diet craze begins.  Personally I feel this is commercialism gone insane. Our days are packed full of advertisements from every fastfood resteraunt and their sister on earth, telling us to enjoy the great, "wholesome" taste of a whopper or a big mac or fifty other variations of greasy beef in a greasy bun. But hey, nobody makes it like Burger King, right? Or Wendy's, or McDonald's, or Dairy Queen, or White Castle, or Sonic, or Harvey's, etc. etc. Twelve chains of Tacobell serve greasy food using a different medium in stead of buns, most chains also serve chicken instead of beef. It's not healthier, its still the same grease-fried crap, only now its been breaded too to ensure you get your daily quota of artery filler.   For fuck's sakes, people, when will it fucking end? These fastfood chains make NRA members look like casual observes of their constitutional rights. A right to choose should mean something more than just paying an extra 49 cents to up-size your goddamn generic fatty-meal.   But as I said. After ten, maybe twenty years of wolfing down dozens of varieties of the flavor "salt", we start panicking because all of the sudden we're all fucking fat and we can't understand how it happened. Maybe it has something to do with the comforts of recognizable food, I know I've been driving down the highway and was glad to see a Wendy's lurking on the side of the road, how many of us can claim to have had the courage to turn down the Big 50 burger makers for the chance to try some of "Captain Jeb's House of Room Temperature Pork Products?" Maybe its the commercialism of it all - red after all is a color psychologically wired into our hunger centers in the brain, probably because it reminds our primordeal selves of the blood we once shed to actually go out and catch our food.  And you got pissed off when they stopped taking credit cards at the drive-thru.  The natural conditions of the human psyche during times of stress and anxiety are very basic. People will hit things, fuck, or eat. We were doing these things long before we evolved to the point where we can go on TV and listen to Dr. Phil tell us the eight ways our life is fucked up, and its completely understandable to regress into these states when you don't want to deal with emotionally-stressful situations that can't be solved through more civilized means. And since sex is limited to bedrooms and it's illegal to punch an asshole in the nose, what is there left to do? Fly into Ronald McDonald's ever-loving embrace and suck on his greasy, salty cock.  Now I want to say first and foremost that I grew up fat. I'm still fat today, that's F-A-T, not O-B-E-S-E. Don't fuck yourself into thinking scientific names will ease your condition. Post traumatic stress disorder is shellshock and handicapable is crippled. Once you've stopped filling yourself up with the liberal bullshit you can start addressing the problem the way it should be - as a fucking PROBLEM.  I grew up fat. My folks say its because they gave in to my every childish wish, and maybe that's a part of it. But what's more, I developed the state of mind that matches fastfood with happiness. I percieved fastfood as a wonderful delicious reward for absolutely butt-fucking nothing. And since it was always around, I could always get some, I could always reward myself with more, for no reason at all. And that's the perfect state of mind fastfood chains want in their customers. If you eat our food, you'll be happy. Smoke our cigarrettes, you'll be cool. Wear our clothes, you'll be accepted. Listen to celebrities, their important to the existance of your life on earth.  One more chain in the shackle. More and more I am seeing evidence that fastfood, like cigarettes and the wholesome American quickfix, is an addictive substance.   So as I mentioned above before going on this tyrade, every once and while, people realize what a hellhole they've eaten their way into and cry out for help from those of us smart enough not to fall into the trap. Weight Watchers, Jenny Craig, Slimfast, the whole arsenal in our epic battle against the McMachines. And these days, the "One" seems to be Atkins.   I've been using (not  trying ) the Atkins diet for about three weeks now, and I don't really know if I'm losing weight or not, because frankly I haven't bought a weight scale lately. But I  do  feel better these days. Energetic, even. Giving up breads and pasta and potatoes and all the carobhydrate foods doesn't seem so bad for me, because my mother didn't cook a lot of meat, something that I personally crave more than most people crave chocolate. Instead of a decent steak and salad, we got potatoes by the handful and ate nothing but cereal and toast for breakfast and had pasta six days of the week.  Now, working on the Atkins, I'm practically expected to feed on something's flesh, I'm free to actually, you know, stand on the top of the fucking food chain, without being labeled a circus freak or something. Sure a lot of animal rights people will be pissed, but I'm not worried. We'll be eating them once they cows are gone anyways. But I get to have meat and salads, and I'm damn fine happy with that.  I find it pleasing to know more folks are leaping to the Atkins craze, but I am a little worried. It seems as the fastfood chains organizations, or NAMBLA, watch us turn our backs on their new Superdelux Ultraburger that uses only whole-fat particles, they are beginning to turn the Atkins revolution into another come-and-go fad. They've almsot deliberately started "limited time offers" starring Atkin's approved foods, designed to draw folks in for the food they serve while "sweetening" it with "healthy" alternatives. We'll get happy again with our fastfood, and then they'll yank the Atkins stuff out from under us, ripping it off their menus and leaving us with their usual cookie-cutter burgers and sandwhiches. We'll shrug, and go back to the gluttony, since we can't seem to give up the food we've grown accustomed to eating out of our favorite franchises. Everyone will assume the Atkins craze is dead and that'll be that. Another attempt to grant North America a more beach-worthy physique crushed and killed faster than Senator Liberman's "Joementum".  So to anyone who reads this, I whole-heartedly implore you - Don't be drawn back to the fastfood chains, the quickies. They flash those Atkins signs like bioluminescence on an angler fish, but they don't give a damn about your continued health and emotional well-being anymore than Jeff Dahlmer does. All they want is for you to come in for just one more McDeal, one more Value Meal, one more pre-processed freezer-dried paper-wrapped slab of deep-fried salted dog shit with a Diet Coke.   Turn your back on 'em. They might have been your brother and you might have loved them, but they fucked with you and they don't deserve to be a part of your family anymore. Give 'em the kiss of death like Michael did to his traitor sibling in  The Godfather  and tell 'em you don't ever want to see their face again.  Do if for me, do it for your family and friends and loved ones. Hell, be a selfish prick and do it for yourself. Just do it.  Think about it.

       Since I have a blog, I want to use it to describe a few ideas I have sometimes. Y'see, sometimes I get inspiration for something that sounds great in my head, but doesn't relate to the writing areas I want to focus on. Video games and tabletop RPG's are some of them, I have lots of ideas for great games.   So here's one of my ideas that's been swimming in my noggin for a few days, something I think would be kind of fun either as a video game or a tabletop RPG.    Codename: Zero  (working title)  Description: Action-packed super-spy action set in the early 21st Century. High tech gadgets, stylish skills, megalomaniac super-villains and more faceless goons than you can shake a martini at.  Players choose from a variety of spy "classes", including -   - Assassin: As their name suggests, assassins are killers. Most are former military snipers or underworld hitmen who have taken their love of the "clean" murder to new heights. Assassins are known to set elaborate traps and can wait for days for a target. They keep to the shadows, avoiding direct combat, which they are usually poorly equipped to deal with. Because of their knowledge of booby-traps and lethal gadgets, assassins are also skilled at disarming such items. Example: The shooter in  Phone Booth  Key Skills: Sniper, Evasion, Traps  - Gentleman/Lady: Unlike other spies, Gentlemen tend to get out and mingle with crowds. They have a natural suave, charisma and sex appeal that helps them to learn information through acts of persuasion rather than interrogation or theft. Because they put themselves in the spotlight (and crosshairs), Gentlemen spies utilized only the best gadgets to give them an edge. They are the "paladins" of the spy business. Example: James Bond (obviously) Key Skills: Small Arms, Gadgets, Persuasion  - Infiltrator: During the Second World War, "hands on" spies were used, lone operatives skilled with a variety of infiltration skills to enter an enemy base, then use their gadgets, wits, and fighting skills to achieve their goals and get out unscathed. Using high tech support, these "old school" spies are making a comeback. Like assassins, Infiltrators stick to the shadows, but infiltrators do the dirty work - sabotage, theft, interrogation and gunfighting - that assassins prefer to avoid. Example: Sam Fisher from  Splinter Cell  Key Skills: Evasion, Weapons, Interrogation  - Mask: Like the Gentleman, Mask agents make their presence known, you just never know who - or what - he'll decided to look like. Masks prefer deception over combat, and usually know several languages, customs, mannerisms, and even facial expressions of many different people to help them move from one place to the other unnoticed, often in plain sight. Example: Bruce Willis from  The Jackal  Key Skills: Persuasion, Disguise, Gadgets  - X-tremist: The action-hero films and extreme sports thrills of the 21st Century have bred new agents, X-tremists are men and women who will go to the edge and beyond, performing wild stunts and death-defying moves to perform their missions. X-tremists always take the hardest, most thrill-packed assignments, but are very poor performers in areas that require discretion or subtleness. The gentle skills of persuasion, computer hacking, and interrogation are often lost on them. Example: Vin Desil in  Triple X  Key Skills: All Arms, Jumping, Running  - Hunter: Also known as catburglars, Hunters are, unlike their moniker, non-violent agents who use the most extreme stealth to avoid all notice and combat. Their purpose is simple - to find a person, object, or information and exfiltrate it successfully. Because their tasks often involve large amounts of planning and study, Hunters are often experienced as socialites and researchers, learning all they need to put their other skills to use. Because of their non-violent nature, Hunters tend to be poor fighters. Example: Sean Connery from  Entrapment  Key Skills: Information, Jumping, Tumbling  The style of the game is quite simple, players are given missions to complete, and use their unique skills to pull them off. Skills including weapons training, computer knowledge, persuasion, disguise, vehicle training, and gadget skills are put to use. Spies come from all wakes of life, from the most decorated soldier to the lowliest street punk, but they are all chosen because of their talents or knowledge to serve either as mercenary freelancers, or a variety of political and para-military groups, including -   The Global Organized Defense Shield or GODS - Alignment: Lawful Good - Started by NATO in the 1970's, supposedly reports to high levels in the U.N. - Most agents recruited from civilian police or military agencies - Dominant in North America and Europe - Prefers Hunters, Infilrators, and Masks - Provides best access to military hardware - Manipulative and hush-hush, even their best agents do not always know GODS plans.  Cancer Black - Alignment: Chaotic Neutral - Formed by multi-billionare industrialist Mikhail Sutherland in 2005 - Recruits largely Infiltrators, X-tremists - Dominant in conflicted areas including Africa, the Middle East, South America, with supposed activities in North America.  - A mercenary organization that sells its services to anyone who can meet their price. - Access to "outside the law" technologies, including controversial cybernetic and genetic technologies. - The organization demands almost fanatical loyalty to Sutherland and something called "Cancer Black", a codename for a world-wide project funded by Sutherland. They are known to abandon their agents when things get sour, even murdering them to prevent knowledge of Cancer Black from being leaked.  The Neo-Red World Initiative (The Red Star) - Alignment: Lawful Evil - Formed by ex-Soviet and Russian/Asian mafia members after the fall of the U.S.S.R. - Recruits Assassins, Hunters and Masks - Dominant in the Former USSR, China, and Asia. - Dedicated to controlling the world financial markets through acts of political and financial sabotage and terrorism. - Grants access to black market resources and spy networks. - Lacks up-to-date weapons and gadget access.  The Griffon Society - Alignment: Neutral Good - Formed by British and American paramilitary groups that includes Canada, Australia, Japan, France, Germany, and a dozen other member nations after the terrorist attacks of 9/11 - Designed to prevent terrorism and to hunt it down outside of the Geneva Convention. - Recruits Gentlemen, Infiltrators and X-tremists - Dominant in North America, Europe, Australia, and Japan. - Uses the best gadget technologies and proto-type weapons. - Its "fringe-law" policy means that agents are officially considered criminals by most world authorities. Their "bird's eye" organization leaves them outside of the loop of the underworld networks, who exist outside of the Society's immediate resources.

       It was a rough weekend, all appearances aside.   My own writing has hit a dead end, not from any lack of ideas or writer's block but because regardless how much I'm writing right now, I haven't gotten anywhere. Save for a few promising notes from a handful of editors, I'm still standing on the same bloody square in this game of Chutes-n'-Ladders success. I haven't hit any bad times, because I haven't exactly had any  good  times, either. And scanning over a few other blogs today I see other writers getting contracts and selling their work and though they still have a ways to go before they hit the big time, they're on their way, which feels like more than I can say for myself.   I have to ask myself if it's my own fault. Have I not been sending my work to the right people, or often enough? Have I not presented myself as a writer who can carry the work load, or with the talent for the genre or style required? Some folk have said I am a good writer, but that doesn't mean I am a successful one. It's... a gnawing ache in my chest to see myself getting nowhere fast with the very work I so love to do. I wonder that if I am as good as some folks have said, how come I'm not lying through my teeth to interviewers and telling them that "I never buy my own books, that would be tacky." Why, if I do have the talent, am I still at the bottom, while so many around me find their footholds and start up the ladder?  I can't lie to you, I am envious and sometimes even petty about it. I get angry reading about someone else's success, even if I wish them the best of luck in the world and I'm glad they get the opportunity, I thrash in my little cage and demand to know when my time's gonna come.  The answer, of course, does not come from without. I am the only one who can decide how far I take my writing. But I do send out my stories, I learn the trade as I go and improve my game, I try to write something unique to thrill editors, to present myself as a boy who's got some talent and what's more important - a refreshing style that could make them money while at the same time rising me to the level of a professional. A quarter of the time my stories are rejected by I "have potential" or they encourage me to try with a different magazine, which is the same as saying "Take a hike" in my ears. Other times I just get a flat out push-button rejection, which is basically a paragraph of put-down with "Dear Sender" in the place of my name.   The other half of the time, I never hear from my submission again, and the magazines and anthology groups and contest holders I send them to never seem to show any sign of ever having looked upon my work.  It's all fairy typical, I'm sure. All writers have gone through their shakey years where they juggle their jobs and family lives and social lives, struggling to collect pages of lunch-hour pages and coffee-break paragraphs into something resembling a short story or even a novel. And then they send out this work that they hours, weeks, months in preparing, and an editor, sometimes cruelly, turns them down so apathetically it makes you want to cry. You question, how terrible can your writing be to be turned down this way? Did he even read it? Did he even realize the pains you went through to make it, the time and effort? Just because it's not a *@#%ing ming vase doesn't mean it's any less sentimental.  And you send your rejected story out a few more times, thinking maybe someone else, someone with brains, will take your story and appreciate it. And more rejections roll in, sometimes with oh-so-glorious personal notes, like Halmark released sympathy cards for people who want to break up with you but still want to be friends. Stuff like "It's not for us, try another magazine," or "We don't feel we can fit your work into our schedule at this time," and "Don't staple your manuscripts." I don't think the last one deals with relationships, but you know what I mean.  Regardless, I've come to realize the time's of plenty and excess have to end. The days of for-the-love postings on internet forums, and writing stories just because I feel like writing them and have no real intent or hope of publishing them must be put behind me. I have to become a hardass on myself, and even my tiny fan base, if I have one. I have to start working at this like it is a job, because it is a job, and if I expect to get ahead I gotta start showing results. I might be my own boss but the pay is lousy and I don't get dental.   I have to do this, for my career and my future. I'm a lousy laborer and my mental state in the customer service department is the kind of thing you hear about on American Justice (old grouchy witch asked for a bag for her bottle of pop, I saw myself leap over the counter and suffocate her with one). Writing is the one thing, the only thing I'm good at.  It's time to prove it.

       - You realize  Akira  isn't an epic saga, just a 2 hour long drama with ten minutes of bloated psychic girl-friend eating blob at the end. - You begin to theorize how  Ghost in the Shell  could be a prelude to  The Matrix . - You have fantasies with at least one popular anime character (such as those from  Ranma 1/2 ,  Neon Genesis Evangelion , or  Love Hina ), regardless of the fact that they are all underaged. -  Kill Bill  was too bland. - You try to detonate your rival's head by poking him hard in the forehead. - You can't be sexually stimulated unless you pretend your a giant tentacled monster. - You've acknowledge Sailor Moon in any way, shape, or form. - Your neighbor catches you trying to throw fireballs at wooden dummies. - The Japanese are utterly depraved perverts and it doesn't bother you. Or your girlfriend. - Every other style of cartoon artform becomes hopelessly obsolete, and you only acknowledge it if the artist tries an anime flavor. - You fly into a spittle-flecked rage every time someone says that the big-eyed, caucasion flesh tones of Anime characters are meant to help boost sales of anime in the Western markets, arguing that the style was really meant to parody white men during the Second World War the same way Americans charicatured Japanese men as squinty-eyed, buck-toothed asians who sounded like they were trying to lift up their own house. - You get into fights over whether  The Good, The Bad, and the Ugly  or  Trigun  was the best Western of all time. - You think your girlfriend will become uber-orgasmic and howling to the slightest touch when you're being intimate. - Hermaphrodites aren't so bad, their even kind of stimulating. - Girls can slap your face at a speed of mach 2. They can also produce large wooden mallets from behind their backs and can lift an excess of 500 pounds when mad. - Little old Japanese men make viagra look like vallium. - You wonder when a small harem of excessively grabby women are going to show up at your house and start fighting over you. - Conversly, all of the men you know will eventually show up to claim your girlfriend will be a bunch of jerks with a variety of ego, self-esteem, or phsyical problems that you know you can take advantage of in a fight. - You wonder where all the African, Mexican, Aboriginal, and Arabic people are in Anime. - You learn all the martial arts moves you can from anime, then take on a bunch of nasty bikers, waking up at the pearly gates with a poolcue up your rectum, blunt-side in.

       Mawidge.  That humble awwangement, that dweam withim a dweam.   Mawidge is what brings up together. Marriage, between several folks these days. My good buddy Alrunic is off wooing his blushing bride Tiny. They are deep in the no-man's land that is the planning stage for marriage and reception. They're a cute couple, and I support them fully through this time of pre-blessed wedlock.   Oh, but there's more! Harley, or Grimbones, depending on your A.K.A.'s, is rushing through to the wedding stage. It is a hard thing, being rushed to your wedding, but the man is handling it marvellously. Other folks like Azzadar have been married for years and couldn't be happier.  But like I said, all my support goes out to those couples seeking to make their love expressed in bizarre flamboyant ritual and the consumption of a multilayered cake, representing the piles of money, energy, effort, and broken bodies the couple had to climb over to get where they are. Personally I love wedding cake. There's the uniqueness, the artist endeavor that goes into making your wedding cake the best it can be. Like joining the army, except the cake doesn't shout at you like R. Lee Ermey. Plus there's the enjoyment of knowing you're taking a rare opportunity to eat something from the food group "White".  I've been to a few in my time, lemme tell you. Weddings that is. One was between a couple marrying with children, and we all know what a laughably low-brow sitcom that makes for. The husband, an older man from a previous marriage to a manipulative sociopath, already had two kids and was marrying a woman fifteen years his junior who quit school earlier on in life after becoming pregnant and then dumping the man who knocked her up 'cause he was a no good stooge. The affair she had been having with the older man resulted in another pregnancy and they decided to tie the knot, more-or-less shotgun-style.  Being from a low-class family of sub-standard skin tones (rednecks), neither side could really afford a decent marital union, so they went coercion. Both were members of the Society of Creative Anachronisms, or NAMBLA, and decided to turn their marriage into an event, charging the invites to bring food or a little money to send the newly-weds on to their second attempts at a co-dependant family unit.   I was there, just like the rest, dressed in a greatkilt, and, as many of you have probably guessed, hauling a claymore over my shoulder. There I was, a large robust man with a goatee, the closest thing to a true Scotsman as you could get in a small party of bulemic men who's rather buy booze than feed their children and their trophy wenches. Or something. None of them seemed to have have any more success at their first attempts at marriage than the marrying couple in question, so all I could do was sit back, drink some port, some scotch, and a few bottles of Sour Puss and run around swinging my blade like a madman.  "Magically delicious!" I cried fondly, "Magically $*@&ING DELICIOUS!"  So that's the story of how  that  got started.  Regardless, the wedding was fun, out in southern Alberta where the rocky, hilly countryside looks oh-so-much like Scotland itself. We had cake, drank, feasted, then kind of shrugged and went home.  That was almost a year ago.  Last month they seperated, because the man was a deadbeat in terms of actually caring for his kids and the woman lacks complete understanding of what it means to grow the hell up. The ex-husband is currently living with two friends in a duplex that would turn crack-addicts away in disgust. The ex-wife is living in a small home on the other side of town, and is currently putting it to another low-brow bottle-jockey just as immature and unable to care for himself as she is.  The other weddings I've seen were much nicer, with, I dunno, real planning or something. One even had plates of jelly-beans at each table. Good times.   Now, I think my point in all of this is that when you've seen rock bottom, you  know  you can do better. I don't want you to hear my tragic story of almost-not-quite-sort-of love to detract any of you from getting married. From my understanding true marriage is a wonderful thing that can help carry you through bad times and make the good times all the more memorable. Stephen King will go to his grave swearing he never could have done it without his wonderful wife, and as he said, every time he opens a book and sees the author dedicating it to his or her spouse, he thinks  There's another one that knows .   Sometime I'll get married, though it'd be awkward boy lemme tell you. My eccentric preference for the mildly insane will probably nab me a gal who used to be a Tokyo pop-culture girl who at twenty-five still dresses like a catholic school girl with a bright pink backpack decorated with Hello Kitty logos and digital pet keychains, and I'll be there insisting on dressing in my kilt with blue face paint and the symbol of Helm tattooed on my chest. Like reading  Shogun  after some bad acid.   But hey, who cares, as long as your happy, eh? To all the whacky couples in the world, a toast and a kudos - Without you, gettin' hitched at all would be boring as hell.   So to Alrunic and Tiny, Grimbones and Heather. To many, many, many years of working together through hardship and even more moments of shared joy.  But if you can't guess what my real name is, I get your first born children.  P.S. (Heather! Call the police, quick!)  P.P.S. Just kidding. I'm happy for the lot of ya. You're in my thoughts!*     * Mike's message was made all the more frightening when the couples realized the call was coming from  inside  the house.

       It seems every writer with a web-log uses the space to give obscure references to the progress of their work, and I guess I will to, if only to flex my conformist individualism.   Several amateur writers (myself included) were banded together by a dedicated young man named Harley "Grimbones"... something. He'll hate me for it but I haven't gotten his last name, or simply forgot it. It wouldn't be the first time I forgot something important like that. Regardless, the project,  Goblin Tales , was a culmination of short stories dealing with Chuba, a goblin servant to an uncaring master who eventually escapes capitivity to share awkward intimate moments with donuts and maybe get a little high-stakes adventure here and there.   I'm quite happy to say that my story will be the last in the book, largely because my story brings a sense of closure to the book, but I feel a little honored and perhaps a bit smug. Most short-story anthologies reserve the back of their book for a "guest of honor" or a popular author. I'm really neither, but part of what keeps me writing is the desire to be the popular writer. We all do. Don't deny it.  I'm not sharp on the details, but Grimbones seems determined to see his collection published and I myself am eager as well. Nothing in my prospective writing career will mean more to me than seeing my writing in a published book. You can publish in magazines and on websites, in your town's newsletter or the Penthouse forum letters section, but it doesn't match up with the feeling of having a solid, thick book in your hands that you took a part in creating, and that other people will hold in their hands and read. No dog-earred, coffee-stained manuscript, no neat-and-tidy highschool poetry presentation will ever give you that mental orgasm that is to be a published author for the first time.   You'll cling to the book, you'll go to bed with it, you'll carry it around in your pocket and whip it out at friends and people you've never met. It's your darling, your baby, your glorious claim to fame, and one more rung on the ladder, one more piece of material to laugh at anyone who ever mocked you (real or imagined).  So I can't wait. I'm impatient, jittery, I want my copy. I know Grim will read this and roll his eyes with a grin on his face, but I want it. Before my birthday (July) if he can.   Meanwhile, at the Super Friends' parent's basement...   Since I can't get my copy of  Goblin Tales  for some time, I keep myself busy with more writing. Yes, I know it can be an awful thing to watch me descend into the key-board tapping maddness that is the echoing marble hallways of my poorly-lit labrythine brain. People wonder how the hell I write so much and  how  I write so much, and it's because of two quirky, somewhat dangerous traits inherient in my genetic makeup. One is a nigh-crippling bout of Perfectionism or "James Cameron Syndrome" where nothing I accomplish is never good enough for me, which is why I tend to post stories without editing them and/or grow to despise what I do edit, fighting with every ounce of my being to resist the urge to rework the entire piece of grade A slop I see before me, even if someone else says otherwise.   The other is nothing more than jittery hands. They quiver endlessly, not from stress or nervousness or bad joints, but because if I don't use them, I go insane. Since I can't woodwork (though I have built my own bookshelf) and I can't sew (I put together a blue sack of cotton lumps that used to be a pillow), I write, and since I love writing, I write all the time. Watching TV, writing. Eating dinner, writing. Enjoying some quality time at geekfantasygirls.com, writing.  But only with one hand.  *Ahem*  So I spent most of the winter working with some friends of mine and we put together a tabletop RPG that, in all of our opinions (and maybe the opinions of a few others for validity) is better than Eberron, Wizards of the Coast's latest "Call of Cthulu" in progress. Yeah, fans of both will come forward and promise all kinds of threats, but I stand firm. I sympathize with both games, because I don't like to see anyone fail unless they piss me off in some way. We're currently looking for a good game publisher to take our d20 System-style game to their presses. We're also looking for game testers, though I'll have to get back to you on that one, since we're at a weird impass right now. Stay tuned, though.  Besides the RPG, I recently wrote a quick Forgotten Realm's based story on the Wizard's of the Coast forum, you can check it out  urlLink here .  The story is another "maybe", an unofficial, perhaps even false tale of Oakthorn's life, who has never had a solid history or personality in his many appearances. But writing the short novelette helped me build momemtum and I'm working on a novel starring him. Everything is still in the air but I have completed the first part, a "coming of age" bit that deals with Oakthorn's early years including the death of his father, his training in the Helmite religion, and a simple, tradition-honored training exercise that turns horribly wrong and forces a fifteen-year old Oakthorn to face a lethal enemy and start on the path that will carry him through his adult life. From there, the rest of the book will deal with the corruption that plagues Helm's religion and how Oakthorn's honor and integrity clash with the ever-changing mercenary ways of a faith decaying from the inside out. All the while Oakthorn learns about the mysteries that surround his family's history and comes to learn what destiny his god has in store for him.  Epic but humble, in my opinion. I'm having more fun than I thought I could writing it. Speaking of which, I should get started. Let me know what you think.  Mike

       With some bitchin' and whinin' thrown in for flavor.  This is my new blog-site, utilizing the latest in technology and the glory of virutal anonymity so that I, like so many other cowards looking for a place to try and act like they matter in the larger issues of the world at large, can come and have their misspelled complaints and deep-rooted inner-angst and general inability to handle the hardships of daily life laid bare before an audience even more apathetic than when  The Mike Bullard Show  was cancelled.  Wipe your feet.  There now. I know you're wondering. "Mike, what's with the excessive vocabulary? Are you just filling your hard-earned blog with useless words to make yourself sound like you have something to say? Are you really abusing this wonderful chance to make your concerns about the state of the world known to the public?"  Yes.  This really isn't a church, by the way. No, the "Church of the Opinionates" is just a title. We are not a church. Don't let the tax-collectors hear that. No, no religion. We're nothing more than a good old fashioned cult, semi-mainstream. Like Ophraism or Voodoo, we too have our place in the great wide world.   Then again, maybe we're more like an Alchanon meeting without free coffee and group hugs.   Our "church" is dedicated to using our available time and energy to take up  your  time and energy with candid opinions about politics, religion, business, and my own personal struggles, because we all know the key to surviving together in a world of selfishness and greed is to share our burdens so that we all might benefit from the rewards of my unique perspective.  And if you don't like that, I want to talk about it anyways, so f*ck you.  Don't worry though. Like all of us young folk I have a lot of BS to get off my chest, but maybe I can make you laugh with a few twinkle-eyed rants and manage to make a firm statement of the degredation of pretty much everything.  My ultimate goal? Chaos, of course. Most of the North American hemisphere is so stagnant, corrupt and misguided that the only thing that could potentially save the downward spiral of true progress is to tear out the wooden lever on the side of our Laz-E-Boy Society Loveseat and beat people over the head with it.   Mostly the people who used stagnance, corruption, and misguidance to become the so-called "leaders" of a land that could be so much better, with a history to prove that it once was. Those who truly deserve to lead meanwhile, those whose resumes still use words like "honest" and "humble" to describe themselves, remain in obscurity, struggling just to survive in a culture that above all else values individual success whatever the cost over the betterment of the whole. North America is spiting one arm to glorify the other. Politicians sound more like Professional Wrestlers shouting poorly-scripted prompter-read threats at one another, religion nose-dives into is own uber-conservative death throes, business weans the young through advertisement and the pseudo-religion of fads and social manipulation. All of these terrible problems that affect all of North American are as terrifying as those that fill movies and novels - corrupt governments, conspiracies of corporate rule over democracy, religion that bends the people to its will or people who bend religion to their own.  Why no one does anything about it is simple. In a world of pop-culture over true culture, our real-life, real-world problems simply aren't "Hollywood" enough. There isn't enough melodrama for thrill-seeking, quick-fix, easy-answer-raised North Americans to do anything about their society's ills. Most of us just don't care, which is exactly what the wrong-doers of this age of "comfortable malice" want. They get away with murder and run people's lives into the ground, and no one does anything. Why?  Why bother?  It's the drug we can't get enough of. We're given enough to get addicted, have to fight like dogs to get more, but as long as we get our fix, we don't care what happens to us, our children, our neighbors or the rest of the world.   We're all capable of so much more. We  deserve  so much more, and we can fight off the addiction with our will and the knowledge that we can do better for ourselves without it. It's a mix of being decent to one another and not taking any bullshit from people who want to push you around, trying to wretch freedom from you under a facade of "big brother know best".  Cold turkey is tough, but we can win in the end. Freedom of choice means you can pick something  other  than fast-food, corporate-designed fashion fads, and plastic-smile politicians who aren't going to do anything for you, but want more of your hard-earned money.  If you turn your back on the people who try to make your choices for you, they inevitably die, the pillars of power that hold them are as insubstantial as their credibility and usefulness to civilization. Once you stop relying on them to keep you with an unhealthy supply of market-plan pop-culture, the pillars crack. But the problem is only gonna get worse if we leave things as is.  Don't be afraid, we're all in this together, and I'm with you every step of the way.  And all that jazz. I'll talk about other junk, like my writing, too. So I won't seem like the Anti-Limbaugh most of the time. I'll bring you all my weekly tirades in a much more humorous format, the kind of thing that would do Jon Stewart and Dennis Miller (the late 80's version, and not the 00's version currently fighting for more air time against late night softcore cable porn) proud.   So stop by often, chances are I'll find something new to be pissed off at and degrade with my unique style of mocking sarcasm, rather than forming a fascist-esque Mother's Against Everything lobby group and running around like a deranged headless chicken.  I'm known to do that after a few tequilas.  So I'll see you around, huh? Be cool.  Mike

       So my buddy Harley and his gal Heather are tying the knot. My other good buddy Chris and his gal... um,  Chris , *Pauses* are getting married soon, too. Everyone's jumping on the co-dependant band-wagon these days. It really gets you thinking.  According to Stats Madeup, 10% of all marriages end with the wife wearing the daddy pants. She goes out and works and earns the family wages while the husband stays at home and takes care of the kids. What I don't like about this setup is the reverse machoism that house-husbands try to force on you, like they're somehow more of a man than you are because they're a stay-at-home dad and the wife is out in the work-force. Listen, buddy, you're wearing the cooking apron because your wife went out and got her Degree in Human Resources Management at University and you took two years of ethnic handpuppetry over the internet, you zuchinni-bread-baking half-man.  On the other end, nearly 70% of marriages hold men as the provider. This is been around for ages, starting before humans foreplayed the Monolith. Men when out, hunted, and brought back the meat for everyone to have fun consuming. Some women will argue this is the male desire to enforce their power over others. Duh. We evolved from animals that killed one another for the rights to eat first, have children, and lead. What the hell did you think we got it from? Self-help brochures? If we still had it the way we wanted it, you would never be married, and the first guy to come around and plug your boyfriend gets the right to murder your current children and force you to have his. Does your current situation seem a little more agreeable? Thought so. I'm all for the rights of women to live their lives, I really don't care how you want to do it, so long as its ethical, but think about it - does being liberated really mean not having to shave your legs and call them police-persons?  Finally we have the 20% of co-dependants who actually, you know, co-dependize, or whatever you call it. Usually they both work, both make a place for themselves in the world, and juggle family, work, and personal time together. It can be shakey yes, but I find this is the most agreeable form of marriage there is. Because honestly, ladies, did you flutter your big blue eyes and say "I do" just so you could stay at home all day? For those of you who did, I'm writing down your names. These partnerships are real partnerships, they might be a working team together, trying to blossom their personal business or dreams into success. I applaud these kinds of people. They don't care about gender rolls, they're fighting to make their lives better for themselves and their kids.  They say 60% of marriages end in divorce, but you know from my perspective I've only ever heard of two families getting divorced. My folks have been married for damn near thirty years, my grandparents for almost sixty. And like all people too close together they have their spats, who doesn't? The fact that their still together says something, doesn't it? I think so. It says a lot. Good things, too.  I wanna get married. Where do I sign?

       You know two centuries ago you would be hung for stealing a horse. It was the kind of Saturday afternoon the whole family could enjoy.  Recently I learned that a man I once knew was arrested for possession and dealership of child pornography, and the simmering desire to see that man dragged into the street and beaten to death came to mind.  Instead he's sentenced to two years in a medium security prison.  What the fuck is wrong with a society that practically  encourages  these kinds of disgusting freaks to exist? Isn't it obvious? Two years. Jesus Christ. Are you  that  unsure of what to do with these mutants? Do you need a guideline? Are you waiting for the fucking Vatican to decide what to do with  their  fucking pedophiles?  Here's a few tips, for you in office on what you can do when you catch a pedophile, rapist, or any other kind of predator who violates and steals the lives from innocent people, the people you  claim  to serve.  - Castration is a good idea. And no, I don't mean happy anesthetic surgery, I mean putting the fucker's cock and balls on the big log your dad keeps in the back for cutting firewood and taking a hatchet to 'em. One good solid hit will give the man a reason to keep his fucking mitts off of an innocent person. Hell, take his hands, they're half the culprit too. And his tongue, and his eyes. Yeah, his eyes, that should keep the fucking freak from staring. Only fun until you lose an eye, right, fuckface?  - Poetic justice is one of my favorites, there's something to be said about the pain and violation a man would feel experiencing the same pain and violation that his victims felt. Yeah, hurts when your privates are stabbed with a knife, doesn't it? Get used to it, you worthless sack of shit, you did it to six women. That's six sessions. Don't pass out yet.  - On the line of poetic justice, let's let the families of the victims have some fun. Strap the rapist pedopile trash to a wall and give the family a selection of entertaining torture devices. That's right, Bobby, work the bad man's groin, make sure you line up the nail in your baseball bat each swing, okay Tiger? I want that sick rapist fuck to have to look the family of his victims in the eyes, and I want them to try and be superior, try to smile as the family lays into them with their crude impliments of punishment. Five or six hot pokers to the midsection will steal the smile off of anyone's face.  - But why should the family get all the fun? There are millions of poeple in North America, just  begging  for the opportunity to show the sexual predator scum of the earth how they feel for forcing them to lock their doors at night, for forcing them to guard their children twenty-four hours a day, for forcing them to carry weapons just to protect themselves and for instigating a societ of mistrust where people can't even learn their next door neighbors. I'd like to meet the guy I used to know, I'd like to show up, and ask him why he did what he did. And if his answer isn't "Because I'm a sick mutant and I deserve to die in the most brutal form imaginable, to stand as an example to all the freaks of the world as to what happens to my kind when we take advantage of the innocence of humanity," then I'm going to introduce him to my knife collection, and believe me, I have one  hell  of a good imagination when it comes to good times with blades.  Now I've got the morality brigade banging at my door. The ACLU will fight your right to put up a Catholic Nativty scene on your lawn at Christmas time but they will fight  for  the right of the drunk moron who wanders into the scene and fucks one of the sheep in the ass.   The National Man-Boy Love Association, which has absolutely no concent at all from young kids anywhere in the world claims that pedophilia is some kind of beautiful thing, and not just a sickening mental disorder where you would prefer to fuck something that doesn't even understand what your doing. Just because you can't score with actual women doesn't give you the right to push your sick lack of humanity on something that can't fight back as easily. I can't even describe the kind of punishment you all deserve.  Even the Catholic church isn't able to get with it. These people were burning innocent women at the stake for trying to educate themselves, now they're playing Shellgame with their clergy, shuffling all the Father Badtouch's of the world back and forth so the family's of the victims can't point them out of a priestly police lineup. When my father was growing up you'd get beaten with a belt for eating meat on a Fridays but now all of the sudden everyone's a little murky on the whole fucking rulebook.  * *  We're letting them get away with it, people. We're letting them get away with it all. We flock to the violence in media but we cringe from it in life. We have this mentality that it's somehow not real, that we can somehow pretend it's all make believe so long as it doesn't involve us. Well it  does  fucking involve us, and standing by letting sick fucks get away with all of the sick, fucking acts they commit is just proof that we're all one big victim. We go into shock when we hear about it but then we turn around and just go back on with our lives like it never fucking happened, we push it from our minds.  Well you'd better wake the fuck up, 'cause the children are out there and they deserve to grow up in a society we the bad guys gets what's coming to him, where the good guys win and the innocent people don't get shoved aside just because some asshole doesn't think that raping a little kid is heinous enough a crime to call for the immediate and prolonged punishment of the freaks of this world.  'Cause pedophiles and rapists aren't making a choice to be what they are, they aren't debating the pro's and con's. If they were mentally stable, they'd never even  think  about the acts they commit. This isn't homosexuality where they can go out and have concensual sex with a willing, adult partner, this is forcing their fucking sickness, their disease, on someone, this is an act of pure evil against the helpless, it's about thinking they're in control, that they own the world, by committing these acts on the innocent.  Well fuck them. If I ever see anyone committing an act like that, I will rip them apart; eyes, lips, ears, hair, I'll twist and break and tear and I won't stop until they're dead or close enough to it that they'll never hurt anyone again.   Because I'm sicking of them doing it. I'm sick of them getting away with it. And I'm sick of so many people not doing anything about it. They deserve the worst fate, the worst. Damn them all.

       When I was younger, my dad, being the partial geek he was, had all three copies of the Star Wars trilogy, and I grew up watching them. I knew about stormtroopers and Chewbacca and Darth Vader before I was even in ECL (for anyone who hasn't taken that, it's an Early Children's Learning program designed for pre-grade schoolers). My first gaze at T&A (however tasteful) came from Leia dressed in that crazy metal bikini bit that seems to have defined a generation of perverted nerds.  I cheered when the Death Star blew up, I was terrified when Luke learned who his real father was, I even cried when Darth Vader turned on the Emperor and flung him into the second Death Star's reactor core. Again and again I watched these films and they helped propel me into the world of science fiction and fantasy that I immerse myself today.  Like most of you I was excited at the prospect of George Lucas finally stepping forward to finalize his epic, and like most of you, I was shocked and appauled at horribly bad it was. I've seen cartoon characters who look more believable than Mark Hamill's facial expressions, but I can stomach it since no one else can do that part like he does.    The Phantom Menace , on the other hand was frought with sour taste. The name itself sounds like something your wise-crackin' uncle might say after letting out a ripping fart. And no offense to folk like Liam Neison or Samuel L. Jackson, but one of the reasons the first trilogy worked was because Lucas brought in a cast of new faces, and not just every-day actors you could pick out of a masquerade ball. It takes away the freshness, the impact of the characters, when you decided to stick with famous celebrities. Do you think  Spiderman  would have been such a success if you had gone "safe" and stuck a geek like Leonardo Decaprio into the bit? Yargh.  Besides that, the plot is full of holes. And I'm not talking about the good, suspense-building kind. I'm talking about the "What the fuck?" plotholes, the kind that only appear when the writer of the story decides to toss out something established in favor of making his current story work. The Simpsons do it all the time, but we can expect that kind of behaviour from a TV show that's been on the air longer than Generation X has been alive.  Anyways. The movie blew like a Puritan wife. But hey, I'm used to it, I'm used to fantasy and sci-fi writers pissing away their endings since they think they have a right to get away with it. I've seen it before and I'll see it again, so I didn't bitch too much when I saw it. I walked away from the story and didn't look back until just recently, when my brother suggested I try  Knights of the Old Republic .  And you know, it's good. Not just kind of good, but really good. It's rekindled my interest in the epic, and brought up a valid point. With the New Jedi Academy series in bookstores drawing in new fans and games like KotOR winning new players to the Light Side, I have been thinking-  I think its time that Lucas pass the torch.  Already hardcore fans are preparing my burning effigy, but keep in mind that even  I  am not old enough to qualify as a "True" Star Wars fan. You are old and decrepid and still living in your parent's basements. Today's new fans all have jobs and wives and instead of jumping on chatrooms to scream about how much you love wookies, we're all out writing stories and making our moves to become the next generation of writers who will, inevitably, take over an ailing George Lucas' place as the gods of the universe he might have created but cannot carry any longer.   The pissy thing is that now that he's effectively failed to create a stirring prequel to the epic trilogy, it has left the universe open to anyone who wants a bite. I've seen just as many crappy wanna-be authors try their hands at the Star Wars world as I have seen good ones. It's lowered it from the level of the truely good writers to a point where it's vulnerable to these bottom-feeding so-called authors. If Lucas had kept his mouth shut, he might have let his universe remain up with Lord of the Rings as the masterpiece of Science Fantasy it was.  But noooo, Hayden Christensen would make SUCH a good Anakin Skywalker. Please. I've seen camels kiss better. And read scripts and act.   Huh. Well at least Yoda put out. He was swinging that lightsaber like the only guy with a cheeseburger at a reefer's party. Bow down to the little green man.  Now if only the rest of the swordsmen in that could fight that way.

       When I was young, my dad and I would watch Calgary Flames hockey. Not being a sport's buff or even very attentive in my early years, I wasn't too sure what was happened, but it didn't matter to me. Ed Whalen was calling the show and the man makes WWE's Jim Ross sound like Al Gore announcing golf. I would just watch two teams (one of them always the Flames) dashing back and forth on the ice, and when Ed called out " He-shoots-he- SCOOOOORES!!!  " My dad and I would got nuts.  Only recently, perhaps the same ten years its taken Canada to get back to the Stanley Cup, but my interest has rekindled, to the point where I actually know what's happening and get tense watching as Calgary made its way to the Finals. I remember the Red Wings and the Flames going back and forth like a pair of master fencers, with victory haning on the overtime edge. I watched as anguished San Jose could do nothing to stop the puck from sliding into their open net at the end of the third period. Poor guys, that isn't a good way to go.   And finally Calgary and Tampa Bay stand at the finals, trading victories back and forth that are hard-won by both teams, they're both hungry for the Cup. Watching the Saddledome games, and you see a sea of red jerseys in the crowd, and woe to the poor bastard who dressed otherwise. And in Tampa, it's a white field and a sold-out, record breaking crowd for Game 5.  The latest game had me on the edge of my seat, going into overtime with a 2-2 tie, and both teams were back and forth, back and forth, with more close-calls than was probably good for me.  But it just seems that everyone is catching the excitement going on in the playoffs. I can't count the amount of Flames flags I see on people's cars each day, and even people who don't normally sell sport's memorabilia are gettin' in on the surefire cash crop.  The games are close for the Flames and the Lightning. Calgary only needs to win one more game, but Tampa's proven that Calgary hasn't dominated the Finals, and its great to see them really going at it, to be really fighting for a win.   I am cheering for Calgary, but I know that this is the closest Tampa has ever gotten to the Stanley Cup, and they deserve their shot in the spotlight just as much as the Flames.   So to both teams I just gotta say Good Luck! You've really ignited the excitement in Hockey again. I mean, c'mon, even  I'm  excited, and that's not something that happens with me and sports very often.

        ...Or how I learned to stop worrying and love the bomb.   Over the past year I feel I have learned a lot about my writing craft. I've upped my skills, earned a few new feats, and I know that while I am not and will never be the best, I am quite happy with my current progress. I know the difference between style and substance, between gimmickry and character, eye candy and brain food. With no real effort on my own part, I have taken the path of the character, the heart and soul of any story, and have walked it happily for some time.  I was one of the original writers who stepped up to the challange of Wizards of the Coast's  Maiden of Pain  Open Call, for a potential nobody writer to actually become an instant fantasy hit. The popularity of the contest and the amount of new talent it drew into one place has already ensured that new-comer and kindly old shoemaker Kameron M. Franklin will be an instant fan-favorite, simply because he was one of us little folk who was thrust up upon the stage to do his thing. Like many of us, I, as a MOP'er, was somewhat disappointed by the rejection, but life goes on and we all did some growing (and some of us did some learning) and now here we stand once more:  Wizards has come forward with perhaps a fitting new Open Call, summoning us once again to try our hands at the new  Eberron&nbsp; Campaign Setting. This contest will be a much more&nbsp;difficult one, I think, simply because of the relative newness of the setting. In some ways, you might see it as an almost shameless attempt to make money off of the desperate, that at least a few hundred copies of  Eberron  went out to writers who know little or nothing of the setting, but just wanted a taste of that sweet, sweet novel contract.&nbsp;Whether that's the truth or not doesn't matter, the fact is, people are answering the call.  The "War-Torn" Open Call is different from the  Maiden of Pain  contest in many ways. The deadline is far shorter, I only heard about the contest at the end of June, and all proposals have to be in the Wizard's HQ by August 31st. That puts stress on the submitters to get something out right away, and it can lead to trouble, with mistaken&nbsp;details&nbsp;and poorly developed plots. It's happened before and it'll happen again. In a way, it ensures that only the most dedicated and driven talent will get the best proposals in. It's harsh, but it's law of the jungle. Those with the capacity to write well and write fast will get the best results.  I've been told I can write well and I've been told I can write fast, and this is especially true to me when I have found something that I like. When I first heard about the  Eberron  setting, I was turned off by it. All this talk about warforged and lightning trains and skyscraper cities made me think  "Oh great, they picked a setting that's full of toys."  Like a few writers, I hesitantly purchased a copy of the campaign setting book and started reading.  And you know what? I like it, I like it a lot. Keith Baker obviously thinks they&nbsp;way I do. You might have a world packed with all kinds of crazy goodies, but its useless unless you've got a good, solid setting that really intrigues players. There's an air of restlessness, of desperation and even despair in  Eberron , and it all but begs you to create a hero capable of solving the world's ills. I knew from the moment I finished the book that I  had  to create a character for this world.   So I went to my drawing board (usually this means leaning back in my chair and staring at the ceiling) and thought about what Wizards wanted from their proposal. The War-Torn bit is easy: the continent of Khorvaire just came out of a century-long war. Everyone's lost something, sure, but then I thought: has anyone considered that these people grew up during this war? Has anyone wondered that perhaps people  lived  for the war, that they grew up expecting the war to go on long after they were dead?  That became the backbone of my story. I wanted a miserable, desperate character who lost everything because of the war, and the war became his only purpose to live. Then, the war ends. What would he do? How would he adapt to peace? Could he adapt? I traumatized and tormented my character, subjecting him to the loss of everything he cared about because of a vicious betrayal. With only his hate to guide him, he became a monster, killing for killing's sake, and revelling in the freedom to do it because the necessities of war called for it. When the war ends, he suddenly has no enemies to fight, and he is alienated and alone because he was not prepared for peace. Betrayed from all sides, he has nothing left but the ache in his chest from old pains and no desire for anything anymore, not even life. But even as he sits in his run-down shack in the middle of a nowhere village, trying to find the will to push his own sword into his chest, he clings to life. He thinks its cowardice, but perhaps there's more to it?  Perhaps there's hope? Somewhere deep inside, with just enough strength to keep him from ending it all, from putting to a close the long, sorry existance of a man who never got to live the life he was promised.   And there, brooding, angry, and hopeful deep down inside, was my character. The purpose of my novel is to give him a purpose, something new to hold onto, something better than old pain and hate.   I was exceptionally pleased with my idea, and though it was a little rough on the get-go, I managed to spit and polish it to a greater shine.   It was during my trials to make the best proposal I could that I realized something - I was clinging to old habits. My early plot had cults and powerful magic and epic grandeur. I didn't include the warforged (in my opinion EVERYONE is after the warforged, so go at it, I'm not big on robots anyways) but I had changelings, kalashtar and shifters and everyone had a prestige class and there were love triangles and I just had to go STOP! WAIT! HOLD ON A MINUTE!  I can't make a gimmick-filled story. I can't. It would destroy the focus of the plot, it would hamper all my efforts to create a good solid main character that is the reason why I'm writing the proposal to begin with. In my haste to "biggie size" my idea, I had crushed all the good stuff underneath. I was a little regretful, but I knew for the sake of my chances with Wizards, I had to cleanse my story of unwanted elements.  So what did I do? Well, I started by removing the kalashtar, she was a non-combatant and really had no purpose except as a damsel in distress which is so cheesy it made me spill my morning tea. With her gone, the supposed love-triangle between her, my main character, and my co-star was gone, too. Now we just have the main character and his hate/love/hate relationship with his female comrade. Next, the shifter took a backseat. I still have a big plan for him, but I couldn't have him stealing the show. This is my character's story, not his, so back of the line, fuzz-ball. Next, I couldn't have cults and huge underground conspiracies. It's just lame, I could do everything I wanted with a simple group of badguys. So out went the monks of the Mockery and such. After that, I made all of my heroes pretty puny, low-level and only two of them have a level in any prestige class. I removed all but two very important magical items, and removed any plans I had for  Matrix esque fight scenes. Having been a fan of movies like  Indiana Jones  for longer than I can remember, the action I wanted for this story had to be more "human" and thrilling. Any idiot can computer animate a scarecrow-thin Keaneu Reeves do a spinning flip kick, but watching a dusty, bloody, bruised Harrison Ford hanging off of a Nazi cargo truck while fighting six or seven thugs just ups the excitement factor for me and just about everyone.   So in the end, the story remains very down to earth while having a large enough scale to have the reader cheering on the good guys all the way to the final page. The story is more about thrills and chills and less about outrageous magical powers and an a cast like something out of  Mad Mad House . It keeps its humanity and it keeps its believability, and even though I have no way of knowing for sure, I think I've got a good shot at the prize.   But when I look around at the forums that are hosting fellow WarT's I see writers so excited that they've created a shifter/changeling/warforged group or that they are going to have their characters get their own airship or they're going to take on the Lord of Blades and on and on and I freak out. I want to know what possesses these fellow writers (some of them bad, some of them good) to want to take the kind of directions they take.&nbsp;He with the most toys decidedly does not win in this endeavor, but everyone wants to get onto the eye-candy bandwagon, like their tenth-level party of ethnic-mismatches will instantly assure them a victory. That's the path I walked with  Maiden of Pain  and I didn't even get a personalized rejection letter when they responded to me. Nothing, nadda, goose-eggs, and it'll happen to all the writers out there who walk the path of special effects and props. Remember what became of  Matrix: Revolutions?   Now I'm not saying to cut the "new" stuff out of your story,  Eberron  was made to accomodate them. You don't  have  to drop your warforged character because you're afraid of looking like you support style over substance, just remember to keep him real. Hard to do with a living sentient construct but bear with me. He doesn't have to be some Commander Data wannabe trying to become more "human". There's so much more to Keith Baker's world and I really want everyone to know that.  Well. I can't tell you what to do, and I'm hardly the one who knows exactly what to do.  Just do your best, and may the best man win.

        It Happened on This Day in HISTORY!!!  &nbsp; 1304: The famous poet Petrarch, who is considered the creator of modern day sonnets and inspired such wrights as Geoffrey Chaucer, William Shakespeare, and Edmund Spenser, is born in Italy, and later dies, which was the style at the time. He may or may not be quoted as once saying "That Wallace bloodline is one-ah crazy meat-ah-ball-ah!"  1871: The Province of British Columbia, known for its warm climate, multiple lakes, mountains, fresh fruits, high taxes and corrupt government officials becomes an official province of the Dominion of Canada. "We did it for Clan Wallace," An unofficial representative of British Columbia is quoted as saying, shortly before being burned for practicing a form of witchcraft known as "Herbal Essences", driving women to wanton acts of uncivilized carnality while bathing.  1881: Sioux leader Sitting Bull surrenders to the U.S. Army under a promise of Amnesty. Sitting Bull's memory lives on today as America's Favorite middle/lower-class pastime.  1944: A bomb meant to assassinate German dictator Adolf Hitler explodes at his headquarters, killing four. Hitler survives, and the senior military staff who conspired against him are executed in a move analysts call "ironic".&nbsp;The incident causes ripples of shock throughout the German people, causing many political backlashes including a tightening of security throughout the nation, the invasion of a foreign country, and later into inquries about the effectiveness of the German National Socialists Party during post-20/44 aftermath as the country decided if Hitler was right to decide to start a war.  1969: U.S. Apollo 11 astronaught Neil Armstrong suckerpunches overly trusting co-pilot Eddie "Buzz" Aldrin to become the first man on the moon, but has to drop his long-winded speech when he realizes he can't take his glove off to read the notes he scribbled onto his palm.   1981: Fortold by a secret society of madness-worshiping conspirators during the early 1800's , Mike Wallace is born, instilled with the ability to weave a tapestry of the written word, twisting and manipulating the minds of all who read his work and building an army of fanatical worshipers (or at least a handful of fans).    Checking for&nbsp;Cancer, the Crab  &nbsp; The fourth sign of the Zodiac is the sign of Cancer the Crab. People born between the dates of June 22 to July 22 are said to be born under the sun sign of Cancer. According to the zodiac, the moon rules Cancer, which is a water sign.  In an odd twist of irony, Cancerians (also know as the Pincer People) are considered to be nuturing, emotional, sensitive, conservative and home-loving. In essence, he is the kind of person you would marry for romance and security, the dependable guy who seems to be dwindling in this day and age. Chances are he'd still be cuddled up next to you after sex rather than calling a cab and promising to "call you later". For example.   Due to the signs association with the moon, Cancerians often have widely fluctuating moods. YOU TAKE THAT BACK YOU ROTTEN MOTHERLESS, awww, kitties!!!   Astrologers say Cancerians are artistic, have vivid imaginations, and highly developed memories. Artistic yeah, vivid imagination yeah, highly developed memories? This guy never met a Cancerian. Or he has and we just don't remember meeting him.   Like people born under water signs, they are much more aware of how they feel than what they think. I don't think I know how to feel just now.   According to astrologers (and at least one or two quacks), Cancerians' ability to sense other people's needs and emotions make them sympathetic and nuruturing, and often personable and easy to get along with. They are said to place great importance on family and crave security. They often withdraw into themselves for protection. Astrologers believe typical Cancerians can have difficulty being objective, and are easily crushed by criticism. They also say that Cancerians worry to much. I'm sympathetic and nuturing, you jerk. Where's all this "worry too much" crap coming from? Whatever. You're just jealous 'cause we're the coolest sign, you Peices you.   Professions associated with the sign Cancer include ones related to domestic activities. Hospitality, cooking, catering and childcare, as well as writing or other jobs that require imagination. Never had to cater before. I think I'm pretty good with the rest of this stuff, though. Swanky.   BOW DOWN TO DA CRAB!

         Yes. Birthday. Mine.    *Sigh* You know I envisoned myself already pumping out gigantic blockbuster novels by this point. It just goes to show you that some childish dreams are just that, childish.     But that's not what bothers me. I know I still have plenty of years ahead of me to plot my rise to power and the eventual destruction of my enemies.&nbsp;I guess that'll all come later.    Meantime, I'm gonna sit back, relax through the anniversary of my twenty-third year of terror in this plane of existance, maybe invite a few friends from the Plane of Madness and kick back with some cold drinks and blood sacrifices. It's great to be da king.

        - I wonder if any Secret Service officers have ever walked into Bush's private room and found him playing with actions figures, acting out how he's going to take over the world and "get the girl" in the end.&nbsp; &nbsp;  - We've gone from teaching Greek and Latin in Highschool to teaching English in College.  &nbsp;  - 24 Hour call-in support was created so people either wouldn't have to figure out a problem for themselves or would have someone to scream at when they are charged money they don't want to pay.  &nbsp;  - My problem is I don't care what your problem is.  &nbsp;  - If all men ever think about it sex, and we've been doing that for thousands of years, why do women act like the trend only just started?  &nbsp;  - We have vaults, guards, alarms, boobytraps, and armored cars to protect our money, yet our children walk the streets completely unsupervised.  &nbsp;  - How many women and children have to be abused, sexually assaulted, and killed before the government finally lets&nbsp;us start hunting down and ruthlessly executing the culprits?  &nbsp;  - Why do Americans make such crap-lousy beer? Conversly, why do Canadians use their beer as a subject of national pride?  &nbsp;  - To me, nothing says patriotism like watching a shark-suited executive trimultaenously screaming into his cell-phone, flipping me the bird and going sixty miles an hour while making a left hand turn at a red light in his sperm-whale sized SUV sporting two tiny American flags.

       Usually while I'm at work.  &nbsp;  - That picture from the Abu Ghraib prison with the army-chick doing the "bang bang" gestures at the hooded Iraqi prisoners would make a good poster to super-impose a Chuba the Goblin thong onto.  &nbsp;  - I have to wait until&nbsp; friggin' November to pick up my copy of Halo 2, which I bought in flippin' April.  &nbsp;  - Working for a call-in center, I realize that Americans created 24 hour tech support as an excuse to actually figure out what's wrong with their cell phone themselves. That, and people can fly into spittle-flecked rages when they are actually charged money on their phone bills. And the cell-phone company I work for is one of the worst out of the big leaguers.  &nbsp;  - The eleventh commandment deems that all office buildings must be more humid and hot than it is outside.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  - Life is neither a box of chocolates, nor anything else you try to compare it to. That being said, stop trying to trade your life for the chocolates.  &nbsp;  - It's actually all Dr. Phil's fault.  &nbsp;  - Michael Jackson should get breast implants. I mean, if he's in competition with Marylin Manson, then I say go all the way.  &nbsp;  - All male humans are homophobic. A guy can be alone in a public washroom and standing two feet away from the urinal. The moment another man walks in, he slams his hips against the cold porcalin and clenches his ass tight. They also refuse to take a dump unless all other men are not present. Not being a woman, I can't vouch for the female side.  &nbsp;  - If all men ever think about is sex, and this trend has been continuing for hundreds of thousands of years, at what point did women start acting like we just started doing it? It's not like we've had a period where all men were thinking about improving the well-being of everyone else's lives.  &nbsp;  - Babies are the most selfish, greedy, and insensitive creatures on the planet, but put one in a room and suddenly every woman present becomes his personal slave. Go figure.  &nbsp;  - Why is it that I sound exactly like my dad over the phone, but my dad doesn't sound a thing like me over the phone?  &nbsp;  - Why do people continue to buy stupid shit for no reason, and then bitch about it later?  &nbsp;  - Why can't American's make decent beer? Conversly, why do Canadians have nothing but their beer to be proud of?  &nbsp;  - Just watch. The Presidential election will come up, and some state will suddenly suffer a massive seizure and turn into drooling morons, allowing Bush to win yet another controversial win. Honestly, can no one else see the wires running out of the back of Bush's neck and straight into John Ashcroft's Gameboy?

       This Eberron "War-Torn" Novel open call that Wizards of the Coast is holding really has me excited. I tend to get that way when I'm working, oddly enough. Having a steady job that I hate is god's way of telling me to get my real talent's ass in gear. I write like mad because I want someone to call me up and go "This is great! We want a nine novel contract! I'll give you $50 grand and my twenty-year old daughter as an advance, whaddya say?!"  Okay, so maybe that's wishful thinking. I can settle for $40 grand. And the daughter.  *Ahem*  Pathetic bachelor fantasies aside, the open call has given me a chance to get in the door with Wizards, who I've had aspirations of working for for some time. The last time they had an Open Call, I was still a rookie in all aspects, my ideas had some of the flavor they wanted, but too much wild childish delusions of godhood thrown into it *rolls eyes* But this time, I think I've got it more than right, and I've developed quite a bit over the past year. My last sample (non-open-call) got me a personal reply from Pete Archer, one of Wizard's top editors, who thought I had potential, but couldn't fit me into the packed 2004-2005 schedule. He encouraged me to try again later, and this open-call seems like the light at the end of the tunnel, doesn't it?  Providence. That's all I can say about it. :D

       Monday afternoon. A UPS employee pulls up in his shiny brown van and delivers to me my very own copy of the Eberron Campaign Setting. Over the past few days, my time is dominated by studying the new world so I can create a story proposal for Wizards of the Coast, who are holding an Eberron Open-Call for a new novel.  I read the book, I  touched  the book. I think I licked the book a few times. I ran names and places and monsters and history through my head. I read on my work breaks, I read during my lunch breaks, I got home and I read until bedtime, and then a few half-hours after that, too.   Saturday morning. Less than a week later, I'm done the book. I can tell you what's where, and who's who, and I am busy-busy-busy into growing my own story for the Open-Call, which is blossoming beautifully and promises to create a memorable, action-packed story. From the way the campaign is built, the theme here is to be fast, to the point, and exciting for readers.  George Lucas did the same thing creating  Starwars , he wanted a fast paced movie with an in-depth, entertaining story. Now it can be easy to sacrifice one for the other. We learned the empire was evil, and we know that the Death Star destroys. We know Luke has skill with the Force, we learn Darth Vader is bad-ass. And that's pretty much it. Fast, to the point, exciting. It kept the movie-goers glued to the edge of their seats, and today, those people are still sitting in those very same theaters, waiting for their geek-fat to thin out enough for them to squeeze out of their pants and get home.  That's the kind of feel I want for my story, and I think I can do it, too. Time will tell, but my skills have improved a fair bit since my last Open-Call attempt. I've got the skills, I've got the knowledge, I've got the flavor.  I just can't believe I got this far in a week. And I didn't get fired, either. Go figure.  The good part was I found out a lady I work with is also a geek, so we got in-depth into the workings of the game over lunch. Could Eberron be the key to my romantic troubles? Stay tuned, sports fans.   Quick! Fetch my brain-freeze medicine and my Lou Ferringo Big Gulp slurpee keg! I feel like replacing my blood with sugarwater!

       So I get up this morning at six like I do every day to get to work. It's dreary, it's been raining all week, and all I wanna do is get into my car and crank the heat so I can at least have a comfortable drive, since my house is colder than coal-miner's teat.   But I get into the car, and the first thing I notice is that my insurance info is lying on the floor near the gas pedal. Confused, thinking that perhaps it had slipped out while I was getting out of the car, I kneel down, grab it, and go to tuck it back into the sun-shade flap, where I have a special pouch there to tuck these kinds of things.  And I notice that my CD Player remote control bit is gone.  Confused, my eyes dart to the CD Player.  The cover flap is gone.  I had to think about this one for a while. I search the car quick, and found that besides the CD Player and the remote, the theives almost took off with half of the CD's I keep in the car (about a dozen crap records that I use for background noise on particularly long drives) and they've popped by trunk, where I keep some tools for the car, but find nothing gone from there, either.  In total, the thieves made off with:  1 CD Player  flap , which is utterly useless without a CD Deck to put CD's into. 1 CD Remote player, which doesn't help if your stolen CD flap doesn't have a CD Deck. 12-14 CD's including a scratched old copy of Metallica's Black Album and I think some techno I tried once.  Now! Here's my paradox. The thieves were obviously opportunists, who were looking for quick heists, and taking use of the bad weather to work in relative peace in the dead of night. They were thorough, because you don't just get into my car and spot the CD Remote sitting there. They were also not car thieves, otherwise I'd have come out in the morning and found nothing but my floppy Ron Jeremy antenna attachment lying on the ground.  On the other hand, how absolutely DUMBFUCK do you have to be to take the CD flap, and not the CD deck? My setup wasn't the type you could just attach to any other deck, so unless the thieves have the appropriate deck, they just stole a $25 cd flap and about $5 worth of CD's. For what? *Snort* My player is older than my friggin' computer. How did you ever learn how to rob people in-between bouts of colossal fuck-uppedness and circle-jerking to see who would tip the pizza delivery guy?  I just want to know. Just tell me, I'll go along with it, but honestly. There was a beat up old Ford rustheap sitting not twenty feet away with a $500 stereo system in it, Fort Knox with a revolving door, and you decide to put your fudge-sharp skills to work on my car for a third grade CD flap and Big Shiny Tunes 3?   No wonder you people have such tragic backgrounds and family histories. It takes a real bloodline of idiocy to breed the fine specimens involved in this crime of the past twenty-four hours. Next time you wanna commit a heinous crime and you really wanna traumatize the victims, wrap their favorite coat around your head and defecate it with a large caliber bullet hole, you retarded semenal fungus. I throw out shit with more face value than what you stole every Thursday. But I guess digging through my trash would indignify your noble fucking profession.   God help us all if you ever chose to breed with anything other than yourself.

       The first of a weekly philosophical, social, or cultural quote that might get your brain coiling a bit.  Since the Lord of the Rings movie trilogy, I haven't heard any mothers proclaiming Dungeons and Dragons to be cult-like or satanic.

       For the past two weeks, I've been fighting a tug-of-war battle against a brutal form of adware I picked up off of Kazaa. I hurled adware removal programs at it, it hijacked my homepage and destroyed my ability to access my email account. I removed dozens of adware-infected programs and reinstalled them, I burned Kazaa to a crisp and danced on its bones.  In the end, nothing worked. Like an insideous cancer, the adware and other programs it brought with it eventually partied all the way into my core, so that opening up a non-internet program brought about a flurry of annoying pop-up's, ironically, 90% of them involved "Spyware detected! Download anti-spyware programs here!" bullshite. I even got pop-up's opening my goddamned word processor.  Which of course brought me to the obvious conclusion. A large number of people creating anti-spyware programs are the useless stockpiles of weapon's grade douche-baggery that are sending my computer spyware.  Why can't I get a government grant and $10,000 worth of computer equipment armed with the latest anti-digital terrorism equipment and commence to unleash the backside of my fist on the collective jaws of these A1 motherfuckers? You hear about how hard it is for the police and all these people to track internet crimes - Christ, they happen to us common folk all the time. Give citizens the software they need to track these jerkwads through their three hundred plus bounced websites back to their source and then slap their ass with a warrent for their immediate display in public where the crowd can hurl spoiled tomatoes and spyware-clogged motherboards at their pasty, never-touched-a-girl, pimpley, small genitalia'ed carcasses.  Anyways. I lost my battle against the spyware, and standing on the precipice, staring into the abyss, I brought out the keys to my doomsday weapon and wiped my hard-drive clean, cursing as I watched all of my work go up in flames, with over 99% of it so surrounded and covered with spyware that I could never copy it onto a disk for fear of infecting future generations.  So I'm left with about 1% of what I had. Of all the wonderful heaps of personal BS that I've built up, I could only save a few sentimental pictures drawn for me and one or two of my own written works.  Well. Fresh beginnings. It'd better damn well be.
