       The prayer of a righteous man is powerful and effective.  James 5:16  What's going on in your life right now?  Is there anything that you would like for us to join you in praying about? I think we have an incredible opportunity through our small groups and as a youth ministry and body of believers in Christ to love and support each other through prayer.  So use this post to add any specific things for which we could be praying for you.  But remember...this isn't a place for gossip...please use good judgment and don't include names of friends. God definitely hears our prayers, and He is honored when we seek Him with our whole hearts.  Together we can love Him through committing to pray for each other.

       Life Together   So, what was the thing that most stuck out to you about your discussions tonight?  What was the best question that was asked of you?  What is the purpose of life?  And, what do you think Jesus was trying to say by answering the question, "what is the greatest commandment," the way that he did?  Talk amongst yourselves......

       Going deeper   Ok, I'm going to go out on a limb here. Let me say this upfront:   THIS IS NOT FOR EVERYONE.  Are you interested in things that no one else seems to be interested in. Do you like to read challenging books, discuss theology and/or philosophy, and stare at the wall in deep thought for hours on end.  I DO!!!  I'm throwing down the gauntlet. If you're interested, I'll pick a book with you (singular or plural) or I'll just meet with you and a group for coffee. You can respond to me here, in person, or by email....if you dare.  One final note: unless you are prepared to do a little extra homework and/or to discuss challenging ideas, this is not for you.  Let me know what you think.

       My Computer   Praise the Lord!!!  What, you ask, is the meaning behind this exclamation of praise? My computer had a minor crash (is that the correct term?) the other day and I have been cyper crippled. I'm back though, and better than ever! (Drama)  Renee, I have seen your requests for new topics and I will answer. My desire is to post one or two questions onto this Blog that come up in our Mid-week homegroup time. I may also add an additional question if one arises during the Sunday service.  So, keep me accountable. If you're looking for the question after tonight, and you cannot find it, keep demanding!!!  (Disclaimer: sometimes when I post from home, it takes several hours for the post to show up online)  :)

       Nicknames   I was thinking. Chris has a really cool nickname. You probably don't even remember that his name is Chris. Just in case you don't know, Chris is Happy. See, the nickname worked.  Why don't you guys use this post to come up with a good nickname for Blakely and a good nickname for Marshall. A really good one. One that will stick!  Happy commenting!!!

       Tonight......   I just pulled the site up to check it, and I am so excited to see everyone using it already. Wow! Everytime I refresh the page there are more comments. I can't stop smiling about it.  By the way....I'm really feeling good about small groups this semester. I enjoyed the time with the guys tonight and am excited about seeing all of our groups form more of a bond. I think it's going to be a lot of fun.  What do you think? Let me know how your group went and what your hopes are about the coming semester. I want to read some good stuff! :)  Also, I was so encouraged by Disciple-Now. My prayer is that God has begun a good work in us that he will be faithful to complete.  I love you guys! Keep on Blogging!!!  Jason

       Wednesday Morning   I just want to remind all of you that tonight our Home groups begin. If you're a Jr. High girl, you'll meet at the Anderson's, a High School girl, the Hudson's, a Jr. High boy, the Herndon's, and a High School boy, the Cain-Doloway's.  One of the purposes behind these small groups is to facilitate the opportunity for you to experience real, transformative Christian community.  I'm interested. Where do you feel like you experience real community in your life? Or, have you ever experienced this? And....do you feel that this is or isn't a need that you have (to have this kind of community in your life). Please comment.

       Interesting Links   When I am pointed towards a website or a book that might be worth checking out, I will try and create a link for you on this site. A friend of mine has pointed me to "Relevant Magazine." It looks to be a quality site/magazine that may provide some interesting reading for some of you. Take a look and let me know what you think.   Interesting Links, Part II   I have also added a link to "Compassion International." "Compassion" is an amazing ministry that another friend pointed me to about a year and a half ago. Since then I have been sponsoring a child named Sirinya from Thailand. If you have some time, take a look at this ministry. It may be something God leads you to one day. Remember though, it is a commitment, so as long as you're still living with your parents, you should probably talk to them before you do anything.   Interesting Links, Part III   a few more intersting links   I have also added a link the the "Voice of the martyrs" homepage and the "Mission Waco" homepage.   I will probably let all other links that I add speak for themselves.....probably:).  So, the invitation remains, check out the sites, read the blogs, respond with your comments.

        If at first you don't succeed....   Sometimes when I log onto this site the "comments" section doesn't appear under the posts. I've found that if I close the site and log onto it again the "comments" will often appear. All this to say.....if they don't appear the first time, try, try, again.

       AN INVITATION.....   If you've arrived at this site and are currently reading these words, chances are it's because you came by invitation. (I.E. You read my email:)  My hope is that this site will initiate the beginning of many conversations. Some may be biblical or spiritual conversations, some may be questions about dating or homework, and some posts may simply be one of us saying hello to another one of us.  Feel free to respond to my entries with whatever thoughts you might have. I'll try to offer at least an entry a week if this seems to be something that you enjoy.   To help this along, let me know things that you would like to discuss. Maybe I can then respond to you. Then someone can respond to me, and then we have an online conversation.  I hope you all are having a wonderful day off and are recovering well from our Disciple-Now weekend.  God bless,  Jason

       IN THE BEGINNING....   Periodically I enjoy the beauty that can come in a moment of real transparency. Rarely does this happen with witnesses. Though I'm not very consistent in the discipline of journaling, it often happens between myself and a few pieces of scrap paper. It's amazing how therapeutic a pen and paper can be.  I hope that this online journal will serve as an opportunity to share. Let it be a vehicle for your own personal expression. Not that we would find our community with one another in this forum, but that this forum could be the beginning of meaningful conversations beyond it.   So go ahead, share your heart and share your thoughts. Engage each other. Just remember, to do it in the spirit of Christian Love. :)

         Example Basket   Everyone please remember to get your baskets together this week for the Basket Auction that we will have at the All-Church Fellowship on March 7th. Either bring your completed baskets by this week, on Sunday, or bring the Basket or the materials to make the basket to "The Gathering" this Sunday evening. We will take some time to put them together there.  Remember, the items are to be things that you own or things that have been donated. The object is to raise money, not to spend it!

      After meeting with Laura, Alison, Laura Madeline, and Blakely tonight I was reminded of a journal entry that I made a few weeks ago. I thought I'd share it here. I hope that all of you will feel free to respond, but am particularly interested in the thoughts of those participating in the book study. Below is my entry.   The Iambic Pentameter    My spiritual director raised an interesting question on Thursday. “Do we choose our theology, or does our theology choose us.” As one reflects upon his or her theological pilgrimage, how do the places one has arrived theologically coincide with other areas of that person’s pilgrimage?   At the age of twenty my theology found a transient home. As I reflected upon my story and the story of scripture, what my heart began to scream theologically looked very much like Calvinism. I did not know what it meant to be a Calvinist. I had never read John Calvin. And yet, when I expressed to my Marshall Texas pastor what, at the time, seemed to be new heretical findings, he identified me as a Calvinist.  “As you reflect upon yourself, as a twenty year old college student, what do you think would have been attractive to you about these theological leanings?”   How much has our life affected our theology? More than we know. The thinking person’s response to this is, “of course it has.” And again I say, “More than you know.”  Thoughts like this used to send me into an emotional and theological tailspin. Not now. Is this because I don’t care? No. I do care. Theology is important to me. Theology is more than just a class; it is part of pursuing God. Theology matters to me.  The difference is in my approach. As a twenty year old college student I saw theology as an equation. As a twenty six year old seminary graduate, I’ve grown comfortable with seeing it on a canvas.  Perhaps this is an effect of studying under Roger Olson for three years. Perhaps it is because I’ve been taught that theology is more story than system. Perhaps it is because this perspective eases the turmoil of my dissonance. Perhaps.   I have not abandoned truth. Isn’t that supposed to be the tenet of the post-modern? No more absolute truth? Truth comes in art and in calculus, in the museum as well as the bank. It’s in poetry, prose, paintings, facts, figures, and finances. It’s in the geometry of the coliseum, and in the vision of the Mona Lisa. It’s in the mixture of the perfect vaccine, and in the eyes of the young child it saves.  One might say that the poet can never appreciate the mathematician. I have learned too much about the systems and rhythms of the sonnet to believe that. The best poets learn to create by equation.   And mathematicians can find their heart in a museum.  What do you think?

      The following was also sent to you in email form. Please be at this meeting:    "Our first training session for the High School Mission Trip will be this Sunday, February 22nd, after church (about 12:15) in the youth room.  At this meeting we will pray for our trip and those we will be ministering to. We will also assign roles for our Mission Team, and inform you of the responsibilities for those roles.     You will recieve a copy of the tentative 8:30 am to 6:00 p.m schedule we will be following during our week, a registration form, and a copy of the training material that you'll need to prepare for the trip. Mission Arlington just completed this material and shipped it to us. This means that we will have as much or more training time than any of the other teams who will be coming to Arlington that week.   I will have pizza delivered for our lunch. Please bring a 1 or 2 dollar donation for the pizza and drinks.      I appreciate your desire to serve in this way. Please recieve this as notice of a MANDATORY meeting. To be adequately prepared, we must begin NOW.   I'll see you all very soon! "

       Superman   If you were to look closely at one of my preschool pictures, you would notice that underneath the plaid, button-up, western style shirt that I am wearing, there is a light blue T. The casual observer might not find anything unusual about a young man with an undershirt, but ah….with a little imagination and a lot of squinting one may begin to see traces of a red, yellow, and blue seal on my chest. You see, from a very young age, I believed myself to be SUPERMAN!     As a young lad it was difficult to keep my identity under wraps. How can a child with wings not use them to fly? Consequently, I could be found soaring around my Grandmommy’s house, showing off my right bicep to anyone who would look my way. I was amusing and annoying I’m sure.   My beloved wife inaugurated the advent of my twenty-seventh year by throwing me a superman party. Among my gifts were DVD’s, superhero ornaments, a superhero cookie cake, and a brand new Superman T-shirt. She did this for obvious reasons. You see, I am Superman…..again.     Warner Brothers released a new T.V show a few years ago that rekindled my love of the Superman story. Smallville focuses on The Man of Steel's early years. One finds Clark Kent, not in Metropolis, but in a small farm town. He’s not yet in tights, but is growing up, struggling with adolescence, and trying to find his identity.      Strangely enough, as a three and four year old child, I found myself captivated by the thirty-year-old invincible man in tights, who flew around Metropolis saving the world from its most evil villains. But as a twenty-six year old man with a master’s degree, I am fascinated with the boy Kent. It’s his story that fills my heart with hope every Wednesday night at 9:00.  That last sentence just might disturb some of you. “Clark Kent fills your heart with hope?!?” What about Jesus?” Walk with me a moment. As young children we need super heroes. We want to believe that they exist and more importantly, that we could be one. They are beyond human.   Every morning as I look in the mirror, my humanity stares back at me. My hair is turning grey, my waistline can’t handle afternoon nachos anymore, and facial lines are beginning to form. Moreover, I am inwardly normal. If you were to open up the fleshly shell and peer deep into my soul, you would see only the ordinary. I am a man. There was a point in time when that reality seeped into me. At another point I began to embrace it. I count the latter point among the most profoundly transformative of my life.  (Back to the Farm)      In almost every episode, Clark Kent discovers something new about himself, something that most of us already knew. He can’t be hurt? He can see through walls? He can leap tall buildings in a single bound? Big deal – He’s Superman! The real story: He struggles with his parents. He breaks into a cold sweat every time he tries to share his feelings with Lana. He fights with his friends. He fails. He doesn’t know who he is, and what he does know, he can’t really share with anyone. He is trapped by his own giftedness. He is so much more than anyone knows, and so much less than anyone thinks. Clark Kent is my hero.  This is really the end of my thought, but I think that somehow, this thought shadows some of my feelings about Jesus. As I steadily approach my thirties, it comforts and inspires me to think of Jesus as human. I do not deny his divinity. I would never attempt to say that Clark Kent was not at the same time Superman, but again, what I'm finding more and more profound, is that Superman was always at the same time Clark Kent. He really can identify. I can more than admire him, I can befriend him. There’s something very beautiful about that.

       A New Kind of Christian (Reading Group)      This evening, over salsa, chips, and various other food items at "Chili's Too," five of us decided to begin reading Brian McLaren's book, "A New Kind of Christian." McLaren puts his book in the genre of "creative non-fiction." The book is a dialogue between two friends discussing what it means to be "Christian" in this postmodern world.     The plan is to meet every other week at Chilis, Starbucks, or another restaurant of our choosing to discuss what we've been reading. The group will meet at 5:30, every other Monday. If you would like to be a part of this group, please 1) buy the book soon, 2) read the introduction and chapter one, 3) write 3 questions from each section of your reading, and 4) show up in two weeks.   This week   The small groups have been an amazing blessing so far this semester. I hope you will commit to be a part of the wonderful Wednesday night opportunity.  Please note on your calendars that "The Gathering" will not take place this coming Sunday evening. "The Gathering" will resume its discussion on "The Mask" in two weeks.       Last Night   Last night's discussion at "The Gathering" engaged us in some important and powerful issues. Jodi's comments in the previous blog are a testimony to this. Please feel free to share here any further thoughts any of you have had.  I do appreciate you all being willing to be vulnerable last night. I pray this continues to happen everytime we gather together.

       The Movement of God   I am in awe at how God can move in the midst of something like our small groups on Wednesday night. In the midst of each response, I see the movement of God-I see answers to prayer.  As you move towards each Wednesday together, I encourage you to pray for your group. Pray specifically. Pray fervently. You might be suprised by what happens.  I'd like for some of you to share with us some things reflective of where you are in your spiritual journey. What's happening between you and God right now? What are some significant touches have you experienced recently from our Heavenly Father?   In the coming week...   I hope to see you Sunday morning, but also on Sunday Night. Don't forget about "The Gathering." It's at 6:30 in the Activities Center.  Also, for those of you interested in jumping in on our reading group, we will be meeting at 4:30 on Monday. The place and book will be specified tomorrow. As of now, I'm thinking we'll be reading "A New Kind of Christian," by Brian McLaren, and meeting this week at either Starbucks Baylor, or at our new Krispy Kreme. The choice lies in your hands.....   See you soon!

         You asked and it will be delivered. This Wednesday night, at the High School Small Groups you will be given a permission slip that must be signed by your parents and returned to me. If it is, then the High School groups will be seeing "THE PASSION" during our small group time on Wednesday, March 10th. This will be a powerful and meaningful experience for our groups. Even if you've already seen the movie, please plan on participating in this time.   BRING YOUR BASKETS AND YOURSELVES!     This Sunday night, at 6:15, in the fellowship hall we will have an all-church fellowship. At this fellowship we will auction off our theme baskets to raise money for youth camp. I need your baskets ASAP if you have yet to turn them in to me. I also need you to be at the fellowship to help work the auction table and to pass out information about our fundraiser. Thanks for your help!!!   Small Groups Tonight   Know that I am praying for each one of your small groups tonight. Please prioritize this as part of your evening. God is working in the midst of these groups. Believe in his power to transform you and to speak into your life. And, bring a friend!!!

      I can’t take the pressure! Someone has asked me to write an article on “Prayer.” I’ve spent the past few weeks taking moments to remember and record my experiences with the subject. I’ve tried to lay it down, smooth it out and put it together. This has to be one of the most frustrating things I’ve ever done. How does one write something about prayer? The real question: How does one write something “impressive” about prayer? Ah…there’s the rub. The task is to be profound. The task is to be proficient. The task is to be professional. It occurs to me that this is the problem. This is the problem with writing. This is the problem with prayer.  In his book “On Writing,” Stephen King says that one should never write to be published. One should write, to write. King believes that every story exists. The task of the storyteller is to excavate the story, not to create it. If one attempts to create something to be consumed, one's creation will never merit real consumption.  I don’t remember the first time that I prayed to God. Like many aspects of my Christian faith, it’s hard to remember a time when “prayer” of some kind was not a part of my life. I remember being afraid. I’ve spent most of my life afraid.   I used to have these crazy dreams about bears. Not Montana mountain bears or even Baylor University bears, but vicious cartoon bears. They were hiding in my closet at bedtime, they were looking through my window at midnight, and they were running down stairs, chasing me with water pails in my most terrible nightmares.   When I was five, my neighbor Greg caught wind of my bear troubles. Greg was my elder. He was six and had seen more life than me. Consequently, when Greg spoke, I listened. He had a secret weapon for warding off the night-time demons: Prayer. Greg said that if I would ask God to stop the night mares, then they would certainly cease. That night I prayed for no more bears, and that night, the bears were no more.  In times of immense childhood rebellion my mother knew that one phrase would bring me to my knees. “Jason, do you want me to tell Santa Clause what you just did?” “Sweet Lord, No! Don’t tell him…anyone but him!” I can remember lying awake each Christmas Eve……terrified! “Please, Father, let Santa Clause come here tonight!” Had I been good enough? Did I believe enough? If I was bad or if I didn’t believe, Santa would not come. I prayed with passion. I prayed with fear.   When I was three years old someone told me that if I prayed and really believed, God would answer. I prayed for snow. I could think of nothing that I wanted more. This would be my miracle. The next day, in the midst of pre-school playtime, it snowed. Pre-school was cancelled, snow men were built, and sleds were pulled. It was official: God was in his heaven, and all was good on earth.   It’s been twenty-three years since that early prayer experience, and it’s never happened quite the same way.  I’ve speculated a thousand times on it, but after seven years of theological training, all that I know for sure is that I prayed for snow that day, and on that day, it snowed.   My grandfather is 82 years old and no one has ever heard him pray aloud. Not his pastor. Not his daughters. Not his wife.   A few weeks ago Christy and I visited my home town. Upon leaving I decided to ask Daddy Troy a few questions. "Daddy Troy, do you pray?" “Everyday,” he said. “I pray before I go to bed that God would help me to make it through the night.” "Do you pray in the morning?" “I try, but sometimes I forget.” “Do you pray much during the day?” “Oh Yes. Mostly I ask for help.”  I have never heard him speak to God. I always thought this was because he was an inward man-maybe even a little frightened of public speaking, but in this moment together, my grandfather shared something new.  Daddy Troy quoted scripture. “The one about not praying like the hypocrites. I do enjoy listening to public prayer....as long as they keep 'em short.” “Is this because long prayers bore you,” I asked.  “No, it’s because of  the scripture,” he said.  “God already knows what you need. So keep it short and keep it silent." Wow.   There’s nothing profound about these prayers. I’ve spent my life learning to pray like the hypocrite. I’m so tired of being the professional.   I remember the child who lifted up whispers every night from a twin sized bed under Charlie Brown sheets. “Now I lay me down to sleep, I pray the Lord my soul to keep, and if I die before I wake, I pray the Lord my soul to take. And please help me not to have bad dreams tonight. Amen”   Lord, teach me to pray like the child who wanted to see snow. Father, instill in me the profundity of an old man asking for help.

      After a long draught of information on the FBC WACO YOUTH BLOG, it is alas time to resuscitate. If you have any news or articles that you would like to post on the blog, please send them to me, I'll look them over, and would be glad to post them for comments.  For the moment, I'd like to bring you guys up to speed on a key article of news that greatly affects our church and youth body.   It is a fact that our current minister of education, Mr. Don Cannata, has been with us and left us multiple times in past years. What is unknown is exactly what he's been doing during his off periods. Well, through much investigation by the committee on committees, it has been discovered that Don Cannata, while absent from first Baptist church, has been patrolling the streets and fighting crime.   Yes students, by day he is Don Cannata, mild mannered education minister.   Was not available for picture    mysteriously   And by night.......    If you know of any other strange occurrences such as this, do tell.

      So far the poll results have been overwhelmingly in favor of a belief that "hell" is "eternal separation from God." But what does that mean? I've heard people say this my whole life, but have no idea what it's supposed to look like. Do unbelievers sit in a dark, round, rubber room for all of eternity while the party goes on next door? Give me your thoughts on this. Basically, I want you to give me a detailed description of what you think hell is like. Be creative and free with your ideas.

      So far it looks like Chris Watkins nickname should be "Rumplestilkskin," by one vote. Who knew? We've been mistakenly calling him Happy all year!

      In one of our Monday Reading Groups Laura Madeline mentioned that she has a friend who doesn't believe in Hell. My response, "A lot of people don't believe in Hell anymore Laura Madeline." I then put on my raging liberal "hat" and for a moment became known to the girls in that group as "hypothetical J."   What's the point?  What do you believe about Hell? Is it a real place? What is it like? Why would someone go there, and if they did, would they be there forever. Take this and run with it.  AND  Have you heard or had any other thoughts about life or God that seem a little "out there" that you would like to discuss?

        Psalm 42    “As the deer pants for streams of water, so my soul pants for you, O God.” I love this image: just as the deer groans for streams; likewise, my inward being, my very person, gasps for God. What does it mean to pant? I picture someone empty, out of breath, parched to completion, crawling across the desert. That’s where David was when he wrote this.  Burning brush, wilted trees, dusty wind, and starving animals surround him. In the distance, David spies a deer, dehydrated; searching for sustenance. There was none to be found. David’s concern wasn’t for water. God seemed distant, dead. David was dry. He was thirsty. He needed a drink, but there was no stream in sight.   There is no resolution in Psalm 42; God never shows his face. David is left alone in the desert. His enemies chase him. They mocked his faith. He pleads for a sign; some reassurance of the divine reality.   I have been to this place. In some ways, I’ve made it my home. It’s not that God has left this land. He simply speaks a different language here. And so, as David did, I  will praise him. “Why are you downcast, O my soul? Why so disturbed within me? Put your hope in God, for I will yet praise him, my Savior and my God.” Eventually one moves past culture shock. The desert becomes home and the language becomes familiar. As the abnormal becomes normal, the land begins to change. Flowers spring forth, streams flow and forests grow. Slowly I realize that this land is even more lush than that from whence I came. I didn’t lose my faith or my God. He is the reason that I am here.   Our creator is also our guide. Nomads never feel normal, because nomads are never really home.     God thank you for guiding me into this place. Help me to recognize you in the midst of each day. Continue to guide me. Help me to follow. If I have wondered away, I pray that you will leave the 99, place me upon your shoulders, and bring me back home. You are my home.

      Ok, here's a short one for you guys. We talked about this a few weeks ago in our reading group.  What MUST one believe to be "Christian?" What is essential? What qualifies and what disqualifies?

      Someone named "Anonymous" posed 2 interesting questions in the post below on Hell. I left my comments, but instead of leaving them there decided to cut and past these thoughts into a post to see if any of you had anything (thoughts or questions) to add.  I'm interested in your ideas.  Here's what's there so far:  Anonymous said...  First, if God is not in Hell, is He omnipresent?  Second, who does the punishment in Hell if not God?  6:34 PM   The Youth Guy said...  Well, anonymous, I probably can't answer your question, but I can offer a few thoughts.  Augustine believed that all things came from God and that all things God created were good, therefore, the opposite of good is not evil, but the opposite of good is nothing. What if hell is simply a place where there is more nothing than anything...a lifeless place. If God is truly our source, then this would create a whole different form of torment. Conversely, if something exists at all, it must be somewhat good. (ie. Hell, Satan, demons, etc.) (I'm not saying this is what I believe, just a thought)  5:18 AM   The Youth Guy said...  Secondly, I guess if God is not in Hell, then he is not omni present, but maybe is presence does extend there, maybe hell is different than we think. John Wesley (I think) said that in Calvin's theology, the devil is "God's devil." Meaning that Calvin's view of God' sovereignty necessitated God being the source of Satan's work-to some degree. I'm not quite comfortable with this, but maybe.  5:22 AM   The Youth Guy said...  I would also like to suggest a look at the parable of the weeds in Matthew. Jesus seems to suggest an "enemy" who puts things in the fold that are NOT from God. Further, in Matthew Jesus seems to himself believe in the existence of a place of torment. I don't want to be dualistic and say that there are some things that don't come from God (i.e. evil), but there does seem to be a distinction. I'm not sure how I feel about calling it "nothing," but I am at least comfortable with calling all things evil "corruption." The question then is, is hell itself, EVIL?  5:27 AM   The Youth Guy said...  "Who does the punishment in hell if not God?" I think it would be interesting to discuss, "What is punishment in Hell." This might help me with this question. I'm thinking its not a red guy with horns and a pitch fork. Just a guess.  I am intrigued by two things in this matter: 1. The Catholic idea of purging. 2. Anhialationism (Spelling?)

      A few of us met today and hashed out the details for our Tuesday reading group. We adjusted the "syllabus" and set our goal high.  So, if you're interested in being a part of this group:  1. Go buy "The Lion, The witch, and the Wardrobe." 2. Find a pad or folder or notebook that you can use as a reading journal (For questions, insights, research, etc) 3. Do a little background research on C.S Lewis and the Narnia books (The internet is handy) 4. AND....read the book, the entire book, before we meet to discuss it in 2 weeks. (Tuesday, June 29th, at 3:30, in my apartment)   We not only want to discuss the story, but the images and symbols within the story and what we think they could be pointing to.   Happy Reading!!!

      Just for Grins, check this site out and let me know how you score:  http://selectsmart.com/FREE/select.php?client=christiandenom  It ranks where you fit denominationally based on your beliefs. (Actually, based on your answers to a few of their questions)  Strangely, Southern Baptist was #10 on my list. My top 3 were:  1. Wesleyan/ Methodist 2. Episcopal/ Anglican 3. Evangelical Lutheran  Hmmm....Curious?

      Last Thursday we enjoyed the pleasure of playing with and teaching many of the children of South Terrace apartments.   Every Thursday this summer, a group of us will go into their world, hang with them, play with them, sing with them, and attempt to share the gospel of Jesus Christ with them through our words and through our lives.  If you or your friends would like to serve these children, please meet at the church on Thursday (any and every Thursday) at 12:45. And if you would like to lead in any specific way (crafts, memory verses, teaching, singing, puppets, games, etc), let me know that as well.  Thanks!!!

         So, let's make it official...  Who is intersted in a Tuesday afternoon reading group (in my apartment) centering around C.S Lewis' narnia story "The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe."  These books are being republished for mass production and the publishers are removing as many Christian references as possible. This has caused some controversy.  I'm not sure when the new editions will come out, but let's do our best to find some of original publications for our purposes.

      This morning I awoke, got ready for the day, and said goodbye to Christy on my way from the Walker's house (we're housesitting this week) to the church.  Mysteriously, Christy wanted to walk me to the door. She never wants to walk me to the door. She usually says good bye from bed. (She's not really a morning person)  Little did I know....she had insider informations.  The windows on my jeep had been shoe-polished....AGAIN!     It was Blakely's last night. She was staying at Laura Madeline's house. Renee was with them when I left the youth party. I can't imagine who would have done this to me.....AGAIN!!!  So I'm curious. Will this stop now that Blakely has left us. I assume no. I will be revisited. The car wash will get more of my money.  I just have one request/ suggestion girls. If you're going to write on windows, get with the times! They're making this new stuff...just for windows. It doesn't leave the lasting negative affects of shoe polish, it's easier to remove (I think), AND IT's COLORFUL.  Happy Pranking!

      Welcome Back! This is to me, to you, and to anyone else that is reading. &nbsp; Camp was great. The teaching was poignant- it really hit the mark for us. Still, as Brian pointed out, it was more amazing to see you guys living out real "Christ Community" during our final church group time. The vulnerability, the compassion, and the sharing of love from one to another was overwhelming. For the first time, we were truly sharing "life together," or at least it was the first time this was abundantly clear&nbsp;to me. Thanks for letting me be apart of it. &nbsp; For those who are interested, some of us have decided to read C.S Lewis' "The Great Divorce" together. Let me know if you're interested in doing this with us. We will meet a couple of times in the near future to discuss our readings.  &nbsp; I've already read the book and it has some exceptional insights. Well done C.S! (That's my plug) &nbsp; I hope all is well. Let's enjoy the rest of this summer together!
