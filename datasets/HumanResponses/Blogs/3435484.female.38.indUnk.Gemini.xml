      Well if you haven't heard we've had some rain.  So much so that the river that goes through our county is flooding just about every major street there is in town.  What a mess.  Getting to work has been pretty interesting.  The other day I had to go into Wisconsin and then back to Illinois just to get to work.  A 20 min ride now takes almost 2 hours.  Have I mentioned what a mess this has created.    anyway...So this is me now.  And forever I think cuz this to me is easy and very cool.  Also has a spell check and its free.  nuff said.  heh heh...I just did a spell check....Tee hee.    I'm so easily amused.  anywho....Work is busy, my wrist hurts, my birthday is in 2 weeks, school is over tomorrow and now Sarah has a babysitting job...Go Sarah make that money!! And American Idol is just about over.  Go Fantasia!!  that's its for now...Let me know how you like me now...I HAVE COMMENTS NOW....WOO HOOOO!!!  Please be gentle.  love & hugs, Jeannine

      I should never start a post and not finish it.  I realized now that its been a while since that last one and now it doesn't even seem worth finishing anymore...LOL.  Long story short....I got over it and things are ok.  2 more day and were moving.  yayayayayay  I can't wait!  Were finishing up the painting today and Saturday the movers (3 stockmen from wal-mart) are going to move my stuff.  My apartment is a wreck.  You never really know just how much stuff you have until you move.  I just want to trash everything and start over.   but I'm not  so please forgive me for not updating daily.  Trust me when I get up and running...This is be my home away from home again.  I miss journaling.  hugs, jeannine

      I've spent the better of 2 weeks doing nothing but packing and painting.  Ill have pics up when I unpack that box, but for the most part...Its looking really good.  Did some sponging in the living room and Sarah room, my room isn't finished yet. Today we sanded (I say we...HA!!! That's a joke)another story, another time)...Anyway....I sanded the walls today and primed them, this week I'm getting the paint and I'm hoping the ceiling tile will be put in too so that will complete everything.  I'm going with some bold colors too to that room.  Gold's and purples, greens and dark reds....I'm hoping  it will look nice.  I've seen pictures of it and it looks nice in the pics.  So we'll see.  you know...I have time...Going to vent here folks....  yesterday (Saturday) Sarah was upset because we put down the floor tile without her.  She had to work....I didn't, so my roomy and I did it.  I can understand her disappointment, but we got the tile and we wanted it done and I didn't want to wait.  So we did it.  Her complaint was that on the weekends we sleep really late and she never gets to do anything because she has to work on weekends.  Understandable....So today...Sunday...We got up at 6 am.  was at Wal-Mart by 7:15am to get the sander and primer paint, then we shot over to Menards to get another box of floor tile and then panera bread for some bagels.  We were at the house by 9am where my roomie was busy doing her Sunday morning stuff waiting for the bagels.  they were yummy.  after breakfast we go downstairs and sarah for the first time sees the floor and loved it.  my bedroom has stuff/garbage that needed to be taken out and so I put sarah on that while my roomie and I got busy with the floor tile.  (shes limber and can do the floor stuff....I handed her the tile.  exhausting I tell ya) so Sarah doing her thing...were doing our thing...everything is groovy and then I see sarah standing at the doorway watching us.  one of her things to do was scrape up the stucco that got on the floor......she did one spot and stopped to watch us.  my patience is now wearing quite thin and I made her aware of this.  So she went back to work.  5 minutes later...standing at the door watching us.  now I'm pissed.  So I start to hand her the tiles that I'm holding so that I can finish what she started cuz my patience is now gone.....and she got the hint and went back to work.    so the floor is done and looks really great and now I start to sand the walls.  dust everywhere.  So of course now she can't be in the room, has a headache and sits down.    then falls asleep.  for about an hour.  I finished sanding and woke her up and asked her if she could put on a load of laundry....she does, then proceeds to help me paint the walls with the primer.  so were making progress...shes working on a wall...I'm on my second....decided....I'm thirsty.  so I go upstairs get a drink, washed my face and hands cuz I'm covered in dust that I can taste it....I decided to go sit outside on the steps and enjoy the breeze with my water.   ten minutes later I go to the kitchen and eat the half of bagel that I left from breakfast and went back downstairs to get yelled at....."YOU COULD HAVE MADE ME ONE!!!"...I tell her its my half from breakfast and then ......   to be continued.....

      Busy weekend for me.  We've been up since about 9 am, ran out to run a bunch of errands.  I had to go to DMV to get my stickers renewed AND renew my drivers license since it expires on  MY BIRTHDAY  on  MONDAY . So that was done.  We then went to I-HOP for breakfast, which ended up being a birthday breakfast for me which was really nice.  Went to the grocery store, spent about $300 dollars to fill up my car, went home, and now doing laundry and packing.  Tomorrow we have a baby shower to go too.  I'm really looking forward to this move.  I can't wait.  So you know what this means right....All you people that personally know me....A new change of address, phone and email.  Sorry.  At least this one will be staying around for a while.  I've already cancelled my high speed and cable.  Trying to get everything done so that I won't have to move so much in one day.  I've been bringing boxes over little by little so that by the time I do move at the end of the month ill only have the furniture to do.  Were gonna be painting soon and I can't wait.  We've got some really great colors picked out and will be doing a lot of different accents to the walls.  Sponging, ragging, using bold colors.  Its going to be awesome.  My friend says that "I have a blank canvas"  I can do what I want.  Very cool.    work is going good.  I had to give an award yesterday for teacher of the year at a local high school and that was awesome.  I've never done anything like that before and it was a bit nerve racking but I wasn't alone..Just doing all the talking in front of the whole faculty staff.  It turned out really well and I didn't' make a complete fool of myself.  Even got a few laughs.  So that went well.  I'm a big fat cow and can't wait to get on the weight loss track again.  This move is going to help out a lot since my friend is on the program and goes to the gym and walks....Now I have someone to do it with.  She cooks too...All the good foods.  This is going to be awesome!!!  I have motivation again!!    ok..This was originally stolen from Elle by Bonnie and now I'm stealing it from  urlLink Bonnie , so here it goes......  1. Who are you? 2. Have we ever met? 3. Give me a nickname and explain why you picked it. 4. Describe me in one word. 5. What reminds you of me? 6. If you could give me anything, what would it be? 7. Ever wanted to tell me something but couldn't? 8. Are you going to put this on your weblog and see what I say about you?  Leave answers in the comments and let me know if you post this in your journal so I can talk about YOU.  Hugs, Jeannine

      Gosh...I finally get a program I like to use and everything goes to shit.  My monitor is dead.  Can you guess where I am now???  Ugh.....  here's some news....Were going to be moving soon.  I'm hoping by the end of the month.  Were going to sharing a house my friend dawn and her daughter.  Were gonna be basement dwellers...LOL...  she's finishing up her basement and as soon as its ready...Were movin in!!  I can't wait.  Were gonna share the house so I'm not stuck in the basement and now Sarah has someone close to her age to hang out with and do "girlie" things with so that will be good for her too.  Her last day of school was Friday and she's already bored.  She'll be getting her license in a couple of weeks, she's already scored a babysitting job a few days a week, and she changed positions at walmart too.  She hated shoes and now moving to jewelry.  she's lovin it!!   so things are lookin up I must say.  The move will be really good for me cuz my living expenses will be pretty much cut in half and ill have a chance to really catch up on my bills and debts.  I'm really looking forward to it.  Sarah too since now she will have her own room to decorate (pink) and she's driving me crazy with paint samples.  LOL     I love it  work is good.  Getting busier by the week.  The rain has stopped some but there is still a lot of flooding.  On Saturday I'm going to volunteer to help some people out in the towns that hit the hardest.  I must say....Our store really came through for them and donated about 50 grand worth of supplies and clothes for them.  We've been volunteering every weekend, its been really great.  other than that.....Life is good.  :o)  now to spell check!!  hugs, jeannine

      Several years ago (about 10 or 15 who knows) when I was living in Canada (Vancouver if you must know) I had this hobby. Beading. I would bead for hours and make all kinds of stuff. Necklaces, bracelets, rings, pins...You name it and I really enjoyed it until it became a job. I sold most of my pieces which was really cool and I liked the income I was getting but after a while it just wasn't fun anymore. Well after talking to a  urlLink  friend   ,  I now have a bug up my ass to do this again. I am such a Gemini. Once I get a thought in my head I have to have it NOW!! No baby steps for me man...Oh no. So today we went to a bead shop which was small but the only one around here, yesterday I was checking out the supplies that wal-mart has (which I get discount on..heh heh) and now I've spent the last 3 or 4 hours online getting all kinds of info and patterns and ideas.  I'm such a mess.  I did buy a loom kit today. I figure that if I can get through that without losing my mind....Then this might be a good idea and worth investing. Who knows..Maybe it can be a money maker for me since I love being creative and crafty. Who knows. Time will tell and ill be sure to keep you posted.  the fair is in town and were gonna check it out tomorrow. Should be fun. The roomie went today and said it was good so were gonna check it out tomorrow. Its so quiet in the house right now. Nobody is home but me. I can run around naked if I wanted too however I won't be doing that.  work really pissed me off yesterday. I didn't' want to be there at all. Sometimes that place gets to me. Were trying to raise some money for an associate who has cancer and has been in the hospital all week last week and hasn't been well enough to make it to work cuz the chemo is really kicking her ass. She doesn't have insurance and her doctors are not helping her at all and She's one of the nicest people you ever want to meet, so we were trying to come up with fund raisers to help her out. Well...One of the things were trying to do is wear shorts for a week (this is against policy but can do for a special reason) for 2 bucks, have a bake sale, a pot luck, the usual things we do to raise money and walmart will match what we make. Well...Trying to get a manager to sit down for 5 minutes yesterday was nearly impossible and the store manager wasn't in and it was co-managers last day so he was really busy. However....I gave him the information in the morning and every hour I had to remind him and then I was like...fuck it....Told him I had to leave and I need an answer and he just said no. Bastard. What a prick. I really hate to say that about him cuz he's a really nice guy but damn......So now I have to do this all over again next week with the store manager and hope that he approves the shorts thing (cuz that is a big money maker. People will pay to wear some shorts at work...LOL). Its iffy cuz he's a "strict to policy" kinda guy so I'm not sure that will fly with him. We'll see...  My moms on the road again. Going to the Carolinas to check out some property. Crazy woman, gotta love her.  Well Sarah will be home in about an hour and i need to get off my ass cuz i promised her i would fold clothes and she will be very upset with me if she knew i was on the computer all night.  such fun....lol  at times im the kid and shes the adult around here....its really fun stuff people...you should try it.   ciao for now

          Howdy folks.   phew what a day!&nbsp; payday is always a hectic day in Wally world and it was exceptionally busy in my dept today.&nbsp; usually its not so crazy during the day but it seems that everyone took the day off and I'm really starting to feel my age.&nbsp; my days are fill will old age pain.&nbsp; its killing me!!!!&nbsp; I need to see a doctor.   anyway....Today after work the girls (Sarah & her friend) picked me up....(yes I gave her the car today and they went to the mall and shopped) it was very strange.&nbsp; we went to another store because I needed some pants and I got a couple of shirts and tennis shoes (sneakers) at walmart, and then we went to dinner.&nbsp; a buffet.&nbsp; can you say stuffed!!!!&nbsp; OMG...The food was so damn good and her friend can eat!!&nbsp; 6'4", 17 yrs old and I think she put away 4 plates of food then desert.&nbsp; this girl can eat.&nbsp; so of course I had to taste everything...Ugh.&nbsp; it was good.   so now I'm dead tired.&nbsp; so glad its Friday tomorrow.&nbsp; I did an overnight shift on Tuesday and I think that is why I'm out of it.&nbsp; I feel so damn old.&nbsp; really need to do something about this.&nbsp; NOW!!!&nbsp; damit.&nbsp;&nbsp; amp!!   so that's it for my little entry.&nbsp; HEYYYY...Did anyone watch Amish in the City last night???&nbsp; I thought that show was really good.&nbsp; I felt for the amish kids cuz they seemed to be the butt of every joke but when she cried when she went on the beach!!!&nbsp; OMG...I was in tears.&nbsp; I really liked it.&nbsp; it will be interesting to see the outcome of it.&nbsp; I have a feeling there are going to be lots of arguments like, "well this is how we do it in the real world" type of thing.&nbsp; we'll see.   have a good day!!  jeannine

      Work was cool.&nbsp; wasn't hectic, they actually kept the dept clean and organized and only one problem that was easy to solve so all in all the day went smooth.&nbsp; I did however get "talked too" because I'm to nice to associates who have layaways.&nbsp; seems that I give to many extensions for both customers and associates.&nbsp; a layaway is for 2 months.&nbsp; some of these people have had there layaways for almost 4 months.&nbsp; opps...My bad.&nbsp; my manager is cool and understands but policy is policy and I need to go by it.&nbsp; so that wasn't to cool.&nbsp; I hate it when they call me in to the managers office.&nbsp; it always makes me nervous.&nbsp; even though I don't do anything wrong (like stealing) it still creeps me out.&nbsp;&nbsp;   came home today and my 17 year old&nbsp;daughter and her 18 year old friend were playing with bratz dolls with my roomies 11 yr old daughter.&nbsp; they were having a good time too.&nbsp; LOL&nbsp; Sarah got her hair braided halfway up her head tonight.&nbsp; it looks&nbsp;pretty good too.&nbsp; she's been wanting to braid her hair (micro braids) for the longest time but we just&nbsp;never found anyone who could do it and now her friend can, so she's happy.   does this sound right to you??&nbsp; I've talked about how my one fish was nipping at&nbsp;my goldfish right.&nbsp; so to punish the bastard fish we got him his&nbsp;own tank.&nbsp;&nbsp; that to me doesn't&nbsp;sound like punishment to me!!&nbsp; anyway..The gold fish&nbsp;seems pretty happy about it and is coming out from hiding.&nbsp; hopefully the scales with grow back.&nbsp; poor thing.   we had a really nice dinner of stir fry with rice.&nbsp; I had rice and veggies for lunch and drank lots of water.&nbsp; I told the roomie that ill be joining curves soon so that we can work out together.&nbsp; most likely in the next 2 paychecks.&nbsp; my eating habits have gotten so much better, eating more structured meals and not to much late night eating so I'm happy about this.&nbsp; once I start to exercise, I'm hoping that my legs and body won't hurt so much.&nbsp; I'm really feeling my age.&nbsp;   I used to always say "I don't feel as big as I look".....Well now I do and I don't like it.&nbsp; so I'm back to taking baby steps and going forward once again on this weight loss journey.   wish me luck  Hugs, Jeannine   &nbsp;

      Late night TV is going to truly kill me.&nbsp; after watching all the TLC shows: &nbsp; urlLink TS ,  urlLink WYWO ,  urlLink IAF , and  urlLink WNTW  (though I have to say that TS was AWESOME last night.&nbsp; they upped the budget to 25 grand and it was a tear jerker moment for everyone folks.&nbsp; good stuff) that finally ended at 2am, I caught an episode of Showtime at the Apollo.&nbsp; now....As a teen I used to watch this show every weekend.&nbsp; it always came on after  urlLink SNL  which was my favorite show&nbsp;(back in the day when you had the original "not ready for prime time" players, when Eddie Murphy was a nobody, you get my point) and I was trying to figure out if this show was a repeat or not.&nbsp; Sinbad was the host.&nbsp; looked the same.&nbsp; that chick was still there.&nbsp; looked the same.&nbsp; that lady in the front row who was there every freaking weekend was still there.&nbsp; looked the same.&nbsp; but still not sure if it was a repeat or not.&nbsp; is that show still on??&nbsp;    so the musical guest comes on and Sarah and I are talking and we missed the name of the rapper that was on stage and the music is playing....Sounds familiar....Can't quite get it.....Then it clicks.&nbsp; this young man on stage wearing jeans, a timberland jacket (no shirt, with a six pack) and a hat that is covering most of his face, screaming on the top of his lungs...Is none other than...LL Cool J singing  Momma Gonna Knock You Out .&nbsp;&nbsp; I was just in shock.&nbsp; this is a grown man now.&nbsp; I felt so damn old at that moment it wasn't even funny.&nbsp; then to add insult to injury...I guessed the year to be 1991....And I was right.&nbsp; ugh   so after that show came on  urlLink Cheaters .&nbsp; I'm not sure if this was an old show or not I've never seen it before but one thing I have to say about that show.....It only proves just how stupid men are.&nbsp; now I'm not bashing all men cuz I know that not all men cheat...But the ones that do are making you all look really bad.&nbsp; this one chick had her husband watched and when she confronted him this is what he said...."What do you want me to say...I'm a man".&nbsp; I kid you not folks...That is what came out of his mouth.&nbsp; that's all I have to say about that.   I really need to expand my channel viewing.&nbsp; I'm missing some good shows.&nbsp; I never know what to watch cuz there is just so much to watch that its just so easy for me to go right to  urlLink TLC  or  urlLink E .   remember yesterday how sad I was about my cats...Well today I want them gone.&nbsp; they have been sooooo miserable today.&nbsp; and my fish too!!!&nbsp; I have this one Gurrami fish who is eating my big huge goldfish alive and so now I put him in another bowl to punish him.&nbsp; bastard.   I just made myself a nice salad with some chips and dip and to wash it all down....A beer.&nbsp; I'm doing laundry and trying to figure out why I have no sound on my computer which is really pissing me off.&nbsp; I've cleaned (woke up at 2pm), vacuumed and put&nbsp;up pictures so far this evening.....And now I'm here.   so my vacation is coming to&nbsp;an end and tomorrow its back to work.&nbsp; sure ill miss the late nights and waking up&nbsp;whenever I want, not having to get out of my pajamas unless I was going somewhere...Which&nbsp;was no where.....But I'm happy to be going back.&nbsp; I know that there have been lots of personnel changes.&nbsp; 2 of my managers have left the store to go to another supercenter that is opening up.&nbsp; one I was thinking about transferring too if it was closer (something I was supposed to check out&nbsp;this week since I had the time....Ah huh) but I'm not sure.&nbsp; I declined the personnel manager position cuz I'm really not ready to leave my dept yet.&nbsp; I love it there.&nbsp; its so&nbsp;busy and makes the day go by so fast and sitting behind a desk is just not what I want to do right now, so I withdrew my application.&nbsp; I really want to be support manager so that I can keep my&nbsp;dept and do support when I'm needed.&nbsp; so that is what I'm going&nbsp;to do.&nbsp; so it will be interesting to see what's going to happen to this store.&nbsp; I just hope the replacements are as good as the ones that have left.&nbsp; I really liked them and is a big part of my wanting to transfer to the other store that they are in.&nbsp; so we'll see.   ok well I think I've babbled enough....Have a good day!!  Hugs, Jeannine&nbsp;

      I had a feeling it would come to this but I didn't think it would be this soon.&nbsp; My cats are causing my roomies allergies to act up pretty bad.&nbsp; she can handle 1 or two, but 4 is too many.&nbsp; so Sarah was told today that she can have her dog here....But the cats have to go.&nbsp; its either one or the other.&nbsp; Sarah  LOVES  her dog and cried when she was told this cuz she was so happy.&nbsp; I can't tell you the months of her in depression cuz she misses her dog.&nbsp; so now he's coming back with her when she goes home for a family reunion.&nbsp; I didn't think I would be sad about this but losing Sophie makes me sad.&nbsp; all the rest can go....But I'm gonna miss my Sophie.&nbsp; she's my baby.&nbsp; but I can't have her if her allergies are going to be bad.&nbsp; so if anyone is looking for a pet..... urlLink I have a few available.    didn't do to much of anything today.&nbsp; roomie and I went to walmart to buy a lawn mover.&nbsp; that was about the most exciting thing.&nbsp; other than that....It was a pretty relaxing day.&nbsp; my vacation is winding down.&nbsp; Monday is back to work and frankly...I'm happy about that.&nbsp; I love my job and being home for a week is just plain boring.&nbsp; we did some things...Went to the zoo....But or that I could have taken the day off and been happy.&nbsp; I am fully rested though.&nbsp; I can say that.&nbsp; work keeps me active.&nbsp; being home I just sit around and watch TV.&nbsp; I did some painting last night.&nbsp; next weekend I'm going to finish painting the stairwell and hopefully soon we can finish putting up some drywall on the unfinished walls.&nbsp; (there are only two)   its quiet here tonight and I'm bored.&nbsp; hope you had a great weekend!  hugs, jeannine

      Yesterday we all went to  urlLink Brookfield Zoo  in Chicago and we had a great time.&nbsp; well I did anyway.&nbsp; I'm pretty sure everyone did.&nbsp; I really thought It was going to be really miserable for me cuz I've gained so much weight and my body is really feeling the strain that I didn't think I was going to be able to do it...But I did with no pain at all.&nbsp; the only problem I did have was with the heat but that is not a problem...It was hot out.&nbsp; everybody was sweating.&nbsp; we left around 8:30 am and left the zoo around 4.&nbsp; a lot of the attractions were indoors with air conditioning so that was nice.&nbsp; it was a really good day. Here are some pics....&nbsp;   urlLink     this little guy is actually hanging upside-down like so.&nbsp;   urlLink     Purdy Kitty&nbsp; urlLink      urlLink     white tigers&nbsp; urlLink      All of the animals were fantastic.&nbsp; the zoo itself was really nice.&nbsp; they had a dolphin show that was pretty cool too.&nbsp; I've noticed something about myself though.&nbsp; every time I go to a dolphin show.......I want to cry.&nbsp; don't ask me why but every time I go to a dolphin show&nbsp;I get this overwhelming feeling of joy and I want to just ball like a baby.&nbsp; thank god it was hot so when I wiped my face it just looked like I was wiping sweat and thank god no one was looking directly at me or else I would have been caught with red eyes.&nbsp; damn dolphins.....   the animals were pretty active and most of them were out and about which is great.&nbsp; I hate going to the zoo and they are all inside hiding.&nbsp; the gorillas were funny playing with each other.&nbsp; of course no pics of that...LOL...Here are some more...    urlLink     Some Penguins&nbsp; urlLink      urlLink     Blurry Elephant&nbsp; urlLink      urlLink     Giraffe&nbsp; urlLink      urlLink     The Bear&nbsp; urlLink      urlLink     Big Fish&nbsp; urlLink      urlLink     walrus swimming on its back&nbsp; urlLink      we didn't do anything today.&nbsp; Sarah and I had the house to ourselves since our roomie had to work (awwwww) and her daughter spent the day with relatives so Sarah and I watched TV all day.&nbsp; these reality shows.&nbsp; LOL&nbsp; E is becoming my new favorite channel.&nbsp; today we watch this reality show on Las Vegas showgirls and the horrible lives they lead.&nbsp; jeeze.&nbsp; but then they had this show called the abc of Angelina Jolie.&nbsp; basically they go through the alphabet and with each letter come up with something that has to do with Angelina.&nbsp; it was pretty funny.&nbsp; highlight of my day if you ask me.&nbsp; Cat Woman comes out this Friday and I will be there to see that movie.&nbsp; Halle (I can work a whip like no other) Barry......ooooo la la.&nbsp; must see entertainment.   its Wednesday and I have 4 more days left of my vacation and I can honestly say.....I miss work.&nbsp; I find myself wondering how they are doing...Stuff like that.&nbsp; but I won't call.&nbsp; Monday I was there for a while to find out that some problems have occurred over the weekend, there was a lost package, etc etc......And I'm thinking......Do I really want to come back to this???&nbsp; I've been gone 3 days people...Can you NOT survive without me!!!&nbsp; heh   other than that, things are starting to come together here and soon ill have pics of the new place.&nbsp; I need to find an easier way to post pictures cuz this site doesn't make it so user friendly.&nbsp; well I'm off to the potty and then get myself a bowl of Skinny Cow Chocolate Cookie Dough with peanut butter chunk ice cream.&nbsp; mm mm good.

      I remember when I was a kid my parents and I would go out every weekend and hit the garage/yard sales around the neighborhood and my dad would so appropriate call it...."Going Sailing".&nbsp; I mean we were die hard about it too.&nbsp; Saturday night we would go to the bagel store to get the first copies of the Sunday paper which back then came on Sunday and was the biggest paper you could ever get your hands on.&nbsp; The New York Times &amp; the Daily News.&nbsp; I personally like the Daily News cuz it had the comics, but the NY Times had a great magazine in it and I used to take the pages of it and paste it to my walls, but that's another entry.....  &nbsp;  anyway....So of course we got a dozen bagels, lox, cream cheese and our papers and home we went.&nbsp; now when your a kid this is a big thing because the papers don't come until late at night so this was a big deal for my and my sister to go out at 10pm and them come home and have a bagel for a treat and start pulling apart the paper and handing out the section each of us want.&nbsp; good times!!  &nbsp;  well the classified section always held the listing of all the garage sales and on Sunday after our bagel breakfast, we would go and hit every garage sale around.  other peoples junk became our treasures.&nbsp; I wonder who came up with this idea?&nbsp; anyone know?  &nbsp;  so were sitting around the house yesterday, have I mentioned I'm on vacation this week??&nbsp; we were supposed to have a GS ourselves this weekend but that never panned out on Saturday so Sarah is at work, roomies kid is out swimming and were home trying to figure out what to do.&nbsp; were both tired, no energy, the couch is calling us is a bad way, still need to go grocery shopping but just not in the mood.......So we decide to check out the local sales.&nbsp; we hit a few houses, I got a few candles for a buck and then afterwards we had lunch and did our grocery shopping.  &nbsp;  today we had ours.&nbsp; I can tell you this...I would rather go to them then have one.&nbsp; its cool to make the money but the work involved....I'm on vacation people!!!&nbsp; it lasted about 3 hours and them I gave up, especially since.....I had no help.&nbsp; Sarah had to work and I was left by myself to fight the masses.&nbsp; I made most of my money off these two women who didn't speak a word of English so every thing they picked up a cup I said 25 cents and they say $1.00, so who am I to argue.  &nbsp;  I ended up throwing the rest of the shit away.&nbsp; I have a box of clothes and some appliances that I'm giving to salvation army and the rest of the junk is just that....Junk.&nbsp; pitched it.&nbsp; its so nice to walk into my place and not have boxes around me.&nbsp; Sarah and I stayed up till almost 2am getting everything done....And were almost there.&nbsp; just a few more little things to do and were finally done.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  thank god!!  &nbsp;  my cats are driving me crazy.&nbsp; I really think that 4 cats in this small space (they don't go upstairs yet...Dog) is to much.&nbsp; I'm seriously considering giving 2 away, but I don't see that happening in the near future.&nbsp; Ruben and ebony go upstairs more than Claire and Sofia and that's only because there is a huge dog upstairs who just as scared of the cats than they are of him.&nbsp; its really funny.&nbsp; Rocco just wants to play with them but he don't understand.&nbsp; its cute  &nbsp;  I'm not doing anything on my vacation but relaxing and getting this place finished up.&nbsp; Tuesday were going to the zoo, so that should be fun.&nbsp; its a big zoo and were going to spend the day.&nbsp; other than that.....I'm just chillin.  &nbsp;  so this has been a productive weekend that's for sure.&nbsp; hope you had a great one!!  hugs, jeannine  &nbsp;  &nbsp;

      You know...You hear these stories about companies that are just SO stupid...But you think that perhaps its an over-exaggerated story-telling when in fact...Its TRUE!!  Well I have such a story and believe you me.....It all happened.  were talking about the phone company folks.  I've never (well I didn't actually deal with it...My roomie did) had to deal with such stupidity in all my life.  We opted to get a second line to the existing account instead of getting just one phone line for me because 1. Its cheaper and 2. DSL is on the main line and this way I can have it and it ends up being cheaper.  I'm all about cheap people!  So my roomie calls the phone company (who shall remain nameless, but if you live in IL and used to have Ameritec, you know who I'm talking about!!) to set up the second line in the house and get information on how we can get the DSL on both computers.  The process is pretty simple....Phone guy comes to install new jack in the basement and we network the computers through a "Portal" (which is wireless and very cool) and VALA!! I got a phone line AND DSL on the computer.  Easy enough right......grrrrr  they told her the phone guy could be out on the following Tuesday (this was like 2 weeks ago) which happens to be around the same time the portal adapter thingy should be delivered too...So I take the day off.  Now we haven't moved in yet officially and we still had some painting to do so this would have been a great time to get that all done.  So 9am...Were off to the house.  Phone guy was coming between 1 and 5pm but we got there early thinking UPS would show up, so we wait.  And wait......And wait a little longer......The phone rings around noon.....Its my roomie.  the order was cancelled she tells me, by a third party.  hmmmmm.....A third party???  Seems that the order was never placed to begin with...But they gave us a number.....But the order was cancelled....I don't know.....All I know is that everything was cancelled and I took the day off for nothing.  I should have known that it wasn't going to be a good day cuz when I was painting...It came out horrible and all my ideas sucked and I just gave up.  Then to find this out......Ugh....Off to get some chocolate.  so now the next appointment was for the following Tuesday and they are scheduled to come install the jack between 8am and noon.  Now I happened to have had the day off this day so that was good.  8am.......9am......10am....I call.  Says that he is running behind and were next on the list......11:30......Noon.....12:30......I get a call.......Running late on the last job...Will be here in about 30 min.....30 min came and went and at 3pm he finally showed up.  UPS was also successfully in sending the package, but now the roomie is pissed.  You would think that we would be first on the list since they screwed up last time....And they promised to wave fees, that weren't.  Not a happy camper.  But hey...We've got phone now and DSL is all hooked up.  Allis good.    about a week later the roomie says to me that the services on the phone should be up and running by Thursday (tomorrow) so now I'm happy.  Call waiting, voice mail, long distance...All that......So I asked her today to call my number to see if the service got hooked up yet and as she hits the talk button on her phone says (in an annoyed voice) something is wrong with my phone, my dial tone is skipping.............I sighed.    she's never had voice mail so she wouldn't know what that type of dial tone meant and when I told her she wasn't very happy.  It seems that they put the services on her line and not mine.                stupid   stupid   (S)   stupid  (B)  stupid  (C)  stupid    stupid      so that is my horror story about the phone company.  so i can't wait to hear tomorrow what happened and how long i have to wait now to get my services....so mom if your wondering why i haven't called...its because i don't have long distance yet.  other than that....things are great.  hugs, jeannine

      Finally things are starting to come together.  Every box is in its appropriate room and now we just have to unpack.  We got a lot done but there is still a lot more to do.  The space is smaller and I don't have the closet space I used too so its hard to find a home for things.  Were going to be having a yard sale I'm hoping this weekend to get rid of some of the crap I have.  The basement is almost done.  Basically the ceiling tile and 2 doors are the only things that are top on my list of getting done.  I'm hoping to have a ceiling by this weekend.  All and all the rooms came out really nice.  When everything is in place ill take pics so you can see.  I'm really happy here.  the cats however.....Not so happy.  Did I mention my roomie has a dog...LOL.  Good times. They pretty much stay downstairs and there is a gate in the doorway so Rocco can't come down.  One time he did and they all ran to the ceiling.  It was quite amusing.  Yesterday Ebony and Ruben ventured off upstairs and Rocco was outside.  I couldn't resist.  I had to let him in.  It was just too tempting.  Kind like chocolate cake....You just have to have it.  So I let Rocco in and the two cats when tear-assing downstairs so fast and all Rocco wanted to do was play.  LOL....Hours of entertainment I tell yah.  were not to happy with the phone company these day.  Last week they were supposed to come hook up the phone line and so I took the day off to be there and they never showed up.  Turns out the order was cancelled by a third party.  Someone on there end.  So that day was a bust.  The next available day was yesterday (Tuesday) so had the day off and they were supposed to come between 8am and noon.  You would think since they screwed up the first time that I would be the first call......No.  they showed up at 3.  We got nothing done that we had planned.  I've been trying to get Sarah to dmv so she can get her license but the first time we didn't have all the forms and they this happened.  So again...Nothing got done.  We had to hangout upstairs cuz its hard to hear the doorbell.  Anyhow.....They finally came and we got a phone now. I've also got DSL which is pretty cool too.  I just can't wait till everything is done.  We've got this little bug problem though that is pissing me off.  Earwig.  They are like everywhere.  I'm going to read up on them and see how I can go about getting rid of them.  So annoying.  But I love my home.  I feel bad for my roomie sometimes cuz were up late and some nights we get in late from work and she's in bed by 8 or 9 and I always feel like I'm gonna wake her up....The stairs creek too....Ugh.    anyway.....Work is pretty cool.  Getting busy with back to school stuff.  Its hard to believe that the holidays are approaching.  Next month kids are in school, then Halloween and before you know it we'll be stuffing our faces and opening presents.  5 months people. 5 months.  Of course, in wal-mart world summer is over and Christmas is in July.  Ugh  how about this weather.  Is anyone having a summer??  cuz were not.  It rains more than anything and its maybe hot...One or two days a week...But we haven't hit anywhere near 90 or 100.  Not that I'm complaining.  I applied for a personnel manager at work.  I wanted to withdraw the application but my manager won't let me.  He thinks I would be great there and wants to see me through the interviews since I'm not 100% sure but I'm thinking I'm going to decline.  I can't seem to take myself away from layaway right now....Am I sick or what!?!?!?!?  I keep thinking about that sweet overtime at the holidays.  Sweet paychecks.  So I'm not sure.  There are others who applied that are way more qualified than I am so I'm thinking they would not hire me there anyway.  But who knows.  well that's about it for me right now.  Its pretty boring.  Nothing to exciting going on.

      well yesterday was moving day and i must say...im glad thats over.  UGH!!!!  I HATE MOVING!! maybe its because ive moved so many times in my life that this time i was like.....trash everything...start over.  i have such a headache.  we moved in yesterday.  i got 3 guys from work to help me out and they did a great job.  i really didn't have much so it didn't take long at all.  now is the hard part.  finding a home for everyting.  we had a nice afternoon when we were done.  fired up the grill...had a few beers...just chilled.    sarah had to work last night.  i was exhausted from the move and two hours of sleep the night before, so we slept really really good last night. the cats are freaking out...ebony is in heat and she's driving me crazy.  did i mention my house-mate has a dog...lol...its pretty entertaining.  he came downstairs last night and the 4 of them shot into the ceiling like bandits.  good times.  today we have the pleasure of unpacking and of course now sarah is doubled over in pain due to cramps and i just want to go back to bed but can't.....  vacation in two weeks.  can't wait.  it's very apparent that i have gained back a lot of weight.  i can barely go up and down stairs cuz my knees won't let me.  i was sweating like a pig all day yesterday, out of breath, out of shape, just not good at all.  im very dissapointed in myself.  how i let it get this far, why i let it get this far.....i don't know.  i do know that this move is a good thing and im looking forward to the outcome.  i feel like i let a lot of people down.  including myself.  lets hope for the best.  well gotta go unpack now.  ill be updating more now.  we've got DSL here so im happy about that.    Happy Fourth of July!!  Be Safe. Hugs, Jeannine

      Ok so not a whole hell of a lot of interesting things went on today. Work was cool. Business is picking up a bit with back to school stuff going on so its been a little busier. I have to say that we had more BTS layaway's last year and I'm thinking that this year it doesn't look like its going to be as busy. I also realized that with this new store (supercenter) opening up in October, our store won't be as crazy this Christmas as we are every year which 1. I look forward too, but 2. Worries me. I know with the new store opening that will take some of our business, it will be interesting to see just how much.  after work Sarah and I went for dinner at this nice little place in our local area. I have the  urlLink  Entertainment  book  which is a sweet deal (if you use it) and so we had little dinner (buy one get one free entree). She had this huge Italian beef sandwich with all the fixings and I had this huge steak potato with all the fixings which was awesome!! It was a nice little treat before she had to go to work.  I cam home and took a nap for about 2 hours which in my mind is acceptable nap time. I'm hoping to get to bed at a decent hour (midnight) and catch up on a good night sleep. So other than that......  hope you had a great day.

      2am went to bed.  5:23 am woke up....Had to pee and decided...My alarm will be going off in 10 min I might as well just get up...So I did.  5:50 am dressed and ready to start my day.  now usually I'm ready by 6 and by that time the roomie is done and I go up and make my breakfast. Since I have some time this morning (roomie is still doing her thing) I decided I would enlighten ya'll will an early morning entry. Pretty cool huh.  I thought fa-sho I would be really tired this morning but I guess with all that sleep yesterday I got the required amount of sleep I needed.  fa-shizzel  so now I'm dressed in these  urlLink tight ass jeans  waiting for the roomie to finish up and then I can go and make me some yummy coffee and perhaps a breakfast sandwich and be on my way. I bought me some vanilla/chocolate/almond coffee the other day and it is yummy. Still lovin the one cup. mmmmmm  ok well seeing as its Monday I'm sure I'll have a lot to talk about later so until then....  have a wonderful day hugs, jeannine

      I want to live in a state where it is 75 degrees every day. Last Thursday was the most perfect day. I loved it!! Sun was out, shade was cool, breezy, perfection in my book. Ideal weather conditions for me. So if you know of this place... urlLink let me know   well this weekend wasn't all that productive. I'm really mad at myself today cuz I did nothing but sleep and there is plenty to do, but yet I slept the day away. I think I need to see a doctor. This is just not normal. However, that and reading  urlLink Says  journal gave me an idea to have my own "fitness" journal of sorts. I'm not sure its going to be about fitness, more of the trying to lose weight, instead of complaining here.....Ill do it there type of journal. Its called  urlLink The Feedbag . It will be linked over there to your right so if you ever want to check it out....Its there. Don't know if ill be posting every day on it...But on those particular "fat days" I'm sure there will be plenty of blog-buzzing. Ill have a notify too, so be sure and sign up for it.  so again today I slept all day. Got up around 10, had breakfast, hung out with the roomie for a little while, went back downstairs, checked my email, Sarah woke up and I was going to get dressed but instead lay'ed down and didn't wake up till Sarah called me at 4 (from the upstairs phone) asking me if I wanted dinner. After dinner she went to work and here I sit. This is just not normal. The sad part about all this is that I can go back to sleep if I wanted too. I'm actually forcing myself to stay up. After this I'm going to do some laundry and move some things around. I really don't understand this pattern. I think I'm going to look it up on the net and see if I can find something. I just hope I'm not diabetic. I've heard that this is one of the symptoms. Any ideas?? Leave me a comment....  well that's about it for today. I want to get off my ass and do something before I end up sitting here all night and nothing gets done. I hope you all had a great weekend

      So I still haven't found a home yet for the cats and now I have to shelter them. 2 of them actually. Claire is going back to its original owner and I'm going to keep Sofia. Ruben and ebony are the two that are going. Since those are Sarah's cats and she's getting her dog back, she doesn't have a problem with it. She would much rather have her dog and I'm happy to keep Sofia. This has been the hardest thing to do. Its no wonder there are so many cats on the road. Every shelter I called is full or not taking animals from the public, blah blah blah. I understand that and I'm not being irrational, but jeeze. These are two good, healthy cats that just need a home. I hate this. So now I continue making calls and hopefully ill find something.  I've been sleeping an awful lot lately. Seems that whenever I'm home and I lay down for a nap its like 4 to 5 hours long and then I'm up for about 2 hours and I'm back in bed again. I can sleep a whole day away and not think anything of it and still get a full nights sleep. Maybe I need to take vitamins. Or lose weight. Get off my ass and do something. I'm just not in the mood to do anything and its really pissing me off. But do I do anything about it......NOOOOOO. Sorry I'm just feeling sorry for myself right now. You might as well go onto the next journal. I'm just ranting here.  I'm just fed up with life. Tired of always playing catch-up. This move was a good one, but its like one thing after another. In my head the plan worked out so well....Being able to get the bills paid, catch up on finances, save some money...But every freaking week something comes up and I'm broke again. I have to say that this time is better cuz at least I run out 3 or 4 days before payday instead 2 to 3 days after payday...So I have to say that that part is much better, but still........When is it going to all be ok again?? Is so frustrating.  well I'm going to shower and hopefully wake up cuz I'm about 2 seconds from saying....."I'm taking a nap" and then nothing will get done today. Maybe a long hot shower will wake me up and maybe I just need to get out and drive for a little while and think.........  one of my fish died yesterday too. :o(

      I had to force myself to sit here and write an entry today. There is just nothing going on. Nothing. nada. Zilch. Zip. Zero.  N-O-T-H-I-N-G!!  lets see.....Yesterday I wasn't in the mood to be at work cuz I was still mad from Friday so I "had a headache" and went home at 1. Came home and took a "nap". Woke up at 8...Ugh....Sarah was tired too and also slept. I think we stay up to late and to watch TV. I'll never learn.  after that............................Watched TV...I think....Can't remember.....Yes...Watched "Growing Up Gotti". That was pretty entertaining. Then I got sucked into all those damn TLC shows....They kill me every time.  today work was better and stayed all day. They are making me purge my layaway bins (where we keep all the packages customers put on layaway) from 16 bins down to 10. This my friends is no easy project. Were talking about putting 6 bins of packages into 10 that are already filled to capacity. His (store manager) reasoning is, he wants to be ready for the back to school rush. HELLO!!! We are already THERE!!!! What the hell does he think all those packages are??? Moron. I just think he's pissed cuz the store is looking really bad and layaway is the only dept that is pretty much OK and he's just looking for shit. Bastard. So that was my day today.  I bought more bead stuff and I was talking to some people there and are looking forward to seeing what I come up with. Already have some people interested in buying. So that's pretty cool. I haven't made anything yet. Still working on that loom project but the beads they give you are for shit so I got new ones.  I don't know if anyone watches BET but tonight they did a rerun of the BET Awards and that woman who plays Nikki Parker on that show "The Parkers" who is hysterically funny....Was the host. OMG...She started off the show with a dance routine with her (big girl) and 6 other big girls dancing to Beyonces "Crazy In Love" song. OMG...IT WAS SOOOOO AWESOME!!!! She has this thing about "skinny bitches" (as she calls them) and she tore the stage UP!!! Made this big girl proud :o) it wasn't your typical skinny girl video. It was great.  Came home, had pizza for dinner, and then I gave Sarah a perm (relaxer) to loosen the curls in her hair. She didn't want it straight. I don't think it took to well. She bought a kid perm...I laughed at her. It wasn't strong enough for her head of hair. She got some hair people. But she's getting her yearbook picture taken tomorrow so she wanted to try something different with her hair. She's a senior. How fast they grow. Tear.  ok that's about it...Gone split. Have a good one. Hugs!!
