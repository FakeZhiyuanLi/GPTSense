Haiz...looking at her then i did the same thing i always saw a girl like that....Look away if not,&nbsp;there&nbsp;will be&nbsp;a misunderstanding, and &nbsp;think of the hopeless me.....

       Past.....There Are Some Good Times and Some Bad Times.....In The Past...Most Of Them Were Goood Times...As I Grow Older, Bad Things Start To Pile Up...More and More.... I Was a Happy-Go-Lucky Guy in....Sec1, sec2,sec3........after that i'm no more a happy-go-lucky guy anymore.......Because things started to get from bad to worst.....Sec4 Was Not so bad Because it's Just The beginning...after I get N's and got out of sch...things just got Worst...Lots Of Things Happen...Alot Of........Bad Things Started happened.....at that time, i always thought of the good times i had in my secondary years.....I Started Thinking about secondary one, first day of school, my first few friends in my class, wrestling in class........unforgettable school moments..... After School......Meet Up with jon, play chess, badminton, soccer, stupid games like catching....two person or three(when jing kuwag come join us) playing catching...stupid huh...fun at that time.....we play all that and always hang around jon's place, we like to hang around around there especially around the badminton court, played badminton there with wind and without net....sometimes sit on the bench and talk cork.....bullshit to each other....lots and lots of stuff to write abt this but didnt wan to make it a very very long blog entry so....lets go on...to other parts of my good times... As I Grow older I can explore around chinatown,around sec2 or sec3 i was introduced to dot net, a cybercafe. It was all fun and stuff, know lots of frenz, old, young, fat, skinny, smelly frenz.....there were one simliar thing abt them...they are all lamers. A really fun group of lamers, most of the time we always play CS cos it's the IN thing and it's really fun...we did lots of lame stuff and laugh our heads off.....After months and months of CS then we changed to a strategy game, well it was really fun too.....there were lame strategies but very Effective! haha!One Game after another more and more ppl came in and play....therefore more people joined our group of lamers....it was still ok till the chinese online game came... we tried out the game ourselves at home...it was fun as usual...though i'm really really bad in chinese so most of the time i'll use my mum's phone and call my fren up and describe the items then ask him wad is it. Haiz....this is when the bad things happen to me, one of fren in our group brought his gf along.....her nick name was ANGEL(OMG...It's So...EEEE) I don know her name...i think her real name was "ASS ON MY HEAD BITCH" She is a rich bitchass, She got a gold bar struck up her ass when she's born...well....she came into our group(there's already someone i hate inside the group before she came in) she was a bitch but i donno why the our "leader" liked her as a fren.......then she worked in dot net, well she had nothing to do wad...and my good fren "Thomas" which nickname was "Banana" or "Kimjio".....was actually the one who work in dot net but then he need to go for he's NS...sad la, then becos of some stupid chinese online game and some stupid new frenz they have made for around 3 months(angel and another person i hate was one of them, actually there's only three fuckers, these two and another one) the "leader" of our group quarreled with me and told me not to go to dot net anymore.....that hurt me quite much cos i've known him for 3-2 years and he actually said that and didnt call or sms me anymore......i was really sad at that time....after this incident more and more bad things fall on me....I Wished that it nv happened and i also wished that i'll never ever lose my good frenz like that ever again.... Suddenly one or two months before my N's, i Stood up, didnt care abt all the sad stuff and really tried my best to study for my N level. I studied to the very end of the subject that i wanted to do well......Then after that i when relaxing after so much studies i didnt remember the sad memories....and when i got my results i was really happy because i actually PASSED MY N LEVEL!!! One Of My biggest accomplishments....because alot of ppl discouraged me by telling me "Danny u cannot make it for n levels one la", "Danny quit school now la no use wasting more money", "Danny u gonna do bad this time", Lots of Danny cannot, Danny quit, Danny Retain....all those discouragements made me standup and tried my best....even if i failed my N level...i'll not be regretting or be really sad  because i know....i gave my best. After afew months of celebrate for my N's.....Bad Stuff Start to bug me again....The Sad Side Of Me Started To Appear...so i thought of the good times i had last time......until now....i cant stop thinking about the past......when i'm alone, no one's around...i thought abt the past then i prayed abt my past as tears dropped down and slided down from my fist to the ground...  Phrase:"Feels like my past only brings back the pain, Wishing that Someday those memories will fade away"

       My Dad always say that it's good to act blur at times...Becos it can save u from arguements, quarrels and other bad stuff... He Also Told me that "Ren" Is A Very Important and Difficult To Do In Life...btw "Ren" is a chinese word which means tolerance or endurance...something like that... Lesson Taught by my Dad is always priceless and useful in life, It Has saved me Alot Of times... It's much much more difficult to do than to just say it.....very Difficult to master indeed...But Acting blur is not difficult at all...haha...if u wan u can but not tolerance... For My Case It's not very difficult Because i got fishing as my hobby...Fishing Needs Lots Of Patience And Endurance...i train from there.....it when quite well. I trained with my Best Fishing Buddy, Jian Hui, He's a Great guy. Didnt Have the Chance to go fishing with him nowadays...no time, he's O's coming also...haiz... I Trained Hard And Very Well......Maybe TOO Well.....It Changed My Personality...I Like To Keep Things To Myself, Good Or Bad I'll Keep It To Myself... Well, This Helped me to escape quite a number of quarrels and arguements. Nothing Is Perfect, This Method Also Has It's Bad Points.....When comes to going out alone or i'm alone in my room, i thought about the stuff i had tolerated(i didnt wan to remind myself but...), sometimes it hurts my heart really really bad, it's like something squeezed my heart real REAL hard...When Everyone in my house have slept... I Grabbed my pillow i cried like a six year old boy......... I Dont know why i wrote all these..... I'll just stop here...i don wan to talk somemore abt it cos i don wan to waste anymore of my tears These Blog Is Specially made for all my very good+Best buddies and my brother, jon. It's Let Them to know more abt me...for those who just got to know me or don know me well...please don talk abt it infront of me or ask me any doubts, questions abt it...  Phrase Of The Day: It is better to remain silent and be thought a fool than to speak out and remove all doubt.  Danny's Phrase: "Doesn't mean That A Guy Who Is Physically Strong Is Emotionally Strong Too"
