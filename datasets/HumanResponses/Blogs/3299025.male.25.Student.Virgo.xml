      Pride is always a wild rollercoaster of emotions for me. Every year, it's probably the loudest and happiest that I get about being gay, and still, it turns out to be one of the times where all of the problems of being gay (or at least my being gay) get magnified into some larger-than-life spectacle of ridiculosity.   Normally, that means that, despite all the cute boys I see on the parade trail, I just don't get laid. This year, however, it was extraordinarily weird.  I was marching with the Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender People In Medicine group.  Queer doctors and medical students in Chicago are either so few and far between (less likely) or ridiculously lame (more likely) that our contingent is usually only about 5 to 8 people. There was an unexpectedly large number of people winking and smiling at me as we were marching down the parade route, and many of them were cute, too. But, where are these people for the other 364 days a year? I swear, I am taking a pad and paper and just taking down phone numbers next year.  What's even funnier about the parade trail is that everyone who has never called you, or has stopped calling you, or never will call you, is on the trail, and very happy to see you now that you're marching around in a pair of ill-fitting medical scrubs. One of my Matts – friend with privileges Matt, hasn't called me in like a month, Matt –  was there. And I have never heard Ryan's voice on the phone, yet somehow, he was there, screaming my name louder than anyone. In order me to partake in the party fun, Jen, whose car I rode in to go to Pride, left to go home, leaving me admittedly stranded in Boystown. Trouble, of course, ensues.  So, I went to Paolo's party. I saw this guy there, Luis, whom I haven't seen in a few months, since Paolo and I had been studying together. I just blurted out (and at this point, I am not even drunk) that I think that he is totally sexy. It's fine though, because I am under the impression that this guy was straight, and you know how straight guys love this kinda talk. He immediately started blushing and guffawing: "I never get that! No one ever tells me I'm sexy."   Paolo, of course, popped in: "EVERYONE tells you you're sexy."   This man, then, took his cue to begin flirting with me, very, very hard. As I'm enjoying this attention, stuffing my boner away unsuccessfully in a pair of scrubs, another guy, some 19 year old Puerto Rican kid came up between us being like..."Why you flirtin' with my man?" I thought it was a joke, but the guy was totally serious. I watched the way Luis looked at him; he was totally flirting with both of us, at the same time, in each others' presences.  By this point I have noticed that there was a six-year-old kid running around this party full of 20 something year old drunk homosexuals. Really cute kid: smart, bright. He showed me his glow-in-the-dark button that he got at the pride parade. We talked about how it's dark someplace else on the planet because it's light here in Chicago. We talked about the planets and everything. Real intellectual shit. Of course, I am secretly six years old, so this is all wonderful for me.  Meanwhile, Luis continued to flirt with me so much that I am compelled to tell him that I have always thought he was extremely sexy, and I didn't say anything because he was straight. "I've explored one part of my life, and now I would like to explore the other part.  I'm thirty-one years old, and I haven't figured it all out...but you know what? I could fall in love with a man. Physically, emotionally, I am capable of falling in love with a man..." He said this, to me, looking deeply into my eyes and touching my chest. Which, mind you, is still covered in scrubs. And it's very difficult to hide the, ahem, intensity you're feeling at a particular moment in a pair of scrubs. "One of  these days, I'm going to kiss you so hard." I said to him. He responded by telling me to go get a drink.   By this point, I was plenty certain I was being toyed with, so I leave Paolo's party to go to another party, and I'm sorta just ready to relax. I hung out at the party, which is just another extension of the Boystown shallow waiter/retail/still a bitch for no good reason crowd. I'm plenty bored by a waiter who wouldn't give me the time of day if I didn't have the balls to talk to some guy he had been checking out across the room. He was not interested in conversing with me any longer, the host is not talking to me, and the only person I know there was not talking to me, so, nonplussed by the vapidity of this party, I leave. I figured I would stop back by Paolo's place.  I'm pretty sauced by this point, but not so sauced as to ignore the fact that Luis and the Puerto Rican kid were off in the bedroom cuddling or something. Whatever. They were out in a quick hot second, so I didn't mind. Then the six year old kid offered me a glass of water (this kid is seriously pretty brilliant, as he realized I needed water at this point) and asked if I would like to come over to his house and have dinner. Sure, I said; this Luis guy is not inviting me anywhere, why not have dinner with the only guy at the party who is paying me any attention. He, of course, has to ask his mom and his dad. And so he ran up to Luis shouting "Dad! Dad! Can Thom come over for dinner?" I gave my phone number to papa.  He asked me if I liked pasta. So I guess that's what we're having.

      Paolo invited me to a fundraiser for his water polo team. They were holding some shindig at Sidetracks from 6 PM to 9 PM on Wednesday. There were promises of food, drag queens, free drinks and water polo boys in their speedos.  When I arrived, at around 6:40, the only food that was left was Swedish meatballs. And since I haven't eaten red meat or Swedes in over ten years, I passed. Additionally, there were no speedos to be found anywhere. PLUS, to top it all off, I knew NO ONE at that place. It has become increasingly rare for me to walk into a crowded bar and know no one, but somehow, I managed to do that this time.  I left for a brief moment to grab a bite to eat, and a cute boy making eyes at me through the window at Hearty Boys Café helped make the decision. When I went back, I was feeling energetic, so it was time to meet new folks.  I looked for guys who looked like fun, but who weren't busy posing. Who looked like they were friends, but not trying to cruise too hard. Because I was in the mood for making friends that night. I had work in the morning. I happened to stumble across a nice foursome of fellas named Eric, Zach, Scotty, and Craig, and there was some weird guy who left as soon as I got over there, and so I assumed he was just hitting on one of the guys there. They were very nice, and quite receptive to the idea of being my new best friends. I, of course, was anxious, because I just wanted to talk to people and not feel alone in a room full of people, but, looking back, they were actually quite cool. And plus, sometimes I need to remind myself that it is a privilege to know and be liked by me, so good for them.  The show ended with only a brief show of speedo. My new best friends and I were heartily disappointed.  They left, and I was hanging out with Paolo and this dancer guy, Devon, whom I met at Berlin one night. But then, as happens when you hang out with Paolo sometimes, he got on the prowl, and I was sorta out in the cold. That's fine, I guess.   Weird things that happened:   Paolo's friend, Casey, refused to tell a guy his ethinicity, because he was "post-ethnic American". There are a number of reasons why someone might say this, some good, some bad. I wonder which Casey had in his pocket.  When this guy came over to talk to us, I was engaged in my normal degree of self-aware histrionics about my dating life. Woe is me, the usual. I stopped, because there was some man who was not involved in our conversation listening, and he was a stranger, and didn't need to know how pitiful I was feeling at that point. Paolo turns around and tells him that I am a "player". Wow. A stranger? And that's not even true. And maybe those who don't know me need a briefing. I get a lot of phone numbers, probably more than most of my friends, but the quality is low.  We're talking scheisty lawyers, and scheistier law students, people not over their exes...am I supposed to be forming strong relationships with these people. I was a little frustrated, and no one was talking to me, because they were getting their cruise on, and it was not my evening for such things. So I left. I'm healing.

      Every Friday, in my psychiatry rotation, we meet up with a different attending physician, Dr. Paisner, to do a bit of addiction medicine learning.  Dr. Paisner is a little and intimidating man, who seems to be quite a good psychiatrist, but does not seem to be someone whose bad side you'd like to get on. There is definite potential for the ADT here, but I haven't seen it yet, so...so far so good.  We started out this Friday talking to a couple of patients who were recovering from opiate addiction, either heroin or some other form of opiate. For those of you not blessed with a $200,000 medical education, the moral of the story is that all opiates basically turn out to be the same drug in the body. Heroin, Morphine, Codeine, Oxycontin,  Percodan, Dilaudid, Demerol, Vicodin....these are all the same damn thing, really. Little twists and turns that make each slightly different in the way it makes you feel, but that's about it. So what you might see with opiate addiction can range from street heroin to people addicted to prescribed pain medications (the main clinical use for any of these drugs). And what's too bad about these drugs is that they are so very addictive. They give a great amount of pleasure, and the withdrawal is every bit as dramatic, if not more dramatic, than you see in the movies.  So we meet up with Dr. Paisner at 10:30. Of course, Dan and David, two of my classmates, were late because, one of the opiate-addicted patients they were talking to began crying uncontrollably. "10:30 is 10:30," Dr. Paisner greeted them sternly. They explained that they were comforting a distressed patient, but Dr. Paisner repeated his stern warning: "10:30 is 10:30".  We talked to some more patients, some who did not believe they were addicted to opiates, others who are glad to be out from under the horse. Apparently, after 5 days free from your opiate drug of choice, day six you are CLEAN. Otherwise, withdrawal is so terrible that you either want to die or take more of the drug, to stave off the withdrawal. Miles Davis apparently locked himself in a shack for a week to clean himself up from heroin. And then he did that funky perm thing to his hair. Ah well. They did say he was never the same after that...  Anyways, to hear real people involved in these extremely dramatic tales, which I once believed were the province of Nancy Reagan-era "War on Drugs" scare movies is pretty sobering, no pun intended. Successful people, people with dreams, people with lots of potential and opportunity -- unfortunately, with this drug, most of them are addicted for life. Plus you have a possible co-morbidity (medical term for catching two diseases at once) with some psychiatric disorder, which we also learn is one of the main reasons people develop drug habits in the first place. So, you have this chronic psychiatric disorder, and you take this highly addictive drug to stave off the anxiety you feel due to your disorder, and well, it's just a recipe for trouble.  We took a break from the dramatics to have a cozy lunch on the roof of our building. Until over the loudspeaker, we hear "Code Blue, third floor, ITU". Um...I haven't watched very many episodes of ER, but that's a big one. So all of the doctors rush downstairs to see what was going on; apparently, one of our patients had managed to sneak some heroin into the facility, and had overdosed to the point of him or her not breathing. As medical students whose first rotation is psychiatry, no experience or anything, we just sat tight and stayed out of the way. When the other doctors returned they sorta glared at us with shame. Elizabeth, one of the residents, pulled us over, and gave us a mildly exasperated reminder that we are medical students and we should run to Code Blues as well. "It's a valuable learning experience, and there are probably things that we could do to help."  Recalling that I was unsure just a few minutes before which bone was the radius and which was the ulna, I was highly doubtful of that fact.  At first, we didn't think anyone minded, but we received a lot of passive aggressive comments the rest of the day about how we were big scaredy cats. I simply didn't know whether I was wanted. And it's not that we were needed; the person began breathing again, and all was good. Still, there was a chilly air surrounding the med students the rest of the day. I frankly didn't feel guilty at all, and I like to think that God was on our side, as He made it rain into Dr. Paisner's top-down convertible.  I worked through the pain by drinking myself into a pitiful, blubbering stupor later that evening, trying to drag compatriots of mine to Berlin. I  probably had one of my worst hangovers ever, and while I don't know whether my body was trying to help me sympathize with the opiate addicts, or punishing me for not running at the Code Blue, or whether God was punishing me for snickering just a little at the Doctor's ruined leather interiors,  I couldn't help but feeling like locking myself up in my apartment like Miles Davis until the music came back. And it didn't until Sunday.  P.S. I did manage to win a bet with Cara Rabik's sister, though. Hangover or not, that gorgeous girl owes me ten bucks.

      I hung out with my friend  urlLink Tim  last night and we caught up on life and stuff before he left town on another one of his travels.   He travels a lot.  Anyways, we watched Kill Bill, Vol. 1, which neither of us had seen at that point. What a great movie!! Like, you can't even get grossed out by the violence because it is so over the top, you sorta know that it's not real. Uma was great, I was a big fan of Lucy Liu, and my favorite breakout character is, of course GoGo. She crazy.  After that, though, Tim coaxed me into watching CSPAN Senate debates on the Federal Marriage Amendment. I saw Jim Talent, Ted Kennedy, Orrin Hatch, and Hillary Rodham Clinton. I originally wanted to leave before Orrin Hatch got on, but it was kinda entertaining.  Sen. Hatch had all these fancy pictures and graphs, showing how many states had same-sex married couples living in them as opposed to 1996. It looked like all those epidemiological maps of like, syphilis outbreaks, or West Nile virus.  He went on to say some pretty incredible things.   Example 1:  "[same-sex marriage] is the most important issue facing our country right now."  Really. Then tell George Bush to stop fighting with Al Qaeda, since this fundamental issue is not one our respective nations seem to disagree on. Or did I miss something? Like, are the Republicans fueling this war on terror/brown people because Abdul Rauf Nassib and Sayyed Imam Sherif are destroying the fabric of our nation by giving each other secret reach-arounds in the deserts of West Yemen?  Example 2:   This is the most important debate in our nation's history.   (In my best Tim Stewart-Winter voice) Interesting. Thank goodness no one halted the Constitutional Convention to find out why Alexander Hamilton and Aaron Burr were *really* mad at each other.  Example 3:  If you let a same-sex couple, married in Massachusetts, move to South Dakota, recognizing that marriage will violate the will of the people in South Dakota, thus destroying states' rights.   First of all, um, hello? Why are you moving from Massachusetts to South Dakota? You deserve to have your marriage dissolved if you do stupid shit like that.  Secondly, there are plenty of "traditional" marriages that violate the will of the people. Some weddings that require referenda:  Ryan Reynolds and Alanis Morrisette. They're engaged...did you know that? Anyways, their marriage would violate my will to fantasize about Ryan as my personal naked love slave. REJECTED.  Brad Pitt and Jennifer Aniston. You know those kids are gonna turn out either really hot, or really ugly. No one needs to stick around to find out. DISSOLVED.  Nick Lachey and Jessica Simpson. Talk about destroying the fabric of our nation...DISSOLVED.  Jennifer Lopez and anybody... this chick obviously doesn't know what she's doing. She needs pre-approval before she gets married, always. YOU ARE NOT APPROVED.  People who listen to the will of the public:  Liza Minelli and David Gest. Good job. 'Cause that was just creepy.  Michael Jackson and Lisa Marie Presley. Good job. 'Cause that was just creepy.  Jude Law and Sadie Frost. Thank goodness someone is finally paying attention to my needs to fantasize about Jude Law as  my  husband. That's democracy at work.

      I went to the gym on Saturday, and my arms now hurt so badly that trying to chase boys around is kinda a ridiculous way to occupy my time at the moment. I figured it might be a good time to tell you all about my psychiatry rotation.  So, I'm working at Chicago Lakeshore Hospital, Child and Adolescent floor, with my classmates Kate and Vivian. It's great to be working with people whom you like and are glad to continue to get to know throughout the rotation. Vivian is this lovely Korean American woman who is dating the skinniest white man on the planet (I love Armand!!). She's one of those types who sorta giggles her way around being a supergenius, so that the rest of the world doesn't get mad that her IQ is about twenty points higher than the rest of ours. Kate is this tall, beautiful woman with freckles who doesn't like to hear that she's as gorgeous as she is. And the woman has "professional" written all over her; like, it would be impossible for her to be a waitress or something, because you'd be like, this woman looks like someone's CEO. We are all sorta bumbling along being sorta ridiculous, a little unsure of how to talk to psychiatrically unstable patients and, at times, psychiatrically unstable staffpersons.  The day goes like this: We show up. We try to find our assigned fellows (resident physicians who do most of the legwork of caring for the patients in the hospital) to see if there are any new patients we should follow and work up. We go and talk to the patients, see why they're here in the hospital. Then, after a number of these encounters, we meet with our attending physician (the person ultimately responsible for the care of these patients) and tell him what we discovered. He signs something, asks questions, and we move on to the next patient. Then after that, we're pretty much done for the day. So we can talk with patients more, sit in on group sessions, do any additional follow up work we were asked to do. Or we go home. I like that one.  One of the great things about working at this particular facility is working with the great physicians that we get to know. My attending is Dr. Alan Ravitz, a man whom we're guessing to be in his early 50's with most of his hair (hooray!) and a bushy mustache. He's kinda loud and hilarious, and has the Chicagoest accent ever. He meets with us every day, and we tell him about our meetings with our assigned patients, and he writes down things and laughs at us for making silly mistakes. Ah well. Even better still is his avoidance of doing the Asshole Doctor Thing.   The Asshole Doctor Thing, or ADT for short, is when people who are supposed to be hired to teach you things get very irritated when you ask them questions about things, or, god forbid, as a student, you don't know something, and dismiss you as though you should never have passed the 10th grade. These are the types who will tell you "don't worry about it" because the  real  answer requires precisely 17 more neurons than you possess. The types who answer your question without looking at you because, well, your question doesn't deserve eye contact. Not all doctors do it, in fact, most good doctors don't. And you don't have to be a doctor to do it. But that's the ADT. Dr. Ravitz doesn't do that. In fact, he does things like say, "make sure you don't forget this, because this is very important." Even when you mess  shit up. Now that's teaching.  Our resident fellows in Child Psychiatry are pretty cool as well. There's Angela, the savvy British doctor who also manages to speak Spanish and take our calls in the middle of the night. I haven't worked with her a bunch, but she seems swell.   I've just begun working with Julie, who comes off as the most on top of her game. She wears the cute plastic glasses, and walks around being all Asian and sweet and smart. And she let me present a new patient today. She seems great!  Kourosh is the one I've worked with most of the time. He's one of these guys who reeks of high school nerd, but is now super smooth, helpful, psychiatry man. Or maybe he's grown up high school nerd...who can tell? If he really is grown-up nerd, then we'll know by the fact that I will have fallen in love with him by the end of the rotation. Either that, or I'll catch him wearing an XL t-shirt (this man is not an XL) tucked into his jeans shorts on the weekend or something. He refers to his fiancé as an "awesome, awesome girl". He's  that  psychiatrist who wears his hair in a ponytail. And he gives me hope, despite his latent nerdiness, that doctors can be normal people. With "awesome, awesome" lovers.  They all do. And the ADT is absent from ALL of them.  I would love to tell all kinds of stories about the patients we see, because, let me tell you, there are lots of stories. But I would be violating some sacred ethical obligation, and some thingie called the hippocratic oath (or was that HIPAA?). But suffice it to say that the kids don't want to be there, and they don't always understand enough to believe that you're helping them. I mean, we're talking frank psychosis here. But, most of the people we see at CLSH wind up loads better when they leave than when they came in, and that's something. What's also great is that this is the one field in medicine where it is not efficacious to buzz in and out of as many patients' rooms as possible. It is required to sit down and talk with the patients. That's also a great feeling.  Frankly, I'm worried that the rest of the year won't be nearly as cool as this rotation. But I'll find someone's ass to kiss, that's for sure.

      I LOVE  urlLink  DeGrassi: The Next Generation.  I cannot begin to tell you how exciting that show is. Though I shall. For those who don't know,  DeGrassi Junior High   and   Degrassi High  were television shows in the 80's about life as a teenager in a very cool, urban, and Canadian high school. That's right. Canada. Chock full of "aboats" and "soary's" and "where have you bean?"s. Anyways, one of the characters in that show got pregnant, and decided to keep the baby.  The GENIUSES at Canadian Television decided that it would be good to make a Next Generation show now that the baby of that character is junior high age. So for the past three years, we've had a whole new generation of kids at DeGrassi. And what a generation. Makes me want to be 14 again. But Canadian.  I can go on and on about Emma (the original cast member's baby)  and her new boyfriend, who is the blackest person in Canada, or Ellie and Sean the "alternative kids" or Ashley and Craig, musicians, rivals and star-crossed lovers with great hair and lots of attitude. Or Manny, who is looking for love in all the wrong places, mostly with other people's boyfriends, and JT, the class clown who could be so right for Manny now that she has aborted her and Craig's baby (although in the conservative USA, that NEVER happened).  But I shall gush about Marco. The cutest episode ever aired last night, where Dylan, high school hockey star (now remember, this is Canada, so this guy is like the undisputed king...er...queen of the jocks) asks Marco out. That 17 year old has got mad game!! It was so smooth and sexy, I almost cried, because I know NO ONE that smooth and sexy. The best part was that Marco's formerly homophobic friend TOTALLY helps out. Then they go on their date, and exchange "I think you're pretty great"s over fries and burgers. Then there's a movie portion, where Marco tries to touch Dylan's hand, but he's too nervous to grab it, but Dylan says it's OK, and grabs Marco's hand....oh my goodness. This show is usually filled with great stuff, but this is the only episode that made me crunch up into a ball of omigodthatissofuckingcute-ness. Watch it on  urlLink the N , Friday nights at 8/7c. This is my first NPM advertisement, but, eh, these things happen.

      So, on the heels of talking to my friend Kevin B. about how I used to be a fat kid (he was surprised to learn this fact), I had a pretty strange dream last night where I met this wonderful, wonderful man.   He, in the dream, was unfortunately in the closet, but I didn't care. He cared about me in an extremely profound way. Anyways, in this dream, he was locked up in jail and I waited diligently until he was released. He gets out of jail, and runs to me and tells me how much he loves me and how glad he is to see me, and he kisses me, then he reaches around my waist, and he feels my love handles. Which do exist, by the way. At this point, he instantly becomes disgusted with me and runs into his large apartment condominium complex. I start yelling at the building, saying "come out here! Tell me why you ran away! I deserve an explanation! Get out here, or I'll tell the whole world what we've done together!!" And to him, being in the closet, as I mentioned earlier, this was quite a threat.   So, instead of coming out himself, he sends his best friend, a rather unattractive Indian woman with dark red lipstick and big teeth. She had very wide hips and adorned them with terribly frumpy looking light brown jeans. She then proceeded to give me a speech along the lines of: "Well, can you blame him? Don't you want someone with a slim, slender physique? Someone with rock hard abs?" I replied calmly, that attractive people needed a better spokesmodel than her. And I also said something that sounded quite sassy in my subconscious: "Your ass, in those jeans, is in no danger of making me bi. And baby, if it did, I would let being bi pass me by." The crowd that had gathered outside at that point roared with laughter, but the emotional pain that I was still feeling in the dream at this point caused me to wake up. The moral of this dream, I'm sure, is something more profound than "don't get an eating disorder and go to the gym", yet, I woke up and resolved to do just that. Hooray for distorted morals.  Ironically, in psychiatry today, we had a lecture about eating disorders. Instead of paying attention to the lecture, I thought about this dream, and how I felt as though I may be a stone's throw away from one of these eating disorders if my subconscious kept beating me up so. I thought about all of my friends with eating disorders, and all of the things they've been through, and I was just like, ugh.  I did learn some interesting things though. When we began talking about bulimia nervosa, a serious disorder characterized by binge eating and purging, either by inducing vomiting, using laxatives, or some other compensatory behavior, they noted that one of the diagnostic criteria was "eating an objectively large amount of food". Objectively large? That's like saying Jessica Alba is objectively prettier than Tara Reid; you sorta get it, but there's nothing objective about it.  But leave it to modern science to take the mystery away. The lecturer circulated a list of foods and "objectively large" amounts of them. Let's take a look at some favorites. And I think this list was from Oxford, so thank the Brits for this.  3 plates of Chinese food. OK, this is a lot of food, but keep in mind that you are always hungry an hour later. This is an easy trap to fall into, I think. Does it count as a purge if it's just the blatant culinary trickery of the Chinese?  5 donuts or 15 donut holes. Hmm? OK, this is a little much, but keep in mind that, for this to be an "objectively large" amount of food, most of us are very capable of comfortably eating such amounts of food, or somewhat less.W e only eat one donut, or a half a donut due to considerable, and admirable psychological restraint. Cuz those Krispy Kremes are gooooood.  5 pieces of a large pizza. Really? People used to count on me in my younger years to polish off at LEAST that many slices of pizza. I mean, especially if that pizza is free, you need to get your money's worth. I certainly don't think that it counts if you are peer pressured into bingeing.  15 Oreos. Um...are these people AWARE of my life? 15 Oreos counted for about 2 and a half pages of a paper in college. I think that the stock price of Nabisco Foods crashed when I finished my senior thesis. My whole rotation came out talking about eating whole boxes of Girl Scouts' Thin Mints. And they call it "objectively large".  3 plates of steamed vegetables. OK, now, I certainly don't want to make light of anyone's eating disorder, so perhaps I should just say that we, as the general public, need to be enlightened about the nature of the steamed vegetable binge. It seems that it is as serious as the Chinese food. Where is the MTV 'True Life' where the 15 year old girl is shamefully lying about the bags of broccoli that she is smuggling out of the Whole Foods, and taking home to steam before mom gets back home? Where is the boy whose parents are keeping the lima beans under lock and key? Where is the Meredith Baxter-Birney after school special about her crudite problem?  All this class has done is convinced me that I do, in fact, have an eating disorder, and that I should go to the gym. Damn. The dialectic process at work.

      I have a confession to make. I'm addicted to boys.  I honestly get a physical rush when I successfully obtain a man's phone number. And, like drugs or alcohol, sometimes the shit you get is real good, and other times, the shit is, well, just that: shit.  In the medical field, we have a set of questions, the CAGE questions, to ask someone if you suspect them to have alcoholism. If we were to apply these questions to my predicament, replacing booze with "guy" and drink with "date":  C: Cut Down. Do you ever feel like you need to cut down on the amount of boys you date?  Sometimes it does get a little hard to manage. And the withdrawal is a bitch.  A: Annoyed. Do you ever get annoyed when other people comment on the amount of people you date?  Only when they say bad stuff. Like "You'll never find a boyfriend that way" or "No wonder you're still single" or "You're such a slut" or "Why can't you be straight?"  G: Guilty. Do you ever feel guilty about dating all the guys that you do?  Starting to. I'm realizing that there is a distinct possibility I might actually go on a date with someone I like. And then I have to get rid of the riffraff.  E: Eye Opener. Do you ever have a man when you get up, first thing in the morning, in order to start your day?  No comment.  I was thinking about all of this because I think I have been rejected, on various levels, a record six times over the past 2 days. And I'm getting the shakes. It was like the hangover from a man-speedball.  Most people would be like...eh...you had six guys in limbo over the past 2 days, you certainly can pick up where you left off and replace them quickly. But me, being the addict that I am, get all dry-mouthed and frothy, and start to look all desperate while begging people for a piece of man-crack. I got all drunk and flirty at Berlin, and it was ridiculous, and more unsuccessful than it needed to be.  So, I almost quit cold turkey. I was so delirious that I locked my phone, made it so I could not do anything except receive calls and call my best friend, and nearly cried myself to sleep.  Fortunately, I woke up in the morning and decided that I was being totally ridiculous, unlocked my phone, and went to a barbecue with my friend Kevin. I've been thinking about my man-addiction treatment program. Cut back on the men? Attach a less potent man to my arm and wean myself off of them altogether? Or is cold turkey the answer?  The first thing I'm going to do is admit I have a problem.  I need help. As I was reading my psych text, I realize that some of my man problems have to do with a pattern I have of injustice collecting, i.e. look at the horrible way in which this man did me wrong, blah blah blah. I think that, while I attempt to be forgiving and understanding, it tends to be more important  for me to be the one done wrong in any given situation. It is comfortable for me, it is a way for me to regain control of a bad situation. Then, to avoid the horrible feeling, I just seek out another man, equally terrible, to replace the one I just lost. I'm not quite sure what the right way to be dumped is, but, if I find out, I'll let you know. Because, I'm one step away from being that crack ho who tells the boyfriend not to date anyone until I find someone. When I get to that point, somebody take me to the hospital.
