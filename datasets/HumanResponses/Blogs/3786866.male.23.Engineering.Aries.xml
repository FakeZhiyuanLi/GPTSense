      we then went HSBC where we were told that we r the 5th party and so will not be entertained and no information will be leaked.  disappointed we then went to koregaon but there also we din't find anybody....... our next target was MG road where we met with the manager of ARORA TOWERS and gave us many options as where to find such person. meanwhile we also had visit to AMBRO BANK where the receptionist  told us that she felt quite nice to meet us as we r doing MBA frm SYMBIOSIS.....but left her disappointed.  after that we went to PUNE-BOMBAY highway and went to companies called as ALVA LAVAL, ATLAS etc.....but they told us as it is the closing the executives r quite busy so they can't meet us.  but i really enjoyed talking to so many people convincing them to let me meet the higher official. moreover,i get to know how to deal with different sections of employers and how to deal them. i feel quite fortunate to be a part of such an exercise and hope that sir will keep giving us such type of learning,and catching experiences.
