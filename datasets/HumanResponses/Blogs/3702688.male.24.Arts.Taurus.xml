       I'm amazed. Somehow, not quite sure, I managed to acheive the change from 'highly employable' to 'not sure there's a place for you here' in record time. Twice. In as many weeks. I was holding down two jobs, one at a bar, one as a receptionist at a yoga centre. Things were going well. The yoga centre told me they were promoting me to 'yoga manager'.  But things went tits up when I had to leave at short notice twice and go abroad. The most recent was a trip to New York to do some photography. Paid phenomenally well, as I earned as much in 3 and a half days as I would have done in 9 months at the bar. When I had to let them know I couldn't do the two shifts the next week, they said that my commitment was in question (commitment is, apparantly, essential in a part-time barman). Fine, i figured. I was sad to leave, because i liked it there. Decent people to work with. A manageress that wasn't nearly as bad as the other bar managers I've worked for. Anal, but show me a manager that isn't.  New York was fantastic. Flew out business class, put up in a nice hotel opposite the Met on 5th Ave. Caught up with some friends. It was great, but I flew back to a frosty reception at the reception. I even flew back earlier than i would have, in order to make a shift on Friday, but was told that there was someone covering it. OK. Fine. I'm not pissed at that... much. But I went in for my shift today, and thats how I heard the news that I was fired. I guess i was getting slack anyway. I was meant to be there at 9, but i kinda overslept, having had a bit of a heavy one last night. My 9 o'clock shift ended up beginning at 11.30. oops. No worries, i'll explain it in an honest way. But when i got there, I see a sign up telling all that yoga is cancelled today. I phone around, and the word is that I am a bit persona non grata, that someone else has been hired. Finally, i get through to my boss, and she tells me that i'm fired. she just neglected to tell me before I do half of todays shift.  what next?
