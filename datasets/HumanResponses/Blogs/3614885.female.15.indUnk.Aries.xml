      Well.. i started off todae's training quite high after i read an article that there's going to be a "The Rose prt 2". That brightens my morning. During the first few physical it is still quite okay.. He (my senior, yes he came again todae.) haven crossed my limit.   Until the time where my grp crossed the time limit... he tell us to do 20 push-ups. WTF. I ran, put in&nbsp;my 100% effort.  AND I HATE BEING PUNISHED WHEN I HAD GIVEN MY BEST.&nbsp; WAD THE HELL HE WAN? If he got&nbsp;the 'nothing-is-impossible' thought, then immediately FLY&nbsp;&nbsp;using ur own hands n LET ME SEE!!  F*** him  ahh.. kanasai.  HE'S INHUMAN . Everybody haf our own limit in stamina wad, he cant expect everybody&nbsp;to run at the speed of light...   Den after the training, someone jux give my name out to kwek (tr-in-charge), sae i din train properly. PLZ LOR... WITH DAT KIND OF INHUMAN SENIOR, I WILL DIE EVEN BEFORE I SEE MY COFFIN. Shit him n HER! The   [BETRAYER]... it is of no wonder you have no TRUE friends... how [PATHETIC] are u...     And... no matter how u tok to me, I can  NEVER EVER &nbsp;&nbsp;be enthu in Badminton. Complain among urself for all u wan. I dun care, I dun even wan to care a .b.i.t.
