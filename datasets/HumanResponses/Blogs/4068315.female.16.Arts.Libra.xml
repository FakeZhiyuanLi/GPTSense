      Hmm wiffle ball tomorrow. I think it's still going to be going on.  I had asked Mike if he would join us, he said he couldn't. I thought he was just making an excuse at first, his excuse seemed loose and fishy. I felt rejected and miffed, and didn't talk to him much after that. I felt like just being mad at someone, I think the summer as turned me into a non-caring person. Not like I'm going to see him at least until school, so I don't find it necessary to be polite sometimes. I even stopped talking to most people I used to entirely. I'm happy with my small group of friends.  Anyway, I sorta feel like a moron for acting that way towards Mike last night.  And I need to start eating normal. I haven't eating a normal meal in awhile.  I need someone to slap me on the wrists and get me to read my books, I have about 19 days now, and I know I'm not going to get it done well. I don't want to start with a bad grade in my English class. English is the only real class that I can honestly do my best in, and actually put effort forth for. I really shouldn't be lazy like this.   So I'm going to promise myself to get through five chapters this evening, and try to start thinking about the essay topics. I was looking at them, and nothing seemed to be essayable, but it could be that I haven't given myself a chance to get farther into the book. I'm not even hlaf through yet.   I'm not sure how I'm going to do reading the Crucible. I've never read through a play that is written like that before. I've done the whole shakespere bit, but it's entirely different from this. A lot of people say plays are fun to read though, so I'm trying not to get a bad impression of it before I even start reading it.  And that's about it.

      Whoo hoo! Cheating on my livejournal. ( urlLink http://www.livejournal.com/users/somnambulauren )  It feels good. I'm starting to feel stalked and crampped on the ol' El-Jay. It's perfectly fine if I want to write something I don't mind others to see, but I like to have a little space on my own you know? I felt a little pushed around, influenced...Well maybe I was just feeling that way for awhile. I had cheated on lj before, with another lj account, then like a week later, took it down.&nbsp;   Weird. I might even like, abandon this in a week or month or so. Or I might keep it for a long time, I don't really know right now. I like to just let everything out and not care how long it's going to be, or who is going to read it, or what people are going to think.&nbsp; So, here it is. I hope I can figure out how to navigate it easily.  Oh well, I've had enough for now, I need to get to sleep, and need to get some reading done.

      I get shy in large groups of people I do not know.  Why am I shy? Because sometimes people, make fun of me when I just ...be.  So I keep quiet, around people I don't know.  And many people are nice, and get to know me.  And then there's Nazi kid.  Who's a fucking...pseudo-Nazi.

      I need to clone myself. I seem to be a terrible friend. I can't be everywhere at once though, and still spend my much needed down time on my own.  Erika's mad at me. Ashley says she's mad at me, and then she says she doesn't care.  I'd apologize, because I am an apologetic person. But I don't believe I have done anything wrong.  They are mad because I haven't called them a lot. Erika, I hung out with on Friday. She was at Kaitlin's house on Saturday.  She told me she was busy Sunday. Monday, I was home. Tuesday, I invited myself over to Karries to see her before she left for Mexico. I didn't go over until she got home around 3:00, and she said I had to leave around 7:00. I could tell she didn't want a bunch of people over, she had to go to sleep early, still had to do some packing, and wake up at 2:00 am. She had told me she was just going to watch some movies. Kaitlin called, on my way to Karries, so I told her about having to leave early, and that Karrie's just watching movies, she could probably join us, but call up Karrie.  So, no huge deal, I left early, said my goodbyes.  I talked to Erika online that night, asked her what she did that day. She said she went to see Harold and Kumar with Ellie and Chris. She asked me what I did. I told her I invited myself to Karries to watch some movies, and I had to leave early so she could get some sleep. I told her Kaitlin was over too. Erika got pissed, she said she was mad because she was left out again. After that, she stopped talking to me online, and soon got off.  Ashley im'ed me. She told me her and Erika were feeling left out. She said that if I didn't like her, I should tell her.  I told her I liked her. She asked why I never call her. I asked why she never calls me. Then she said something about friendship being a two way thing. At this point I realized that we could continue, like two year olds, to go back and forth forever, so I called a truce. Can I call a truce?  Anyway...I called up Kaitlin, at this point I was feeling pretty defenseless, and like a pretty crappy person. She told me Karrie had tried to call Erika.  And that they hung out with Erika on Saturday.  So now, I feel like I have done nothing wrong. Neither Erika, nor Ashley has ever called me during the summer to hang out. I always call them. If Karrie did call Erika...then...I can't figure out WHAT she'd have to be mad about.  And um, excuse me, I have many other friends that I haven't seen since the very begining of the summer. Getting pissed off at me, because I haven't seen you in three days, isn't going to make me want to see you sooner than anyone else.  Sorry I must prioratize, I'm feeling more like a bussiness woman, than a friend.

      I've been moody today. I was happy earlier, but I had that feeling that I was going to cry or be upset about something. I get like that sometimes. It's just a shocker why it happens randomly.  Anyway, I was jogging on my treadmill and listening to headphones, when my mom came downstairs. I slowed down while she was talking to me. She said she had to go out to pick up Cheryl. Julie was having a seizure, and they called an amubulance, and Cheryl had to go with because Julie was denying she had taken pills.  My mom told me she was going to drive up to South Suburban Hospital, and I asked her where that was, and what kind of neigborhood, because it's late, and I was worried about my mom driving there alone. She said it was the hospital Grandpa Feret was in, so I could understand where that was. My mom went back upstairs, and I started to think about my Grandpa again. Thinking about him always makes me cry. And I never thought I had my heartbroken before, but I realized now, that yes, I have.   I remember sitting with my dad at dinner one night, back when I was in 8th grade, and that's when my mom was working full time and overtime everynight, and couldn't even make it home for dinner. My brother was probably also working, or just out of the house, because he'd been having so many arguments with my parents. So it was just my dad and I eating dinner together. I remember asking him if he was taking off work the next day, or if he was going back. He said he was going to the hospital the next morning, so he could take care of some things with his dad, and he wouldn't be going to work. We didn't say anything else to eache other, and I remember seeing my dad's eyes tear up.  This was the first time I had ever seen my father cry. And sitting there at the dinner table, was the first time I've had my heartbroken.  The sharpest pain is losing your parents. Back in those weeks and months after my Grandpa passed away, I remember being so afraid for my own parents. I couldn't imagine losing them, and I knew if I did, I couldn't go on myself. My parents are my core. Sometimes I stop at times like this, when I'm by myself and reminded of someone I knew who died, I can't help but think I want to pause everything as it is. I'd get to live as I am now, and I wouldn't have to go through the loss of someone so close to me. With all the pain that I have from my Grandpa's death as it is, I can't yet understand how it was for my father.  I began to think also, of Karrie's dad. And I think, that hurts me even more. Since I became friends with her, and since I knew, I can never think of my own dad, without thinking of hers.  Counting as my second heartbreak, was when Mrs. Benda said something to me one day. I had a conversation with her, about a month before, about how I was upset I didn't get to see Big Fish while it was in the theater. She was gushing about how wonderful a movie it was, and how much I was going to enjoy it when I did get to see it.  About a month later, I talked to her again, and told her I finally saw it. She asked me what my favorite part was, and I told her it was the almost unbelieveable romantic parts, like when he first saw his wife at the circus. I remember her exact words, when she looked at me and whispered, "Oh Lauren, but it  really does  happen like that when you fall in love, everything else slowed down when I met my husband."  A little piece of my heart cracked off for Mrs. Benda.  So at this point in my jogging, I had made a mental list, of  the three people I would bring back now if I could.  Karrie's father Stacies twin, Tracy My Grandpa  And that's really where it ends. I'm not waiting for the time when I lose someone so near to me, my heart is burried with them. I want to kick myself in the shins, for never giving tighter hugs,  holding longer conversations, and smiling more. I need to work on my affection.
