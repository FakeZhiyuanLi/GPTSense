      DUYAN   Narito sa opisina, Linggo, may mga gagawin. Dapat. Pero heto, nakikinig kay Manong Joey. Kanina pag punta ko sa kanila para kunin ang album, hindi ko alam kung paano ko babanggitin ang pangalan niya sa anak na bumungad sa akin: Joey A... Mr. A.... Joey Ayala.   Sa wakas, ang album na bukas ay nasa Mindanao na, sa gabing ito, nasa kamay ko muna, kasama sa pag-iisa.   Sa husay ng kalabit sa kuwerdas at sa maamong tinig , tinatangay ang isip ko palabas sa konkretong kinalalagyan. Ang mga musikero at ang kanilang kababalaghan. Salamat sa Diyos at naisipan niyang isama sila sa kanyang listahan ng mabubuting bagay sa mundo.   Naalala ko noong Hunyo nang akon'y nasa Misamis Oriental para sa isang training. Pagkatapos ng isang araw ng pagiiscuba diving, may oras para humimlay sa mga lambat na duyang nakatali sa mga puno. Pagkatapos ng duyan ng tubig, hangin naman. Aaaayyyyy, sarap ng alaala.   Para sa kaibigang tatanda sa Martes, ay kaypalad. Para sa kanya ang unang kopya. Kaibigang bigay ng biyaheng iyon sa Misamis Oriental. Kaibigang baka magpapaalam na naman sa Disyembre. Haaaaayyyyy, buhay.   Ang duyan ng buhay. Hindi namang masarap na nakahiga doon parati. Nakakahilo pag tagal nang nakatitig sa langit at malamig na kapag naabutan ka ng gabi. Ngunit masarap na isiping nandiyan lang sa tabi pag kailangan mong tumigil, manahimik, magpahinga.

      BAKASYON GRANDE   Kahapon ginamit ko ang forced-leave credit ko sa opisina. Forced talaga dahil tatlong linggo na ng overtawad at wala halos sabado at linggong hindi ako pumupunta sa opis. Kinailangan na ng magpumulit ng aking katawang papagpahingahin siya ng aking baluktot na isipan.   Bukas, lilipad ako patungong Cebu. Oo Cebu "B"-- linya sa isang lumang TV commercial sa mga nakakatanda pa. Ang sarap sanang magnakaw ng panahon para tumawid na rin papuntang Dumaguete pero hindi mangyayari. Wala ang aking dapat na tour guide.   Isang hamon din ang binigay ko sa sarili para sa biyaheng ito. Dapat isang bag lang ng gamit ang dala, dahil overnight lang naman. Naisip ko, pangarap ko nga palang maging isang jetsetter. Sabi ng Hyperdictionary, "JET SET Definition: [n] a set of rich and fashionable people who travel widely for pleasure". Yan ang gusto kong maging. Yung pag naisipang gustong pumunta sa ganito at ganyang lugar, handa ang pasaporte, walang iniisip na hahadlang trabaho na maiiwan, walang bagaheng mabibigat: shirt, shorts, bikini at ngiting nakapinta hanggang sa langit.   Noong isang araw, bago naalala ng aking tumatandang utak na may lakad nga ako sa Cebu, biglang kinati ang aking paa, sa isip nakaramdam ng biglang pangungulila sa pagbibiyahe. Inakalang hindi ko na ito magagawa dahil sa Nobyembre, balik eskuwela ako. Tapos kahapon lang, nanonood ng palabas sa TV tungkol sa ganda ng ibang lugar, naisip ko na naman, ang sarap magbiyaheng bakasyon ang dahilan. Yung wala kang dapat tapusin munang trabaho bago magpakasaya. Yung bang unang hakbang palang ng paa palabas ng pinto, wala ng sasayangin kundi sa pagsasaya.   Sa Nobyembre, umaasa akong isang bakasyon na rin yun. Isang buwang madaliang pag-aaral ng isang kursong dapat sana ay isang taon. Hmmm, paanong mangyayari ang aking bakasyon? Marami raw pag-aaralan, mga kilay na susunugin para masulit ang dolyares na inutang ng bayan para ipangmatrikula ko. Utang na utang ko rin. Pero kahit ganoon, bakasyon pa rin. Walang mga kontratang hahabulin, gagawan ng sulat at ipagmamakaawa at ipagpepenitensiyang pirmahan ng mga diyos at diyosa sa gobyerno. Walang mga buhay na iisipin dahil nakakabit sa mga papeles na nakatambak sa aking mesa. Walang magulong kuwartong uuwian at paulit-ulit na iisipin kung saan sisimulang lilinisin.   Kaso, kakambal ng bakasyon ay pamamaalam. Paalam sandali sa magulong buhay. Tapos, maya-maya lang, paalam na naman sa katahimikan at sa pamamahinga. Nakakapagod, gugustuhin mo uling magbakasyon.   Sabi ng aming piloto sa opisina, kapag nasa Cebu na, huwag kalimutang tikman ang beer doon. May kakaibang sarap raw. Maaring sa tubig na ginagamit. Naisip ko, oo nga, teka, Octoberfest at wala pa akong tagayang pinagpiyestahan. Bukas nga kabawasan sa aking alcohol quota. May magpapainom, walang hahawak ng aking baso. Pero tiyak may kabawasan din sa saya ng kanilang gabi.   Sabi rin pala sa akin, ang Beer Grande ay nagsimula sa Cebu. Hmmm, parang napapaisip ako. Kelan kaya darating ang araw na magtatagpo ang Bakasyon at Grande?   Pag dumating iyon, sasabayan ko ng awit ng isang lumang kanta, "Come Fly with Me" ......

      ISYU LANG   "I was heading towards Lefty but a group started asking him questions. It was Ely Buendia, his wife and their kid. The kid was cute I was standing a couple of paces from them."   Hiniram ko mula sa --paanipedro.blogspot.com--.   Hay, buhay nga naman. Ang kinabaliwan ko sa college bago pa man siya inangkin ng masa, aba'y tatay na.  Samantala. Eto ako. Namamangha pa rin sa relasyon ng iba. Nag-aabang pero kasabay ring isinusuko ang anumang posibilidad na darating rin ako roon.   Ang mga lalaki sa buhay ko, ang karamihan dumaan nang hindi man lang namalayang dumaan sila. Na sinundan ko sila ng tingin. Hindi naman sa pinag-isipan ko sila ng masama pero kasinungalingan kung di ko sasabihing hindi ko sila tinawag na mga hangal at bulag at walang kuwenta nang di nila pinatulan ang mga tingin ko.   Ngayon, napapansin ko, aba, may bago akong isyu tungkol sa mga lalaking pinagtutuunan ko ng pansin. Ewan ko ba pero, sila yung mga madaling kagaangan ng loob, maalalahanin, masarap kausap pero masarap ding kasama lang sa katahimikan. Ayos na sana 'no? Kaso sila rin yung misteryoso ang dating, yung kaya tuloy pinahihinalaan na para bang may mga itinatago sa kung saan, partikular na e sa kung ano...tulad na lang ng isang aparador. Pero tulad ng mga nakasarang pinto, puro hinuha lamang ang mahahawakan mo at yun ang nakakabaliw. Partikular eto sa isang tao hanep kung pagukulan ko ng panahon at kung anek-anek pa, ikanga ng isang "masayang" kaibigan.   Nasabi ko na minsan, na sa akin, sa edad kong ito, hindi na isyu ang oryentasyon. Kaya nga ba nagpapagkasya ko ang saya ko sa anumang maliit na pahiwatig na pinaaabot sa aking daraanan.   Pero isyu kapag ang saya biglang dumadausdos. Lalo na kung dahil sa mga maliliit na datos na nakakalap na kapag pinagtagpi-tagpi ay bumubuo ng larawang masakit ang kulay sa mata, tulad na lamang ng fuschia. Bakit ba kailangan pa yung idagdag e sa simpleng spektrum ng liwanag, wala naman iyon? Kahit pa sister niya ang kulay na rosas, nunca naging kaaya-aya iyon sa aking paningin. Isyu talaga.   Ay sa madaling salita, ano na nga bang sinasabi ko? Na apektado ako, may mga minamahal na at pamilya ang aking mga kakontemporaryo at ako ay wala pa. Wala na nga dahil limitado and oportunidad, at kung nagkakataong meron, di kami talo. Talo ako. Iyon ang isyu...

       BLEEDING TO LIFE    I remember one retreat speaker tells us this remark she heard from a man.  He says he finds it amazing how women can actually bleed for 5 days and not die. I've got to give him credit for such introspection.  I've got my second day of period.  It's a particlarly heavy but none of those terrible pains for once.  May be this is why I've this capacity to look at it with grace and seeing red made me realize the power that flows from me as a woman  Even if that cycle means another one less from my resources (there goes another egg down the drain),  another could-be life not met, still I am grateful.  It is a reminder that I have the gift to help bring life.  Maybe not now or not anytime soon but the possibility remains.  For now, if there is a resource that I am learning to give birth to, its name is Patience.  A few nights ago, I had this dream.  I was trying to go up some uneven thing.  It was a difficult climb.  I felt my side hurt after.  Just then a panic thought came.  I am pregnant, I forgot.  A life is within and I forgot.  I felt all of me suddenly have only thought and concern and love and fear for that which is inside my body.  I never thought it could feel as real and as close as that.   I've always feared the thought of carrying another life. For the pain, for the discomfort, for the risks, the could-be tragedies and the what-nows.   But remembering that dream on my way to work, I felt again the power of that feeling within.  Dreamt, imagined, hoped for, feared. While it sits inside in silence, it speaks, and breathes and beats at my breast, my womb and my veins and I felt my eyes bleed.      ----------- Image Source: Google.com/www.4girls.gov

       BORED, DRAINED AND PAINFULLY SINGLE   It is early evening of Saturday in my time zone.  Had to be in the office and that is ok.  I've got tons of work I need to finish, work that I like doing and that I believe in.  But what is bothersome is this thought that I have no gimick to go to afterwards, no friends available to accompany me not even for a simple movie date or cup of coffee.   But as great single women would have it, there's just too much good attitude to opt for.  With the CD-ROM, I suddenly found Spiral Starecase keeping me company and keeping me sane enough to dance the night away in my office cubicle.  Then there were the texts for and from my birthday brother.   Me - "So what do you want, a small cake or a small ice-cream?"  He's reply -- "of course a big cake and a big ice cream".  Cute.    Well still all of the above, toss in hungry but couldn't say I am not grateful.

       Original manuscript created  Friday the 13th, 2004  11:46 PM     On the eve of my 33rd Valentine-less Valentine’s Day, I launch this campaign. No, this is not the same environmental cause that Silliman University embarked with Ford or HP Foundation. But it is somehow related. Even if only vaguely. Well for one, it’s about conservation.    RATIONALE: Seahorse is one of those creatures catalogued to be threatened if not fast becoming extinct. It is said to be a most sought after commodity for its medicinal and economic value. But more than these, this aquatic creature possesses great qualities to be admired in this generation of metrosexuals: it is monogamous and it’s the male species that carry the maternal burden.   Now what does it have to do with me? Well, not only to me but to a hundred thousand other single women out there waiting for that one true elusive love. We barf at the thought, so we independent women say, but alone in our room, sick with flu while the rest of coupledom is busy braving the traffic and foolishly being affectionate, we sigh with such sighing even the dead would wake up before judgment day.   In this day and age of halfhearted vows, FFs and KFs and all sorts of intimacy play but no commitment for and during a lifetime, of single, straight and secure men fast disappearing, we can only continue to hold on to our childlike hope and faith. A magnificent, beautiful seahorse waits as I wait.   OBJECTIVES: (1) To devise means by which one’s self will never give up on finding one’s seahorse; (2) To put in mind that oneself is good and deserve no less better than one truly desire for; (3) To never stop in growing as an individual, loving and allowing one’s self to be loved.   STRATEGIES: (1) Create a life outside of the workplace; (2) Renew constantly ties with friends and welcome and even make opportunities for new relationships; (3) Choose wisely the relationships that would be given extra attention, time and consideration, asking if there’s a future with it worth pursuing; (4) Be thankful for all the special though temporary relationships that come and hold it with fondness but not to cling to it.   There are more postings to come. For now, I end with these. For the first time in years, I noticed a lone star outside my window directly across where I lie in bed every night. Next to the window is this glow-in-the-dark star I placed a couple of years back. There were two stars then, a kind of a silent wish for a heart’s desire back then and though there is only one left, still the desire remains. And since I’ve never given up on my childhood, I look now on these two stars that are on my same visual plane, one out there and real though might have already burned light years and light years away and one that’s stuck on my wall glowing after I turn off the lights and dream my dreams.       Happy Valentine’s Day Nanay…I love and miss you still       1:14am  St. Valentine’s Day          &nbsp;  &nbsp;    -------------------------  * The beautiful image was sourced from www.barbjanisch.com/ seahorse.html

       OH BROTHERS!     Amazing how songs find their way to you like a child that suddenly climbs up your lap  just when you're trying to remember what it is that has just crossed your mind.  It's for those moments when there is that that you feel but just couldn't name.    For us who've been there, and are still there, here's an Ira and George Gershwin creation (and I thought they're wife and husband team).  They too are responsible for another song that speaks to some lone figures in some dark corners, Someone to Watch Over Me.  Comfort while your hands beat away on keyboards on a night of all work and nothing else in sight.    * *  But Not for Me  They're writing songs of love,  but not for me.  A lucky star's above,  but not for me.  With love to lead the way  I've found more clouds of grey  than any Russian play could guarantee.  I was a fool to fall and get that way;  Heigh-ho! Alas! And also, lack-a-day!  Although I can't dismiss  the mem'ry of his kiss,  I guess he's not for me.   He's knocking on a door,  but not for me.  He'll plan a two by four,  but not for me.  I know that love's a game;  I'm puzzled, just the same,  was I the moth or flame?  I'm all at sea.  It all began so well, but what an end!  This is the time a feller needs a friend,  (this time a girl could sure use a friend) when ev'ry happy plot ends with the marriage knot,  and there's no knot for me.       ----------- Image1 Source: http://treasuringmemories.com/images/Die_cuts/My_Minds_Eye/My_hero/Big_hero_star.jpg This image may be subject to copyright. http://treasuringmemories.com/Die_cuts_pages/MME_My_Hero.htm  Image2 Source: http://images-eu.amazon.com/images/P/0306807394.01.LZZZZZZZ.jpg This image may be subject to copyright.  http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0306807394/geometrynet-21

       CHILDREN'S SOUP FOR THE SINGLE&nbsp;SOUL&nbsp;  &nbsp;   The kind of&nbsp;men I've been blessed, or cursed (depending&nbsp;on what season I am in and what they've done right or wrong) to have encountered&nbsp;can be described in the context of &nbsp;acronyms--HHWW, TNT, SOB, and as&nbsp;declared by the&nbsp;Guinness Book of World Records&nbsp;to be the world's longest acronym,&nbsp;  NIIOMTPLABOPARMBETZHELBETRABSBOMONIMONKONOTDTEKHSTROMONT &nbsp; (as found from the Concise Dictionary of Soviet Terminology, which translates to&nbsp;"The laboratory for shuttering, reinforcement, concrete and ferroconcrete operations for composite-monolithic and monolithic constructions of the Department of the Technology of Building-assembly operations of the Scientific Research Institute of the Organization for building mechanization and technical aid of the Academy of Building and Architecture of the USSR").   A jargon of their own.&nbsp;&nbsp;But apart from a&nbsp;particular context, meaningless. They come &nbsp;stringed,&nbsp;punctuated or not, initialized, abbreviated or assimilated.&nbsp;&nbsp;Annoying but has a purpose.&nbsp;&nbsp;   And so it is fascinating the first time I heard these&nbsp;guys whose work I borrow below. I thought, wow, scorned angry men and&nbsp;no abstractions about it.&nbsp;&nbsp;Candid and honest&nbsp;without being pathetically syrupy about it. That's something new.&nbsp; My kind of men.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   I've yet to read about their demography, politics&nbsp;&nbsp;and psychology so I beg your indulgence.&nbsp; I am merely basing these&nbsp;from what I've heard on their other tracks.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No painted whitewashed paradise. More like&nbsp;overcast to stormy skies.&nbsp;&nbsp;The female face isn't even painted well in some instances but still I am drawn to listen.   There&nbsp;is so much to &nbsp;relate to.&nbsp;For one, I &nbsp;feel like I&nbsp;am the reason for those songs coming to existence.&nbsp;&nbsp;You can sue me if you think otherwise. But if you too are single,&nbsp;full-blooded, biologically&nbsp;female, and all-too-100%-complex-wanting-simplicity,&nbsp;you are free to&nbsp;relate.&nbsp;   So from&nbsp; A.C.R.O.N.Y.M.S. &nbsp;to&nbsp;ABC soup.&nbsp; It's not sweet. It isn't supposed to be.&nbsp;&nbsp;Some salt, some spice. Comfort&nbsp; food.&nbsp; Childlike joy floating on warm, clear, light perspective.&nbsp;&nbsp;Have some.&nbsp;It's rainy out there.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    &nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;      Must Get Out.Maroon5. I’ve been the needle and the threadWeaving figure eights and circles round your headI try to laugh but cry insteadPatiently wait  to hear the words you’ve never said Fumbling through your dresser drawer forgot what I was looking forTry to guide me in the right directionMaking use of all this timeKeeping everything insideClose my eyes and  listen to you cry I'm lifting you upI'm letting you downI'm dancing till dawnI'm fooling aroundI'm not giving upI'm making your loveThis city's made us crazy and we must get outThis is  not goodbye  she saidIt is  just time for me to rest  my headShe does not walk she runs insteadDown these jagged streets and into my bedFumbling through your dresser drawer  forgot  what I was looking forTry to  guide me in the right direction Making use of all this timeKeeping everything insideClose my eyes and listen to you cryI'm lifting you up I'm letting you down I'm dancing till dawn I'm fooling around I'm not giving upI'm making your loveThis city’s made us crazy and we must get outThere’s only so much I can do for youAfter all of the things you put me through I'm lifting you up I'm letting you down I'm dancing till dawn I'm   fooling around I'm not giving up I'm making your loveThis city’s made us crazy and we must get outI'm lifting you upI'm letting you downI'm dancing till dawnI'm fooling aroundI'm not giving up I'm making your love This city’s made us crazy and we must get out   &nbsp;  ----------  Info Source:  urlLink http://www.wordiq.com/definition/Acronym   Image Source:  urlLink http://images.google.com.ph/imgres?imgurl=http://www.toddparr.com/imgs/gallery/abcsoup.gif     Another thing caught my attention on the WordIQ site.&nbsp;  Check it out.&nbsp; Again&nbsp;us on the map :)&nbsp;   urlLink http://www.wordiq.com/definition/Acronyms_in_the_Philippines

       H A P P Y.&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;        That's how I am these days.&nbsp; I could still cry over this someone&nbsp; I finally chose to give up but no longer out of despair.&nbsp; I could still cry over work but frustration would no longer be the motivation.  &nbsp;  I looked over to where his table is and rejoiced at the thought, finally I can fall again.&nbsp; Fall down hard&nbsp;possibly. Yet find comfort in knowing that it&nbsp;can cause another inch of growth.&nbsp; Or growth spurt.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  I paused and thought I've been happy for a whole week now and not exactly because of the possibility of romance but simply because I see myself capable of going through the ugliest and most miserable of feelings and situations, run away almost for dear life and in it all had the courage to go back and face what's seething beneath.&nbsp;&nbsp;   Yes, I am a woman.&nbsp; To my mind going 4o and all things in between.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   I am a hammock and a trampoline.  I am company and solitude.  I am power and surrender.     Ah great great to be a woman.  &nbsp;  --------------  Image Source:  urlLink http://images.google.com.ph/imgresimgurl=http://www.toddparr.com/imgs/gallery/abcsoup.gif

      ------------------------ mula sa aking baul...     Nais kong di ka umimik: na parang di ka narito At marinig mo ako mula sa malayo at ang tinig ko’y di ka maabot Para bang ang mga mata mo’y  lumipad papalayo At parang isang halik ang nagtupi ng iyong bibig  Kung paanong ang lahat ng bagay ay puno ng aking kaluluwa Ikaw ay nagmumula sa mga bagay, puno ng aking kaluluwa Paruparo ng guni-guni, tulad ka ng aking kaluluwa At katulad ka ng salitang -- lumbay  Nais kong di ka umimik, at mukha ka ngang malayo  Para bang ika’y nanaghoy, isang paruparo, humuhuning parang ibon At narinig mo ako sa malayo, at ang tinig ko di ka maabot: Hayaan mo akong lumapit at di umimik kasama ng iyong katahimikan   At hayaan mo akong kausapin ka sa iyong pananahimik Na sing-liwanag ng gasera,  payak tulad ng singsing. Tulad ka ng gabi, ng mga konstelasyong walang kibo Ang iyong pananahimik parang bituin, malayo at  walang tinatago  Nais kong di ka umimik: na parang di ka narito Malayo at labis ang lungkot na para bang ikaw ay namatay Kaya isang salita lang,  isang ngiti, tama na. At ako’y masaya, masayang hindi yuon totoo.    SALIN MULA SA TULA NI PABLO NERUDA 6/21/01       I LIKE FOR YOU TO BE STILL Pablo Neruda    I like for you to be still It is as though you were absent And you hear me from far away And my voice does not touch you It seems that your eyes have flown away And a kiss has sealed your mouth As all things are filled with my soul You emerge from the things filled with my soul You are like my soul A butterfly of dream And you are like the word — melancholy  I like for you to be still And you seemed far away It sounds as though you were lamenting A butterfly cooing like a dove And you hear me from far away  And my voice does not reach you Let me come to be still in your in silence And let me talk to you with your silence That is bright as a lamp, simple as a ring You are like the night With its stillness and constellations Your silence is that of a star As remote and candid  I’d like for you to be still It is as though you were absent Distant and full of sorrow As though you had died One word then, one smile is enough And I’m happy, happy that it’s not true.

He leads her away, as the edges of what is familiar in the hospital corridor become fuzzy, suffused with light. . .   SETH Can I ask you something?   SUSAN Yes.   SETH What did you like best?   SUSAN (thinking) Pajamas.     ------------------------- 1998 city of angels 1998 nanay 1998 j

      ---------------------------------------------------------------- i almost passed up this time to post something for today  how could i? it's a FOOLMOON night!!!!  though sad still to remember  the significance of today's number ...  in a little while  i'm going to the launch of joey ayala's love song album heard it's quite a collection (well i've got my album collection, collecting dust... love collection??? hmmm---next item please)  in a little while, i'll be walking home  alone  marveling at the moon again  " hi MOON... "   i'd say as i've said before for not less than 59 times   and then would go missing two people  one who was as foolish as that sphere hanging so far away one who was as beautiful as the light that travels to visit so silently  but both so loved  so missed still  foolish love songs  on a full moon  mine  and theirs   for nanay & j  from wherever spot you both are hope you get to listen to them and hear my foolishness loving you still

      ---------------  hey, it's a new year's entry but i guess flashbacks are what i'm most up to these days  i don't know might be my sick, fatalistic, tragic-oriented mind that's causing me some paranoia about 2004 that from last year that's a good one to... well let me not  mention it lest the power of words   year 2003 is something to be remembered with fondness and then there is 1998 it was a year in black but something i will not want erased either  because of sentiments such as these  from an october 18 journal entry     back to saturday of october 18...      I am going back to writing-- if only for my sanity.  No matter how bad it may turn out, still I will write.  I will write with all that I can share.  Write with pictures if I can't do it with words.  The important thing is to never stop to get in touch with a medium without  so as to reach that which is so hidden within.  I am writing that I may be helped to remember, that forgetting would not be as often.  That my memory would serve me right would be something definite and not with a question mark.  I am writing and will write again with light.  Go back to film, to animate and be alive again no matter how much death there is in life.  I just gotta write. Write til its all right.

        IT WAS A GOOD NUMBER   &nbsp;   Original Manuscript started  24 July 2004  Cagayan de Oro City     I am letting go of 33 in a few hours.&nbsp; And here I am spending the morning writing on my txt journal, feet and legs in the air, tummy on the bed, mind on the memories of years past and burnt heart set on being gratefully happy.&nbsp; If I could only press my oxygen-starved brain onto these pages and let all its taho-like content seep into them..   It is good to be alone.&nbsp;&nbsp;No one but myself present to myself. It is good to laze around in my sleepwear and not be harassed by the thought of my hotel's check out time nor by my plane's etd.&nbsp; I lie on my back from time to time and look up, out my window and see clouds that look back at me.         Christ died at 33.&nbsp; September of 2003, I had nothing but thoughts&nbsp;of death and dying.&nbsp; And in between Christ and dying, it's amazing how obsessed one can be about so many things.&nbsp; In my younger years, I wanted to be a missionary.&nbsp;&nbsp; A few years later, I&nbsp;want to be the blackest black sheep in town.&nbsp;&nbsp;Those were the &nbsp;few years&nbsp;when all I had were deaths.&nbsp;   I recently rediscovered C.S. Lewis'  A Grief Observed .&nbsp; Once again I felt connected.&nbsp; My life is never without a&nbsp;link&nbsp;to someone else's.&nbsp; I am never truly alone though I am always&nbsp;gifted with some time for solitude.&nbsp; And though I feel like being dead&nbsp;to the world and the world to me, it is never truly as I feel.&nbsp; So long as some individual&nbsp;is happy as he or she lies on her bed thinking the best of days or someone is out there rushing on the street eager to be someplace else,&nbsp; so long as these things happen, life happens.&nbsp; And even when death comes to pay a visit, it is so that life may be welcomed in&nbsp;another's.&nbsp; &nbsp;   Life&nbsp;and death. At times it is good to see them both as companion.&nbsp; Not one any less than the other.   &nbsp;    &nbsp;  HERE&nbsp;IS MY LIFE-DEATH-LIFE LIST FOR 33RD YEAR:&nbsp;   &nbsp;  First niece turned 1 in July, a year earlier tried to she really made it a point to rush out and&nbsp;make&nbsp;it still &nbsp;in time&nbsp;for&nbsp;my&nbsp;birth month&nbsp;  Another&nbsp;niece came in October, my Tatay and Nanay's &nbsp;birthmonth&nbsp;  August,&nbsp;5 years of Nanay being&nbsp;physically away from us&nbsp;  Went back to school in November, less than 30 days of learning about&nbsp;development work&nbsp;and&nbsp;developing relationships  Fell in love for the&nbsp;2nd time, almost fell for the 3rd  3 days before birthday, gained 3&nbsp;new friends  Another death among friends just after New Year&nbsp;  Revelations about 3&nbsp;friends whom I will never look at the same way again but love&nbsp;&nbsp;nonetheless&nbsp;  Countless friends who have stuck throught he years and&nbsp;new ones whom I feel will stick&nbsp;  One CV passed to about 3 possible employers   138 photos, 31&nbsp;trackbacks, 1 lifeline&nbsp;moblog community&nbsp;   &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
