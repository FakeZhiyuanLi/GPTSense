      (This title is gay..but hmm can u think of nething better?) Ya I kno u can, shut up...  I cant WAIT to try out for FH... and I hope i make it cause i just gotta new $$$1oo$$$ dollar stick! hehe And in case you didn't get the message: new sn :: FHXCgirl2009, but i'm betting all of you got it...( I think i got the point across now didn't I?) Well, Maine was as usual not much to do weekend...ugh...and of course WE HAVE 2 go every SINGLE weekend!! Because, even if the weather is bad "it's till 'relaxing' " Quote on quote mom. I spent my nights swimming in the pool and listening to the band, and listening to the neighbor's POLICE radio...its reallllyyy cool cause u can listen to whats going on around the town, on the ocean, and in the airplanes, like they have the Coastguard, the Police, the Ambulances, firetrucks, and the army plane things so its cool cause u could hear like who was hurt and accidents and such! Its really fun, and I want one really bad, but its like $$$200$$$...YiKes!  &nbsp; Sooo we were driving home and this traffic was sllow and it was just on a side road n we were like wat the f? There was a frikin CLYDSEDALE running along side of the road with a guy and a girl and i was like why the heck would that be happening? But me n my mom were like IDK! haha  &nbsp; ...When you smile, I melt inside...  &nbsp; -::-Sam-::-

Moving on to the next activity, Field Hockey camp, man tomorrow is the last day, and im really sad! This has been a blast this whole week!! We just worked on shuttles and weaves and stuff, then watched the bigger kids do a scrimmage and basically sat in the shade and talked about the game in general 'cause it was unbelievably  hot ... I thought I was gonna die!! Then the Rimol's dropped me off @ home..(felt good!) Then I ended up going over Jessi's house...we ate lunch and I watched her blow a kiss to her Orlando Bloom poster before we left for the pool..LoL! The pool was soo fun theres a big curly waterslide and a high diving board and then they dropped me off here! Jessi let me borrow the JoJo CD, so I loaded the whole things onto iTunes and now I just hhaavvee to buy it! hehe Happy Birthday mommy!!!  Mwaa! :-*  &nbsp; .:::*sam*:::.  &nbsp;  ...he told me he loved me, he called me his breezy...   ~JoJo
