						   Its getting real nasty out there. This has to be the worst election year in the history of the U.S.. I'm not going to reiterate all the stupid things said on both sides, nor am I going to repeat the lies from both parties. Let me just say, I don't want another reckless 4 years with Bush. On the other hand, I don't want 4 years with Kerry. But these are my choices. What I believe WILL happen after one of these bafones gets elected. The people will rise up, get it together, and find a true leader for our country...out of the shit grows daffodiles! Hang on, its only going to smell worse during the next four years.

						   Hopefully I don't become obsessed about entering info daily here...truth be told, there is nothing on TV. Saw an interesting personal license plate "No Klu"...someone obviously not familiar with american culture. Well thats kind of on par with some restaurants in my neighborhood "The Edibles" and "Veg Table" (more wacky bad english interpretations to come). Ok, now I'm on a roll! Lets get into some little things that piss me off. In L.A. someone decided to memorialize freeways to dead cops and people of inerest. Now, I'm not insensitive to a cop being killed on the job, but do we really have to name a freeway after them? They chose there job, and knew the risk...I'm sorry. I'm sure I will not be allowed to get my street re-named after my dead cat! And the "Rosa Parks Freeway"? Did I miss her bus ride on the 10 freeway when I was growing up? Now what WOULD be cool...commercial freeways. Taking the Tide freeway east to the Viagra interchange north to connect to the Budweiser freeway east...ahh, home at last.

						   Ok, I'm a little nervous as this is my first blog post ever! Please bear with me! The purpose of this blog is to allow me to vent my daily observations.To those who know me, these would not be the "Happy" positive things I see but the negative cynical things with hopefully a twist of dry humor mixed in. I am not Politically Correct, nor am I Racist. Just an honest opinionated asshole! Those who are offended by my remarks. The hell with you. Leave; this is MY forum! --Thanks
