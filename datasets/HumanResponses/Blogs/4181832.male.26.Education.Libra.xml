      Well, I bought my plane ticket back to Flint yesterday. It's going to be nice to see my family again. Of course, as soon as I had my ticket I talked to my sister and learned that home sweet home has become more disturbing than ever. It's hard for Flint to shock me--we're talking about a city that considered selling the trees in its parks for lumber, but I'm actually starting to get scared. A friend's cousin was beaten to death in his car in front of his eight-year-old son. One of the editors at the magazine my sister writes her vegan cooking column for was beaten to near-death and left in the street. Oh, and two women were found dead, one downtown and the other near Mott Park. Mott Park for God's sake! My favorite neighborhood in Flint. Where I always wanted to live. Where I went to school. Where my sister and brother-in-law just bought a house. I always look forward to going home, but this time I'm getting an ominous, horror-movie feeling. I'm learning to appreciate Mankato more and more. I think I'll just stay in Flint long enough to see  Hamlet  (which I'm sure will be excellent) and then I'll head to the Saint Clair River Delta, relax on the island and watch the freighters float by. Oh and play with as many dogs as possible before I come back to No-pets-in-every-lease-ville, U.S.A.

      I finally gave in. I spent six years in a Theatre department (I wasn't the most devoted student) and somehow avoided Karaoke, but last night I made my way down to the Bandana Brewery in lovely Mankato for Tuesday night karaoke. It was just as bad as I thought it would be. I know some people go for the comedy aspect, but to me it just seemed sad, not to mention new-countryish. I mean, I don't want to hear the Dixie Chicks sing a Dixie Chicks song; why would I want to hear tone-deaf drunkards sing a Dixie Chicks song. The one bright spot was the older couple who sang classic country. They had pipes. The guy did a nicely phrased version of  Folsom Prison Blues , and the woman did a sweet and sad  Crazy.  It almost made it worth sitting through the 5'6" cat in shades who jerked his shoulders through Metallica.
