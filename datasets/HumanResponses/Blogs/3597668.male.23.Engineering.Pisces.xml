      Too much for tonight.  Too private.  Too late.

      I'm ashamed... it's been too long since I've posted.  It's mostly due to my long weekend away from home, but I still don't want to let myself get away from this.  I treat blogging like a chore.  Not that it's a matter of drudgery like, say, doing other peoples' dishes, but that it's important to do on a regular basis, like, say, cleaning your ears.  But more fun.  Like, brushing your teeth with charcoal.  Because that's the best alternative when you're in the middle in the woods.  Swear to God.  Time to get some sleep.  I must remind myself to talk about the weekend, because it involved rock stardom and shitloads of alcohol.

      I am finally able to discern what I need to achieve contentment on the microscopic scale: the solace of femininity.  I kissed a girl tonight that I would not have expected to kiss, had someone told me I would be doing so by the end of the evening. She was a friend of a friend's sister, and someone whose company I always enjoyed, but that was the extent of it.  Acquaintanceship.  We haven't seen each other in over a year, but tonight ended up cuddling around a campfire and singing songs together to a crowd of enchanted onlookers.  The night was tangible with energy, and it was all thanks to the fledgling chemistry we cultured in our mutual love of music.  It was such a simple thing to experience, and will more than likely lead to nothing more than a continued friendship, but it is no matter; just sharing that connection allowed me to usher out a long series of stresses and frustrations I'd been harboring.  It doesn't take sex; it doesn't take a girlfriend; it's simply feeling that someone else is drawn to you.  As long as I can keep finding that on a regular basis, I won't have to be so worried about the lack of sex or of a girlfriend.  Hmm, I bet it's more likely I'll find one of the latter two before finding a different instance of the former each time I'm out with friends.  But it's like the lotto: hey, you never win.  Or something like that...

      Several of my close friends have decided to return to an old tradition of ours: we devote one night a week to spend together, as a means to keep ourselves entertained.  In effect it strenghthened the group and bolstered our friendships.  We stopped after a long string of drama and interpersonal quarrel, but those who affected those difficult times are no longer in our collective sphere of influence.  Yet, the Tuesday Night ritual remained dormant.  Finally it's coming back, and I must say I had a little apprehension about the idea.  Part of me said, "It won't be the same".  But then rationale kicked in: "It shouldn't be the same".  So many of my nights have been spent pining over fantastic memories, that they are just memories and no longer tangible... but that's the thing about melancholy.  The best you can get from it is a desire to feel that way again, and the only way to do that is to create new memories.    Of course it's easier said than done, I know, as one cannot "plan" a truly great night -- one of those holy moments that come from the proper combination of energy and spirit -- with much better than a 1 out of ten success rate.  They have to be inspired by something beautiful.  Luck is, unfortunately, requisite as well, but hell, I've been a part of so many of such nights in the past; there's nothing to suggest that they will stop happening in my life.  That's especially true now that I have such a motivation to be a part of that process again.

      I thrive on involvement in the music industry.  At the moment, I am a member of two musical entourages: Joe Unglued (an acoustic duo with my long term partner-in-crime Joe Farnsworth), and The Jones Effect (a modern rock power-trio founded by brothers Eric and Josh Arnold).  Since The Jones Effect is a fledgling entity at the moment (recently rebirthed from the ashes of Kings Joker, a Brockport-based group into which I was brought to play bass guitar), we have lots of preliminary work to do in the realm of publicizing.  I've spent much of the last two days working on band logos... It's something I've been very enthusiastic about.  Take a look at my favorite, let me know what you think:  (no direct link, since the picture is way too large to appear correctly formatted in the blog... the file is also gigantic, so you might want to take a shower or write a letter to someone while you wait for the file to load)  http://drycereal.mine.nu/03.jpg  More on the way, but this was one that I was rather excited about.

      In a bizarre twist of normalcy, I have hardly anything to say tonight.  I'm living a little 'Groundhog Day' life, ending up in the same place at the same time every evening... at least it's a fun time I'm having every night though.  Soon I'l have new things to say... I am reviving my addiction to physical activity.  Yesterday's Ultimate Frisbee was replaced by today's in-line skating, which will be overtaken by reroofing the party house at Moran's next week.  I can't wait.

      I am reluctant to say this, simply for fear of jinxing myself, but I feel that I have recovered a significant portion of myself that's been vacant for quite some time.  Part may be from the accompaniment of close friends, part may be from the outstanding exercise that comes with a long round of Ultimate Frisbee, but whatever it is, it's been making me feel wonderful.  Running barefoot on artificial turf feels wonderful, but it makes your toenails turn green if you're not careful.

      So, I thought this would be a funny pun if it were to appear in, say, a song or rap as a lyric:  "I ride with the porn star crowd, 'cause I belong with them."  I'll give you a hint... it has to do with the word 'belong'.  Kids, don't smoke crack.        P.S.  If you like that line and want to use it, tough cookies.  It's copyrighted, you pilfering nogoodniks. P.P.S.  I know that nobody in their right mind would want to use that line.  Kids, really don't smoke crack.

      Back from camping, once more.  Although the timespan of the trip was condensed in comparison to our previous trip, it was no less engaging.  And Once more, as habituality rears its well-practiced head within me, I'm winding down the weekend's celebration with beer pong at Rayshine's.  An interesting twist this time, I crawled off the mountain barely in time to make it straight to work (after a shower, don't worry); I didn't even give myself time to unpack... that's how dedicated I am to camping out as long as humanly possible without jeopardizing my employable status.  Okay, I lied.  I definitely jeopardize my employable status on a weekly basis.  'Tis worth it.  End of Story.

      Now, to completely change tone, I seem to have developed an unhealthy obsession with roughing it.  This evening I'll be on my second camping trip in as many weekends.  Not that living off the land and getting all the accompanying exercise is unhealthy, but the level of obsession definitely is (not to mention the requisite consumption of fatty foods and moonshine).    On the other hand, I'm certainly putting my gear through its paces, which is very good from an economical standpoint, since camping gear is as expensive as, say, skiing and golf equipment, for point of reference.  If you don't know how expensive skiing and golf equipment are... well, they are as expensive as music equipment.  Music equipment, for the record, is expensive; I could either own all my skiing, golfing, music, and camping gear, or I could own a different car for each day of the work week.  Nonetheless, not many things in life are as fun as either skiing, golfing, playing music, or camping, especially when partaking with your closest friends (who, interestingly, if you omit the second 's' from 'closest' in a freak typo moment, suddenly become 'closet friends', and they are a completely different category of people, though they can be pretty fun too).  I'll be back and civilized by Saturday... damn employment.

      I have the best friends in the world.  Not that it's proper to have certain expectations of friends, but my friends thrive on exceeding even the most stringent expectations to which anyone could hold them.  They do it for the joy of doing it.  One thing I'll say, with a hint of immodesty, is that I sure can pick 'em.

      Moods take abrupt detours and other alterations of course as their course is run.  Within the last half hour, I both watched a best friend's heart break, and spoke to an old love for the first time in years.  I've never felt more discarded, disheartened, and uplifted than I do now.  ...waiting for the rain to cleanse the soil of tattered souls...  I'll part with an aged song lyric from my past:  "Take a ride into the place where I see your secret inner light Illuminate and drown the flood, and bathe me 'till I'm clean inside Precious Delta show the way, and tangle up the darker side If you follow me, I'll follow you, and we'll no longer hide."  This verse bears such a direct meaning to me at the moment, for reasons none but a few could ever recognize.  Suffice it to say that it refers to a tumultuous period, but rest assured that the remainder of the song is optimistic in tone, and I'll be recollecting that part soon enough.

      If I could be rid of one  emotion, it would be envy, the source of so much acute pain, and of absolutely no joy.  Envy is the one emotion from which no positive influence could ever be derived.  Why do we have it, except to provide evidence of the weakness and fallibility of humankind?

      The pressures of drudging through resume and cover letter writing, phone calls, and asking favors in order to find gainful employment are outweighed only by the constraints imposed by a painful lack of liquid assets.  Thusly, I have spent many of my waking hours today reaching tenaciously, albeit futilely, toward the goal of getting a job interview.  Being a young homeowner has its perks, but the responsibilities are substantial, and numerous at that.  Most of them are financial.  It's impossible to be a confident person while living paycheck to paycheck, because there's always something hovering over you, threatening to coax your credit rating swiftly toward the negative domain with a deftly applied baseball bat.  Need I say more?  Getting a new job will add a degree of permanence to my current living situation, and maybe some new dress slacks, too.  Recently I heard the story of a kid my age, and fellow RIT student, who inherits 1.5 million dollars (American, not Canadian)  each year .  This poor guy has so much money he has to throw a barhopping party, complete with limousines and $40 bottles (8 times plural, mind you) every weekend.  I hope that by the time I'm a rich man, I'll have learned that you can never have too much money to save.  Now, as a counterpoint, I have no ability to suppose that this kid never gives to charity or other worthy causes, and it's just as likely that he does; but it's a fun game to wonder what you would do if it were you who had the cash to spend.  I'd like to think that after the brand new Audi S4, I'd get right to work on helping out friends in need.

      One of the best things a person can do to improve his state of wellness is take the time to retreat from the complexities of modern life.  Another of the best things he can do for this same purpose is self-medicate, either by psychological or physiological means.  Combine these techniques, and he will have concocted potentially the most effective means to better himself as a person and as a positively contributing member of society.  The above paragraph could be the most excessive justification for spending a weekend drinking in the woods that ever there was.  Somehow, just somehow, we managed to coordinate close to a dozen people spanning four metro areas in two states to rendezvous in the middle of absolutely nowhere (someplace on the periphery of the Allegheny National Forest... beautiful, mind you) in an attempt to throw an obscenely large party in honor of my roommate's 21st birthday.  We succeeded.    Highlights of the weekend and inside jokes are as follows:   Impulse Grocering Tent City Log Tossing Creek Keggin' Venison Dogs Moonshine 101 Miss Thomas The Hippie Barrel S'Mores Stick Fighting Bowie Knife Madness Explosive Wolves and Rocketing Bottles Breakfast Beers Mudbogging Bridge Tossing Freelance Logging Block Breaking Moonshine 201 Hardboiled Lighter Fluid Saturn Missile Attacks Bacon, Steaks, and Automobiles The Magic 8-Tent Moonshine For Engineers Pancakes and Breakfast Beer Aquatic Impreza Cuba Cheese   I'll put up pictures as soon as they're downloaded and developed.  And what did I do to recuperate as soon as I returned from the weekend's revelry?  Beer pong at Rayshine's, of course.  It has something to do with not being scheduled for work until Friday this week.

      My favorite quote of the night; I'd say it succinctly captures the spirit of this evening's revelry:  "Okay!  That's it, no more licking breasts for me!  I'm through!"  ...quite a departure from the tone of my previous post...  ...se la vie.  Ladies, you were a riot.

      The decision to publicize one's inner monologue comes with great difficulty... assuming one's mindset happens to match mine precisely.  A profoundly campy/cheesy aura surrounded most every blog I visited throughout my tenure as an internetive-compulsive web surfer.  Even worse, perhaps, were the blogs that affected my life directly in the tangible world; one private detail slipped yields hours of distress under the proper conditions.  But the more I thought about it, I realized that I was in control of the atmosphere here.  If I stick roughly within the confines of the present-tense, I am relegated to speaking in a sort of instantaneous snapshot of my thoughts and feelings; this will eliminate the potential to use this medium as a means to dwell on anything disturbing.  I will always post with the reader's entertainment in mind.  Rather, I will, upon completing a post, sit back and say to myself, "is this something that people would avoid reading if they knew what I was about to say?"  And if the answer is 'yes', then I will refrain unless I feel very strongly that people need to hear me vent.    Having said that, I think the best use of this webspace is as a mental home-gym:  By virtue of existing, this blog will coach me to think out loud more frequently, so I may fill its pages.  Too often do I sit around and stumble upon a piece of wisdom, or a funny idea, et cetera, and too often do I lack the means to record it.  A thought without destination is doomed to slip into the crevasse of muddy recollection, and then into oblivion just beyond.  Just having this space available gives me a feeling of security, that I can take something out of my head, leave it here, and never worry about losing it.  I have a hunch that if the thoughts knew there was a comfy spot awaiting them, they would manifest freely and with ease.  Knowing that I have space to fill, I will begin to create on a prolific scale all my musings, song lyrics, poetry, and who knows what else...  Innocent in its inception, this blog should be free of all the imprudent categories of personal information.  I'm not going to sit here and type about people I don't like.  I'll cover every emotion I've ever felt, but only in the hope that any interested reader will find my words allegorical; if I can convey a message through my retelling of personal experiences as opposed to just putting them outside my mind as a means to avoid the situation, then this blog will be a success for me.  If at any point you laugh to yourself, or scratch your head and go "Wow, I never saw it like that", then this blog will be a success for you.  I hereby dedicate this post to Andrey Hardy, who unwittingly coerced me into creating a blog of my own when he put a link to his in his Instant Messenger profile.    And so continues the great chain of inspiration, and perhaps lack of discretion; I, too, must now join the ranks of those who will share the collective blame when the whole spot blows up; someday, there will be one too many blogs in the world....

      Life listens poorly to the pleas of the downtrodden. In an absolute renunciation of this potential state of being, I resume living my already busy life at an accelerated pace. Scrambling toward my goals, some concrete and some abstract, I am drawing near the ideal self-condition: Struggling and thus working hard; passionate and thus deeply focused; comfortable and thus buoyant; determined and thus destined to succeed.     The first enemy to face is financial hardship. From a bird's eye view, one would find me gallivanting across the state to play a gig late into the night for a handful of cash, only to return tomorrow to play another gig for a little more money. Half of what I earn is likely to be translated into hydrocarbons and then into greenhouse gases, courtesy of my trusty Nissan that gets me where I need to be to perform said services in exchange for monetary compensation. (Hmm, I never really thought about it that way before... I get to contribute to global warming and increase local visual pollution,  and  I get to pay for it?)     This is the only way to keep on top of my affairs. It's something within me plugging away when I should be scared shitless. I am scared, but only scared to diminished quantities of shit, not completely devoid of it.

      No excuses will be offered for my absense from the helm of 'Blogger-Dashboard'. There are expansive challenges laid out before me, in rank and quantity too great to convey here. I am strong because this is not by far the first time I have faced challeneges of this magnitude. It is not the first time I have been strong for those who lacked the capacity; it is not the first time I have been attacked by those close to me; it is not the first time I have prepared to say and have ultimately said, "goodbye", to someone I love.    I am endurance.    I am angry.    I can withstand it.    I am not...    Alone.

       Wow,  I feel almost like I've betrayed someone, somewhere, somehow.  It's been  the better part of a week since I've posted here, certainly the longest absence  since the blog's inception.  I'm actually a bit confused about how this  happened, as I'm having trouble remembering all that I've done since my last  post.  I've certainly left the town more than once, left the state at  least once, made at least $100, and spent at least as much.     The most monumental occurrence of the past week has to be the Party That Was  Never Supposed To Be So Party-ish.  By    seven o'clock    Wednesday night, we were starting to get  invitations from friends to a party at our own house later that evening.   What we'd expected to be a small gathering turned into a mid-week 'rager'  complete with not one, but at least four DJs spinning records in the basement,  beer pong and graffiti, and social interaction so dynamic and diverse we  couldn't see straight.  Half the patrons were complete strangers to most  of us, yet everyone was unmistakably cool and easy to relate to.  All in all,  a lot of people were relying on us to give them a great time, and everyone  seemed to have their expectations met.  Which , as it happens, exceeds  mine.      I think I have a date with the one I want sometime soon; at the party we  decided we definitely needed to go out, now it's just a matter of picking the  day.  We'll have wonderful fun, and I can't wait.      Man, I really don't like the new blog editor.

      The closest I've ever come to running a marathon, blindfolded, through a razorblade-and-lemon-wedge field, was spending this past weekend as myself.  What began as a long night of drinking whilst playing acoustic music to an empty bar for a shitload of money ended as a long night of drinking after playing acoustic music to an empty bar for a shitload of money.  After waking at morning's asscrack the next day and driving for three hours, where an afternoon of tiling my bathroom eagerly awaited, accompanied by a refrigerator that needed to be taken down a flight of stairs, I performed said tasks with absolutely no beer to get me through it.  Immediately upon completing all home improvements, I was whisked away to one of the most injurious games of field hockey we've ever played, though we were playing it with a frisbee, under a different name: Ultimate Frisbee.  And we didn't have any field hockey sticks, which only made it harder.  And there was, yet again, no beer to get me through it.  The game lasted almost three hours and ended with four teams in a tournament rotation, as twelve people jumped in and joined the ten of us that were already there.  I have never been more beaten, broken, exhausted, and otherwise diminished; never have I felt so alive and well.  Well, I'm off to Ray's for partying the night away.

      What follows is an exercise in processing thought on-the-fly.  I've been discussing with my pal Andrey about how the blogging itself had become a testament to tedium, not often worth more than a tape recorder into which one narrates his daily tasks.  There was no creativity to be seen in the reflection of the day's activities.  Rather than report on my whereabouts throughout the day, I'd prefer to devote more of this space to creativity, or at least insightful commentary.  As it happens, I often feel like my most inspired dialogue is with 'Drey.  It frustrated me, because he was getting to hear everything I wished I was capable of making public.  About that time, the idea hit me.  I'm going to post my conversation with Andrey, with his comments removed.  All you'll see is that I'm saying.  You'll have to guess as to what he's said to me, based upon how I react.  Surprisingly, there was an uncanny flow and poetic aspect to the passage, despite the stringing together of only my half of the conversation.  Here is a snapshot of my mind at work, amidst the dynamic changes that occur during Andrey's systematic prodding of my psyche: (names have been removed to protect the identities of the innocently involved) hey man coo coo will do always do ;-) fine fine worked from 11am to 8:20pm then went home, changed, met her and her friends at a carnival in Rush haha! awesome we were there 'till midnight or so not too many no opportunities for juice I found out that her ravenous appetite for fried food rivals even mine and she's so cute about it we definitely have chemistry, still we had a great time together at work today after the carnival ended, we went our separate ways, since she was going straight to bed I went over to a friend's and met up with sleeping people and a bunch of us watched 'secret window' decent flick not seen it? hmm it's a decent flick very stephen king-ish umm, what the fuck? firefox new version just installed and now it refuses to run oh wait, there it goes the computer's just slpw slow and my fingers are sticky 'course, it's been running for 30 days or so well, I'm glad I do it it's tedius sometimes because I only seem to do it around this time of night after I'm exhausted and thinking to myself about the extensive plans for the following day such as, tomorrow I drive to Pennsylvania so tonight I don't feel like writing tons about what I did today that's the thing... it' mainly been more of an activities log lately, with a touch of feelings on the side what I wish it were, were something more dynamic like, "hey, I thought of a song lyric, here it is" or "this insightful thing came to me in a fit of randomness" yes, I have but that was once out of the 20-something entries I've done true, it is I just wish it were fewer facts, more flavor... to adapt a line from 'big fish' no, I mean... well, more colorful content more poetic in one sense, more intangible in another rather than relaying the course of my day, I'd rather use this as a place to store creative energy so, fiction in greater supply and perhaps a reference to whatever real-life-of-kevin inspirations to which that fiction is rooted often times, I feel like pasting our conversations into it because what I say to you is what I wish it looked like more often in fact, there's an idea little experiment... brb hmm.  And now, Andrey's text: hey blogger is fixed it seems also, check my latest entry ;-) oh, I saw 9/11 today, i'm still working on the entry for that one;-) how was your day/night? I passed by there! so give me all the juicy details;-) but I'm sure you had a million thought processes running excellent that's the new Johnny Depp film? not yet I've been gunshy about new movies lately for some reason. not attacking them with the verve I used to. been waiting for the "all clear" so to speak I see lol I love the Mozilla group ah so tell me.. what do you think of blogging - call it a month in review why? [I agree] but you've had that before... I think it's dynamic because it represents how you feel the moment you publish by flavor... you mean randomness? I too wish for more of that... but maybe, maybe that's part of the challenge we're laid out for ourselves.  to reach down [or back] and recall the millions of inspirational moments that strike us throughout the day k all right i'm glad we're on the same page with this blog thing what you said about wanting it to be "more than just facts".  I've felt the same way.  I want it to be a reflection of Myself and my experiences, not just a regurgitation of the nightly news I feel like I can't let myself go, like I can't tap into the creativity that I know is within me. in fact [as you also said], this and many of our conversations are exactly what I want in my blog. Go ahead, try to piece it together :)

      So after drinking absurd amounts of alcoholic beverages, my friends and I found ourselves playing a game of hide -and-seek, tag style, a la elementary school rules.  We entertained ourselves for the better part of an hour doing this, before picking up the Frisbee for a game of in-the-street-at-three-in-the-morning-neighborhood-Frisbee-toss.  Nostalgia has never been so satisfying while being so... uncouth.

      Played Ultimate Frisbee again today, though not up to par, as per my self-imposed standards.  Most of it had to do with the lack of traction due to the compound problem of not playing on an artificial turf field and of the rainsoaked ground. All in all, there was a great series of games played, and I walked away with a hell of a battle wound.  I'm so proud of it, in fact, that I've immortalized it in the digital medium for you to gape at:       That is actually a bruise, not a scrape... there is no proken skin on my body.  Apparently when the impact is with a nearly frictionless surface, the bruise pattern mimics what the scrape would have looked like.  That aside, it doesn't hurt and looks badass.  This has been one hell of an evening.

      So, I'm a little perturbed at blogger; the site seems to have glitched a little lately, keeping me off my posting pace.  But enough of that.  Today was a good, long day, full of gratifying exertion.  Friends and I performed all the site preparation requisite to refurbishing the Moran's party house, between 8 am and noon or so, then spent the next seven hours drinking bourbon and smoking cigars while waxing intellectual about business and finance.  All in all, a very educational experience.  Next phase is up on Thursday, when we reframe a wall to prep for the reroofing project that comprised the original scope of the job.  Leave it to efficiency-minded individuals to find more and more work to do...

      Today was eventful and entertaining.  I will, however, not relinquish the details at this time.  Honestly, it's because I'm too tired to write.  The ideas are there, and will be shared privately, but as is evident from trend as of late, I haven't much to say publicly tonight.  To summarize, I made some good money, saw many friends, got exercise, ate great food, had a good beer or two, watched a movie,  and treated a head wound (someone else's, not mine).  It was a great day.

      Once again, I am admittedly inebriated and incapacitated.  All I wish for is rest and repair.  But I have affection to carry me through the potential intricacies of my currently occluded state of mind.  Damn moonshine, being so potent and seductive.

      I'm falling for a beautiful person.  She's all the kinds of wonderful I look for, plus significantly more.  I just need her to fall for me, now.

      Copyrightable concept of the evening:  "Mexican Racing Bunnies".  This is going to be the name of my next rock band, I can feel it.

      Time again for "you had to be there", except that I bring 'there' here, so you can get the gist of it regardless. This evening's episode comes from yet another conversation between my man Andrey and me. It appears unedited for spelling and/or grammar, and is unabridged.   KnightM3: yo' RITmusic2k: hey boss KnightM3: how goes? RITmusic2k: oh my god RITmusic2k: crazy weekend KnightM3: do tell RITmusic2k: I've been inextricably sneezy for the last few days...

RITmusic2k: multivittles RITmusic2k: ;-) KnightM3: good good RITmusic2k: anyway, KnightM3: [do tell more kind sir, i shall brb] RITmusic2k: the itinerary since friday was as such: RITmusic2k: had a bunch of friends from work join me at my house for a gather-together evening. Had fun, played beer pong 'till three or so, since we didn't get out of work until after 10pm RITmusic2k: everyone had a great time RITmusic2k: and there were hot chicks aplenty RITmusic2k: though not the one I wanted RITmusic2k: she was occupied with some late dinner hosted by her teacher at school RITmusic2k: but she called me while we were partying RITmusic2k: which was nice RITmusic2k: anywya, RITmusic2k: one of my friends was waiting for a ride to come pick her up, RITmusic2k: but this guy was terrible with directions, and the phone he was on was dying, so we only got incomplete directions to him RITmusic2k: consequently, RITmusic2k: I had to drive her home, to north winton KnightM3: [back] KnightM3: eww RITmusic2k: didn't get to bed until 4:15 am RITmusic2k: worked 9am-1pm the next day, of course KnightM3: of course;-) RITmusic2k: had a little chill time with a friend, then hightailed it down to Pennsylvania for a saturday night gig with Farnsworth RITmusic2k: by this time, cold is fully set in RITmusic2k: so I'm thinking I'm really gonna suck it up tonight when we play RITmusic2k: fortunately, everything worked out fine RITmusic2k: one of the best sounding shows we've played KnightM3: niiiice RITmusic2k: we each killed a bottle of jagermeister during the show, RITmusic2k: which was 9:30pm-1am RITmusic2k: so we were having plenty of fun RITmusic2k: people bought us shots as well, RITmusic2k: and tipped us nicely RITmusic2k: my favorite quote from the gig:  RITmusic2k: "Remember, every time you throw a dollar in out tip jar, a priest gets a venerial disease." RITmusic2k: (our tip jar) KnightM3: LOL RITmusic2k: so, we get to bed by 3:30am, RITmusic2k: and I was planning to get up early and drive back to rochester by lunch time to meet with Paige's dad and help him finish off the party house RITmusic2k: well, RITmusic2k: that didn't quite happen since my sickness had regrouped and dealt me a hefty blow RITmusic2k: I barely made it home in time to nap an hour before heading into work at 6pm for our remodeling night RITmusic2k: overnight shift RITmusic2k: had an absolute blast RITmusic2k: worked until 3:15am KnightM3: holy crap RITmusic2k: and the ten of us who were there played a mean game of parking lot football during our "lunch" break RITmusic2k: well, the second half of it, at least, RITmusic2k: first half was spent downing henrietta hots plates RITmusic2k: my ladylove knocked me upside the head as I was attempting to intercept a pass to her (by the way, she's got hands like flypaper on the football field) RITmusic2k: got me a cute little black spot under my eye from that one RITmusic2k: and I successfully bend the shit out of my glasses four times tonight RITmusic2k: sometimes from working, sometimes from roughhousing, RITmusic2k: and once from the football game RITmusic2k: it was such a memorable night KnightM3: LOL KnightM3: sounds like a day in the life of Riker. RITmusic2k: we had so much fun together KnightM3: but more importantly, how do you feel now?  physically? RITmusic2k: dude, I loved every minute of it RITmusic2k: but I'm broken RITmusic2k: of, one more thing RITmusic2k: I was wearing slippers at first during football, KnightM3: hahaha you're asking for it;-) RITmusic2k: but I doffed them in favor of socks for maneuverability RITmusic2k: well, I didn't realize this at the time, RITmusic2k: but I ripped the bottoms of the socks to shreds RITmusic2k: after the game we were al inside, RITmusic2k: people were like, "oh man, those are dirty." RITmusic2k: so I picked my foot up to see how bad it loked at the bottom, and all I saw was the tar-blackened ball of my foot RITmusic2k: funniest shit of the night KnightM3: lol KnightM3: no injury to the feet? RITmusic2k: wish I had my camera RITmusic2k: well, heel's a little sore from impact RITmusic2k: but that's all RITmusic2k: no scraps RITmusic2k: um, RITmusic2k: scrapes RITmusic2k: the asphalt was very recently re-tarred, RITmusic2k: so there was not a single loose stone onm the surface RITmusic2k: but yeah, RITmusic2k: been nose-runny and cough-y all night RITmusic2k: plus I'm losing my voice RITmusic2k: which is a bad thing...

RITmusic2k: pretty much the only criterion to match RITmusic2k: nope, RITmusic2k: it's to replace the player in a two-drive setup KnightM3: I'll check my price, but retail it's like 40-50 bucks RITmusic2k: he has one reader, one burner KnightM3: we might get another 10 off RITmusic2k: well, if that's cool for you, the tewn bucks off will be worth it to him RITmusic2k: so we'll have to meet up sometime so I can give you cash RITmusic2k: okay? KnightM3: yeah, I'll just have to keep the receipt.

      Not more than a month ago, I became reacquainted with an old friend under the most unusual and delightful of circumstances.  As I was working my work at Old Navy, I noticed a well-dressed shopper on a cell phone standing behind a booth, where the lower half of her body was obscured, reach down and start fumbling around. This is a red-flag of sorts, as shoplifters often attempt to drop merchandise into their bags behind the cover of our fixtures. My inner monologue (hereafter italicized) went something like this:  "Hmm, Looks like she's trying to drop something over there.  I should check it out."   As employees, we're trained to give extra attention in the form of courtesy and inquiry about the perpetrator's supposed needs, if for nothing else, just to let them know we see them. I continued to approach her.  "Wow, she's really cute; even if she's not shoplifting, I think I'll go over and make sure she's finding everything alright."     I made it around the fixture to observe her innocently tugging at a wrinkle in her sock.   "Erroneous concern.  I'll just go ahead and make sure there's nothing she needs my help in locating."   She stood back up and continued to look at our merchandise.   "  Holy shit, she's the spitting image of Audrey (the younger sister of my best friend from high school)!"  The resemblance was too great to go untested. At this point, it had not filtered out from my memory that Audrey (the younger sister of my best friend from high school) had been attending U of R for the last three years and was living up here in Rochester, not more than three minutes from my house.  I devised a brilliant plan, in which I would hide almost out of sight and yell her name out, then wait to see if she reacted. Before I could commence with the clandestine tactic, though, she snapped away into the women's' department. Unfazed, I walked around from the far side and approached her in a neutral fashion, as if I were about to ask if she needed any assistance. As soon as I saw the look of recognition in her eye, I knew it was Audrey (the younger sister of my best friend from high school).  "Holy shit, it IS her.  Man, she looks fantastic!"  I ran over and tackle-hugged her. Quite an inconsiderate reunion, with regard to the person on the other end of her cell phone conversation. Fortunately it was her mother, who likes me to pieces and forgave my transgression: the public molestation of her youngest daughter.  Long story slightly shorter, Audrey (the younger sister of my best friend from high school) and I finally had the chance to spend some time together as we'd promised each other we'd do. The encounter took place this evening. It was uplifting to say the least; I'd long known we had a connection of sorts, but we'd never explored it due to the fact that I was already so close to her older sister. There was just no reason to explore it. Furthermore, her sister, Erika, at that time, was not too fond of Audrey (the younger sister of my best friend from high school) spending time with friends that Erika staked a claim on first. Tonight, however, we'd indeed discovered that we are destined to become remarkably close, and it is only coincidence that it is so; she's a very different person than her sister.  Audrey (the younger sister of my best friend from high school) and I made so many plans before we'd actually hung out together (all of which were interfered with by that bitch, Unfortunate Circumstance), not the least of which was a plan to partner up as an original acoustic duo, with Audrey (the younger sister of my best friend from high school) taking lead vocal. This girl is such a great performer, she captured the lead role in our high school play as a freshman. That simply does not happen. Needless to say, I was ecstatic about the opportunity to partner up with her.  Alas, none of it can happen, at least not for another six months or so. See, Audrey (the younger sister of my best friend from high school) is going to prison for a trumped-up auto theft charge.  Wait, no, that's not right... She's taking a leave of absence for a semester and flying to California on a whim. She leaves Saturday morning. Needless to say, we had to see each other at least once before she left. Needless to say, there was an air of melancholy about the evening, though thankfully it was all but lost amongst the litany of conversational topics we'd covered and fine Rochesterian atmospheric samplings we sampled.  We parted just moments ago, but she'll be in my mind for a while yet.

      Jack Handey-esque Thoughts by Kevin Savino-Riker:  "It's a good thing that cows can't talk, because all they'd ever talk about is what grass tastes like.  And that would be a big waste of a talking animal."
