      Yeah. . . .  Do you remember that song?  I can see you  You got your hair pulled back and Sunglasses on. . . I can tell you My love for you will still be strong After the Boys of Summer Have gone. . .  That song IS summer.  And that reminds me of today.    Sara (w/o the H, w/o!!!), Dani and I all went to Pine Park and swung on swings, walked around the lake, got ice cream, hung out at Sara's, and talked to a cool guy from Blackhawk.  They thought he was annoying, but I thought he was cool.  Go me for engaging in casual conversation with members of the opposite sex that I don't know.    God, I need to get a boyfriend.  Too. . .shy. . . .eep.  *Chucks cowardence out the window and becomes Kelsey the Everbold and Charming, who is irresistible to all men*  Hmmmm. . .Nope.  Still not bold and sexy.  I'm already thinking about Homecoming next year and really, really, hoping I have a date.  *Smacks self in head*  And now, Kelsey will write her Memorial Day speech, remember that she is an independent young woman, and that her happiness doesn't depend on a guy.  *le sigh*  I can't wait until summer. . .  Come swing dancing!  Ask me about it!

      Hey sugar momma, come and dance with me The smartest thing you ever did was take a chance with me So whatever tickles your fancy Girl, me n' you 's like Sid and Nancy So sexy, almost evil Talkin' about butterflies in my head I used to think happy endings were only in the books I read But you made me feel alive when I was almost dead You filled that empty space with the love I used to chase And as far as I can see, it don't get better than this So butterfly, here is a song And it's sealed with a kiss and a thank you miss .  .  .  Do you remember that song?  Yeah.  It's amazing how many songs touch you, and then they're off the Top 40 charts and you forget about them.  I remember listening to this song on the radio late one night when I was in Belgium, and thinking that if there was ever a song that made me want to fly, this was it.  Of course,  I've heard a lot more since then.  But it still does that same thing to me.  Come come, my baby, come come, my baby.  I'll make your legs shake, you make me go crazy. . .

      My mom has confiscated my AIM because I am a bad girl and cannot get to bed on time.  Which is okay, I deserve it, but I'm trying to organize my post-school festivities, so it's really inconvenient.  Anyways, I'm going swing dancing with a bunch of people on Saturday, June 5, from 8 to midnight, and for $10, you get admission, a live band, and a way cool time.  A bunch of people from my church are going, but it's completely religion free, so be not fearful that the liberals shall convert you.  If you read that and go "Whoa, Kelsey is way cool and that is way cool!" email me at ballance@nauticom.net  After band camp today, Lou and I were hanging out on the sidewalk, listening to my way cool music, and I was lying down and looking up at the sky, and I just felt soo happy for once.  I'm really excited about summer.  Come, baby, come!  Tonight I'm watching "Plan 9 from Outer Space," which many professional music critics have dubbed "The Worst Movie Ever," so Heather and I should have a good time.  Drop me a line, y'all.  Bye.

      It took God 6 days to create the universe.  It took me 2 minutes to create this account.  I won.

      What is it about perpetually nice weather, a happy home and family, and an abundance of friends that makes one so depressed?    Of course there isn't anything.  That's why I'm so confused.  God, I sound like such a whiny teenage girl when I say that.  I'm going to go paint my nails black and listen to some music about suicide and cry and write in my journal "Dear Diary: no one understands me *sob*."  But all my friends just seem like bad actors on a hidden camera show; I feel that something is going on behind my back that I don't know about.  Like they all don't like me, but are too cowardly to tell me.  All my relationships are superficial and unsatisfying right now.  Hmmmmm. . .  I need to stop making peanut butter cookies.  Because then I eat them.  Have a terribly awe-inspiring day.  *Pokes self*  Kelsey, that goes for you, too.

      I like to .  .  . Think of band names Wish I had a band Write lists Attempt to Juggle Find ways to abuse my ceiling  I __________ too much. . . Bitch List stuff Obsess over -Guys -My dinkles -My ceiling -Why I open the ramen noodle seasoning packet backwards.  Fold your arms.  Right now.    Is your right arm over your left?  Congratulations, you're the majority of the population.  Try it the other way.  I noticed that, and I don't get it.  But it's interesting.  I talk constantly, but I say absolutely nothing at all.  That's all, folks.
