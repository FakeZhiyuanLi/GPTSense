        This fine morning, I woke up on time (6.00 a.m sharp no blunt), and found that the toilet is occupied~!! No~~!! Late again =(     Then went into the toilet at arnd 6.05 and washed up.    6.10 was out of the toilet.    Tried to wear contacts but eyes were red~!! No~~ =(    Went to style my hair, apparently it sux. However, got out of house at 6.25am.    Went to the bus stop and bus was there~!! ^-^v cool...Caught the early bus and 985 was juz behind my 188 when I alight... So heng.. :D    Got to school early, bought and ate breakfast..haha and by this time, my eyes were alright le.. so I put on my contacts.. =P cooL~!! :D            During morning assembly, gave my CT Ms Tan a letter from my parents stating that they don't wish me to go the Palau Tekong on wednesday (tml). Feeling scared at first la, but still gave her the letter la...she read and say she will ring up my dad. Haha.. I wasn't scared at all, cuz i bhaka with my dad last nite le.. :P so its double security for me if she ring up my dad..=D (clever rightz? XD)     Haha...then went to the stupid physics tutorial which is soo sooo sooo soo sooo soo sooooooooooo fast that its even faster than the lectures.. =S and that Tan Ing Keat (TIK) expect us to understand and know everything, knowing our standards of physics.. Grr... damn dulan la... he rush so fast for wad? no use de.... we dun understand ma... so i decided to slack thru the lesson......... by.......... stoning =X Well, the moon muz be blue la, got released 3 mins earlier for our break =D    Haha break le... =P wait for yy in my home class then went break together. Haha... although the break is a short one la... but its also a veri energizing one.. =P    Back in class, its GP lessons, actually its soooooo boring but i dunno y, somehow, somewhere, i get the energy that i was so spontaneous during his lessons..=P After GP its econs....normally i will sleep during her lesson but since i gave her a letter saying that im working hard for my promos (my excuse for not going tekong =X), I was snatching to answer all the questions she asked and she was kind of shocked.=P Actually, i so spontaneous is to win her favour and also to hope her to give me the "good news" that i dun have to go tekong la.. =D but in the end, she dint say anything.    Lectures~ ahh....so many things to copy... the maths make me blur blur le la~~ =( cham le... promos in ...5 weeks? :( haiz.. i hope some miracle happens or i suddenly become veri smart and know my stuff..=P    Haha lunch~ yumyum... =P~ ren le hao jiu le... finally can fill my empty stomach..=D haha...ate my delicious lunch and rush up to class for more................................maths.. -_-". The lesson was so boring that i slept for 10 mins~!! =X but anyway, she dint care abt me la.. cuz im supposingly a "guai" student who does his works and completes his assignments =P    Ok, this is a lesson i dread most............................PW... =(    Apprantly, my ST for PW is Ms Tan, and she indeed, brought me a piece of good news~!! =P=P    "Leefung, ur excused from the Tekong trip" WOOOOOOHOOOOOOO~~~~~~~~~~ me wait for this sentence dunno wait for how long le.. =P=P haha i was so happy but my friends were soooooooooo green that they beat me up =X haha actually they were juz playing la.. haha funny ppl..=)    Haha, proceed on the blardy PW, which we have to hand up draft 3 by this friday, and yet people are still at draft 2....... I help my group members to write guidelines for their chapters... and that took like 1 hr 30 mins?!!??!!? -_-" **sweat** but anyway, its over le.. i also hope my team can do well in the written report ma.. =D    Haha... PW marks the ends of my school day and then I happily go home with yy.. =P     So......Nice or bad day? =) I would say..............................Nice~!! =D    Thx dear~!! =D=D you made my day~!! =P=P    **Jia you la~ leefung.. only got 58 days for present and 5 weeks to promos~!!

Mr Tan really can go to those childcare center n teach... he lulled almost the whole class to slp.. i was there trying very hard to stay awake by allowing only a few sec "nap" [does tt even call a nap? =S]. he teach us by asking us a qns wait for few sec, no reply  then say " ok. fine." then carry on talking for a while then paused n asked another qns, no reply, then "ok.fine." n moved on again.............he did tt for almost the whole lesson.. pei fu ta.. have the heart to go on teaching even if half the class is halfway in Z-land...towards the end of the lesson somehting interesting happens tho..Piliang,who was sitting at the front row, was putting his head on the table n slp rite in front of him. Mr Tan juz go to him n using his marker put a dot on his nose.. real comical sia.. Piliang was being waken up by WeiHeng i think. the rest of the class ask Piliang to turn ard but he dun dare.. =D after tt minor incident, Mr Tan went go back to his "ok. fine." teaching..while the class go back to the silent mode..      after tt is maths..n i forgot to do the tutorial~~ =X was rushing the Lit Review n everything.. so no time to do.. but then i still managed to catch some balls after doing some qns..=D n dunno y when i go for maths tutorial, time go pass exceptionally fast..=S juz managed to do 5qns in 1hr.. so productive inefficiency sia..after maths end at 4.30, i still have 1 last period, PW~~~ which is sort of like a relaxing session.. =D went to the com lab 1 n do some touch up on the Lit Review n have a sort n brief meeting.. =)      when the bells ring at 5.30pm, i was so excited....finally can go home...=D i almost forgot i have to find Mrs Annie Loh to do standing board jumps.. cos i failed.. but then i can't find her anywhere, so i go home lor..=D reached home shower, eat dinner,try to do some maths then come online to do Lit Review[again~!!] le.. =P managed to do finished the Draft 2[finally~!!!!] now is relaxation time..=D gg to slp soon....=)
