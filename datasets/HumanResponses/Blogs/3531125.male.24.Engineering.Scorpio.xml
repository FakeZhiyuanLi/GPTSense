      Chidambaram is the only temple in Hinduism depicting all the three forms of God and hence, what ever the explanation one could add to this temple, it must be part of these three poses, for instance, seeing the sky through a hole is only to emphasize the fact that God is in Aruvam (Shapeless and Featureless) like sky. In Sanskrit, sky is called 'Aghayam' ie Aa-ghayam where ' Aa' means living beings and 'ghaym' means body. This means that all living being should ultimately attain the body like  'aghayam' which is not having shape or features ie 'aruvam'-shapeless and featureless stature of God.   This is confirmed by Swamy Vallalar as 'Gnana  Degham' ,the third posture of 'Deathless Eternal life' (called by him as Maranamilla peruvazhvoo) .First Dhega is called 'Sudha Dhega'-uruvam ie you can see and hold. Second Dhega is called 'Pranava Dhegha'-Aru uruvam ie you can see like 'bright light' ,but you can not hold it. Third form of body is called as 'Gnana Dhega'-Aruvam ie neither you can see it nor you can hold it, like Agayam (sky).  Chidambaram is a great temple and that is the reason Swamy Vallalar has mentioned it as Poorva Gnana Chidambaram and renamed his Vadalur as Uthara Gnana Chidambaram.It is worth remembering it here that in the encyclopedia of Siva Temples in the world, called as 'Sivasthala Manjari' which gives the total information about the Siva temples, has referred the other Siva temples by the name of their  place like Kumbakonam, Thiruchirapalli, Thirunelveli etc. where as it refers Chidambaram not by the name of the town as Chidambaram, but refers it as 'Kovil' only. This is to ascertain the fact that this is the only temple (Kovil) in Hinduism to be qualified as the 'complete' (purnam) since ultimate 'purnam' form of God is 'Aruvam'

      The numerous Gods and customs of Hinduism preaches man the purpose of his being. In Hinduism there are basically three forms of workship.   1. Uruvam - with shape and features 2. Aru-uruvam - with shape without features 3. Aruvam - without shape and features  1. Uruvam  God is depicted as being in a human form or any know form. This is the most common form of workship. Most of the gods are depicted this way. Like Murugan, Amman etc. All have face, hands and other features.  2. Aru-uruvam  The second way is with shape but without features. Not many are in his category. We see the Siva-lingam in this type. It has a shape but without face or hands etc  3. Aruvam  The third way proclaiming that god is shapeless. Hence he is depicted as void. There are many temples around the world which has the first two forms of workship. But there is only one place on earth which tells the ultimate truth that GOD is shapeless. It is Chidambaram. It a town in South India famous for Nataraj Temple. This tamil temple depicting Lord Siva with features (the famous dancing position) also construes that god is shapeless. This is what the secret of Chidambaram or famously called "Chidambara Ragasiyam". The chidambaram temple is the only temple which explains all three forms of workship.

      Tamil is called "Theiva Mozhi" (divine language). The language itself teaches   about human life and self realization.   1. Uyir ezuthu (Soul) 2. Mei ezuthu (body)  They combine to make human body.   There is one peculiar letter "Aayudha ezuthu". There is more meaning attached to it than it meets our eye. It is the weapon(aayudham) each human has to use to fight the evils - greed, envy, etc... The Aayudha ezuthu sysmbolises the three eyes of human. The two eyes on the face and one eye on the forehead forming a triangle.  That is why tamilians wear kumkum on their forehead to show the importance of the place in the human body. In meditation, we focus our eyes n thoughts on the third eye. The third eye is the eye for Immortality n enlightment.   There are thousands of reasons why the first letter in tamil "Aa" is written that way and not otherwise. Saint Ramalinga adiggal explains these secrets in his book "Thiruarutppa".   There are many saints in Tamil who had lived for more than 4000 years. And a many still living through many centuries. The lastest and most familiar one being Saint Ramalingam or Vallalar. He disappeared from human vision (didn't leave his body unlike many saints) in the 18th century.  He is the only Saint who's miracle history appears in a gazette (British).

      There are lot of things to know from the epics. Here is one such instance :   The food types can be broadly classified into three  1. Ratchasa 2. Thaamasa 3. Sathuva   The Ratchasa type largely comprises of Non-veg food which kindles an aggresive behaviour. The thaamasa type comprises of food with excessive oil and other items which causes drowsiness and the sathuva comprises of green vegies and fresh fruits.   The type of food intake does has a say in shaping one's character. The three types can also be 3 types of characters.  1. Aggressive 2. Lethargic 3. The Ideal n modest.   In ramayana, the three brothers  1. Ravanan 2. Kumabakarnan 3. Vibhishnan  depicts three states of behaviour. Ravanan is aggressive, kumbakarnan is lethargic and Vibhishnan being good n modest. The ramayanam explains their sufferings n justice they got for their attitude.

      Well, Im much interested in knowing the real meaning of some Hindu customs and I also hate some which that has no meaning attached to it.  The "Cin muthra" - the posture many of the hindu gods have their hands. (3 fingers straight, and the index finger touching the bottom of the thumb). Each finger symbolises certain things. Like  Small finger - desire towards women. (these fingers of the bride and the groom are locked in marriages)  Ring finger - desire towards gold n money ( we usually wear rings)  Middle finger - desire towards land n wealth (we use this finger in graha pravasam)  Index finger - symbolises any human or living being. (we use this to point out any person)  thumb - god (without this finger the hand is useless)  So the so called "cin muthra" tells us that we humans(index finger) should shun away the desires and reach the feet of God(thumb) n hence the posture

      I like computers and networks to be more specific. But there are a lot others I love. One of my dream is to become a researcher in Biology particularly Human body and brain. Its a awesome machine.  I used to watch the scientific series in BBC (brain story) and in Discovery. They kindle my desire. I was unable to pursue a course in my area of interest as I made a wrong choice to become a software engg. Wud love to quench my desire for science but these dreams are fading as time goes by in this materialistic world

      The biggest concern for every living being is the freedom to live. This very freedom is put to question by few who believe in some filthy concepts. Who is to be blamed for all these? Is the government? Is the religion? Is the education?
