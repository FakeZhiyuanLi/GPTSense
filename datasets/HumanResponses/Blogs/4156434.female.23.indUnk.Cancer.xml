        yes i can now say i have met a gentleman. don't know if it's the electrical problems in his car or he just opens the door like a gentleman SHOULD do for a lady. i met  him on july 10th, 2 days after my 23rd birthday. so it would be a month of knowing each other. he came at a perfect time, ariam had left san diego to go back home to CH...and so i was left doing nothing for my so called "special day".   the homeboy jerry wanting to see mobb deep and partially pittying me for being bummed out accompanied me to the show. after the mobb deep performance, i didn't really have anyone to dance w/ besides jerry. a part of me was saying..."hey girl! you are now 23! live it up! don't be so insecure! go up to somebody!"   i was talking to hasani when i saw him. the shy and insecure me would've never smiled back. but as i continued chit chatting w/ my friend, at the corner of my eye i could see him stealing glances at me. so i made my way to this fella, tapped his arm and asked him to dance. i hung on to his arm and he led us to the dancefloor. ahhh the reggae room. perfect. we danced, and a few minutes later i excused myself remembering that jerry was by his lonesome in the hip hop room. "what a bad friend," i thought.   later on the night about an hour or so after, i ran into this fella again. i notioned for another dance. he was kind enough and said yes. so we danced and had small talk. then he said, "i don't mean to be rude, but can i have your #?" so that's how it all started.

        i have never experienced a death in my immediate family, and so that is what i fear most. my grandma's ill...yes, she was diagnosed w/ cancer yesterday. i feel so lifeless. already i have given up, lost hope, and her battle hasn't even begun. so as i laid in bed last night i prayed for my grandma's well being. i tried to convince myself that i wasn't praying for selfish reasons, but really i was. i needed her, to be there for me...to watch me walk down the aisle, to hold my first born and see them grow up. i've been walking through clouds since i found out. not a care for the world, not a care for myself...
