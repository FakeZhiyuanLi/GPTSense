      Have you ever been typing and you have typed A LOT on your blog and you accidentally hit a button and it gets deleted?  Well guess what I just did?????  If anything can tick me off...that would be it!!!  I had so much typed in and then as Jordin would say KABOOM!  It's gone.   With that said...I'm going to end this because I have no desire to try and type what I just said.  I love computers and then again....I hate computers.  LOL

      Criminey!!!!  Why do we have kids?  Can someone explain that one to me?  We voluntarily let ourselves get monstrously fat, go through excruciating pain in regards to labor or a c-section, never really lose the fat after the baby is born and then we subject ourselves to the most incredible pain after they are born....they are our own personally created dictators.  Mom will you *put your own words here*, Mom, I need *more words*...it never ends!  Then they get the attitude.  Oh yeah...you know what I'm saying here.  A simple chore...dishes.  Not difficult unless the house doesn't have a dishwasher.  God forbid we have to do them by hand!  Might cut into the cartoon time or the Lizzie McGuire time.  Is it really a hardship to clean the bedroom and bring the dirty clothes out to me so I can wash them?  For a 9 year old that is a resounding YES!!!!!!  Good grief I don't want her to be a teenager.  My life is going to suck and be total hell.  Don't get me wrong, I love my daughter more than life but she can be a real pain in the ass when she wants to be.  She cops an attitude and my 4 year old clings to me like Saran Wrap.  I can't even go to the potty without her hanging on me.  Is it obvious that I am having a really caca kind of day with the kids?  Why yes Tracey...you are.  Why don't you just take a break and go in the bathroom and take a nice hot bubble bath.  No one will bother you and you can just relax...*bubble pop*  Ok, now that I've woken up from that dream.  Time to see how Darren's birthday cake is.  I'm baking it.  Scary ain't it?  LOL

      Holy cow!!!  I kicked butt tonight!!!   Maybe it was because Darren wasn't there or it could have been the 2 pina coladas with extra coconut in them.  I'm thinking the pina colada's.  :)  My last game was a 128 and believe me, that is WAY beyond what I normally do.  Darren did show up for the last game and even he was impressed.  I was the spare queen tonight.  I was getting spares left and right.   Did get a few gutter balls though.   Darren's birthday is tomorrow.  He is going to be 37!  He is going to offically be older than me.  Older until April 1st and then we will be the same age.  Dang I feel old.  I find a few gray hairs every once in awhile and I hate that.  Just irritates me.  The worst are the wrinkles around my eyes.  Maybe I just smile too much.  Maybe I'm just too friendly.  At least that is what my "former" employer said.  Can you believe it?  I worked at the front desk of a physical therapy clinic greeting patients and answering phones and I was too friendly!  Good grief, it's not like I was coming on to the patients for the love of Pete!!!  Oh well....like they say....when one door closes, another one opens.  Hopefully the next door will be an absolutely fantastic door.  Well...one of my favorite shows is on right now...."For Better or For Worse".  I just love TLC shows!!!  My very favorite is "What not to Wear".  Now if someone would just nominate me for a makeover!  *hint hint*  I could really use one.  I'm finding that I'm  very complacent in how I look and how I dress.  This is not a good thing.  Gotta go...*doing the happy dance about my bowling tonight*  :)

      Ok...I was just surfing on the net...like no one else has ever done that when they can't sleep and are out of sleeping pills?  Came across some blogs.  What can I say?  They are cool and quite informative.  Well...maybe not informative but a great way to kill time when you can't sleep and are out of sleeping pills.  So I'm sitting here a few days later...finally can sleep and have my sleeping pills...and making my own blog.  I feel so 21st century-ish.  Is that a word?  If not, it is now.  I like making up words.  Darren, my loving fiance, has chosen a few words for me that aren't made up but great words anyway.  These words would be *ahem* doofus, putz, schmuck and honey.  I personally prefer honey but do fit the other three on one occasion or another.  Ok, maybe more than one occasion.  I am what can be referred to as "an accident looking for a place to happen".  Not one of my finer qualities but all part of the loveable me.  My oldest daughter has inherited that gene from me.  I must say, she has perfected it.  Much more so than I could.  I'm finding that I'm rambling in this first "blog" of mine but be rest assured, my following "blogs" will be coherent.  I promise.  As for now, I must get my flat ass in gear, yes folks...it's flatter than a flitter.  Question...what's a flitter?  Anyway, you can put a level on my ass and it would be accurate.  Told you it was flat.  Just ask my friends.  :)  Time to get the girls in gear and go eat dinner and go do my usual inconsistent bowling.  I'm on a league and I truly suck.    Thank God my teammates are good.  Makes up for my caca average and believe me.....it's bad.  103 bad.  Time to go take care of Jordin who is losing her mind because her foot is asleep.  Will it never end????????

       And the wall came tumbling down...   Ok...remember that cute little hamster my daughter brought home?  Seems he is an escape artist and got out Monday night while we were sleeping.  There is nothing in the world like a devasted 9 year old child crying at 7:00am because her hamster is missing.  So with that said, many tears shed...we relinquished all hopes of finding him.    Fast forward to Wednesday night...   After a really crappy night of bowling, the girls and I came home (Darren was at band practice) and settled in for what was to be an uneventful night.  RING!!!  Phone ringing at 9:00pm is not what I am up for but I answer it.  "Hi, this is Sharon from downstairs and I think we found your hamster"  "Cool" I say and ask to come down.  Care to guess where that little thing was???  You got it...in the wall.  Now I'm sure you are saying...so much for that little guy.  Ah...I beg to differ with you.  After a hacksaw and then moving on to the big stuff...a jigsaw and finally a hammer to pull the sheetrock out...I GOT HIM!!!  Believe me, you never want to hear a hamster scream.  It's not pretty.  So now we have Raisin back BUT....we also have a new little guy.  A Russian Dwarf hamster.  His name is Bud.  I've taken a liking to him.  So tiny and cute.  They aren't in the same cage so you animal activists can rest at ease.  No fighting.  :)  Isn't life just grand?

        Parents are such suckers...  My daughter brought home a teddy bear hamster today.  Cutest little thing I've seen in a long time.  He is grey on his head and tail and a white stripe around his middle.  So fuzzy!!!  I couldn't believe what she named it.  Ladies and Gentlemen....I introduce to you...RAISIN!!!!  Now tell me...what kind of name is that for a hamster?  It is cute though.  She bought a ball to put him in so he can roam the house without our fear of losing him.  It's so funny watching a neon yellow ball rolling around the house on it's own.  Kyla is 9 years old and she has been told that she is to take care of Raisin and be responsible for it.  If she isn't, mom is going to be his new owner.  She didn't like me much after I told her that.  So far she is doing a great job.  Any bets on how long it takes for that hamster to become mine?  LOL

       Never going anywhere...   I'm sitting here waiting for Darren to come home from work.  I heard the little rodents making noise, so I turned around and the new one "Bud" is running on his wheel.  Tell me something...do the little buggers think that they are going to get somewhere running on that?  Run run run little guy...you might miss that next nut.  Now "Raisin" he is a real runner.  Makes the most unbelievable noise at night.  Do you know what it's like to fall asleep listening to a hamster run on his wheel for hours on end?  If you don't know...you aren't missing anything.   A shadow overcomes the home...   Darren called about an hour ago.  His Grandma Frouda died tonight.  I know it's all a part of life but death is just so eerie.  Darren didn't sound to great but that is to be expected.  I wouldn't sound too great either.  He said that she was around 97 so she was tired.  She was ready to go.  I've been thinking lately about life and death.  I looked at Darren yesterday and said "Honey, do you realize that we are pretty much 1/2 way through our life?"  I'm going to be 37 years old in April and that thought scared the hell out of me.  Life for me and my love is 1/2 over.  Where did my life go?  Can someone tell me that???  It seems like only yesterday I graduated from high school.  Not almost 20 years ago!!!  The first 1/2 of my life has not been the best that could be experienced.  I want my second 1/2 to be unforgettable and I want to die knowing that I did everything I could to make myself and my family happy.  I want to be with my Darren for 50 years!!!  Why can't that happen?  Why can't we all live to be 150 years old?  Why can't we be given 50 years automatically when we find the right person to marry no matter how old we are?  I want to be with Darren when we are old and rocking in our chairs on the front porch, still holding hands after 50 years.  I don't want to be without him in my life for a minute.  I want to be an old woman lying in my bed with the man that I love with all my heart and soul, and fall asleep with him...neither of us to awaken.  But can we please be guarnateed at least 50 years???

       Ice Age, Sixteen Candles and Ever After   Have you ever just wondered why?  Not about anything in particular but just why?  I was going along just fine today when I get a call that brought up things that I want to bury.  Bury deep in the recesses of my mind and forget them.  I was going along just fine and once those words were spoken, the tears wanted to come.  Again.  There are days when I feel that I have no control over my life and wonder what the hell am I doing?  There are days when I look around me and all is well with my little corner of the world.  Today is a day where both worlds have collided.  Really bad morning and afternoon.  Happy happy evening and much better night.  My love is finally home and I can spend some quality time with him.  In spite of all his quirks and idiosyncrasies, he is a good man.  Anal...but a good man.

       Kids, fuzz and life   I am proud to announce the birth of...  One (I think) Russian Dwarf Hamster Arrived: Sometime this weekend Mom is in good shape and being very mama bear-ish.  Yes folks...we have a baby hamster in our home.  The Russian Dwarf that we bought and named "Bud" is now named Chloe.  I am in a state of.....I have no clue.  Now we know why "Bud" was being such a butthead this past week.  "Bud" was pregnant!!!!  Cute little hairless thing though.  Not even an inch long.  All pink and bald.  We didn't find out by seeing the little thing....oh no!!!  Kyla was getting ready to clean out the cage, you know how messy little rodents can be.  All of a sudden from out of the clear blue "MOM!!!!!!  THERE'S A BABY!!!!!!!!!".  I thought she was full of caca....so did Darren.  I went to the cage to look and my daughter was not full of caca.  There is a baby hamster wigglin' around in the cage.  At this time, it looks like we only have one baby but Chloe is burrowing big time and nuzzling around so who knows how many she had.  Darren did really well though...he actually went over and looked at our new arrival.  Thought it was ugly though.  LOL    So with all of that said...I guess I will have fodder for the next few weeks as our little baby starts to grow.  This is gonna be so fun!!!!!

       Rock and roll and Strawberry Shortcake   What a weekend...couldn't ask for more other than my oldest daughter being home to spend it with us.  I hate visitation weekends.  This one is especially long since Kyla won't be home until Monday night thanks to Presidents Day.  Anyway...the weekend was good.  Started out with our TV going on the fritz.  So with that and having a fiance' who is addicted to watching Sportscenter and ESPN...we went TV shopping.  Now $600.00 later, we have a brand new 32" flat screen television and a very nice stand to put it on.  I never knew that a big tv would be so nice to have.  I'm so used to the inky binky ones.  Had to rearrange things though.  Living room looks homey even though we have a monstrous TV in it.  Now Darren and I can cuddle up on the couch and not get bent out of shape when we can't see the TV!  Oh what a perfect world we live in.  :grin:

       Rage against the Machine   The way our life turns out is not what most people dream of.  We have such dreams of grandeur when we are young.  Then we graduate from high school and for a lot of people, those dreams go out the window.  Life hits and hits hard.  It's frightening to look back on life and wonder where the time went.    My 20 year high school reunion is next year.  I sat down and thought about where my life went.  I've been out of school for 20 years?  It can't be remotely possible.  I had such dreams.  I wanted to be a flight attendant and be married with 2 kids by the time I was 25.  How funny was that?  Well at the ripe old age of 18, it was a very real dream.  But that is all it amounted to...a dream.  I'm not complaining about my life now.  I'm not where I thought I would be at the age of almost 37 but I am ok with it.  I have 2 divorces behind me, 2 children from 2 different men and recently unemployed.  Yep...that sucks.  But...I have a wonderful man in my life who accepts me no matter what.  I have 2 gorgeous children even though they can irriate the hell out of me on an almost daily basis.  I have a family.  I have a roof over my head and food in my tummy.  I'm still relatively healthy.  LOL  There are a lot of people out there who can't say that.  Who am I to complain about my life or what life has thrown at me?  I've had a tough 20 years from 1985 to now.  I can say it's been a time that has shown me that life isn't always peaches and cream.  Things happen that are out of our control sometimes.  The things that do happen can either make or break you as a person.  I chosen to let my past troubles make me a better person.  Bitterness will only destroy.  I won't give the past control over my future.    I am a mother, daughter, sister, fiancee', niece, friend...but most of all....I am me.  I can't be more than that.

       Rollin' rollin' rollin'   I'm just sitting here listening to Raisin roll around in his ball. Goodness but that critter can bang into walls or whatever is in front of him LOUDLY!!!  It's fun though.  He knows that he will get out of his cage around this time of night and be put into his ball to roam the house.  I do believe that I'm in love with that little critter.  He is all poofy and grey and white.  What is funny is...Kyla, who is only 9 years old, was sitting on the couch tonight and said "Mom, Raisin has the biggest kahona's!!!"  So with that said...I had to turn the little guy over and look for myself.  JEEPERS BUT HIS HO-HO'S ARE HUGE!!!  For such a little guy he is kinda out of proportion.  I'm tellin' ya...the female hamsters would love this guy.  ;)  I told Kyla we should neuter him.  She got all stressed and said "MOM!!!  THAT WILL KILL HIM!!!"  Ah...if she only knew.  Probably would take some of the spunk out of him and I don't want that.  Anyway...who has ever heard of neutering a hamster?    Aside from the excitement of playing with 4 hamsters, I have a nice vacation coming up soon and cannot wait to go!!!  Darren and I leave on April 10 and come back April 18.  We have booked a condo in San Clemente in Southern California.  Ahhhh....a week with no children.  How will I ever survive?  I'll figure out a way...trust me.  LOL  It's going to be a fantastic week.  Disneyland, Seaworld, Hollywood, a Mariners game...A WHAT??? you are asking?  You read that right.  A Mariners game.  They are playing the Aniheim Angels while we are down there so my loving and wonderful man has gotten us tickets to see the game.  Now just as a reminder...this was supposed to be our honeymoon until we postponed the wedding.  Alas...that is what I get for being engaged to a sports nut.  It's ok though...I'm going to drive him nuts with Disneyland and looking for Stitch things.  hahahahahaha *evil laugh* I'm sooooo sweet....:)

       *yawn   I cannot believe it.  I actually have nothing of profound importance to say.  I know...laugh it up.  Scary though.  Usually I have something to talk about or reflect on but NOPE...nothing.  I must be braindead tonight.  Either that or I have been sniffing way too many paint fumes.  Yes that was the excitement of my weekend.  Painting the bathroom.  I have yet to finish it but ya know...I just don't wanna right now.  I don't have a lot to do though. Just painting around the door jamb and the trim around the window and vanity.  After that...I'm done.  I thought it was going to be an easy project...boy was I wrong!!!  At least it will look good when it's done and will look much better than the crap that was in there.  *gag*  Well enough said for this babbling woman.  Time for munchies.  ;)

       And with the nice weather...   Spoke with my gyno yesterday.  He was ok with taking me off of the paxil.  I was grateful for that.  I've gone cold turkey before so I'm sure I can do it again.  Granted, the last time I went cold turkey I still had my ovaries.  Wonder if that will make a difference emotionally for me?  Guess we will find out soon enough.  Poor Darren.  He is a good man though to put up with the chemical imbalances in my body.  He still loves me no matter what the imbalance is.  Anyway back to my gyno.  He said that taking vitamin B complex will help with the mood swings and agreed with the pharmicist about taking tums for calcium.  He also said that I would benefit from taking vitamin D if I don't get a lot of sun.  Since I burn and end up looking like a steamed lobster... BRIGHT RED!! , I will probably have to go get a bottle of those too.  Actually he recommended that everyone should take vitamin D so their bones don't disintegrate as badly.  As some trivia...did you know that you lose more bone density when you are sleeping than when you are awake?  I found that out the other day.  Just thought I would pass that little tidbit along.  :)

       Highs, lows....where are the in-between's???   Well it's offiicial...I no longer have insurance.  That has me worried.  How in the world am I going to pay for my meds?  I went and spoke with a pharmacist today and she at least put my fears to rest in regards to my estrogen.  For those of you who don't know, I had a total hysterectomy back in September.  I have to take estrogen daily.  To battle the emotional crap, I'm also on Paxil.  Get rid of one pain and have to deal with a different one.  I'm relieved that the estrogen is only going to be around $15.00 a month.  The paxil?  That is a different story.  With insurance it was around $40.00 a month.  Without insurance...$77.00 a month!!!!!!  Good grief!!!  That is just nuts.  So with that being found out, the pharmacist suggested that I speak with my gyno and see if he will switch me to the generic for Prozac.  Woo Hoo!!!  Do you think I'm happy about this?  HELL NO!!!  She did say that I should start taking B vitamins and that will help with the emotional and mood swings.  Well...it's a start.  I know this is probably too much information but can anyone tell me what to do about my libido?  Seems that when they took out the female parts, they took the libido also.  LOL

       My happiness...   I'm at my most happy right now.  Nope..not because of Darren.  I have a new baby.  She has black hair, fantastic brown eyes and adores me.  Her  name is Molly.  I'm sooo in love with her!!!  No, I did not have a human child.  Remember....hysterectomy.  LOL  Nope....I adopted a dog from the humane society.  I am about as pleased as punch.  She is an amazing animal and I'm so glad that I get to be her forever home.  Nothing makes me happier.  She is my therapy.  She had her doggie brand hysterectomy yesterday so she is a tad on the "Please don't make me do anything" mode.  BUT....get this....she is housebroke, obeys commands like sit and lay down.  When I tell her to go lay down, she goes right to her bed.  It's amazing considering she was a stray.  My guess is that she got lost and her family is missing her dearly.  But as we all know, the humane society keeps them in an area for lost dogs for a period of time before they put the babies up for adoption.  Molly had just been put up for adoption when I came in.  She and I just clicked and that was all she wrote.  Now for Darren's reaction...  I told him I wanted to get a dog. He said "no, it isn't practical".  I was cranky but let it go.  He slept on it and then told me that I could go get a dog.  *Tracey's ears perk up*.  You don't have to tell me twice to do something that I want to do.  I went and found Molly.  Bought her and then told Darren on Thursday that he would have to go to the vet to pick her up Friday after she was spayed.  He shook his head and said "I can't believe you got a dog"  I looked at him and said "You told me I could!"  Now this is the funny part....his reply to that???  "I know I did but I didn't think you would do it!!!"  Now please....if you give a woman a credit card with no limit on it and tell her to go shopping, what do you think she is going to do???  DUH!!!!!  Anyway...Molly is awesome and when I can figure out how to put pictures on here, I will get one of her.  Anyone care to tell me how I can do that?  LOL

       Not always a loser   I cannot believe it...for the first time since I started bowling, I have over 300 for a series tonight.  I am in complete shock.  Maybe getting my own ball helped.  I hope it did.  I wasn't too keen on spending over $100 for a bowling ball.  It was a good night tonight though.  Other than still suffering from the Paxil withdrawls...still very dizzy and lightheaded.  I'm hating that.  Getting used to it but still hating it.  I hope that it will be gone before we leave for California.  I want to enjoy my vacation.  Imagine that...enjoying vacation.  LOL  Is this blog boring tonight?  Yep...I whole heartedly admit to it being boring.  I really don't have too much to say tonight.  Maybe I'm just too exhausted and not functioning with all brainwaves.  Any thoughts?

       Why oh why oh why?   Thrift stores were invented for people like me.  I just amaze myself sometimes when I go shopping at these places.   We all know that I am unemployed so I have to spend very wisely.  Well today...I did spend very wisely and I did pretty darned good if I say so myself.  This is what I found today:  1 pair of Steve Madden sandles  (.99 cents thank you very much!) 1 pair white mule sneakers 1 pair of chunky shoes that zip up on both sides.  Quite cool according to my 9 year old. 1 ADIDAS windbreaker 1 pink hoodie 2 white tanks (Eddie Bauer and Liz) 1 denim skirt (very cute and not too short) 2 pairs denim capri's (Old Navy) 2 shortalls (CK denim and Christopher and Banks khaki) 1 fleece 1/2 zip sweatshirt (Columbia sportswear) 1 set short/top jammies (Victoria's Secret) 9 tops/shirts (Liz, Ralph Lauren, CK, Christopher and Banks, Style and Co.)  Quite the haul huh?  Now for the grand total...ya ready for this?  Are you sure?  Got ya sitting on the edge of your seat for this one don't I?  Drum roll please...                               Less than $60.00!!!   Am I good or am I good?  I did buy a few items that weren't clothes like a really cute Tuscan style canister set, some really cool breastmilk bottles that are new and say "My mommy's milk" on the side (Darren's cousin's wife is preggers and her baby shower is this weekend so I will put the bottles and some other doo dad's in a cute basket), cocktail glasses to put candles in, a couple of brand new candles, knick knacs for the grandparents.  I just love it when I get great buys like that.  Makes my whole day.  Now I am ready for our trip to Southern California in 3 weeks.  Like they say....CALIFORNIA HERE I COME!!!

       Paxil flu   A word to the wise... NEVER NEVER NEVER START TAKING AN SSRI....!!!!   I was on paxil for 9 months.  I had to quit cold turkey because paxil costs $75.00 a month when you don't have insurance. As you know, I don't have insurance.  I am now going through the worst thing I have ever been through in my life!!!  I've been through some really bad stuff in my life but nothing that would compare to this.  I was reading some online posts after doing a google search and the withdrawls from paxil are compared to heroine withdrawls.  HEROINE????  Please...I've never in my life taken any kind of illegal drug.  Why would I want to take a "legal" drug that can cause the same withdrawl effect as heroine?  I wouldn't.  Had I known that this would be the effect I was going to get, I definately would not have taken paxil.  Emotionally, I'm better now being off the paxil than when I was on it but the withdrawls symptoms are bad.    urlLink Read this  if you and your doctor are considering putting you on Paxil.  I'm not a psycho woman and there is no way I would consider suicide but with what I went through yesterday...I wanted to die.  I'm not 100% today but I can tell you that I'm better than what I was.  I will never take Paxil again.  Not after this.  The doc's don't know about this drug.  All they do know is that you have to taper off of it.  They know that going "cold turkey" is not good.  Tell me something...if they know that, then why put a patient on it!?!?!?!  Only addictive drugs are meant to be "tapered" off.  I didn't do a lot of research on Paxil because I had been on it before and when I quit cold turkey last time, I was never like this.  That is why I wasn't concerned about it this time.   I was in for a very shocking surprise.  One that I will not ever want to experience again.  What is heartbreaking is...I was a drug addict.  In every sense of the word.  Only my doctor and the medical people who are supposed to take care of me, made me an addict.  I'm off the Paxil and I will return to normal again but getting back to normal is going to be a tough road.

       The search...   I just wonder why it takes so long to find a job?  I'm qualified.  I have the skills.  I have the personality.  I'm not a 100 ton squid.  I just don't get it.  I went for yet another interview today.  This one sounds more than perfect for me.  Full time through June...possibly July.  Goes to part time in August.  I am working towards starting college in the fall.  Work part time.  School full time.  Mom full time.  Significant other full time.  I can handle that.  Who couldn't?  I'm just so tired of getting the "reject" letters.  It's always the same thing...Thank you for applying with ABC company and although you have great skills, we have decided to go with another applicant.  Can someone explain this to me????  I will be so glad to get my schooling done and doing what I really want to do.   My goal is to go to nursing school.  I want to become an RN and work in either Labor and  Delivery or *gasp* Trauma.  Well if I am wanting to go to school in the fall...I need to get my financial aid stuff done or this mom isn't going anywhere.    Hey!!!  I just thought of this....I'm going back to school after 19 years and my youngest daughter is going to be starting kindergarten.  Wow...what a mind blower that one was.

       Morning   I will be the first to admit, I am not a morning person.  Especially if I have not had any caffeine.  This morning would be one of those mornings.  I'm thinking that I really need it today since Molly woke me up at Midnight and then at 4:00am.  Me being the good dog owner that I am, I took her outside.  Wanna know what she did?  NOTHING!!!  She just sniffed around and checked out the sky.  Now, any other time of day this would be fine.  When I'm trying to sleep?  NOT A CHANCE!!!  I did look at the bright side of it though.  The stars were awesome last night.  Not a cloud in the sky.    With my lack of "good sleep" last night, I told Darren that I was going to sleep a couple of hours more this morning.  Being the loving man that he is, he came in to kiss me goodbye for the day.  My issue with that?  HE STUCK HIS COLD HANDS ON ME!!!  There is nothing worse than waking up to ice cold hands on your warm body.  I will get him back though.  One day...I will get him back.....mwah hahahahahaha!!!!!

Just when I am all nicely irritated at him,  he does something totally out of character.  Guess you could say that he does love me and really wants our relationship to work.  Wasn't sure of that until now.  :)

Just a few things to take care of and I will be ready to go.  Darren...amazing man that he is....started packing today.  I started the beginning of the week.  I'm almost done with the packing portion of our trip.  All that is left for me is to go to  urlLink Yakima , drop off Molly at  urlLink doggy daycare , go have lunch with K. at Major's.  That would be THE best hamburger joint in Yakima.  They have beer battered french fries to die for.  After lunch, I drop J off with Darren's parents and then I come home.  Then it's up to Darren to do all the driving.    I had a job interview today.  Went fantastically well.  I will know more after I get home from vaykay.  Until then...ttfn and have a great week.  I know I will.  :)

       Calgon take me away....   Do you know why we need a vacation?  BECAUSE WE ARE TIRED FROM TRYING TO GET EVERYTHING PACKED AND READY TO GO!!!!  Good grief but I'm exhausted.  I haven't even begun to get J's things ready.  I won't pack  urlLink Darren's  stuff.  That man is too anal about what he wants.  He can pack his own bag.  I know...bad Tracey but I am smarter than your average bear.  Trust me on this one.  We leave for Seattle on Friday after Darren gets off of work.  We are going to stay with my dearest friend,  urlLink Robert  and then he will drive us to the airport Saturday morning.  Love that man!!!  He has found a woman!!!  37 years old and he has never been married.  He is good looking, sweet and has an amazing sense of humor.  I'm happy for him.  He deserves to be happy and get married and all of that fun stuff.  Saw something funny this morning.  I was sitting here at the computer like most mornings and heard a thud.  I looked up just in time to see  urlLink Molly  get off of the ground and get back on the couch.  LOL  Had I not been half asleep, I would have laughed hysterically.

       20 years and still going strong   Flashback...1982, sophomore year, Kumler Field, early morning band/flag team/drill practice, standing in the cold practing the next weeks football game halftime show.  I was standing next to a girl who was quite short and very quiet.  I, on the other hand, not as short and definately not quiet.  We started chatting and before we knew it, we were as close as you can get being friends.  We eventually learned that our birthdays were exactly a week apart (she is older), loved boys, and just enjoyed talking.  Now when I say that she was quiet, I am talking wallflower type.  She was cute and very personable but just not as outgoing as I was.  Imagine my shock when I found out that she was trying out for cheer!  Imagine my even bigger shock to watch tryouts and seeing her do moves that I didn't know she was capable of doing.  All I could tell you is that my voice was all but gone after she was done.  She blew everyone's mind that day.  Yes, she made the cheer squad.  I made the drill team.  Even though we ran in different circles after that, we remained friends.  Yes, we had our fights.  Doozies sometimes.  We always made up.  Only she and I would be able to write a note back and forth in Interior Design class that would make a sailor blush.   I could still walk up to her today and ask her "Hey!!!  Have any emergencies lately?" and she will know exactly what I am talking about.  Fast forward...2004 My dear friend from  urlLink high school  and I have gone seperate ways.  Granted, we keep in touch from time to time but life has taken us down different roads.  Today she showed me that true friendship knows no time retraints or limits.  I was going to have to get rid of Molly because I can't find anyone to watch her while Darren and I are on vacation.  She owns a doggy daycare in my hometown.  She said that she will watch  my Molly...no charge.  I just need to provide her food and blankies.  What my friend has done is what true, honest to goodness friendship is all about.  I now know why we were friends during high school.  We were meant to be.  God, the fates, destiny or whatever you believe in...there is always a reason.   One day...there will be a time when I can do for her what she has done for me.

      I must always thank  urlLink Danelle for these things.  Without her, none of this would be possible.  ;)   Where were you when?   1) John F. Kennedy was shot? (11/22/1963) I wasn't even a glimmer in my biological mothers eye.  2) Mt. St. Helen's blew? (5/18/1980) Sitting in Sunday School watching it get darker and darker outside.  I lived 80 miles east of the mountain.  Fear is watching it turn pitch black at noon and not being able to see a foot in front of you.  Fear is seeing lightning coming from nowhere.  Fear is not knowing what kind of affect the ash will have on things.  Fear is your mom driving home from church and realizing that she was driving on the wrong side of the road because she couldn't see anything. Happiness is knowing that there will be no school for over a week.  Mt. St. Helens is not something I care to experience again.  3) John Lennon gunned down? (12/08/1980) I honestly don't remember.  I know that I was in Jr. High.  4) The Challenger exploded? (1/28/1986) Babysitting and catnapping (it was ugly morning!!!) and looking up to see the challenger explode.   5) The 7.1 earthquake hit San Francisco? (10/07/1989) Living in Seattle and worried about a friend who lived down there.  6) The Berlin Wall Fell? (11/07/1989) Still in Seattle.  7) The Gulf War began? (01/16/1991) I don't remember when it began.  All I remember is wearing the yellow ribbons at work and watching it on TV.  8) OJ Simpson was chased in his White Bronco? (06/17/1994) Didn't see it. 8a) And when the verdict was read? (10/03/1995) Working for C*vanaughs Hotel and watching it in the lounge on my break.  9) The Afred P. Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City was bombed? (04/19/1995) Working for the above hotel and being in complete shock  10) Princess Di was killed? (08/31/1997) I was with a guy I had met on the internet.  We had just gotten to my parents house and when I saw the news I cried like a baby.  I couldn't believe that she was gone.  11) Bush was first announced president? (11/07/2000) Working with Alzheimers patients.  Wondering why the hell everything was so messed up and how the world must think that United States can't even elect a leader.  12) Terrorists destroyed the WTC? (09/11/2001) I had just moved to Everett (north of Seattle).  I stayed home from work that day.  My friend called and woke me up screaming at me to turn on the radio (I couldn't get tv reception) that the twin towers had fallen.  I thought she was full of caca and playing a really bad joke on me.  I got some fuzzy reception and all I could do was cry while watching it.  13) Columbia disintegrated during re-entry over Texas? (02/01/2003) I didn't hear about it until I had gotten moved into a  new place.  Why wasn't this more of a big issue like Challenger was?  14) The Madrid trains were attacked? (03/11/2004) Sitting home.  It amazes me the disasters we have lived through in such a short period of time.  What is next?

       Superficial...   How stupid and dumb can I be?  Darren picked up the pictures from our vacation this morning.  No wonder Darren has no interest in me.  I'm fat.  I've gained weight since he met me.  I'm not the size 8 he met.  I'm now a size 10.  Of course he isn't going to want to make love to a cow.   Then as I think about it I wonder "Did he really love me, the me inside, or was it all because I was thin and pretty?"   I was cooking his breakfast, I can't eat or I have a tendency to get sick...wonder why, and I realized that all of the men I have dated have had issues with weight.  From when I was 18 until now, almost 20 years later.  All of them have always made comments about my weight.  "Don't get too fat Tracey. Do you think you should eat that Tracey?, I'm just not attracted to you anymore, Tracey"  Good grief!!!!  It's not like I weigh 300 pounds!!!  I'm 150!!!!  I have gained weight!!!  I had a freaking hysterectomy in September and the hormones I am on cause me to gain weight!!!  I am unemployed and I was depressed!!!!  Why the hell can't a man accept me for ME!?!?!?!?!?  I AM NOT SOME $%^*(^ BARBIE DOLL!!!!  *wanting to stop crying*

       I wanna!!!!   I really feel like posting today or at least right now and for the life of me, I can't even figure out where to start. My mind is a total mush pot.  I don't know if I'm coming or going.  A good thing happened today...I got to talk to K's dad...ok, talking to him isn't always such a good thing but we are getting along and that is a bonus since we have been fighting since K's conception and she is now 9 years old!!!  He called me and said that he will meet me at the junction of Hwy 97 and Hwy 2.  Now for me..this is a good thing since that is only about 20 minutes away.  Typically on his visitation weekends, I drive an hour and 15 minutes one way to drop her off.  This gave me much pleasure.  :)  He is being nice to me and has been for over a year now.  I'm just hoping that it continues...maybe the man has finally grown up...nahhhh!!!!  LOL

       Whimper whine   I have read my few previous posts and I sound like a pathetic drama queen.  I hate that.  I used to be a drama queen and swore that I would never do it again.  Why am I reverting back????  What happened to the strong and independent Tracey from a year and 1/2 ago?  I want her back.  She was someone who wouldn't put up with shit from anyone, least of all a man.  I know that Darren does not deserve the love that the girls and I have for him.  I know that he isn't worth all of this pain and hurt.  I know that I would be better off without him in my life.  SO WHY CAN'T I GET THE KAHONA'S AND GET OUT????????

       Cookin' and cleanin'   I'm exhausted.  I don't work outside of the home but I'm wiped out.  Started laundry today at 7am!!!  I'm still doing it and it's 9:30pm!!!  I have about 3 loads left and of course we all know that once the weekend gets here, I will have more.  I did get a lot done today...maybe it's because I'm trying to not think about where my life is right now.  Actually, I really don't know where my life is right now.  Utter confusion reigns supreme at this point.  I hate that feeling.  I hate making life altering decisions also.  I did make some decisions today though...I cooked ribs, mashed taters, corn and rolls.  Was a pretty darned good decision I do believe.  Tomorrow will be sweet and sour meatballs, rice and salad.  I'm drowning my worries in my cooking.  I guess that is a good thing.  The kids love it.  I did finish painting the bathroom today.  I started the blasted thing the beginning of February.  Had one little part to finish but never did it.  Well...ta da...I did it today.  Put an ivy border up in the bathroom too.  Guess all of this turmoil has caused some good things to happen.  I'm getting a lot of stuff done around the house.  ;)  Anyway...I'm coping pretty well considering.  I have my  moments of utterly breaking down in tears but for the most part I'm just in a fog and going through the motions.  I know that is not a good thing but it's the best I can do for now.

       Friends and kind words   I am so grateful for my friends in real life and online.  Without them, I would be a miserable and sloppy mess with all of this.  Thank you  urlLink Stacey  and Stephanie.  You guys are awesome and I appreciate everything.  Stephanie sent me something last night.  At this point, it fits my life with Darren perfectly.   One day you will want me like I have wanted you. One day you will need me like I have needed you. One day you will love me and I won’t love you.

      I'm not as angry as I was yesterday.  I've calmed down quite a bit.  Darren has admitted to needing help.  He knows that he has to see a therapist to work out what is bothering him.  We may not stay together.  That is the horrid truth I have to face.  I may not be what he wants in life.  I believe that at this point in time, he doesn't know what he wants in life.  The ball is in his court now.  I'm going to live my life and do the best I can with what I have right now.  It may be that I will be alone for the rest of my life.  I'm not happy with that but I am ok with it.  For now, I will let Darren do what needs to be done to take care of himself mentally and emotionally.

       Understanding?   Good grief...sometimes I feel that Darren is trying to find reasons to get out of our relationship.  Last night we had a huge talk and he said that it's possible that he keeps me at a distance with him because of his past hurts and relationships.  He is looking for perfection and if he doesn't find it, he doesn't have to open up to someone completely.  If he doesn't open up to someone, he won't get hurt.  A defense mechanism. At least that is what I think.  Any thoughts?

       Fun and endings   Had a fantastic trip in California.  Well...most of it.  All was well until Saturday night.  Darren and I broke up then.  I don't know if it's a mutual thing but it's ok.  He isn't ready for a family yet.  He wants to still do the things he did when he was single.  I just wish he had figured that out a year and 1/2 ago.  Would have saved a lot of heartache on a lot of people.  Especially my girls.

       The wait begins...   Interview went really well.  I know better than to get my hopes up but...she said that I have the experience they are looking for and I'm at the top of her list.   She said she will make her decision by tomorrow afternoon.  She wants someone to start on Monday and imagine that...I can start on Monday.  Not great money but it's better than unemployment.  :)

       Lack of sleep and Trace Atkins   Ya know...Trace Atkins has a song out "One hot mama".  The guy in the song loves his wife even though she isn't what she was when he married her.  He still wants to make love to her and thinks she is still as hot as ever...even after having kids and family life.  I'm beginning to think that it's all a fantasy.  There is no such thing as a man loving a woman for who she is, no matter what she looks like.  It just can't be real...if it was, why would Darren want out?  I'm ok with it though.  I'm not hideous by any means.  I'm not the one losing here.  He has lost his family.  I still have my girls.  I still have my integrity, priorities and values.  What does he have?  A drum kit, the band he is in and a computer full of songs.  I would say that I came out on the better end.  I'll never have to go to bed alone.  It may not be with a man but I have 2 daughters who love me unconditionally and they love to cuddle.  Just as a sidenote...last night Molly, our dog, widdled on the kitchen floor at 3am.  Darren was so pissed that he decided to wake me up.  I had not been able to fall asleep until after 1AM.  After being woken up for something that I could do nothing about, I was up for another hour and 1/2.  He did apologize for it this morning but I don't understand what his point was in waking me up.  * shaking my head*  I gotta get my own place...I gotta get my life back.  If I don't, I am going to lose everything that I am.

       Stupid stupid stupid   I did what I said I wasn't going to do.  I got my hopes up.  I got them dashed tonight.  I tried being cuddly with Darren.  No reaction.  Just stared at the TV.  I asked him if he is still not sure about us and he said "Yes.  I just don't know what I want".  How's that for bursting my bubble?  Welcome back to planet earth, Tracey.  Did you enjoy your trip to Neverland?  How can I be so stupid and braindead?  He said that he hasn't forgotten the counseling appointment.  I'm beginning to wonder why he even wants to go.  He won't even talk to me about what is going on.  He said "Let's talk about it tomorrow".  Know what?  TOMORROW NEVER COMES!!!!  I would love to just smack my head against a brickwall for being as stupid as I am.  What made me think that he wanted to try?  Oh...maybe him doing family night last night with me and the girls, him kissing me, hugging me, touching me gently on my arm before I fall asleep, him not swearing in front of the girls, being considerate of my feelings and of the girls, not flying off the handle for things that the girls do...yes, I am a certified idiot.  Fell for it hook, line and sinker.  My question is....when will I ever learn?  When I quit falling for men!!!!  That is when...No, I won't go the other way either.  Just not attracted to women.  LOL  Ok, poor attempt at humor.  I give up.  There is no man out there for me.  Think I will date again?  Sure.  I'm not dead.  Think I will get seriously involved again?  Not a chance in hell.  Who needs it?  I don't.  Not anymore.  Been hurt one too many times.  Darren ended it for me.  I can think of no man out there who is worth this...well, maybe my dad but he doesn't count in matters like these.  I'm going to get this job with the car dealership, I'm going to save my money and I'm moving out.  Let him deal with the loss of the best thing he has ever had.  Let him die a lonely, bitter old man.  He made his bed.  Now he can lie in it.  Alone.

       Ahhhh.....sun.....   A gorgeous day here.  Other than the stupid wind that seems to come with spring here in Wenatchee.  Other than that...this is a beautiful town.  Small, quaint...  Had a job interview today.  I didn't like it.  It's for a grocery store chain here in the west called Fred Meyer.  Love the store. Not too sure if I can deal with working there.  They would want to start me in the deli...ya know, serving the pre-made stuff and the chicken that you buy for picnics.  I do not want to come home everyday smelling like chicken!!!  So with that in mind, I was bummed out coming home.  That is...until I heard the message on the machine.  A high tone car dealership here in town wants to interview me.  Great job...receptionist/cashier position.  Monday - Friday 8-5.  Pretty cool huh?  The downside to that?  I used to work for 2 seperate car dealerships in Yakima (my hometown) and the last one is where I met my ex-husband.  The creep.  The weasel.  The bastard.  The spawn of satan. Mr. Holier than Thou. I know you don't know my story about my ex husband but he is a man who needs to be in prison but they would have to keep him from the general population as he would be at the bottom on their totem pole when it comes to crimes...I'm sure you can get what I'm saying here.  I have horrid memories from car dealerships...sexual harrassment, my ex husband....but I know that I can't judge all of them the same.  Hopefully, should I get this job and I should because I am TOTALLY qualified for it, things would be different.  Besides, I am not single so there would be no fear of meeting another slimeball there.  Hmmm.....just might consider it.  At this point....I JUST WANT TO WORK!!!!!!  Ok...I'm done venting.  ;)

After getting Chip's autograph and picture, I wanted his.  After him extorting 2 hugs and a kiss on the nose, I got the picture and autograph.  He wanted money but settled for the kiss.  It was sooooo fun!!!!  I've got one of Pluto but can't find it.  I'll add it when I can get my pic of me and Goofy also.  Oh wait!!!   urlLink Here  is a pic of me after meeting the Goof-man!

       Not letting my guard down or hopes up...   I told Darren last night that I will get back to what I was when he met me.  When he met me I was a size 8, had a good job and quite happy with who I was and where I was.  I will be back there again.  I'm letting my hair grow long again, I'm going to lose the weight and I'm going to get a great paying job.  I told him that when I do get back there, he will regret his decision to leave me.  He said that he knows he will.  He is regretting it now. We are both at a 50/50 place right now.  50% stay/50% leave.  I'm going in circles here and not sure how to get off of this carousel.    He has been trying.  Really trying hard.  I can see it.  His temper has gone WAY down.  His swearing at nothing has almost stopped, at least in front of the kids.  He kissed me today.  I was shocked.  Not a passionate kiss but just a small peck.  I didn't know what to do.  I don't know what to do.  I don't know if he is just settling back into what we were or if he really is trying to start over and try and make this work.    We have an appointment on May 3 to see a therapist.  He is willing to go.  That is a plus I think....but can he accept me for me?  All of me...not just the picture of me.  I asked him if he was embarassed to be seen with me and he flat out said "NO! I have no reason to be embarassed.  You are very beautiful".  That was a good thing...I don't know right now.  I really don't.  I know other men are interested in me and that is a boost to the ego but I cannot see myself with anyone other than Darren.  Sometimes I wish I could.  Darren needs to talk to someone outside of me or his circle of friends.  He needs a therapist to talk to him and help him realize that he is expecting way too much out of relationships and needs to be realistic about them.  His wants are not even in this galaxy.  I just don't understand.  Maybe it's because I have been married before.  Maybe it's because I have kids and I know that there isn't anyone out there who is perfect.  I wish I could say I don't love him.  I wish I could say that I am going to get out.  I can't say any of that.  Right now all I can say is...funny, I don't know what I can say that is for sure.

       Gone...   Molly is gone.  I didn't cry when my parents took her but it's tough here in the house without her.  Makes me dispise the slumlord even more.  I'm borderline tears right now because I'm so used to her loving on me in the mornings....even Darren was upset last night because she was gone.  Darren and I went out for dinner and drinks last night.  We still have a lot to work on.  Do I think that our relationship is going to survive?  I don't know.  Do I want it to survive?  Somedays, yes.  Somedays, no.  I know that I can't expect him to change overnight.  He said last night that he stopped being attracted to me when I lost my self-confidence.  Funny...I lost my self confidence, at least when he is around, when I found out what he told a married tramp in Texas right after my hysterectomy, what he thought of me.  It's amazing how your self-confidence goes out the window when you find out that your partner has to fantasize about other women just to make love to you.  I'm totally confident around other men.  I just have problems around Darren.  I don't allow him to see me naked and if he does, it's by accident.  I'm working on getting my confidence back.  It's like he cheated on me...only online.  It's just a trust I have to get back.  One that won't just happen overnight.  I don't know if it will at all.  That is why we are going to counseling and working on the relationship.  It's going to take work and time.

       Moving...   Well....told Darren what happened today with the slumlord.  He has put his foot down...we are moving out of this "shithole".  He is sick of the bastard as much as I am.  So with that said...looking for a new place to live on the east side of the river...*waving at Kris*  Woo Hoo!!!!!  I'm still bummin about Molly but I know she will have a good home with Debbie.  Darren and I have never had a landlord as bad as the one we have now.  I'm just glad we will be out of thits place by the end of the month.  I can't deal with it anymore.  :)

       Stupid ass landlord...   Title says it all.  I hate living here and we need to get the hell out.  Jerk tells me when we moved in that I could paint the bathroom...I did that.  His wife said that it's nice to have someone in the house who will work on it...little did I know that I was expected to pay it out of my own pocket!!!  Also...me being the schmuck that I am, I forgot to talk to him about us getting Molly.  He has now told us that we are to get rid of her.  Need I remind anyone...we live in a house with a decent sized backyard.  We clean up her poo's and she does not destroy things.  Is this man an asshole?  Oh yeah...in ever respect of that word.  Does slumlord ring any bells here folks?  BTW....he is having the downstairs apartment carpet steam cleaned!!!  The SOB didn't even have the upstairs, where we live, cleaned after the guy moved out!!!!  I had to sweep, mop, clean the oven, stove, fridge, vaccum and everything else to get this livable.  Oh man...I'm so not happy right now.  Luckily, I have a friend who told me that if we couldn't keep Molly, that she would take her.  At least I know that Molly will have a good home.  I cannot stand our  urlLink landlord  ...correction....slumlord.

       Yawn...   I am exhausted!!!  Good grief but it's been a long day.  Woke up at 6:30am and hit the snooze...then turned off the blasted alarm before it went off again.  Darren scared the daylights out of me by saying "Don't oversleep honey...I saw you turn off your alarm"  Good grief!!!  Don't scare me like that!!!  Once I got my butt moving, I had to take Kyla to school and then Jordin to the clinic for x-rays.  Poor kid.  Has some serious problem with her intestinal function or colon.  Not sure which.  She has another doc appt in Yakima next Friday so we can get the results from the x-rays.  My poor baby...:(  Once her appt was over, I went to work and didn't take a lunch to make up for the time I missed this morning.  Now...that wouldn't have been too bad had it not been....ssssssssssllllllllllllloooooooooowwwwwwwwwwer than a seven year itch.  We watched part of Oprah this afternoon..that is how slow it was.  5:00 could not get here fast enough.  Got home and did my other fulltime job...making dinner, dishes, laundry, bathing Jordin, bandaging a cut that Kyla got from dropping a glass, conversing with Darren, feeding the dog,  and feeding the fish.  All of this was done in a 2 hour time span.  I need a beer....better yet...a  urlLink Cadillac Margarita .  Haven't tried it with the chambord but I can only guess that it makes it even better...although it's tough to improve on perfection....:)

       Wondering...   I've been sitting back and reading some of my posts...well all of my posts for the past month and I have to say....I'M A PATHETIC DWEEB!  All I talk about is my trouble with Darren. Good grief, you would think that I don't have any life outside of Darren.  I do ya know...well....at least I will now that I'm working.  :)  Being unemployed for 4 months does not make a happy Tracey.  I did find an apartment that I might go look at.  It's for low-income families...yes, I qualify being a single parent.  Not too sure why they say it's low income when the rent is $525/month!!!  Good grief, there are apartments out there that are a little less than that....but....they might not be nice ones.  So...with that said...I'm keeping my options open should Darren and I make the final decision...after counseling and seeing how thigs go this month...that we are not going to stay together.  Speaking of staying together...I started packing things in boxes the other day.  Darren looked really uncomforable with that.  Jordin also made him cry when she said "It's ok daddy...you just have to stand strong".  Very wise for a 4 year old. I honestly think that the reality of it all hit him with the packing.  He knows that if we split up, I won't come back.  It will be over permanently.  He is making plans for us to go camping in about 3 weeks with a friend of his so that is a positive thing.  I just can't get my hopes up.  I don't want or need my heart broken anymore than it already is.  I want to thank my friends....Stephanie, Danelle and Stacey for all of their kind words and advice.  You guys are awesome and I cannot thank you enough for helping me keep my head on straight.  If I didn't have you guys, who knows where I would be now....

       Day 2....   Day 1 went pretty well.  Great group of people to work with.  It's not the most mentally stimulating job in the world but it is a job and I'm not complaining.  :)  It's very laid back for a car dealership.  I don't have to dress up and that is a good thing.  I can wear jeans and sneakers!!!  Pretty cool huh?  Shocked me to be honest with you.  The other 2 dealerships I worked for, I had to dress up everyday...didn't make sense when I was down by the service area and around the oil/grease and dirt.  So now I have a job...and I'm happy about that.  :)

       Movie!!!!   Ok...I'm not one for tv movies but I really want to see  urlLink 10.5   What is frightening is...it's not so far fetched and living in the Pacific Northwest...scares the hell out of me.  I felt the one that Seattle had in 2001.  Not a comfortable feeling when something you think is solid starts moving.  Hopefully this movie will be good...looks like it will be.  A UCLA professor's prediction that a 6.5 (or higher) earthquake will hit the California desert between now and Sept. 5...that is a danged big quake!!!  Question is....will it trigger more?

       Questions...   Darren and I had a HUGE fight Friday night.  I said some things that I shouldn't have.  Called him names that I didn't think I would ever do.  Of course, alcohol does things that make you do what you normally wouldn't.  We had decided that it's over and no way in hell will it be fixed.  He almost went out to sleep in his Explorer.  I talked him out of it.  Saturday we went to the Apple Blossom Parade and things were ok.  Not too stressful.  When we got home, J. decided to throw a rock and busted out the taillight on my car.  I had to walk away from her I was so pissed.  I went into the bedroom and started bawling.  Darren came in and did something that he has never done...he held me while I cried and...smoothed my hair like you would a child who is crying.   He has never and I mean NEVER done anything like that. That got me crying more.  Good grief I'm tired of crying.  I cried yet again today...Jordin was talking about "her family", meaning Darren's family.  That did it...I lost it all over again.  Darren came in and...you guessed it...held me again.  After I took my shower today he had a proposition...he wants to see what will happen with us in the next month.  He is going to see a counselor tomorrow.  I start my new job tomorrow.  He told me that the band is going to start recording and will have pretty much set days for that but they will not be doing anything on the weekends.  He said that would be time for us to do things.  He also said that if we don't have plans, he would like to go fishing with his buddy Duke or golfing with his friend Tony.  I told him that I don't have any problem with that and I had told him that a long time ago.  Do I know what is going to happen?  No.  Do I love Darren?  Yes.  In spite of how much of a jerk he can be and has been, I still love him.  I shouldn't....I know.  But I do.  I see the good in him that is there.  He is not all the asshole that he wants to present himself to be.  I even told him that.   Danelle told me about a book  urlLink Love must be Tough .  I told Darren that I wanted to get it but I don't have the money.  He said that when he gets paid this week, we will get it.  Just from reading some of the reviews, it sounds like it will be a big help.  Whether Darren and I stay together or not.  It may give me some insight on why I choose the men I do.  I have a lot of healing to do.  I have to read this book because I know that I cannot heal on my own.  I need help.  If Darren wants this to work, he has to read it also.  At this point...we are at a standstill as to the moving situation.

       For my friends...   If one day you feel like crying... Call me. I don't promise that I will make you laugh But I can cry with you.  If one day you want to run away Call me. I don't promise to ask you to stop, But I can run with you.  If one day you don't want to listen to anybody  Call me I promise to be very quiet.  But...  If one day you call  And there is no answer, come fast Perhaps I need you.  ~ Author Unknown

       Packing   I do believe that there is nothing worse in this world than moving.  Ok, now that I thought about it...there are worse things but go with me on this one.  We are moving next weekend.  We are finishing up packing this weekend.  I've got quite a bit done actually.  The decorations are down and in boxes.  Now it's just weeding through the crap that we have accumulated in 9 months...most of it garbage.  Good grief it's amazing what you hang onto.  I've got most of my stuff done.  I don't dare touch Darren's things.  He is THE worst packrat I have ever met.  Keeps just about everything!!! The man has ticket stubs from concerts he saw 20 years ago!!!  Believe me...he has a lot of stubs.  I don't touch anything.  I just put it aside and let him go through the stuff.  Much easier on me that way.  :)  We are going to the liquor store tomorrow.  No...not for tequila...but boxes.  Darren is 110% set on camping Memorial weekend.  IS HE NUTS?????  I hate camping on holiday weekends.  Everyone and their dog is out then.  I'm not going to say no though.  He has a major camping itch that needs to be scratched.  Who am I to deny him that?  I don't think it would be fair to not go.  He deserves it.  He works his hiney off and needs some relax time.  Then again...so do I.  Especially after moving.

       Correction...   I have TWO sick children.  I kept Jordin home today.  How about that...not going in only 2 weeks after starting a new job?  SUCKS!  Anyway...Kyla wasn't feeling great but told her that she should go to school and if she started feeling worse to come home.  2 hours later...Kyla is home.  They are now eating peanut butter sandwiches and watching Scooby Doo.  Oooo....Harlem Globetrotters are on with Scooby Doo.  Anyone remember that?  LOL  Wow...do I feel old.    I bought a DVD for Darren last night and had it sitting by the monitor when he came home from practice.  This morning he got up and said "Thank you for the movie honey!  Where did you find it?  You really didn't have to buy it for me."  I told him "I know I didn't have to buy it for you.  They had it at Target and I knew that you loved it."  He thanked me again but I had to say "Honey, this is what people do for people they love.  Buy things or do things for them even though they don't have to."  He gave me a HUGE hug after that one. I'm sure I shocked him but he was genuinely surprised and happy.  Not a bad return for a $10 DVD huh?  The man has just got to not be so tight with his money.  Something like what I did for him would mean the world to me if he did the same thing.  Not that I am asking him to spend money on me but to just think of me when he sees something that he knows I would love.  Am I asking too much here?

       Never knew...   Well...we started counseling yesterday.  It went pretty well.  Somethings were brought out that I didn't know.  Things that I was honestly shocked about.  We have another appointment on May 26.  Things seem to be looking up but who knows.  We shall see if he can follow through on what we are working towards.  I have set some goals for myself and I am going to reach them.  I'm going to reach them for me and only me.  Sometimes I wonder if there is just too much water under the bridge and this won't work out.  There are days I seriously think that he is just being nice and moving to the new place with us (me and the girls) so it will make it easier on me.  He knows that I can't afford to move on my own.  If he moves with us, he would be helping pay.  Then once we are settled, he will say that it's not working and he will move out.  I don't know...maybe I'm just over-analyzing things.  At this point, anything is possible.  All I do know is that I'm moving to a nicer place and if Darren does move out, I can afford it on my own.

       So sleepy...   Well I have a sick child...that should read "Jordin got her allergies from her spermdonor".  Poor kid, she is so stuffed up and her eyes are totally glossed over.  Breaks my heart.  Darren should be bringing home some Benadryl.  That will knock her out for the night.  I know that I should be doing more things around the house to pack up but I'm just not up for it...I'm draggin' hiney fer sure.    I just walked into the living room and Jordin looked at me and said "Mommy, you know what I could use?"  I said "What honey?"  She said "I could really use a hug."  Did that just melt my heart (and yours) or what?  It is moments like these that make me love being a mom.

       Water Cooler talk...   There has been a lot of talk today wherever you go about Nick Berg. I am guilty of being one of the talkers.  I am one of the Americans who has seen the video.  I saw it last night.  I can't even begin to describe my feelings at watching that atrocity.  I didn't know whether to cry or throw up.  Then I sat back and thought that it was very much like a Hollywood movie.  Then...sadness that we have been so desensitized by those movies that we can't even comprehend fact from fiction.  All I could say...to myself since Darren wasn't home...Dear God, what is this world coming to?  I'm still in shock.  I'm sickened. I'm sad.  I'm pissed as all get out.  I'm frustrated.  How many more people have to die for this???  Dear God...make it stop!!!

       Rainy days and Mondays...   Ok..it's not raining but it was thinking about it today.  I hate Mondays.  The weekend is just never long enough.  It was actually a decent weekend.  The drive to Yakima and home yesterday wasn't my idea of a good time but all in all, not too bad.  It was a gorgeous day so I can't complain too much.  Things are going ok with me and Darren.  Our counseling appointment is on Wednesday at 9:00am.  He is looking forward to it as much as I am.  We were talking Friday night and he said that I had said some pretty mean things to him last Friday.  I said that I knew I did but I also apologized for them.  He has yet to accept my apology.  When I found out about the tramp in Texas whom he had cybersex with, he apologized for it profusely and I accepted it.  Why can't he accept mine?  That I don't understand.  Guess I will find out on Wednesday.  I know, or at least feel that we need to start with a clean slate.  Learn from the past but not bring it up.  I know I have to heal from his actions on the computer.  Not an easy task but I'm trying.  I'm not ugly...I'm not obese...I'm not a total loser.  I know I'm not these things but why do I feel so insecure around Darren?

       Nope...ain't gonna do it!   After much thinking and advice from friends, I'm not going to get the magazine.  I'm not really going to do much about the porn thing.  He has made his choices.  We will see what happens in counseling next week. Until that time we are moving into a nice townhouse.  One that I can afford if Darren does move out.  I'm thinking that before summer is over, we will not be together.  The porn thing has caused me to lose a lot of respect for him.  He is turned on by pictures but not by me.  I would be ok with it if he would get turned on and then come to bed with me but that doesn't happen.  Like Annette said, I deserve to be with someone who will treat me like a princess.  I deserve better than what I'm getting now.  Darren knows what I want.  He has to make the decision to do the little things that mean everything to me or let the relationship end.  If he does choose the relationship, we have A LOT of work to do to make it stable again.  I mean A hella LOT.  Until that time...I'm living the best I can.  I won't be online until sometime next week.  We are moving this weekend so internet access will be non-existant for me.  Thanks everyone...you are awesome!!!

       Advice   Ok...I'm needing some advice here.  We all know where my relationship with Darren is.  He knows how he has hurt me with his comments about me and my body.  He has not touched me in any kind of intimate way since early January.  He says he has no sexual drive but yet is still receiving Playboy and also looking at porn sites while I'm not home.  I'm seriously considering getting my own subscription to a  urlLink magazine .  Part of it is to read it...LOL  The other part is to see what kind of reaction I will get out of Darren.  I know how insecure he is about his body and man parts.  I'm just wondering that if he sees I'm looking at other men the way I should be looking at him, he will understand how I need him to look at me and want me like he wants the women on the porn sites.  Thoughts on this please...

I look outside and whadda ya know?  Huge and I mean HUGE raindrops falling.  Now this wouldn't be so strange if it was cloudy but I am looking west and the sun is peeking above the hill saying goodnight and I'm seeing blue sky.  Must be a stray storm cloud.  Freaky.

       Clean Sweep...   Wow...would that be a metaphor for my life?  Good grief I need some help!!!    Well...went to counseling today.  Just when I thought that Darren and I were making progress in our relationship, he drops a bomb on me.  Seems that after I told him my feelings on the porn issue, he thinks we have gone one or two steps backwards.  WHAT???  I would think that opening up about something that bothers me would be a good thing, right?  Guess not.  I asked him flat out if he wanted me to express my feelings about things or be a Stepford Wife?  He said that he wants me to express my feelings.  Well goodness...when I do, he cops a nasty attitude and invalidates everything I said.  I just don't get it.  I'm a Stepford wife and that isn't what he wants.  I express how I feel about things that bother me and that isn't what he wants.  WTF???  We are in counseling to discuss things that are bothering us but when I start talking about things that I haven't told him, he says that he has been nothing but lamb basted and attacked.  I just don't get it.  I really don't.  Our appointment was at 9am.  It is now 9pm and he is back to loving on me and giving me kisses and making plans to go see his family and my parents this weekend.  Oy vey!  I'm so confused right now I don't know whether to scratch my watch or wind my butt.

       A Walk to Remember   If you have not seen  urlLink A Walk to Remember  I highly recommend seeing it.  I'm a chick flick junkie and this is a 5 tissue movie.  I wasn't a Mandy Moore fan but she is quite good in this movie and I have listened to her music and I like it.  Does that make me bubble gum?  LOL  My favorite song in the movie is  urlLink Only Hope .  I'm now reading the book and I know darned good and well that it will be better than the movie.  They always are.  Thing I hate is that they stray so much from the book that it's not really true to the story.  But...Nicholas Sparks is awesome anyway.

       A storage unit and junk beyond belief   Well Darren and I did it.  We went to our storage unit and cleaned.  I mean we CLEANED!!!  Got rid of I don't know how many bags of garbage.  Sent quite a bit of stuff to Goodwill also.  Feels good to get rid of crap that has been totally forgotten.  I realized something after the cleaning though...I HAVE TOO MUCH LEGAL PAPERWORK!!!  Good grief.  Now we can work on this house.  The kitchen looks great though.  I did it in a grape/wine theme.  Purples.  It's nice.  Did the 1/2 bath in my old "frou frou" stuff.  It's the girls bathroom and Kyla loves that kind of thing.  Darren hasn't said anything about it yet...I'm waiting though.  LOL  As for me and Darren...things are ok.  They aren't fantastic like when we first got together but then again...does anyone ever have that feeling again after being together for so long?  The honeymoon phase is over and real life has settled in.  I'm not saying that real life is a bad thing but sometimes we take reality for granted and forget that at one point in time the fantasy was what we lived for.  The romance, the butterflies, the giddy feeling of seeing each other again, the stars in our eyes.  That is the tough part to try and keep in a relationship.  We are both trying though.  He isn't talking about "if we stay together" anymore.  Now he talks about our future.  I did say something about getting married today.  Ok...I heard a gasp from Stacey and Annette...I'm not saying we are getting married.  I have a ring that my biological mother gave to me that her husband, my biological father, gave to her.  I found it today while cleaning.  I showed the ring to Darren and said "If we do decide to get married, it would mean the world to me to have this repaired and given to me as an engagement ring".  Darren said "Ok...that is duly noted"   He didn't get pissy about it or anything.  That was all that was said.  I don't know if we will get married.  At this point, we are a long way from that point.  Right now we are living one day at a time.  Basically falling in love again.  I love him...very much.  Our therapist even said that she could tell just from talking to me.  One thing I have found, I'm not depressed anymore.  I'm not hating life like I did a couple of months ago.  I'm thinking that this new place is helping.  I love this apartment.  :)  It's making a difference with Darren too.  He seems happier.  We both are.  Maybe being happier with our surroundings will spill over into our relationship.  Like I said...one day at a time.  That is the best we can do.

While to most you look like the sort of cute animal that itself might get eaten to others you are a voracious predator. You need to munch your way through a few more subjects of the animal kingdom before you can truly call yourself an omnivore.   You have eaten: pig      urlLink Which Cute Animals Have You Eaten?

       Where is a book when you need one?   Instructions: 1. Grab the nearest book. 2. Open the book to page 23. 3. Find the fifth sentence. 4. Post the text of the sentence in your journal along with these instructions.  My answer:  The more Joe insults her and spurn her advances, the more intensely she seems to want and need him.  Good grief it sounds like a smut novel and it's not!!!  LOL  It's "Love Must be Tough"...suggested reading by Danelle.  Love ya babe!

       Hello   Well I am back.  I survived the weekend and believe it or not, it wasn't too bad.  Saturday we went out to dinner with Darren's immediate family for his parents 39th wedding anniversary.  I remained sober thank you very much.  :)  Sunday we went to his uncle's cabin out in the middle of BFE.  Man it was great.  Only an outhouse and a generator for power.  That is what life is all about folks.  Same night went to Darren's friends house.  Had a couple of drinks (still remained sober) but was wiped out by 11pm.  Sunday...more visiting with family.  My parents and his aunt and uncle.  Picked K up at 5:30 from her father (yes, she got hurt again this weekend.  Fell into the campfire.  Burned the heck out of her butt but not too severe.)  Came home last night and died.  I need a weekend to recover from the weekend.  *yawn*  Ok...I'm sure you are wonder just "how well" did Darren and I get along.  Believe me, I didn't know what was going to happen.  I know that I certainly didn't want to spend the weekend with him.  But...me being the nice person that I am, I went anyway.  Hold on to your seats...HE WAS THE DARREN I MET AND FELL IN LOVE WITH!!!  Funny thing is...he didn't realize he was acting that way.  Amazing how that happens when you do things that you "want" to do not forced to do.  He was very attentive and loving to me which in all honesty shocked the hell out of me.  I wasn't sure what to think.  I just enjoyed it.  We had a talk on the way home yesterday and got a lot of stuff out in the open.  He didn't realize that I don't have much of a s*x drive anymore.  I haven't since my hysterectomy in September.  I kinda have one but not like I had before my surgery.  To be upfront about it...s*x scares me.  Terrifies me actually.  He didn't know that at all.  Interesting thing is...he said the same thing for him.  It scares him too.  This is what lack of communication will do to a relationship.  So with that said...we have a counseling appointment tomorrow.  I'm still unsure what is going to happen to us but we are talking and that is a start.  I can't ask for anymore than that.

       Test,test and one more test   I have an "interview" of sorts coming up on June 26th.  It's actually a series of tests before the actual interview.  I will be testing to get on a register for the sheriff's department here.  The position is for a receptionist.  The pay is MUCH better than what I am getting now and bennies are included...at least I am guessing they are.  It's the county so I'm sure that I would get bennies.  Anyway...I'm a tad nervous about it and yet not.  I'm sure of my skills (they want someone who can type 50 WPM...I type 60+) but I hate tests.  With a passion I hate tests.  Doesn't matter what kind of test, I hate it.  So...I'm not a religious person as you all know but I do believe in God...did I hear a gasp?  So with that said...please pray that I get the job.   Silly critter   I'm sitting here watching Raisin run on his wheel.  For those of you who don't know who Raisin is...he is my oldest daughters teddy bear hamster.  Cute little bugger...gray head and hiney and white around the middle.  Heavens but he is a poofy thing!!!  Sweet as all get out though.  I love to watch him clean his face and just in general take his spit bath.  LOL  I know...GET A LIFE TRACEY!!!  But he really is a dolly.  Not mean at all and has never bitten anyone.  He is funny when he runs in his wheel though.  He doesn't just get in it, face forward and run.  No..not Raisin.  He gets in, sticks his little head out to the side and runs.  It's like he is wanting to see where he is going without the wheel hampering his vision.  I'm babbling tonight.  I'm tired and Darren isn't home and the sheets are in the dryer drying.  So here I sit watching a fuzzy rodent and babble on my blog.  Good grief I need a life.  LOL  But...I'm happy right now with my life.  Darren and I are falling in love again, my girls are sleeping angels right now, found a great new daycare for the girls, I'm slowly losing weight, my hair is growing, I live in a nice townhouse and I'm healthy.  Can't ask for more than that.  Well...maybe not being in debt but other than that...I'm happy.  ;)

       Only Hope    So I lay my head back down And I lift my hands and pray to be only yours I pray to be only yours I know now you're my Only hope.  ~ Sung by Mandy Moore  I don't know...it's weird.  My feelings for Darren change everyday.  Could it be that I'm falling in love with him again?  I know that I'm taking things one day at a time but I actually look forward to seeing him after we have been apart during the day.  I look forward to hearing his voice and seeing his face and smile.  He just walked in the door and I'm excited to see him.  I haven't felt that in I don't know how long.  He is beginning to share his music with me and letting me listen to the rough recordings that they have been doing.  He is even asking my opinion about them.  He never used to do that.  He kept everything to himself.  It's nice to be involved in that part of his life.  I bought him a card tonight and he loved it.  He is impressed that someone who we don't know can write a greeting card that expresses exactly what and how we feel.  Then again...it's a Hallmark.  :)

       Lost in a fog...   I'm alive.  Actually I'm existing. I'm going through the motions of being alive but inside I have died.  I feel that my entire core being has just withered away.  I know that I wasn't living for Darren and he wasn't the reason I existed but I love him.  I wish I could say "loved" but I can't.  I'm still very much in love with him.  I went to Yakima this weekend to be with a friend of mine.  She didn't want me sitting at home with Darren.  She said that I needed to get away and try to clear my head.  I'm here and I know that my head isn't as messed up as it was yesterday but I know that once I go back home, I will be back in a swamp of emotions that I don't want to be in.  Before I left yesterday, he told Jordin that mommy and daddy are breaking up.  She ran up to her bedroom and started crying.  She said "I don't want you to go, Daddy".  He said "I don't want to leave either."  Huh?  Did that confuse me more?  You could say that.  He told me that he doesn't want this to end but he doesn't think that he can make a solid committment.  No, that doesn't make sense to me either.  While he was holding Jordin he turned and looked at me and said "This is why I don't want to leave."  That, I believe, is the wrong reason to stay.  He should want to stay because of me not just my girls.  I told him "I come along with her.  It's a package deal."  He said "I know.  Why can't we wait awhile, at least another month and see where this will go?"  I didn't answer.

       ultimatum and a life in the balance   Well I did it.  I gave him an ultimatum tonight.  He needs to either end it now and quit playing me or commit 100% to thinking and having this relationship work.  He said he will think about it while at band practice tonight and also sleep on it.  He said that he didn't realize that he was playing me and that wasn't his intentions.  He also said "I don't want you settling for me when there might be someone out there who is better".  I politely told him to not tell me what he thinks I need.  He can't tell me or know what I feel or need.  Only I know what I need and want.  I told him to not turn this into "I'm doing what is best for you and the girls".  This is not about me and the girls.  This is all about him.  He said that somedays he feels that we are totally right. Then on other days, we are wrong.  Well, welcome to a real relationship Darren.  All relationships are that way.  His mom, who has been married to his dad for 39 years this year, was questioning it last year. She was wondering why she is married to him.  No relationship is perfect.  There are peaks and valleys.  Sometimes you can't stand the person you are married to and sometimes you adore them.  So...now everything is hinging on what he decides.  Honestly, if I could afford it right now, I would leave him or kick him out.  I don't need this kind of stress.  I don't want it.   I'm better than that.  I know I am.  Ya know...I did ask him that when I lose the weight I've gained is he going to think everything of me and say that he is in love with me and wants to spend the rest of his life with me.  He said...after a long pause..."I don't know.  If I do then I'm shallow and a dick aren't I?"  I said "Yep because whether I'm a size 7 or a 10, I'm still Tracey inside.  The woman you fell in love with.  The woman you had no questions about when you told me you loved me the first time."  He then had to tell me "Maybe I fell out of love with the Tracey on the inside also".  Ok...a lightbulb just went off in my head.  An epiphany if you will.  He is shallow and superficial.  Then someone please tell me something.  Why do I love him so much or am I just so comfortable that I'm terrified to be single again?

       No self-respecting person...   Would stay in a situation like I am in.  I feel like a complete and utter fool.  I honestly thought that things were changing.  I truly felt that he was falling in love with me again.  I feel ridiculous.  I'm not saying that he hasn't done some changing, he has.  He is more attentive to me, tells me he loves me (yes, you read that right), kisses me (not passionate ones) and spends time with me.  Sounds like a perfect relationship right?  I know it did to me.  Yesterday was like a kick in the tummy.  All the wind was knocked right out of me.  I agree with you Danelle...where is my dignity?  I wish I knew.  I've been looking at him like a puppy and doing things that I wish I hadn't done like writing him little notes, giving him e-cards and cards, buying him the movie he has been wanting.  All of this and guess what?  Nothing in return for me.  There is your first clue Sherlock!!!  DAMN IT!!!  I cannot believe I let myself believe.  In hindsite, it looks like desperate moves.  It won't happen anymore though.  It's something that I have to break the habit of doing.  I can't do things for him like I have been.  He has noticed how I have been and even he said that I deserve more than what he is giving me.  No shit I do!!!  Then why do I still love him?  Why can't I just get out?  Fear...that is why.

       Raisin   Why can't I be like Raisin or be a hamster?  They don't have to do much but eat, sleep, poop and play on their wheel.  They only have a life span of about 2 and 1/2 years.  Perfect. *wishing I was Raisin right now*   Post Script...   I was wrong...Darren isn't falling in love with me again (found that out today at counseling).Shows what I know..NOTHING!!! I KNOW ABSOLUTELY NOTHING!!! Seems that he still thinks of me as just a friend. Nothing romantic at all.  He doesn't know if he will ever feel that way about me again but doesn't want to break up until he knows for sure.  He says he doesn't want to make a mistake by leaving me and then realizing that I'm who he wants to be with.  Can you all say "Tracey you are unbeliveably stupid for believing that things were changing and that he wanted to be with you in a romantic sense?"  I know I can...been saying it to myself all day today.  How can I be so stupid???? *trying desperately to not start crying*

       Too hot for my taste   Hi there.  I don't know if I'm back or not.  I do know that I'm still alive and surviving.  Barely but I'm here.  Still unsure what is going on.  Actually I know what my gut says I should do.  It's just a matter of time.  I guess you could say that my relationship with Darren is just taking it's final gasps of breath and try to hold onto life.  I asked him tonight why is he still around?  He said "I'm not ready to kick the bucket".  Inside I was saying to myself "But what if I am?"  I'm closing up and I can feel it.  It's almost a physical thing.  It's strange but scares the hell out of me at the same time.  The walls I had before Darren are going back up and I'm shutting down.  I'm becoming what I was right after I discovered what my ex husband did (a story best left alone).  I don't eat much.  I eat just not a lot.  Don't feel up to it.  I don't smile much.  I don't laugh much.  I'm existing.  Just as I did before Darren.  Sometimes I wonder if that is all my life is to be...existing.  I'm scared...truly scared.

For how long, I don't know but I need to disappear for awhile.  Please don't worry about me.  I will be fine and hopefully I will be more myself when I come back.

       Early morning drive and sunflower seeds   I drove home this morning.  I mean THIS morning.  I left my friends house in Yakima at 1:00am.  I got home at 3:00am.  I just wasn't tired and I needed some time to just think.  J. slept most of the way so I had my music on and ate sunflower seeds incase I got tired.  I didn't.  I did a lot of thinking in those 2 hours.  Do you know what I came up with ? Nothing. Nada. Zero. Zilch. Squat.  I don't know anymore after some clear thinking than I did Friday morning when my entire world came crashing down on me.  This would be so much easier on me if he would cheat on me or something like that.    How does a person let go of someone they love so much?  Even though that someone isn't deserving of that love and probably never was?  I have a huge knot in my chest and feel like I just want to curl up, go to sleep and never wake up again.  I've never felt this kind of hurt before.  I've always gotten out of a relationship when the feelings were gone and I was the one doing the leaving.  I've had men break up with me but not when the relationship was as involved as mine is with Darren.  *tired of crying and wanting everything back to what it was*  I don't understand why he is doing this!!!  Someone please help me to understand!!!

       Yesterday, today and tomorrow   I can't help but think that I'm not nuts.  A little cookoo sometimes but not nuts.  Ready for a bit of interesting information?  Men look at me.  I mean it...They really do look at me and *gasp* some of them even flirt.  A man flirted with me today.  It was quite funny to experience actually.  He has only been in the dealership once since I started on May 3.  Today when he came in he looked at me and said "Hey, you colored your hair".  Now how many men actually notice when a woman colors their hair?  Especially one who has only seen said woman once? Not like it was a drastic color change.  Just got rid of my highlights and went back to my natural color all over my head.  Good grief...It took Darren 1/2 a day to notice and say something.  Anyway my point is...it felt great to have someone of the opposite sex pay attention to me.  He even thought I was 34.  I wanted to kiss him for that one...LOL  Granted, it's only 3 years but when you get to be this close to 40, 3 years is a big deal.  Wow...I just made my heart almost stop...almost 40!!!  Good grief that just sounds old...no offense to those of you who are 40.  LOL  As for my outlook on my relationship with Darren...I told him the other night that my walls are back up and I've shut down emotionally.  He gave me an odd look and said that he understood.  He said he wants to try but doesn't want to get my hopes up if it doesn't come back.  How can I get my hopes up when I'm emotionally bankrupt and have no hope anyway?  If anyone needs to get the romantic feeling back it's me.  The point that I'm at right now, I just don't know if that is possible.  Do I really want it to work?  That is the question here.  Now that he does, I don't know if I do.  How's that for turning the tables?

       To the footbridge and back James!!!   Well I started walking tonight.  It was tough at the beginning.  Boy did my calves hurt.  I'm sure they are going to kill me in the morning.  But....I feel really good after doing it.  I went walking with a friend from our bowling team.  She is great to talk to.  It's nice having someone to talk to while doing something so incredibly boring.  The time went by quickly.  I'm thinking that we walked about a mile and 3/4.  We are going to walk again on Wednesday.  I'm thinking that we will do this 2 or 3 times a week.  Will be nice later in the evening like we did tonight.  The place we walked is called  urlLink The Loop .  It's basically a bike path that is on both sides of the Columbia River and crosses on the north end and south end of Wenatchee/East Wenatchee.  It was a gorgeous night so that made my 1st time much easier.  LOL  So with the walking started, Andrea and I should look fabulous by the time bowling starts the end of August.  :)  Men...eat your heart out!!!

       Friends and incentives   I just chatted with a friend of mine online.  He is a wonderful man even though I have never met him face to face.  It's amazing how someone can be such a good and caring friend even though you have never met physically.  Harry and I have been friends since August or September 2001.  I met him on AOL and we have stayed in touch ever since.  Tonight he and I chatted a bit about my relationship with Darren.  That turned to my outlook on myself.  I have issues with my weight.  Since my hysterectomy, I've gained 20 pounds.  I don't like it.  Well tonight my friend Harry pretty much kicked my butt and told me to get rid of the weight if I don't like it.  He said that he will give me an incentive to lose it.  Now the incentive pretty much has me blown away.  Ready for this?  A weekend vacation with me and the girls PLUS for every pound I lose, he will give me $25.  Ok folks now my math truly sucks but that is $500 he is willing to give me just to lose my weight and get my self confidence back.  I don't know about you but that is one hell of an incentive.  I know that you are probably thinking "Tracey, you have never met this man.  Are you nuts?".  Actually...if I had just met him online, sure I would be nuts.  I've known Harry for almost 3 years and even though he has had my phone number and address, he has not once stalked me or given me cause to fear him.  So...starting tomorrow, June 28, I am going to lose 20 pounds and will lose it by September 28.  A reasonable feat and I know that I can do it.  I'm going to start walking tomorrow and do some other exercises to get rid of this crap that is hanging on my body.  No...not for Darren.  This is all about me now.  It's about my self-worth and self-confidence.  It's all about me!

       Dreamless sleep   Well...don't ask how my weekend is going.  If anything can go wrong, it has.  Interview?  Fouled up.  Cleaning the girls room?  Too hot.  Talking to K?  Not a chance (love the stepmonster).  I came home yesterday from the fouled up interview and told Darren I just wanted to fall asleep and never wake up.  He told me that isn't the way to think and I can't do that.  I changed my clothes after that and pretty much did nothing. Oh..I did take a nap.  Woo hoo. He went to a car dealership yesterday.  Came home with a 1997 GMC Yukon.  All that is left is for him to sell his Trendwest and he will be getting his boat.  Know what is funny about all of this?  He keeps saying "his family" when he talks about the rig and boat and how he needs it for us.  Last weekend he didn't want to commit to me and now...well I don't know now.  This morning he kissed me and called me "pumpkin".  WTF?  He has never called me that.  He is being nice to me in a way that men who want to turn someone's head would do.  Kind of.  Am I letting it get to me?  Not really.  Nothing is really getting to me anymore.  I think I used the word earlier...existing.  That is what I'm doing.  Know what is really interesting?  I was the same way with my 1st husband, K's father and my second husband.  I'm seeing a pattern here.  Either a pattern or this is what life is really all about.  Maybe true love doesn't exist and we are just meant to find someone we can get along with.  Live life from day to day and not really have the romance or butterflies.  Don't really expect that anymore anyway.  I sound pathetic.  Well right now...I'm going to be pathetic.  I have that right and it's my perogative.  I am woman without ovaries!!!  I can be cranky.  I can be sad.  I can be pissed. I can be happy. I can be whatever I want to be....correction...I can be whatever the lack of hormones wants me to be.

       Hello   Just a hello and I have not died.  Today was a tough day.  Believe it or not...it wasn't with Darren.  Just the POS job that I have and the boredom that I endure everyday.  Listen up folks...I have read 5...count them FIVE....novels in 3 weeks.  1. The Guardian - Nicholas Sparks 2. The Notebook - N.S. 3. Suzanne's Diary for Nicholas - James Patterson 4. A walk to Remember - Nicholas Sparks 5. You belong to me - Ann Rule  I am currently on my sixth.  This one is another Ann Rule book.  I know what you are thinking and believe me, I have asked for things to do but the *itch of an office manager won't teach me anything.  She is the type where she doesn't want anyone to know the things she knows...apparently thinking it's job security and they won't survive without her.  Wonk wonk wonk. Whatever.  Anyway...today was just the straw that broke the camels back.  I am looking for another job.  I can't deal with this crap anymore.  On an up side...Darren and I are getting along.  Very well actually.  No fights and he was very complimentary all weekend.  No, not getting my hopes up just in case that was being thought.  Just taking life with him one day at a time.  Now to find a good job where I actually WORK!!!!

        When a door closes...       A window opens.  Now that the door that held Darren and I together is closed...I'm waiting for a window to open.  Oh yeah...I'm moving out in less than 4 weeks.  I'm ok though.  It will be strange for awhile but I will get used to it.  Darren wants to try and date once we aren't living together anymore.  I told him that I won't come to Wenatchee to see him.  I will be living in Yakima.  I told him I won't call him.  I won't email either.  Do I think he will try and see me once I have moved out?  No.  I don't.  We talked last night and he knows that I have no love for him and he knows that he is the one who killed it.   What is really sad about this whole thing is that I'm not totally broken up about it.  Does that make me a heartless *itch?

       Yada yada yada   I'm going to be doing some work today.  I'm actually getting paid for it too!  I'm going to be helping a friend clean some apartments.  Ok...not the most glamorous job but it's money.  She and her husband have a cleaning company here in town.  They don't have to ask me to do this but they know I need the money and any kind of job until I can find an office position.  But...if this job works into something that pays really well, I might consider it.  It's part time but full time pay.  Four days on, 3 days off.  That way I can still have my fun on the weekends.  It would also be great for when I start school next year.  See?  I'm thinking ahead.  I was emptying some boxes from the move the other night and found something I wish I hadn't.  I found the wedding band that Darren bought for me.  Still wrapped up and in the envelope the jeweler put it in.  Talk about depressing.  Well...maybe a little.  I'm not focusing on that though.  I have other things that I need to take care of and not worry about something that is most likely never going to be.  I'm going to Yakima on Monday for J's appointment but I've got other things to do besides that.  I'm going to a personnel agency that I used to work for when I lived there.  We are going to update my records there and start looking for a job.  I really don't want to live in Yakima but I'm finding that I may not have much of a choice.  I can't afford to live in Seattle...been there, done that.  We will see what there is in Yakima on Monday.  Who knows...it might be a good move.  *yeah right*

       What to do, what to do...   I am no longer working for the *itch of an office manager.  She didn't tell me why I wasn't going to work there anymore.  She said to figure it out on my own.  I'm going with that it's too slow and they don't need me.  That is a good reason...at least in my book.  Oh wait..that is all I did was read a book!!!  Sheesh.  LOL  As for Darren and I...you tell me and we will both know.  Had a miscommunication tonight and all of a sudden he doesn't know if he wants to stay in the relationship.  WTF???  I don't get that one either.  I told him that relationships are not always smooth and sometimes there are little bumps but he cannot just want to bail when something like that happens.  He said "Why stay in a relationship if you have to work to make it work out?  If two people aren't compatible then why stay?".  Ok, that one boggled my mind.  We have been getting along great for the past few weeks.  One little miscommunication and a little arguement and that is working to keep the relationship going and we aren't compatible?  Another WTF???  So with that said...and I know I have said it before but...I'm looking for work in my hometown of Yakima.  It's almost 2 hours south of here.  I'm beginning to think that I have to be the one to end it just so it will be easy for him to say that he didn't break it off and I'm the one who wanted out.  Whatever...if that is what will make him feel better about himself then fine.  I'm seeing how he isn't capable of being in a relationship.  He has this fantasy in his mind that a relationship should always be happy, smooth and no disagreements.  Again...I said it's a FANTASY.  There is no such thing as a perfect relationship.  If two people were exactly alike, they would kill each other.  So I'm off to find work and figure out what to do now.

       It gets more absurd...     Last night I handed the wedding band that Darren had bought for me to him.  I asked him what he wanted to do with it.  He said "Well, I can't take it back. Why don't you keep it and wear it on another finger?"  WTF???  Is he kidding?  Like I really want to wear a ring that he never intended for me to wear.  I was blown away.  I couldn't even respond to what he said.  Totally unlike me thank you very much.      I've been doing some thinking.  Darren has never given me a solid reason why he doesn't want to be with me.  It's always changed.  The main reason I'm beginning to think is that I have a poor credit rating and I am truly not good at paying bills.  How is that for dumping someone?  Shows me just how shallow and pathetic he really is.  The more I think about it, the more pissed I get at him.  I just want out and not ever have to deal with him again.  He is a worthless man who isn't going take up anymore of my time.  He is the loser in this game.  Not me.  I may not be good at paying bills and my credit history is from a DIVORCE!!!  Not a reason to judge a person.  Let him drown for all I care.  He could drop dead and couldn't careless.

      The following is an email I sent to my friends:      "Hello!!!  Just thought I would give everyone an update as to where my life is right now.  It is starting at the beginning.  Darren and I are no longer together.  Well, we are still living together but that is coming to an end real soon. I'm sure you are asking "What happened???".  Well that is the same question I am asking myself.  I have not one clue.  The only person that can answer that is Darren.  He says that he fell out of love with me sometime in January but I'm leaning more towards September when I had surgery.  I've gotten a few reasons from him as to why but they change quite often.  I'm ok though.  I've been through worse and I will get through this.  I deserve better than what he has to give or can offer.  He knows that he killed everything I felt for him.    So with that said...I'm moving out of Wenatchee.  I will be back in Yakima.  Know what is really sad about the whole thing?  I'm happy to be leaving here.  I'm happy to be getting out of a relationship that was unhealthy and emotionally abusive.  I'm happy to be back with my family and friends.   I don't hate Darren.  I really don't.  I just need someone different than what Darren is and who can offer more than he can.  It's nothing bad about him.  It's just him.  Even he has admitted that he may not be meant to be with anyone.  Who knows."    The support I am receiving from my friends is amazing.  I have the greatest support system that I will be fine through all of this.  Last night I realized that I should have left Darren a month after we moved in together when I asked him  to stop communicating with an ex girlfriend who he was deeply in love with.  I asked him out of respect for me and our relationship to please stop.  He refused.  Instead of going with my gut instinct, I followed my heart.  Look where  I am now with that decision.  Darren has a lot of growing up to do.  He is too self centered and selfish to offer anyone any kind of relationship.  At least one that is healthy.  As my friends have said "You deserve the best and you  will find it!"  They are right.  I do.  I hate to say this but it's out with the bad and off in search of a happy and healthy life.

       Surreal...   It's almost time for me to go to bed.  Part of me does not want to even go to sleep because I know that morning will get here sooner if I do.  I feel like I'm drowning.  That my lungs can't expand and I'm suffocating.  None of this seems real.  It's not.  It can't be.  Darren and I were so happy.  We had such a great relationship.  We were and are compatible.  We have so much in common.  We even resemble each other.  Our lives would not have crossed so many times while we were growing up for us to not be together.  There is a reason we were brought together.   BREAKING UP THIS WAY IS NOT THE REASON!!!   This isn't happening!!!  Please God...wake me up and tell me this isn't real.   please....

       Don't go changin'...   Well ok....I have to change.  My life is going to do a radical change in less than 24 hours.  It is creeping up on me and I'm not sure I ready for it.  It inevitable though.  I cannot change what has begun.  Like a clock ticking...slowly moving it's hands toward the eleventh hour.    I'm frightened.  Completely frightened.  I'm going to be living my life without the man whom I wanted to spend the rest of my life with.  How do I fill the void that will be left?  I don't know.  I'm so angry right now.  Not at Darren.  I'm so angry with God for what is happening.  Not just this situation but others in my past.  I know that He knows I'm angry with him.  He shows me what happiness is and then for some reason, takes it away.  Why?  That is all I want to know. WHY?!?!?!?!?

       Morning and phone calls...     Well this morning we said goodbye to Darren.  He won't be home until Sunday night.  We won't be here Sunday night.  We are moving Sunday during the day.  I won't go into details of how this morning went but I will say it wasn't easy and it was the first time I ever saw Darren cry.  I mean truly cry.  He wasn't crying about me.  It was Jordin.  Jordin kept saying she didn't want to lose him.  Just about tore my heart out.  He is gone now.  I'm a bundle of emotions about that.  Talk about being torn emotionally.    I got a very good phone call today.  I'm not going to go into the specifics about it.  I don't want to jinx what the call was about.  Once I find out more, I will definately say more.  Just pray that the call I got today is a step in the right direction for me.

       Plans and living life...     I have decided on something.  I am going to take the girls to Disneyland next summer. It's going to be the 50th Anniversary so it's a must go kind of trip. Besides, I have the itch to go again. So...now I have something to look forward to and something to save for. So many things to dream and look forward to. So many adventures that I have yet to experience. There is so much life out there and I want to live it. Not exist through it.

       Spinning and spinning...     I'm sitting here and feel like I'm in a dream. A very, very, very bad dream. I know it isn't a dream but sometimes I wish it was. I keep thinking I am going to wake up and this isn't happening. Then reality sets in and I'm glad it's happening. All of the past comes back full force and wakes me up. I still have that little twinge in me that loves Darren. Believe me, it's little and not enough to make me want to stay. I'm at peace when he isn't here. When he comes home from work, the stress and tension sets in. I guess I'm just holding on to the good memories. The ones where we were amazingly happy. I have to hold on to them or else I will end up despising Darren with a passion. I don't want to do that. Tomorrow is the last time I will see him. He won't be here from Thursday - Sunday. I will be moving Sunday. He will come home Sunday evening and I will be gone. No saying of goodbye, no hugs, no nothing. I guess it's better that way, right?

       Thinking and thoughts...     My mind has just been going a million miles a minute.  I will be sitting doing nothing or just driving and things will pop into my head about my relationship with Darren that should have been major red flags.  Lets look at the porn issue shall we?      From the beginning of our relationship, Darren knew about what happened with my ex husband.  How he had done things with porn around my children.  How much I despised it and how it made me sick.  Don't get me wrong, I don't have issues with softcore like "Red Sh*e Diar*es.  I have issues with the up close shots of everything that no one should see but you and your husband/wife.  I have issues with the hardcore crap.  I have issues with it being in the house and knowing my children are on the computer also.  So with that said you would think that he would respect me enough to not look at it or bring Playboy in the house (even though I told him that I don't have a problem with it).  He should have had enough respect for me AND my girls to avoid any kind of porn.  Ding ding ding...apparently he didn't.  He has told me that he only looks at it to see if he has any kind of "stirrings down there".  He says that he has no sex drive so he looks at the pictures/videos online to see if he can get it back.  Ok...don't think that I"m that stupid to think that.  He has said that he only looks at it from time to time and a couple of pictures.  WHATEVER!!!  I know better than that.  I'm not stupid.  He has touched me twice since my hysterectomy...SEPTEMBER 9, 2003!!!  Hello...the last time was mid January.  Think that the porn is factoring in here somewhere?  Yep.  Do I think he has someone on the side?  No.  I don't.  I was  his first girlfriend in over 2 years.  Women just don't find him very attractive.  He is very thin, only 5'9", receding hairline, balding in the back, more flatulance than anyone I have ever met, still breaks out like a teenager, anal as all get out, controlling, never married and no children of his own.  Damn...what was I thinking?  I don't know.  I fell in love with him on first sight.  I didn't see all of the faults.  I saw a man who I thought was wonderful.  A man who I had more in common with than any other man I have been involved with.  A man who at the time was the most considerate and amazingly talented person I had ever had the pleasure to have known.  Where did all of that go?  Where did that Darren go?  Believe me when I say...I wish I knew.    I'm sure more will come up in the coming days about the red flags but I'll stop yakking for now.  Got more packing to do.

       Exactly...     One more week and I will no longer be living with Darren. I'm such a mess of emotions that I don't know which end is up. Right now the only good thing I'm seeing is that I'm losing weight. Stress is an amazing diet. We have been doing a lot of talking. More than we have done in months. I asked him tonight if he has ever had credit problems. He was quiet and then said that he had. When he first moved here, he was making $8.70/hour. He was paying almost $300/month for a car payment, $200 for rent and a little less than $100 for his insurance. He said that he barely had $50/week to live on. Then he said that he had had to use a credit counseling service. Ok...that just about knocked me over. I looked at him and said "Then you should be more forgiving and compassionate as to my situation. You should completely and totally understand the stress I am under and not condemn me for it". Funny thing...he knew he had been busted. He knew that he could not use it as an arguement with me. I feel that I won a small battle. Granted, the war is almost over but a small battle is better than nothing.     We have talked at length about everything. He still doesn't believe that he cheated on me when he had "cybers*x". I believe that he did cheat. I do have to give him credit because he did say that he was wrong in doing it. I think I hit him too close to home before he went to bed though. I told him that I have loved him deeper and more completely than any woman in his life, in which he agreed. That I got too close to breaking through the impenatrable walls that he has put up. I got so close that he pretty much said "Screw this! She is too close so I'm getting the hell out" I told him that he is taking any excuse, no matter what it is, to get out. He didn't disagree with me. I know that there is more to this break up than him being wigged about my financial situation. Something that he won't admit on his own. He said that I am quite possibly correct with what I said and told me that is why we can't live together. He will continue pulling away and hurting me. He knows he is mean to me and hurts me with his actions and words. I don't want to live with him anymore. I can't be with him right now. I don't know if I can ever be with him. A lot of really horrible things have been said...on both sides. I told him that he is too abrasive and he really needs to think before he talks. He may not mean to hurt someone, which that someone is usually me, but he does.     Do I know where I go from here? No. All I do know is that I need to heal. I need to find out where Tracey went. She is in there somewhere. She is just hiding.

       The winds they are a changin'...   So are the clouds...they are forming stormy kind of things.  Anyway...I'm back!!!  Did anyone miss me?  Of course you did.  ;)  The move went well.  As well as could be expected.  Got all of my stuff down here and into a storage unit.  I've already had 2 different job interviews and I haven't even been here a week!  How cool is that?  I'm sure that I will find a job in short order.  Once that is done, mom and dad will most likely be moving by the end of September.  Know what that means?  I'M A HOMEOWNER!!!  Yep...you read that right.  I will be buying their house from them.  It's not much but it would be mine...all mine!  That has got me totally excited.  I have so many plans on what to do with this place.  But the best part of it is...the girls and I will be settled and no moving around anymore.  That is what I'm happy about.  As for Darren...he IM'd me Sunday night.  He was very cold and calloused towards me.  Asked me to mail him the keys even though I said that I would be coming up to finalize some things.  It actually took me by surprise when he said it.  Anyone want to analyze why he said that to me?  I've got such a different perspective on him though now that I'm no longer with him and away from Wenatchee.  He is not the type of man I want to be with.  I don't know who he is but he is not a kind man.  He was when I met him but not now.  He is very cruel and mean.  I saw a picture of him yesterday and....I wasn't even remotely attracted to him.  It makes me wonder what I saw in him at all.  I guess I'm finally closing the door on that part of my life.  It feels good.  I'm finding that I don't think about Darren much.  Very rarely actually.  It's another good feeling.  Like a weight has been lifted from my shoulders and I no longer have to be afraid or walk on eggshells.  Isn't that cool?!?!  I chatted with an old friend today.  It was great talking to him again.  He has been away from  my life for so long that I didn't know if he would talk to me but he did!  It was such a wonderful conversation.  He is what you could call  "The one that got away".  Don't worry...he is in Texas and I'm still here in Washington so I'm not jumping into any relationship.  Just a fantastic friend who I have missed dearly.  When I got engaged to Darren, it was very difficult to tell my friend.  I don't know why but it was.  So with that said...I hope I have eased some of your minds and that you aren't worried about me anymore.  I'm doing well and happy again for the first time since I've met Darren.
