						   I don't really have anything to say right now.  The title of this post doesn't really mean anything.  I'm not actually in a bad mood, but I just felt like putting that, because I thought it would be a cool title.  Sometimes that is the only thing I have to hold on to though.  Ya know when your having a really, really bad day your only hope is that tommorow you can start fresh.  Sometimes for me though I get so bad that the only thing that helps me is to tell myself that life doesn't go on forever and I will die some day.  Don't get me wrong... I'm not suicidal or really depressed or anything.  It's just that when I'm in a really bad mood and having a really bad day it's comforting to think that it won't go on forever.  Well, I hope I didn't scare anybody with this post... that's definitely not what I meant to do.

						   It's amazing how torturous doing dishes is for me.  I don't even know why, but for some reason it is the worst thing I've ever had to do.  I just had to do dishes and I would have rather run I mile (I HATE long distance running).  But oh well- they're done as long as my mom doesn't yell at me for not doing a good enough job...

						   Wow... my second post.  Now I'm at Sofia's house.  She's a good friend of mine in case you didn't know.  I'm going to sleep over at her house tonight.  I got here a little bit ago and we ate dinner.  We had pork chops and rice and asparagus.  Then we had strawberries for dessert.  It was really good.  So now Sofia and I are having a "race" to see who writes the most in a certain amount of time.  We're planning to go for about twenty minutes.  It's not really a competitive race though.  Sofia was just wondering how long it took me to write my last post, because it was so long.  I wasn't sure so I said maybe a half hour and she said it would take her like an hour to write that much.  So this is how were checking to see how accurate I was.  So now I have to think of things to write about for the next twenty minutes... greeeat.  Actually, that's not that hard for me.  I always write a lot or "too much" as some people would say (Lauren-another one of my friends, for example).  On essays or any writing activities in school I also write way more than everybody else and I am usually one of the last people to finish.  I honestly don't mind though.  I think I enjoy writing.  I can go on and on like some people can do talking, even if what I am saying is pretty pointless as it is right now.  My whole blog feels like its going to be really pointless right now, because I don't have anything interesting to write about.  I went to the main page of this site and looked at other people's blogs and they are really interesting... way more interesting than me.  I guess I could try to write about interesting stuff, but I don't think it would work to well.  One thing I am really interested in is politics and I know that interests a lot of people.  So politics... I could go on forever...  So, I live in the US, which means I'm spoiled, uneducated, conservative, and I hate France and think Iraq and pretty much the rest of the world needs our help and our sympathy, right?  Well, no actually.  I'm not the "typical American" if that is the typical American (which I hope it's not, because that would be really sad).  I am a liberal democrat, I hate Bush, I try to keep myself educated about what's going on in the world (but a lot of the time it's just so sad I need to take a break from it), and I don't really think I'm spoiled, though that depends on how you look at it.  I guess all Americans our spoiled to some degree because we take for granted all of the freedom we have and how wealthy our country is compared to other countries,-----(that was twenty minutes) but I think because I am aware and educated about these things I'm not as spoiled as many Americans are.  I also think France seems like a really cool country and I want to go there, though I never have.  I am really into the Tour de France right now and yes I am American in the way that I support Lance Armstrong- six tours... wow, but I won't get into that right now.  I have always been against the war in Iraq and I think Bush is an idiot.  I really want to see Fahrenheit 9/11, but I haven't yet (Sofia, who I was going to go with want without me while I was at volleyball camp... grrr... lol).  Well I'm going to have to go, because I told Sofia I could finish this up in five more minutes and that time is almost up.  I'll have to write more later about this stuff though, because like I said I love writing and politics and I could write about it forever.  I guess I really have my mom to thank for getting me so interested in politics... she is extremely active and involved in like a bizzilion organizations and at the same time she's going to law school.  I gotta go... my time's up.  Bye!

						   Hi everybody.  This is my first post of my first blog so I don't really know what I'm doing and I don't really know what to say.  I could go on writing for awhile though... I write a lot, which you might already know.  I just got home from volleyball camp earlier today.  It was the last day of camp.  I liked the camp a lot, but I'm still really glad it's over.  I hadn't played volleyball for like a month and the camp was Monday through Thursday and on Tuesday and Wednesday it was from nine in the morning to nine at night, while on Monday it was from twelve to nine and Thursday it was only from nine to twelve.  You might be able to imagine though how sore I would be from doing almost nothing for a month and then playing volleyball for three or four days straight.  Pretty much any movement is painful.  Last night I crawled up the stairs because it hurt less and I offered to pay my dad to go get something from down stairs for me.  He tried to do it for free, but he got the wrong thing so my mom did it.  lol.  The worst is siting down and standing up and stairs.  I guess it was worth it though.  The camp was at the U of M.  It was really cool because the vb players and the vb staff from the U of M were the coaches and at the end the signed autographs.  They taught really different tecniques that they apparently got from the national team.  I think I might try their tecniques out, but we'll see.  So now I'm finally home, camp is over and Sofia convinced me to make a blog.  Actually, she didn't really convince me she just said she'd made one and showed me hers and I decided to make one.  I could decide what to do for my username though... I'm not at all creative, so Sofia helped me come up with sunriserezzie.  Rezzie is the name of my cat, but she died a couple years ago.  Now I have a cat named Avril.  I feel really bad for her though, buecause she has ear mites.  She just went to the vet this week for a check up and got treated for the mites, but I think she got them back because she's got the symptoms back.  She shakes her head and there is a rattling sound in her head.  She must be pretty uncomfortable.  I feel sooo bad for her.  I'm going to talk to my mom about it and maybe she'll go back to the vet.  O well.  I better stop writing before this post gets too long.  By the way, I didn't edit this so if something doesn't make sense and there are weird errors that is why.  Bye!
