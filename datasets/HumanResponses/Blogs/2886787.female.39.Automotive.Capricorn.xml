      A year and a half ago I moved to an upper middle class suburb of Detroit. The new neighborhood is transitioning from the elderly original homeowners to younger families and beginning to enjoy a bit of diversity. But, change is difficult.  Only one of our neighbors came to welcome us to the neighborhood and hasn't been back since. It isn't really that odd. It is obvious that we are not The Cleaver's. But, we go out of our way to say "hi" and wave in passing to all the good "normal" folks around us in hopes that eventually they will see that, for all of our differences, we are good neighbors.    Last Halloween, I took my kids’ trick or treating for the first time in our new neighborhood. The old guy across the street was fawning all over the other kids on his doorstep. As we approached his walkway he went inside and closed the door. Tom and Leah didn't realize what had happened, but it made me want to thump the old bastard. I know a little about discrimination, but was appalled when it is directed at my Babies.   We are only living in the area so that we can give the kids the best school district that we can afford. So, we are probably going to be there for another 18 years. (That is when I will retire and get the heck out of Michigan). I guess the neighbors are stuck with us until then.  Early this year a young couple moved in next-door, A Med student in the last year of his residency and his girlfriend from Poland. They are very nice. The neighbors welcomed them by feeding them the first 8 nights they lived in the house. HMMM... Anyway, last weekend they gave a party, filled both sides of the street, and blasted Rap music all night long. I bet the old fogies loved that. We just laughed.

      I love my families dearly, the biological one and the one that I made for myself. There seems to be some difficulty in making the two mesh. It is my fault, of course. How can I expect my biological family (my mothers clan) to love my "Made up" family as much as their own flesh and blood? But, unfortunately, that is what I wish for.   My "made up" family consists of myself, my partner Judy (a person of mixed race heritage, mostly African American) and our two kids (adopted by Judy) Thomas, 5, and Leah, 2. The kids are also of African American heritage. Me, I happen to blonde and blue eyed. My best friend at work says that I expect too much. "Becky, You are a rebel. You have broken all of the rules,” he says. I suppose he is right, but who made the rules?   Being brought up Mormon, GOD made the rules. And the teachings left me damn near suicidal for the first 24 years of my life. I was not worthy because of "my choice to be homosexual". Yeah, some choice. At age 24, I realized that I am just how God made me. (And my idea of God also changed radically, but that is another Blog.)  The Matriarch of the family, Grandma Jackson, is a wonderful person, but highly critical of everything and everyone. She used to not be that way with me, but things have changed and now I am a regular target for her razor sharp tongue. It really puts me on the defensive, the same way it has for my mother and her sisters for decades. Grandma says she accepts me the way that I am. But, she is always looking for a way to cast Judy and her motives in a questionable light. And she really doesn't understand how much I have committed my life to raising the kids and how much joy they have brought me.  I stop in to see Grandma every workday for lunch. I know she won't live forever and I love her. She has been very good to me in the past. I just wish she wouldn't whack me out so much!

      For the first time in my life I have been watching and listening to The Democratic National Convention Coverage. It is more inspiring that I previously would have guessed.   Since we decided to go to war in Iraq, I have been watching, listening and reading about Americas political past and future. I have read several blogs by Iraqis: Salam Pax, Raed Jarrar and Riverbend.   I hate this War. I hate that we can dehumanize our enemy. I hate that we send our young men to die for the interests of the "elite". I hate hearing my coworkers (blue collar, Union, middle class) excuse Bush for making war in hopes that "maybe it will help boost my 401k in the long run". It is just sad.  But, finally paying attention has made me get off my ass and start asking questions... learning... talking to family and friends about what is happening. I am so glad that Michael Moore came out with Fahrenheit 911... Hey, he isn't perfect (none of us are), but it is a wake up call to the powers that be. Don't believe it??? See the movie and then investigate the accusations yourself. I did. It is interesting stuff.  Bill Clinton just gave his speech. For all of his stupid mistakes, that man can speak. (Why do people hate him for lying about a blow job, but will readily forgive the current administration for f-ing up and twisting "Intelligence" and sending 900 + young people to die in Iraq???). Anyway, great speech...I will post it in my next blog.

      It is nice to see that everyday people are starting to pay a little attention to our National Politics... At least one good thing came out of the War / Occupation in Iraq. Everything else has been a disaster in my opinion.   War for Oil. Waged by a country rich in technology... We can do better than this.  Molly Ivins is a writer from Texas... I really enjoy her articles. You can check her out here...   http://www.alternet.org/columnists/1406/

      I am 39 years old and I have lead many different existances in those years. I have been a straight A student, church girl (Mormon),  childhood BMX'er, Basketball playing fanatic, rebellious teenager, a heavy drinker, a closeted Queer, a 20 something druggie in the 1980's Miami (remember Miami Vice?), in the psych ward for evaluation, in jail for stupidity, minimum wage restaurant worker, homeless, a 3.75 GPA college student,  Security guard, a Skilled Tradesperson in Engineering for an American auto manufacturer, computer addicted, A UAW (United Auto Workers Union) member, Openly Lesbian, partner to Judy, foster parent, an adoptive parent to 2 beautiful African American kids, political junkie, and a person that wants to make a positive difference in our world.   I have been or done all of these thing (pretty much in the listed order) in my 39 years. It seems the only thing that remains constant is change.
