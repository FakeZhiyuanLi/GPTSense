           Sometimes I think about it and I ask myself many questions about college. Questions like how I will get to pay for a college, or how college will be. But the most important question for me right now is Will College really make me successful? This question is very important for me because I don't know if college will really make me successful. I ask myself this because if it really doesn't make me successful, then what’s the point of going to college. That’s why I needed to make some research to see if college will be success for me in life. A good website that I went to was   urlLink www.successincollege.com .                             During the research I found out that college is a very important goal in life. The reason of going to college is to get a career and to become someone in life. It is a time in life when you can accomplish things you will never be able to do later on. Dreams and goals that you want to accomplish will be done by going to college. Success in college depends upon academic values and characteristics. Going to college is like nothing students have never experienced in their academic lives. The goal of college success is to offer programs, books and to ensure students that they can really succeed in life by going to college.          I know that college will make me successful in life. And by doing this, I have to help myself too. Not only will the teachers help me. As time goes by I will have to make my own decisions .I will have to realize the I’m not a little girl any more and that my parents aren’t always going to be their for me. That’s why there are many things to think about as I keep growing up. Things like getting a part time job and choosing the kind of career I want. It’s going to be hard doing all this but I'm going to be able to over take it. Sometimes I'll get the help of my family but sometimes I won’t. Theirs just stuff that the family won’t be able to help you. In this BLAST program I have learned many things about college. At first I wasn't sure if I wanted to go to college. But this program made me realize that College is very important and that it will help you become successful in life. College is the key to success; it will make life easier for you. During the BLAST program we did many fun activities. In writing class we got to take pictures and also got to write about them. In poetry class we were able to do a lot of poems about our lives and about the city. One of my favorite poems that I wrote was: So much depends upon a person having the ability to success, by using the tip of their head, while others instead wanting the street and looking as thief’s. This poem is talking about success. It means that some people just concentrate in succeeding in life while others just want the money to come to them. Doing this is not a good thing. Every single person in this world should do something and become somebody in life. In math class we worked in groups to solve math problems. In science we learned about the periodic table and also we did different kinds of experiments. In Spanish class we played the loteria game and also we had to draw some pictures on the board and others had to guess what the picture was. In computers we got to do our own e-mail address and we got to write about our advantages and disadvantages. We also got to write about our personal statement. This means that we had to act like we were going to graduate from high school and we had to write a letter saying that we really want to go to college. In advisory we were able to play games and also got to know new ones. Advisory was kind of fun for me. I think this BLAST program was a good activity for me during the summer. I really don’t regret for coming here. It was a great experience meeting new people and making new friends. I think this program helped me think about college and about what kind of career I should choose. All the teachers and tutors were great. They really helped a lot. I would really love to come back here next year. Now I know that college is the key to success and by that you will accomplish your dreams and goals.

          This is a picture of group A&nbsp; in math class. These students are paying very close attention to what the teacher is saying. They are learning and reviewing &nbsp;math problems. It seems like these students are really concentrating on what the teacher is saying. In this picture you see that the students are working in groups. Others are&nbsp; still trying to get the problem.&nbsp; If&nbsp; its diffiult for them, the tutors are there to help them. I think this is a picture of success because&nbsp; you can see that the students are looking strait on what they're focused on. I took this picture because at that moment everyone seemed&nbsp; very interested on the math problem. Looking at this picture and seeing how these students work together as a team will bring them up to the top and get to a way higher level. By keeping it up they will experience new things in life and they will also be able to get into a good college.

         In this blast program i have learned many intersesting things.Stuff that i have learned in science are how to measure.By doing this we used a straw&nbsp; and gum to&nbsp; cover it up. In math&nbsp; every week we get in groups of three and start working in different kinds of problems.Its really fun working like that.In poetry we have written poems about lives and after that we are able to share it by reading&nbsp;them out loud.In writing we have talked about college and we have written questions of our own to see how college would be when we get to it. Right now we are supposed to write an essay about the questions that we have done. Our group name is&nbsp;THE FUNNY GURLS&nbsp;and our group question is&nbsp;Will College Be Part Of Our Future? My own question was Will College&nbsp;really&nbsp;make me successful?&nbsp;For me i think college is really important.College&nbsp;will lead you the way to success.I think that it will be part of our future.This can happen if you try your best on everything and if you really want it to make it happen.Nothing will work by itself.You got to&nbsp;make it happen.The only thing u got to do&nbsp;is to never give up.&nbsp;&nbsp;We also have spanish class.On the&nbsp; first class we just played a game called loteria meaning bingo. The fieldtrips had been fun too. Our first fieldtrip was at Washington Park it was kind of fun because we got into groups and started doing activities on how real life experiences are. So we had to help each other and work together as a team.On the second trip we went to lincoln park zoo. We diferentt kinds of animals. We also took pictures of success. Taking the pictures was an assignment of writing class.    From the blast program teachers all i got to say is they are all great. They help us on what we need. I have never experiend a Program like this before.

              Success to me is reaching my goals and getting to where I want to be. I can achieve success by going to school everyday and by never giving up on what im doing. Successing in life will help me be more mature and at the same time i will get the opportunity to have a career. Being succesful in life will be one of my greatest goals in life.

I am writing to you para decirles que life is great hear in cali. Your grandchildren keep asking about you. They can't wait to see you. Being a nurse is kind of difficult for me. Whenever I see those children sick, my heart just breaks apart. Sometimes I think about it and I ask myself what if my children were as sick as these innocent little kids? I am not trying to think about this anymore. So wat I'm going to do is take some time off and go to mexico for the summer. I'll be waiting here for you with opened hands. Hope to see you soon.                                           Love,                                                Nancy
