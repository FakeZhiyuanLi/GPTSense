      This is my reply to  urlLink this post .   1.  Tori Amos - Girl  - This song has been "my song" for about 10 years. There's been times when I've thought that I'd grown out of it, grown up, become stronger than that. But I always go back to it. I'm always in there somewhere.  She's been everybody else's girl/Maybe someday she'll be her own.   2.  Aimee Mann - Save Me  - I've been feeling this song a lot lately. Not because there's anyone in particular whom I think fits the song for me. But because I wish there was.  You look like a perfect fit/For a girl in need of a tourniquet .  3.  Alanis Morissette - Mary Jane  -  I hear you're losing weight again Mary Jane/Do you ever wonder who you're losing it for . I've never tried to lose weight - quite the opposite. But one of my sub-conscious reactions to major emotional stress is the inability to eat. And this song reminds me of those times.  4.  Dave Matthews Band  - The way things could be, or should be, even.  you came to me like wine comes to this mouth/Grown tired of water all the time/You quench my heart and you quench my mind .  5.  R.E.M. - Walk Unafraid  - We all know I am the queen of clumsy. But it's not just a physical thing... I feel clumsy emotional and other ways as well. This song has been a strengthening song for me. A mantra of sorts. Cheering myself on to be my own person.  but somewhere there I/lost my way/everyone walks the same/expecting me to step/the narrow path they've laid .  6.  Edie Brickell - Stwisted  - I guess this one barely needs an explanation.  But I keep holding on for a future/I keep looking for something that I'll never see .  7.  Depeche Mode - Just Can't Get Enough  - This reminds me of late 1999, when Scott and I were first dating.  We slip and slide as we fall in love/And I just can't seem to get enough   8.  Heather Nova - London Rain  - This goes along with the Depeche Mode song, and the way it used to feel with Scott.  and when i'm home curled in your arms and i'm safe again/i'll close my eyes and sleep to the sound of london rain .  9.  Duncan Sheik - In the Absence of Sun  - This was on a mix tape that Jenni LaVasseur made for me in 1998. And I listened to it in my car a lot. This song became important to me when Ron and I broke up. It described so much of what I was feeling. And now it's the other way around - now, I think this may be a lot of what Scott is thinking.  I don't want to feel this way/I don't want to say I'm just a friend/I don't want to wait around here/'Cause you don't want to feel no pain again/We just lie about it/As we become shadows of ourselves .  10.  Ebba Forsberg - Lost Count  - I saw this video on tv once a long, long time ago, and loved the song. Then I prompty forgot about it. Years later, I remembered it, and downloaded it. And the whole song.... I just love it. I can't pick out just a few lyrics, so.......  Been walked Out upon And been the one Walking Out On the ones I love Made my Life a mess I can't put the blame on no one but myself Lost hope and I Lost faith So many times I lost count Been stumbling Grouping Caught But found a way Out of Each And every trap Somehow And so far Made my Life a mess I can't put the blame on anyone but myself Lost hope and I Lost faith So many times I lost count I lost count... Ooh... Ooh... Ooh... Ooh... Lost hope and I Lost faith So many time I lost count Been walked Out upon And been the one Walking Out  11.  Jimi Hendrix - Little Wing  - I love it when  urlLink Pete  plays this song. It's such a beautiful song, and it always makes me think happy thoughts. And I think it's the perfect biographical song about Delirium. If I ever get my Delirium tattoo, some part of the lyrics of this song will be in it.  Well she's walking/through the clouds/with a circus mind/that's running 'round/Butterflies and zebras/and moonbeams and fairy tales/That's all she ever thinks about/Riding with the wind.   12.  Johnny Horton - The Battle of New Orleans  - My daddy used to sing this song, or we sang it together, when I was little. So it always reminds me of the happiest parts of my childhood.  In 1814, we took a little trip/along with Colonel Jackson/Down the Mighty Mississip/We took a little bacon and we took a little beans/and we caught the bloody British in the town of New Orleans.   13.  Patti Smith - Kimberly  - High school, sitting out in the grass/dandelions with my group of friends at lunch, or a free period, or skipping class.  Little sister, the sky is falling, I don't mind, I don't mind/Little sister, the fates are calling on you.   14.  Jimmy Eat World - The Middle  - Another song I use to reassure myself.  It just takes some time/Little girl you're in the middle/Of the ride/Everything, Everything will be just fine./Everything, Everything will be all right, all right   15.  The Ramones - We're a Happy Family  - I'm happy to say that my real family has nothing in common with this song. But I love it. I love the expression on my brother's face when he was singing along with it, the first time I ever heard it.  Daddy likes MEN!   16.  The Rolling Stones - She's a Rainbow  - Just such a happy-go-lucky song. It's light and sweet and has a playful piano melody that I adore.  Have you seen her dressed in blue/See the sky in front of you/And her face is like a sail/Speck of white so fair and pale/Have you seen a lady fairer?   17.  Sarah McLachlan - Elsewhere  - This song made me break down and cry so many times at that point in my life when I was trying to hard to do what was right, and I wanted my mom to support my decisions, even though they were against her core beliefs. Anyway...  Mother can't you see I've got/to live my life the way I feel is right for me/might not be right for you but it's right for me...   18.  Supertramp - The Logical Song  - My brother put this song on the very first mix tape he ever made for me - when I was in the 6th grade. That's the tape I've always thought of as my lifeboat, which saved me from a life of nothing but bubblegum pop music. Anyway, this is one of the songs that confirmed for everyone that I was, in fact, a freak. Mainly because no other 12 year-olds I knew had ever heard of Supertramp. And these days I relate to it a lot.  Now watch what you say or they'll be calling you a radical/liberal, fanatical, criminal/Won't you sign up your name, we'd like to feel you're/acceptable, respectable, presentable, a vegetable!   19.  Talking Heads - And She Was  - Another song that reminds me of high school in the field behind school. I remember David Byrne describing the woman who inspired the song as being a "tripped-out hippy chick," and at that point in time in high school, that's what I wanted to be. Heh.  And she was looking at herself/And things were looking like a movie/She had a pleasant elevation/She's moving out in all directions .  20.  Ween - Piss Up a Rope  - I get such a kick out of this song. It's so vulgar, and just so wrong, but I love it.  and you can put on your shoes/hit the road get truckin'/pack your bag/i don't need the ag/on your knees you big, booty bitch start suckin' .

      Because you can never have too many blogs, yeah?  I doubt I'll switch over completely, seeing as how there's 5 years of history in  urlLink my livejournal . Who knows? Just trying something new.  More later.

      There's something truly uncomfortable about saying something you know isn't true, when you don't mean to lie, but you can't seem to avoid it. That's been happening a lot lately, and each time I feel like I'm shooting myself in the foot. And sometimes it even seems like the shot in the foot is better described as a shot in the heart. Why oh why can't I do what needs to be done? Before my excuse was not knowing what I wanted. And I guess I still don't really know what I do want, but I know what I don't. Yet I'm still making decisions based on how they will affect someone else, putting someone else in a higher position of importance than me. I know it's wrong, I do.  Maybe it will happen before I expect it to, and for reasons other than those of my choosing - like what happened recently with a friend of mine. I'd prefer to be strong about it though, and not wait for some outside catalyst to make me take action. I've grown in so many ways, and become so many things I never even knew I wasn't. So why is it that I seem to keep avoiding the necessary next step?  It's his eyes, I think, his face. I can't look into his eyes and say "I love you but I don't want to be with you any more." I don't want to see how much that will hurt him, and I know that it will. I don't want to hear the words he will say, the pleading, the crying. I don't want to be the bad guy.  So for now, I just stay miles from nowhere, until I can gather up the moxie to care for myself more than anyone else.

      Just a few verses from Suzanne Vega that have been meandering about my head... I made a mix CD of her songs yesterday, and after work I went for a drive, so I could listen to it. I'd been playing it all day in my office, but I couldn't focus on it, so I went for a drive on the country roads outside of Rockford. Then treated myself to dinner at Dom's. Was a pretty good evening, really.  From (I'll Never Be Your) Maggie May:   And so a woman leaves a man   and so a world turns on it's end   so I'll see your face in dreams   where nothing's what it seems   you still appear some kind of friend   From Soap and Water:   Soap and water   take the day from my hand   scrub the salt from my stinging skin   slip me loose of this wedding band   and   Soap and water   wash the year from my life   straighten all that we trampled and tore   heal the cut we call husband and wife

      It's too soon. I'm not even divorced yet. But, my relationship is over, and has been for some time. What am I talking about, you say? I'm talking about the doom and gloom I've already begun to feel. Because now that I am truly alone, I'm being slowly overtaken by a dreaded sense that I will never find another Somebody. I'm not looking to rush out and become half of a pair of people again - I'm fine with my individuality, in fact I love it. But there sure are a lot of things that are fun to share with someone. And while I relish my freedom right now, and even feel as though I'd never want anything else, I still look at the possibility of becoming a spinster, a lady with a shitload of cats, and not much else.  Where do you meet people? How do you meet them? How does all of this stuff get started? I've had 3 real romantic relationships in my life. The first was Darius, whom I met in high school. The second was Ron, whom I met in two ways: the first time I saw him in person was at a party at Nate's house, but I think I had "spoken" to him before in teleconference on the "R" World BBS, back in the day. I met Scott at Gray's, when we both worked there. So my options for meeting people (historically-based) are school (which I'm still planning on doing, but I haven't actually taken the steps necessary to make it a reality), online (which is so much different than it was in 1997), and work (where there are 8 men: 5 of them are married, 2 of them are gay, and 1 of them is just not my type). I don't want to meet people in bars. I know that not everyone in any given bar is an alcholic, but given my experiences in my most recent failed relationship, I think I'd like to avoid anyone who makes a habit of going to the bar a lot. Where else?  And then there's the next step. After I figure out where, and then who, how am I going to get along with them? I like to think I have learned a lot of things from my previous relationships, but I feel rather neurotic about some of the things I've learned. And I don't want to be the untrusting girl. I don't want to be the girl that accuses and expects the worse of her partner. I don't want to be the girl who gets pissed when her partner wants to hang out with another friend, who happens to be a girl.  But maybe that's who I am. Reading  urlLink E 's blog, I found myself thinking,  how can she deal with that?  because her significant other is spending the next few days with an out-of-town friend who happens to be a girl. I felt jealous for her.  And none of this matters right now. I don't plan on trying to find a new Someone right now anyway. I expect that in all likelihood, it'll show up when I least expect it, out of the blue. And hopefully by then, I will be ready.
