      I have a feeling this is gonna b quite a long post. yesterday I got up at 8.45 mucho excited coz of shopping! wanted 2 have a shower but there was a long queue (my whole family wanted a shower n we can only use the downstairs 1 at the mo coz the upstairs 1 is bein re-done. typical) so I had sum nice peanut butter sandwiches 4 my brekkie. had a shower n got ready had 2 leave without doin my make-up (agh!) coz we had 2 get 2 da train station by 8.50. picked up kinkz on da way. got 2 the station n evry1 was alredi there (hollie had got there 1st 4 once lol). steph & sum1 else had found £20 on the floor (wow!) so said they’d treat us 2 lunch. got on the train (my family were tagging along coz my mum & bro wanted 2 go 2 the sealife centre lol) and immediately started eating da muffins (my mum’s famous home-made muffins that evry1 loves!) listened 2 steph’s amazing compilation cd with such greats as Jackson 5, the who, fool proof (my faves yay!), the early november, etc. played with hollies fone (the incredibly intelligent interesting innovative and ixciting brick) and chattered. sam was sitting on the armrest of the seat and wasn’t even in the way of the walkway bit, but this old woman was coming past and said “can u move please” in a really bitchy rude way, n Katie had her feet on the seat and da old man goes 2 her “get ur feet off the seat, theyr 4 people 2 sit on not 4 putting feet on” twas quite funny. got 2 birmingham n went straight in2 da weird looking shopping centre. bloody hell it was eeeenorrrrmous!!!! needless 2 say we started shopping straight away & within about 15mins id bought my new top (the “treasure chest” 1) & a triangle (part of hollie’s bday pressie. and yes, she does already know so that’s y ive sed wat it is). ah we went in2 just about every shop there it was great! the topshop there is HUUUUUGE!!! its got a few floors n its got a café as well! soon we got hungry so we went 2 selfridges foodhall which was incredible! with the £20 that steph found we bought tons of food – baguettes, cookies, donuts (they had a whole tray of about 25 double chocolate donuts wich r my faves! ive never seen so many all 2gether at one time! at skool theres usually only 2 left lol), choc brownies, muffins, cheeseypuff pastry things,  n shared it all! ah twas so gd. then we all split up n went shopping. me hollz n Katie went back 2 selfridges and I actually LOVE that place. there was a bit called Suck UK n it da coolest lil things eva me n hollie were lyk “WOW!!!” – ther was a punk rubber duck that she wanted 2 get me 4 my bday bt there wernt any left. n ther was this inflatable room! me n hollz r gna buy it wen we all move in2 our flat in LA. then we went up 2 the top floor where all the perfume & make-up was & got billions of leaflets 4 our graphics c/w dat weer about 2 do. at the Stila make-up counter I asked if u hav 2 pay 2 hav a makeover done n da woman sed £10 if its 4 a special occasion bt I can give a free make-up lesson thing. so I asked 4 that with sorta green eye makeup n she did it n I loved it! then she did the rest of my face as well! twas gr8 havin my makeup done professionally – I could quite happily have it done everyday! then we went down 1 floor 2 look at some clothes n they wer sooo amazing but they were all “versace” & “wheels & doll baby” so just a tad on the expensive side. so we went down 2 the next floor and it had sum pretty cool stuff – I wanted 2 buy the whole of the Emily Strange section. I was just looking at a gift bag with the playboy bunny on it and saying 2 hollz mclollz how much I liked it when kate and steph appeared & kate sed that she’d got me playboy bunny wrapping paper! (im gonna b a playmate u c). they sed that we had 2 go meet up with the others but me n hollie were having waay 2 much fun looking round Selfridges so katie steph n kate went. we carried on looking round and I kept saying “I want this!” n “I want that!” I felt like a spoilt child lol. they had loadsa jars of marshmallow spread stuff n hollie wanted sum so I bought her sum 4 her bday. they also had liquid chocolate but I resisted the temptation of buying any. found lornie, sam & katie, went to more shops. then we went 2 debenhams 2 c how many free samples of makeup n leaflets n stuff we could each get and hollie got the most. we had 2 do it reeeeeally fast coz we had a couple of minutes til we had 2 b at the train station again. went as fast as we could with all our shopping, down 3 escalators jam-packed with people, ran the length of the whole shopping centre and across the road 2 the station. steph, kate & my family were already there. dad had taken my fone 2 a shop 2 c if they could fix it but they sed ive gotta send it away 2 get it fixed! noooo! so I wont have my fone 4 aaaages! got on the train and it was v busy so we wernt all sittin 2getha. me n hollz sat 2getha and I was buried under all my shopping. I realised that id only bought myself 1 thing! the rest of the stuff in all the bags was my brothers bday pressies, hollie’s bday pressies, vickie’s leaving pressies, drinks, food & leaflets. n id only spent £30! wich I tink is preti gud. then a man got off the train so steph n kinkz came n sat with us. me n steph were wondering, do left-handed drummers have their kits the other way round? if u kno the answer, send it 2 us at the following address…actuli just post a comment on here. cheerz. got back 2 wycombe n me hollie n kinkz went back 2 hollies house. compared our purchases n free samples n then hollies parents went out. jo arrived wearing her Von Dutch top that I want n we told her about our day n she told us about hers n she sed that Johnny de cruz wanted 2 come round & we ummmed n aaaahed about whether 2 let him come. had sum food then lorna arrived n showed us her amazing Pharrell display – tis a photo frame with the pictures & autograph from when she n sam met him and it sez “the day I met pharrell” on it. they decided jdc could come n then evry1 ran around going “aaagh wheres the makeup?! wheres the sraighteners?!” then they went 2 wait at the bottom of the road for him but me n hollz mclollz stayed in the house. I sed 2 her “I kno – lets tip water on him outta da  window!” n we both went “YEAH!!!” and we rubbed our hands 2getha with glee. the water kinda missed him but the car got a good wash instead. lorna n jo got a bit annoyed n wer lyk “wtf dya think ur doin?” n went 2 watch big brother with Johnny. me n hollie decided 2 have a party upstairs instead, went on msn and turned up our incredibly cheesey music reli loud 2 annoy the others (lornie & jo had switchd in2 “oo thers a boy, lets be quiet & boring” mode) and danced. we listened 2 classic power ballads from celine dion, crazy rap music, mandy moore, Disney classics like the bear necessities, cinderelly cinderelly, the Siamese cat song (by hilary & haylie duff lmao!), and songs frm shrek!! twas fab! then we did sum mountain climbing on the stairs and kate joined us & it was gr8 fun. carried on listening 2 cheese & sent the Siamese cat song 2 sum people who were on msn. we definitely had more fun than “the people downstairs” (Lorna Jo n johnny). then my daddy came 2 take me n kinkz home so we sed bibi n went. came home n watched da end of da Holland Sweden match n went 2 bed, exhausted after a day of shopping!

      Saturday: woke up & discovered that what I had thought was a bit of hayfever had turned in2 a bad cold :( got up n had a nice bit of breakfast (half a baguette), had a shower n did my violin practice. kate arrived n she’d brought her straighteners with her coz she thort id like 2 use them (thankies!) so I dried my hair n she straightened it. we got ready n then headed up 2 naphill fete 4 a bit tho we were a bit later than we planned coz we spent so long getting ready! met up with luke 4 a bit then my dad picked me n kate up (we’d only been at the fete 4 about 10 or 15mins!) coz we were goin 2 brighton 2 do a spot of shopping yay! twas nice and sunny and we had avril playing reli loud in the car with the windows down so evry1 else could enjoy it 2!! then we listened 2 kates “sk8er rock” cd featuring such classic “sk8er” tunes from the likes of papa roach, sum 41, wheatus, blink 182, nickelback etc. we were saying how all the songs reminded us of that time when evry1 was goin thru that grungey stage (even lorna wore a limp bizkit hoodie and a tshirt with safety pins n fishnet on it! shock horror!). we talked about all sorts of interesting things like how amazing aeroplanes are (theyr about as heavy as a herd of elephants yet they still manage 2 fly up there – how does that figure?!). got 2 brighton n theres loadsa cool little shops but we were both bursting 4 a wee so we headed 2 the normal “every town has one” kinda shops n found a burger king with toilets (they had UV lights in the toilets so ur toilet paper glowed!!). went 2 grab sum lunch at about 3.30 then we spotted an H&M so we went in there. kate found this really cute skirt 4 me then decided she liked it as well so we both tried it on along with loads of other stuff. then we both decided 2 buy the same skirt & I bought a top as well. went round lots of other shops and found a Pilot where kate immediately spotted THE perfect top 4 me – it said “Treasure Chest” on it!! but they didn’t have my size so im gonna buy it when we all go shopping in Birmingham nxt wkend 4 my birthday! went round more shops and then found Millie’s Cookies so we just had 2 go there. then we walked along the beach on the way 2 meet my dad and kate found a nice shell and I bought a bracelet that’s like a plug chain 4 a quid. everything went all dark coz there were big black clouds overhead & it was getting quite windy & the sea was getting quite choppy and I overheard someone say “theres a big storm brewing”. found my dad and as we were walking to the car some big drops of rain started to fall and then it started pouring with rain and there was thunder (or was it my tummy rumbling…) and lightning and we got soaked so had 2 hide in the doorway of some shop or other. it was raining about three times as heavily as that time on the rye the other week!! then the rain slowed down so we walked 2 the car and found loads n loads n loads of fabilicious little shops that we’d sumhow missed so we decided we r definitely gonna go back sumtime. got 2 the car completely soaked (id stumbled in2 several deep puddles on the way) so I put my new skirt on. started driving home then we went 2 little chef 4 our dinner. listened 2 more avril in the car n then realised how xcited we are about goin 2 c her (& evan *drool*!) in October even tho its 4 months away!! decided we r both gonna wear our new skirts. dropped kate off at her house, went home, went 2 bed.

      Hmm well this 1 shud b interesting! where 2 start – where I left off might b sensible I guess, so that means yesterday.  Spent the day on the computer n me & tom wer sortin out transport arrangements for Taking Back Sunday (nxt week yay!!!). then I realised that it was 4pm n id 4gotten 2 hav any lunch so I had an apple. watched “Pimp My Ride” – class mtv show wher they take sum1s bashed up old car n make it fabilicious & beautiful tis amazing. then off I went 2 wrap up joey’s pressies n get ready – ooo excitamondo! collected McLollz, Longlegz n Kinkz n went 2 jo’s, late as usual even tho it turned out we wer the first ppl there. evry1 arrived, jo unwrapped her pressies, yada yada yada. then we walked 2 the curry place up the road, all tottering in our heels n wearin teeny weeny skirts or tight trousers. we only got a disappointing 7 hoots from passing cars tho. walked in2 the curry place (ouch) n nearly choked on the smell of spices. nehu we sat down n the Indian waiter dude askd us how many poppadums we wanted n we had to try soo hard not 2 laugh at the way he sed “poppadums” in his Indian accent! then I started singing the posh poppadum song from that advert with tara palmer-thompkinson in but nobody knew what I was on about n I had 2 shut up. yeh so we ordered our food n then kinkz spent the whole time worryin whether we had enuf money n tryin 2 work it out on her fone! ate curries, then me n Sammie wanted 2 go on an adventure thru hazlemere but the others dragged us back 2 jo’s. as soon as we got back we cracked open the booze n put on sum loud music (nsync) woooo yeah partay! lots of fotos taken, lots n lots of alcohol drunk. sum1 had a bit 2 much. that was me. I txtd sum ppl, I hav no idea wat I sent 2 any1, so im sorry if it was u! went 2 the loo n puked – all that curry came back up, niiiice 1 neetee. the whole bathroom was spinning around so I sat down in the shower. yep that’s rite, the shower. the others realised I was missing n found me, amazingly I managed 2 get down the stairs in my 4inch heels without falling. I then collapsed on the kitchen floor, the gals lifted me on2 a sofa n then I started spewing again. bowl was fetched n I carried on spewing. I now owe jo’s mum a new washing-up bowl. thank u girlies 4 lookin afta me n keeping ma hair outta the way n cleanin me up *big hug*. fell in2 a deep sleep n only woke up 2 puke agen. woke up at 6am then put ma pjs on at 7am. then kinkz woke up n we had a nice lil chat n went in2 the kitchen 2 listen 2 avril. apparently theyd watchd the omen while I was asleep. others woke up and kinkz was telling us about the Primeval Soup and began reading the bible to us. had croissants 4 brekkie n evry1 reached 4 the coffee n paracetamol. not much else happened but we worked out that id drunk 3 or 4 bottles of Bud, 2 smirnoffs, a pimms with orange juice, wine + the rest of everyone elses drinks. not much else happened. came home. wrote this. goin 2 c my grandparents later woopdeedoo jolly hockeysticks. til next time, taraa!

Now tis wednesday n joey's birthday!!! happy birthday gorgeous!  2nyt we r goin 2 her house then goin 4 a curry n then gettin pissed at her house n watchin "scary" flicks n sleepin ova so dat shud b mucho fun! bibi mi chickens, rock on Neetee xxx
