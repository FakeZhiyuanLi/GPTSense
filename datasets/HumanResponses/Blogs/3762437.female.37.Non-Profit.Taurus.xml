      Texans are proud by nature. Perhaps because our state is the 2nd largest in the union? Although, come to think of it, I've never heard an Alaskan resident brag about their state being the largest? Have you?   I am 6th generation born Texan - proudly sporting a tattoo on the inside of my left ankle of the outline of Texas. The daughter of a bricklayer and an office manager. I had (HAD) 1 younger sister and 2 younger brothers and a half older brother that never lived with us. Which is a Jerry Springer episode in itself!  I look back at my childhood and realize I had a pretty crummy life growing up. After one of my little brothers drowned in my grandmother's swimming pool my mother left this planet and existed soley on a planet all her own. (Not saying that if something ever happened to one of my children I wouldn't do the same but at least I would know to get professional help.)I was left to fend for me and my two younger siblings even to the point that when I was in 3rd grade it was my responsiblity to get my younger sister up and dressed and escort her to and from school every day - mind you we lived in Houston, Texas... not the safest place on Earth. The last day of 4th grade my parents moved us to the TINEST town on the USA called Lingleville - there were 6 kids in my class and it included 5th & 6th grade!! After living in Houston this was a major culture shock. In the middle of 5th grade my parents then moved us to a slighty bigger town called Dublin.   At this point this was the 6th school I had attended and didn't think we would stay for very long. Life in construction was rough and you had to be were the work was. But to my suprise we hung out there until the summer between my junior and senior year when they decided to move back to Houston! Can you think of a more horrifying thing to do to a kid then move them before their senior year after going to one school for such a long time. I was definitely not the 'cheerleader dating the football captain' but I had good friends was first chair clarinet in the band and was having a good time.   Once I moved to Houston I was nothing. I can remember maybe 2 people that I half-assed made friends with while I was there. The "A" band was full and I ended up in the "C" band which was humiliating so I just gave up playing and took an elective instead. But like all things that happen in your life something good always comes out of these kinds of experiences and after my family moved back to Dublin after I graduated I realized that I was not small town material and couldnt wait to get back to a "normal place" to live. As soon as I could I moved up to Fort Worth and began working at the first of several non-profit companies that I have worked for.
