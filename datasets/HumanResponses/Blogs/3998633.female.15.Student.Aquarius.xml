      Not for long, I know that for a fact.&nbsp; Well the past days I have been catching up on television and internet after 2 weeks&nbsp;of camp in Mexico, which was very fun, hola a todos mis amigos!&nbsp; As I was watching I love the 90's on VH1 I thought 'Who is so bored that they read blog's?'&nbsp; Because the only blog's I read are the one's of my friends, and I hardly even read those.&nbsp; Unless you crush has a blog, who would bother reading them?&nbsp; I would write more but I am leaving for a plane, so I will leave you with some songs I am listening to right now.  Paulina Rubio- Algo Tienes Fobia- Hoy Tengo Miedo Belinda- Angel (in Spanish, like the above two) Jc Chasez- All Day Long I Dream About Sex (gross lyrics, but kick-butt beat) Felix Da Housecat- Rocket Ride The Streets- Don't Mug Yourself Dead or Alive- You Spin Me Around (Like a Record) The Killers- Somebody Told Me

      Well when you are staying home during the summer with nothing to do, i.e. no Will & Grace or Queer Eye for the Straight Guy on, you can get really bored, which is why I am googling everything I can imagine.&nbsp; What I find weird is that with the safe search off you do not really get anything bad, I googled 'cloudberry' and I got the picture I wanted with the safe search off, so very sneaky.   So, like I said there is going to be news, and the first bit is news shows why Bush needs to be ousted from the White House.   The Bush Administration decided on Friday to withhold all $34 million of congressionally approved funding for the United Nations Population Fund , the world's largest international source of funding for population and reproductive health programs.  This is the third year in a row the administration has blocked the funding.  The U.N. agency estimates the $34 million could have helped prevent as many as two million unwanted pregnancies and nearly 800,000 abortions, 4,700 maternal deaths and over 77,000 infant and child deaths around the world. The money would also have been used to improve maternal health and HIV-prevention efforts.  Timothy E. Wirth, president of the United Nations Foundation, said in a statement that the decision "is a great disappointment to everyone who cares about women's health, maternal mortality, and HIV/AIDS prevention, and, frankly, to all of us who are concerned about the international cooperation as well as America's reputation in the world." He added that the United States is the only country ever to block funding to the U.N. agency for political reasons.  --Juhie Bhatia  From  urlLink www.womensenews.com    P.S. How does one get a picture up on the profile? Just post it in the comments.

      Well, as you can probably tell this is the first entry on this funky blog. &nbsp;I got tired of LiveJournal (after one post) and I forgot my username for the Xanga blog I created.&nbsp; I do not&nbsp;know how my friends do it, I mean not only do they update at least twice a week, but they manage to write almost a paragraph each time.&nbsp; Maybe they have a lot going on with their life, but&nbsp;but to me&nbsp;that is devotion.&nbsp;   I love current events, so there will be a lot of news on this blog among other things, but just like any newssource it will be biased, but it will only be biased if you a a conservative nut, in which case you should slowy step away from the computer and punish yourself for thinking closed-minded people knew how to use "computers" (the "" are there because Mac's are not really computers, they are large pieces of hard candy).   I will update in the next month, if I do not forget, until then an insightful thought:&nbsp; Love burns like laser death rays of love.

      Which is what is happening right now, I hate this over protective dog.  As the summer comes to a close I find myself procrastinating more and more each day, I still haven't called Susy (must do it tomorrow), and I still have not organized my desk, madness I tell you.  But I have been sorting through my work from last year, and I was thinking about how much I am going to miss the ninth grade, and my class.  It will never be the same, some things are just not meant to be.

      Like every day in my life there is not much to write about because there is nothing going on in my life.  There have been some minor changes but not significant enough to produce a joke or anything remotely entertaining.  First off I took up tennis, not that I am any good, or even dress like a tennis player (white shirt and short shorts? no way) but it is a way for me to get excersice.  The second new event is that I am also starting to learn the electric guitar.  Half of me is a bit iffy about it because I was looking around the internet for electric guitars and it hit me, there is more than one style and one maker.  It's not like clothes when you  know  what is good and what is not; there are  loads  of electric guitars so I do not know if I want this as much.  How am I supposed to know why there are so many.  Are some used for certain types of music?, Do they sound different?, Is there one universal electric guitar that does everything?,  What do the most famous rockers use?  I need to know this information!  Hopefully I will find out, but right now I am just trying to decide if guys like girls who know the electric guitar.  One more thought, is it worth to take up a sport like fottie, rugby or skateboarding if you are 15?  Or is that to late to excel in a sport?

      In 23 days school will start, for some it will just be another year, but for me it will be my first year 'alone'. What do I mean by alone? This will be the first year at a school where I will have no friends. Even though I still going to HTH my friends with bad taste are going to HTI and my other friends are staying at Point Loma. All seems lost for me, and that will be even more true if I do not get James and/or Eric in my class. I thought I might 're-vamp' myself per ce for this year as in wearing more girls clothes, blow-drying my hair and going back to the gold old days, when I kept to myself and did not talk to people for the whole year, not just the first week like last year. It won't be super easy but I think by doing this I will be able to get  all  A+'s this year instead 2 out of 3.  Best song to come out in a   long  time: Dragostea Din Tei by O-zone.

      Well, the streak ended, but that is ok, there was no way around it.  I am not very sure when school starts but I am looking forward to tenth grade, sadly all of the good looking guys are in 12th grade now so the will be gone next year *sob sob* no more Russians, oh well.  Right now I am trying to get all of my back to school shopping out of the way, but I can't until I go to London (yay!). I hope all of my friends are doing well and are going to have a great year too.  Would write more but I am hungry, so I am going to go eat.
