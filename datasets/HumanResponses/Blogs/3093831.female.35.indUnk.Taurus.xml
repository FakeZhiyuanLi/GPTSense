      Happy Birthday to me...it started out WONDERFULLY.  My parents called  just before 4:30 am  to sing Happy Birthday to me...they were too funny.  Then my sister Lisa called & had the kids sing with her to me.  Fat baby refused to say a word.  My grandmother left me a message after I'd left for work.  I called her when I got to work & as soon as she said "hello" I said "where is my song" and she immediately started singing.  I laughed so hard.  My grandmother's been singing to me (in her special way) every birthday since I was in elementary school.  It's tradition & I love it (so does she).  My co-worker had her daughter bake me a strawberry & whipped cream cake.  It was soooo good!  I had no intention of doing a whole lot at work today, but that thought backfired on me.  I wound up working myself to state of exhaustion (why am I still up?).  All of my friends (including back east) called with good wishes.  That felt good.  Wes came over...his gift was to take me out to dinner (next week), so he gave me a "little" gift for today.  I opened the gift bag & there was this little, cute, purple bear inside.  I pulled it out & went to hug it & there was a "little green bag" clipped to the bear's ear.  It's called "knockout."  And it did just that to me for a little while...     Rob:  Wes invited you to go to the Cannabis Fest with him this weekend.     I feel good...but very sleepy...

      The heat wave broke & I FINALLY got some restful sleep last night.  However,  it snowed in Grand Rapids last night & the temps have been in the 40s.  One week before my trip...I swear I will have a fit if it's freezing or if there's any snow.  Talked to my Dad this morn...he keeps asking "when are you coming?" (makes me laugh everytime)...I asked him if he knew what day tomorrow is...he said of course!!!  I let him tell me the story of him sitting in the hospital waiting for me to be delivered.  He's so animated when he tells it.  I think he's more excited about my b-day than I am.  Work was uneventful...I guess the company's doing a little bit better since they want to have 7 - 8 new hires in place to start on Monday.  No luck with the job hunt (yet)...  Almost done with Valley of the Dolls.  What will I read next...

      IT'S HOT!!!!!   It's 89 degrees right now (5:00 pm)...my thermostat says 85.  Not having central air SUCKS!    Work was interesting...company quarterly meeting.  Got a 3 year service award (I've obviously been there TOO long) & surprisingly received a noteworthy excellence award with $50 attached (it wasn't my boss who nominated me...what a surprise).  That made me blush.  It actually felt nice to be recognized.  Three day countdown until my birthday...so far I'm feeling ok about that day, but I have a feeling I may end up a little depressed (mainly because I'm not any closer to where I thought I'd be at this age).  Oh well...we'll see.  Too hot to type...  Later...

      GREAT WEEKEND!!!      It was sooo hot this weekend & it's supposed to be even hotter tomorrow.  I'm sweating to death as I type this:-)  Yesterday I spent the day with Danielle, her son (Kinshasa), his cousin (Rickie) & her daughter (my goddaughter - Karima).  My baby's getting so big.  She's such a happy little girl with nothing but an upbeat personality.  She wants to do so much already...like attempting to pull herself into a sitting position while she's laying down.  I was watching her arms shaking & couldn't figure out why until I realized she was trying to push herself up from her elbows!!!  Everything makes her laugh and she has such a beautiful laugh/squeal.  We all went to a park in Oakland for a while & then grabbed some lunch & chilled at their house.  I was a little wiped out by the time I got home.  Today (Sunday), I woke up exhausted & stiff...I'm assuming it's from my adventures at the park & being out in the heat.  I didn't make it to church today, but wound up watching about four different religious celebrations on TV.  It wasn't Glide though...:-(  I met Rob & Evelyn late this afternoon...we made an "attempt" to go to the Cherry Blossom Festival, but there was too much drama in trying to get there.  So we opted for having dinner in the Castro!  It was fun & GOOD (luv Chows!).  We rode back to my 'hood & got ice cream for dessert.  Rob & I were ready to crash...Ev was just getting started (did she crash on the train ride home, or just you?).    Well, it's 9:30 now & I've got to hit the sack...I might be on a roll with this posting thing (don't get too excited cuz then again, I might not!).  Later...

      It's been almost two weeks since my last post (slacker)...I think it's been due to a little stress.  My work hours got cut in half mid-March...luckily I got them back last week.  It's been stressful...mainly (I think) because I'm TOO optimistic...thought I'd be able to handle things finanically.  Reality set in once I got that first paycheck...OUCH!  I think that's why i've had such a hard time sleeping this week.  I still need to find another job...but the market's not so great for me.  But I'm hopeful!     CONGRATS ROB!!!! (You know why!!!) I've done quit a few jigs for you today (can't help it...you know I'm happy for you &amp; get excited easily).       It's countdown time...two weeks from today I'll be flying off to Grand Rapids to see the family.  Should be a good time since no one really knows I'm coming...really nice surprise for my Mom for Mother's Day.  Can't wait to see my three beautiful nieces.  My oldest two ask weekly "Auntie...when are you coming to see me."  Can't wait to see the look on their faces...  I'm currently reading Valley of the Dolls (2/3 of the way thru)...I'm REALLY enjoying this book.  It was given to me as a birthday present a year ago & for some reason I just wasn't interested in reading it.  Boredom forced me to pick it up this week.  Great read!    That's it for now...

      Work was a bear this past week...mainly because of dealing with a boss with a bad attitude.  Rob's helping me with my resume today (found one job so far that I want to apply for).  I definitely need it to (the help) as I'm not able to stay focused.  My Dad called this morning upset & frustrated over his relationship with one of my younger sisters.  I had to give him my usual pep talk so he'd stop stressing & feel better.  I've got some more job search agents to set up & a cover letter (yuck) to work on...

      The weekend was non-eventful...had a bunch of errands to take care of, but got lazy.  I blame my friend Wes for interrupting my deep sleep on Saturday at 7:30 AM!!!  My  phone rang off the hook after that...so my day was thrown completely off.  I wound up doing a lot of web surfing through-out the day.  Robert talked me into posting to one of the online communities called  urlLink Monkeyfilter ...that was a first for me.  Got 5 comments...WHOOOO HOOOOO!!!   Surfing pretty much filled my day.  Sunday I got up (late) & went to church.  Great service.  Came home, did some laundry, talked to all three of my crazy nieces (ages 1 yr., 7 yrs. & 8 1/2) and SURFED SOME MORE!    It's now 8:15 p.m. & I still haven't started working on my resume.  I hope to be working on that tomorrow...

      Robert talked me into creating a blog...so here we go...  Originally, I intended to use this to more or less discuss books I'm interested in or currently reading.  I've since decided that this will serve (kind of) as an online diary.  My intent is to make entries at least a couple times a week.  I'm slacking on my reading...was re-reading Iyanla Vanzant's "In the Meantime," (sort of a relationship self-help book, but better than that)...  My concentration right now is finding a job...

      I missed Carnaval yesterday...went to Church instead (great Ssrvice!).  I'll make Carnaval  next year.  Today, I'm off to Oakland for a barbecue at Danielle's house.  Can't wait!!   And I can't wait to see my beautiful goddaughter...haven't seen in her in about 3 weeks, :-).

      It didn't start out all that great.  My sister loves to forget that I live in California & not Michigan...which is why my phone rang at 5:45 this morning.  Of course I didn't answer it, so she calls back at 7am.  I'm forced to get out of bed this time because I know she will keep calling.  Under normal circumstances, I would have awoken at 6am (thanks to my internal clock), but I'd rented  urlLink   LOTR:Return of the King    and watched it last night and didn't go to bed until around 1:30am.  I spent the majority of the morning walking around my house feeling as though I'd smoked too much pot due to lack of sleep(ooh...that reminds me...hee hee).  Return of the King was really good...AND REALLY LONG (3hrs, 20 min.).  But I think I liked the first two a little better. Having never read the book, I was a little confused/surprised by the ending.    I played around on the 'puter and then finally came too around 1:00.  Met up with Wes (got my "present" back) & journeyed to TJ's & ran some errands.  I've been on this damn computer   for the last three hours making updates to my blog template & checking out other people's blogs and am pissed it's already 9pm.  I still haven't decided if I'm going to attend  urlLink  Carnaval   tomorrow.  I think I'll decide after church tomorrow.

      This has been an insane week for me.  Tuesday, I thought it was Friday.  On Thursday, I thought it was Saturday.  Please don't let me wake up Monday and think I actually have to go to work!!  I desparately need a 3-day weekend.  Haven't decided if I'm going to  urlLink Carnaval  this weekend (I'll decide tomorrow). I didn't go to  urlLink church  last Sunday, so I'll definitely be going this week.  Monday I'm going to Danielle's for a bar-b-que...WOO HOO!  Next weekend should be fun as well as I'm taking a few kids to see Harry Potter with me.  Can't wait!!  [Rob, don't forget to let me know -   since I'll have a car that weekend   - if you want to do a road trip on that Sunday {the 6th)

      I should've called in sick...waking up and thinking it's Friday (on a Tuesday!!!) was my first clue.  Then I spent the majority of the day packing computers to ship to Montreal.  I swear I was getting dizzy on the "fumes" from the packing tape.  Didn't leave work until 4:00pm.  Thought all was well...I'd ride Bart and read all the way to 24th stree instead of getting off downtown to transfer to the street car.    I MUST stop thinking when on public transit!!    My happiness ended shortly after entering the tunnel.  The train halts & then you smell burning brakes.  The operator comes on the P.A. system to announce he's going to shut the train down for a  minute & a half.  Everything goes pitch black (Rob - remember that  "dream"  I told you about regarding us sitting on Bart?  I thought about that and started giggling my ass off).  The lights came back on & the train starts moving...only to stop again.  The operator comes back on to say that we're going to move slowly all the way to Embarcadero station.  About two to three minutes after that the smell is back...and it's WORSE.  The train starts filling up with smoke. And the operator's not saying a damn thing about it.  A few people started to panic (which got me a little panicky).  Another passenger came all the way from the front of the train to tell people to move several cars ahead where there was minimal to no smoke (I think I was in car 8 of 10).  We finally pull into the station and as we're getting off, massive amounts of smoke starts filling the platform.  Obviously I'm taking the street car.  When I get to the Muni platform, it's all filled with smoke as well (that's how bad it was).  The only highlight was that I only had to wait two minutes for my streetcar.  I'm home...I'm cranky...and I smell like smoke.  Please tell me it'll be better tomorrow?

      Did you know there are male camel-toes and female camel-toes. Although there is greater attention placed on the female camel-toe, it is the male camel-toe that actually emerged first.  The male toe (pantalones tightus camelius) did not come into existence until sometime between the 12th and 13th century AD as pants were not a common feature among the male gender prior to this.   urlLink This site  explores the history and beauty of the camel-toe.  My favorite is the haiku section. There you will find me down below the belt buckle hunting moose knuckle  Her jeans betray her Tenth grade math, sixth period My first toe spotting.

      It's past my bedtime & I'm procrastinating.  I already can't wait for this coming 3-day weekend!!  Please let this week fly by...  I did FAR too much surfing (again) today...but I did get my laundry done & a portion of my grocery shopping completed.  Also took a 45 minute walk around the neighborbood...it did end up being beautiful today (it was so foggy/cloudy in the morning, I thought it was going to rain).  I'm feeling very restless...I think it's time to start spring cleaning...

I have a feeling I'm going to be really useless tomorrow.  On a funnier note, Rob swapped one of my open Gmail invites for a poem.  Some guy's gonna write about me being a sexual deviant?  Me?? A sexual deviant..I have no clue what Rob's talking about.  Anywho, I'm looking forward to the poem.

      My trip was great overall...I helped my sister out with her day care kids & just spent time with my family.  Several downers though: my Dad went back into the hospital for surgery on his knee for the umpteenth time & has since been moved to a rehabilitation center; and the weather sucked:  hot, humid & rainy until the day I was scheduled to leave.  Helping my sis out with the kids wore me out a little.  There was one thing I really wanted to do while I was there that I didn't get to, which was  urlLink visitng the public museum .  They'd rebuilt it since the last time I'd visited it & I really wanted to check it out.  I think it's time I scheduled a vacation with just me...

      I'M BACK!!!!  So how was Grand Rapids you ask?...let's start from the beginning...  Thursday, May 6th, I ran around like a chicken with its head cut off right up until I left my house (10pm).   I LOVE being able to take public tranist to the airport; sooo convenient!  My flight was sometime after midnight & I arrived at the airport before 11.  I fell asleep at the gate but woke up in time to board.  I slept the entire way there.  When I arrived at the Gerald R. Ford International Airport (what a joke!), my sister greeted me with one of her day care kids (RJ) in tow & also my 14mo. old niece (Amaria).  She "shoves" my niece in my direction - she looks at me like I'm crazy & then runs & hides behind her mom's leg.  I (of course) picked her up (kicking & screaming) & flung her over my shoulder  to be continued...

      I woke up with a hangover.  Rosie, Henry & his friend John took me out Saturday night.  We went to a little Caribbean hole in the wall.  Food was great!!  After dinner, we went to the movies & saw Man on Fire.  I'm not a Denzel Washington fan, but it was a really good movie (despite what rotten tomato critics have to say).  Then the four of us hit some salsa club in the Mission (no clue what the club was called, too drunk) and danced our asses off.  I don't remember a lot...mainly the movie.  Damn John...he kept buying me drinks.  I told Rosie I thought he was trying to get me drunk.  She told me I'm slow.  Whatever...my feet are KILLING me!  Somehow, I made it to 9am church service.  Glide was awesome (as usual), but it was even better because Wes went with me.  We both got really emotional during a couple of the choir songs.  After church, went home & changed & Rosie picked me up so we could go to the beach boardwalk in Santa Cruz.  We had too much fun.    Great overall birthday weekend.

      So much for sleeping in this morning...I was up by 7:30 or 7:45. I was so pissed when I saw the time...I was hoping it was like 10 or 11.  Wes called shortly thereafter and we had one of our usual silly/half serious conversations.  After that I chatted with Rosie & confirmed this evening's dinner plans (she still hasn't figured out where we're going) & then my folks called.  They're watching all three  grandkids while my sis & b-law are out getting materials to finish the room I'll be sleeping in when I arrive.  My niece Azaria was so sad because she didn't get to spend my birthday with me.  She told me how much she misses me & said that whenever I come, we're going to celebrate my birthday.  I truly can't wait to see the look on her face when I pick her up from school!  Fatbaby refused to talk to me (as usual) & Anakia (the oldest) informed me that she was bored & that I needed to hurry up & come visit.  She was begging me to come for my sister Dianne's birthday (May 19th).  I told her it wasn't going to happen, but who knows, I might come sooner rather than later :-)

      This past weekend was the annual celebration of  gay pride in San Francisco,  urlLink  which has been celebrated since 1970 .   Sunday, Wes and I went to church first (of course). In the afternoon, we went down to meet friends & to get ready for the 5:00 performance of the headliner... urlLink CHAKA KHAN.   Of course she didn't start on time....but she was only 30 minutes late.  We were several hundred people deep, so I got to see a few glimpses of Chaka's hair!  Picture this:  surrounded by thousands of people...the music starts...in unison, the audience screams..."I'm Every Woman."  I start singing along with everybody else only to stop & listen to hundreds of gay men singing "I'm Every Woman."  It was one of the funniest things I've ever seen.  Of course, there was the typical "naked men & women" walking around showing their wares.  Now, I have no problem with that, as long as what your showing off is worth my paying attention.  But when your shit is old & wrinkled (or worse than that), you know damn well you should have either just stayed in the house, or gotten dressed.  I was thrown into shock when I walked past this 60+ year old butt-naked man (wearing nothing but pride beads and glasses).  He had balls the size of a softball and a penis no more than an inch long.    WHY?????     Needless to say, I had a good time, but next year, I'll be wearing more comfortable shoes.

        It all began innocently enough when a user on an Apple help forum posted a picture of his cat, Frankie, contemplating the beauty of a flower. Shortly afterwards another user posted a picture of his cat, Sammy, bristling at the image of Frankie on the monitor. I decided this was too much fun and advanced the concept as The Infinite Cat Project, which is, simply, cats regarding cats regarding cats.  I'll be happy to post a picture of YOUR cat as long as it is shown looking at a monitor which bears the image of the last image in the sequence.

      I can't wait to see this movie!!!   urlLink Scott sez: "Next Friday, June 25th, Michael Moore's Fahrenheit 9/11 opens in a reported 417 theaters across the United States and Canada. An amazing feat given the fact that just a few weeks ago filmmaker Michael Moore was still trying to figure out who would distribute his latest documentary, despite winning Cannes film festival's prestigious Palme d'Or. Various conservative organizations (including "Move America Forward" and the RNC) have launched a preemptive attacks against the movie and are urging movie theaters to drop the anti-American film from their movie lineup."

      Father's Day was launched in Spokane, Washington, in June, 1910, by a woman by the name of Sonora Smart Dodd.  Mrs. Dodd wanted a special day to honor her father, William Henry Jackson Smart (having thought of the idea for Father's Day while listening to a Mother's Day sermon in 1909).  William Smart, a Civil War veteran, was widowed when his wife died in childbirth with their sixth child.  Mr. Smart was left to raise the newborn and his other five children by himself.  It was after Sonora became an adult that she realized the strength and selflessness her father had shown in raising his children as a single parent.  She wanted her father to know how special he was to her.  It was her father that made all the parental sacrifices and was, in the eyes of his daughter, a courageous, selfless, and loving man.  Her father was born in June, so she chose to hold the first Father's Day celebration in Spokane, Washington on the 19th of June, 1910.  In 1924 President Calvin Coolidge proclaimed the third Sunday in June as Father's Day.  Roses are the Father's Day flowers: red to be worn for a living father and white if the father has died.  Father's Day is a day of commemoration and celebration of Dad.  It is a day to not only honor your father, but all men who have acted as a father figure in your life - whether as Stepfathers, Uncles, Grandfathers, or "Big Brothers."

      Around the corner I have a friend, In this great city that has no end, Yet the days go by and weeks rush on, And before I know it, a year is gone.  And I never see my old friends face, For life is a  swift and terrible race, He knows I like him just as  well, As in the days when I rang his bell.  And he rang mine but we were younger then, And now we are  busy, tired men. Tired of playing a foolish game, Tired of trying to make a name.  "Tomorrow" I say! "I will  call on Jim Just to show that I'm thinking of him."  But tomorrow comes and tomorrow goes, And distance  between us grows and grows.  Around the corner, yet miles  away, "Here's a telegram sir," "Jim died today."  And that's what we get and deserve in the end.  Around the  corner, a vanished friend.  - Author Unknown

      I know I'm a drama queen...but something that happened today really made me realize how easily life can change in an instant.  Danielle & I had gone to Walgreens (a block from the job).  I was just standing inside the doorway waiting for Danielle to finish with her purchases when I saw four police cars swerve in front of the store.  I didn't think too much of it because you always see cop cars in this area.  As we were coming out, this man grabbed me & told me to get back inside because "they're about to start shooting."   Like a dummy, I poked my head out of the door to see about 10 cop cars just a few doors down from where we were surrounding this car with guns drawn.  I have never seen anything like that up close and personal in my life and was totally freaked out to say the least.  Thankfully, they didn't end up having to shoot so we were able to leave the store with out further events occuring...but I can't get it out my head what I saw and what could've happened.    Feeling VERY thankful right now...

      People come into your life for a reason, a season, or a lifetime. When you figure out which it is, you know exactly what to do.   When someone is in your life for a  REASON , it is usually to meet a need you have expressed outwardly or inwardly.  They have come to assist you through a difficulty, to provide you with guidance and support, to aid you physically, emotionally or spiritually....   They may seem like a Godsend, and they are. They are there for the reason you need them to be. Then, without any wrong doing on your part or an inconvenient time, this person will say or do something to bring the relationship to an end. Sometimes they die. Sometimes they walk away.... Sometimes they act up or out and force you to take a stand.   What we must realize is that our need has been met, our desire fulfilled; their work is done. The prayer you sent up has been answered and it is now time to move on.   When people come into your life for a  SEASON , it is because your turn has come to share, grow, or learn. They may bring you an experience of peace or make you laugh. They may teach you something you have never done. They usually give you an unbelievable amount of joy.  It is real, but...only for a season.    LIFETIME  relationships teach you lifetime lessons; those things you must build upon in order to have a solid emotional foundation. Your job is to accept the lesson, love the person/people (anyway); and put what you have learned to use in all other relationships and areas of your life.

      This past week was KRAZEE!!  Multiple problems arose at work that made my life shear hell (something to do with servers crashing in our Montreal office).  The Oakland office is growing weekly which means I get to break in new hires (yuck).  By Friday, I was playing catch up (still pissed I didn't get Friday off like I wanted).    Saturday I spent most of the day getting my hair braided (7 hours - not too bad with only one braider) & then spent the rest of the afternoon/evening with Danielle & my goddaughter.  Karima is such a funny baby...she can't stand laying on her back.  She must be able to see EVERYTHING by sitting up.  We'd bought her a crib (had to since she keeps trying to flip herself out of the bassinet) & Danielle & I spent about an hour putting it together.  It was so funny to see her little body in this huge crib.  She was totally enthralled with her new surroundings.  Sad thing is we put the crib up in the living room.  Danielle called me after I'd gotten home to tell me it wouldn't fit through the doorway of the bedroom (too funny).  Sunday:  Church was awesome & packed (as usual).  I'm glad Wes was going with me because I was so exhausted from the past week that I seriously thought about not going. Spent the rest of the day doing a little housework & resting.  Good thing too because my boss just called me a little bit ago asking me to come in earlier (6AM isn't early enough?) because we're more than likely going to have server problems (thanks to him screwing around with one of the servers today).  I'm going to need another vacation soon...  Talked to my mom...she's happy she's now a retiree (as of last Friday, retired elementary school teacher - 36 years!!!).  Shared some potential bad news with me...doctors think my Grandmother may have colon cancer :-(  Won't know more for a while.  My dad's still in the hospital recovering from knee surgery.  They don't know if the infection's gone yet, so he'll remain in the hospital thru the end of the month.  At least my mom's sounding more positive than usual.  I know all of this family drama's been wearing her down.  She and my dad talked about coming out here to see me...hope that happens!  Well, since I've got to be at work before the crack of dawn...I'm signing off for now...hope this week is a better one...

      I have no problem admitting that I'm nothing but a big kid.  I LOVE Harry Potter!!!  Today  (after running morning errands) I went to Oakland to pick up my goddaughter's brother, Kinshasa (8 1/2), & his cousins, Ricky (6) & Anthony (14) so we could trek back to San Francisco (this was Anthony's first time in the city!) to view Harry Potter & The Prisoner of Azkaban.  We arrived early (2:50) for the 3:45 show.  Good thing too...there was already a line for ticketholders.  They finally allowed us to enter around 3:15.  We picked out our seats (waaaay at the top, in the middle) & then went & got popcorn, soda, candy (somebody ate a hotdog).  After about 20 minutes of commercials (what's up with that anyway?)& previews, the movie began (finally).  Now, I'm not going to give away anything...I'll just say it was a great movie.  It was also a lot funnier than the other two.  The boys & I totally enjoyed it.  After the movie we went next door to  urlLink Mel's Drive-in  & got burgers & fries for dinner.  The boys were totally enthralled with the fact that there was a working jukebox at our table.  I was entertained the whole time.  After dinner, we drove to my neighborhood & got ice cream & then drove back to Oakland.  The boys were rowdy (what boy isn't?), but behaved really well.  We all truly had a wonderful day!!!  Now if I can only find a kid (or kid-at-heart) who wants to see Shrek 2...

      This week I've been stuck.  This "issue" with my friend just won't go away.  I've been going back and forth all week second guessing my decision to end things & losing a lot of sleep over it.      Tuesday morning, I purchased Iyanla Vanzant's,  urlLink Yesterday I Cried .  As I was reading it, I came to a part on closure... When you discover that something is broken, you must determine the cause of the break.  In order to do that, you must open the thing, examine it, and find the origin  of the break or malfunction.  Once that is done, you must make a determination as to whether or not the thing is worth fixing.  If you determine that the fixing is worth your effort, it must be done carefully.  If, on the other hand, you decide that the thing is not worth fixing, you must get rid of it.  You must throw it away, clean the place it once occupied, and when you are ready, find a suitable replacement.  This is called "closure."       I'm not ready to let go, even though I said goodbye (but that's because I thought he wanted nothing to do with me).  I truly believe our friendship is worth fixing.  I emailed him this afternoon asking him if he wanted me to leave him alone or if he wanted us to "fix it."    I haven't heard from him...yet....

      I was definitely glad to be out of the house as I think I would've just sat around and moped, feeling sorry for myself. My friends really took care of me this weekend, which is just what I needed. It's very hard to turn off my feelings and pretend nothing's wrong. The last time I talked to my friend was a week ago today. I sent him an email last Monday that he won't even respond too...which has made it hurt worse. I don't understand how someone can tell you they care about and appreciate you, but then treat you like the crap stuck on the bottom of their shoe. I'll be glad when I get to the point where I stop asking why...    The garlic festival was fun! Lot's of good food, but too hot (got really dehydrated)!! I still reek of garlic...tasted a lot of good stuff...I will NEVER try garlic ice cream. There is something so wrong about the fact that it even exists. I'm going to make a point to go next year, but I'm definitely getting there when the doors open (soooo many people).    Church was awesome (& packed) today. I tried to keep it together but my emotions were on over drive &amp; every song the choir sang spoke to the issues going on in my life. So glad I was seeing Shrek afterwards (finally). I definitely needed something to make me laugh. It was a funny movie, but I think I liked the first one more. I don't get why people kept saying that Antonio Banderas' character (Puss-n-Boots) stole the show. The character was funny, but Donkey was much funnier. Can't wait until SpongBob comes out...then I can see it with my nieces when I go to Grand Rapids for Thanksgiving. That's going to be sooo much fun.    Well....I know in time, things will get easier to deal with...I'm hoping this week goes by fast.

       God....such a hard week. I am so thankful for and too the rest of my friends who've been so supportive of my "issues" (regarding the friend I recently said goodbye too). They've allowed me to cry & to talk about it (to keep me semi-sane) and help me move on to better things. Tonight it's pizza and Sex and the City with Rosie....tomorrow I'll be in Gilroy attending the  urlLink garlic festival  with Danielle.  Wes &amp; I will be going to the movies after church on Sunday.    I'm going to get through this, although sometimes I just don't think I'm going to make it. I'm at the point where I literally have to take it hour-by-hour. It's amazing the diffferent emotions you go through when someone you love just really lets you down by showing you how little they really care about and for you.    I've learned the hard way that you can give of yourself unconditionally to someone, be a shoulder for them to vent or cry on, make them laugh, help them financially, pick them up when they've hit the ground &amp; cheer them on when they're successful...and have none of it be of any worth to them in the end.    This realization would probably make other people change who they are to keep from getting hurt...but I enjoy being me and what I have to offer as a friend.

      Today was hard...it started out on a good note, but after two hours at the job, I started having moments of doubt (regarding my previous post). I've spent countless hours believing I truly did something to cause the demise of this friendship and missing him terribly. I keep having experiences of crying suddenly in one moment and then being"ok" the next. I feel like I'm going crazy. I surfed the net for some suggestions on the grief process and this is what I found.     urlLink The Stages of Dealing With Grief      urlLink Beware The Five Stages of Grief     and in my opinion, the best link of all:     urlLink The Four Stages of Grief     Following the suggestions from the last link regarding denial has proven extremely helpful this evening. I'm praying tomorrow will be a better day.

      I posted the following over a month ago.&nbsp; I painfully ended a 3+ year friendship two days ago.&nbsp; It's one of the hardest things I've&nbsp;ever had to do, as I care for & love this person deeply.&nbsp; I keep re-reading this to remind myself it's okay to let go...

      I can't believe we're already into the month of August. This year is flying by and I've accomplished and learned a lot. Now, if I can only find a better job...  My "friend" decided not to respond to the letter I e-mailed on Thursday. So I guess I got my answer. A very strange calmness came over me yesterday. I've accepted his decision to not be a part of my life. It feels weird to acknowledge that....to have gotten to the point of being okay with letting go. I truly have nothing but love for him & if I caused him any pain, I hope he knows that I'm sorry and wish him well.  Saturday, Danielle &amp; I took the kids to  urlLink Six Flag's Marine World  to celebrate her son's birthday. It wasn't as warm as I thought it was going to be (that's a good thing), so it turned out to be a great day. We were all worn out by the time we left.  Sunday, Wes & I went to  urlLink church  (awesome as usual). I'm hoping to get up the nerve to join the choir soon (we'll see). They're soooo good!! He &amp; I were drawing attention, due to him banging away on his Barbara Mandrell tambourine. He informed me that I was drawing the attention of the saxophone player. I don't know what the hell he's talking about...it would be nice to find a nice church man :-)
