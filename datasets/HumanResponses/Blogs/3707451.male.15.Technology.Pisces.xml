      the title of this blog is dreams of A G.....and it was meant to house my dreams...but i think i'll put more..because its important my thoughts are here too....because after all, i am a "pensive" guy...hmm pensive vs. contemplative? pensive makes me sound like i have a ball point at one end of me... but anyway.. things are excellent...and im trying to spruce up this page...but im in denver right now, visiting my brother and family...im looking forward to being back...so i can get back to my stuff...but especially so i can see my baby
