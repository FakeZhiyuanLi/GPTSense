      it was a normal thursday nite on july 22. grams (my moms mom in willoughby) was on the fone w/my uncle. she got off. talked 2 my granps 4 a bit. she tried 2 get her water but couldnt move her arms. so my gramps got it 4 her. she didnt say nething 2 him. then she tried 2 drink w/the cap on. my gramps noticed and took it off 4 her. he said that he helped her try and drink. but the water just ran down her face. so then, my gramps called 911. my grams tried 2 get up but, my gramps had 2 hold her down and lay her on the floor of the patio. she got 2 the hospital and my mom got the call. she went 2 get my gramps all around 8:09pm. @ the hospital, my grams saw my gramps walk int and she said,"theres my husband" and she pointed @ him. well finally around 9:30 me and my dad and sis got there. we waited till 11:30 and went home. my mom stayed till 12:30ish. we were all VERY upset. it turns out: grams had a mild stroke. the artery on the left side of her neck was clogged. 99%. so she had a surgery on sat. around noon.  everything went well. but one of her tests shows that she had one b4. on her rite side. so grams blood pressure is high. and her cholestreal. (sp?) so now shes in the hospital for 3 more days. they noticed shes anemic and r doin more tests. we'll all wait and see. plz, keep my grams in mind. she came very close 2 death. i'd say she "looked death in the eye". so, srry i havent posted but i did now. ttyl love 4eva, candy I LOVE YOU BEN! THANKS FOR EVERYTHING!

      Summer Days ~By: Vicky & Patti  Flip flops and tank tops; spending days at the park. Swinging on the swings; with your best friend Mark. Hanging out with friends; staying out till dark.  Everyday at sunrise; is perfect weather for a morning run. No tests or homework; just playing in the sun. Even on a rainy day; It's still a day of fun.  Taking pictures on vacation; at Myrtle Beach. Wanting to be in Georgia; to get a fresh ripe peach. Hanging out in the lake; Hoping not to see a leach  Getting a dark tan;  that will last me all year. Losing the summer sun; won't bring us great cheer. When its time to say goodbye; we'll all shed one last tear.  Good Luck Class Of 2008
