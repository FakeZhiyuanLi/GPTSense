      Hi my friends. This is my second blogg. hihi. It`s kinda fun. Well, first I have to tell what I did last weekend. I was a trip to a friend of mine, and we had a party, and went to the city to party. That was so fun, and really helped me get rid of a lot of bad energy. I love those trips to the cities. Oh its so great. I think I`m gonna go next week too. Soon it`s gonna be the olympics! Oh that`s gonna be so great. I`m really looking. Oh yeah OOH AAH party all night long :)) Friendzz 4 evah!  Oh I`m at work again. Answering some phone calls. Really exhausting. Hate it. Right now there was a bothersome man calling an I really hated it. DAMN another phone call :(. Trying to be nice. Putting him over to another to a different service center. I`m really looking forward to finish this job, and start studying again. Very annoying women just called in. Wouldn`t hang up. Damn I wish someone would grab her neck and twist it *twuck*. HAH. Eat that bitch. That would surely be something. Just because you miss that fucking cable tv. How lame is it possible to get. God damn it.  Home again. Ah it`s so nice and relaxing. My cat is waiting for me. I`m watching TV. It`s Cher with "Turn Back Time". Brings back sweet memories from the 80`s when I was a little girl and wanted to look dirty and daring like Cher in that video. Those were the days. I`m just going to make a pasta salad and relax myself. Really looking forward to the last part.  Petronella

      Hi. This is my first blogg. Hopefully not the last! Here I am :)) My name is Petronella, I`m 24 years old. I was born 14. July 1980, right here in Stockholm.  Right now I`m at work. I`m kinda tired :( I`ve been working here for a long time now and I`m lookin` for something new! So if anyone know of anything plz tell me! My job is currently answering phone calls at a so called call center. My specification is cable tv so I get a lot of complaints from people not getting to see tv! But hey it`s not that bad. I get to be boss sometimes too. I`m a team leader and have 5 "diciples" :) This day has been a hectic day, I almost haven`t had time to write this blog. But I`m using these last few minutes of my lunchbreak to write, so it could be a little "messy", I hope you can live with that.  Well, I`m answering phone calls from people having problems with cable tv. I answer aprx. 100 calls a day, and I`m working 8 hours a day. There are many different kinds of people that are calling. I can categorize them roughly into the following groups (hope this is ok); 1.Old poor people(oh so sweet ;o, hard to hang up on these cuties, feel bad for them. Try to help them as much as I can :) 2.Men who are strict and never anything else 30-60 (this group is a little boring but ok too deal with. 3.Women who are almost impossible to get rid of(these are complaining and are never quite satisified. Hard to please. 4.Young people from Norway or Denmark(neighboor countries) who are very patriotic and always talks about football on TV. 5.People that explain things very deeply. A little annoying.  There might be more categories coming up when I recall them while talking. Right now I can`t remember any more. Maybe it`s just because it`s so late on the day.  Now it`s 50 minutes till I`m off, god I`m looking forward to this. Today I`m going to eat strawberries and go and visit my friend Linda. .. Now I`m off! Goodbye :))  Love and kind regards from Petronella
