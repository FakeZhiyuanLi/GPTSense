       ...with  urlLink The J-Rod , now that  urlLink Blogger.com  kicks ass. We will see many more of these watered down simple blogs. It's not about designing a nice blog at all. It's about simplicity and great interesting content. Since most people just use the available templates everyones blog looks the same so you need the content to back it up. If you want a fancy blog with detailed posting get yourself  urlLink TextPattern . However if you are looking to share your blog with simplicity in mind this is the way to go.   At this rate I predict everyone and their dog will have a blog, or maybe their  urlLink cat .

       A few hours short of 2 years ago,  urlLink The Deuce  created a  urlLink Blogger.com  account. As you can tell by the time between posts, it has not really ever been used. However since then a lot has changed and my life has evolved.  urlLink Project Deuce  is on its way and I am here to share it's tale.

       OH NO!!! There is a new distraction coming to the downtown. One of  urlLink The Deuce's  favorite things is an authentic east coast donair. It just so happens that the best donair in the province is making a new home  about half a block from my apartment.   That's right the  urlLink famous Jack's Donair!    urlLink

       Recently,  urlLink The Deuce  has been exploring the world of finger picking. I have never really done much of it while playing my  urlLink guitar . However I have been dabbling into it lately.   I find for the first time in a long time it makes me feel awkward with a guitar. Scary but exciting. You know, it make sme frustrated that I can't just rip out a nice sound but it pumps me up as I get better. It's a nice challenge.

       Inspiration can come from many things. I feel it from music. I believe that is why I enjoy music so much. Tonight I am watching something that really gets that flame buring to do make something of yourself and be successful.   As odd as it may sound coming from an alternative/metal fan; the  urlLink Freddie Mercury Tribute Concert  is amazing. So many great artists from many different genres. From  urlLink Metallica  to  urlLink Liza Minelli , the show is awesome.   I have always been a closet  urlLink Q  urlLink u  urlLink e  urlLink e  urlLink n  fan. Mainly because of two things:   Outstanding creativity   Excellent composing   Well, back to the video, heh,  urlLink Axl  just got on stage.

       So I know this is way off topic but with the recent updates to  urlLink Blogger.com  it well...kinda sucks now.   This once easy to use system has been spoiled with its new WYSIWYG system for "dummies" that can code their own HTML..... Heck children learn HTML everyday. If you can't do it yourself: PAY SOMEONE WITH THE SKILLS TO DO IT FOR YOU!    urlLink Google  is not a foolish tool for amatuers; why would you spoil  urlLink Blogger ?    Also on top of all this the new system doesn't work with  urlLink Safari  :( it spits our a bunch of regex garbage...... did the designers even test the system before making it live....   This is a HUGE let down, I would expect this from  urlLink MicroSoft  but not  urlLink Blogger .
