      Yay me...I started a blog. As I'm sitting here inhaling Starlight peppermints, I'm trying to think of something interesting and profound to post, only to no avail. Beginning and ending has always been rather difficult for me when it comes to writing. What happens in between is the easy part, since my thought bounce back and forth like an old-school game of Pong on Atari. Let me first say that I'm a month away from my 24th birthday, and I have no offspring, no criminal record, and no college degree. As each day goes by I find myself becoming more and more of a rare breed. Young, black, intelligent...Knowledge of a little bit about a lot of things, but with no means or desire to put it to practical use. I could excel at a hundred things, and fall flat on my ass all the same. I find my time being spent either idle, or being a workaholic. I'm still trying to find a balance between the two. I feel like I have a 19 year old mind, and a 49 year old soul...All in all I have yet to fall victim to what I refer to as the "Frizzy Cornrow Mentality".--Just another nigga with 2 baby-mamas selling dimes of dope to get by and buy a new pair of Air Force Ones to match a pink throwback jersey.--The greatest worry of mine trying to find somebody to braid my nappy ass hair. I have more going for me than most. I have a beautiful yet crazy woman who's destined to have an impact on people's lives and doesn't realize it yet.I love the way she's completely enamored by me when she stares at me with those "old lady" eyes, and smiles with those "spoiled little girl" cheeks. I love my mom despite all the "issues" she has. I love how my WORDS have a signifigant impact on people, and the soothing effect it has on them. If I didn't have stage fright I'd give speeches. lol One thing I don't know if it's a gift or a curse is my salesmanship. Quite honestly, I've sold shit to people I wouldn't ever buy in a million years...And capitalized off of it.--Just like the American way. I've hoodwinked people into signing documents that they were too complacent to read the fine print to profit a few dollars. I'm a hypocrite. I can admit it and be at peace with that. But then again who isn't a hypocrite? Take a look at yourself, and tell yourself with all honesty that you haven't done something that you swore you'd never do. You show me someone who's never been a hypocrite, and I have a small ocean to sell you.--Complete with a fishing boat, and a free oil-spill clean up kit. I'll even throw in an ozone repair package. I think I'll end it here for my very first post. There will be much more to come.

      Okay, as the minutes tick down to my 24th birthday, I'm sitting here reflecting on my life.  I'm 24 (by the end of this post)  with no kids, no criminal record, and no cell phone.  I'm not as well off as I'd like to be, but I'm definitely better of than a good percentage of people I graduated (or "finished") school with.  I've jumped from the Dickies and Air Jordan era, to the Pink t-shirt, pink wristband, pink  Air Jordan era. ..Back when a value meal was $3.49 after you supersized it! When Now & Laters were a dime a pack, and it had 6 nice sized taffies in it!  Now I'm in the era of ordering food through a bullet-proofed glass window, because too many episodes of "When Keepin' it Real Goes Wrong..."  Aside from that, life is just grand. Things could always be worse....even if they can be better.  As for another 365 days  on this earth, I'll be celebrating in front of the PS2, until payday! *cha-ching!*...*sings* Happy Birthday to me....Happy birthday to me...Happy birthday Me Myself and I...Happy birthday to me...And Many More! Now that that's out of the way, I just wanted to address some issues I've had on my mind. The whole Ricky Williams ordeal. I straddle the fence on that because he's rich, he's found something he's passionate about, etc etc. But one thing I have to say about that. If it were me,  I woulda showed up to training high as a motherfucker! And just say, "Fuck all of you, I'm riiiich beeyatch!!" LOL On a more serious note, I seriously need to find some stuff to write about because I'm getting a little rusty...Oh yeah, I also have to say: Dave Chappelle is my new role model! He only lives about 35 minutes away from me in Yellow Springs, so I really wanna just go over his house and get drunk and pass out in his guest room with a pS2 controller in hand. I read in USA Today that he signed a deal worth $35 million over 2 seasons on Comedy Central, which is by no means small change. When questioned for comment, he said something along the lines of "I really don't understand the contract...I think they have a clause in it that pays me reparations for slavery." LOL  Dave Chappelle you my nigga man!
