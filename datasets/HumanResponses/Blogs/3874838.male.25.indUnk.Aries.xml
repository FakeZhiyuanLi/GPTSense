       Mood:  Tired   &nbsp;  OK, so I haven't blogged in a while - things have been so busy with Thrive and moving (starting on that tonight) and so forth that I've just... not really taken the time I guess.&nbsp; I really need to keep up with this...  Last weekend we had AOF, overall it was good - some friends (Kelli and Zazzi) came into town and brought one of their friends, Ryan along.&nbsp; We had a good time  which reminds me - I've gotta update my photo gallery - maybe once I'm done with the move, eh?  BTW - found an interesting article -->  urlLink Is Our Copy of the Bible a Reliable Copy of the Original?

       Mood:  Unproductive    I'm not feeling particularly enthused today.  Don't get me wrong it hasn't been a BAD day... I'm just tired... and I am VERY ready to leave work.  Today I stopped on my way in to work and helped someone jump their car - that was a good thing... just made me feel good and what-not.

       Mood:  Tired    Well, this weekend has been fairly uneventful - and then again... Not so much. :)  Friday evening I worked a lot on the Thrive website and registration page... and registration is up, yeah!! :)  urlLink    and we have had our first registrant!!  So, I'm excited about that...  And then Saturday evening, we all went over to Sondra's place and cooked, and ate, and talked, and such... it was a lot of fun - we haven't done that in a long time.  This is going to be a BUSY week... more to come later... gotta work now :)

       Mood:  Ecstatic    First off... I've only got a few more hours before the weekend begins... and I have nothing in particular planned for this weekend!! Yes, this is a good thing... generally I feel so busy on the weekend... but this time I might be able to actually just enjoy it... we shall see.  I'm also excited because I believe I have the design all planned out in my head for the mag ads for Thrive.... I'll put mouse to screen when I get home tonight and do some preliminary mock-ups, maybe flesh them out tomorrow.  Thirdly, I'm excited because the Thrive website is up, running, and ready to receive content.... hmmmmm soon.... :) check it out -->  urlLink thrive2004.com   Lastly, I've got some good ideas for my personal website... I'll need to jump on that this weekend as well, once I get the other two big-ticket items out of the way...  I guess my weekend isn't THAT un-busy, eh? oh well.... such is life... well, my life anyway

       Mood:  Tired    Well, today I got off to a REALLY slow start - I was SO tired.  I slept straight through last night, but I guess I just needed more sleep.  I am very glad it's Friday.  I have no idea what we are all going to do tonight - but I know that I am looking forward to not going to work tomorrow.  Don't get me wrong - I love my job... there are just some weeks, like this one, that I really look back and think "man, I should have taken a vacation this week"

       Mood:  Excited    Well, in case you don't already know my roommates and I are moving at the end of the month... I'm pretty excited about it.  Rent will increase a little each (about $30) but we are getting a bigger place, with a better view, and a nicer layout... so, that'll be cool.  Besides the place we live at right now is a serious dump... so it'll be good to get out of that...

       Mood:  Geeky    OK guys, I finally created my blog.  I will try to post a new rambling every day or so - depending on how things go...    Be sure to leave comments!      Within the coming week I will be incorporating my home page, my gallery, my forum, and my blog all into one site... but for the moment... you can get to these items through their respective locations.
