      I am planning to study the book of Isaiah this summer.  I want to share some of my thoughts as I continue to study.  I figure that if I can keep up a blog on the topic, I will be more accountable to stick-to-it-iveness.  :-)  As I begin this study, it is important to me to spend a good amount of time in background work ... for the sake of context.  Isaiah prophesied during the reigns of four kings of Judah:  Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah.  I am currently reading from II Kings and II Chronicles about these four kings.  I am also using some commentaries (especially Matthew Henry) to help me understand the significance of these four kings and of the events of the times in relation to the Old Testament history of the Hebrew people.  Look for some devotional thoughts as well as historical and theological philosophizing in this blog.  And ... as always ... feel free to comment....

      Uzziah became king at the age of 16 years.  That’s so young!!  Yet, he started strong.  He was all about strength (even his name connects him to the might of Yahweh.)  He was strong militarily, both domestically and abroad.  He set up a port city, Elath, to add to the strength of Judah.  He conquered Philistine cities and dominated other nations.  He sustained troops at home (over 300,000!!) with armaments for each of them.  He built towers around Jerusalem, and created fortresses in the desert for protection.  He was also strong in wealth, as he had much livestock throughout the land.  The Lord favored him.  But he made a fatal error.  It was one of those moments that I would imagine that he spent the rest of his life regretting.  I would have.  One day, Uzziah entered the temple with the intention of making an offering of incense to the Lord.  But, offering incense was NOT his place.  Offering incense was a rite reserved for the priests alone.  The priests stood in his way, attempting to persuade him against what he was about to do.  While the verbal conflict was taking place, the Lord struck Uzziah with leprosy.  LEPROSY!!  He remained a leper for the REST of his life.  He was forced to separate himself from other people, his son performed the duties of the judge of the people, and he was  not  buried amongst the other kings, but in a field … all because he was unclean.  What a shameful end to his strong years of rule.  We all make choices on a daily basis.  We all have to live with the consequences of our choices, whether good or bad.  I find that I often create situations for myself, based on my emotions, in which I then have to make a choice.  Then, whether I like the consequences or not, I have to live with those consequences.  I wonder what Uzziah’s heart was telling him that fateful morning.  I wonder what he was thinking as he decided to enter the temple, as he decided to pick up the censer.  Did he have that jabbing in his heart, that ache in his stomach, telling him that he was doing the wrong thing?  What was it that made him decide to get up from his palace, approach the temple, enter the temple, pick up the censer, and approach the incense?  At each step, was the Lord whispering in his ear, “No!” … or had he hardened his heart?  Had his pride taken over … throughout the days preceding … throughout the weeks preceding … throughout the months preceding … throughout the years preceding?  How long does it take for a pride like this to accumulate?  Did it begin the day the sixteen-year-old took the throne?  Or did it begin the day of his first military victory?  Or did it begin much later, after the strengths began to pile up.  Worship.  Wasn’t he merely attempting to worship the Lord?  Matthew Henry points out (II Chronicles 26) that some of Uzziah’s predecessors sinned by forsaking the worship of the true God, Yahweh.  There is a fine line here, as Uzziah sinned in the opposite direction.  He went to worship Yahweh, in the temple of Yahweh, but not on Yahweh’s terms.  He took into his own hands a job that was not his.  Was he being pretentious?  Was he attempting to exercise practices that were too high for him?  Clearly there was a pride issue here.  Do I do this?  I certainly know that pride is one of my biggest issues.  I certainly don’t forsake worship, nor do I worship other gods.  I am actively involved in the worship at my church.  But is my pride an issue?  I have felt that urging in my heart for years now.  Have I ignored it?  Have I grown at all in that area?  My worship is far from pure.  I would normally attribute that problem to two things:  (1) my pride, in that I love listening to myself produce music …  how arrogant ; and, (2) my inability to concentrate on any one thing for any length of time.  Pride.  The Lord strengthened Uzziah.  The Lord gave him his military strength.  The Lord gave him a strong rule.  The Lord gave him his wealth.  The Lord gave him victory after victory.  Yet, again, according to Matthew Henry, Uzziah lifted up his own heart instead of lifting up the name of the Lord.  Again, do I do this?  Do I truly acknowledge the Lord for the strengths that He has given me?  Do I lift up my own heart in lieu of His name?    Leprosy is a very shameful disease to have.  Lepers are ugly to look at.  Lepers must be separated from the normal population.  The disease itself eats away at the body.  It is the antithesis of strength.  And Uzziah wasn’t merely struck with leprosy for a period of time.  It was for the remainder of his life.  And he was even dishonored in the burial of his disease-ravaged body, and not buried with his fathers.  So, do I motivate myself to purify my worship and to rid my heart from pride by reminding myself of Uzziah’s shame?  Should I avoid sin because of its negative consequences?  Or should I see my sin as an offense against the Lord who IS my might.  Lord, help me to give you the place you deserve in my heart … rid me of the pride that lifts up myself and purify the worship that I offer you whether at church or outside of that building.

      OK ... don't call me a blog-slacker ... I've updated my  urlLink other blog  several times this week.   AND , please don't think that I've been an Isaiah-slacker.  I've actually been ruminating about Uzziah and what I wrote in the previous post on this blog.   AND , I've been spending some really  good  time reading about King Hezekiah.  Now, you may be thinking, "But, Lou Ann, you've skipped TWO of the kings."  And you're right ... after King Uzziah (see previous post) comes King Jotham (II Kings 15:32-38 and II Chronicles 27) and then King Ahaz (II Kings 16 and II Chronicles 28).  I found that I really didn't feel drawn to spend much time contemplating those kings.  Yes ... they're important to the story of Isaiah.  Yes ... I did read each account of both of them.  And, yes ... I even dug into some commentaries about each of them.  But, no ... I was not drawn to go further than that.  Since this study of these four kings is really just a rabbit trail from my Isaiah study, I figured that it's okay.  Here's the short version:  King Jotham (son of Uzziah) was a good guy.  That's it ... he was basically a good guy and did right in the sight of the Lord.  Then there's King Ahaz (son of Jotham).  Let's just say that King Ahaz did  NOT  do right in the sight of the Lord.  He worshipped just about everything  except  the Lord.  He even closed the doors to the temple of the Lord.  SO ... what to expect in upcoming posts?  Well, I am absolutely  fascinated  with King Hezekiah (son of Ahaz).  He was a man who did right in the sight of the Lord.  Even more so than his great grandfather, Uzziah.  The II Kings story about Hezekiah tells about him from a different angle from the II Chronicles story.  Both stories are wonderful and very interesting and leave LOTS of room for introspection ... and "up"-trospection.  (FYI ... in my devotions I am reading the Max Lucado book, _It's Not About Me_, which, if you know me even a little, you know is all about a lesson that I NEED to learn ... so you may be finding little bits and pieces of that thinking as I write in this blog.)  So, in the posts in the near future, you can expect to read about King Hezekiah ... opener of temple doors, builder of pools, prayer warrior, consultor of Isaiah, remover of high places, destroyer of idols, and all-around devotee to the Lord!!  The bottom line is, in my own humble opinion, that the Kings of Judah (probably even the kings of both Judah  AND  the kings of Israel would make great stuff for a study in and of themselves....  Hmmm....

      King Hezekiah's story is found in II Kings 18-20 and II Chronicles 29-32.  As I indicated in my previous post, I have lots of thoughts on King Hezekiah.  I think that I'll work through them one by one for this and the next couple of posts so as to allow myself to process.  Last week our church arranged for the movie,  urlLink _Luther_  to be shown at the Hoffman Center ... two showings, tickets only available through our church.  It's a great movie, and I plan to purchase it if it ever comes out on DVD.  One of the things that it left me thinking about was the idea of God choosing each of us to do different things within the body.  Here was Martin Luther, essentially the father of all Protestant based theology (I might be off there ... I'm not very knowledgeable on church history) ... he was a simple monk, who was having arguments with the devil and seemed almost obsessively driven to seek church reform.  And, as a result, many have come to know Christ today as a result of his ministry.    Then there are these four kings in the Old Testament.  It's important for me to remind myself that these are not merely four guys who independently ended up as kings.  They were great-grandfather, grandfather, father and son.  And, if you look at the ages, you will see that both grandfathers were around to see their grandsons born.  What I'm thinking here is this:  Uzziah saw the birth of his grandson Ahaz.  Uzziah died when Ahaz was four years old.  Had Ahaz already started to show evil tendencies by the age of four?  Did Uzziah mourn the lack of godliness that his son showed?  Jotham died when his grandson, Hezekiah, was nine years old.  Was Hezekiah already following the Lord by that age?  Even though his father, Ahaz, was an evil man?  If you look farther into the math, Ahaz was 11 or 12 years old when Hezekiah was born.  All of these family connections make the stories more intriguing.  Now, getting back to callings and such ... I keep thinking about the fact that king #1 does good, his son king #2 does good,  his  son king #3 does very bad, and  his  son king #4 does very, very good.  These four men's lives overlapped.  Yet one of them turned out to be incredibly evil and did not at all follow the Lord.  And one of them turned out to be very much a man after God's heart, as was King David.  How does it happen that God uses one man for very, very good and another man for evil?  In fact, how did Ahaz turn out so evil when his father was such a good man?  And how did Hezekiah turn out so wonderfully good when his father was so very evil?  And then there's me.  Why did God choose me for His kingdom?  I know ... He chose to love Israel not because they were large in number (Deuteronomy 7:7) but because He loved them.  Really what He was saying was that He loved them because He loved them.  Because He wanted to.  Why did God choose to love me.  Not because I'm bigger or stronger or better or more virtuous or more pure than anyone else ... in fact I'm none of those things.  Yet He chose to love me because He loved me.  Now, I'm not one to look a proverbial gift horse in the mouth.  My frustration with this idea is for the people who God didn't chose.  I know ... I know ... the question of the ages.  Free will vs. selection.  Works vs. grace.  Maybe no human being has ever really had a good handle on answering that question.  Doesn't mean that I still don't feel a little bit of "survivor's guilt" because I'm on this side of the line.  But when I get myself  really  mired in this question, I go even farther.  Why did Martin Luther become so important to Christianity that he was tortured by evil spirits?  Why was  he  the one that God used to begin Protestantism?  Not that I'm jealous ... please know that I don't want to be kept up at night arguing with the devil!!  But there are some God uses one way and some He uses another.  And why me ... or why not me?  Again ... asked and answered in I Corinthians 12:14ff.  God uses each member of the body differently.  If the foot decided to be a hand... if the the whole body would be a hand, how would we walk.  So ... I'll let Martin Luther be tortured by the devil ... and I'll let King Ahaz alone with his evil, God-denying reign ... and I'll let Hezekiah keep the credit for ridding Israel of idol worship and turning them back to the One, True God.  I don't know if I'm a foot or a hand or an eye or an ear or a mouth (probably the latter, LOL!), but I need to walk through every day allowing the Lord to use me as He will ... and be content in Him.

      Okay … I have decided that if I continue to spend the time that I want to reading about … and pondering … King Hezekiah, I’ll never really get to the text of Isaiah.  Can you say, "rabbit trail"??!!  So, this will be my last post about Hezekiah.  But I’m sure I’ll be back to him someday.  My next post will (hopefully!) be about the book of Isaiah, chapter 1!!  Although I really didn’t mean to get into the whole works vs. grace … or free will vs. selection argument last time, I did.  And, my first point here will probably end up at a similar place.  I am fascinated by the thinking in II Kings 18:33ff.  One of the officials from Assyria, Rabshakeh, was calling out to the people within Jerusalem, pointing out to them that none of the gods of other countries were able to deliver them from the hand of the king of Assyria.  So, why should the Lord deliver Jerusalem from his hand?  This theme essential question is presented to Hezekiah and the residents of Jerusalem on other occasions within these passages.  Now, I’ve been a believer for much of my life.  I am well aware that most believers experience certain doubts.  One recurring doubt throughout my whole life has been the fact that many very intelligent people (much more so than I) believe very different things “in faith”.  I’m sure that there are many highly intelligent folks out there who believe in other “gods” or follow other religious traditions.  What’s to say that MINE is the “true” one?  I mean, please know that I do believe that Biblical Christianity is the true faith … but why is it that I believe that?  Because it’s logical?  Well, even the Bible that I read says that the wisdom of this world is foolishness before God.  (I Corinthians 3:19-20)  I mean, if I am admittedly not too wise myself, and even the wisest of men are foolish before God, then I can’t say that I am convinced of my faith because it’s logical.  Duh, right?  So … do I believe that Christianity is the true faith because my heart is convinced it is?  There are people out there who follow all kinds of crazy things, convinced in their hearts that what they’re doing is “true”.  Imagine those people who, to this day, believe that Charles Manson is Jesus Christ.  Am I on their level?  The more I ponder this, the more I’m convinced that I just have to trust that Christ has changed my heart, and that I don’t need to understand why.  The people of Jerusalem remained silent before the official from Assyria, confident that when King Hezekiah said, “Do not answer him” that this word was sufficient.  In II Kings 19:14-19, Hezekiah’s prayer is recorded.  In his hands is a letter from messengers from Assyria, stating the same ideas that I wrote of above.  Hezekiah’s first order of business with God, though, is to recognize God as Lord of all nations – even those who don’t worship Him.  He then goes on to acknowledge that the Assyrians are truly attacking God and not just the Judeans.  He also acknowledges that any other “god” is merely a work of men’s hands.  Finally, he pleads with God to deliver Judah from the Assyrians so that “all the kingdoms of the earth may know that [Thou] alone, O Lord, art God.” (II Kings 19:19)  What a prayer!!  To be primarily concerned with how God’s name is glorified in front of other people or even nations … well, I must admit that prayer like that is not reflective of my prayer life.  It’s not all about me…  I also find it interesting, in II Chronicles 30:17-20, we see a clear, Old Testament example of Grace.  There were Levites who had not yet purified themselves according to the ceremonial law in order to help with the sacrifices.  Hezekiah prays that the Lord would pardon these:  “May the good Lord pardon everyone who prepares his heart to seek God, the Lord God of his fathers, though not according to the purification rules of the sanctuary.”  And the Lord heard Hezekiah’s prayer and healed the people.  AWESOME!!  Finally, I ought to add this to my every growing list of favorite verses:  II Chronicles 32: 7-8.  Hezekiah was encouraging the people of the land just before the king of Assyria was to send his troops upon Jerusalem.  Here is what he tells them:  “Be strong and courageous, do not fear or be dismayed because of the king of Assyria, nor because of all the multitude which is with him; for the one with us is greater than the one with him.  With him is only an arm of flesh, but with us is the Lord our God to help us and to fight our battles.”  And the people relied on the words of Hezekiah king of Judah.  Sounds rather New Testament, huh … like I John 4:4.  Now … on to Isaiah, chapter one!!  :-)

      Just so that you know that I'm continuing to work on Isaiah ... but don't have much blog-worthy yet.  Here's what I'm doing ... I'm re-reading the first chapter and making lists of the things mentioned in the figurative language used by Isaiah.  I have looked online to find a list of the types of figurative language (like I learned in High School and then promptly forgot), and they are:  *  simile : a comparison of two dissimilar things using "like" or "as", e.g., "my love is like a red, red rose" (Robert Burns).   *  metaphor : a comparison of two dissimilar things which does not use "like" or "as," e.g., "my love is a red, red rose" (Lilia Melani).  *  personification : treating abstractions or inanimate objects as human, that is, giving them human attributes, powers, or feelings, e.g., "nature wept" or "the wind whispered many truths to me."  *  hyperbole : exaggeration, often extravagant; it may be used for serious or for comic effect.  *  apostrophe : a direct address to a person, thing, or abstraction, such as "O Western Wind," or "Ah, Sorrow, you consume us." Apostrophes are generally capitalized.  *  oxymoron : a statement with two parts which seem contradictory; examples: sad joy, a wise fool, the sound of silence, or Hamlet's saying, "I must be cruel only to be kind"  (I left out onomatopoeia: a word whose sounds seem to duplicate the sounds they describe--hiss, buzz, bang, murmur, meow, growl; because I don't know enough about the language in which Isaiah wrote (Hebrew?) to know if he used this.)  These terms and explanations were taken from  urlLink the web pages of an English professor at the Brooklyn College .  I am also using several different commentaries ... just for an introduction to the book.  You see, I read very slowly, and Isaiah has 66 chapters.  It's difficult for me to pick up a theme in a long book, and the introductions written by different commentary authors will help me to create a mental structure for use during my study.  Once I get myself pretty much in a "structure" and with some themes in mind, I will begin to comment on my own reading/study of the different chapters and verses.  I also am working slowly so as to be careful NOT to get into "application" too quickly, as I firmly believe that the application portion of study needs to be only a small proportion of the study, after LOTS of observation and some interpretation.  Thus ... my first observation from Isaiah, chapter 1, is that there is LOTS of figurative language and I need to decide how to look at that.  I'll be back!!  :-)

      Okay ... please remember that this blog is more for my study purposes than for those of y'all who might be reading it. I have really been taking my time reading several different overviews of the book to get a feel for what's coming. I have stumbled upon several more literary terms that I would like to keep in mind as I'm studying:   * Assonance  - (1): resemblance of sound in words or syllables; (2) a: relatively close juxtaposition of similar sounds especially of vowels, b: repetition of vowels without repetition of consonants (as in stony and holy) used as an alternative to rhyme in verse.  &nbsp;  * Chiasmus  - an inverted relationship between the syntactic elements of parallel phrases (as in Goldsmith's  to stop too fearful, and too faint to go ).&nbsp; (Lou Ann's note:&nbsp; this term seems to indicate a crossing over ... I'm going to look into it further.)  &nbsp;  * Illustration  - an example or instance that helps make something clear.  &nbsp;  * Analogy  - (1): inference that if two or more things agree with one another in some respects they will probably agree in others; (2) a: resemblance in some particulars between things otherwise unlike: SIMILARITY; &nbsp;b: comparison based on such resemblance; (3): correspondence between the members of pairs or sets of linguistic forms that serves as a basis for the creation of another form. &nbsp; * Anthropomorphism  - an interpretation of what is not human or personal in terms of human or personal characteristics. &nbsp; I must give credit where credit is due.&nbsp; I found these definitions on the  urlLink Mirriam-Webster  website, which I use quite frequently in most of my writing/typing, be it personal or professional.

      Had a great weekend this weekend.  After buying the new lens and working with the awesome conductor, I had company from Buffalo on Sunday.  We drove around Northern VA a bit, walked on the Mount Vernon trail near Roosevelt Island, and went to see the movie Chicago (what a great movie!!)  More later....

      Oops ... haven't updated for a while.  Sorry!!  I've had lots going on.  I had the opportunity to play in an orchestra (for $$!! believe it or not!!)  and have been driving to and from Fredricksburg several times this week.  That's all done now (concert was tonight).  I had a GREAT time.  The conductor was the composer, and was wonderful.  It was a blast!!  I also bought a zoom lens today.  I hope to go out and play with it some time in the next several days.  :-)  I'll write more later.

      Okay ... I have a question for anyone out there who might be reading this blog!!  What 35mm film would you recommend for this trip to Alaska?  Or can you point me out to a website, etc. that could recommend film for me?  I am frustrated with this decision because I know that slide film is the best choice for landscapes, but I will most likely want prints of everything I take pictures of ... and want to use print film.  I also don't know that I ought to be purchasing loads of rolls of slow film (ASA 100 or even 50), which would be great for long exposures with a tripod, but what if an eagle flies through my next shot ... then I'll wish I had ASA 400 loaded ... so should I go with the inbetween stuff?  I really don't like 200 speed film ... but .... but .... but .........

      Hello!!  Quick note tonight ... I'm exhausted and have LOTS to do.  But I wanted to let you know that I have made reservations for our ferry travels in the inside passage.  :-)  YAY!!  Next, I'll be looking for places that will likely require hotel/motel reservations.  Some of the smaller, more remote cities only have a certain number of hotel rooms, and once they're gone, they're gone.  And, if you miss the last boat out, you don't have a place to sleep.  We don't want that, now, do we?  ;-)

      Woo hoo!  I'm totally stoked!!  I have finally made some reservations for Alaska.  I have definitely decided to travel north from Fairbanks ... on a 3 day tour to Prudhoe Bay and the Arctic Ocean.  I'll be north of the Arctic Circle, and will see the Yukon River.  YAY!!  I will also be spending a couple of nights at a roadhouse deep inside the Denali National Park.  Hopefully we'll see the peak (although it's rather unlikely!) and, weather permitting, maybe I can do some hiking and horseback riding.  We're on our way!!!!!!!!!!  :-D

      Wow ... they really don't make Saturdays long enough!!  I was up at 6:00 this morning to start working on errands and stuff around the house, etc.  It is now 9:00 p.m., and I just "quit".  I'm not quite done with what I wanted done ... but am satisfied that I did a LOT of "work".  One of the things that I did that I'm rather proud of ... I installed a new toilet.  From scratch.  Put in a new water supply valve and everything.  Now I have to check it for a couple of days to make sure that the seal isn't leaking.  So far so good.  Have a very happy Easter weekend ... HE IS RISEN INDEED!!

      Hello, all!!!  (okay ... hello to the one or two of you who actually read my blog...)  :-D  Unlike my friend, Kate, I had no exciting haircut experience today to tell you about.  I got up early and out of the house early, only to arrive at the DMV 45 minutes before they open without the papers that I needed.  SOOOO.... I got back on the road, drove home, got the papers, and got back to DMV to be about 100 people farther back in line (still 5 minutes before they were to open).  Finally, TWO AND A HALF HOURS later, I finished there.  Well, at least I sat and read a LOT about efficient packing (with my Alaska trip in mind)  .....  (yes ... I have a BOOK about efficient packing!!)  .....  (no, Mom, I didn't have this book before the last time I fllew to Buffalo!)  :-D  The rest of my day was boring ... running errands, etc.  BLAH, BLAH, BLAH.   BUT ... the bright spot in my day was a yummy lunch with a very dear friend who I don't often get to have lengthy chats with.  YAY!!  We had a very nice time (and I got to have LAMB gyro.  I LOVE lamb!!)  Now I've got "around the house" stuff to do, and hopefully will be able to be sitting down with my quilt in time to watch my TWO taped episodes of CSI from earlier in the week while working on my quilt.

      Okay ... the rain wasn't at all bad.  In fact, the areas where the forecast was "freezing rain" had no precip. at all.  The only rain I hit was for about an hour through the Harrisburg area.  It wasn't bad at all.  I'm now back in DC ... unpacking, checking e-mail, making lists of things "to do" for the next two days, and trying to get all done with all of the above before I click on Survivor (where I'll be hoping that they vote Heidi or Jenna off) and CSI (!!!!).    I'm also uploading changes I've made to  urlLink my website  over the past week.  Check it out.  :-)  I added new pictures of my nephew, updated my Alaska site, my main page and my  Road Tripping site.  Enjoy!!

      Howdy folks!!  I'm driving back to DC today.  I figured that I'd try to find the rainiest, ickiest day ... and spend that entire day driving through the mountains of Pennsylvania.  LOL!!  Doesn't it figure.  They're even supposed to be having freezing rain for about the first 4 hours of my drive.     Two random thoughts: First of all ... one final note about the birthday party.  Another benefit of attending a one-year-old birthday party is that I now know what WIGGLES is!!!  Wa-hoo!!  I've seen them on TV twice now since!!  ;-) Secondly ... I got to have BEEF ON WECK while I was here!!  Truly a Buffalo specialty.

      What happened to my comments?  They've disappeared?     Oh, well ... I'll have to look into that later.  Sorry you can't comment right now folks (I know, I know ... you're falling all over yourselves waiting to comment on my blog.  Just hold your horses!!)  I feel a lot better about knowing the different driving times and distances that we'll be looking at for this trip this summer.  I sat down last night and really did a day-by-day itinerary that I think will be rather close to actual driving times.  Now I still need to decide about the trip up north.  I'm looking at  urlLink this website , and will check today to see what others are out there.  If you go to that site ... look at the trip that combines both driving and flying to/from Prudhoe Bay.  Interesting, huh?  Today we're going to visit my aunt who's in a nursing home, and another aunt who lives down the street from her.  I'm sure I'll be on later.  :-)

      Finally!!  I stopped at AAA this morning and got information about the driving hours between Billings, MT and Jasper, AB.  NOW I know where I'll need to make reservations and how many driving days I should expect.  Whew!!  Lunch this afternoon with family friends.  YUM!!

      Wow!!  I missed a day.  Isn't that interesting!!  LOL!!  That's because there wasn't much going on.  I drove from my brother's house to my mother's house.  (That trip, by the way, takes me through my old alma mater, SUNY Geneseo.  Memories....)  Then Mom and I ran some errands, and then we watched a couple of episodes of CSI that she has taped (yup - I got her hooked!!)  Who knows ... today may be more interesting.  :-D

      Okay ... so I haven't been to many 1-year-old birthday parties in my life.  Whoo!  Lots of little kids ... and they all seem to melt down simultaneously!!  ;-)  It was fun, though, and my nephew seemed to have a great time (he didn't follow the melt-down trend!!)    THEN ... we rented "8 Mile" (after Ian went to bed).  What a good movie!!!  (Somebody tell Melen!)  I must say that I really liked it.  Surprise, surprise.  Doesn't make me want to listen to his music.  But it was a movie worth watching.  Haven't gotten much more done as far as reservations for Banff or Jasper yet.  I'll have to work on that tomorrow.  I'm trying to figure out how many hours it will take to drive from Billings to Jasper.  There seem to be problems at one or the other of mapquest.com and maps.yahoo.com.  The distance from Billings, MT to Calgary, AB is about 650 miles ... both websites agree on that.  THEN ... mapquest says that the driving TIME is about 18 hours.  EIGHTEEN!!??  Yahoo quotes the driving time as ten hours.  Now ... I realize that some of this is mountain driving.  But ... eighteen hours?  And mapquest is supposed to be more reliable.  What do I do.  I can't make reservations for a place that I can't possibly get to in a day of driving.  And ... I don't want to get stuck sleeping in my car because my reservations are for the next night and Banff and Jasper are too full to just get a room when you arrive there.  UGH!!  I guess I'm off to AAA this week.  Hope that Western NY AAA will accept my Potomac membership for the trip-tik.    Later!!

      Nothing much to write today.  ;-)  I'm having a relaxed day with my students and am leaving right after school for my brother's house in Elmira (actually Big Flats) New York for my nephew's first birthday party (tomorrow).  Then, on Sunday, it will be shuffling off to Buffalo for the rest of the week.  :-D

I hope I'll have more to say tomorrow.  Meanwhile, I continue to read about trips that go north of Fairbanks.  I'm also reading about driving through the Canadian Rockies.  Does anyone want to tell me about Banff or Jasper?

      Okay ... I'm still working on my  urlLink trip planning for Alaska  (you'll hear that probably every day until I leave!)  But right now, I'm trying to decide whether or not to accept the expense of travelling north of Fairbanks.  Like to go past the Arctic Circle and to see the Arctic Ocean and possibly tour the oil company at Prudhoe Bay, AK.  What are your thoughts about that?  :-D

      Weekends are WAYYY too short.  :-)  First of all, Mom.  She had another little "episode" this morning.  We were worried about her, but the doctor said that she should just keep an eye on it.  She feels a lot better now.  I'm making sure I talk with her once a day or so.  I also spent a good amount of time today working on researching my  urlLink upcoming trip to Alaska .  It's going to be a blast!!  We've almost set an itinerary.  There are only a couple of minor details to work out, and we'll be ready to make real reservations.  Well ... on with the "getting-to-bed-early" part of the weekend.  Hope yours was good, too.  :-D

I think that I forgot to put the end quote on the html script.  Duh!!  It's time to set the clocks ahead and go to sleep.

      Well ... another Saturday, and I don't feel like I've gotten much done.  I mean, I rearranged my living room, but that wasn't as vital a task as some others that I needed to be doing.  The goal for the rest of the week will be to have the car packed by Friday morning, and be ready to leave for New York straight from school on Friday afternoon.  Talked with Mom this afternoon, and she's sounding lots better.  Don't forget to visit  urlLink my website !!  Enjoy the rest of your weekend!!

What a beautiful thing it is every year to see the Cherry Blossoms!!  Spring has sprung, huh?  I'm not sure what my commute will be like this morning.

      Just in case any one is checking ... Mom's surgery went "okay".  There was a buildup of fluid at the incision that was alarming, so the doctor took her back into surgery.  Once that was fixed, she was in a LOT less pain, and is coming along quite well.  Thanks for the prayers!!

      Howdy!!  (For all ya'll up north, that basically means, "good morning.")  Uck!!  I was late to work this morning ... actually I was ON TIME to leave to get here in time to have an hour and a half to grade papers AND get other things done in my classroom.  Then I had a severe nose bleed, and thus got stuck in the later morning rush hour traffic.  BLAH!!  THEN ... I had another, and missed my homeroom.  I hate my nose.  ;-p  Anyway ... mom's surgery is today.  About noon.  I won't hear until later in the afternoon or early evening.  Just thought you might like to know......

      Woo hoo!!  It's FRIDAY!!  And ... I have a dilemma!!  My friend and colleague, Kate, insists that I have to NAME my cars (I recently purchased an SUV, and have decided to keep my "little" car for commuting purposes) because it's too boring/confusing talking about "the little car" and "the SUV".  (It doesn't help that they're both Nissans!!)   But I'm not coming up with any decent names.  THUS ... the car naming contest!!  Please leave a comment (yes - ulterior motives!!) giving me ideas for the names of my two babies.  ;-)  By the way ... if you'd like a visual idea of what they look like, you can find pictures of both autos at:   urlLink  my road tripping website .  By the way ... I want to point you, again, to a GREAT website.  There is this couple of East Coast born & raised, city kids who are making a road trip that is similar to the one I made two summers ago.  Their writing is a RIOT, and I SOOOO identify with them because they sound a LOT like me in their reactions to being "out west".  You'll have to check out their  urlLink online travelogue !!  So ... remember to opinionate at me about naming my cars ... and don't forget to read about Rick & Jen's road trip!!!  Have a great weekend!!!

      What a rainy weekend.  We moved our "Picnic with the Pops" concert inside (even though the couple of hours during the concert were some of the nicest weather all weekend ... 71 degrees and blue skies ... but the field was under water still).  The venue was PACKED (seated about 790, standing room ALL AROUND the outside of the auditorium  IN FACT ... a lot of the people who weren't there in time to even get into the theater stood for over an hour in the lobby and just listened.  What fun!!  There was a group of Marines from Quantico and a group of Veterans from a local American Legion post who presented colors at the beginning of the concert.  We played the obligatory (and AWESOME) patriotic tunes:  Stars & Stripes Forever, America the Beautiful, When Johnny Comes Marching Home, Star Spangled Banner, etc.  And we played a BUNCH of "USO" numbers:  Boogie Woogie Bugel Boy, a Duke Ellington suite, In the Mood, St. Louis Blues, a Big Band suite (with Sing, Sing, Sing ... my fave!!), etc.  AND ... Sarah and Melanie and I (our Fredericksburg carpool) went to Taco Bell BEFORE and AFTER the concert!!!!!  YUMMMMM!!!!!  The rest of my holiday weekend was spent half-vegetating and half-working around the house.  Part of me wonders if I'll ever be ready to leave for Alaska ... but on D-Day (June 28), it will not be a problem any more.  I'll just have to take what I have and make due for the rest.  :-)  Oh - and ... another thing that I did this weekend ... helped a friend plan her first (alone) road trip!!  :-)  She's been wanting to see the Adirondack's ... and has about 10 days that she can take off this summer.  She also wanted to see Niagara Falls, so we worked out a schedule for her to do some scenic driving, and then spend a couple of days in the upstate NY region ... and then a drive along Lake Ontario, and then a couple of days in Niagara Falls.  :-D  In the meantime, you'll have to check out this website:   urlLink http://www.uptoolate.com/rick/roadtrip2003/  ... which is where a couple is moving from Boston to Los Angeles.  They contacted me and told me that they had read my website while researching their trip, and loved it.  They're on the road currently, and updating their site almost every day.  They even drove through (and MENTIONED!) the town of Cheektowaga!!!  Go figure!!  :-)  It's amazing that one would actually end up driving THROUGH Cheektowaga (I didn't realize that Cheektowaga was on the way to anywhere!!)  Anyway ... check out Jen and Rick's website ... their trip is making me even more anxious for my own.  :-)

      Good morning.  Not much to talk about this week.  We finished our list of places to make our reservations ... and now Dianna is calling to make those reservations.  We had a "poetry cafe" with our students at school last night.  It was a lot of fun!!  This weekend will be split between catching up with some friends, our concert (and rehearsals) in Fredericksburg, and working on Alaska stuff.  :-)  Don't forget to check out  urlLink my website .

That gives me time to do things like ... work!  :-)  Oh ... and did I mention that I finally bought that rain jacket.  I really like it.  It has zippers in the seems on the sides (up into the insides of the arms) so that if you get hot, you can give yourself some venting.  LOL!!  We gave the Virginia Math 8 SOL test today.  We'll have to wait for a month or two to find out how the kids did.  I'll be waiting on pins and needles.

      Good Monday  morning folks!!  :-)  I had a very nice weekend!!  Last night I had a rehearsal for a Memorial Day concert that I'll be playing the French horn in.  This is going to be a WAY FUN concert ... it's all "World War II era music" ... meaning, patriotic music and then LOTS of swing and big band music.  In the Mood, Duke Ellington, Glenn Miller, Boogie Woogie Bugel Boy, Sing Sing Sing, and so on.  If you're interested ... it's going to be a great concert.   urlLink Check out their website.   You won't regret coming out!!  Okay ... off to work on preparing my students for the SOL tests.  :-)  Please make sure you re-read my post for Tuesday, May 13.

      TITLE:  THE MOTHER'S DAY CARD SAGA!!!!!  I can't believe it.  Of all years for my mother to get her mother's day card ... it would NEED to be this year!!!!!  The saga goes something like this:  First ... about 3 weeks ago, I went to the Hallmark store and bought several cards that I had been needing to get.  I then went to the Mother's Day card section, and read almost every card, and picked the NICEST card that they had there.  I paid for my merchandise and went home.  When I got home, I realized that I had taken the Mother's Day card and NOT THE ENVELOPE.  (DUH!!)  I wonder ... if the girl at the counter was pulling the cards out of the flap of the envelopes for the other cards I had purchased, and when she got to the Mother's Day card, WHY didn't she say to me, "Oh, did you not take an envelope on purpose?"  Well, I hate shopping, so I refused to go back to the mall (where that Hallmark shop was located) to find out if I could get an envelope from them.  UGH!!  Second:  About 2 weeks ago, I found an equally nice card at Giant and picked it up while I was grocery shopping.  I wanted to make sure that Mom got the card in plenty of time, so I made sure that it went in the mail about a week ago.  I had taken it to school, and didn't have a return address stamp with me, so I hand-wrote my address in the top corner, and then wrote my mother's address and put the stamp on it, and mailed it in our main office.  Done!  (NOT!!)  Third:  On Thursday, in my mailbox at home, was my Mother's Day card, "Return to Sender" and "No such street address."  Double DUH!!  I had mailed it to her street address, but MY town, state and zip code (it was in my head after writing my own address in the top corner!!)  Can you believe that!?  Well, I REALLY wanted my mother to get her card on time, and so I crossed out the wrong town, state and zip, and used black permanent marker to write the correct ones, and put a white label over the old, postmarked stamp.  I decided to get up REALLY early on Friday morning (4:15 a.m.) to beat the rush hour traffic, I left my house by 5:15 a.m. and drove across town to the big post office "hub" at Merrifield.  They can often get things to Buffalo over night, so I figured that if the card was in the first batch of mail, it might have a chance of making it to Mom in Saturday's mail.  Maybe not!!  Finally:  I just got home from church and some errands.  I hadn't gone outside at all yesterday in the yucky weather, so I picked up my mail on the way in the house.  Don't you know ... the card was in my mailbox again.  AARRGGHHH!!!!  This time, I can't figure out what was wrong, except that I hadn't crossed out the "return to sender" and "no such street" stamps on the front of the card.  I give up!!  Mom - I love you!!  There's a Hallmark e-card waiting for you in your e-mail.  Enjoy!!  I'll call you later!!

      Howdy!!  I spent most of today working on my Alaska trip.  I'm more excited about this by the day.  My next quest is to find a backpack that will fill several rolls:  first, to fit most of the stuff that I would want to take with me on any of our overnight side trips (like 2 weeks in the inside passage) as well as going into our other hotels daily.  And ... it would be wonderful if it had a detachable day pack for carrying along in the car, etc.  I think I've found one.  I'll let you know.  :-)

      Sorry - I've not been good at keeping up with my blog this week.  I've been scolded by several folks.  Interesting that people actually read this!  :-)  Really ... haven't been up to much.  Trying to catch up with some friends, and have gone out for dinner several times this week (such is the life!)  The most recent was Thai food last night.  LOVE Thai food!!!!  As far as my Alaska trip ... I have come closer to finalizing the important parts of the itinerary (I think).  I hate having to set exact dates to be in certain places.  The last cross country trip I took, I would just drive into whatever town that I got tired in, and get a place to stay.  Nothing was planned more than a few minutes ahead of time.  This time, I have to make reservations for a LOT of the places that we want to stay.  It makes me uncomfortable because ... what if the car breaks down or we get stopped up for some reason a few weeks before the reservations are set for ... then we get all behind.  Ugh!!  I'll just have to live with it.    Anyway ... I think that the next several things that I'll need to do in getting ready for the trip involve shopping for things that need to come with me.  I need to decide on a back pack that I will consider using as my main luggage as we travel by ferry for two weeks ... I'm hoping to find a pack that has a detachable day pack, so that I can use that as a "fanny pack" for day-to-day stuff throughout the entire trip.  I also need to get a rain jacket that can also be a wind breaker.  I think I want something with a zip-in liner because the weather in the Inside Passage can be downright cold and most definitely will be WET.  So ... back pack and rain jacket are on my list of things to do.  :-)  Have a wonderful day!!  I'll try to keep this up to date more regularly!!  :-D

      Hey, ya'll!!  I have a new obsession.  Someone please help me (because the geography teachers I work with can't answer this question for me ... and they won't even help point me in the right direction!!)  I want to figure out where the Continental Divide's Eastern side changes from Atlantic drainage to Arctic drainage.  My geography colleagues told me, "don't know, don't care."  (HAH!)

      Howdie!!  Just a quick note to let you know that I am going away for awhile.  Yes ... I'll be in the great land of Alaska.  I'll be gone for two months, and will probably not use my vacation time to update this blog.  SOOOO.... if you're interested in reading about my trip (I may even post some pictures), you can go to  urlLink my Alaska website  to check it out.  Otherwise, you'll just have to miss me until the end of August.  Tee hee!  Have a GREAT summer!!  :-)

      Oops ... Tammy reminded me that I haven't said anything about my computer in my Blog.  Well ... it's mostly fixed.  By "mostly", I mean that I got a new hard drive (with 10 extra gig's included), but that we weren't able to save all of the files from the old one.  I also got a new keyboard and a new battery, so I believe that I'm good to go to Alaska.  :-)    I'll post again before I go.  :-D  I can't wait!!!!!!!

      Hey!!  I know, I know ... it's been WAY too long since I have "really" updated my blog.  [sigh]  Guess what!?  My computer (my laptop ... my home computer ... my right arm) died last week Saturday (June 7).  UGH!!  Well, "they" replaced the bad hard drive with another, bigger hard drive.  Unfortunately, the jury is still out as to whether "they" will be able to save the data that was on the old hard drive.  UGH ... UGH!!!  Of course, the stuff that might be lost is (1)  all of my Alaska planning (itineraries, to-do lists, information for the house sitter, etc.); (2)  lots of stuff from my e-mail files (like any and all e-mails that I ever got from my father ... e-mails from the friend that I'm going to Alaska with, etc.);  (3)  other stuff that I really want!!  UGH ... UGH ... UGH!!!!!!!  I'll update more when I know more.  On a more cheerful note ... my friend Kate's blog pointed me out to this  urlLink Geek Test  that is really funny.  You should look through it ... or take the test if you have time!!  :-D  I am 34% geek.  Can you believe that!!??  I still don't get WHY watching the special features on a DVD is a geeky thing to do!!  Hmmm....

      Just a quick note (might be my last for the week)....  Our middle school team is having a CAR WASH at Jefferson Middle School on Saturday (6/7) with the proceeds split to benefit the war in Iraq and the AIDS crisis in Africa.  Please come on out and give our kids an opportunity to wash your car!!  :-)  Jefferson Middle School is off of Glebe Road and South 2nd Street in South Arlington (you can  urlLink e-mail me  for directions!!)

      OK ... I switched to a high speed cable modem from dial up on Saturday.  For the past [??] years I have been using Eudora for my e-mail software.  But ... I can't get Eudora to work with my new cox.net settings.  SOOO.... since the cable company "told" me that they use MS Outlook (the word that THEY used was "supports"), I have decided that I will give in and use MS Outlook.  I've always avoided it because I know that a lot of e-mail viruses are written to affect Outlook.  ANYWAY ... I really DO NOT like Outlook.  The address book seems to make finding addresses MORE difficult than before ... and I can't even see the e-mail address if I use the "nickname" for the person.  AND ... if I have several nicknames that start with "Deb", it will give me the first one unless I type in EVERY SINGLE letter through the last name.  WHAT A HASSLE!!!!  AARRGGHH!!!  On a MUCH happier note ... I had lunch today with my mentee who is ABSOLUTELY AWESOME!!!!!!!!  Go Alex!!!  We ate sushi and talked about the first week or two of school.  She teaches ME things every time we talk.  Let's hear it for pink long johns.  ;-)

      Well ... another day of MEETINGS!!  ALL DAY!!  BUT ... I'm pretty much done with them for the week.  I mean ... I'll get together with my mentee at some point, and we have another SHORT staff breakfast/meeting.  But, for the most part ... I get to actually WORK for the rest of the week.  My room is mostly decorated (I think I've already said that.)  Now I get to plan.  I'm a bit on the fence about planning too far into the first month because plans ALWAYS have to be changed.  You can plan a day or a week or a month, and on the FIRST DAY, you find that you need to change just about the ENTIRE thing.  SOOOO....  I want to come up with semi-plans that are good for being changed as I go.  :-)  BLAH!!  Hope you're having a more interesting day than I am.  :-p

      Whew!!  My first "official" day in my classroom wasn't all that bad.  Breakfast provided by the administration team.  Meeting with the whole staff for a few hours.  Lunch ordered in from a favorite Chinese place with my team of teachers.  Meeting with the team after lunch ... which grew to include a couple of administrators.  Then we realized it was time to leave.  A day of meetings.  Hmmm....  Tomorrow is looking to be the same.  :-)

So now I can spend this coming week socializing, ... er ... um ... I mean ... I can spend this coming week working on planning and getting ready for the first day with students.  See, the teachers have a full week of "work/conference days" this coming week.  Then the students start the day after Labor Day.  Just for your information, I'll be spending labor day with my brother and sister-in-law and my nephew, Ian.   urlLink Would you like to see pictures of Ian?

      OK ... we're back at school today ... we have now officially used ALL of the snow days that were set aside for this school year.  Every other day we take will have to be made up at some point.     At least I got a lot done this weekend.  I found myself wondering how I would have gotten all of those things done that I got done if I hadn't had the two extra days.  And ... FYI, I only lost power for 14 hours, but had no dial tone or cell phone reception for almost 2 whole days.  I did manage to get some stitching done, as well as a good amount of reading.  Yeah.

      Me again!!  :-)  Here it is ... 7:00 a.m.  and I'm home ... no school today.  I doubt there will be school tomorrow.  I have extra food in case the refrigerator dies.  I have extra batteries for my radios and flashlights.  To my mother's horror I even have candles.  I even turned my fridge and freezer to the coldest settings so that the food will last longer if the power goes out.  I am working on finishing everything that I might need electricity to do (laundry, e-mail, update the blog, etc.)  I will finally (hopefully!) finish unpacking from  urlLink my trip to Alaska  (FINALLY!!)  I'm thinking about trying some before and after photographs to document the storm ( urlLink yes, I play at being a photographer ) and I'm watching the weather on the television.  I'm sure that there will be enough light in my bright living room & dining room during the daylight hours even if the power goes out to do some reading and stitching.  SOOOOO....  I should be all set to ride it out.  Oh ... and just to make sure we all understand this:  if we are out of school BOTH today AND tomorrow ... we will have used up ALL of our snow days.  That means that if there are other snow days during the school year (like in the winter actually!), we'll have to make up the days or the time later.  UGH!!!!!!!!!!!  I just heard on the news that the local governments in North Carolina made an eeire request of the residents of the Outer Banks who are defying the evacuation order:  They are to write their names on their forearms in permanent marker.  Eeesshhh!!!    And ... on that lovely note ... enjoy!!   urlLink Ride the storm out !!!  (Yeah, I'm a child of the 80's!!!!)

      OK ... so here we are ... less than 24 hours away from ISABEL!!  I love the maps that  urlLink The Weather Channel  has online.  Take a look through their maps!!  I also don't know yet if schools are closed or open (they'll decide by 6:00 and I have to leave before that for my rehearsal tonight ... so don't call or e-mail to ask me ... just go to  urlLink the APS website  to find out for yourself.  I'll see you tomorrow or Monday.  :-)  [Look for further blog comments later!!  ...  Well, unless the power goes out.  ;-)]

      Okay ... I know it's been a while since I've posted.  Sorry!  ;-)  We're in the middle of being warned (on a very regular basis) that we are in the direct path of hurricane Isabel, regardless of what path she takes (does THAT make any sense at all??)  We've been told to prepare for up to seven (SEVEN!) days without power.  Yup ... so when my mom asked if I had enough flashlights in my condo, and I said "Yes, and I also have lots of candles" she freaked because she's convinced I'll burn my house down one day with all of my candles ("I've been reading the statistics on that you know!")  SOOOO ... I have purchased enough tuna fish and crackers to get me through about seven days (okay ... I LIKE tuna fish, but after seven days of it, I'd have to re-think my preferences!) and tonight I plan to go to my favorite fabric store ( urlLink G Street Fabrics ) and get the rest of the fabric I need to finish the quilt top that I'm making ... and I should be all set to stitch by the light of whatever daylight comes in my windows when the power is out and we don't have school.  (Yeah, it'll be fun using up both of our TWO allotted snow days before the end of September!!)  AND ... all of this MAY NOT EVEN HAPPEN!!  (Bring it on,  urlLink Isabel !!)

      I HAVE THE AWESOMEST FAMILY IN THE WHOLE WORLD!!!!  I spent the weekend with my brother, Karl, and his wife, Danielle, and their son,  urlLink Ian .  They always treat me like ROYALTY when I visit them.  We have so much fun ... delicious food ... more coffee than I'd ever drink in a 3 day time-frame ... fun games (rummy, scattergories, phase 10...) ... watched "Entrapment" on TV ... ate yummy brownies ... had ICE CREAM ... I got to babysit ... we almost went miniature golfing ... and my sister-in-law packs the best lunches for long car rides!!!  It was GREAT!!!  Now, I have a question for you.  Regarding the game of Scattergories, I have questions about two "answers" that became "issues".  First was in the category "sports teams", the letter was "S" and the answer was "San Francisco Giants".  What do you think (click "comment" below to let me know!)??  The second was the category "things you find at a football game", the letter was "E", and the answer was "Engineers".  Again, comment to let me know what you think.  :-)  Anyway ... to top off all of this warm, fuzzy, family stuff ... when we were outside at one point playing with Ian in the sunshine, I look up to find my brother with a hose, long handled brush, and bucket working on my car.  (I still hadn't had a chance to get it washed after coming back from Alaska.  The dirt must have been a half an inch thick!!)  He wrote it off by saying that he didn't want my dirty, ugly car in his driveway.  He just didn't want to admit that he's a great guy!!  :-)

      The request has come in for the lyrics to the WHOLE Miss Piggy song.  OK ... so ... here goes:  Stars shining bright above you; Night breezes seem to whisper &#24918; love you? Birds singing in the sycamore tree. Dream a little dream of me.  Say nighty-night and kiss me; Just hold me tight and tell me you'll miss me. While I'm alone, blue as can be, Dream a little dream of me.  Stars fading but I linger on, dear--- Still craving your kiss. I'm longing to linger till dawn, dear, Just saying this...  Sweet dreams till sunbeams find you--- Sweet dreams that leave all worries behind you. But in your dreams, whatever they be, Dream a little dream of me.  Stars fading but I linger on, dear--- Still craving your kiss. I'm longing to linger till dawn, dear, Just saying this...  Sweet dreams till sunbeams find you--- Sweet dreams that leave all worries far behind you. But in your dreams, whatever they be, Dream a little dream of me.

I am NOT available to watch the game at 4:15.  I NEVER get to see Buffalo Bills games living in DC.  This will be the FIRST game that I could have watched this season.  BUT NO!!

I have spent my days since the hurricane getting my house ready for a visit from my mom and a close family friend ... cleaning and picking up ... and unpacking from my trip (YES!  I am still unpacking.)  They will be arriving this evening at BWI airport.  And ... don't ya' know that our Back to School night, originally scheduled for the day that the hurricane hit ... has been rescheduled for TONIGHT.  Well, I have an absolutely WONDERFUL friend Nancy ("NanKay") who has agreed to pick my mom and Aunt Carol up IN BALTIMORE!!  (THANK YOU NANKAY!!!)  We'll be visiting  urlLink Monticello , Old Town Alexandria, going to see  urlLink Shear Madness  at the Kennedy Center, and hopefully work in a visit to Old Town Alexandria and a night time tour of the monuments.  (AND ... probably we'll eat a LOT!!)  MMMMMMMMMMM..............

      Fascinating!!  Yes ... that's my word for most days.  Here's my example for today's educational fascination:  We were told earlier this week that there would be a national news film crew at  urlLink our school .  We were told that they wanted film footage of 8th grades classes, and our principal asked for any 8th grade teachers who were interested to allow the cameras into their classrooms to "roll".  SO ... as I had been teaching a fun lesson last week, I decided to CHANGE what I was planning to do today and re-teach the lesson from last week.  It was a lesson that involved lots of manipulatives and group work, etc.  SOOOO.... near the end of the class period that was supposed to be my "filming" period (remember that I changed my lessons for the whole day to accomodate this!), my principal comes into my room and  tells me that they were running out of time.  Later, my principal comes to me and tells me (get this!) that the real problem was this:  the film crew had walked past my room and looked in.  They saw the kids working in groups and working with manipulatives and decided that they didn't want THAT on film.  In fact, my principal explained to them that this approach to learning math is widely accepted as being much more effective.  The film crew then informed her that, even though the research proves that manipulatives help students learn, "THE PUBLIC" don't agree with that, and don't want to see that sort of thing on the TV.  I asked my principal if it would have been better if I had been giving notes on the overhead projector (what I was planning to do today anyway), and she implied that we might have been filmed if that had been the case.  UGH!!  What does "THE PUBLIC" think about this issue?????  You MUST let me know!!

      Okay ... so if you've never thought of me as the obsessive/compulsive type, you don't know me very well.  I've been all over the internet looking at artists who've recorded "Dream a Little Dream of Me."  Mama Cass, of course, but more recently a duet recorded by Tony Bennett and K.D. Lang.  Well, I bought the latter album this afternoon.  It's awesome!!  I highly recommend you buy it!!  Maybe NOW I'll stop hearing Miss Piggy saying "AYYYYY YAH!!" in the middle of each verse!!  :-)

      I won't be updating my Blog until after the holidays (most likely, anyway).  But, I wanted to leave you all with a thought from one of the songs from our cantata.  In my mind and heart, it sums up the beautiful and universal message of the Christmas Season ... as well as the heart of my daily ministry!!  Merry Christmas to all!!  Some children see Him lily white, The Baby Jesus born this night, Some children see Him lily white, With tresses soft and fair.  Some children see Him bronzed and brown, The Lord of heav'n to earth come down; Some children see Him bronzed and brown, With dark and heavy hair.  Some children see Him almond-eyed, This Savior whom we kneel beside, Some children see Him almond-eyed, With skin of yellow hue.  Some children see Him dark as they, Sweet Mary's Son to whom we pray, Some children see Him dark as they, And, ah! they love Him, too!  The children in each diff'rent place Will see the Baby Jesus' face Like theirs, but bright with heav'nly grace, And filled with holy light.  O lay aside each earthly thing, And with thy heart as offering, Come worship now the Infant King. 'Tis love that's born tonight!

      Okay ... here's another example of ME being a victim of a random and anonymous act of kindness.  Our Christmas cantatas started on Wednesday.  We have 7 concerts in 5 days.  Whew!!  On Friday evening, I came into the auditorium about a half hour before the concert, as usual.  Sitting on my music stand was a cute little foil-wrapped Hershey's chocolate, just waiting for me.  :-)  I figured that someone must love the orchestra, so I looked around to see if everyone else had gotten a little, foil-wrapped Hershey's chocolate.  Nope .... just me.  :-D  Somebody must love me!!  :-D  Whaddya know!!  Of course, I had to wait until AFTER the concert to EAT my little, foil-wrapped Hershey's chocolate.  SOOOO....  to the person who cleaned off my car ... and to the person (the same person?) who left me a little, foil-wrapped Hershey's chocolate.  THANK YOU!!!!!!!

      Yup ... I may as well be in Buffalo THIS week ... 20-something degrees out every day.  UGH!!  Anyway ... here's a cool "human interest" story.  It snowed overnight on Thursday into Friday, and again on Friday into Saturday.  Now, I have two cars ... an SUV that I take on road trips and when the weather is bad, and a little, incredibly gas efficient hatchback that I love to drive around town and for normal commuting.  So ... when I got up to go to my rehearsal on Saturday morning, I scraped the ice and snow off of my SUV and took off at about 8:00.  After the rehearsal and several errands later, I arrived back home around 3:00 or 4:00 in the afternoon.  As I drove through my parking lot, I noticed that all of the cars that had not been moved since before the snow hit were still quite covered.  So, as I pulled into my parking lot section, I looked for my little blue hatchback under a pile of snow.  GET THIS PART!!  Someone had not only brushed the snow off of my car, but had scraped the windows bone clean.  I was amazed!!  There were lots of other cars that needed cleaning, but some kind soul did mine.  I have absolutely NO IDEA who it was.  The likely culprits (a wonderful upstairs neighbor couple) insisted that they didn't do it, and I don't really know anyone else around here.  I can't imagine who ... so, in lieu of thanking him/her, I am putting this in my blog so that you can get a good idea about maybe doing the same sort of anonymous favor for someone else!!  :-)  Go for it!!  By the way ... our Substitute Teacher Assignment Network at school is named S.T.A.N.  (get it ... SSSSubstitute TTTTeacher AAAAssignment NNNNetwork!!??)  There was a huge piece of paper on my front seat that I put there as a reminder.  It said, "Call STAN!!!" in big letters.  Whoever it was that was cleaning my car could NOT have missed seeing that piece of paper.  They must be thinking now that I have a wonderful man in my life named STAN.  LOL!!  I assure you that I don't!!  HAHAHAHAHA!!!

      OK ... back to the movies.  Today I saw "Mona Lisa Smile" (I had to ... it was a teacher movie!)  The movie was good, but not great ... I'm glad that I saw it.  Well, there was one scene in that movie that was absolutely fabulous.  There was a character in that movie, in that particular scene, who was written with an amazing strength of character.  I only hope that I could be so strong.  She learned something about one of her classmate's personal life.  This other classmate was berating her publicly (and mercilessly, I might add!) ... and her response was to embrace the other girl until she stopped berating her and broke down in tears.  An amazing example of grace.  Absolutely wonderful!  My favorite part of a movie is when a character chooses the way more honorable, even though to choose the other way would be completely understandable and chosen by 99% of the other good people out there.  This was that!  :-)  Go see to movie to know what I'm talking about!!

      Welcome back to my blog!!!    My Christmas gift to myself was the newest version of Adobe Photoshop, version "cs" (photo editing software).  It will probably take me about seventeen years to learn how to use it (just in time to see my nephew graduate from highschool!) ... but in the meantime, you can follow my growth in the endeavor by following my  urlLink portfolio  on photo.net.    My friend Alex's Christmas gift to HERself an even BETTER one!!  She got herself a Toyota Prius ... one of those new hybrid cars.  It's AWESOME!!!  It's like driving your computer.  Really!  You don't turn the key in the lock, you just walk toward the car with the key in your hand, and it unlocks itself when you touch the door.  You don't turn the key in the ignition, you push "Power" and it turns on and off.  The gear shift is more like a joy stick.  AND ... there's a computer screen on the dash with all of the pertinent information (like gas mileage and radio stations, etc.)  WOW!!!!!!  Hope your holidays were wonderful!  Feel free to leave comments telling me about them!!  :-D  HAPPY NEW YEAR!!!!!

      So ... I have been ORDERED to update my blog.  So ... here I go.  It's not that I don't WANT to update my blog ... it's just that I have difficulty finding things to write about.  Now, if you KNOW me ... you KNOW that I NEVER have difficulty finding things to TALK about.  My problem is that this is a "general viewing audience", and I want to keep my opinions toned down when I blog.  Thus ... some of the things that I would otherwise comment on in this forum will be left unsaid.  Or ... it may just be that I have no life.  "NO LIFE!!??" you may say.  Yes ... you know HOW I can PROVE to you that I have no life ... here's what I am looking forward to this week.  This week, the last week of February, I am looking forward to coming back to school on Monday, 3/1, and changing all three of my classroom calendars.  I try to keep myself from looking ahead at what the next month's pictures are going to be.  Then, on the first school day of every month, I am overjoyed to see what's new.  I have one calendar that is all pictures of eagles in Alaska (our "team" here at school is the "Eagles") and they are GORGEOUS pictures.  The second is a calendar that my wonderful sister-in-law made for me with all pictures of my nephew,  urlLink Ian .  The third is a calendar of pictures that I made for myself and for some of my friends with pictures that I took  urlLink when I was in Alaska this summer .  So there!  Consider me updated!!  :-)

      WOW!  Now even my MOTHER is calling me a blog-slacker.  OK, so maybe she didn't use those exact words ... but she certainly pointed out to me that she is disappointed that looking at my blog recently only talks about changing my calendars to the March pictures.  (Which are wonderful, by the way!)  Mom said that I should blog about the concert that I played with the  urlLink Rappahannock Pops Orchestra  on March 6.  It was a blast ... we played all music from movies ... Chicago (my personal favorite), An American in Paris, My Fair Lady, Fiddler on the Roof, Over the Rainbow, Gonna Fly Now (the BEST brass piece I've played in a LONG time!), etc.  It was great fun, and we had a full house.  But, really, I want to blog today about a field trip that we took some students on yesterday.  We went to an event downtown called "Student Technology Roundtable" that had used roundtable participants who were winners of national awards in the areas of science and technology for young people.  The descriptions of their research and developments were fascinating.  As an educator, though, I came away from that day with something beyond that.  I was reminded that the essence of SCIENCE epitomizes the essence of EDUCATION ... or, better said, life-long learning.  To be a learner, you have to know how to ASK a QUESTION ... and then you have to know how to travel the road to answer your question.  So many students have no idea about QUESTION asking ... and I was reminded that I ought to be teaching them to ASK questions ... and not only concentrate on teaching them to ANSWER questions.  The reason that I don't update my blog more often is because I don't really realize that people read it.  If you DO read my blog, will you let me know ... comment here or call me at home or send me an e-mail or hire a sky-writer or something.  It's not worth the babbling time if it's just for me (because I babble to myself on a regular basis!!)  :-D

       Cicadas .  Yup ... they're coming.  That's what they tell us anyway.  This "Brood X" thing ... hasn't been seen since 1987.  I was in college then.  In New York State.  In a place where they don't have cicadas.  They tell us that, here in the DC area, there will be billions of them.  Yes ... that is "billions" with a BBBBBBBB.  Billions.  Supposedly, most of them will come out overnight on one night, when the soil temperature is perfect.  These things have lived in the ground for 17 years, they will emerge one night, spend some time in/on trees and other surfaces, mate, molt, and die.  Ugh!!  Exoskeletons and then dead locusts.  And, to add to it all, there will be the noise.  While they are attempting to attract cicadas of the opposite sex, they make noise.  It ought to be deafening.  There are already a small number of "early appearances", and some people have seen cicadas already.  This morning, one of my colleagues thought it would be much fun to have one of our students bring a cicada in a jar and leave it on my desk.  She (the student) named it "Bob".  When I got over the original "Yuck, this is gross" feeling, I spent the day showing Bob to all of my students.  Most of them think Bob is pretty disgusting, too.  At the end of the day, we let Bob go ... back into the wilderness that is Arlington County, VA.  I think that Bob was still in shock from having spent so many hours in a metal can, but he was going to die soon anyway ... right?  If you're wondering about this whole cicada thing, there is a website that bills itself as the  urlLink Official Cicada Watch for 2004 .  If you go to  urlLink Google , click on the "News" link, and type the search string "cicadas", there are hundreds of news articles about them, too.  Uck!!  I am imagining a cicada plague of Biblical proportions.  I can't even imagine what BILLIONS of cicadas are going to look like.  Bob was certainly ugly enough alone.  Imagine all of his closest family and friends coming for dinner and making lots of noise.  I think I'll stay inside.  No, I think I'll spend three weeks in Buffalo with my mother.  Get this ... my car doesn't have airconditioning, and my SUV's air conditioning is broken.  And the temps have been in the upper 80's.  That means that I'll be driving around for the next few days/weeks with my windows open.  The cicadas will fill my car.  Will I even be able to get in and out of the driver's seat?   Cicadas!!!!!!!!!

      Well, my house is starting to get back to what it was like before, with all of the furniture in its proper place.  Whew!!  I love my new bedroom, but it's going to require "getting used to" on my part.  I had a bad dream last night about sleeping on a mattress with hard metal springs sticking out of it into my back.  Please know that my new mattress set is very comfortable.  It's just not what I'm used to, so it will take some time.  What I  really  wanted to talk about here, today, is the book that I'm reading right now.  Several months ago some colleagues were talking about an author named Gregory Maguire and several books that he has written that are very popular now.  I'm not good at keeping up with THE popular books, so I had never heard of this.  But I looked into it, and the book I decided to start with is called:  _Wicked: The Life and Times of the Wicked Witch of the West_.  Well, I'm about halfway through the book at this point, and it's a riot.  It's not told in a "funny" way, but with dry, satirical humor.  It's truly the life story of the Wicked Witch of the West from the Wizard of Oz.  They start with her parents' horror as they discover that their new baby has green skin (can you imagine the scandal!?) and continues through her attending college (that's what I'm reading right now), where her roommate's name is "Glinda".  Hmmm...  Anyway, I look forward to seeing what other interesting things that he brings in.  For example, there are sections about her irrational fear of water, she has a sister whom she adores, and so on.  It's a lot of fun.  Some of this author's other titles are _Mirror, Mirror_ and _Confessions of an Ugly Step-sister_.  I've heard, though, that "Wicked" is the best.

       I'M DONE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!   Today I put the switchplates back on ... painted the moldings, window sill, and door frames ... and spent more time than I ought to have touching up the places where wall meets ceiling or molding.  That was rather amusing ... since I painted the walls blue and the ceiling and moldings/doorframes white, I found blue splots along the corners of the ceiling.  When I tried to fix the ceiling with white paint, I got white on the blue walls.  Then I took blue to fix the walls, and got more blue on the white ceiling.  You get the picture.  I finally quit ... decided to remember the Adult Bible Fellowship (adult Sunday school) lesson from yesterday about perfectionism (summary:  only God is perfect ... give it up!) and quit.    Quit ... done ... packed up the painting stuff ... threw out the garbage ... and turned my attention to everything else that I've been ignoring around my house for the past week.  Hmmph!!  :-)  So ... don't look for any more painting updates.  I will try to blog another time or two before I go out of town for the Fourth of July ... I'll be going to Las Vegas with a friend.  In the meantime, don't forget to look at pictures of  urlLink my new twin nephews (same pics that I posted about a week or so ago) .

      Whew ... home stretch!!!  :-)  First, I must say that my brother is right.  I probably shouldn't have taped.  Interesting!!  Way to go Karl ... I ought to listen to you more often!!  This morning I got up and figured that since the BOOKS said to wait until after the paint had dried before taking off the tape ... I knew that the paint would be dry and I decided to experiment with a little section of tape along the floor boards.  Panic city!!  I discovered that the paint seeped through the tape in MANY places.  Well ... I looked at the tape that I had put on the ceiling (with the intent of preserving the paint job I did THERE on Wednesday ... and which I thought was wonderful!)  Worse yet!!  Eeeeekkkkk!!!    Good thing that today's Sunday, and Sundays I go to church, and that I know a man in the orchestra who's like an EXPERT painter.  Thanks, Vern!!  Vern gave me great advice about what to do about those seepy parts.  He also verified what my brother said about not taping.  AND ... he said that if you DO tape, to take it off right away, while the paint is still wet.  Very interesting!!!  Well ... after church I went with a friend to see Shrek 2, and then I ran a bunch of errands (including yet another trip to Home Depot).  When I got home I ate a quick dinner and got to the task for today:  SPONGING one wall.  I wasn't sure what to expect with this adventure ... sponging ... but there's that BOOK, so I figured that I could do it.  Do you believe that it only took me about an hour or hour and a half to sponge an entire wall, including cleaning brushes, etc.  Cool!!  Let me tell you the key to sponging a wall:  music with a great beat!!  I didn't realize it until I did about half of the wall ... but I was sponging in time to the music.  :-)  Made for lots of cool sponge patterns.  My music of choice this evening was Stephen Curtis Chapman's album _Heaven in the Real World_ ... with songs like "King of the Jungle", etc.  Lots of be-bop to boogie to.    And I LOVE the way the wall looks!!!!  YAY!!  So ... tomorrow all I have to do is fix the seepy blue things on the ceiling and paint the moldings, etc.  And ... I will be DONE!!!!!!!  YAYAAAAAAAYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY!!!!!

      Do you remember those tests we took in high school ... the ones with questions like this:  "Hair is to head as ________________ is to chia pet" ... and you have to fill in the blank?  So here's one for you:  "a hatchback is to an SUV as a paint brush is to a _________________".  [tick tock tick tock tick tock ... time's up]  The answer:  _paint roller_.  Yup ... I feel that there is a considerable similarity to the contrasts you can draw between a hatchback vs. SUV and a paint brush vs. roller.  Now, many of you know that I own two cars, (1) a cute little hatchback ... 11 years old ... 190,000 miles ... seats really only me and one passenger ... virtually no storage space ... 40 mpg ... etc., and (2) an SUV ... 4 years old ... 75,000 miles ... seats me and four passengers ... lots of storage space ... 15 mpg ... etc.  You get the picture.  Now, if you know me a little bit better, you also know that I very much prefer driving my little hatchback.  Even when it's hot out, and the SUV has air conditioning and the hatchback doesn't ... I still drive the hatchback around town when I can because ... well ... I LIKE IT!!  But ... sometimes ... the SUV is just more practical ... for road trips and when I have to haul things or have lots of stuff or when the weather is bad.  Finally, the savings that I get for gas in the hatchback makes up for the extra costs involved with having two cars.  "Nough said?  Then, there are the two aforementioned painting instruments.  The paint brush ... smaller, makes uglier marks on the wall, yet seems to be much more efficient with the paint than the roller.  Then there's the paint roller ... larger, leaves the paint more smoothly on the wall, uses lots and lots of paint.  And ... guess what ... I very much prefer the paint brush.  No ... please don't think that I painted my entire room with a 2" paint brush.  I didn't.  (But I was tempted.)  The roller paints a larger area much more evenly (remember ... this is the first time that I've done this!!)  But I like the brush so much more ... there's a better feeling of control.    Well ... all analogies aside ... I actually  DID  finish two coats of paint today.  I started the first coat at 8:00 a.m. ... had a good lunch around noon, and finished the second coat around 4:30.  Much better than the primer, huh?  :-)  Now I have three things left to do:  (1) sponge one wall, (2) paint the switch plates in my "accent color", and (3) paint the moldings, door frams, etc.  Those things shouldn't take long (I hope!!)

      Yes, the walls are a bit easier ... but they're  still  taking a LLLOOONNNNGGGG time!!    Now, my brother is a fabulous painter.  His home looks gorgeous, and he does all of the walls there himself.  So ... one day a while back I asked him about painting.  I told him about my anxieties about painting, that I had never done any painting before, and that my biggest fear is how long it would take to do things like taping.  He laughed, and insisted that he  NEVER  tapes.  Never.  He told me not to worry about things like taping, and go ahead and just paint.    Well, I figure that all of the books that I'm looking at about painting say to tape.  And ... taping makes a lot of sense to me.  SOOOOoooo, of course I taped.  And now that I have, I can't even imagine NOT taping.  How does he do it!!!???  Anyway ... when I was at Home Depot on Thursday buying a second gallon of white for the ceiling, I walked past TWO tape displays, thinking, "I ought to buy another roll of tape.  ...  No, I probably have enough."  TWICE!!  Did I buy the tape.  No.  I started taping the newly painted ceiling around 8:30 yesterday (Friday) morning.  By about 9:00 I ran out of tape ... with only about 7 feet of ceiling left to tape.  Ugh!!  Well, I know that I need to tape again when I paint the moldings, door frames, etc. so I got dressed, drove to Home Depot, and bought another roll of tape.   Sigh!!   Back home around 10:00, I finished that last seven feet of ceiling and started putting on the PRIMER at about 10:15.  By 1:00 I still had TWO WALLS left.  TWO!!!!!  Ugh!!  I ate lunch, and got back to work, and painted the last two walls, and was done by about 4:30.  Okay ... is it supposed to take that long??????  So ... today, Saturday ... I'm hoping to eat my breakfast within the next couple of minutes, and then get back to work on the first coat of color (blue, by the way) for the walls.  Maybe, just maybe, it will go a bit faster today and I'll be able to put both coats on.  One can hope!!

       Surely, painting the walls will be at least a little bit easier than painting the ceiling!!   Yup ... I put two coats of paint on the ceiling today.  I now have white freckles on my face.  Luckily, I read in my "how to paint" book to wear a HAT when painting ceilings, so I did that, and my hair is still dark brown.  Phew!!    Anyway ... I don't know what was more difficult ... holding my arm up and rolling for two hours at a shot.  Or working around the switch plates and ceiling fan over my head.  Probably the arms.  Ouch!  Well ... all in all, I must say that now that the paint has dried, I really LIKE the color of the ceiling.  It looks SOOOO much better than what was on there before.  I will hopefully get around to doing the WHOLE house eventually.    Oh ... and I didn't slip or fall on the plastic-wrap covered carpeted floor.  YAY!!  Tomorrow, I'll hopefully prime the walls and put two coats on them.  Not sure about getting all of that in with the drying times, etc.  We'll just have to see.....

      Now, I'm sure that you're all laughing at this perfectionist who has never painted before.  Ha ha ha!!  (Just please do me the favor of waiting for a couple of weeks before you tell me that you've been laughing at me!!  Thanks!)  So ... yesterday I went and bought everything I needed.  I basically went up to the guy at the counter and said, "I have never painted before.  I know what colors I want.  That's it.  I guess I'll just have to take one of everything."  :-)  The guy was very nice ... talked me through the number of coats, the pros and cons of primer, painting ceilings, amounts of paint, spackle, tape, drop cloths, faux painting, etc., etc.  I'm sure that I didn't ask every question that I should have ... but I have many FEWER questions thanks to him.  So ... instead of going straight home from the store, I stopped at a friend's house to have her look at the colors I chose so that I could hear her say, "Oh ... that's going to look nice!"  Now, I probably should have gone to her home  before  I bought the paint, because she really didn't have an option to tell me that it wouldn't look nice because I had  already purchased the paint .  It will  have  to look nice!!  So ... today I got up and immediately started the process.  I emptied the room of every piece of furniture (and everything except air!)  I cleaned the walls, the window sills, and the carpets.  And then I spackled.  Spackling didn't take me as long as I thought it would.  I was finished with all of the above mentioned stuff before lunch.  THEN came the drop cloth.  Okay ... so if you  know  that I am a perfectionist and you, yourself, have painted before, I'm sure that you've been chuckling to yourself about Lou Ann and how she'd handle the drop cloth.  Of course, every square inch of floor has to be covered.  SOOOOOoooooooo ... after I completely frustrated myself with the drop cloth slipping and sliding around, I decided to just TAPE it in place.  SOOoooo ... the drop cloth is now TAPED to the moldings.  Ugh!!  And ... between taping the moldings/drop cloth and taping the window and the three doors (hallway/bathroom/closet) ... it took me the entire rest of the afternoon.  Finally ... who ever thought up the brilliant idea of using plastic sheeting for a drop cloth.  I mean really.  Isn't glad wrap difficult enough to use when it's quart-sized-lasagna-holding small?  I mean, really!?  A 12x15 piece of glad wrap is NEVER going to stay where I want it to on the floor of my room.  Not to mention the fact that when you cover a carpeted floor with glad wrap and then try to walk ... well ... imagine it.  [pause while reader imagines...........]  I  KNOW  that I will have a concussion before this whole thing is over.  If I don't post again in the next few days, please call 911 and have them break my door down.  I'll probably have bled out from a large hole in the wrong part of my head due to slipping on a glad wrap covered floor and hitting my head on a taped corner of a window sill....  Meanwhile, please continue to look at  urlLink pictures of my brother's new twin sons, Aaron and Will .  More to follow........

      OK ... so I'm not sure if you all know this about me ... but I am TERRIFIED to paint.  I mean, I have NEVER painted (I'm talking about walls, etc.) and am absolutely scared to death to do so.  My condo has badly needed to be painted since I purchased it over four years ago, but I'm scared!!  Scared?  Yes, scared!!  I am scared that it won't be perfect.  I'm scared that it will take me three weeks to spackle, another three weeks to tape, and then about 3 months to get the paint just right.  UGH!!  BUT ... my brother gave me a bed (long story ... but he gave me the bed from the guest room that they've now turned into the TWINS' bedroom).  I have the bed in my living room right now (contingent on my buying a matress).  Well, I bought the mattress this weekend, and it will be delivered next week (7/29).  Thus ... I figure that it will be a good idea to paint inbetween beds ... I mean to say after I take down one bed, and before they move in the matresses for the other bed.    SO ... I have gotten myself motivated to paint my bedroom.  I actually went to Home Depot this evening and spent about an hour at their computer/paint-idea generator.  Then I took about two dozen cards with paint colors and bought a book about HOW to paint ... and I am now going to shut down my computer and will go and sit in my bedroom reading my painting book and contemplating what color(s) I want to use.  Choosing colors ... that's what they say is the first step.  Why are there SO MANY versions of white.  Isn't white just white??????  (By the way ... don't forget to look at pictures of  urlLink the twins  and of  urlLink Ian !!)  :-D

         Mame!   at the   urlLink  Lancaster Opera House    last night was wonderful!!&nbsp; It's been so long since I've seen that show/movie that I'd forgotten many parts of the story.&nbsp; But it all came rushing back to me.&nbsp; What a wonderful story!&nbsp; I think that I will  temporarily  change my favorite musical to Mame!&nbsp; (Of course, only temporarily ... because I really  LOVE    Into the Woods  , but I'll get back to that eventually without a doubt!!)&nbsp; ANYWAY ... I can certainly see myself being like Auntie Mame to my own nephews ... and it was rather ironic that I saw the show the night before spending a day in Big Flats (that's in the Southern Tier of New York State, if you didn't already know that) with my nephews,  urlLink Ian ,  urlLink Aaron, and Will .&nbsp; At the end of   Mame!  , she takes her rather young&nbsp;great-nephew to India, after some persuasive talk with his parents.&nbsp; Oh ... I can  TOTALLY  see  ME  doing that!!&nbsp; I'm already plotting to take  urlLink Ian  to Disney world the summer before he starts Kindergarden.&nbsp; LOL!!&nbsp;     &nbsp;  Anyway ... after the show, we all (6 of us) came back to my mother's house to have cake and ice cream in honor of her best friend's birthday (which was actually yesterday).&nbsp; We had lots of fun conversation and laughs.&nbsp; As we talked about the show, we also went back to talking about the movies that have been made.&nbsp; I realized that I've never seen either the  urlLink Rosalind Russell version  NOR the  urlLink Lucille Ball version  ... which I just looked up on the  urlLink Inernet Movie Data Base , and discovered that Bea Arthur plays Vera Charles, which must be absolutely perfect.&nbsp; Off to Blockbuster.........

      Tonight several of us are going to the  urlLink Lancaster Opera House  to see  urlLink Mame!   The  urlLink Lancaster Opera House  is an awesome little theater in the town where my mom lives.  Year round, they run great shows.  I look forward to this one.  Maybe Auntie Mame is someone I ought to emulate when I'm with my own little nephews!!  :-)

      Okay ... this is mainly for my teacher friends ... who probably don't even read my blog during the summer anyway ... but I'll try.  So, when I was in Las Vegas, I met a friend of my friend.  This woman works as a dealer in one of the casinos ... she deals high stakes blackjack games in private rooms.  She is a single parent, and her daughter is adopted.  We had a wonderful conversation, for the most part, about kids and school and adoption, etc.  At one point, I mentioned that I had once considered adopting a child, but didn't think that I could handle the emotional aspects of parenting all by myself, without a spouse.  Her answer to this floored me.  She said that for me, it wouldn't be too difficult because I "don't work very much" (her words!!) ... not like herself, she said.  She said that she works "eight hours a day, five days a week."  It would be much more difficult for someone like her to be a single parent than for someone like me.  I wonder (hmmmm....) what the implication is........

      I am taking a break during a hectic day to blog a bit (while eating dinner... what does  that  say to you!?)  LOL!!  I got home from Las Vegas about 2:00 a.m. today, Thursday.  Ugh!!  I only slept a few hours before I got ready to leave for NY tomorrow, Friday.  Whew!  Anyway ... that's not what I wanted to blog about this evening.  Really, what I wanted to talk about was my flights Sunday and last night.  I was a bit bored at one point early in the outgoing flight on Sunday, so I got out the flight magazine and was looking at the map in the back.  (I LOVE maps ... didn't ya' know that!?)  I realized that the flight path from Baltimore to Las Vegas would probably take us right over the "Four Corners" area (where the borders of Colorado, Utah, New Mexico and Arizona share a common point).  Sure enough, after I watched the Rock Mountains go by, I spent a good chunk of the end of the flight watching the Colorado River flow through the Grand Canyon and into Lake Mead.  It was wonderful!!  I got to do the same thing on the way back last night.  Again ... wonderful.  Now, I don't know if you realize that I am hoping to make my next cross country road trip next summer, and that I've been hoping to spend the great majority of the summer in the Four Corners area, specifically concentrating on the Grand Canyon, the Navajo Indian Reservation, and some of the other park areas in and around that part of the country.  Flying over it REALLY whet my appetite.  When we went to see Hoover Dam on Tuesday, I bought a book about the Grand Canyon (full of bibliographies!)  And, I've spent a lot of time contemplating the trip.  I'm more and more excited about it the more and more that I think about it.  In the next couple of weeks, I hope that I am going to be putting a page up in my site to give you an idea of my planning for that trip.  I'll let you know when it's up.  I can't decide on a name for the trip ... like my cross country trip in 2001 was called " urlLink Lou Ann's Great Adventure 2001 " and the trip to Alaska in 2003 was called " urlLink Lou Ann's Folly 2003 ".  So I need to come up with something.  I don't care if my name is in it ... or if it's something like "Southwest 2005" or "The Four Corners 2005" or something about the Colorado River ... or what?  Any ideas?

      Whaddya know ... I didn't think I'd find internet access here in Las Vegas (staying with a friend, etc.) ... but sure enough, I'm online.  Fourth of July in a place like Las Vegas is pretty neat.  We didn't go to the Strip for the fireworks, as they did a wonderful (and LONG) show here in the development where my friend lives.  What's neat about it is that because we're pretty much in the desert here, and there are no real trees, you can watch fireworks all around the sky, being shot off at all different locations, 360 degrees, for several hours.  It was awesome.  From where we were, on the deck of the clubhouse, we watched the fireworks over the Strip, the fireworks right in front of us, and fireworks all over the valley and from the mountain sides.  Cool!  Another point that I'd like to make ... there are certain things in life that you simply MUST do with some young children around.  A few days ago I took a friend of mine's 10-year-old son and his friend to see _Around the World in 80 Days_.  Now, it is a super movie ... Jackie Chan is wonderful, the story is fun, the movie very well done.  But, when you go to see that movie, please try to find a couple of 10-year-old boys to see it with because your experience will be heightened by their reactions to everything on the screen.  Fun!!!  And ... when you see fireworks, it really helps to see it with children who are (1) not so young that they get scared, but (2) young enough that they still think that everything is NEW.  Here in Las Vegas last night, my friend that I'm staying with, Jenny, had a friend of her's and her daughter over to watch with us.  The daughter brought another friend ... the two girls being about 9-years-old.  Again ... such fun!!!  Hope your Fourth was a blast!!

      Yesterday, Friday, I had plans at the hair salon.  Now, going to get my hair done is always an adventure.  My hairdresser, Jenny, owns her own salon.  She is quite a personality ... and lots of fun!  Her shop is called  urlLink Classic Look .  The website is there, but not full service yet, so to speak.  Well, during my last cut & color, Jenny and I were chatting, and I mentioned my new-ish hobby of photography.  In case you haven't seen it, I have a photography portfolio online with a website called Photo.net.   urlLink Please visit my portfolio (scroll to the section that says "Folders") .  Anyway, several weeks ago, Jenny called me and told me that she remembered my comment about the photography, and would I make an appointment with her to come in and take some pictures.  She was going to hire a model and have me take some "before and after" shots of "updo's" to put on the website that is being developed for her business.  Not a problem.  So we decided that I would come in on July 2 (yesterday) at 10:30 a.m. and that I would get my own hair cut and colored at 12:30 ... plenty of time for us to get some pictures of the updo's.  Yup.  So, yesterday I go to Classic Look with my camera and tripod and film at 10:30.  Jenny was apologetic and explained that the model called and told her that she had strep throat (I think that was it...) and cancelled at the last moment.  But ... true to her personality ... Jenny had a quick and fun solution.  Yes, Jenny decided to use LOU ANN's long hair for the updo's.  Now, my first reaction was "How do I take pictures of me!?"  But I realized that I have a remote shutter release.  That would work.  SOOOOooooo ... Jenny colored my hair first, trimmed it, and then started with the updo's.  I think that she must have done 4 or 5 updo's on my hair ... with all of the hairspray, pins, and decorations to boot.  And then, after she did the second last one, she decided to wash my hair again (to get rid of all of that hairspray!) and did one last updo for me to wear for the rest of the day.  Two funny sub-anecdotes:  (1)  One of the updo's was to be a wedding "do".  She put my hair up, and then stuck little white flowers all up in my hair (I chose those particular words on purpose).  Now, I'm sure that the up-do was a wonderful one, as far as up-do's go.  And, I'm sure that some women want little white flowers all stuck up in their hair.  But I can tell you, for sure, that when I get married some day, I will NOT have little white flowers all up in my hair.  And, (2) at one point, she decided that she wanted to have an image of one of her employees doing my eyebrows (they do that at that shop).  Well, I usually "do" my own eyebrows at home.  But, they took me upstairs to the day-spa and pretended to "do" my eyebrows (threading) for the camera.  Therefore, when the pictures have been posted to her website, I may ("MAY" is NOT a guarantee!) remind you to take a look at the pictures of me.  With updo's.  Hah!!
