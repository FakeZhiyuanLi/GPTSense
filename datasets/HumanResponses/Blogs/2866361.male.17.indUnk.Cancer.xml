      The Nurse Who Loved Me By A Perfect Circle  say hello to the rug's topography  it holds quite a lot of interest with your face down on it  say hello to the shrinking in your head  you can't see it but you know it's there so don't neglect it   i'm taking her home with me all dressed in white  she's got everything I need pharmacy keys  she's falling hard for me I can see it in her eyes  she acts just like a nurse with all the other guys   say hello to all the apples on the ground  they were once in your eyes but you sneezed them out while sleeping  say hello to everything you've left behind  it's even more a part of your life now that you can't touch it   i'm taking her home with me all dressed in white  she's got everything I need some pills and a little cup  she's falling hard for me I can see it in her eyes  she acts just like a nurse with all the other guys  1.  I listened to this song because of the name.  It was interesting to me.  I like the phrases this band uses :  Look at the apples on the ground.  They were once in your nose, but you sneezed them out in your sleep. 2.  This song doesn't really apply to my life.  This song is about a man that fell in love with a nurse.  This poem contrasts with my life because right now there is a lack of love in my life... well maybe... 3.  This song is a good one because of all the words.  They're put very well.  The band puts different similes in here to enhance the effect.  It really helps

      The Way By Fastball They made up their minds and they started packing They left before the sun came up that day An exit to eternal summer slacking But where were they going without ever knowing the way?  They drank up the wine and they got to talking They now had more important things to say And when the car broke down they started walking Where were they going without ever knowing the way?  Anyone could see the road that they walk on is paved in gold And it's always summer they'll never get cold They'll never get hungry They'll never get old and gray You can see their shadows wandering off somewhere They won't make it home but they really don't care They wanted the highway They're happier there today, today  The children woke up and they couldn't find 'em They left before the sun came up that day They just drove off and left it all behind 'em (Leavin' it all behind) But where were they going without ever knowing the way?  Anyone could see the road that they walk on is paved in gold And it's always summer they'll never get cold They'll never get hungry They'll never get old and gray You can see their shadows wandering off somewhere They won't make it home but they really don't care They wanted the highway They're happier there today, today  Anyone could see the road that they walk on is paved in gold And it's always summer they'll never get cold They'll never get hungry They'll never get old and gray You can see their shadows wandering off somewhere They won't make it home but they really don't care They wanted the highway They're happier there today, today  1.  I was drawn to read this poem because I don't have a "way", I have no direction.  The words are appropiatly worded and I love the phrases. 2.  I feel like just getting up and running away, and this song makes me think of just being able to do it.  It would be nice to be able to just get up, walk out , and leave. 3.  This is a good poem because its fun.There's a lot similies.

      Nothing to Lose By Billy Talent  Need more friends with wings All the angels I know Put concrete in my veins I’d always walk home alone So I became lifeless Just like my telephone  There’s nothing to lose When no one knows your name There’s nothing to gain But the days don’t seem to change  Never played truth or dare I’d have to check my mirror To see if I’m still here My parents had no clue That I ate all my lunches Alone in the bathroom  There’s nothing to lose When no one knows your name There’s nothing to gain But the days don’t seem to change There’s nothing to lose My notebook will explain There’s nothing to gain And I can’t fight the pain  Teacher said it’s just a phase When I grow up my children Will probably do the same Kids just love to tease Who knew it'd put me under ground At seventeen  There’s nothing to lose When no one knows your name There’s nothing to gain But the days don’t seem to change There’s nothing to lose My notebook will explain There’s nothing to gain And I can’t fight the pain There’s nothing to lose When no one knows your name There’s nothing to gain But the days don’t seem to change There’s nothing to lose When no one knows your name There’s nothing to gain And I just died today  1.  I was drawn to read this poem beacuse  of its title.  It's my catch phrase.  "There's Nothing To Lose".  I have a connection with the words. 2.  I know how this person feels, having no friends sometimes.  It's a hard thing to deal with, being alone.  This poem contrasts with my life right now, I have tons of friends. 3.  This is a good poem because they repeat the phrase There's nothing to lose, and that puts this thought in my head:  There's nothin to lose. So take a chance.

      Hello  By Evanescence  Playground school bell rings again Rainclouds come to play again Has no one told you she's not breathing Hello I'm your mind giving you someone to talk to Hello  If I smile and don't believe Soon I know I'll wake from this dream Don't try to fix me, I'm not broken Hello I'm the lie living for you so you can hide Don't cry  Suddenly I know I'm not sleeping Hello I'm still here, all that's left of yesterday  1.  The words drove me to read this poem.  I have a connection with the words because there's just something in her voice when she sings them that make me feel alive. 2.  This poem is like an emotion that isnt often talked about.  The feeling of being dead.  That's how I feel sometimes.  The message of this poem is a cry for help and a real eye opener. 3.  This is a good poem because it shows just how much someone has  gone through.  This person sings like they got their heart ripped out.

      Mad World By Gary jules  All around me are familiar faces Worn out places, Worn out faces Bright and early for the daily races Going nowhere, Going nowhere Their tears are filling up their glasses No expression, No expression Hide my head I want to drown my sorrows No tomorrow, No tomorrow  And I find it kind of funny, I find it kind of sad These dreams in which i'm dying, Are the best I've ever had I find it hard to tell you, I find it hard to take When people run in circles its a very very Mad World, Mad World  Children waiting for the day they feel good Happy Birthday, Happy Birthday And they feel the way that every child should Sit and listen, Sit and listen Went to school and I was very nervous  No one knew me, No one knew me Hello teacher tell me what’s my lesson Look right through me, Look right through me  And I find it kind of funny, I find it kind of sad The dreams in which i'm dying, Are the best I've ever had I find it hard to tell you, I find it hard to take When people run in circles it's a very very Mad World, Mad World Enlarge your world  Mad World.  1. I heard this song in a movie. I liked this song because the movie to me was about me. I have a connection with the words of this poem. They’re worded so well and it’s just so sad and it makes me feel strong.  2. This poem compares to my own life because song makes me think about how I deal with my own pain and how much I need to broaden my horizons: “Enlarge your world”.  3. This is a good poem because it uses creative ways to get his point across. He uses the downs of keeping your self enclosed as a way to tell you that you need to open yourself up to bigger and better things

      Poetic Tragedy  By The Used  The cup is not half empty as pessimists say As far as he sees nothing's left in the cup A whole cup full of nothing for him to indulge Since the voice of ambition has long since been shut up A singer, a writer, he's not dreaming now of going nowhere He gave heed to nothing, and all that he was... Is just a tragedy So he voyages in circles Succeeds getting nowhere And submits to the substance That first got him there Then in violent, frustration he cries out to God or just no one Is there a point to this madness and all that he was... Is just a tragedy He feels alone His heart in his hand He's alone He feels alone I feel... Then on that last day he breaks And he stood tall And he yelled...and he takes his life  1. I was drawn to read this poem because of it’s name, it just called my name. This poem connects to my life because I feel that in this point and time in my life, that I’m nothing but a poetic tragedy.  2. I’ve experienced this poem when I’m having a bad day, its just all how I feel, nothing in this poem is wrong about me. It’s just me.  3. This is a good poem because I believe it shows that someone out there feels just like you do sometimes and that its okay to feel this way, just not all the time.

      Paper Doll  By Kittie   I look at her in the paper dress I wonder why she wont burn  She’s just a paper doll that’s all Just a paper doll I dress her up she knocks me down They try her on for size  She fits nice one size fits all Now her soul is dead  Now her body’s raw You can numb her pain Watch the blood run down her face But don’t take notice And watch the blood run down her arms Please don’t take notice I know you have her soul And I see it in your eyes She knows you have her soul And she sees it in your .. Eyes Now her soul is dead Now her body’s raw Wash away her pain She wants you to eat her pain She wants you to eat her remains    1. I was drawn to read this poem by its name, it interested me. I have a connection with some of the words and phrases in here like: I see it in your eyes. I find that I can see a lot in peoples eyes, a lot of things like that too.  2. I feel that this poem is about someone breaking someone else down. I know how it is to have someone rip you down and “try you on for size” so to say. I feel that this is about someone being taken advantage \of.  3. This is a good poem because its about raw pain, feeling, and experience. This poem is unique by the way it is worded and titled.

      These Walls.  These walls used to tell a story.  They told a story about a boy.  He was a sad boy said the wall, though not knowing him very well.  He had a lot of posters to cover me up the wall said, Posters that appeared not to mean anything to him, Just a cover. But today he covered me up with something more said the wall. He painted over me with his tears, His fears, So he hid me,  His past So that maybe in his next emotion he could remember, Remember to… Forget.  Those walls lied said the floor. That boy covered you up so that he could go on living. You were just an open wound to him. Once something thought beautiful,  But now just stone cold, You see, Says the floor That boy covered you up to go on living so that his life didn’t end   with that former emotion. Not to be forgotten but to be remember on the inside, just covered. For that’s what paint does. It covers…something.    1. I was drawn to write this poem because something was bothering me when I was painting, I just wasn’t sure what it was. The connection was with a friend who has currently left me for something better, the afterlife. This is for you Mike.  2. This poem compares to my life because that is how I feel about the subject of painting my room. Mike had a lot to do with my room before I changed it recently. He liked the walls the way they were so it makes it difficult for me to paint them. The message in this poem is this: Just because I cover you up doesn’t mean I want to forget, I want to mend myself.  3. This, in my opinion, is a good poem because good poems always come from the heart. This came from more than my heart, it came from my soul, which is rarely seen.

      The Origin Of Poetry  poetry comes from every second of existence… and from the lives of those who lived before... comes from the stones in the street the nails in the rafters... the breath of infants... the throat of the frog... poetry is between 2 at a table... skin on skin... grass flattened by a wind... insects on a flower... blood thru veins and in every movement of all (richard zola)
