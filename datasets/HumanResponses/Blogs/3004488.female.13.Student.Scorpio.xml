      1. Do you feel this would be something you would like to use?  No I don’t think that it is something that I would like to use. I have a good reason for that to. I think that it’s not really safe that I use something like that because if I have lots of money or if I’m a member of a really expensive shop or something like that and someone tries to take that away from me, it wouldn’t be safe becauce they might haunt me down or kill me or anything to get that chip part of my body.   2. Do you think society is ready for technology like this?  I don’t think that society is ready for a technology like this because they will have lots of problems getting the people to agree with the terms. They might have lots of complaines from people not wanting this to happen. 3. What would be the benefits of this technology?  The benefits of this technology would be that no coustomour service or people standing around you waiting for lines or getting other things for other people first before you. You could just get want you want, quick and your out of the shop without any distractions.  4. What could become problems with this technology?  They might lots of complains from people, or they will have lots of disagreements on what they should do. People might be scared of being stalked by people wanting to have their chip so they might feer and want to sue the company.  5. What other thoughts or opinions do you have regarding this technology.  I think it’s still bad for the technology people to come up with this idea, because they would be just wasting there time when people want this viachip card to be invested in them.  They have to have all data’s on the people who has this viachip in them
