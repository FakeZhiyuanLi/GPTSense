      I think I understand what Cobain meant by the famous line in Aneurysm.  I told Charlie how weird I am. When ever she texts me or signs on to msn, or i see her, i get excited.Its sad. What's more scary is sometimes I feel pain when I see her. Theres nothign wrong with her, I love her. But I sometimes feel pain coz i love her so much.  Oh well.

      Do I care.  I have more important things on my mind at the moment. I don't care if people think I fancy Charlie. People think war's wrong. People think it's right. People think the Audi's a better car then the Lotus, people don't.  It's all opinions to me.  And anyway, as long as I know it, and Charlie knows it, that's all that matters. Lana says I'm just as bad as those people who accuse me, for saying I don't care. I know I'm bad. I'm no good, but I don't really care what people think of me anymore.  There's nothing wrong with the idea of fancying Charlie. It's just people seem to have a big problem with me having a friend.  &nbsp;

      This always happens. I have a bad day, and then I go and ruin it all by asking Charlie a really stupid question.   Today's topic was "do you trust me?"   Now she's angry at me I think, she won't text back, I only asked her because I feel like she doesn't trust me sometimes.   THere are times where I tell her anything, she tells me anything, and it's great. I've never felt so open (mentally) to anyone before.   But there are times, when she and Ellen/Andy will just abandon me to have a private talk. Pisses me off. I'm sure there are things between Andy and Charlie that no one else should know, of course. But when Andy and Ellen walk off or Charlie and Ellen walk off, I feel like no one trusts me.   It sucks. And charlie thinks I don't trust her. :(

      I don't feel important. Simple as that.   So many things prove it. Small things. Like people not trying to find me on a train. Like not going after me to see if I'm ok&nbsp;when I'm pissed off. Like not asking me how I am. Like not askin me how I am as much as you ask other people. Like rarely being invited out places.   There's more.   &nbsp;  I feel like my head is going to explode if I don't talk to someone. It hurts.   &nbsp;  Things keep me going on. Somehow. I call these things, memories.   I remember, when we went to the cinema on Monday, to see Spiderman 2. Charlie and me were in Tescos, and she told me how she was going to jump on me and hug me, because we hadn't seen each other for a while. That would of been cool (the hug), but she was worried what Andy might think.   There isn't anything to think. Nothing's going on, nothing ever will. We're best friends.   She jumped on me later, and punched me. But i got a jump hug thing after which was cool. I want another one.   &nbsp;  Don't really know what's making me sad. I can name things, but I can't pinpoint them.   Just want to spend some time alone with my best friend. I like it like that 'cause we talk about anything. Also, she must perform surgery on my beloved kurty!!!!   Poor guitar. I love him. Love charlie too.   Sometimes I wish I was an emotophobic. I have to complete that poem. It's basically done.   I hugged Charlie from behind. That's the first time I've hugged someoone like that.   Why am I jealous of people being happy?   One painful thin is when you know someone's lying, just because they know the truth will hurt you.   DOnt know whether or not to hug them and thank them for caring, or to hate them for lying.

       Today     wasn't too bad.    &nbsp;  We didn't stay in town for long. At first I was REALLY pissed off. When I was on the train, I was bored. Got to Wool. I thought "yay! my friends are here!". I thought I may as well just wait for them to find me. We always do that. If me and andy get on the train we find Ellen and Charlie. Andy wasn't here today. So, I waited. They never turned up. Got off the train, they got off a few carriages down. Ellen said they just saw an empty table and sat there. Didn't even tell me to go find them. Now, I'm sure if it was Andy, Charlie, or Ellen in my place, we would of gone to find them. I was then beginning to wonder if they even wanted me on this trip.    &nbsp;  I guess I was pissed off&nbsp; about before too. I asked Charlie if we could go to her house or something. She agreed, and said she'd have to ask her mum, because they have guests (some very cool guests). That's cool. Our plan is overwritten, and Andy sleeps over the night before, I think. I'm not going to get angry at her or ignore her, because I love her, and plus I don't have any solid facts. Nothing. I called Andy's house, to talk to him about what train he ws getting, and his dad said he was at Charlies, probably.    &nbsp;  Still, it pisses me off.    &nbsp;  I was kinda hoping the secrecy would go away today. Didn't happen. Charlie and Ellen would run off from time to time to have a chat. At one point we went into a shop, Lemon Tree or something, after they went in. When we went in, they left, quickly, and walked off.     &nbsp;  I really have to ask if they trust me or not. Doesn't seem like it sometimes.    &nbsp;  I brought Charlie a ring today. I'm happy about that. I made her smile. Something I've tried to do for so long. I don't mean like saying "smile charlie!" but I mean making her happy that she smiled.     &nbsp;  I just wish I made her smile. I wish I was more important to her too. Too much to ask.    &nbsp;  But she deserved that ring. If I could I'd buy her a better ring, don't really care about the price. But, it would be seen as a "mo fancies charlie!" thing. I wouldn't care, I love her, lots, and I don't give a fuck what people think. I don't think she does either.    &nbsp;  She wouldn't want the ring anyway. I'm sure Andy will buy her one.    &nbsp;  Good news, She can come round my house. My parent's don't mind. Maybe, just maybe, we'll be alone for some time. I don't want to sound possessive.    &nbsp;   &nbsp;  Anyhow, peaceeeee

      Fuck it feels like I'm writing a suicide note. I guess I can call it that because everything will be fucked up more if anyone else reads this.  Where to start. I have no idea.    Dad says I can invite Charlie round my house. His image of girls, was gone long ago. I'm glad.  Today, I felt ignored. Ellen and Charlie ignored me sometimes. Like when they went off to some shop whilst we were in Poole, they asked Andy to look after Tom, said goodbye to Andy and Tom, and thanked Andy for looking after Tom. THey just kinda forgot I was there too. Oh well. Also, the secrecy was pissing me off loads. Hiding a few things is ok, but Andy/Charlie/Ellen kepy going off to have little privacy chats. And here I am, thinking they can trust me.  Charlie thinks I don't trust her. I do. I just don't want to tell her what's wrong, because she'll hate me. I trust her more then myself, and when she thinks I don't trust her, it hurts. It's like saying I don't trust myself.   I try not to hide things from friends. Yet they just seem to want to hide what they can from me. I like being kind, but it's not done much. I remember reading a notice on a message board in St Osmunds, that read "treat others how you would like to be treated". At first I laughed. It was on a RE Board, and I didn't believe it. Yet it stuck with me, and I soon believed it. Does it work? Hell no. I'm still going to try and be as kind as possible.  We're going to Poole tomorrow. Don't really know if I want to go. I want to go because these are great people I'd be spending my time with. I don't want to go because I'm fed up of the privacy. I just walk with the group, for a while, only to notice them slow down, so they can talk. Tom continues walking, so do I. But it feels like they have no trust in me. I'm also fed up of basically being ignored half the time.   I'll go, and see what happens.  I was meant to be going to Charlie's house tomorrow anyway. She just overbooked it with this visit to Poole. For some odd reason that pisses me off. It shouldn't. I like these people. Maybe I just want to be alone with her for a while. Everyone else spends time with her alone, I don't. And I can barely tell her that.  As I write this, I have a gut feeling. I want to share this with Charlie, yet I feel she'll hate me after reading it.  She only ever hurt me with things she said because it was her, Charlie, my best friend, who said it. Anyone can say those words. They don't bother me much. But when my best friend, who I love so much, says it, I start to wonder.  &nbsp;  Stomach problems are scarily overwhelming my mind. When I'm not thinking about life, the stomach pains come out to play like usual. I am seriously fucked. I can barely go a good hour without feeling a huge increase in pain. Things were meant to get better. I'm going to hospital.  Seeing a psychatrist soon too. August 2nd 3:00. The date I pour my feelings out in front of a stranger. Hopefully a friend will be there.   Home life is shit. Don't want to think about that.  Sometimes I want to give up and die.  Sometimes I give up wanting to die.  Sometimes I feel dead.  Sometimes I wonder why.  I really need to talk to someone.  &nbsp;  Peace,  M.&nbsp;

      I was kinda hoping that epople would remember I was going LOL. Tonights been hectic...my parents have been fighting loads, ym dad thinks I'm so irresponsible I#ll go missing in Iceland. Maybe I'll fulfill his dreams. I'm tired as hell. Can't taking any sleeping pills coz I wont wwake up early.   Mona came into my room and gave me a big hug, then asked me to put her to bed "one last time". All this "last" stuff is scary. AM I going to die? To be honest I am scard. I don't want to go righht now. Things are still very insecure.   Damaged things can be fixed with a touch. Damaged things that arent touched, slowyl crumble.  Oh well.  Will an yone miss me? Mona.  Ilove Mona I love Charlie I love Andy I love Ellen.

      I don't want your sympathy, Just someone to re-assure me, That safety in numbers is the policy.  I don't want your sympathy, Just someone to understand me, A promising friendship, A friend to help when I'm sad a bit.  I don't want your sympathy, Just a check of reality, That I'm not the only one, Here.  I don't want your sympathy, I just want your curiosity, To know that you want to help me.  I don't want your sympathy, I just want you really, To tell me there's no fear, Because you're here.  But I have your sympathy.

      Love is between 'him' and 'her', There's no place for a follower, It gives me a headache, The fact that I cant take, Is that my best bests are leaving me.  People in general, Want me to avoid my best friends, And their opinions are meaningful  I think i should saty away, Come back someday, When it's alirght, And I've seen the lgiht.  But maybe people would let me, Be with who I want to be.  He misses her, She misses him But no one wll miss me, Hopes wearing thin.  People tell me to leave them alone too, I just want friends like anyone would do.  I want those friends.

      This is that poem i spoke of earlier. I think it's a good poem. Right now, things are shit between me and Charlie I think.   She... She makes it alright  When it's all gone wrong She'll soothe your ears With her soft song,  She's the only thing That holds me back, From killing myself, It's just hope i lack.  But she fills me with hope, Tells me I can cope, And I believe her too, Without her, I can't imagine what I'd do.  I could talk about her all day, But I'd know what you'd say, “Mo you love her”, So what if I do?  She sees my life as a blur, And cleans it with a hug, So gentle yet meaningful, A gift from her is special, However big or small.  She makes everything bad Seem like the best miracle I ever had, She taunts the hateful loneliness, With her kindness, She tells it to leave me alone, ANd she changes my tone.  She makes me happy, What I thought wasn't a possibility, Became reality.  And here I am, crying, Into the crying pool, I'm such a fool, I'm lying, Waiting, Missing her.   If she read this she'd blush too, But it's the least I could do. She saved me.  But it doesnt matter what I think of her, Life's just a murmur, Without her.  I learned what she though of me, Recently, And to be honest, I've lost count of the nights I couldn't sleep easy.  She keeps me awake, When she's not even there, Makes me feel at my best, In moments of despair.     I just wish I made her happy.     Crap poem I know.

      I guess I am going to hospital then. Doctor says if the meds I'm on now don't work, he'll have to refer me to hospital. So far they aren't working, and they're ny 5th prescription for my stomach.   To be honest I have it all visualled out. Me in hospital, with only 2 or 3 visitors. My mum and dad arguing, and Mona, just talking like the lovely gal that she is. But that's it. Don't imagine anyone else coming to see me. I have a fear that if I eevr need an operation, I may wake up during it. Scary idea.    Anyhow, 24 days left till I find out if I need hospital treatment or not. :(

      I am off Iceland tomorrow.  Scary stuff.   Why am I scared? Because I feel insecure about things right now in my life. And I'm just worried if I leave them for a short while, they'll collapse. I also have to sort a few things out with people. NOt looking forward to that.   Will anyone miss me? I don't really know. I'm not going to pretend I know how everyone feels and say no one will miss me, but I don't expect it much. I read Andy's messages today (at his will of course lol) and I guess, I was kinda...shite. All this time I'd been thinking whether or not I should text Charlie or Ellen. I left it at the end because I thougght they didn;t want a fool like em bothering them. THey probably  didn't, I don't know. It's so odd, I was there when Charlie text Andy telling him she'd be home. I don't know why but I was expecting a text any minute, from her, telling me she'd be coming back. Not in the same words coz she doesn't love me, but I dunno.  Apparently Charlie's pissed me off. I don't know :S .

      This is weird. I don't liek the idea of talking to myself but then again I'm currently on my 14th journal....so....yeah.   I'm scaring myself. Lately my poetry has been Kurt Cobain Stylee. He was a great guy, and he mentioned in his journal something like                                                  "all my lyrics are a bunch of contradictions"  I don't want that to happen to my poetry but it may happen. He also didn't make much sense in songs because he just focused on rhyming. ONce again I don't like that. Scary.  I am going to continue writing poems although I am getting a book published. The final number of poems is 177. I will be cutting this number down to 100-150. This is odd. I didn't want a publisher who would be selling a book. I just wanted a publisher who wouldn't ask for much money, who'd just make a copy for me. But now I have an author's contract to sign, 8% royalties (not bad considering I didn't want anything), two free copies of the book, and, well, an achievement. Getting a book published at the age of 16. Wow. I am currently writing a poem called Perfect Girl. Yeah it's a poem about charlie but I don't really care what people think. There is nothing going on  between her. I was going to text her sayign I missed her, but I thought nah. Ellen would see it, and probably tell Andy. Then everyone would think I fancied her. CHarlie said a while ago about when I say I love her, I immediately say something funny afterwards, as if I'm ashamed of telling her I love her. Same goes for the text. I'd text her just sayng "I miss you" but I'd be scared everyone would take it the wrong way. If I said "I miss you *sob* lol", then there's humour, and I feel safe. But love is no joke.  I truly do miss her. She has changed the world for me. Or changed me for the world. I don't know.  Pills. All I can say is they suck. After my 4th prescription, the Doctor prescribed me a similar drug, but with less side effects.   It's kinda working. I took my first one yesterday at 9am-ish. All went well till about an hour, then i got pains for about 3 hours non stop. Had a break from them for a few hours, they came back.  I woke up today (WELL DUH! lol) and, um, I missed the dose by about 30 minutes. On any previous prescription I wouldn't be in much pain by then, only 30 minutes late. But all I got today was a sharp pain which lasted even after I took the pill. Just for being 30 minutes late.   The sleeping pills don't work. All I can say on the matter.  Am I becoming dependant on meds?  Peace for now, IlovekurtyIlovecharlieIloveandyIlovemona

      I love making songs on la guitar. Calms me down, and I cna also be proud for a few seconds. I know it's not long, but still it's cool. To anyone a song i make up is nothing but to me, it's like a huge collection of emotions. My psychatrist reckons my emotions control me too much. When I play a home made song, lol, it's like I control them, like everyone else does.  I'm proud. :D

      I love my new unoffical random  job.  Seriously, it's great. I don't mind working all day. Just incase readders think I am being sarcastc I am not. I have to wait up at 7:30 tomorrow, go to Harmony Music, move some piano's, then I work all day. For some reason I love it. Great people to work with, and I do everything. The till, the card machine (ugh...just gotten used to it), doing demo's, explaining stuff, and telling people how old Paul is.   But tis cool. I also plan to wake up early 2moro, maybe 5 or 6, have a shower, go out with Black Saphire (can't get a girl, get a guitar :S), go somewhere non-urba, and play for a bit. Then go to work. The morning is beautiful.

      She's my friend, And I can't pretend, That I don't want anymore, Than her friendship.  But I must lie to her now, I wish somehow, I could tell her I love her, But I can't. She has the life, A perfect life too, I'd just ruin it, Something I always seem to do. These two were made for each other, The perfect lovers, And I'm trying to fit in somewhere, But I haven't realised, Lovers don't come in threes, but pairs, Maybe I should keep this rule memorised. There's no point in trying, She's with someone, And there's no point in lying, Her love for him is never gone, And who am I to get in the way? She tells me she loves him almost everyday. She's defined her love for him, And maybe I'm just too dim, To realise, she's happy, She doesn't want me. It's nothing new. Maybe I should take some good advice, Something I've heard more than twice, I should just quit while I'm ahead, Continue this and I'll be dead.
