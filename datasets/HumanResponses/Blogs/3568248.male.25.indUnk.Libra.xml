      Have Video Games become part of mainstream culture? 	  From early day gaming systems like Atari to video games like  Pac-Man , the gaming industry has made a huge technological leap.  Most significantly video games have leaped into mainstream American culture. From games like  Tiger Woods Golf  to more violent games like  Counter-Strike , games have become a way for young and old to pass time. If you are looking for evidence of this cultural leap, look no further then the football genre of video games. A tremendous gain in the fan base of the genre and the tens of millions of dollars in sales over the years has allowed the genre to build up and create its own following.  The ability for children to “become” their athletic hero’s through video games has given the video gaming industry a key to the hearts and imaginations of all ages. “Video games are something you do, something you do to your head, a world that you enter, and to a certain extent, they are something you ‘become’ (“Video Games and Computer Holding Power”, Sherry Turkle, page 501).” Even the prestigious Football Hall of Fame has a corner dedicated to football video gaming.  But with the many positive gains both monetary and socially there has been a fluxuation in the negative outlook on gaming and the anti-gaming groups. These groups believe that video games are causing youth today to lose focus of their education and that they become obese, loners, and violent.  Despite the efforts of these groups the video game industry has flourished over the past decade and it seems to just be getting bigger and bigger.  This paper will take you on a walk through many of the different aspects of this culture and will focus on the sporting world and how it seems to go had in hand with video games.    As a former collegiate athlete here at the University of Oregon and an avid video game player I have spent many hours fulfilling my needs for competition through video games and my sport.  For me video gaming can create the same competitive spirit that I get from playing sports and I believe this is true for many athletes.  Athletes and Video games go hand and hand, they are a natural pair as they can connect both worlds to each other through the need and want for competition.  When my teammates and I would be traveling for our away games we would always make sure that we packed down the Xbox and the Playstation 2.  NCAA Football  by EA Sports was the game of choice for half of the team.  HALO , a first person shoot-em up game is the most popular and is played religiously by the entire team. The reason these games were so popular amongst my teammates, and myself, even though the games were from to different video game genres, was because they aloud us to stay competitive even when we weren’t playing our sport.  We would play these video games before big games to relax, we would play it whenever we weren’t obligated to do something for or sport.  Sherry Turkle talks about this topic in this passage from “Video Games and Computer Holding Power”,   “The games require total concentration - to which he attributes their ‘meditative’ qualities - at the same time as they provide a stage for excellence. You get to do what achievement-oriented people like to do: get better. And yet, in their own way, they are also ‘time out’ (“Video Games and Computer Holding Power”, Sherry Turkle, page 510).”  It is a very common trend amongst athletes to have video games be their release from their sports.  In an article “Athletes find games virtually impossible to put down” written for ESPN, Greg Garber writes about the obsessive nature of athletes and their video games. The article talks of the competitive attitude that athletes take toward their sports games, “The passion, frankly, approaches a frightening level…The truth is, professional athletes love sports video games.” These are the words he uses after observing a game played between two professional football players.  This is typical of the atmosphere that is seen when playing video games: intense, committed, and competitive gaming that allows an escape from their everyday world. “For me, it’s kind of a release. You get involved in a game, you stop thinking about giving up seven runs in five innings for a few hours.” Curt Shilling is one of the older players for the Boston Red Socks, but he also finds this release in playing these video games and this is the case for many athletes whether young or old.   Video gaming is often thought of as a negative endeavor. For many though, it is a way to find a release from their everyday lives, or the real world.    “Online games may not bring smiles to the faces of many American parents, already concerned about overweight kids who consume too much media violence. But Mr. Munoz says the games encourage social interaction with far-flung team members. ‘Our gamers are in touch with people all over the globe,’ he says, pointing out that most teams are comprised of individuals from every part of the country (Are video games a sport? By Gloria Goodale,  urlLink www.csmonitor.com ).”  Like it or not, the phenomenon of video games is clearly a highly significant component of contemporary American culture and a highly significant indicator of something (though we may not fully understand what this is) about its role in the energizing of behavior.  Studies have shown that for many children video games can help with vision and reactionary time, and with the development of video games for educational purposes video games can be used in a positive light.  The instructional video game Where in the  World is Carmen SanDiego , was the focus of a case study done by Honebein, Carr and Duffy in 1993, which states that this video game helped keep the children’s attention and created a more efficient learning environment.  In the world of Sports, video games are becoming more and more part of how athletes train or prepare for an event or race.  In the NASCAR circuit of car racing video games have become a way for training for their races.  Developers now have the technology to actually simulate the actual racetracks and how the car would react to the track giving drivers the true feel of a race. Of course, no video game can replicate the seat-of-the-pants feel of a car getting loose or the fatigue of the final 100 miles, or a blow from another driver’s front bumper. But the simulations can help a rookie get ready for a new track or a veteran refine his line. “We spend a lot of time on it the game. You learn patience, and you can learn self-discipline.” Dale Earnhardt Jr. said this of his video game playing in a special on ESPN that covered athletes and video games.   “The pilot of a race car does not dare to take his attention off the road. The imperative of total concentration is part of the high.  Video games demand this same level of attention. They can give people the feeling of being close to the edge because, as in a dangerous situation, there is no time for rest and the consequences of wandering attention feel dire (“Video Games and Computer Holding Power”, Sherry Turkle, page 509).”  In this passage Sherry Turkle talks about being close to the “edge” and this feeling again simulates what real drivers go through and is a major reason why racers use video games for training purposes. It is not just limited to car racing it extends to many different sports. Golf is another major sport that has athletes that use the video games to learn about their own swings and the courses that they play on.  Sherry Turkle talks about video games creating this idea of the “pure you”.  Just like when playing golf, video games create a level playing field for the gamer.  The idea of “you against it” is the gaming that occurs, the one on one action of you against the machine.  This idea though ultimately turns into “you against you”.  For instance in golf when you are playing against the course you are really playing against your own emotions and skill level. Well playing a video game is the same way, “Playing the game is an assertion, completely pure individual competition (“Video Games and Computer Holding Power”, Sherry Turkle, page 512).”  Video games are becoming more realistic and the technology continues to get better and better making the games even more popular.  The race for realism has been pushed by the film industry for years and now the video game industry is following their lead.  					  At the height of Bo Jackson's (multi-sport athlete in the late 80’s) popularity,  Tecmo Bowl  is created.   Tecmo Bowl  is a football video game released for the original Nintendo Entertainment System in 1989. In the game Jackson is simply unstoppable. Even though Tecmo Bo, as he came to be known, had only one play designed for him, he would regularly peel off 80-yard runs. Even if the opposing player called a play designed to stop him, Jackson was able to bust through multiple defenders for a 20-yard gain. Video games have become so much a part of the culture that long after Bo Jackson’s retirement from the NFL; his legend of Tecmo BO lives on. “I can guarantee that I can't go a week without someone mentioning something about  Tecmo Bowl ,” says Jackson. The original version of  Tecmo Bowl  had just four offensive plays (as amazing as it sounds, just two run plays and two pass plays) so on defense, you tried to guess which play the offense was running. If you guessed right, your defense swallowed up the play, meaning that every play had a 25 percent chance of immediate failure. It was like football crossed with chess, and just about as intense. With the creation of new technologies games have made a tremendous leap towards becoming “real”.  In today’s games like  Madden  and  NCAA Football  you are given a selection of real play books from the different NFL and college teams.  Another feature allows you to create your own plays; you can even create your own teams and players. In creating your own players you can chose from options like height, weight, race, and even to the color of shoes that you want your player to wear.  For today’s gamers, digital athletes are even realer than the real thing. “Motion Sickness” an article by Tobey Grumet, goes through the technology that is used to make digital athletes more human.   “Video games aren't what they used to be. No more crudely animated quarterbacks throwing a football to identical teammates, no yellow orb-shaped ‘men’ chasing gumdrop ghosts. It's all about realism now. ( urlLink http://www.popularmechanics.com/technology/computers/2001/11/motion_sickness/print.phtml )”  Artist renderings of actual players’ physical attributes, like tattoos and birthmarks have been a staple of the industry for the past few years but with the addition of motion capture technology, the new method behind gaining reality, video games have launched into a whole other realm of reality. Athletes like Tiger Woods, Roger Clemens and Payton Manning have all been part of this innovative process in the gaming world. This technology is allowing the gaming culture to play with digital replicas of their athletic hero’s and gives them a sense of realism that has aloud the sports game genre to develop such a strong following.  Turkle argues this point when talking about being Han Solo from the movie  Empire Strikes Back  and relating him to the game  Asteroids .   “This allows a very immediate kind of identification with Solo – the video simulations put you ‘in the place’ of the spaceship pilot or the missile commander or the adventurer in the Tolkien world. But you are not allowed to play the part (“Video Games and Computer Holding Power”, Sherry Turkle, page 509).”  Today’s technology disagrees with Turkle, as sports games allow you to become and play the part of the athlete.  The thing is that sports games give the gamer the ability to become that sports hero whether it was Bo Jackson from the days of  Tecmo Bowl  or to the Tiger Woods, Ray Lewis, or Kobe Bryant’s of today’s technically more advanced games, gamers are getting the same satisfaction from the competitive, and realistic purpose of the games.  Because of these advances in technology and the demand for realism from the gaming community video games have become a form of new media.  Lev Manovich author of the book  The Language of New Media , believes that navigable space seen as an “interface to a database” is a new form which may be unique to new media.  In games like  Madden Football  and  NCAA Football  we are given a 3-D view of the gaming action on the field when viewing the instant replay option. You are given a camera angle that can zoom in and out of playing action; you also can rotate the camera 360 around the play that you are replaying.  The ability to navigate the space within the database creates a whole new level of new media.   “For the first time, space becomes a media type. Just as other media types — audio, video, stills, and text — it can be now instantly transmitted, stored and retrieved, compressed, reformatted, streamed, filtered, computed, programmed and interacted with. In other words, all operations which are possible with media as a result of its conversion to computer data can also now apply to representations of 3-D space (Lev Manovich, The Language of New Media, “Navigable Space”).”  This navigable space is helping the gaming industry to create a more realistic atmosphere for the gamer and gives him/her control of all aspects of the game.  This creates a game that allows the gamer to create whatever game they wish and gives them to create the same media picture that the real telecast he/she might have seen on Monday night football.  This ability to create the same experience of watching a Monday night football game, but you the gamer having all the control, is the direction that video gaming is heading into. This is so that the experience of playing the game is as real as it can be.    For these games to become so real they must simulate what gamers view in real life and or on TV.  Sporting events like the Super Bowl have become famous for the advertisements that they play during the games commercials.  A method that is now being used and will continue to get more advanced as the technology gets better is the introduction of advertising into the gaming world. In the world of advertising there has been no surface that hasn’t been used to sell or peddle products. So when Janelle Brown wrote an article on advertising popping up in video games it shouldn’t be a surprise.  This idea is not totally new, as many online games have gained revenue by putting up banner ads.  Banner ads are found in entryways and chat rooms of multiplayer games and networks. However these ads do not interrupt game play or download time, which is one of the major issues facing those companies trying to advertise in games. Advertisements in games now would slow the games down and would interrupt game play. However game developers are pushing the technology so that they can eventually take advantage of the tremendous amount of money that it would create to try to make the games more realistic.  Developers are trying to find technology that will allow the games to play commercials at timeouts, end of the quarter and half, and also while you are downloading the game, which is already happening on the multiplayer internet sites. The hope behind this idea is that the mainstream advertisers will bring in revenue for the developers to explore more realistic technologies.  “If you look at gaming as a category, you can see it would be valuable to mainstream advertisers, because 12- to 17-year-old boys are a notoriously hard demographic to target,’ says Whitcombe. ‘Our demographic is hugely appealing to a number of mainstream advertisers- - Coke, McDonald’s are already associating themselves with video games, particular in the sports category ("Coming soon to computer games- - advertising", By Janelle Brown).”   The question is still how the consumer will react to having these ads in their games? There are a few different views on the topic and it is up to whom you ask, but one view is that the ads would allow developers to lower the prices of the games giving the gamer a cheaper but more realistic product.  The view that seems to dominate the topic however is that already rich producers and publishers are just going to get richer and benefit from the ads revenues.  Stephen Heaslip, editor of the gaming news site Blues News, says this about the topic,   “If they drop the price to $20 and say, ‘OK, we’ll put in some ads,’ they might not have problems with gamers. But if they sell $60 games and just stick an ad in there, there will definitely be a negative reaction ("Coming soon to computer games- - advertising", By Janelle Brown).”			  Athletic games like the ones EA Sports produces ( Madden Football  and  NCAA Football ) are trying to add ads to the games in the same matter that they do in real life basketball and football games.  They would like to put ads around the courts and fields or on the scoreboard or stadium.  These ads wouldn’t affect the game play and would give the games an added feel of realism to them.  Technology has advanced enough to create exact replicas of stadiums, courts, race tracks and golf courses but it will take awhile before game developers find a way to get advertising into the games however it is only a matter of time. 	 Video games are becoming so real that people are actually starting to call certain aspects of the video gaming culture a sport.  Though this is for the extreme gamer, it is becoming part of the mainstream culture, as was evident at the CPL Tournament (Cyberathlete Professional League).  ESPN and ABC news have covered the events over the past few years showing that the event is becoming more and more popular amongst the mainstream. Teams from all over the world come and compete in the tournament that challenges game players of many different video game genres.  But is sitting down and playing video games a sport? According to those that play, yes it is and they are adamant about there feelings.   "The CPL games,’ he adds, ‘are not limited by borders.’ While some may question whether online, global game play makes these competitors athletes, Munoz is unapologetic about the moniker. ‘Athlete,’ he says, ‘is a Greek word for competitor. We're not football players, but we're serious competitors.’CPL commissioner Frank Nuccio says, ‘This is a viable, play-by-play sport that is in its infancy.’ Like it or not, he adds, technology is the dominant mode of social interaction for the next generation. The CPL games are part of that leading edge (Are video games a sport? By Gloria Goodale, urlLink www.csmonitor.com )."  Video games are becoming more and more prevalent in many parts of society and just like the skateboarders, surfers, and all other extreme sports athletes, can understand what the video gaming world is going through.  The extreme sports athletes were labeled as losers, rejects, slackers, and bad influences on society, which is what people, are saying about video gamers.  In today’s culture however, with the introduction of the X-Games, extreme athletes are looked upon as sports idols and are accepted by the mainstream culture. So it is not inconceivable to think that video gaming some day will be accepted as a sport and accepted by the culture as a whole.					  Kids and adults alike find themselves being able to live their dreams and wishes through video games just as Turkle discusses in her book.  The days of kids at the parks playing basketball imagining him/herself playing against Michael Jordan are over as kids can now just be him or play against him in the video games. Video games are becoming a hot topic for many people in regards to all areas of life. Parents are worried that their children are becoming obese and distanced from society. Politicians are looking for why children in schools like Columbine are feeling distanced and becoming dangerous for the rest of their society. Video gamers are fighting the stereotypes that have been put on them and are trying to make their culture be accepted in the mainstream American culture. The one group that is just sitting back and enjoying everything are the publishers of these games as the business is just booming and even with the economy being bad over the past few years, video games haven’t wavered a bit. Video games are quickly becoming part of everyday life for the children and young adults of America and this trend does not seem to be slowing down anytime soon.
