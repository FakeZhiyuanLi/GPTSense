      Oh gosh we have to rush to the LTO to follow-up tina's stuffs. Well today is another busy day for us, at least last night I&nbsp;was able to sleep well because my cough&nbsp;took pity&nbsp;on me...but I woke up at around 4:00 Am just to go to John's place (call of nature) and was able to sleep again. But I have to re-visit my doctor then after&nbsp;go to the LTO office with Kuya Joseph. A lot of people were saying I am getting thinner each day because perhaps of lack of sleep and lovesick...ha ha ha, FOOL!   I really have to sit down now and discipline myself to review...my comprehensive exam will be on September.   Nothing's new today except that I am still waiting for Jorge's call.   Jo

      I was so busy yesterday (July 28) because we were celebrating the Feast of St. Ignatius and we had the FINAL REPORT of the student council and Induction of New Officers. It was&nbsp;a fruitful&nbsp; year for all of us here in LST. I remembered then that I forgot to write an entry&nbsp;in my blog. Anyway, we brought tina outside to get a taxi and rode immediately to the Airport, a flight to Zamboanga at around 3:00 Am. After few minutes she was crying over the phone while talking to Kuya Joseph because out of her excitement she lost the bulk of materials for her thesis she was bringing in the taxi...hmm I wonder how she looks in the&nbsp;airport while crying and feeling helpless..hay naku tina talaga...&nbsp;  Today, we are making letter to the LTO to help us claim those papers (hay..crossing our fingers!) sana di tinapon ng mamang driver. I woke up this morning at around 2 AM feeling not so alright, so restless....I tried to go back to sleep but I can't. Tinanong ako ni Kuya Vhan kaninang umaga kung umiyak ba daw ako, sabi ko Hinde inuubo lang ako. I lost weight and my exams sucks! I hated myself! I am counting the days remembering Jorge always. Bakit kasing nagkataon umalis sya nag- exam rin kami, nakakainis!  Siguro talagang di pa ako sanay na wala siya, masasanay rin ako. Minsan nakita ko si Dedeng sabi ko sa kanya nalulungkot ako, sabi nya sakin masasanay din daw naman ako ng wala si Jorge ganun din ang sabi sakin ni Ate Pangga. Perhaps... ganoon talaga kailangan matatag ako.  Nag-rereview na ako for my comprehensive exam...at gusto ko na ring umuwi sa amin. Dito ksi kahit san ako pumupunta parang andun ang anino ni Jorge...kaya mis na mis ko siya.  Hintayin ko na lang siya...  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;

      Yesterday I spent my time studying but I don't seem to be able to concentrate on what I was doing. We attended a mass and it made me feel a little light. We just retire then after a short despidida for Jorge, everything went that way... Today&nbsp;Jorge is leaving, he just have to while I go to school trying to make everything so perfectly ok, as if it is--doing the usual things that I am doing. I wanted him to be happy when he leaves, I don't want to shed tears&nbsp;or do all those emotional stuffs while he goes away. While I wait here I have to keep moving and do my review since September is fast approaching i barely have time to review. Things would be so different now... I was thinking time moves so fast, we have to adjust our own pace to keep up to it! Sooner or later things are changing with time. WE LIVE as if we are bound by it which should not be (the reason why I donot wear wrist watch).  Today I remember the fox and the little Prince talking "on the book: LITTLE PRINCE by Saint Exupery." The fox telling the little Prince to TAME him so that they will become friends and soon the&nbsp;little Prince&nbsp;tamed him and become part of his life. The little Prince realized that once you tame someone he/she will be the most unique person to you: there will be no other roses or foxes beautiful than what he tamed for and became part of his life---for it is the fox that he took time to spend&nbsp;and energy to be with, it is the fox that he cares deeply and it is that same fox that he loves so much..so there will be no other foxes that can ever change in its place in his heart. Soon the Little Prince has to LEAVE...because he lives in another planet and the fox said they will forever be connected to each other and he said "IT IS ONLY WITH THE HEART THAT ONE CAN SEE CLEARLY BECAUSE WHAT IS ESSENTIAL IS INVISIBLE TO THE EYE."&nbsp; and he said " Forever you will be responsible for what you tame."  I just thank God for everything.  &nbsp;

      Today it pains me so much to say goodbye to Jorge. I was thinking time is fast approaching, eventually he has to go...but I have to be stronger. and I will be...  My heart aches..so much, I'm gonna miss him. I hope he undertands how much I feel for him. and what I am going through right now. As i try to understand what he is going through as well. I love him.

      Everyday---day in and day out we have to figure out what gives excitement and what breaks the routinary things we do, to make always a day as if it is another-- different, special and wonderful day!  Yesterday was a great time spent with Jorge (Sta Lucia and Lola Helen), another day of "kakulitan" at paglalambing. Kaya nga ngayon pa lang na-mimis ko na siya. Mami-mis ko talaga siya&nbsp;kaya lang ganyan talaga and buhay. But at least we have started building great memories to ponder on and laugh at when we are far away from each other, when we are lonely and so alone...  Today I have to study for my exam on Monday and Tuesday but I started my day washing my clothes though ang logging in my blog to at least write things that are coming in my mind. I plan to go to UP and get my stuffs there in the binding center. Then I have to discipline myself now, to really sit and start studying or else I'll be doomed!   And suddenly I just remember this song:   "How did you know I needed SOMEONE like you in my life.  That there's an empty space in my heart.  You came at the right time in my life. I'll never forget  how you brought up the sun to shine in my life  and took all the worries and fears that I have.  I guess what I am really trying to say; it's not everyday that  SOMEONE like you comes my way.  No words can express how much "I LOVE YOU"   It's a meaningful song, and i linger on it!   I thank God.   JO   &nbsp;

      How can I be fool enough to allow myself to be swayed by the nasty attitude of Jorge, he loves to make a fool out of me! I hated him for that. Last night he got into my nerves..really! He love it more when I get so mad and so damn bullshit..makulit talaga, nakakainis as in! Sakin pa talaga nagpabili ng ulam kahit anlakas ng ulan..sobrang inconsiderate...ay bahala na nga siya, magkakaroon lang ako ng heart disease or dis-ease!  Anyway, I plan to study now, to go to the doctor before I'll have this serious tubercular or lung virus or whatever you call it. I'll see him then to give him the money (kailangan nyang bumili ng gamit) then they plan to watch the controversial documentary film of Imelda, I bet it will be&nbsp; very "imeldific" this afternoon or evening, I think so...  I just have to live each day enjoying and savoring each moment that he is still here, we are still together. Perhaps parati akong naiinis sa kanya kasi gusto ko lang maglambing or because this is part of the pain of separation...ha ha ha, can't believe I am saying this! In any case, I love him so, without question and without doubt!  I&nbsp; am always and always GRATEFUL!  &nbsp;  &nbsp;

      Oh Gosh it pours down so hard can't get my ass moving. I wanted to sleep but I have to keep moving. I am in UP right now waiting for the binding center &nbsp;to open (have to get the things I asked to bind). I am a little early now, was just catching up with tina to come here. Jorge? I hated his guts!&nbsp;He went home at 5 am...at 5 am!!! I don't know what he was doing out in the street the whole time.&nbsp;Don't know what he was up to? To hell with him anyway, I'll get used to his habit then and then. It scares me to think that..when I'll get used to all these which I&nbsp;do not really like though from the bottom of my heart.  &nbsp;  I don't want to wake up one day oblivious to the things happening to me around, doing the things which I do not really like doing. I just want to live a very quite, simple and peaceful life without complications, however, I think with Jorge things will become complicated. I don't know, am not&nbsp;certain,&nbsp;I am still grappling on unchartered shores here.&nbsp;I have to rely on my instinct and on circumstances which are sometimes beyond my control. Well in the first place I am still adjusting to the whole situation perhaps jorge is also adjusting with my nasty behavior at times. We have to live with it and change the things which we think are still malleable enough to change. I needed to communicate with him intimately and if he don't seem to listen and understand--i have to try!  &nbsp;  I have this feeling of distasteful sense of separation, I wanted to just savor it though and feel what it really feels being left alone in loneliness and wilderness of life. Afterall, I have been alone all the time nothing's new right? Keep telling this to myself. I HAVE TO LIVE WITH WHAT IS BEING OFFERED TO ME AT THE MOMENT.  &nbsp;  I'll get moving now, get the things I asked to bind, go back to ateneo and do what I have to do---study and do my stuff!  &nbsp;  NOTE&nbsp;FOR MYSELF: &nbsp;In the loneliness and bliss of life, I found something so essential, TRUTH which cannot be shaken nor changed--that life is such so meaningful that at times you can't just extract the meaning it in!It is meaningless!  &nbsp;  &nbsp;

      We met in the students' general assembly, everything went well though. We have started organizing the different committees for the school year that will help the student council facilitate in their whole year activity. I felt happy because of a good participation, students seemed so interested..suddenly I remembered my students in Ateneo, the people in the organization, I miss them... &nbsp; Last night or I bet this morning while I dozed up in between the attack of my cough I dreamt of my family. My mom was holding my youngest brother, we were about to leave, to go somewhere else&nbsp;which I do not exactly know where, it's kinda vague to me. Then it took me so long to change clothe and arrange my things and people were waiting, I feel so sad and anxious and afraid, for reasons I do not know. Suddenly we were leaving but my dad, mom and younger brother were not coming with us...I just kiss them goodbye and I woke up with that poignant feeling of leaving..I don't know..perhaps I just miss them so...soon i'll be home. &nbsp; I texted jorge today, he told me he's going to their office. He is busy now especially when he is about to leave&nbsp;for work...this is the way it is, I needed to get used to it. I have to learn to detach myself to people I love because the reality of life impels me to accept the things I cannot change, things that needed to happen in one's life like saying good bye.  &nbsp; I learn to be happy in whatever that comes &nbsp;along&nbsp;my life. Perhaps this is&nbsp;real peace, the sense of freedom to be happy wherever I am, whatever I have or do not have.  &nbsp; My heart is always grateful.

      I would always spend moments in silence trying to figure out where I fit in the biggest and greatest scheme of&nbsp;things. Where do I belong? I have to seek and find my niche in this place where I live...I think I found it but not totally, not wholly! It is though important how I love and see my day to day experiences as a contribution to my own growth thus have ripple effect in the growth of others and the people I deeply touch in one way or another and eventually land in the very heart of the matter---my very place in the greater scheme of things...so I begin with yesterday!  &nbsp;  Yesterday (Sunday) all my troubles seemed so far away (parang awit!!! he he he) I have great time with Jorge, Tina and Kuya Joseph. We had fun in STA Lucia, just spending the whole time there playing kid's stuffs. We did enjoy esp. when we ended up eating so much as if the next day is a judgement day for us. I love to be in Jorge's company the excitement is so inexhaustible. However, I am worried sick now, he's leaving soon...i'll just have to grab on the memories he'll leave behind. Oh heart! How can you be fool enough!  Today, I went to school with my desire to do my things here, to work on somethings in the student council, to finish homeworks and the like. I look forward to have a wonderful day today. I just feel so oblivious to the surroundings I live now--seminarians, nuns, priests all are also seeking and trying to find themselves in the scheme of things...  &nbsp;  We are all grateful then. For this great life that we live each day, for the challenges that we face, the beauty and bounty of life.

      I started my day doing my homework in Pastoral Psychology, well student life, I have to do what I am supposed to do. I did my laundry afterwards, for me its a ritual that gets rid of daily stress. Jorge visited me early this morning with his newspaper. Oh boy! he never realize how much he surprises me with&nbsp;his little and unpredictable ways! He went home and I think he is sleeping now...soon he will be suffering from over sleeping, over eating and over a well-rounded tummy! That's why he wanted to go and work now..that which will give sense to his daily living.  And I'll do my own stuff here...study and work while waiting for him. After all, life is about waiting! We wait for seasons to change, fruits to ripe, people to grow, sun to set and shine, tide to become high or low, moon to wax or wane, we wait..falling in line even in the&nbsp;ordinary routine of our life, we wait for loved ones to come home in our arms.  Our love story then becomes a mantra of waiting. For me, it shares a kind of wisdom par excellence! For what&nbsp;are the virtues that develop in the person when they learn to wait, to harvest fruits in the right time, to linger on time and learn patience...to make the heart grow ponder and live? Everyone who knows how to WAIT knows the virtue and wisdom behind it!Mahal ko ano na naman ba tong pinag-sasabi ko? Minsan naniniwala na talaga ako sayo&nbsp;na baka mag-end up akong baliw dito sa mga kabaliwan ng buhay ang mga pinag-gagawa at sinasabi ko. Anyway, yun this is my reflection, I think therefore I do.  &nbsp;   Note: Sa mahal ko, araw-araw kong sasabihin sayo na mahal na mahal kita. Maraming salamat sa lahat ng ibinahagi mo sakin---panahon, pagmamahal, buhay at higit sa lahat yung kabuuan ng pagka-TAO mo. I love you mahal ko.     &nbsp;   JO

      Ngayon galing kami ng UP ni Jorge, pina-bind ko yung notes ko of last semester. Andami nyang naalala (bakit kaya ganun?-well nagtanong pa ako?!)Tapos kumain kami..masarap ang pagkain, at as usual masarap kasama at kausap si Jorge. Na-mimis ko na siya kahit andito pa siya, ganyan naman talaga ang buhay may nang-iiwan at may iniiwan (Mabuti na lang goodbyes are not always for good, babalik din yan!) Siguro andaming plans na kailangang i-fulfill, dreams to dream,realize and make come true, love to live with and past to always reminisce and learn from. KAhit ganun naman yang si Jorge di naman siguro siya parating sawi, fortunately may nagmamahal naman sa kanya at sa kanyang kayabangan sasabihin na naman niya sakin na MARAMING nagmamahal sa kanya...but I know his fears, his concerns at the moment..things he wanted to fulfill kahit di man niya sinasabi sakin. I have learned to tame him and read and discover even the unarticulated things that comes across his mind..i know! I began to realize that life indeed is full of surprises, and its foolish to generalize that it's a boring and lonely place in here...tulad ko parati ako na-susurpresa sa uncertainties at pinaggagawa ni Jorge sa buhay naming dalawa.Minsan sasabihin nya wala pa siya pero andyan na pala siya sa tabi ko...his presence makes a lot of difference in my life...minsan din naman I can transcend beyond..kahit wala na siya dito physically andito din naman siya sa puso ko, so it won't make a big fuss in case magbabarko na siya. Basta andami ko ng sinasabi...magmamahal na lang ako, at sana mararamdaman niya ito. Maraming salamat po.

      We can just automatically without thinking say that it is love that gives meaning to our lives... Napag-isipan ko rin yan, at naramdaman ko, maaari nating sabihin yan ngunit di naman nating lubos na naiintindin ang kabuuan at hiwaga ng pag-ibig at buhay. However, we live life one at a time loving even without understanding, maybe it is meant to be that way.  I remember now I have jorge, I love him so. He is all that matters to me now. Perhaps at the end of the day, I won't be able to fully comprehend why I feel this way, I just feel it. He is never a perfect person like I am, with all his flaws..but that did not stop me from loving him I accept him just the way he is!  Kahit makulit siya, napaka-unpredictable,minsan nakakainis na ewan...ngunit andito pa rin ako. Ganun talaga, di ko man lubos maintindihan ang mga bagay-bagay ngunit parati naman akong umaasang maintindihan ko ang kahulugan nito sa buhay ako.  Maraming salamat sa taong nagmamahal sakin.

      Well I should have started my day by attending ordination and feast day of the Camillians but I prefered to stay home with Jorge.However, I have meeting with the new set of officers in the student council. Things went smoothly anyway. Martin and I are just nostalgic about leaving the SC, well perhaps it is natural to feel this way since we will miss a lot of things after our term.  Jorge drank so well last night,got a swollen lower eye (left side)and an eyeglass with a scratch!Perhaps alcohol do really affect the psychomotor stuff and proper body coordination of the person, eventualy loses his balance and fall on his knees, or face or fall upside down (whatever the position is)...stupid drunkard, why drink when you have to get in all those troubles! Oh men, I donot understand them fully..how can I?  While posting some things I met a friend from long time ago in ADZU, who else? Junti Castillo, he said he still study in La Salle, taking his MA in Econ..good for him.  I have a very exquisite day today!I thank God.  Jo

      Hmmm I think I fail to remember that a state of well being is very important and that includes healthy disposition, physically and the like. Paano ba naman I was interrupted by a very disgusting cough while I was still sleeping at six o'clock in the morning. Sobrang sakit ng lalamunan at likod ko..I think I needed to see a physician to diagnose and give me proper medication or I do it by myself with proper care and drinking of right herbal medicines..well I will think. I miss Jorge, I wish I am with him hugging and cuddling, but I have class and responsibility to do in the school..so I am here rainy or sunny season. Today I met Ms. Eufenia Rabanal(studies Ma in Pastoral ministry in LST), 80-year old lady,very interesting...she always study and at that age she still have that zeal and enthusiasm in her to learn more (academically). She taught us a little of international phonetics which she practically study for 5-years in Rome. I love her disposition! She's cool old lady, who defies the real sense of age in the way she experience, look and live life! This is the wonder of life.  I wish i'll spend my life beatifully like her...I wish to be with my love.

      I started doing my log when I arrived in the multi-media room...i begin my saying "It's a great day!" but then well something went wrong with my blog, it does not save what I have written. Better try again. Yesterday (Sunday)I did not log in because I donot own a PC in my place. However, that was a wonderful day, just spending quality time with loved ones. I was with Jorge, we watched Spiderman 2.I did really enjoy, kung di lang sobrang makulit tong si mr. galeria. Sinira pa ang araw ko dahil may MARIA pa siya (ha ha ha, I always say I am never jealous!I am not.) I am too broad-minded now..at secured pa!No big deal for me.  Today I started doing my stuffs as early as possible. Well am helping in the election of the Student council Officers. It is a great day as well..meeting friends and great people around.  I am happy..and grateful!

      Today I woke up a little late. Feeling at least good but still coughing randomly. I think the vicissitude of my attitude depends mainly on how I slept and woke up (if not in the wrong side of the bed). But I feel so weird today, there is a feeling of anxiety, of remembering the past,what is in the present and what will be. I think I am becoming overtly reflective..I am practically looking at myself as if I am some kind of unknown specie- not homo sapiens though!Isn't it weird?! with all the feelings and anxiety of living and loving,I began to realize that this is what it is meant to be... I love!

I just came from house (jorge's place)no bath, feeling bad because of bad cough the whole night. I'll take a shower afterwards anyway. I love it to be with my love..to hug him all day and night..so I care less goin to school without takin a bath...hmmm foolish heart.Always tend to do crazy things...

      Hay naku ang buhay napakahirap minsan ngunit napakasap rin namang mabuhay! Minsan nga di ko na maintindihan ito dahil sa hiwaga nito, sa sobrang linaw minsan nito at sa pagkakabuhol-buhol nito sa liwanag at hiwaga rin ng pag-ibig. Tulad nitong mga nakaraang araw masydo akong nababalisa, masyado akong nag-iisip at masyado akong di mapakali. Siguro dahil sa marami akong hinahangad sa buhay, marami akong expectations, etc. Ngunit di pala dapat ganyan, dapat natututo akong mabuhay one at a time, natututo akong i-appreciate ang mga biyayang natatanggap ko sa aking buhay sa araw-araw---tulad na lang ang nabubuhy ng payapa paggising sa umaga hanggang sa makatulog sa gabi, ang biyaya ng pagmamahal na higit sa lahat di ko maikukubli na sa maliit NILANG paraan naibabahagi nila ang kanilang pagmamahal sakin at may pagkakataon rin akong maipadama at maibahagi sa mahal ko sa buhay na mahal ko sila---tulad ni Jorge malayo man siya, siguro may pagkukulang man siya pinipilit nyang gumawa ng paraan maibahagi lang nya ang kanyang pagmamahal sakin in his own little way. Ganoon rin ang aking pamilya, malayo man sila ngunit naipadadama nila na mahal nila ako. Siguro minsan di ko man lubusang naiintidihan ang buhay, napakahalaga ay alam ko kung paano mabuhay...hay ganito talaga ang buhay.  Maraming salamat. JO

      I FEEL SO VAGUE today. Just can't exactly know how I feel about things in my life. Where am I going? what is my purpose though? my fears, my deepest longings? etc.  I have this feeling of uncertainty? confusion maybe? I am not sure. I cannot articulate this feeling. Perhaps because I am still searching for meaning in life or maybe because I wanted to comprehend love in its totality but since partly it is a mystery I cannot fully grasp it! Whew! nakakapagod, hay mabuti pang mabuhay na lang ako sa araw-araw  at magmahal at maging mabuting tao---tapat, kilala ang sarili---ang sariling kahinaan at lakas, ang maging mapagpapakumbaba,etc...ha ha ha.

      "When things go wrong as they sometime will, don't quit!" this is a famous line in the DESIDERATA. To encourage us as we journey in an uphill place. It lets us venture into the realm of patience and perseverance. Because most of the time we quit when we are almost there...when the dawn has almost pass and the sun started to shine...but that is the darkest hour of the night when its almost dawn yet a very thin line to welcoming a new day full of light and life! Why am I saying all these, why do i go into encouraging myself to continue? to never give up? Is it because I feel so alone now, so sad? Perhaps yes. Because I am becoming tired, I am becoming hopeless.... but not really. I don't know I just hated myself for trying to confuse my own self. Just let me be...  I thank God!  Jo

      There are things, moments or people that touched us in a most special and deeper way---and suddenly our lives are changed and we are never the same again! I feel so sad then not because I am changed as a better person because I am experiencing love, and it is the most special and deeper moment that I can ever experience yet it brings pain as well. Why is it that good things must always be coupled with pain? because it is the only way to be?  I haven't heard anything from Jorge still, I missed his call yesterday. I feel so upset, so sad, so alone. I have to recognize this angst, or else I will forever be pretending and denying what I exactly feel.  I have speculated a lot about where he is, what he is up to, and how he is doing...my head aches! I figured out he is in the mediterranean area (souks and spain, or the atlantic island and mainland coasts, etc), port to port, or maybe in the Carribean--- on the splendour of the ocean, in the adorable MS CAROUSEL! I saw her on net, she looks great..with all the stuffs and staffs. She was perfectly made by some wartsila yard in Helsinki, Finland. I wonder how great people can do in this world!  Perhaps before some lover or woman of the Vikings also was thinking like this when their lover has to go around as warriors and explorers in that part of the world ( esp N,W of Europe) during the 8th and 10th century. Perhaps they also feel the same pain and uncertainty that I am  feeling right now. Maybe they too were anxious as well while waiting for their lovers on shore...waiting for them to come back HOME--back in their arms! or maybe they too have speculated a lot and skeptic most of the time as of what men are doing aboard,while navigating. Maybe eating and drinking a lot, telling their own stories, working hard, and finding comfort in another women's arms at night! oh how stupid of me to think of all these...  I guess I have to stop here. With all of these, my heart is still warmth with that sense of gratefulness and appreciation of all these experiences and appreciation of all the aspirations, dreams and experiences of Jorge as well.  I thank God.  JO

      At last we found Tina's baggage, actually our lives revolve aroud it till we found it, it was too important for tina that even our own solitude was disturbed because of that! :-) I visited the doctor and she told me that I have cough allergy(triggered especially during extreme init or lamig) so I just have to live with it--drink my medicine, a lot of water and fruits. Last saturday Jorge called up..I was so happy that my happiness cannot be contained! But I am worried as well because he has I think flu and cough and his physical, emotional, psychological state is perhaps still adjusting to everything there... I hope everything is fine with him. I do!  Sunday was a day of worship and thanksgiving, so we attended the 5:oo pm mass. It was very refletive then, the Gospel was about the importance of persons over material things or goods of this world. Then I remembered what does it matter if you have all the things in this world, the money, material things but you are so lonely, so unhappy..ano ang magiging kabuluhan ng lahat ng yun. In the first place they are all temporary-- "of this world" when we die we cannot bring them. SO I reflected on it, what is so essential afterall in life?  Ano nga ba ang pinakamahalaga sa mundo?  pakikipag-kapwa tao, pagiging mapagmahal, tapat  and above all I am able to see the  interconnectedness  of one another and everything else in this world in relation to a God that we have faith in.  Hey is this doing Theology?! ha ha ha.  Mahal ko, i love you.  JO
