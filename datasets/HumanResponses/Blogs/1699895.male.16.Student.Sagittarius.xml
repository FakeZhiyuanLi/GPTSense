           Well, I made JV startring keeper this year...thats not too bad, If I must say the least. I really have not been able to condition lately, so I guess I'm pretty lucky with that. Our first game is friday 22nd agaisnt Novi at 5:30pm, at our house, come watch us lose!!       This weekend pretty much SUCKED so far. If you havent noticed, the north-eastern united states TOTALLY lost power for like two days. It was so stupid, dark, and quit. There was nothing to do, but just sleep.  All I know was the power was gradually returning to the cities. First the Brighton area got power back on Thursday night around 6:45pm....then it was Canton who got there power back at around 8:15 AM today, Livonia finnaly got power at around 6:30pm...but it sucked because I wasn't able to do anything today, and I wanted to see a movie tonight with kristen! >.       Ben is still white-water rafting untill sunday, so we can't practice untill then. I might, POSSIBLY, VERY slight chance, go with the varsity team and watch them during the Holt scrimmage, which might be cancelled as well due to the dumb power.  I might have to go anyways because people get pissed when I don't come, and I wont be back till 3 and then I have to go to the not-so-fun block party with a bunch of old foggies.  Then Sunday we practice maybe and then its another 3 mile run later and then more half-miles...NOT COOL!       But looking at the bright side, the power is back, and that means the air conditioning is back too, so its not that bad. At least I can sleep tonight. I also started listening to a band my sister like called Apocaliptica.  They are a Metal band from Sweden.  Get this...ALL CHELLOS. it sounds pretty cool actually, and it must take a lot of talent to play like that.        If I don't go to the Holt Scrimmage, I might just see a movie later, most likely by myself...guess you can call me if you want to tag along 7342616603....Well, Im going to go now...l8a all...

      HEY! Christmas was of most fun! I think as you get older, you get to realize what Christmas is all about, and thats family, and the people you love....but If you tell me "OH, All I want for christmas is to be with (person)....BULLSHIT!!! Regardless to who you are, and all the people you love, your just a human, and humans have a desire for things to keep them haapy.   I'm not saying that you DON'T want to see your friends and fam, I'm just saying stop lying to yourselves, you fat cat bastards...maybe some people can live with just being with someone, but I'll tell ya, its a tough world out there, just remember, 90% of the time, people are assholes, they don't care about you, live with it...so now tell me what you REALLY want for christmas..MATERIAL POSSESSION WISE!!  I think christmas is a balance of the love of one self and of others....don't make yourself miserable just to please others, but don't totally ignore them either...you must be able to maintain a state of homeostasis.  Only when you love someone, should it be of your life and fortune...but COME ON!! PATHETIC little teenagers running around thinking they know what love really is.  Even with immature adults feel the same way, of to the end of depression and then kill themselves.....Let's be reasonable people....you can love someone, with all your heart, but PA-LEASE...if your still in highschool, don't expect it to be some Romeo and Juliet thing. You can only be ignorant and young, but that doesn't mean you can't be wise!!  I'm perfectly happy with the way my life is going, I have no regrets, and I'm ready to make people feel happy about themselves...yes, there is love in there air, and I hope things turn-out OK!  If you feel the need to talk to me about this, IM me at Murhur18 or e-mail me...  ....until then, I'm goning to figure out what would happen if that guy from smashing pumpkins lost his car keys. OVER AND OUT!!

      Stephen Lynch has made some great songs over the past few years, along with some of the great albums he has released...but why is this song inpaticular so bad? You know he just makes crap up. He's done songs on gays and retarded people and there was nothing wrong with that??? Oh well, I think its one of his best songs   urlLink "Kill A Kitten"  by Stephen Lynch  Other then the controversy of the kitten song, not a whole lot has happened except for parties and getting ready for our own party.  Swang a few times on monday, great fun as always (hurt myself pretty bad, but I'm not the one to complain, after I sandwiched Kyle into the dirt)   Can't wait till christmas! Its gonna be loads of fun! Hope to see you at the party (P.S. there aren't any inventions, just come and you'll be welcomed......hopefully=) )

      I saw The Return of The King again, on the same day, at 9, and didnt get home ill 12:30.  Then Evan, Jordan and I watched Reqium for a Dream till like 3, still one of the best movies of all time.  Yea, last night was good.  Today I'm cleaning my room...It's a rancid mess, and I really don't like it being messy, so I'm just gonna do that and sleep, since I got no sleep yesterday, which is alright, as long as people wanna do something later today. Oh yeah, isn't today like the shortest day or sumthin.....  This IS the most wonderful time of the year!!

      3 1/2 hours long, extensive plot, great battle scenes, The Return of The King was a really great movie, and was well thought out, and I would give it 2 thumbs up if I were a critic....you should go see it! ITS AWESOME!! I won't say anything in case you haven't seen it yet, but it is highly suggested that you should go.    I saw it at noon today and got home at 3:30, and slept till 6....I'm still in daze mode, but I can still type =).  I think I'm goin go run out and purchase some things for my printer, something I was supposed to do yesterday, but since I'm just a big fat shit, I slept some more! lol. so I'll see you all later!

      I'm sorry, but the best game ever is Amplitude, for the PS2. Personally I suck, but I'm getting better, and I might be better then Evan someday (and pigs will fly, and sheep will roar.)  All of my classes are sweet this semester, I really don't hate any teacher yet....can't wait to differ.    Science Fiction is not the easiest class in the world. I like sci-fi, but the class is for upperclass men, and you have to do a LOT of reading, and you always have homework. But yeah, its alright I guess.  I have nothing to do this weekend, so call por favor 734-261-6603 or cell 734-716-2603  I will also own all the Jay and Silent Bob movies =D   Alright Im done

      Moslty around this month so far, I've been writing multiple papers for multiple classes, trying to get as close to perfection as possible. This has been killing my social skills, but I guess its alright.  I've also had to read books up the fashizzy, like All Quiet on The Western Front, Huckleberry Finn, and The Great Gatsby.  I'm getting sick of reading, but luckily the semester is coming to a close soon.  The Swing has been my prime entertainment so far this month. It is actually quite fun to swing, and to try to invent new tricks, but it is also quite dangerous, but it's the risk factor that keeps us alive.  also I beat  urlLink Fishy!!!!   Aliright im out peeps                                                                     716-2603

      How many people have said that...YES, it is friday, and your vacation probobly sucked! lol j/k.  I guess The only reason people come here is to see what I've been doing, so i'll just give you a recap of my vacation.  On Friday 19th, There was old friend (not literally old) Ashley Morris, who had her annual christmas party. The party was sweet, I think its safe to say we all had a great time who went. I left at like midnight and walked to Seans and crashed at his place.  On Saturday the 20th I saw Lord of The Rings: Return of The King, twice, once with Sean, and again with Evan and Jordan. LOTR:ROTK was probobly the best one out of the three, or so I think...after that I think Jordan and Evan just crashed at my place and we watched Requim of a Dream, which is another shizzit movie.  Sunday I was about to go to church, but I slept till noon....  Monday I went out to a few malls to go Christmas shopping for family, because I'm poor, have no money, and can't get crap, so to only be fair was to give my friends nothing. I know, it seems thoughtless but, fuck, I didn't get anything from anybody. It's OK, I didn't really want anything. Also,  went to one of Davy Boys hockey games, and they won, agaisnt the Flyers, and I know most of the people on that team, including Dietz, Wood, and Andy.  HAHA!  Tuesday I think I just hung out with DB and Jordan, I think Melissa too. I ended up crashing at either Jordans or DBS, I'm not sure.  Wednesday was Christmas Eve.  Basically helped my mom around the house for Christmas and also I think I hung with Evan. He loves to play Flash computer games.   CHRISTMAS!! Few things I got  -DVD/VHS Combo -2 CDs (Both Stephen Lynch) -Final Fantasy XI for PC -L-Desk -19" TV -Sweet Corvette phone  -Adidas Cologne -Axe and other shizit I wont go on. Haynie and Jordan came over, and we went to DBs, where there was also Brenna, Danielle, Greg, Melissa, and Drew. We watched Seabiscuit. crashed at my place  Friday 26th, there was hockey at St. Mikes. Evan, Sean, Andy, Joe, and I were there. Brian came late, but hes the best so it was koo.  Pretty even teams, it was tied most of the time, and it ended winning off a deflection by Sean. After that, we went to White Castle and got some Crave Cases and I went home and crashed thurr.  Saturday, I woke up at 1 and built the L-Desk, which looks extremly sweet, and finished that at 4 and hung with Melissa and Jordan and went to the mall. Crashed at my place.  Sunday I woke up , took a shower, went back to sleep  Monday I went to DB's last hockey game of december, and also hung with DB after, and did a few swinging stunts in. Had Davy-Boys Party also, and that was fun. Melissa brought the DDR, and Donna tried it and she failed. lol. It was really fun  Tueday I woke up really early at 6 to get a few things done on my computer, because It's been acting up, so installed a bunch of shit and re-did some stuff.  that took like 3 1/2 hours, but it worked.  Also, swang on that lovely day, and messed around with Evan for a tad.  Wednesday was New Years Eve, and they were gonna play hockey at St. Mikes but I didn't. It turned out there was an old guy trying to take Seans stick while Sean was trying to retrieve the ball. Sean called the police and they came and Sean could of pressed charges but didnt, (bastard) but it was OK.  PARTY here at my house, That I didn't know about untill the last minute, but thats okay, Evan and Sean came as well as a bunch of family.  Flash Games Galore, and PS2 galore as well (haven't played console games in months) Gazzola did his Fireworksthing and it looked awsome  Thursday (today?) went to Drews house for like the whole day and came home. There was solid swinging, and the rose bowl, (GO USC!)  played scrabble with Greg, Scott, and Scotts g/f, and then made the Mur website, which will be up soon.      But MAN, I have SO MUCH TAREA that I need to do, so no more partying and shit, I'm goin to do it tommarow no matter what, so everyone will just have to deal with it. But my vacation was actually extremly great, and I hope everyone had a great vacation!!

Turco of the Stars is suspended for four games because he slashed an Oiler in the face, and will be back for the playoffs.

      Once again everybody, sorry for not blogging a lot. I have free time now, so I will blog more often, and I am being serious this time.  The Green Tag Savings is going on at Guitar Center for the month of March. There are some sweet deals this time, and I really think you should considering taking a gander soon.  Eric Clapton will be playiing at the Cotton Bowl June 4, 5, and 6. I really want to go, even though I probably will not be able to.  Tickets go on sale tommarow, via Ticketmaster.   urlLink Brickman  is the best game ever, I think you should consider downloading it for the fun.  Going to Cominghome with Summer, oh yeah =)  Full Field games at Wixom started a few weeks ago. Instead of the games being freakishly early, they are freakishly late now, but i guess that is better.

      there is so much homework to do, and I have like no time to do it so i skipped soccer.  I didn't want to, but i had to. My grades are actually up, and i want to keep them like that.  I borrowed wind waker from brian, so that is my current hobby of the moment, that and playoffs, both NBA and NHL, but ottawa is out! >.  There are two names that you must remember  Amplitude After Hours  went to senate with the amp gang, and brian sniffed sugar up his nose. im suprised that we were not kicked out. He was asking to look suspecious. But brian is cool n e ways.  We can play (completely, not just partially) Enter Sandman, For whom the bell tolls both by metallica, and Smells like teenage spirit by nirvana. Brian and evan also wrote a kick ass song.  as for After Hours, we alreay know what we want for an EP! marty is good at bass. Theres only one problem with this though...i can't play drums, but i guess i do alright when it comes to improvision.  we need a good mic amp or a PA system though, cause i can barely hear schultz when he sings.  good day, by the way

      Yea, yesterday was definetly not the best day ever....I won't go into detail, since it is rather complicated, but lets just say i have a  horrible case of Influenza.  Basically I ended up puking around a half a gallon of vomit, and then lost so many electrolytes and fluids that i was unable to stand or walk...i had to lay down on the floor cause so much fluid was being extracted from my blood i could not even get on a couch or bed.  I ended up drinking some Peptolyte, and almost in 10 minutes I felt much better, but still not close to healthy.  At times before I took the peptolyte, when i attempted to get up I almost blacked out and I thought I was going to die.  It was fun.  It seems like if I take decent care of myself and eat the right thiongs, I should be better by monday or tuesday, and able to do things. I won't be doing anything on easter so I don't risk it.  Other then that the Wings are on today, so I will get some reast and watch that later.

      ahhh evan has got me addicted to playing Mario 64.  I can't stop playing it.  I got 58 stars in 2 and a half hours.  Yeah, Im grounded till spring break =( but at least im not grounded during spring break. That would be f'd up. To make a long story short, I did something wrong.  Well, not too much going on other then that. Today was just a tiring day i guess.  Got home and started homework since I had so much, and im still not done, so I should probobly finish it.  Wings lost 4-1? Tigers won 7-0? WTF?!  ttyl

      Not to much to write about, except the Red Wings have won the presidents trophey this year, last year it was ottawa.  I have a 105.7% in biology right now, which is cool enough to say the least.  Also I am doing great in Sci-Fi  I am failing sports....what a lost =( YEAH RIGHT how can u not get an A?  Today was okay, just really tired right now and i think i am going to take a nap in a few  I feel like taking won of those retarded quizilla thingys because I really have nothing to do, but I figure a nap is just as good as not being cool, or wait...what? i need sleep  Wings last game is agaisnt the Blue Jackets tommarow, and they are not going to be happy to be playing with kirk maltby at the same time. They are either gonna kick there ass or just be afraid of M-by  bye

      This weekend has been great. Let me recap the main events of the stupendous time before summer comes (I like to call it "pre-summer")  THURSDAY: Mowed steves lawn and sleeeep  FRIDAY: Started opening up the pool!! First we removed the cover and cleaned the deck. Then we filled it up the rest of the way. Then, went to Phils to practice.  SATURDAY: Continuation of the opening of the pool.  Clean the rest of deck, and started circulating the water. Went to Phil's work and bowled two games with Brian, and then practiced some songs.  SUNDAY: Planted flowers with the family minus Lindsay and then slept some more, but ended up going to Mur's to play some Halo ^_^  MONDAY: Finished the opening of the pool!! Put in a clhorine tablet, and then shocked it, and in three hours, it was ready to go! But there was a problem that got fixed really late, so no swimming. Bob came over to do the bio.  That was my murly weekend! Hope everyone had a good weekend as well ( not really)  mur

      So far, this weekend has been pretty good compared to previous four day weekends.  On firday we opened the pool! But let me tell you right now, It's really friggen cold, and we have yet to turn on the heater, which will be done sunday, so it can be swimable for monday. Then I mowed Steve's lawn, and went to Evan's house, but ended up going back here.  Went to senate this morning, and got some eggs with bacon and some tasy hash browns.  Evan was there too, and he always spends a million dollars and eats practically nothing >_  Why is the title "Science Fiction and Me" you may be asking (or not)?  Well, I have to still do my whole final for Sci-Fi, and I also have to read the rest of Childhood's End, which is like 9 chapters by monday, so this will not be fun at all. The book IS good, but it still is boring to read on a weekend.  Don't know whats going on today. Guitar Center with Phil, Evan, and Brian maybe. Most likely practice. Call if your bored or something.  mur

      AHH! Lamar was at our soccer practice today! He is so good with teaching people new things. He might not be as good as Dominic, but still, Lamar is able to distribute information out to us in a very civil matter, and his dog runs with us too.  FOUR DAY WEEKEND =)  Jeff D and I were driving home from edsel adn all of a sudden his rear passenger window shattered. For like no reason. The music was not at all loud. We're thinking someone threw a rock at it, but either way, it stinks.  So yeah, tommarow im supposed to do something, but i forgot. I think phil is gonna be gone somewhere...maybe not, but i gotta mow the lawn tommarow and eat right now, so ill c yall later

But today looked like it was going to rain, and then it turned out nice, so I just chilled today and didn't go to phils, since evan had hockey anyways. Also went to Seante to get some extreme chili dogs since they are the finest in the world.  four day weekend this weekend, and SCHOOL IS ALMOST OVER! I can't wait. Moaty = moat  So uhh yeah out of no where, my aunt comes over today. They are extremly close to being rich, and she is moving to california because uncle jon got a huge ass raise from like Dell. and they are thinking of buying a new car. so what do they do to the old car. thats right, its mine! its a 99' mercury sable, black, with only like 35,000 miles on it, and its in the mintest condition, and my dads work like does something, i forgot, that lowers insurence rates by a lot, i think by like 35% because hes worked there for 33 years. so lifes good  anyways im out =D ill ttyl

      Consider the Tampa Bay Lightning quick learners.  More importantly, consider the Tampa Bay Lightning a Stanley Cup finalist for the first time in the franchise's 12-year history.  Saturday, the Lightning put the difficult lessons gleaned from a devastating loss in Game 6 to good use in Game 7 of the Eastern Conference Finals. As a result, Tampa Bay emerged with a taut 2-1 victory against the more experienced Philadelphia Flyers to book its place in the 2004 Stanley Cup Finals.  There, the Lightning will face the Calgary Flames, the Western Conference champion. Game 1 is Tuesday night at the St. Pete Times Forum, which was filled with a record crowd of 22,117 rabid fans for Saturday night's do-or-die Game 7.  Unlike Game 6, when the Lightning coughed up a late lead to force Saturday's elimination game, Tampa Bay never went into the defensive shell that seems to subvert its high-octane game.  "There was a lot of anxiety and nervousness," admitted Tampa Bay's Martin St. Louis. "But, we came out hard and we kept going -- even after they scored the goal. I believe that things happen for a reason and I truly felt we needed to play a Game 7 as a team to see how we responded."  The Lightning responded brilliantly.  Flyers-killer Ruslan Fedotenko, ironically a former Flyers, and Fredrik Modin scored goals to open the lead and then Nikolai Khabibulin held the fort, even after Philadelphia's Kim Johnsson scored midway through the second period to make it 2-1.   Khabibulin finished with 22 saves, including third-period stunners against John LeClair, Alexei Zhamnov and Michal Handzus, to make sure Modin's goal stood as the game-winning tally.  At the other end of the ice, Robert Esche was brilliant, making 30 saves to keep the Lightning from building on its early lead.  While it was Tampa Bay's first-ever Game 7, Philadelphia was appearing in its 12th Game 7. The Flyers had gone 6-5 before Saturday night, although they had won just one of three on the road.  As a result, many believed that Philadelphia -- with a roster full of veteran stars -- would have the advantage in this game. Not only because of its experience, but because of the dramatic way it won Game 6. In that game, the Lightning were just 109 seconds from winning the series as they nursed a 4-3 lead established late in the second period. But Philadelphia solved Tampa Bay's cautious prevent defense as Keith Primeau scored the tying goal with an unbelievable individual effort. Then, with just 1:42 remaining in the first OT, Simon Gagne banked a pass from Jeremy Roenick off Khabibulin into the net to force Game 7.  taken from  urlLink NHL.Com

      Yeah, Its like 3 am right now, and I probobly should be in bed right now, because of the day that is going to happen tommarow...  I have a game...In Midland.  The place itself is at least 3 hours away. It will be a long drive, and I hope that the weather will actually be good, because it will be boring if not!  Hagen won't even play tommarow, because he kicked this kid in the nuts (nice job, moron)  Earlier today (or yesterday, i should say) I practiced at bens.  We accomplished lots. We played a few songs, and Ojos was locked in bens room forever =( but he's ok, he is always hyper.  Now that I think about it, I can sorta portray what tommarow will be like...  12:00 - Leave 3:10 - Approx arrivial time 4:00 - The Actual Game Time 5:20 - Games 80 minutes 5:30 - Half time is ten 5:36 - give or take stoppage time 5:40 - actually start to leave 8:50 - arrive home  Yeah, so thats my day tommarow, and fortunetly, this is my last away game. We have another game tuesday home, and then next week on wednesday. The season is almost over! I am both sadden, yet relived at this, but more relieved then anything. but I must sleep, ill ttyl g's. peace  mur

      The last few days were intense!  Wednesday was a beutiful day. The sun was shining, and it wasn't too hot either, nor was it human, and it was the perfect day to go outside and do stuff.  I just sat outside, and fell asleep reading =)  it seems to always rain when i have soccer, like on thursday. Practice was alright, Ryan was there and we mainly worked on free kicks and corners.  Jeff drove us also, so now we don't have to wait for dad to talk and talk and talk...  When we got home, thats when the fun began...Mom wakes me up at midnight and apperently the alarms went off, and she got all paranoid -_-' wutever. But then we went to school today, and when it was over, the skys were so freakin dark, it looked kinda cool, but the staff made us go back inside, since they were scared of everything.    Yeah, so today is friday, and I have to clean my room today, because we are doing house cleaning all tommarow, and then i will be gone all sunday for a soccer game in midland. so comment if u want, because im leaving now.

      Man, this has been a rough weekend, but it was fun n games, If I can say the least  On friday, I went to mur's, and we had an insane halo party. We kept asking them if they wanted to change the teams because we were killing them so bad.  Then we gave them Brian,  and that evened things out a bit.  All in all, it was great fun.  Spent the night at mur's and worked with his dad in the morning. It turned out, he was selling everything he didn't want, because he was moving, so we had a yard sale.  Doug is so funny when he sells stuff.   so anyways, I went back to drews and napped. Went back to see if Doug needed anything, and he gave me an Andy Griffth box set to give to my mom for mothers day. So that was kinda cool.  From there I went straight to bens to practice.  That was fun. Everyone there likes the little kitten, chu chu charly.  Spencer drove me back to drews because I thought drew was going to the jewelry store with his dad, and then just cancels his plans without telling me -_-' so he was at grant playing hockey.  so i was like fuck, i had some time to spare, so spencer and I went to westland mall to play the arcades, went back to my house to get my amp, then over to phils to practice, but they were getting wasted (as usual? don't know) so i just went back home.  today looks nice out, but i don't think it will last.  i gotta go buy a book for sci-fi and then practice at bens again, but im hungry right now, so im going to munch on something consumable, later.

      >_  Except today Ryan came today. He is like the back up trainer when Dominac cannot show. He works us harder, but he ends practice earlier, at like 8, when it should normally end.  He is younger then dominic, so he can relate better to us.  Are next game is at Dearborn Heights.   Anyways, school was shorten for the assembly -_-'.  It would not have been so bad if it wasn't so hot.  I got home and bought a calculator for math, since i should have gotten one before. moaty needs to fall in the moat.  Im going to do math, shower, then sleep  peace out G-Units

      So far, summer has been fun. I am glad that I don't really have to worry about school anymore for a while at least.  Sometimes I think "man...i got school monday" but then...NOPE! Its fuckinsummer biotch!!  There is one thing I am wondering about....  I don't really know if I am going to be playing soccer for CHS next year.  For one, I can tell Frieds (the varsity coach) hates me, or at least doesnt like me.  plus he already has two goalies, i don't think it would even be worth trying out.  but yea, i got to mow the lawn, ttyl

      Hurray! today was the last day of school.  Im so glad, and it's cool, because the idea of summer still hasn't settled in my mind yet.  There are so many thing i wanna do this summer, so mur.  Today was only biology final, and then sci fi we just played halo.  Got a ride to drews house from dave and moaty, dave, mur, and I halo'd it up.  Then chad came, along with little dave and yang, so i left and went to wendys since i was still hungry ya kno. Then went to the grant hockey game and watched them get clobbered.  It was still fun though.  Now I'm at murs, and I'm about to go to sleep.  ERRR I still cannot find the CD with all the pictures on it. My search still continues...  well, since its summer, lets just say, i have nothing to do but be fat, so just call me or wuteve and we can do sumthing maybe.  mur

Then I went to phils to practice, and after that we went to senate, and came back to my house to play basketball and swim.  Then I went and saw I, Robot with Sean and his friends. That movie was really good, but the ending was no where near the books ending, but they have to make a happy ending i guess to get better reviews.   Now I have to find my memory card again, cause dad moves everything around to make it seem "clean".  Today I think I'm having family come over from chicago and philly to visit. How come all of my cool relatives live so far away? But it should be good anyways, so ill see everyone later

      Port Austin was so SWEEEEEEET!!! It was the greatest time I've had in a while with my family. The older you get, the more distant you get with your family, so it was nice going up there again.   We haven't camped as a family in 2 years because of mom's surgeries. It's different now, because my parents have given a lot more trust. We saw fireworks, went into town, swim on the bay, and a lot of other shit.  Anywaystogo, i removed some of the band links, because i either don't like them, or don't listen to them anymore.  I also found that fuckin CD, its at this kids house in dearborn, so I have to go get it sometime  Oscoda in five days.  but other then that, ill cya all later
