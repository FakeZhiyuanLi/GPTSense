      So I got a message from Ashley last night about the whole situation with me and Andrew.     From: ash ley   Sent: Thursday, July 22, 2004 12:06 AM To: *****************@hotmail.com Subject: RE: arrg   Tammi.  To tell you the truth, I dont think you and Andrew will ever be friends again. Things change, sometimes for the worst. You will get new friends and move on. Maybe 5 years down the road you will see him and he will wave. But thats probably as close as you guys will get.  Dont get mad at me but this is life sweetheart, take it or crumble it in your pocket, shit's gonna happen. I wish I knew what Cody meant, too, when he told me that you need to stop what you're doing. Think about everything you've done. That's as much as I can give you.  I have noticed before you have used people. You dont ask; You hang on....EVERY GUY-- That's not  flirting . Thats not a  habit . Thats just rude. And I guess everyone saw that. But sometimes you tend to ignore people when they warn you (hint, hint). Lol. Just work on those and stop talking to Andrew.   .•´  •´¨)    ¸.•¨) (¸.•´    (¸.•´ .•´                    ( ¸.´¯`-> Ashley!      Needless to say, I was just a  tad  pissed off when I read that. Andrew and I have been fighting for almost a month now, and I have been doing everything in my power to try and talk to him about it, try to make up for pissing him off, and all my best friend can say is that we'll never be friends again?  What the fuck? Where's the encouragement? Where the fuck's the "Don't worry, Tammi, everything will work out, you two will be friends again"? Where the  fuck  is my  best friend ?  To that, all I have to say is this:    Gee, Ash, I totally feel SOOO much better now. So Andrew and I will never be friends again, ever? I will move on and  maybe  see him in a random grocery store five years from now and MAYBE he'll wave? Oh, yeah, I am just SO fucking positive and happy at that  sad, depressing truth . What are you? Fucking PSYCHIC, now? Indeed, I have to practically SQUEEZE MY ASS CHEEKS TOGETHER just to hold in my  UNRELENTING RAYS OF SUNSHINE AND HAPPINESS .  Yeah... not asking, being rude, and ignoring hints are on my Top 100 List of Things To Work On Not Doing Anymore. It's ON THE LIST. I'm getting to it. And I'll stop hanging on guys from now on. In fact, I'll also shave my head, wear acid-wash jeans, date Anne Hesche, and get tickets to the next Lillith Fair concert. Also ON THE DAMN LIST.  Let me tell you something-- I may have pissed off Andrew a little bit, and yes, maybe it will take some time for he and I to warm up to eachother-- but DON'T YOU DARE go and say that we won't ever be friends again. Don't you fucking say that. I have been nothing but nice to him ever since it happened; I have tried to talk to him; I have tried to pay him back; I have tried my hardest to get all this bullshit over with, and now the only thing you have to say to me is don't talk to him?  FUCK YOU .
