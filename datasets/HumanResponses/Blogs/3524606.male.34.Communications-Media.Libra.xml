      PemBLOG - PemBLOG sekelian,  I had a friend. Had a friend. Had.  Now the friend is a foe, or at least I feel like I'm being treated as a foe. I'm not invited to go out with the group when she's part of the entourage, even to visit an ill friend.   We've gone from being very animated hellos and chats to single-word responses, and now to absolute silence.  My fault? I like someone. And the friend thinks that I'm making a huge mistake by doing so. And does the friend tell me about the reservations? Noooooooooooooooooooooooooooo.  Tell everyone else but me. Everyone else. Italy's not that far. Tell all and sundry but me.  Wait... did I use the word friend? Isn't a friend supposed to help?  Defined by The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language (4th edition, 2000):   A person whom one knows, likes & trusts. A person whom one knows: an acquaintance. A person with whom one is allied in a struggle or cause: a comrade. One who supports, sympthatises with, or patronises a group, cause, or movement.   I knew this friend, I liked this friend, I trusted this friend. We were acquainted, yes. We were allied in a struggle and a cause. This friend was indeed a comrade. We supported each other, we symphatised at each's problems.  Ohh... I get it. Past tense. It's passed.  I wrote a note to this friend once of a saying I read somewhere: "A true friend walks in when the whole world walks out".  I wonder why the friend chose to walk out. If I did something wrong by liking someone, then tell me. We were comrades. Acquaintances.  Actually, I tried to reason with this friend some 3 weeks ago. Then for 2 weeks it remained one-worded responses. Then I gave up trying.  Am I proud of my current stand on the issue? No. I could be a big man if I approach the friend (again) to clear the air (again). I could be a nice man if I let my feelings of being left out and sidelined be disregarded, and continue to befriend the friend.  But I am not doing so.  So kill me already.

      Bloggies,  Here's an article I wrote in October 2002. It deals with that "reality tv" issue. Please lah... is anything ever real on tv anymore, with the exception of ASTRO News....?   DEATH, WORMS & CRYOGENICS  In most religions or cultures, a dead person is buried six feet underground after the last rituals are performed. What happens thereafter is anybody’s guess, but I suppose one thing is for sure; you’d end up becoming a meal for creatures that actually live underground. Worms.  Call me a wimp but I hate worms. Worms are the reason why I never took up fishing, much to the chagrin of my dad, brother and uncle. I mean I know worms, like any other creature has its roles to play, but hey… I don’t need to play the supporting role do I?  So it astounds me to see people actually agreeing to lie in a tub and have what must have been 50 kilos of worms poured over their bodies. The prize?  US50,000.  That was on last night’s Fear Factor, another one of many “reality tv” programs that have been churned out by tv-dom in the Land of the Free and the Brave (that’s subject for another day, by the way).  Come on? To prove fear is not a factor?  For US50,000 dollars (if you get through the other two stunts), you get to experience what happens six feet underground, after you’re dead and buried. While you are alive!   My guess is that if you die and experience it, the prize would be even greater; you get to meet The Creator himself. Surely you can’t put a price to that?  Think of what you can talk about with Him, questions you can ask!  Like why did He not make the most popular girl in school ever notice you? Or like why did He give Bill Gates the idea for Windows and not you? How come you ended up with a wife that your mother did warn you about? Or why did He ever put the idea of singing into Bjork’s head? And of course, why did the chicken cross the road?  A great man once said two things motivate people. The pursuit of happiness and avoidance of pain. The guys who went through the experience last night felt pain too. “Does it bite”, asks the host. “Yes”, cries the contestant.    Excuse me, but you’re supposed to avoid pain.  That’s the real reason cryogenics were invented. You think the guys who pay an arm and a leg for cryogenics were looking for immortality? Come on. Get serious.   After a few years of high school you think you’ve had enough. After a few years married you wonder why you did it. After three months in a new job you’re looking at options. Get real. All these people who hide behind the immortality excuse just wants to avoid them worms. They don’t want to live forever. After 70 years surely you start to think when’s my time gonna come.  As for me, I’m eight months into my new job now. Let’s see. Have you got the classifieds?

      Bloggies,  I have travelled a fair bit in my 35 years. Crossed the Atlantic, South China, been to countries picking up pieces of war, countries that have moved ahead.  Yet in the countries that I have visited, I have never quite seen marriages being bandied around like a festival. I have seen ceremonies which make the wedding seem like a festival yes... but being touted like a festival? No.  It's school break again, and a week has passed. Wedding invites are the norm around this time. My parents typically receive 10 invites over a two-week school holiday period.  Mind you, the 14 days of freedom for our children mean only two weekends. That's four days, unless of course we have a public holiday during the 14 days.  At 10 invites over 4, the odds of my parents going to each of these invites are drastically reduced. So the plan is if there are date clashes, which inevitably happen, then my parents would go to the ones that only invite them, and one of their offsprings would represent them to invites that are extended to   Abdul Razak Bahaman  dan keluarga.   But hey, this entry is not about the many wedding invites that we receive (for which we are truly thankful. Amin!).  This entry is about how these lovebirds display their ceremonies at each junction that leads to the location of their festivity.  What's wrong with that, you ask? What's wrong with showing guests where to go and to ensure that they don't get lost?  Nothing wrong, but did I ask you where your wedding was going to be held Mr. John Doe? Did I ask you to show me the way?   Of course not.  Yesterday, at the Kerinchi exit of the Federal Highway towards KL, I saw six placards of wedding directions happily posted on the pole of an unsuspecting road sign.   Six. One above another, some done with creativity and effort that would put some graphic designer in ASTRO to shame.   Each carried two names, obviously of the bride and groom (hmmm... to see one with three or five names would be dandy. "Majlis Perkahwinan Kadir & Rosnah, Noraini, Muzlifah & Kartini". Polygamy!)  Some of the placards have the sticks of  bunga manggar  pasted on them for distinction.  My point?  First, we have laws in this country. The last time I checked, anyway.  You cannot put public notices of the sort without a permit from the local authority. It has to come with insurance, and if you're tagging on an existing structure, the written permission of the rightful owner of the structure must be presented.  But then again, enforcement in Malaysia is a joke. It's always the  tidak apa  attitude.  Kao tim .   Second, if you didn't invite me then can you PLEASE not tell me where you are going to hold this grand wedding of yours?   As my friend would say,  please lah .  You did not invite me (for which I hold no grudges because I don't even know you), and yet you show me the way? Taking this further, let's say you decided not to invite that distant relative Makcik Timah because you hate her guts for telling you off when you dropped out of school to  main muzik .  How would she feel if she saw your placard? On the same note, how would your other friends that know of your big day but for some inexplicable reason (to them, that is) never made it to your invite list?  Third, you've already paid an extra 1 sen to the printers to put the bloody map on your perfumed card, so why do you have to put the placard up? Not confident of you mapping abilities?  Fourth, and perhaps finally and more importantly, the shady characters of the society now know that you're getting hitched. The house will be full of well-dressed people bedecked in their finest garb and jewellery.  Great robbery target! You? The unwilling accomplice!   I think all these people that sell their weddings liek a festival should really keep their joy to themselves. Hey, I'm happy you're buying the cow instead of just buying the milk at the corner store, but please.   Leave me out of the festivities. If you want me to attend, then invite me properly.  I don't need another headache. Or another wedding for that matter.  I'm taking this to the Parliament. Maybe they can sort it out.

      60604608am  Blogland,  Are human emotions so complex that it can lead people to:  a) make irrational decisions? b) not being able to make decisions?  35 years ago, whenever I feel hungry I'd cry and hey presto... next minute I'm sucking a teat. The decision I made? Cry.  So can we say that human emotions are not complex? Well, I guess when you're a baby incapable of doing lots of things yourself, things are a lot less complex than if you were 35 years old and hungry. I'll get back to why being hungry at 35 can be complex in a little while.  First, are things really less complex when you're younger. My guess is hell no!  You cry when you're a hungry baby and in effect what you are doing is transferring the complex decision making process (which includes emotional assessment) to the adults.  Is the baby crying because he is hungry? Is he in pain? If he is in pain, why? Is it colic? Why? Is he in need of a diaper change? If yes and I just changed him 5 minutes ago, is he suffering from diarrhea? If yes, why?  And the emotional decision making process goes on and on. For the baby, he'll just pass the complexity to the adult. This supports my other theory that we actually were born smart, but then get too smart for our own good as we grow older. But that's a topic for a different forum on a different day.  So we can say with conviction then that the human emotion is indeed a complex issue.  But why would being hungry at 35 years of age be a complex issue?  First off, since we have established that the human emotion is indeed complex, and we have suggested that we get too smart (read: dumber) as we grow older, then at 35 anything would be complex! At 53 it would be a catastrophe!  Here, listen.  You're 35, at the office. It's 10:27am and you're hungry. At the same time, you know the cafe is open, and on the menu today are two of your favourite meals.   You are working on an assignment which is due by noon, and the only reason why it's not even half ready yet is because trying to do it meant dealing with a totally different set of complex emotions!  So if you go and have lunch at 10:27am, you could end up:  a) eating alone because everyone else is not hungry b) running the risk of not completing your assignment, which could affect your promotion and increment c) having to decide on one of the two meals that is one the menu d) falling on the way there and break a leg or worse, die e) choking on the food that you took the time to decide on, and end up a vegetable all your life or worse, choke in front of the girl that you've been trying to impress since the beginning of the year f) spilling food on your new suit g) doing the opposite of all of the above   Ho man! Life's tough!

      Blogdom,  Have you ever noticed that time changes EVERYTHING? Yes, everything.   My friend was telling me a story on how a year ago, at around this time, he was on a delayed honeymoon with his then wife. It was a good honeymoon by most people's standards I think. They had a good rest from their work, they were on an island, they snorkelled for the first time, they ate and ate and ate, had karaoke, read books, made new friends.   A year on, my friend, Am and the now ex-wife are fighting for scraps in the Syariah courts over a marriage that went sour some months ago.   At her wife's request, my friend granted the wife's wish to leave the marriage. It was on a fateful October 13th 2003 when Haza, the wife asked to leave the marriage.  Am's work day ended normally enough. At about 10pm he called home to ask Haza whether she wanted dinner.   Their professional lives really left little time to eat at reasonable hours. It was almost always packed food.  "I feel like KFC, want some?", Am asked.  "I share you punya ajelah okay?", she replied.  And so it was, when Am arrived at their home in a suburb in Selangor, he sat himself down in front of the tv. Haza was on the two-seater sofa, reading.  She sauntered down to the floor, and Am fed her the chicken as he had some himself. They talked about something as they ate, more often than not it would be her day at work, and how disorganised her team was.  After the meal, Am went to the kitchen to clean up. Then he sat himself down on the three-seater sofa across from where Haza sat.  Then he asked her the question that had troubled him over the whole week.  "Are you happy in this marriage Haza?".  She seemed stunned. As usual with Haza, she took a while to respond, and the response was expected.  "Why do you ask?".  Am then related to her incidences that led him to ask the question. Like how she would leave the family hall in the house into the bedroom to go to sleep, without so much as saying goodnight. Or how she would leave their table at a restaurant without telling him, to go shopping.   There was another incident a few weeks earlier. After attending lectures for a part-time course she was signed-up with at a local university, Haza found the front passenger window pane broken.   She promptly called Am to relate the incident. Am was aware that she had to attend an event in Sunway that evening.  "Right, you drive up to Subang where I'll meet you", Am said. "You take my car, and I'll tend to replacing the pane ok?"  Haza agreed. They met at the appointed place, exchanged cars and proceeded to each other's destinations.   "Until today, you have not asked me where i got it done, at what cost and you have not even thanked me", Am said, maintaining calm.  There was a long silence after that, which is typical Haza. Am was quite used to this. He'd wait for a while.  Then he asked, "Why?".  A little more silence then she muttered, "I don't love you anymore".  "And what do you want to do now?", Am asked very calmly, almost knowing the answer, really.  After a short pause, Haza muttered, "I want us to separate amicably".  "And by that you mean divorce?", Am enquired.  Am's question was one of those that you ask out of momentum. Her statement "separate amicably" could only mean one thing.  Haza nodded, the Am stood up, walked across to her and said, "I will grant you the divorce. But please file the papers".  Some three months later Haza still had not filed papers. Am finally did, on the grounds that Haza had verbally asked for the divorce.  On February 16th 2004, Haza and Am were divorced, exactly 2 years and 2 days after they married.  And two months later, Haza filed three separate claims totalling some RM35,000 from Am, including a RM20,000 claim for  muta'ah . They've had two arbitration sessions since the claim was filed late April, and another set for June 14th.  So much for love.  That's about all the time I have for tonight. If you want to know more, perhaps I'll write some more as Am relates it to me.  Regards.

      Dear Fellow Bloggers,  This is it, my maiden entry into blogdom.  After listening to Sheahnee Lee brag about blogs, and listening to her charming friends at Ash's birthday party some weeks ago, here I am venturing into the world of blogs, with trepidation and excitement.  My aim? Just to lend a voice to my thoughts, for the world. I may not write well, but I write to satisfy only me.  If you like it, tell others. If you don't like it, tell me.  Regards.

      Bloggies,  Here I am, back again after a long, long lull, dictated by my body's natural decision to shut-down after abandoning care for the gift from God (to me, of course, not to women LOL).  Anyways, in days to come I shall be writing again. Here's a preview:  # A Tribute To Reed Shamsudin: a colleague leaves, and I consider him the funnier of us. A good journalist, oft misunderstood, with a gift of the gab in certain genres.  # Update on Haza & Am: The Haza & Am saga is updated with a new development.  # Soulmates Are For Real: How I discovered my first-ever soulmate. I never believed in the concept.  So if you want to catch up, join me again soon.  Meanwhile, here's a thought:    "If what you did yesterday seems big, you haven't done anything today."    Warm regards.  Amir Mahmood Razak
