      Hey, I just realized that to blog on this site would require everyone else to jump hoops in order to comment, which i have already stated I hate, so "good bye blogspot"  Do not expect to see anything more here from me.  I couldn't put my adoring fans through that.

      So, I have already said how much I don't like having to jump through hoops just to comment on somebody's blog.  But, look, here i am with a brand new blog of my own just because I wanted to comment.    Perhaps this is a good thing.  Maybe I should divest my interest in Envision's website and give it back to Davin?  We'll have to see.

      So i like the privacy of this spot.  I know the concept of bowing to blogger and "logging in" every time you want to comment or anything has been prohibitive for me, but I like the hoop jumping now.    A little distance is a good thing sometimes.

      Well, i like having my own place.  Especially  such a quiet place.  Not much to say today.  pretty sick of the tears thing.  But, oh well. saw   about a boy   last night.  That was a fun movie.  I've got one for tonight but I think I'll go to bed.  gotta work in the morning.  Babysitter is flaking out on me.  Wants fridays off.  At the outset said fridays were a work day. I wish I had a good alternative.  But. . .that really cheeses me off.  anyway gonna pee, gonna read, gonna sleep.  and hop back on that hamster wheel tomorrow.    Yee-Haw.

      so, here's the deal.  I've been thinking about divesting at envision and moving my blog here.  i think i will do it, but not tell anyone.  So here i'll say whatever I want.  No one will ever find me.  I fucking depressed.  It follows me around like a cancer, like a smell.  I might shower but it always comes back.  I might find some diversion, a movie, a friend, but I can't run away from this fucking disaster of a life.   I am so sick of crying and not being able to answer the question, "how are you?  How're things going?" and I can't figure the damn thing out.    I can't pray.  I can't guess what this fucking beast wants or else I'd give it.  Right now.  I wish I could tell someone.  I need help.  Oh my God.  Is there anyway out of this?  Dan's talk about God's will just makes me think I need to handle this on my own, that the will is revealed in the word and whatever is there goes.  I've set up a meeting with Paul on Monday.  I don't know why.  I don't know what else there is to say.  I really want to die.  If I could without scarring my girls I would do it.  And I don't give a fuck if that is narcissistic.  I'm past caring.  So I suck, big fucking deal.  I always have sucked and tried to fix the suckage.  Who gives a shit, now?  I want to die.  I'm past being useful and over being a good friend.  I just maintain for my kids.  and I'm losing the ability to do that.  Can anybody help me?  can anybody hear me?  Fuck me.  The ship's going down, man.  Who cares?
