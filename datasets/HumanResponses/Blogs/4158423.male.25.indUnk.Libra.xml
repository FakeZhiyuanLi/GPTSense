      At Calvary Grace Nazarene Baptist Elementary School we had an average of about 15 students a year. But, there was a core 14 of us that made it through most of the 6 year tour of duty. Everyone's names have been changed to protect the innocent.     Dirk O'Shanahan- Typical Alpha Male of the class. He consisted of not only being the pretty boy, but also the bully and all around asshole to the rest of the guys. The definitive son that would make a Dad proud. Good at sports, not stupid at all, and all the girls liked him. All the guys wanted to be him.  Peter Conrad (or Pip as we called him)- The smartest kid in class other then Katja and I. He was an awkward blond haired kid that wore lumberjack shirts and blue jeans. Misfortune seemed to follow him everywhere. As for activities, he seemed to be quite the book worm. He was always reading, but yet he was adaquate at sports. The girls didn't seem to pay much attention to him though, he was kinda hard to figure out.  I always wanted to get to know him more, but it was difficult being that young.  You know?  I wanted to be as smart as he was so badly, and it seemed like it came so easy to him.  Ronald Ronaldson- The definitive tall slow guy. He was always much taller then everyone else, and definately the slowest as well. He also had several emotional and mood disorders that would cause him to cry uncontrolably at the drop of a hat. He had every learning disability in the book,  it was so bad that he had to wear purple tinted glasses.  Which were supposedly for his dyslexia.  He had a horrible home life, and lived with his grandma.  I remember him dreamily talking about his Dad that lives in Tasmania, and about the terrifying Tasmanian Devil.  We used to think that he lied about this, but now looking back, I don't think he was smart enough to have come up with such a complicated story.  I tried to hang out with him for a bit, but I found that I just felt sorry for him.  Tyrell O'Brien- One of the only african-american (or black as they used to call him back then) kids in the entire school. Lived in a very hard part of town and showed it in every way. He also had severe emotional problems, causing him to cry a lot as well. He was good at sports but horrible at school. Our Moms worked together at an HMO clinic 2 doors away from school. I hung out with him once at his house in Compton, but I was the only white kid, and didn't really know what to do.  He constantly fought the discrimination that came with his lonely position of being one of the sole black kids in the school.    Rusty Pollack-  The all around good guy.  Rusty was the quintessential all american boy, you know the type.  The trouble maker with a heart of gold sort of guy.  Rusty was my best friend for a long time.  I basically lived at his house for quite a while.  But again, there was something that just wasn't there for me.  This grew more and more apparant the older Rusty and I got.  Until finally one day, like so many other sets of best friends, there is nothing.
