      Left office at 3:30pm and headed for SAFRA Country Club for some boring 'Team Building' events. Most pple are not looking forward to it. In fact, many pple are either on MC or 1/2 day leave. Most likely trying to 'SIAM' the boring telematch. Why should it be called telematch when it look more like a tekan session?  let me explain the thingy u need to do.  Caterpillar Walk  Tie ur legs with your partner, and the 'middle' leg tied to the pair behind you. forming a 16 pple long caterpillar. Walk frm 1 end to the other.   Sponge and Water  Untie yourself, then 1 pair at a time, soak the sponge with water and put hold the sponge on the head and walk back to the other end. Squeeze the water to the bottle.   Polo Sweet and flour  The most stupid station where u put ur head into the pail of flour in search of the tiny polo sweet, which u will use a pocky stick to hold and go to the other end. Then u pass the sweet to another pair using pocky stick.   Balloons  Nope, we are not done yet. Once everyone finish getting their face filled wif flour, they come back and blow balloons. Then carry as many as they can to the other end in a pair, with a balloon in the middle.   Spin with a cup of water  I'll consider this the most well designed station of them all. Spin 5 round and walk back with a cup of water on your mouth. (most of u will fill giddy and spill the water on ur body)  And there you have it, the amazing tekan session. Anyone still reading???  Team building, can never be complete without cheating..... Team cheating in fact. Its where the whole team comes together and cheat as a whole. Come on, we are alredy adults, why would we still wannna be tekan by u all willingly?   so here how we cheated......  Before the match started, go to the flour, find all the polo sweet and place them in the middle so u will not need to dig too much in the flour.  Hold the sponge with 1 hand while walking. With the hands behind, nobody can actually see it.  Find extra water and pour into the bottle.   Tie the balloons with a string so that u can hold many of them together. (not really cheating, this is call clever idea)  Count extra fast when spinning.... there is a judge tat also do the counting. but their counting will be messed up with your counting.   And there you have it. The Amazing cheating.  Well.... i guess everyone cheated 1 way or another.  Telematch will be quite boring if everyone goes with the book..... right?  oh, btw: we got 2nd place.  After that, it was bowling.  It must be years since i last touch a bowling ball. And they put me as the first bowler in my team.   Everyone was looking as most lanes are not ready yet. So i concentrated, look at the pin and rolled the ball towards the pin. somehow or rather, the ball went towards the pin very straight. and with enough strength. as it get closer to the pin, something tells me it's going to be a strike.... and it was indeed.....  everyone cheered.... that was the 1st strike of the day (someone before me manage to do a spare) For a moment, i was enjoying the cheers from all around me, it was like as if i'm a super star or the hero for my team. the feeling was great.... but then that feeling doesn't last long...   for the next round, i wash the drain 2 times. hahaha.... the 1st strike was kelong lark..... what do u all expect? I haven't bowled for years and i played bowling for less than 10 times....  well in the end i got a low 83 marks  still not tat bad..... haha.

      There are always things tat u don learn in the books which tutors don teach where there is no written material on it..... and the onli way to know, is thru experience....  everytime when u see the recurits section, most company would be looking for maybe 1 or 2 yr experience..... have they every wonder.... why don they give those without experience a try? after all.... if everyone don give them a chance, how are they going to gain experience???  okie, long blog short....  i need more experience.....

      headache for the past few days over that issue..... it's getting worst after doing that chim chim excel spreadsheet... i should add "Experience in handling large spreadsheet" in my resume.  Something interesting from eric today. there could reallie be something wrong with my SQL query. wrong as in, the performance is not good. for the 1st time, i heard tat there is actually a proper arrangement of which table come first and which come 2nd..... and if i were to put the table in the other way round, it would perform better.....  now..... is it because of this tat cause the problem? okie, maybe it does have performance issue.. but i'm sure it can't crash a server....  come to tink of it.... if the server is so easily crashable, isn't it something not good?

      a huge headache....  I should be more calm..... learn to relax and take thing easy. but i just couldn't control my emotions..... this shit is too much for me. so much so that I need painkillers last nite in order to sleep.  keep checking my emails to see if my boss replied. Either they don check their mails during weekends or they wanted a face to face talk instead. I'm looking forward to tomorrow, when i can talk to them face to face. I cannot just sit there seeing my name being pointed out as 1 of the cause. I din do anything wrong.  was trying to find info on web abt selecting on huge database table. remember telling my buddy that if the thing exist, u can be sure to find it on the web. but this is an exception. i suppose this case is too unique. don think there is any write up on this......  so i decided to turn to asking pple in the forums. SPUG.net forum. where i always feel there there is a big group of talent from all walks of life. where u can get info on the most powerful torchlights to the latest news update. surely there would be someone who could answer my question.....  while i din get a definite answer, most of them are sure that a select statement, no matter how huge the table is, will not be able to crash the server.   too bad there isn't any confirmed write up on the net that i can qoute to my boss. but they do boast my knowelge on sql..... and i'm quite sure that i'm correct all these while..... select statement can't crash a server.....  i will fight back to clear my name..... sql is my strong point in office. i cannot let these stupid consultant put the blame on me and destory my reputation for being good in sql. i will not sit down just like this.....   i will fight back..... i must fight back......

      Shouldn't had open my office email. But I couldn't resist. Wanted to see if there were new happening. I tot there won't be any..... I wish there isn't any..... but there was a email that make me so angry that tears actually flow down.   It's from the director, telling everyone what happened that day and she also attached the report. My name was in it. I'm labelled as 1 of the person who cause the problem that day.   I blew up. That's it. I'm not going to hold back. Actually intended to write to my boss wif regards to this matter yesterday, but decided to drop the issue. So i took out the email i wrote last nite&nbsp;frm the trash bin and add more words before sending to my boss. My name need to be cleared. They can't simply put the blame on me when they can't find the real cause. if they can't find the curprit, just say so in the report. they don have the rights to anyhow shift the blame on me. I will not sit down doing nothing, i will fight to clear my name.   The whole issue is affecting me too much. decided not to attend my cousin's wedding dinner today. the director email has added more headache to my already tired brain. i need to break away...... bring me to utopia..... to where everything is so perfect.....

      anger..... that is the 1 word tat can describe me.   let me tell my story which i have no chance of telling my boss. few weeks back, our database adminstrator (DBA) made a big error by copying wrong data from 1 server to another. This cause error in all the records for 4 days.  As a result, i'm arrowed to do an extraction in the database on all data for those 4 days. the table is very huge, few hundred thousands of records. We don have any index key to aid the extractions. all we know is that whatever record added during that 4 days will have error.  So I wrote the sql statement which select the data that were added for those 4 days. If you know SQL, u would know that searching huge table without using index key could take several hours. but we are left with no choice.  But as I was writing the script, my colleauge notices that the database server is very slow. So i didn't run the script after i finish. I waited till around 7pm when the server is back to normal speed and i excute the script. knowing it will take several hours, i went home hoping to see the result the next day.  When i came back the next day, my script wasn't completed and was killed by dba. argh.......  then my friend frm other dept told me that yesterday's slow down of server is due to some pple doing huge query. can't be me, cause i did my query after the slowdown. until i saw the incident report that was being submitted to the director, did i know that my name is in the list&nbsp;of pple who did huge query that slowed down the server.  but the server slowdown was at 5:30pm, i ran my query at 7pm. it can't be me. and my query has the 'where' condition, unlike some other query which is without the 'where' condition, just selecting the hundred of thousands of records.  this is so unfair. the dba did the scan thru the database after the server slowdown and got my user id. surely it's not me tat cause the server slowdown. yet my name is in the report and i have no way of explaining myself.......  and if u look back to the top, i have to do this stupid extraction because of an error commited by the DBA, and now i'm being bitten by the DBA for doing correction mesures for THEIR error.  is the world still spinning in the right directions???

       few days back, our RC members come all around the block distributing the flag. THEY EVEN HELP YOU HANG IT. okie, so our MP is coming this area this national day.... so they must beautify the place nice nice to impress the MP.  my block is maybe the MOST PATRIOT BLOCK in singapore now. wif flag flying high outside every unit. but I'm just wondering, do i need to hang the flag to show that i love singapore?  I served my NS without chao kenging I report for my ICT when the SAF100 come. I contribute my skill to the country to make singapore a better place to stay. I am loyal to singapore, and i'll report with my FBO if some joker wanna invade us.  so why would i need to show everyone i love singapore by hanging the flag? hanging the flag doesn't mean u love the country. not hanging the flag doesn't mean u don love the country.  i rather choose to show my loyality thru a more meaningful action.   hanging the flag takes 5mins. is tis mere 5mins enough to show your loyality and patriot? if so, loyality and patriot has been devalued to something that anyone can do in just 5min a year.  I don need to hang the flag to show my loyality. my daily action will show my love and care for the nation.  and yet the words of the RC member still lingers in my mind.... "Hang the flag to show your love and loyality for the country"  yeah..... as if loyality is so simple.....
