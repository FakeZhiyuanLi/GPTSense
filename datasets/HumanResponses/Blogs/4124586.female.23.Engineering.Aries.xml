      Okay  Pearl Jam fans  out there....I have a special and priveleged opportunity to get pre-sold tickets to a Pearl Jam show at the end of September. Because I'm a Ten Member I get dibs on tickets before they go on sale to the public.........SOOOO I need to know if anyone is interested in coming on a trip to Boston to see my favoritest band in the whole wide world on September 28th (I think that is the day). If soooooo please let me know as soon as possible cause the day for the pre-sale of tickets is coming up quickly.

       Some of these lyrics sort of encompas what I have to say to a certain someone out there...you know who you are. Read between the lines.    32 Flavors -- Ani DiFranco  Squint your eyes and look closer I'm not between you and your ambition I am a poster girl with no poster I am thirty-two flavors and then some And I'm beyond your peripheral vision So you might want to turn your head Cause someday you are gonna get hungry And eat most of the words you just said  Both my parents taught me about good will And I have done well by their names Just the kindness I've lavished on strangers Is more than I can explain Still there's many who've turned out their porch lights Just so I would think they were not home And hid in the dark of their windows 'Til I'd passed and left them alone  God help you if you are an ugly girl Course too pretty is also your doom Cause everyone harbors a secret hatred For the prettiest girl in the room And god help you if you are a phoenix And you dare to rise up from the ash A thousand eyes will smolder with jealousy While you are just flying past  And I'll never try to give my life meaning By demeaning you And I would like to state for the record I did everything that I could do I'm not saying that I am a savior I just don't want to live that way No, I will never be a saint But I will always say  Squint your eyes and look closer I'm not between you and your ambition I am a poster girl with no poster I am thirty-two flavors and then some And I'm beyond your peripheral vision So you might want to turn your head Cause someday you might find you are starving And eating all of the words that you said

      Yeah this job blows.  I'm bored out of my head and my butt still hurts. Hence...bored and bummed...hehe.  Joking.  Actually I was thinking about school...this will be my final year at good ol' UNB (Thank God), but I can't help thinking about what a drag it will be if I get into a job that ends up being as boring as this. I've worked at Lepreau, I know what is out there. I need something fast paced, something that will keep me interested and motivated....or I'll just get lazy. Sigh. Don't know if I'm excited to get back to school or not. I want to finish I know that much....and just thinking about that little iron ring on my pinky gives me butterflies in my stomach. Worried a little bit about Plant Design (for all you Non-Chem Engers out there....my senior project or Thesis...or whatever you wanna call it). I wonder what its going to be like, wonder if I'll be smart enough to do it....wonder...wonder...wonder.  "I'm not asking for a response to this...I'm just sending this cosmic question out into the void.....so...Good night sweet void"  Betchya can't guess what that quote is from....hehe.  Anyways, I suppose I'll tdry to find something interesting to do. See ya. Krys

      Man oh man my ass hurts....and no its not because of carnal pleasures (you dirty pigs).  Having a broken ass is definitely the worst thing EVER! You can't walk properly, everytime you sit you ache, and bathroom visits are hell. Sleep is non-existant because everytime you move, the stupid thing twinges and gives you a nice electric-pain shock that rips through your dreams nothing like a noise or a someone breaking your window ever could.  Buttache. Not headache...buttache. Its my new coined word. Yeah, think I'll buy a patent....

      Yeah so I'm never going to joke about  Friday the 13th ever again. Everything was going fine, I was having fun...going to a party in a couple of minutes....and then.......................................I stepped outside to go to the cab. Yes that is when everything went awfully, awfully wrong.  I stepped out onto the top step of the porch and I was gone. Yes gone.......down the steps on my tail bone. Yes my tail bone.  I now can barely walk, sit, go to the bathroom or  ANYTHING with out being in excrutiating pain.  Have to go to the hospital to get an x-ray now.

      It is pouring like crazy out there!!! Maybe we're getting the tail end of those storms that are supposed to hit Florida today. Its Pissin'!!!  I've been sitting here for about an hour waiting for a lull in the down pour so I can load my car without getting drenched, but no luck.  Weather is such a strange thing.  Wow, I just bought a new bra and its amazingly comfortable. Its really hard to find a nice comfortable, but sexy bra for a girl with my bust. Usually I get the granny bras with the straps the width of my wrist and that ugly beige colour. BUT this one is black and sexy AND comfy. Quite impressed with myself for finding it...and with the bra for all its wonderfulness.  Going to a party tonight. Is going to be super fun. Normally when I go  home for the weekend for parties they are at my girlfriends' house and its usually just us females...then we venture to the Mile afterward. But THIS time its a friend of a friends party....with BOYS....SCORE!!! (In more ways then one....BWAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!! JJ)  Welllllll I suppose I should stop wasting time and do something productive....like make myself something to eat.  Cheers, Krys

      Just realized today is Friday the 13th...  Does that bother some of you? Doesn't really bother me...I'm really not that superstitious though...although I'm the type of person that believes in Extraterrestrials and that sort of thing.  Did you know the origin of this superstition was because the Scandinavian's believed that the number 13 was unlucky due to the mythological 12 demigods being joined by a 13th, an evil one, who brought misfortune upon humans? It was also said that Christ was crucified on Friday and the number of guests at the party of the Last Supper was 13, with the 13th guest being Judas, the traitor.  Trivial trivia for you. I think its silly myself.  BUT you know what is kinda strange.....when I drove in this morning there was a dead black cat in the middle of Windsor street.....WooooooooOoooooo.........  Now that's a good Friday the 13th....black cat in the middle of my path to start out my morning.  Maybe this weekend wont be as good as I thought. Hehe.

      Well today is Friday....Thank God. It's supposed to rain all weekend (Boooooo!) but that doesn't mean I can't have fun. I'm going home to SJ for the weekend...do a little partyin', maybe a little family time.  ACTUALLY, one of my favorite plays/movies is going to be presented by KVHS this weekend..."Jesus Christ Superstar". I'm very excited. I'm going to try and convince my mom or dad or someone to come with me. Yup.  I've got so much stuff to do today. My dad wants me to bring him a bunch of stuff that he has stored at my apartment down this weekend. So I have to go home and drag it out from the crawl space, load it into the car and then drive home....think I might skip out early to get everything done. PLUS since today is payday (YAY!) I have to go to Tony's Music Shop and get my vocal books that I ordered like 2 months ago.  Oh by the way T if you want to bring laundry or something with you that is coooool.  Well suppose I should go to work. See y'all on the flip Krys

      Soooo tired. I have  a very bad habit. Sometimes, when I read books, and it starting to get late I think "Okay I should go to bed now considering its 11:00pm but I'll just read ahead a little just because I want to know what's going to happen next...only a few minutes". The next thing I know its 1:00 am and I'm still awake.  So silly I am (My Yoda impression).  I'm feelin' pretty blah today. It's definitely one of THOSE days. I did about an hour of Yoga last night but I feel like I copped out on myself a bit. I really should have done some more exercise last night. If I wanna get skinny I've gotta get some determination and motivation. Well every skinny little arse that walks down the street gives me determination to lose weight...but I'm somewhat lacking in the motivation department sometimes.  You know what I had for supper last night? A bagel and Mr. Noodle. Now that if that isn't super healthy I don't know what isn't (NOT!).  BUT I did have an enjoyable time downloading some new music to my collection...and I've found a new love. Her name is Ani DiFranco. She is absolutely Grrrrreaaaat!!! (As Tony the Tiger would say). Her songs are gritty and beautiful at the same time and her lyrics make me want to laugh out loud and just marvel at her imagination. I really enjoy some of the recents I've downloaded...like Untouchable Face ("Fuck You" to some), 32 Flavours, and Falling is like This. ALSO I've found a new Jazz love....Billie Holiday. Amazing singer...man I would LOVE to do some serious Jazz songs. If I were on Canadian Idol (and NO mom I've NOT auditioned) I would simply say to the world "I ain't no pop star but I'm going to sing what I want and hopefully broaden your appetite for some REAL music" Then I'll sing my heart out with Ella Fitgerald's "All that Jazz" or "Angel Eyes" or maybe Billie's "Stormy Weather". Then maybe I'll get into some Norah and some Tori, and do a little Evanesence to sate my Rock appetite, with a little Ani and another new friend...Poe.  "Johnny...Angry Johnny...this is (this is)...Gisabelle in Hell (Johnny)"...You remember that one?? Well that is Poe...and they have some other songs that are better.  So me and all my girls will be hanging out on the Canadian Idol stage and if the audience don't like it they just don't appreciate GOOD music. Fuck all that Brittney Spears, Christina Aguileura Shit. That's what I say. I'm not into no Pop or Soul Food....give me some Jazz, Blues, or Rock or even Folk and I'll be a happy lady.  That is what is so STUPID about Canadian Idol, its a big popularity show. If the veiwers don't like your music (even if you're fabulous) then you're fucked. You gotta be skinny, pretty and love Pop music. PLLTH!!! :P  Anyways...that is my rant for the morning...now I've gotten myself all worked up and I'm hard up for some real tunes in this joint. Shit. All well...I guess I'll have to make myself a "Chillin' with Chicks" CD with all my faves for tomorrow. *sigh*

      Stop the presses....that is what I said!!! Pearl Jam...you wanna hear the news I've heard?? Well for those of you who aren't part of the Ten Club (unlike me of course) or don't visit the PJ website often...I'm here to tell you that Pearl Jam will be doing a couple of concerts (6 to be exact) in October for the "Vote for Change Tour" to promote voting in the US. No shows are really close to here but if you really want to know about the dates and the places go to  urlLink www.pearljam.com  and you can read all about then  Also there is a rumour that the band will be going back into the studio this winter....Also their manager was hinting about some additional shows in 2004.....ISN'T THAT EXCITING!!!! It is for me....YAY!!!!  So I'm now going to send you off with a loverly pic from my collection (which is a lot) of PJ photos. Have a good one!!! Krys

       To the tune of Hotel California....love the Bean sprout line...HA!   On a dark woodsy highway, Cool wind from the shore, Warm smell of exhaust fumes Rising up through the floor Up ahead in the distance, I saw a pick-up truck, My head grew heavy, And the fog rolled in, I had to stop for the ducks!  There they were in the canoe I smelled the ducky smell And I was thinking to myself This could be heaven or this could be hell.... Then he handed me a duck and he showed me the way.. There was quackin' everywhere I thought I heard them say:  Welcome to the Quackial Exam Headquarters.... Such a lovely place, gonna get to first base... Plenty of ducks at the Quackial Exam Headquarters Any time of year, you can find us here...   So I picked up the fat one..  And I flipped him upsidedown "We haven't had that spirit here, since nineteen eighty nine" And still the quacking went on from dawn to dusk.. Wake you up from the day dream Just to hear them say:  Welcome to the Quackial Exam Headquarters Such a lovely place, gonna get to first base…. Livin' it up at the Quackial Exam Headquarters What a nice surprise (what a nice surprise),  look between our thighs…  Their Butts facing the clouds Pink Pee-Pees pokin’ out…. And one said “We are all just prisoners here, does it look like a bean sprout?”  And on the shores of duck butt land… They scattered to get released I ran around with my arms about But I just can’t catch the beast  The last thing I remember I was straddling a fat duck I had to find the little pee-pee And guess what, I am in luck…. Relax said the duck man They are used to this abuse You can go home any time you like But first you gotta check that goose…  ..Quack quack quack!!!!!!!……..

       This is an email I recieved from my friend Naomi today and I thought it was way too funny not to share.     So, as part of my job I am supposed to give workshops on duck banding. Now to me this doesn’t sound too bad. I mean ducks are so cute and the idea of dressing them up in pretty little bracelets is adorable so I take my boss’s suggestion to get some experience and I get in touch with the local duck banding guy. I ring up the number and the gruff old guy tells me to show up at 6 am sharp.  “If I’m early I’ll wait for you, but if you’re not there by 6 I’ll band the ducks and leave”.  He says this like he already expects me not to show. Like it is some unavoidable trend of all women. I make a note to self – Note to self: Don’t be late.  5:30 am. Shit it’s early. But I’m not going to be late. I throw on my rain slicker and some rubbers (I actually didn’t wear rubber boots, I just like saying rubbers) and some clothes obviously (clothes first, then rain suit, then rubbers) and am at the marsh at 5:55. Damn I’m good. But where is the gruff old man? His truck is there, but no sign of him. Wait, what’s that noise. Oh, here he comes in a canoe. In a canoe with a box full of ducks. Aaah. Cute little duckies!  He steps up on shore, ducks and all, and gets right into the duck banding explanation. “You grab the duck around the wings so it can’t fly away on you” he explains. “ Then you turn it upside down and hold it between your knees. Check it’s wings for blood feathers to see if it is this year’s duck, then determine the sex”.  Um….excuse me....did I hear right? I’m supposed to be able to determine it’s sex? Do ducks have dicks? I’m very confused.  “Just pull back the tail feathers and take a look. This is called the Quackial exam”.  Did he just say Quackial? Ha! Too funny! I'm laughing in my head, but I have a heavy feeling of dread in my heart.  So I find myself sitting on a bucket with an upside down duck between my legs, tail feathers pulled back looking for a penis. Is this really happening to me? Am I really checking out a duck butt? Really? As it turns out I am. I even find a penis. Wow! I am so proud of myself. I really am.  “It’s a male” I cry, accidentally shuffling my legs in excitement and dropping the poor sexually assaulted bird on its head.  “Oh, crap! I’m sorry sir I’ll get it”  So now, I’m running in circles chasing this stupid duck which quacking ridiculously and is obviously really pissed off. I'm sure it thinking in it's little brain "Oh ya? I'd like to goose you!" (Ha, ha! Get it? Duck butt, duck butt, goose!) And I’m also sure gruff old man thinks I’m a just a stupid girl, but do I really care at this point? No. No I don’t.  “Hum”, he says. I guess we’ll have to work on that.  N

      Well good morning everyone. I'm feeling p-r-e-tty good about myself today. Did lots of exercise last night and even if I can't see results yet, I still know I'm doing SOMETHING towards my goal.  I've been eating better, trying to do exercise and a little yoga, and drink more water.  Now I know what you're thinking..."God if she drinks more water she'll never be off the toilet" but I know that drinking more water = losing more weight...so even if the penalty is that I'm visiting the porcelin goddess more often, it will be worth it to wear a size 9. Plus water is good for you right? Good for the skin, good for the bladder, good for EVERYTHING. I never used to drink ANYTHING during the day. I'd have a glass of milk in the morning and sometimes something to drink at night and that was it. Now I'm up to about a litre a day (which is super good for me...but still only half of what I'm SUPPOSED to be drinking).  Now I know this entry is pretty boring...but really, this blog is more for me than anyone else. Its kind of a little pat on the back for myself...you know...good job Krystle. So too bad for you guys.

      I've got a message for all you out there in Webland....if you ever come to NB and you want to go camping at a nice place and still have some fun (as in sitting around a campfire until late listening to someone play a guitar)....DO NOT go to Fundy National park...especially Chignecto.  On the first night we only made it to the park at about 10:00 and were all starving and had to put up our tents. So at around 11:00 (which is supposedly quiet time) we were cooking burgers and talking around the campfire. About 10 mins later we were being told by a park warden (very rudely I might add) that we were being too loud and he would kick us out of the park if we weren't more quiet. So we talked lower, and about 20 mins later  TWO  wardens had come a long and told us that if we didn't get in out tents and go to sleep they would kick us out of the park. Now seriously, we were NOT being that loud...we had just got to the park FGS.  The next day we actually had a warden come and tell us at  7:00  that if we weren't quiet tonight we were going to get kicked out. SEVEN O'CLOCK!!! Can you imagine! We seriously were not impressed at all. I mean we weren't being that loud, and we had come to relax and talk and eat around a campfire...thinking that Chignecto was the less strict campground.  It was not even that they were telling us to be quiet. We didn't mind keeping our voices down, it was HOW they were telling us to be quiet and the accusing tones they were using...when we know we really weren't being that loud. All in all, I would NOT recommend ANYONE to go to this campsite....I know we'll never go back.  Other than that though we had a good time. We let all the SHIT slide off our backs and enjoyed ourselves. We went on a hike to Laverty Falls, which was beautiful and a couple of my GF went for a dip in the glacier water at the bottom of the falls (the nut bars). We had lots of good food, lots of great company, and an excellent guitarist to make the trip a success. Next time we'll know to go to a little more obscure camp site is all :).  Anyways, that's my blog for this morning. Hope y'all have a good one.  Cheers, Krys

      Why is it that when you are trying to find someone you never can??? And why is it when you finally have some work to do you can't because someone either has something that you NEED to do the work and has disappeared, or you need them to finish something so you can do your part.  I hate office jobs. BLAH!!!!!!!!!

      Isn't life funny? You sit through your day of mindless work, you go home and walk your dog and cook your supper and then all of a sudden you have an epiphany....Life ain't that bad.  I mean sure, you've got enough celulite on your ass to feed a foreign contry, and the guy you love doesn't return the favor....but really...what is so bad about coming home to you're dog and a good book??  Getting a dog is the best thing I could ever have done. Yeah its a pain in the ass trying to find people to babysit, and sure it sucks when you can't go on an all night drink fest with your friends cause you KNOW he'll piss on the floor...but then there are the good things...like always having someone to cuddle with when you are watching a movie, or those times when he does the funniest thing when you are really feeling like a piece of poop.  I'm one of those dog-mom's who will take a whole roll of film of cute and stupid poses their dogs do...ask my friends...they've seen them.  To tell y'all the honest truth I wouldn't give my baby up for nothin'...nope not a million bucks. He's a girls best friend....even if he is the devil.  Oh and a quick hello to the iceprincess....nice to hear from ya....and congragulations! You are the first non-mother post I have gotten on my wonderful blog! You win.......well nothing....sorry.  Well guys I know this was a very sentimental moment...but I had to do it. Hope you're done puking.  See ya on the flip. ~Krys~

      So I was a little wary about creating my own blog site...I didn't know if I was interesting enough...and I mentioned this to someone who will stay un-named for safety's sake (but you know who you are you  red -headed- blue -eyed-sometimes  grey -eyed butt head) and after deliberation this un-named person (who I've seen naked) said that I was right...that I  am  uninteresting...and that I really should tell you all about my serious and top-secret back ground.  So for the sake of being interesting....here it goes. Now you can't be alarmed....eveything I am about to tell you is true. Absolutely. Guides Honour (sort of like Scouts Honour...but for girls).  I..........  am................  A super villian. BWAAAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHA  Shit. Well I've said it....no going back now. My secret is out.  Hey wait! Where you going!!!!???? No seriously, I'm telling the truth!!!!  See look ^ I even have the evil laugh!!!  What are my powers you say....well I have an inhumanly convincing voice. Yes its true...with just one note I can have you eating out of the palm of my hands....or convince you to give me sexual favours...or even........KIIIILLLLL you. BWAAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!  I'm an evil lady I tell you. My evilness sometimes even shows when I'm my mild-mannered self. Yes...remember that time when you asked if you had brocolli in your teeth and I said No ...well....I LIED!!! BWAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!!!  And remember that other time when I told you that I'd be at the party at 8:00 sharp....well I came at 9:00....and you were too drunk to notice....BWAAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!!  And remember that other time when we were shopping and I told you that outfit looked super on you??? Well...................................It did....I guess I wasn't evil then...all well....THERE WERE OTHER TIMES WHEN YOUR OUTFIT SUCKED AND I DIDN'T TELL YOU!!! BWAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!!! I can't think of any at the moment...BUT I'M SURE THERE WAS!!!! BWAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!!!  Anways...that's enough evilness today. I'll point out that if any of you breathe a word of my secret....to anyone....I'll have to kill you. And I'll like it. BWAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!!!

      Working at home is greatdiddly-ate-ate-ate! Much better than slaving a way in the sauna that is the office at the University. But the bad thing about working at home is that there are so many distractions....like novels...and cookies.  Speaking of novels, I'm currently reading an interesting series that I'd like to mention to all you weblanders. Now don't get me wrong, I'm a fantasy/sci-fi buff...all the way, but I've learned that it can be rewarding to broaden your horizons when it comes to books. I was very bias at first, thinking that no other genre but fantasy could hold my interest but I'm currently reading a love story (which of course has a little paranormal lining to it) about historical Scotland. It's the Diana Gabaldon Series which starts with "Outlander".  A synopsis of the story line is this lady from 1945 gets wisked off to 1700 Scotland through the stone circle in Inverness called Craig na' Dhun. She gets back there, falls in love (which is a pretty griping passion I might add) and has all sorts of adventures. I know one thing...it sure caught my attention.  I'm currently reading the 4th book in the series "Drums of Autumn" and must say that the whole series is definitely a  Hard Cover Buy . Very good.  Anyways...since I AM supposed to be "working at home" I should get to the working part.  So Cheers for another couple of hours... May be back a little later... ~Krys~  NOTE: By  Hard Cover Buy     I mean that I would buy the whole series in hard cover...even though its so expensive...and considering I'm a poor lowly student that means I think they are PREEEETTTTYYY gooooood books.

      Ugh. Another work day. Wednesday is probably, almost, the worst day of the work week...except for Monday of course. Hump Day. Why the hell do they call it that anyways....it reminds me of those "Nature of Things" shows that show turtles, lions and every other god-forsaken creature on the planet doing  IT . Do we really need to see how big a horses Woo-woo gets!? I mean common...just thinking about it makes me wince. Sheesh.  You know, I find short work weeks seem a lot longer than a normal work week. Maybe its cause I had  that four day long weekend and laid on my ass for the whole thing. So now that I have to get up and actually GET DRESSED (*gasp*), its a big chore...so it makes the rest of the week seem to take forever.  Anyways, I sssuuuuppppooooosssseee I should do some work considering I'm here. I know, this wasn't very exciting. If I get enough energy later -- given that I'm not permenantly glued to my chair from sweat and grossness on this humid, hot day -- I'll write another posting....maybe one that can grab my attention...let alone anyone elses.  SO have a good one...I know I wont. ~Krys~

      Well...my first blog....what to say...or what not to say...that is the question.  First off I'd like my first official message, that I send to all you out there, is a great big CONGRATS to my Bestest-Cousin-in-the-Whole-Wide-World Tara on her recent engagement...knew you'd probably be the first. Hehe. Remember....cookies and cream are a girls dream. HA!!  Now for my  own  official news...I'm hoping to keep this blog updated with my nonsensical thoughts and drivel that I see fit to tell you -- mostly about music, movies and books. And for all my chem eng friends out there...I'll be keeping an update on all the goings on at UNB for the Chem Eng Society (which I might add, I'm a part off....little pat on the back).  There'll be lots of Pearl Jam, Harry Potter (yeah I know I'm a geek) and some definite Fantasy novel opinions....which I hope y'all will comment on.  Still new at this stuff so as I get a little more proficient at the art of webpage construction, hopefully I'll have some useful, interesting and just cool links, that I find, posted on this page.  Anyways...its flippin' hot here and I'm all gross and sweaty...and a little hungry... So I'll see ya on the flip. Have a good one.  ~Krys~
