      Well... Later today, after the first post I made. My family and I went to go see that movie "Spiderman 2" that just came out. Happens to be that my aunt gets sick and we all have to get home. Not like I really care or anything, but damn, I was out for 3 hours expecting a fucking movie! Where the hell is it?! Who the hell knows now. They said they'll take us to see it tomorrow... I won't care by tomorrow. -.-' I was waiting all day for my girlfriend too man! She came online about 10pm her time, she was cleaning the whole time.. *hopes she's not a neat freak* I can't clean that damn long! xD I'm sorry but its true.. Is it bad to always dress in black? My aunt wanted me to change into something else because I was in all black man, I didn't but damn, she don't need to say it like its something bad. Well she really didn't say it, it was more like from her to my cousin to me. >:( Bastards confuse me! This things pretty cool though man, don't know much to put, but I try. :P Anyways. I'm out again. *poof*

      Well. I don't really know what to put. Maybe after something happens today I'll put something, ya know? Oooooooo! I know what to talk about man... Those movies I watched last night. "The Last Samurai" and "50 First Dates". Don't wonder if they were good or anything, BECAUSE THEY WERE! >_> Erm.. Yeah... But they were great man... If you ver happen to watch "50 First Dates" imagine me being Adam Sandler. When he falls in love, not lie to tourists though. >_> If this thing doesn't put dates on them, then I'm going to have to... By the way, this is my first blog thing. Thought it would be cool to check out. Ya know, you could use a blog to write stories about something, I just realised it! Your own fanfic or something you created, and instead of posting it on some other site, you could blog it. And all your friends can read about it without having to go through a bunch of crap... or something... >_> But ya, later.

      Have you ever felt like there was a peice missing from you? I'm more then sure all of you have.. And when you find that special someone, it all goes away and you feel whole. You feel like your ontop of the world! I love that feeling.. sadly I've recently lost it.. And now I'm lost.. She was everything to me and its so hard to try and hide the emotions inside.. I feel so lost and cold.. worse then the feeling before I had her... When you find that person who completes you, then you lose them.. You drown, and choke to death... Thats what it feels like for me atleast... I'm slowly losing my life and can't stop it, but I'm trying my best to avoid being sad.. I'm trying to look happy atleast...   The weirdest thing was, it was a net relationship. You'd think one wouldn't care or get so attached.. Well I did... I had to be with her man, she made me feel so good about myself.. She made me feel so special and I was going to move where she lived soon.. Now I'm stuck in my little circle hoping for what happened to be nothing but a dream.. Some of you probally think guys shouldn't cry or whatever but sometimes we can't help it.. I loved this girl so much.. and I still do.. and I don't know how to prove it though.. I don't know how to make her happy anymore, and I don't know how things got like this... I just wish it was all a dream..   I love her, and that'll never change... she knows who she is... *blows her a kiss*

      So what if I forgot to come work on my blog?! I've been busy! Hell, I'm leaving for florida on friday, then soon back to NC. Damn I'm sunburned like hell though, yesterday was the happiest day for me, and its still going, I don't know why, but it is. I had some cool dreams last night too. Don't ask what they're about but I'll remember because I usually do.                                So yeah, my life has been pretty much busy and full of shit but thats normal. I need a new computer man, maybe I'll get one whenever I get home or something, and I've got a headache like hell... I need to go eat breakfast so yeah, I'm cutting this one off right now. *poof*

      Nothing to do... sitting here looking at the empty pc screen, and then I look over to the window and imagine how cold I am.. I look down at the ground and imagine how strong I am.. I look back into your eyes and realise that I'm weak and shouldn't be here.. But I am and theres nothing I can do to change that... I wanted everything to be simple but its not.. its all complicated and I have to deal with it..   Away from that subject, the company that was coming over did, and her kid aswell.. I'm waiting for something to happen, but it seems like its going to be like every other day.. shit... I'm going to get an mp3 player today and have all my mp3's burned to discs... Finally, right? I wonder what else I should do... nothing? Maybe we'll end up going to the movies, this way I know I did something today... I'll come back later and write some more.. -gone-

      Like the title says, thats how I feel. My girlfriend's best friend's brother and cousin got into a car accident earlier today, I wanted to put that along with my sorrow and hope for them not to be injured to badly. I'm sitting here, and if any of you who are reading this IRC, then you should know about mIRC. Well now I want to make a bot thats like a casino and crap, but at the moment I'm too lazy. And of course I got a girlfriend but she's not online so I'm pretty damn lonely.. *misses her* I don't know what else to put so I will just leave this where it is and come back later to add another one. LaterZ. *poof*
