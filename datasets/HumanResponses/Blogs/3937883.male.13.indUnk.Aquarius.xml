      SHORT.... was the saga of the greatest american band of all time, Nirvana. Consisting of Kurt Cobain (lead vocals, guitar) Krist Novesilic (bass guitar) and Dave Grohl (backup vocals and drums). The world was shocked when on 4-8-94, kurt's body was found in his garage with a shotgun wound to the head. http://www.thesmokinggun.com/kurt/kcincident1.html. Some of Nirvana's greatest hits (smells like teen spirit, rape me, and lithium) would never again be sung by kurt cobain. His death has always been a mystery. Some people claim it was a suicice, some thought that Courtney Love killed him. My theory is that at the time he was killed, he was high on twice the amount of lethal cocaine, and he was not able to pull the trigger. But kurt was in a very depressed state, and Courtney loved him very much... The reason he was on these drugs was because he had an unexplainable stomach pains, even the doctors could not solve. The only way the pains would go away was wen cocain was administerd to himself. He eventually found a pill that shut down the pain, but it contained high levels of cocain.... hooked again. Kurt did not want to live the life of a junkie so on 4-6-94, he ended his life. Both Dave and Krist have gone on to establish other bands, like the Foo Fighters and Sweet 75. But, give this moment to remember the life, tragic, painful, but smelling like teen spirit.... of Kurt Cobain                       - Steve Sullivan
