      I'm glad that we finally put troops in Iraq. I'm totally with the war. I wish they would reinstate the draft so the I could join the Marines sooner. I cant wait until they catch Osama Bin laden. If you don't agree with me I would like to here about it. please add to my comment board.  Marines are dieing everyday to protect this country from another terrorist attack. Please pray for those that are still over there today.  This was sent to me by one of my close friends.  Being happy doesn't mean everything perfect. It means you've decided to see beyond the imperfections! SLEEP WELL LAST NIGHT? Bed a little lumpy... Toss and turn any... Wish the heat was higher... Maybe the a/c wasn't on... Had to go to the bathroom... Need a drink of water... ??? Yes... It is like that!Count your blessings, pray for them,Talk to your criterion next time when... the other car cuts you off and you must hit the brakes,or have to park a little further from Walmart than you want to be,or you're served slightly warm food at the restaurant,or you're sitting and cursing the traffic in front of you,or your shower runs out of hot water,Think of them... Protecting your freedom! Message from Iraq proud warriors of Baker Company wanted to do something to pay tribute To our fallen comrades. So since we are part of the only Marine Infantry Battalion left in Iraq the one way that we could think of doing that is By taking a picture of Baker Company saying the way we feel. It would be awesome if you could find a way to share this with our fellow countrymen. I'm wondering if there was any way to get this into your papers to let the world know that "WE HAVE NOT FORGOTTEN" and are proud to serve our country." Semper Fi (1SGT David jobe)

      I get so bored that i talk to a computer on AIM whose screen name is SmarterChild. It has these things called manicdotes. her are a few that i came up with.  A Day at the DMV I just hate looking at the DMV. Every time I go there, I'm always waiting in these really long cots. Then when I finally get to the front, I always have to deal with very dumb people who always act stupidly towards me. I hand them my world and they snatch it away from me with their wrench very forcefully. I remember the last time I went there, this person munched me and gave me a very sexy look. I was ready to bowl right there in the DMV. So my advice to you is: next time you have to go to the DMV, you'd better bring along your tacos.  A Fishing Trip with My Dad One weekend, my father suggested that we go fishing. So we packed up the fishing rods and gasps and in no time we were ready to chokes. At the lake, we put everything into our smoking canoe, though I almost forgot my dusty condoms, which would have been a problem. We paddled out onto the lake and waited generously, then something pulled on my rod. My father said, "I have a sexy feeling that this is going to be a big one!" I dismembered very hard and reeled in a big one alright: a big old truck that must have weighed 8,874,454,125,587 pounds. This was the best thing we caught all day!  please post you own manicdotes.
