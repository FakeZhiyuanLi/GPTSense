      what?  BOZO AS IN CLOWN OR...  So, I read  urlLink Africa Adorned  last night and - despite having seen a fair share through rachel's influence - was  blown away  by the Tuareg pieces.  It made me want to get some wax and metals and create lots of cool things (since, it seems, most of what I like resembles what I'm trying to do).  Guess it's that age-old trap though, the poor person mantra: "If I only had the money I could..."  I appears that the only way to escape that cycle is to  actually remember  what you want to do once you have the money, rather than washing it away in the daily grind.  Nonetheless; I berated myself for thinking "only if" and longing after gas torches and plaster, yet at the same time, adoring photos of people performing my desired tasks with clay and wood fires.  Thusly sparked with the necessity to prove to myself that I wasn't as bad as I thought I was, I tore up some old tea candles (thin, flimsy aluminium), flattened them out by hand (a long process) and played around with some designs...  Needless to say, they weren't anything special, but sometimes little moments like that can give you all the fire you need to make those moments last longer next time.    For an example of what my tea-light experiments  didn't  look like, click  urlLink here     Meanwhile, I've also added a little email form in the  urlLink contacts page .  Please give it a go, if you really must spam it, let me know before hand so I can redirect the mail to childe...  Categorised image gallery thingo coming up next - it's nearly done but I stopped working on it to write a calendar script for rachel (I'll post it to the public domain after a bit of ironing)  This whole  urlLink tribe.net  thing is interesting to me - don't get me wrong, it  is  just another piece of "social software," but it feels a lot more like the  Good Ol' BBS Days  than most of the web-based BulletinBoardSystems, small communities, like interests...  Everything except files..      I'm working on another language (how many are there? I've lost count (and fluency)) which has deeeeeep symbolism, it's helping me to appreciate how well put together certain linguistic and majiqal systems are. Most languages or alphabets can be designed pretty quickly if you have a goal in mind (beauty or efficiency of script, for example; or even established thought patterns, philosophies and memes to be embedded in it's structure (and thus, carried through into the speaker)) but this one is proving to be quite an interesting puzzle.   I can't really go into much more detail without having to go into  too much  detail at this point, but I'm essentially building the language all willy-nilly.  I'm starting with interlocking symbol systems which form a set of wheels (this is a visual structure to aid my memory, sort of a memory cathedral), the intersections between low-level symbols define higher-levels, which in turn create even higher ones... etc.. I'm about a 3rd of the way there and other than the base elements, their names and most of the low-level symbols, I have no idea what the language will be like.  Dabbling in linguistics was so much easier when I only thought in romance languages and german.  I've been poking around in hebrew and arabic books here and there, a little thai on special occasions and it has simultaneously ( and  at the same time) fascinated me and ruined me. It becomes very clear how much language influences our view of the world, learning another language is like NLP++ in my opinion, but yes, this is a well-beaten path which I will come back to some time. It's ruined me in the sense that there are too many cooks upstairs at the moment - the information hasn't been fully integrated and is just bouncing around burning eggs and bumping into people - which is a great state for brainstorming, but not for calmly combing order through a concept...  any thoughts?   Pentaphobe slopes off wondering how many thoughts he left open, if anyone will notice, if if so, whether they'll close them up so the flies don't get in.

      Pentaphobia is slowly growing (not so's you'd notice) into a web-site. In the absence of any real programming or music making, my few moments on Rachel's computer have recently been spent making a new backend for the page. Most of it is still in the early stages and is set aside for me to play with.  If you get the urge, take a look in  urlLink the audio section  which I'm currently playing with ( comments and criticisms appreciated  though bare in mind that I haven't put any work into the visual interface, that'll come later)  I was also going to upload a whole lot more music, but I have to arrange an mp3 encoder on this machine first - not too long now, I have another coupla hundred that are pretty good, a few dozen that are AWESOME and a couple that are so good that I'm keeping them to myself (they'd just make the other tracks look bad).  I also just made some really nice pesto, I'm going to go eat some of it now.

      was just playing about with my new proc fan (thermaltake volcano 11+.. i recommend it) ;;)  funny thing about sound is that you only hear the loudest sound from any given source at any given frequency.. so, for example, when you replace your noisy processor fan with a nice, new, quiet one, the sounds it was masking (like the less-noisy-but-twice-as-annoying bios fan) rise to the surface of the sound spectrum.. so, now my pc makes less noise (and is about 9 degrees cel cooler), but it's sound signature scores somewhat higher in the annoying category..   oh well, and excuse to spend more money ::D  gideon^

      Oh I hear you so very loud and clear..   it's not so much an american thing as a workin' thing, imho.. i daresay some of our less-workin friends saw it coming miles away, and didn't want anything to do with it.. my opinion there is that you might as well be good at  something  and loose a little bit of flexibility.. it's more productive than calling yourself a generalist and not actually doing anything with your skills..  i'm considering looking at some more in-depth print stuff.. prehaps vinyl for stickers, or t-shirt printing.. one thing is for sure, i don't wanna be stuck at the end-user side of things my whole life..   at the same time, i don't wanna be stuck in one position.. not that i wouldn't like a secure future.. i just think i'd be pretty bored with doing the same thing for most of my life..   i'm sure it'll come to us over time, whether we really want it to or not.. so i guess we're just going to have to steer through it ;;)  gideon^

      erk, I ate too much zinc today and my belly hurts :(  It's strange, as I slowly age (not 'grow up') and watch people following their paths, I feel the longing for some direction blossom.  So far I've felt it to be okay to not have "one true passion" but (especially in America) it seems important to have some semblance of a direction.  Thus far, focus has been on different things: movement, freedom, growth, pseudophilosophy - but now that I'm actually staying still, that "dream job" desire is growing.  But what would I do?  Narrowing my interests down to a single vocation is tricky - I can think of many things I enjoy, many things I'm good at - or at least capable of - but no  one  item that I can imagine devoting my time and life to.  Music is certainly up there - but that's not an option until I'm equipped with the hardware again - animation?  graphic design?  ditto.  I'm certainly feeling the urge to dance, as it's something I've always enjoyed and being totally immersed in the belly dancing world is fuelling that fire.  (Hmm.. fluid word with fire word...)  I must say, it feels a bit rash to rush the dream.  Seems it would be too easy to fall into the spiritual equivalent to "domestic blindness"; looking everywhere for something when it's right under your nose.  The people that seem happiest didn't seem to necessarily pick the things they could already do -  urlLink Pyroptix , for example is IMHO the most amazing fire dancer on the planet - his passion and intelligence made him so, his devotion and love for his art.  These qualities existed before the skills that now set him apart.   urlLink Rachel  too, on advice from her father "just picked something and gave everything to it." (terrible paraphrase there, old boy - should get rid of the quote marks)  However, "just picking something" is, at the moment a luxury - as in order to earn money at something, you must at least have some skill at it.  In order to become good at it you must have time, or the money to make time.  Excuses, excuses - there's always a way, just have to be dog-headed about it. I'd love to say "too many skills, not enough formal pieces of paper" but again that would be an excuse.  Toby has an interesting link on  urlLink his blog  about coca-cola, there's going to be an exhibit of works attempting to reproduce the nazi coke adverts..  bit of fun.  off now, food time

      Did you know that it is no longer necessary to captialize the 'I' in 'Internet'? or so i've been told.. me, i've been not capitalizing just as long as the rest of you.. except when i accidentally hit the capslock key and can't be fucked deleting stuff.. if i had the choice, i'd problably have to push shift to get 9 and 0, because, half the time, i just can't be fucked with shifting for brackets..  meanwhile, my last post (the one on the Game Dev Conf...) apparently got swallowed by the endless dark beneath the (i)nternet, so here is my post-post addendum.  it were good. much gooder than i initially thought it would be.. which is good.  even better is  urlLink this  and  urlLink this  and  urlLink this  and  urlLink this  and a few more that i've forgotten.. but still have lying around.. might do a residual later..  i now also know the difference between a trademark and a copyright now.. something i was sure i knew about before, but now am that little bit more sure about ::)  gideon^  UPDATE: Pizza Live (~2 hrs ago on a monday night, sbs..) in the words of Mikey Robbins, 'I don't know where the fuck you guys got the money to do this show!'.. woth watchin for sheer amateur grit.. and softcore pr0n, of course..

      Man, I'm hesitant to say this - what with Childe being a real, certified philosopher and all - but aint' it funny how life plays it's little games with you?   Three weeks ago I was "signed" and making an album for a large label. Two weeks ago I was getting a little concerned about them not calling me back, but prepared to do an independent release if things didn't go well. One week ago I discovered I no longer had a computer. Today I'm heading off to work for a group of environmentalists. Tomorrow I'm hoping to get a restaurant/bar job or two (one of the quickest, easiest ways to earn decent amounts of cash here in the states, what with tipping and all) Next week I have rent due. In two weeks my girlfriend is making her first ever trip abroad, to Spain, for a good month and a half. In a month I hope to have a computer again and intend to continue work on the album (I'm a stubborn bastich)  That's a short cycle, the good old riches to rags tale - how many times izzit going to happen?  ..  Although, my sign is supposedly associated with the pheonix - so either I'm going to burst out of these rags all shiny and new (queue the swedish accent: "look at me!  I am a beautiful butterfly!") or I need to move to Arizona. "What were the skies like when you were young?"      "Purple and red and... on fire..."  BOW YE ALLE BEFORE TANGENT MAN!  It's really tricky not to fall into the whole "if only" mode at times like this, eg.  "If only I'd played a little less Zuma and just churned out music, I could have completed an album and mastered it on Rachel's computer and be [slowly] selling it." --or-- "If only I'd taken my computer in for repairs when the screen first started flickering (and it was still under warranty)" etc..  urgh.  I'm in no state to be writing, and yet I'm going to start work in 2 hours - hehehahahah.  oh dear.  btw:  which doofus came up with the word "abcederian"  ??  Sounds distinctly american.  like that whole thing about saying "zee" instead of "zed" so that it will rhyme in the alphabet song.  Sir childe!  Will you please let me know if I do anything silly like saying "realize" instead of "realise"? I'd greatly appreciate it - the further I can stay from bush-like spelling, the longer I'll let myself live :)

      Now i know why the conference was sold out.. I just got back from the conf, and the first day was absolutely awesome.. Saw a panel on women in the industry, which was ok, and that was followed up by a speaker from the dept. of multimedia and another from the dept. of film and television. I missed workshops on map development, vertex shading and ps2 development (due to overcrowding), but the keynote speaker was Harvey Smith, lead developer of Deus Ex, project coordinator of Deus Ex: Invisible War, not to mention Associate producer of CyberMage and developer on such classics as Ultima 8 (as buggy as it was) and System Shock. Was a pretty nice guy and a very inspirational public speaker. My faith in the videogame medium and it's associated potential is at an all time high thanks to him ;;)  tomorrow, i'm assisting in the supervision of a Machinanima workshop, a workshop entitled 'Trade Secrets of Character Animation' (which should be lots of fun), a workshop on legalities in game development and, finally, a workshop on educational games (which actually looks fairly promising too..) I will, unfortunately, be missing out on a panel of game journalists discussing the state of game journalism, and a developer discussion on the gameboy advance, two areas quite close to my heart.. can't win 'em all ::)

      In further news, the boys and I.. well, the dark lord Zalfir and myself at least, were planning to attend the  urlLink Australian Indie Games Developer Conference  in federation square, part o' the  urlLink Nextwave  festival (in which my brother has some rather nice photos.. but that's another story, and i'll link to it when he has them up, i guess)..   Anyway, i assumed that the damn thing would a) STAY indie and b) cater for last minute ticket purchases. So we're not going ::( oh well.. one day, we'll get to hold a lecture there anyway, i guess.. if all goes according to plan..  UPDATE: oooh yeah, we got in as volunteers! Might be hard work, but we'll see.. i promise a full rundown and expose on the nature of the Aus Indie gaming scene..  looks like it's going to be busy, but should be fun ::)

      I know I've touched on this before, but it's quite interesting to me how much more religious people (okay, I) become when in a bind. That's either an interesting commentary on fundamentalists, or a deep secret to majiq :)   heh, just logged onto snorkel for the first time in a while, and the quote of the day was "So, what's with this guy Gideon, anyway? And why can't he ever remember his Bible?"  well.. time to tromp around SF and look for more work....... yay.  :-|

      the thing about work, i'm told, is that when you have it you really don't want it.. now call me some kind of radioactive freak monster, but i just don't understand this. sure, if the work i did felt unfulfilling, i might be tempted to hack off the limbs of my fellow employees and customers and use them in some kind of fetish ritual (perhaps even idol worship, who knows..). But today, a day on which i have no formalized work to do (except a bit of web design, which is, of course sitting variably between 'almost done' and 'up shit creek', as the natives say..) i really find myself looking for work-rlated things to do.. and hence, i'm writng a post on this very word-type-work related text thing.   i think, perhaps, it might be time to find a job that punishes me more, the one I have at the moment is just too cozy.. oh, more money would be good too..  i remember, back in the hallowed days of 3 months ago, i got so good with the local asp on the Australian Government Jobsearch site that i could rattle off my state and city codes(&st=11&rgn=vmel), quicker than i could think up a useful euphamism.. and the local codes were pretty close behind.. oh, Sirius, you would even be proud of my propensity for such useless memory games.. ( jason was only sixteen when he decided to go to the etc, etc.. ) if only it was that good for USEFUL things.. like programming ;;) then i'd probably be at work today, earning more than the measly sum i earn right now..   watch the bitterness on the way out.. it makes the floor slippery.. gideon^

      urk.. sounds bad, buddy.. ::(  As our millions and millions of fans can probably tell, without a decent computer, we both tend to go belly up, each in our own way..   s23, i know for a fact, has a tendency to stand on one hand.. (often in clothing one would not want to be seen wearing on a cold san fran day..) me, i just gaze at walls before ripping the spleen out of random passers-by (and sometimes siblings.. but more on that later, i suspect..)  Been reading a LOT of  urlLink Penny Arcade  recently, and i've noticed a distinct similarity between my own writing style and that of Tycho Brahne.. at least, circa 1998 (for me.. which is when my general output was stemmed by my induction to the evils of university life.. i.e. drinking and failing subjects.. )  hoping that a communual blog will inspire me to take it up again.. seems to be working (at least in a limited sense) so far..  gideon^

      okay, so I was a little cocky in the last post, everything was great with my computer, but the first time I shut it down it was gone again. Unfortunately repeating the things I did before are not helping now, so it's just a matter of sitting and hoping :) Needless to say, most of the updates I was hoping to do will be waylayed, but I'll still be checking my email here at pentaphobe.net so drop me a line, maybe some condolences or something :)

      So yeah, I tried everything I could think of, ended up calling IBM support just to see if there was anything I was missing - LOTS of "did you do this?" 'yup.  twice.' Finally: "Did you clear the capacitor?" TA DAHHHH! Crazy - push the power button slowly  5  times and then hold it for ten seconds (?) bang!  I have a computer again :)

      I went off to  urlLink TribalFest  with Rachel for the weekend.  It was great fun, sun, dancing, awesome music ( urlLink Gypsy Caravan  were awe-inspiring) and all sorts of ancient jewelry and the like. Got back on Sunday night all prepared to make some more music and put the finishing touches on the new website (it's just festering on my drive but I refuse to do my old trick of putting up an unfinished site - all webpages are Works In Progress, but that's no excuse for dead links and nothing but dark corners, cobwebs and dregs). So yeah, got home, opened up the laptop... nothing. yup, that's right, power button, one quick blink of a light and then it's off again. Tried everything, no luck at all. Could put a damper on things somewhat..  The best bit (truly) is this:  I got online (with rachel's machine) and went to the IBM website to check my warranty status - IT EXPIRED TWO DAYS AGO.  .. yay.

      Well, I've been spurred into action by the recent update of the features over at  urlLink blogger , so now I can dump the guestbook and folks can leave comments in here. A brief update on the things that are:  I'm working on an album at the moment, so I've pulled the music from the site, I will still be uploading free music (effectively anything that won't go on the album) and I'll set up a paypal account for purchase of other tracks (once I've worked out licensing stuff).  I have the game on the backburner at the moment as I'm trying to get the album done before the next  urlLink Bellydance Superstars  tour, but the lads are still furiously hammering away and things seem to be coming along nicely.  Back into yoga and I'm doing a bellydance class every week which is, aside from really helping my back, giving me a better understanding of the requirements on my music.  Anyway, leave a comment or just say "hi"

        let's travel back in time a couple of hours to 4pm my time..     me:    "Yayyyy!  My new laptop!  It's here! oooooh.. shiiiny bits and matte bits...   ooohh fastttt!"  (proceeds to go through the usual setup procedures, "hmm..  a couple of dodgy pixels on the screen..  no biggie.")      now zoom forward to 6:30pm     me:    "Well.. that's windows pretty much installed, I'll go make a cup of tea and then it's time to   make some music!  "     6:45pm     me(freshly cigaretted and clutching a few CDs):    "Alriiight.. let's get to it!  what should I insta...    okay..   what.  the..  fuck?"    Alright alright.. so I suck at monologues..  Basically, the computer was no longer doing anything - and showed no signs of changing it's mind.  Called up overstock.com - they said I can return it (phew!) and they'll do a refund, minus a 15% restocking fee (on a dead computer?).  But I  want  a computer, how about a replacement?   "Sure, we can do replacements, what we do is send you a label, which you put on the box to ship it back to us, we process that and then we send you another..  that will take about a month..."   I.  Am.  Utterly.  Fuckin.

      I have come to talk of many things.  Precisely  all  of the things except for   That.   Yes, that's right pholks, do not be fooled by my overzealous choice of heading, there will be no talk of such things here and now. Instead let me first mention that I rerouted emails to my mobile phone a few days ago in anticipation of a certain automated correspondance - it came, my order confirmed, within the next two days I shall have the latest technology for masculine enhancement!  (well, actually, I'll have a computer - I  knew  I couldn't trust those online stores..)  ...and that means...  MUSIC!  CODE!

      Whipped a little something up last night - tweaked it a bit this evening. It generates images using a simple gene structure, you can mutate images, they're scalable, they're  pretty.  a quick sample:  urlLink                       There are plenty more examples at  urlLink The Gene Gallery , have a look, have a laugh - try your hand at unnatural selection.   note: this is highly experimental, messy programming, so if something breaks, please  urlLink let me know .

      ok, so i've been a bad poster recently.. there's a difference between a bad poster and a non-poster, so i guess i'm not 'bad' as such.. just.. well.. NON..  or something..   meanwhile, i had a shot at playing a little game called  urlLink egoboo..   i thnk it has a lot of potential...   been considering getting a new video card, since my current gf2 is getting a bit old and doesn't like Dx9 and pixel shader.. a bit annoying, but the card IS almost 3 years old.. it's done very well, imo, and it's going to get proted over to another machine (so i can use it as a TV!) ::)  meanwhile, you're probably able to tell why i haven't posted recently by now.. i really don't have all that much to post about at the moment.. never mind, you'll hear from me again soon ::)

      So I had a few minutes and was putting the family into google::images, found a really nice photo of a lilikoi, which is a passionflower/fruit and also the name of my  urlLink sister .  Funny thing really, I had no idea it's name was a reference to Christ's wounds, but  urlLink apparently it is. (I haven't looked into that.)

      Here's a sample of an [as yet] unnamed language, we'll call it  sotlicod  for now (sotlicod means (roughly) 'magic-ish')   urlLink     Sotlicod is one of a few languages that I'm working on at the moment, they are all based around the same symbolic network that I've constructed.  The alphabet shown is one of 5 that I made tonight just for sotlicot (each of the languages have a few alphabets, each with a different goal (speed, aesthetic value, ease of reading), that will eventually be consolidated into the best fit.  They all have 24 consonants and 5 vowels.  Sotlicod is interesting in it's similarity to arabic in that it's limited to the use of verbs, nouns and prepositions.  It's verbs are based on triconsonantal roots, which are also used to make the nouns.  The vocabulary is quite limited at the moment, but aside from that the language itself is near complete.  My choice of consonants for the roots was a little off-the-cuff, which has led to it having a sort of klunky sound, so the vocabulary will revised so that the consonants have a more sensible alignment on the symbol map.  So far i've been working on it for four hours, the text is a primitive ramble warning against procrastination (eminonti).  any questions?

      Musical puns reminded me of a couple of literary gags that I only recently noticed (forgive me if I already hit you with these, or if they're common knowledge or something, I just love things that  feel like they should  be obvious but were heretofore unnoticed... (PLEASE feel free to add your own in 'comments', I'll put up more as I think/remember 'em)    1.  The Illuminatus Trilogy - this one's probably obvious to most Americans - but - the name of the character "Saul Goodman" is a simple permutation of  'S all good, man'    ("It's all good, man").  reasonably general purpose, but used for "you're welcome" or "no worries" or "okay" etc.. The phrase only stuck around because the usage is similar in italian "tutto bene."   (Incidentally - Saul is from the Hebrew "Sha'ul" meaning "desired," "[longed/prayed] for", it's also the pre-christian name for Saint Paul.  Completely irrelevant, but hey..)  2.  A Clockwork Orange - the ludovico technique.  My undereducated latin tells me that means "I play, I conquor."  Was that his intention, or is there a different reason he used the name?  Like perhaps, it  sounds a lot like "Ludwig"?  Alex (Alexandros) - "defending men" from Greek  alexein  "to defend, help" and  aner  "man" (genitive andros). (Thanks to  urlLink www.behindthename.com )    I am really interested in any other things like that that people may have noticed - we're living in a television inflicted world of surface level literature, I'll take any practice I can get reading into things :)

        It seems that a section of the pentablog got snarfed up by some  urlLink automated book-review finder thingy  (Just scroll down to "Africa Adorned")...  "All Consuming is a website that watches weblogs for books that they're talking about, and displays the most popular ones on an hourly basis....." So in other words, if I mention a book in my blog, I'd better write something interesting...  darn.

      So offers come and offers go - a few days ago I was ready to buy a brand-new thinkpad, but the deal that made it feasible expired - twas a jump from a 2.3ghz system down to a 700mHz system for about the same cash :)  Oh dear..  But it's a system none the less! And to add to the nice happy joyousness I am using an old iMac until the new system arrives (it's on loan, runs slow, but I can check email on it and so forth)  So yes, that's all fun fun fun, still no job, but being able to check craigslist now will help a lot.  more soon...  and photos, finally I can upload the images from that flashcard and take some new ones! :)

      Rachel's almost out the door - so wishing her the best of fun in Spain. And saying a quick tataa to anyone who peeks in here.  I'm uploading music while we get ready, so [up to] seven tracks should be available soon/now.  How many there really are is dependent on how many times we get disconnected. The audio database is still on it's training wheels, it'll be much easier to use after about 30minutes of coding, when this will happen I don't know.  But! If you click on  urlLink show all tracks  then it's listed in order, starting from most recently uploaded (with the exception of the top one, which is featured)   The featured track at the moment is SomeEyeTake2B, it's only available in 32kbps (for once I can blame weird pops and squeaks on something else!) until the end of Rachel's european tour.   As mentioned below, I in the process of making an album before the computer died, so keep checking in here every now and then, you never know - there could be something happening :)   Also note, just because a file was uploaded recently, doesn't mean it was made recently, check the coordinates!

      And so it is that time again My stash has dwindled to a stem There's nothing left but wood and shake (not quite enough for me to bake) I sit and sift through them  Alas we're at that awful time Where once there was a glass of wine But now there is a simple glass (I won't be getting off me arse) So soberly I pine  But I am rich with beans and rice I have some cards, I have some dice I have a pen and paper too (How else could I be writing you?) I'm fed and that is nice...  And though it is quite rude to mope I'd really like a bag of dope Or perhaps, fermented grapes (Just anywhere I can escape) It is an easy way to cope  It can prevent you losing hope Just have a sip and have a toke But here I sit now without any See, it costs a pretty penny And I am flippin' broke.

      argh.. on top of stupid sickness, i have STPUID SICKNESS to deal with..  kids.. never get a genetic condition (sic..)  meanwhile, i've been having dreams of houses.. MANY houses.. in one of my dreams, an esteemed mercenary friend of ours (dhp) owned a castle in the scottish highlands.. and it was all modded up.. VERY dark and cool..  me, i owned a house in a hilly kinda area (perhaps warrandyte?) which (as of the temporal location of my dream) was terminally unfinised (but still big enough to be livable.. reminded me of the house i currently live in, with my parents, circa 1991-2..)  s23, i think, owned some kind of baloon castle.. or maybe it was a dirigible.. a zepellin?  never mind..   ;;) gideon^

      During research for my newly rekindled fascination with jewellry design I have rediscovered celtic knot work. I'll photograph/scan a few of the little scribbles I've been doing and in the mean time, click on the title of this entry to check out an illuminating (no pun intended) introduction to celtic knots.   No , you don't have to be artistically inclined, the approach mentioned has successfully been used in computer programs, in other words, the technique is almost purely mechanical, the creativity comes in it's use (hmm.. that somehow ended up being a meaningless sentence, although it's true, false, true and meaningless, meaningless and false......)

      I remembered how to activate the "pleasure centers" in my brain - I can currently cause pulses that start in my head and circulate through the body.  Haven't managed to get it going as a background task yet though.  So it's more like a  urlLink seratonin  boost that lingers for a while and tapers out.  If you're interested in trying it - it's kind of like spontaneously dropping (rising?) into a clear, medititive state - if you can do that, you can isolate the release itself.  and there you go.  I feel it on both sides of my head, making a 1.5-inch equilateral triangle with my medula oblongata. - where do you feel it?  Am I making sense, or do I sound like a hippie? :)  this was induced by reading  urlLink Toby 's blog, his most recent post has a link to a really cool set of cards he made, based on Timothy Leary's 8-circuit model of the brain.  Did a little search to brush up on my details and found myself (disappointingly enough) ticking the boxes next to many of the lower circuit symptoms, reading about the fifth again reminded me of the above "Bliss" - In - A - Can.

      I am currently involved in a couple of communal projects that could, for want of better words, be described as "startups."  We have no funding, everyone is effectively working for free, but there is the intention of money on the horizon - this introduces questions as to how people get paid at the end (if we get there).   If project funding already existed, it'd just be a matter of logging our hours and trusting that everyone was logging appropriately (ie. only logging time where they were  truly working ), paying them accordingly, maybe setting an upper limit to paid hours per week, etc..   As it is though, the projects currently move more like "open source" development, in that people do a bit here and there, when they feel like it...   some people feel like it more often than others, and so it probably isn't "fair" to split up the winnings equally at the end.  Also, we've recently run into the question of outsourcing, again not a problem in standard development - but when there's no budget to draw from, and you can't assume that people will be as happy as you are to work on your little project for free, you have to find some happy alternative.  Disjointed preambles and disclaimers aside, I was considering the possibility of a "peer reviewed, infinite share" system.  Rather than people logging hours as they work, or just plain old arguing about "fair amounts" of the final income, people post a review of the work they've completed (ie. "I worked for two hours, fixed  , added  ") and the group vote on the appropriate/proposed share value of that work.  Shares could effectively be thought of as representing "hours of work" but in the more abstract sense that, even if it took you five hours, if it's only  really  two hours of work, then you'd get two shares (or if everyone is in a grumpy mood, none ;-P)  (note: actually, shares would have to have a lower value than that, to allow for variable rates of pay: neatening up the wiki would, for example be paid at a lower rate than say, programming or art)  Obviously, this (like any) approach will have it's shortcomings, and (like any) relies on level-headed judgements, but it allows people to "earn" in a moneyless environment, and probably will reduce the risk of argument later on in the game.  As with any "share" oriented system, there is still risk, outsourced work is still, to some extent, faith-based in that people are paid in shares and "hope" that said shares are eventually  worth something .  But really, what monetary system doesn't operate like this?  Sorry for this boring tripe, but hey - it's _my_ blog :)  any comments/ideas/suggestions/criticisms?

      If you're close to me, you've probably heard me ramble about laughter increasing the cooperation between the two hemispheres of the brain.  (if you're really close to me, you've probably grinned while I repeat it for the fifth time..)  I have mentioned this study in passing many times since I read it a few years ago - though it's always been a foggy, summarised interpretation - and I feel that Scientific knowledge is certainly far more interesting when you are aware of it's origins.   urlLink Jokes, ice water and magnetism can change your view of the world--literally  (You can find the original artical over at  urlLink Scientific American  but I think it requires registration..)  In a culture of hearsay, partial truths, romanticism and urban myths, it is nice to have a horse's mouth to play with occasionally - even  if  most people believe what they hear without any question (or even any  thought! ), as one study says:  "..People are ten times more likely to believe something in quotation marks."    -- Pentaphobe

      Wow.  okay.  get this.  So Rachel arrived late on Sunday night, sans luggage (they sent her to the wrong place, and the luggage to a different wrong place - I won't go on about it, but they handled it terribly, she'd call, they'd say "dealing with it.." she'd call back later, they'd be no record of the previous interaction, they'd say "okay, putting a note on the computer, dealing with it" etc... etc...  took an average of seven phone calls per day just to make sure someone had more than a 10 second attention span)  FINALLY, she got her bags back this evening, but the piece of luggage that was "slightly" over weight and thus couldn't be brought on board was lighter by the exact weight of her laptop.  yup.  not much laptop luck here...

      goddamn it's cold today..  &nbsp;  ok, ok,&nbsp; so i know you all think i'm letting my end of the blog droop.. letting the team down or something.. but in between work, looking for more work, and working on the various projects that Phobius and i have on the side (regerding which i've had to recently whip myself, due to loose lips and sinking ships, etc, etc..)&nbsp;i haven't had time to do anything much. No games (except the ones i play on GBA in transit) no music, not much of anything else.. it's been rather frustrating.  &nbsp;  as soon as i have a few minutes, i'm going to go play thief 3 (which looks absolutely spesh-tastic) and see if i can get any ideas re: undead in our latest little project (which ALSO should be spesh-tastic when it's finished.. i wait with baited breath..)  &nbsp;  the looking-for-work thing is not going the best, although i am now familiarising myself with more specific pre-press software, in the hopes that merely  knowing  the stuff will be enough for me to get my foot in the door... and as they say..  &nbsp;  gideon^

      Well, super tired and wide awake - I've done my drumming drills (2 hours, hands under the pillow under my head), read some, drew some, tossed and turned - eventually ended up on the subject of biofeedback..  I  really  want to make myself some biofeedback devices, not only would it be something to do during insomnia, but also, I think it'd be quite interesting, if not, illuminating fnord  - and worst case, pretty fun.   WARNING: this post is probably going nowhere, to paraphrase "Jack" in Fight Club, "When you have insomnia, you're never really asleep and you're never really awake.."   One can't help wondering though -  if I'm watching a screen which is showing my brain activity in almost real time - what kind of changes the observation itself is making, or even the base action of plugging in?  Perhaps this is the reason that some people feel inclined to question the usefulness of biofeedback therapy, saying that the results only stay as long as the biofeedback mechanism is in use - comes down to the whole "quantum uncertainty" thing,  you're never operating on  your  brain , but rather one of your brain's eigenstates that only exist during biofeedback...  Ever plugged a video camera into a television and pointed the camera at the screen?  can that happen with biofeedback?   could I enter a strange or infinite loop inside my own head just by thinking the right thought and looking at the right point?   Another thing that would be quite nifty is an extensive synaesthesia kit, oh gee - I can't express how nice it would be to push those mental limits - I've worked for years to push my (very modest) synaesthetic capabilities forward, but have met with more blocks than when I was trying to uncover that memory with the big light in the sky, and the large, vibrating, metal thing. fnord!   When I was on tour, one of the dancers got hit on by these two guys who wanted to demonstrate their "invention."  She wasn't stupid, so she invited them over to the big table, and they pulled out an object about the size of a AAA battery, attached to a wire and a small box.It was basically a small vibrator, with a microphone hooked into the speed of the vibrations.  So the pitch and volume of your voice were totally realised in the modulations (and undulations) of this little toy...  I don't think a single person at that table held that in their hand without -however briefly- considering what that'd feel like in places more sensitive than your hands..  but I digress..  There are a few items out there that could sheepishly be called synaesthetic devices, but so far I've yet to find any that can mimic the symptoms of naturally synaesthetic people - it's said that they can  identify absolute tones because they're "the right colour," some can  taste  sound, some are induced to climax...   ...my synaesthesia seems to be limited to feeling unbelievably nauseous every time I hear brittany spears.    This spell checker has issues with the following words:   eigenstates undulations synaesthetic / synaesthesia colour

      In the moments I have between working and looking for more work, I've been developing a new backend for  urlLink Pentaphobia .  At present it's kind of a mish-mash of different bits of code and coding conventions, but the new version will be of a somewhat  urlLink wiki  nature.  It won't have many of the usual wiki features, and in their place there will be gallery/audio support and other such things.    This should lead to the page being updated more frequently, as the current (dreamweaver) templated pages makes it far too awkward to make broad sweeping changes (in the absence of dreamweaver).   urlLink ..more..    This would have happened a lot earlier if I could be certain about SQL on this server, but as I can't, I'm using flat files - although it'll be (maybe) a touch slower, I'm implementing a basic generic DB interface in PHP that will be used for all of the future content of the page.  This will allow for more detailed access/searching of the site content.  more soon...

      Kaimana is the name of the cat that lives with my Mother and Sister in Australia, his name means "Diamond" in Hawaiian, fitting, since in his youth he had a prominent diamond on his forehead.  (He's a scorpio to the best of our reckoning :) For convenience we often found ourselves referring to him as "Kai," which led to my discovery that "Kai" meant "Ocean" and "Mana," like in many languages and cultures represented a sort of majiqal force or energy. Quite an interesting bit of tribal linguistics there, Ocean-magic = Diamond.  Makes perfect sense really.  Anyway - was poking around on  urlLink Wikipedia  and ended up at a  urlLink plain-text representation of the Necronomicon  (certainly not the nicest version I've seen.  If you want to check out the Simon version of the Necronomicon, there's a (3mb!) pdf file at  urlLink Fnordfiles . check in texts:eBooks:Occult ) which mentions  "Kaimanu" as being Sumerian for Saturn.  (I assume that's in reference to the planet)  However: Saturn is son to Gaia (who I always associated Kym with) and according to wikipedia's page on  urlLink Saturn(the God) , during the festival Saturnalia(a celebration in his name)   "...the roles of master and slave were reversed, moral restrictions lessened, and the rules of etiquette ignored."    -- a fitting celebration for a cat if I ever heard one ( Who you callin' a "pet"?)  Also - one of the rings of Saturn (the planet) is apparently  urlLink the foreskin of Jesus Christ shot off into space  (they sure knew how to hold a briss back then..)  So..  my cat is the foreskin of Jesus, and  urlLink the English translation of my sister's name is in reference to the Crown of Thorns ..  sheesh.  I should upload a photo of the jacket I got in Canada whilst on tour, I got it because it looked warm, and had a cool fluorescent logo on the back, I later realised that it was made by a company called "GSUS Sindustries" and the "cool" logo was a stylized crown of thorns :)  hehe.. whoops.  forgive the rambling I'm just having a laugh, and also forgive the poor research and bare in mind that it takes a _LONG_ time to flip between windows on this iMac, so all of this link pasting was quite the effort :)

      Well, I must say, it's nice to see there are people coming in and checking out the music and the gallery, folks from all over the place. (my server stats report an average of 7000 requests per month at the moment, or approximately 800 unique page views)  But no comments!  ... I know, I know - it's a web page, people come - take what they want and leave..   however  since everything's kind of mishmash, experimental like, it'd be nice to hear some feedback from these invisible folk.  We're averaging a couple of hundred meg of music downloads every couple of days at the moment and not a single comment from anyone :)   Maybe I should go the route of the old mp3.com and drop cookies in people's browsers, get 'em to register and such like..  but I'd (of course) prefer to keep it open and just have visitors volunteer feedback...  must.  avoid.  temptation. to. be. web. nazi :)  anyway - how about a little incentive?  If you have come to visit and give me some feedback, I'll put you on a special majickal list of "cool people" who can have access to high quality streams of new stuff as it comes out, or (provided the postage isn't too much, or you're willing to pay it) I'll send you out a CD or t-shirt when they are released.  a few words for a few sounds..  fair 'nuff right?

I played around with it a bit this morning while drinking my coffee and ironed out a few glitches.   ...not that I'm saying it will work now, but it (at least) is playing the whole playlist through now rather than stopping after the first track and waiting for you to press  advance (or whatever).

      Well - what an amusing co-inky-dink.. Pentaphobia's server ( urlLink Web Axis ) was down for a while and (obviously) pentaphobia was too. Turns out  urlLink Rachel's site  was down too.  There's some weird electronic mojo floating around at the moment..  I have to give kudos to them though, that's the first down time that it's happened and it was very brief - excellent job guys!  So yah, if you came to check things out, my apologies - but it's probably one of those "If a website falls over in the forest..." things.  Seems a bit silly for me to say this now, but if you're looking for hosting - I really recommend web-axis, they're cheap (always a good thing), reliable and fast.  And for the cgi oriented peoples out there, they keep things nice and up to date.
