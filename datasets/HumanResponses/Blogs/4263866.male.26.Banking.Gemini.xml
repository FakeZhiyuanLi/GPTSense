        I love baseball .  If you learn anything about me, it's gotta be this little fact.    On March 1st of every year, I begin the countdown; one month until baseball season.    I start at least two fantasy baseball teams, pour through the previous year stats, and read every spring training report I can find.  It gets so ridiculous that my boss has a permanet vacation day scheduled for me for opening day.      My favorite team is the Chicago White Sox.  I live and die for the Sox, seriously.  When they lose, I have a hard time sleeping.  When they win, I feel like I'm on cloud nine.  Hell, I've even bargained with God simply for a come from behind win.  I know, it's pathetic, but that's who I am.      I tell you all this, because I right now I'm not sleeping well.  This has to be one of the most disappointing seasons I've ever been through.  Injuries, bad baserunning, the inability to bunt,   TO BUNT!!!!!   and a piss poor bullpen have all conspired to keep me wide awake at night.  These guys have got to get it going if I'm gonna have any chance of a good night sleep before October.          My second love is wrestling .  Yeah wrestling.  And before anyone says it ... I KNOW IT'S FAKE.  I don't care.  I love the drama.  I love the action.  I love the blood.      Raw was great last night.  The beatdown on Randy Orton at the end was great.  I like Randy as the new WWE champion.  I think it's about time they wrap that belt around young blood.  And for all of you wrestling "critics" who are complaining about Randy being the champ ... shut up.  You are all the same people who complain that the WWE needs to push its young guys.  Now that they are, you continue to complain.  I don't get it.          The campaign for President is heating up.   Honestly, I can't watch much of it.  I already know who's getting my vote, so what's the point.        I would like to see Kerry become more aggressive.  He can't escape the liberal tag, so why not exploit it.  I believe most Americans tend to be socially liberal.  But, conservatives have done such a good job of demonizing us, we run and hide instead of standing firm and fighting.      Well, enough is enough.  It's time for liberals to come out of the closet.  And I'm not talking about people like Michael Moore or Al Franken.  I think these two give liberals a bad name.  Don't get me wrong, I enjoy Moore's movies.  I find them entertaining and funny.  But I also find them to be dishonest and self-serving.        Liberals don't need to "edit" the truth.  We don't need to belittle our opponents by calling them names and using quick one liners (are you paying attention Franken?).  It's time to debate the issues with logic and fact, not name calling and innuendo.          Well there's not much else to talk about.   The Olympics are in full force right now.  Can't say I'm too into them, but I do have to say that the US basketball team is a disgrace.  How can we send a team with absolutely NO international experience?  I just don't get it.          I guess that's it for me tonight.   I doubt this will be a nightly thing, but who knows.  Check back later.
