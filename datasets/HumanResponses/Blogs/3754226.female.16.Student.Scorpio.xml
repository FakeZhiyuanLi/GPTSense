      Tears drying up At the corner of my sight Reminiscing the moment Mourning with all my might  Can I not contain The emptiess that I feel? Still I imagine If these things are real  Rainbows of wishes I keep on counting Take it from my heart The melodies I sing  Have angels waken up To make me see the reality? Or the cupids mistake me For someone who’s more worthy  Pictures I keep on holding Letters I keep on reading Moments in my mind still lingering Thru it all it’s him I keep on loving  To me he has left nothing But plain old me instead Imbude in me was all the hurt All the blame and the things he said  This foolishness I’ve been When will it have to end Or for lifetimes I may have foreseen When will I stop to pretend  Whatever life can bring me in time I may have ran out of my rhyme But still I believe that it’s you and me Though ever after’s are not for us to see

      Understand, can’t I? Your life is not mine You have your own This grudge I hold inside  Accept, but I? Cant help but cry Wish I’m numb To myself I can’t lie  Know did I? You love me but I Saw nothing but her In your arms I cry  take this, could I? Not blame myself For who you love is her Ive got all to learn

      I did not understand Why these things get out of hand Blankly in my mind I see no one but you inside  Made me see the sun and the stars You made these things bright Blinded by the fact that I see not My heart you left but still uncut  I could not see why I should be like this I found myself tied up with your kiss Your face I see that lingers in my mind But the hurt I feel still I cannot find  Where has been this stupidity come from The flower of sins you give I cannot sum the moronic instance I’ve just account for but still with you I could not ask for more  to whom you stick for I failed to ask plainly I believe that our love would last but hey I forgot one thing that’s true I may be numb but still I love you..

      In this world full of lies,  Blinding my innocent eyes,  Nobody heard my sorrowful cries,  I can only make a deep sigh.   Since the day that you came,  My life has never been the same,  You made my heart tamed,  Hope my love for you may remain.   I may leave my promise untrue,  But it had never made me blue,  Now I really knew,  I had fallen in love with you.   Is this serendipity!?  Or part of my fantasy!?  No, must’ve been reality,  It ended up all my misery.   Even if life is so bad,  Meeting you has been glad,  Losing you will be sad,  You’re the true love I’ve ever had.   You have done so much for me,  You even set my heart free,  And made me want to see,  The world as it should be.   Thanks for being there,  For the love you always share,  For being the one who cares,  Losing you I really can’t bear.   I love you my dear,  I really wish you are here,  Beside me, oh so near,  Sweetest words you want to hear.   So, if today I’ll die,  And in earth’s soil I may lie,  I do not wish to see you cry,  Even if I said my last goodbyes…

      From the corner of my eye I saw a glimpse of you Out from my lips cam a sigh From a heart that shouts for you  I hear your melodic laughter I see your brilliant smile My dream of us together Is all that is worthwhile  I long to touch your slender hand To feel it clasping into mine And suddenly rays of light shine Each day I live is a burden   Each second of you, tormented For like the roses in a garden They’re soft but the thorns are wicked I can cot find enough bravery   Nor do I have the courage For the love that moves inside of me Is silent in its outrage So here I wonder of how long I’ll wait Of how this love stands true  For though I suffer from my fate Still, I’d be loving only you

      I'm broken into pieces  I lie on the floor with shattered dreams and hopes  I cry on my bed burying my face  Thinking of the way it should be in that place   I stumble and I fell  It just didn't turn out so well  I saw you talking and laughing  While I was here all alone, crying.   I never thought I'd feel this way again  To feel this pain I never wished to gain  I hope I could find someone who'd never make me blue  Who would never hurt me the way you do.

      Tell me when you're leaving, I'll ask tomorrow to wait  I'm begging of your destiny, begging of my fate  Why is life so callously cruel to a fellow such as I?  Why to my one true love do I have to say goodbye?   Tears trail in streams down my troubled face  For the chambers of my mind is anguish’s last place  My voice finds no minute strength to even bid thee well  For fear has just resolved in my broken heart to dwell   To leave me now, my love, would be to take my soul...  For without you in my life, I will never be whole.  But alas, if you earnestly insist, I will not hinder thee,  For loving means giving; so I'm setting you free...

      Lest in my reverie I did not understand Imaginable facts I didn’t see In life I see nothing but thee You make my world go round As far as I can be Inspiring who I am That is who you are to me A blessing from Almighty That’s why I thank thee Now I understand Latter did I see The impossible joy You bring to me

      watching you sleep through the night,  I’ll stay beside you to hug you tight,  I looked at you and heaved a sigh,  I know I love you and I know you know why.   Everything about you amazes me,  I love you and I want everyone to see,  I have a feeling that’s so true,  My heart and I belongs to you.   Seeing you sleeping in my arms tonight,  Sets my heart to dance in delight,  God blessed me with an angel like you,  To love & care for me that only you could do,   At your lips, I gently planted a gentle kiss,  Which sends my heart totally into a bliss,  I cherish you, my precious darling,  And together, we’ll awake in the morning.   I closed my eyes and I can still see,  A vision of my beloved baby,  Your charm, my dear is truly magnificent,  It is unexplainable like an enchantment.   Your lips is soft and willing,  Enough to make this wonderful feeling,  I love the way you look and stare,  You make my feelings kindle and flare.   So I drifted off to sleep thinking about nothing but you,  What tomorrow may bring, we have no clue,  We just held each other tight,  And it lasted throughout the night.   I do believe in things like forever,  And I know we’ll reach forever together,  I do need and love my precious honey,  I’m talking about no one but you baby...

      Ano ba ang nagawa ko  Bakit mo ako iniwan  Akala ko mahal mo ako  Akala ko habang buhay tayo magkasama   Tapos isang araw  Iniwan mo na lang ako bigla  Hindi mo man sinabi sa akin  Kung ano ang iyong dahilan   Sayang naman ang pag-ibig na  Ibinuhos ko sa iyo  Sayang naman ang panahon na  Ginamit ko sa iyo   Bakit mo pa ba ako pina-asa  Kung hindi mo ako talagang mahal  Alam mo naman na magiging saying lamang  Ang pag-ibig ko sa iyo

      The time is near for me to die  I stared in the heaven above the sky  I saw an angel so beautiful and kind  The angel I thought I would never find   The feeling of love as I stare in her eyes  I felt as if we had strong ties,  But that’s too late my end is near  I wonder why I felt no fear   In front of an angel I see clear  Looked in her eyes and saw a tear  She looked at me then began to cry,  I held her hand and then asked why?   She said “I Love You”,  Oh how it was true  The feelings within I can’t explain  My love for her I can’t contain   When I was about to tell what I feel  My life just ended, I lost my dear  What a shame I was too late  Did I deserve such a cruel fate   I wish my angel knew what I felt,  I should have done it before and got it dealt  I love you my angel but what a sad good bye  The last thing that I did was to make you cry

      open my eyes  To see nothing but darkness  I tried to hide  But I could still feel the creeping emptiness   I feel my eyes turn crimson  As I run to nowhere  Burning sensations…  Will my soul be spared?   I am swallowed by inexistence  Slowly gaining unconsciousness  Lingering in wretchedness  Embracing unto death’s roots   Held by insanity  Devoured by desolation  Saturate my spirit…  Before I am lost into oblivion

      Marami kang iniisip, naiisip at gustong isipin. Pero mas gusto mong malaman ng lahat ng tao ang lahat ng kabangagan mo. Wala lang. Pumampam. Umasang may mag-rereply sa senseless thoughts mo. Magadvice. Magsabing, "Oo.. naiintindihan kita.." Pero ayos lang sayo kahit di nila basahin to. Bakit pa? Sino ka ba? Nakakadiri. Ayaw mong tuksuhin ka nilang, "yuck!! Ang mushy mo pala!!" Sa lahat ng kaibigan mong humihingi ng advice tungkol sa pag-ibig, ang sinasabi mo lang palagi, "Tange, kalimutan mo na lang yang nararamdaman mo. Korni mo e. Guguluhin lang nyan buhay mo." Ang sasabihin pa nila sayo, "Talaga? Buti ka pa, wala kang lovelife. Di ka stressed--" "At di ako mukhang tanga." Dagdag mo pa. May na-offend ka na naman. Pero pake mo ba sa kanila? Totoo naman ah. Tapos bigla mong mare-realize, may problema ka na rin pala.  Bakit may nanggugulo pa rin sa buhay mo ngayon? Ang dami mong crush, grabe. Yung isa kaklase mo, yung apat, kachat mo sa isang chat channel, si Jay-R, Si Mark at si Rainier aka Xi Men ng Starstruck, F4, c Chris Tiu, yung limang magkakabarkadang kapitbahay niyo at yung pinsan mo. Nineteen, imagine!? Pero di naman nila ginugulo ang buhay mo. Kaso may isang taong di mo maintindihan kung bakit kahit anong gawin mo, talagang ginugulo pa rin niya yung buhay mo. Inalis mo na noon yung pangalan nya sa phone mo. Kaso sinulat mo pa rin yung number nya sa diary mo. Engot ka talaga. Tapos nilagay mo ulit sa cell mo. Tapos inalis mo ulit kase nainis ka. Naihagis mo pa nga sa kama mo yung phone mo e. Tapos naisip mo wala rin namang epekto kung nasa cell mo siya o wala, kasi memorize mo yung number niya. Panahon na para kalimutan na talaga sya --- naiisip mo. Okay na? Hinde. Mas malala.  Tsk tsk tsk. Naaawa ka na talaga sa sarili mo. Naiinis ka pa kapag sinasabi sayo ng mga kaibigan mo, "Nakita ko sha sa Malate kagabi." Asar na asar ka. Sabay sigaw with matching facial expression, "PAKI KO?" “Baket? Ayaw mo na ba sa kanya?" Tatahimik ka muna. Tititigan silang lahat na naghihintay ng sagot mo. Biglang magkakaron ng split personality disorder, ngingiti at magsasalita: "Sino yon?" Natuwa ka sa ginawa mo. Tapos makikita mo siya. Ayun. Mabubuwisit ka talaga. Maaalala mo yung mga panahong pinagmukha ka niyang tanga. Yung panahong kailangan mo siya. Yung panahong iniwan ka nya sa ere... Masisira ang araw mo. Wala ka sa mood makipagtawanan. Sisigawan mo ang kaibigan mong natapakan ang white rubber shoes mo. Gugustuhin mong balatan ng buhay ang taong magsasabing, "Ganyan talaga pag in-love." May background pang mga palihim na tawa. At sabay-sabay silang kakanta ng "For all of my life,you are the one, I will love you faithfully forever..". Kanta mo yun sa kanya. Di ka makakapagsalita. Naramdaman mong umiinit yung tenga mo, yung leeg mo, yung mukha mo. Bigla mo nasabi, "Sino yon?" Ayos na sana, kaso di mo naisip na mali yung statement mo. At bago mo pa mabawi ang sinabi mo, sasabihin na nila, "Baket? Me sinabe bang pangalan??? Yak!! Halata!!!"Feeling mo masusunog na sa init yung mukha mo. Parang gusto mo ng mag-vanish.  Isang araw naman nakikipagkwentuhan ka sa crush mo. Ang saya-saya mo! Biglang may dadaan sa likod mo na dalawang kurimao di sinasadyang maging pamilyar na sayo. Lumingon ka, at pagtalikod mo, nagsalita ang isa: "Siya ba yun?" Sasagot ang isa pa, "Oo nga!!."  halaa!!! Anong ginawa mo?? Titigil ka na sa pakikipagkwentuhan. Aalis na lang na punung-puno ng sama ng loob. Naaasar ka sa lahat. Bakit kailangang pakialaman ang buhay iba? Bakit kailangang ipagkwentuhan pa  ang di na dapat pinag-uusapan? Marami pang version yung mga naririnig mo. Minsan ganito, "Sigurado ka, yun yun? ." O kaya, "Ows? Yan yon?". Lupit mo! Narinig mo yun!? Marathon eavesdropper ka kase.  One time nakipag-chat ka. "musta luvlyf? meron b?" "wla..” sagot mo.  "Ows!? bket nmn!?" "basta. wla syang kwenta!" Ang kulit.  "mahal mo?" "huh?" Nagulat ka. "mahal mo pa rin un!” "weeeh!! D nga!?" Naasar ka na. "lang kwenta pero mhl mo?" Matitigilan ka. Tititigan mo yung monitor ng matagal. Ita-type mo yung "gtg" nang di oras. May kasama pang "nys miting u" para di halatang nabwisit ka sa sinabi nya.  Asar na asar ka na talaga sa sarili mo. Gusto mo na lang talagang ma-dissolve sa hangin. Ikaw na ngayon ang naghahanap ng advice. Pero walang kwenta lahat ng sinabi nila. "Kalimutan na kasi!." PAANO? "Wag ka kase paapekto.“ HA?!? ANG LABO!!! "Marami pang iba jan!" EH SIYA NGA LANG EH!!! Aasarin ka pa kapag sinabi nilang, "Bakit di na lang si ___? Yikee! Okay naman siya ah." Ngek, ano yun, ganon lang kadali? Naisip mo, tama, bwisit sa buhay yang feelings na yan. May magtatanong pa, "Bakit mo ba yon mahal?" Wow pare, wala kang maisagot. Buti pa sa Math pwede kang manghula ng formula, pwede mong paglaruan ang solution mo. May effort’s score ka pa. Eh sa tanong na yon? Tsk tsk. Malabong mangyari yon. Paulit-ulit mong sinasabi sa sarili mo na wala ka na talagang pakialam sa kanya. Pero bakit pag nakikita mo siya, natitigilan ka pa rin? Minsan, kaibigan mo na yung nagsasabi sayo, “O, kala ko ba wala na?” Tatawa ka na lang. Lalakasan mo para di mahalata yung teary eyes mo. Di ka na naman makapagsalita. Litong-lito ka na. Di mo alam kung bakit nga ba ganon. Kung bakit ka apektado. Kung bakit nagbabago ang lahat pag nandiyan siya. Kung bakit gustung-gusto mo siyang bigyan ng utak para marealize niya lahat… Lahat-lahat. Somehow, gusto mong mawala ka na lang bigla. Maubusan ng internet card. Sabugan ng pc. Mag-brown-out. Biglang mag-collapse. Umiyak. Malunod. Maging ipis. Mabagsakan ng asteroid. Basically, mawala! Maglahong parang bula. Kase, tama yung sinabi ng naka-chat mo. Sinasabi mong walang kwenta, pero mahal mo. Sobra.

      The tears that I have cried are present in the mist;  Flowing with the morning dew and bliss.  Feel my heart beating with the fruitful earth;  My mind racing again back from birth.   Life goes on like a flowing river;  Love survives although the world is bitter.  Hope emerges with the new beginning;  But you are still in my heart's ending.   I have decided not to go with the flow;  But against the wind's tremendous blow.  My body may break but my spirit will not;  Refuse to withdraw from the battle's shot.

       	The difference between the “ME” then and the “ME” now is that I once believed in fairytales… I once thought that Cinderella stories were easy to charm and that with just a flick of an eye, it could totally happen. But now, I’ve grown, I’ve set my foot in real waters where I’ve realized the difference between a dream and a reality. I would have to admit that I’m not the type of girl every man is dreaming of. With occasional breakouts, a bulging tummy, bad hair days almost 6 times a week, without the Snow White type of complexion and definitely not the supermodel physique I wished for, it makes me a tad insecure. At the same time, a lot less closer from my dream of prince charming falling madly in love with me. So now, my real life journey begins. It was a stagnant weekend when his best friend invited me to watch a movie with them. The movie was a chick flick that had so much publicity that made me nosy about it although I was pretty sure that that certain flick was just a waste of money. It was the kind of movie that even stupid people could already conclude the ending for it was labeled as the “way-too-impossible-because-no-rich-man-could-love-a-maid” kind of movie. But since, I was curious and didn’t have anything to do that Saturday, I decided to go with them. During the ride, we weren’t talking that much. I was a bit shy not knowing the reason behind it. When we arrived at the ticket booth, we saw that we were half an hour early than the next showing so we decided to eat a light dinner. My other friends led him and me to this fast food chain but it seems that my appetite wasn’t hungry for that genre of food. I just stood there, hesitating to order anything for I was really craving for sweets!!! Luckily, he was looking at me. It seems that he read my mind as he asked me if I wanted to eat somewhere else. I agreed as we left our other friends eating burgers and fries and then he surprisingly took me to this bakeshop full of mouthwatering cakes and pastries that are to-die-for. I ordered my favorite cake as he ordered his and then got a chair and awkwardly waited for our food to be arrived. “Sabi ko na nga ba, gusto mo kong maka date eh!” I joked to ease the awkwardness creeping towards the both of us… he laughed and rode with it as that single joke broke the silence between our 2 souls. I was seated facing him, while I kept on psyching myself not to show any emotions of kilig or any other feelings related to it. Our food arrived shortly and we ate…  	We had a pleasant conversation and I found it difficult to hide the smile in my face while we were talking. I couldn’t interpret whether he was being super friendly or just plain sweet. Though I wanted to believe in the latter, I decided to lower my expectations as I told myself “Wag ka na!! Walang gusto un sayo!!!” so I just had a nice talk as little by little, I learned some info about him. After quite a while, I saw our friends outside waiting for us. I looked at the time and realized the movie was about to start. We took our last sip on our iced tea and went straight to the movies.  It was kind of him to be seated right next to me for the next 2 hours. I felt so protected and so comfortable to be near him. It has only been a month since I’ve really known him but I felt safe knowing his presence was near me.  As I watched the “Cinderella movie” I couldn’t help but wonder if it could also happen to me. I was just a plain simple girl, slowly falling in love with a guy I know I couldn’t have. Based on my sources, I know a handful of girls are crazy for him, including me, and that he still hasn’t had any girlfriends, which made me assume either he wasn’t the commitment type of guy or whether he is just too picky when it comes to dating women. Either way, I had no chance. I know it isn’t bad to dream but if I’d keep on dreaming, I know it would only hurt me.   	I was confused whether or not to believe in my childhood dream of prince charming or to just forget about it and live life as it is supposed to be. If a mere person wrote that movie, then maybe, it could still happen with a real person like me. Was I asking for too much or was it O.K? The very thought of it maims me.          The movie ended just exactly the way I expected it… He fell in love with her despite of her imperfections and a low stature compared to his. They married and lived happily ever after blah blah blah blah… we both went out of the movie house as I followed his lead. He looked at me and asked, “What can you say?” you know what I said? “In reality, a guy like that could NEVER fall in love with a girl like her!” he smiled and said, “I agree!”  His words were so powerful that it rang over and over and over again in my head. Sadly, the movie was just like us. He was a highly statured man while I was just a maid. He could never see the way I see him. He will never look at me like the way I look at him.   	After the movie, he treated me out on a cup of ice cream and we sat together with his best friend. I felt the tickle of the midnight’s air brushing my skin. I looked at the vast sky as I waited for a falling star to appear so I’d wish upon it. He saw that I was quiet as he talked to me as we exchanged out thoughts that night. After the last spoon of ice cream and a couple of chitchat, they decided to drop me home… “Thank you.” I said with a compelled smile. “I had a great time.” It was during that time that I slowly saw their car vanish into thin air.   Now you’re asking me what happened next?!? No, I didn’t leave a glass slipper so that he’ll come back. I didn’t turn into a mermaid to swim distant oceans just to see him, nor did I ride a magic carpet just to tell the whole world how much I loved him. I just went straight to bed, thought about him and told myself; “You’re a big girl now… and it’s about time you let go of that little Cinderella dream…”

      My heart now feels nothing but hatred  To those who made me believe in a lie,  Those who fooled me,  Those who caused me so much pain,  Those who made my dreams drift away,  Those who took away my happiness,  Those who made my life miserable.   For so long,  I have believed in something that wasn’t even there  It took me time to know and realize the truth,  It took me time before I was awaken from my stupidity,  It took me time before I was brought back to the harsh reality.   To those people – “that” guy and “that” girl,  They know who they are,  I hope I never see them  So that they wouldn’t have to face my fury.  I hope they live long enough to face their own karma.   Time will come,  They’ll be the ones believing in lies,  They’ll be the ones fooled,  They’ll be the ones feeling more than thrice the pain they’ve caused me,  They’ll be the ones, whose dreams will shatter,  They’ll be the ones unhappy,  They’ll be the ones miserable.   By that time,  I have gained the strength and have moved on,  Have forgotten what they did to me,  And have finally found the happiness they once took away from me.

      I want you to know how much I care,  yet you still smirk and stare  To know that I am finally falling  when it is that you don’t even mind How will you know?  I want you to know how much I value you  while you were in such a big hurry How am I to tell you that I love you when you not even cherish our time How will you then know?  I want you to know that I enjoy being with you  but you just smirk and snicker like a fool Wish you’d know how much I wish for you   But as always, you were busy  How will you thereupon know?  Times are when i needed you so badly  All I want was a simple grin from you  But for once you didn’t even bother  With how you arrogantly deal? How will you then promptly know?  You constantly indulge in my reveries  but you seem so millions away from me  that at times I could not reach you. But now you'll never know this things  For those times you were not here with me   How absurd it is for me to still love you When it has been obvious enough That I see no reason for me not to But despite these things that befall… How will you know?

      Our first time together felt extraordinary  There were full of laughter and serenity  I thought that forever it would be like this  Because of me, we ended up our bliss   In a moment, things began to change  from afar, I fervently miss our past  But now it's over, it’s all my fault I could curse myself for letting it pass  Today, I yearn for our times together  I thought I could live alone by myself  how stupid I was to let you go My pride took over and left you then  I want you to know how much I love you  Things were not like this before I met you How sorry I am for what I have done  Please do forgive me…love me like before again…

      why?  why do i love you?  why do i care?  why do these feelings come,  and tear my heart into pieces?   why do i like you?  why do i stay?  why do i live in the past  that won't go away?

             I did not understand Why these things get out of hand Blankly in my mind I see no one but you inside  Made me see the sun and the stars You made these things bright Blinded by the fact that I see not My heart you left but still uncut  I could not see why I should be like this I found myself tied up with your kiss Your face I see that lingers in my mind But the hurt I feel still I cannot find  Where has been this stupidity come from The flower of sins you give I cannot sum the moronic instance I’ve just account for but still with you I could not ask for more  to whom you stick for I failed to ask plainly I believe that our love would last but hey I forgot one thing that’s true I may be numb but still I love you..

             Understand, can’t I? Your life is not mine You have your own This grudge I hold inside  Accept, but I? Cant help but cry Wish I’m numb To myself I can’t lie  Know did I? You love me but I Saw nothing but her In your arms I cry  take this, could I? Not blame myself For who you love is her Ive got all to learn

      I dont understand why those stupid jeepney drivers still follow such letters from the council with regards to the fare. It's quite ironic for them to realize the mere incidence of a student passing her 20 peso bill and ONLY RECEIVING 15.50 instead of the so called promulgated law of only 4.50 with having to pass around 16.50. Stupid it may be but their foolishness crawls up in my nerves that i may want to scram down the jeepney and yell at that stupid driver in may dismay.  But whatever their intention is.. THEY SUCK!

      Well isn't it obvious that at this momnt of time.. I am twisted like crazy!? This day is one heck of a crap!! i mean here.. CRAP!! Having to not sleep for at least 8 hours and having to not regained a not so good morning made my head swirl in a very explicit and irritable manner. Who would have love this day. Yeah right.. but still.. i cannot help but think of all my damn problems that had always settled on the bottom of my mind.. This is not good for me to see, but the reality seems to slap it on my face that I can do nothing but blame myself for doing such things.. SOBRANG ALANGANIN ng relationship nmin ngaun.. I even feel like he is just sticking to me for the fact that I might go insane if ever he leaves me for Pam.. My whole memory crashes down and my whole individuality seems too low for me to contain all these. Ewan ko.. feeling ko mageexplode na ko.. sobrang gulo.. if only i could wish for my best.. pero it's impossible.. pero sbi nga  ni  elisa.. once you've decided to do it.. then have the initiative to start it and paninidigan mo! well now.. how on earth will i have to have that kind of  attitude when I was born this stupid.. God.. Im losing my sanity!

      Marami kang iniisip, naiisip at gustong isipin. Pero mas gusto mong malaman ng lahat ng tao ang lahat ng kabangagan mo. Wala lang. Pumampam. Umasang may mag-rereply sa senseless thoughts mo. Magadvice. Magsabing, "Oo.. naiintindihan kita.." Pero ayos lang sayo kahit di nila basahin to. Bakit pa? Sino ka ba? Nakakadiri. Ayaw mong tuksuhin ka nilang, "yuck!! Ang mushy mo pala!!" Sa lahat ng kaibigan mong humihingi ng advice tungkol sa pag-ibig, ang sinasabi mo lang palagi, "Tange, kalimutan mo na lang yang nararamdaman mo. Korni mo e. Guguluhin lang nyan buhay mo." Ang sasabihin pa nila sayo, "Talaga? Buti ka pa, wala kang lovelife. Di ka stressed--" "At di ako mukhang tanga." Dagdag mo pa. May na-offend ka na naman. Pero pake mo ba sa kanila? Totoo naman ah. Tapos bigla mong mare-realize, may problema ka na rin pala.  Bakit may nanggugulo pa rin sa buhay mo ngayon? Ang dami mong crush, grabe. Yung isa kaklase mo, yung apat, kachat mo sa isang chat channel, si Jay-R, Si Mark at si Rainier aka Xi Men ng Starstruck, F4, c Chris Tiu, yung limang magkakabarkadang kapitbahay niyo at yung pinsan mo. Nineteen, imagine!? Pero di naman nila ginugulo ang buhay mo. Kaso may isang taong di mo maintindihan kung bakit kahit anong gawin mo, talagang ginugulo pa rin niya yung buhay mo. Inalis mo na noon yung pangalan nya sa phone mo. Kaso sinulat mo pa rin yung number nya sa diary mo. Engot ka talaga. Tapos nilagay mo ulit sa cell mo. Tapos inalis mo ulit kase nainis ka. Naihagis mo pa nga sa kama mo yung phone mo e. Tapos naisip mo wala rin namang epekto kung nasa cell mo siya o wala, kasi memorize mo yung number niya. Panahon na para kalimutan na talaga sya --- naiisip mo. Okay na? Hinde. Mas malala.  Tsk tsk tsk. Naaawa ka na talaga sa sarili mo. Naiinis ka pa kapag sinasabi sayo ng mga kaibigan mo, "Nakita ko sha sa Malate kagabi." Asar na asar ka. Sabay sigaw with matching facial expression, "PAKI KO?" “Baket? Ayaw mo na ba sa kanya?" Tatahimik ka muna. Tititigan silang lahat na naghihintay ng sagot mo. Biglang magkakaron ng split personality disorder, ngingiti at magsasalita: "Sino yon?" Natuwa ka sa ginawa mo. Tapos makikita mo siya. Ayun. Mabubuwisit ka talaga. Maaalala mo yung mga panahong pinagmukha ka niyang tanga. Yung panahong kailangan mo siya. Yung panahong iniwan ka nya sa ere... Masisira ang araw mo. Wala ka sa mood makipagtawanan. Sisigawan mo ang kaibigan mong natapakan ang white rubber shoes mo. Gugustuhin mong balatan ng buhay ang taong magsasabing, "Ganyan talaga pag in-love." May background pang mga palihim na tawa. At sabay-sabay silang kakanta ng "For all of my life,you are the one, I will love you faithfully forever..". Kanta mo yun sa kanya. Di ka makakapagsalita. Naramdaman mong umiinit yung tenga mo, yung leeg mo, yung mukha mo. Bigla mo nasabi, "Sino yon?" Ayos na sana, kaso di mo naisip na mali yung statement mo. At bago mo pa mabawi ang sinabi mo, sasabihin na nila, "Baket? Me sinabe bang pangalan??? Yak!! Halata!!!"Feeling mo masusunog na sa init yung mukha mo. Parang gusto mo ng mag-vanish.  Isang araw naman nakikipagkwentuhan ka sa crush mo. Ang saya-saya mo! Biglang may dadaan sa likod mo na dalawang kurimao di sinasadyang maging pamilyar na sayo. Lumingon ka, at pagtalikod mo, nagsalita ang isa: "Siya ba yun?" Sasagot ang isa pa, "Oo nga!!." halaa!!! Anong ginawa mo?? Titigil ka na sa pakikipagkwentuhan. Aalis na lang na punung-puno ng sama ng loob. Naaasar ka sa lahat. Bakit kailangang pakialaman ang buhay iba? Bakit kailangang ipagkwentuhan pa ang di na dapat pinag-uusapan? Marami pang version yung mga naririnig mo. Minsan ganito, "Sigurado ka, yun yun? ." O kaya, "Ows? Yan yon?". Lupit mo! Narinig mo yun!? Marathon eavesdropper ka kase.  One time nakipag-chat ka. "musta luvlyf? meron b?" "wla..” sagot mo. "Ows!? bket nmn!?" "basta. wla syang kwenta!" Ang kulit. "mahal mo?" "huh?" Nagulat ka. "mahal mo pa rin un!” "weeeh!! D nga!?" Naasar ka na. "lang kwenta pero mhl mo?" Matitigilan ka. Tititigan mo yung monitor ng matagal. Ita-type mo yung "gtg" nang di oras. May kasama pang "nys miting u" para di halatang nabwisit ka sa sinabi nya.  Asar na asar ka na talaga sa sarili mo. Gusto mo na lang talagang ma-dissolve sa hangin. Ikaw na ngayon ang naghahanap ng advice. Pero walang kwenta lahat ng sinabi nila. "Kalimutan na kasi!." PAANO? "Wag ka kase paapekto.“ HA?!? ANG LABO!!! "Marami pang iba jan!" EH SIYA NGA LANG EH!!! Aasarin ka pa kapag sinabi nilang, "Bakit di na lang si ___? Yikee! Okay naman siya ah." Ngek, ano yun, ganon lang kadali? Naisip mo, tama, bwisit sa buhay yang feelings na yan. May magtatanong pa, "Bakit mo ba yon mahal?" Wow pare, wala kang maisagot. Buti pa sa Math pwede kang manghula ng formula, pwede mong paglaruan ang solution mo. May effort’s score ka pa. Eh sa tanong na yon? Tsk tsk. Malabong mangyari yon. Paulit-ulit mong sinasabi sa sarili mo na wala ka na talagang pakialam sa kanya. Pero bakit pag nakikita mo siya, natitigilan ka pa rin? Minsan, kaibigan mo na yung nagsasabi sayo, “O, kala ko ba wala na?” Tatawa ka na lang. Lalakasan mo para di mahalata yung teary eyes mo. Di ka na naman makapagsalita. Litong-lito ka na. Di mo alam kung bakit nga ba ganon. Kung bakit ka apektado. Kung bakit nagbabago ang lahat pag nandiyan siya. Kung bakit gustung-gusto mo siyang bigyan ng utak para marealize niya lahat… Lahat-lahat. Somehow, gusto mong mawala ka na lang bigla. Maubusan ng internet card. Sabugan ng pc. Mag-brown-out. Biglang mag-collapse. Umiyak. Malunod. Maging ipis. Mabagsakan ng asteroid. Basically, mawala! Maglahong parang bula. Kase, tama yung sinabi ng naka-chat mo. Sinasabi mong walang kwenta, pero mahal mo. Sobra.

             The tears that I have cried are present in the mist; Flowing with the morning dew and bliss. Feel my heart beating with the fruitful earth; My mind racing again back from birth.  Life goes on like a flowing river; Love survives although the world is bitter. Hope emerges with the new beginning; But you are still in my heart's ending.  I have decided not to go with the flow; But against the wind's tremendous blow. My body may break but my spirit will not; Refuse to withdraw from the battle's shot.

      The difference between the “ME” then and the “ME” now is that I once believed in fairytales… I once thought that Cinderella stories were easy to charm and that with just a flick of an eye, it could totally happen. But now, I’ve grown, I’ve set my foot in real waters where I’ve realized the difference between a dream and a reality. I would have to admit that I’m not the type of girl every man is dreaming of. With occasional breakouts, a bulging tummy, bad hair days almost 6 times a week, without the Snow White type of complexion and definitely not the supermodel physique I wished for, it makes me a tad insecure. At the same time, a lot less closer from my dream of prince charming falling madly in love with me. So now, my real life journey begins. It was a stagnant weekend when his best friend invited me to watch a movie with them. The movie was a chick flick that had so much publicity that made me nosy about it although I was pretty sure that that certain flick was just a waste of money. It was the kind of movie that even stupid people could already conclude the ending for it was labeled as the “way-too-impossible-because-no-rich-man-could-love-a-maid” kind of movie. But since, I was curious and didn’t have anything to do that Saturday, I decided to go with them. During the ride, we weren’t talking that much. I was a bit shy not knowing the reason behind it. When we arrived at the ticket booth, we saw that we were half an hour early than the next showing so we decided to eat a light dinner. My other friends led him and me to this fast food chain but it seems that my appetite wasn’t hungry for that genre of food. I just stood there, hesitating to order anything for I was really craving for sweets!!! Luckily, he was looking at me. It seems that he read my mind as he asked me if I wanted to eat somewhere else. I agreed as we left our other friends eating burgers and fries and then he surprisingly took me to this bakeshop full of mouthwatering cakes and pastries that are to-die-for. I ordered my favorite cake as he ordered his and then got a chair and awkwardly waited for our food to be arrived. “Sabi ko na nga ba, gusto mo kong maka date eh!” I joked to ease the awkwardness creeping towards the both of us… he laughed and rode with it as that single joke broke the silence between our 2 souls. I was seated facing him, while I kept on psyching myself not to show any emotions of kilig or any other feelings related to it. Our food arrived shortly and we ate…   We had a pleasant conversation and I found it difficult to hide the smile in my face while we were talking. I couldn’t interpret whether he was being super friendly or just plain sweet. Though I wanted to believe in the latter, I decided to lower my expectations as I told myself “Wag ka na!! Walang gusto un sayo!!!” so I just had a nice talk as little by little, I learned some info about him. After quite a while, I saw our friends outside waiting for us. I looked at the time and realized the movie was about to start. We took our last sip on our iced tea and went straight to the movies. It was kind of him to be seated right next to me for the next 2 hours. I felt so protected and so comfortable to be near him. It has only been a month since I’ve really known him but I felt safe knowing his presence was near me. As I watched the “Cinderella movie” I couldn’t help but wonder if it could also happen to me. I was just a plain simple girl, slowly falling in love with a guy I know I couldn’t have. Based on my sources, I know a handful of girls are crazy for him, including me, and that he still hasn’t had any girlfriends, which made me assume either he wasn’t the commitment type of guy or whether he is just too picky when it comes to dating women. Either way, I had no chance. I know it isn’t bad to dream but if I’d keep on dreaming, I know it would only hurt me.   I was confused whether or not to believe in my childhood dream of prince charming or to just forget about it and live life as it is supposed to be. If a mere person wrote that movie, then maybe, it could still happen with a real person like me. Was I asking for too much or was it O.K? The very thought of it maims me.   The movie ended just exactly the way I expected it… He fell in love with her despite of her imperfections and a low stature compared to his. They married and lived happily ever after blah blah blah blah… we both went out of the movie house as I followed his lead. He looked at me and asked, “What can you say?” you know what I said? “In reality, a guy like that could NEVER fall in love with a girl like her!” he smiled and said, “I agree!” His words were so powerful that it rang over and over and over again in my head. Sadly, the movie was just like us. He was a highly statured man while I was just a maid. He could never see the way I see him. He will never look at me like the way I look at him.   After the movie, he treated me out on a cup of ice cream and we sat together with his best friend. I felt the tickle of the midnight’s air brushing my skin. I looked at the vast sky as I waited for a falling star to appear so I’d wish upon it. He saw that I was quiet as he talked to me as we exchanged out thoughts that night. After the last spoon of ice cream and a couple of chitchat, they decided to drop me home… “Thank you.” I said with a compelled smile. “I had a great time.” It was during that time that I slowly saw their car vanish into thin air.  Now you’re asking me what happened next?!? No, I didn’t leave a glass slipper so that he’ll come back. I didn’t turn into a mermaid to swim distant oceans just to see him, nor did I ride a magic carpet just to tell the whole world how much I loved him. I just went straight to bed, thought about him and told myself; “You’re a big girl now… and it’s about time you let go of that little Cinderella dream…”

             My heart now feels nothing but hatred To those who made me believe in a lie, Those who fooled me, Those who caused me so much pain, Those who made my dreams drift away, Those who took away my happiness, Those who made my life miserable.  For so long, I have believed in something that wasn’t even there It took me time to know and realize the truth, It took me time before I was awaken from my stupidity, It took me time before I was brought back to the harsh reality.  To those people – “that” guy and “that” girl, They know who they are, I hope I never see them So that they wouldn’t have to face my fury. I hope they live long enough to face their own karma.  Time will come, They’ll be the ones believing in lies, They’ll be the ones fooled, They’ll be the ones feeling more than thrice the pain they’ve caused me, They’ll be the ones, whose dreams will shatter, They’ll be the ones unhappy, They’ll be the ones miserable.  By that time, I have gained the strength and have moved on, Have forgotten what they did to me, And have finally found the happiness they once took away from me.

             I want you to know how much I care, yet you still smirk and stare To know that I am finally falling when it is that you don’t even mind How will you know?  I want you to know how much I value you while you were in such a big hurry How am I to tell you that I love you when you not even cherish our time How will you then know?  I want you to know that I enjoy being with you but you just smirk and snicker like a fool Wish you’d know how much I wish for you  But as always, you were busy How will you thereupon know?  Times are when i needed you so badly All I want was a simple grin from you But for once you didn’t even bother With how you arrogantly deal? How will you then promptly know?  You constantly indulge in my reveries but you seem so millions away from me that at times I could not reach you. But now you'll never know this things For those times you were not here with me  How absurd it is for me to still love you When it has been obvious enough That I see no reason for me not to But despite these things that befall… How will you know?

             The time is near for me to die I stared in the heaven above the sky I saw an angel so beautiful and kind The angel I thought I would never find  The feeling of love as I stare in her eyes I felt as if we had strong ties, But that’s too late my end is near I wonder why I felt no fear  In front of an angel I see clear Looked in her eyes and saw a tear She looked at me then began to cry, I held her hand and then asked why?  She said “I Love You”, Oh how it was true The feelings within I can’t explain My love for her I can’t contain  When I was about to tell what I feel My life just ended, I lost my dear What a shame I was too late Did I deserve such a cruel fate  I wish my angel knew what I felt, I should have done it before and got it dealt I love you my angel but what a sad good bye The last thing that I did was to make you cry

             watching you sleep through the night, I’ll stay beside you to hug you tight, I looked at you and heaved a sigh, I know I love you and I know you know why.  Everything about you amazes me, I love you and I want everyone to see, I have a feeling that’s so true, My heart and I belongs to you.  Seeing you sleeping in my arms tonight, Sets my heart to dance in delight, God blessed me with an angel like you, To love &amp; care for me that only you could do,  At your lips, I gently planted a gentle kiss, Which sends my heart totally into a bliss, I cherish you, my precious darling, And together, we’ll awake in the morning.  I closed my eyes and I can still see, A vision of my beloved baby, Your charm, my dear is truly magnificent, It is unexplainable like an enchantment.  Your lips is soft and willing, Enough to make this wonderful feeling, I love the way you look and stare, You make my feelings kindle and flare.  So I drifted off to sleep thinking about nothing but you, What tomorrow may bring, we have no clue, We just held each other tight, And it lasted throughout the night.  I do believe in things like forever, And I know we’ll reach forever together, I do need and love my precious honey, I’m talking about no one but you baby...

             Lest in my reverie I did not understand Imaginable facts I didn’t see In life I see nothing but thee You make my world go round As far as I can be Inspiring who I am That is who you are to me A blessing from Almighty That’s why I thank thee Now I understand Latter did I see The impossible joy You bring to me

             Our first time together felt extraordinary There were full of laughter and serenity I thought that forever it would be like this Because of me, we ended up our bliss  In a moment, things began to change from afar, I fervently miss our past But now it's over, it’s all my fault I could curse myself for letting it pass  Today, I yearn for our times together I thought I could live alone by myself how stupid I was to let you go My pride took over and left you then  I want you to know how much I love you Things were not like this before I met you How sorry I am for what I have done Please do forgive me…love me like before again…

             I'm broken into pieces I lie on the floor with shattered dreams and hopes I cry on my bed burying my face Thinking of the way it should be in that place  I stumble and I fell It just didn't turn out so well I saw you talking and laughing While I was here all alone, crying.  I never thought I'd feel this way again To feel this pain I never wished to gain I hope I could find someone who'd never make me blue Who would never hurt me the way you do.

             From the corner of my eye I saw a glimpse of you Out from my lips cam a sigh From a heart that shouts for you  I hear your melodic laughter I see your brilliant smile My dream of us together Is all that is worthwhile  I long to touch your slender hand To feel it clasping into mine And suddenly rays of light shine Each day I live is a burden  Each second of you, tormented For like the roses in a garden They’re soft but the thorns are wicked I can cot find enough bravery  Nor do I have the courage For the love that moves inside of me Is silent in its outrage So here I wonder of how long I’ll wait Of how this love stands true  For though I suffer from my fate Still, I’d be loving only you

             In this world full of lies, Blinding my innocent eyes, Nobody heard my sorrowful cries, I can only make a deep sigh.  Since the day that you came, My life has never been the same, You made my heart tamed, Hope my love for you may remain.  I may leave my promise untrue, But it had never made me blue, Now I really knew, I had fallen in love with you.  Is this serendipity!? Or part of my fantasy!? No, must’ve been reality, It ended up all my misery.  Even if life is so bad, Meeting you has been glad, Losing you will be sad, You’re the true love I’ve ever had.  You have done so much for me, You even set my heart free, And made me want to see, The world as it should be.  Thanks for being there, For the love you always share, For being the one who cares, Losing you I really can’t bear.  I love you my dear, I really wish you are here, Beside me, oh so near, Sweetest words you want to hear.  So, if today I’ll die, And in earth’s soil I may lie, I do not wish to see you cry, Even if I said my last goodbyes…

      Tears drying up At the corner of my sight Reminiscing the moment Mourning with all my might  Can I not contain The emptiess that I feel? Still I imagine If these things are real  Rainbows of wishes I keep on counting Take it from my heart The melodies I sing  Have angels waken up To make me see the reality? Or the cupids mistake me For someone who’s more worthy  Pictures I keep on holding Letters I keep on reading Moments in my mind still lingering Thru it all it’s him I keep on loving  To me he has left nothing But plain old me instead Imbude in me was all the hurt All the blame and the things he said  This foolishness I’ve been When will it have to end Or for lifetimes I may have foreseen When will I stop to pretend  Whatever life can bring me in time I may have ran out of my rhyme But still I believe that it’s you and me Though ever after’s are not for us to see

        meantime girl   She’s the one you call when you’re bored because she makes you laugh… she’s the one you talk to when you’re feeling down because she’s willing to lend an ear and be a friend… She’s not the one you call when you need a date to your company’s Christmas party, or to go dancing with on a Saturday night… She’s the one you spend time with between girlfriends, before you find "The One." You know, the one who you keep around in the meantime.She’s not one of the guys, not a tomboy, but you don’t look at her as "real woman" either. She’s not *****y enough, moody enough, or sexy enough to be seen in that light. She’s too laid-back, too easily amused by the same things your male buddies are amused by. She’s too understanding… too comfortable --- she doesn’t make you feel nervous or excited the way a "real woman" does. But she’s cool, and nice, and funny, and attractive enough that when you’re lonely or horny and need intimate female companionship, she’ll do just fine…You don’t have to wine and dine her because she knows the real you already, and you don’t have any facades to keep up, no pretenses to preserve. You’re not trying to get anything of substance out of her. She’s not easy, but you know that she cares about you, and is attracted to you, and that she’ll give you the intimacy you need. And you know you don’t have to explain yourself or the situation… that she’ll be able to cope with the fact that this isn’t the beginning of a relationship or that there’s any possibility that you have any real romantic feelings for her. It won’t bother her that you’ll get up in the morning, put on your pants, say goodbye, and go on a date with the woman you’ve been mooning over for weeks who finally agreed to go out with you. She’ll settle for a goodbye hug and a promise to call her and tell her how the date went. She’s just so cool… why can’t all women be like that?!..But deep down, if you really think about it (which you probably don’t because to you, the situation between the two of you isn’t important enough to merit any real thought), you know that it’s really not fair. You know that although she would never say it, it hurts her to know that despite all her good points and all the fun you two have, you don’t think she’s good enough to spend any real time with.Sure, it’s mostly her fault, because she doesn’t have to give in to your needs --- she could play the hard-to-get-***** like the rest of them do, if she really wanted to. But you and she both know that she probably couldn’t pull it off. Maybe she’s too short, or a little overweight, or has a big birthmark on her forehead, or works at Taco Bell, or just really not that type. Whatever the reason somehow. Life has given her a lot of really great qualities but has left out the ones that men want (or think they want) in a woman. So she remains forever the funny friend… the steadfast companion… the secret lover… and you go on searching for your goddess who will somehow be everything you ever wanted in a woman.You’ll joke to her that she should be the best man at your wedding, and she’ll laugh and make a joke about a smelly rental tux.She doesn’t captivate you with her beauty or open doors with her smile. Mainly she blends in with the crowd. She’s safe. She doesn’t want to be the center of attention and turn the heads of everyone in the room. But she wants to turn someone’s head. She wants to be special to someone too. We all do.She has feelings. She has a heart. In fact, she probably has a bigger and better heart than any woman you’ve ever known because she’s had a front row seat to "The Mess That Is Your Life", and she likes you anyway. She obviously sees something worthwhile and redeeming in you because although you’ve given her nothing, absolutely no reason to still be around, she is…

          When someone breaks your heart, you stop believing and you switch off the lights inside your heart. Someone is home but that someone is lying in the dark, in the room farthest from the gate, and that someone can't hear anything. Friends, family, they call out to her from the gate (" Come out" which means "Move on") but they are unheard, unseen, unacknowledged. When someone breaks your heart, you turn into a small ball of self-pity. You lie in bed, in a ball. You hug your knees, keeping them close to your chest, like a fetus. Freud said its human instinct to go back to the womb where we can feel safe. But that's what happens when someone breaks your heart-they steal the very thing that makes you feel safe, whole, and intact.      So much for all those lines that speak about, quite of “unrequited love”, and the need to feel love and be loved… the next statements you’ll be able to read are all from the heart of a simple girl who was once captivated by the eyes of a person she mistook to be an angel… then the next morning she woke up, learned how to love, to get hurt, to stand up and be whole again.  What is the sound of my heart breaking?  It is the sound beneath the silence… deafening silence… that I want to run away just to get rid and get over not of that silence, but of the pain that keeps on maiming my heart whenever I see him smile and the reason is not me.  The sound of the angst I feel for myself, the sound of the voices inside me murmuring, “Why can’t I be like her? If she was me, will he ignore her like he does to me? If I were her, will he love me like he does to her?” I wonder… I wander in the midst of that dark sky in a sunny afternoon.  It is the sound of the million “Ouch! Aray! Awww!”s that keeps on running through my deepest veins. The sound of the breeze of the wind I wanted to catch and grasp in my hand, just as much as I want to hug him tight, so that I will never ever lose him… which I was never able to do in these 3 long years I have known him and is still, becoming a part of my chapter…  The sound of the love calculator I just checked out for our compatibility, only to find out we’re only 22% compatible, while they are 78%... don’t you feel the same feeling of the sound of a thousand miles I wanted to run for me to catch up with 56% more? Nakakahingal yun ah! But then I thought to myself, “Bakit hindi? Sa pag-ibig, walang nakakapagod… walang nakakahingal… walang nakakauhaw… walang nakakagutom… pag-ibig eh”.  It is the sound of a pen striking in a notepad, unstoppable, like I foresee this love of mine… how it grows at a stronger and uncountable rate each and everyday I thank God I found someone like him… who inspires me to do my best… and to be the greatest pain, the greatest joy, and greatest reason why I am writing this junk stuff. But I stopped for a while and think… if this will be forever… isn’t that too much to take? Won’t I ever break? I hope not… I guess not… why would he if he makes me complete… despite the fact the he empties the preemptied?  It is the sound of “message sending failed” in my cell phone. I want to txt him, I really want to… and I failed even though I haven’t tried. That’s more frustrating, don’t you think?  It is the sound of his laughter whenever he gets to talk to her, but a thousand echoes of the broken arrows of cherubim who try to shoot his heart and so he won’t take his eyes off me.  It is the sound of the cracks and grinds of my heart sprinkled with nuisance injected in me… I wonder if I haven’t been immune by this. It happened before, so many times before.  Why am I writing this? I don’t know either. There are so many things we think we know, but the truth is, we don’t have any idea about it. That is, when we’re in love. Lucky are those who feel the greatest thing we’ll ever know… to love and be loved in return; one-sided love, lucky too, of course! Because it’s better to have loved and lost than to never love at all… since the day I learned to breathe, I LIVE TO LOVE.     The experience of love is an inner state. When this is present, you are happy, alive and free. You feel good about yourself and good about life. As you bring the experience of love into your life, life works effortlessly and great things happen.  The opposite of love is fear and upset. When this is present, you close down inside. You lose your creativity and your ability to see clearly. You get tunnel vision and you interact in a way that almost always makes your situation worse.  Whether you live in a state of love or a state of upset depends, not on your circumstances, but on how your relate to your circumstances. A good way to see this is to look at upsets.  Upsets seem to be caused by what happens but they're not. Upsets are caused by your fighting and resisting what happens. To see this in your life, select a recent upset. Now notice what would happen if somehow you were at peace with what happened. There would be no upset.  There would be no upset because upsets aren't caused by what happened. Upsets are caused by fighting and resisting what happened. The moment you take away the fighting and resisting, the upset disappears.  To live in the experience of love, and to create a life that works, you need to stop the fighting and resisting. You do this through a process called "letting go."  Letting go is the inner action that releases the fear and upset. The moment you let go, everything seems to change. With the fear and upset gone, you see your situation very differently. You become creative and discover solutions that you could never have seen before.  To let go, you need to do the opposite of fighting and resisting. You need to let go of your demands and expectations for how life should be and make peace with the way life is.  Find what you are resisting. Then give it full permission to be there. If you have a fear of losing a relationship, be willing to lose it. If you are resisting the way someone is, give the person full permission to be that way.  Be willing for anything. Set yourself free inside. Then take whatever action you need to have your life be great.  Keep in mind that letting go is a state of mind and has nothing to do with your actions. Letting go is the process that removes the fear and upset so you can see what action you need to take.  In your heart, you can be willing to lose someone, but in your actions, do everything you can to make sure the person feels so loved that he or she would never want to leave.  To make letting go a little easier, there are several steps you can take. The first is trusting. Trust that no matter what happens, you will be okay. When you know that you will be okay, letting go becomes relatively easy.  Trusting is also telling the truth. You really will be okay no matter what happens. Life is only threatening when you resist. So stop resisting and trust. Trust that no matter what happens, you will be okay.  The second step in the process of letting go is to be willing to feel your hurt. Be willing to feel all the hurt and the feelings of being not okay that your circumstances reactivate. Be willing to feel the hurt of being worthless or not good enough.  The avoidance of this hurt is what makes you resist. Once you are willing to feel this hurt, the need to resist disappears. You can then let go.  For example, Robert had a fear of losing his wife Jan. To make sure she didn't leave, he hung on to her. His hanging on then pushed her further and further away. Robert was afraid of losing Jan because if she left him, this would reactivate all his hurt of feeling not worth loving. To avoid this hurt. He hung on.  Once he was willing to feel his hurt, the loss of Jan ceased to be a treat. He no longer needed to hang on and became willing for her to leave. The moment this happened he changed the way he related to her. Instead of needing Jan, he started treasuring her. Jan then felt so loved and able to be herself, she didn't want to leave.  This is what happens in life. The more you are able to let go and flow with life, the more life takes care of itself. You may not always get what you want, but you can always be free inside. You can restore both your peace of mind and your effectiveness. You can create a life that works.

          Love can't do anything for you.  Love, if we're going to be honest, is what you do for others.                    Love may change your life, but it also can ruin it.  Real love won't change you, though.    Biblically, love can overcome anything. I mean here anything. I guess this means that I have to believe in it. But then, I've never experienced true love. It would be hard to believe that some people as what they have felt of known, they have known love. Not in my parents, not in boyfriends, not in friends - not through or from anyone. Because love, contrary to what we all expect, is not perfect. Love is nothing fancy. In the purest form, it's you down on your knees serving another. Love can't make anyone into anything they're not. And if you're honest with yourself, you don't love someone and want them to change, you love them for who they are right then and there, or you've never actually loved them at all, you only loved yourself. Romantic love doesn't mean you'll get to be with that person you love or you get to cuddle with that special someone for a day just to prove that it is love. So maybe you were told love can conquer all. It can, but real love does not seek its own. Some things it will not set out in conquest after, I've seen what love can do and what it can't do; but this I know... REAL love never fails. It's always there, regardless of what happens. It's not circumstantial. The moment it is, it's no longer love. That's what love is to me.

      I may have found the abstract side of my "irrational" self by this stupid sentiments unleashed. It would not be me if I pretend to be okay even if im not. Recently, things have been so fast and direct that it has passeed through my mind like a whirlwind and whether i like it or not, i have no choice but to approve myself of the possibilities and the thingsthat have been currently preccupying my mind. I know deep within me that this is not a dream. Girl, this is the REALITY. The reality ive started to neglect and to reconsider, ive made a dream without this reality of which i wish it were not true. But the opposing forces of my mind keep on colliding that i lost myself for regaining the existing belief, i had started from where i think now is some sort of a lost fate. Now, pitifully, i must say that i have started to earn a degree for myself that instead of me being pulled up, i am pulled down my own esteem of seeing no other that what is obvious and what i think now is abnormal but for him, is VERY NORMAL. Now, how can i face my unpredictable world with me believing that everything is not normal but for him, NOTHING'S CHANGE? well if he thinks that providing a sole time with himself is much better with me clinging into him on a saturday night, simply forgetting to remind me of daily usuals which he unmindfully notices the that everything is not just normal and usual, if he thinks that him not even talking to me for more than five minutes in a day personally is normal, then it provides a n absurd explanation which up to now, i still cannot perceive. I will only see a foolish me crying and wailing over him with a reason i still cannot provide. Now, i now don't even know what to do. Maybe i was just influenced by his abnormality. If only he knew all this, but would he listen?
