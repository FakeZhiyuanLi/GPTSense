      These quotes are from the movie Super Troopers, which was made by a comedy troupe called Drunken Lizard. If you haven't seen it, you really should.   Mac: Oh, c'mon, we're like the sons you never had.  Captain O'Hagan: If you were my son, Mac, I would've smothered you by now.  Mac: Smothered me in gravy you big dirty man!   Farva: Just cleaning out the old locker, she stinks like ass but I'll sure miss her.. I guess you could say that about all my girls.   Captain O'Hagan: I swear to God I'm going to pistol whip the next guy who says, " Shenanigans." Mac: Hey Farva what's the name of that restaurant you like with all the goofy shit on the wall and the mozzarella sticks? Farva: You mean Shenanigans? You guys talking about Shenanigans?  As they hand the Captain their pistols    Foster: Do I look like a cat to you meow? Do you see me jumpin' around all nimbly bimbly from tree to tree? Do I lick milk from a saucer? DO YOU SEE ME EATING MICE?

      No, I'm not coming out of the closet. Here's what a metrosexual is:  - Is modern, usually single man in touch with himself;  - Grooms and buffs his head and body, which he drapes in fashionable clothing both at work or before hitting an      evening hotspot;  - Has discretionary income to stay up to date with the latest hairstyles, the newest threads, and the right shaped shoes;  - Makes same guys jealous of his success with the ladies -- for many metros, to interact with women is to flirt;  - Impresses the women who enjoy his company with the details that make the man;  Among them:  his appreciation for literature, cinema, or other arts  his flair for cooking  his savoir faire in choosing the perfect wine and music  his eye for interior design  is a city boy or, if living a commute away from downtown, is still urbane, if not rightly urban;  enjoys reading men's magazines...  I think they've got me, with the exception of being very urban. I appear so and people that don't know me very well think that of me, but I was raised on a peanut farm and can be very country when I need to be. After all, I live in Oklahoma!

      I'll be damn, it really is New Years. Huh? No, I don't have any plans yet. Possibly because I am so fucking OLD. I could go to Bricktown. But 50,000 people and no parking don't do it for me. I could stay home. No, that would seal my fate as a social outcast. I suppose I will go to Norman and hang out with my excellent Fraternity Brothers. I don't get to hang out with them very often, and they are good guys. I suppose we will go to Mr. Bills for karaoke and beer. But not too much since I'll have to drive somewhere I'm sure. And from Bills I'm positive some of my buddies will have a party or something, so I'll probably bounce around town. Maybe I'll stay down there with some friends. Right now I am doing some quotes online and watching the Sun Bowl on Channel 9. Minnesota and Oregon are playing. I'm pulling for Oregon, just because I've seen them play a few times, and they gained some national prominence when Byron Leftwich was their quarterback. They game is all tied at 7, in the second quarter. I'm confident Oregon will pull it out, as their running game seems to be in top shape today.   Well, I guess that's about it. I'll put some a funny quote and perhaps some stories up later.

      "...take yesterday for example. We were out at the olive garden for dinner, which was lovely. I happened to look over, at a certain point during the meal, to see a waitress taking an order, and I found myself wondering what color her underpants might be, her panties. Odds are they were basic white cotton underpants, but I started thinking maybe they are silk panties, maybe it's a thong, maybe it's something really cool I don't even know about..."

      One of my most excellent friends Jessica sent me an email regarding my website. A few words on Jess. She is a beautiful red-haired girl that I met at OU my freshman year, just when I was coming into my own as a supreme womanizer and beer drinker. We kept in touch for a couple of years, but then we fell off of each other's radar screens, as college friends do. I joined a fraternity, started working, and got a girlfriend. I'm not sure what she did, but now she is doing PR at a large firm here in OKC, and we had lunch a couple of weeks ago. And she is married now. But here's the email. It strikes me as funny because it's about the same thing I was thinking about last weekend.  "Tell me something...  When do you get to the point in life when insurance jokes, quotes about money, and business blunders become funnier than sex, gay, and sports jokes? Is it when you're out of college, or just when you start being sober? I think it's hilarious that "say something funny" compelled you to write about convenience store insurance on Christmas Eve, rather than some joke about Bob Stoops beating the crap out of Mack Brown, or some equally stupid joke....you're an old, old man!  Just kidding...I found the story amusing because of your skillful use of profanity, but really...you're, what, 23? Throw a few "Old School" quotes among the "Godfather" and "Boiler Room" jokes. Not because I don't enjoy them (I loved "Boiler Room") but because you could still be a drunk, lazy, happily laid college kid if you wanted! Remember when all we watched on TV was Skinemax, football, and horrible WB shows?  I feel so old...I don't miss school, but I sure miss all that free time before work took over. I miss staying up til 4 AM to drink and watch movies. Now if I'm up til 4 AM it's because I'm sick, husband is sick, or I'm working. Anyway, just thought I'd comment on your website! I guess as young professionals, there's more to lose when you get drunk and don't remember how you got home! And so it goes..."   I knew that my use of profanity was pretty fucking cool. Jessica makes a good point. I am only 23. I have largely given up my later "party" years in favor of starting a business and becoming a filthy rich Republican. I was thinking about this the day after Christmas, when I was thinking about what I wanted for Christmas and what I got. Here are some of the things I wanted:  1) Dress socks and undershirts (the kind without the tag that Michael Jordan hawks)  2) A headset for my cell phone, so when I am on it with clients for hours at a time in my car my arm won't get so tired.  3) Cash, so I could go buy dress slacks and long sleeve golf shirts for work.  That was all I really wanted. I am a boring ass. In my defense, I do have a lot of fun, and I like to think that I am still fun to hang out with, but my tastes have changed dramatically. I do live for movies like The Godfather Trilogy's, Boiler Room, Wall Street, and Scarface. But what guy doesn't? I also loved "Old School". I would like to think I laugh harder at Celebrity Jeopardy on SNL, because it speaks to me. I loved "Bad Boys 2", and all the Matrix Movies. So I think I am ok in the movie department.   I personally thought the gas station story was funny, but you would kinda have to be in insurance to enjoy it. I work in a very old industry. Most agents are "gray hairs". I am a new breed of young and brash agents who are out to change the industry, one client at a time. They funny thing is, I really believe that. I'll be one of the best agents ever, and I will consider my life a waste if I'm not the most successful agent in OKC. But that's just how I am. When I do party, I party hard as shit. When I sleep, I'm the best. When I work, don't get in my way. When I watch TV or play Playstation, I do it better than anyone. I have 2 speeds. On, and Off.   Jessica has some good points, so what I've decided to do, is for the rest of this week, pretend like I am a little less responsible. For instance, Friday, when the Cotton Bowl is on? I will watch it in my office on my TV. With the door open! I may even sneak down to Hudsons for a cold Shiner.   I suppose I only post stuff on my website that relates to my work, because a lot of my personal stuff may incriminate people that read it. But I'll try to loosen up and have more stuff about my personal life that is funny, and maybe some political stuff,  and hopefully some naked stuff.   On one note though, I really do have to be careful about drinking and driving, as I could lose my insurance license and my First Responder certification. Oh, and it's incredibly ignorant and stupid.   Ok, this post if way too long. Thanks for sticking with me through the ramblings. If anyone would like to see more stuff on my site, email me and let me know. There is a link on the upper right hand side of the page.

      Something funny.... Oh, ok, nevermind. I was reading back over my blog and realized I have been very lazy. Now, I know we all love cool quotes and jokes, but I haven't posted anything of substance since..... well, really since i started..... but in the last two weeks or so. But nothing has really happened that I thought was very funny, or could be relayed to you guys as funny. A really funny website to go to is   Home Star Runner    It's pretty funny. At least, I think so, and all of my fraternity buddies, and a bunch of other people who have linked it. Let's see, what else has been funny? I had a lady call up on Christmas Eve wanting an insurance binder on a convenience store. There are several funny parts to that.   1) An insurance binder actually places coverage on the item. It also hold the agent financially responsible.  2) It usually takes at least 3 to 4 days to get a quote for a commercial policy. They are very complex.  3) I was working on Christmas Eve, but no one else was. Especially no underwriters, who are the ones that get the quotes done.  4) A convenience store is very, very hard to write, and they are also very, very complex. It's something about placing insurance on a building that sits atop huge-ass tanks filled with HIGHLY FLAMMABLE GAS!!!! Oh, and Self Serve!  5) The lady barely spoke English, and had little comprehension of what it takes to get that done.  6) And she wanted a binder good for only 30 days. So apparently she only needed a piece of paper that showed she "had" insurance to show her landlord.  I guess in the phonebook it must have  "most gullible, ignorant red-neck asshole insurance agent ever"  . Are you fucking kidding me? How about I just go say bomb at the airport. That will get me into about as much trouble as giving anything to this lady. Does she really think anyone will say "Gee, you sound really nice, and I'd love to help you out on Christmas Eve, and since you desperately need insurance on a gas station, I'll take my life and insurance license into my own hands and bind coverage on your ticking time-bomb gas station"   She has since called back a few times, and my voicemail was more than happy to handle it. Now, I try to take all of my calls that I can, and I sincerely want to talk to all of my clients and prospects so they can get the best service that I could ever give, but if you are just calling me to waste my fucking time, you will get the voicemail most of the time. Unless you are a client. If you are a client of mine and you get the voicemail, it is because I am busy with another client, and in my agency everyone is equal.

      Airman Jones was assigned to the induction center, where he advised new recruits about their government benefits, especially their GI insurance.  It wasn't long before Captain Smith noticed that Airman Jones was having a staggeringly high success rate, selling insurance to nearly 100% of the recruits he advised.   Rather than asking him about this, the Captain stood at the back of the room and listened to Jones' sales pitch.   Jones explained the basics of GI insurance to the new recruits, and then said, "If you are killed in a battle and have GI insurance, the government has to pay $200,000 to your beneficiaries. But, if you don't have GI insurance and get killed in battle, the government only has to pay a maximum of $6,000."   "Now," he concluded, "which group do you think they are going to send into battle first?"

      Every Saturday morning, an avid golfer gets up early to catch his morning tee time and spends the day playing golf.   One Saturday morning, as is his schedule, he gets up early, eats a quick breakfast and heads out to the course. The weather is terrible; there's a torrential downpour with snow mixing in and a 50 mph wind.  Defeated, he comes back into the house and turns the TV on to the weather channel, which informs him it's only going to get worse. He puts his clubs back into the closet, quietly undresses, then slips back into bed with his wife.   "The weather out there is terrible," he whispers.  "Yeah," she replies, "can you believe my stupid husband is out golfing?"

      I remember when the biggest part of my day was just going to school. Or when the biggest headache I had was whether I wanted chicken strips or cheese fries for lunch. Now the biggest headache I get is whether or not my career is taking off, or when I'll meet a hot girl, or how IN THE HELL I am going to get a surety bond written for a referral. Or asking myself at 2am whether or not I mailed off a premium! So I have decided that should I ever meet a creature perfect enough for me that I want to settle down and have kids, I am going to let them remain kids as long as I can.

      One of my great friends just emailed me some Dan Quayle quotes. I always forget how dumb he was sometimes. Here's a few of my favorites. Thanks Sarah!  A low voter turnout is an indication of fewer people going to the polls. Dan Quayle  It isn't pollution that's harming the environment. It's the impurities in our air and water that are doing it. Dan Quayle  What a waste it is to lose one's mind. Or not to have a mind is being very wasteful. How true that is. Dan Quayle  We're going to have the best-educated American people in the world.

      The movie  A Bronx Tale  has many great lessons. Here's my favorite.  Lesson # 1    It's better to be feared than loved   Like Chazz Palminteri's character Sonny says, "It's nice to be both, but very difficult." He goes on: "Fear lasts longer than love... it's fear that keeps them loyal."   Power and money help instill fear in others and allow you to take control and become a father figure to your crew.   "I treat my men good, but not too good, or I'm not needed. I give just enough so that they need me, but they don't hate me," says Sonny.   - A Bronx Tale   Love is fleeting, that's why I don't trust it. Friendship is just as bad. Most friendships in my business are based on money and are meaningless once the money stops. The people who laugh at my jokes only do so because I help them get a paycheck. I know that and they know that. Same thing goes for those skanks who ask about your job and your car before they ask your name.   Keep your people together by making them fear you.

      Some people may think I am crazy, but I really like being at work. I've almost always liked my jobs, because I am rather picky about where I go to work. But I really love this one. I very seriously think it may be because it is my business. Mine! All mine! I don't have a boss. I can come and go as I please. All the money is mine! Now, don't get me wrong. Working for other people is definitely easier. When I first got into insurance, I made the contacts, did the quotes, sold the policies, and that was about it. Maybe I'd send out Christmas cards. Now, I make the contacts, do the quotes, sell the policies, handle the premiums, handle the finances, handle the marketing, I have to take all my calls, answer every email, and every night I stay up worrying about how successful I will be in the future. There are lots of pros and cons. I admire people that work for a paycheck. They get up, go to work, do a job, and get paid a pre-determined amount of money for it. To tell the truth, sometimes I think that would be nice. But I have chosen to take risks with my future, my credit, and my financial stability, to hopefully build something bigger than myself. I sincerely believe that it will be worth all the Pepto, all the worrying, all the lack of dispensable income, and all the work. I am about to start work on an account that will not only make my career, but will likely make me a millionaire in 3 to 4 years. That's nuts to say. I can't even fathom it. I'm still not convinced it will happen. But the person who is bringing me the account says it very well can be done, and I trust him as much as I can trust anyone. It will make me a very large agent. Very large. The account is so large, I'm having trouble finding insurance companies that can take it. If I do close it, I'm buying something European and convertible, and I'm going to buy another insurance agency. If I can find a good agency that earns $7K or $8K a month, I will be set for life. I'll have a large agency that I can grow, and I will. And I'll have one big fish that will bring me others. Which I will go get. I'm not afraid of hard work, and certainly not of success. We'll see how it goes. For right now it is one account at a time, and worrying all the time. Break out the Pepto! Or JD...

      So I was thinking about the Christmas holiday, and I've been listening to the radio a lot and talking to a lot of different people. And I've come to some conclusions about Christmas. Christmas is a magical time of the year for most, well, most children. My nieces and nephews are so excited about it they can barely contain themselves. I remember as a child that Christmas was the absolute best. You got to do cool stuff at school, you got to do cool stuff at home, the house was always decorated, and my mother always cooked a ton of food. But now I realize just how lucky I was growing up. Even after my parents divorced in 1991, I still always had great Christmases. I just had to go to two houses. But I always had plenty of food and plenty of presents, and even after my parents divorced and money was tight for me and my mom, she always worked overtime for the month before to buy be whatever I wanted. I suppose I am just now realizing how freaking lucky I am. This year more than any, I have either heard, or listened to, more stories about the less fortunate and needy people than I can ever remember hearing. My sister told me of this nurse friend of her's that had some strange snafu with a check she deposited and some checks she wrote, and somehow it turned out that her account is overdrawn some $1,000 dollars, and she has presents for people but can't get to Ohio, I think, to give them to her family. And this morning on the radio I listened to a Sailor that is getting to spend Christmas with his family for the first time in 6 years. He flew in to LA last week, and has been driving to Missouri since then. He was traveling through Oklahoma this morning and expected to be home tonight. Then, early next week he has to drive to Virginia for deployment to the Middle East. I wish this Sailor all the luck in the world. I also listened to a Private who was home for the holidays, but he didn't have any money to buy his parents something for Christmas, so he called to radio station to tell them he loved him. Here we have a soldier, someone who is actively putting his life on the line for the U.S., and he can't afford to buy his own mother and father a present. Now, I'm not the kind of guy that cries, or really ever shows any emotion at all. But when I listen to the stories of some of these troops, or even worse of the children that aren't getting anything at all this year, maybe not even a hot meal, it really tears me up inside. I heard some song on an old country station Friday night that was about a note that a man found on the street, and it turned out to be a letter to Santa, and in it the child's father had lost his job and they were living in their car now. And all the kid wanted for Christmas was job for his dad, and a new coat for his mom, since her's was old and thin. Now, I realize it was just a song, but I also know that could be a true story that is true for hundreds of kids. And my sister did Toys for Tots this year, and she did an incredible job. She really got a ton of toys for the kids around her area, but just think what could happen if everyone got just one or two gifts for underprivileged kids. So it is too late this year, but next year, mark my words. I will bug the hell out of everyone I know to get toys and clothes for kids, and phone cards and presents for the troops and their children. I will be a burr under everyone's saddles, and I won't wait until December to do it. So, starting next August or so, get ready. The part about it that pisses me off is I know how children are. After Christmas break, all the kids will be in class talking about all the really cool stuff they got, and all the cool stuff they did, and I know that there are kids who didn't get anything, maybe didn't spend time with family, that will either sit there and say nothing, or make up stuff they didn't get, just so they won't be embarrassed. And that really pisses me off. So take my advice, and I'll take it too. The next time you get pissed because you can't buy that new Playstation 2 game, or because you can't go to Vegas in the spring, or the next time something doesn't go your way at work, think about all the kids who don't get squat for Christmas, and all the troops who are spending Christmas away from their families and children on the other side of the world in some sweaty hell hole, or stateside in another state. Just think about all the shit you do have, rather than all the shit you don't. Now, I intend to be a rich man, and I will do everything within my power to make that happen as soon as possible, but I can promise that you will never see me take advantage of it, or use my power and money to help others. Oh, and next year, I don't want any presents from anyone. Buy a toy or phone card for me to donate.

      Is it just me, or is it a little warmer outside today? And a little sunnier. And what's that? I'm not sick anymore. And I'm in a good mood. Great. Hopefully today will go by rather quickly. I only have one new business account on my desk, being as it is almost Christmas, and business generally slows down. The last thing a business owner wants to do right now is bother with his commercial insurance right before the big day. So it makes my job a little slower. I calculate that by Monday I will be done with all of the paperwork I have yet to catch up on, and this new account should be handled by today, if the guy will call me back. So, it is a good day, and we will see where it leads. I'll try to post a joke or a rant later.

      If any of you know me very well, you know I live and breathe off of Shiner Bock beer. I'm not an alchoholic, nor a drunk. But I really, really love Shiner Bock. I like it more than water or even Diet Coke. Now, since it is alchoholic and has calories, I can't drink it as much as water or Diet Coke, I still love it the most. I could really use a Shiner today. A Shiner would be great. There is something about getting out of the office, opening up a cold bottle of Shiner, and taking that first sip that just makes all of your problems go away, but just for a little while. I guess it's the same feeling some people get when they shower, or go outside. But instead of going to my usual Shiner Thursday night down at Bison Witches in Norman, I am going to the Mid-America Vo-Tech to assist my brother with his EMT-Basic level practicals. These are the same people that "assisted" him during my First Responder practicals, so I am eager to act as cool and calm as they did when I was all sweaty and nervous. Just like they are going to be tonight. BWWAHAHAHA!!!!! That was my evil laugh. I really do think it will be fun, and hopefully I'll learn a little more by watching them go through the ropes. Anything I can learn that will let me help other people is ok with me! Regardless, I think it will be cool to do, I am going to be the medical patient, I will have to show symptoms and they will have to diagnose me. My first acting job! Wow. Actually, you could count my last relationship as acting.... bada bing! pow!

      If a stronger enemy assails you,  better bend like the reed by the stream.  Do not rear like an angry snake  if unremitting prosperity is what you seek.  Following the lowly manner of the reed  a man gains great prosperity in time.  Adopting the overbearing manner of the snake,  he is simply courting death.  *Excerpt from Pancatantra  The moral? Better to bend like a reed than attack like a snake. The reed is buoyant, pliable and endures with time. Mighty oaks may break in a vicious storm, but reeds stand firm and last.

      I've been slacking off quite a bit lately. But I'm still sick and pretty busy at the office so actually getting the energy up to write is pretty hard. I have put up a couple of "quotes of the day", But I can't really count that. I'm really tired too. I was up all night coughing and sneezing, and playing Tiger Woods 2004... I'm searching for an apartment now. I finally figured out I am not going to find a house that meets my expectations that doesn't cost too much. It's not really the money, some of the places are nice 2 bedroom houses in Nichols Hills, and they generally run for $700 or $800 a month. But that is an awful lot for a young bachelor who is never home anyway to spend on rent. Maybe next year after I close my big fish account. Actually, then I'm just going to buy a small house in Nichols Hills to tide me over until I get married. Which, knowing me will be about 20 years from now, seeing as how I haven't dated anyone seriously since Becky and I broke up last May. Truthfully, I haven't dated anyone at all. Women are really hard to meet, and I've been concentrating on career building anyway. I would have to ignore a girlfriend now, and wouldn't get to spend a lot of time with her. But, if I could find another young professional, like a very attractive news anchor at Channel 9, I would definitely go for it. Other than that, I guess you could say I have been filling my time with distractions. Except for one young lady I have been pursuing that is very hard to catch. But of course, it wouldn't be anything serious even if we did date, because I think I may be incapable of having strong feelings for any girl now. Isn't it a bitch what ex-girlfriends do to a guy?

      My adorable and cute nieces and nephews got uncle James sick this weekend. Yay! I love those kids to death, and when they start to cry when you tell them you can't hug them because they are sick, you just gotta give in. But it leads to the inevitable, the flu or whatever this crap is. Stuffy head, snotty nose, coughing and low-grade temp. Just great....

      It's pretty cold here in Oklahoma. We have been under a Winter Weather Warning all day, but all that has been produced is some rain and a little ice. It's supposed to be snowing like crazy, but I guess the air is just a little too warm. Good for me though. I have to drive to Norman in a little while for a party. I'm excited. I get to drink and not have to worry about driving, since I'm staying the night where the party is. That's very good. No drinking or driving. Anyway, it's cold and raining, and maybe it'll start snowing in a little while.

      I was reading my favorite web site of all time, Ask Men.com, and I ran across some really funny comebacks.  If you are like me, single, handsome, young, yada yada!, you have probably been shot down quite a few times. I would say I've been shot down more than the average man, but it's mostly because I have the balls to go talk to  more girls than the average guy. So here are some male pick-up lines, followed by the woman's response, then followed by the guy's response to that. They are too damn funny!  Man: Haven't I seen you someplace before?  Woman: Yes that's why I don't go there anymore.  Man: Really? I heard it was because everyone there thinks you're a fat skank.   Man: Is this seat empty? Woman: Yes, and this one will be if you sit down.  Man: Probably because you'd be on your knees greeting my crotch.  Man: Your place or mine?  Woman: Both. You go to yours, and I'll go to mine.  Man: That's cool, 'cause after I get done nailing you in the back of my car... I don't give a crap where you go.   Man: Do you want to dance?  Woman: No!  Man: I think you misheard me. I said you look fat in those pants.   Ha ha ha!. Those are hilarious. If any of you women out there come across some that are reversed (i.e. woman vs. man) please email them and I will post them.

      * Authors note: I am a flag waving Patriot that is always behind America. I hate that other countries are jealous of us, but it is their own fault they suck. If I offend anyone in the international community, or any EU lovers, too bad. I bleed Sooner Red, White, Blue.  I am so tired of the international community.  urlLink This article on FoxNews.com  explains it all. Apparently Germany, France, and Russia are upset at the Pentagons decision to limit reconstruction contracts to US and coalition allies that supported the war in Iraq. What in the hell did they expect? They publicly tried to discredit and embarass the US before and during the war in Iraq, but now they expect us to give them contracts worth millions and billions of dollars? Go to hell.    Now, for International puppet theatre   France: "The war in Iraq is unfair and unjust, and the American evil empire should die. BUT, when you get done liberating the people and deposing Saddam, we'll fully expect you to award us reconstruction contracts worth millions of dollars."  U.S.A: "Yea, sorry about all of that France, but you guys are a bunch of pathetic assholes, who have to let us save your asses from the Germans every 50 years or so. Oh, and you didn't support or help deposing Saddam, you haven't lost any troops or equipment. How about you gay-ass wine and cheese lovers burn in hell? And yes, we are thinking about invading you. We don't think anyone will miss you."  Germany: "Dah, we wood likie der contracts and weinerschnietzel too!"  U.S.A: "Germany, your sausage is showing...."  Russia: "Yes, uh, comrade.... We would very much like to be awarded some contracts as well. We are a very poor and bleak country, and although we have been dealing with the pesky Chechnyan terrorists for years, we were too poor and ugly to come and help you in Iraq. But we really need some government contracts and potatoes."  U.S.A: "Thank you for chiming in Russia, but you were also very crappy with us about Iraq, so no soup for you! Seriously though, now that the superpower motherland is nothing but a former Soviet Republic, we really don't give a rats ass what you think. "  "OH!. And by the way. WE ARE GOING TO NEED ALL OF THE MONETARY AID WE HAVE BEEN GIVING YOU GUYS FOR THE LAST 100 YEARS BACK. What's that, no takers???"

      I think I confuse people with what I think a man is. So here goes:  A man doesn't shirk away from his responsibilities. A man works hard, no matter what he does, and provides for himself and his family. A man is a gentleman, and is modest in his accomplishments. A man is open-minded, but won't be pushed around. A man would never strike a woman in anger, or self-defense. A man doesn't pick fights, doesn't start arguments, and doesn't try to step on other's toes. A man is kind and gentle when he needs to be, but will bring fury from Heaven above if you harm his family, his nation, or him. A man is sensitive, but isn't a dribbling puddle of goo that needs constant reaffirmation from those around him. And a man doesn't complain about everything. If he can fix it, he will, if not, then he will bear his load quietly.   It is my firm belief that other males in my age group are sadly lacking in all of the above departments. I see men my father's and his father's age, and have nothing but respect and admiration for them. I'm not saying all men in my age group (18-30) are doomed, but we'd better suck it up quickly before we lose everything that was given to us. Our families, our country, our manhood, and most of all, our dignity.

      Major talking points of this blog. read on for the full text.  1) Every public nativity scene should not have every other religion represented "just because".  2) I'm a man and a gentleman, but I'm sick and damn tired of being PC all the time, and I think I'll stop. Life isn't fucking therapy, quit your crying and get back to work.  3) If you move to America, learn English. And if you are in line at Wal-Mart and making fun of or cussing the gringos, make sure I'm not around because I could make a Mexican Sailor blush.  Ok, I try to be as politically correct in public, and as understanding as the next guy. I do my best to be a gentleman, but dammit, I'm also a man. And I'm about sick and damn tired of men feminizing themselves to fit in with society's new "views" on how a man and a woman should interact. Here's the deal,  urlLink  this   article talks about how an overwhelming majority of Americans supports allowing nativity scenes on public property. But a smaller number thinks that if Christian scenes are going to be on public property, then other religions, such as Judaism, should also be allowed to display things, like a Menorah. Now I try to be as tolerant as any open-minded modern day man should be, but that is complete shit. Here's what I think. If I am in McAlester, OK, and the City Hall erects a Nativity scene, and no one bitches, that's great. If some that's Jewish or Muslim then objects, let them put a scene up. That's the difference I'm talking about. If it's a problem for them, let them do something about it. But to have to put something up representing every religion just because someone might be offended is horseshit. Here's the deal, and if I offend anyone email me so I can explain myself, but this is a country that was fundamentally founded by Christians, for Christians. I know, we are a "melting pot" of different people, BUT, fundamentally, based on Christian principles. I don't care if someone is Jewish, or Muslim, or African, or even a damn Frenchie. You are all entitled to celebrate how you want, and that right is protected by our great Constitution. But don't get your panty's in a wad if some public entity has a baby Jesus every year, but they don't light a Menorah. Simply ask them to put one up, but only if it really offends you. If you don't care, then it shouldn't bother you.   And another thing. If you come to America from another country, and you don't speak English, LEARN IT! I don't go to Argentina, or Nairobi, or France and expect everyone to speak English. If I moved there permanently, I would learn the damn native language. I'm so damn tired of every ATM I go to, every gas station I go to, and even highway signs being in Spanish. This is Mexico, or Spain. This is America. We speak English here. An overwhelming majority of the populus of the world speaks English. Jump on the damn bandwagon. I took 4 years of Spanish in high school, not to mention a year in college, and I can't hold a conversation with someone in it. I can cuss you out, which I have found out is the reason why I usually speak spanish. I'll have some smartass Mexican at a gas station or out at Wal-Mart that thinks they can badmouth everyone there because they are speaking a different language. Guess what ronita, you'd better be careful because some of us are as white and American as it gets, and we speak it too. So don't be surprised when someone turns around in line and tells you to callate haz de lena. Anyway, I hope I didn't offend anyone, if I did email me. But if I did, live with it.   I love diversity, and I am doing everything in my power to be a modern day Rennaisance man. But sometimes I feel like the American man is having his identity slowly leached away from him by the rest of the world. So we aren't in touch with our feminine side. We aren't women! We shouldn't be in touch with it. Should we be sensitive and treat women right. Yes, of course. But that's being a man, not being in touch with yourself.

      If you aren't in Oklahoma, or of you are still in your pajamas, you might not know how freaking cold it is here. But is is pretty freaking cold. It is blowing snow. The wind is blowing at like 20 mph. and it gets dark at 5:00pm now. Walking in a winter wasteland. No wonder here. I had to put some de-icer windshield washer fluid in my car earlier today, as I ran out last week. Perhaps that will come in handy in the morning. I am getting ready to wind down from the day. I'm going to make some sandwiches and watch some TV before I leave the office. Yes, I am spoiled. I have a TV in my office. It's not like I have cable or anything, but since we are about 2 miles away from all the TV stations I get all the local channels in really good. And I bought some sandwich material to make lunch here at the office, since I'm trying to get skinny again. I got some pepper turkey meat from the deli, and some pepperjack cheese. Then I grabbed some whole wheat bread and some jalepenos. If you know me well, you know I love spicy food. Seriously, I could kiss whoever created jalepeno cheese corn dogs. Sometimes I stop at gas stations just to get those. Unhealthy? Yes, they are the epitome. Delicious? Yes, they are the epitome. So anyway, I am going to chill and decompress, then go rent Bad Bad Boys II, which came out on DVD today. What ya gonna do?

      well, here I am, at the mid-point of my afternoon. I'm working away, trying to sell some insurance and not go crazy. I had lunch with an old college friend today. Listen to me, old college friend, like I'm 50 or something. Jessica, I had a great time and we should get together again soon. Jessica and I had some pretty crazy times our freshman year at OU in the dorms. Come to think of it, I had some pretty crazy times with a lot of people in the dorms. That was fun! Anyway, it was nice to catch up, and hopefully we can hang out more often. It's weird what happens when you get out of school. Everything suddenly gets boring. You want different things for Christmas, you watch different TV shows, and you even actually cook sometimes. Oh, and you have no friends, and even if you did you'd be too busy to hang out with them.   Oh well, I guess we'll survive. It could always be worse. Anyway, back to work. I'm sure I'll post again in a little while. I just figured out I can blog via my Google toolbar. DUH!!

      Some of you may know that phrase from the movie Office Space. It was written by Mike Judge of Beavis and Butthead fame, and is one of the funniest and dead-on parodies of the modern corporate culture ever. Ever. I think if someone asked me that, it might warrant an ass-kicking. Anyway, I think I have a case of the moonday's. I didn't sleep very well last night, I have too much work to do, and I have a wisdom tooth coming in. It hurts, and I'm cranky. Regardless, it has been a crappy day. I'm ready to leave the office, go buy some groceries, and take a nap. Or just go to bed. I am also seriously tired of hearing about OU, USC, and the BCS. (see post from earlier for my talking points). It's over and it's done. OU has taken it's rightful place as the team everyone loves to hate. We've always been taken less than serious, and the KSU game is the only excuse we've given them this year. So, everyone get their licks in while you can, you jealous bastards. After Michigan beats USC, and LSU limps back home after a pack of pissed off Sooners get done with them, all the sportswriters and armchair "experts" can shut the hell up and look in awe at the mighty, National Champion Sooners. Oh, and cower in fear of the 2004 season. Because we have 19 starters returning. And plenty of new talent that's been recruited. Scary, huh? BOOMER! SOONER!

      So one of my clients, and friends, was involved in a non-serious, non-injury accident (Or a 10-98 MVA, EMS speak) last week. Some guy merged into their lane and messed up the front of their car. The guy has Geico, and they call and file a claim. They have a police report and the whole shebang. So Geico tells them to go get an estimate at their "preferred" (read...cheap) auto body restorer. I also had them go to at least two other places. So I check out the damage, and it needs a new bumper and some paint, nothing too bad, $1500 or so. So they call Geico back today to discuss the damages, and are told that a check has already been mailed. What the fu**? So I am having them fax everything they have over, and I'm going to call Geico and crawl up some adjusters ass. My Sooners lost this weekend, I'm tired, and I have a wisdom tooth coming in, so I am in pain as well. Not a good day to screw with me or my clients. I'll post when I get done with them.

      I could go on and on about the horrible, humiliating defeat my university suffered Saturday at the hands of KSU. But I won't. I'll get too pissed off again. So here's a few points.  1) We are still 12-1. The top two other teams are 12-1(LSU), and 11-1(USC). Just because we lost a hard game at the end of the season rather than an easy game at the beginning of the season doesn't mean that the other teams are better than we are.  2) We are still ranked # 1 in the BCS rankings, which last time I checked, still determined who was the national champion. So I don't care what other polls say. If the press and the coaches were that smart, they'd be coaching a nationally ranked team.  3) Co-National Champions? A tie in football? Come on, this isn't some pussy game like soccer. There are no ties in football.  4) This whole mess will be settled when Michigan beats USC and Oklahoma beats LSU. Then we will be the undisputed national champions.  5) For everyone who has been calling OU one of the best teams in college football history, and are now saying we shouldn't be # 1? Eat yourself.  6) We didn't simply beat other teams all year, we dominated every team all year. We put 50+ points on 7 different teams this year. Easy, no. We had one bad game, just like every other team in the nation. One thing needs to be taken into account here. On any given day, any team can beat any other team. Even the Yankees lose sometimes.   Basically, that's all I'll say. Don't ask me about the game, and sure as hell don't try to argue any points with me. If you have a differing opinion, go get your own website. I'm way too biased to have a decent discussion on this topic, so don't even try. I'm as disgusted with OU as anyone, but if I was so cool and smart, I'd be playing for the team rather than watching them, so they have my respect for that.

      Well, my field trip for the lunch went really well. My brother was able to help my colleagues out on their new business venture, and I got a free lunch out of the deal. Nothing wrong with that for a change. Other than that, my afternoon is progressing nicely. I just have to do a ton of paperwork, then head off for the Chrstmas party later.

      A country song called "What was I thinking?". Seriously folks, I think I have a new theme song. Here's a few words from the song: "I know what I was feeling, but what was I thinking? I was thinking about a little white tank top sitting right there in the middle by me. I was thinking bout a long kiss, man just got get going where the night might lead. I know what I was feeling, but what was I thinking?" I go through that at least once a week. Sitting in the CD changer in my car. Frank Sinatra's Greatest Hits. Yes ladies, I do know how to get down.... Thank for letting me borrow it Ashley.

      I'm in the office, for now. Soon I will be on my way to Sulphur, OK. I have a lunch meeting there. Then I have to meet with some people as soon as I get back from Sulphur. Then I need to get back to my office so I can get some work done. Oh, and I have to be at a Christmas party at 7pm. As you can see, this is going to be a doosy. Anyway, if anyone should need me today, please call my cell phone, I will be answering it all day. If you don't have that number, call my office at 848.4991 and they can forward you to me. Or you can page me over at my baby's mommas house, she'll call my cousin Leroy, who will page me at my other pager. My other cousin Tyrone will get that page and then call me at my real number.... Sorry, I keep forgetting I'm not from Compton... Anyway, the moral of this blog is that I'll be out of the office until about 4 this afternoon. So I won't be posting. Until then. OK?

Anyway, if you don't know me very well, you can shoot over there and check it out. May God be with you. I am very ready for dinner tonight. I did not have time to eat either breakfast or lunch today, as I was occupado this morning and afternoon. My friend Ashley is going to fix chili tonight, and I'm eating with her and her husband.

      I would be remiss as a First Responder (part-time job on weekends) if I did not remind everyone to  go get their flu shots!  There is a possibility that the flu will reach pandemic levels this winter, and we have already had several deaths in Oklahoma. And don't think you are too strong and healthy, one of the deaths was a 28 year-old women near Tulsa. So go get it if you haven't, and bug your parents and friends to do it too. If everyone gets vaccinated, it's harder to get it since less people will have it!. Common sense! Think about that.

      Good question. Right now I am listening to the new album by John Mayer, "Heavier Things". What's that? Someone as manly and emotionally distant as you James, listening to John Mayer? Why yes. I have a few reasons. For one, we had him at a fraternity party a few years ago, before he signed with Sony. I've been following his career ever since. I have the acoustic version of everyone one of his songs downloaded off the internet. I seriously have about 112 John Mayer songs on my iMac at home. I know, maybe a little overkill, but he is really a prolific singer/songwriter. My parents had Crosby, Stills and Nash, and Elton John, and even James Taylor. I have John Mayer and Jack Johnson. If you've never heard of John Mayer, go buy "Room for Squares". If you've never heard of Jack Johnson, go buy "Brushfire Fairytales". Jack Johnson is a surfer and a documentary film maker (mostly about surfing) but also happens to write and sing some really great Jimmy Buffett reminiscent music. Definitely a must have.   I think I like John Mayer so much because he understands women so well. Even before you hear "Your Body Is a Wonderland", you can tell he really has them figured out. I admire that because I've taken figuring people out as a career (sales) and I cannot come close to understanding women. I completely get their rationale, and I know how they make decisions, but the  WHY?  completely boggles me. I think John has the why? figured out. So I try to learn what he knows through his music. Also, he really is a lyrical genius. Anyone that knows me well, knows I thrive off of the music I listen to. And I've always been fascinated by lyrics and how they are intertwined with music. That's why I listen to more rap and hip hop than any white kid ever should. And I have been since I was 11. I'll take a moment to comment on Jay-Z. His new album "The Black Album", is really great. It sucks that he's retiring, because he is one of 3 or 4 artists that I know when they release a CD it is good. Ludacris is another, as is John Mayer and 311. So go pay your last respects to one of the best lyricists and the king of rap, Jay-Z, and buy his album.

If it wasn't for her I would never have passed Mrs. Burnside's Algebra II class, again. She always helped me out. I've linked her website over on the right  (Shy*Grace)  , so go check it out. I have tremendous respect for her, and we need to do lunch too. I'll post more here in a little bit, or when the mood strikes me. I need to make a few calls real quick.

      I've been back in OKC since about noon, but I had to stop in Norman and see a client and then I had another appt here at the office that just ended. I went to my niece's Christmas Program this morning at their school. I am happy to report that my 4 year-old niece Emilee did an absolutely fantastic job, and my 8 year-old niece Katelyn nailed her solo perfectly. She was the first second-grader to sing, and she did a great job. Emilee was delighted last night to show me her trophy for winning dancer of the month. It is her very first trophy, and I think she may have slept with it in her bed last night. They're both terribly cute. They will certainly give my brother-in-law some trouble when they get older.

      I am disembarking for a road trip south to Sulphur, OK, home of the world famous smelling like ass spring waters. And no, they can't be hot springs, the springs are freezing cold year round. It's a nice enough of a town, but it is very small-town Oklahoma. Most of you should know what I'm talking about. Big pickups with "Ain't Skeered" stickers on the back, and plenty of Oklahoma's bastard child university (OSU) stickers everywhere. To be completely honest, I am a die hard OU fan (after giving them a bunch of money for tuition, you would be too!) but most of the OSU graduates I've met (including two of my partners) are very nice and intelligent people. Not smart enough to go to OU, but still pretty quick. Oh well, it could be Arkansas! Regardless, tomorrow morning I am attending the Christmas programs of both my nieces, Katelyn who is 8, and Emilee, who is 4. Emilee was named dancer of the month at her dance studio, and Katelyn is singing the big solo. So of course Uncle James is going to go watch. I will not be in the office tomorrow until noon, but maybe only working a half-day will be good for me. Besides, what could go wrong in half of a day? (dum dum da) I know, I know. I just jinxed it. Regardless, I'll talk to you crackers tomorrow.

       In an attempt to be serious, here is a news story:    Apparently some small children on a farm in Calaveras County, home to the fantastic Mark Twain story "The Jumping Frog of Calaveras County" actually found a specimen of the red-legged frog that was last spotted 34 years ago. See the story here:  Jumping Frogs of Calaveras County      And if you haven't read the book yet, I would strongly recommend it. Twain is a great writer.

      My insurance agency isn't a damn Wal-Mart. You can't buy the big screen for the game and then take it back becuse you can't afford it. This isn't a wholesale operation....   *** Edit to the post***  I had one of my CSR's call over to the girl's auto finance company, and lo and behold, this was the first they heard of it. Anyway, now she's going to have to come up with more insurance or go give her car back. Good luck.

      I wasn't going to tempt fate and say things couldn't get worse, but they kinda have. In addition to the crappy underwriter, I have also had two policy cancellations. Normally, those don't bother me, but one of them today did. It was a young girl I had helped get insurance at the last minute so she could buy a new car. I stayed late, sent over an evidence of insurance, on a Friday, and then the following week went over to  her   workplace  to get a signature and a check for downpayment. Now, not quite one month later, she decides to take her car back, and calls to cancel the insurance. So I fax over a cancellation form, and she signs it and calls me back. Now she wants to know how long it's going to take to get her money back from the insurance company, and wanted to know why I cancelled it today instead of retroactive to the policy start. Oh gee, I don't know? Maybe because I don't want to have to give back all of my commission because you ripped me off by taking out an insurance policy just to get a verification for 6 months and then cancelling a month later. I don't work for free. I'll be the hardest working insurance agent anyone ever had, but I don't come cheap. And certainly not free. Then she wants to know when I will notify her lienholder that her insurance was canceled. I told her I wasn't sure, but it'll happen today I'm sure. Tha way, if she really is just ripping me off, her lienholder will force her to either get new insurance or they will take the car back as she will be in violation of her finance contract. So take this is a lesson. Don't screw over hardworking individuals because you buy a car you can't afford the insurance on.

      So does anyone know how hard it is to meet women when all you do is work? I mean, do you really know? I do. It really sucks. I was in a 3 year, serious relationship until May of this year (day after my b-day, actually) and since then it has been very diffilcult to meet new and exciting women. Before my relationship, everything was fine. I lived in my fraternity house, went to a lot of functions, met a whole lot of great girls (thanks Delta Gamma) and generally partied my ass of with my most excellent brothers. Now, all I do is work. Not that there is anything wrong with that. I love owning my own business. It is incredibly satisfying. What I mean, is that it's hard to meet women while I'm in my office. Seriously, unless they walk into my office or car, I won't meet them. Maybe I just need to try to be more social, and start going out with my friends more. Although I don't necessarily want to date someone I meet in a bar. Maybe I'm hanging out at the wrong bar... I'll have to look into that. My biggest problem is that most of my friends that are my age are either still in school, or they work, but have serious girlfriends. I don't really have any other young professionals to hang out with, or "chase" girls with. After my break-up, I was hoping I would meet someone at the grocery store, or car wash, or Best Buy or someplace and sparks would just fly. But alas, that hasn't happened yet. I don't exactly have time for a serious relationship right now, but it would still be nice. I suppose I will just get through the holidays alone and try to start dating again before Valentine's Day. Don't cry for me Oklahoma... (cheesy line of the day)

      If you read my posts yesterday, you would know I was ranting about an underwriter at a major insurance company that was giving me grief. Well,I finally got a response from said underwriter on my last email. They are going to pass on this account. So, after making me jump through hoops for the last 3 months, they are going to decline the account.  Why, you ask? Because of the age of the church, and because I apparently don't have a handle on  all the updates on the church. I can barely keep my temper right now. It's not like I haven't had accounts declined before, but this is a church that really needs the coverage, and we have been patiently waiting on a quote for 3 months, and now they are going to decline the account. Well, no need getting too pissed off and freaking out. I will just have to find another company to write the policy. But one thing's for sure. I will not submit any account that I don't absolutely have to, to that company in the future. With me it's all about what's good for my clients, but if another company can handle their business, they will get it.

      After a very long and trying day, I am heading south to Norman for a meeting. Sometimes it seems even as if there were 30 or 40 hours in a day, I could find a way to fill them up with all of the stuff I need to get done. It really never ends. On the bright side, if I wasn't so busy I would be very poor indeed. So busy is good. I just wish we had more time to do stuff. Maybe tomorrow I can get some phone calls from people that actually want to buy insurance, not just talk about it all day.

      The stupidity and stubborness of some people really amazes me sometimes. I have been trying to place insurance on a inner city church for 3 months. It was one of my first accounts since I started my agency. Every week, the underwriter for a company that will remain nameless needs something else. First, pictures. Then they needed a bunch of supplemental apps and hard copy loss runs of the last 4 years. So, after much prodding by me, I finally got these from the church. Then, they needed a copy of the church's sexual misconduct policy. So, I had to help draft one. We finally get that submitted for approval from the insurance company, and they decline the account because the misconduct policy doesn't meet their standards!  GRRRRRR!  That pisses me off to no end. I sent back an email suggesting that they read the damn faxes I send to them and realize I was submitting a draft for their approval and not a final draft. Now, they'll probably stick with the declination and my pooch will be screwed because they were the only company I had to write this policy. And then a fine Baptist church will have to go uninsured. It's so frustrating.

      I figured out how to change my links. I actually had to go in and use HTML Code! I haven't had to mess with that stuff since my days as a product consultant at Intelek Technologies.   urlLink Intelek Technologies   I sold all of the products they are hawking on their website, and did quite well at it too. Alas, it is an incredibly dysfunctional company that was very hard to work at. I had 3 or 4 different bosses, and any of them could tell me to do something and I had to do it right then, regardless of what I was doing. Mind you, this was nice when different bosses had me doing different things and I got in trouble for not completing my projects. But, that is one of the many reasons why I later went into business for myself. I consider it a learning experience.

      Well, I did it again. Not knowing of the impending cold front, I left Sulphur this morning under sunshine and 45 degree weather. When I arrived in OKC, it was 29 degrees, damn windy, and just overall cold as shit.   On a good note, I will be moving back to Norman tomorrow. (Backstory by Cool James Puppet Theatre)  Landlord (Big Ugly): "James, your lease is up on November 15th, and I want you to sign a new lease with a raise in rent."  James: "No way. It clearly stipulates in our lease agreement that after the one year lease, a month by month lease occurs with no change in rent."  Big Ugly: "Ha ha! I only put that in there to get you to sign it. Now, where's my money"  James: "You'll get your fucking money when you change my air filter, paint the walls, and spray for ants."  Big Ugly: "Never! Why would I, a high-ranking landlord, do anything a peasant tenent such as yourself woudld ask?"  James: "It's called the Residential Landlord and Tenants Act you ignorant fucker. I'll tell you what, I'll be out by the 15th, and you give me back my deposit or I'll rip off your head and shit down your neck."  Big Ugly: "Ok"  So I have been homeless ever since. I wanted to move to NW OKC, close to my office, but after two months of searching nothing provided itself that was affordable, except for apartments. And I don't like apartments. And, as I was just starting my agency, I was very very poor. But still gained weight? Who knows.....  Anyway, now after 3 months of searching, I am moving into a way cool house in Norman with one of my fraternity pledge brothers and a friend of ours. 3 bedroom, 2 bath, 2 car garage, big ass TV, Playstation II's, and X-Boxes. It will be all that I could have hoped for and more. And, I'll have high-speed internet access at home again, so I can do fun things like post at home rather than doing it during the day at work. Oh, and I haven't had cable TV in 2 years, but suddenly I feel compelled to watch a lot of TV, so us having digital cable will be rad too. Rad? Oh crap. Slipping back into the 90's. Early 90's. Hey, is that my NKOTB shirt???

      Here are a couple of news stories from around our state. Apparently some engine trouble  urlLink forced a small plane to land   on the Turner Turnpike yesterday.   Tragically,  urlLink three Moore teens died yesterday  that were killed when their car veered off the road and slammed into a tree. It turns out that they were driving too fast and not wearing their seatbelts. I think that if people just knew the kind of forces your body has to endure during an auto accident they would slow down and put on their seatbelts. Perhaps some of their classmates can learn from this.   Judge Steven Taylor, of my hometown McAlester,   urlLink bars TV and newspaper cameras  from the courtroom during the stats trial of Terry Nichols, accused co-conspirator in the 1995 bombing of the Murrah Federal Building. The trial is taking place in Pittsburg county, in the county seat of McAlester, OK. Which is also my hometown, and the home of the Oklahoma State penitentiary, and the McAlester Army Ammunition Depot.

      So I should too. Here's the deal with the whole Presidential election thing.   I am a registered Republican. Do I love all that is Bush? No. His immigration policies scare the hell out of me. Although I supported the war in Iraq, I still believe it could have been handled differently. I do think Bush has done a good job, and on 9/11 I felt comfortable knowing that he was at the helm. I also like what he did after 9/11, which was a concerted effort to eliminate terrorist funding and training camps. Did he have to blow up half of Afghanistan? Probably not. Was it helpful that he did? Probably so.   I was raised Democrat. Matter of fact, most of my family are Democrats. Do I like Democrats? Yes. Do I support any of the Democratic nominees? Nooope.  I don't like the apparent undertone of the campaign. To me it seems like they are saying, "We don't care which one of us you vote for, just don't vote for Bush." Come on guys....  Now of the Democratic nominees I seem to like General Clark the best. I believe he holds a lead in Oklahoma, and I would prefer that if any of them are going to be the Commander in Chief, it will be him. Seems to have a level head on his shoulders.   Who am I going to vote for? Only time will tell. I suppose it depends on who the Democrats are bringing, and what W. does between now and then. But if I had to vote today? I would abstain. I'm not too impressed with anyone.

      The ones I'm guilty of are in  bold .  1. Your reason for not staying in touch with family is that they do not have e-mail addresses.   2. If you can't order it by midnight and have it delivered by noon the next day, it is just too slow.    3. Your stockbroker's name ends in ".com."    4. A blind date means chatting online with someone you haven't met before.    5. Keeping up with sports means having your favorite sports teams book marked.     6. You lecture the neighborhood kids selling lemonade on ways to improve their efficiency.    7. You get all excited when it's Saturday and you can wear sweats to work.    8. You find you really need PowerPoint to explain what kind of work you do.    9. You normally eat out of vending machines and at the most expensive restaurant in town within the same week.    10. You apologize to your friends who didn't get holiday cards from you; "Sorry, I only sent 'e-cards' this year, you just didn't make the cut."     11. You think a "half-day" means leaving at 5 o'clock.     12. You get most of your jokes via e-mail or on the Net instead of in person.

      But have you noticed, that in an office that has women in it (most do) that it is always hot?  My mother and sister are both cold-blooded. Every girl I've ever dated was cold-blooded.  What's the deal. The ladies in my office (I love you all) keep it hot in here. I know some of you will read this, please don't take offense. I find it charming how a woman can always be cold, and a man always hot.  Seriously, I keep a fan running in my office all day, every day. Because the heater in the office building is always on.  The funny thing is, all the women here have sweaters and small space heaters, yet they are still always cold. It's been like this in every office I've ever been in.   Does anyone know why?

      So I spent the weekend in the big town of Sulphur, OK, population 5,000 people, 20,000 dogs, and some billy goats. I usually do, because I am the assistant coach of my oldest nieces basketball team. 1st, 2nd, and 3rd grade girls. It's a blast, and we have practice on Thursday night, Friday night, and games on Saturday. We've had two games, and unfortunately lost them both. The first game we didn't really stand a chance, but the game this last weekend we did. Until I realized that rather than swatting at the ball and playing good defense, the other team had been instructed to grab for the ball and tie our girls up every time we got down the court. We didn't even get a shot off. And the retarded ass high school kids that ref these games weren't calling shit. So we had to have a word with the guy that organizes the games, and we have been assured it won't happen again. Better not. I'll get thrown out of a game before I see another one of our little girls get her nose busted. We had 3 busted noses, 2 busted lips, and one girl got knocked down 3 times. But to my team's credit, they only allowed 12 points, and never gave up. I'm proud of them.   So I'm driving back up to my office this morning, and I'm listening to the radio, and I hear talk of snow. Snow?   Somehow I forgot to watch the news ALL weekend, and didn't realize until I got up here that it is 28 degrees here and we are supposed to get 2 inches of snow today. It was 50 degrees when I left Sulphur this morning. At least I brought a jacket and some gloves.

      Boy, are things crazy around here. I've been in my office all morning working on quotes and explaining to people why they need insurance for their business. My only "breaks" have been running to the cofee pot, then the bathroom, and to the printer. I've singlehandedly cut down about 40 trees today with all the stuff I have been printing. I've noticed that insurance is a paper-heavy industry, but even with all the new internet rating and paperless systems the companies have been putting out, after I rate something on the internet I still have to print it out. It doesn't make any sense. I think I'm going to look into getting a Tablet PC so I can take notes on it rather than on pieces of paper. Save the rainforest. It still won't help me sleep better at night, but it can't hurt anything.  Oh, I almost forgot. I've been a big Apple computer fan since I got into advertising at OU, back in my college days. I love them. Not only for graphics and such, but just because they are so stable and the programs are set up so logically. Now, I'm not a Windows basher, I like it too. But I am one that can go back and forth from OS to OS without losing my bearings, and I'm pretty damn proficient at both. But, Apple always has better and more logical programs.   One such program is iTunes. All you Apple fans know what it is, but for those who don't let me explain. It is a music listening device that outdoes every media player I've ever seen. No, it doesn't show movies or pictures, but it is the best music player ever. It stores all of your music in one great library, playlists are easy as hell to make, and the controls are simple. And, it's very elegant looking. Oh, and the visualizer blows away anything I've ever seen.   With Apple's new push for legally downloadable music, they introduced the iTunes Music Store. This is good, songs for $.99, the RIAA not suing me, but they also released a Windows version of iTunes.   Long story short, if you listen to cd's or the radio at work, urlLink go download the program  . I've been listening to one of the many programmed radio stations all morning, and all it plays is top 80's hits. It's great!  Check it out, and if you can honestly say that winamp or WMP is any better, then you are a liar!

      So in a renewed effort to be the big swinging dick of the insurance world, I have decided to get to work earlier and go home later. So last night I stayed until 8pm. And I was here at 7:45am this morning.   I've decided that I will never be a rich asshole unless I get rich first. So, all of my pursuits from now on will have to answer a question. How does this profit me?  And by profit, I mean financially, emotionally, physically, or civically.   I don't get paid to coach, but I'll still do it because it is worth it. But when it comes to fast food, or relationships, or business deals or days off, I'm going to ask myself how it profits me. Because if it has a negative influence (fatness, laziness) I am not going to do it.   So watch out business world, here I come.

      I took a Physical Attractiveness Test on Match.com, and it tells you the type of person you are physically attracted to. Some of my facts:  I like beautiful women.  Blondes do it for me, but so do brunettes.  Straight hair is best.  I prefer slim and athletic builds with large breasts.  I am drawn to women with "movie star" looks, but am often disappointed because they are hard to find. I'm also a "natural" casting agent.  I am very, very picky. Only 1% of males in the U.S. have the same criteria for beauty as I do.  I am less likely to settle for someone I do not find attractive.   The conclusion: I am a guy, I like beautiful women with movie star looks. Big surprise! Every guy does. But unlike other guys, I am very specific with what I really like.   Just to let all my lady readers know, I am not incredibly picky, but if I do not find someone attractive I simply don't, and probably never will. And I like ponytails.   And with my history of dating exorbitantly rich girls, I apparently like sorority girls. I really do too. And the Chi Omegas I've dated at OU were snobby. (Just a dig at my ex...)

      I wouldn't be a master marketer or a decent agent if I did not remind everyone that I am an insurance agent, and I am licensed in Oklahoma and Texas, and I do write auto and home insurance, as well as commercial and life and health.   Remember kids, your insurance agent doesn't have to be old and gray-haired. Some of us (really only me) are young and vibrant. And what I lack in experience (and hundreds of thousands of dollars) I make up for in exuberance and persistance. And customer service.

      I've got a bone to pick. I was driving to my sister's house in Sulphur last night to eat some fine home cooking. I had a pretty decent day at the office, bought a new cd, and was in a generally good mood. Until at some point south of Norman on I-35, a blinding light filled my rear-view mirror.   Surely, I thought, someone has accidentally put their high beams on, and isn't meaning to fill the cockpit of my car with eye blinking brightness. I figured after a couple of minutes, someone would flash their lights at him, and he would return his high-beams to low, and all would be cheery again.   I was sadly mistaken.   As the truck got closer, and the light even more blinding, I could see that it wasn't someone with their high beams on, it was some redneck bastard in his jacked-up pickup truck.   I'm from Oklahoma, I used to own a 4X4 (Jeep), and I like trucks. But I don't like these jacked-up monstrousities that have their headlights lined even with my rear-view mirror. I couldn't see. So I sped up, thinking if I got further down the road the light would be less. But the asshole sped up to, keeping behind me. Now, if I was a toothless redneck, I might have nothing better to do than drive behind someone minding their own business, looking at the reflection of my lights in their mirrors. But I was starting to get pissed. And only because this stereotypical redneck fucker was doing this on purpose. So I slowed down, and let him pass me. Of course it was as I expected, and when he passed me I was met with the blaring noise of a diesel motor that was being piped through some home-made creation of an exhaust pipe. You know, those huge ass pipes you can buy at AutoZone and bolt on yourself. Only this one appeared to have some holes drilled in it, making it even louder.   After my hearing returned, he changed lanes back into mine, on the right. Which is proper highway etiquette. Then I was met with perhaps the worst thing ever. Worse than the A-Bomb, worse than KFC fucking up my order, worse than an MVA victim with massive head injuries and a respiration rate of 5. The dreaded shiny chrome rear bumper!   Why in the fuck would you want a bumper you can see yourself in? And of course, IT'S AT THE SAME LEVEL AS MY HEADLIGHTS! So now I am being blinded by my own headlights.   I could feel the anger building up in me. I was pretty sure I was about to black out, only to regain consciousness in a pile of redneck blood with no memory of what happened. So, being the insurance agent, medic, and young professional that I am, I took the next exit and sat there for a good 10 minutes, calming down.  I'm better now. But mark my words. Billy Bob, if I have to deal with your shit again, it's going to be real bad for you. Real bad. I'll make you take a shower, go to a dentist, and I'll take you to (gasp) Express for Men and make you wear clothes that don't rhyme with Strangler. Watch your back.

      Since I am still a blogging neophyte, I am not sure how the whole community works. But I do know one thing. Heather, from What's Your Damage.com, added me to her links list.   ---- Shock setting in ----  I don't know how she knew that I linked her, I don't know if she likes my blog, or if linking me is just her being polite. It doesn't matter. I am just thrilled to be noticed by someone who has one of the best blogs I've read.

      I got some new music for ya'll. I bought the new Maroon 5 cd earlier, because I had previewed the CD on iTunes Music Store, and it is really good. I could be because I am incredibly thirsty for new music, but I am very pleased with my purchase. Of course almost everyone has heard the song "Harder To Breathe", but the songs "This Love" and "The Sun" are sure to be hits. I'll probably be wrong. Regardless, this CD has earned a semi-permanent spot in my CD changer for at least two or three weeks.

      What's going to be Super about the Super Bowl. Nothing really. I lke the Patriots, and I hope they win. Tom Brady seems to be a good kid, and I think he deserves his shot. But the freakin Panthers? WTF? I'm not a big fan at all. If I had my druthers, it would be Packers Vs. Colts. That's a match-up that would have been worthy of a viewing.

      I'm not really a "PC" politically correct kind of guy, but take a minute out of your day to read something about Martin Luther King Jr. No matter what you think you know about him, there is always more to him. Even if you are not open-minded, there is a lot to be gained from what MLK Jr. had to say.

      Oh, wait one minute. It is Friday! Yay! I'm looking forward to a busy weekend. First, I have basketball practice for the 3rd and 4th grade girls team I am co-coaching tonight at 7pm. And then tomorrow we have a game at 2pm. And my nephew has a game at 1pm. And my parents are coming to watch both. So, as you can tell, I am going to have one great weekend. Actually, it won't be that bad. But Sunday I am doing nothing but sleeping in and packing.   Right now I am importing some songs into my iTunes. Just in case no one knows yet, there is a windoze version of iTunes, which is an Apple native program. It is the best music program ever. Windows Media Player and WinAmp can't hold a candle. You can play any cd or song on your computer through it, import from cd's onto your computer, burn out of it, and there is an Apple Store where you can buy and download $.99 songs. Which are yours to keep. You can even share them with other computers or put them on your iPod, if you have one. Go check it out. You can see it and download it at apple.com. You'll thank me later.   Other than that, I am in the office working on quotes and trying to get wrapped up for the weekend. I'll post again later.

      Ok, there is something I need to get off of my chest. There are certain girls that I find incredibly attractive. This doesn't have anything to do with their personality, profession, intelligence, or money. Here's the list:  Britney Spears - I hate her music, but she is so freaking hot. And not just hot like some girl on the beach in Mexico, but hot in a Brazilian-someone you would cut your arm off for- someone I would not hesitate to spend thousands of dollars on just to hang out with. Again, not a big fan of the music, but I think she is smoking.   Paris Hilton - Ok, I understand that she is not all there. Not incredibly bright. Sometimes harsh, and a big-ass spoiled brat. I don't care. Her beauty ranks up there with Britney. That is her only redeeming quality. The sex movie, who cares? Who among has never taken a picture or made a short film, or thought seriously about it? I have. Nuff said.  The waitress from Bison Witches last night: Don't know her name, origin, status, age, eye color, or what she drives. Don't care. She was hot. Not Paris or Britney hot, but those are pretty high standards. She was almost as tall as me, maybe 6 foot even. Dark hair, dark eyes, dark skin. She was white, but very tan. She had a well-developed midriff, and a hot ass tatoo on her lower back. I love those. She served my beers with a smile, and may have flirted with me. The people at my table thought so. I'm pretty sure I'm going to go back and ask her out. She was really attractive. I'll hold my breath...                (face turning blue)              There are many others. I think my problem is, and always will be, that I am in love. Not with a certain woman, but with all women. Well, most women. I love women. Just the thought of them and I can zone out for hours. And heaven forbid I get to interact with them. Luckily for me, something takes over. I'm pretty sure it is my "sales zone". This happens when I am selling something, or trying to impress someone. My mouth moves of it's own accord, the words spill out without permission. My facial gestures change, I exude confidence. When I am done, I remember doing it, but not how. That is how I've been a successful salesperson for the last 8 years. Since I was 15. I have a zone. And boy, when the zone fails, it looks bad. But 98% of the time the zone is perfect. Like Ludacris, I spit game that would make my boy Hef proud. But luckily for me, the zone also comes out when I am talking to women. And alcohol helps it. Yea, I know. Awesome. So the next time I am hitting on you, and you find yourself mesmerized by the flow of words and the casual yet incredibly focused body language, just know the Zone has you. Don't try to fight it. Resistance is futile. Oops, showed some of my Trek background!

      So I'm listening to Radio VH1, just chillin, listening to the "Dope" station. No potheads, it means dope as in cool and fresh. And that damn song "The Way You Move" comes on. So I freak out. And then I skip to the next song. And guess what comes on? "Hey Ya". I think if VH1 new the limits I was being pushed to, they wouldn't fuck with me.

I'm just trying to put some organization in, and the whole HTML thing is still a struggle for me. But I'm getting the hang of it! So, sit back and enjoy!

      This is my final plea to all radio stations and musica channels on earth. Please, please, please, stop playing "Hey Ya" and "The Way You Move" by OutKast. I love OutKast. I think they are great. But seriously, and I'm sure everyone will agree with me, you are playing those fucking songs too fucking much! Way too fucking much! See, now you got me cussing! Why????? Why would you play the same two songs over and over? Even on my iTunes radio, on the damn rap stations! I can't escape. They're out to get me...... I'm going crazy! OutKast is taking over the world government. We'll be forced to listen to those two songs all the time!  Seriously, I know for a fact that OutKast has more songs. Did they not just release a two disc set? Shouldn't that be like 40 songs? Just pick two more. I don't care which two. Just pick some different songs!  I hate that. Every now and then, someone will come out with a great song, and radio and tv just play it into the ground. If I was an artist, I would be pissed. I would never want someone so fed up with hearing one of my songs that he would take 15 minutes out of his day to tell the internet how much he hated it now. Never. I would want my song to be requested by callers, and I would want people tuning in at a certain time to hear my song. I wouldn't want my song to be the village bicycle of music. More like a Picasso. Rare. Something people would stand in line to hear.   While I'm on in, how many more damn albums if Tupac going to release? I should only wish I am that productive after I die. I don't know for sure, but I don't think that he could have recorded enough music in his all too short lifetime to fill up 30 something albums all released posthumously. I love Tupac. I have most of his albums. Except for all the ones he "released" after he died. I refuse to put money into the pockets of those that are taking all of these Tupac clips, mixing them into their own songs, and then selling them in Tupac compilation albums. I hate that. Make your own damn music. And for the most part, these are artists that aren't very successful, so you can see what they are trying to do. Pisses me off. Sumbitches.

       Maybe it's just me, but it seems as though it has been foggy as hell for the past two mornings. Yesterday wasn't so bad, but this morning I must have only had 20 or 30 feet of visibility. Granted, this was way south of OKC, but still. At least it made my drive seem faster. I didn't know where I was on the highway until I came across a town. I couldn't see the land on either side of the road, so I had no landmarks to go by.   Oh, and I also found a place to live. To those who don't know, I have been homeless since December, as my lease ran out and I couldn't find another place I like. I will be moving back to Norman with some fraternity brothers. They have a 3 bed, 2 bath, 2 car garage house on the east side of town. It's really new, like 3 years old, and it's in a nice family neighborhood. I pay a little more for rent, and I get the big master bedroom that has 2 walk-in closets and a big ass bathroom, with two sinks. Not that I need two sinks, but it's still cool. Oh, and we have high-speed internet and digital cable. So now I can work at home when I need to, and maybe I'll even start watching tv again. Doubtful, but maybe.

      Here are a couple of small irritations I observed on the highway this morning, and over the weekend.   Just because your car has the word "sport" written on it does not mean that it is a sporty car. Example, the idiot in the red Ford Escort ZX2 Sport this morning that tried to race me on the highway and block me into the middle lane. Dude, it's a friggin Ford Escort! I don't care what it has written on it, if it has a 4 cylinder it is not fast. But I did enjoy the look on his face when I blew his doors off in my "regular" Mustang. I also dislike the rice burners, you know, the Honda Civics and Toyota's and Subaru's that these kids spend $10K on to add nitrous, tons of extra body parts, and neon windshield washer sprayers too. If you have to use nitrous to outrun a Mustang, Camaro, Corvette, Porsche, BMW, or even an old school Monte Carlo, your car isn't fast. Save your money and just go buy a Mustang GT. Or do like I did, buy a 6-cylinder Mustang, put a few things under the hood, and don't talk about it. Then when people in Z-28's want to show you up, they look surprised when they can't. It's fun.  I also hate it when people try to race me. Granted, when I was younger and I had my Camaro and Avenger, I raced all the time. But we're talking about high school here. Now, I am an insurance agent and a medic. Do you really think I am into racing? That's why I'm a medic. I get to legally drive fast. With lights and sirens. To borrow a line from the new Ben Stiller movie "Along Came Polly", I assess risk for a living, so I try to be as safe as possible. I still have a lot of fun, I just don't take the chances I used to. So I hate it when someone in some "sports" car pulls up next to me at a stoplight, "races" me when the light turns green, then acts like they pulled something off when they beat me, because all I did was accelerate normally. What the f*ck? Why would I waste gas on that guy? It's really irritating when an older guy in a BMW or a Porsche wants to race you. Can anyone say small penis?

      My favorites are in  bold .   If a man is standing in the middle of the forest speaking and there is no woman around to hear him, is he still wrong?   If a deaf person swears, does his mother wash his hands with soap?   Is there another word for synonym?   Where do forest rangers go to get away from it all?  Why isn't there mouse-flavored cat food?  What do you do when you see an endangered animal eating an endangered plant?  Would a fly without wings be called a walk?  Why do they lock gas station bathrooms? Are they afraid someone will clean them?  If a stealth bomber crashes in a forest, will it make a sound?  If a turtle doesn't have a shell, is he homeless or naked?  Can vegetarians eat animal crackers?   Why do they put Braille on the drive-through bank machines?   How do they get the deer to cross at that yellow road sign?   Why do they sterilize the needles for lethal injections?    Why did kamikaze pilots wear helmets?

      Well, I had a home-cooked meal at my sister's house last night, and got some rest, so I am in a much better mood today. And I have some business to write today, so that always make me happier. Oh, by the way. My wonderful neice is selling Girl Scout cookies, so if any of my friends in the OKC area want some, let me know. They are $3 a box. Email or call me. Other than that, nothing new is really going on. Let me surf the web for a min and I'll pst something minorly amusing.

      Have you ever had one of those days where everything seems to be going right, but that's just because nothing has gone wrong yet? I'm havig one of thoise weird days were I woke up in a good mood, which lasted most of the morning, and was then ruined by one comment. I'm in the mood today where I was feeling ok, but it was fragile. It's very unlike me to let anything, really, bring me down. But today, all it took was one thing and now I am pissed off to the point I'm ready to leave. I have too much work to do to do this, but it sure would be nice. Regardless, perhaps I will find myself in a better mood later. I certainly hope so.

      I have a couple of points to make about Sooner football, and then I'm done on the topic until next August. The USC Trojans are a bunch of bitches. They do not deserve to share the national title with anyone, not even LSU. They played one less game than us and LSU, and had a weaker schedule. That is why they were not in the Sugar Bowl, and why they do not deserve a share of the title. OU was one of the most dominant teams of all time this year. We beat several top ten teams, and put over 50 points on 7 teams. We were being talked about by all the analysts as maybe one of the best college football teams ever. And in similarily fantastic nature, we self-destructed. I had hoped the Big 12 championship was a fluke. Maybe we just had a bad game. Jason White got knocked around a little, and just wasn't feeling it. Then he won the Heisman, several of our players won national awards, and I figured we would go into the Sugar Bowl with something to prove. Maybe with a chip on our shoulder. The same people that were lauding us as the greatest ever were suddenly saying we shouldn't even be playing post-season. I thought that would fire our guys up. It fired me up.   Here's the deal. I am not a football player. I've played a bit, I love to play now, but I never played at the college level. I can't judge these guys too much because if I was such a badass I would be on the team helping out. But here's what I did see. Our defense got shredded. The Tigers were running and passing the ball at will, and almost ran the opening kick-off back for 6. The only reason why it was not 21-0 in the first quarter is because of Derrick Strait. He made every big play, almost single-handedly. He didn't put any points on our board, but he kept 21 off of theirs. He gets my "Player of The Game" award.   Our offense looked horrible. Granted, LSU was blitzing almost every play. Jason White is not mobile, and our O-Line was having a hard time keeping Jason on his feet. He ended up on his ass more times last night that he did all year. And he threw at least 2 interceptions. I stopped counting after that. He got hurried, lost his composure, and couldn't get the ball off. It didn't help any that our receivers couldn't get seperation from the corners to give Jason someone to throw to.   If......... If I was a coach or had any power over OU football, I would have benched Jason White's ass in the second quarter. I would have told him "Go sit on the fucking bench and think about how to throw the damn ball like you did all year. Have a nice off-season, we'll see you in the summer if you still have a fucking job." And then I would have put Paul Thompson in. He is a very fast, very mobile quarterback that also has an arm. I know, I know. Dance with the one that brought ya. Maybe the HEISMAN winner can get his shit together and lead our team to a National Championship. Bullshit. Yank him from the game, put someone in who can dance around the blitzers, and break for yardage when our receivers were covered. It is my sincere belief this is what made us lose the game. Jason White had an injured wrist, turf toe, and he is slow. Put a healthy Paul Thompson in and let him run with the ball. Make the Tigers fucking respect our running game so our receivers can get seperation. And don't throw for the endzone every 3rd play.  That is all I will say about it to anyone. I am not talking about the game to anyone. I do not want to think about OU football for at least 3 months.   Oh, and congratulations LSU. You deserve the National Championship because we couldn't pull our shit together. And you deserve to have it to yourself. Let USC rot in hell.

      I never do this because I know it is useless, but in a renewed effort to better myself, I will have some resolutions this year. And I may even try to keep some of them.   - I will work harder and work more.    - I will be nicer to my friend Ashley, but she is really fun to fuck with.    - I am definitely losing my "girlfriend" fat. Although I am sure a lot of it is "Work" fat, and "lazy" fat.    - I'm going to be more of a hardass this year. I think I will be Super-James no matter what I am doing, whether it is taking out the trash or driving, or sleeping.     That's about it. There isn't much more that I am resolving to do, other than close my Big Fish account.

      What a week. This has been a rather busy and eventful last week or so, but I'll skip the mundane too busy to eat lunch details and hit the high points.   Last Thursday: Last Thursday was my last day as an independent insurance agent. That's right folks, the young professional has taken a new job. As of tomorrow morning, I will be the new Program Coordinator at Bricker Professional Education. I will be implementing Heart Safe Environments in businesses in a 5 state area. But, more of that to come tomorrow after my first day.  Friday: Took the day off and put new brake pads and a rotor on my car. Yes, the white collar worker that write this dribble knows his way around a car. Inside and out. Autos are one of my passions. Then I went to Sulphur for basketball practice.   Saturday: We had a basketball game at 10am, and I worked the concession stand and the gate for the hour before. We won our basketball game, and my nephew won his basketball game too, even with me reffing. Yes, I braved the badlands of angry parents and coaches and pitched in and reffereed a basketball game. Boys 5th and 6th grade. It was actually a whole lot of fun. I haven't reffed a game in a long time, but I think I did a very fair and good job. I certainly had to call all of the fouls, since the other ref was too scared to call anything. But, I wasn't yelled at or beat up, and my nephew's team won, so it all went well. We have a end of season tournament next weekend, and if we (the team I coach) win our first game, we get a second round bye and go straight into the championship game. Which is why I'm glad that we are seeded 3rd.   Today: Today I did my substantial pile of laundry, then came back to Norman and hung it up while organizing my week. This is a pretty big week for me. I start my new job and a very aggressive workout program. My plan is to slim back down to my college freshman year 185, then bulk that back up to about 200 or so. Which means I will weigh the same as I do now, only it will be hard and lean muscle rather than this Michelin I'm carrying around my waist now.   That's it. Nothing too terribly exciting, but some pretty big deals for me. I'll post tomorrow and fill you in on the events of my new job.

      Now, before you get all up in arms, rest assured that I am not going after fat kids here. Ok? Got it? But this aimed at obese kids. See, I was really skinny until about the third grade. Then I got chunky. Then I started playing sports and got all skinny. Then I briefly got fat again, then got skinny and stayed that way until rather recently. So I know what it's like to be teased about being overweight. And unfortunately, I know what it's like to tease someone about their weight. Kids are mean as hell. So in my home state  urlLink  a bill has been passed   that eliminates soft drinks and cady vending machines in elementary schools. That brings me to a rambling.  Not too long ago during high school football season, (October) I was watching my 12 year-old nephew play football and noticed a very fat native american kid a few rows below me in the bleachers. And when I say very fat, I mean the kid was maybe 4 or 5 and must have weighed 130, 140 pounds. Basically only a sack of feed lighter than I am. And I could not bring myself to believe that his parents thought that was normal, or healthy.   And then I started paying better attention. And I noticed a whole lot of fat kids. A whole lot. Enough that I was amazed I had not seen the difference before.   I suppose most people don't realize that being fat has become the norm. Now, I've gained a lot of weight before I even noticed it. Especially when I was still in a relationship, and even now that I push papers all the time. But, I have realized it and am now correcting it. Little kids don't have that option. When I was little, I played sports. All the way up until I graduated high school, I played sports. Even at OU, I played intramural sports for my dorm and my fraternity. Sadly, it's pretty hard to find time for working out now, so I'm having to make time.   My point is that little kids can't just create time to lose weight, nor would they know how. Most overweight kids are from overweight families. That's another thing I've noticed. Obese or morbidly obese parents almost always have fat kids. It's as big a part of their family as watching movies or saturday morning cartoons. I'm a fan of the new bill, and I think kids should only have healthy food at school, but, it seems to me that changing the way their parents and people around them view food and their relationship with it would be a much greater help. Or a combination of the two.   What do you guys (and girls) think can be done about overweight kids? Please leave your thoughts in the comments section.

      So last night after I ventured home, I found myself being pulled to Bison Witches in Norman to watch the OU basketball game (good game) with some friends. All I ended up watching was the waitress. This is the same waitress I fell in love with weeks ago. Tall, long hair, brunette, smiles a lot, wears ponytails (I love that), and has a strategically placed tatoo on her lower back. She's so hot. I want to talk to her, but she may end up not being a nice person and that would shatter my image of her. But I figure in 10 pounds or so I'll approach her. If there is only one thing harder than approaching a woman in a bar, it's approaching a woman that works at the bar while you are in it. These poor girls are approached every day by countless guys. So it will take careful planning and precise implementation. Very precise.   On another note, I am taking a family friend on a tour of OU and Norman tomorrow. She's graduating high school in May and will be attending this fall semester. So I figured rather than let her take an "OU" tour, I would show her all the buldinhs she really needs to know and show her the shortcuts through campus that are designed ot take an extra 5 minutes off of a cross-campus hike, which we all know every freshman gets themselves into at least one situation where they have to be across OU in 10 minutes. Dale Hall to Sarkey's anyone? Doesn't look too far on the map!

      I left the office last night with only one thing in mind. Go home, clean out closet, eat dinner, and watch tv. Did that happen? Nope. I went home and sat down on my bed, noticing a small bug crawling towards me. I bent over to pick it up, and it bit me! It was a damn shuffleboard bug! So 30 minutes later I'm at O'Connells playing shuffleboard with 3 of my friends. I don't know what got into me. I certainly wasn't playing very good. Not too bad, but I gave up some pretty crucial points. Turns out I play better one on one, rather than playing teams. And the fact that the girl sitting in the booth directly behind and below me had on hip-huggers didn't help. Surely she knew that we could see her whole ass crack? I couldn't stop laughing. And, there were like 8 cops eating dinner there. I know what those cops were thinking. Let's go down to the bar and eat and see how many people actually leave before we do. They must have gotten their kicks, because I can guarantee no one left that bar until at least 10 minutes after those cops did. You could feel the tension. I actually think that's what was throwing my game off.    Other than making excuses for my poor play, that was how my night went. By the time we got home, I just showered and watched the Cosby Show on Nick@Night. Gotta love that Rudy.

      So my new roommates have introduced me to the wonderful world of table shuffleboard. There is a board at O'Connells, which is a popular bar very near OU. I've got to say it. Last night was only my second time to play it, but I'm pretty damn good. Now, I still make rookie mistakes. I go for the points when I should be trying to knock the other weights off of the table. But I do that in every sport. I have to win. At everything I do. Fortunately, I seem to have a knack for just about every sport I've ever tried. Now, am I going to play professionally anywhere? No. But I've always been very athletic, except for right now when I am still athletic, but I absolutely don't look like it. Basketball? Played it every year of my life since 3rd grade until a career ending knee injury in high school. Baseball, same thing, only I played it even after my knee gave out. Football, only played one year of it, but I can still throw a tight spiral and can throw as far as anyone I know. And accurately too. Tennis? I have tennis rackets, and although I'm not very fast, I have a killer backhand. Bowling? You got me there, I suck at bowling. Pool? Yes, I am good at pool. Golf? I'm not the best player I know, but I'm not the worst either. And now I can add table shuffleboard to my repertoire. Anyone want to play me?  On another and slightly less cocky note, has anyone noticed how hard it is to talk to women at bars. I know what you are thinking, bars aren't where you should meet women. But I don't hang out at bars trying to meet women. I go out with my friends, have a few beers, watch some sports. But in my experiences from watching men try to pick up on women, they all come off looking like damn idiots. Seriously, if desperation was a cologne, you could buy it free in bars. And anytime I try to talk to a girl at a bar, I'm afraid I'm coming off like a jackass because here I am the stereotypical guy hitting on a girl in a bar. Granted, my charm skills aren't quite what they were before I started my last relationship (over three years ago), but they aren't that bad. I think. I know confidence isn't it. I'm a very confident guy. Ask anyone that knows me. I know what I want, and ususally how to get it. I could use a haircut, but I don't think that's it. I really could use (and currently am losing) about 15 pounds, but I see hot girls with fat guys all the time. Maybe I am handicapping myself to avoid a repeat of wasting three years and thousands of dollars on someone who throws your emotions around like confetti. But I'm not really afraid of that either. I know better than to get into a serious relationship right now. I'm not sure what it is. Maybe I am just now putting myself into social positions that are accesible by girls. Who knows. I'm the type of person that thinks everything takes some working at, but when it comes to love and relationships, I'm not sure you can work at that. In my past it has always sorta happened. I think if I try at it, I will start trying to hard, and I'll end up in bars hitting on women looking like a damn fool. I think I'll give it some more thought and wait and see what happens.  That brings me to another topic. The impending money pit of a holiday that is Valentine's Day. I can safely say that this will be the first Valentine's Day I have spent alone since I started dating (I think I was 15). And to tell you the truth, I don't see a big problem with that. I think everyone should have at least one sad V-Day, because it makes you appreciate the good ones all the more. And I've had some really good ones. Really good. There are three I would like to forget, but they were among the best, so it's hard to do that. I'm not going to boycott V-Day, nor will I tell my friends how it's a vapid holiday with no real value, because I don't believe that. This year I am just going to hang out, not try too hard, and see what happens. Who knows, between now and then I might have a hot date. But if not, I'll just go rent GTA Vice City and shoot people and wreck cars all day.

      Just in case you were wondering how Smokey and The Bandit was, it was all that I remembered and more. I stayed up way too late watching that movie. So many funny quotes, funny scenes, the car scenes choreographed by the famous Hal Needham, who also co-wrote the movie. Who is Hal Needham you may ask? You probably wouldn't know him if you saw him, but you have seen his work. Every great car chase or scene in every great movie was choreographed by him. Most of the stuntmen in movies today owe him as the reason why they got into the business. He's a good guy.   Super Troopers went equally good, although less of a vintage, it is still a funny ass movie. And I am eagerly awaiting Drunken Lizard's new movie "Club Dread." I think it comes out later this month.  Another reason why I love Smokey and The Bandit is because I like Burt Reynolds. Not really 1990's or recent Burt, but old school, 1970's and 80's Bandit and Cannonball run. Seriously, the man was a rock star back then. He had the coolest cars, the best girlfriends and wives, and every woman wanted him. He was the Brad Pitt of the early 80's. And, he is an alumni of my fraternity. Florida State, class of 1957. And even though I am not an active member of my fraternity (I'm an alum) I still take pride in the accomplishments of other brothers.

      Why is fate shining down upon me at this very moment? Not only does Smokey and The Bandit (the Greatest Movie of All Time) come on tonight, but so does Super Troopers. I'll have to do some flipping, but I should be able to see all the best parts of both. And just when I was complaining about tv....

      Actually, quite a few. First, the Grammy's. They are still ongoing. They've been on since 7:00pm, and they won't be off until 10:30pm. That's a lot of freaking music. My beefs so far? OutKast. And Parliament Funk. And anyone else who played during that 10 minute tribute to funk. I don't like funk. I don't suspect most people my age do.   My next beef is with the Japanese. ABC is showing the movie Pearl Harbor tonight, I suppose trying to bring some viewers over from CBS during commercials. I realize the attack on Pearl Harbor was a long time ago, but every time I see that movie, especially the scenes of the sailors being straffed by the Japanese bombers as they struggled to keep their heads above the water amid the burning oil and ships, that really get's my blood boiling. It may be silly, and it may be far in the past, but that really pisses me off. As I've explained before, I am incredibly patriotic, and although I do not agree with every decision the powers that be have made in recent years, I do believe that there is no better place, no better government, no better way of life and no better people anywhere on the planet than the United States of America.   And what the hell is up with cable TV? For the two years prior to my moving into my new house, I have not had cable tv. I had bunny ears, and I got 5 local channels, including Fox and The WB. It was really all I needed. But when I moved in here, I acquired digital cable. I was pretty pumped. Not really because I watch a whole lot of tv, but because I would have channels like Discovery Health and a bunch of HBO's and Showtime's and Cinemax's. What I've figured out is that the movie channels show an abysmal selection of movies. I saw Daredevil for the first time, and that was cool. I've seen Super Troopers, and some other cool movies, but for the most part they suck. Let's see what's on right now: Half Past Dead, starring Steven Segul and Ja-Rule. Great. The L-Word. Some show about lesbians. Ok, that's cool. Let's see, what else? Mr. Deeds. Funny ass movie, but everyone has seen it a million times. Misson: Impossible. Why would you show part 1 when part 2 is so much better? Same thing with Bad Boys. And why in the fuck would you show Smokey and the Bandit II when part 1 was the only good one?   Here's another question. Why do the soft core porns on Cinemax start earlier on Sunday's? Seriously, has anyone else noticed this? Maybe my Mid-Western upbringing makes this seem weird to me?  That's it for now. I'm going to let myself be disappointed more by the Grammy's, and get ready for work tomorrow. And maybe watch that lesbian show....

      Sorry kids, but I've been pretty busy lately and haven't had time to post a lot.   That said, here are some news stories I find interesting. urlLink  A girl is born  with a parasitic head. That's pretty gross. Take a look at the pictures...   urlLink Janet Jackson  will reportedly not be attending the Grammy's, where she was supposed to present an award.  urlLink  Justin Timberlake  says that he and his family was offended, and that what happened wasn't supposed to. Basically, I think one of two things happened here. I am convinced Justin Timberlake was not involved in a scheme to show Janet's breast on tv. Either Janet Jackson meant for that to happen, and lied to Justin Timberlake about the red brassiere that was supposed to stay on, or it really was a "wardrobe malfunction" and the whole damn thing ripped off. Either way, it was regrettable, but not the end of the world. If anyone is to blame, I would blame Janet and her people for putting it together and not making sure that the red lace would stay where it was supposed to. But the NFL dropping JC Chasez from the Pro Bowl is stupid. What in the hell did he do to deserve that???   urlLink  Missing former TCU professor  Laura Lee Crane was found near Davis approximately 100 yards from Interstate 35. The weird thing is that I drive by that spot on that highway a few times a week. And my brother-in-law is the Director of Murray County EMS. I'm not sure if the ambulance service had a role in recovery of the body, but I would assume the medical examiner would take care of that.   That's it for now. More posts later.

      "A man and his wife were having some problems at home and were giving each other the silent treatment.   The following week, the man realized that he would need his wife to wake him at 5 a.m. for an early morning business flight to Chicago. Not wanting to be the first to break the silence (and lose), he wrote a message on a piece of paper: 'Please wake me at 5 a.m.'   The next morning the man woke up, only to discover that it was 7 a.m. and he had missed his flight. Furious, he was about to go see why his wife hadn't woken him, when he noticed a piece of paper by the bed that read: 'It's 5 a.m. Wake up.' "

      After a tiring weekend of moving, coaching, and watching tv, I'm not really here today. I'm here. I'm doing everything I should be. But mentally I am not here. My mind is at home or somewhere on the beach. Maybe I can shake out of this stupor at lunch. Maybe I'll go to Wal-Mart and get some chicken strips and potato logs and forget I'm on a diet. Maybe.   So the moving went pretty well. I have one load left at my sister's house, but all of my essentials are at my new house. I set my room up last night, and if I do say so myself, it looks pretty bomb. My goal is to keep it as clean as it is now forever.   Coaching went darn good too. After a great practice last Friday and some scrimmaging, our team went into our game Saturday looking like a real basketball team! They were passing the ball, fast-breaking, driving to the hole, and making shots. At half-time we were up 24-0. So in the third quarter we took our two best players out, and the other team scored 10 points. Then we put our starting five back in and won 36-10. My neice had 16 or 18 points, most of those from driving the lane and fast-breaking. All in all, my brother-in-law and I were extremely happy with the way the game went, and very very proud of our girls for their excellent performance and hustle.

      I had a really fun day. Really fun. I was able to finish up a marketing flyer before lunch. My boss was late to our 8:00am sales meeting this morning, so he had to buy lunch. After lunch I went out marketing. Get in car, drive to insurance agency, go in say hi, drop off folder, go back to car, repeat. Pretty straightfoward stuff, and I really love getting out and meeting people. At one of the agencies I ran into my friend Jacob, who I will work with at Murray County EMS on the weekends. He's a super cool guy, and he's also a firefighter at Lexington.   When I got done with that, my roommate and I, author of  urlLink the worst blog ever  played some football in the front yard. Then my really hot neighbor came out and started working on her yard, and the not so bad looking neighbor across the street started working on hers, so we sat on the porch and watched them work. And looked at our grass, which is pretty long. Then noticing that we were the only house on the block that hadn't mowed their lawn. So we were pretty embarrassed. Thursday it will be mowed.   Then I went to Wal-Mart and got some dinner. Then to the Dollar store for paper towels. Yes, they are cheap and crappy. But in a house with 3 guys, you basically waste money on good paper towels.   When I got back to the house, my really hot neighbor was still working on her lawn in the twilight. Of course she's probably 15 years my senior, and her 16 year-old daughter is closer to my age. I stood there telling myself, "James, you talk to complete strangers all day. Pretty people, ugly people, crazy people, men, women, powerful businessmen. Why don't you just go over and say hi?" So, with a business card in hand, I went over and introduced myself.   "Hi, I'm James. I live next door. Here's my card, if you ever need anything, or see anything weird around the house when I am gone, give me a call. No, I didn't buy the house, we're renting. Yea, me and my roommates. No, I don't think we'll be having anymore parties. Yes, they were all loud. No, I didn't live here then. Kim... It's super nice to meet you Kim (making direct eye contact, letting the handshake linger for an extra second, repeating the name to memory). Well Kim, (using the verbal equilvalent of a JDAM, the first name) I should get back inside. Mosquitos are already bad this year. Yea, it was a beautiful day. Maybe I'll see you tomorrow. Oh, by the way. I'm also a medic, so if you and your kids ever need any emergency medical help, let me know. I've got a trauma kit in the car. (Sorry girls, had to be macho!) Have a great night! "  And yes, although she does have a few years on her, she is very pretty up close. I think I just became the neighbor boy who will get stuck helping her carry heavy things and changing tires. That's cool though. She's a single mom with a teenage girl and a 8 year old son. She could probably use the help. The help of a young strapping man. Uh... anyway.   That was really about it. I am about to go to bed so I can get up in the morning and run. I have another post in mind, so maybe I will type it right now. Or maybe I'll go get a bottle of water and put it off until tomorrow. We'll see.

      I've noticed as I've gotten older that I tend to reflect upon my life more often. I started doing this as a concious effort to fully enjoy every day, and by reflecting on my days, I can refine what I want to do and add it to the next day's agenda. But it also has another effect. It makes me slightly introspective. When I reach a little gem of truth, I try to pass it on to my friends. So let me do that now.   Never trust anyone.   I cannot tell you how crucial this is. It took me a really long time to believe fully and practice in this principle. Sure, I still believe people are basically good, but that won't stop them from fucking you over. Friends, family, girlfriends, fraternity brothers, bosses, and partners. And everyone else you can think of. Because when it comes down to it, everyone is looking out for there own ass. Thing about it, don't you? Don't you look out for yourself before everyone else? Even when people do nice things for others, it usually serves a purpose for them. I do you a favor, you owe me. I loan you $20, now, not only do you owe me $20, you are oew me a favor. I give you a ride somewhere, now you owe me something. It makes you feel all good about yourself, and isn't that the selfish part of it. Should you stop helping people? No. I won't. I'll help anyone I can  But do I trust anyone? Fuck no. I used to trust people. And my friends, family, girlfriends, business partners, everyone has fucked me over. Just for their own interests. Do I go around screwing people for this? Nope. It took me a while to learn the lesson, but I learned it.   Never trust anyone.   Never.   Not even, shit, especially not a girl/boyfriend. I can hear you now. "But my boy/girlfriend would never fuck me over!" Yea right. They'll screw you quicker than anyone.   Some people will read this and say I'm cynical. That guy just has shitty friend/family/girlfriends. Not so. I have a great family. Great friends. One great love, and a lot of little good ones. But when it comes down to it, everyone in the above categories has betrayed the trust I have put in them. Everyone.   And I see it all the time too. Girls I know that get fucked over by their boyfriends/ fiances. Associates that get fucked over by their trusted employees. Mothers betrayed by daughters, and vice versa.   So people of the web, I implore you. Take heed of my advice. It won't make you bitter. If I come off bitter it is unintended. I am a very happy guy with a remarkable future in front of me. And I owe it to my Golden Rule.   NEVER TRUST ANYONE.

      A mother, father and young son are visiting the circus. When the elephants walk out onto the circus ring, the little boy asks his mother, "What's that?"  "That's the elephant's tail," she replies.  "No, under the tail," says the youngster.  The mother is clearly embarrassed and says, "Oh, nothing."  The boy turns to his father and repeats the same question. His father looks and says, "That's the elephant's penis, son."  "So why did mom say it was nothing?" asks the boy.  The father draws himself up to his full height and says, "Son, I've spoiled that woman."

      When did it start? Where did it go? Why is it already 10:30? And why don't I have anything done? Perhaps I will never know.  So I had a weird dream last night. I dreamt that I met a girl at a basketball game or some such event, and that she really liked me. Then she was my girlfriend, only it was early in the relationship when you still like everything about the other person. So when I woke up, I was a little depressed that it didn't really happen. I've been single for almost a year now, so maybe that was my unconcious telling me I'm ready to be in a relationship again. We'll see. I haven't really been looking, so maybe I will start paying better attention to women, since I am making as much money as i was in insurance and not having to work 60 hours a week.  *Update* It just occured to me that I started this post last night 10:30pm and didn't actually publish it until some point this morning. Apparently I fell asleep last night on my bed, fully clothed, until some time this morning when I woke up and kicked off my shoes. Now see why I need a girlfriend?

      Three reasons why I should be in bed right now.   1) I really, really need the sleep.  2) I can only get into trouble after midnight.  3) I enjoy waking up feeling refreshed.  Three reasons why I am not going to bed.  1) The new Men's Health magazine.  2) I can only get into trouble after midnight.  3) Overwhelming guilt about never updating website.   Ok, so not completely overwhelming. But still guilt. See, when I started this blog, I used it as an excuse to take short breaks from my work as an insurance agent. But now when I am at work, there is no time to blog. So I have to do it at home. Which means I have to get off of the bed, stop watching TV, stop playing Playstation, come inside, not play with the dog, and stop reading. So some nights all or some of the above wins out. Plus, although my life has gone through some major changes lately, not a lot has been noteworthy. And I hate typing out really long stories, because I always end up one some other plane entirely. Which leads me to my next post.

Never walk into a relationship you don't know how to walk out of.   Never walk into a business deal you don't know how to walk out of.   Never walk into a restaurant you don't know how to walk out of.   Never walk into a free porn site you don't know how to walk out of.

      Sunday, beautiful cloudy and cool Sunday. Why can't you be more like you sister Saturday? Beautiful sunny and warm Saturday. Could be worse, at least it's not raining.   Let's see, I would have accomplished more of my goals this weekend if it wouldn't have been for my good friend Shiner Boch. Shiner and I went over a friend's house on Friday night, after leaving the Vista. We then proceeded to get drunk and womanize until Saturday morning at about 8am, which is when Shiner and I got home. He mowed the lawn yesterday while I recovered. See, Shiner handles his shit better than I do. And no ladies, he's not cold filtered. So last night, Shiner and I went to a friend of a friend's house, with our friend, for a belated St. Patricks party. Again, with a touch of lime, Shiner and I proceeded to have a damn good time, and after getting home at 1am, Shiner and I retired.  So now it's Sunday, I've laid in bed all day, after sleeping until 11am. Of course, between Friday and Saturday I had slept a total of 6 hours, so I needed to sleep. Now I am making my gocery list for the week (veggie quesadillas anyone?), I am remembering that I am supposed to look at a roof for my best friends new house. So now I need to call them so I can get up to OKC before the entire day is gone. Then I'll hang up clothes and vacuum, and cook. And go get my groceries. I've banished Shiner for the day, he's not allowed back into my room until Tuesday at the earliest. He's a bad influence.   Maybe, just maybe, I'll even update my info page with my new work info, as I am no longer an insurance agent. I may just have Shiner do that tomorrow. Not sure yet.   So faithful and not so faithful readers, I leave you with the quote of the day, soon to appear above this very post. And I'll post again soon, and I may even try to be witty.

      Here we are again kiddos, another st. paddy's day down the drain. This year I did not go have green beer. I did work all day long, and then I came home and watched TV and tried to get my damn internet working. Which, I did, because that is how I'm typing here now.   So right now I have Letterman on in the background, and I am sitting here open-jawed at how incredibly stupid and flighty Courtney Love is. Seriously, I have never seen anyone so out of it in my entire life. Also, on Oprah, Howie from the now defunct Backstreet boys is talking about his addiction problems. He should be going to trucker cap rehab. Ashton ruined those for everyone.   Last weekend I went to my parent's house in lovely McAlester, OK. It was pretty nice, as on Saturday I did not leave the house once, nor did I get dressed. This weekend I am staying in Norman, and there is a very good chance I am going to go fishing for a few hours on Saturday, and I may do some yard work here at my house. We have a little flowerbed area in front of the house, so I think I am going to plant some flowers.   So, other than occasionally getting out of town and working, I have not been doing much at all. It's late, so I am going to go to bed so I can actually wake up for my run tomorrow.

      So we finally get out new modem, and router, and now we don't have enough damn Cat-5 cable to network our computers. So, no internet at home for me. We were going to fix it last night, but instead we had a spring break moment and drank beer and played PS2 all night. By the end of the night, my roommates were having to wake me up to take my shots on Tiger Woods 2004. Ha ha! It was fun as hell though, I've got some bomb ass roommates. And my roomie across the hall, the author of  urlLink Drunk-O-Vision , cooked up some Penne pasta with grilled chicken in an alfredo sauce last night that was SO damn good I could eat it all the time. ALL THE TIME. Tonight I'm cooking some Mexican casserole, so if anyone is in Norman and wants a hot meal, give me a call! Ok, back to work. I am going to get the internet at my house working again tonight, so hopefully I'll be able to update every day again.

      We've been having modem issues at my house, so that's why I haven't been able to post in a few days. Hopefully, we'll have those fixed by tonight, if my roomate will go buy a router. Anyway, I have my First Responder test at 3pm in El Reno, so I am going to get back to studying. Wish me luck!

      I know, I have gotten into a really bad habit of not posting very much, and I do not want to be that guy. You know, the guy with the blog that never posts. You check back every week, and there is never anything new.   On that note, here is a new Monday special. It's called Hot, New, Old. This is going to be where I outline what is hot, new, and old, but still great. So, without further ado:  Hot right now: Right now, Mase is hot. Not the kind you ladies spray in offensive men's faces, but the once rapper from Bad Boy Entertainment. Now, he is a preacher. But back in the mid and late 90's, Mase was the shit. I'm having a Mase resurrection. (Why You Over There Looking At Me?)  Joss Stone: This girl may be very young, but she has a damn good voice, and beautiful face and body, and good cover songs. (Fell in Love With a Boy)  Anything by N.E.R.D.: Their new song "She Wants to Move"? The Hotness. Pure and simple.  New Right Now: Joss Stone, Black Eyed Peas, N.E.R.D, Jerry Reed, Switchfoot, Yeah Yeah Yeah's, Dizee Rascal. (Fix Up Look Sharp)  Old Stuff: Jerry Reed (East Bound and Down), Clint Black, B.I.G, Missy Elliot, Toby Keith.   Updates from my weekend to come.....

      So, my first two days at my new job have been going really great. The guy that hired me (Michael) is the same guy that took me out of Information Technology and brought me into insurance. So, he has a lot of confidence in me and we have been best friends for the last two years or so.   So, yesterday I pretty much got into the groove of things and got into sync with what the company is doing.   Today, I started calling District Managers for a large insurance company to get them to send their new agents to our pre-licensing classes. Basically, my job is two-fold with one purpose. Bring money into the company. By: setting up HeartSafe environments in regional businesses, and selling AED's and CPR training and First Aid training, and getting students for insurance pre-licensing and continuing education classes. It's a lot of fun, and the income potential is definitely what I would call appealing.   So that's mostly what I have been up to. Just trying to sell my insurace agency (any buyers?) and get my new job started. I'm still a young professional, but now I have a few less headaches.   Holla!

      I want to get something straight for Wal-Mart goers that applies to a few different things. The next time you walk into Wal-Mart, look up right before you walk through the sliding doors. Notice how one says "exit" and the other says "enter"? You walk IN to the ENTER door, and when you leave, you walk OUT the EXIT door. I know, it's hard to comprehend this.   EVERY SINGLE TIME I have the misfortune of having to go to Wal-Mart, I almost always have to walk around someone walking out the in door, and in the out door. It really is enough to make a man insane. I have also noticed that the same people that do that are the same ones that almost always run you over with their buggies, park their buggies in the middle of the aisle while they amble their fat asses around looking for the cookies, or walk BESIDE the person they are with who is pushing the buggy. GUESS WHAT! You are blocking the whole fucking aisle. The entire damn thing. And when that fucking buggy hits my flip-flopped foot, it hurts like hell. And when a red-faced tall brown-haired guy behind you is gritting his teeth, be wary. He may be about to snap. You may have pushed that otherwise incredibly courteous young man (courteous to a fault) to the very edge of his limits. And he may be about to grip you by the neck and twist very violently. Or at least play it through his mind 30 times.   Meanwhile you are looking at the canned corn trying to figure out if you want regular or creamed with your damn buggy in the middle of the aisle.   Maybe I have some deep seated anger issues with people at Wal-Mart. It certainly sounds like it to me.   OH, and when you have been standing in line at the express lane with 30 items, trying to act like you aren't aware you are over the limit, and I'm standing behind you with a 12 pack of diet coke and a frozen pizza in my hands for 20 minutes, do some prep work. Don't wait until you get the the cashier, watch them scan all of your stuff, then look through your purse finding your credit card. "I just had it at Target...." It's not like you are unaware that you have to pay for the stuff when they get done scanning it. Find your credit card, sign your check, grab a $20 while you are standing in line. That way you won't make a very nice guy behind you in line envision snapping your neck. While your kid runs all over the store and bumps into other people and steps on their flip-flop clad feet. But the kids are a whole other story....

      So it's Tuesday night and here I am talking about my weekend. Why? Because my weekend did not end until late yesterday. I went to McAlester last weekend, and on Sunday went fishing with my dad and cousin. It rained a lot over there last week, so all the creeks were very full and running fast. Sunday morning I caught 7 Sand Bass and one 15 pound Drum fish. Sunday afternoon I caught 8 more Sand Bass. All in all, lots of fun. I went out looking for other places to fish up here around Norman so if anyone knows of any good places let me know.

      I am off to McAlester for the weekend. I have to go see an ill family member. Everyone have a great weekend, and upon my return to the center of the cultural universe that is Norman, Oklahoma, I will astound you with stories of my heroic deeds. Heroic you may ask? Going to the Wal-Mart in McAlester and not punching some ingrate in the face is a heroic task. Believe me!

      Hey everybody. If you haven't tried any of Oklahoma's wines, you need to go give them a try. On May 1st, there is going to be a  urlLink Wine Fest  in Nuyaka, OK. Nuyaka Creek Winery has some fantastic wines. You can buy them in Norman at Joe's Place over on Alameda and 12th.   Admission is only $5, and that gets you a souvenir wine glass and you get to taste all the wines there. Plus, it's on my birthday! Which, is regrettably why I may not get to go. But if anyone else does go, take some pictures or at least email me and let me know how it goes.

      Well Fox News is making this one easy for me. Apprently the big stories of the day are child molester Michael Jackson amd a Drug Import Bill. Just in case no one noticed  urlLink a train crash in North Korea  killed 3,000 people. That is more people than were killed on 9/11. Are they less important because North Koreans are Communists? Well, at least they're government is. I've been flipping channels all day, and I haven't seen anything about it on the news channels. At least Yahoo! has it listed.

      Young Kid + Shitty car = Drag Racer?  It confuses me too. But apparently anytime you get a young person into a crappy car it turns them into a race car driver. I was driving to get lunch earlier, and some damn kid comes flying up behind me, switching lanes, trying desperately to get in front of me. He had to settle for beside me at a red light. Then, while I'm sitting there listening to the stereo and poignantly ignoring him, he proceeds to rev his car up like he wants to race me. I think I've addressed this before, but come on! He is in a 80's era Cougar, you know, the big hood era. Shitty paint. Bald ass tires. Needs a washing real bad. I'm in my gleaming Mustang. Chrome wheels. Clean. Runs good. So when the light turns green, guess what happens? He takes off, spewing blue smoke from his tailpipe and swerves into my lane. I accelerate normally, no blue smoke, no wasted gas. Was it as fun as blowing his doors off? No. But was it more satisfying. Hell yea!

      Before I forget to write about it, today is the anniversary of the the Oklahoma City Bombing. On April 19th, 1995 I was in Junior High in Pittsburg County, OK. I heard about the bombing from my math teacher, who was also the school counselor. Later in that class period, he took a call in the office. When he came back, he had tears streaming down his face. His best friend from his childhood, who was also his best friend then, had been confirmed as a casualty. It was the first time I ever saw a grown man cry. I was 15. This mountain of a man, feared by all, cryed unabashedly for his friend, in front of a bunch of 8th graders.   To this day, that is still the most prevalent memory I have of that day. I remember going home that day and watching it on TV with my mom. I still didn't completely understand the enormity of it.   It caught up with me again on September 11th, 2001. But it didn't really strike home until about 2 months ago.   I was heading to Leadership Square, the Bank of America building in downtown Oklahoma City. I was driving slightly aimlessly eastward through downtown, looking for my cross street. As I pulled up to a stoplight and played with my radio, I realized it was deathly quiet outside my car. As I looked up I noticed a lot of people milling around. Then I saw the chain link fence with flowers and teddy bears tied on it. Finally I looked straight ahead and up to the huge black monument with the numbers 9:03 in it.   That day back in 1995 came flooding back to me as I realized that not only had I never been to the Oklahoma City Memorial, I had never made a point to go. I'd lived in the Metro area for 4 years, and never went. Then I remembered my math teacher that day years ago crying. Sitting in my car at the red light, I cried a little too. Not only for his friend, but for every wife, husband, mom, dad, and child that lost their lives there on that terrible day.   That was a horrible day in Oklahoma history, but also a horrible day in American history. It ushered in a new time of living in fear, even though no one realized it then.   Terry Nichols is being tried in my hometown by one of my hometown judges. I've met Judge Steven Taylor on several occasions, most recently when I spoke at a conference on risk management and terrorism regarding the McAlester Army Ammunition Depot. He is a fair and just man. But impartial or not, I hope that Terry Nichols sees the death penalty. I take great pleasure in the feeling that he will have his death decided for him, which it exactly what he and Timothy McVeigh did for 168 people on April 19th, 1995.

      Hello everybody! Hello Dr. James!  Sorry, crude Simpsons reference. How is everyone?  So my weekend was awesome. From Saturday morning at 8:30am to somewhere around 5:30pm, I played softball. I played in the "Heroes of The Year" softball tournament in beautiful Murray County, Oklahoma. It was Murray County EMS, Sulphur Police, Sulphur Fire Department, and the Oklahoma Highway Patrol. All battling it out in a double elimination tournament. And I gotta be honest, playing with those guys was a real honor. I'm just dabbling in Emergency Medicine, but those guys all put their lives on the line everyday.   I had 3 home runs, 5 or 6 RBI's, several snags out in left field, and one hell of a time. I also got a vicious sunburn (mostly the right side of my body), and a pretty gnarly strawberry on my left leg, below the knee. To those outside of the baseball world, a strawberry is what happens when you slide into a base (like me with shorts on) and the dirt and rock from the infield take the skin off of your leg. So I have two nasty little places on my left leg. But, as my dad would say, I've had worse cuts than that on my eyeball. Besides being the greatest dad ever and my best friend, my dad has a little redneck in him.   Sunday I layed on my sister's couch all day and tried not to move. Not that I could have if I wanted to. I was very stiff and very sore. So, now I am doubly intense in my workout and diet program. Because if 8 or 9 hours of softball make me that sore, I am WAY out of shape.   That was pretty much my weekend. Lots of fun, lots of pain. Lots of neices and nephews. Good times had by all.

Seriously, I promise.

      Ok, I may draw some heat from this one, but I'm writing it anyway.   I am so pissed off with the uber PC environment that we have created here in America. I will get into it more, but tonight I will focus on the feminization of mankind.   When I say mankind, I mean men. Not all mankind, but men. So, mankind for years has been, well.... manly. We drink, smoke, cuss, and take what we want when we want. Ok, so that's a caveman version of who we are, but it all boils down to the same thing.  I think I am an enlightened man. I'm tolerant. I listen to all types of music. I like ballet. I read GQ religously. I dress neat. I don't fuss, but I like my hair and my body to be well-groomed. But guess what? I am a man! I love beer. I love women, and sex, and dammit, if beer is involved, that's pretty great too! Shocked yet? You shouldn't be. I'm the man of your dreams.  All women say that they want a sensitive man. "I need a man that understands me." "I want someone that thinks of me, and takes bubble baths." Women, you should be able to say that. but you shouldn't say it around us. Know why? The vast majority of men take those things to heart. They try to turn into that guy. And all the while, you continue to date men you say you don't like. Brutes who don't call you when they say they will. Maybe they think of themselves first. Maybe they don't buy flowers. They sure as hell don't let you pick the movie, restaurant, or when you meet their parents. And women eat that shit up. They really do. Because as much as they say they want a sensitive guy, they really want a confident man. Someone who knows what he wants, knows how to go about it, and almost always gets it. And, if you mouth off to some guy at a bar, your boyfriend can beat the shit out of him. Or if some guy gropes you, your man can beat his ass. This guy makes you feel secure.   Still with me?   I'm also tired of the apparent attempt by the media to portray men as bumbling idiots who can't control anything. The most striking example is a commercial that is currently playing nationally. The guy and the girl, alone in a lake on a romantic boat. "Your eyes, your smile" he says. "The lake" she says. "Yea the lake" he says. "No, the lake is coming in the boat" she says. Oh, I can handle this, he says. Then while he is bumbling around like a fucking idiot, she pulls out a goshdamn mothertrucking tampon to plug the fucking whole.  First of all, tampons are gross. Yes, I know what they are used for. Yes, in addition to being medically trained, I also had a serious girlfriend for 3 years. And yes, I think they are gross as hell. Necessary, but not something I want to see on TV. But when you are using them to plug the whole in a boat, like "Woman to the rescue with my trusty feminine product", while the man looks like an inept asshole, that really pisses me off.   Ever look at men role models on TV. Malcolm in the Middle's dad? Idiot. Homer Simpson. Idiot. Fraiser, a smart guy? Commonly played as a dupe. Arbor Mist commercials? All men in those are acting like idiots.  Is it a man's world? No. Should it be? Not really. I am all for equal rights for people of all races, nationalities, credos, religions, genders.... Everything. Everyone should have their say. But it is time that men take their gender back!  Take it back men! Don't ask your wife or girlfriend where she wants to eat a thousand times. "I don't know". Ask her once, then make a fucking decision. Grow your balls back. Don't ask her if it's ok if you call her. Tell her you will call her. Why ask permission? Think women respect you for that? Hell no. You have to ask permission to call her? What else can't you do on your own? Want to spend time with your boys? Don't ask her, tell her. Want to date other people. Don't string her along, tell her.   Does this mean I am  condoning  treating women like shit? Far from it. I have more respect for women than most people. Women are wonderful. They should be revered. But show you are worthy of their affections. Be confident. Be decisive. Be a man worth their time. Be thoughtful. Be affectionate. But most of all, be a man. No matter what Dr. Phil says, you should never say you are sorry for being who you are.  *** Edited by siteowner*** My roommate just pointed out to me last night that I had wrote condeming instead of condoning. No, I do not condone treating women like shit. Thanks.

      Ok everyone. I don't know about you, but I use my website to list all of the links I read on a daily basis. So when I am out surfing around and I come across a cool site, I bookmark it, follow it for a few weeks, and if if is really cool, I link it to my site. Hopefully I will be able to avoid the super-duper long links list. But, there are a lot of great writers out there, so maybe not.   But, here are some of the new links I have added.   Run over and see if you can figure out what  urlLink  vortexia's secret   is. Maybe you could go agree that  urlLink  Girls are Pretty  ? I know I do! Not sure where  urlLink  Katie is at  ? Go find out! For some great high school humor (that is way ahead of it's time) see what  urlLink  Chokey Chicken has to offer  . And last but not least, see why  urlLink  this is class warfare  . He'll tell you all you need to know about life.  Was that last paragraph cheesy? Yep. Did it take me 10 minutes? You bet. Do I have anything better to do? no. :(

      Today was a good day. And no, I didn't even have to pull my AK. Ok, sorry, bad reference. But, it was a cool day. On top of my already busy schedule, I have taken a job as a sales consultant with a Farmers agent in Norman. I am going to be taking over her telemarketing hiring/firing, training, and marketing. All for a nominal fee. And the agent is great.  And, I met the girl I may marry. (ok, date perhaps) Her name is Adelina, she is my friend Heather's new telemarketer. She is from Kosovo, and has a great accent. But none of these things matter. Any physical attributes, accents, and personality are completely secondary. This girl has one thing. She loves Chappelle's show. Yes, the one from Comedy Central.   Seriously, when this girl does any impression of Dave Chappelle, it is funny as shit. And yes, this is when the accent comes into play. This girl is awesome. And, she has a smart-ass sense of humor just like I do.   Do I really love her. No. Am I serious about dating her? Doubtful. But will she likely entertain me, double me over with laughter, and catch my attention every second I'm around her? Yes. And the best thing? She acts like I'm nothing. Not a smile, no more than absolutely necessary words to me. Yea, hard to get is SO hot.

Presents the Clones, N.E.R.D. feat Jay-Z. "Frontin"  "Every time your name was brought up I would act all non-chalant, in front of an audience. Like you were just another shorty I put the naughty on. But uh, truth be told, you threw me for a loop and it's Hov. I'm too old to be frontin what I'm feeling, Denzeling acting like you ain't appealing when you are. Stuntin like you ain't my only girl when you are. I'm ready to stop when you are. "

      My weekend was great. I spent all day Saturday laying around the house and trying to get the flower garden looking ok. I've bought all of the soil and seeds, now I've decided just to buy some flower boxes and plant them on the porch. It's gotta be easier than de-weeding the flower garden. Yea, I'm still straight. I just want my house to look nice. On Sunday I went to Sulphur for my youngest niece Emilee's 5th birthday party. She turned 5 on April 30th. Seriously, I'm not partial to kids, but she is one of the cutest kids ever. And of course she loves her Uncle James. I got her some Care Bear Stuff and some Strawberry Shortcake stuff (yes, they still make them!). I also played a lot of baseball with my nephew, which has lead to me having a really great sunburn on my face and forearms. Yes, they hurt! Anway, that was really all I did this weekend. I was very happy to see my family, and I got some exercise as well. It was good.

      I had a great weekend and I would love to fill everyone in on it right now, but I have a horrible sunburn and I'm tired as hell. I'll fill you in tomorrow.

      On my way home last night, my stomach started grumbling. It was a little late, and although a taco sounded good, McDonalds was closer. So I stop in, get a grand royale with cheese. Around midnight, I started getting another feeling in my stomach. One very different from the hunger. Very different. So 8 hours and a very long night later, I decided it would be best if I stay away from the office today, and very close to home. I'm a bit pissed because I needed to get some stuff done today, but the good thing about my job is that I can see twice as many people tomorrow and make up for it. It won't make for a pleasant morning, but I need to get our next class filled, so I will do it. A warning for everyone, stay away from the McDonalds at 12th and Alameda in Norman. They're cooking something up other than just golden fries...

      Ok kids, it's almost time for my internet to be turned on at my new apartment. So hopefully by the end of this week I will be blogging daily again.  Seriously, you waited two weeks, you can wait one more!

      Aren't we all? Hello everyone! I know it's been over a week since I've posted, but I have been busier than all get out. Whatever that means. Anyway, this last week has been crazy as hell. And, this week I am moving. I am going to move to a small efficiency until June 1, at which point I will move into a new apartment. The purpose of this long story is to tell you that I am waiting to have internet service restored at my residence until I move to my more permanent home on June 1st, so my blogging will be spotty until then. I'm sure I will still manage to get a few posts out.   Anyway, I hope everyone is doing great!

      Well, about three weeks ago I left my comfy cocoon of sales and marketing and ventured full-time into the world of EMS. I am no longer involved in the procurement of insurance policies. Now all I do is offer free advice (ok, it costs a beer) on insurance problems to my friends and family. I have also left the field of professional education as far as insurance pre-licensing and continuing education is concerned.   Now, I work full-time as an EMT at a non-emergency patient transport  company in Oklahoma City, as well as a part-time EMT at Murray County EMS on the weekends.  Anyone that knows me would think that this may be weird, but I don't think anyone has realized how hard the EMS bug bit me. I just got started in it part-time early this year for some extra money and to see if it was something that I liked. Well, it turns out that I like it a lot. There's something about getting a call on the radio and screaming down the street hot (lights and sirens on). At the same time there is nothing like having a patient genuinely appreciate that you moved them from points A to B safely, securely, and painlessly.   So for now I am going to continue to work as an EMT, and I have yet more schooling coming up in August. I have decided that I want to be a flight medic. You can read more about that  urlLink here .  I am going to keep the name of my site the same, since I just switched from insurance professional to medical professional. I may even be leaning towards med school in the future.

      Ok, southeast really. I'm off to fun-filled McAlester again for a weekend full of fishing, mom's cooking, and general lounging. And, and twins! Woah, where did that beer commercial come from?   Anyway, we are having a mother's day, co-birthday parties for me and my brother-in-law on Sunday, so here's to hoping I get a lot of presents and at least one chocolate cake!  Everyone have a great weekend, and I will wow you all with tales of daring from the armpit of America when I get back.

      So yesteday was Cinco de Mayo. But it was also  urlLink my roommates  birfday. So I'm laying on my bed after working a 10 hour day yesterday, and my roommate walks in yelling "It's Miller de Mayo! Get some clothes on. We're going out."  So he leaves to go up to Bill's. I get dressed, look all fresh to death and smelling right. Then I go up to Bill's. After a few hours, a few beers, and a thousand "It's Miller de Mayo's!", I left. I had a really good time, and got to hang out with my friends, and see my roommate have a super good time, which is really why I went in the first place.   But now I have a slight hangover, so I am going to order some chinese food (yes it will make me feel better) and lay in my bed and watch tv. I'm off today!!!

      Well, tonight is the official one year anniversary of the ending of my relationship to the only woman I have ever loved.   We met during homecoming week at OU. She was a Chi Omega, I was a Phi Delt. We were together for 3 years, with her spending the last year in Dallas trying to find a post-graduation job.  It was the only time I have ever trusted anyone, and the only time I have ever fully given myself over to another human.   I suppose I still have a lot of things to work out over that relationship and how it ended, but I don't really think I want to. It ended because she is a selfish bitch who was too concerned with her own life to support the career of a man who had always supported hers.   I really did love her, and the time we had together was great. Except for the last day. I don't think I will ever really get over her, but I don't think anyone ever does get over their first love. And that's really what she was. And I guess that was all she will ever be. We haven't seen one another since May 2, 2003, when I was packing up and driving to McAlester after driving to Dallas to be broken up with. Not that I knew it was going to happen. We were supposed to be celebrating my birthday. Sorry, I don't love you anymore. But you can keep the Playstation. I haven't spoken to her on the phone since last July, as we could not talk on the phone without bringing up our relationship, which bothered her. And I have not emailed her since last October, when we had our last big blowout fight to end all fights. I'm still ashamed of that last email I sent to her, because my only purpose in sending it was to hurt her. Self defense I suppose.   This is the first and last time I will ever post specifically about her. But today is a rather big day for me. Today I found out that I am a different person than I was 3 years ago. I am more confident, more sure, and maybe even a better person than I used to be. So without making a habit of doing this, I am going to post some song lyrics that describe how I feel, relating directly to the ex-girlfriend.  "New Deep" by John Mayer ***(Lyrics have been edited for length)***  I'm so alive I'm so enlightened I can barely survive A night in my mind I've got a plan I'm gonna find out just how boring I am And have a good time  Cause ever since I tried Trying not to find Every little meaning in my life It's been fine I've been cool With my new golden rule  Numb is the new deep Done with the old me And talk is the same cheap it's been  I'm a new man I wear a new cologne and You wouldn't know me if your eyes were closed I know what you'll say 'This won't last longer than the rest of the day' But you're wrong this time You're wrong  Numb is the new deep Done with the old me I'm over the analyzing Tonight  Stop trying to figure it out (you try to figure, you try to figure it out) It will only bring you down

      It's my birthday. That's right kids, today is my birfday. 24 years ago today I entered this world, bent on total global domination.  While I'm still working on that, I am going to go have a happy birfday dinner and drink some happy birfday beer. No doubt I'll be partying until tomorrow, so I will see you all then.

      The sky must be falling. Or I must have another day off. Or both. But two posts in one week, now that's just crazy! So what have I been up too? Well, I'm waiting on my new apartment to get ready so I can move. And I have been working my ass off. Tonight I am headed to Murray County, OK. My neices and nephew have baseball games all day tomorrow, and if the situation presents itself I may go on a few runs with my brother-in-law, the EMS Director down yonder.   That's really about it. I'm kinda pressed for time, as always, but I will be sure to update again as soon as I can. I hope everyone has a great weekend!

      Hello all!!!  So due to an untimely dropping out of my roommate, or more likely, the delaying of him moving in with me, I have had to restart the apartment selection process. I have found and signed the lease on a 1 bedroom apartment in Norman, and as soon as it is cleaned I will be able to move in. Then after Cox takes it's 3 or 4 days to come out, I will have internet up and going again. Or at least that's the plan...  So things have been pretty crazy for me lately. I have been working 6 days a week saving lives and transporting others. It's been fun, and has further solidified my belief that this is the direction I want my life to go in. I am getting prepared to go back to OU for pre-med, and looking forward to that in January.   Really that's all that I've been up to. Going out, working, taking it easy. That's what life is all about. Especially since i know that in January my life will turn into a horror of school, work, and anatomy classes.   I hope everyone out there is doing well, and I sincerely appreciate everyone coming back to my site and making sure I am still alive. I've got some good blogs written down, so as soon as I get back online I will update everyone of the last few weeks.   Stay safe!

      Let's go wreck our cars into it! OK! That sounds like fun.    That must have been what was going on today. Apparently everyone forgot how to drive in the rain. Come on people, it's only been a few weeks. My partner and I saw at least 5 accidents today, with all of them being on either I-44 or I-40 at the Amarillo junction. Couple of rollovers, semi vs. auto, and other idiots.     So my day started off at 4am. I went and picked up my van, in the dark, in the rain. Then I noticed that one of the headlights was out. Super fun. After my ass crack of dawn transport, I took the van into the shop, then picked up my partner for the day.     Anyway, I'm tired as hell, and I have to get up tomorrow and do it all again. And I'm working Friday at Murray County. I'm off to bed to dream about what kind of traffic accidents I will get to see tomorrow.     Oh, and a little sidenote to idiots. When you wreck your car, you really fuck up traffic for the rest of us. And when someone else wrecks, and you drive by real slow to look, you fuck up traffic even more. And if you get involved in an accident while rubbernecking an accident, you deserve to be shot, then ticketed for being a dumbass. I'm out.

      Yea, so today at work was fun. We had to go to Lawton, twice in a row. I worked with Rachel again, and am happy to report that the weirdness is gone. We are back where we were before we started dating.     3 of my co-workers have accepted positions at EMSA. That means that on August 10th we are going to be out of drivers and medics. And I will be going to part-time on August 24th because of school. So work is about to get crazy. Crazier. But fortunately I will only be working there a few days a week, and working at Murray County the rest of the time. Maybe I can stay out of the drama that will surely play out over the next couple of months.     I have to get up at 4am tomorrow to do the 5am transports. We have some patients that go to dialysis very early in the morning. Then I have to take the van in to have some work done on it at 7am. So tomorrow when you are reading this, realize I've probably already been at work for 9 hours.     And that leads to me going to bed now. Nighty night.

      Ok, little variation on the old special. Tonight it is just music I cannot get out of my head, or iTunes.     urlLink Maroon 5  - I think Maroon 5 has not even came close to peaking yet, and if their next album is as good as their last, look out Beatles. Seriously, the songwriting, the piano, the singing, the guitar riffs, all of it is great. They can fucking rock out, or just chill. And their lead singer has a very flexible voice. And if you have heard their cd Songs About Jane, go download some of their live music. I found some just by searching for Maroon 5 live.     Best songs - This Love, Harder to Breathe, Sunday Morning. And, they do an awesome cover of "Frontin" by the Neptunes.     urlLink Jamie Callum  - This guy I just stumbled on tonight by accident. I don't know a lot about him, other than his music seems to be a mix of traditional jazz and modern jazz. Definitely someone to check out. He also has a great "Frontin" remix.    Best songs - All At Sea, Pointless Nostalgia, Too Close for Comfort.     urlLink Slum Village  - Their new song "Selfish" with Kanye West is great. It's on their new cd Detroit Deli.     urlLink Lil Flip  - Not a huge fan of his, but his new song Sunshine with Lea is pretty good, and very catchy.    For real, I can not stress enough how much you must try to find some of Maroon 5's live music. I'm listening to it now and getting goosebumps.

      Today has been great! After working all day Friday, sticking around in Murray County just in case on Saturday, I came back to Norman last night. Then I went over to Ryan's house for some homemade tacos, which were great, then drank some beers last night. Today, I slept in until 10:00am. (freaking awesome!) Then I went and ate lunch with my best friend Anthony and his wife Ashley (also my best friend). I have been friends with Anthony since the 7th grade, and Ashley since the 9th grade. We are all from the same town, went to the same college, and all live up here now. So it was cool to see them.     Tonight, well, I don't know what I am going to do. I may call my friend Jennifer and see if she and her fiance would like to go have some beers. She is moving to Virginia on Wednesday to be with him. He's in the Marine Corps, stationed at Quantico.    After that, I may just chill and watch tv. This has been a very relaxing day. I definitely need more of these. But, I know tomorrow will be busy as all hell, and I won't have another off day for a couple of weeks, so I am going to go enjoy this one while I can.

      So I am enjoying my first day off this pay period. So far so good. I slept in until 9:30am, and I have spent the remainder of my time putting dishes in the dishwasher and watching tv.     I have to go run some errands, and then I am off to Sulphur. I've got to work tomorrow so I am going to go down there tonight, get some good grub at my sisters, and then wake up bright and early to go knock out some EMSing. Oh, I just made up that word by the way. EMSing is the act of being in EMS. Not to be confused with PMSing.

      So I just got done watching the series premier of  urlLink Rescue Me  , on FX Network. Check the link out for the particulars, but it is basically a show about FDNY and how they cope with what's going on in their lives, which is an interesting angle as most shows show the work, not the personal life.     One line I thought was damn funny and summed up how a lot of EMS/Fire/Police professionals deal with their jobs. "There's an old saying in the FDNY. If you ain't scared, you're stupid. You got some puke on your chin." That was a fireman talking to a proby (probationary firefighter) after his first real fire. The proby had just thrown up in the bathroom.     That's kinda how you've got to go at it. From what I've seen from the previews of the season, it looks like a lot of the show will be dedicated to how the characters interact with the stresses of their life and job. Which isn't like saying you are an accountant and you are dealing with stress. That's like saying you pulled someone burned up out of a car wreck who later died in your arms, then you've got to go home and figure out how to pay the mortgage. Trust me, whole different set of stresses. It also looks like it is going to show how the characters deal with their problems, and they touched on that tonight.     I will undoubtedly be adding this show to the list of other shows I never miss new episodes of if I'm off work. Third Watch, Cops, NYPD 24/7. All great shows. And now Rescue Me.

      So for the third day in a row I am supposed to have the day off. And for the third day in a row I have been called in. Not only have I been called in, I have to drive the little crappy van. Apparently the best way to avoid that van is either fuck up all the time, or have it parked at your house. The girl's whom house we park it at hasn't been in it since last week, even though it is 20 feet from her front door.      This morning my boss tells me that she told the guy who was hired to drive the motherfucker to stay at home and get his shit together so he can come back tomorrow. All I can say is that at least tomorrow is my last day here this week. Because right now I am about to lose it. Friday I am working at Murray County EMS.       Anyway, I should start getting ready. At least I don't have to be in until 9:30am.

      Ok, so today was not as bad as I thought it would be. Actually, it was ok. I had to get up early, but I probably only did 4 or 5 transports, and got off work really early, like 4pm.    One old lady I moved thought that I was her grandson, even though she was 94 and her grandkids are all in their 30's, and every time I moved her I had to bear hug her. Which basically means I had to have her put her arms around my neck, then I linked my arms underneath hers and picked her up. It is a variation of a fireman's drag. Well, after I moved her both times, she gave me a kiss on the cheek. For both moves. She was incredibly sweet, and had no infectious diseases so I didn't mind. It made me feel appreciated again.     Right now I am going to have some beers at Bison Witches. Then I need to get back here before Chappelle's show comes on. At 9pm. So I will post after that and try to be funny. Also, if you are here from the link on  urlLink Lauren's site , thanks for giving me a try. Hope you like the flavor!

      Yea, so today sucked ass. Instead of being off, I got called in this morning at 9am, then I had to work with this girl, who, aside from the girl I used to date, is my least favorite person to work with. Mostly because she is fat, ugly, and talks so nasty sometimes I get embarrassed. And if you know me you may realize I never get embarrassed.   And today sucked. We were supposed to be the first van to go home, and we ended up being the last one on. Then, I was told since the new guy was fucking up and being late to every one of his pick-ups that I would be in the crappy little van tomorrow, while he sat at home as his "punishment". I then had to tell my boss that you can't punish lazy people by helping them be lazy. Then I got on the radio and gave him a good ass chewing and told him that when he fucks up I get fucked into doing his work, and that the next time this happened it would be the last.  And I'm tired as hell. Ryan came over to drink some beerr, or go get some beerr, and I had to stay home because I am too sleepy and I have to get up at 6:30am.   So I am not in a happy mood, and I am just going to go knock tomorrow out so I can cheer up and get ready for the weekend. Of course, I'll just be working, but at least I'll be on a fucking ambulance.   Good night all. If my day is less stressful tomorrow you should all be greeted by a new web site Wednesday morning.

      Now that  urlLink Ryan    has redesigned his site, I want to. I've actually been thinking about it for a while, but I wasn't wanting to mess with the html. But now apparently Blogger has a new WYSIWYG interface, and you can actually change your template pretty easily. Which basically means as soon as Ryan comes over to help me with mine, my template will change too. So, when he tells you I am copying off of him, it's true. I totally will be.     Just so everyone will know, RYAN CHANGED HIS SITE FIRST.

      But getting up hurts too much. I am staying true to my word and partying balls while I still can. Yesterday my awesome friend Heather graduated from her MBA program, so last night I went over to her house and drank a lot of beer and played poker. Until about midnight. Then, I went over to the Vista to meet Lauren from  urlLink Beautiful Mistake . We then proceeded to shut down the place, then afterpartied at one of her friends houses over on the west side. Then, me being old as shit, I had to go home at around 3:30am. I was sleepy and hungry, but fortunately Carl's Junior saved my ass.     I had a ton of fun with Lauren and her friends Kristin, Heather, and some other people who I can't remember. Maybe there was a Craig? Who knows, but they are all cool people, and I'm sure Lauren and I will take the opportunity to go out again. Maybe we can get some other bloggers to go with us? What a novel idea!    For the rest of they day I am cleaning up and unpacking my kitchen, and I may try to see a movie later. Oh, and of course keep being the pimp ass that I am.    urlLink

      Ok everyone. The American Red Cross is in dire need of blood donations. Most regions only have a one day supply of blood, and some hospitals are postponing elective surgeries until the supply is up.     I called today and scheduled an appointment for Monday, July 26th to donate blood here in Norman. If anyone wants to go with me, I am going at 6:30pm. Call 1-800 GIVE-LIFE or go to https://www.givelife.org to schedule an appointment around the same time at the Norman center. Otherwise, just call and schedule an appointment at your local center. And remember, the American Red Cross is responsible for international aid too, so if you are in Canada or across the pond you can still donate.     I have Type-O Negative blood, and I have not had a harmless virus that affects over 80% of the global population. That basically means I have rare and very pure blood, and since it is so pure it can be transfused to neonates and infants. So if you are in a similar situation, please go donate. Even if you are not a universal donor you still need to go donate.     Don't be worried, it doesn't hurt and it won't take very long. You must be at least 17, weigh 110 pounds, and be "healthy", meaning not inflicted by any chronic diseases or viruses, or if so currently be treated for said conditions.     Please, if you are able, go donate, and try to make a habit out of it. It is very safe and very easy. And just remember, one day it might be you in the ER getting a blood transfusion that will save your life, and it will all be due to a donor taking time out of his or her's schedule and giving the gift of life.

      I just got home from a night with the fraternity brothers, and Ryan. I went to Mr. Bills,d rank till closing, then went to the Commons. I then spent an hour convincing a faker asthmatic girl that she wasn't about to die, and yes she needed more Albuterol. She didn't take me seriously until I bagged her, at which point she started breathing fine. Now she is ok, and doing fine last I checked. As I said, she was faking, and threatening to call EMSSTAT seemed to be enough.

      That's pretty much how I am going to sum up how I feel about women right now. Women, don't get too pissed, I'm just in a shitty mood right now.   So guess who I got to work with today? That's right, the I'm going to stop dating you and tell you via text message girl. When she got into the van this morning, I was pretty confident that I could keep it together and the day would be just fine. What took place was the most akward and quiet day I have ever spent in the company of a woman.  Granted, dating a fellow employee is not always a good idea, and for just this reason. But I have had sex with many women that I've worked with, and everytime it turned out just fine. There was never any akwardness. Never any long pauses. Never any me turning on the radio and staring out the window while driving all day to avoid looking at her.  Am I more bitter than I thought I was? Yes, all day today I was a bitter asshole. I hid it well. She has no idea there is any animosity. And never will. But after seeing her for the first time since she was sticking her tongue down my throat 3 weeks ago, I was able to look at her more objectively. And I realized that I don't like her. And that she is chubbier than I thought.  Other than having to work with her, the day itself sucked ass too. Every patient was via stretcher, we were busier than hell all day, and there was some fucking problem with everything all day. I even had to physically restrain a guy, and restrain myself from breaking his fucking nose.   So I am headed up to get some beer. Shiner Bock. The one thing in my life that hasn't turned on me. Then I am going to watch tv, get drunk, and wake up in the morning ready to eat shit all day in the crappy wheelchair van. At least it's Friday.   And now that I have all of that poison out of my system, I am going to be in a better frame of mind for the rest of the night.

      Yes, all of the above. And not in a good, naked kind of way. Mostly ashamed and embarrassed because I have been missing a great blog. And it is even local. Everyone go check out the newly redesigned  urlLink Okiedoke . I have been incredibly remiss at not reading this site everyday, but that is something I will be remedying immediately. And you should all do the same. So go over and say hi to my Cleveland County neighbor.

      So today was a lot of fun. I went to work at 8am, then had a transport to pick up in Yukon. Before my day ended at 10pm, I had traveled all over OKC, Sulphur, and Tulsa. Sometimes the great thing about my job is I never know where I am going to end up. Sometimes the worst thing about my job is I never know where I am going to end up.   So women are really frustrating me right now. There is nothing better on this earth than a woman, especially one you have feelings for. But nothing else in my life has came close to giving me as much grief as women. GRRR!!! The old saying is true, can't live with them, can't live without them.   So I decided today that I am very quickly reverting back to being the consumate bachelor. Now that I am back in my own apartment and dating more than one woman at a time (no, I'm not a player, just very lucky), I just feel like a bachelor. I can totally see myself being in my late twenties and just starting to settle down. Which is kinda depressing, but also kinda exciting.   I would hate to be married right now, but a girlfriend would be nice. But then I have days like today and I am reminded of why I don't have a girlfriend anymore. Nobody gets me. Of course I understand that everyone feels as if no one gets them. If I ever find a girl that I can honestly say I think she gets me, I will know that I have met my soul mate.   So I drive too fast. I listen to music too loud. I drink too much. I also gave up a lucrative insurance career to save lives of people that will never know my name or how I helped them. And the pay sucks ass. Does any of that make me a bad person? I get off on adrenaline. I am an adrenaline junkie. Shit happens. I'm there to clean it up. Will I be an EMT my entire life? Probably not. But I am going to do everything I want to while I am still young and I have no responsibilities (i.e. no kids, wife, or mortgage). Maybe that way I can avoid a mid-life crisis.   Actually, I feel like I am in the middle of a quarter-life crisis. I want everything. I want to make a ton of money, again, and be in EMS. I want a girlfriend, but I don't want to be tied down. I want to be alone, but I want to be social. Whatever I am doing at the moment is not as fun as I think it would be when I am not doing it. That make any sense? If I am doing a cliff rescue, it is not as fun as it sounds when I am thinking about it while doing transports. And when I am doing transports, it is not as fun as I think it is when I am standing knee-deep in blood. Odd, us humans.   But tomorrow is a new day, and when I am busting ass moving patients and trying not to kill anyone, my thoughts tonight will bear little weight on how I act or seem tomorrow. As usual.

      Ok, so my weekend was really good. I went to McAlester Friday night, and got up at 5am Saturday morning to go fishing with my dad and nephew. We fished all day Saturday, and a little on Sunday. I then took my nephew back to Sulphur, expecting to drop him off and shoot back up to Norman to relax and maybe sleep. But oh no, that would be too easy. My brother-in-law and I went rappelling.    (rappelling, def = A descent of a vertical surface, as a cliff or wall, by sliding down a belayed rope that is passed under one thigh and over the opposite shoulder or through a device that provides friction, typically while facing the surface and performing a series of short backward leaps to control the descent.)    Yes, it is as fun as it sounds. Jumping off of a perfectly good cliff. I love it! But, I was tired as hell, and after we made a couple of runs, I was ready to go home. So I went back to my sisters and ate dinner, and then drove ANOTHER hour to Norman. Then I went to bed at 10pm.   All in all good weekend. Maybe next weekend I won't do anything that is physically challenging and sit around with my girlfriend and take it easy. Oh, that's right, I don't have a girlfriend and I am addicted to doing stupid shit to save other peoples lives! No rest for the wicked!!!

      I really like Kanye West. A lot. I liked him before he was famous. As in, he produced a lot of my favorite songs, many off on Jay-Z's final record, "The Black Album". So when I bought his album I was way impressed. But, as you listen to any new album, you can tell which songs are singles, and which will never make it to light on either radio or MTV.   "Jesus Walks" was one of those songs. Here are some lyrics:  So here go my single dog radio needs this They say you can rap about anything except for Jesus That means guns, sex, lies, video tapes But if I talk about God my record won't get played Huh? Well let this take away from my spins Which will probably take away from my ends Then I hope this take away from my sins And bring the day that I'm dreaming about Next time I'm in the club everybody screaming out  So the kid has some talent. And I just saw the video for this song on MTV 2. So I was wrong for the first time in my life about what songs on an album could make it on TV or radio.  So if you have not already heard the album Collge Dropout, either buy it or download it. Some of the themes are redundant (yes, you dropped out of college and are now rich) but the rest of the cd is great.

      Ok, actually kinda paraphrased from the movie Super Troopers  "Am I saying meow? Do I look like a cat to ya, boy? Do you see me jumping all nimbly bimbly from tree to tree? Am I drinking milk from a saucer? Do you see me eating mice! You shut up right meow. Now I'm going to have to right you a ticket. No buts meow. It's the law."

      Everyone have a great weekend. I am off to McAlester to go fishing with my nephew and father ALL weekend. We've got the boat out, now it's time to go play. I will be back on Sunday night with a weekend update, and I will leave you with a quote of the week.

      Let me get a few things straight. I am a very safe person. Do I drink and drive, do drugs, drive like an idiot? No.   Now that's that off of my chest, have you ever been drinking, wanted to post about one thing, and got off on another topic by being selfish? No? Ok, then stay put because that is what is about to happen.   So about 4 weeks ago I started dating this girl I work with. She is 21 (I'm 24) and she had just started wrapping up her Paramedic certification (the highest you can get in my field). So, she was smart and dedicated. And pretty. Which is very rare in my field. Usually the women in EMS are butch. Not always, but usually.   So, after the first day we work together, I ask her out. We have a great date the next Saturday, Mamasita's for dinner and Shrek II for a movie (her pick). Then, the next Tuesday we hang out and start the holding hands stuff. We already had our first kiss on the date. So the next Thursday we have a movie night, in which I try to show her the delicate humor of Super Troopers. Much hand holding, snuggling, and kissing ensued. At this point I am asking myself what the hell is going on, because I am generally known as a heartless bastard, and I really like this girl. So, she leaves town for a week to go to church camp to work as a counselor. We don't speak for a week (she wasn't allowed to have her phone). The following Sunday, we talk. She informs me she has to leave a week early for her vacation to Boston, or North Carolina or something. So I ask if we can pick up where we left off when she gets back. She says of course, sounds great.  So the next day, I get a text message (TM) saying that we needed to talk. Then a TM saying that we shouldn't go out any more because she was seeing someone. I then replied, weren't we both seeing other people? She said yes, we were, but one got serious. It was apparently some guy from the church camp. It's hard to compete with God. A week later, on the 4th, I get a TM saying that she hopes I have a good fourth, and that she will call me when she gets back!  What kind of shit is that? Either date me or not. You are always replaceable. Not only do I require girls I date to understand that, but I always remind myself of that fact. I am replaceable.  I assume she either did get serious and got bored of that, or was never serious and was wanting to spare me the humiliation of what may happen at the beach. Either way, I appreciate her being frank, although when I was on the phone with her she was too chickenshit to say anything.   Regardless, it reminded me of why I don't trust anyone. Especially after the ex-girlfriend I just broke up with last year. I guess this was a good reminder of why me and relationships don't go well together. I am a very no-nonsense guy, and relationships are full of nonsense and games.  My question for you is, should I go back out with her on my terms when she invariably comes back, or should I be scorned and never talk to her again???  I am inclined to believe that I should go back out with her and be aware of what could happen and be proactive, rather than be a bitter asshole. What do you guys think?

      Hark, what light breaks through yonder cloud?  Ah, it's the guy from Cox, who although is a very ugly man, happens to look quite beautiful right now. That is because he carries with him the secrets to unlocking cable TV and internet from those little black cables they carry. And he has my modem. Very nice.   GUESS WHAT BITCHES??? I just hooked up the internet in my house again! Yea yah! So from now on it can get back to the usual post a day habit I have been feigning for ever since May. So buckle up. With a presidential election, EMS class starting again very soon, and all the women I've been meeting lately (probably because I've had to go do stuff w/o the internet), it is going to be a very busy blog.   Right now I am off to Murray County to pee in a cup. Yea, I have to take a piss test. Fortunately, I am very disease and drug free, so I have nothing to worry about. Now can those things detect mass quantities of Shiner Bock?....  I'll update when I get back, and I can promise that now.

      I tied one on last night. So if I spoke to you at any point during the evening, I apologize. I doubt I made much sense. Applebees waitress, sorry you called after I passed out. Call again. I still owe you a lapdance. Girls from Champions, holla at your boy. I lost your numbers.  So last night was awesome. I went out with some of my "older" friends. We went to Pearls, but apparently the one here in Norman is closed. I don't know if they are remodeling or something, but there was no one there last night. So instead, we shot over to Applebees for dinner and of course, drinking. After many huge ass Shiners, we went over to Champions. That was pretty fun, but I couldn't get us a pool table. No one would play me. Not that I'm that great, but I guess when I approached looking for a table, that scared the other players off.  We had a few pitchers there, then everyone went home. Not me. I went somewhere else. Then I went home.  The plan for today? Not sure. Supposed to do Swirls at the Mont. My girl  urlLink Lauren  can't go because she is working today, so we'll have to see how hung-over everyone else is. And it rained here this morning. So if we went, we would have to sit inside. We'll see. And I'm sure that I'll wind up at Bill's tonight to hang out with the guys. I may also go purchase new music. Jamie Cullum is sounding pretty good.

      Yea, it was that great of a day. Actually, it was just really busy, I was in the little van (by myself), and I didn't get to eat lunch. Or breakfast. I missed breakfast mostly because I stayed in bed as late as possible, since I stayed out too late last night. I ran up to Bill's for a few hours and hung out with the boys and drank some dark beer.  Friday I worked at Murray County EMS. That was fun and exciting as always. Saturday we went to the lake with the kids (my 2 nieces and 2 nephews). That too was fun, although I burned my back pretty bad. Which makes work real fun. "Ok maam, just reach around and hug my shoulders while I pick you up. Then, after I pass out, walk over to the stretcher." It hurts. Sunday, I played golf with my brother-in-law for the better part of the morning/afternoon. It takes us a very long time to play. And drink. Kinda like walking and drinking. Actually, a lot of walking, some cart driving, and drinking. Good times.  Today was hellish, but at least tomorrow I will be in a stretcher van, with a partner. Although my partner will be Rachel. Yea, same girl I used to date. It just so happens that on the days we work together, all the radio plays is girl leaving guy songs. Super comfortable. It is better than it was though. We are both making an attempt to be adult, and so far it is working. Until I snap.  Regardless, I am eagerly anticipating this week. 3 more days of work at ETC, then 2 days at Murray County EMS. Then one day to rest before I start over. When in the fuck did I grow up?
