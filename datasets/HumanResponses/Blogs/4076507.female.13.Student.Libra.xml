Then i went out the front to see what my sister was doing .     She was sitting on her back but she couldnt go on her on so i decidedd to push her off ! So she was going along the street and i forgot to go beside her and she fell of onto the road against the kurb and her bike fel on top of her!!

        hey again everybody! hehe      well here it goes again...     well 2day i was woke up by my sister sophie the smallest 1! she kept saying forestside in my ear !     But i just told her to go away cause i was tired bt thn i found out we were ;leaving in 15 mins so i had 2 rush and get ready! only got 2 c half of the tweenies this morning!!      so we went to get somegeneral suplies for the family who had taken my brother on holiday with them ! But we were only away for a little while cause i had to be at hannahs at 12.oo ands it was already 12.15 !      So i arrived at hannahs at 12:39 just a wee bit late! hehe.     We did the usual :                                  Trampoline                                  Msn                                   Music                                                 Spill watermelon all over hannahs floor and she gets shouted at !                                                 (*opps sorry jill! )                                              Shower         So then we went round to Hannah Stothers house to watch disney movies !       There was 4 of us Me and 3 hannahs lol! Stothers Mckimm and Preece lol!      We decided to watch jungle book . So Hannah Mckimm tried to put it on and it wouldn't rewind ! So we thought it was broken and she had been trying to fix it for ages and it turned out it had already been at the start lol!!! So it started  and then we realised it was the film n not the cartoon version lol! So we watched Pocohontis instead ! (i have no idea how 2 spell it lol! ) .      So it was really good and we eat doritos ,sensations and banana and toffe popcorn ! It was great! Laura g and Nicky missed out!! lol! Half way  through the movie i noticed a light go on in the house next door and a very attractive guy looking out the window ! He just stood there! I thought he was praying or something ! So i said to Hannah Stothers and she said o no thats the bathroom and that would be him peeing lol! !  So we all laughed for ages and then i asked his name ! ( which i cant state as he mite b embarased if anyone new lol!) bt i found out I know him! Isnt that hilarious!!       So i got home from Hannahs house and my brother was home!! It was soo exciting!I couldnt believe it! I hadn't seen him in 3 weeks in spain! It was really good to see him home again! He was looking lovely his hair looked really blonde and his tan was gorgeous!       So i talked to him for a while and then he gave me a preaasant ! he said he didnt know what to get me! So i opened it and it was Ushers album Confessions ! its really really good!!       So thats what i did today lol! not very exciting ! So i wouldnt b surprised if u didnt bother to read it  lol! but if  do write in the comments cause its really fun!!  Although people are all going away so they probably wont get a chance to write either! I think im talking to myself a bit and babblin away  so i shall go!      tara folks and thanks 4 watching!

      waw this is exciting !  me n hannah tried 2 make one of these before but it didn't work. So do i tell you what i did today? okay.... mmmmm Hannah came round and we watched some disney videos with Sophie (my little sister). We were planing on going to the cinema but changed our minds !  So i had to walk and meet hannah half way and it rained a bit which was fun! because that meant i was walking in the rain! heehee  So whenever i reched half way i saw hannah across the road and then this silver car pulled up beside her and it was my mum! so we didnt have to walk all the way back to my house which was pretty cool! So we went up to put snow white on and then decided to watch it with her ! Then we watched Sleeping Beauty which is the best disney film ever ! But hannah had to go home near the end ! She left me at the scary bit ! But her mum was collecting her on her way home from work so she had to go!! :-(( Yea so once hannah went nothing exciting hapenend! So thats the end of my day!  tara folks and thanks 4 watching !
