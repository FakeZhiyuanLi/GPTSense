      Well... I stumbled into the esoteric world of blogs after reading my boss's markedly eloquent humidcedar blog... and in order to post anything, it seems one must register for one's very own blog.  So I did, specifically with the intent of replying to a Harry Potter post.  But now that I've registered... this blog thing has beckoned to me everyday, all empty and hungry for words.  I tried to say no, but it didn't work out.  So, for my first blog entry, I've decided to write about something that I have been thinking about all day.  A frustration.  I'm really quite offended by the anti-American sentiment of the Michael Moores and Hollywood limosuine liberals and the "Rosenberg press" (thank you, dr. savage)...  (And I'm also rather annoyed with the easy-target, anti-Christian intolerance that seems to have run amuck, but I'll get to that in another entry.)   The thing is, no other country in the history of the world has so quickly accumulated the wealth and power that the U.S.A. has and used it for relentless good causes.  This is something I think its own citizens have largely forgotten.  There is some driving collective urge to protest something and get angry and yell about civil liberties.  But what I think is that so many people who want to get mad simply pick the easiest targets.  Easy targets like, for example, the country that affords them their voices without cutting off their tongues.  Or like patriots who gave everything they had in the world up - while bored, whiney brats sip on ice-cold frappucinos with their chompsky readers.  Easy targets like men and like Christians and like women who stay home with their children and drive minivans.  Why is there a song written making fun of a soccer mom??  Why do so many fear and/or despise every aspect of traditional roles?  Why is a husband a predator and a wife a nag?  This annoys me, as well, because this ultra-radical, man-hating baloney undermines womanhood and motherhood, and spits on happy marriages where a husband and wife respect each other's needs.  Anyway, I think the desire to be angry about something political combined with good old-fashioned laziness has yielded this movement.  Any history buff will tell you that there were MANY times when outrage was justified and when specific regimes and their motives needed to be questioned.  But what I don't understand is why there is little outrage about certain things. Why the easiest, most worthless complaints are the loudest... instead of getting angry with the ones that evoke the most fear...  those real threats to the beloved free world.  I'm not quite sure how comfortable I am writing publicly about some of these things, so I don't think I will go any further into this tonight, until I think about it some more.  But, alas, no governing body is without some element of corruption, I won't argue that, but the truth is, Americans are very free.  Regardless of whether or not a pledge is recited or if the monotheistic God is referenced on a coin or in a federal courthouse.  It takes a first generation immigrant, I suppose, to appreciate and truly see the blessings of a free country.  To start with nothing, work hard, and obtain limitless dreams.

      i bought some hangers today.&nbsp; and tonight i'm going to brooklyn to play guitar with greg hoy.&nbsp; then ashok and i are going to see the village at midnight.&nbsp; that new m. night shyamalan movie.&nbsp; i don't start my new job until monday.   pretty cool how the jobs here are usually 9 to 5 or 9:30 to 5:30 instead of 8 to 5.&nbsp; i do like the extra sleep.   my new job is on the east side by the water.&nbsp; i could take like 2 or 3 trains to get there, but i think i will just take a shuttle/bus across the park instead.&nbsp; during those job interviews i understood what you (jenn) were talking about as far as super crowded trains go.&nbsp; but then, you could always take a bus or taxi if you're late to work or miss the train.   i'm thinking about buying some old school vintage style roller skates.&nbsp; no inline skates, yo.&nbsp; i'm talking about roller rink skates.   i must go hang up clothes now.&nbsp; tell me what you guys did today.   and your weekend plans!

      i walked in the chilly rain today.&nbsp; i did not have an umbrella. my shoes went  squish-squish...  it was as though a bucket of water were dumped on me. my pretty outfit is dripping dry on a hanger... and i am snug in a dry, batman bathrobe, with a sleeping pickle snoozing in my lap, i am warm.

      it's sunday night.&nbsp; i'm reading a book called little children, by tom perrotta.&nbsp; (he wrote election)&nbsp; i've only read a few chapters so far, while i was working out on the ellyptical machine.&nbsp; so far his take on human interactions is both realistic and cynical.&nbsp; a very easy and smooth read, it seems each chapter is presented by a different character's perspective, although it stays in 3rd person.   tomorrow i'm going to 3 interviews.&nbsp; they are all within walking distance of each other.&nbsp; i'll meet ashok for lunch, too.   pickle is transitioning to city dog pretty well.&nbsp; he hasn't bitten anyone, of course, and has done minimal barking.&nbsp; thanks to Dad for working with his barking problem on the leash!&nbsp; a couple of people still tried to pet him, regardless of his schmuzzle.&nbsp; (schmuzzle sounds so much cuter than muzzle, don't you agree?)

      Okay guys, I'm in New York.  Pickle and Draco are playing together, and Draco is sharing his hedgehog toy.  Ashok is playing a Spiderman video game on the Game Cube.  We are going to go to Noho Star for brunch.  Holly, you remember those garlic burgers...?  I'm thinking about going to see The Bourne Supremacy this weekend.  We'll see if it's good.  *shrugs*  Also, we are going to a used clothing store where Hillary Duff shops.  heh.  What are you all doing this weekend??

      Well, I'm not in the mood to blog serious stuff today.&nbsp; It was my last day at work, and I even 409'd the cubicle.&nbsp; (the extra special touches&nbsp;are&nbsp;why I make the big bucks, yo.)  I took home a box of accumulated stuff from my desk.&nbsp; It included:  1.&nbsp; a Harry Potter mousepad 2.&nbsp; an apple from yesterday 3.&nbsp; Fluffy, the 3-headed dog 4.&nbsp; pinup girl daily planner 5.&nbsp; lovely framed photo of boyfriend 6.&nbsp; Saturday Morning Cartoons CD 7.&nbsp; a clock radio that is set to mountain time  I gave my buddy, Regina, the happy perpetual motion guy.  Pickle is laying down on the floor by my feet.&nbsp; Weird, I just looked down, like a double take, and he wasn't there, anymore.&nbsp; His vet says he needs to lose weight, so he is not allowed to eat some things anymore.&nbsp; Obviously his obesity has not affected his lightening dachsund speed and canine stealth.  I'm going to go record some backup vocals and do some comp tracks tonight.&nbsp; So, I'm quite excited to get the vocals done for the record.&nbsp; We'll do a quick mix and then I can use that to book some shows until the rest of the record is finished.  &nbsp;   Any ideas for album titles?

      well, i got paid on friday, so i bought a few things this weekend.  on saturday, ashok, chris, and i hung out most of the day.  (chris goes to fordham with ashok, he lives by us now.)  we took draco and pickle for a walk and to brunch.  we sat on the patio next to a sort of 2 or 3 foot high gate thing (the restaurant rule was that doggies must stay outside of the gate thing).  pickle was very good during the walk, especially for a busy day, but we had to warn a few people not to pet him and he barked a couple of times.  then we went to a street fair in midtown for a little while, and later to an upstairs dive with a definite indie ambience for the semifinals of a sketch comedy competition. that was awesome and only 8 bucks.  today i went shopping for some things i needed/wanted.  i went to saks and got a free makeover at the lancome counter.  i purchased 3 makeup items there.  and i bought a pair of ballerina flats at a little discount shoe shop.  and i went to h&m for some short-sleeved office shirts that are not sweaters (it's pretty humid right now...)  we're going to watch the south park movie.  i heard they might remake cannibal the musical.  i don't know, would some of their lines "work" with the higher budget??  (e.g. "Niiiice hat!")  anyway, needless to say, i can't wait to see their puppets.  do you think that trey parker was cuter as orgazmo or as alferd packer?  joe young's boyish charm was nicely accentuated by his endearing use of "cupcake," but there's just nothing like a pensive traveling gold minor that sings... *sigh*

      haha thanks to brandon for that quote...  today i would like to talk about a thing in Texas that we like to call "elbow room."  i don't know how it was in iowa, chicago, or st. louis, but there's just no such thing here.  if you don't like people bumping into you and dodging folks, you probably could get quite frazzled here.  i don't really mind, though, i'm actually probably one of the people dodging and getting impatient with the slow walkers.  heh.  but anyway, inevitably you will be touched, unlike in most public places in texas (not including concerts).  there is a crowd at the stoplight, a crowd crossing the street together, crowds in a shop, packed like sardines on the subway, at the train station, etc.  at many restaurants, your table is so close to the next table that (1) it is as though you are sitting at the same table with the people next to you, (2) you will definitely hear their conversation, and (3) probably will have to squeeze your butt through a small gap between tables to get in and out.  haha.  also, often when you are meeting up with people you don't see everyday, *kiss, kiss*... interesting.  i'm used to hugz.  what idiosyncrasies did you guys note among the people in other cities in which you've resided?

       ashok and i went to a political party last night.  i met these two sisters who were really nice and funny - one is a dog trainer so I got her card from her to help with pickle and his biting.  ashok would like to see about draco's barking, as well.  the other girl likes to sing, used to be in college choir, and is as much a harry potter nut as i am!  we discussed our ideas for who the half blood prince might be.  she says hagrid.  ashok says snape.  i say godric.      umm, i've done most of the training here at work.  i'm not quite sure how to fill out the state tax sheet, since we didn't have to pay state taxes in texas.  i filled out most of the other paperwork, already.  they're supposed to get a monthly metro pass for me, but i think that takes a few weeks.  good benefits here... they even have this coffee machine with neat little packets you stick in little drawer and push a button and it makes it into hazelnut coffee in a few seconds.  there is no throwing anything away.      if i could apparate i could get home at 5:30.  instead it takes about 40 minutes, two trains, and lots of walking.      when i get home, i shall take the dogs out.  then i'll play guitar, go to the gym, and read.

      omgz, please go see harold and kumar go to white castle!!  it is sooooooo funny.  jenn, i know you would totally love it!  it's a stoner movie but instead of dumb guys, they are really smart, witty guys... you'll love them!  by the way, the village is a non-partisan post-911 story.  i can't go into detail without giving away the story, though.  hmm, i also bought my roller rink skates; they are white with pink wheels.  ashok decided to buy me a helmet which is baby blue.  he has a helmet, as well.  and they skateboard shop people say if you're just starting out, it's a very good idea.  with my skates, i bought a little set of knee pads, hand/wrist pads, and elbow pads.  we are going to go skating tonight for a little while.  then later, adult swim.  i start my new job tomorrow!  jenn, how was the shower?  holly, how was college station?
