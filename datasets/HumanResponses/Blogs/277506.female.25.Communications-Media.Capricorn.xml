      Please don't post anything here yet. I'm still working on setting everything up. I've got a friend in California that's going to be doing a design, and somebody in Washington that will be doing a cool graphic.  I'll unveil it when it's good and ready. I'm thinking a week or so. :)

      oh dear lord.    for once i'd like not to have any.  to just be a shallow and surface area anything and get lost in love with the simple face value of a smile.  a hug.  a playful slap on the ass.    sinking down to the bottom of this place in my head is getting boring.

      while my first reaction is to say that it is much better than nonfiction i hafta reconsider.  real life is so much more fun.  the shit that ACTUALLY happens... man.  all it needs is a bit of flare.  better than any made up piece of idealistic crap.  i've been watching too many romantic comedies lately, i'm sorry.

      Oh shit.  Another story.  Another exaggeration.  And somewhere, what really happened has gotten lost in the stories you've been telling me for years.  But we're friends, right?  Despite our mutual faults?  Forgive all, right?  Sorry, kiddo.  Just once, tell it to me like it is.

      hypersensitive would be a more accurate description, i think.  with how much feelings and emotions were magnified in her heart... it was unreal.    you could look in her eyes and know that she was experiencing all of you and more.    that life and eveything in it just meant so much more.

      this new beginning leaves a sour taste in the back of my throat.  my impatience to start anew fights with my fear to change and move on.    this round of the battle will end... but the conflict will linger.    we keep trying.    we all sit under the starz of twilight and stare off into the possibilities.

       "My name is Dita. I'll be your mistress tonight."   That song always makes me HOT. I was listening to  Madonna  Esther's album "Erotica" tonight, and I thought to myself that this culture is really too over-porned. There's too much porn these days and not enough  erotica .   Gloria Leonard said, "The difference between pornography and erotica is lighting." While that is true to a degree, I have to mostly disagree. Pornography is fucking and fucking alone, no plot, nothing really  sensual  about it. Whereas  erotica  ... well, all your senses are involved, there's much more suspense, and it's just a lot more  sexy.    Porn is meatloaf; erotica is  crème brûlée .

Sitting at the table, not hungry or not eating for one reason or another.  I'm too fat.  At 100 lbs. soaking wet. It was another comment Dad made ...  I'm too angry at HIM to eat... he makes me sick.  ... it's been that way for as long as I can remember.  Usually when I blog, I can barely keep my eyes open.

      to barely fly with a broken wing is better than not flying at all. to be a king without a crown, hold your head up and stand tall. to scrawl your name in wet cement, secures a smidge of immortality.

      i am barely hanging onto something that might not have even existed in the first place.&nbsp; an idea.&nbsp; a dream.&nbsp; a crazy place where the sky is always full of cotton candy clouds and the rain is sweet like sugar drops.&nbsp; a time where there is always enough time and you only rush when you want an adrenaline kick.  people smile and they mean it.&nbsp; people share because they enjoy it.&nbsp; people live because they love it.  jaded hope... it exists here.

      light as the night that seeps across the world with its laminar flow. watch the slow meditative creep of the dark curtain drawn across the sky, replacing the light with ant-light.

      when&nbsp;we touched our fingers were light but our feelings were heavy.&nbsp; the impending crack in the surfaces of our facades hanging from the ceilings like a fan spinning faster than our heads.&nbsp; the depths of our secrets knowing no maximum or minimum... blending into one swirling motion leading us deeper and deeper down the hole we created between the two of us.&nbsp; you can't imagine what i closed my eyes and saw on the insides of my eyelids.&nbsp; sparkles and shimmers of a light that one can't see.&nbsp;

       Genesis 1:3-5  Then God said, "Let there be light," and there was light. God saw how good the light was. God then separated the light from the darkness. God called the light "day," and the darkness he called "night." Thus evening came, and morning followed -- the first day.   I always wondered about this, being the nocturnal person that I am. I always seem to find all my light, all my creativity, at night in total darkness.   And after that first day, every day that followed was exactly the same. Evening always came, and morning always followed. Just what happened in the meantime is what we call "history."

      "You smoke?"  "Yep."  "Can I bum a light?"  "Of course."  Hands touch.  Spark.  Flame.  Electricity.  Silence.  "Glad it's not raining."  "Me too."

      cross your heart and hope to die.&nbsp; die of a broken heart.&nbsp; a heart so big and bloated with the juices of lust and love... beating in rhythm with the breeze and the clouds floating across the sky.&nbsp; let the words drip from your lips and i'll kiss them off of your chin.&nbsp; tasting- eating up all of the nothings you whisper and sing into the ears of every believer out there.&nbsp; every believer watching the same sun set that i just watched rise.&nbsp; i promise.&nbsp; i promise not to forget how much it feels&nbsp;not to know.&nbsp;

      clarifying omissions was never really a forte of mine.&nbsp; they were left out for reasons that, at the time, were valid enough to&nbsp; justify such an action.&nbsp; footnotes are crazed little pieces of information.&nbsp; weasling their way into things that they really should just let go of and move on from and try to rebuild some life of their own.&nbsp; it is a shame that i&nbsp; must have such negative feelings towards this little star.&nbsp;* &nbsp; *  i generally find myself among starz.&nbsp; so it's depressing to find that not all of them fit into the ideal that i have created for them.&nbsp;

      It sounds dirty, doesn't it?    "Kiss my asterisk."     "Bend over and take it in the asterisk!"    "I'm gonna kick your ASTERISK!!"    "Mmm ... check out the asterisk on  that  boy!"    Or how about, "Gambling's not for everybody, especially that guy. He just  asterisk  it all every time."     Okay, that one was lame.    /got nothin'

      Manual. Manual labor. Boy I hate manual labor. Or any kind of labor,  really. I don't want to have  child labor  that's for  sure.   Manual. ... Emmanual Lewis. Webster. Webster's Dictionary. My dad  and I tease each other about reading the dictionary, I have a much  larger vocabulary than he does.   Manual ... "Why don't you stop screwing around and read the fucking manual??" "Because reading the manual is for PUSSIES!!"   Manual ... I think of hands. I think of that annoying song about hands  that Jewel sang. "My hands they are my own, they are not yours, they  are my own ..." Shut the fuck up, Jewel, and keep your grubby little  hands to yourself.

      I like to do things manually. Like the manual transmission in my car. Eating… I can do that on my own. Breathing. Crapping. Masturbating. For these things I don't need a crazy automatic machine with a 200-pg manual all in French.

      i'd like to read the manual on manual labor.&nbsp; i wonder if there is such a thing.&nbsp; do you think they would title it "Manual Manual"?&nbsp; that's got a little bit of kink in there.&nbsp; "kink" is the noun version of kinky, for those of you who aren't cool.&nbsp; i heard that real men drive stick.&nbsp; but it just seems silly for anyone around these parts... this suburban traffic would kill a manual transmission.&nbsp; why is it that we can come to a complete conclusion about someone's personality just from their vehicle?&nbsp;

      state your insecurities loudly, daring them to show themselves.&nbsp; reveal everything hidden in the robes you wear to cover up unsightly marks left on your heart by the lessons you should have learned along the way.&nbsp; let the beauty of release take over your sullen and misgiving face- turning all that ugly into power that pulls up instead of weighs down.

      attention at the mention of my defunct pension plan. I had money in the hand but the funny band of executive monkeys grabbed my stash bag and became kings upon the strings of my golden parachute. They float away to the coast of Bombay where no extradition pact can return my life savings intact.

      since oneword seems to be out of sorts... i was thinking that i've done enough slacking and that we could do our own little version.  so even though we don't have the fancy 60 second timer... i say one of us picks a word and everybody writes a stream of consciousness response to that word.  even if you can continue on for multiple minutes... or no minutes at all.  i'm going to do it either way... if you all want in just start postin!

"Yeah, I know, but that's not it, really." "Right.  And what could you possibly be missing about that asshole?" "It's just that when things were good, they were  really  good." "Yeah, and when things were bad, which was most of the time, they were  really  bad." "You don't understand." "Try and explain." "When things were good, curling up with him -- I never felt safer than when I was in his arms.  Those scant moments of peace, of love, they were like a little slice of heaven, in our disaster of a relationship." "And he treated you like shit the rest of the time." "Yeah, but it wasn't because he hated me." "No?" "He just . . . hated himself."

"Well, generally everything runs fine.  Boot up in the morning to clear skies and a beautiful day, followed by a spectacular sunset, but lately, if it doesn't rain all day, then there's a thunderstorm in the evening, and if there's no thunderstorm, it rains all day." "Hmmm.  That's odd.  What system are you running on?" "Maryland.  DC/ Baltimore Metro." "Well, MyWeather may have been infected with Seattle and Florida virii." "Really?  But I -- " "Unfortinately, the Maryland system is permenantly affected.  We're making great strides, but your only option might be to upgrade your location to Bahamas, Southern California, or try a European System.  Good luck!" "Thanks . . . "

      upgrade. everything everywhere always needs an upgrade. scream and moan that life will be so much easier when it's all upgraded. when will the madness stop? why not downgrade for a while. remind ourselves how it used to be… remind ourselves how much better things have become… remind ourselves that we really have no reason to complain.
