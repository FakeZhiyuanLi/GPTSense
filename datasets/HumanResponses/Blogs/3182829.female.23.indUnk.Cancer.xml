      egads! It seems elmo (patron saint of nadstown) is directing viewers of her blog to come to nadstown and take a look around. So as mayor of this technological enclave, I feel it is my duty to actually give them something to read, so following is a brief synopsis of nadstown as it currently exists:  nadstown is a small town within Sydney, Australia, with a current population of one. Population growth is not predicted, however modern medicine is advancing rapidly, and thus new personalities could be detected to be residing in nadstown in the future. a university town, specialising in the communications and international studies departments, the mayor and sole resident of nadstown is eager to leave all that behind, and concentrate on economic growth in the employment field. this is taking a very long time. thus, the mayor has two part-time jobs in addition to general mayor duties, to keep her in those snazzy mayoral robes she so loves, and to keep the town's many pubs in business. on the cutlural side of things, the mayor of nadstown encourages the residents (i.e. herself) to participate in regular dance classes, as a means of keeping fit and knowing how to booty dance like a pro, should she ever need to prove herself in a dance-off with someone from a rival town (these are dangerous times people). also, nadstown is a multi-cultural, multi-lingual town, with all street signs in english and spanish, owing to the mayor's 2003 sebatical to Chile and Latin America at large, where she "saw how they're doin' it over there". there is also a mandatory public appreciation of all things polish egyptian and russian, in respect of the polish/russian/egyptian creators of nadstown - the mayor's parents. hence borscht* night at the mayor's home is an official public holiday, vodka is the town's official beverage of choice (soon to be running out of the taps in the town hall/mayor's residence), and an egyptian man named gohah** is the town's official mascot.  * a lovely russian/polish soup of beetroot and potatoes (and meat if the peasants can afford it).  **bedtime stories about gohah, the town idiot, were told to the mayor by her father in her youth.  So there is a brief insight into nadstown, for those of you who have yet to visit our shores (okay, this whole metaphor is starting to sound a bit kinky). Please visit whenever you're nearby, and be sure to let the tourist board know what can be done next time to improve your experience in our growing mini-metropolis (apart from the obvious like photos and interesting stuff in general).

      aaaaargh! i'm obviously way too uncool for this blog business. but i was complaining to my friend elmo about how i want a blog, and she commanded me to stop whingeing and start blogging.  she practically beat me. it was horrible. so now i have to prove my masculinity to her. this is somewhat difficult for a girl to do. but i am determined. oh yes. determined i am.

      is anyone else as bored of life in nadstown as i am? in fact, why are you even still here? don't you have better things to do? or at least better blogs to read, you raging web geek?  in acknowledging that this blog currently rates somewhere between doing yoga and watching big brother* on the excite-o-meter, i am asking for writing sauggestions/challenges from my readership. so both of you better come up with something, or the blog dies.  if, for some reason (like the limited levels of my own intelligence) i am unable to rise up to the challenges set, or if noone actually sets me any, this entire post will mysteriously disappear into the abyss of deleted web data. and we will never speak of it again. NEVER.  *i just can't get into yoga. i've tried really hard to like it, cause its trendy and really cool people like sally from home and away do it. but it just bores me to tears. although its still preferable to watching big brother (bot not big brother uncut).

      last night i went to the opera house to see  shades of gray , the latest offering from the wonderful sydney dance company. it is sdc artistic director graeme murphy's interpretation of oscar wilde's 1890 classic  The Picture of Dorian Gray . through contemporary dance, murphy explores the fabled character of Dorian Gray, a charismatic young man who sells his soul for eternal youth and beauty. murphy draws parallel's between wildeâ€™s original story and the contemporary world of dance, where the desire for eternal youth, beauty and perfection has particular resonance.  i have been an admirer of murphy's choreography and vision for a long time now. and he has certainly not let me down with this latest production. the show is both haunting and histerical, beautiful and disturbing. from the classical opening sequence in which petite ballerinas adorned in white tutus pirouette gracefully around their male lead, to the intense s&m style scene in which leather-clad males dance on motorised urinals to the sounds of aphex twin, i was entranced.   so, if you like contemporary dance, you want to see golum do ballet, you enjoy a good old homo-erotic dance sequence, or you now just want to find out what the bejiggidy i'm on about, i definitely recommend a trip to that great boat-like landmark by the sea.

      today i went to the australian centre of photography (acp) in paddington to see  'Three Exhibitions on the Theme of Crime and Corruption' . i was so blown away by the works of italian photo-journalist Franco Zecchin that i am already planning a trip back to the acp asap.   Zecchin's  Sicilian Chronicles   provide an insight into the mafia world far more potent than any film or television show can convey (and this comes from an avid lover of the mafia film genre). the exhibition takes the onlooker through the slums of sicily, paralleling images of poverty with those of decadent mafia society. next come a series of crime scenes, which chronicle the deaths of policemen, judges, journalists, politicians and crime bosses in palermo in the mid seventies and early eighties. there are glimpses of the funerals of two high-profile and respected judges, and also of the public fervour and criminal trials that ensued after their murders.  oooh, just writing about it has made me desperate to go back. i think however, that next time i will leave my lovely mum at home, because although betty seems to have appreciated the cultural experience, i don't know if she needs to be exposed to so many images of bullet-ridden bloody corpses a second time. i, however, cannot wait to take another look at all the carnage. what then does that say about my morbid soul?

      i don't have any skinny jeans that taper in at the calf and ankle, thus allowing me to tuck them snuggly into a pair of ugh boots. in fact, neither do i own any knee-high ugh boots.  i'm wondering whether i should kill myself for being so untrendy, or simply hibernate for the winter. your thoughts?

      last night i went to the enmore to see n.e.r.d. i really like their music, and i also love the neptunes (the production team made up of two of the boys from the band). i am also the first to admit that my motives for going were not purely aural, but that my outing can also be considered somewhat as a $75 perve. pharrell is so hot right now. and chad's not bad either.   but alas, i cannot actually say in truth that last night i actually saw n.e.r.d play at the enmore. firstly, chad was nowhere to be seen. and when questioned by the audience midway through the show as to his absence, pharrell got all huffy and said that he couldn't come because he has a wife and kids. LAME. and furthermore, the elusive third member - shay - seems to have no other purpose in the group than miming and mumbling unintelligible utterances into his mike (which i suspect was turned off).   this is not to say it wasn't an amazing show. it was. the band's songs translate brilliantly to live performance, and pharrell is a truely talented and charismatic performer who kept the energy and sensuality of the show at optimum levels. i had a great time and enjoyed the experience thoroughly.  i just think it shoud have been labelled the pharrell williams show. but maybe i'm just happy cause he took his shirt off.

      I found this way too funny to leave unblogged. However, the crux of the argument goes deeper than humour. on further investigation i discovered a radio commentator to rival mr. jones for the crown of superior archfiend.  "If you are gay or lesbian, it's a biological error that inhibits you from relating normally to the opposite sex," Dr. Schlessinger once said on her radio show, wherein she daily dispenses pop psychology to more than 20 million listeners on nearly 500 radio stations across the United States and Canada.  On her radio show recently, she said that, as an observant Orthodox Jew, homosexuality is an abomination according to Leviticus 18:22, and cannot be condoned under any circumstance.  The following response is an open letter to Dr. Laura, penned by a US resident. It's funny, as well as thought provoking.  Dear Dr. Laura:  Thank you for doing so much to educate people regarding God's Law. I have learned a great deal from your show, and try to share that knowledge with as many people as I can. When someone tries to defend the homosexual lifestyle, for example, I simply remind them that Leviticus 18:22 clearly states it to be an abomination... End of debate.  I do need some advice from you, however, regarding some other elements  1.  Leviticus 25:44 states that I may possess slaves, both male and female, provided they are purchased from neighbouring nations. A friend of mine claims that this applies to Mexicans, but not Canadians. Can you clarify? Why can't I own Canadians?  2. I would like to sell my daughter into slavery, as sanctioned in Exodus 21:7. In this day and age, what do you think would be a fair price for her?  3.  I know that I am allowed no contact with a woman while she is in her period of menstrual uncleanliness - Lev.15: 19-24. The problem is how do I tell? I have tried asking, but most women take offence.  4.  When I burn a bull on the altar as a sacrifice, I know it creates a pleasing odour for the Lord - Lev.1:9. The problem is my neighbours. They claim the odour is not pleasing to them. Should I smite them?  5. I have a neighbour who insists on working on the Sabbath. Exodus 35:2 clearly states he should be put to death. Am I morally obligated to kill him myself?  6.  A friend of mine feels that even though eating shellfish is an abomination - Lev. 11:10, it is a lesser abomination than homosexuality. I don't agree. Can you settle this? Are there 'degrees' of abomination?  7.  Lev. 21:20 states that I may not approach the altar of God if I have a defect in my sight. I have to admit that I wear reading glasses.  Does my vision have to be 20/20, or is there some wiggle room here?  8.  Most of my male friends get their hair trimmed, including the hair around their temples, even though this is expressly forbidden by Lev. 19:27. How should they die?  9.  I know from Lev. 11:6-8 that touching the skin of a dead pig makes me unclean, but may I still play football if I wear gloves?  10.  My uncle has a farm. He violates Lev.19:19 by planting two different crops in the same field, as does his wife by wearing garments made of two different kinds of thread (cotton/polyester blend). He also tends to curse and blaspheme a lot. Is it really necessary that we go to all the trouble of getting the whole town together to stone them? (Lev.24:10-16.) Couldn't we just burn them to death at a private family affair like we do with people who sleep with their in-laws? (Lev. 20:14)  I know you have studied these things extensively and thus enjoy Considerable expertise in such matters, so I am confident you can help.  Thank you again for reminding us that God's word is eternal and unchanging.

      it just occured to me that after the finale of Paradise Hotel this coming monday night, i will have NOTHING LEFT TO LIVE FOR.  for those of you that haven't experienced the wonder of this incredible television spectacle, alas, i fear it is too late to save yourselves.   the passion, the bitching, the hideous clothes and over-greased bods. who needs friends or lovers when one can experience it all from their couch every monday night?  now, anyone wanting to make comments about the obviously pathetic state of my existence can save themselves the time. i'm fully aware. but the fact remains, paradise hotel is the best thing that ever happened to me, and noone will ever take that away from me.

      my friend steely (you know who you are) has linked me to his blog. as have elmo. and estee. i feel honoured that seasoned bloggers of their calibre would take notice of little old me. and perhaps soon i will figure out how to link to them in my posts. their blogs are actually interesting and pretty and informative and all those things that nadstown fails to be.  this is the problem. i am really out of my depth here in the "blogosphere" (to quote old steely). sure, i can dazzle visitors with my supreme wit and eloquence*, but when it comes to technomological matters, i am completely out of my depth.   yet i am determined not to give up (my traditionally favoured method of coping with obstacles). if nothing else, maybe i have provided the world's authorities with a new method of torture. extreme boredom. less humane than sleep deprivation or fierce beatings, and guaranteed to break people a whole lot faster.  *please leave me as i am: content in my delusions

      this evening past I skipped class (i'm bad to the core) and instead went to a Public Forum on the Future of Indigenous Affairs. the forum was organised by one of my lecturers, and was an attempt to generate a dialogue within the Indigenous community of Sydney regarding how to respond to the disbanding of ATSIC, and what subsequent action needs to be taken. the invitation stated:   "Political machinations around the disestablishment of ATSIC by the Howard Government has caused alarm and concern for many in the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander community. The Governmentâ€™s intention to mainstream services to Indigenous communities, versus the Labor Party â€™s outline of an alternative region-based model of service provision, leaves the future of many Indigenous programs, services and funded organisations in a state of crisis.  Drawing on a range of views of Indigenous community leaders,this forum will address issues currently impacting Indigenous Affairs and scope possibilities and strategies to help shape the future of Indigenous Affairs at the national level."    the impressive board of speakers included Professor Larissa Berehndt, Director of the Jumbunna Indigenous House of Learning at UTS; Geoff Scott, CEO, ATSIS; Marcia Ella-Duncan, Chair, ATSIC (Sydney); and Rob Welsh,Chair,Metropolitan Local Aboriginal Land Council. the audience was an ecclectic mix of students, koori journalists and activists, Indigenous professionals, and UTS professors.   i feel the need to blog about it because i am concerned about the danger of this highly pertinent issue falling into the abyss of political avoidance and media disinterest.   this is a highly contentious issue, which has created a divide between politicians and also Indigenous community members. indeed, ATSIC had its failings, but it also did a lot of good in its service provision and litigation projects. ATSIC has become a political scapegoat. i agree with the consensus among tonight's speakers that it is all too easy for politicians and society to lay shallow blame on ATSIC for the federal and state governments' failings in the bygone era of Reconciliation.   and so the question begs asking: with the dissolution of ATSIC, and the federal government's preferred strategy of "mainstreaming" Indigenous Affairs, how are Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples to continue to address the current disadvantages and barriers that confront them at every level of society? And certainly, as questioned by Marcia Ella-Duncan: "Who will provide a national Indigenous voice?"

      Had an awright weekend. A boogie here, a boogie there, a boogie nearly everywhere. I saw Melbourne band Cut Copy play, which was enjoyable if not amazing (their blatant obsession with  themselves obscuring their potential greatness in my opinion). I also went to the greyhound races (go the doggies!) and marveled once again at this bizarre little sub-universe.   However, the most intriguing part of my weekend, the thing that has had me pondering a-go-go, was my meeting of possibly the biggest bitch I have ever encountered in my short but ever-so populated existence. I'm not exaggerating. I have never before in my life come across anyone as hostile as this loathsome female (without provocation, that is). She snarled, she snapped, and worst of all she condascended. I sat there incredulous, wondering what evil warlock had created such a vile stain upon humanity, as she could not possibly be born of love and/or passion.   This hideous vermin seemed to be carrying a large festering grudge against all of god's creatures. Her seething contempt for all who crossed her path was undisguised and, at times, frightening. She unabashedly flaunted her belief in her own beauty and style as being unparalleled on planet earth, wantonly snickering at every person with the audacity to walk by her. And should anyone dare stand in her spotlight, a sickly sweet chorus of "can I help you, darling?" was delivered, loaded with disdain.    Every woman has the right to be a bitch on occasion. It says so in the manual. Maybe some malevolent cretin cheated on you. Maybe you were the victim of a horrible brazilian waxing incident. Perhaps your sister ruined your (fake?) Manolos. All justifiable occasions to turn on the bitch-factor. However there is NO excuse for behaviour like that of the anorexic parasite I met on the weekend. She should be sent to some far off land where she will be force-fed lard every ten minutes, made to wear Kmart brand clothes all the live-long day, and forced to cohabit with a fat, pimple-faced web-geek named Olaf. The end.

      this is a country love song I wrote with the help of some guy named Roger Roybal (http://www.math.ucsb.edu/~roger/index.html). it is dedicated to the good fairy lala, who has flown off to japan to drink whisky and play rock music on her fiddle.   oh lala, why you done up and left me?:  I met her  in a gay bar, sort of pregnant, I can still recall the outfit that she wore; She was lookin' gawd damn sexy in her muu-muu, and I knew that she would be an easy score.  I promised her i'd change my sex forever, She said that I was meant to be a guy; But who'd have thought she'd  run off to sapporo? I watched her melt away and sobbed goodbye.

      i told a friend i'd write about love nests. a friend who desires to remain anonymous. however he/she won't be expecting the shakesperean twist (neither will he/she really appreciate it, i expect).   nadstown's 10 quasi-shakesperean tips for boys on creating their own love-chambers:  - tis no bother to live in the house of thy parents, twas the matter for romeo and juliet, and that all worked out bonnie-well.  - if thou doth be of poorly taste, employ thee a fair maiden to guard* thy quarters.  - scrub, scrub thy chamber-pot good sirs. for lo, a thousand lustig nights begin in the wash-basin.  - the fruits of desire doth in the fridge-chamber lie. here o faithful servants, aphrodesiacs must be kept tenfold.  - perfume thy sleep-chamber. how canst thou expect to expect to seduce a maiden with the scent of thy desperation alone?   - hark, what be that sound? o spritely lovers, tis the sweet sound of marvin gaye on thy stereo-eth.  - dimmable lighting doth be passion's playground. ceiling mirrors doth be passion's scorn.  - a plague on tacky posters. A PLAGUE ON TACKY POSTERS.     - hadst thou no arty possessions? they do but please young strumpets' eyes.   - porn mags are banish-ed. BANISH-ED. but lo, porn dvds are not so soon forsaken.   *its shakesperean for decorate **the bard's word for washing basket

      last night I stepped outside the nadstown square and went to see a Canadian rock band called 'death from above'. to my great surprise, i enjoyed it thoroughly, and   from now on consider myself to be all about hard rock.  despite a stroke of unprecedented good luck in finding a parking space opposite the venue of said rock gig, i was the victim of a most unfortunate act of malevolence. the spirit of an evil bimbo took over my body, forcing me to lock my keys in the car. this evil bimbo spirit has been forcing me to do a lot of stupid things lately. hmmmm.  after a brutal excorcism, i regained control of my body, and called that great cavalry of heroes, the nrma. in my best damsel-in-distress voice, i appealed to the compassion of the faceless voice on the other end of the line. "oh woe, oh woe", i cried "i am but a young girl, stranded. all alone in a sinister alleyway, in a big, bad neighbourhood." it seemed unnecessary to bother the kind operator with trifling matters of truth. she simply did not need to know that i was actually standing on a very well lit street with my lovely friend ellouise (our male companions having abandoned us in the pursuit of hedonism).  incredibly, my knight in road-safety armour arrived within 10 minutes, to save me from my "traumatic ordeal" and get rid of the two shady characters who had approached with a facade of concern, but really just wanted to sell us drugs and prove their manly grand-theft-auto skills (failing dismally on both accounts).  thanks mr. nrma. i think i love you.

      the following is an excerpt from a book by robert fulghum called  'all i really need to know i learned in kindergarten' . fulhghum believes that if people apply this list to their daily adult lives, theirs will be a balanced and happy existence, and the world will be a better place. this is the list:   - share everything.  - play fair.  - don't hit people.  - put things back where you found them.   - clean up your own mess.  - don't take things that aren't yours.  - say sorry when you hurt somebody.  - wash your hands before you eat.   - flush.  - warm cookies and cold milk are good for you.  - live a balanced life - learn some and think some and draw and paint and sing and dance and play and work every day some.  - take a nap every afternoon.  - when you go out into the world, watch out for traffic, hold hands, and stick together.  - be aware of wonder. remember the little seed in the styrofoam cup: the root goes down and the plant goes up and nobody really knows how or why, but we are all like that.  - goldfish and hamsters and white mice and even the little seed in the styrofoam cup - they all die. so do we.   - and then remember the dick-and-jane books and the first word you learned - the biggest word of all - LOOK.     indeed. i'd also like to add 'be good to your mummy', 'everyone is equal in the sandpit', and 'barbie is an unrealistic portrayal of a woman's body'.

      for reasons undisclosed i have decided that i must be married by december. i'm talking the whole shebang: barbie, ken, drunk rabbi, horny bridesmaids, corny love songs, schmaltzy photos, painful speeches, etc.    the major problem with this endeavor is a dire lack of potential husbands. yet somehow i have convinced myself that despite my perennial singledom, i will have no problems finding some poor schmuck desperate enough to pledge eternal love and commitment to me by december.    i am, however, taking a very casual approach to the "eternal love and commitment" thing. as this will be a marriage of (my) convenience, the usual emphasis placed on monogamy and intimacy will be eschewed in lieu of providing my family with something to celebrate for once.   the following is a list of those qualities i have deemed imperative for the selection of the groom:  - male  - jewish (or at least willing to tell my mother and rabbi he is - circumcision optional)  - available in december  so if you fit this description, or know someone who does, and are willing to pretend you love me for a few years (i promise to have you divorced by 2007), lets make it happen.

      as i said in a  urlLink previous entry , the job of 'my personal hero' is one that has a very high turnover rate. just when i think i've permanently filled the position, that maybe its time to withdraw the ad from the personals column, someone comes along who for one reason or another seems more qualified than the last. and so it goes.   today my hero is  urlLink ryan hreljac . a 13 year old boy from canada who has raised over $800,000 to supply clean water to the African nations of uganda, zimbabwe, kenya, malawi, tanzania and nigeria.   at the age of 6 ryan decided to raise $70 by doing extra chores, to build a well for a community in uganda after his teacher spoke to his class about how some children in the world don't have clean water. upon realisation that this amount just wouldn't cut it, ryan determined to raise the $2,000 it was estimated he would need. by the age of 9 he had single-handedly raised over $70,000, and had visited the angolo public school, uganda, the site of his first well.   ryan's mission is to supply clean water to the people of the world, and to inspire others to work hard to make the world a better place. i am truly inspired.

      no, i haven't become part of the  urlLink worldwide reflection craze  sweeping the webosphere. although i do think its tres chic, and wish i had a digital camera so i could photograph myself in the glimmering reflection of bald men's heads.  no no, this post is about my discovery of why g-d invented reflective surfaces. or rather, for whom she invented them.  last night in dance class, as we were shakin' our thangs to the sounds of the neptunes, i couldn't take my eyes of this one girl. and neither could she. in fact, i don't think she stopped pouting at herself in the mirror once for the entire duration of the class. thats a good hour and 45 minutes of intense vanity.   sure she had the body of an olsen twin (in their 'full house' days), peroxide blonde hair and an orange-hued epidermis, which i believe qualifies her as "beautiful" by today's standards*. and i'll admit that the girl sure could move, but if she inched any closer to the mirror, i think she would have entered a parallel universe.  i have therefore reached the conclusion that g-d invented mirrors so this emaciated prima-donna could ogle herself during dance classes. but she better watch out cause next week i'm going to class armed with a cheeseburger, blindfold, and a copy of carly simon's "you're so vain".    *i'm predicting future rants on this very topic.

      so i got a call from the head of leather design at louis vuitton today. she explained that the fashion house is determined to make sure that the international fervour caused by their murakami handbag range does not fade into the abyss of couture fads gone by (like the bubble skirt and tie-dye).    "but how can i help?"  i asked the nice designer lady.   "well, we'd like to patent the bags under your eyes and use them as the inspiration for our next range."  said she.  so fashionistas, look out for the  la nadstown  range of bags from louis vuitton. they're huge, purple, and worn best with chewed lips and panda eyes.

      this can be considered as my personal standing ovation (though i am neither standing nor clapping) to merlin luck. this big brother evictee turned political activist, is the current holder of the prestigious yet transient title of 'my personal hero'.  for those of you living in a bubble (or perhaps in japan) young merlin used his eviction night as a platform for staging his own protest against the abominable mandatory detention policies of the federal government. merlin retrieved a banner hidden in his tshirt stating 'FREE TH REFUGEES' (apparently the 'e' fell off), taped his mouth shut, and refused to speak for the remainder of the show. this resulted in loud jeering from the audience of imbeciles that sat before him, and also in schoolteacher-like condemnation from the show's inane host gretel killeen who labelled his silent protest as an "aggressive act".   the public can argue all they want over semantics (i.e. merlin's use of the term 'refugee') and whether or not a non-citizen has the right to political commentary. but while they are doing that, i am building a shrine to merlin (over that of my last hero), who has inspired me to drop the complacent act and get active once again. and who valiantly tried to give the makers and viewers of big stupid brother a reality check about what's really important in this world.

      the other night i was supposed to go out for a boogie, but for some unknown reason i was compelled to stay at home and catch up with my couch. i've kinda neglected him lately. and so we had a cuppa tea together and discussed who he's been sleeping with lately. its sad, but i think my couch may have a more exciting existence/sex life than i do.   at about 10.30pm, a voice spoke to me from the heavens/television and revealed what cosmic forces had kept me from leaving the house that night: " and coming up next on channel 7, buffy the vampire slayer, the film that started it all ".  i did a mental jig of glee. i thanked the gods/tv programmers for granting me this little slice of happiness in my otherwise joyless existence. and i once again felt love for the box.  because, although far inferior to the television series it spawned - the gosh darn best television series ever created, EVAR - this movie reminded me why i used to be able to spend endless hours on the couch staring at a big black box in the middle of my lounge room (and it stars luke perry. he's such a spunk rat). shows like the wonder years, degrassi, family ties, growing pains, who's the boss?, beverly hills 90210, the simpsons, party of five, melrose place, buffy, wildside, seinfeld, mad about you and other gems had me enraptured.   but what is there now? reality tv, reality tv, diy, competitions, and more reality tv. granted, i cried when paradise hotel ended (as i did when young talent time was axed in my fragile youth), but that's the end of my love affair with reality tv. honestly, there are less than 10 shows worth watching these days, most of them are current affairs and interview-based, and three of them are versions of law and order.   quite frankly i'm fed up. where have all the coming-of-age dramas gone (i'm suspicious of this O.C business)? where are the quality sitcoms? right now i'd even prefer a trashy aaron spelling concoction over another bloody series of big stupid brother.  geez, this post was meant to be about what a legend buffy mastermind joss whedon is. i guess i just can't resist a good rant.

       Lelaina:  I was really gonna be something by the age of 23.  Troy:  Honey, the only thing you have to be by the age of 23 is yourself.  Lelaina:  I donâ€™t know who that is anymore.    - Reality Bites    in less than a month now, nadstown will celebrate its 23rd anniversary of inauguration. i.e. its been almost 23 years since my mum endured the excruciating pain of childbirth for the somewhat disappointing outcome of my birth.  i am not writing to lament my fading youth, as i feel i've got at least 5 years before i divorce my wife, buy a porsche and start screwing schoolgirls. or does that just work for men?   i am simply pondering the truth of the above few lines, which have been circulating in my relentless mind for some months now.   or maybe i've just been listening to too much  cowboy junkies  music. it tends to induce pondering.  hmmm...

      i went to the police station today to inform the authorities of what happens when ignominious half-wits are permitted to drive. guarding the fort was an officer who was both charming in nature and well-formed in appearance.    sigh...   but, certainly the most appealing thing about this rogue in uniform (other than the uniform itself) was his name: constable challenger.   what a name. i half expected him to pull out a ghetto blaster and start taking his kit off. but alas, he did not.  would it be wrong to go back and request a frisking?

      when asked how she still appears young despite her difficult lifestyle, mother teresa replied:   "sometimes a good feeling from inside is worth much more than a beautician."    i'd like to take some time now to pay tribute to my beautician, suzie, who not only keeps me hair-free and tinted, but also gives me that "good feeling from inside" whenever i pay her a visit.  hailing from the faraway and mystical land of hungary, the goddess suzie is not only a master of the art of wax, but is also a truly wise and pure-hearted soul, always ready with a raunchy story, a hug, or a piece of chocolate when i need one. she turns an ordinary trip to the beautician into a spiritual experience.   sometimes special people present themselves in the most surprising of situations. even when they're ripping all the hair from your follicles.

      in the midnight oil song 'people of australia', writer and lead singer peter garrett sang:  " our continent, our home it needs wise management "  and finally a wise decision has been made in federal politics. musician, environmentalist, aboriginal activist and social justice crusader garrett has been accepted into the ALP and is set to stand for the labor-secure seat of kingsford smith at the next election. you mean we might actually hear a federal politician speaking candidly about environmental and indigenous issues? thats crazy talk.  already howard and downer are going out of their way to discredit garrett, accusing him of voting evasion, radicalism and anti-Americanism                                                                                                                                                                                                                   (obviously anyone who doesn't want to tongue kiss dubya is a radical and bad politician). they have also criticised latham of "wooing" garrett into the ALP entirely based on his anti-US stance.    urlLink peter fitzsimmons  had this pearl to say:  " if we can get people in Parliament with his kind of power and passion for australia behaving like a grown-up nation, it can only be to the good ."  indeed.

      some malevolent cretin crashed into my car last week. this has rendered me unable to do all of my usual activities such as dance classes and late night visits to friends' houses while the car gets repaired. this makes me very angry. in fact it would be fair to say that i am seething with contempt.  the low-life scum responsible seems determined to make it my problem that he can't tell the difference between a green and red light. first he gives elmo and i a nasty case of ouchies from the impact which threw us forward causing head joltage. and now he seems unwilling to supply me with key insurance details, which leaves me liable to pay the excess on repairs. if i had $400 to spare i guarantee you i could think of better ways to spend it (which i guess is why i don't have $400 to spare).   as a way of channelling my rage into creative output (on advice from my mental health professional) i have written a haiku about the incident:   this friday night past you rammed the back of my car. eat shit and die, c*#t.   aaahhh, i feel better already. poetry is so soothing for the soul.

      my friend elmo and i have had a mutual love for bette midler for some time now. i do believe ellouise has too. we pretend its not serious, but i think we all know deep down that there is no love purer than our love for the divine miss m. (we of course ignore her ill-fated sitcom and horrible middle-aged romantic comedies).  some people don't like it when they are getting a free ride in my car yet are "forced" to spend the journey listening to the soothing sounds of elmo and i singing along full-throttle to the beaches soundtrack. apparently these people think bette midler is annoying and/or uncool. to these people i say "f#@*ck you" or "get out of my car".   here is a list of why bette midler rules the world:  - her name is bette, and thats kinda like my mum's name, betty, and my mum is way cool.  - she gave us  'the wind beneath my wings' . and for that alone, i thank her.*  - she also gave us ruthless people, outrageous fortune, and big business. 80s comedy gold.  - ain't noone out there that can look me in the eye and tell me that beaches didn't touch them in their special place.  - she is of the belief that a plunging neckline is the answer to everything. here, here.  - " i married a German. every night I dress up as Poland and he invades me "  - someone out there thinks she's so darn cool that they forged her name on a  urlLink letter to president bush , slamming his stance on gay marriages, and circulated it on the web.   so go ahead, call me a loser. i don't care. i'm obviously hip. i like hip hop and rock music. i took drugs. i had a rebellious phase (as much as a middle-class, studious, easily guilt-tripped white girl can). and i also like bette. so what?  *you haven't lived until you've heard this sung in an arnold schwarzenegger voice by a full-bearded scottish comedian in a kilt. good times.

      don't you love days like today? when despite the fact that the horrible realities of war, famine and disease are plaguing half the world, the front pages of all major newspapers remind us that there are more important things than human suffering. like beauty pageants.  after perusing today's headlines, i have concluded that princess mary from tassie is like, so last month. now that jennifer hawkins, a cheerleader from newcastle has taken out the miss universe title, denmark can have mary. although i am seeing a golden opportunity for an FHM double-page spread featuring a jelly-wrestle competition between these two lovely ladies for the crown of australia's fave gal.   part of this year's pageant required the contestants to strut their stuff in the "traditional dress" of their native land. apparently jennifer tradiitonally gets about newcastle in a tight grey bodice and full skirt with what appear to be native animals crawling their way up to her rude bits. interesting interpretation.  in wanting to stay abreast of important australian current affairs issues while trapped on foreign soil, the lovely lala today emailed this question to me: "if you were in the miss universe pageant*, and you had to wear australian traditional dress, what would you wear?"  i'm pretty much thinking trackies and a vb singlet, with splashes of sequins for that touch of glamour, a stiletto-heeled pair of $2 woolies thongs, and an elaborate diamante-encrusted headpiece made out of a case of (classy) beer.     what would your traditional australian outfit be?   i'd like to thank lala for entertaining the notion, even for a second, that this would ever happen in a million years. maybe they have flying pigs in japan (where she resides).

      june 10 of this year marks the 166th anniversary of the myall creek massacre. one afternoon in the mid-1800s, 12 stockmen rode into myall creek, in northern NSW, with sinister determination. they proceeded to round up the Wirrayaraay people, who were living next to the town's station. they found 30 Wirrayaraay in total - elderly people, women and children - and herded them a short distance away from the station. when the Wirrayaraay men later returned from working on another property, they found that their elders, wives and children had been brutally massacred - 2 shot, the rest hacked to death, and all the corpses set alight.     this massacre does not stand alone in Australia's history. countless others occurred during and after invasion. some are known, some forgotten.  however the myall creek massacre is historically unique because it was the only massacre of Indigenous people in which the murderers were brought to trial for their crime. a public outcry ensued about the "absurdity" of the trial,  as it was commonly believed that although the events did indeed happen, no "crime" had actually been committed. and indeed in the first trial, all 12 men were found not guilty. however when the case was retried, 7 of the men were found guilty of murder, and were hanged for their crime (several of the others had been spared because they testified on behalf of the crown). even though the massacres continued, this was an incredible moment in Australia's history.    the massacre is symbolic of all the massacres and arbitrary killings perpetuated by settlers against Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples in the colonial and post-colonial era. subsequently the recently erected memorial statue at the site of the massacre and the now annual memorial ceremony represent future possibilities for race relations in this country. since the year 2000, descendants of both the victims and perpetrators of the massacre come together annually to memorialise the slain Wirrayaraay people in the spirit of reconciliation.    so, mr. howard, if these people, direct descendants of murderers, can stand up and say sorry for their ancestors' shame, why is it so hard for you?

      a dear friend of mine has recently found himself adrift in the single stratosphere. still confused as to how he got here, and without a safety net nor a lifejacket to keep him grounded, he often seeks guidance from myself and other esteemed members of the spinsterhood. I have granted him counsel when so requested, and am indeed tickled to continue to do so.  however during a conversation this evening, this same friend said something to me that has me all a-contemplating. "nadstown" he said, "you're the single man's crutch". Not sure whether to blush or cry, i decided to hold off on a reaction until i had done some research.   admittedly i was pretty tired, so my research was limited to looking up the definition of 'crutch' in an online dictionary. Here are some of the results:   Crutch:    A staff or support used by the physically injured or disabled as an aid in walking, usually designed to fit under the armpit and often used in pairs.    - the support bit sounds like something i'd like to be for my friends, but i'm not really all that into armpits. and if there should be two of me for maximum effectiveness, i think my single form may prove useless.    A forked leg rest on a sidesaddle.    - i like horses as much as the next girl, but when i think of riding side-saddle its usually while clinging passionately to orlando bloom as we ride off naked into the sunset. i ain't noone's leg rest, honey.   The crotch of a person or an animal.    - this notion evades witty repartee.   in analysing the information at hand which seems to identify a 'crutch' as being an object of support and assistance, i have decided that the friend in question was speaking with the best of intentions. unless he was referring to crotches, in which case i'm a little disturbed.   a final note on the topic: i often question myself about my own perennial lovelessness. "why nadstown", i say to myself, "why are you always a bridesmaid, and never, never a bride?" And now i can answer myself. "well, nadstown" i can say , "if there is any chnace that men see you as an armpit-smelling disbility aid, as a saddle piece, or as the personification of their own groins, you sure ain't going to the chapel any time soon".  i think it may be time for a change of image.

      "they" say that grief manifests in weird ways and at unexpected times. "they" are right.   on monday night i cried (some would say "blubbered like a baby") while watching:   - the big brother final   - queer eye for the straight guy   - law and order   - the news   and then i cried again at least 5 times over the next few days when explaining to people what it was about each show that made my eyes water ever so much.   and so now i'll tell you, oh blog minions, why each show brought me to tears:   -  the big brother final : ok, so i can't really explain this one. i barely&nbsp;watched the series, and had no interest in anyone except&nbsp; urlLink this boy , but i found myself crying trevor a river of joy nonetheless.&nbsp;or perhaps i was crying for gretel killeen's parents for having&nbsp;such a brainless trash-bag for a child. hmm...   -  queer eye for the straight guy : the fab 5 transformed the house, wardrobe and attitude of a widower in his 60s who had spent 3 years caring for his sick wife, and then another 3 years mourning her loss. he was so happy and grateful that he started crying, and i hate to see someone&nbsp;cry alone.   -  law and order : the story of evil insurance brokers who sold life insurance policies to jews in eastern europe in the 30s banking on never having to pay up. the&nbsp;performance of one particular actor who played a polish survivor was so believable i was reminded of my late grandfather who shared a similar history. and i cried.   -  the news :  urlLink this story  about a firefighter who died while trying to save a 2 year old boy from burning to death in his family home was too much for me to bear in my already fragile emotional space.   i think maybe i need to stop watching television.&nbsp;

      this was the&nbsp;slogan upheld by myself and my mates - keera, ellouise and alice - whilst holidaying&nbsp;in melbourne for a few days.&nbsp; if my memory serves me well, the phrase was coined by ellouise during an existential&nbsp;conversation about cookies. it quickly became our motto, used in justifying excessive eating, drinking, shopping, and&nbsp;any other&nbsp;method of consumption presented to us throughout our time in that wonderful city. i think its a keeper, and am sure i will be using it on a daily (or perhaps hourly) basis from now on.

      10 defeatist responses to  â€˜10 ways to boost your courage and get what you want out of lifeâ€™  ( nine to five  magazine, issue 808, 19.7.04, p19):  &nbsp;   holiday on your own   &nbsp;  sure, just make sure you find someone to cling on to for dear life as soon as you reach your destination. someone&nbsp;who only went&nbsp; on vacation alone for lack of anyone else willing to go with them. just like you.&nbsp; and hey, maybe they'll be just desperate enough to shag you.  &nbsp;   make the first move   &nbsp;  are you insane? and forfeit the only thing keeping you (me) going through the dismal reality that is your (my) existence? without your (my) constant companions - painful longing and self-deprecation â€“ you (i) have nothing. nothing.  &nbsp;   ask for a raise   &nbsp;  why not? the worst that can happen is you end up unemployed,&nbsp;homeless and hungry because you didnâ€™t realise that management was on to your intra-office internet porn ring and your demands for more money gave them the perfect excuse to fire your lousy arse without causing a scandal.  &nbsp;   learn to say no   &nbsp;  especially in regards to silly demands placed on you in the name of "friendship" and/or "obligation". and to all activities that may take you out of your pessimistic little cocoon and induce you into experiencing horrid feelings of happiness and enjoyment like some sort of tree-hugging hippy.  &nbsp;   get rid of a toxic friend   &nbsp;  so maybe its time to bid farewell to your dealer, but this doesn't mean you have to kick the coke habit altogether. once you're rid of the scumbag, his body decomposing peacefully at the bottom of the harbour, you can take over the business, get rich, get laid, and get killed by one of your badass cronies who wants your money and your fly&nbsp;bitch for himself.  &nbsp;   stand up for yourself   &nbsp;  unless of course you're a one-legged&nbsp;midget and have in fact been trying to do just that your entire life but people just don't take you seriously cause you keep falling into their crotches every time you try to stand up and be counted. and if you're not a one-legged midget, don't bother, noone cares what you have to say anyway.  &nbsp;   send back a bad meal   &nbsp;  as if the pimple-faced 14 year-old night manager at mcdonalds gives a f*#k that your big mac is "a litttle dry" and your chips "rather soggy". who do you think you are, royalty or something? eat your food and stop complaining. if you send it back, they'll just spit in it and serve it to you again.  &nbsp;   ask for a refund   &nbsp;  go ahead and try, but last time i checked drugs, whores and stolen firearms&nbsp;were all non-refundable. although i have heard that you can now put them on your visa.  &nbsp;   push your limits   &nbsp;  you can do anything you set your mind to. so leave the couch for more than 10 minutes today. get salt'n'vinegar chips instead of plain. watch dr. phil instead of oprah. ring a psychic rather than a phone sex operator. use your left hand instead of your right. actually, why bother trying to shake up your life? you're just going to end up fat and alone anyway.  &nbsp;   change careers   &nbsp;  great idea. we should all quit our bottomfeeder&nbsp;jobs where we aren't appreciated or respected so we&nbsp;can find new jobs in which we aren't appreciated or respected and spend all our days&nbsp;&nbsp;dreaming of machiavellian ways to murder every person in the company with better positions than us (which sadly includes the&nbsp;coffee&nbsp;chick and the guy who empties the rubbish bins once a week).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

      it was suggested to me at a recent dinner party in celebration of the birth of "the baby that stole my birthday"* that if i want to find a husband post haste i should advertise my cause in backpackers' hostels. this plan is pure genius, as these tree-hugging-hippie communes are rife with sunburnt foreigners desperate for residency in this land girt by sea.   my only concern about this strategy is that i'm sure that foreign royalty do not stay in dodgy hostels when they visit australia, and therefore my chances of snagging me a crown prince and being dubbed "our nadstown" are severely diminished.  but i don't have time to wait around for prince charming to come along, and so i will hit the youth hostel strip asap. and although the urgency of the matter requires that i lower my often unreasonably high standards (hey, its not my fault that most of the available men in this country exist within the confines of mediocrity), there are some things i can still afford to be picky about.  and so after much deliberation i have selected the top ten preferred nationalities of my future snuggle bunny/husband-of-convenience. these are (in no particular order):   argentinian: i left my heart in buenos aires. along with thousands of cute boys. and my hairbrush.  scottish: i find the scottish tongue knee-weakening.   senegalese: anyone who saw the 2002 world cup will understand why.   italian: hello, tuscan villa.   uzbekistani: it has been a long-standing ambition of mine to marry a man from uzbekistan.   really i just love saying 'uzbekistan'. try it. its fun.  brazilian: my time in rio and also my beautician have convinced me that all things brazilian are worth having.   croatian: word on the traveller street is that croatia is the new greek isles.   russian/egyptian/polish/hungarian: my cosmic twin of destiny.   icelandic: iceland is way cool, man.  hawaiian/native american/japanese: once  urlLink lala  and i met a boy of this description. he was the most boring boy that ever lived. but boy was he beautiful.   so there you have it. there are of course several other desirable ethnicities that will be taken into consideration throughout the elimination process, but the above are the most immediately appealing in my mind. i am also aware of the dismal chance of finding a uzbekistani backpacker or a jewish icelandic traveller anywhere in the world. but hey, a girl can dream can't she?  *this is my sister's godson, byron. he stole my birthday. i will forgive him one day. "they" say time heals all wounds.

      i just watched yet another movie with a happy ending in which a  person of supposedly average appearance and no social life pines away in silent anguish for a ravishingly attractive and ultra hip love muffin who they believe to be out of their league but then through some zany twist of fate the two meet and after a series of misadventures and a large crisis the apparently mediocre hero learns that beauty comes from within a push-up bra and the gorgeous one realises that the beautiful people are all sluts and schemers and that the loser they've been doing their community service with is really their one true love and they kiss and the credits roll and everyone walks out of the cinema without bothering to read the names of the key grip or ms. whoever's assistant because the only people that matter are the two stars who are in fact ken and barbie and live together in real life in a pink mansion in malibu with their dalmation called sparkles and their collection of antique toasters and have the kind of life that the rest of us will never actually have because even if we take off our prescription glasses and realise that its whats inside that counts we will still be mediocre and the objects of our desires will never want us because even though they aren't even all that girlfriend the fact is that they think they are and therefore they are not going to one day wake up and realise that they are head over heels in lust with us because we have to ask ourselves is it really love we are after or just sex and if its the latter then we might as well just go to the corner shop and buy some exfoliating gloves and save ourselves the torment of thinking about what might be with someone who will never want us and even if they did would never live up to the expectation we have created that they will complete us and suddenly our lives will be perfect and our sad will be happy and our empty will be full and our loss will be gain and we will never be lonely again which means it is love that we want after all and thats no comfort at all so i think i should either stop typing or start using punctuation...

Mike: "I wanna dance."  - Dazed and Confused   when i was 5 years old, my mother enrolled me in jazz ballet classes at the rochelle dykstra academy of dance. in my first class patron saint of the school miss shelley proclaimed me a "natural", and in my first recital i danced front stage centre to the tune of 'copacabana', resplendent in multi-coloured taffeta skirt and a headpiece of plastic fruit. a star was born.   for the next 10 years or so i danced my little heart out, dreaming of the day i would tour the world with madonna, prince and janet jackson. i would let nothing stand in my way. not the fact i could only ace every third attempt at a triple pirouette. nor the fact that i consistently failed to place first in esteddfods (nor second nor third). and not the fact that by 11 years old i had breasts big enough to launch missiles (most dancers are still waiting to hit puberty when menopause sets in.)  that was until i discovered those cursed things that ruin so many a dream: sex, drugs and rock'n'roll (or perhaps in my case boys, vodka and crash diets.) for a while i tried in vain to keep the flashdance dream alive. but turning up to rehearsals hungover and starving is not exactly the most effective way of striving for dancing glory. and so the dream died, along with several million of my brain cells.   and then a few years ago the urge to dance again overwhelmed me. i began open classes at the sydney dance company. i have since been reliving the dream, attending as many classes as time and money allow. however it seems that the more classes i take, the worse i get. admittedly, having changed styles from jazz to hip-hop, i have entered a whole new world, and i'm not sure i belong.  there are no high-kicks in hip hop. no pirouettes. and definitely no step-ball-changes. now its all pops, locks and body rolls. the standard jazz uniform of leotards, fishnets and jazz shoes is eschewed for acceptable hip-hop attire: baggy pants, trainers and trucker caps. and unless you're wearing missy elliot-endorsed brands, forget about it. and gone are the poppy tunes of madonna and prince (janet remains), replaced by the fragmented beats of missy, justin and all artists produced by the neptunes.   "they" say that practice makes perfect. i used to agree with "them". not anymore though. now i think "they're" liars. practice just takes away the illusion of perfection and replaces it with feelings of inadequacy.

      last week i went to see the  urlLink world press photo  exhibition at the state library. i encourage everyone who reads this blog to do the same, and then to tell their friends to do the same, who will in turn tell their friends to do the same, and so on until we're all part of one big exhibition-viewing daisy chain of friendship and enlightenment.  this incredible exhibition of photojournalism by the world's best has left me pondering. ever since i went, i have been disturbed by the strange reality we exist in in which one person's horrific plight on one side of the world becomes another person's act of voyeurism on the other side. i am troubled by the level of desensitisation we have achieved as a society, whereby images of human misery can hang comfortably beside shots of sport, weather and festivity in a photography exhibition. a society in which people can walk around such an exhibition sipping free beer and talking on their mobile phones in ignorant bliss.  i'm not questioning the validity of the exhibition, nor the photographers' brilliant work. it is indeed an important method of communicating to the world just what is going on in those faraway countries whose names we often can't pronounce. i'm just kind of thinking aloud. or rather thinking a-blog.  as i walked around the exhibition, i felt an army of tears forming behind my eyes. at first i resisted, ready to go into battle against a teary public shame. but soon i surrendered, deciding that if it were my picture hanging in such an exhibition, depiciting my suffering, i would hope that someone somewhere would be crying for me.

      so apparently mark latham once hit a guy, cheated on his wife and had a raunchy buck's night. this is unfortunate. unfortunate for the guy he may have hit, the woman he may have cheated on, and...well...i'm not quite sure who was hurt by the buck's night (perhaps some poor medical student who had to take a sexually exploitative job because youth allowance just wasn't enough to pay her bills.) these alleged incidents however have nothing to do with the rest of us, and certainly have no bearing on the man's ability to run this country.   perhaps if he'd sent a whole bunch of young australians to a foreign country to kill innocent people and die themselves in a ridiculous "war" in order to demonstrate his eternal love and devotion to a texan fool masquerading as the us president, then i'd question his prime-ministerial abilities.   if he consistently refused to acknowledge that the cycles of disadvantage experienced by the aboriginal and torres strait islander peoples are the direct result of bad government policies of both the past and present, and if he decided that it just wasn't a matter he could be bothered addressing any more, then i probably wouldn't vote for him.  and i imagine that if he was responsible for inflating the cost of education to such an extent that university degrees became akin to luxury consumer goods, affordable only to the upper stratum of society, then i might be forced to write bad poetry about him on public toilet walls.   hmm. i'll admit i'm still wary of latham's politics and unsure of his suitabilty for the role of pm, but does anyone else see the irony of the situation? maybe i should ask bill clinton when he finishes his book tour.

      this weekend i realised some things. they are:  - that if i want to find a husband in a hurry, i should probably expand my social horizons beyond chatting to people who work with or near me, hanging out with my family, and drinking tea with my girlfriends.   - that i want to be mary-jane watson, because not only is she the classic comic book love interest - the cherry lips, the high-pitched screams, the victim/seductress duality - but i'm thinking that spidey knows how to rock a girl's world like no mere mortal heterosexual male can.  - that despite the many painful outcomes born of human contact, there are certain gestures of kindness that can defrost one's heart and remind a person why its all worth the effort.

      as my quest for a husband begins, i have been considering those venues i must frequent in order to meet males of the marrying variety. i acknowledge that my regular haunts are certainly not conducive to finding a husband. they will however come in handy  when i'm looking for a cheap and taudry affair in later years.  forced as i have been to spend a great deal of my time in hospitals this year (as visitor mostly), one would think that i would encounter an unlimited source of gorgeous single medics hoping to take advantage of me in my most vulnerable state.   but no. the myth of the hot doctor seems to be one of the biggest farces propagated through the various mediums of popular culture in recent times. i have  found no dr. doug ross lookalikes lurking in the corridors, no dr. john carter dopplegangers lunching in the cafeterias. damn you ER for setting me up for disappointment!  and before any of you berate me for being elitist, i'm not. okay, so were i to bring home a good jewish doctor, my mother would be the happiest woman alive. but i'd be content to find a male nurse or a spunky paramedic, jewish or not, but no luck in these fields either. i know i can't really afford to be picky if i want to be hitched by new years, but come on, a girl's gotta feel some kind of spark for her fella.   i guess i'm going to have to try other avenues of husband-snagging. but am i really ready for the 'desperate and dateless' scene? no nasty comments please.

      to (undisclosed recipients),  you are hereby notified that YOU ARE BEING EVICTED from my thoughts for the following reason:  - distracting the landlady to such an extent that she can no longer function like a normal person.  please vacate the premises immediately, or the sheriff will be called in, and things will get nasty (and probably rather kinky).

      - i still wait for the boy to make the first move.  - if he ever actually makes that move, i then wait for him to call.  - if he does by some miracle call i giggle like a schoolgirl at least three times throughout the conversation.  - if he suggests an outing of some sort (i believe they're called "dates") i agonise every minute until then over what i will wear.  - if i can't decide what to wear on said date, i base my decision on whatever gives me the biggest breasts and the smallest waist.  - if there is no call, or no date, i dress like this every day until i get over him just in case i see him on the train/at the supermarket/anywhere at all. this, of course, never happens. but my cleavage does score me a few free drinks from the bartender at my local.  - if we go to dinner, i will order something small and carb-free, and then only eat half of it anyway so he thinks i'm demure and don't eat very much. just to clarify: i'm not, and i do.  - if the situation/relationship/fantasy ends abruptly at any stage, or never happens in the first place, i decide it is because my arse is too big and immediately embark on a rigorous no-carb diet and thrice daily boxercise regime.  - i begin calling all of my girlfriends each and every day and blubbering to each of them for a hours at a time about how fat and unlovable i am. when they stop answering my calls, i start calling their boyfriends instead.  - when their boyfriends change their numbers, i read  cosmo, cleo, marie claire  and  elle  from cover to cover in search of answers. i end up very confused because cosmo says i should  "stop thinking about that zero, and find me a hero",  while cleo is telling me to  "take control of my life and sms my crush after pilates class ".  - after i regain consciousness in hospital after passing out from carb-deprived starvation and boxercise overload, i feel a secret pride, as i now have something in common with mary-kate olsen.  "maybe i can sell my story to new idea",  i think to myself. however, i have noone to share my joy with because i have no friends and no boyfriend.  - when my doctor comes to check up on me, i instantly fall in love with him and feel that he has special feelings for me too. after all i am, like, soooooooooooooooooooooooo skinny now. boys love that.  - when i go home i buy 3 new pairs of shoes and a black lace push-up bra for when i see the doctor next.  - and then i wait for him to call.

      a few years ago i was asked to write some case studies for a very serious and prestigious teenage girls' magazine. this means that i made up "real life" stories that were relevant to certain articles. sorry to burst any bubbles, but those stories are indeed ficticious. i tried to spice things up a bit by giving the characters ethnically diverse names such as "ameesha" and "raghnild", however the magazine didn't think that such names complimented the images of bikini-clad skinny white girls that appropriately accompanied every article. and so "ameesha" became "tina" who blamed herself for her parents' divorce; and "raghnild" was changed to "bridget" whose boyfriend was pressuring her to have sexual intercourse with him before they were over 16 and legally married.  when i sat down to research the first case study, i made the disturbing mistake of typing the words "teenage", "girls" and "sex" into the search engine at the same time. i was promptly presented with a smorgasboard of smut from which to choose. what did i want to look at first: "lithe little lesbians", "cheerleaders' cherries" or "penny's pool party"? i must admit i was curious (i believe there's a porn-lover in all of us, just waiting to be released), but i was so worried my boss would walk by my desk and see me surfing the triple x wave that i quickly shut down my computer and then erased the internet history as soon as i turned it back on.  since that day i have been ever so careful about what i type into google when researching something at work. but today i slipped.  i am currently compiling information for articles to be written about nurses. knowing as i do - due to the birthday wishes of every ex-boyfriend to date - that nurses rate in the top ten male fantasies of all time, i should have considered that the number of nurse fetish sites on the web may even outnumber those dedicated to teenage titties. however, it seems i had a momentary mental blank, and proceeded to enter a combination of words into google that was just asking for trouble. computer shutdown. history erased once again.  will i ever learn?
