      Last night was the  BC (Birkenhead College)  ball. it was sooooooooo fun. Btw I dont go to  BC  this year, so I saw heapsa people I havent seen for ages. I realised how much  I miss everyone :(  Oh well I'll see them all there next year then I'll miss all my Ham friends. I had the  coolest  dress (that I  made myself  thankyou very much) and it was  red  and black  something century  style. Ya know? Crap, I cant explain - eh. Any way, I went to  Ashley's house  first, and we did our nails, etc..... (mine were a  bright red  - the colour of  fresh blood ) And I had my hair done at the hairdresser, and it was all flicking out to the side and stuff, and it had  red highlights  and black  feathers  in it and it was so  pretty.  I danced with  Karl,   Rohit,   Marc,   Ashley,   Astrid,  lotsa people. Mr. Willis, my old english teacher hugged me. So did Karl. And Astrid. And  Mikayla.  I must be because I'm so special.  Daniel King  had the  coolest jacket ever!  It had these studs all over it, and this  red triangle  on the back with a  skull  with a  mohawk  on it on the back. He also had a  mohawk . I got a photo with him. I cant wait for all the photos to come out!!!  Great Happiness!!!  Anyway, I'm a  fish.   Bye

      Yesterday I fell in a rockpool. Now I have a bruise on my hand, a cut on my arm, and a stupid grin on my face that shouldnt be there.  Also, mum bought me a new bible. Its pretty. Its red and gold leather and I feel like writing "gryffindor" on it, but that would make it tacky ;D  Laters!

      Yesterday, I went shopping with my lovely darling mother, and guess what? Yup, I got sum stuff. First, and least importantly, I got some new sox. Interesting ones... Theyve got pictures on them, sum of them... Very nice. Then, I got some new pants. Hooray hoorah. Theyre black (like most of my other things) and have white pinstripes down them- I think thats what theyre called... Then, I bought myself a jackety thing, which is black with three skulls overthere. I said OVER THERE. Shut up. Its also got some plaid bits and pieces here and there... yeah. Its cool as a cool thing. THEN, I got some SHOES!!!! WOOO!!!! Not just ANY shoes, but a $320 pair of shoes. Well, kind of. That was the origional price, but they were on special (what a wonderful world) at $99. Beautiful. Theyre redblack and are like lightweight combat boots. Theyre "Bunker Force" brand and they are my pride and joy. Theyve got cool as laces too. I think Im in love. Such beauty I will never see in another pair of shoes. They are the single most beautiful thing in the world. (hmm... single most, yet they are a pair, ah well) Then I went to the Youth lounge service at church which was actually quite cool. One of my friends (who I didnt actually know was my friend 'til a few mins beforehand) was singing and she was cool as a cool thing. Reuben drove me home, and I gotta call him back later on to see if he wants to do sumthin'...hmm... Its his bday on the 10th. OOOO special. Anyhoo, Mummy is going to make me some PJs, and a skoit (skirt. Shut up, Im part Irish, ok?" We could buy them, but its more fun this way. c u

      What's this 'klah' stuff that everyone keeps drinking? Klah is a spicy drink, generally served hot, possibly with milk and/or sweetening, sometimes with a splash of warming liquor. It is brewed from the bark of a native tree. The flavor is something like cinnamony chocolate, with a touch of hazelnut and coffee. It can be drunk cold, but the preferred taste is warm. Klah contains a mild stimulant like caffeine and is used as the morning drink.  M'kla at Benden Weyr on PernMUSH has come up with a delicious-sounding recipe for RL klah! Here it is:  After being honored by Jehrina at the last Benden Hatching with a mention of my (in)famous klah, I've felt compelled to post the recipe I use RL to concoct my 'secret recipe klah'. I hope ya'll enjoy it.  M'kla's Klah   1 small-size jar Folger's Extra Dark Instant Coffee   4 envelopes Swiss Miss Hot Chocolate w/o marshmallows (important!)   1 small bar of dark or semi-sweet baking chocolate, finely grated to powder   1/3 c Chocolate Ovaltine (Quick or Carnation Instant Breakfast will work)   1/4 c Hershey's Chocolate Cocoa powder   2 tbsp cinnamon (adjust to taste)   1/2 tsp nutmeg   1/8 tsp ground cloves  Mix everything, and put in an airtight, opaque container (keep it fresher). To serve, put 4 tablespoons of the mixture in a mug, and pour boiling water in. Stir until smooth, then let sit a bit to let the flavors mix. Good with cake!

      Bubbly Pies From the "Dragonlover's Guide to Pern", written by Jody Lynn Nye with Anne McCaffrey, © copyright 1989 by Bill Fawcett and associates.   Every Hold has its own special method for making bubbly pies. The traditional fruit used in this special dessert is Terran blueberries, though any berry can be substituted. This recipe makes half a dozen dessert-sized pies or a dozen hand-sized snacks.  Crust: 1/2 cup butter or margarine 2 tablespoons granulated sweetening 2 1/2 cups flour  1/2 teaspoon salt  1/2 cup ice water  Cut the butter into chunks. Combine the dry ingredients in a bowl. Work the butter gently into the dry mixture with a fork until pieces the size of peas form. Sprinkle the water over and work it in. (Do not overwork the dough.) Form the dough into a ball.  Filling: 5 cups blueberries (or one 20-ounce package, frozen) 1 cup granulated sweetening 1/4 teaspoon powdered klah bark (or cinnamon)  2 teaspoons citrus juice 1-2 tablespoons butter or margarine  Gently toss berries with sweetening and klah bark in a large bowl. Sprinkle citrus juice over mixture. Spoon berries into crust and dot with butter.   For Six Tarts: 1 crust recipe 1 filling recipe  Divide the ball of dough into two pieces. Work with one at a time. Form each into a ball and press out into a circle. Divide each circle into six. Roll each piece into a ball. Flatten to 1/8-inch, cut into 5-inch circles, and fit six into the tart pans. Fill with berry mixture. Moisten the edge of each tart and top with second circle of dough. Seal and flute the edges. Cut slits in the top of each tart with a knife. Cover edge of each tart with foil.  Bake at 375 o F for ten minutes. Remove foil. Bake for 8-12 minutes more, or until crust is golden. Serve hot.   For Twelve Gather-Pies 1 crust recipe 1 beaten egg 1/2 filling recipe  Roll out dough on a floured surface to a 1/8-inch thickness. Using a 3-inch cookie cutter, cut out 24 circles. Lay out 12 on a lightly greased cookie sheet. Divide filling among circles, spooning approximately 2-3 tablespoons into the center of each, leaving a 1/4-inch border.  Brush the border with egg. Lay the second circle on top of each pie, and press edges together with a fork all the way around. (Stretch the top crust gently to fit if necessary.) If desired, mix together 1/4 cup water with 1 1/2 tablespoons sweetening; brush top of each pie with mixture for a sugary glaze. With a knife, cut three or four short slits in the top of each pie.  Bake at 400 o F for 20-25 minutes, until crust is golden. Slide gently of cookie sheet with spatula. Serve hot.

         As he slowly proceeded down the road to Jahbud’s house, he wondered what his future would hold. The wizard rarely summoned people, and only did when he needed an errand to be run, or an important message to be delivered. Usually his quests involved danger. Why him? That was another query on his mind. Probably because his brother had successfully travelled to Chiikori Village and delivered the healing herbs to Shaalong, the villages local healer. But when he came back, he took to fever and died. It seemed so long ago, but it was only two years past.     He hesitated at the door and took a deep breath. He reached out to the rough hide that was used as Jahbud’s door flap. He nervously pulled up the flap and walked in. ‘Ahhh, you’ve come,’ Jahbud’s husky voice was soft, but clear. ‘Yes. What is my quest?’ he asked, trying to sound brave. ‘Your quest?’ Jahbud grinned. ‘Is that not why you have summoned me?’ he asked, a little confused. ‘Yes it is, Bardos, yes it is,’ Jahbud’s voice sounded a bit too thoughtful for Bardos’s liking. ‘There is a great evil. It is deep in the Land of No Returning. The evil is growing and within a decade, it will be driven over the borders of this forbidden land. If no one stops this evil, it will consume the world. You must stop this.’ ‘How can I do this? I know not where this land lies. And if this evil is as large as you say it is, no one man could stop it. I have no knowledge of magic. I ask you again, how could I do this?’ Bardos said with more distress than he intended. ‘Not every excuse under the sun and moon could keep you from your destiny. For these excuses are false. I will grant you with magic. You will have companions to accompany you and as for directions,’ he smiled with a glint of mischief in his eyes. ‘It lies to the North every full moon, to the West every new moon, to the East every half moon and every no moon, no where on Earth.’ ‘What!? Is this trickery? How can I go to a place that changes direction?’ ‘You will set out on Thursday with Blither and Grafawn. Go North.’ The wizard smiled. ‘If I ever find this pla-‘ ‘You WILL find it.’ ‘When I find this place, then, what will I do? Do I come back to you when I am done?’ ‘Bardos, my friend,’ the wizard laughed. ‘It is not called the Land of No Returning for nothing. Not the greatest magic could get someone not born of this place out from the borders. Now go.’ And with that, the old wizard turned around and left Bardos standing, open mouthed half-dazed and near fainting from exited terror.

      Lance                                                                                                   1 Feb   The girl walked in last week. She’s been staring out the window at every chance she gets. She never talks to us. When I asked her how she got that scar on her cheek, she just stared at me vacantly for a minute or two, and when I thought I couldn’t take any more, she just looked out the window again. She’s not bad or anything. She’s not dumb either. Or a simpleton. She does all her work to perfection. Finishes before everyone else too, so I know she knows English. She makes me feel… uneasy would be the best word for it. One of the other guys, Russell, targeted her when he needed another pencil, but instead of stopping him, she just let him take it. But when she needed it again, just walked over and got it again, without saying a word. When people call her name out she just gracefully turns to see them. They usually ask a question or something. Like I did. She just stares into your eyes with her ice-blue ones. Then she looks away again. Out the window or at the grass or something. It’s unnerving. I don’t talk to her anymore. I don’t much care for one-sided conversations. But I still try to get her storybook off her. Mrs Sadran tried to get us all to write about our past. Her “past” is full of demons with large claws, and sharp teeth. Mrs Sadran said it was just a misunderstanding, but she got the idea to make us all write storybooks as well as diaries. But Suriah (the girl) only writes about her “past.”  She doesn’t do much either. Always stares out at nothing. She doesn’t eat anything in public at all. She just stares. She never participates in P.E. I don’t know why the teachers let her get away with it. She always sits and stares, her ice-blue eyes moist. She seems constantly close to tears, but never sheds a single drop. Whenever anyone finishes work, they always talk about her, or stare at her. When we go back to the dorms, she’s all anyone ever talks about. I think her parents must have sent her to boarding school to get rid of her. I don’t know how anyone would stand her for so long.   Charlotte Sadran                                                                                  2 Feb  	The new girl, Suriah, has me in a bit of a puzzle. Her work is up to the highest standard, and… well, frankly, her imagination is better than anything I’ve ever seen, she’s smarter than me, as well. But, however, she hasn’t spoken a word to me since she’s been here. Or to anyone else, as far as my knowledge goes. At meal times she doesn’t eat a thing, she’s always staring into space, she’s just completely otherworldly. Like she’s just not there half the time. I would have thought she’d have fallen in love or joined one of the “friend rings”, but nothing! If she’d just talk to me, tell me what’s wrong, ANYTHING! I asked her mother about it.  “She hasn’t always been like that. Two years ago something happened, she came home covered in large slashes. Blood poured over everything, it was everywhere. I rang the ambulance, and got her wrapped in bed sheets to stop the blood. She was stitched up, and completely healed. She had enough blood, thanks to donors, and the doctors said that she would be fine. They said nothing had happened to her voice box or anything, and her silence was because of shock. I had her looked over again, and again. They said she was in perfect health. Now all she has is scars, and she still hasn’t spoken a word, she’s lost all appetite, and she doesn’t even show interest in ANY of her old hobbies. That’s why I sent her to you. I thought that she might show interest if there were other children her age with her.” That explained the huge scar on her cheek, but I still don’t know what to do with her.    Suriah  					My past:  	Seth and I left the house on 17 January 2006. It was still holidays. School would start again soon, so my Love and I took a walk through the vast forest. The leaves were fresh and green. The sky was a crisp blue, mottled with white puffs of cloud. The sweet fragrance of flowers smothered us. The day was perfect. And we had all day. 	We were comfortably nestled up against a huge kauri tree, when we heard a soft whisper. “Come. To the East, oh precious lovebirds. Come.” It was a command. We could do nothing but follow. We followed the sweet murmur without a second thought. We were unable to think of anything, we just knew we had to follow…  Charlotte Sadran                                                                                   3 Feb  	Suriah brought in an owl today. She seems fascinated by it, but wouldn’t let anyone else near it. There’s a school rule about no pets, but we might make an allowance to see if it does anything for the poor girl. I’ve seen her playing her harp to it. She’s quite the musician. But when I asked her if she’d play for the school, she didn’t answer. The owl hasn’t left her shoulder since she played to it. We may find it hard to separate them. I wish I knew what was wrong with that girl. Lance                                                                                                   3 Feb  	Suriah brought in an owl today. The teachers, to my utter amazement, did nothing. She played her harp to it. It has perched on her shoulder ever since. I think I’ll try make a perch for it in woodwork this evening. I don’t think that Mr Sharnett will mind. I hope she’ll appreciate it, but I don’t really know how she’ll react. I don’t know her at all, but I want to… I don’t know, get a reaction out of her, or SOMETHING! Get her to speak. Impress her. Make her smile, make her laugh. Make her happy… Make her …no, that’s stupid!  Suriah  	…What we found we could not believe. It scared us both witless, but also entranced us. A castle carved into the cliff, with hollows as doors. The “doors” were wide enough for fifty people to walk through with their arms outstretched, not touching. The voice beckoned us further. We could do nothing but run on. We had no more control over ourselves. The hallways were strewn with dead, reeking animals. We tried to turn back, but vines had grown over the entrance. We did not understand what could have made the vines grow so quickly, but we knew we could not get out that way. As the thick tendrils reached out to us, I screamed, but no noise came out…  Lance                                                                                               5 March  	I finished the perch. It took me so long because I’ve done carvings of birds all over it. It’s my best work I’ve ever done, but I’m glad Suriah will get it. She still hasn’t spoken a word at all. I’ll give it to her when I can get her alone. I don’t want to get rejected by her in front of everyone else.  Charlotte Sadran                                                                              5 March  	I’ve seen Lance carving up a lovely looking sculpture this past month. He’s been at it every spare moment he can get. Suriah, on the other hand, has been carving a sculpture of a boy. She wont tell me who, though that would be expected. Her stories have been odd. All about herself and someone called “Seth”. That could be who the sculpture is. But she refuses to talk about it. Or anything. Poor girl.    Martin Sharnett  	Young Lance seems to have gained a real talent for carving. And the lovely young blond with the scar seems to have a very vivid imagination

      The Dinner Party   The stony walls felt cold on her hand as she stepped gracefully down the carved staircase, being careful not to rip her silky dress. The dress was a glittery gold, covered with sequins. It was tight against her skin. She could only take ridiculously tiny steps. She was annoyed with having to walk down the hundred and seventy two steps in this itchy dress, but still managed to plaster a fake smile on her face. If not for the guests sake, then for her mothers. She had previously received a long lecture about how to act during the meeting; after all, this was her first important dinner party, now wasn’t it?  At the age of fourteen, a princess is required to be present at all dinners, meetings, royal parties and other important occasions. Sara had turned thirteen just last month. How Sara envied Shard! Her little sister, still only eight – no responsibilities!  Sara reached the bottom of the stairs – what did mother say now? Oh yes! She curtseyed, almost tripping over, but hiding it in a step. Sara looked over hopefully at her mother. The queen was biting her lip, but still nodded and jerked her head in the direction of the seat next to her. Sara glided over to her seat. A slave pulled out her chair. She stood in front of it and the slave pushed it back in again. CREAK!! Sara missed a heartbeat. Was that supposed to happen? No one seemed to have heard, so she ignored it.  The waiters brought in silver platters of fish. Once they had laid them on the table, the Queen rose and announced “Honour the God and Goddess of the sea who have brought us the fish!” She smiled, her hair sparkled with glitter – gold, to match her dress. Hers was stiffer than Sara’s. (Was she lucky?) Her dress had a golden rose sewn on each shoulder. It was an amazing dress, but Sara wouldn’t want it, she mainly wore pants and a tee-shirt or singlet top, vest – whatever, whenever she could get away with it that is.  People chatted for a while. The Queen rose again. She had a glass of red wine. “A toast to Princess Sara, Lady Zendi and Prince Brian who have just joined us for the first time. Long may they live!” The Queen raised her glass. It reflected all sorts of colours everywhere. Everyone rose. “To Princess Sara, Lady Zendi and Prince Brian! Long may they live!” Sara wondered who Lady Zendi and Prince Chad were. Sara saw every one take drink of there wine. She did too. It was bitter and made her wrinkle her nose.  To Sara’s surprise, the man sitting across from her started a hiccup frenzy. She started to giggle, but stopped short when he glared at her. He looked very fierce, that is until he almost fell over with a loud hiccup. “That’s Lord Lrad. He’s like this at most of the meetings,” said a well-aged lady sitting next to her. “Oh,” Said Sara politely. “Why don’t they kick him off the board?” “Oh, they couldn’t do that! Lrad’s friend is a guard at the Tuatara Tower. We need those connections to get medicine for our ill. I hear that they even have an alien stored in an incubator there.” “Really! Gosh! Is that good or bad?” “Well no one knows very much about it yet, apart from the inhabitants of the Tuatara Tower. The scientists say that it comes from a neighbouring galaxy!” “That’s fascinating!” “You believe me, don’t you? Lots of people just say that I have an over-active imagination, but they’re just jealous! You know that I’ve actually been in the Tower of the Eagle!” “Really?” “Yes. I also know about the Sloth Tower! Lord Lrad trained there! That’s where you go if you want to become a warrior! It’s the lowest ranked Tower, but heaps of people start off there, even if you just want to travel,” said the lady. “But why would people go there otherwise?” asked Sara. She was finally getting something interesting out of this old lady. Sara had allays loved to hear about the Towers and the outside world.  “Well, you might want to become a guard, get a job as an assassin, travel, get revenge or just learn to fight. Some people even have a part in an ongoing war. Most people have squees to accompany them…” “Squees?” asked Sara, puzzled. “Yes, they look a bit like jelly, but not transparent, but the air squee is transparent. I know of three kinds of squees. I’ve seen them pass through my village. First there is the air squee. It is a transparent blob with two eyes basically. It hovers along side it’s master or friend. Secondly, there is the holy squee. It is also a blob, but not transparent. It has wings – like angels have. Someone drew a picture of the angel from the Angel Tower for me. It’s got feathers…” “Like a bird?” “Yes. It’s pure white. It’s also got a halo, a bright shining ring, floating above its head. And third is the fire squee. It’s bright red, and it looks like a burning flame. They all have a special ability. The fire squee can create fires, the air squee can create wind and the holy squee can create light. What do you think about that!?” said the old lady proudly. “It’s amazing! Why don’t you write a book? Then everyone everywhere can read about it!” said Sara enthusiastically. She was very interested now; just hoping it was true. “Sheer laziness. If you really want, I can write you something about them. I’ll leave some room for you to add about them. I’ll give it to you at the next meeting, or if you come to my village, whichever is first.” “Thank you so much, “ said Sara gratefully and waited for the dinner to proceed.     The Library  After what she’d heard, she went to the royal library. It was a fairly big room with isles filled with books. There were large white signs with bold black writing on them. These said such things as ‘reference’, ‘fiction’, ‘non-fiction’, ‘picture’, ‘junior’ and ‘adult’. Sara walked up to the librarian. “Do you have any books on squees or the towers?” asked Sara. “I’ll see what I can find,” said the librarian. Her voice sounded bored. “Any particular squee or tower?” “No, just in general.”    The librarian disappeared into an isle. Sara sat and waited. After about ten minutes, Sara cautiously walked over to the isle. There was a pile of ash where the librarian was supposed to be. Sara’s eyes opened wide and her jaw dropped open. Then she saw it. It was like a fed flame with eyes. It looked sad. The fire squee.  “D’maj! D’maj!” Sara shrieked. “Help!” She could hear the footsteps rushing up the stairs. A young, lean man with an evil smirk fixed on his face appeared around the corner of a book shelf jammed full of books that maybe no one will ever know what was printed inside.  The pyromaniac drew out a whip. Sara stepped back in fear of it. It had small thorns all over it. He whipped the squee with great strength. The squee flinched and let out a faint squeal. It looked as though it would cry. Suddenly the bookshelves burst into flames. D’maj, the head guard burst into the library, followed by a dozen well-armed strong men.  D’maj’s eyes opened wide when he saw the squee.  “Take the princess away,” he said slowly, not letting his eyes shift from their position, on the hovering flame. “Come, my Lady of the House,” Krep, the second in command said. He pushed her out of the door and they made for the stairs.  Krep turned to two following him. “Go find the queen and princess, and get them out!” he was frantic. “Now!” he yelled when he saw them hesitating. They ran back up the stairs.  Sara lost her footing and started to fall. She felt Krep’s arm jerk her up again. At the door, she was pushed out and carried into the desert.  They ran South for a few minutes, then they turned to see if any one was following. They saw a few figures coming. “There’s a group of about four or five,” informed Krep. Sara nodded. She bit her lip to stop herself from crying.  They could see the group more clearly now. It was the queen, Shard and a guard, closely pursued by the man from the library with his squee. The queen tripped and burst into flames. “No!” screamed Sara as she saw her mother flailing on the ground in pain. It wasn’t long, but the memory would always stay clear in Sara’s mind. No matter how hard she tried, Sara would never be able to stop herself from crying.  Krep charged at the squee, sword drawn. “Don’t!” Sara yelled. “You’ll get hurt!” Krep paid no attention and in return, burnt to a crisp.  Sara’s mind still wandered back to the library. How could the squee be happy with one so evil as the man it was with now? She remembered back to the look on the squee’s face as it got whipped. It was a look of fear, pain and sorrow all put in one.  Her eyes met with the squee’s. She gave it an understanding glance. The squee returned her look. Its eyes were full of hope. It was a huge change from the look of sadness the squee expressed earlier.  Sara looked up at the man behind the squee. His eyes were full of hate. She wondered why the squee had stayed with him. His hand raised, armed with the whip. “Watch out! He’s got the whip!” Sara yelped. The man started to burn. The whip dropped from his hand as the inferno consumed him.  Desert Dreams  Sara ran to Shard and held the stunned girl in her arms. Then she turned to the squee. It looked alone and lost. Sara walked towards it. “Sara! You’ll burn! Don’t leave me,” Shard pleaded. “He won’t burn me, he is a friend,” said Sara softly, and she continued towards the lonely creature.  “I’m sorry,” the squee apologised hopefully. “I know,” said Sara, and she gave him a quick hug. “Will you come with us? We could use some help. Shard and I haven’t been outside the castle grounds before, so we’re kind of lost.” “Yes, I’ll come,” the squee replied, suddenly full of hope and happiness. This girl was true and pure. Maybe the one the old legend spoke about. It was evening, so they all lay down and drifted to sleep.  He thought back to when he had just hatched, his cave was full of squee eggs. Many had gone cold and hard. They would never hatch. The few older squees were frail and sick. The elder was slowly but surely dying. The air was stale and hard to breathe. He had studied his surroundings down to the very last detail. There was water dripping off the roof of the cave into small puddles. He could hear something big stomping around outside. The guardian dragon.  He had stayed in that very cave for around three years. He wasn’t sure exactly. Time wasn’t important then.  He grew up, listening to the tales of long ago. They learnt about right and wrong, good and evil. He learnt how to master fire. All squees started off the same. When they choose an element, they stick to it for the rest of their life. Then when they’ve mastered it, they change form and leave the cave. The elders stay there for one purpose only, to tech the young.  He had tried very hard. Only one out of seven are able to change form and he was determined to be one of these.  When he finally mastered it, he started to steam. The world was spinning. He couldn’t see anything, -just dim blurs. Then it just stopped. He fell to the ground exhausted.  An elder came up to him. “Congratulations! It brings me happiness to see another of you succeed. I must now tell you of the pure one. It has been prophesised that one with a pure heart and a true purpose will help the world change to a better place. A place of peace and happiness,” then he began to sing  “Up in the mountains, We hide all day, Down in the forest, Death will slay, War can dwell, In any field or range, But the one pure of heart, Will make a great change.  So, you see, it is important that you use your abilities for good, especially if you meet this one.” “Yes,” he said. “I will not hurt any of innocence.”  Looking back on that promise brought a tear to his eye. He had hurt a pure heart. He had harmed those of innocence. He had broken the promise to his elder whom he cared for. He had failed. Now he must make it up to Sara, whose mother he had killed and kingdom he had destroyed.  In Shard’s dreams, she was all alone. An everlasting space, stretching in all directions. Then she saw her mother’s face. She ran towards it and it faded slowly and disappeared. She called to her mother and asked her to come back, but she never did. She dropped herself onto her hands and knees and started to cry.  After what seemed forever, a mirror fell from the sky and shattered. Shard walked over to the pieces and looked into them she could see once again, her mother burning. The queen’s hand outstretched for help. Shard tried to close her eyes to avoid the image, but the image still burned through her eyelids. She started to scream. She wanted to get away. She wanted to go back to the times when she played in the courtyard with Sara. But the courtyards were gone. They burned behind her as she left. But she still had Sara. Yes beautiful, lovely, kind Sara. Sara would keep her safe. But what if that horrible flame ate her too? Then she would be alone. Sara was her only friend left in the world. The thought of losing her too was too much. She collapsed, shivering. Everything burned. Even the air that she breathed scorched her throat.  She felt as though she would die. She wanted to die. She wanted to wake up from this horrible nightmare, after all, her mother couldn’t really be dead – it was impossible! Her world had just collapsed in less than five minutes.  Sara’s dreams were full of hidden messages. She didn’t know how to work any of them out. She saw her kingdom on one side of her, and a flame on the other side. The flame moved towards the kingdom and devoured it. When the flame moved on there was a pile of charcoal. A quick breeze passed by and blew the charcoal away. A trap door was left. It swung open and revealed a room of gold coins. The coins shimmered like the sun, then they changed into food, weapons and travel needs. ‘Why would I need this? What does it mean?’ she thought to herself, not expecting an answer. The fire reappeared next to all the things, but it looked different now. It had eyes – true and just. It was the fire squee. Then it just disappeared.  Then to replace it, a flame, a leaf, a pair of wings, a drop of water, a bolt of lightning, a pitchfork, and a purple ball of energy appeared. Sara found this even more confusing than the last riddle. What was she to make of it? While she was thinking, some more images appeared. A shape like a person appeared next to each object. She could see one face out of the seven. It was familiar. It belonged to her. The flame blinked. It had eyes! Was it the fire squee!  It started to make sense. The building was her castle; it had burnt down after they got out. The room with the gold coins was the treasury and it had some how survived the fire. She was to go back and get gold from it. Then buy travel gear, food and weapons. Lady Zendi had told her that Sloth City was a fighting school. She would go there soon. Then the other images, well, she didn’t know what to make out of them. But if the flame was the fire squee, then it was possible that the other pictures symbolised other types of squee. And if she was the person beside the fire squee then the other people were people that she could meet or travel with? Maybe. Anyhow, her first step was to go back to the castle treasury.     A New Friend  Sara got up early. She roused Shard and the fire squee. Shard reluctantly got up, but seemed pleased to escape her dream. They took to walking straight away.  Shard was trailing her feet and did not talk. She tried not to think, but failed. Her sorrow was too much and if she thought about it, it could consume her. She tried to concentrate on how her feet burned, trying to take her mind off the picture of her mothers death, still so fresh in her mind. But that just reminded her of flames, and how her heart was burnt to charcoal. She looked up at Sara. She was walking with a purposeful stride, but she had a grim look on her face.  Sara caught Shard looking at her. She looked over and smiled at Shard, putting her arm lightly around her shoulders. “It’ll be okay, just you see!” Sara said, encouragingly.  The look on Sara’s face brought a little comfort to Shard, even though she knew it was fake. She looked back at the ground and continued trailing her feet in the dust. “You know,” said Sara looking pitifully at Shard. “Mother isn’t really gone for good.” “We both know that’s not true!” Shard exclaimed, but Sara picked up a hint of doubt. “She’ll live on in us. Everywhere we go, she’ll be there.” Sara smiled. “But sometimes that’s not enough for me,” Shard replied glumly. “Did Mother ever tell you about the soul stars?” Sara asked, trying to give Shard some hope and some reason to live. “Soul Stars? No?” Shard asked quizzically. “Then I’ll have to!” Sara exclaimed. “When someone dies on this world dies, they aren’t really gone. They just move. At night they watch from the sky high above. They watch over us and sometimes they help us and prevent us from getting in trouble.” “Hmmm,” Shard sounded disappointed. Knowing Shard, Sara thought, she was probably hoping for a new kind of animal or something.  After walking silently for a few minutes, they came to the top of a sand dune. They saw the burnt rubble that used to be a magnificent stone kingdom. Sara’s only home that she had ever known, and now it was gone. Sara felt a lump in her throat and her nose began to burn. She bit her tongue to stop the tears and started walking giving Shard and the fire squee a quick sideways glance. They trudged on down the sand dune towards the ruins.  As they approached the ash-pile, Shard whimpered. “You can stay where you are if you like, but I’m seeing if the treasury is still in order,” Sara said to Shard avoiding eye contact. “You’re not the only one. We can work together if you like!” said a young male voice from over a pile of ash. “Who are you? Show yourself!” Sara yelled. “Well,” said the voice as a face appeared over the ash mound, “My name is Aaron, and this,” he paused dramatically as a dirty green blob hovered up by his face. “This is my friend, Earth.” “You have a squee!” Sara exclaimed. “Yes and no,” he said grinning. “He is a squee, but you make it sound as though I own him! He just travels with me. Now, may I ask for your name?” “My name is Sara, this is Shard, my sister, and this is a fire squee, my friend,” Sara smiled. “So, do you want to dig together? I’m afraid I don’t know where anything is, because I haven’t got far, but I’ll find something eventually!” Aaron grinned again. “You’re probably looking in the wrong place. The treasury is over there,” Sara said pointing Northwards from Aaron’s hole. “And how would you know that?” Aaron asked accusingly. “I lived here.” “As a maid?” “As a princess!” Sara said, offended that she could be mistaken as a lowly maid. “A princess! I doubt that!” “It’s true!” “Okay, okay I believe you. How did this place get destroyed anyway?” Aaron asked, desperately trying to change the subject. The last thing he wanted was a fight. “Some weird guy wanted to kill us. He just appeared in the library with Fire and started burning our castle. Shard and I were the only ones that escaped. Fire killed Mother too.” Sara felt tears well up in her eyes and was unable to stop them. “Hey, don’t worry about it. But you forgave Fire? That’s very commendable. I probably wouldn’t be able to do the same thing, for that I admire you,” Aaron said soothingly, putting his arm lightly around Sara’s shoulders. Sara smiled weakly and wiped the tears away from her eyes. She got up and walked North. She remembered coming to the treasury with her Mother. It was underground and that was probably the reason why it could have survived. “Have you got a shovel?” Sara asked Aaron, who was at her shoulder. “Here,” he said handing Sara a grubby shovel. He picked up the remaining shovel and began to dig.  “So,” said Aaron, trying to strike up some conversation. “Where are you going after this” “Haven’t got a clue,” said Sara. “I’ve heard Sloth City is to the South. If I can find that place I’ll probably get some training or something and start off from there. Where are you destined to?” “I don’t know. I just go where my instinct leads me. I’ll probably head down Sloth Tower ways myself too, for supplies. Say,” Aaron said thoughtfully. “Do you want to travel with me?” “I suppose we’re going the same way, and it makes sense too. You’re on!” Sara laughed. “Great!”  After a few more sweaty hours of digging, they finally hit something. “Finally!” said Aaron, fully aware Sara was as tired as he was. They both eagerly brushed away the remaining ash and found a heavy cast iron trapdoor tightly fitted into the ground. Aaron and Sara both grabbed the handle to the door and, after several attempts, heaved it open.    The Treasury  As they opened the door, ash fell down around the sides and clouded their view. Aaron jumped down and reached up for Sara. “I’ll catch you,” he called up. Sara jumped down into Aaron’s arms. He caught her steadily, realising how light she was. “Thank you,” Sara said politely as she was released. “What did they feed you? You are so light!” Aaron exclaimed. “To match my spirit,” she sighed. “Don’t you worry! I’ll give you something to live for!” “What do you mean?” “You’ll see! Just you wait,” Aaron grinned. “What is it?” Sara asked suspiciously. “Wait and you’ll find out.” Sara sighed with frustration. “Fire, can you come and help us?” Sara called. Almost immediately the fire squee appeared in the opening and jumped down. His flame supplied enough light to see all of the gigantic room. “Wow! There must be millions in here!” Aaron exclaimed as he saw the gold stacked neatly in a glimmering wall. Aaron would have liked to take it all, but he wouldn’t have been able to carry it a metre. He ran over to a clay pot and took off the lid. He tipped precious gems all over the floor. He riffled through them with his hands and filled his belt pouch with the flawless ones. “Earth, can you bring me my sack?” Aaron called excitedly. “Sure,” said Earth, and dropped a sack beside Aaron. “Thanks,” said Aaron, looking up at his companion favourably. Then he looked over at Sara. She was staring into space. “Are you going to get some too?” he asked gently. “What? Oh, yeah,” she said and walked into a corner. She came back with a couple of rubber sacks. “They made them this way so they stretch,” she added a little bored. Aaron nodded and started to pile gold into his sack.    The Golden Gates of Sloth City  After a few days of droning through the desert, Shard spotted something on the horizon. “What’s that?” Shard asked her friends. “That,” Aaron answered, “is the Sloth Tower. And our destination.” “It’s all one tower? I doubt that!” Shard said. “No, it’s not all one tower. Sloth City is most of it.” “What is in Sloth City?” Sara asked Aaron. “Well,” Aaron said thoughtfully, “there’s the market place. The marketplace has heaps and heaps of shop filled with maps and weapons and herbs and the baker's is great! They’ve got the nicest cream buns you’ve ever tried! Then there’s the library, the casino, the hospital and the local village. In the Sloth Tower grounds there’s the training rooms mainly, oh, and the trainee’s dorms. You’ll probably want to join in a couple of courses.” “Sounds like fun!” Shard said happily.  After a few more hours of trailing along, they reached the back wall of Sloth City. It was tall and sandy, probably made of cement. “The Gates are around the other side,” Aaron explained as he turned and continued to lug his sack towards the corner.  As they came to the towering gates, Aaron raised his hand in greeting. The soldiers standing guard saluted him as they recognised him. “What is your business in Sloth City?” asked the soldier to the right in a monotone voice. “They’re with me,” said Aaron. “They’ll be getting a course or two in the Tower.” “Then you can pass.” And with that, the right soldier walked to the side of the gate where a small monitor was visible. There was also a small worn button. The soldier pushed the button. Sara heard a faint whirring noise as a flap rose and a keyboard emerged. The soldier typed something into the computer and a few lines came up on the screen in reply, but they were to small to be read at the distance that Sara was from the monitor. The man hit the button that Sara guessed was enter and the doors clanked slowly open.  Earth accompanied his friends into the familiar courtyard of Sloth City. He remembered that the two girls hadn’t been here before, but he wasn’t so sure about Fire. He remembered a fire squee enter the city with a man who looked mean and wore a twisted expression. He wasn’t sure if this fire squee was one and the same as the one hovering so close to him. He didn’t know much about either squees, but he knew the one he saw so long ago had caused uproar in the Tower. His master was apparently bossy and started a fight with one of the cooks. Together they killed about fifty people. That was a terrible thing, Aaron had told him long ago, when he was very young. It seemed like long ago. The head cook had been nervous around every squee since. “Humans were normally good people,” he remembered his elder say. “But greed can corrupt one’s mind. When that happens it rarely undoes itself. It can turn a decent person bad.” That probably was what happened to that evil man. He flinched at the thought of Aaron becoming greedy. Would he hurt innocent people? He hoped not.  Fire noticed Earth looking at him oddly, but did nothing. He wanted to start off again, and to do that he needed to not let anyone suspect him. He had done terrible things five years ago. It seemed as though it was ten years ago, but he was barely seven human years old. He didn’t know exactly how old he was in squee years, but he could estimate it was about forty-two. He would have to forget his horrible years with that creep that had done so much damage.  Aaron caught his friend staring at Fire and nudged him. “Don’t be rude,” he whispered quietly, hoping that Sara would not hear and become offended. Earth immediately looked away. Sara was so amazed at the terrible state of the crumbling mud-houses that she barely heard the comment Aaron made. “Don’t be rude,” in such a slight voice that no one outside the group would hear. Who did he think she was? She was a princess! She had never been rude in her life! For his own good, she would pretend she never heard that and she relaxed her muscles, which had tensed at his careless comment.  Shard was so engrossed in the crumbly houses, and imagining what a great place this would be to explore in, that she completely forgot her sorrows. She was looking around wide-eyed at this magnificent place and decided there and then that travelling was the life for her! She could see herself sightseeing around the whole of Shir, with Sara and making new friends, and learning about these strange creatures called ‘squees.’  She had heard of them in bedtime stories, but she didn’t actually think they could be real! This was amazing! Maybe, if she was good enough, she could get one to follow her around, like Sara had found Fire. She would have to learn to be a lot more forgiving, like Sara. Sara only had her squee because she forgave the fire squee, and saved her life at the same time. Shard found it hard to believe that Sara was nice enough to forgive Fire after he had-. Tears had welled up in her eyes again and she bit her tongue enough to keep them where they were. Stop thinking about it, she said to herself, you haven’t done anything wrong, it’s in the past now so just move on! It didn’t work. She could still smell the burning flesh, still hear the painful screams, reverberating in her skull, and she could still feel the fear that she had inside. She felt an empty hole that she was afraid would never be filled. Tears penetrated her defences, no matter how hard she tried to stop them. She looked away from Sara and stealthily swept away her tears, renewing her grip on her tongue.  “Where do we go first?” Sara asked Aaron. “Well,” Aaron started, adjusting the bag on his shoulder; “we should get you and Shard a citizenship card first. Then we’ll head into the tower to book you girls some fighting classes.” “I don’t want to fight EVER!” Shard complained, screwing up her face. “I know you don’t, but other people do. You’ll get yourself into a fight at some stage in your life, no matter how hard you try not to, and if you don’t know how to fight, they will hurt you, trash your reputation, maybe even kill you… That is why you need to defend yourself.” Aaron said solemnly looking straight into her eyes.  Shard lost feeling in the tips of her fingers, staring wide-eyed at him. She knew it was true, but she did not want to believe it. Sara squeezed her hand, and they walked on.  Sara could not stop thinking about what Aaron had told her sister. ‘You’ll get yourself into a fight at some stage in your life, no matter how hard you try not to, and if you don’t know how to fight, they will hurt you, trash your reputation, maybe even kill you…’ It was true, and she knew it. Was this world that bad? She knew that there had been wars between the towers before – she had read about them, but did everyone have to fight. She wasn’t complaining, but she had missed out on a lot of reality cooped up in that small paradise of a castle. Until lately, she had never witnessed violence. Whenever a lowly peasant was beaten, they took them out of sight, then whipped them and buried them up to their necks in sand around a cove that wasn’t visible. Sara had heard rumour that they stitched their mouths shut to prevent them from screaming for help. The victim would drown when the god of the sea pulled in the waters, then get eaten by the fishes. It was a horrible thought.  Aaron wondered if he was too hard on Shard, she was only a little girl after all. He would just keep walking. Neither of the girls were in talking mood. He hoped he hadn’t hurt their feelings. They were great people and he felt like he was supposed to be with them. It could be the beginnings of an adventure, and he loved traveling. He had been on the road ever since he was a boy, when his father had ‘misplaced’ him. At the thought of that, he felt hatred welling up inside him. He shook his head to get rid of the thought. He didn’t want to end up like Seth, his rival. He must forgive his father.  It was definite, thought Earth, Aaron was thinking about his father again. Aaron had told him about his father before. He was a cruel, evil man. He didn’t want a son, so one night he took little Aaron into the mountains. He buried him up to his neck in dirt. Then Earth had come along, and after a long talk, dug him up. Then they started their journey together. After two years he had raised enough money to get a course in Sloth Tower. He had become the youngest to ever enter, and had earned everyone’s respect. A year later, a boy the same age had joined Aaron’s classes. His name was Seth. He had become Aaron’s rival in every thing. Seth’s best skill was in archery, and Aaron’s was in sword fighting. But Seth had a strange mind. There was something odd about him. He and his friend, a darkness squee, watched them from the shadows. Earth had caught them, but never said a word. There was something greatly disturbing about Seth and Darkness. The very thought of them numbed his skin.  Citizenship Paper  Aaron led the group through the door to the sign-in office. Aaron nodded at the receptionist and put his name down in the booklet. Then he turned to the lady at the desk. “We have some new people who want some fighting lessons,” he smiled charmingly at the old lady. “Very well,” she said as she bent down to a pile of papers. “Here, Aaron, you can show them how to fill it in?” “Of course,” Aaron grinned.  Aaron sat Sara and Shard into chairs around a circular table, then seated himself down too. He gave Sara a pen and explained how to fill it in and what boxes to tick. Then Shard followed the same procession.  After about an hour, the group came out of the sign-in office. ACHOO! Darkness sneezed. Seth jumped in surprise. Then he smiled down at his little friend. Then he turned his attention back to Aaron and his group, still smiling in amusement. What he wanted to know, was who were these two girls, and what were they doing with a sour person like Aaron? These girls looked innocent, so why were they in such terrible company? Yes, Seth decided, I will approach them when Aaron is not so close to them. Then I will find out what their intentions are. A few more seconds passed as he waited silently in the shadows. Then, when Aaron and his group were around the corner, he stealthily moved across the crowded courtyard. He skipped around people haggling at stalls. He could be glad this was market day, then he could watch from nearby, and disappear when he wished. He was good at that. He would make a good assassin, is archery instructor had told him, but that was not his purpose. Why had Aaron told everyone he that that was his goal? He had automatically lost his reputation and people avoided him when ever possible. Was it Aaron’s one goal to try to ruin him? And why? He frowned. Would he ever be rid of that freak? He sincerely hoped so.

      Alfheim  	They had long been thought of as mystical creatures, that is, until I found him. From legends and myths, I thought they were small and had green pointed hats. But as I looked up into his blue, sparkling eyes, I knew those old stories were wrong. Just tales made up by humans in their mindless boredom. That was just a story. This was real. He was an elf. 	He grabbed my arm and helped me up from the cliff. I sat on the ground and peered down the cliff-side. It was definite. She was dead. Who? My best friend in the world – Karen. I sighed. The elf-man saw I was sad and stood me up gently. He put an arm around my shoulder and led me off into the forest. I was to grief stricken to notice any details. Karen would want me to enjoy this new place, so I tried to stop the depression that had taken over inside. “What is your name?” the smooth, soft voice whispered. “Lana,” I replied. “What is yours?” “Eredoi,” he answered. “That’s an odd name,” I blurted out, before I could stop myself. “For your kin, yes. But for an elf?” he took it with good humour, to my relief. “I guess not,” I sighed, trying to smile. He smiled down at me. That was when I first started to notice what he looked like. He had blond hair, perfect cheekbones, and he looked about twenty. He looked very neat and kind and very handsome. Did elves always look young, or did they age like humans? I pondered this thought for a while, as we walked along the road. 	I started to look around. The grass was the perfect green, juicy and lush. There was a river nearby. Its water was crystal clear. The sky was a clear blue. The smell of the forest was everywhere. It smelled like summer, happy and joyful. Karen would have liked it here, I thought, sadly. Then another smell was added. Fresh baking.  Then I could see houses, delicately painted a beautiful green. Eredoi led me into his own home. The inside of his house was even more beautiful than the outside. It was furnished with stone and wooden furniture. Someone had been weaving a landscape picture. It was very good, it reminded me of Karen’s house. Her parents worked as importers, so they had neat stuff from all over the world. My stomach growled, and I looked down and blushed as he turned to me. He laughed his merry laugh and I realised I didn’t need to be ashamed here. I could – for once in my life – be myself. I felt a fuzzy feeling all through my body… Acceptance. Karen always made me feel embarrassed if I cut the cheese or anything, but we still stuck together. Although I felt shaken with sudden loss, I couldn’t help but feel growing anticipation – something great was going to come of this. That made me feel guilty at the same time. Inside me was a whirlwind of emotions, and I didn’t know what to think. As Eredoi gave me a seat, I wondered – Could my eyes be deceiving me? Is it possible for such a perfect place to exist? “Eluana,” he called softly through the house. “Lana eshe.” “Fai?” a young women’s voice replied perplexed. “Enta, Lana eshe,” he answered her query. “Asha ama?” “Lana ‘a Era Katana!” his voice sounded rather triumphant. “What did you say?” I asked him, feeling a little uncomfortable. “That you are Lana of the Earth Land and that you are a friend,” he grinned down at me. Then his expression changed to worry as he added quickly “You are hungry! Let me get you some food.” 	Ederoi gave me a leaf-plate filled with appetising food. It tasted even better than it looked. I was very surprised that that was possible. 	Ederoi was watching me intently from the other side of the table, making a headrest out of his hands. 	“How did you get here?” he asked me softly, when I had finished. “I don’t know, I can remember putting a fork in the microwave…” I was puzzled. “but I don’t think that would be able to bring me here.” I made a sweeping hand gesture to indicate Alfheim. “Never underestimate the smallest things!” I jumped in surprise as this new voice came from behind me. It was the voice I had heard Eredoi talk to about me a few minutes ago. 	The elf-girl was a young, beautiful girl. Her eyes danced in amusement, and she smiled happily at me. 	“Eluana of Ela-Ishtel, Alfheim,” she introduced herself. “Lana of New Zealand, Earth,” I smiled, feeling a little stupid. 	A sudden drowsiness came over me. “She has worn herself out,” Eredoi sounded worried, but his words were soft as he carried my half-asleep body to a spare bed. Then I blacked out. 	I saw their faces in my dreams that night. “Don’t tell them of Alfheim, they won’t believe you,” their voices were soft and gentle, but the sound engulfed me. “But you are welcome back any time. Goodbye Lana of Earth Land. Until we meet again…” their voices fade slowly as they left me, back to Earth. 	I woke up in my room. I got up, and had a shower, got dressed. All the usual stuff. Then my mum came in her eyes round, as if she’d seen a ghost. “Thank goodness! You’re back! Where were you? Oh, never mind your back! Don’t you ever, EVER do that to me again!” but she didn’t sound threatening, she was shaking with tears, squeezing the breath out of me, in a hug. “How long have I been gone?” I asked cautiously. I didn’t like mum crying, and I was already winded from her “hug.”  “Two years,” she said flatly. My eyes grew wide. “We waited for you every night. We left your room like it was, hoping you would come back. Why didn’t you call me! You should know better than that!…” and so the lecture began, but I wasn’t listening, I was still bewildered at the fact I had been gone TWO WHOLE YEARS…

      She woke with a scream. The nightmare was back. Was it a vision? Maybe. She must   keep her defences up if she was to survive. Or was it just a distraction for   something… worse? Or was she taking it for granted, after all, it was just a dream. Or   was it? Yes, she would get more bodyguards. She would need them, or why would   she have this horrible dream three times a week? She could hear footsteps rushing   down the corridor that led to her golden room.  “Who’s there?” she demanded.  “Your body guard, Queen Hatshepsut,” said the voice beyond the door.  “Hmmm… Keep a full guard in all hallways, rooms, gates, entrances – everywhere.   Don’t let anyone through!” she commanded.  “Yes, Pharaoh,” said the bodyguard, obediently. Was it obediently? Would he be the   one to turn against her? Could she trust anyone ever again? Who would she trust, and   how would she know? She could hear the echo of sandled feet get weaker, as they   retreated down the hallway. No. It couldn’t be him. Her own body guard wouldn’t   betray her. Or would he? Was one of the bodyguards that protected her in secret a   rebel? A leader of a whole group? How many were there? Just one? Surely not! Not a   single fool would rise up against the Egyptian Army, and certainly not alone!   	She began to shake in fear. Her silky sheets slipped off her as she rose. She   left the bed and began to pace the room. Could it be possible? Was the entire army in   on this? Were they angry that they hadn’t sent them on any attacks to make Egypt   bigger and more beautiful  than it was? Should she send them off to fight? Or were   the real bandits waiting until the defences were weak? Should she buy them more   axes, bows, arrows and armour to please them, or would that confirm and hasten her   death? Or would they be her best… or only defence?   She was getting a headache. How would she find out what was going on, if   there was anything. If only she could see what was going on without anyone   recognising her. Then there would be the question of where she was. No. She could   not leave herself. Besides, it would be too dangerous, anyway. She would have to get   someone else to go instead. No one from the palace, of course. But who? The bandits   – or rebels, or whatever – would probably want to sneak in, rather than bombarding   in a vicious rage.   Surely they wouldn’t ship anyone in from Thebes. It would be too far and   might cause some suspicions. It would also cost too much to get them all the way to   Memphis. She decided to go down to Thebes the next day and buy a slave. A girl. A   smart and sneaky – but not too sneaky – girl.    	 There was so many problems coming in and out of her mind at the same time   that she couldn’t even stop to think about one without another one interrupting her.   Her head was throbbing with fear and confusion, but for now, she would sleep.   *	*	*  Mara, the slave girl, awoke to the whip yet again. Her shoulder throbbed. She   jumped out of bed and dressed as quickly as Horus himself could. She had a pile of   dirty linen to wash, the morning dishes and any errands her cruel master could find.  “ What do you want, master?” Mara asked him as he looked down his nose at her.  “There’s a pile of linen in your room. Are you blind? Then look at the state of the   dishes!” Yes, master,” Mara mocked. Her mockery did not go unnoticed. She was   whipped several times. Mara’s eyes shut tight and she bit her lip to stop the tears. Her   master smirked. He put his whip under his arm and left the room. He threw his head   back and let out a horrible, loud laugh.   	Well, Mara thought, I’m leaving today. It might be the last chance for   freedom.   	After her chores had been done, she walked up to her master.  “Have you any more work for me master?”  “Yes, you are to deliver his to the main priest of the Temple of Isis,” he said and   thrust a piece of paper towards Mara.  “Yes, master,” said Mara and ran off.   	She had no intention of going anywhere near the Temple of Isis. Little did her   master know, Mara could read hieroglyphics. Once far enough away from her master,   she would read the note and use it for her own personal use.   	She picked off the sealing wax with her fingernails and unfolded the paper.   She read:  Meet me behind the  Temple of Apet tonight  about  There was one hieroglyphic that she did not recognise. It was very confusing and was   set in curved boxes. She knew it would be a Pharaoh, because only Pharaohs would   have their names in curved boxes. No one would talk about the Pharaohs whom had   passed on to the Underworld, would they? So who was the Pharaoh now? Hatshepsut.   What would they want to talk about Queen Hatshepsut for? She wouldn’t want to find   out, anyway she was going to leave Thebes all together now wasn’t she?   *	*	*   	Queen Hatshepsut fanned her face on her pleasure boat. She hadn’t slept that   well, so consequently she had bags under her eyes. She was grumpy, sweaty, and was   paranoid about her death. What person would want to kill her? Person? What if it was   an animal? A sacred animal, like the hippopotamus or crocodile. They had been   known to attack boats spontaneously. Then she could not defend herself without   enraging the gods. This was too much. She would rather die with pride than be   murdered by rogues.  “Take me back to Memphis!” Queen Hatshepsut ordered.  “Yes Pharaoh,” the captain said confusedly. They turned around and went back.   *	*	*   	Mara began to think of the consequences if she got caught. No. She would run   to the temple of the priest. She was only a block away. She ran for lost time. She got   to the front gate. She rapped on the door with her knuckles. A priest answered.  “May I help you?” he asked.  “Can I see the High Priest? I have a letter from Master Sekhnatira,” Mara panted, out   of breath.  “Come in,” he said as he stood aside. He walked her down a hall to a room.  “He should be in here,” he said.  “Thank you,” Mara said. “I shall show myself out?” more a question than a statement.   The priest nodded and left.   	Mara went in and gave the priest the piece of paper.  “Tell him it has been confirmed,” said the High Priest in a monotone voice.  “Yes,” said Mara, and ran most of the way back to her horrid master.   *	*	*   	Later that night, behind the Temple of Apet, the High Priest stood, heavily   robed, for it was cold out.  “Priest Kanut?” a voice asked from the shadows.  “Aye,” he answered.  “Good, you’re here. I must get straight to the point. You know my brother,   Tutankhet? Good. He was appointed Queen Hatshepsut's bodyguard. On a recent visit,   he told me the Queen wakes up screaming at night. She has ordered her security to be   even stricter! I am truly worried. Queen Hatshepsut has been a good, fair Pharaoh, but   she’s going crazy! Please, ask the Gods to return her to sanity! Otherwise the Nile   might not flood and we could have a drought! I have no power over what the Pharaoh   thinks or does.  You could, on the other hand ask the Gods to help her. Will you do   this for Egypt?” Sekhnatira pleaded.  “Tomorrow I will make an offering to Isis in Hatshepsut’s name, this I promise. I   don’t know what the outcome will be though.”  “Thank you! Thank you! This is a great favour to Egypt,” he said gratefully. “I will   soon return to Memphis. I will talk to you again when I come back.”  “Aye, send a message for when and where first,” the priest said as he waved and   walked back to the Temple of Isis.   *	*	*   	They were too late to rescue Queen Hatshepsut. Her body lay lifeless on the   floor with a dagger to her heart. Tutankhet bowing by her side, trying hard not to let a   tear drop. He was devastated. He blamed himself for not keeping a closer watch on   her. He would have a bad reputation everywhere, not that it mattered. She would be in   her tomb and Tutankhet would be entombed with her. Then he could cry. Not where   anyone else could see. His whole life seemed to stop. It was like time froze, like the   water in the Nile would dry up completely, like he would be blamed for Hatshepsut’s   death as he certainly was going to be. This night would go down in scrolls, and people   would tell of it for years to come. If only he had caught a glimpse of the evil people   who had done this. If only Pharaoh had told him what, and who she had dreamed of   those nights. If only the story could have been written differently – He could have   died, rather than the Pharaoh. If only, if only, if only!   *	*	*   	That night a new star was born. The star of Hatshepsut smiled down on the   world, focusing its sight on Egypt, on her palace in Memphis, and on her people. She   could now watch over her city.   	She saw Tutankhet grieving over her body.   “Don’t worry, my dear Tutankhet, I died by my own hand, you have no more purpose,   no murder shall take place now, I died with pride, and so will you,” she whispered to   him. But he couldn’t hear her, after all, he was only mortal.   *	*	*   Years have passed and years are still to come, but Hatshepsut watches over her   city as a goddess. She will remain there shining in the sky, watching over the people –   her people, her Egypt.
