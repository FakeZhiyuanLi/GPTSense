      真爱在于我和你... ‡™VåÑ3zÃ ™‡    A girl asked a guy if he thought she was pretty, he said..no. She asked him if he would want to be with her forever..and he said no. She then asked him if she were to leave would he cry? and once again he replied with a no. She had heard enough. As she walked away, tears streaming down her face the boy grabbed her arm and said... Your not pretty, your beautiful, i dont want to be with you forever, i NEED to be with you forever, and i wouldnt cry if you walked away...i'd die... send this to everyone on your list........isnt that sweet?i like u because of who u r to me.u r a true friend, if i don't get this back i'll take a hint. send this to all of ur friends, if u get it back then u have a true friend [ |ov3 |sµ å|wå¥s |Ñ ã|® .....
