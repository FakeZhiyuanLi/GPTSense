      I dunno what's going on with me or my life right now! I am fighting with everyone I care about. I don't know but it always seems to be my fault. Everyone in my family has given up on me,but my aunt.I overheard she and my mother talking I just found out my mom was going to ship me off to reform school,but my aunt told my mom she would take me and raise me. She says she can help me with my temper and to ease the pain that has been inflicted on me throughout the years. Maybe that is why I am fighting with everyone because now I know they all abandoned me,everyone but my aunt and Shanna. Hope all you guys that read my post never have to feel the pain of knowing your family could give a damn about you and I never ever want you to feel what it feels like to be rejected by your own mother. I don't know what hurts more knowing that she rejects me or the fact that she gave own on me, just like my father did!! Either way it hurts and it jsut pushes me father away. The doctors they ask me why I cut couldn't imagine could you?? Anyways I miss Shanna alot. I called her today because I needed to hear her voice and I wanted to tell her I LOVED HER, but instead I caused us to fight. I know she must be getting sick of me and me being stupid but I can't help. I dunno what to do anymore, I don't want her to be with me because all I am doing is causing her pain and she is beautiful and smart, and funny she deserves so much than a screwed up little kid that causes her pain. She has to be crazy to want to be with me. I LOEV HER though. I guess that is it. I am tired and I just want to go lay in my bed and cry.

      I have been moving to indiana. So i can be closer to my babygurl. I LOVE YOU Anyways I have been looking for a job, getting enrolled in school, and working at my aunt's job until I can fine a steady one, taking care of my couisn he is 11, and trying to keep the house upkept so as you can see i have been busy. i wished  i could have goen to pride with me babygurl but my mom said no but she and I are for sure going next year. YAY well I am finally happy not fully bc shanna and I are still apart but mostly happy. Everyday i have a smile on my face for no reason I love being inlove with a beautiful woman that loves me just the way I am. IF you are single find a beauitful,sexy, smart, funny, caring woman like i got and you will always be happy. I know i am. i couldn't be happier with shanna. Oh my godda i think i am going to marry her and that scares me and excites me. It scares me because i see so many couples break up and get divorced. It excites me because i am so inlove and i love her so much and i knwo that we can make it as long as we have each other. well i need to get Hayden dressed that is my cousin we need to go to town and get food for dinner tonight. I LOVE YOU SWEETHEART

      I wish I could ease your pain. Make it less hard on you. I wished I could make your mother see I will never hurt you. I wished sometimes I could just fade away into my darkness and just never come out. I am sorry your mom is disapponited in you. I am sorry for everything. Shanna I love you but I can see you in pain it kills me because I know it is because of me and I don't want to cause you pain or hurt you. I just wanted you to be happy. Being with me will cause you nothing but pain you seeing that now. It won't get better with time. You will be heartbroken because you father will not walk you down the aisle on your wedding day and I can't be the reason your heart gets broken. I just can't shanna.

      My girlfriend is in so much pain right now. There is nothing I can do to help her. I think maybe because I am part of the problem. She told her mom about her being bi and her mom didn't take it so well. I wished I could jsut take her pain away. Sometimes I think it would be easier if we never met. That way she could be happy her mom wouldn't say hurtful things to her and she wouldn't be in pain. I just want to run away and never come back

      You ever have one of them days? You know the kind I am talking about when everything you do isn't good enough for anyone and there is always someone who can make sure you don't forget your a fuck up right. Well that was my day and that someone is my sister. My day started off ok. I went to work I did my job. Then my coworker didn't do her job and clocked out before anyone checked her area so guess what I had to do my fucking job and hers. Then I came home and my loving fucking sister was her. We got into and she told me I shouldn't give a damn about shanna because she was going to leave me just like my father did and jsut like Katy did. Thanks Summer I am always glad when you fuck my day up.Way to go!! I don't know what I would do without you to fuck up all my happiness. Can u see i am HAPPY with Shanna. Ryan and I will never be together. IT doesn't matter what you say though because you never understood me and u never will because you don't see who I am you just see what you want to. In the words of MELISSA ETHRIDGE WHO GIVES A DAMN WHAT THEY SAY WHAT DO THEY KNOW ABOUT THIS LOVE ANYWAY. SO all you who want to fuck with my happiness practice safe sex and screw yourselves.

      In the twilight of the heavens I see your  face.  Lying in your palm I see my heart beating in  your gentle embrace.  I wach you speak, your lips the color of  pale, blushing roses.  I watch quietly; unnoticed; your  expressions, your poses.  I watch the wind dance softly through your  hair,  My hands long and yearn to dance tenderly  there.  I watch your hand absently graze your cheek.  Come to me, let me take you from your world  so bleak.  Let me share with you the beauty of a  sunrise,  Let me be privileged to see the heavens in  your eyes.  When you're ready, let me show you I adore you  so much.  Grant me the blessing to take in the scent  of your skin.  Permit me to show you where, and how, love  can begin.  I implore you, allow me to open to you my  heart, with trust;  Be gentle, in its fragileness; it may  crumble to dust.  Immerse me in the benevolence of your arms,  to be wrapped within,  And, when you're absolutely sure, allow me to  explore the continent of your skin.  I want to know you, and you to know me,  inside and out,  So there is no room left for doubt.  Let me show you the beauty of a soul,  Because to love you, is my most important  goal.  I Love you and I am sorry about last night.

      this weekend was so great!!! I finaly got to see my babygurl Shanna. *kisses* I LOVE YOU SWEETHEAR!!!! Anyways she and her friends MAl and LAuren came with her. They are cool girls. I like them. I was so happy to see her, when I first saw her my heart just jumped, it started beating real fast I thought it was going to bust out of my chest. I forgot to tell her I get car sick if I am not driving or in the front seat. Even being in the front seat makes me a little sick, so the ride to the hotel was mostly quiet,except for mal and lauren fighting and playing around. We finaly got to the hotel and we were  chillen on the beds in the cool because it's hot as hell out here. Then Mal and lauren were shotting off fireworks, Shanna and I stayed inside and were kissing and just talking. My girlfriend has the softest, most beautiful lips in the world. OMG I couldn't stop kissing her.Her lips are the kind of lips I love not too big but big enough that after you're done kissing you kinda nibble on them. They are so soft too. I loved kissing her I can't wait to do it again. And her eyes OMG again when I looked into them I just got lost like I couldn't turn away from them, like I was just trapped in her gaze it was so great. I rubbed her cheek and face with my fingertips and hands she has the softest skin, like silk to touch. I was looking at her one time during the night and she asked what's wrong there was nothing wrong I just wanted to make sure all of that moment of just being together would stay in my mind for the rest of my life. Everytime she got close to me, I don't know if she knows this or not, but I would breath her scent in so I could remember just the way she smelled. She also doesn't know I stole the pillowcase from the hotel pillow, the one she slept most of the night on so that I could always smell her. Every touch, smell, kiss is locked in my memory from now on. I remember just the way her kisses tasted, I remember every little goosebump and chill. This was the best time of my life and it is even more special because I spent it with the girl that I want and if everthing works out right will spend the rest of my life with!!! being with her this weekend made me see how truly blessed I am to have her in my life. Spending this weekend with her brought us so much closer and it help me see that she is the only one I want and will ever need in my life. I told her she has changed my life  for the better and she truly has changed my life and me. She is important to me, she has become my life, my everything and I love her more and more each day. i guess that is it for now. OH you thought I was going to give you all the sexy, horny details didn't you??? Sorry that is for us to know and for you to wonder about lol I LOVE YOU SHANNA

         I am going through alot of stuff right now!! I hate myself and I just want to fly away. I sit on my rooftop looking at the stars and silently I pray God will wisk me away with the wind. I feel like shit I jsut recently found out I scared Shanna when we were together! I feel really bad for scaring her. Is ent her an e-mail telling her how I feel about steve!! That should&nbsp; go over well, so she will either tell me to fuck off or tell me it's none of my business either way I don't care as long as she doesn't leave me for me telling her how I feel about things. I am so proud of myself I haven't smoked in 4 days. I want to stop smoking because when Shanna and I have kids I don't want them to be around smoke like I was. I said when Shanna and I have kids after the e-mail I sent&nbsp;her about steve I don't even know if she want to talk to me let alone be with me.&nbsp; I am so tired I cleaned the whole house today! I don't feel good I haven't felt good since the day befoer yesterday! I think I might breakdown and finally go to the doctor, but he is going to tell me I am fine besides be stressed. School will be starting soon I am excited about that. I am ready to make friends,&nbsp;and get to know the people around here!!! I bet I get some strange looks the first day all my rainbow stuff Shanna got me * Thank you Sweetheart* and all my piercings. I don't care thought they will either like me or not so I am not&nbsp;worried about it!! I am listening to Switchfoot *Thanks again for the cd sweetheart* I always listen to it when I am getting tired it makes me thank of my babygurl and I go to sleep happy!!! God I love her so much.&nbsp;I don't want to lose her!! I know in my heart she still loves steve otherwise she wouldn't let him treat her the way he does!! I hated the first time I talked to him and i tried to get along with him for her, but I hate him more now and I want to slap him upside the head for leaving my babygurl in a dark park by herself why he "watched" people smoke pot!! I hate the way he treats her and uses her and she jsut lets him get away it. It really pisses me off because I knwo if I treated half as bad as&nbsp; he does she would&nbsp;have&nbsp;&nbsp; nothing to do with me, and when I say this to her she says "oh but he is my friend," some great friend he is leaving you in a dark park by yourself!!! I guess that is it because it's almost midnight and I need to do other things. I LOVE YOU SHANNA&nbsp; I REALLY DO LOVE YOU

        It seems like no matter what I do I will always lose. Shanna and I have been fighting. we both said sorry so I hope everything is okay. We promised today that niether one of us would drink anymore!! So I am happy about that. I have had a shitty day ever since I got off the phone with my mom. I found out today she may have cancer. *cries* I CAN'T LOSE HER SHE IS THE ONLY FAMILY I HAVE.  I kow don't know what I will do if I lose her!! If I lsoe her there is no reason for me to live anymore, but Shanna and our non-existening children, but the way we ahve been fighting latley and me causing her stress and confusion she may not want me for too much longer. It kills me you know I may be losing my mom and all I can think about is how unfair it would be for her to die and not see my graduate. Do u think I could anymore selfish?? Shanna and I told our problems out, but the fact she says I cause stress and confusion in her life still borthers me alot and hurts. I am sorry I keep jumping form one thing to the next but this is how my thought process works. I am worried sick about my mother. I won't know for sure if she has cancer until wed. which sucks because I am spoiled and I want to know right now!!! All I kee thinking about is how much of a bitch I have been to her grwoing up and I don't understand how she could still love me after all the shit I have said and done to her*cries* I am sorry mom I really am I never wanted to hurt you. Shanna I jsut want to hide in the comfort of your arms and Iw ant you to tell me I am not going to lose my mom. I need someone to old me right now.I feel like I am cry until I die or I am going to hurt myself real bad!! I juat want to be with my mom and have shanna beside me. I am try to be strong for Shanna but right now I just want to be the weak one and have her hold me while I cry. I CAN"T LOSE MY MOM I CAN"T
