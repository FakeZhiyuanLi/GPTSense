      it's an unexplanable feeling a sort of waited longing describing is difficult it seems to show you what this it  i see it everytime you are near a candle burning bright that's all i can explain to you what it really means  look into the mirror to see myself an unfamiliar reflection  stares back at me in disbelief cant stop what has begun  chorus feelings feelings it's a feeling unexplanable feelings feelings hides more that we believe feelings feelings we have to trust  there's so much in the moonlight hidden behind the clouds it takes more than patience to understand it all  in the vast big ocean of blue hides the deepest wisdom it takes more than time to truly understand  chorus feelings feelings it's a feeling unexplanable feelings feelings hides more that we believe feelings feelings we have to trust  bridge wisdom time patience  it's not enough to make the feeling show for these dont relate to what im feeling at all  the feeling runs deep into the roots no amount of patience or time can anyone truly understand unless you believe

      how does one define love is it the water in the ocean or the sand in the desert  how does one measure love is it by the litre or by the weighing scale  chorus love is a queer little thing it's like a happiness machine when you've got it you laugh and joke when you've lost it you cry and weep  how does one love love is it the amount of care or is it the amount of trust  how does one find love is it through the internet is it from the morning post  chorus love is a queer little thing it's like a happiness machine when you've got it you laugh and joke when you've lost it you cry and weep  no one can give me the answer this leaves me to wonder what is love.
