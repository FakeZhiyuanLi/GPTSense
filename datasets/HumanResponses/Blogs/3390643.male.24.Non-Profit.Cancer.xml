      At the top of Peak Three in Anchorage, AK for a second day. The 2 hour hike is definitely worth this view and the ride down isn't bad either.

      Nathan, Elena, Michael, and Scott at Eagle Rock, Alyeska Resort. We decided not to hike any further past this point. There were some major avalanches coming off the surrounding mountains due to the drastic temperature change. It was good enough for us though. We put our gear on and had a sick ride down. We surprised some lift maintenance guys on the way, they didn't know what to think about 4 people out of nowhere riding down the mountain. It was damn funny. We made it back to Scott's mountain side condo without getting caught and were stoked from the sweet ride.

      Alyeska decided the resort would be closed for the weekend, we decided other wise. We gathered our gear and hiked up on another blue bird day in the 60's. The best part was there wasn't another person on the whole mountain.

      We went out to run around with some friends on the Turnagain Arm in Anchorage, AK. The sun was setting just behind the mountain Sleeping Lady. It was about 10 o'clock when this was shot.

      No party is complete with out a cow, a cow boy, a porn star and his producer. At Jeremy's (the cowboy) birthday party at his place down in Girdwood, AK. We all wonder how the hell Jeremy got this place, its way nice, with a sick view of Alyeska.

      This was one of those epic days of riding at Alyeska. Sunny and warm. Well warm at least for the beginning of march in Alaska. This is a shot from near the top of Alyeska looking down into the Girdwood valley. You can also see the Turnagain Arm, which has the second highest tides in the world, up to a 38-foot change in water level.

      We Finally got to go camping for the first time this season! Elena, Scott, Jake, Copper (Scott's dog) and I hiked the 'Hand Tram' trail in Girdwood, AK. We had a great night of shooting photos, enjoying the wilderness and best of all just relaxing around the fire. It was a nice and clear night, but we woke up to rain falling on the tent. I just wanted to sleep all day. It was the first time in a while I could just sleep and not have anything to do. We hiked back out and drove to Scott's house in Girdwood. After we dried off we went over to the Bake shop and Java Haus for coffee and pancakes. A great way to end a weekend.

      After a week of deciding where we should go hiking for our last long weekend in Alaska, we decided on Caines Head trail in Seward, Alaska. Elena, Jeremy, Andrew, Austin and I made it to the trail head at about 7pm, 3 hours later then we wanted. Canies Head is mainly a costal trail, so it can only be hiked at low or near low tide. Low tide was at 4:30pm. We went for it any ways. After about three miles of hiking we were stuck. Fortunately we were at a beach and a great spot to setup camp. We chilled for a bit and then decided we should hike up this creek that was flowing out of the forest through the beach. About 2 minutes up the creek we found one of the biggest water falls I have seen up here. We were amazed at our luck of ending up at this beach.

      We woke up to another beautiful day. We just chilled on the beach drinking coffee and eating breakfast for few hours in the sun. It was great! We thought it would be sweet hike up to the top of the water fall we found the day before. So we hiked up the creek again. We started climbing up the right side of the water fall. A little ways up we found out this was going to be harder then we first thought. The ground was really unstable and most of the rocks just broke away when you grab on to them, but of course we keep going. We all made it up safely. At the top there was a moss covered forest and a great view of the ocean. We hiked over to the top of the water fall and hung out for a while right at the edge. Then the hard part came, some how we had to get down. So we went for it. It wasn't easy but we made back safely. Then we packed up camp. Elena and I went on down the coast, the rest of the guys had to get back to Anchorage. On our hike down the coast we found yet another awesome water fall. A couple miles later we made it to what we hoped to be our stopping point, North Beach, but it was packed with tents. So we decided to hike an additional 2.5 miles to South Beach. After 2 exhausting miles we found a short trail that lead to an over look of the ocean. We found out this was one hell of an over look, it was the top of 300+ foot cliff. Later we arrived at south beach to find only one other person camped out. We setup camp, cooked dinner on the fire and then crashed for the night.

      We woke up to a down poor this morning. We were not looking forward to the 7+ mile hike back to the trail head. The worst part was my stove stopped working so we couldn't make any coffee. After about an hour of trying to fix the stove I gave up. Exhausted and already wet, we packed up camp and started on the hike back. By this time the rain had died down a bit so it wasn't to bad. The first mile and a half were all up hill which took us only about 45 minutes to hike. We hiked another mile and a half to Derby cover, where we would have to wait 2+ hours until the tide was low enough. Thanks to our good luck we walked out to the beach right when a water taxi was dropping off some kayakers. So we hopped on and got a ride with them. They were damn nice and gave us a two for one deal. It cost us $30 to get back to Seward. To add to our great luck the taxi's dock was right by the trail head and Elena's truck. We hiked up to the truck changed into some dry clothes and then took off back to Anchorage. We were both extremely exhausted, but like always it was a great adventure.

      We went out for a nice day trip on the Sound with Elena's Dad, my Dad and step Mom. We didn't get much wind but it was still fun to get out and sail.

      A few of us went out to Kinciad park to hang out on the beach and play some music. It was a warm day but the wind was damn strong. We found a smoldering log from some ones else's fire and started up one of our own. Because of the wind and all the drift wood it wasn't hard at all.

      We headed out to King River with a bunch of folks for a pre-summer solstice party. It was an amazing spot. Great rivers, mountains and it was nice and warm out too.

      On the way back to Anchorage from King River Michael, Matt, Miley, Elena and I stopped at Thunderbird falls and also at Kulik lake. We all wondered why we haven't been there before, it was amazing. It was pretty hot out but the water was ice cold. We just wanted a spot to go swimming but that is pretty rare in Alaska.

      Elena and I decided that our last hike in Alaska should be at Crow Pass. It is an amazing place. You can't beat camping in a place surrounded by mountains, lakes, water falls and glaciers.
