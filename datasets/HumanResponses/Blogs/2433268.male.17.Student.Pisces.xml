      A Bla day is one of those all too frequent occurences when there is literally nothing to do, nowhere to go, nothing on TV, and your  urlLink Kazaa  program isn't working.  What do you do during one of those kind of days?  I'll tell you what you do, you sit around and blog like there's no tomorrow.  Because really what else can you do? Sure you could go outside, find a basketball and shoot some hoops, but what's the point really??  I find that in this situation it's good to have a healthy list of instant messengers available...my favorites being  urlLink ICQ  as well as  urlLink AOL Instant Messenger  and last but not least  urlLink Yahoo Instant Messenger .  Currently I'd recommend Yahoo because they have this AWESOME new interface that really puts it over AOL who has sort of dominated it for years.  ICQ is good if you just wanna connect with people and talk.  MSN deserves a horrible fate as yet another Windows attempt at including something to keep the competitors away  . Sorry I just couldn't resist that one.  Well enough on that, I've filled up enough bla time for now and will probably be back later today to fill up more.

      "BAGHDAD, Iraq - The temporary stewards of Iraq's future reclaimed their nation two days early, accepting limited power Monday from U.S. occupiers who wished them prosperity and handed them a staggering slate of problems â€” including a lethal insurgency the Americans admit they underestimated." - The Associated Press  Kind of nice to see things heading back towards...I guess you can say normality in Iraq.  Sure, they still have tons of problems to work through, but at least you can't just say America is in control anymore...now if only we could finally just withdrawl our troops and be done with it.   Of course then you have those mysterious people who while saying we shouldn't be there and should leave, when we finally DO leave they'll say we should have stayed and finished the job.  Kinda a damned if you do, damned if you don't situation.   urlLink Associated Press

      Well, it's another day close to MittyCon Alpha...for those of you who don't know what that is, it's when people like me get together and play D&D (Dungeons and Dragons) it's one of the greatest pen and paper games ever made!!  We play Living Greyhawk, Living Kalamar, and also we'll be starting Living Planar.  It's a really fun thing to do.  Plus you get to hang out with your friends, eat, carry on stay up late.  Good times.   We'll be doing it this wednesday so wait till then and I'll give you the rundown :-P

       urlLink    Just thought for those of you who didn't know I'd send you the picture that usually goes with my online personality...Don't ask me why but it started out for just one thing and kinda became my whole online net identity. :-)  It's strange how you can be one type of person in reality and someone...not really different, but seemingly just as real online.  So this is it

      You know...some people talk about the many wonders of life.  But really, what's so wonderful about it?? You know, most people go through life never knowing if they even have a purpose.  They're just too miserable to care or seek it out.  You just go day in and day out doing absolutely nothing with your life except for that random odd moment that makes you feel it's all worth it. And then that moment is gone...love, happiness, desire, passion, bravery, they're all just flashes in the dark, too brief glimpses into the meaning of life.

      It seems like only yesterday I didn't have a care in the world, I just went along with whatever was handed to me.  Go through school, hang out with my friends, and if I had time flirt a bit or just have some carefree fun.  It's hard to realize there comes a day when all of a sudden you have to actually decide for yourself where you are going, and what you want to do.  There's no turning back from those kind of choices, and they decide many times who you meet and what your going to do for the rest of your life.  Many people try to avoid the choice, pretend it's not there.  Do something temporary for a while.  But the choice is still there, and you still have to face it.   Well, enough of my rambling, I need to get back to work...

      I figured I'd start one of these things, and maybe actually stick with it for once, because I really need something to write my thoughts down in.  I mean, I have some big decisions to make this summer.  Like what do I really want to do with my life? Go join the army??  Go to college?  Sit around and do nothing?  So far the plan has been to just go and join the army.  They really seem to need people like me in military intelligence and in computer related areas too.  Plus my ASVAB score was 1 point away from perfect which was just something else.  But then I have to consider whether I'll survive through basic or not.  I really don't know...  Well, that seems enough for one entry... I'll just blog a little more later maybe.

      Nope, not really, just doing more important things than blogging every once and a while :-P.  Well, to recap.. Monday night I went to the Embassy Hotel up in Cleveland where the Army put me up all expenses paid.  (They spoil you rotten before sending you to stripped down boot camp don't they?)  Had great food, learned many things about women ;-), lol.  There was this enlisting Marine leaving for basic and he took us around Cleveland to the various bars and other establishments.  For some reason he called the fine looking women beavers, never did get an explanation of that.  But hey, some things just don't need explaining.  Tuesday morning we all got our 4:00 AM wakeup call, oh god the pain!!! Then the bus took us down to the MEPS (Military Entrance Processing System) building down south a bit, at which point the entertainment began.  First we had our breathalizer test, just to make sure that we hadn't done anything stupid the night before, followed by vision test, ears, etc. Standard stuff.  Took a blood sample, and oh man do I not like needles.  The real highlight of the day tho was the "Underwear Olympics".  Imagine a room full of tired guys in their boxers performing various excersizes and activities to prove they are not deformed, such as a duck walk, kick start a bike, things like that, and you'll probably get an idea of how stupid we all looked.  After that it was just mainly waiting, signing the paperwork, I got the job I wanted!!!  96B- Military Intelligence Analyst I know what CNN doesn't :-P  But anyways, took my oath, and went back home and feasted (can't eat while your there), and we were there from roughly 5AM till about 4PM ugh.  But after all of it I was feeling pretty good about myself.  Took wednesday off because I was too tired to do anything, thursday was just busy with various chores, excersizing and the like, I've lost 11 lbs. so far, need to at least lose another 9 to not look like a total slob, friday-saturday attended my grandparents 50th anniversary.  How they stayed together that long will always be a mystery to me, but I'm happy for em.  Then of course today I'm just nice and comfy after a day of food I really shouldn't of eaten and video games I really shouldn't of played :-P Had to splurg a bit.  I'll post more laterz but I think that's enough for now!

      Wednesday night couldn't have been any longer, we played D&D from 8PM-3AM and I was soooo tired, I had a dinner thing setup with the yearbook staff and was all ready to go and all of a sudden I felt terrible.  Probably was the sloppy joes and chips and pop and sugar and energy drinks, lol.  But anyways, it was fun, one of my friends characters is actually now pregnant, we thought there was no chance (1 in 10 chance) but she's now pregnant.  On top of that, we got our asses served to us by a street gang, due to our rather unprepared state.  I was the only one wearing armor at the time, and even in all my full plated glory I just happened to get criticalled and sent into the realm of unconsciousness, our fighter saved the day, having healing pots and cleave, hehe.  Well, it was fun and I got to see all my friends, so the late night and morning sickness is really worth it, although compiled with all the late nights I've been putting in I think my body toxins are building up to critical levels.  Maybe I should just go get some sleep tonight for once.
