(long story!) all was fun! and i listened to nice music all the way from my house to the cinema. dancing and singing going along the road through the industrial estate. just as well it was practically dead and deserted! i wonder if this will turn into a story again? i just have so much to say!&nbsp; urlLink

       laaaaaaazy day today but i was woken up by the hydro electric man? he rang the doorbell and i thought NOOOOOO i'm tired go away! but i had to get up and check to see who it was, i had everything planned to say to emilys little friends if it was them, but it wasnt, it was the meter reading manny. oh well i let him in and he read the meters then i went back to my bed for a while, then i went and got a cup of tea and sat down for a while. then eventually i had to go to the pub at about quarter to 12. it was a strange day at the pub actually, they didnt get any customers until after 12. which meant they were sitting around for about an hour or so, some people even longer. anyway...... umm i was gonna say something on here but i cant remem AAAAAAAH! i know! i was gonna see the stepford wives today? but sarah had to work so it was cancelled, and its now moved onto saturday night. but she might not get there on time cos she has to make sure everyone is home cos shes got some birthday thing? the whole liam thing going on is pretty childish. i dont see why people arent allowed to speak to me anymore. just cos i called him an asshole? umm..... WOW? he sounds like he can be a right asshole at times though cos he always hits people. and those people happen to be girls and they are my friends too? so i'm not allowed to call him an asshole cos he hits my friends? and they're GIRLS for fuck sake, you're not supposed to hit a girl. then again, i'm not sure if liam is included in that because he can be a bit of a bitch sometimes y'no. anyway if he ends up reading this then.. oh well i dont give a shit, and apologise to garry for me will ya hun? i dont have a problem with him because he is civil and knows when to stop, unlike **certain people** oh yeah, and those insults directed at me? call them insults? i'd say they were more...... compliments?&nbsp; urlLink

       omg i'm just like AAAH just now cos i've only got like... just as sec... 26 txts left on my txt quota. i do actually text a lot dont i? :-S oopsies! well i've still got lots of minutes left! and when i say that i mean lots and lots! hee hee! anyway just now i am rather tired out. been at work today, 5-9 - might not sound a lot but when theres low stock, shouting, lots of stuff going on well it seems LOADS! but its all ok though, in the end theres a reward. BED! and money of course :-P anyway i think i shall retire for this evening with my sore back and my rather itchy nose&nbsp; urlLink

       got the exam results today, not too bad - 6 credits and 2 generals. not feeling too happy on the best friend thing again. i never kept a promise and this has caused an awkward silence. or maybe not a silence. when things like this happen i never really shut up i always persist in trying to speak to her and i mess things up even more sometimes. people say we're like a married couple. always arguing and things like that but i guess thats just the way things are between us. we have our similarities and also our differences. we are ourselves but sometimes being ourselves doesnt work and we have to either be a bit nicer or a bit harder on eachother. i really would like to have a proper conversation with her without me saying something stupid or something that sounds horrible when i dont mean it. please please please speak :'( i love you! :-)&nbsp; urlLink

        urlLink    little old henry. he's such a cute little hoover or should i say vacuum. whatever he is, he's there to do a job and you're glad you have him. if there is a mess somewhere, just get him, clean it up and its all gone. its like your friends. imagine life without them, waking up every day thinking "i am alone in this world, there is nobody here for me" life would be shit. we all need friends, and the jobs of friends is to help you through good times and the bad, share things and keep your secrets. you should also try to be a better friend to everyone you know. doing something nice for them makes them appreciate you more, and you appreciate them more because of this. it benefits us all. i'm happy with the friends i've got because they let me be me. they let the mad stuart run around like an idiot. dont know why i put the picture of henry up in the first place but it seemed like a good idea at the time.&nbsp; urlLink

       not really in a good mood just now, got upset at the dinner table. first time i've ever broke down in tears in front of my mum and darren. and i was actually surprised at darrens reaction, "stuart, are you ok?" it just goes to show that you dont always see the nice side of everyone all the time. sam left early today, just after 5 or so which is unusual. she wasnt speaking to me for a bit. she had her reasons, i was being moody as usual. i really hate it when that happens. i go in a funny mood and start being horrible and complain about things then people dont speak to me then i get annoyed because of that and its all just because of me. it is pretty silly going in these moods so i made a promise - not to go in these moods again. i always end up being pissed off at myself for being like that and today it happened. i was very pissed off. i broke down. why do i keep acting like this? is it just me or is it another one of these "growing up" things?&nbsp; urlLink

       ok forgot to mention, i have a sore back :-( but its not too bad. and i went to see garfield at the cindema in perth yesterday with sam! yey! go us! go us! we've been to see quite a few films this summer and so far every one of them has been good! ;-) there was this one time where we were gonna go n see something but we decided not to and then we thought ok we'll go and see mean girls..... again! so we've both been to see that twice now! not a bad film, in fact its quite true. filled with normal life-type things and all different groups of people in the school life. highly recommended :-)&nbsp; urlLink
