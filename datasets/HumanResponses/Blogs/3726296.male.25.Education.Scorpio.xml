						   Hey im getting better at this now.  I was really nervous today cause i have a job interview but it all went well.  Came home from work expecting to have a while to prepare myself for the interview. About 10 mins after i walkied in the front door i got a phone call asking me to go in earlier than arrainged. Of course i went.  The company is great and the interview went really well. They specalise in full time jobs so no agency work which is really great. They are putting me in for 3 different jobs which is great. Hopfully i will here soon about it.  FIngers crossed etc

						   Yeah i know i know i said i would post every day but so much has been happening in my life i forgot to post.   SO catch up time.  I have been hunting for a job and as usual serfing the site and really enjoying myself on there.  Sadly one of my friends on the site had to leave. She was a great gal and i really enjoyed talking to her. I remember the first thing that she said to me was she was happly married and just wanted to have a good time and i accepted that. She was a good person to talk to and i will miss her a lot  More tommorrow. I promise
