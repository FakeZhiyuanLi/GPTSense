      As of July 14th a new year started for me.  I decided to make a personal new year resolution which would be to do different things. Not necessarily any awkward crazy things, just things I had never done before. So far I've accomplished (in no particular order):  * went to the spa (splurged) * ate shark * went on "maid of the mist", Niagara Falls * got rear ended in a car accident (nothing serious)  It's a good start. Hope to still have much more stuff to add to the list.

      Talk about a rude awakening.... I guess that string really was at hand's reach.  And now I've been pulled back to ground with quite a stiff pull.  Everyone has one of those days. Today I'm having it multiplied by about 5. What does it take to make me get up and leave?  At this point not much. Watch me do it...  Cheersh

       I hate that feeling of 'just floating in the air'. Uncertainty prevails. Is my string still at hand's reach in order for me to be pulled back to ground?      On the side...  I'm reading "Blindness" by Jose Saramago. I've already read it in the original language, now I'm reading the english version. Reason? Simple: does the translation do it justice? is the story as captivating in another language? So far, YES! Highly recommended novel by everyone that has read it.  Just a quick note: Armani Mania, also recommended to the boys out there.

      I just heard a colleague of mine get threatened by a customer.  She followed procedure for his own security and that's what she got.  A big fat ugly uncensored speech.  Screaming is rude.  What have we come to?  Keep your money under your mattress if you don't know how to control your nerves.  Arsehole! Man, more and more I wanna leave.  Or maybe sleep for a really long time.

      So today I'm alive and kicking....myself in the arse for staying out so late partying last nite.  Man, let me tell you, a couple of drinks and some crazy dance moves are a great sleeping pill. And it works just like one too, b/c this morning couldn't get up for the life of me. Man, eeqaz you looked hot yesterday (or so that was the general consensus).  Cerellean, so did you hun, you're always hot. Work, dreaded, but unavoidable, let's go...

      No happy disco song here.  Just trying to survive the horrid slow-death routine. And tomorrow, one more miserable unsuccessful try.  I know I'm getting out, but ironically actually can't quit yet. That sucks ass. Have a wonderful day to those who enjoy their jobs, about  .11% of the population.
