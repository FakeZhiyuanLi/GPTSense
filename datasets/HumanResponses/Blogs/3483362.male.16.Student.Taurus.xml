      I hate that qweer!he kicked out me(allon...apparently the nazzi),matt(the freakishy large lepichan),and trevor for talking about school work!!ne ways we are just sitting around now and matts told me about this site blog.im not good at typing stuff so don't expect many posts.So back the subject that is the hate I have for guzyk.The only reason he sends people out f the class is caus he's on his  own little power trip where when he finds even 1 person not paying attention to his boring class he gets rid of them cuas he doesn't properly know how to punsish people.plus he gets mad for the most stuid reasons,he got rid of trevor for getting a drink of water!!!i mean what the hell!!!!!!ne ways i thank anyone who had the patience to sit through my stupid rant. so im sooooooooooooooooo gone now.c ya everyone

      I was just sitting around at home when i thought"huh...i havn't writtin a blog in a long while," so now I am. So far summer has been pretty kick ass and chances are will only get better as time progresses.tomorrow I'm goin with matt out to amandas baseball game.I just have one question for here though "why the hell would anyone wake up that early for anythign!!!"i mean she woke up at 5:00am with matt to go to her game this morning and now im goin with them tomorrow at 8:00am to go to one of her games.i like goin to her games but whoever scheduald these games are crazy and must live just for the satasfaction of dipriving inocint people of their sleep!but a little off topic... like i said,summer should be really kick ass.cuz i get to go to edmonton to visit my dad for 3 weeks:),which should be a blast knowing him.then i get to go to qwanoes.....there are so many hot girls there!!!sooo many.my only complaint about his summer is once it is over i must leave and go to another school,stupid parents who think their laways right.im so happy i got to meet the people i did before this summer like hailey,kara,sage,ham(i want my glasses back befor i leave!),and others from that group,jess(of whom is unfortunatly in saskatchewan right now),and probably others that im too tierd to remember right now.u guys r all cool,funny,nice,etc.and everyone els...im lookin forward to hangin out with you all.i just hope im around when matt,andrew,tohmas,and em' go paintballing again,that was so kick ass(and somewhat painfull).ne ways im running out of things to drag on about so im gunna go now,have a great summer everyone and goobye!!!!
