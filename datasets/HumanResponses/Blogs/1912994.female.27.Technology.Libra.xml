      after another wonderful week and weekend at home, the journey again takes me to ohio, hopefully the last trip up here for a while. weekend was great, weather is finally starting to cool down and the humidity is at a reasonable level. don't feel like the humid glue hits me when i walk outside, but i'm sure that was just for the weekend and the humid swamp will return again.  saturday turned into an xbox day - brute force - was at our beckoning, and we whipped up on some alien muntant ass.  sunday was football as usual, no good games on tv - but still enjoyed the thrill of football season.   and now to monday -- up at 4:45am to catch a 6:30am flight, i truly believe flights that early should be banned.  so i get on the plane, same seat as last time i might add, and the flight attendant remembers me - here, all i want to do is sleep - and she has to tell me how she remembers me from 2 weeks ago and from before then and how i sit in the same seat.  all very good observations on her part, but remember i just want to sleep.  i did my best to be kind and talk with her, but when she came back to sit across from me and talk - i had to continue on to sleep land.

      Once again how music can make you think... anyone?    Fuel - "Falls On Me"     You see me hanging round  starting to swear about this black hole of a dark field  and silently within hands touchin skin sharp  breaks my disease and i can breath   and all of your ways  all you dream falls on me  it falls on me  and your beautiful sky  the light you breath  falls on me  it falls on me ahha  i feel like a pain  it draws me in again sqaushes all my worst of me  darkness in my veins  I never could explain  and i wonder if you have ever seen  and still believe   /chorus  am I that strong  to carry on  have i changed your life  have i changed my world could you save me ahhhhha   /chorus  /chorus

      does the dream exist... anyone?  somedays are better than other days, life is strange like that.  one day you can be in such a good mood and not really understand the reasoning behind the spark in your eyes and the next day your mood is the complete opposite, once again, not understanding the mud in your eyes.

      positive purposes to ohio's existence:    1.  most restaurants and bars use pepsi products    2.  my sweetie grew up in the state     *so kindly reminded of*  that is it, the only two positive reasons for ohio's existence!

      'two years after the September 11 terrorist attacks on the United States, people across the nation and around the world are honoring the 3,016 people killed when four hijacked airplanes crashed into the World Trade Center towers, the Pentagon and a Pennsylvania field...'  two years ago, i remember driving into work - had the radio on - 'a plane has just flown into the world trade center tower #2.'  i remember thinking what, what are they talking about?  5 mins later i arrived in the office and immediately attempted to bring up msnbc.com or cnn.com something that would tell me what hell was happening.  these sites where overloaded with people, just like me, needing to know what was going on.  finally i was able to connect to msnbc.com and began watching the live video stream from new york.  as soon as i connected, another plane had flown into tower #1.  at that point my heart was beating so fast, my mind was going in circles, i didn't understand, what was happening?  then my co-worker (jason) came up to my desk and began to tell me that 'terrorists are attacking us, the are flying planes into buildings.'  i remember turning and looking at him... and my heart sank, my eyes got watery and  for the first time in my lifetime the world that i felt was so safe and secure was no longer.  i remember sitting there watching the live feeds - blown away by what i was seeing - the fear, the anger, the confusion - everything new yorkers were feeling, so was i.  so today, on this day, i am grateful to be alive, grateful to be an American and most of all aware of how short life can be.  i can only hope you feel the same.

      ...what appears to be a crisis is often merely the end of an illusion... sometimes the thrill of the crisis allows for deeper passion, other times, it allows for deeper frustration.  is it all an illusion which indefinetly cripples our minds until we are out of control? or is that in itself the actual illusion? anyone...

      last week i spent the week and weekend in california.  but lets get right to the weekend part - for that is the most memorable... the adventure summary:  ...hot sun, clear deep blue sky, cool breeze, golden gate bridge, steep cliffs, tide pools, massive waves, otters, sea lions, surfer boyz and GIRLZ, Santa Cruz boardwalk, sunset on the Pacific ocean, pitchblack beach walk, finding whole sand-dollars, some green, a kick ass jeep and good friend.   the adventure down highway 1 in california between san francisco and santa cruz is something my eyes will never forget the first time i saw.  the pictures don't speak for all the beauty i saw on this day.  driving over the hill i remember seeing the coast and just being in awe of what nature consists of.  the day quickly turned into dusk - it seems like for this day there could not of been enough hours to satisify my curiosity into a side of the world i have never explored.  pictures soon to follow on photos page.

      thought for the week:  "People talk about all this unused CPU [computer] power on the planet, but the greatest amount of untapped CPU power on the planet is the human brain, It's just a question of how you loop them into [computer networks] and connect them to it."

      imagine this.... the world and reality as you currently live it everyday comes to a halt, and for an evening you live what you have only imagined in your dreams.  ... now imagine a  urlLink 50-foot Catamaran  chartered out of Clearwater Beach. ... now imagine the passenger list just including you, your partner, an attendant, and the captain.  ... the weather was perfect, just cool enough to bundle up in a sweatshirt, the sky clear as could be,  the stars began to shine so brightly once away from all the city lights. the reflection of joy in my sweeties face - made for many  breathlessness moments of inner and outer excitement.  ... imagine looking off to the left of the sailboat and seeing a dolphin jumping out of the water, playing... following along with the boat - it was almost as if he was saying happy birthday.  the experience was  urlLink surreal!  and the best birthday to date.

      happy birthday to me....   quote:   "When you first start writing stories in the first person if the stories are made so real that people believe them the people reading them nearly always think the stories really happened to you. That is natural because while you were making them up you had to make them happen to the person who was telling them. If you do this successfully enough you make the person who is reading them believe that the things happened to him too. If you can do this you are beginning to get what you are trying for which is to make the story so real beyond any reality that it will become a part of his memory. There must be things that he did not notice when he read the story or the novel which without his knowing it, enter into his memory and experience so that they are a part of his life. This is not easy to do."   --Ernest Hemingway, unpublished manuscript, Kennedy Library collection

      the semicolon  does anyone really understand the underlying purpose of a semicolon? in english class we all learn that it has some high valued purpose in the realm of english grammar.  our friends teach us the intricate uses of the semicolon in instant messenger (a winking face, a rose.)  but down inside the semicolon is just on a quest for a purpose, a core rationale that won't be easily taken away by such symbols as the tilda(~) or whatever this is(`).  isn't that what we all are on a quest for in life? the one thing that makes us different, unique, from the rest of the common world... anyone?

      i can't believe schwarzenegger is the new governor of california.  very interesting what this world is looking to hold on to. we'll see how well he does.   Feeling of the day:   The Nature of Anger  Anger is "an emotional state that varies in intensity from mild irritation to intense fury and rage," according to Charles Spielberger, PhD, a psychologist who specializes in the study of anger. Like other emotions, it is accompanied by physiological and biological changes; when you get angry, your heart rate and blood pressure go up, as do the levels of your energy hormones, adrenaline, and noradrenaline.

      OH MY BUCS... WTF was that... i think they went home at half time and decided not to play the rest of the game.  Anyway.. back in town this week.  good to be home, weather is hot - i'm hoping it will cool down for camping next week.  but if not i'm sure an enlightening time will still be had by all participants.  have i mentioned that my birthday is in eight days!   question of the week:   how many licks does it take to get to the center of a tootsie roll pop?  anyone....

It's a very dark day in American history when for the first time an American president has endorsed codifying discrimination in our most precious document."   ... canada anyone ...?

      THE LATEST: Gay Parent Adoption Ban Upheld in Florida    Sad, but true: Last week the Court of Appeals for the  11th Circuit ruled that in the case of Lofton v.  Kearney, Florida is allowed to uphold the 1977 law  that prohibits gay people from adopting children.    In a statement released by the Family Pride Coalition  (www.familypride.org), Executive Director Aimee Gelnaw  said, "This decision is a crushing blow...The judges  in this case didn't just rule against gay dads and  lesbian moms...They ruled against thousands and  thousands of Florida children who need stable and  loving homes. It is appalling, unconscionable and  even negligent to turn their backs on the thousands  children in Florida who need loving homes such as  the ones provided for years by these plaintiff families."   The site www.lethimstay.com was created by ACLU to  educate the public about the adoption ban and the  background on Lofton v. Kearney.  Since last week's  ruling, the only addition to the website has been  the brief statement that the ACLU is "very  disappointed" and "carefully considering what steps  to take next."

      Laura Schlessinger is a US radio personality, who dispenses advice to people  who call in to her Radio show. On her radio show recently, she said that, as  an observant Orthodox Jew, homosexuality is an abomination, according to  Leviticus 18:22, and cannot be condoned under any circumstance. The  following response is an open letter to Dr. Laura, penned by a US resident,  which was posted on the Internet.   Dear Dr. Laura:  Thank you for doing so much to educate people regarding God's Law. I have  learned a great deal from your show, and try to share that knowledge with as  many people as I can. When someone tries to defend the homosexual lifestyle,  for example, I simply remind them that Leviticus 18:22 clearly states it to  be an abomination ... End of debate.   I do need some advice from you, however, regarding some other elements of  God's Laws and how to follow them.   1. Leviticus 25:44 states that I may possess slaves, both male and  female, provided they are purchased from neighboring nations. A  friend of mine claims that this applies to Mexicans, but not Canadians.  Can you clarify? Why can't I own Canadians?   2. I would like to sell my daughter into slavery, as sanctioned in  Exodus 21: 7. In this day and age, what do you think would be a fair  price for her?   3. I know that I am allowed no contact with a woman while she is in her  period of menstrual uncleanliness - Lev.15: 19-24. The problem is how  do I tell? I have tried asking, but most women take offense.   4. When I burn a bull on the altar as a sacrifice, I know it creates a  pleasing odor for the Lord - Lev.1: 9. The problem is, my neighbors. They  claim the odor is not pleasing to them. Should I smite them?   5. I have a neighbor who insists on working on the Sabbath. Exodus 35:2  clearly states he should be put to death. Am I morally obligated to  kill him myself, or should I ask the police to do it?   6. A friend of mine feels that even though eating shellfish is an  abomination - Lev. 11:10, it is a lesser abomination than  homosexuality. I don't agree. Can you settle this? Are there 'degrees' of  abomination?   7. Lev. 21:20 states that I may not approach the altar of God if I have  a defect in my sight. I have to admit that I wear reading glasses. Does  my vision have to be 20/20, or is there some wiggle-room here?   8. Most of my male friends get their hair trimmed, including the hair  around their temples, even though this is expressly forbidden by Lev.  19:27. How should they die?   9. I know from Lev. 11:6-8 that touching the skin of a dead pig makes  me unclean, but may I still play football if I wear gloves?   10. My uncle has a farm. He violates Lev.19:19 by planting two different  crops in the same field, as does his wife by wearing garments made of  two different kinds of thread (cotton/polyester blend). He also tends to  curse and blaspheme a lot. Is it really necessary that we go to all the  trouble of getting the whole town together to stone them? Lev.24:10-16.  Couldn't we just burn them to death at a private family affair, like we do  with people who sleep with their in-laws? (Lev. 20:14)   I know you have studied these things extensively and thus enjoy considerable  expertise in such matters, so I am confident you can help. Thank you again  for reminding us that God's word is eternal and unchanging.

      FYI: Allison did not respond to our request for the safe return of clyde... (we hope he is still alive - we have not heard anything about his condition)...Realize she has had him for 5 years, that is only about 5% of his life expendency, so 5 years in turtle time is nothing - and i want him back!  let the legal games begin... after all, she has admitted it was orginally mine (in writting, emails, etc) which is all the proof I need in a florida civil case.  interesting part is she will have to fly down here to attend the case, that should be fun.

      interesting fact: ever since i formally requested my turtle back from the snatcher, she has had someone come to my website (since her IP is blocked) for her EVERYDAY... pretty damn pathetic eh (yet i have to admit semi-comical)? anyone...    i mean did she really think, that after not talking to me for a year and a half, (ignoring my email and calls) that just because she emails me and FINALLY lets me know why she is 'upset' with me that it would all just go away and be ok... did she forget cathy 101? cause you know what... i don't work that way...   if there is one thing i have learned in the last 4 years of my life :: life is way to short :: - i don't need someone in my life that wastes a year and a half over something so petty as not being a brides maid in her wedding (cause i couldn't afford to), however i did pay $300 per plane ticket for me and gwenn to be able to be there.. apparently that means nothing, along with ten years of frienship.  yes, apparently she is that superficial... anyone...
