       Shalom....  totally bored...lol listening to Yahoo! Radio on messenger.....they're playin Smooth Criminal, funny times in elementary school.....haha anyways...yeah i've been sittin around most of this week, i had power skating on tuesday but that's all i've done, other than sunday i went to Castle Ice Centre instead of Kent Valley Ice Centre, both are cool but I like Lynnwood the best, but the ice is softer than at Kent. I can't wait until Saturday its gonna be funny, my brother has his team picnic for baseball and we're gonna play a giant game with siblings and parents and of course the team members, i might play catcher if they let me, lol i'm a lefty when i play catcher....so that's partly why one of my nicknames is lefty, but anyways...I can't wait for school to start up again, it's so boring around here.......anyways I think i'm gonna go for now, i don't really feel like writin any more, can't think of what to write anyways.....shalom....lol feel like speakin hebrew today, dunno why.....   °·.·°Neysa°·.·°
