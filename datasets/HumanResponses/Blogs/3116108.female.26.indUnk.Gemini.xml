      Wow!...what a day!  Matt invited me to a Red Sox game today.  And guess where our seats were...in a private suite!  Oh man, now that's going to a ball game.  The weather was perfect too.  Matt, Steph, and I lived it up eating the free food and drinking the free beer while watching the game from spectacular seats and catching replays on the big plasma TV.  There were actually 3 plasma TVs, one on the balcony, one in the suite, and one in the bathroom!     Just as I thought it could get no better, we caught a ball (well, we didn't really catch it, but grabbed it off the floor).  It came so fast right at us, I had no idea what was going on.  Matt tried to protect me, but instead elbowed me in the head (thanks for the sweet intentions hun).  It didn't hurt, just made me more confused.  It wasn't until the ball hit the plexiglass behind me and fell behind my chair did I realize what was going on.  Steph sat there pointing at the TV all excited because we were on TV.  How cool are we.  Did anyone see us?  Matt, being the great guy he is, decided to give it to the 5 year old boy who was in the suite with us.  I'm sure that made his week.  He told me that he had a little league game later in the evening and he was going to show his team.  How cute.  Great game.  Sox won 4-0 against Tampa Bay.  Go Sox!  After the game we left the suite.  Actually, they had to kick us out b/c we were quite reluctant to leave.  Today is a double header and so we were hoping they wouldn't notice if we stayed for the second game.  Yeh right, nice try.  So we went across the way for some blueberry ale at Boston Beer Works.  Steph got hit on by some guy using a cheesy pick up line and another guy was a little too creepy with Matt in the restroom.  Needless to say, we quickly finished our beers and headed out.    Matt and I came back to my place for a little rest and relaxation.  What a fantabulous day!  Thanks babe.

      So I think I've finally kicked the caffeine addiction! For the past couple of months my taste buds and appetite have changed quite a bit.  I no longer crave or desire drinking coffee at any point in the day.  It's very strange to me.  In the mornings I know drink either flavored H20 or Arizona white cranberry & apple iced green tea...yummy.  By the way, a quick little aside... written on the top of the iced tea bottle in large bold letters is "NO CARBOHYDRATES"...if you read the nutritional label on the side it states 2 total carbohydrates. So they mean that the net effective carb impact is zero grams.  Please people, is 2 grams of carbs worth the bold letters?  I can't get over how carb phobic society had become!  Anyhoo, back to caffeine.  Not knowing how much caffeine is in green tea compared to coffee, I checked.  Coffee has 4x the amount of caffeine compared to green tea.  So I have cut back a lot!  In the evenings I've been drinking peppermint herbal tea, which is caffeine free.  It's great, no more withdrawal headaches.  No more dependence on coffee.  It's only taken about 10 years, but hey, better late than never!

      So late last night I decided to try and organize my room.   What I ended up doing was sorting through my summer clothes in hopes that warm weather will soon be here to stay for a while.  Bad idea Meliss.  It only made me depressed.  You see, last summer was miserable.  Early in June, I got Strep throat.  Only 2 weeks following that, I got a very bad case of Mono.  Being barely able to swallow liquids, I lived off of Gatorade and chicken broth for 3 months, literally.  The only good thing to come out of this, I lost nearly 20 pounds.  So all the clothes I have from last summer are a little snug on me now.  Seeing that I have since returned to my normal size (which I am ok with, but I'm a girl and wouldn't mind losing a few pounds); I need to go shopping for some new summer clothes.  I'm not much of a shopper, in fact I don't really like it at all.  It frustrates me and I end up shopping for hours and coming home with nothing.  I need help...anyone wanna come shopping with me?    I wish exercise would help, but for me it doesn't...it just keeps me my normal size and prevents me from getting any bigger.  I would try the Atkins diet b/c I've seen that work initally on most people, but I am totally against it.  I believe in a  balanced  diet.  So we'll see, maybe longer runs and more trips to the gym can somehow do the trick.  If not, the mall...here I come.  :(  So it's lunch time...like I feel like eating now.  Oh, if only there were a way to switch on the metabolism into high gear.  Maybe that should be the focus of my next research project.  For now, a balanced healthy lunch.  Later.

      Had a nice weekend.  Yesterday I went for dinner with Becky, Matt, and Jon to the Parish Cafe for some fancy sandwiches.  We also tried some of the chocolate beer.  As I expected, GROSS!!!  Jon liked it, so we let him finish it off.  After dinner, we went across the street to play some pool at the Rattlesnake.  I like the new look of the place.  We listened to The Cure (one of my favorite bands) while we played...sorry Matt.  Then Jon had the idea of going to the South Street Diner for some coffee and dessert.  Did you know that you can put maple syrup on chocolate chip flipjacks?  haha :P.  Fun night.  This morning we watched a little Tommy Boy.  I've seen it several times before, but it's just as hilarious every time!  [Tommy:  "Does this suit make me look fat?"  Richard:  "No. Your face does"]  Haha.  I need to get my own Tommy Boy DVD.   Then had some lunch at Breuggers Bagels.  I tried for the first time the Matt Smith special...a mustard, cream cheese, ham, bean sprout, and lettuce onion bagel sandwich.  Sounded gross, but it's actually quite yummy.  Who would of thought?  I may order that next time.  Try it!  I'm now off for a run...Adios.

      After a great night's sleep, I figured today would be a good day.  The weather was beautiful, a perfect spring day.  I layed out on the roof for a while working on my tan.  I'm not much darker, it takes time for me to tan, maybe by the end of the summer I'll see the effects.   While I was on the roof,  I was able to use my laptop thanks to the WiFi card Matt gave me.  Thanks hun!  It's so convenient!  Later I met Matt for dinner at PF Chang's...yummy kung pao chicken.  My fortune cookie read something like 'your independence will bring you good things' ...we'll see.  After dinner we walked around Bay Village.  Hmmm, you may be wondering where exactly this is.  It is a small area near the South end and BackBay.  Who knew.  It was a great walk along with great company.  Nice evening overall.   Then I came home.  I ended up going for a drive.  Anyone out there who knows me understands why I went for a drive.  Enough said.  I picked up Briana along the way.  Luv ya sweetie.  Now I'm settling in for some zzz's.  G'night.

      I had such a great weekend.  Matt and I went on a nice hike on Sunday.  It was a  beautiful day for it.  Then we went on a geocache in the same area using his new GPS device.  We ended up on hunting grounds where shots were being fired.   We had the wrong coordinates...oops...luckily we made it back alive to tell the story.  It was fun though...quite the adventure!!! haha  Monday I watched the Boston Marathon from mile 22.  I won a bet that Cleveland Circle was mile 22.4, not 22.3.  I guess I never told Matt I have a very good memory when it comes to numbers.  Now he has to cook me dinner :).  I'm hungry just thinking about it.  That reminds me that I still owe him a birthday dinner.  Pick a day hun.  Tuesday morning was the best.   Tonight I went to for a walk with Briana.  I got frozen yogurt (yum) and she got hot chocolate.    I went to park my car tonight and whacked the door on my lip.  It gushed with blood for several minutes.  Now there's a big gash on a fat lip.  Very pretty Meliss. Goes well with my ultra sunburned shoulders.  So I'm icing it now as I watch Jay Leno.    Going to bed soon.  g'night

      Last night was nice.  I got hungry around 9:30pm (probably b/c I hadn't eaten dinner yet) so Matt and I went for some pizza...it was gooood.  Then we felt the need to walk it off, so we walked up what is probably the steepest ave in the city (Summit Ave)....all worth it though b/c when you get to the top, there is a little park that overlooks the city.  It's gorgeous, especially at night.      Tomorrow night I'm catching up with Becky for dinner and drinks.   It's been a while, but no matter how long it's been, it always feels like i saw her yesterday.  It works that way with good friends.  Thanks Beck :).

      Easter was nice.  I went to service in the morning, it was nice...I haven't been in such a long time.  Then I had Easter dinner with the fam.  When I came back, we had cake with Matt to celebrate his birthday.  After a long day, I had such a great night's sleep...made Monday morning much less painful than it usually is :).    My parents gave me a George Foreman grill yesterday.  I used it tonight to make some chicken for dinner.  It's great.  I'm probably the last person on earth to get one of these great inventions.  Better late than never, right.  It does take the joy out of cooking, which I love to do, but when there's no time to cook, this is the way to go!

      The Red Sox won today ...yeah! :) .     Tomorrow is Easter.  I'm going to service in the morning.  Then I'm heading to RI to have Easter dinner with the fam.  It's always nice to see my parents, sisters, brother, and Gram.  It's not often we are all together at the same time.  For those of you who know me, you know that I can't wait to see my niece and nephew....2 of the cutest, most lovable kids on the face of the earth!  (not biased at all, haha)     I'm kinda hoping that mom has dug out the Easter baskets this year.  It's tradition, then again I am 25.  We each had one growing up, a pastel colored crocheted basket made by gram.  Mine is yellow.  They are funny looking, but we all love em.  (all includes my cousins too; we all have em...thanks Gram)  The Easter bunny (aka mom and dad) would fill each with chocolate of course....except mine, I'm not a big chocolate fan, so I got candy.   Actually, I do enjoy one kind of chocolate...the cadbury mini eggs...love those!  They only come out around Easter,so I look foward to them.  Yum.

      Today started off great...it's Friday and the sun was shining.  I started to feel a bit under the weather in the afternoon though.  I fell asleep from 5-10pm and when I woke up, I had no idea what day or time it was.  The  power must have gone out when I was asleep b/c my alarm clock was flashing 12:00.  So confusing.  One would think I'd be wide awake now, but I think I'll go back to bed soon and hope for a better day tomorrow.    So the Red Sox lost to the Blue Jays today :( , hopefully they can bounce back tomorrow.  For those of you going to the game, have fun!

      I'm restless....it's 12:46 am and I can't sleep, grr...tossing and turning, turning and tossing.  I have to be up early b/c I am going jogging with one of my coworks early in the AM before work...as Charles Schultz once said:  "Jogging is very beneficial.  It's good for your legs and your feet.  It's also very good for the ground.  It makes it feel needed."  Perhaps if I turn off the TV and my laptop, I'll fall asleep soon.  Wish me luck.  G'night.

      Today I am blogging for the first time.  A certain special person introduced this to me and helped me get started.  Thanks sweetie.    A friend invited me to a Passover meal tonight.  I am not Jewish, but I am quite a fan of the matzah ball soup...yum.  I learned some things about Passover.  Thanks Sam and Dara.

      Saturday Matt and I went to a wedding at  urlLink Old Sturbridge Village .  For those of you who are not familiar with this place, it's a small little village in a small little town in Western Mass where they reenact the early 1800s.  The wedding was held in a chapel that was built in 1830.  The reception was interesting.  They had a blue grass band playing.  A bunch of us tried dancing to the music, but failed miserably.  I haven't brushed up on my bluegrass dancing skills in a while, haha.    We got back to the hotel around 11:30.   After taking advantage of the open bar all night, we were hungry when we got back.  So we asked at the front desk for the # of a pizza delivery place.  To our surprise, the women told us there were none and it was too late for anything to be open.  Mind you...it's 11:30pm on a Saturday night!!!  Let's just say that Sturbridge is not the hippest place to be.  Cute though.  We headed out in the morning, Matt, Raj, and I.  We decided to go check out  urlLink Mohegan Sun .  Cool place, even though I don't gamble.  We had fun though, then we headed back to the city.  It was nice to be back.   Yeah to long weekends!  Back to work tomorrow though :(.

      Yesterday my handsome and adorable little nephew got baptized. Then the family and friends all went to my sisters for diner and cake. It was nice...good food and conversations. The weather considerably improved from the morning, so we got to utilize my sister's nice deck and backyard for the party. I think she was happy that she didn't have to cram all the guests into her house, that would of been tough ... Shelby and Brenden's toys take up most of the free space.

Then Matt and I went to Michael's Craft store and he bought me a new case for all my beading stuff.  It's perfect!  I transfered all my stuff into it last night and it fits just the way I want it to :).

      Friday I went to the mall to shop for a dress for an upcoming wedding.  Not so fun considering Meliss dislikes shopping and dresses.  To help me, I brought Briana along.  I knew she would give me honest opinions and motivation to find one.  We searched everywhere, but all the stores have the same ugly dresses!  We ended up leaving the mall tired and hungry.  I've decided to just wear the dress I wore last year to my cousin's wedding.  Matt likes it...thank goodness b/c I don't want to go back out there and look again!  There was one dress...I saw it last week...I loved it...but it was a designer dress and way too much $.  I should of never tried it on; the worst thing a girl can do when she really wants something she can't have!  Even though I loved it, I would never spend that kind of hard earned $ for one article of clothing...especially one I can't wear very often.  Anyhoo, we finished off the hellish shopping night eating at Friendly's.  We even got a 2 scoop/ 1 topping ice cream sundae free with our meal.  It was freezing in the restaurant, so we took it to go.  Once we started eating it, we realized the waitress didn't get our orders exactly right.  Mine was a minor mistake, but Briana got quite the interesting sundae.  Maple walnut ice cream with (instead of the swiss chocolate topping she asked for) strawberry topping.  Odd combo.  She at it anway and was happy.

      Last night Mat and I cooked an Indian meal together from my new cookbook.  We made chicken dopiaza and i must say, we out did ourselves.  I ate so much of it that I needed to walk it off so we strolled over to REI.  Matt bought me a new nalgene bottle.  By new I mean it's a new design.  It's very cool, red, 750ml, and a sturdy rubber lid.   urlLink    Yeh, I'm cool.  Today my lab and some others from the department walked over to the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum for lunch, compliments of Pediatric Oncology.  It was so nice...we could not have asked for better weather and our table was on the back patio amongst beautiful flowers and architecture.  The food was great as well as the company. It was a nice group, we didn't have to talk science the whole time, which was nice.  It's nice to leave work behind and chat about other interesting things with coworkers for a change. We talked about a bunch of cool things; from fencing, to music, and languages.  Briana started talking about a man who plays Metallic music on his cello.  Funny, because the cellist at our table didn't even know who Metallica was.  If he only knew!  It was nice to get out of the lab on such a beautiful day.  Now it is back to work.

      I had a quiet and relaxing weekend.  Friday night I had some me time.  I went for a nice long walk and then watched  the movie Freida on TV; good movie.  Gotta love the new digital cable!   Saturday morning I went for a nice long run.  Felt good.  Later I met up with Becky and we packed our dinner and headed out of the city to Walden Pond.  By the time we got there, scary storm clouds had moved in.  We braved it and ate our dinner by the beach area of the pond.   It was just about closing when we finished, so we didn't get a chance to walk around the pond...we probably wouldn't of anyway considering the weather.  Next time I'll go earlier and pay more attention to the weather forecast.  Nevertheless, it was great to be surrounded by nature, leaving the hustle and bustle of the city for a bit.    Since we got back pretty early, we decided to watch a movie...I feel the need to get my money's worth for this digital cable ;).  Since I've heard alot of people say good things about the movie  The House of Sand and Fog , we decided on that one.  Hmmm, not sure what everyone like about it.  A tad bit long and drawn out, which if it had been good, I would of overlooked. I really didn't get the point of the movie and it was quite depressing.  Perhaps the book is better, but now I'm not inclined to read it.  Funny, most of you know that I have a very hard time staying awake during movies, and go figure, I stayed awake through this painful one, all 2 hours and 15 minutes of it.  Why can't I stake awake for the good ones??? Anyhoo, if you haven't seen  The House of Sand and Fog , don't.

      After dinner yesterday (Indian, Yummy), we went for a walk along the Charles in Cambridge.  Along the way, the new MIT Stata Center building caught our attention.  I had only seen pictures in a magazine, so we decided to go check it out. WOW...Frank Gehry has deisgned an outrageously cool building over at MIT! Go take a look...very fun.  Later we headed over to the Coolidge Corner Theater to see the Morgan Spurlock documentary "SUPER SIZE ME".  If you haven't heard about it, in a nutshell, it's about a connection between fast food and obesity and the personal vs. corporate responsibility of it all.  Spurlock, a man in great physical health, conducts an experiment where he can only eat McDonald's food for 30 days straight...breakfast, lunch, and dinner.  Disgusting!  It was no big surprise that Spurlock's health severely deteriorates.  His liver becomes toxic and his levels for pretty much everything else skyrockets. If watching this movie doesn't stop people from eating out regularly, I don't know what will!

      So my roommates are leaving Boston and I am looking for a new apartment.  I figure change is good and rather than find 2 new roomates to move into my current apartment, I will look for a new place.  Yesterday when I came home there was a realtor in my room showing a girl the apartment.  Very weird.  I'v been in this place for 3 years now.  So weird to think of other people living here and me somewhere else.  I keep reminding myself....Change is good Meliss.  Another reason for moving is because Brookline has the worst parking rules.  No overnight street parking (even for residents) and  no parking on the street 8am-10am.  I am forced to rent a spot for a substantial amount of $ in addition to my hight rent.  Spots are hard to find too; my spot is 4 streets away and I constantly have to move 3 cars to dig mine out.  HIGHLY annoying, especially in the rain and cold!  All I ask is for a free spot near my apartment...is that too much to ask.  I have decided to search for an apartment on the other side of the river, in Cambridge.  They are much smarter when it comes to parking...in alot of areas you can buy a yearly parking pass for approximately $10 and can park overnight on the street!  Also, I am getting sick of the green line and would like to live somewhere equidistant to the green and red lines.     I saw one apartment in Cambridgeport, just along the river, that I loved.  The people, the location, the apt...well, all except for the room.  It's just too small.  I've been racking my brain for days deciding if I want to take the place.   Weighing the pros and cons.   Holy stressd I've been about making a decision!  I finally came to the decision that I need more space.  Unfortunate, I really liked it, but I have until the end of June to find a room.  Wish me luck.  At least now the weight of making a decision is off my shoulders.  Ahhh.

      Friday evening Becky and I went to Zaftigs for dinner...Our usual restaurant choice when we meet up for a bite to eat...great jewish deli.  We did the usual catching up/gossiping girls are known for.  Then I met Matt for a night over at Copperfields in the Fenway area.  Cool bar.  His friend Steph was meeting us there; she knew one of the singers in the cover band that was playing.  Fun dancing music.  We ended up seeing one his roommates there as well as Jon B.  We drank some Coronas and a lemon drop shot.  I think we did it wrong. I swear I remember taking them with sugar, but we didn't get any, just a lemon. Anyone know if it should come with sugar too?  Anyhoo, Copperfields shut down around 1, so Jon, Matt and I headed over to Jake Ivorys (a piano bar) for an extra hour of fun.  It was pretty dead in there, but fun none the less.  On the way back to the car, Matt and Jon stopped off for some onion & pepper smothered sausages from the Sausage Guy cart.  Yum...NOT!!!...more like smelly.  It was a late night and we all crashed at Matt's place.  We were quite the lazy butts...the only thing that got us out of bed in the morning (well, early afternoon :0) was that we were starving and also needed some coffee.  For those of you who read my blog, yes, I am back to liking coffee.  Kicking the caffeine addiction didn't last long.  Darn.  As soon as we finally got our act together and our bellies were happy, Matt and I were off to find another geocache.  This one was tricky.  The clue was not so well written, but HA!, can't stump us...we eventually found it.  We're such cool dorks, haha.  Later Becky and I went to see a movie...don't ask which one...I'm embarrassed to tell.  We didn't have many choices, there's not much out now.  That's my excuse. :P

      I'd been suffering from withdrawal symptoms, not having seen my little neice and nephew in a couple of weeks.  So Saturday Matt and I took a trip  to RI to visit them.  This was the first time he was going to meet some of my family.  He blended well...I figured him and my brother-in-law would get along great.  They both love gadgets and tech stuff, cool geeks :).  I was right.   We helped build a swing set and play cube with a slide thingy (not sure what its called) for Shelby.  She loved it.  I think everyone had a good time.  I know I did.  I'm really glad Matt came along.  When I figure out how to post pictures on this site, I will put up some of the kids...then you can see how cute they are!

      Yet another great weekend.   Matt and I decided to go kayaking after work on Friday.  We would of gone sailing, but it was a red flag day, which means high winds.  Although I do trust Matt, I wouldn't want to chance having the wind blow us into the Charles River...it's not the cleanest.  So I met Matt at work and we walked down to the Community Boating Club to go kayaking.  We looked a little funny because we were dressed in work clothes.  This was my first time kayaking, so I was a bit nervous, mostly due to my fear of falling into a dirty river.  To my surprise, I loved it!  Matt assured me it was very difficult to tip a kayak...and it was very stable.  Seeing the view of Boston and Cambridge from the middle of the river was spectacular!  It was a great upper body workout too, seeing that the wind kept trying to pull us into the middle of the sailboat race and we had to steer against the wind :0.  Only thing...next time we will wear waterproof clothing, seeing that our work clothes were drenched in dirty, smelly river water.  But now I know that I love kayaking...can't wait to go again!

      So my roommates and I are moving out of our apartment at the end of the month.  For the past 2 months, realtors and our landlord have been showing the place nonstop.  SOOOO annoying, all day long, every day.  The worst is that they call and say they will be there at a certain time and come an hour later, or whenever they want, or a no show.  A couple times, they have called when one of us was in the shower and left a message on the machine saying they were coming with people in 10 minutes!  They once called at 9am on a Saturday morning wanting to come in 20 minutes! They have no repect.    Worst though, is our landlord.  He thinks ringing the door is enough notice.  Once he knocked as he was turning the key, giving us no time to even answer the door.  We ran to the door and a held it shut and acted dumb "who is it????".  We knew it was him.  Grrr.  Then he says he called earlier (Liar), but didn't leave a message b/c noone was home.  LIAR, LIAR, LIAR.    Yesterday after work, I posted a sign on our door saying "NO REALTORS TODAY PLEASE".  You think that would work....nope.  "Knock, knock, knock.  Who is it?  It's "X", the landlord.  I open the door to find him standing there with potential tenants.  He says, I know you have this sign, but they are only in town for today.  Well, hmmm, how about a call, a notice, asking!  I was pissed at him, but the sucker I am, felt bad for innocent people.    So we let them in and tell him that we are fed up with people not coming when they are supposed to or not giving us enough notice.  We were expecting an apology of some sort, but the bastard looks at us and says, "No, that's not right. You need to tell them to come on time and to give you at least a couple hours notice.  Don't let them do that."  OMG!  He does that!!!!!!!!!!!!.  He just did!!!!  I wanted to go off on him, but there were poor innocent people checking out the place.    My roommate and I did get him back though....when he was in another room, one of the girls came into the kitchen and in a whisper asked us what he's like as a landlord.  We told her he just comes into the place whenever he feels like w/o warning and he's very annoying.  She was like, NO WAY, I need my privacy.  If he keeps it up, we will scare everyone away.  Ah, sweet revenge.

       Very quiet here at work.  I think alot of people on the floor are on vacation or something.  My lunch buddy isn't here either, so I sat outside by myself today and read the newspaper.  I also soaked up some sun and got a little color on my arms.  It's a start for my attempt to get a tan this summer.  I prefer to be surrounded by lots of people though, loneliness is one of the worst feelings.    One of my current roommates is leaving Boston for good tomorrow morning.  It's going to be weird not seeing her every day.  I move out at the end of the month.  I've lived here for 3 years now, so it will take some time to adjust to a new place and new roommates.  I'm excited and nervous at the same time.  I found a great place in Davis Square.  I think I will like it there, it's very different from Brookline, that's for sure!  We'll see.  Come visit me peoples!

      Last Thursday Matt and I decided to get a last minute flight out to Cleveland after hearing that his parents' basement was flooded due to a huge cloud burst.  He figured they needed help cleaning up and going through all the storage boxes that got wet.  We got a great deal on the flight on  urlLink site59.com , a site devoted to cheap last minute airfares. We even got a rental car with the package.  Check it out.  So we spent a good deal of Saturday helping out in the basement.  Then Matt showed me all around Cleveland.  We visited  urlLink the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum  which was cool.  Then we toured the rest of the downtown area and had dinner with his parents.  It was nice. They are very friendly and sweet people, making me feel very welcome and comfortable.  We ended the night at one of Matt's college friends fathers bar (got that?) called the Sip N'Post.  Fun night.  On Sunday we took Matt's parents on a hike/Geocache at Ledgers Point.  It was a more difficult geocache than we usually do, but the challenge made it all the more fun. We almost didn't find it, but at the very last moment before we headed out, Matt's determination to find it paid off.  His parents were very excited, as this was their first cache.    After the hike, we headed off to the airport to come back to Boston.  It's nice to be home, but it was great to get away from the city for a couple days!

      After a not so good morning, I decided to get my hair cut during my lunch break.  I wanted a new style, something drastic.  Either my day was going to get worse or   it would make me feel better.  I decided to take Briana along with me for moral support.  So we walked across the street to the salon in the Galleria.    We searched in the hairstyle mags for the perfect do.  I found one I liked, so the stylist went to work.  I got a lot chopped...yes, chopped.  Many layers.  The one thing I stressed was how much I hate the ends flipping outward.  She assured me she would not cut this way.  Guess what, they flip out.  Go figure.  In the defense of the stylist, I honestly think it is just my hair.    I don't hate my new haircut, but I'm not loving it yet either.  I think I just need some time to get used to it.  Briana really likes it, as does my roommate.  Most importantly though, Matt is a big fan.    I just keep reminding myself..."Change is good Meliss".

      Compared to a very boring Wednesday night party with Carole King and Vanessa Carlton, last night's Time Warner/Rock the Vote party was a blast! It was a closed party at the Roxy, complete with the secret service, an open bar and appetizers, and a few famous people. Ben Affleck was there, along with Leonardo DiCaprio and Alyssa Millano. We felt like we were important for being there, haha.     LL Cool J started the concert, which was great, followed by a fabulous performance by Maroon 5. It was like having front row tickets to their concerts. In between, John Edwards came out to give a speech to get people all pumped up. It was very cool.     Having the DNC in town was expected to be a nightmare, but turns out it's great. With over 70% of Bostonians on vacation this week, there is no traffic anywhere, and rockin parties going on

      Alyssa got us tickets to tonight's DNC / Rock the Vote party at the Park Plaza Hotel featuring Vanessa Carlton and Carol King.      Matt got tickets to a party at the Roxy for tomorrow night; All about who you know. Friends who have attended parties earlier this week have reported many celebrity sightings. I'll let you know if we see anyone cool. Maroon 5 will be there, so it should be fun! Check out the  urlLink DNC Rock the Vote events

      Yesterday I stopped at Matt's.  He told me he had a present for me; just a little something, just because.  So I figured maybe a cute little something from Newport.  So I anxiously opened the bag to find an ipod!!!  Holy moly!  Awesome!  I'm so excited, my very own ipod, which hold 5000 songs!  I can't even put into words how excited I am.  As if this wasn't more than enough, he even had it engraved.  Last night Matt taught me the basics of using it and we put over 300 songs on it already.  I can't wait to play with it today and learn more.  It's going to be great for running and the gym!   :) :) :)

      I'm in Diana's wedding next month in New Jersey.  I was supposed to get my bridesmaid dress last week via Fedex, but the bridal shop shipped the dress to my old address.  Shouldn't be a problem, right, because I wasn't there to sign for it.  Wrong.  Diana called Fedex to track the dress and they told her they delivered it to me last week to my old place.  They claim I have a "no signiture required, release waiver" on file, which means I've given them permission to drop off all my packages without a signature.  Hmm, that's funny, I would never sign something which allows them to leave my packages on the streets of Boston.  I am 110% sure I never agreed to this.      So I called Feddex to remove this waiver thingy that they have on file and guess what....they don't have one on file for me.  Gee, I wonder why?  Maybe b/c it never existed!!! GRRR.    Everyone in my old building moved when I did, so I don't know anyone who lives there anymore.  I am hoping someone took the package inside and is waiting for me to come claim it.  I'm worried though, because it rained big time last week and this past weekend, and because it could very well be on EBay as I write this.   Wish me luck, it's not like I can just go to a store and get another.  I have to find the dress before Diana starts freaking out....although I think she already has started to.    And BTW, my roommate found my toothpaste :).

      Saturday I drove down to Newport, RI to meet up with Matt and his parents, who are vacationing there for the week.  Despite the cold and rainy weather, it was so nice to be back in the area, I haven't really been there much since my college days when I was only a 15 minute drive away.  It is by far one of the prettiest parts of Rhode Island.  (See pics at www.photos.yahoo.com/melsac531) We  stayed in a cute bed and breakfast overlooking the water, minutes away from America's Cup Ave and Thames Street, the two major hotspots of Newport.    Saturday night we walked around and explored all the little shops along the water.  Then we ate dinner at the Brick Alley Pub, where we got to watch the Sox beat the Yankees :).  We ended the night over at the Blues Cat Club listening to a cool Aussie band play.    Sunday's weather was even colder, so we decided it would be a good day to tour some of the mansions.  First we saw The Rosecliff, then we followed the Cliffwalk over to the enormous 70 room Breakers Mansion.  Over lunch at the Firehouse Station, we figured it was too cold for a boat ride and we would instead go to the Mohegan Sun Casino in CT.  Matt's parents had never been and were excited to check it out.  Along the way, we stopped off at URI, to show them where I went to college.  It's a pretty campus.  I miss living at the beach when I was in school.    Mohegan Sun was lots of fun, even though I don't gamble.  We sat in a very cool bar, where Matt's mom introduced me to a great new drink, the cocaine lady.  It had Kalua and creme and coke.  It tastes like coffee milk (one of RI's state drinks).  I highly recommend it!  We ended the night at the arcade in the casino, where we all played a little skeeball and got cheezy fun toys with our tickets.  The best was the ring and the chinese yoyo, fun stuff, haha.    Now I am back in Boston, where there is lots of chaos due to the DNC being in town.  I'm just lucky I made it back in town before they start closing off all the roads.

      I would consider myself a tad bit obsessive when it comes to brushing my teeth. I recently bought the new Crest Vivid White stuff that claims to whiten your teeth in about 14 days. I figured I'd give it a try considering I can't use the whitening strips b/c they kill my gums! So i've been using the new toothpaste for about a week now and I'm happy with the purchase thus far.     Today I came home and was going to brush and my toothpaste is gone! I fear my roommate accidently packed it for her 2 week trip to Spain, yikes.  Maybe I just have to go to Spain to get it back...any excuse to travel. I'm due for an overseas trip. Back to my toothpaste though, I miss it already. Looks like I'm off to CVS to get more. Adios.

      So I was browsing though some other blogs via links and noticed that my picture is posted on another blog.  One of Matt's old college friends,  urlLink Sarah , wrote something about  urlLink Matt  and posted a picture of us out at the Pheonix landing a couple weeks ago.  I would like to thank her for the compliments,  even though I have never met her.       Also, Jon is in the latest edition of the  Improper Bostonian  in an ad for the Phoenix Landing.   I wonder if it's from the night we were there?

      Yesterday Matt's aunt was in town from Ohio and met us over at the BeanTown Pub for dinner.  I had already met her on our trip to Cleveland last month, so it was easy.   After dinner we walked her and her friend over to South Station to catch the train back to Providence where they were staying.  It was a nice walk because there was a cool breeze from the water...it was very humid yesterday.   Then we stolled through the Common, stopped off at the Frog Pond for a few where we watched a man in a wheelchair steal all the trash container lids.  No idea what that was about.  Gotta love the city.  We proceeded to  Beacon Hill, and eventually back to the T.       Babe, Matt's jeep, was in desperate need of a good cleaning after having been to  urlLink Camp Jeep  in the Blue Ridge Mtns last week.   So we headed over to the Scub-a-Dub car wash and now she's shiny and clean again.    I want to go to Camp Jeep next year Matt, hint hint ;).

      Yes, I am one of the millions of people who experience digestive discomfort when I eat dairy foods.  We are refered to as lactose intolerant, not lactards...Matt!  Anyhoo, why is it that one always wants what one can't have???      Why am I writing this?  Well, it's because tonight I met Becky at Zaftigs, our usual weekly get together to catch up on each other's latest gossip.   My cravings told me that I just had to have the grilled cheese sandwich, one of my taste bud's absolute favorite meals.   My stomach was telling me different..."don't do it Meliss, you'll be sorry, very sorry."  Of course I chose the grilled cheese.  I usually carry a lactase pill with me, but I was out.  So I ate the sandwich and now I am doubled over in pain.  So my question is this...is there such a thing as a stomach transplant...because if so, I'd like to trade mine in.

      Yesterday my friend Briana took me canoeing.   Jared and Michelle came too.   We drove to   urlLink Foote Brothers  urlLink  Canoe Rentals  in Ipswich, Ma and canoed downstream for four hours. The river takes you through a wildlife sanctuary, where we saw a gorgeous  urlLink Egret  swoop over the water, and beautiful wetlands. I was also able to see a  urlLink red winged blackbird , some turtles, and lots of urlLink  iridescently colored dragon flies . Half way down the river there was an island where we had a picnic.     I was worried at first that the instability of canoes would at some point have me swimming in the river, but Briana and I were pros at steering the boat. I would definitely go canoeing again...it's so relaxing.  That's us in the photo, although you can't really tell.

      I ventured down to Rhode Island yesterday to see my niece and nephew before they left for vacation. My 8 month old nephew, Brenden, looked a little different.    You see, doctors these days recommend that parents put their babies on their backs when sleeping to avoid possible suffocation on their bellies. What they didn't foresee was that the backs of babies heads become flat by doing this. Brenden fell victim to this. So now he has a Cranial Remolding Orthisis, a.k.a. helmet, that he had to wear for several months. Poor baby! Being one of the most good natured babies ever, he wears it with a smile. Look at that face!            And Shelby...

      Yesterday was a very productive day of running errands.  I got a new cell phone (# is the same) and I discovered a great fabric store in Cambridge.  Matt got some very cool fabric that I am going to use to upholster his sofa for his new apartment.  I'm excited about the project.   Later in the evening we went to the free concert at City Hall Plaza.  The Gin Blossoms were playing...I've haven't listened to them since high school. They put on a really great show.  The lead singer was very interactive with the audience, which was nice.  We were standing upfront, right in front of the stage, so it was fun.
