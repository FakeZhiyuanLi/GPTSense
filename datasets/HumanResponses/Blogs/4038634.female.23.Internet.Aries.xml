       I am listening to cool music, the CD called "late night moods", the music just got me thinking about my favorite things, maybe my favorite colors, songs, movies, sayings, ppl, etc. I dunno where to start but I sometimes prefer to be a person of no favorites, cause I believe everything is special in it's own way, and it's unfair to favor something for another, lets just call it things that I particularly like :)  well lets start it like that, what do I believe in, I'll start with my beliefs and I invite anyone who ever reads those blogs to share his/her beliefs with mine! I once reflected about that issue before and wrote this in my diary on the  23rd of May 2003:    " I believe in many things, I believe in omens, in miracles, in the full moon, in lady bugs,in a fresh sunrise, and a beautiful sunset, in the ocean and the sea, in nature with all it's beauty, in animals :), in constellations, in the best of silence, in positive energy transference, in love at first sight, in a baby's smile, in chocolate's effect, in exercising, in adventure, in touching other peoples' lives and changing them for the better, in gifts, in little things that do matter, in dancing, in God who made all this possible"   Today is the  29th of July 2004 , more than a year later, and here am I, I believe in those same exact things :) I'll reflect on each one at a time!   Omens:  those happen to me all the time to show me what I have to do, and which road I should take, funny that just reminded me with the poem the  Road Not Taken  for Robert Frost, a classic that most of us have studied in school, if you ever get the time look it up, it's a cool poem!   Miracles:  I believe they happen all the time, it's just that we have habituated to them happening, so we have stopped seeing them, but the sun rising everyday is a miracle, rain fall is a miracle, and I don't wanna start cause they are countless, I once read that: " miracles have a way of happening to those who believe in them" and I certainly believe :)   The full moon:  that doesn't fail to fascinate me everytime I see it! Only the thought of it makes me smile. Lots of myths revolve around the full moon, although lots of ppl argue, none of these myths are true (or else they wouldn't have been called myths I suppose hahah) but still believe there is something special about it, at least for me!   Lady bugs:  my favorite insects, I love the red ones in particular, I once found one in the plane, I can't remember where I was going, but I gave me a sense of optimism and happiness! The last time I found a lady bug was recently when I was at Fayed, I was lying alone by the pool and I found it in the water,I took it out and had it walk on my body for a while, then I set it free!   A fresh Sunrise:  the last time I witnessed on was at Basata a week ago, I woke up very early and stood at the beach and watched the sun slowly rise, it was amazing!   A beautiful sunset:  the most beautiful sunset I've seen was when I was at Hurgada last Easter, I was coming back from the Mahmeya in a boat and I sat alone watching the the never ending sea, the sunset was beautiful, I 'll never forget that scene, it was truly special!   The ocean and the sea:  oceans and seas resemble life to me, on the one hand they are home for zillions of living creatures:fish, corrals, dolphins, sharks,etc. on the other hand, they go on, never stopping for anyone or anything, just like life, life goes on and the ocean and sea goes on!   Nature:  I just love it, and I completely believe in it, there is nothing more beautiful or organized, everything seems to fit in its place in perfect harmony with all others, colors, sounds, scents, everything!I particularly love the Spring, I was born on the first day of spring 21st of March, and my name is Yasmine ( a flower's name) perhaps that explains it hahahha, I love Jacoranda trees, these are trees that have purple flowers that bloom in spring, the last time I enjoyed them, was last spring when I decided to take a walk alone in zamalek and all the trees where in bloom :)   Animals:  I am the animals best friend, I always had dogs and I have seen them give birth, that was sooooooo touching. My life long wish will be to work in a zoo, or in something to do with the wildlife! I love to watch the pigeons, they are my symbol for freedom, I used to watch them on my way back from college taking el Azhar street, the last time I watched them I was sitting in front of Al Hussein waiting for some friends!   Constellations:  isn't it amazing that the light we see from constelations was transmitted millions of years ago and the light transmitted today will be seen by ppl in a millions of years?! I enjoy gazing at constellations, Urtha Minor, and Urtha Major, Orion (those are the ones that I always depict) the last time I looked at the clear sky was last week at basata!   The best of silence:  well this might sound strange, but silence has a voice and it's voice is LOUD! It's just because we are used to it that it becomes silence, like anything: if you see or listen to something all the time, your mind habituates to it and it becomes silence. The best of silence for me is when you enjoy it with someone else and you both listen to it and know what you're both listing to, this might sound crazy or silly,but remember this is my personal blog, this means I have the right to get silly and crazy hahahhahahaha :)   Positive energy transference:  well energy flows between everything in the universe, we emit energy and are affected by other's energies! I believe if you keep up a positive energy, you transmit it and it becomes contagious. Imagine you're riding the bus and the person sitting beside you in depressed and holding a grim look, you could amost hear him complain although he's silent, what would that do to you? Probably make you irritant and uncomfortable, but what if the person sitting beside u, holds a beautiful smile, if he looks at you, you won't help but smile back, which would make you feel better. I once read the advise : " Always smile when you pick the phone, the other person on the other end will see it" I try to do that, although sometimes I miss hahhahahaha, try smiling to yourself in the mirror when u wake up in the morning :)))))))))   Love at first sight:  well I don't want to sound corny, or a pathetic romantic, and I don't want anyone to say (as you're probably thinking now ;) this is a line from a movie! Yes I believe in love at first sight, or to put it in a better way, I believe the first time you see someone you develop something towards that person: this something could be dislike, like, admiration, disgust, love is a very deep abstract concept that can't develop from first sight, but at least you know whether you could eventually love that person, or it's out of the question hahhahahahhahaa (although I believe nothing is out of the question) but do you get my point here?   A baby's smile:  isn't that the most genuine and innocent smile. Do you know that babies tend to smile to good looking faces? Well at least that's what I knew when I studied child psychology hahhahahaha but seriously, I like to make baby's laugh because I think it isn't an easy thing, because if the baby thinks you are boring he'll never smile to you!!!!!! (if you think you are a boring person perhaps you should practice making babies smile hahhahahahhaha)   Chocolate's effect:  well apart from the fact that chocolate releases special endorphins in the brain that makes us happy, it makes me feel better :)))) what's my favorite chocolate bar?? I dunno I like most of them hehheheeh, lets see I like the Kinder and the the Crunch yummmmmie :)   Exercising:  can't do without it! ever since I've decided to exercise regularly (I can't remember when was that hahha) my life has become better, I just feel I am alive :) my best workout was jogging under the rain, that was sooooooooo much fun:)   Adventure:  I always had the dream of becoming someone who does something risky and adventurous, so what was the most adventure I've done??? Lets see, this one is hard!!!!! Well I think my last year's trip camping in Sinai was the most! No way was that my maximum, I think I have to start becoming more adventurous!!!! Well I to tell u the truth I get a bit scared of some stuff sometimes (now my face is red in embarrassment!!!) well, not everything though, the next thing I want to do is bungee jump, but some more adventurous has to come with me I suppose hehehhehehehe! I remember another adventure I've done, well but I don't want to make this public, lets just call it the "Space Cake experience" hehhehehehehe   Touching other people's lives and changing them for the better:  well this might sound toooo complex, or deep, but the truth is it isn't I mean touching a person's life could be in the slightest thing we do. I once read that every person you meet in your life is for a reason, even if you happen to see that person only once in your lifetime! Imagine you are Stuck on kobry 6 October, your car went out of gas and the bridge is soooooo damn crowded, your car stops and the whole bridge stopped just because of you, "ya rab maye7saleesh keda :))" imagine how would you feel: excuse my French but SHITTY!!!! and that one person stops and happens to have jerken banzine and helps you, u might never see that person again, but imagine if he hadn't stopped for you, you might have still be standing on the bridge till now (of course I'm exaggerating hehhehehehhe) but you see the point! Strangely enough the person that has touched my life and changed it to the better, was one of my girl friends at school, this is a looooooong story, but to sum it up, she gave me the hardest time ever, and managed to make my life miserable for a whole year, as much as I don't wanna see her again, as much as I owe her for teaching me lots of lessons, one of them was: Thank God I am not marrying a Woman (to all men out there,ana far7ana feeko, elbesooona ba2a hahhahahaahah)   Gifts:  these are my favorite :)))))) I just enjoy getting gifts, and I believe a gift is a thought, and that is more important than the gift itself, because it take more than just getting anything, it takes guessing what that someone would like to get and that's the most difficult part. I often spend a lot of time on gifts. the coolest gift I think I ever got was an red metal airplane that I got from Amsterdam for one of my best friends, who just adored flying and hasn't wished for anything except of being a pilot (which didn't happen) I searched all over the country for the plane and all my friends thought I was crazy and laughed at me, until I saw that plane in a shop in Amsterdam and I couldn't help but buy it! Well the nicest thing about gifts is seeing the look on the person's face when he opens it! there is someone out there dying to know what his gift is but hehhehehehehhehe (you get it when you get it) but don't get too excited I am not sure you'll like it, but if you didn't forgive me after all I haven't been knowing you for a long time, so I guess I am excused, I promise the next gift would be better ;)   Little things that do matter:  well I believe in little things, a smile can make someone's day better, a pat on the back, a simple hug when someone really needs it, a genuine compliment (but hey, it has to be sincere, mesh monafqa). Personally, I get very touched by small things that might pass unnoticed, while fancy, big things don't catch my attention!   Dancing:  hehehehehehhehehehehhe have you ever heard the quote that says: " Work as if you don't need the money;Love as if you have never been hurt; and dance as if nobody is watching" that is my motto in life! I am not a good dancer by the way, I once went to salsa classes and I sucked at it, the instructor also thought I sucked heheheheheh and she was like "Yasmine go to the back cause the boys are better than you" hahhahahahahhaha that was sooo funny, but I still love dancing and will continue to dance, I just think that music is the a universal language and that what it does to u, in terms of body movement in response is a kind of magic, when was the hardest time I danced????? GoGo's wedding I think (aywa bel soufara hahahahahah) no there was another time in Gouna where I was dancing all around and everybody thought I was drunk, bas walahy I was SOBER hehhehehehehhe!   God:  I can't say except thank you for everything and He's the most I believe in, I guess anything else I say wouldn't explain this one!  I can't believe I wrote all that, and I don't think anyone will be interested to read it or have the time or patience to go through it all! Well if you have reached this point then thank you so much, I would appreciate it if you leave me a comment, or share you beliefs with me and I promise I'll read through them all!  I guess that's enough blogging, probably I shouldn't be writing for a month! A MONTH: that's too much, maybe I'll write something small tmw hehehehhehehehe :)))) BYE for Now !!!!!!!  P.S. Please excuse my spelling and grammatical mistakes, after all this was just free writing, so I thought it's better to leave out these small errors!

       Life is good to me :) i believe today is my lucky day. I woke up early to drop my brother's German friends to the airport (they have been staying at our place for a week); then i returned home, slept for a while, then went to exercise, up till that point the day was pretty much normal, as a matter of fact, i wasn't at my best of moods, anyway as i was sitting, i recieved a phone call from AUC, telling me i was admitted in the MBA program for the Fall semester, i couldn't believe it! i had completely forgotten about it, especially that i had to get a higher GMAT score, and i have started thinking of pusuing the Sciology/Anthropology degree, i applied for both and was sure i won't be admitted for the MBA, and i'll be accepted in the Sociology/Anthropology, but the exact opposite happened, a week ago i was told i wasn't accepted in the SOC/Anthro program due to my late admission and that they were not accepting any more students, so i decided to forget about my master's for the time being and start thinking again after i retake the GMAT before the Spring semester!       I guess that's the omen for me to take up the MBA program and resolve my inner dilamma! Life is very strange sometimes, but this always happens to me when i am on the verge on making a major decision, something always happens to make me do what i gotta do!        That's what i like best about life, the unexpected, surprises, challenges, and uncertainty. i guess if we knew what would happen the next minute, life would have been very boring, not only boring, but unliveable, i mean who would take a chance on anything if he knew he'll lose! we would have been reluctant to do anything, maybe we even would have chosen to end our lives! i have read a short story by i can't remember either Tawfik el Hakim or Youssef Idrees, it was called "El Ekhtera3 El 3ageeb" it was talking about this new machine that allows a person to see through his future, and whenever someone chose to know, his/her life changed forever and they were no more able to take it, to the extent that lots of them started committing suicide! Isn't it very true??? What if i knew the future, only the thought of it makes me shiver, i am better off the way i am, hoping, dreaming, wishing, trying hard for things to happen!       Anyway, why did i go through this to begin with, i dunno! well if anyone is ever reading this, excuse my blogging, it's just that sometimes a thought comes to my mind and i feel like reflecting on it! i'd better go now before i start into another thought and start  blogging hehehehhehehehhehe :)

       Hi, this is Yasmine. To tell you the truth, it's weird to hear my name, everyone happens to call me with a totally different one! At home, they call me Tootie; my friends call me different things: Jazz, Jazzy, Yasso, Jess, Meena, and Gucci & it's derivatives (the one I love the most :)    The nickname Gucci has a story, actually a very funny one. No it's not about Gucci the brand!!!! Well i was once in White bar with some friends and a friend of mine ordered a dish called "Ganucci a la white" this is a special kind of pasta, but the right pronounciation for "Ganucci" is "Neuoki" not "Gan-ou-chi" as we said hehhehehehe, the waiter then got the dish and he was like "Neuki ala white" so we were like no we ordered "Gan-ou-chi" that was sooo funny, and ever since this friend of mine started calling me "Ganucci", then my friends shortened the name to Gucci hahahahhahahaha, Bregitte if you are ever reading this i'm sure you're now laughing hahahahhaahhaha :))))    Anyway, I find the blog idea very interesting; lots of times I feel like talking, and I keep a regular diary, the only diff erence of course is that the blog is public, so don't expect to find everything about me here, you might get to know me better, but there is more to me, I promise ;)    ok just in case u don't me, I graduated from AUC, with a major in economics and a minor in psychology, I am now doing a post graduate diploma in IT management and intending to start my master's next Spring, but still confused about which program to pursue either an MBA with a concentration in Information Systems or Sociology/Anthropology, sounds like they are two different fields altogether, well I wouldn't have been confused if they were not! Anyway, lets not go into this discussion.      I find the blog idea very interesting, and I have to admit the reason why I created a blogger was that I was tempted to refute on one of my friends' blogs, so I ended up creating my own and still haven't commented on his hehehehhehehe!    Anyway, welcome to my world and my never ending bloggggggggggggggggggggggging :)))

       Hey, that's me again! I am listening to Naseer Shamma's music, this music is sooo inspiring, it just triggers a stream of thoughts in my mind that I can't control or stop. I feel the erge to write and I feel I have sooo many things to say; yet, nothing at all!!! It's wierd, I really don't know what to write but I feel I must have something to say!       Well, the thing about the music is that it combines a mixture of feelings that I feel represents me in a way, or represents my identities! It's sad, yet there is a certain element of hope and freedom in it! There is this melancholy part to it, it makes me imagine I am sitting alone in a closed dark room, where I am in touch with my inner self and stuck to person I really am, and not the one I should be or people want me to be! In some verses of the music I feel it's speaking regret over all the missed chances and the lost times, it purifies you of your sins and makes you vividly see them and get rid of them, at other verses, I hear it chanting happiness and joy, the kind of joy in a baby stepping his first steps and falling to the ground :) joy of fresh beginnings and sweet memories! At other verses, I hear victory and rebellion, rebellion over all the chains and the barriers, sounds of freedom and breaking free!       It takes me through my life and experiences and makes me wonder about all the the things I've done and all the things I'm contemplating doing! I gives me the feeling I am such a tiny bit in that whole grand universe, a grain of sand in a vast desert, or a drop of water in a never ending sea! It's funny how we are sooo weak and vulnerable from inside, no matter how strong, and capable we think we are, we still amount to nothing! I am not being pessimistic here or anything, it's just that I am realizing my true state!       I am sure you all took that Arabic poem at school about the ant and the mountain, we all took that in school, it might have sounded ridiculous back then and we thought what's this nonsense that we have to memories, but if you come to think about it for a while, you'd realize how deep that meaning was. I can't fully remember the verses but it was something like that:  " Khashayat al namla men haybat el taud el mo3azam"  and the story then goes that it started contemplating what if the mountain collapsed on her, and she couldn't help but become terrified! But the thing is if she(I mean the ant here) left herself to freeze into that moment of terror, she would have probably died, I can' remember the end of the poem though, I think she fell in a pond of water or something!      I really don't know why I am writing this, to some of you I am sure this absolute nonsense, but believe it or not to me it means something, it touches a part of me that's tooo confused and lost, a part that doesn't know where to belong,a part that sometimes confuses right for wrong, a part that wants to rebel and break free, that's always critical and refuses to believe we all see the same green! I dunno if that's he insane part of me, I mean I sometimes wonder who's that person talking that people see ass me? Who's the person behind the mask? Is it really me or somebody else, is it another identity how lies within me! I even sometimes think maybe I am living in my own world, and all what I experience and sense is a pure illusion! Imagine if that's true that every single person is living in their own world and illusion and nothing is real or true around him,it's only him and it's all in his head! Only the thought scares me to death!      :)))))) here comes the part of the music where I feel it's speaking rebellion and victory, then the next line is remembering the sad and lonely times but then cheering and waving for the victory!      I guess I'll leave with that thought; I might have sounded crazy, but this is the stream of thoughts that is running through my mind now without any decoration or sweet talk, if you are reading this, then you have stepped inside the mind of a cosmopolitan living being for a while, and got introduced to some of her nonsense or confusions or whatever you'd like to call it!!!

       Hi, been a while since I last"blogged" :) well, I've been writing in my diary though, well I just felt in the mood to jot some things down. Nothing specific though, just free writing!       So what has been going on lately with me? Nothing much, today I went and picked up my acceptance letter for the MBA from AUC, and I got the photography book (I am currently taking photography classes, that's why). Anyway, I met one of my best friends' (Laila) mother, she is an extremely nice lady and she works at AUC, I chatted with her for a while and we agreed to travel somewhere when Laila comes back, she's in Beirut now and she's supposed to come back next Sundy!       To those of you who don't know laila, she's just graduated from AUC with a major in Theatre and a minor in Arabic Literature, she is a very interesting girl, and we have lots in common, I just adore that girl :) Anyway, her mum is also a sweetheart and was really delighted that I met her this morning!      Then I went and had a coffee at Cilantro infront of AUC, then I came back home and then I went out and did some girlie stuff ;) well, for those who know me they know I am not a girls' fan and I think they have a talent for complicating things and if I am allowed to borrow the term "sweating over simple stuff" hahahahhahhaha, but on the other hand I have never regretted being a girl, not that I had the choice hahahha, but seriously there something special about being a woman :)       By the way don't get me wrong, I was never a feminist and I do NOT believe in equality between a man and a woman!!!! Strange to hear that? Well it's true I believe a man is a man and a woman is a woman and doesn't undermine the status of women or dictate they are second degree citizens, on the contrary, I think it gives them pride,charm, and delicacy. I mean, I enjoy being taken care of by a man and I don't mind compromising lots of things for him, as long as he respects me and I am left to do that willingly, there is no point about being stubborn and insisting of taking control, I just see it's a waste of energy and time and it burns the relationship! Did you ever hear the joke:        "If a wife always laughs at her husband's jokes, is he funny, or is she smart?" ;)         Well, it's more important to be smart when it comes to relationships and it's no big deal to do the things that satisfy your partner for you both to be happy, the problem comes in I guess when one is to arrogant to compensate for the other, then it becomes a problem and what could have been resolved in less than a second, becomes a life long dispute!       I think women who believe in equality are too stubborn to accept the truth. It's a fact of life :) But an idea struck me a couple of days ago when I was arguing with one of my friends and it has made me realize a very important conclusion. Well, she thought all Egyptian men are selfish and that she wanna marry a foreigner and that she hates being here. I found myself arguing the other way round and I wished her good luck, it seems she got pissed at my reaction and she thought I was being sarcastic when I was really not! Not to get into much detail about that story, the idea that struck me that I was talking about was:      If you show a person a half full, half empty glass of water and asked him, is this glass half empty or half full? Suppose he said it was half empty, while you said it was half full and you both started arguing? Could you prove him wrong just by proving the glass is half full?      the answer is "NO" because it is a fact that the glass is also half empty!!!!!      What I mean is that some ppl are living in the half empty, while others are living in the half full part of the glass and each hasn't experienced qualities of the other, which make each of them stick to their views and prejudices, without ever trying to consider the other person's world!!! and that is the whole point!      I found it useless to keep on arguing because I discovered we are each living in a separate world, or if I could call it a "bubble", and as much as I was convinced with what I believed about the issue, she was also, so it wa unfair to just impose my views on another!     the whole point out of this story I think is that it made me realize that each of us is living into a closed circle, I am not going into the argument of is this healthy or not, cause it's endless and goes back to the same point of being purely subjective. But, it is at least Constructive in a way that every once in a while we step out of our circles and watch the rest of the players, or even join in others' circles too, we might then discover we are different people all together!

       Hey, it's 10:45 a.m now, I woke up at 7:00 (pretty early I know...... hahha), went to my massage session from 8-9:00, then went and bought a colour negative for my first photography assignment (but I haven' figured yet who's the victim hehehehehhe, guess I'll call one of my trainers in the gym, he's really cool and I think he'd look good in pictures, bas lets hope he agrees hahahahahhaha....That would be sooooo much fun :) Anyway, then I did my usual morning cruise into the streets of beautiful Cairo to downtown and Zamalek, grabbed a coffee from Cilantro and sipped it slowly on my way back, was listening to Sting, my God he's a real artist, I just love his music and his lyrics it's sooooooo damn good!      I got the CD "The Best of the Police and Sting" yesterday evening, it's a really cool one and it has all the nice songs except for my favorite that I still can't find "Shape of my Heart", this is such a cool song and the words are soooo symbolic! I particularly like: "An English Man in New York" "be yourself no matter what they say" isn't that the best line ever, I've always thought about it, do I be myself or conform to what I have to be, some ppl tell me I am very impulsive and that I am too open, but that's just the way I am , I dunno how to play mind games and tricks on ppl, I am just direct and lots of friends think I should be more mysterious u know hhahahahahahhahah well I really don't care, I'll just be myself no matter what they say ;)      Another particular song that I like is: "If you love somebody set them free" I just totally believe in that song and I believe if someone truly cares about someone else they should set them free, this reminds me of the pigeons, I particularly like to watch the pigeons, they are my symbol for freedom, the thing is, if you have pigeons you feed them and offer them shelter and they are free to roam the open sky, the fascinating thing about them is that they always come back home and they never run away, it's choice not chance, they were left to fly and they were free to either come back or leave forever yet they always came back! That's basically love from my point of view, it's freedom and space; it's choice not chance!       well, I don't mean to be philosophical or anything, but it's only a thought that struck cuz I am always the one who listens to endless stories of friends in relationships who are constantly complaining, and I realized that there is a common thread between all the stories, they are all tieing each other in chains, no setting free, always afraid of losing that other person, not realized it was basically that other person's choice to be with them,which means they were free not to get into it in the first place and this has to mean there was something special about being with that particular person, so instead of worrying too much, they can just think what was that special something about them and try t nurture it instead of killing it with too much jealousy and shit, to everyone out there, let me tell you one advise "el gheera fel 7ob khateera hhahhaahahhahahhaha" :)))      Anyway, I dunno why I got in the mood for being a mosle7a egtema3eya? Sociology/Anthropology 3ala Psychology hahhahahaahhahaha, I am going crazy wala eih? la2 la2 la2 ana lazem 2amshy 7alan abl mabtedy 2a2oool ay kalam fel 7amam, hahahhahahahaha, to anyone who read this sorry for that, but there is something about personal freedom that just gets me excited, so don't open this subject infront of me or else mesh hatekhlaso meny hahahahhahahhahaha, anyway gotta go now, see u later :))))))))

       I just realized my yesterday's post was very negative, so i decided i have to write something more cheerful today :))))) it's just that i got unnecessarily affected by yesterday's incident, anyway lets not get into that story again!       So what has been going on? i went to the movies yesterday night, i watched Spider Man 2, i loved the movie, if any of you still hasn't gone, i suggest you go, and if you decide you're going, u can tell me, i don't mind seeing it again as a matter of fact hahahhahaha! there are a couple of other movies that i wanna go see, Youssef Chahine's new movie, one of my best best friends Laila was working on the costume design and Youssra El Lozy is starring in it, theey say she's a babe in the movie, apart from the fact she is a babe in real life ;) so i am excited to see it, also there is another that i thought i'd never say i want to see, but after i saw the preview yesterday i decided i want to go "Ghaby meno fee" or something like that, mesh fakra el 2esm bezabt, starring Nellie Karim, bamout feeha, she's just sooooo funny :) and Hani Ramzy! as for Mohamed Heneidy's new movie, i think it sucks bigtime, i didn't see it bas i saw the preview yesterday, same old jokes and style, khalas zehet men Mohamed Heneidy begad!    I heard mixed opinions on Adel Imam's new movie though, which makes me tempted to go see it too! Eih da ana maro7tesh talaterba3 el 2aflam 3ala fekra! need to start going more to the movies i suppose hahahhaha :)    I watched "The Devil's Own" this morning, my favorite celebrity: BRAD PITT, this actor is just sooo good, ya3ny sebko men eno begad mozza gidan ;) bas begad kaman beymasel hayel, wezareef wekol 7aga, walahy 7aga tefara7 en fee nas keda 3aysheen bas bardo 7aga te7azen: we never get to meet any of them grrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr!!!!!!       anyway, it's 3:45 p.m now, i'll probably go exercise in the evening, then i dunno haven't got any plans yet, i have to finish some stuff for work though, i might be doing those tonight!       anyway ana hamshy ba2a badal ma2abtedy 2a2ool ay kalam hahahhahahhha!

       Shit, i can't believe i did that, i am on the verge of crying! i screwed up her day bigtime!  well,  woke up early and was too bored to sit at home, so i decided to go out cruise, i went out heading first to downtown taking el azhar street, i then passed by tahrir, zamalek, mohandessin, then back to heliopolis through the bridge, on my way back i was listenning to Sting, so i decided to go buy music, i went to a music store in heliopolis, i can't remember it's name, infront of cinema Normandy, i parked my car second row cuz there was no parking,spots, anyway, after parking, my car kept moving slowly backward and there was a car parked behind me, so i used my breaks to make it move slowly, then it stopped touching the car behind me gently without any bruises, i went into the store and as i was inside, a lady came in and was like"excuse me are so you have a Peugeot parked outside, i was like yes, she was like your car has hit my car, it's stuck to it, so i was like no imade sure my car didn't hit yours when i was parking and she was like then come and look, so i went outside with her and here it wass my car stuck to hers, it appears my car has a hook from behind and that hook has penetrated the lady's eksedam and she was very pissed i could see it in her eyes in her tone of voice, so i was like "i am very sorry, but i'll fix it for you, and i 'll do aything you want" so she was like i had just got it from repair cuz someone hit it llast week, i felt soooo bad for her, and put myself in her shoes, and thought: "what if it was my car that was hit? i kept apologising and i told her i know that i knew the word "sorry"could even make her more pissed, but that i was willing to do whatever she wanted and she said ok, so do u know somene to fix it i was like i don't but it's your call, if you know someone or you want to take it to the car's service, anything, she thought and then she was like "bossy khalas" i was like "are you sure" she was like yes, and then guess what she was like "merci lezo2ek" and she really menat it!!!!      Believe it or not this sentance is giving my guilt trips, i can't believe i hit her car and screwed her day and then i get thanked for it! Oh God i really feel like crying hard now!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

       Well first of all thank you soo much for having the patience to read my endless nonsense, and thanx even more for your sweet comment :)       I have decided to write this post to get you started on that blogging issue, well first of all, we have to agree on one thing! NEVER BE SHY to write anything on your mind, even if you think it's "ay kalam" this is the bogging rule number one hahhahaha!       Rule Number 2: you have a punishment and you have to write "i don't know what to write 100 times" ;) and this punishment is for turning me down twice, once last thursday, and the other time yesterday, when we were suppossed to go see that gallery el shaklena mesh hanshoofou! anyway i forgive you bas ba2a el mara el gaya.............................      well, since i can't think of any more rules,then i'll get straight to the point! i am more interested to read about your thoughts and experiences than i am interested in you commenting on mine, of course i'd love to hear your opinion about what i had to say, but i also wanna listen to yours. As a matter of fact, you are the first one to read any of my blogs, i've been keeping a regular diary for about three years now and noone ever reads them, they are my secret little place where i just say whatever, without being embarressed of any kind of criticisim or judgment. Writing online is kinda different and scary cuz now you got ppl reading and criticising you, which makes you feel like revising and editing and thinking "no, i won't write this and i won't write that" cuz what if someone would think whatever of me!!!       well, i felt you had sooo many things you wanted to say, but you were not fully comfortable saying everything outloud, well i promise i'll never judge or make fun of anything you write ok? hahhahahaha akeed ya3ny enta lama 2areit el ana katabto you were saying: " eih el habal da, eih el bent el ta3bana dee" yet you were sweet enough not to say it in my face! :))))))) so being my first ever reader thanx for that!      and no, it's not that i know myself and in fact it has nothing to do with whether you know yourself as a person or not, it a feeling more than anything, everything i wrote i genuinely felt, so allow yourself to just write your feelings and thoughts without any constraints!       so to get you started i'll try to ask you some questions, that u might wanna answer, which wll lead to more thoughts, ie. more blogging, something to break the ice!       i'll allow myself to ask questions, but this doesn't mean you have to answer them, i mean you say whatever you want,you might even pretend i never asked you anything hahahahhahahhahahah begad i respect other ppl's personal spaces! i like your new nickname on msn by the way and i thought that this was going to be the beginning of your blog, but turned out it was not! but since i am a curious cat just like someone 3ala raso bat7a that i know hhahahahahha :) i am curious to know about: fishing's,floating, glowing, stairing, breezing, and sleeping from your point of view, i mean you got me excited to read the book just by reading the title, but then u gave me no book hahahahhahahahahaah, fa batal te3mel feya keda and tell me about those :)))))))))))) pleeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeez khalas khalas haskot!    Anyway, it's very interesting to know you're not a soccer fan, unlike the majority of guys, i think this is a unique thing in it's own because it allows u to explore other things that might interest you and not become fixated or preoccupied with one single thing: SOCCER!!!!! hahahahhaha so what are your hobbies by the way? i mean the things you usually do in your free time (if you ever get free time i suppose :)      Also you said there were things you liked in my blog (ana tab3an leya elsharaf:) so what were the things that caught your attention most, and more importantly i think what were the things you disagreed with me in! as much as i like ppl liking what i say, i am also interested in the disagreements and the arguments! i feel i am asking too many questions here and that i am being a i dunno, i can't find the right word, 7aga zay bent rezla bas walahy i am only trying to break the ice with you and to get you relaxed to start BLOGGING!!!!!!!      to tell you the truth suddenlly i lost the point of this blog and i dunno why i am writing it, i am thinking of deleting it actually, bas e7teraman lel blogging rules that say we don't delete anything even if we think it's stupid, i won't !!!!!      anyhow, i can't wait to read your thoughts and ride that "huge future machine that you are driving" as u described in your comment!   by the way that was a very expressive comment that makes me feel i am about to witness a Giant blogger ;)   bos ana 3arfa eny raghaya weghalabaweya fa 2a7san 2amshy ba2a hahhahahahhaa bye ya wa7eed ;)      P.S. don't forget to write your punishment :)
