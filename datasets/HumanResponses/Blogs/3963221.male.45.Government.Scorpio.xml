       urlLink Small is Beautiful by Larry Brown & When You Have a Modest, Simple Boat, You Can Sail at the Drop of a Hat by Don Casey   More on the subject of boat size.   When ever I start getting big boat lust,  I pull these two articles out to remind me of two very important fundamental truths so eloquently stated by Larry Brown and Don Casey.      One: "The use a sailboat gets is in inverse proportion to its size"      Two: "The essence of sailing is that moment when all distracting thoughts are lost in a straight wake, when rudder movement is directed by the inner ear, when sail and heart swell in concert. To experience this magic you need only a slippery hull and a decent sail."   When I keep these two items in mind,  that big boat lust rapidly gets back under control.  So if you are having problems with big boat lust, try reading these articles.  I think it may help.

       urlLink Sailing Small- Sailboat Restoration and Repair   People always say that sailing is a "rich mans" sport.  If you look at Cruising World, or Sailing World, or at most of the new boats that you see at a boat show, you would think so.  I mean really,  who can afford some of the monsters that they feature.  These bigger 35+ foot babies will set you back $150k+ ( heavy on the plus depending on the builder).  Add in insurance, slip fees, maintenance, etc.... well it certainly is a whole lot more than I can convince the spouse that we need to spend.        However, you don't need to spend  huge sums of money to be able to sail.  While this may take a bit more mechanical skill than a lot of us possses, this web site shows what you can do with a little imagination, some elbow grease, some time, and a relatively small investment in cash. It's an amazing transformation, check it out!

       urlLink United States Boat Shows - Annapolis Sail Boat Show 2004   Well, it's time to get ready for the annual pilgrimage to Annapolis and the "tribal" gathering.  The first year Rebecca and I went to the show, and looked around at the crowds, the realization hit us... we really were associated with part of a demographic!  Boy was that a shock for two people who took pride in thinking they were otherwise a marketers worst nighmare by being unassociated with any particular demographhic.    If you have never been to Annapolis during the boat show, it's an amazing sight.  There is every type of boat ranging from small inexpensive racing dinghies to multimillion dollar ocean cruising yachts, along with any type of equipment and all of the nautical nick nack's that you could ever want, on display and for sale at special reduced boat show prices! (I'm serious about the reduced prices, you can get some VERY good deals).  And if you didn't bring the cash, not to worry- the banks are there ready to fiance your purchases.  You can even get a new Volvo to drive home in!   Well, it's only a matter of time before we REALLY become full fledged members of the demographic.  The problem is there are just so many boats, and so little money :-).

       urlLink CTS-Catalina 250    One of the possibilities for "Boat 2" is a Catalina 250.  urlLink Catalina Yachts  provides information about the Catalina 250, but this site is a virutal cornucopia of information about the Catalina 250 that you can not get from a sales brochure.  While it still doesn't provide a definitive answer to the question, "what should Boat 2 be?" that I'm wrestling with, it sure does provide some helpful data!  Speaking of which.... have YOU found an answer to the question, "What is the best option for a new economical small cruising sailboat?"  If you've come up with an answer, how about dropping me a line!

       urlLink Expanding the Scope of the National Emergency Relating  Movement of Vessels Into Cuban Territorial Waters   This first fell into the "You have to be kidding" category. Then, after I read it, it fell into the " God, you HAVE to be kidding" category. After I read these two sections from the Presidential Proclamation signed by Geroge W Bush on 26 Februrary 2004 I sat in amazed disbelief.   "Section 1. The Secretary may make rules and regulations governing the anchorage and movement of any vessel, foreign or domestic, in the territorial waters of the United States, which may be used, or is susceptible of being used, for voyage into Cuban territorial waters and that may create unsafe conditions, or result in unauthorized transactions, and thereby threaten a disturbance of international relations. Any rule or regulation issued pursuant to this proclamation may be effective immediately upon issuance as such rule or regulation shall involve a foreign affairs function of the United States. "   Sec. 2. The Secretary is authorized to inspect any vessel, foreign or domestic, in the territorial waters of the United States, at any time; to place guards on any such vessel; and, with my consent expressly hereby granted, take full possession and control of any such vessel and remove the officers and crew and all other persons not specifically authorized by the Secretary to go or remain on board the vessel when necessary to secure the rights and obligations of the United States."   I spent the better part of the first half of my professional life as a naval officer combating the Soviet communist threat. I never have had any desire to visit communist Cuba, not do I plan on doing so in the near future. In fact, any thing that helps further the defeat of a communist regime  would normally sound like a pretty good idea to me. This, however, is one of those exceptions. The implications of this Proclamation are actually frightening.  Look at it like this.  From Key West to Cuba is about 90 nautical miles- an easy sail for most cruising sailboats, and manageable by micro cruisers like a West Wright Potter 15 or open dinghies like my Flying Scot with some preparation.   Under the provisions of this proclamation, the government can sieze *ANY* vessel that is *potentially* capable of reaching Cuba that is located in *ANY* US territiorial water at *ANY* time at the governments discretion.  Not only that, the government can sieze the crew and detain them without warrant.  When you consider all the coasts, rivers, and lakes that constitutes US territoral waters, we're talking about a whole lot of water across the US most of which is no where near remotely close to Cuba.  Pretty open ended basis for search and siezure.   Last time I looked at the Bill of Rights to the Constitution, the 4th Ammendement still said:   "The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized."   I'm beginning to wonder about this "War on Terror". What do we need to fear more? What the terrorists are planning to do, or what those who are "proctecting" us from the terroists are actually doing.

       urlLink The Joy Of Small-Boat Sailing  Jack London is best known for his books about stories of adventure and the struggles of man and nature,  Most famous for novels like "The Call of the Wild, White Fang, and The Sea-Wolf, and short stories, such as "To Build a Fire" and "The White Silence." , he was an avid sailor and owned several vessesls; the Razzle Dazzle; the Spray; the Snark; the Minota, and the Roamer. In this article, from the August 1, 1912 issue of "Country Life in America"  he talks about small boat sailing and how it make sailors.  A sailor is, as London describes, "the man who will take a fabric compounded of wood and iron and rope and canvas and compel it to obey his will on the surface of the sea."    Small boats today are mostly fiberglass and aluminium, and nylon and Dacron, but I'd like to think he would write the same thing about small boats and sailors today that he wrote about over 90 years ago.

       urlLink Welcome to Operation Lifesaver  Carnage on the Rails- more rail crossing accidents this weekend that did not have to be. Operation Lifesaver is a national non profit program first founded by the American Assoication of Railroads, Amtrak, and the Railway Progress Institute designed to teach rail crossing safety, promote active enforcement of traffic laws at crossings, and improved crossing guard technologies in an attempt to prevent crossing accidents. Why is an oganization like this important?   Okay, Lets talk about stupidity, I don't just mean simple stupidity, but stupidity that makes a rock look like it was Albert Einstein!  What am I talking about?  I'm talking about the idot who tries to run a railroad crossing when a train is approaching.    You're in you're car, approaching a marked and gated railroad crossing when the crossing lights begin to flash red and the crossing arm begins to come down.  What do you do?   If you're a normal person, you slow to a stop, wait until the train passes, the crossing arm goes up,  the light stops flashing, and then proceed with caution.  But if you're one of the intellectual heayweights who has pea gravel for a brain, (assuming you have a brain and aren't already a zombie) you accelerate then swerve around the lowering gate. If your lucky you make it to the other side.   If you are not so lucky, the last sound that might penatrate through to what ever it is (or soon to be was) that passes for your brain you'll hear before you and your vehicle get crushed like an aluminum beer can by the on coming train is the blarring locomotive horn. The train crew will throw on the emergency brakes, but at 55 mph it will be over a mile before they bring the train skiding to a halt further along down the track.  And don't worry about your survivors bearing the expense of an open casket funeral, when the rescue crew aririves, they might actually be able to scrape enough of you out of and off of the wreckage of your vehicle for the mortician to do something with.   While there is some grim humor in this, unfortuately this scenario is ALL to real.  Working at the Federal Railroad Administration, I get to see fatality reports for all crossing accidents in the United States and by and large they all similar to this. These reports don't have to happen and Operation Lifesaver is working hard to help try to prevent them.  With your help they can succeed- support them!  Look, Listen, Live!

       urlLink US Sailing - Online Sailing Course and Lessons  Once again the news has another story of the gene pool working to cleaning itself with a boating accident.  As usual, it invovled people getting themselves into a situation beyond their capabilities due to a lack of training and experience.  And every time it happens, it puts other people at riask.    It never ceases to amaze me.  In order to drive a couple thousand pounds of steel on the highway we require that a person have demonstrated at least a miniumn working knowledge of the rules of the road, and a modicum of vehicle handling capability.  Yet when it comes to a sail or power boat, we usually don't require any sort of education or training before the person takes it out on the water.  This is beginning to change at last in some states, where proof of training is required.  However it's not always mandatory, and there is no uniform minimum standards.  While this web site is no substuite for formal training and education, it does provide a minimum level of basic information about small boats, keelboats, crusing, windsurfing, and powerboats.  More advanced formal training and education can be obtained from a number of places: US Sailing, the US Coast Guard Auxiliary and the US Power Squadron.  It's cheap, it's fun, and it just might keep you from being a reduction in the gene pool.

       urlLink Cape Hatteras Lighthouse Live Cam Shots - National Park Service, Cape Hatteras Group   My wife's been on about the dangers of zombies recently.   Although this is offically a "Lighthouse Cam", isn't it a bit suspicious that this part of Cape Hatteras is known as the Graveyard of the Atlantic.  Could the National Park Service have set this Web cam up as part of a covert government effort to provide an early warning system of an invasion of the undead from the sea?  Maybe the National Park Service is really the public cover for a secret government agency dedicated to the detection and eradication of the undead, and that the US government knows something we don't?  Regardless of the presence of the undead, or lack thereof, it's still a nice view.
