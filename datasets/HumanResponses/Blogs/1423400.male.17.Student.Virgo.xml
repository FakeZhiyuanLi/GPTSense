       Sunday, April 27, 2003    I Hate Minnesota:  Yeah, pretty self-explanatory, Minnesota sucks, and so did the refs at that game.  They blew our chance to bring the game into OT.  Oh well, Canucks in 5 haha.  Yeah even though it is monday morning, I will consider this a Sunday blog, (I was away from the computer, watching the game today!)  Work was alright, they started me on fry right away, even though im supposed to be on salad, I think I managed pretty well for my first day working.  When I have my first full shift, that will be interesting, damn I hope all the waitresses aren't 19, I don't think I would fair to well if they were all that age.  Well not much else to say right now, I'm going to bed.

       Gee:  Yeeha! Work finally starts tomorrow, me needs the cash.  Oh yeah, bye-bye iRiver mx-400, those negative comments and ordering online, with all those support problems swayed me to look at the new Sony and Panasonic models, and for 174.00 that new Panasonic SL-CT700 slim mp3/cd player will soon be mine, ohhh yeah! (that's in canadian dollars too!) So I figure instead of paying possibly over 300 dollars, just to get a fancy remote, case, and car kit, I could spend like half that, and at the same time pick up like 5-6 new cds.  Daaaaaaaaaaaaaamn, I hope musicfest gets put back on track so we can go to Toronto, its the last trip i'll have with the grade 12's.    I really miss my sweetie... I just miss her sweet self so much its frustrating.  Getting back to seeing how hard it is to find a girl makes me appreciate Carrie even more that we're not together... I need to find a way to be with her again.  Unfortunately unless she has a car soon, I won't have a car until July or August.

      I've had a lot to think about lately,  a lot...  I mean I know what I want in a girl now before I will make a serious commitment, but i'll still have fun, a large part of learning from all the people, or girls I meet.  So the adventures (or mis-adventures?) will continue, things are looking up haha.

       Well, Well, Well...  Ah great, I finally manage to get my parents to let me go to Toronto, and the morning after, the school board imposes a ban on travelling there! Whoop-de-freakin do.  Oh well, at least Guilliver's is running now, and funk night is coming up, woo! Game 1, Minnesota vs. Vancouver tomorrow night!!!

       And Suddenly Things Got More Interesting:  I found out that Carrie-Ann still has feelings for me, it's just that the distance got in the way, so she doesn't feel as strongly as before.  However, when she has her car (whatever time that may happen) she probably would want to see me again.  The problem lies ahead, between now and then.  I don't know if i'm going to meet someone else, and what If I end up hurting Carrie myself?  I'd hate myself if that happened.  She said "if you want to see other people, I guess that's okay" now if I look at this carefully, I know she'd be somewhat hurt if that happened.  Sigh, but I haven't picked a direction yet.  I don't know what's going to happen, I guess this is how life keeps moving.

      Ah damn the weather, when it's not raining non-stop, you think it's warm enough to wear shorts, but then again its still too damn cold.  I wake in the morning, and when there are no clouds im like "gee, its going to be a nice day today!" 2 hours later, pouring rain.  And it works in reverse, when it looks cloudy, it clears up by the afternoon.  Or sometimes it just stays cloudy, eeep.  Thanks god those chem worksheets weren't for marks, I would've beens screwed.  Oh yeah, and Game 7 today! Yes!

       Weekend Review: Sigh...  Yeah, so here I am...by myself.  I guess i'm not really devastated about losing Carrie-Ann, but more confused and disappointed.  I really do miss her, the way she talks, the way she laughs, the way she acts so sweet all the time...man.  I really don't get it...I don't think I did anything wrong, sure things weren't working out that well right now...but, I thought if we still felt the same way about each other, we would find a way to work things out.  But Jen raised an interesting point...her boyfriend can drive, but she can't, yet they see each other often enough.  Now I can't drive, but Carrie can, even though she doesn't have her own car.  What I dont get...is that why she didn't make a big enough effort, to just borrow her mom's car once, head over here, so we could be together.  I mean I would've done it all the time even though it wasn't my car, and certainly forget about other less important plans.  Like what could be more important than running off to see the person you love?  But i'm afraid this is where things get even more complicated, she said before about how she's never felt this way about a guy before.  So right off the bat, I know this is new to her, love is something she hasn't experienced before.  I have however, and I got broken the last time I fell in love with a girl, which granted did teach me  a lot.    One of my teachers raised an interesting point to me earlier this year, while she was talking about all these married couples divorcing, how people shouldn't get married unless they've had their hearts broken at least once.  And that really makes sense to me, because then you really get a feeling of what love is, and you're more prepared before you dare make that commitment a second time.  I just...I really wish I could finally be with someone who does understand, who's loyal, loving and trustworthy.  I guess... Carrie lacked those qualities despite how sweet a girl she is.  That really disappoints me, maybe its a high-school thing?  People still are growing up, and lack the experience, that some others already have.  So next time, I won't let myself be fooled again, and haha raise my standards to that bar.  Because, without trust and maturity, its just like constructing a paper bridge...if she were to come back to me, and prove that she's trustworthy...i'd give her another chance in second...(not sure if that'll happen though.)  Well, I think i'm ready for the next challenge/girl (haha) already, I catch on pretty quick nowadays.  Where does that leave me now? Geez, I don't know...I figure I just need to gather the rest of my thoughts and feelings, and chalk it up on the board.  I don't really need closure, I just want to know what went on in her mind.  I want to look her in the eyes, and see if she really does feel different, because i have no idea what to make of this, sigh...

      Well what a crazy-ass weekend its been! Obviously some higher power feels like they gotta screw around with people. First of all, my 'nucks are back! 3-3 Quarter-Finals tied! Game 7 monday, woooooooooooooooooooooooo! Gotta love Bert haha. My shirt smells like smoke, (bonfire the other night, drugs are bad kids) yeah and my girlfriend Carrie decides to break up with me for some weird reason, all of a sudden like a couple days ago she decides she doesn't  feel the same  about me anymore! I mean what the hell? I figure she's some flitty/fickle person who lacks a lot of maturity like some people tell me. Which leads me to feel that I didn't do anything wrong! Oh well, that makes me feel better to know that I'm normal, and yet again, another girl i've dated, isn't. And the normal ones always end up friends, or nothing really happens.  I have a feeling Karen still wants us to get back together, but hmmm, I might put that thought off until summer.  So many girls out there, so many have issues...geez. So it's back to the single life, until I finally find myself in a real strong relationship.  Jen made me drink the other night, I told her there's no way im drinking, but god-damn I don't know how she got me to in the end. This isn't over! But I wasn't drunk at all, no really, I guess I was buzzed, but drunk? I don't think so...Yeah I wasn't drunk.  Damn people with perfect pitch, it just makes me...so jealous!  Man, I could really go for some IHOP right now, mmm, delicious warm crepes and pancakes with that butter swirls mixed in with real fruits.  And a choice of 5 syrups...oooooooh.  Gulliver's better start work soon, I needs the cash to get my cd player, and pay some other bills, they just keep coming!  God monday night tv sucks, cbs and their lame comedies, like that one, "baby bob" where the freaking kid talked like an adult, and suddenly knew about everything going on in the world, and acting all smarter than everyone else.  What the fuck is wrong with cbs for them to churn out crap like that? God!

       Sometimes:  I just don't have a clue about what goes on in girls' mind, it was kind of a blend of different feelings the other day in seattle. Seeing Carrie kind of reminded me that, I do in fact miss her dearly.  But Mike raised an interesting point on the way home, not the "all girls are crazy" but how even he has issues with Jen, like, stuff I didn't know that he was even concerned with but yeah, it's there.  He doesn't know what he's going to do either.  Well, so this made me realize, even if Carrie and I do get back together, like what's the chance that more problems aren't going to arise?  Like aldergrove is a looong way away from white rock, it's like a freaking boonie town.  Who could stand living there?! Sigh, so this makes me realize a whole new set of problems, plus the fact that I dont think Carrie would view me as her top priority, even before I doubt she did, because yeah, if i really was a priority to her, then I would probably have seen her often enough while we were dating.  Right now I figure, there's nothing really to do, I'm gonna go back to playing the field, because the distance just isn't worth it with her.

      I thought about writing another letter to Carrie today; asking for an explanation. To be honest, my images of her are fading fast, and the only reason why I would want to see her right is now it to satisfy my memory and curiosity. No idea what i'm going to do yet, I guess i'll wait to see if she writes or calls back first. Yeah, I miss her. But what can I do about it, i've already started moving on. I've heard the phrase "don't worry, there's plenty of fish in the sea." Well, that may be true, but how many of them will I be able to catch, when I don't know what bait to use? I believe some of it is luck, and being at the right place at the right time. Hahaha, of course with me, it's always being lost in the middle of nowhere at any time. It's not that im not attractive enough, have personality or esteem issues, its just a matter of having the luck. I'm sure i'll catch a break soon enough, all patterns begin somewhere and eventually end.  _______ lied to me, and I think she's purposely avoiding me; because I know she lied, I know how selfish it was of her to do so and she probably feels ashamed. Boy some people... I always sensed she was mentally off, but tries to act stable.  Bleh, had work again today. It actually went pretty fast, working with Stephanie and Jen. I swear none of the faces I serve will I ever remember again, they just don't stick; i'd be useless after witnessing a robbery or something. I do know this one young woman, soy-milk decaf latte; she has wavy brown hair, a nice smile and just looks absolutely adorable. She's not as some may categorize as 'hot' but she is charming in a sweet way. I know all the 24 flavours we have on rotation...yay me! I'm starting to get the hang of this biz. I served this cute girl and her friend, and I was thinking where do I know her from. I asked her, "did you use to work at gulliver's grill?" and her face lit up as she looked up at me and exclaimed in surprise. She didn't recognize me in my spiffy new uniform; turns out Hayley is working at milestones now. She's a really sweet girl, that's one of the things I miss about gulliver's, all the servers and hostesses. Perhaps i'll return to the restaurant scene as a server myself when I turn 19. Note to self: Get in touch with Kimberly sometime.  My god, is anyone else worried about the age kids begin to desire sex appeal? These two girls who were barely 12 were wearing crop-tops and short-shorts, it really weirded me out. Another strange thing I saw was this couple, a girl who looked 13 with this guy who was at least 19 or 20. I had to try so hard not to look weirded out.  I am absolutely obsessed with having to buy some crazy gadget/mp3 player/cellphone these past few weeks. www.gizmodo.com has only been fueling that obsession with random things of no real purpose. The new iPods were released on monday. I'm reluctant to get one still, because of lack of additional features, like fm radio/recording, and extended file support. However the 12 hour battery life makes things a bit more appealing, just a bit. Which leads me into this week's cool thing of the week!  The palmone treo is looking mighty fine nowadays with its impeccable multi-day battery life...except it lacks the following: bluetooth connectivity, and a megapixel camera. Sorry but 0.3 mp just doesn't cut it. Oh yeah...and the fact that it costs freaking $800 puts a damper on my spirits. But toss in a 3.0 camera and bluetooth and I am SO sold. Whew...what a long post. &nbsp; urlLink     urlLink
