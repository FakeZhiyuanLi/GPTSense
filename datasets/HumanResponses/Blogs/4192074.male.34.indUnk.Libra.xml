      Andrew AKA    Burty  Sheriff  Lee Majors  Your friends lovely  Chancher  Maverick  Worlds biggest  Trusthouse 40  Marco’s Rhoddy  Social hand grenade   What Andrew lacks in talent he more then makes up for in lack of talent and cheekyness.  He excels at social functions. Armed with a smile, a glint in his eye, an air trumpet and a flamboyant Russian dance no stage is safe.  Andrew’s hero is David Hasslehoff. Tragedy struck Andrew when he once met the man at a C-Rock convention. Andrew has also had other bad luck in the form of two major industrial accidents caused by faulty engineering and the misfortune of being born with a distended back.  Andrews hobbies include, insurance claims, hot nails and tyre treads, rape seed oil and cold houses.

      Pat AKA  TFC Macky Moose Hairless Kiwi Mr P Mr T Mr C Pat Island Patch Adams Fort Apache The Cat CastorKing Beefstock BOF (or any day)   I once asked Pat what car he thought he most resembled. He replied “Probably a Nissan Micra Convertible kid. Nothing on top, no hidden extras and no redeeming features!!”.  Ha Ha, yes that’s Pat!! Not a very funny man but very honest about his somewhat limited abilities.  He has a face that only a mother could love. A tempered brow, a proud chin and a cruel nose. But deep down he’s truly a humble if not lazy man. Who else would keep a bottle on one side of the bed to save on water bills and his hair on the other to save time. What a character!!  Patricks hobbies include dancing badly, golf, lying down, football badly, Ju Jitsu, food, and lying down. His favourite films are Ealing comedys and he likes nothing better than watching Babs Winsor over a nice bottle of red wine.

      John AKA  JTA Forest Dump One way Hitch hiker Shandyman Fit but sh*t Careful John Old Eyebrow Thief of Old Baku Town Ming The Healer Molborine Oil Baron Keith Baron Obese  John is a talented man and is the only person I know who can peel an orange in his pocket. Reliable, loving, charismatic, generous; he’s none of these.  John’s hobbies include shaving, golfy golfy, running from fights and throwing away beer in nightclubs. He’s a pro –European and loves to make new friends from around the world including Darnall, Donclystan and Cuddeth.  When John’s not lying down he likes to take time to relax. One way in which he does this is to wear contemporary, bohemian fancy dress outfits including a Stevie Wonder Elvis number, a confused Vietnam veteran and a glove brother.

        Jamie Johnson  AKA  Jamie-Lad Kenneth Freddie Jim Johnson Jnr (Triple J) Laz-E-C*nt UB40 TUSC (That Slow Useless C*nt) Mr Slice Clown Shoes The White Carlton Palmer Pluto His Fathers Son  What can be said about this man that has not been said before? (Certainly not “He is a c*nt” – that has been said on many occasions!). In the realms of the clutch he is a legend in lycra. But it is not just good looks, wit, charm and intelligence that he lacks. There are many other qualities that should be shared with the world….    This man can produce an uncanny impersonation of the dead homosexual singer Freddie Mercury. In fact, to facilitate this talent, he has had two, count em, TWO Freddie-esque lycra body stockings made. Both of which have seen extensive use!  He loves golf and enjoys nothing more than losing to his good friends.  He has an extensive collection of stuffed monkeys (at 32 years old for goodness sake). His favourite was christened “Mr Pickles” and goes everywhere with him in his car.  He is, by far the laziest man alive, oh yes, this lad can kip.  He is his fathers son and slowly but surely is metamorphasizing into him.  He has a double crown and is definitely thinning on top.  He lives with his lovely girlfriend Julie (tough luck girls!).  He enjoys masturbation (don’t we all?)  On the positive side, he never breaks the speed limit whilst driving. In fact he rarely exceeds 30mph.  He is the proud owner of a “Johnson Nose”.  There you have it. A quick synopsis of Triple J. For a more extensive background you will see much more of him throughout the site.

      It was once said about a young man that he was a credit to his mother. Well time and place wait for no man and that young Gentleman is a fully grown. As with all things, expansion is key, and this is no exception.  Six letters, but they mean so much. Credit....sadly no longer. Credibility.......Its an issue, but in this he is not alone. Five other individuals stand in his way, five men who on their day all have had certain credibility issues.  I like chinese is a testamony to those boys. Its a league, but not one you want to win. Watch this space for more on what it takes to get a top five spot and how if you're not careful you can get relegated to the Unibond league (No premiership player should ever be seen in the lower leagues.........)
