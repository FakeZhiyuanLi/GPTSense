       On the outskirts of the town of Furukawa, the blind masseur and master blade-slinger Zatoichi encounters one-armed Chinese martial artist Wang Kang and a young boy.  Discovering that the pari are on the run from the corrupt local Samurai, murderers of the boy's parents, Zatoichi agrees to guide them to a nearby temple.  Unforutenately, things are never that easy fro the blind man, as he becomes entangled in the struggle to save not only these two, but also the lives  of the people they come across.  When the situation worsens, Zatoichi may discover that his greatest enemy is not the men sent to kill the party, but Wang Kang and the lack of a common language between the two of them.  As the crisis escalates, the two master swordsmen will find themselves in a confrontation where only one will walk away alive!   OK, first, when will bandits learn  never  to try and ambush Ichi while he is walking through tall grass?  The last two hundred guys that tried that ended up dead.  Will they never learn?  The movie starts showing a family of Chinese performers traveling in Japan.  This was interesting because they were speaking Chinese, so on the right side of the screen there was the Japanese subtitles running vertically.  So I was distracted trying to read both the English subtitles and the Japanese subtitles.  I gave up quickly though.  The family meets and befriends Wang, who is going to a temple to demonstrate his martial arts.  The group ran into an official procession, and like the other travelers on the road, prostrated themselves.  You just did that when samurai went by, or else... Well, the son of the performers had a kite that blew towards the procession and he rushed after it.  Bad idea.  One of the samurai was about to cut him down when Wang sprang into action.  Well the samurai go berserk and start killing everyone, including the performers.  The samurai want no witnesses.  You might be wondering where Ichi comes in.  Right about now.  He finds the boy wandering and helps him.  Eventually, Wang, after doing some kung fu ass-kicking, finds Ichi and the boy.  Well, it seems Wang only speaks Chinese, so there is a lot of miscommunication between he and Zatoichi.  Some pretty funny stuff.  They end up hiding at the home of a family, who witnessed the slaughter, but escaped.  About that time a gang boss enters the picture.  Damn gang bosses!  This boss wants to find the fugitives because if he does, his gang we be allowed to assist in the fief's procession to the capital, Edo.  Being given this honor will raise the rank both of himself and his organization.  Long story short, the boss finds out that the family is hiding Wang and the boy and kills the family, all but the daughter, then tells her that Ichi sold them out, something she eventually passes on to Wang.  So more misunderstanding ensues, though not of the humorous kind.  It is very, very deadly.  It was pretty interesting to see kung fu alongside Ichi's sword.  Apparently  urlLink Yu Wang , who played Wang Kang, was famous for playing the One Armed Swordsman in a series of kung fu movies, so having him meet Ichi was a big deal at the time.  I liked the character of Wang Kang, and the scenes where he and Ichi try to communicate were very good.  There was a bit of a cheesy, heavy handed moral of "if only we could understand each other, we could get along," but despite that, it was a good movie.

       No good deed goes unpunished for Zatoichi, the blind masseur and master swordsman.  After delivering the baby of a dying woman and fulfilling her last wish to take her infant to the town of Shiobara, he finds the father missing and must leave the child with his aunt, Oya-e.  Immediately taking a liking to the young woman, he resolves to help her when her inn is turned into a brothel by Tetsugoro, the local yakuza boss.  Things take a turn for the worse when Zatoichi fights to have the performers at the upcoming festival perform without yakuza taxes.  Enraged by his audacity, Tetsugoro puts a price on the blind man's head.  Meanwhile, the baby's father, Sataro, returns home, and a misunderstanding results in him blaming the masseur for his wife's death.  As the danger on both sides escalates, Zatoichi's sword-cane will fly and the blood will flow into the streets!     urlLink Zatoichi At Large   is the 23rd movie in the series.  It starts with Ichi coming across a woman who had just been attacked and robbed.  She is very pregnant, and the stress of the robbery has put her into labor.  The blind man helps deliver the baby, but the woman dies, though not before telling him to take the baby to the town of Shiobara, taking it to her husband.    In the town, Ichi finds that the baby's father is not there, but his sister, Oya-e is.  He visits her, dropping off her newborn nephew.  She admits she never met her brother's wife (he and his wife lived in another town), that he was supposed to be coming with her.  Ichi decides to stay in town until the father of the baby arrives, so he can tell him in person what happened.  While staying in town, he befriends the local constable, who ran out the last yakuza gang from his town.  Of course, the very next scene has another yakuza gang marching in.  The Boss, Tetsugoro, has bought up all the villager's debts, and turns the inn, where Oya-e works, into a brothel.  If the villagers cannot pay, he takes their women to work in the brothel.  Oya-e borrowed money when her father was sick, 1 ryo, but now they say she now owes 20!  She is sure her brother will arrive the next day with the money and save her... you can pretty much see where this is going.  The wife had the money, and had it stolen from her at the beginning of the movie...   The yakuza boss in this one is a real scum-bag.  The bosses usually are, but this guy was particularly slimy, but this kind of villain is great, because when he gets his comeuppance, you really savor it.  The constable turns out to be a very cool and honorable man, more than willing to overlook Ichi's criminal past because he feels the blind man is doing good for the people.  There is also a ronin, hired by the Boss, who turns out to really like and respect Ichi and his skill.  Of course, that means they must fight to the death.  Naturally.  And, best of all... monkeys!  There was a group of performers in the town for a festival, and a sarumawashi, a monkey trainer.  Very cool.  Yet another solid Ichi movie.  Come for the lightning fast sword work, stay for the monkeys.

      Yesterday was our final iaijutsu class until the fall.  All twenty some-odd deshi wandered over to a park near sensei's house where we practiced for about two hours.  We started with  hyaku giri , one hundred cuts, which turned out to be more like  ni hyaku san juu giri , two hundred and thirty cuts.  Each of us got to use the HUGE, Musashi style  bokuto .  It is a monstrous wooden sword, both long and heavy.  I'd like to get one.  Then we worked on two-way cutting, then four-way.  We then broke off into groups lead by the senior students and worked on   urlLink happo giri  .  Then, we learned a very cool new eight cut practice.  It uses the eight basic cuts, and has the coolest ending sequence EVER.  James says that he has it down pretty well, and is going to go through it with Tammy and I.  It'll be a cool thing to work on over the summer.  After that we went back to sensei's and did tameshigiri, test cutting.  We got to use a  shinken , a live swords.  It was a bit intimidating, but very cool.  We had rolled tatami mats on a post, and got a few swings at it.  I sucked on my first few tries, but kinda got a feel for it.  It's amazing what a real sword  urlLink can do  even if only to a rolled mat of rice straw.    Then there was a BBQ, with all kinds of tasty foods and drink.  I tried some  imo jochu , which is a kind of japanese alcohol made from sweet potatoes.  It was pretty good... had an interesting taste.  So all and all, it was a good day.  The weather was beautiful and it was not too hot.  Though, I did get a bit of a sunburn... my head and nose are bright red, and I just know they are going to be hurting soon.

      Last year on Japan's NHK network, they showed a weekly historical drama based on the character of Miyamoto Musashi.  Thanks to my friend Chris, who has satellite power, I got to see a handful of episodes.  It was pretty cool, especially the actor who played Musashi, Ichikawa Shinnosuke.  I later discovered that he is a famous kabuki actor, and just recently took the name of Ichikawa Ebizo XI.  Check out this article on  urlLink Japan Times , and all will be made clear.

       In a town where women are bought and sold, Zatoichi stumbles upon a secret organization headed by Yamikubo, the Dark Imperial Lord.  The "Boss of Bosses," blind like Zatoichi, takes and interest in the messeur, guiding him on the path of destiny and the duty of the sightless.  However, a chance encounter with two beautiful women might be the end of Zatoichi, as both a jealous husband and the town Yakuza want his head!     urlLink Zatoichi and the Festival of Fire   is the 21st movie in the series.  The Dark Imperial Lord!  Sounds ominous eh?  Turns out he is also blind, and while at first seems like he is an OK guy, he turns out to be very evil.  The movie starts with Ichi trying to help a woman who was bought at a slave auction to escape.  He can tell that she is a woman of higher rank and is confused as to how she got into such a circumstance.  Her jealous husband, a ronin, shows up as she slips away in the night.  He, the ronin, assumes that she has slept with Ichi...  Later, after meeting the Boss of Bosses, Ichi meets a woman at a gambling house and immediately falls for her, searching around for her in the town.  It is usually the other way in Ichi movies, with the women falling for him.  It was a nice change of pace to see him pining for the woman. Of course, she is not exactly who she appears to be.  There is one set piece that really stands out; a bath house fight.  Ichi is ambushed while bathing, by thugs sent by the Boss of Bosses, and the ensuing fight scene is one of the best in the series.  It's also pretty funny because all the combatants are naked, so some creative filming was done to cover that up.  Ichi proves that he is as lethal with a katana as he is with his signature sword cane, and the blood in the bath is used to great effect.  There are a couple of other nice scenes, one where Ichi draws and cuts one of the underling's tea cup while he is still drinking.  The other is a game of go between Ichi and the other blind man. It starts out serious, but quickly becomes silly.  Oh, and the opening credits with Ichi trying to get away from an overly friendly dog had me laughing out loud.    All things considered, this was a pretty good entry in the series, if for no other reason, the fight at the bathhouse.

       Kyoshiro is drugged and kidnapped for the pleasure of the Shogun's degenerate daughter, Princess Taka.  Features the famous ambush at the public baths!     urlLink The Sword of Adventure   is the second movie in the Nemuri Kyoshiro series.  Of course, I watched it after watching the 4th movie.  D'oh!  Well, this kind of movie series does not really require that you watch things in order.  The story begins in Edo, just before the New Year celebration. Kyoshiro meets an old man, and saves him from an assassin.  It turns out the old man is the Shogun's Finance Commissioner and has made a powerful enemy.  The Commissioner has suggested that the regal daughters' allowances be cut, saying that the money could be better used serving the people.  One Princess, Taka, used to a life of wanton luxury, is not pleased and wants him dead.  Problem is, Kyoshiro likes the old man, and takes it on himself to look after the Commissioner.  After she encounters Kyoshiro, Taka finds that she both loves him and wants him dead.  Just his luck...  I think I liked this one better than   urlLink Joyoken  .  It didn't have all the trippy, religious stuff in it.  It was pretty straight forward, and had an excellent supporting cast.  Plus, we get to learn a bit more about Kyoshiro's famous "Full Moon Cut Technique."  Starting from the bottom, he slowly draws a large circle with his sword.  It is said that by the time he finishes the circle, his opponent will be dead.  I was uncertain about this series after seeing the 4th movie.  There was good stuff in it, but it didn't really draw me in, like this one did.  I wonder if I'll be able to find any of the others?

       KIRU!   Yesterday in iai class we did some test cutting, or tameshigiri.  Sensei strung a clothes line across the dojo and hung a section of newspaper from it with clothes pins.  We then worked on doing straight cuts on it with our iaito.  They have no blade, but you can still cut newspaper.  Well, some people can.  My cut was a bit sucky, just a little on the bottom.  James was the man, and cut it in twain!

      I have found that I am learning some strange Japanese by watching all these jidaigeki.  Well, maybe not strange, just different.  Things I might not have learned elsewhere.  Here are some examples:   Han and Cho:    Han  is odd,  cho  is even.  These are called out during dice games, of which I've seen about a dozen in various Zatoichi movies.  Two dice are thrown in a cup onto a mat, with the cup covering them.  People bet on han or cho.  Of course Ichi listens to the dice and can tell if they are han or cho, and also if the dice are loaded.   O-samurai-sama:   You hear this one a lot, or a variation, o-samurai-san.  As I mention in my   urlLink O   post, o is often used as an honorific before a word.  San or sama is an honorific added at the end of a word, so in these cases you get an honorific sandwich.  Mmmmm... honorific sandwich....   Kiru:   This is the verb that means "to cut," which, in the days of the samurai was also used to mean "to kill," for obvious katana related reasons.  You usually hear it in this sort of context:  	Boss: You have been humiliated by the blind swordsman.  What will you do? 	Ronin: Kiru! (Kill him!)  I'm sure there are others, but those are the ones that came to my mind.  If I think of any more I'l post them.

      Here's another bit of interesting language stuff from J-list.com.  I knew about some of this stuff, adding "o" at the beginning to "soften" the word, or give it honorific status.  And now I know a word never to say if I'm on Japanese TV!   Related to Japanese polite speech is the honorific "o" that goes in front of some words to give them a higher status. Words like money (okane) or relationships like mother or grandmother (okaasan, obaasan) take the honorific "o" -- it could be translated as "honorable" in English, but of course it's never translated blatantly like that (thank God). It's interesting to notice the patterns of words that take this "o" -- words having to do with death or Buddhism tend to take it (otera = temple, okou = Buddhist incense), yet words related to Japan's Shinto religion usually don't. English loan words never get the special "o" prefix, either. Adding the honorific "o" to words sort of "softens" the word, so words related to children or babies tend to take it (omaru = child's toilet, omutsu = diapers, oshiri = a cute word referring to a person's rear end). Men often put the honorific "o" on one of their favorite words, which is the only bad word in Japanese (e.g., the only word they wouldn't let you say on TV). The word is "manko," and in its honorific form, "omanko," which refers to a female reproductive organ.

      A few weeks ago, we had a shodo class at the dojo.  Shodo is basically Japanese calligraphy.  The kanji used in the word are the ones for "writing" and "way", so shodo is "the way of writing."  I've been interested in it for a while.  Back in the conversational Japanese class that sensei taught, we did a little shodo, and I thought it was pretty cool.    A friend of sensei's, from Japan, is a ranked shodo master.  I think she is 4th  dan , but I may be mistaken.  She gave us some very basic exercises to work on.  It was cool, we worked at low tables set up in the dojo, sitting in seiza.  Well, I should say, I sat in seiza until I could no longer feel my feet, then switched to cross legged until I could feel them again.  We learned enough strokes to make a very simple kanji in shodo, in this case "dai" or "oo", which means large or big.    In the fall, sensei hopes to have monthly shodo classes.  I'm there!

       When a local gambling house kidnaps some peasants because they failed to pay their debts, a rival gambling house pays their debts and sets them free.  But it's really all just a ploy to enlist Ichi's aid in eliminating the competition.  Once that's been attended to, the master of the surviving house of chance grabs more and more power -- and more and more cash from the hapless farmers.  Even and blind man can see that justice must be done!     urlLink Zatoichi the Outlaw  , the sixteenth movie in the series, is the first produced by Katsu Productions,  urlLink Shintaro Katsu's  own company.  There is a shift in tone, at least it seemed that way to me.  It was a little darker... there were two character suicides, some limbs chopped off, tons of blood, and a decapitation.  Quite a change from the previous movies.  The movie starts with Ichi entering a village, and encounter some farmers in the fields singing a song about giving up gambling and drinking, something the blind man thinks is strange.  The farmers are being taught by a philosophical ronin who is teaching them better farming techniques, as well as how to be better people.  Of course the town is having troubles; there are two gambling bosses. each wanting to lure the farmers to their casinos.  Ichi ends up befriending one the the bosses, whom he respects as being a man of justice, and takes out the other boss and his gang.  It is a wonderful scene; a storm is rolling in... thunder and lighting... then Ichi shows up like the rage of a storm.  Well, this other boss turns out not to be the man of honor Ichi thought.  He gets involved in the government, and you know how  that  goes... A year later Ichi returns to find things worse than before.  The ronin-farmer has been arrested and is to be taken to Edo and tried as a traitor to the Shogunate.  Ichi comes to realize that the ronin is the honorable one, but it might be too late...  It's a pretty good Zatoichi movie, not the best, but it has some interesting characters and fights.  There are a couple of nice Ichi moments.  One is in a gambling house and involves the old "quick draw/cut the the dice trick."  The other has Ichi killing a moth with a spit toothpick, unnerving one of the gambling bosses.  The blood is pretty cheesy, basically red water, but it is the first one with this level of bloodshed.  I'm sure they'll get better at it.

       A fugitive christian "saint" (female, of course!) and a sadistic drug-addled princess both have their eye on Kyoshiro.  The fact that a bunch of ruthless smugglers also want him dead is the least of his problems!   This is the  urlLink 4th movie  in the Nemuri Kyoshiro series, and the first I'd seen.  I'll admit I'm not well versed in the mythos of Kyoshiro, but I did find a bit on the net as well as what was revealed in the movie.  Kyoshiro is a half-breed ronin (his mother was Japanese, his father a foreigner) who was conceived during a Black Mass.  Huh.  Don't see that very often in jidaigeki.  These movies take place during the time when the Tokugawa shogunate was cracking down in Christianity in Japan, so it is a central theme, especially in this  particular movie.  Well, that and Kyoshiro cutting down a lot of people.  He's a damn fine swordsman.  The plot revolves around a group of smugglers, bringing contraband, including opium into Japan from China.  They use a doctor of the Inner Court of the Shogun to take drugs to the above mentioned sadistic drug-addled princess, the daughter of the former shogun.  She's pretty messed up.  Really likes killing people for fun, having Christians crucified, killing the men she has sex with...  Of course, Kyoshiro reveals her for the monster she is.  There is also a plot involving Kyoshiro taking a piece of jewelry to the Virgin Shima, a "saint", for a Christian he saved, but was later killed.  The man told him, before dying, that the Virgin knows the circumstances of Kyoshiro's birth.  Apparently, he does not know much about his past.  And another thing about Kyoshiro, he's kind of a dick.  Sure he helps people, but he is the typical jidaigeki ronin...he looks out for himself, and rarely does anything unless there's something in it for him.  I was surprised and pleased to see  urlLink Tomisaburo Wakayama  in this.  He's the brother of Shintaro Katsu (Zatoichi) and also famous for his portrayal of Ogami Itto in the  Lone Wolf and Cub  series of movies.  He plays a Chinese master of boxing in this movie, and his showdown with Kyoshiro on the deck if a smuggling ship is excellent.  I hope to see another Nemuri Kyoshiro movie later this week.  I think it will be the second in the series.  More later...

      Tonight we had the last of our "Saturday Night Cinema" viewings at sensei's house, and we watched   urlLink Budo: the Art of Killing  .  What a pleasant title eh?  It really isn't as gruesome as the title suggests.  In fact, it is a documentary from the late 70's about the fighting arts of Japan.  It covers everything from kendo, karate-do, iaido, to aikido and lots inbetween.  Apparently, some of these arts had never really been seen in the West, or little was known about them.  Of course, we were all very interested in the sword-work.  Some amazing stuff with live swords, and the cutting... man, the tamashigiri (practice cutting) was phenomenal.  Actually, a lot of the karate stuff was sweet too, and painful looking.  If you are interested in the Japanese martial arts and can stand a cheesy 70's soundtrack, try and hunt this one down.

       When winds of change sweep Japan, overthrowing three centuries of Shogunate rule, Gonzo, a peasant, enlists in the Imperial Restoriation Force, which promises to reform the oppressive practices of the past.  When the advance guard approaches his home town, he convinces his commander to let him ride ahead and prepare the locals for the advent of the New World Order.  When he triumphantly rides into town wearing the Red Lion Mane of office he borrowed from his commander, he expects a warm welcome, but gets far more than he bargained for.  His friends think he's going to save them, the incompetent local officers think he's after their heads, a secret band of Shogunate fanatics want him dead and he can't even read his own proclamations!   urlLink Mifune Toshiro  stars in this hilarious epic of a man, a plan, and a large red wig!   I admit I was a bit leery when I read the above on the back of the video tape.  I was expecting some sort of silly movie.  Sure, there was  silliness, but also a great deal of seriousness.  Mifune plays Gonzo, a peasant's son who rides into his home town wearing the Red Lion Mane, and turns everything upside down.  Problem is, the boy ain't quite right in the head.  You see, there was this persimmon tree, and well, when Gonzo was younger he fell out and landed on his head and he's not been quite right since.  Mifune plays Gonzo with a certain dimwitted glee, and pulls it off.  I wasn't sure how Mifune would be playing a comic character, but it was perfect.    A lot has gone on the village since he left... well he didn't exactly leave by his choice.  In fact everyone thought he was dead.  The corrupt officials are even more corrupt, raising taxes to the point where many of the women in town, including Gonzo's love, Tomi,  have been sold into prostitution in order to get the money to pay them.  Once Gonzo shows up and see how thing are, he sets about changing them.  He is after all a high ranking official in the Imperial Restoration Force, right?  That is pretty much the premise of the movie, with the first half having most of the humor, and the second half becoming deadly serious.  A couple of other characters really stood out for me.  One was the pickpocket, Sanji who is rather proud of his ability to count in English, and does so at every opportune moment.  He also suspects that not everything is on the up and up with Gonzo, but follows him nonetheless.  The other is the ronin hired to killed Gonzo, but always gets interrupted, or changes his mind.  Gonzo cannot seem to figure this ronin out, and ends up calling him a "weirdo" during every one of their encounters.  The ronin is the most insightful of the characters, pointing out that the only difference between Shoganate control and Imperial control is the design on the crest they wear.  No matter who is in control, the peasant is still at the bottom.  As I mentioned earlier, there is more than just comedy to this movie, much more.  There's some good fight scenes with some real gushers of blood, and some decapitated heads thrown in too.  In the closing minutes, the dimwitted Gonzo become a true hero to the people, which of course, he thought he was all along...

      So tonight we learned the rest of  tsuka hazushi .  After you flip teki onto his back, you do a reverse draw, which is rather funky and is going to take a while until I feels "right", then pin teki to the floor with the tip of the sword.  Another cut is performed, then the typical zanshin (awareness) sequence is done.  Not too bad really.  Except sensei acted as teki again, grabbing the sword, letting us throw him.  Then we had to do the draw on him.  Granted, our swords are not sharp, but they have a sharp point that we were pointing downward at his chest.  A little nerve-racking.    Oh, and we did the kata with him  really  holding on to the sword, like an opponent actually would.  It was hard as hell to do the kata, to get him off balance, but it was a good exercise.  Next week, our last regular class until the fall, we are going to go over all six kata that we now know.  I'd better get practicing!

      I guess I should explain Iaijutsu a but.  This first selection is from a brochure about Tamiya Ryu that sensei put together:   Iaijutsu is a Martial Art (Bujutsu) that strives to supress a sudden attack by the attacker (Teki) against the defender (Aite) using a single, swift stroke of the sword.  Iaijutsu assumes that every attacker uses a Japanese long sword (Nihon-to) and seeks to master the various principles of drawing and re-sheathing the sword, attack, defense, etc.   Furthermore, Iaijutsu is a Martial Way (Budo) based on the doctrines of Buddhism.  As it is said: "The Sword and Zen act in unison."  Iaijutsu practices its techniques with a humble and modest heart and continually trains the spirit.   This next explanation comes from a handout sensei gave us last year, adapted from an article in the program for the "Ginza Holiday" Cultural Festival in Chicago, Illinois, August 15-17, 2003.   Iaijutsu is very commonly referred to as the "Art of the Sword" because one studies how to smoothly and gracefully draw and cut with the katana, or Japanese long sword.  However, the more literal breakdown of Iaijutsu illuminates its deeper purpose.  "I" means "to be" or "to sit" and "ai" means "harmony" while "jutsu" means "art."  So together Iaijutsu can be viewed as the Art of the Harmony of Being.  The Iaijutsuka (practitioner of Iaijutsu) practices not to defeat others, but rather to defeat the things within them that prevent their self-development.  Iaijutsu is practiced as a series of kata (or forms.)  Each kata begins with the individual calmly sitting or standing with their sword sheathed.  Then, one or more perceived assailants suddenly attack the individual.  The individual must draw his sword and perform a cut or series of cuts to defend themselves.  Once the perceived assailants have been deterred, the sword is cleaned and re-sheathed.  In the midst of all this action and perceived conflict, the iaijutsuka must retain the calm state of mind they had while sitting or standing.  In addition to its meditative focus on calmness, Iaijutsu also emphasizes awareness, precision, efficiency and centering related to handling the sword and the self.  Other aspects include manners and respect.  Iaijutsu can be studied alone but it is very complimentary to other arts, such as tea ceremony, calligraphy and flower arranging, and is often taught alongside Kendo and Aikido.

      For a little over a year now, I've been practicing  urlLink Tamiya Ryu  iaijutsu.  In that time I've learned a lot, and had some ups and downs in my training.  I'll be the first to admit that I really need to practice more, but lately I've been cracking down on myself.  It hasn't been too hard, mainly because we've started learning some really interesting stuff.  That is not to say that the stuff we learned before was not interesting, it's just the new things have really clicked with me.  For one thing, we have learned  kiri oroshi happo giri , cutting in 8 directions.  Up until this point, all of our cutting practice has been straight line cutting; that is to say, we would step forward and cut.  In all the kata we have learned so far, that is the kind of cut we perform, but sensei wanted to spice things up a bit.  Now we do a cut, then pivot to another direction, do another cut, pivot, etc.  Very cool.  Many of the later kata use the pivot, and he thought it would good for us to start leaning it.  We have also leaned cutting in 4 direction from a kneeling position.  Also cool.  While I like the multi-directional cuts, I still need to work on it... sometimes I get a bit off balance.  Just gotta work on it more.  The thing I really like is the 6th kata,  tsuka hazushi .  The basic premise is that teki, your opponent, has grabbed the tsuka (hilt) of your sword.  It is your job to shake him off.  It's a really interesting kata, that is very aikido like, ending with teki being flipped onto his back.  We have only learned up to that point so far.  Tomorrow in class we will learn the draw and cut.  I'm looking forward to it.  Another thing sensei has had us do is go outside the dojo and work on cutting practice in the side yard.  OK, cutting while wearing zori (sandals) in grass, not easy.  Sandals get all twisted around and stuff.  I hope it gets easier with practice.

       Two of Japan's legendary actors star in this classic tale of greed and misfortune.  Zatoichi the Blind Masseur ( urlLink Shintaro Katsu ) revisits a village he has fond memories of, only to find that much has changed.  Drought and famine have caused the village to fall into the hands of the evil Kobotoke Clan, run by Eboshiya Yasuke's eldest son Masagoro.  Eboshiya's other son has married into the respectable family that runs the Shogunate Mint.  The respectable son is debasing the coinage, the father is hiding the loot, and the eldest son is trying to steal it from both of them with the help of a wandering Yojimbo (bodyguard) named Sasa Daisaku ( urlLink Toshiro Mifune ).  Zatoichi's keen intuition leads him to the center of the conspiracy and ignites the family feud.  Swords will slash, battles with rage, and blood will flow when Zatoichi meets Yojimbo!   First, I guess I should say a few words about Zatoichi.  He is a blind swordsman, and masseur.  And a bit of a gambler.  A scam artist really.  A yakuza.  But, he has a code, and is not keen on innocents being harmed.  The Zatoichi movies fall squarely into the  yakuza geki  category, with quite a bit of swordplay thrown in, with Ichi as the classic anti-hero.  This is the 20th Zatoichi movie, and is commonly know as   urlLink Zatoichi Meets Yojimbo  .  Yes, the famous Toshiro Mifune is in this, playing a yojimbo (bodyguard), but it is not supposed to be the same character from  Sanjuro  or  Yojimbo .    It starts with Zatoichi going to a village he'd visited a few years earlier.  It was a peaceful place, a place where Ichi believes he can go and get some rest, get away from all the bloodshed and violence that seems to follow him everywhere.  Well, it would be a pretty sucky Zatoichi movie if he found such a place, eh?  Of course, the village is overrun by gangsters, gamblers and thugs.  There is a lot going on in the plot and it took me a bit to wrap my head around it.  The yojimbo is a bit of a drunkard, who has a thing for the female lead, who is a prostitute.  He plans on getting enough money so she can buy out her contract and become free, free to leave with him.  There is an old man, and friend of Ichi,  who used to be the mayor of the town, but now makes jozo statues to set the souls of the villagers, who died in a famine, to rest.  Several other interesting, morally deficient characters round out the cast.  There is something to do with the official mint, and gold being siphoned away from it.  Oh, and a cool samurai character who is equally deadly with a katana as he is with a pistol.  And why does he seem to know the yojimbo?  Truthfully, Mifune steals the show.  He has such a presence and swagger when he is on screen, and his scenes with Katsu's Ichi are wonderful.  In one very memorable scene, the yojimbo plays a bit of a prank on the blind man, who we discover has a fear of heights after he has to visit a client on the forth floor of a house.  It was a cruel prank, but it had me laughing the whole time.  Also the way the yojimbo mockingly says "sensei" back to his toadying employer, Masagoro, is priceless.  Even though this movie is late in the series, it would be a good introduction to the Zatoichi movies.  It incorporates many of the elements of previous Ichi movies, but that is a good thing.  And having Mifune is just an added bonus.

      A nugget of lingustic fun from Peter Payne over at  urlLink J-List :   "There are a lot of words that the Japanese invent that are fun to learn. One word that most fans of anime learn pretty quickly is the "H" (the letter H), which when pronounced with a Japanese accent sounds like "ecchi" (also written "etchi"). Said by some to stand for the first letter of the word "hen-tai" (which literally means "perverted" in Japanese), the word "H" is basically used to describe any kind of steamy situation or overly amorous person. If a person thinks about sex too much, he is "ecchi," and a popular euphemism for having sex in Japanese is "H suru" (literally "to do H"). Whatever its origin, "H" (ecchi) is a part of Japanese culture and language, be it in anime, manga, television dramas and so on."

      Alexanian Sensei, a fellow jidaigeki geek, lent me a movie last week at iai class, called   urlLink Gohatto   in Japanese, translated to  Taboo .  He gave me a bit of a warning... the subject matter was not traditional jidaigeki fare.  Well, that was quite an understatement.  The major theme in  Gohatto  is that of homosexuality among the samurai class, a topic not often explored.  It takes place in 1865 among the Shinsengumi.  The Shinsengumi were stationed in Kyoto, and were a sort of elite police force for the shogunate.  The story revolves around Sozaburo Kano, a rather effeminate young man with exceptional fighting skills, who becomes a member of the Shinsengumi, and arouses desire among some of his peers and superiors.  A rather interesting turn of phrase that shows up quite a bit during the movie is "lean that way", to refer to the those that desire Kano.  The story takes a darker turn when some of the men who love Kano start turning up dead, and a mystery takes shape; who is killing these men and why?  I actually rather enjoyed this movie.  It had exceptional swordplay, and it was interesting to see homosexuality explored in this historical period.  Though, I think that the true theme of the movie is that of lust and power being destructive forces.  Kano uses the lust that others have for him to give himself more power.  Also rumors play an important, and again, destructive role in the film.  Obviously, I don't want to give too much away.  The acting was very good.   urlLink Ryuhei Matsuda , who played Kano, has a mesmerizing look about him, but there is danger beneath the surface.  Also of note, is  urlLink Beat Takeshi , who plays Toshizo Hijikata, a Captain of the Shinsengumi, who understands the dangerous undercurrent of jealously among the men where Kano is concerned.  Takeshi is a famous director, who recently wrote, directed, and stared in   urlLink Zatoichi  .  This is from Amazon.com.  I think this editorial review sums it up more elegantly than me:   This fascinating, gorgeous film examines homosexual passions among the samurai of an 1865 militia. Taboo centers around a young samurai named Kano, whose smooth face and soft beauty makes him an object of desire. Rumors about who might be his lover lead to a love triangle, dazzling swordfights, and a mysterious murder. The story is intriguing enough, but what makes Taboo even more striking is that the heterosexual samurai treat their comrade's queer leanings as possibly dangerous, but only because of the potential for jealousy and inflamed passions--there's no sense that they see it as unnatural or even unmanly, in striking contrast with the American military view. Japanese superstar Beat Takeshi plays a samurai captain struggling to maintain order in the ranks.

      So what exactly is  jidaigeki ?  Basically it is a Japanese period movie, usually set before the Meiji restoration (when the Emperor was reinstated, thus ending the age of the Shogun.)  As such, they are stories about samurai, historical persons or events, even legends and horror stories.  Most people in the West are familiar with the jidaigeki works of  urlLink Akira Kurosawa .    urlLink Seven Samurai  ,   urlLink Yojimbo  ,   urlLink Hidden Fortress  , and many others.  Under the heading of jidaigeki there are three sub-genres:  sengoku jidai , movies set during the Sengoku period of Japan (1490-1600);  ken geki , sword fighting, or  chambara , movies;  yakuza geki  or gangster films.  Of course, sword-fighting is integral to all of these types, which is why the blanket term of jidaigeki is usually used.  It is my plan to discuss and review various jidaigeki on this blog.  I am by no means an expert on the genre, nor have a seen more than a tiny fraction of what is out there.  I just enjoy watching them.  And talking about them.  Oh, I should mentioned that the name of this blog,   urlLink Ame Agaru  , is the title of one of my favorite jidaigeki.  Actually, it's one of my favorite movies, period.  More on it later...

I would do the blog on stuff that I'm interested in, namely Japanese stuff. Specifically, iaijutsu, jidaigeki and Japanese language and culture.  I will go more into each of those topics soon, when I'm not blogging from work...

       Hiroshi Inagaki's acclaimed Samurai Trilogy is based on the novel that has been called Japan's  Gone With the Wind .  This sweeping saga of the legendary seventeenth-century samurai Musashi Miyamoto (powerfully played by Toshiro Mifune) plays out against the turmoil of a devastating civil war.  The Trilogy follows Musashi's odyssey from unruly youth to enlightened warrior.  In the first part,  urlLink  Musashi Miyamoto  , the hero's dreams of military glory end in betrayal, defeat, and a fugitive lifestyle.  But he is saved by a woman who loves him and cunning priest who guides him to the samurai path.  This installment won the 1955 Academy Award for Best Foreign Film.   I've had this DVD for a year now and finally watched it.  Now I'm going to have to break down an get the other two parts.  Yep, the movie is a trilogy, and this first part sets the stage.  We are introduced to the wild youth, Takezo (who later becomes Musashi.)  He talks his childhood chum, Matahachi, into joining him in the army in search of honor and glory.  The two run off, Matahachi leaving his fiancee Otsu behind.  They soon find out that there is not as much glory or honor as they thought.  They survive a huge battle, and hide with two bandit women, a mother and daughter, who scavenge the bodies of the dead warriors for weapons, armor, and other valuables.  After a battle with a gang who wants a cut of the women's loot, Matahachi runs off with the women, leaving Takezo to return home.  He does, but finds that he is a fugitive, hunted by the local authorities.  The only people who seem concerned for him is Otsu, Matahachi's heart-broken love, and Takuan, a buddhist priest.  Matahachi's mother blames Takezo for taking her son away, and want him to pay.  And Otsu finds herself falling in love with him...  The movie is based on the novel  Musashi  written by Eiji Yoshikawa that was published in serial form from 1935 until 1939.  I have to admit, I have the translation of the book, but have not read it yet.  It about one thousand pages.  Maybe at some point I will read it.  The book, and movie, is the fictional account of the famous real-life Japanese swordsman,  urlLink Musashi Miyamoto , author of the famous Book of the Five Rings.  As usual, Mifune is excellent, but I really liked Kuroemon Onoe who played the priest Takuan.  Actually, the scenes with the two together are some of the best in the movie, as the kind, but wily priest tries to convince Takezo to become a true warrior.  There is not much more to say about this, as it is the opening chapter.  Hopefully I will get to the see the other two soon...

      I found a cool site called  urlLink Zen Stories to Tell Your Neighbors .  There are a few dozen short zen stories, some of which I'd heard before in longer form.  For instance, there is a short version of one of my favorites about the tea master and the swordsman:    A master of the tea ceremony in old Japan once accidentally slighted a soldier. He quickly apologized, but the rather impetuous soldier demanded that the matter be settled in a sword duel. The tea master, who had no experience with swords, asked the advice of a fellow Zen master who did possess such skill. As he was served by his friend, the Zen swordsman could not help but notice how the tea master performed his art with perfect concentration and tranquility. "Tomorrow," the Zen swordsman said, "when you duel the soldier, hold your weapon above your head, as if ready to strike, and face him with the same concentration and tranquility with which you perform the tea ceremony." The next day, at the appointed time and place for the duel, the tea master followed this advice. The soldier, readying himself to strike, stared for a long time into the fully attentive but calm face of the tea master. Finally, the soldier lowered his sword, apologized for his arrogance, and left without a blow being struck.

       Zatoichi is a blind wanderer who makes a living by gambling and giving massages.  Behind his humble facade, Zatoichi is a master swordsman.    In a gambling joint, Zatoichi and trustworthy young friend Shinkichi meet up with a couple of geisha.   Okinu and her sister Osei have come to town to avenge their parents' murder.  Sinister henchmen are soon hunting down Zatoichi.  With his legendary sword cane at his side, Zatoichi's path is destined for many violent showdowns...   First a bit about this review.  I'd seen this movie a few months ago, but did not write a review for a few reasons.  The conditions under which I watched it were less than idea.  The group I saw it with was filled with a peanut gallery who commented and giggled throughout, making it difficult to absorb the movie.  Secondly, early that day I had eaten something that did not agree with me, and the second half of the movie had me in massive intestinal pain.  Last month I picked up an overseas dvd of the movie, and finally got around to watching it again.  Sadly, Shintaro Katsu passed away in 1995.  Noted director and actor  urlLink Beat Takeshi  takes over the mantle, playing  urlLink Zatoichi  as well as writing and directing the movie.  He plays the masseur much differently from Katsu, but I kinda liked his Ichi.  In this movie, he is very enigmatic, mysterious.  He does not talk much, but his actions speak for him.  Many of themes and scenarios are lifted directly from the earlier movies, which gives the movie a feeling of familiarity.  One thing Takeshi adds is a lot of humor.  There are a few real laugh-out-loud moments for me.  The main story is that of the geisha trying to avenge the murder of their parents.  They have been systematically hunting down and killing all those involved, and after their paths cross with Ichi, it becomes his cause too.  I should, at this point mention Ichi's sidekick, Shinkichi.  He's a gambler, and a bit of a goofball and it is his scenes that had me laughing; trying on geisha makeup, teaching some of the locals how to fight with a sword, attempting to learn how Ichi wins at dice all the time...  Then there's the scantily clad boy that runs around the house with a spear, shouting.  I won't even try to explain it.  Oh, then there's the tap dancing.  The fights were nice and deadly, with CG blood taking the place of the guysers of the 60's and 70's.  For me, the stand out role is the character of Gennosuke Hattori, played by  urlLink Tadanobu Asano .  He plays a ronin hired by a gang in the village as a bodyguard, and is told to take out Ichi.  He character wants nothing more than to get money to save is very sick wife, and is a good man stuck in a bad situation.  I thought the actor looked familiar to me; he had been in   urlLink Gohatto  .  He is a very good actor and I'd like to see more of his work.  It was nice to see the blind swordsman one more time.  And as a side effect, interest in Katsu's movies has increased again, both in Japan and the States.  Can never have to much Ichi as far as I'm concerned.

      There are many, MANY ways to say "I" in Japanese.  There are some very common ones.  "Watashi" is a nice gender neutral one.  "Boku" is a bit rougher sounding and is often used by males.  "Atashi" is used sometimes by women.  But there are more.  There are also many ways to say "you."   urlLink The Japan Page.com  has a page that  urlLink lists a lot of them.

      Well, the back of the DVD didn't have a plot synopsis for me to put here, so I guess I'll have to get right down to business.  This is the  urlLink 26th and final Zatoichi movie  that Katsu Shintaro made, and in some ways, it's the ultimate Zatoichi movie.  I do not mean it is the best, because it certainly is not, but it incorporates the best elements from the previous installments.  Think of it as a "best of" collection.  For instance, we have the typical Ichi gambling sequence; an evil Yakuza boss, and an equally corrupt government official; an innocent girl that Ichi has to rescue; a ronin hired to kill Ichi who ends up liking and respecting the masseur.  All of the components are there... almost.  The story, sadly, is a little weak.  Nothing wonderful about it, nothing new.  Really, the movie shines the most when Ichi is on screen.  Katsu stepped right back into his alter-ego after a 10 year hiatus.  There are several excellent set pieces, mostly the fights, that are some of the best I've seen.  That's saying a lot when you consider that Katsu was almost 60 when he filmed this.  He's pretty darn sprightly.  The blood geysers are pretty over the top in some places, but that is to be expected, it's a late 80's movie.  Oh, and there's this cheesy song... I can't even begin to describe it.  It's a kind of ballad-like thing.  It's actually in English.  That does not make it better -- quite the contrary.  Now I don't want you to get the impression that I didn't like this movie, I did!  There were just some rough patches.  The Zatoichi series does not go out with a bang, but it does not go out with a whimper either, so that's something.

       The flip of a coin lead the blind masseur and master swordsman Zatoichi to his hometown, a place he has not visited in over two decades.  Despite his extended hiatus, he finds that several people remember him from his hellcat youth, including a "sister"  that he never knew he had and the village's local government Superintendent.  But things never stay quite for the masseur for very long.  An old face from Ichi's childhood, Shinbei, has hatched a nefarious plot to rob the town of their valuable community quarry.  The masseur is caught in the unenviable position of mediating the conflict between his former pal and the home of his youth, with neither side willing to budge.  Can Ichi, the champion of the weak and oppressed, do the right thing, even if it pits him against his childhood chum?   So, was there any reference to Ichi getting his hands pierced in the last movie.  No, not a word.  Of course, there is no way of knowing how much time was supposed to have passed between the movies, though this movie was release about a year after the last one.  Oh well.  This the  urlLink 25th Zatoichi movie , and the last one made until 1989, so there will be a bit of a gap, though actually, there was a long running Zatoichi TV series that ran until 1979.  The movie starts with Ichi running into Yuri and her gang of "husbands."  Basically she seduced guys, and her gang beats them up and steals their money.  Well, Ichi is going home so he's in no mood to play.  Once he gets to his home town, he is grabbed by some wealthy guys and brought to work his masseur skills on a wealthy merchant.  The merchant turns out to be Shinbei, an old childhood friend, but he acts all high and mighty and pretends not to know Ichi.  Later Ichi meets a young woman, Omiyo, who was raised by the same woman that raised him after his mother died.  Omiyo was born after Ichi left the village but heard many tales about him from the  old woman, who had recently passed away.  Ichi and Omiyo visit the woman's grave and the house they were both brought up, with Ichi feeling a bond with his new found "sister."  Well, you know things can't remain peaceful for long.  There are some crooked people in the town.  The Superintendent has been overcharging the farmers taxes buy having the tax box be bigger than it should, making them have to put more into it.  Shinbei steps in and pays the extra money the farmers owe, but he has ulterior motives.  He takes over the farmer's quarry, and begins getting stone from it to sell, which is what he had planned the whole time.  Then Shinbei meets Omiyo, and decides he wants her.  You know that's not going to go over well with Ichi...  It was a good 50 minutes into the film before we get any real sword work, and I'm not saying that's a bad thing.  This is another character driven episode, which are always a nice change of pace.  We get another glimpse into the life of Ichi before he became yakuza.  When we do get sword work, it is, as always, very nice.  Some good gushers of blood, some limbs chopped off.  A personal favorite of mine, the cutting of the dice came up.  Yakuza are so stupid in these movies... never, EVER, try and switch the dice on Ichi.  He'll know.  Then your loaded dice get cut in half... it's all very messy.  So the next Ichi movie I'll review will be from 1989, 16 years after this one.  Should be interesting...

       After a fatal encounter with an elderly woman on a decrepit robe bridge, Zatoichi seeks out her daughter, to make restitution for his role in her death.  He finds that the daughter, Nishikigi, is the most popular prostitute in the local brothel.  Vowing to save Nishikigi from this life of sin, he sets out to earn the money to redeem her.  But the blind swordsman goes too far when he hustles the local yakuza gang for the money.  Now, trouble comes from all sides as the local boss, a master swordsman and the prostitute's lover, all want a piece of Zatoichi.  Worst of all, Nishikigi just can't seem to turn her back on her life of sin!  All of these lead to the most shocking ends for Zatoichi, one that will leave him forever changed!   This the  urlLink 24th Zatoichi film , and was directed by Katsu Shintaro himself, one of the two Zatoichi films he directed.  It starts with Ichi encountering an old woman while crossing a rickety old rope bridge.  She is playing the shamisen and he compliments her.  They talk a little and he discovers that she is going to a nearby town to visit her daughter, Nishikigi.  Ichi feels pity for this old woman and offers a little money for her travels.  As she walks over to him to get the money, she loses her footing and falls to her death from the bridge.  Ichi feels guilt over her death, and taking up her shamisen, goes off to find the woman's daughter to give her the news and to ask her forgiveness.   The town is on the coast, with a rather famous red-light district, a place where Ichi discovers that Nishikigi is working.  He apologizes to her and promises to buy her contract and her freedom.  But first he needs ryo.  There is a docked boat that is being used as a gambling hall.  Many of the fisherman gamble there and have lost everything, their nets and boats.  The yakuza boss that runs the place says they can get them back once their debts have been paid.  Imaging that, a yakuza boss who is a dick.  Well anyway, Ichi arrives and does one of my favorite "Ichi gambling scams," with the dice outside the cup and the dice up his sleeve.  It's hard to explain.  "You people are not betting on the dice outside the cup are you?  What kind of gambling is that?" he admonishes them as he scoops up all their money.  He buys Nishikigi's freedom, but she is not content.  She has a guy, Ushi, and he is pissed that Ichi bought her contract, something he had been trying to save money for.  He works for the boss, and had indeed lost a ton of money to Ichi and his scam.  The boss has wants to kill Ichi, and impress  his  boss...  This was a pretty harsh movie.  Before the final duel, Ichi gets both of his hands pierced by harpoons.  Dang.  He ends up tying his sword to his hand to fight.  It is a rather intense showdown.  While ot the best entry in the series, it was still good.  Katsu was a pretty good director, and set up some interesting shots.  I really liked the way he shot a fight between Ichi and four gamblers on the beach.  Since the town was on the coast, we got a lot of nice shots of the sea.  I could have done without the cheesy sequence of the woman falling from the bridge.  The fact that we see the falling sequence over and over, every time Ichi remembered the event did not help.  There was a subplot of another young girl who works at the brother and her brother.  It is a sad story, but seemed sort of out of place.  I guess the point is that Ichi should have been saving them and not Nishikigi, who didn't really want to be saved.    We end with Ichi, hands ruined, walking alone down the beach.  I wonder if they next movie will have him dealing with his wounds?  I'm not going to hold my breath.  Continuity is not always a strong point with the Zatoichi movies.  Hopefully I'll find later out this week...

      There's a lot of interesting things over at  urlLink The Japanese Page.com .  Today I direct you to the page titled  urlLink "How to Speak Like a Samurai."   Pretty interesting.  Most of the words and phrases are older, archaic ways of saying things.

      Wow, I've been doing the blog for a month now, and I'm not sick of it.  That's a good thing.  25 posts so far, 26 if you count this one.  Here are the movie reviews that I've done so far.  Dang, there's a lot of them.  I probably won't be doing quite as many reviews over the summer, since a lot of the movies were borrowed from sensei, and we don't have class again until September.   urlLink Akage   urlLink Budo   urlLink Gohatto   urlLink Nemuri Kyoshiro - Shobu (2)   urlLink Nemuri Kyoshiro - Joyoken (4)   urlLink Zatoichi Royaburi (16)   urlLink Zatoichi to Yojimbo (20)   urlLink Zatoichi Abare Himatsuri (21)   urlLink Shin Zatoichi:  Yabure!

       This is the movie that introduced the legend of Zatoichi and its star Shintaro Katsu, ushering in a new ear of the Japanese samurai film.  Practicing his trade as a masseur in a small province, Zatoichi finds himself caught in a turf war between rival yakuza gangs.  Aware of Zatoichi's reputation as an undefeatable swordsman, yakuza leader Sukejoro tries to hire him -- unsuccessfully -- as a mercenary.  But it's too late.  The other gang leader, Shigezo, hires a warrior with an equally fierce reputation to challenge Zatoichi.  Thus the legend of Zatoichi begins with intensely choreographed battle scenes and an expertly crafted story.   Well, I decided to start from the beginning.  I pulled the first Zatoichi movie off the shelf and popped it in.  I've spend the last two months watched the end of the series, but I got the craving to go back and start over.  This is in no small part due to the fact the movies 17, 18, and 19 come out later this month.  I'd like to watch everything up to that point by the time they come out.  That's an awful lot of movies to watch, but I'm sure I can do it!  Wow, Shintaro Katsu was such a young pup in this movie, but even in this,  urlLink the first movie , he seems to have a really good handle on the character of Ichi.  It starts out with Ichi showing up in the small town of Iioka to visit a gang boss, Sukegoro, whom he had met the year before on the road.  The boss had been kind to Ichi and told him he was welcome in his house if he ever came to Iioka.  Well, his timing is not good.  Sukegoro is about to start a gang war with his rival in the nearby town of Sasagawa, and wants Ichi to fight for him.  It seems the Sasagawa gang has hired a ronin of considerable skill, and Sukegoro thinks having Ichi on his side with make things even.  Pretty cut and dry really.  You could say that this movie is the template for about half the following Zatoichi movies and you would not be wrong. But there is something about this one... a lot of it for me is the relationship between Ichi and Hirate, the ronin.  They meet one morning at a nearby lake, both of them fishing, and become fast friends.  This is of course before they know they have been hired by the rival gangs to fight each other, but even after they learn of this fact, they are friendly, drinking sake together at the temple the ronin is staying at.  Hirate is dying of tuberculosis, and want to duel with Ichi before he dies, much to the dismay of the blind man.  We are also introduced to Tane, a young women who falls for Ichi.  Her brother, Tate, is a yakuza who works for Sukegoro.  He is trying to get Tane to return to her former lover, another yakuza, but she does not want to be with him.  She does not want a heartless gangster.  It is interesting to point out that the character of Tane actually appears in two more Zatoichi movies, so you'll hear more about her.  Cool bits: Five minutes into the movie, we get to see the classic dice scam by Ichi, where he takes advantage of those who would do the same to him.  I was happy to see this, and had forgotten it happened so soon.  Another is when Ichi performs his sword drawing for Sukegoro's gang.  He throws a lit candle into the air, and cuts it in half, both sides still lit.    I have to say, even after seeing almost all the other Zatoichi movies, that this one is one of my favorites.  It is a bit of a slow story, and doesn't have a lot of swordfights, but the story is great, the characters are spot on, and the action, when we do get it, is fantastic.
