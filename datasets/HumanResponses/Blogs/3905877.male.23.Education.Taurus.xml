      oh yes, she has knives in her sink.   sun shines in the bedroom when we play / the rain it always starts when you go away.  please, please don't go the mfys, big unit. anywhere but there!   the trifecta of all trifectas may come this weekend and bad things come in threes. at least i know which one of them i want.   and i don't feel guilty masturbating.   rewinding tapes. i think i will live in middtown and work at the coop. fecta!  sorry, this is a useless entry. chatter.  &nbsp;

      pedro gets shelled.&nbsp; how deep does this rabbit hole go?  it is frightening to realize you are at the mercy of someone else. and, when you are twenty- three, detaching yourself from your desires is about as easy as detaching a child from its teething ring. add it up.   so there i am, thrown around by my theatrics, a laughable ragdoll that can't even find it funny. talk about hilarious. can i really take myself this seriously?  in the shanghai museum of art i saw a french woman scold her child, telling him not to touch the buddha statue.&nbsp;there was something profoundly graceful about the way she imparted the sketchings of some greater code upon her blonde-haired boy wearing a striped shirt.   temperature and temperments increase proportionately. air-conditioning kills the environment but it also prevents the environment from killing itself. imagine if all those cubicles were ninety degrees. office war! i have a fan.  i have a callous on my right wrist from typing too much.   with the sox losing and the girl snafu, life seems tough. my lap is breaking the silence, telling me it is fed up and wants something to fall into it ASAP.   as sexy as possible?  -edwin  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;

      are organisms.&nbsp; trailers and trips in the woods.  &nbsp; it was a superb long weekend, as i realized the depth of new found friendships. &nbsp;steve, shuffles, and gizmo - we had ourselves quite a time at bk's on friday. fro and the blanket. &nbsp;is this a high school yearbook entry? had a fun hike up to skylight pond with jen, india, and clare on sunday. leave no trace banana peel? we chilled on the lovely lookout rock after some silent moments by the pond. the birdish caretaker seemed peaceful, no? &nbsp; some things just might be arranged. speaking of organisms, we embellish our genetic programming so it suits our invented intellects. 99.4% of people in america are indoctrinated, myself included...if not by conventional mass media methods. i completed a cycle last night and now i'm sent off spinning into uncertainty again. i guess i'll just keep inventing. uncertainty is certainly the parlance of these times.  &nbsp; haven't written anything in oh so long, due mostly to cathodes (as bk would put it), lack of talent, and probably too many drugs. not that that has stopped writers in the past, though... &nbsp; as manny sits again with tight hamstrings, i wonder about next year and my twenties. i'm not sure that chinese is my calling. is it laziness, truth, or just more 23-uncertainty? the only thing i'm certain of these days is my love for my friends, which makes me want to be with them. what is my prescription for when the summer money is gone and the loan bills come? atrocious credit team!! &nbsp; a promising start from barry zito. let's hope he has straightened his head out with the all-star break rest and he will revert to his former ways instead of doing a bad john burkett impression.  &nbsp; where will the unit go? &nbsp; -edwin &nbsp; &nbsp;

      nomar to the white sox, who then send prospects to arizona, and we get rj? my how the rumors fly this time of year. don't get too caught up in it all, chilluns. theo will give it his all, and then we had best move on. if, by some grand brushstroke, it happened, i would have to empty my bank account to see the unit pitch in fenway against the mfy's.   how about miggy, eh? twenty-seven smokers. does this mean we are going to see an mvp caliber second half from mr. tejada? he sure is no second half slouch...  im going backpacking this weekend in franconia notch with my friend jen. feeling a little uneasy about not taking a certain someone else; i don't know if it was the right decision. i always find myself wading through nostalgia, dramatizations, and drugs to get to the truth, and it is always damn hard, sometimes impossible.   my buddies at buddolph have a leaking pipe. they need me to reach high and apply some tape.   so what am i going to do with myself next year? anyone need a chinese tutor?  looks like i might be moving in with my sister in portland, me. im in the dark!!  off to burlington tonight to buy a new summer sleeping bag and a few other necessities for the trip. i am really looking forward to it.   AIM me at discdiscdisc.   -edwin

      oh dear, here it is. a remedy for office boredom and some self-indulgence.   yeah, another blog. ideally, this will be a way to let my family and friends know what is going on with limited scandal appeal.   i might just write about some of you friends on this very blog. don't worry, i won't use your fake names.   major topics this blog will be concerned with include, but are not limited to, the following:  baseball, women, my life, politics, video games, the environment, the outdoors, literature, and language.   do i have the right to say it is hard to be twenty-three? no, because it really isn't...but sometimes is sure seems like it is. i think i have the right to say that.   on women: this just in - you can't heckle them. and your friends had better take the back seat, especially when the stars are out. if we could only teach them the intricacies of baseball, video games, beer die, and spliffs...  on baseball: nick cafardo's 7/12 globe article "tale of tape? cut him slack" on manny's sitting out of the 7/11 rangers game with a tight hamstring is basically back and forth drivel. at least it has a pun title which seems to have a point, saying that we should "cut [manny] slack." yet the article's last sentence throws that notion out the window: "but maybe it was one run manny could have provided." what good does this inconclusive wish-wash do us? so, cafardo, is your point that you just aren't quite sure what was going on with manny's hammy? do you kind of blame him because we lost? if those calls had gone our way and we had won, would it have been a good decision for him to sit? please, cafardo, i beg of you, choose a thesis and stick to it. by the way, everything is going to be fine. manny will finish .340/.430/.640 with 50 homers and 150 rbi, and pedro and schilling will combine for a sub 1.10 WHIP and +5 K/BB and +9 K/9 in the second half.   my fantasy team needs pitching, needs josh beckett healthy. you would figure modern science could take care of a blister.   griffey tears his hamstring...poor guy.   how awesome is brad lidge? danny kolb blew a save. boomer is my sleeper.   have you heard the ridiculous news that the fatherland security department is calling for the halting of elections in lieu of a terrorist attack? why don't we just throw out the constitution and start all over with a beefed up patriot act? booyah!!  anyway, that will about do it for post numero uno.   hasta luego,  eduardo
