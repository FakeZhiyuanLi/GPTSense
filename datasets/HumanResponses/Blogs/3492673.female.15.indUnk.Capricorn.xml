      Hey girls!  11 DAYS! whoo hoo!!  haha, welcome to our very own, very fab-four BLOG! :D this is now a new custom of ours, and we HAVE to write it in every couple days so we can always read what eachother are up too when we can't get together or call one another! besides, it's funny haha...  Shan, I agree that we should DEFINATLEY do a fam get-together on the fourth of July!!! it would seriously be so much fun!!! the Renello's should come too... an even BETTER idea would be that all three famalies could pitch in and buy that yacht we were talking about last weekend!!! haha we wish...  So I refeered soccer games all day, which really sucked, but I make about $15 dollars an hour doing it, so it's all good! lol...  well, the very first message of our very first blog is coming to end, because i have no idea what to write... EVERYONE WRITE IN HERE!  I love you all very very much. -N

      Hey guys! Ahh, how I missed you, EzD and Home Slice! Well, Boston, Maine, and New York were awesome! It was quite a nature-filled vacation haha, but we should definatley go there when we're older... You guys are eating dinner right now, but I'm going to call in like an hour to tell you ALL about it! So Dev, how is sailing in advanced going?! I think that you're going to make a lot of new friends in your new level, so don't worry about it... Plus, you can definatley still hang out with your intermediate friends on the weekends and what not! Anyways... WE NEED TO MAKE PLANS  ASAP !!!!!!!! I can't stand being away from my girls :(... So, any new news on the moving issue?? I hope nothing bad :/... So guess the frick what you guys.   I GET MY TEMPS ON WEDNESDAY  !!!!!!!! CAN YOU BELIEVE IT!?!?! I am so excited it's sick.   Dev, thanks for what you said in your comment the other day. It means a lot to me to know that I make you happy! And just so you know, you're one of the HUGE reasons that keeps me enthusiastic :) i love you times a million, baby sista.  I love you girls to the moon and back again, you're all that keeps me smiling!! :^*            -Baby G

      hey guys, i'm about to tell a story so don't interupt me okay? okay...  so i was sailing on thursday on the lake and this wind was sooooo heavy so me and my friend (val) were sailing together and since we aren't exactly the heaviest ppl in the world (180 lb. put together) we were getting whipped around A LOT. so we we're sailing and i noticed that the outhall on the boat (a rope on the mast that sticks out to help the sail go faster) had came off and we also noticed that the jib (the smaller and frontmost sail) had come off of it's line so it was flowing free. so we asked our instructor hunter to come over with the powerboat to hold onto us while we fixed our boat. and hunter is not the best powerboater in the world, (he didn't even pass the test) so while we we're fixing the boat, all of a sudden he goes "okay you're fixed" so i was like, "NO WE'RE NOT" and so he let go of our boat. so there we were, in the middle of the lake, with no outhall, no jib, and our sail was falling off. so while he pushed us off of his powerboat he made the boat flip over into a capsize. which is the boat only on it's side instead of bottom up. so the centerboard was sticking out of the bottom of the boat which was on it's side  and i climbed on the centerboard to try to make it come down (the centerboard is a part of the boat that sticks straight down) and so i could right the boat. well when i was on it, all of a sudden, a huge gust of wind comes and knockes me off of it and then the boat turtles (it's when the boat goes bottom up). so me, val, and wesley (this kid who came to help) climbed on the bottom of the boat and tried to un-turtle the boat and so when we got it up (finally), val and wesley we're knocked off the boat and they we're just sitting in the lake to wait for a powerboat to come and pick them up. so while i was in the boat i realized that the rutter(the thing that steers the boat) came off and so i was on a boat with still no jib attached, practicly no main sail attached, and no rutter. so i was on a runaway boat. so i got a tow in and i couldn't get my rutter in so i was like rockin in the wind  ~that is my sailing extravaganza ~~lyl ~~~D

      AHHH, I haven't posted in AGES... geez, sorry guys...haha... well, this one will be super long...  I do believe it is about that time to start planning our next extravaganza!!! haha Fourth of July, prehaps??? ahhh I'm excited already   So we're leaving for Maine on Sunday! which is kind of exciting because we've never been there, but kind of sad because we won't be able to talk to our very best friends for an entire WEEK. :( Thankfully, that means we absolutley MUST plan something for the Fourth of July weekend for the following reasons: 1. Most importantly, if we waited one more weekend, that would be breaking the newest rule of the Fab Four, which is that we have to do something every month because anything else would be a sin. 2. CHI CHI (haha :D ) and I are going to camp the second week of July!! and not seeing eachother for that long is just utterly unexceptable.  Guys... I have made on outstanding discovery... I'm not sure if you guys knew this, but Hogwarts is located in SCOTLAND!!! I for one was shocked today when I found out this tasty little piece of info!! I always thought it was for sure located in England. But apparently I stand corrected. ;)  Anywhooo... how's the whole Zach-is-obsessed thing going, Ez D? better, I hope, or I might have to open a big can of whoop-ass on that boy >:O haha jk... Dante will do it for me ;) hahaha... so, SIMS Superstar is totally AWESOME!!! ah, I love you guyss :^*... Oh, yea! Give Grandma a big kiss for me for her 97th b-day!!!! I love her too... along with everyone over there!!!! We're like one huge extended family...  Speaking of birthdays, I absolutley refuse to believe that our little baby Ronbo is turning 4!!! Where the hell has the time gone?!?!?! I can perfectly remember the day Renee called us to tell us the news... it was like I was getting a freaking baby brother, I was so excited!!!! hahaha  I have a new obsession... their name is DASHBOARD CONFESSIONALS! I also knew they were good, but wow, they're AMAZING!!!! I am for sure burning you their CD, Home Slice.  Well girls, Ive got to go now! I love you all very dearly, my little women. Peace Easy -Baby G

      Alright Dev and Cich, your absolutley stunning older sisters, Shannon and I, have thought of a few nicknames for us... in honor of our g-h-e-t-t-o friends outside the 7-11 across the street from Italian Creations (HAHA), we will from this moment on be known as:  Shannon...  Home Slice   Nia...  Baby G   Devin...  Ez D   Cici...  Lil Chizzle   hahahaha straight from our ghettoness within. i mean, we did grow up in  C-Town , after alllll... hahaha  Summer has FINALLY dawned upon three of the fab four!!! WHOOO HOOOO!!! don't worry Shanbo... you're final days are rapidly approaching...  Speaking of Shanbo, remember how MAD it made you when we called you that when we were little?!?! haha you hatedddd it... also, remember how you always tried to convince me that Cici was spelled like CiCi... with an extra capital "C"?!?! haha and how you also tried to convince me that Devin was actually older than Cich?!?! hahaha how funny is that now, looking back :)  I must be going! I shall see you guys in  2 DAYS !!!!!! :D   KissKiss -N

        FINALS SUCK    That's all that needs to be said right about now.   Shan, remember when the last week of school was a time for rejoicing? A time for celebrating no homework and watching pointless movies and having class parties? Ah, yes, the good old days... Take advantage of them Cici and Dev... Before you know it, they'll be gone...  I mean how unfair is it that I have been desperately cramming in the studying this past week when ALL I want to think about is how summer is DAYS AWAY!!!!!!!! Ahh the excitement. Shan, you can most definitely relate, as can every high school student everywhere.  Good luck on your tests Shanbo!! My first two are tomorrow morning :\ at least I get out of school at 10:45!!! Yessss!! Something to slightly look forward to (?) haha  Also, I hope you had fun at Cedar Point today Dev! You'll have to tell us here at the Marinucci house all about it next week.  On the brighter side...   ONE WEEK  !!!!!!!!! muhahahaha  Well, studying calls! Love you guys -N

        Hey girls! No one has posted in like 2 weeks dudes!! It's ridiculous. I like how you can now change the font AND color of the posts!! It's quite divine. Well, at this very instant, I am awaiting a call from none other than Home Slice herself so we can plan the next extravaganzaaa!!! WHOO HOOO!! Hopefully we can get one in this week, which would be AWESOME! I think it's definitely time for a sleepover. So EzD, how was sail camp as an overall experience?? Great, I hope! Also, how are things going with Sir Zach? Sadly, I have no new news to report about Kevin :( Well maybe something, but I think I will leave you guys hanging on that one ;) Well, camp was absolutley awesome, I had so much fun! How was theater camp, Shan?? Summer is officially half way over and I am PISSED, to put it lightly... some of my friends are already saying how they are excited for school?? I'm not in any way, shape, or form. I could kick them for saying that, In fact, if I could chose, I would never go back... ever. haha All I can say is that starting August 23rd, I will definitley be counting down the days until winter break, when I will be peacing out to Florida the entire time :D :D :D Well, I guess&nbsp;I'm going to&nbsp;get going now!! I'll tell you all to write in &nbsp;here so we can get the posts rolling...  Peace Easy my sisters --  Y  Nia
