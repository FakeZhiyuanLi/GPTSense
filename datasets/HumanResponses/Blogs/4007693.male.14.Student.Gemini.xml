       EXFGUGA IS currently down do to bandwidth levels*, so there's not MUCH to talk about.     Now, since I have nothing else to say, visit   my website  . I just made it TODAY. AIN'T IT a coofoo website?             *bandwidth levels -- A bandwidth is the width of a band when each member stands side by side. There are unlimitted levels of bandwidth. Level one is 1 ft., level two is 2 ft., level three is 3 ft., etcetera, etcetera, etcetera (I have no idea why I even bothered to look up the spelling of "etc."). Hence the reason timmy wants to know why the [BAD WORD] he even mentioned bandwidth, when he should be telling us why the wesites down.

       Well, ladies and gentlemen, a few days ago Zack challenged Pearl to a battle of wits (a.k.a debate). Although the only known reason for this spontaneous request is that Zack finds Pearl to be a significant source of annoyance, the debate has been scheduled for this coming Monday.    The rules of the debate series are as follows:  1. Only Sir Zack the Rash and Lady Pearl of The-House-Next-Door-to-Her-Parents-House may be approbated to post in each debate thread (that is, unless Sam gets his usual urge to actuate his signiture phrase, "STFU dumass"; incorrect spelling and all). This rule will stay in effect until either of the following has occured: if each debatee (don't you love that word) has posted each of his/her two alternating posts; OR if Zack has banned Pearl. In the case of the first occurance, only the the three judges may post (although I am not sure what at the moment). In the case of the second occurance, Zack pretends that Pearl has forfieted the debate, and therefore wins.  2. Since Sir Zack is the challenger he gets, in his words "homefield advantage", which I believe means that Lady Pearl bats first, and that if Zack's ingenious plan somehow malfunctions and he misses the ball, Pearl gets to run around the bases. Then Zack gets to bat ... and hope that somebody will figure out why the heck he's playing one-on-one baseball, while they're supposed to be arguing about some random topic ... like why the chicken crossed the road.  3. Sir Zack: "If either Me or Pearl posts out of turn that's an automatic disqualification for that one debate." Translation: "If Pearl says something even remotely stupid, I'm banning her."  4. Now that we know the ground rules (a.k.a. the "Pearl-loses-no-matter-what" rules), we must discuss thoroughly the selection of topics. Topic one is to be selected by Sir Zack. Topic two is to be selected by Lady Pearl. Topic three is to be selected by Lord Timmy the Creator. Topic four is to be selected by Lord Jeff the User of Viagra. Topic five is to be selected by Lord Butters the Kind, Sensless, and Utterly Nonsensical. Topic six is selected by by yours truly. Just kidding. Topic six is  really  selected by a very selfish being who just happens to be the one carrying the honor of selecting the first topic.  5. The first person to win four debates (a.k.a. Zack), wins. (sorry, i forgot to put it in rule number 4).  6. The loser of this series of [fixed] debates  , owes (his)/her opponent something around 1,000,000 ep, and is banned for 3 days.    Topic  one has been chosen! it is... Dot! Dot! Dot!   RELIGION!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!     Thank you, and have a nice day.

       Hey! I'm Billyfox, known to friends by a series of names, including Albert, Bubbles, and William; none of which is my real name. Now, I assume that you are currently straining your brain to learn what ExFuGa is. Well, too bad. I'm not telling you....Ok, fine. I'll tell you, but only 'cause I'm nice. Now, here goes:     ExFuGa   is website on the internet. It stands for Extremely Fun Games, although it has none of that description...but that's not the point. The main exfuga feature is the Exfuga forum. If you don't know what a forum is, well, too bad. Anyway, it was made   from scratch   by Timmy weichselbaum (exfuga-name: timmy) about a year ago at age 12, and is still being improved. The current exfuga staff are Timmy Weichselbaum, Zack (exfuga-name: The1andonlyZack), Jeff (exfuga-name: Jeff), Butters (exfuga-name: butters), and Chris Weichselbaum (exfuga-name: Chris). They are all very good admins, although lately Zack has been on a banning spree (to which I happened to fall victim to). Timmy is a very interesting human being, who I happen to know in person. He has an abnormal habit of doing things very unpredictably, which spawns from his unpredictable personality. Zack, who I also know in person, is a person who engages consistently in the art of arguing and insulting. He also believes me to be utterly clueless, which is completely incorrect, as you can palpably see. Jeff, from what I know of him, has good morals, excluding the one about wanting to have a child with his girlfriend. Butters is my favorite staff member. He will quickly come to the rescue of a fellow exfugian from the wrath of Zack or Sam (exfuga-name: sam), whether by unbanning him/her from the forum, or by making a useless, yet senseful, comment towards the insulter. Chris is a very mysterious person who, although timmy's brother, does not consistently show up on exfuga, except to ask Sam why I [Billyfox] should not use jpegs.    We also have the exfugian long-time regulars: Pearl (exfuga-name: pearl), Sam, Pokemon (exfuga-name: PokemonMaster), kuietlu (exfuga-name: kuietlu), Anthony (exfuga-name: Anthony Kid), Bill (exfuga-name: Bill), and Cross (exfuga-name: Cross). Pearl, a former exfugian admin, is an interesting character. I'd consider her the comic relief of the forum. Zach, on the other hand, would probably consider her, plainly said, dumb. Sam, being timmy's best friend, gets extra rights that even the admins don't get (although he does not get the admin rights himself). For example, timmy often will give him passwords to other people's accounts, although not so much anymore. Hence the reason he is the scapegoat for everything stolen from other exfugians. Along with his privileges, Sam is an altogether messed-up guy who will never refrain from finding reasons to use the word "dumass", or the phrase "STFU Bill". Hence the reason we say that if every person that he said "STFU Bill" were banned, there would be no one left on exfuga. Pokemon, along with being Pearls younger sister, acts just the way she should at her age: like an 8-year old. Kuietlu is a  really  messed up guy that I'd rather not talk about. Anthony is a computer wiz. After being permenantly banned from exfuga, and then having his original exfuga-name (Anthony_Kid) deleted, he now goes by multiple aliases, including "Anthony Kid" and "Fabulous_Hottie". Bill is the owner of a site called  urlLink MishkinEvil . After being permanently banned multiple times, he now uses the forum with various aliases, including "Paris Hilton" and "Linustorvalds". Cross is the only person who currently uses exfuga that lives in Australia. Besides that, I can't tell u much else about him.    Along with the forum, exfuga also has a battle system (which is down at the moment), a lottery, exfugian shops, clans, a bank, stocks, an auction, and a few games.    Ladies and gentlemen, it was nice meeting you. I will be back soon to report on the goings-on of ExFuGa.com.       My exfuga-name: IarcayanAmnia; HiTim (not in use)    A good exfuga-name to put in the "refered-by" box if not mine: fongvoltfan *    Another good exfuga-name to put in the "refered-by" box if not mine: bill *                  *Do this at your own risk
