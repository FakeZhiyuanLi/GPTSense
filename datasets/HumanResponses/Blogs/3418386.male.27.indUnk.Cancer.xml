      well, about 40 of the coolest people i know just left my house- they came over to watch the t-wolves get their hinies kicked. so i called david, mandi, the longleys and terry gaffney to watch the game and told them to invite people if they wanted to... and before i knew it my basement was packed! i seriously loved it though, because they are such a great group! it amazes me that God has put so many great people in my life- people that i truly love and care about.  so i have been getting into pauls writing lately, and one thing really stuck out to me today and encouraged me. i was reading in phillipians (which is really a letter intended for the church at phillipi, but i think that the truths presented are timeless), and as i got to just verse 6 of the first chapter, i had to stop- Philippians 1 6And I am sure that God, who began the good work within you, will continue his work until it is finally finished on that day when Christ Jesus comes back again. i have read that verse so many times before, but for some reason it hit me hard today! that in spite of my struggles to follow Him, in spite of my struggles to get closer to Him, in spite of my sin... He continues to work in me! and then i thought, "how?"....  the realization that i came to was that He began His work FOR us at the cross, but he began His work IN us when we chose to believe in Him. we have the Holy Spirit in us who enables us to be more like Christ every day- key word here is ENABLES. He gives us what it takes to be more Christ-like, but we need accept it and run with it and use what He gives us- or we fail.  so here i am thinkin to myself how cool it is that we have a God who enables us us to be more Christlike, yet still works in us everyday to make us complete creations in His eyes! God rocks!  quote of the day: "if i was god, i wouldn't have chosen this timing." - bruce clapp

      what a carazy weekend! i went down to albert lea with the freshmen worship team- it was such a blast for me! i hope so for them too. i went down late on saturday with kristen, will, matt and andy. they are such a great group of kids- and all of them with totally unique personalities! i love em to death! we had this fun convo about our favorite video game, movies and tv shows... then we got to ryans parents place for the night and played mad gab while deliriously tired! so i had a blast with them, which i really needed, but i am really proud of them for the ministry that they do- they played so great down there- and i dont think that they realize it at all. i suppose that i kinda feel like a proud parent right now- so proud of my kids! they rock.  so i had to speak to a group of adults for the church service on sunday down there- and i have NEVER given a message to adults before! that was interesting to say the least. i talked a little bit about whats been on my heart lately- faith. and how different might our lives be if we really had faith in God. if we really trusted Him. if we really truly relied on Him to meet our needs---instead of just saying that we have faith and trust and that we rely on Him....only to go about our lives doing things our own way and trying to get where we want to be by our own means. i have seiously been challanged by this lately- and the worst part- i dont really know how to have more faith! maybe some day i will figure it out... peace.

      i really cant believe that i am doing this. its very much unlike me! so i ask myself why.... and i guess my hope is that this is a place that helps me to keep myself accountable to my time alone with God. i would assume that others will read it from time to time, so i think that it might help me to do my journalling online instead. so here i am! i really dont see myself journalling too much personal stuff here- that would be weird for me- besides, i wear my emotions, no my life, on my sleave anyway! hopefully you might find something good and encouraging in here in the days to come.
