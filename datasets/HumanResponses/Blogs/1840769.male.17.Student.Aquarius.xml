      Hello everyone,  This is Adeline...As to why I'm called pampy...Well that is short for pampowered...Pampered and Empowered...HAHAHAHAHA!  Glad that Ang Cai wanted to start this blog...And that he wants to try to gel people together....It will be great if people got to know each other better...  Well, as for me, I'm not an NTU person...But thanks to knowing the owner of the blog, some of us get special privileges and we are allowed on it... =)  Study hard when school re-opens and get good results.&nbsp; And don't ever be like me, be mad enough to take another course now....Currently dying with the studies and work at the same time now.... =P  See you all in church this Sunday.... =)

       Hey all,  For all of Ang Chai’s effort, I decided to post smtg in the blog to get things going.  &nbsp;  Hmm..thinks it’s not bad an idea for us to meet up. From wat I see in the list I think I’ve only seen half the ppl in it, it’ll be good to put some faces to those names. And like wat “alternating current” has said, it’ll be good to exchange pointers to all u freshies! Hee..and also to lend support to each other.  &nbsp;  Btw I stay in Hall 5, the canteen’s not bad according to first timers, but not for somel like me who have been eating their food for the past 2 years! So give me a ring if u wanna come down and try the food. I can give some recommendations. My no. is 94870708  &nbsp;  Cya ard sch! Adios!

      You know reading the blog entries by you guys is like a "cheer me up" for me at work... I much rather want to study compared to working...Sitting down here doing my, I dunno, 200th set of slides in my 3 years here....Must be, I have lost track of the many silly sets of slides that I have to do...Why it is such a must in the corporate world, I have NO clue...Consultants do more...I think they probably do 200 a year...So what in the world was I thinking when I was thinking about joining consultancy when I'm done with my bond?  I'm sitting down here doing slides, feeling hungry, and feeling tired from the week already...There is so much to be done and so little time!!! ARGH....But I do admire all of you NTU people who go through the Singapore system...I think Engineering here is harder than it is overseas...Just a hunch....=)  So you guys are really full-fledged engineers with the real knowledge....I'm just a person who knows the theory....with ZERO hands-on experience....  Shall hide in my little cuby hole during lunch and do my quiet time, eat lunch and just chill out.....  Brandon - Good to hear from you, even though you were bored...At least we know that you are bored and we know what's happening to you....  Ang Cai and Jiam - Hang in there....=)  Do your tutorials, and be good....Hee hee....

      third day of the third week. hurray. i just found out that we have 17 weeks of school over here..not good at all. =[ NTU has been "..." for me. im thankful for the people who do make conversation with me..ive made soe guypals in tut class and lectures. Everyone has the same reaction towards my presence in NTU.hahaa..but oh wells i guess things arent always that typical.  My life in NTU revolves around  canteenA, LT7, toilet,TR37,library(currently at),bustop at canteen a to squeeze up the 179 bus..haahah...really have a battle to fight just to get a spot on the bus..  Life in singapore is realy hectic..and i really give all my respect to all you NTU people because the number of modules that you guys have to take is exceedingly overwhelming.  ill continue to make my time in NTU a memorable one in its own way..haahh..at least at the end of it all i get to keep my BLUE NTU matric card which prevents me from buying a bus concession.Thanks man.=p  aite..time to head towards the toilet and lt7 again.. cheerio jiam   PS: yes do come for the saturday night event..it would really be a good time to get started on a very important thing-prayer. We should never leave that out. Come and meet God.

      Hey all...  Not too sure who everyone is but hey, better write something soon, yah? If not....  Well, how are the undergrads? Or more specificly, the freshmen?? Hope all those studying are faring well and doing their tutorials. This gentle reminder has been targeted aimed at a certain Mr Liu.  Really have nothing to write. Just a bit bored at home.  So yesterday was National Day. Thought it was one of the better NDP's in recent years. No cock-ups in the parade, yah? Any comments from our dear regulars? How did everyone find the NDP?  Oh yah, Ang Cai, when's the NTU GBCer's lunch with the Profs? Heard you've been planning since 26 July with no news as yet. Not efficient bro.... not efficient...  Anyway, will be seeing those I know soon. Cheers...  Boon ps. really sorry if i've bored you guys to death. I'm THAT bored!!!
