      Strange, how ironic life can be. So ironic I just feel like laughing my head off.  About two feet away lies my baby sister. Six year old, perfect angel...when asleep.  The most beautiful little girl ever with an attitude to boot. And it angers me to know that she doesn't like herself. The other day she just started crying in my room going on about how she doesn't belong, how she doesn't like herself because she think she's ugly and no one at school likes her. Needless to say i listened but i also set her straight, and talked it over with her.  Hmf, then I'm sitting here, listening to her go on and on knowing that this is the child that has better luck with guys than I do. She's an amazing kid, and did I mention she'll probably get a boy friend before I do (is that not sad?)   But no really, see I'm always wishing I was more like her. More spontaneous, more open, able to express my feelings to those I love with ease. But strange how the things you dislike about your own personality are the envy of others.  No one is ever satisfied with what they have...and that's a very sad reality.    I should go to sleep now but I don't really feel all that tired...I think I'll mope around for a while maybe watch "Underworld" again(which is by the way a really good movie) and drink some soy milk as my tribute to beast boy.   Long live the cute and the fuzzy.

      "I am just the most mature person on the face of this planet.. that's why my ambition in life is to become a fictional creature that flies and kicks butt."    -nani-fox  A quote I just said about ten minutes ago in the car, and believe it or not it probably describes my entire being in about thirty words. Ever since I discovered the horrible truth - that I would one day have to grow up, I made it my duty to defy the laws of the universe. I swore I would never grow up, I'd be the one sliding down the stairs on my butt, riding the carousel 20 times, and farting in the bath tub just to see the bubbles. The most horrible thing in the history of ever, happened to me when I was about eleven.   HoRmOnEs.   I found that I could no longer run quite as fast seeing as I was being weighed down by these strange grape-fruit sized growths protruding out of my chest and that boys were no longer differed by the fact that thier hair was shorter than girls. Then when you really sit down to think about the pros and cons you really begin to realize that having a kid at 17 is utter hell and that the ideal age to get married is about ,say, 25-28. So why in gods name was the horror of mood swings,cramps, and bizarre fantasies bestowed upon the young? Bleh, does the universe hate me?   However despite the stupidity of teenager hood that tries to eat away at the child in me I still manage to retain my 5 yr. old mentality.  Proof of that consists in the fact that i would much rather watch Matt and Garurumon kick the stuffing out of some 50 foot bear on Digimon than watch the many love crisises of FRIENDS. Also considering I set the alarm clock for 7o'clock on a Sunday and spent the entire morning watching a Digimon marathon.Ohh yeah, cause Kouji is just too hot to miss.  I also made a discovery today, thongs are fun.  No really, Their like these giant sling shots you can shoot at people. See you can't do that with panties because there's just to much fabric, and boxers are way to big. As you've probably guessed this idea was thought up while sitting on the can and starring down at the clothing around my feet. I continued pondering the idea...I don't remember a lot of it but I think it consisted of giant armies with crossbow thongs witch cause serious whiplash...though I don't think you really want to know about that. Ahem, then somehow  I began wondering about the power of spandex and why so many super heroes enjoy modeling the material...but that's a whole other page all together....

           My cat has got some serious paranoia issues. She silently stalks her pray.. calmly ..carfully..then pounces! On to my foot. Then when it moves  she she's all like "oh crap it's alive..and it's connected to that loud annoying creature that feeds me." Then runs and hides. She's probably part dog too. We don't waste money on expensive toys and stuff.. Oh no just crumple up a piece of paper and play fetch with her. I think I could probably make her roll over and play dead too. Though I highly doubt that she'll be playing dead after she runs into the wall...again..she suffers from chronic stupidity syndrome. I wonder if it's contagious...        I stink..*sniffs armpit*   This is what massive amounts of homework do to me. I refuse to take a shower till I have finish it all. All about 15 pages of math problems. I haven't even changed out of my pjs. It's times like this I wish I had a loving caring better half that would tell me I look great even in fuzzy pants and a sweat shirt. Sadly all I have is my weird cat and a 6 yr old brutally honest smart mouthed sister.  I also have a brutally honest mother. Acocurding to her I smell like onions. I beg to differ.. I prefer garlic. Think of it, my own artificial vampire repellent.   Hoo-yeah!! No vampire getting close to my neck... unless ofcourse it's spike...hehehe yummah...Speaking of yummah, just finished watching pixel perfect last night *coughforthethirdtimecough* and have once again agreed that the guy that plays Rosco is the entire reason to watch that movie. So excuse me while i take a shower, plan ways to stalk and kidnap him.    Muahahahahaha   fear your short rabid fan girl as she is now sitting on two text books to reach the key board comfortably.

      Well I just survived the math class from hell...factoring...factoring...I'd just love to stab the guy that invented factoring . Oh no violence in schools....So I'd like to accidentally stab him. Yeah that's it, I'll just drop the knife about 20 times then I'll feel better. No wait I gotta better idea, I think I'll just use a machine gun on the Algebra II book. That way I don't hurt anyone. I wonder if vandalism is a crime? The books are friggin old anyway, I don't think any one will mind. But no must be perfect angel as in a "horns hold up halo" kida way. Dude, alliteration rocks my socks. That reminds me I've never heard of taking a core class online, and that's exactly what I'm gonna have to do with English. There's not enough room in my schedule for that class I'm gonna experiment with this. Not that English is my favorite subject either. Your talking to the poor chid that spelled "it" wrong for Christ sake. Me and my dislexia will go run and hide now. -Note to self : I think that if my math teacher ever smiled her face would crack.

      My brains gonna snap any minute now I swear.  Brain fizzled to crisp....Can't ..Think. All because of flippin algebra 2 homework. Wow that class really needs o die. Like right now, this instant...The great nani-fox commands it considering I'll probably never use factoring or polynomials or jigginomials or whatever funky names these thingies have.  *sighs* it's my first day of school. 10th grade at Tarpon Springs. Woo-hoo for me. Yeah go to all honors classes nani, they say, we'll be sooo proud of you nani they say. Bleh, I'd chose American idol over algebra anyday. All core classes on the same day means hw day in and day out too...Which reminds me ...I still have Spanish work too  *sighs again* I'm gonna have to stalk my teachers well mainly my math teacher. I think I'll pin her down to the desk and have her explain every thing in lamens terms for me, then maybe I'll get it. Here I come lookin like an idiot bakabakabaka    lalalalalalalala  tomorrow ill feel better for sure, I just can't wait to get up at the crack of dawn and face my doom. On A better note hiya .... Welcome to my blog thingie.. Please enduge in the imaginary cookies and juice I'll hand out now. Many have been nagging me to write a blog considering I'm a bagillion miles away from what I used to call home ...Charlotte *sniff snfiff*  So here people knock yourself out (lord knows some of you need it) nani's blog has officially begun expect weird and squishy things to come.

      "I've got the urge to swear in Spanish at the top of my lungs...ahem..CAR**O!!" -Brian  Yeah, quote the guy next to me said in Spanish today, and quite frankly that is exactly how I feel right now.   I left school with my brain in serious need of a trip to the emergency room. Yet I haven't stopped studying since I got home this afternoon at three. Needless to say my brain is pretty close to dead right now.  No I'm not a freak at least not in that sense, I'm just trying to haul butt and get my grade up before the end of the year.  So excuse me while I crack my skull trying to finish my work on conics and make up a little song with so many curse words they haven't even been invented yet...  Dit..shuck..famnit  hey this is fun!

      Oh snap! Mom came to school with me this Thursday or Friday and every one thought she was a friggin student. She came to meet my teachers and crap...not that I had been bad or anything...^_^     She just wanted to say hi, except for my math teacher, mom thinks she's the anti-christ.  I think all the guys in my world history class were disappointed when they found out the new "hottie", (using that term loosely) was my mom and already engaged.  It's fun having a mom that thinks and looks like a teenager.  Heck my dress code is basically "If I can wear it, you can wear it too" If it fits that is, because my mom is 4'11, where as I'm about 5'1.  The only flaw in this arrangement I've found is that having your mother look better than you half the time can get quite annoying. Bleh, whatever.  *Goes to get her comfortable sweatpants and baggy shirt.*  Screw looking good for the time being...I think I'll go burn the cosmetics while I'm at it too.

      Ok. As of right now blockbuster officially sucks to the max.   We spent the whole freaking Saturday  going around town, then when the time finally came to rent the best movie of all time which I've been dying to see for the past six months IT'S NOT THERE! Then I ask how is it possible for Neo in all his sexy glory to not be available for me to faun over? How in the world can the final chapter of the Matrix trilogy *sparkle sparkle* not have a sign that says "guaranteed in stock or it's free?!  BLEH! So in a bad mood were going down US 19 when suddenly my mom scares the bejezzis out of me when she yells "look yonder! A video store!" ok so technically those weren't her exact words but it was something along those lines. She makes freak U-turn one of those that defies gravity and the laws of motion and the Hollywood video came in to my line of vision.  I swear I could hear the chorus in the back ground singing HALLELUJAH! There in lied my salvation! Long story short I found "the one" my beloved...And he had a nice trip home to my DVD player pressed to my bosom the whole freakin' way, with the sound of my annoying high-pitched rabid fan girl squealing busting the ear drums of my poor mother.   So I just finished watching the ending to the best trilogy and I'm sitting here and I have absolutely no idea what the heck happened in the story. I was good up to the point in which neo some how became the oracle. Oops well I shouldn't give the story away the little bit I under stood of it, though I'll bet if I watched it again I'd understand it better considering I wouldn't have a 6 year old complaining sbout how my her butt hurts because she's sitting on the floor. Grrrrrr. I'll have to do that later.  Another thing, I just had one of my long time wishes fulfilled. No I do not have infinite amounts of chocolate coming out of my closet and no I have not saved the digital world...yet. But I did got the next best thing. Calvin Klein Boxers! Oh yeah because boys clothing is always ten times  more comfy than girls clothes, which is always either to short or to tight. Those boxers are my new best friends, word to the wise girls there is no shame in buying boxers for yourselves, you should only begin to panic when you see a guy buying bras and panties particularly the pink kind.  Ick, you know to this day I loath the color pink. I can't stand it, something about it's sickly hue gets me every time. I'm not talking about the hot and spicy pink. Oh no I'm talking about the light girlie abomination to the color red. I began pondering over this and I came to a very important discovery. My hate for pink stems from my hatred of the pink power ranger. Sad yes, but in good reason. GOD. Kimberly ruined that show she needed to burn and die with that annoying little laugh of hers. She also needed to stop hitting on Tommy cause you know she needed to come to the realization that he's just to good for her.  Yes I'm a freak. Yes I have issues with the telescreen.  Now leave me alone before I send big brother out to get you.

      I carried in my baby sister in two minutes ago. It was the first time i'd seen her all day since I my family had gone kayaking during the day while i stayed with a friend of mine.  I nearly broke down crying.  This afternoon I met a little girl about the same age as the one in my arms. She was smart, active, and loved to laugh just like any other child in the world.  Except half her face had been burnt off.  She was a little hispanc girl that had been abandoned by her mother. The family that was taking care of her now was working on adopting her.It was so hard to smile and be happy without remorse.I'd think of what she must have gone through at such a young age and what might happen in the future. Then the most heart aching part was that when she called me "mommy". She probably assumed i held the role since i am hispanic my self and my hair is quite dark probably much like her mothers. She was also infatuated with hair, not that i blame her considering she can never grow her own naturally. I'm wondering why i'm not crying now. I guess i've always found refuge in Rev 21:3-5.  "With that I heard a loud voice from the throne say 'Look! The tent of God is with mankind,and he will reside with them, and they will be his peoples. And God himself will be with them. And he will wipe out every tear from thier eyes, and death will be no more, neither will mourning nor outcry nor pain be anymore. The former things have passed away.' And the one seated ont he throne said 'Look! I am making all things new' Also he sais:'Write because these words are faithful and true.'"  I hope I live to see that. Until then i think you should know she is one of the most beautiful children i've ever had the chance to meet.   good night.

      Oh my friggin god.   Honestly I don't get angry easily...Its hard to piss me off but there are the select few things that really push my buttons. Like I can't stand it when someone else draws on MY artwork. It's my freaking drawing..get your flippin' hands off and draw your own dangit! Or when some one repeats every thing really slowly to anyone who looks or seems different. Like with my mom the other day she was just trying to ask this lady about where to pay in the wal-mart and she goes and starts treating my mom like she's stupid!  She's talking all slow and loud like my mom is a retard. She's Spanish not deaf.  Geez all because my mom's English isn't the best doesn't mean she can't tell you off. In fact it's amazing how perfectly she'll speak when she's pissed. Needless to say she put that four legged female in her place.  I've also added to this list of pet peeves. Today I discovered I can't stand egotistically loud guys. I mean the really loud and obnoxious ones. Wow as if I wasn't feeling good to begin with,since my eye was about to kill me this morning(it's infected with somthin) I go to school to be faced with none other than this guy that won't shut up and the math class from hell. Now it's bad enough that this guy wouldn't shut up..But he had the nerve to hit on me in ways I found quite rude and degrading. This is the part where I either throw up or turn around and kill him. I held it back..Then he tried to ask me out!  *gags* NOOOOOOOOO! NO! and did I mention NO! That's pretty darn close to what I actually said. This happened at my stupid locker which by the way decided not to open,with me trying desperately to run away. I quickly walked /ran away once I got my locker open after the hundredth attempt and took refuge in my Spanish class, In which Amanda,Brian,and Ali helped me remember my life wasn't a complete waste of time. ^_^  Don't get me wrong though, some guys can be egotistical and quite attractive to me, it's just all in their attitude....Like a good friend of mine has quite the ego and the attitude to boot but he's really not the bad boy he tries to be, you just gotta love him for it. What it comes down to is that a guy has to have a balance sometimes the ego is cute, but sometimes modesty can go a long way.   One more thing it annoys me to no end how some people can't be funny unless it includes curse words or some perverted comment. More points against the egotistical jerk. Where as Bri-anna,Brian,and Ali can make me laugh until I'm hyperventilating and pretty darn close to wetting my pants and I love them to pieces for it. And it's innocent fun you know like in the old days when one didn't need a couple F-you motha-Fers to make something funny. True every now and then something slips but it's mostly idiot teenage jokes that later I'll look back on and be thinking "God I was stupid".  In any case I just had to let the world know what peeves me just in case I show up at your house and try to kill you, at least you know why.    P.S.Nani won't stalk and kill you if you go see her pretty pictures at dev-art  www.deviantart/nani-fox.com                                                                                                                                                     much love, nani
