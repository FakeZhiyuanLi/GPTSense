      La ti da, it's Monday and the first day of this second week of band camp and yet I am HYPER! I think I caught the love virus or something...Sorry...MIGHT AS WELL FACE IT YOU'RE ADDICTED TO LOVE!!! Once again, sorry...I'm just excited because I have an actual bf for like the first time in my life considering last time me and Brent were together it lasted for like a week and we didn't go out at all during that week and he said he 'wasn't ready for an emotional commitment.' Ha. Well he better be now. Brittany didn't know until today that we were back together, and now like every time I see her she's like "I am sooooo good" because in truth the fact that I am with Brent once more is almost entirely her doing. If she hadn't told him how I felt for me (and I never would have had the courage to do it) he wouldn't have broken up with Claire and asked me out. Unfortunately I think Claire now hates me. Oh well, if such is the price of love. On an entirely different note, today Krista took me home and she had to go to Bird to pick up a couple people and when we went there we saw the band still practicing. And they was playin' the 'Pirates of the Caribbean' theme!!! I love that song!!! Why don't we get to do cool songs like that?? Oh well. Also I looked for my friends, Sharon who plays trombone, and Kevin the saxaphone player from my church. But I couldn't find them. Oh well. I think that's the third time I've said 'oh well' this post. Oh well. (Hahaha) God I am boring. TWO WEEKS 'TIL BACK 2 SCHOOL AND I STILL HAVEN'T STARTED MY DAMNED RESEARCH PAPER!!! Oh well. ARRGH!!! Okay. Not much else to say - lining the field again tomorrow morning, dang it - so I shall go now...

      Boy, today sure is boring. I wish Kevin would come back and play sax at church again, otherwise it's just me on clarinet and then all these guitars, and Kevin's fun to talk to. I wonder how things are going between him and that girl he met at Harvest of Hope. Surprisingly I'm excited about going back to band camp tomorrow because I get to be with my wonderful bf!!! Even if I did hate him for a day!!! WOOOOOOOT!!! I never thought this would happen, us being back together, but I'm hoping it works out nicely and lasts a whole lot longer than last time, when we were 'official' for about a week...Ha, that's still longer than he was going out with HER, which lasted a whole day...heh...He told me he felt real bad about it, cuz he only went out with her for pity's sake. So of course I had to forgive him. And as Alex says, now there are 3 band couples: her and Matt, Hannah and Greg, and me and Brent! Huzzah! At Drum Major Academy George Parks asked everyone if they had ever dated someone in the band, and a bunch of people raised their hands and he started talking about how band dorks marry band dorks to make new little baby band dorks so that marching bands will continue forever! MWAHAHAHA!!! Er-hem...but we won't look that far into my future just yet. Oh yeah, I can't believe I forgot to put Thursday's horoscope on here! It said (and I quote from the Richmond Times-Dispatch) "Others may rain on your parade, but perhaps you shouldn't be leading the band right now." Is that ironic or what?! But I'm still leading the band. Man, I was just thinking about how awkward it's gonna be when Nick comes back to visit at one of the football games, what with me being drum major AND his semi-ex-gf, when he's (possibly) engaged to a sax player in what is now my band...Ahem. Anywho. Onward and upward, I s'pose. Crap, I gotta get my stupid summer assignments done...arrghhh...

      I am so confused and frustrated it's not even funny. Well, maybe a little. Okay, I take back what I said yesterday about HIM, HE's not a complete asshole, not entirely anyway, in fact yes, it might be possible that I still like HIM a fairly good deal...As long as he breaks up with HER soon as Margie and Brittany told me HE was going to do. Brittany handed me a note during music practice this afternoon and the exact words were (as I pull it out of my pocket): 'he's breaking up w/ [HER] and he says he wants to be w/ you.' So there you have it. Margie told me the same thing on the way to lunch at that cool Chinese place today. Unfortunately, Margie also told me that Anna got a letter from Nick asking her to marry him...I must admit, that was a little disheartening after what me and Nick went through together, I thought he might kinda like me a little, and I mean, he broke up with her months and months ago, and they haven't seen each other in a while...but oh well...hopefully I now have a chance with HIM now (not Nick, the other HIM), and besides if I keep rambling on about Nick HE might think I care more for Nick than I do for HIM if he reads this, which is not true especially now that I know that Nick doesn't love me. In other news, it was fun today at the end of practice because Mr. Conley made us circle up by section inside the bus loop to run through the music once, and I was like "CLARINETS!!! CLARINETS!!!" and I ran through the clarinet section and gave everyone a high five. Then Lindsey told me I had taken too many happy pills. Oh well! And then I told everyone they could go before we did the attitude check...Sarah gave me an annoyed look and then had to blow her whistle and make everyone come back...Heheheh...And that's about it. One week down, one to go. Wish me luck.

      Ok, I'm not gonna name names, but today was pure misery because: HE is now going out with HER so all this time HE has just been leading me on like the s.o.b. HE is. Asshole. If HE never had any serious feelings for me then HE should not have acted towards me the way HE did, making me think HE loved me and not HER. The worst part of it is, at Drum Major Academy they told us we weren't allowed to think anyone in the band was a jerk. Well, too bad. HE is. And now I am entirely unloved and if I don't show up at band camp tomorrow I've most likely killed myself. Mr. Conley can just find someone else to be the other drum major. Maybe Ryan. (Yeah, right.)

      This morning we re-lined the field, only we didn't have to get there extra early after all because Mr. Conley let us do it at the beginning of practice. Also, it wasn't really WE, because one of the liners was locked up in the men's restroom at the football stadium, so Sarah had to line it without my help...Heheh...anywho the lines were straight, then. But they got marched on a lot, and were starting to fade so we went to re-line it again during sectional practice after lunch, and we got the other liner from the bathroom, and then just when I leave to go home later it starts pouring. Sarah was all "It's not gonna rain! We finally got the field lined right, and we're only gonna have to line it like once a week instead of every day! It's not gonna rain!" So of COURSE it rained, and it rained hard...Oh, the humanity! Oh well. Back to the drawing board. Or whatever you wanna call it. Today was incredibly boring and uneventful overall. At least we got a lot of the first song on the field. Well, not really WE, cuz I had no part in it, I just stood there in my own silent hell wishing I could lay down and got to sleep but Sarah told me the band gets mad if I sit down...Such a strange concept...And plus I had to step off the line every time they went back to set 1 or 6, so I guess I had a little importance. I'm boring myself by writing this, so I shall leave you now in peace. Bis bald.

      Got to band camp extra early to line the friggin' field. Now, Sarah didn't bother to tell me that there's this magic STRING you can use to make sure the lines are straight. Sooooo they weren't. In fact Mr. Conley told me they looked like I was drunk when I did them. So we had to do them again after camp today, only we didn't get to cuz it started raining. So NOW I have to get there extra EXTRA early tomorrow to re-line. Phooey. I hate my life. Okay, on to other news...What? What's that you say, Mr. Fitzgerald? There IS no other news? In that case, buh-bye.

      Lookie here! I created a blog...I was actually about to get offline because my one-eyed guinea pig's cage reeks of rodent urine and defecation and I desperately need to change it, but then I was like hey! I've never read my Marlee Bubble's profile before! So I was reading it and I went to her Hometown Homepage and voila, there was a link to her blog, and then I wanted to post a comment but it said I had to be a member! So I'm like, what the hell. So here I am. I am ContraBiscuit. It's a combo of my great fame as Clover Hill's only (current) contra-bass clarinet player, and this kinda inside joke from 1st period health last year, with good ol' Mr. Carter (MISTA KATA!!) and his obsession with biscuits, and then Brent with his whole 'diddly-diddly-bo-dang-biscuit' impersonation of Mr. Carter...I'm going to miss that crazy man this year. Anyhow. So today was the first day of band camp, and I got my first taste of what it's REALLY like to be drum major. Well, I guess second taste, if you count Drum Major Academy. I can already feel my popularity blossoming!...not that I care about popularity, or anything...because I don't, honestly, I'm a total dork anyhow...(takes one to be serious enough about marching band to even try out for the position!) But I'm kinda like 'junior drum major' or something compared to Sarah, she does most of the real work anyhow...I kinda sit there and pretend to be important, like today when she had to help Mr. Conley and I was supposed to go over and see if Mr. Thomsen needed help with percussion. He didn't. So I just sat there for a while, and then he told me to go and work with pit while he worked with the rest of percussion. Only, we didn't really work. I tapped a couple mallets together as a human metronome for a bit, but most of the time we were doing things like Gail coloring in the lid of BJ's smoothie so she couldn't see the fly that had gotten in it somehow, and BJ drawing a very alien-like John Kerry on my hand. Also Sara taught me how to play 'Row Row Row Your Boat' and part of 'Suncat' on the bells. ^_^ This morning me and Sarah got here early to line the field, only the only thing that got done was I screwed up the 50 yard line and made it too fat and such...Oh well. Y'know, I used to have another blog thingy, on a different site, I guess it's still there but I haven't updated it in at least a year. So I'm starting afresh. My mom just got home from the store and she told me when she left that I oughta get off and take care of my immortal guinea pig so I best be going. And thus I leave you.
