      Ive gotten through the day! I'm all cheered up now :) - well much more than earlier! After dozing in bed with the re-surfaced and fresh demons, i started to beat them off and worked up the energy to get up and have a shower.  Mike phoned, he's gonna treat me to the cinema tmr - wow, mike opens his wallet, watch the cineworld foyer fill with moths ;-)  Ive decided to go and see "The Ring", I will talk a coupla other people into coming to see it though :)   Maybe I could be cheeky and switch venue from Ilford to the Empire LSq?....... *waits to hear Mikes wallet shut*  Then as I was walking down to Sainsburys, Gen called, hehe, she was just down the road from me at the train station!! I went and said "hi", which was nice and a throughly surprising and unplanned part of the day.  I resisted the urge to goto the gig at Harlow, even though I really wanted to go. I had no ticket, I wasn't on anyones list - or supposedly on anyones list, I reckoned it would be hard to do a 'casual' blag.. and if I'd've gone down there and not gotten in I prob would've ended up very visually and verbally pissed off. I know that Gen and Lauren got in, hope it was good :)  I stuck to my plan, went round Paul's and watched "My Big Fat Greek Wedding" with him, Andy and Steven. Such a lovely and funny film. I was munching on Norfolks finest Kettle Chips and Jaffa cakes, not the healthiest of snacks, but so nice!  Today's been the hardest day I care to remember, I think I'm doing well coming out the other side of it though. I feel as though I can get to work on Monday and keep the funds coming in! I also feel as though the pieces are starting to add up properly in my head, I think I now know for  defiante what I want and who I am  - not that I never did, just past uncertainties always got the better of me. Ive always been headstrong, Ive always achieved what I wanted to, even if my sights have always dwarfed what most people would deem "normal". In the past a few people have called me  "very naive" , in planning or whilst working some have said my  "attitude is slightly arrogant" ... in response I would say that I am in fact  ambitious and determined, I know what I want to achieve and I do whatever I can to get there . This is now more the case than ever.  My aim in life is to be happy and enjoy myself, both personally and professionally. I don't need, nor do i particulary want, a grand lifestyle, life is only as good as the immediate people that surround you and the company that you keep. Sure, demons will always be there lurking in the background, Ive now learnt how to keep them at bay. My close friends have been great recently, I rarely call on them in this way, its nice to know they're there and keeping me going, I'm always going to be there for them. Currently life is good, lets hope it continues that way.    --> Now Playing: Coldplay "Parachutes" album --> Now Playing: Elastica "Elastica" album

      I FEEL LIKE A COMPLETE AND UTTER CUNT. I've completely fucked up what was planned this weekend, I think Ive upset someone that I care (or used to care?) about.  Somebody do something to get me out of this mood, I cant stand this in - out - in - out. My head is totally being fucked with, again. Someone set me straight. I want to be my normal self again, thats not too much to ask for is it?????    If any of my friends need me, phone the mobile, but let it ring! :)  I was knee deep, briefly.   --> Talking to Andy on MSN

      There's nowt on the tele at the moment, so I've put a record on.  I've just had to do something really nasty. I've kinda had to let someone down bigtime, and I  never  let friends down, its just not me..... but these are different circumstances. To start off with there isnt a method of transport that can get me there and back in time for work on Monday and for under £100, and I really cant afford that kinda money for a one night trip. The fact that I'd have a minimum of 12 hours journey time I could live with..... kinda. I know that the person I'm supposed to be visiting will be more than a little pissed if I dont show, and for some annoying and unknown reason that upsets me and still gets to me.   I feel so fuckin torn at this current moment in time. Thats the only word I can think of at the moment to describe my head!!!   Ive gotta thank my mates for putting up with me the past few days, I must seem quite annoying, but they're only telling me what I'm already well aware of and I thank them for doing so. :)   At times like this, wise words you hear in movies or in scripts or in books or poetry really come into their own.... “Don’t let your past dictate your future, but allow your past to become part of who you are.” I shouldn't let past events in my life affect / fuck up my now or my future, the past few days they seem to have. I should be letting experience make me much stronger, there's no time for dwelling, just learn, forget the bad and be better for it.   It just proves, that without the sour, you can never fully appreciate just how sweet the sweet is. I've had lots of sour, but never really experienced the sweet, the sour has lasted for what seems like an eternity.   It would be nice to have some sweet.    --> Now Playing: The Raveonettes "Attack Of The Ghost Riders"     Fuckin rah of a record that fuses so many brilliant and diverse influences, just the fuckin kick up the backside guitar music needs.

      Friday morning briefing at the Whitehouse... "finally sir, your village in Texas called, aparantly they've lost their  urlLink idiot ".   urlLink www.rocktography.co.uk/antiwardemo    It's been a week since the march in London, and now we're being told it's our moral responsibilty for war in Iraq, first its about WoMD, then its about ousting a dictator, now its morally right?? Stop the spin machine, we can all see through it Mr Blair. If today's news is anything to go by America's already made it's mind up, war is unfortuantely enevitable, the US machine knows no limits, powers wherever it likes, does whatever it wants and is the law.....

      I've been lazy today. I pretty much went straight back to bed after I woke up, waking at a few random points during the day! I don't get much time off work, so I'm going to enjoy these few days!!  I'm going to do some work on my Rocktography site now....

      I am watching the Brits.... what the fuck is going on?  I mean I've always known its a silly hyped excuse for a British version of the Grammy's, but this is just embarrasing for the music industry. Why is Davina McCall presenting from amongst the audience? This isnt a tv show, its a awards ceremony. Having the stars sitting in seats just doesn't work, it's copying the yanks, its bland and looks too formal - Why couldn't they keep the tables? If its because its an attempt to reduce trouble, thats what is great about the Brits!  And what's with announcing the nominees via these silly "commercial radio styleeeee" beat mixes?   And why are Blue performing? And whats with that Afro - ur trying to look like Lenny Kravitz!  LIBERTY X shouldn't have won the award for Best Single - in fact in truth they haven't. The Award should be going to their songwriters (after all its best song), and the producers of the record..... they are merely 5 minute vox poppers.  For the first time ever I feel the Brits is all about giving pop prince's and princesses awards to make them and the public think they have enough musical ability to have won them.   Heh, the sugababes are on - thats another few quid in Gary Numan's pocket! :D  (yes I am feeling better!)

      Thank someone for music, and thank someone else for lyrics.  My PC just started playing "Fat Bottemed Girls" by Queen, which made me think of the last entry, and made me laugh (I am creul).... GOOD music makes the World go round, and keeps everyone going :o)  I'm going to New York in April :D :D :D :D :D I'm looking for websites, things to do, places to go, blah..... I personally want to experience everything the place has to offer, the touristy stuff, the shows, the theatres  the live music , the "lounges". I found this to help learn more about the venues  urlLink http://www.ny.com/clubs/pop/ , but havent found any gig listing sites yet. If anyone from NYC reads this, and can tell me something cool to do, a place I must see that tourists dont know about, good NYC websites, etc, then drop me a mail (link is at the top of the page).   --> Now Playing - Queen "Fat Bottomed Girls"

      I should apologise for my current mood.  Some  VERY  old demons have done more than come back to haunt me. In fact they've sent me back to an awful frame of mind, making me feel lots of old nasty feelings from a certain time and whats WORSE is two years down the line I'm now able to reflect at what this one person has done to screw me up. My friends know who I'm talking about, I need not say any more. In a bizzare way I'm glad this has happenned, it's made me realise just how much anguish this person has caused me, just two days before I was due to go upto Glasgow to visit her and give her a free night out on the town at a Feeder gig, poss going backstage to meet the bands too.... Why should I do something so kind for someone who (at the end of the day) has caused me more pain than anyone else ever has done before?  Now the thing is this person has just emailed me... just when I was starting to feel better :-/  I  will  snap out of this mood - btw for anyone who knows me now that didnt know me back then, in comparison to what I was like 2 years ago..... my current mood was developed from just dipping my toe into that black lagoon.   Anyone got a good joke?  --> now playing - cRapital FM - and it really is that - Daniel fuckin bloody Beddinfield fuckin depressing the shite outta me STOP SINGING STOOPID BLOODY "EMOTIONAL" CHEESEY SONGS ...... methinks I shall change the radio station. --> Talking to Jon and Mike on MSN

      Rah, it looks like I finally have a "blog".  I've been deliberating on this for aaages, I've friends who have similar things, and whilst they're great for getting things off your chest, they can be the most dangerous things on the web. Holding back aint the point on blogs, but unfortunately you have to make some events slightly ambiguous just in case the person you write about logs on and reads your comments.   I try not to read my friends online diaries as a result, I find that if I need to know something I'm told, if I'm thinking about what someones upto or am worried about them, I'll phone, text or email, if someone wants to share an annoyance with me, or generally wants to moan or wants my advice, they'll ask.....  so if I'm against doing myself a blog, howcomes I've just set one up?  Well the honest truth is I'm mainly doing this for ME, I want to write things about what I'm upto, what I'm thinking or feeling or listening too. I'm far too unorganised to log this myself, and cant be bothered to write to code for a system like this, but for a few things I'm planning on doing over the next 1/5/10 years having a little store where I want things written down as I recall them at the time, filled with the emotion I associate with what Im writing about, cause over time you can easily recall a story but the feelings you tag are (usually) worn away and lost.  - on a side to that - Cameron Crowe used to make mix tapes every few weeks labelled with just a date. When he listened back to them whilst writing and prepping "Almost Famous" he felt through the music and the lyrics just what he was experiencing at that moment in time. It helped him write an extra real quality to the film (in my opinion), on top of what was essentially a very personally written script. Thats kinda what this is about - expect random song lists or lyrics lists!.... I did this on an old "me" page, and whilst recently reading it back, found it amazing just how remembering the songs u rocked to at a certain time jogged extra memories.  I'm not expecting people to read this / enjoy this / understand this, if they do then I've no problem with sharing my mad worldview with them! I've got no problem with my  best  friends reading this, they'll be aware and prob mentioned by name, cause I mainly only have nice things to say about the most amazing and wonderful peeps I know (for the record thats Gen, Andy, Mike, Paul, Stevo, Pam, Cath - hi guys, u know you all fucking rock!), and if I ever have anything to say or question with these peeps, they'll know long before I ever consider writing it. From time to time I may write something extremely ambiguous or something that doesn't make sense, that will prob be because its something that only I'm (or a few others) meant to understand... as I said, this blog is mainly for me. hehe   ....on with the show?  --> now playing - Norah Jones "Come Away With Me" album --> talking to Lauren on MSN, Gen on txt

      Did anyone see Eastenders tonight?   It was so great, for once!  The end sequence was lovely, everyone in Albert Square was happy (almost), it was so well done.  Dean Gaffney (Robbie) may be pissed off at being written out, but they did it with absolute fuckin style, methinks that he can be proud of that. Better than being blown up, better than being mowed down by Martin Fowler, it was such a nice episode.  ....and Gus and Sonia!!!!! hehe u know that its gonna pick up! The episode where Sonia dumped Gus and got back with Jamie after Phil beat the crap outta him was just the best... the acting by the guy who plays Gus was just so brill, he deserves big things. When I make my film he's going to be in it.

      Oh how I laughed.. Mike sent me a text msg by accident... "Did you get your BJ then put on your tie like a good little boy?" - or words to that effect! I shalln't embarress anyone further in case any of his mates read this, seeing as Mike so very kindly linked his blog to mine!!!!! :D  OH how I LOL again!!!! mehehhehe   Yesterday whilst running round Ilford, I bought the new Directors Cut Special edition DVD of "True Romance" as a bday present for Paul next week... tonight I discovered he went out and bought it TODAY, how fucking annoying is that. I told him he can have the disc and the receipt, he's another big present anyway, so its not the end of the World. Quentin Tarantino has written a very brief sleeve note, funnily enough on the sleeve! It says:   "People have asked me:  'So would you ever do a romance movie?' like that's  so not  what I would do.  'Well I did a romantic movie,  True Romance .'  'No, no, I mean like a  real  romantic movie.'  'No, like one without violence?'  Well, there'll be a lot of things in any movie I do that will be contradictory, but anybody who's a fan of the movie can tell you, the title - True Romance - is not ironic ... this is True Romance."    ...methinks I shall be watching this one before I do actually hand it over to Paul, prob two viewings, second with Tarantino's commentry, i doubt they'll be a second of dead air on that, from what I've seen of him before he sure knows how to talk. In fact I've an overwhelming urge to watch Res Dogs, Pulp Fiction AND Jackie Brown again, I tend to watch them every few months. Roll on Kill Bill, that looks so fing good.  I went to check out the fuss that is "Meanwhile, back in communist Russia...." last night. Interesting stuff, First impressions were good, Ive got the CD now, so I shall listen intensely a few times. Photos of the band are here  urlLink www.rocktography.co.uk/mbicr   I'm really looking forward to seeing Span on Monday night, they totally rock, I just downloaded "Baby's Come Back", apart from laughing my ass off at the fake orgasm sequence, it's so deserving of the Aerosmith comparison. Watch out America,  Span  are coming over the pond soon for a few gigs in March aparantly. You can read mine and Gen's interview with their guitarist Joff  urlLink here .  I finally got some sleep, about 4hrs after work this afternoon. I must now make sure I sleep tonight, else that catch up will be useless to me.    --> Now playing - Aerosmith "Big Ones" - their ORIGINAL greatest hits package!!!

Mike's only back in the country for a lil bit, so this is his idea...... not that I'm complaining, its a fantastic show, a fantastic night out. heh, but Mike owes me dosh, so he's having to pay for my ticket. :-D  the leather on that wallet has never been as stretched as it has been the past week back here in the UK!!! hahahahahhahahahahahahahahahahaha  I feel quite sleepy, the past few days have been long.

      I was back at work today, theres nothing like a busy day back!!  Servers crashed, printing stopped, admin tools went loopy bonkers for a brief time. It was all a bit bizzare, my head remained cool thankfully (either that or I just wasnt awake enough to take it all in properly).   I saw "The Ring" last night, it was enjoyable, yet disappointing. On one front, an interesting take on the urban myths style of horror, absolutely fantastic photography and a general air of creepyness. On the other, a terrible script, an awful back story incl the whole cutesy Haley Joel Osmand effect kid, and something that didnt sacre me or make me jump at all (the biggest let down). Admitidly the TV effect towards the end was extremely impressive (I wont reveal what it is), and I did have to think about the ending. I didn't get why everyone else in the theatre was so freaked out though, hmmmm, I must be a pretty desensitised individual. Out of sheer curiosity Ive ordered that and the original version on DVD. I've also a great idea for an in-movie prank.  I want to take some photo's this week, I havent been able to do any for a while. I might pop down to see Meanwhile Back In Communist Russia and snap them, just to quench my thirst.    --> Now Playing - Sugar Hill Gang "Rappers Delight" classic TUUUNNNNEEEEE on cRapital FM

      My Nan has just died.  I knew she was ill, I think I only told a couple of people when I heard she might've been developing flu mid-week.  I awoke after just a few hours sleep to the sound of my twin sister absolutely balling her eyes out. She absolutely adored my Nan, through all my sisters' illness and prodding and poking, my Nan's been the main comfort thats always been there for her. She then sought solace in the CD I bought her for xmas - "Now (whatever its upto)", the first track of which was DJ Sammi's awful beatbox version of "Heaven", shortly followed by "The Ketchup Song" and Blue's "One Love". :-/   I'm just glad I wasn't off in Glasgow for the weekend doing God knows what! Everything does happen for a reason it seems.  My nan died in a Nursing Home, in a bed that will probably occupy someone else in a week or so. I find that really sad. Whether you wither away peacefully, or pop off suddenly, I'd like to think that you could do it surrounded by four warm and familiar walls. You know, you spend all your life building something up, it would be nice to die surrounded by your legacy, rather than some dreary NHS owned steralised building, whilst some rogue cleaner hoovers the floor at your side. One accident put my nan there, I wont go into that now, but its sad how one simple thing changes your life so drastically.  I'm not looking forward to seeing my Uncle when he re-surfaces for all this. If there's one role model you strive not to be like in life, then he is it. He's sleazy, and in a word, a total cunt. This is the man who, when my nan first went into hospital/nursing home a couple of years ago, lived in and remodeled her house rent free. He dipped into and lived off his mums savings and pension. If that wasn't bad enough, he talked my nan (his mum) into selling the family home - from our point of view this was because he was short on cash. Even though I gained several thousand pounds from this tranasaction myself, I always thought his actions were wrong, and never felt comfortable with the dosh. I felt it was almost like dirty money, and thus spent a lot of it on my friends. We haven't heard from him since the day he moved out of the house. I therefore find it ironic that my Nan's legitimate passing (when the house should have been sold) to come at the exact time that is regarded the peak of the housing boom.   Bad humour aside, I shed a few tears when that house was sold. I have a few tears welling up in my eyes now.   Secretly this is going to destroy my Dad, I should be here for my family over the next few days.  RIP Nan.

      Today was my Nan's funeral.  It was simple and old fashioned - with lots of flowers - just the way my Nan would've liked it. It was also very emotional, as all funeral's are. Because I haven't seen my Nan properly for a while, because it's been so many years since Nan had to move into a Nursing home, things hadn't really hit me until this morning. I did start to cry when the coffin came into the Church, it was impossible not to, but crying is a good thing at the end of the day. (-------- edits sentance out on reflection due to chesseyness --------)  It was nice to see some old relatives today too. Most of the "ooooh aint he grown" embarrasing crap was spared, for they were more interested in my little niece! :)  I also met a new member of the family today, my cousin Gary has got a teeny weeny baby to look after now.....it's at the nice age when they can't make any noises and make everyone go all gooey! hehehe  In other news..... it looks like a little trek to Brighton is gonna happen, all to rock out to the rock brilliance of Span. It's hard to describe just how good this band are, they are as sharp and as loud and tight and as fuckin rocked up as Aerosmith, yet less American, more fun, more cheeky..... hmmmm  I like mad stupid kamikaze trips too, where you have to get somewhere and back in one night, and then get up at the crack of dawn for work the next morning!!!   Tmr - back at work, then a brief trip to PC World to exchange something, followed by what will be a fantastic celebratory dinner with Paul, Andy and Mike, then onto watch We Will Rock You in the West End.... I am singing already, "Weeeee are the chaaaaaampions my frieeeeend.....",   "these aaareee the daaaaays of our lives.....", "she's a killeeerr, queeeeeeeeennn...". And so on. And so on. And Ariston.   --> Now playing - Simon & Garfunkel "Bridge Over Troubled Water" --> Now playing - Simon & Garfunkel "The Sound Of Silence" --> Now playing - SPAN "Stuck In The Middle" --> Quote - "Everybody's got something to hide, except me and my monkey"

      Yeh, so, last night I went to see Winnebago Deal (bit noveltyish, but still good), Colour of Fire (impressive) and Span (FUCKIN ROCK!!). Jarle from Span is starting to look like Justin Timberlake, due to a sudden shaven head it all becomes so clear! Over 200 photos taken last night, many crap, some good (link below)  Because I'm a complete pleb, I lost my glasses (that or they were stolen). What's more stupid is I told the bar staff that they were CK (just to help ID them). They weren't!!!! They were Emporio Armani! *angry with self* even if they were found, which is very very unlikely, I'll never see them babies again. First thing of the day (other than waking up) was to get to the opticians, which was fine, apart from this new test they do where they puff a short burst of air into your eye for some reason:-   Nice girl doing tests: "This may make you jump a little, but don't worry"    *PUFF*    *I DO MORE THAN JUMP, I GO FLYING BACK ACROSS THE ROOM - if there were a slot machine behind me to slam into, I wud've hit jackpot!!*    Me: "I'm sorry that test is so wrong. You shouldn't do things to your eyes like that.... ok.. so I'm squemish when it comes to eyes...."    Nice Girl: *laughs*  "That's ok, its a normal reaction"    Me: "If it were anything else I could handle it, but go near the eyes..... and... y'know..."    Nice Girl: *laughs again* "Don't worry, it's not essential, we dont have to do it, I didnt get the reading I needed anyway."    So they put people through medieval torture for no real reason???  Anyway, the rest was fine, I got new glasses, ironically (bearing in mind my gaffe above) they're CK frames!   I also took my niece to McD's and the flicks to see the Wild Thornberry's movie just so she was outta my parents hair whilst they get the house ready for the funeral tmr.

      I was working on my computer until 4am... I was putting in the first of three new things - a replacement CDwriter... but this error bubble kept on coming up when I looged on. I read up on it, and its all to do with an old version of Easy CD Creator, then uninstalling it before I put on a new version of the software - this was done about a year ago!!! Bottom line EASY CD CREATOR 4 / EASY CD CREATOR 5 FUCK UP YOUR MACHINE IF YOU HAVE WINDOWS XP - sue me for slander if that ain't the case, but I went through the official Microsoft fix and it still didn't go away, I then deleted every single Adaptec/Roxio/Easy CD Creator registry key left on my PC MANUALLY, which took the best part of an hour!! It still popped up with the error. BAH, at least the new writer works with Nero.  Shortly onto formatting my new slave drive :)  Had a nice evening at a family friends house last night and a groovy afternoon's worth of shopping with Stevo up in town. hehhee we got something to eat after, wangled our way down to the cheapest and best pizza place in town - ICCo (International Coffee Company) on Goodge St - theres a tip for any potential tourists.   -------- ADVERTISEMENT ------------  NOKIA 3510 FOR SALE.

      Stage one of Comic Relief bad hair do complete. And (unfortunately) it really is bad..... I got the colouring hair moose, and it all went terribly wrong. To start off with I misfired the can all over my parent's newly refurbished bathroom!! Eventually it went a slight shade of red, which has kinda freaked me out. Then I gelled it back from the mess it was in cause I had to pop out, it was soon realised that my scalp had completely gone a dark shade of red :o   I managed to get to sketchers before closing time for my new shoes, but seeing as everything was closing and i was getting looks (in my paranoid mind at least) I decided to come home.....   ...I could've gone to a gig at the Underworld tonight. Would've liked to have at least seen Redjetson, I prob would've gone in the end, although minus camera cause the batteries were dead, but the bad hair was the final nail in the coffin... it seems I do therefore care a little about my appearance, which is surprising.   Oh well, at least the hair and quality of being able to make a complete pillack outta myself on request will all be for a good cause tommorrow :)  I will stop typing here cause I need sleep!   --> Now Playing - BBC2 TV, Old Grey Whilstle Test highlights show.

      Not writing about today as such, as there's not much to tell about me!!!  Todays entry is all about this coming FRIDAY. Here in the UK it's "Comic Relief" day, I'm not sure if the american's have this, methinks Billy Crystal and Robin WIlliams did do something once, but the idea was nicked from the genius' in Britain ;-) Here in the UK people don Red Noses and do stupid fun things to raise huge amounts of WONGA for some extremely serious causes both here and in Africa. Its my favourite national charity-come telethon....   The theme for this years RND is "Bad Hair Do Day", seeing as I did something very similar last time round, I have no hesitation in adopting the official line! Ive just bought Red Hair dye, and will be giving myself a bad hair do. Now folks, this is where we get INTERACTIVE! Vote for which hair-do I have!!!     Which one? number 1, 2 or 3??? Let me know by voting here -  urlLink http://www.fortheloveofit.org/board/showthread.php?s=efe13488c824f1619192fff13cdf9c37&threadid=91  - I don't think you have to be a member to vote, so click away... and get other people to vote too! :)  After some initial questions, "are you going to....." and much hilarity on a few parties (incl meself) I'm not bleaching my hair for this... I read the can and it says "Not reccommended for bleached hair" :D Result eh?  BTW - Can I also add.... GO GEN! RAH GEN! \m/ - she'll know what that's about. :)     --> Now playing - Turin Brakes "Ether Song"

      First of all, I forgot to write this last night..... it appears that I've become a regular at a place in London!!!! There's this little cafe just off Leicester Sq, opposite the Warner Cinema, called "Cafe Rimini". They do the usual beverages, and cook chips, kebabs, and do fresh sarnies, bagels, slices of pizza and ciabatta's...that kinda place. Well, whenever I'm in a rush and need something hot and filling to eat, and am passing near L Sq, i've started popping in there to get a toasted ciabatta with cheese (cause I'm a funny eater). Last night one of the guy's that worked there asked me where I worked... he thought it was nearby because I go in there often, now I know my order is somewhat bizzare, but I never thought they'd remember me.. I mean I go in there about once a week or so. SO yeh, it seems as though they class me as a regular, which is really cool, cause I love their food and service, AND I've never been a regular anywhere before!!! GO GET SOME GRUB THERE IF YOU PASS!  Tonight I went to see Colour of Fire (who are pretty good, loadsa potential), and Placebo's first London gig for yonks... it was all to promote the new single and imminent album. Gen managed to rustle me up a ticket, cause she's just tooooo fuckin rah for her own good! :) Placebo were a bit of a yawn, a few good songs, then it just became kinda stale and plodding and generally yawn enducing, which is a shame. We sat in the bar for about the last 25 minutes, which was fun.   Work in six and a half hours...... and counting......   Now Playing --> Ron Sexsmith and Chris Martin "Gold In Them Hills" on repeat. Lovely tune.

      Ive spent the entire weekend indoors at home. It's quite nice to stay in, watch tele, play on the net, strum some guitars... but went out tonight, started feeling a bit one-dimensional!! Went to see "The Ring" for a second time, it was on at the Empire, which being a HUGE screen and with The Ring being fantastically photographed and edited film, was a tempting combination. Unfortunately when we got there the Empire was SHUT!!!!!... there was the premiere of "The Life Of David Gale" there!! Bloody Cheek! ;-) Ended up going to watch it at the UGC in the Trocedero, which was a teeeny weeeeny icckle little screen! Ah well, never mind. I just hope that Kevin Spacey and Kate Winslet were both a few walls from me, and that the premiere that shut the cinema was worthwhile.  Got to goto bed... nite!

      Its been a few days since I posted... Ive been out quite a bit, so it's nice to sit back at my PC.  Sunday night I went to watch Roman Polanski's "The Pianist", I urge you ALL to go and see this. I will say no more at the moment as I'm keeping this entry brief!  I've taken nearly 500 photos over Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday nights, currently I'm sifting through and sorting them out, will post links to them when I finish. Last night was a real fun adventure, trekked down to Brighton to catch the mighty Span, again, will type more about that later!  Kind of a boring entry eh?

      Ive had a very shit evening out. Most of it was caused by the staff at ULU (University of London Union), holding me up, checking for this, checkin for that, making me feel like a general criminal.... however after lots of grief I did finally get to meet and (albeit briefly) interview the musician Jesse Malin - and he's a lovely guy, very in control of what he's doing, making sure I got some interview time after being mucked around. He even got me a cold beer, and we shared some of the provided whisky on his ryder! Shame the ULU people are a bunch of cunts.   The past week has bought a stream of ideas to me, creatively and things to do with peeps... its been a good week, slowly its starting to bring an end to my writers block! Ive currently two ideas for possible scripts, I was working on one last night, whilst simultaneously doing websites n stuff... im working on it now again at this late hour.  ive just been speaking quite deeply with Mike for a long time on MSN, he's concerned about me!

      First of all, well done Gen :o)  I'm in an annoyingly cheery/talkative mood... annoying because Ive still got a sore throat leftover from last weeks fever/flu and it keeps on making me cough!  I've just gotten back from seeing "Confessions of a Dangerous Mind", which aint bad, just aint at all brilliant either. Thing is like everything else George Clooney seems to have creative input or control over, it's an  attempt  at doing something with style, with little substance. There's no point in doing something with huge grand images, if they mean absolutely nothing. It was also pointed out to me that there was not a single character in the film you could sympathise with... which is very true.  The other thing... in an attempt to do something clever or "twist"worthy, they planted a mole in the story that had to be seeked. I don't normally give away endings, but I'm letting nothing slip here that isnt blatently obvious... COME ON!!!...it was so damnned obvious that Julia Roberts was the mole, dont put in a twist that aint clever, cause it is in fact lame.  Although it was quite amusing, the brief matt damon and brad pitt cameos just make me think this was another steven soderbourgh / george clooney, new rat pack, quickly made movie.   ONE thing I will give it though, a very very very funny scene taking the piss outta the FCC.    ---> If you haven't yet heard or seen of this, go read it -  urlLink http://dearraed.blogspot.com/

       Whoa. On behalf of our producers Kathleen Glynn and Michael Donovan from Canada, I'd like to thank the Academy for this. I have invited my fellow documentary nominees on the stage with us, and we would like to - they're here in solidarity with me because we like non-fiction.   We like non-fiction and we live in fictitious times. We live in the time where we have fictitious election results that elects a fictitious president. We live in a time where we have a man sending us to war for fictitious reasons.   Whether it's the fictition of duct tape or fictition of orange alerts we are against this war, Mr Bush. Shame on you, Mr Bush, shame on you. And any time you got the Pope and the Dixie Chicks against you, your time is up. Thank you very much.

      Heylo everyone!  Its been a busy week. Work has been full on. At home I've done a little work on For The Love Of It, a LOT of work on Rocktography and I've become hooked on watching the Beatles Anthology DVD set I bought on Monday. It all equals little sleep!!! I'm tired.  ....when it comes to my new baby, Rocktography, well its almost ready to roll! I've just got to finish off the main content - the gallery, the credits, the recommended stuff - plus a bit of tidying/tweaking. However, I thought people might like a sneaky peek! Anyone reading this, go and check  urlLink http://www.rocktography.co.uk/index2.htm  to have a look at the site and half its eventual content! OH! and tag the TAGboard!!.... I wanna know who's been there. :)      ....just to tempt anon people over there, Ive photos of numerous bands currently, The Raveonettes, No Doubt, My Vitriol, Seafood, Martin Grech, Span, The Beatings, THe D4, etc on there already. There's numerous other bands to come, just gotta sort through them and format the pictures.  I was supposed to be out watching The Dopamine Theory again tonight, I'm hoping that they're playing the gig I'm co-planning, they said they would, I just gotta get them to confirm the date with me. Annoyingly, I've been forced to stay in..... my dad was called away to some emergency meeting, and my mum had to take everyone else out - she didn't have a door key. SO, muggin's here has had to stay in all night for the sole purpose of letting everyone back in shortly! Pleased I am not.  On the off chance that anyone from New York or Coney Island (or anyone from that area) is reading this -  urlLink drop me an email!!  Myself and some fellow mad people are coming over in two weeks, and I've love to have some tips of places to go, things to do, places to eat, etc... not just touristy stuff, but the real hidden gems that only locals know about!   I can't think of anything else to write at the moment, so shall leave you.  --> Currently watching - Question Time on BBC1 --> About to listen to - Mclusky "Mclusky Do Dallas" --> About to watch - either - Beatles Anthology Ep 2 - OR - Jerry Maguire

      Ello ello.  Tonights gig was very weird, well not the gig as such, more the venue.  We were at the Hope and Anchor to see Pam's band  urlLink Terrapin , who were most excellent. They're getting better with each gig - photos coming soon. But the venue... well, the guy on the door was weird the second I went in, asking me questions about my aftershave??!?!??! The bkg music was a mixture of dusty springfield / petula clark easy listening, funked out Kelis and random dancey tracks like Aphex Twin stuff.... a v weird selection clumped together. The second band, Atraxi, or summin, were totally bland, devoid of tuning or contrasting chord sequences, tones or melodies. HOWEVER, they had the most kickass drummer ever, how on earth did a drummer so good get with two other tuneless goiks?? Hmmmm....  maybe I'm just a bit droopy eyed today, but it was a bizzare night. We left before the end.   I'm waiting to see if Andy decides to come round and watch a DVD or two with moi, doubt he will.... until then, downloading some rather relaxing classical gas for someone :)   --> Now Playing - The Beatles "Abbey Road" album   --> Thought of the day - "Three weeks till New York!"

      Long time no viddy!  I've spent the last week in New York City, was a tremendously fun and interesting week, some bits were great, some bits totally sucked... For starters, I can now officially confirm that I absolutely HATE plane take offs, their great fun, yet they shake the shit around inside me. It's especially worse if I haven't flown for a while. After five minutes flying is just a long bore until the most brilliant landing - which I should be more afraid of seeing as it's the most dangerous part of the process - turbulence as you come down, danger of dropping too much too quickly, slight chances of missing the runway...  anyway it was a great week with two of my best friends, Andy and Gen, and Sara, who this time last week I didn't know.  I'll write more about New York later, including how I nearly got the four of us arrested :)    Right now I'm planning the next couple of weeks back at home and dreaming over the jetlag that I can slowly feel creeping upon me

      I saw Marilyn Manson tonight at the Brixton academy.. I've just gotten in, it takes aaaages to get home!  In short I have to say it was amongst one of the most boring gig's I've ever been to. The set was full of, what is, largely bad new material and stupid, silly, pointless and unimpressive theatrics. I went because I haven't seen MM before, they're a band you have to see, I like some of their songs and hoped that the show would be entertaining. How wrong I was. Don't think I'll bother next time.  I don't want to goto work tommorrow. I'm not going to type it all up here - I think I'm heading towards a total nervous breakdown the way things are going. I'd rather be penniless and happy, than comfortable and depressed for the large part of the day. Does that make sense?

I'm just another acquaintance.  Totally dispensible at a moments notice. You never feel my prescence.  But somehow that don't bother me, and I keep coming back for more. You've become my world, my inspiration. The one I truely adore.   I'm going to miss you with a vengeance, with pain I've not yet realised. But for me, I must do it. So for now, I say goodbye.

      I'm listening to an advance copy of the span album, this is gonna be a killer album when they get round to releasing it!  Thing is, live, they're just totally mind blowing, full of energy, it's impossible not to like them and impossible to not dance. On record one thing is I can listen to the lyrics carefully - which you don't ness do at a gig. It's nice to know that even though they're fun band, their lyrics aren't all "i fancy this girl...", "oh the heartache...", etc, etc, in fact some of the lyrics are quite meaningful. I might post some up here over the next few days.  Just opened up  urlLink Rocktography  - it's not finished just yet, but the gates have to be unlocked at some point!

Ranging from minging to REALLY crap, trying to keep myself happy, no point in getting depressed. Might go and see the doc tmr if my head is still hurting after the injury the other day, just to be certain.

      Weird and relaxing weekend.  Weird 'cause I injured my head yesterday afternoon - I stood up with speed and didnt notice the open roof window directly above my head. Bye bye small chunk of head and hair!! My head bled for a while, thankfully my blood clots properly, but its been exceptionally sore and bruised ever since. Ive felt quite weak and queasy as a result too :S    Relaxing 'cause Ive done next to nothing! Just been chilling in the sun. Yesterday worked on a small website, and spent several hours making a nice poster for a gig Im putting on. Today slept in cause I was online chatting on MSN till about half 2, then watched half of The Pianist.. got up about 1, browsed the net, popped to the shops briefly, watched the hilarious MTV movie awards and been working on a remix :)   nice  Chat more later.. .

      Geees, long and fun few days... will tap about Thursday later!  Today, well, I have spent the day dashing around london in Andy's car!!!.. y'see last night i was chatting with miss Gen, and apart from a bizzare few moments where I seemed to be continually praising her belly (which confusingly, she hates), we were talking about this skirt that she's making. I gave her some proper fender guitar volume knobs that I bought whilst we were in NYC, she's going to attach them to a skirt that she's making. At first it was "how am i gonna get these onto the skirt", then it was "wouldn't it just be totally rad if they also twiddled??". My mind thought for a second ot two, and then it hit me!!!.. I designed a little contraption that would not only allow the knob to be attached to the belt, but would also allow it to be twiddled and turned!    We thrashed it out - mainly me trying to explain it using just words, which wasnt easy. I phoned a mate who knows a bit more about DIY, he said my idea would work perfectly and would be fairly simple to do! So I said today I would set out to get these contraptions made. and that's what I did! ...except we got to a certain point when we realised that it would be far better for us to have one of the knobs to get all the dimensions perfect. Cue my phone not working properly, but eventually arranging to go pick up one of the knobs from gen.. hop in andys car, up the stop start stop start stop A12 - where we also got verbally abused by a bus driver for being in the wrong lane (IE bus lane), get to gen's place, spend some time there and get the knob, leave gen's, drive over tower bridge four times because andy can't differentiate between left and right and therefore got us back in a one way system, back up the A13 to B&Q at Beckton, buy required goods to make contraption, buy andy a mc'd's as bribery/thank you thing, get back to ilford. Round at Paul's Steve sets about getting this done in the worskhop, it's an easy thing to make, dont take too long, just have to wait for the super super super glue to dry (which it still hasn't fully). Then buy Steve the pizza I used to bribe him for help!!!!! Watched Casualty, then came home after a coupla beers.  Between me and my sis we get this all working on a small bit of material!! and it all works!   So one whole day, and I've found a way of getting gutiar knobs not just attached to clothes, but also in a way whereby they can be twiddled!! It's what everyone needs in thier lives wouldn't you say? :D  Just gotta get them on Gen's new skirt now, which isn't finished yet. heh, she's gonna be too cool for school with this!  :))   If this works well, I still reckon she should start selling these clothes!.. Im gonna patent the guitar knob to clothes idea though! haha   and that's about all i have to write about today. I'm absolutely knackered, it's been a wonderful day though :)    as I said shall write about thursday later...

      I still have the entrystamp from last night on my hand! I love that! :)  Went to watch, support, dance to and photograph Miss Black America last night. They played the Water Rats in Kings Cross, first band on (cant remember name, don't want to remember!) were, erm, politely.... SHITE. Could barely pick a guitar string with any love or any resonant tone - just a feeling of, 'well its this note next....'. What was worse was that they kept on thinking that they were brilliant.. and that their songs were "beautiful"..... NEVER EVER go on stage and say, 'this next song, is just, well, beautiful...' cause if it isnt I will just walk away and goto the bar. I did.  The second band were Blofeld. Not heard of them before... not quite sure what I thought, they weren't quite rock, weren't quite funk/pop.. but my, the first four songs had one helluva groove going on. The frontman was energetic, and not ott... good music, worth checkin again if I get the chance.   Miss Black America.. amen.... entertaining they are. Mr Seymour is such a happy chappy :)    Photos of the latter two bands are up on  urlLink www.rocktography.co.uk/missblackamerica   I made Gen a copy of the Mars Volta CD. It made her smile lots :)  I love it when she smiles, in fact i love it when she's mad too!! heh I also picked her up a copy of High Fidelity on VHS at the car boot sale last weekend - there was me last Thursday chatting to her online "YOU DON'T HAVE A COPY OF HIGH FIDELITY?????? WE'LL HAVE TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT THAT!", then two days later it was on sale in front of me for a mere 70odd pence! Perfect! God i love britain!     Was gonna go catch Drowned In Sounds babies "The Koreans" tonight, opted to stay in, I'm a bit tired and got a rough throat! :(  I need to rest up for tmr night's fun...

      I might take half hour to actually design a new template for this - make it look a bit nicer!   I've just found out that the Rocky Horror Show is coming back to the West End for a two week run at the Queens theatre - part of the 30th Anniversary tour. MUST HAVE TICKETS. MY FRIENDS MUST COME, its been a dream of mine to see this show in the theatre for years and years and years. Heh, I need someone to help goth me up a bit to go and see this - I dont normally wear any make up or anything, but this is rocky horror, so I must look scary! ha ha.

      BLOODY HAYFEVER!!  The pollen count is so high round here at the moment that practically  everyone  I know is suffering from hayfever. I was sneezing my ass off yesterday morning, it wasn't pretty! Cue my lovely sister going "here have one of these Clarytin" - as far as I know they're non drowsy, I had them whilst in New York with little problem, so took one. Cut to me falling sound asleep at 2pm in the afternoon, not waking up till half 6 in the evening. Then asleep again at just gone 1 in the morning. SERIOSULY, someone should re-brand Clarytin, I mean it's obvious that they cure hayfever effect by knocking you out for hours at a time - genius! - surely this should be a sleeping pill?? fuckers.  Despite the hayfever, yesterday was really good. The sun was out and it was nice and sunny, though not too hot. I went to a large car boot sale with Andy and we ended up spending a good couple of hours there. There was one guy selling a load of vinyl. You knew the second you started browsing that this was an entire collection up for grabs - not just the crap odds and ends. Whats more every record in this collection was backed in a quality and visionary taste in music AND you could tell as you browsed the an alphabetised 7" box, that this was all loved and in mint condition. I felt a bit bad ripping random discs out to buy. In truth I wanted to make an offer for the entire collection, if I had the cash on me I seriously would've said £100 for the lot, it was that impressive a set. I was going to buy more, but I had to loan Andy a few quid so he could buy some U2 vinyl - we found one of the originally pressed copies of "11o'clock tick tock" worth at least 30quid, possibly up to a few hundred.. we got it for 50p!!  So, because I'm bored - here's what I bought:-   7"  Depeche Mode "Enjoy The Silence"  Depeche Mode "But Not Tonight" Madonna "Like A Virgin" Beautiful South "Song For Whoever" Dead Or Alive "You Spin Me Right Round" Motorhead "Ace Of Spades" Zoe "Sunshine On A Rainy Day" Divinyls "I Touch Myself"   12"  Aerosmith "Dude (Looks Like A Lady)" Transvision Vamp "Baby I Don't Care" The Jesus And Mary Chain "April Skies" Michael Jackson "Bad"   Albums  Queen "Greatest Hits II" Inxs "Kick"   It was quite annoying, he had virtually EVERY Billy Idol track in his collection except the one I wanted, the one I've been looking for over the past couple of years! bah. Still, right now I'm listening to the Jesus and Mary Chain, rah rah rah rah.   Vinyl purchasing always pleases me, that plus a knockout pill and then everyone watching the new Italian Job and Finding Nemo last night = a pretty cool day.   Today is fathers day. Another day of the year created by the commercial sector to help improve sales of at least cards over a pinpointed low area of the year. My dad expects a present, so I bought him the new Auf Weidersian Pet series and My Fair Lady on DVD, it would be nice if we could create a campaign whereby you had to do something free for fathers day - IE a gesture instead of a present...    Friday night I saw The Dopamine Theory down at the barfly, wow, yeh, they're getting better with every gig they get under their belts. They were confident, rehearsed and full of energy. Their were two or three new songs as well - which showed more scope to their influences and musical ability.. it made them a whole new band, where before they were basically a good Hell Is For Heroes act. Fantastic. Enjoyed it a lot. They're gonna be playing the Punkish gig we're putting on, which is gonna be fab.   Oh,  urlLink look whats finally coming back  - damn Feature Price servers..

      The other evening a friend of mine told me something which left me kinda dumbstruck. I didn't know what to say or what I could do, I felt a strange kind of uselessness the likes of which I've never really experienced before. In the end i just went blank and stared. I've come to care alot about my friend, so me feeling useless wasn't the best thing in the World.   I think I've come to realise that the only thing I can do is to be there for my friend if and when I'm needed.

      Monday night was a really interesting night, did something a bit weird!! THe thing was that I ordered a pint of coke in the spoon pub on Charing Cross Road, and when i sat down I discovered it was 4/5's ice in my glass. When I went back to complain I was told it was policy to fill glasses like that and that I'd have to pay 25p to get a refil. I went a bit ballistic until it was refilled for free:)  Just saw this on Gen's blog, thought I'd waste some time...     i am open-minded!      urlLink  How indie are you?  test by  urlLink ridethefader   You're pretty knowledgeable about music in general. You like indie music, sure, but that's only part of it.  You'll listen to any old shit as long as it sounds good to you. You're not snobby about music at all, you  just like what you like. How boring. Curiously, this makes you popular with the opposite sex.

      WOW  The gig was awesome. We were light on numbers, which meant money was lost, but that doesn't really matter - people did turn up, every band on the bill was awesome, smiles were a plenty, good times were had :)   A HUGE thank you to the Dopamine Theory, Redjetson and Intentions Of An Asteroid - may you all continue to rawk into your old age. Gen's getting the knack of DJing, I think some of her fear has gone... she was awesome anyhow, I never had any doubt. The next Punkish gig will be in September, and as we've all learnt a few lesson's from this first one it can only get better!!  Wednesday was also my birthday, I got some pretty cool presents :)  Thank you guys :)  A very limited Vanilla Sky record, a guitar shaped clock, some fabbo DVDs, and the most awesome drawing of Penny Lane from Gen. Happy stuff. In fact I'm going to post a copy of that drawing on here when I get a second.  Not much else to say for the moment. Big Brother has finally finished, AT LAST!!

I am calm yet extremely nervous. I'm not expecting a huge turnout, enough peeps to make it a good night and to start building a name for the night, but still... what if no bugger comes through the door?  http://punkish.fateback.com   I will report back on Thursday morning.

      Last night was relaxing.. well to start off with I had a 5 second breather yesterday afternoon, within 3 seconds I was out cold and at the start of a two hour sleep!!! Anyone for coffee?  When I awoke I eventually wormed my way round to Paul's and his hugely comfy leather sofa :) There I chilled, made jokes, sang stupidly high pitched tunes at volume and watched Hot Shots which was airing on channel 5.   Home. I chilled on my lovely futon and whacked on a nice long Friends DVD, never ever ever underestimate the power of Joey, Rach, Phoebs, Mon, Ross and "Miss Chanaanadler Bong" lol haha.  Today, well I was thinking of going to stand outside the stage door at the comedy theatre because "Sexual Perversity In Chicago" ends its run tmr (don't time fly?) and I still haven't met or gotten Matthew Perry's autograph. But because its a Friday, which is matainee day, I'd have to be there in the next hour and  a half or so and I've only just woken up!! It also looks as though it's about to tip it down outside. I think I'll just be lazy.  In fact I have to clear the sum of accumulated crap in my room this week... i shall do that  Now Playing --> Isis "Weight"

      I've thought of a better way of describing how tired i felt when I got in last night.  Usually when I'm at the end of a busy few days I might feel so tired that talking becomes hard, which is annoying because I enjoy talking to my friends as all people do. Last night I was so tired that I had trouble thinking, full stop..    *slightly more awake now*

      Went to watch Funeral For A Friend tonight, well, actually, went to watch The Blueprint seeing as Ive been told great things about them. They were pretty fab, definately want to see them again, in a place where I can hear the guitars properly! The plan was to leave the gig and go and see Serafin (who I've never seen, but have known of for years) down at the monarch at around ten, admitidly FFAF's first couple of songs seemed v good, but we also had to go to the other gig. Making us leave a perfectly good band was partially my fault, partially not... at the end of the day it was a mistake because Serafin were just plain shite. If that's them at what is currently their career high, then i can't imagine what on earth they were like previously.... grainy whiny bad vocals, and bad bad terrible songs. We kinda walked out after a few tunes had been stood through.   I think that my mood the last day and current short(ish) fuse is largely down to an overwhelming exhaustion. Gigging a minimum of three nights a week, super late nights mixed with super early mornings, plus the day job, plus doing the punkish gig, plus scribbling notes and ideas for a few other projects.. have all taken their toll, and having a couple of slower days recently is making me stop to feel the pain. I haven't felt this exhausted for a very long time - probably the last time i felt like this was around the weeks before my 8 month bed ridden ME/Lazy Bastard Syndrome spell. I should think about taking it easy for a while, cause self preservation should always be number one on anyones list.  I feel bad about dragging someone outta the FFAF gig, even though originally it wasnt all my idea... but, hey ho, gives us something to talk about, and their will be plenty of other opp's to see them again.  I've done lots of things for other people today, I'm going to do something for myself now and go to bed.

      I've just gotten in from a playback of the new Muse album, it's really good on a first airing. Generally it hasn't developed much since the last record, but there are a few songs on there which really pound you the second they start. I want to listen to it again!!!! I can't be teased and then left to form an opinion on one playthru!   After that we all went down to The Dublin Castle "FanDISco" as Gen calls it... saw Dive Dive who were the first band in ages that I thought were absolutely dire, songs which don't know what they want to be within themselves and a total lack on stage charisma. Then Cameran, who are undoubtedly good as a band, however thier set is simply a boring one song trick yet I still find them utterly compelling. It's really weird!! I went in being undecided on them and still am..  was a fun night all in all.   Have been in a weird mood for no reason, I've been a bit snipey with people all day. Even though I've had a fab night I'm unbelievably pissed off, and I can't even explain why... I just want to scream for some reason, but I won't.... because I'll wake up my family.

      In some random excitedness, today I discovered that the new Cameron Crowe project is provisionally titled "Elizabethtown" as rumoured and that the main female lead part has now been cast to Kirsten Dunst. MMMMMMmmmm all sounding good so far.   Tonight went to a gig upstairs at the garage. Mainly went to see the fab Project Abner, but was quite surprised at how good the other two support acts were. The headline band - can't quite recall their name - were bemusingly confusing for my eyes and ears. I just didn't get it, and not getting it at all is a rarity for me. Gen also got her dedication tonight, *finally*!!... Dave from Abner dedicated "Sighting Like Furnace" to her for her 21st Birthday yesterday, she seemed to be a chuffed little bunny. Nice to know that some bands don't have any issues about being "too cool" to do such a thing, something which is so little but which means so much to one person.   Both of my babies For The Love Of It and Rocktography are still down... they were back up, and I started to transfer files and domain, when another snag whacked me in the balls... anyone who's interested can  urlLink read here   also anyone with advice can mail me at ianpunkish@btopenworld.com   Tmr I've the first of a couple of days at work, but planning for Punkish #2 begins in earnest. Gotta keep my mind occupied eh?

      Right. That's it. I'm going to have a moan.  I'm fed up with all these sad types who keep on wanting it to be the hottest day ever here in the UK. Weather forecasters going on about it being oh so close the other day, conveying huge disappointment, but then excitement as "we'll be getting another chance later in the week to break that record".   They just don't get it... no one I know is particulary enthusiastic about the heat, it's harsh outside, it makes it harder to concentrate, it steals energy from you. It's made nearly everyone I know very tired from doing very little this week.   PLUS, extreme temperatures do not benefit anyone. The more rays that get through, the more people suntan - apart from the fact some people go way way way too far and end up looking like idiots, people just don't protect their skin and with the large amount of rays that will only lead to bad things in the future. The heat also makes the body work harder, we're not best fit to work in extreme temperatures and people do die as a result of heat exhaustion.  It's nothing to get excited about. If anything it should be extremely worrying. Why is the globe's weather system becoming more erratic? Why are we experiencing higher than normal temperatures in the summer and whipping storms and floods in the winter? Breaking the high temp record is defiantely something that should be looked at seriously, rather than light entertainment to give the media something to talk about and hook in viewers.   I shall stop moaning. I'm sitting in our back room, there's a slight breeze, I'm writing ideas on both this laptop and on pads of paper. This will be an important post where I say the proper development of some characters in this movie a couple of us are developing has begun. The weather isn't bothering me in particular, I'm relaxed, I'm coping.  Elsewhere....  Yesterday I picked up the penny lane drawing that Gen did for me, from the framers. It's all been done in a wonderful professional frame with edging and borders and stuff. It all looks proper and amazing.   My sister came home from a seven week stay in a hospital/home place, she's already driving all of us (esp my mum) absolutely crazy. It's not particulary nice.   Empire Records and Detroit Rock City are two of the greatest movies to ever skip over my head, I thank the person who introduced them to me.

      My my, the sun is beating down on the UK today.  Yeh, it's kinda too hot, absolutely baking, there's no air too... not much point in moaning though, it's not as if the sun's gonna hear your whines and care!! Just grin and bear it, and if it is too uncomforatble, then do little and make yerself as comfortable as possible.   My tip for the day - not that I'm doing this - get a big bowl of ice cubes and whack it in front of your fan. That way the near freezing evaporating water gets blown directly in your direction, it's basic air con man!! :P    Suffice to say I still don't know what's up with my HiFi, it's almost definately fried. I've been looking at new one's in mags and online, but I just dont have the energy to really get onto it today. That and no one is willing to drive me to the store to have a look, cause it's too hot!!!  Everything I'm touching today seems to be breaking, which is why I'm now on my laptop. I don't care if this old thing dies on me today..

"Ian Baker on here with the xlist thru to 2, then it's me thru till 4 at which point Richard Bacon will be on thru till 7.."  GRGRGRGGRGRGRGRGRGGRRGGRGRGRGRRRRRGRGGRGRG  LEARN TO PRESENT AN INTERESTING SHOW DAMMIT!!!!!  ..and they keep on playing that awful awful BRMC song.. and stupid bloody remixes..

      Day three of the heatwave :)  I've learnt the past two days.. I had the radio on for a mere half hour whilst waking up, and at a very low volume so the amount of heat chucking out the top was minimal. No tv, no dvd, no cdplayer, radio is now off, computer is the only luxury.  So far so good, it's quite nice.  In honesty outside the weather is quite nice once you get a breeze, just up here... well read below!...   I realllly want to see Pirates Of The Caribbean, its been nearly 4 weeks since me and gen gatecrashed the media penn at the Premiere.. and I can't wait with all these trailers and reviews now. It looks FAB!!

      I've just found out that Gay Dad's "Joy" is being re-released as a single at the end of the month!! That fills me with, ahem, JOY! but also makes me sad, because they were never fully appreciated when the record was first released. I wish I'd've seen them live, because I absolutely love the album.   Secretly I'm hoping that they decide to reform and cash in for all it's worth, that way I can see them live!!.. that would also mean that a certain someone cannot remind me/rub in that they saw them at Reading a few years ago and that they totally ruled, making me green with envy at not having seen them.... well they could still rub it in, but it wouldnt bother me so much ;p hehe  FOR A LITTLE JOOOOOOOY!!

      Its hot. Very hot. Especially in this room, being the roof of the house, the heat just rises up here, and it's all insulated as well!!! :s  It would be fine if there was a breeze coming in through my fairly new skylight, but there's no breeze, no vacating air, so i will just sit and sweat!  Bought Chicago on DVD, just watched it. Visually stunning movie, cannot fault it technically. The songs don't impact on me as much as they used too, or should, but working on a production of it for four months kinda does that too you. I also bought "Singles", the only Cameron Crowe movie I haven't seen, so will probably whack that on later when it's cooler.  Not going to go out tonight, prob wont the next few nights if the weather stays like this. The one band I def want to see this week though is Redjetson, they're playing on Thursday at the Metros, two problems there though, one Thursday is supposedly going to be the hottest day EVER in the UK (since records began at least) and the Metros is the most horrible venue temperature wise on a wet, cold, horrible, mingy day in London, let alone the hottest!!!!   I'm determined to make this my last "lazy" day.. I've had a few of them now, I will beat the heat and work on something productive (even at a relaxed pace) tommorrow.    Now playing --> Nowt, everything is off in a bid to combat the growing heat in this room. I can hear the birds in our bird bath though, and the cars outside, which is quite nice.

      Long weekend, too much to type about, largely amusing and chilling.... Mr Matthew has come down from Peterborough to stay at Steve's for the week, cue an £84 beer/smirnoff run!   Watched "Dazed and Confused" last night, god that film is brilliant! How have i not seen it before? Together with another airing of "Detroit Rock City" made a near perrfick sat night.   This morning was up and out at 9am, and only just gotten back in.... went to a car boot sale, not the small one planned 'cause the Roding Lane was closed!!! Which was frustrating! So we went to a massive one just off Collier Row and managed to pack a third of the stalls into 45 minutes, my eyes were on super speed scan wise, and I picked up some bargains, rarities and things I've been trying to find for months. I will detail more later, but for the record I am now listening to one of the bargains - Pink Floyd "The Wall" vinyl, near mint condition, cost me a mere pound!!   Aparantly we're about to have a huge heatwave over the next few days. By Thursday the temperature is set to surge to 37/38 degrees Celcius (matching all time UK records). Now apart from anything else, that means our underground system will be a minimum of 15 degrees higher than it was today, and today it was unbearable on the central line. What will they do? Declare the tube unsafe, close it, and give all the city workers a dday off is what they should do... i bet it won't happen....   Now Playing -->  "Another Brick In The Wall PtII" Pink Floyd

      I got another bad headache mid afternoon, fell asleep, woke up late. I'm not worrying too much, probably just a bug.  I feel kinda bad. One of my bestest friends ever is having a little gathering at a club tonight to celebrate her birthday, which was last month, and I've ended up not going. I'm not going to type any more otherwise this will turn into one of those annoying posts... let's just say i feel very mixed up today. I hope my friend has fun tonight, it's obv I'm thinking of her, she needs a good night out at the moment. ...love and hugs..   It's also a day which - in my mind only - I am celebrating an anniversary. It's exactly a year to the day since something amazing happenned. No one knows what, but I do, and that's all that matters.

      The MS Blast virus..  what a bitch, I've been lucky, I was the only person I know who hasn't been affected.   With the exception that anti virus companies must write viruses to keep you buying software (not proven, just a suspicion), what on earth goes through the minds of people who write these pieces of crap? Sick bastards.  Once you manage to get the patch and fix files, it's easy enough to remove. But getting hold of the files is tough if you have little or no internet access.

      Last night I felt so ill at times. Sharp pains across a tight upper chest were a little worrying, but only lasted a coupla seconds.   Generally I was exhausted, the immense heat had meant that sleeping in my room was more than an uncomfortable experience, it was quite unbearable. Attempts to sleep on the downstairs sofa also failed. All in all, since last Thursday, it meant I was getting only a couple of hours sleep a night. So marry that with a lack of food and dehydration and I'm not surprised I was feeling rather dizzy and weird.  Last night was cool. I got a good ten hours continuous sleep.  Its a nice day so far.

      Saw the new American Pie movie last night. Have to say, I really enjoyed it. Laughed to the point where I was crying in places.   OK, so it's gross, its poorly written and made and is blatently aimed at a particular demographic... i don't care, it was hilarious, much fun. They dropped the fluffy characters that padded things out and made the second one seem annoyingly samey, and it was all the better for it. I also have to say i totally have a crush on Alyson Hannigan.   I won't give much away, because the scenarios they get themselves into are ludicrous, far fetched and highly amusing.. but..

      I got four hours sleep. I tried to get to sleep on the downstairs sofa again 'cause it was so warm upstairs. Didn't happen, ended up watching 24 till half two, by which time I was so tired I ambled back to my room and just fell unconcious. I felt the pain of sleeping in such uncomfy humidity though, i woke up again properly at half 6 this morning.  Went to yet another car boot sale with Andy at eight. Wasn't finding too much, then struck gold just as we were leaving!! Loadsa 7" vinyl - including an original press of 'Love Will Tear Us Apart' and a 7" and 12" version of 'Walking On Sunshine'. The 12" containing a five and a half minute mix of the song!!!! 25 records bought, less than a fiver spent :)  Came home just as it started to get really hot. Spent time sitting on the floor in our front room, with fan on listening to records and playing on the laptop. I've just downloaded something I shouldn't've - but I know from a recent preview that being naughty is justified when it comes to this collection of songs... if you know what I'm on about I'll give you a tip, forget Kazaa, Morpheous, Edonkey, every P2P platform you know, all them files are fakes ;)   Now listening to --> "Falling Away With You" Muse Thinking --> This is a perfick record for a day like today Mood --> Relaxed and content Room temp --> 34 degrees Celcius

      Dumdedum...   long day. Was at work just before 9am, GCSE results came in and I had to be around to help in case of problems on the pooter. Suffice to say there were problems, and whilst I didnt need to be there to help with 90% of what was going on between the three of us, it was worth me being there.. I was keeping a logical track of EVERYTHING being done in case things went cataclysmically bad from the changes being made.  Results? Well I cant say until 6:30 tmr morning, but fuck it, pass rates are down slightly... that'll do yes?  Bearing in mind i was planning on being in for an hour max, I was feeling kinda hungry and dry in the mouth come half twelve, so came home for brekkie. I then went on a musical quest, both to put together a mix that when listened to as a session resembles sex, orgasm included, and also to find new songs by bands I currently do not know. This quest is still going on, actively researching back and forward from a designated starting point is tiring, frsutrating but fun. The mix is done, it lasts 61 minutes, and by god it does the job :)  I've called it "Hypnotically Charged", lots of great stuff, copies for all that want it.  Whilst doing that, I started prepping for READING!!! which is TOMMORROW!!! Ive lost my tent, well not quite, ive got one more chance to find it. I've also got a bunch of stuff to get ready and buy thru chatting with Gen online at the moment... that plus work means im gonna be a busy boy tmr.  The rest has ended.  ....onto Reading...

      Rah, it's all done... had a very productive 24 hours.   Last night I spent about 6 hours working on all the images. Today I spend another 6/7 hours creating all the html galleries and updating various pages... the result  urlLink www.rocktographer.co.uk  ROCKTOGRAPHY IS BACK!!! :)  albeit under a different domain name whilst other problems are being sorted!  Loadsa photos on there now :)   Now with that done I've got to start working out what the hell is going wrong with fortheloveofit, and why i cannot connect to the FTP. Does anyone know how to program a good php content delivery system??? I need one!   Listening to --> The Darkness

      Been working on websites and image editing all night.. it's kinda numbing after a while, all that resize, watermark, save as.., browse hundreds of directories, save.. blah.. hence the break here!  I'm SERIOUSLY considering not going to Reading, at least not for the whole weekend. The lineup is impressing me less and less by the day, and I'm getting really annoyed at not knowing the full exact running order for all the stages - such as the new bands tent. The bands I do like, I've seen before, and largely aren't too bothered about seeing again/missing.   Add to that, one of my best mates Andy is prob gonna bail coming on the day he has a ticket for 'cause all the acts he wanted to see got moved to other days/cancelled. Oh! and camping, I hate camping, I wont wash for days, I will smell bigtime... that and I've not a clue where my tent is, let alone whether it's in a habitable state.   I can just see me being all by myself for the entire weekend, gradually smelling worse, going to see loadsa crap and generally not enjoying it. I may just pop up there for a few hours each day, coming home to a nice bed and shower. I may sell my ticket. I may go and camp...

      I think I can officially say that I just cannot be bollocksed anymore... with what I refer too I will let you decide.  Despite annoyances past, I would also like to say, for the first time I FUCKING HATE MY JOB just based on what Im having to do during the day, running a network whilst someone else takes the credit, job title and money is also playing a part in pissing me off. I didn't take this job for the work that I'm doing on a daily basis at the moment, even though I'm good at it, I was headhunted to do something particular.. the bitch gave my job to somebody else and I cannot claw it back. I'm left totally unfulfilled emotionally and creatively, in fact I'm left with a lot more stress than ever before, and I'm left so very tired at the end of the day - and being someone that clocks off work and goes home to sleep only in order to go straight back to work the following day is someone I don't want to become, well, at least not in my current line of work. I also spend a lot of the day arguing and having to fight, it's the most negative environment imaginable. The only parts of the past few days I've enjoyed have been when slightly off task, chatting and laughing with other colleagues.   YOU'RE SO FUCKING STUPID, YOU HARDLY UNDERSTAND ANYTHING ABOUT WHAT WE DO TO KEEP THINGS GOING EVEN WHEN ITS EXPLAINED IN THE MOST BASIC OF TERMS, IM FUCKIN EXHAUSTED WITH BEING YOUR FUCKIN MONKEY, here me now..   One of my favourite mates at work said to me today, "so why are you still here? why are you not doing something proper by now?" she's the only colleague I've ever been able to tell the other things Ive been doing and been planning, so I told her about my idea for the moment, it's something I really want to work at and build to an eventual grand dream that contains professional and also personal aspirations. I've got to work up the balls that little bit more to just quit this lousy directionless rutt of a job and concentrate on doing just that, I will have no income at all and that arguement always wins me over whenever the bulk of my friends or parents use it. There's only one person I know who never forces an opinion from either side upon me, she always says she'd support whatever I decided to when when we talked about this before, maybe I should chat this through with her and only her, then do something drastic knowing that no one else had any idea what was happenning... THing is, if I do this, then this will also be the one person that I will want to work on this with 'cause she's the only person I trust, respect, adore enough for the task, and I dont know if she wants anything to do with me.. at the very least I'm going to need a shitload of support.  FUCK   I've spent a lot of time writing the past couple of nights. I'm not going to publish any of it, ask me if u wanna see stuff.  Am I always an annoyance? I initiate convos and chats with people, no one seems to ever want to get hold of me unless I can be of use, no one ever seems to want to just say hi, no one ever needs me to meet them or go out with them - I'm not required it seems, no one ever wants to come round here and see me, or sit and listen to rekkids all night, or sit and watch some movies, or sit and play guitar, or sit and joke, or do nothing,  no one even wants to hug big ol me!   Blah, my head is still very fucked as you can tell.   I've just realised whats wrong, what the pivot is.. god how stupid am i??

      Had a long day.  Been up since about half 4 this morning, been working since about half 5.. that's the earliest I've ever gotten to work. I want to go and see Colour Of Fire tonight, I'm just so whacked out from the working day that I know I shouldn't go... thing is it seems that my working life is in danger of affecting / taking over my night and social life, I don't want that, I foolishly believe that when the day job is affected by the nightlife, the gigging, then it's time to move on and find something else. But what?  Office work just isn't me and I can't afford to live a 'creative' life because I can't quite fathom out how to make money being creative, or, more to the point, what specifically I want to do - my interests and skills are so wide and varied.  There's been an idea of starting this venue.. that would totally swamp my life, and I would have to sacrifice an awful lot, and the person i would think about doing this with I feel is at a stage in life where such a commitment couldn't be given.  What about a record label?? record label / gig promotion / artist management ??? one or more, could that be possible??    I don't quite know where my head is at right now. I'm not confused, just, erm.. displaced i suppose.   It's clear I don't have much job satisfaction at the moment, even though I'm good at what I do.. it's nothing to do with cash, I couldn't give a rats ass about the dosh, it's a long story, but at times things seem like a constant battle and I'm tired of that, even though I'm always the one that's eventually proven correct.   I'm also feeling very unrequired at the moment. In the sense that I feel I'm in the way all the time, no one wants to see or talk to me for me. Maybe I'm wanting something more. Maybe I'm just in a mood. I do feel as tho I could go on a holiday to a far off land right now, and no one would notice.  It's a feeling of insecurity I rarely feel, and normally when it does run through my mind it's for a specific reason.

      I haven't done much today.   Last night I watched the first three episodes of Teachers on DVD thru till about 1am, I then lazed through over twelve hours of sleep, waking at about half past one this afternoon. It's amazing how much you can sleep for should your body need the rest.  My main chore of the day has been tidying, not just the clearing of old plates, cups, letters, etc, like normal, but a full sort out of loadsa crap. I've nearly two shelves worth of DVDs more than I have space for and a whole bunch of assorted vinyl lying all over the place. It's looking organised enough now, but in truth I could definately do with some more storage space for my records, my films and my CDs, god, don't even get me started on the lack of space for my CDs.  Channel Four has been interesting tonight. Three very different, very interesting documentaries back to back. They're now showing the delightful Scream 3. Methinks after that I shall watch some more Teachers.

      Thought I should say something, haven't written up here for over a week...  Reading was much fun. Won't go into too much detail here, but its a 5 day period I shall dub 'The Lost Weekend'. A few good bands too, I think the Darkness just stole it from HAR MAR, *EVERYONE* went to see them.. I mean a headline capacity crowd was had at 5 in the afternoon, it doesn't get much better than that. I'm a total "give me a 'D'... give me an 'aarrrrrkness'.." convert now, although I still believe that the hyped press will kill them as they are NOT the saviours of RnR, but they are an awful lot of fun. Saw one lucky little kid upon her father's shoulders, first dancing and jigging to "getcha hands off my woman motherfucker" during the darkness, and then spotted again an hour later being treated to a bit of Gay Bar during the Electric Six set, now there's a heducation I wish I had recieved when icckle.  Returned from Reading with a mighty cold / flu thing, like many did.. my throat has been caning for days, I've been flemmy and dizzy and generally minging. But I had to go straight back to work on Tuesday, and it was important work to do so I couldn't skip it. Cue four days of a big server installation and network tweaking, lifting huge 20KG servers on my shoulder and guiding them to the thread that would get them securely into the rack, all alongside acute concentration. Having to do all this whilst feeling so rough kinda killed me - with the exception of a bit of record shopping with mike on Wednesday evening, I've kept meself at home and tried to rest. The violent coughing stopped earlier today, which was nice, but I'm only just starting to feel better.   It seems as though I'm not meant to see Six By Seven live, I mean I decided against it on Thursday because I figured the rest would be better for me and lack of germ spreading appreciated... but thing is, if I had've gone against my better judgement it looks as though I would've been stuck in the tube system on a blacked out train...

      What a long yet productive day :)  Punkish is returning, I've confirmed two more dates, one in October and one for Xmas. They will both rule, they will both ROCK, they will both be the best gig in town on each given night. Within an hour of booking the dates I got confirmation of the first band, how fuckin ace!...I won't say who just yet, not because I want to hold you in suspense (well.. ok.. I do a little), but because they band's agreement is only provisional because they're waiting on studio dates to record their album with Al Clay (Pixies, A, Sterechronics) and there is a very slight chance things will clash.   Muse are playing two gigs in the next week and a half.. one i'd already started to see if i could get tickets for. I was going to get it all arranged and then surprise Gen with a 'you wanna see Muse at Maida Vale in a coupla hours?' phone call.. but I had to kinda tell her, cause she told me about the academy gig the following week.  I popped round to Paul's tonight, we watched Zoolander again, that film rules... MAAGUNUM!! When that finished we browsed music tele for a bit, oh the fear, we ended up on Magic TV because of me. They had the video for Lionel Ritchie's "Hello" on and I inisisted we watched purely for the comedic value. When that finished it was followed by "Billie Jean"... it's bought back happy memories of Reading.. but also reinforced the reason why our hifi was trashed/stolen :)  IT's the weekend, IT's time to parrtay, so C'MON, get up EVERYBODYYY!

      I just called my parents babies!! They had a stupid arguement over a piece of garlic bread i gave my sister - which my dad quite promptly stole. My mum and sister went mad, then my mum stormed off upstairs saying she wouldnt eat anything. My dad stayed downstairs but also stated that he no longer wanted to eat any pizza. OK! You just shelled out £23 on take out... its your own sopping loss.  Regarding what I posted earlier, there is something I can do to help other than what I already know I can do. The thing is I don't know if I should make such an offer for a number of reasons, but if it helps then I really want to. Dilemma of sorts. I've been chatting with Pam about it for part of the day, and she helped me make things a bit clearer in my head, along with a few interesting comments, thank you! Mike on the other hand.. well today he threw a comment at me which is probably the most insulting thing that anyone has ever said to me, what an insensitive, thoughtless, unsympathetic ligger of a cunt.  Oh and dude, I know that you are one of the only two people that read this, I don't care if that comment upset you, in honesty i meant it to, it's nothing compared to the hurt you've caused me today.   I'm still trying to come up with a good name for the new venture in life.    Listening to --> Revolution 45 Demo, In Vitro Demo, Terrapin Demo

      I'm at work, I don't feel particulary well, i started falling asleep randomly whilst watching Vanilla Sky last night. I think it's just a cold, but i feel rough, not worth moaning about.  I've written about this before, but at the moment I do feel unbelievably lame and useless when it comes to helping one of my best friends. She's going through stuff at the moment which you find hard to imagine, and  i find there's little advice to give, you just end up in a situation where you don't know what to say. At other times she gets so visibly annoyed and frustrated you dont know if continuing to talk about it is what she actually wants, but i do. Giving family advice is also strange because i find it so cliched and tacky, even tho its true, and sometimes its not what someone wants to hear.  Theres little I can do, she knows my ear is always available - which i'm quite comfortable with, I will quite happily dispense what i think if thats required no matter how useless that seems to me. She also knows that if she needs an exit myself and others are around, either to go out somewhere, or just to come round, watch movies or summin..   I care sooo much for this person, and my inability to help can at times make me feel lame and useless, even tho i know I'm doing all i can (however little) and will do anything thats asked of me. I cried a bit as I tried to sleep last night, I felt so helpless and I couldn't stop thinking about what my friend is having to go through.  Hope ur feeling better today xx

               Could you BE anymore like Chandler?   Your quirky sense of humor and general goofiness are why Chandler Bing is the friend you are most like. You think your family is nuts and spend much more time with your friends than your 'rents. You can get a little paranoid and you're a little (okay, a LOT) insecure. Despite being a tad high-maintenance, you're a great person who's bound to make anyone laugh.     Thats three tests with the same results... nuff said

      Wow, I feel numb.. ive spent all day pretty much sat at my computer. I've been browsing, working on some sites and listening to loadsa band demos.  I've decided. I'm gonna do it. It will take a little while, and I won't quit my job until I find that magic band or two to kick things off, in the meantime still putting on the local gigs, maybe seeing if the local press want to use me or my photos for their push on their music section. Which reminds me, I must plug Gen's writing to them.   Finding a band is going to be difficult, obviously I don't expect the best band in the World to fall into my lap, I'm looking for a band that I or a whole bunch of us really like. Admitidly I am also looking for potential perfection, as in, given time and backing and good direction from the right people, a group that could be undoubtedly awesome within a year or two. Longevity and a certain amount of down to earthness in the actual people is also something I'm looking for, the only point in working with a bunch of arrogrant little fuckers is if, and only if they are the shit, the real deal, the best band in the World ever.   any suggestions on good bands to ian@rocktographer.co.uk svp :)  i'm not expecting to find this easy, nor speedy, i mean Ive never done this before, like with the promoting, im doing this by my own set of rules, which I'm making up as I go along!!! hehe  I'm thinking of braving an unsigned night at the cauli this mon or wed - anyone free?  I shall drag someone down :P

      Long day Quite a nice day  Went'a'random record'n'generalcrap shopping :)  got to london at 3pm after a ghastly journey on the fuckered tube, flicked between bond street, oxford st, charing x road, l sq, shaftsbury, china town, regent st.. was nice, bought a coupla cds, and a nice bit of vinyl.  They're reworking the VMS flagship store AGAIN!!! Its annoying. Everything's in the wrong place - which u can live with - but squishing the entire main floor to fit everything into half it's normal size = very tight and crampt and horrible. You need space and comfort when record shopping. I hope this refurb don't take long, I remember when they put in the giant aerofoiled screen and cafe costa - that took forever to finish.   Met the parents, family and morris family for me dad's and cath's birthday meal. At my suggestion, we ate at garfunkels, which was very pleasant, with very nice food too. We then went to the Palladium to watch Chitty Chitty Bang Bang. What fun! I had so many reservations going in, but it really is an enjoyable show. Extremely lavish and impressive. The flying car is executed with such precision in choreography, it really is wow'ing! You have to really want to see the crane mechanism running it before u notice it.. and even then it's hard to spot. At the end it flew out over the entire audience, wowsers. LIzzy absolutely loved every single second of it, her first west end musical experience.  home now, listening to the things i bought today - so at the moment that's the freeland vinyl and damien rice cd.

Just, ming, I'm exhausted, I'm dizzy, I'm weak, lots of sleep is helping :)  I'm trying to book up some rawking bands for punkish on the 15th.. and I'm trying to get Oceansize for the xmas bash. After listening to the album this afternoon that try has become a must.   The records just finished, i should go lie down now.

      I failed to wake up on time today. I also fell asleep when I came in at about half three for a total of just under four hours. Am I ill or just lethargic...allowing myself to give into sleep whenever it urges?  Had nothing planned today, well, that's a half lie, but i won't get into that. I chatted with sir andy this morning and after lazing around watching the tele for a bit, popped out with him. We went to this amazing 2nd hand record shop in Ilford (now officially the best record store in town since Virgin Megastore shut) called Backtrax. I browsed for about an hour.. I left with two bargin bin bits of vinyl, David Grant's self titled 1983 album just ofr intrigue and comedy and Styx's "The Grand Illusion" so I can give a couple of my friends the original version of 'Come Sail Away' for a laugh. I also found an absolute GEM....   TV EYE. 1977 LIVE - IGGY POP   How maarvellous. Fantastic live Iggy Pop recordings, the tracklisting is as follows..    Side 1  TV Eye Funtime Sixteen I Got A Right Pop   Side 2  Lust For Life Nightclubbing I Wanna Be Your Dog   ....just how lush?? and, confusingly, it was only four english pounds.   Gen has gotten me addicted to minesweeper - both one player and MSN versions. the bitch ;P    ....there's no one online, anyone for a game?? *jitters*

      Ive spent way too much money this week on my pc.. Have bought lots of new bits, mainly to make it faster, smoother, cooler and something that won't require another upgrade for at least a few more years. It's nice to also be calm and awake enough to enjoy it tonight, for I wasn't yesterday when I finished putting it all together.  I have the entire house to myself, and I am here all by myself. No one has come around like they said they would, which pisses me off 'cause I turned down a free ticket to go watch one of my fave comedians Ross Noble tonight.   Am going to spend the entire weekend here at this rate.   Listening to --> Bill Withers

      Ghad... I'm fed up with silicon pieces of binary crunching transistors. I got little sleep last night and was up early this morning. I spent 10 HOURS at work for various reasons, without any break, and in front of a pc screen all the time.   I come home and after checking mails, start building my new machine with paul and steven. Paul did a large part of the dirty stuff, cheers dude!! :)  Only thing is, I forgot to buy RAM, which kinda means I can't use it at the moment..  :'(   We also put the fans on upside down, which means that they're sucking in air, instead of blowing it out.. d'oh!   Shall get the extra required bits and make the changes tmr. It practically means taking the whole lot apart though, it's hard work, but it looks impressive. Am a lil bit tired after all that the day has brought.   Have been keeping ourselves amused with jokes all night.. here's my fave two which I can remember..   An electron walks into a bar. The barman says, "Hey, why are you so negative?".   and   Two condoms walk past a gay bar. One says to the other, "Wanna go and get shit faced?".   ...and there concludes the tone of the evening.

      Went out last night:...  THE KOREANS RULE!!! verrrr enjoyable.  As were Serafin. Big props to the bald dude in front, you know how to enjoy the bands you love sir!!  I spent most of the night also a lil worried about my friend, she's going through such a hard time at the moment. A couple of weeks ago when she was telling me stuff, she seemed to have a major yearning to escape the confides of her house. My gut reaction was 'well move out then!!.. u can stay here for a short while.. or I can get u cath's spare room, or summin", I really felt I could do something as big as that to help. I never voiced this, because I have a predominant fear/know for certain in the back of my mind that such a move just won't help long term, however u now know this on the off chance you've read it! That thought ran through my mind again at several points when we were out, and when we were chatting afterwards... I s'pose what I'm saying is that the offer above stands - If you're ever that desperate... and have thought it through.. am ALWAYS here for you regardless, you know that  xx  seriousness aside.. I bought the most awesome ROCKIN 70's styleee picture vinyl last night, god bless The Daarrrrrrrrkness!! I also got a Barry White CD for 3 squid, which I'm listening to now.

      I finally did it.. i finally got round to ordering all these new pooter bits I said I would!! But, its like £400 worth :'(    seeing as ive saved that in not going out this month, its justified!!...   http://www.overclockers.co.uk/acatalog/Online_Catalogue_Other_Cases_35.html  its mine MINE MIIIINE!!!! hehehehe  Tried a very last vain attempt to get into the icckle tiny muse lad's icckle tiny sized gig tonight. Met miss gen in the hope of finding a tout or being able to pluck a moment of superb sized blaggery. Neither happenned.... so instead I learnt a lot about female makeup in Serphora, and had nice long chat over a sophisticated BK.   I bought City Of God in Blockbuster on the way back... it took them about 20 minutes to find the DVD and sleeve, I bounced around the store chatting enthusiastically (like i was mad) to the sales assistants. It was fun. I sometimes wish I still worked there. It wasn't that bad.    Listening to --> Elbow "Fugitive Motel"

      Some of the original Span demo's are so much better than what's been recorded with Gil Norton. I don't just mean the originals of the album tracks, I mean the older, emitted songs. Some amazing melodic riffing pieces of rock and beauty in there. The album cud be so much better than it is.   Yeh, I'm listening to the span back catalogue at the moment. That and an amass of Barry White and The Commodores!! :)  I'm in one of my weird moods, don't ask me to explain it, I've been a bit bouncy all night... ive spent half the evening just talking bollocks, in the middle of numerous fast show, goodness gracious me, blackadder, south park, monty python, rat race, airplane & friends quotes. It's been nice. Also watched Two Weeks Notice, which was a lot funnier and much more charming than I thought it would be... plus that alicia gal and heather burns *homer drewl*  Last night saw some live music, so nice to hear freshly strummed distortion again!!.. CCTV was the band, impressed i was, keep an eye out they do have potential. Today i cud've tried to blagg my way into a Muse TV recording, but in the end I just didnt feel like going all the way over to hammersmith. Cud've gone to see Eden Maine at the tek tonight, but didn't (no lift!) and stay beautiful.. well.. not drunk enough :)  The new girl on the checkout in Somerfield's is proving to be a bit of a distraction...   I'm finding myself thinking about something *quite* a bit, this too is turning into a major distraction...  I will never have focus at this rate.

      I have this REALLY weird feeling of anxiousness at the moment. I've unexplainably had it all day. Bizzare things have been happenning with my body all day too... I'm not going into it here. I dunno if i should be worried or not.  Vaguely, I recall my parents phoning me at about half eight this morning, I was outta it sleep wise, which is why the memory is vague. I was in the land of dreams until two'ish methinks. .....Last night was fun, but I didn't goto sleep until six this morning.   Have been working all day on the punkish site, it now has a msg board and mailing list. Bands are being booked!!! :P  I've also been working on and off on other projects, I've an IMMENSE amount of fear about them, basically because the decisions I've made are quite life changing and I'm not quite sure if everyone that knows about this quite realises what kind of gamble I am about to take. I think that this has been in the back of my mind because of insecurities I sometimes have about who's actually a close friend and who isn't...  ...let me divulge..  based on lots of things that have happenned to me over life I have become a very closed person. I don't make friends easily, because I consider the term friend to mean so much more than most people. Even when I think of you as a friend, I still need proof of trust and loyalty, etc,  I am a demanding man!  I can count my friends on one hand...just about..   ....I'm going to need support from these people, and from a couple of people I know I don't already have this based on their comments and reaction to the news I gave them. I'm fearing that I'm going to have one, or maybe two people to lean on, esp if things don't work out as planned.   I need to talk to people about this.

      Punkish is next WEdnesday - my main band just pulled, for legitimate reasons... they'll play in dec, so I'm not THAT mad.... just all their fans will now be gone... and that leaves me with one band and an empty venue...   Ive spent ALL night online looking up bands and stuff - Ive asked a band called Scanners if they'd like to play off the back of two demos. There's no website, so the only other info I have is that they have previously supported six by seven, which holds them in good sted.  There's a few other 'prog' and 'alt' bands from round these parts I'm trying to get demos off - they will prob be shite, and I dont put on shite... Ive also looked at websites for virtually EVERY band I like in vain hope. im not going to get any work done at work tmr...   I should goto sleep, Ive been sitting here for eight hours.   - oh oh oh - I went to the Kill Bill premiere didn't I??? full report later, but two things... 1. The film is quite literally KICK ASS!!!! 2. I MET QUENTIN TARANTINO!!!! THE DUDE SIGNED MY PREMIERE TICKET!!! I'M STILL OVER THE MOON ABOUT THIS FACT!!!!

      Ain't the human body a wonderful, marvellous, clever little thing?  I mean, when you collapse in a heap, hardly have the energy to move and have lost all ability to verbally communicate with the outside world, you know that your watchful brain is telling your body "FOR CHRISTS SAKE, STOP!!! GO AND GET SOME SLEEP NOW.. AND I MEAN NOW!!!"  So I did!  and now the added benefit is that Im resting AND having a long weekend :)   Punkish was fab the other night. As the lovely miss Gen kinda summed up, everyone here tonight knew and everyone else lost out.. we all had a fab time. Gen still gets pretty nervous about her DJing at the night, I love getting her through the transformation tho - that is, by the end of the night i get a slap on the wrist if i try to go ANYWHERE near the equipment!!! Apart from alarm bells ringing when CD2 spazzed out several times, she loved it :)   I've got a load of her DVDs to watch, largely all ones with Adrien Brody in tho.. oh well.. good job he does good films eh?

To any of my friends who might read this - please help me promote the gig!!!... ive onlygot two days to go, and because of the cock ups last week I've lost a lot of time in promoting. The fliers and posters are up on punkish.co.uk... please print some out, put them up... give them to friends family and colleagues... in fact do more than that FORCE them to come down if they're interested in rock music and got nowt to do :) I can whack any names on a £3.50 guestlist... help help help!!!  I know several people who will like my new band, cyclefly, theyve just come off a tour with funeral for a friend and sound a bit like them meets hoobastank..   Ive spent the night talking to gen about all kindsa stoff. Mainly the film... and her new found desire to meet mr adrien brody.. and how i can help in that!! fun fun fun. Methinks we're gonna have a brainstorm on the filum soon, and then do muchos work on it during my week off.  god i'm tired, ive been awake since half past seven yesterday.

      Bizzare day. Started off by going round to a colleagues house this morning to sort out an installation of their new plasma tele.  Since then I've largely been logged into a remote computer COMPLETELY re-writing for the love of it in asp. It's nearly all done methinks. Yeh, I know I can add tweaks at a later date, but the basics are almost ready i hope.  All in all it's been one of the worst evenings I care to recall... after a while looking at a pc does u in, but its just been a bad night. I can't cope with my family being around me and so fucking NOISY and ARGUMENTATIVE and AT EACH OTHERS THROATS over numerous subjects...ALL THE FUCKING TIME.... is their any wonder I've had writers/creative block for such a long fucking time. That plus a few other things today just make me wanna quit, if not jump...no, no.. HURL myself outta my roof window, then at least get the fuck out.   It's definately been a terrible night... I don't wanna talk about it really.   Listening to --> "Full Throttle" Prodigy

      Oh my, the week flies by!  Ive had a slight touch of flu, but with the exception of a 13 hour sleep period, I've fought on :)   High Wycombe was MUCH fun, I haven't run so fast in bloody years, and all to catch the train... There's a certain panick that sets in when u see the last train back to London pulling into the station as you arrive in a minicab, which is elevated some once u get in and realise the platform is not only on the other side, but also a mile down the road... I think once we got in the train and collapsed, both me and Gen laughed uncontrollably for a while!   It was fabulous seeing Span again, I think Joff and Jarle were both surprised to see us make a trek down to see them! A result of the night is that I have fallen in LOVE....   ....with Oceansize!! I mean, I was always in love with them, their ep's have been in my cd player for months, but now, having seen them live, I'm in LOVE with them. Mind shattering stuff.   I've also a new friend from the night, and her name is Nat.  All in all, fabulous evening, nice cosy little (and i mean LITTLE) venue too.. photographic evidence is up at http://millerspac.mine.nu    Yesterday I dug out my old SLR and played with it to make sure it still work. Whilst doing so I fell completely in love with the manual mechanics of the beast once again!! Ive loaned it to Gen for her photography class, but I got so into it, and it was such fun going over how you put it all together and how u operate it with her (military style) over a drink in East Side, that I'm going to buy meself a new old camera (if that makes sense).. and they're so cheap I'm gonna buy Gen one too.    I've had a nice day today. It's been relaxing and productive. If I can keep this up I will feel more confident on devoting a lot more time to the 'projects' that Ive planned.

      I went to watch the Matrix Revolutions last night.. a whole 19 hours before it's worldwide embargo is released and everyone is allowed to watch it! It was a 'private print preview screening', to the point that our bags were searched for cameras!!!!!  What can I say for the film? Well, it's better than reloaded, making up for that attrocity somewhat. But its still full of hammy dialogue and cliches that are cornier than corn on the cob. The first 3/4 of an hour are frustratingly slow, to the point that you dont really give a shit for the characters or what's going on, in fact you're past caring for anything on screen within ten minutes.   The ending too is awful, in every sense, on every level, it's all a bit.. "WHATEVER..." as smith says at the end "Is it over yet?". It's all just instantly forgettable. *yawn*  went to visit andy in hospital, he's just had his ear rebuilt, cue a load of really bad jokes... "when they took you down to theatre, did you start singing 'ear we go, ear we go, ear we gooooo!!!'... " I think Im funny, even if no one else does!

My family are also home. Bang goes the peace (those of u who know how loud my hifi goes, pls do not laugh at that comment).  Cue being woken by noise, cue loud shouting, cue little nieces not letting me into or out of ANY rooms.. i can't concentrate.  Other things are playing my mind too, I cannot think straight, ive a lot of choices to make in the next month or so, and whilst Ive decided on most of them, i can't quite justify what i know. I'm being vague on purpose here.  Back to work tmr, and its going to be busy, I've a few BIG events this week, and Im responsible for their smooth running...   Oh well, im gonna watch Kill Bill again now..

      Tis been an interesting night.  Ya see, my papa did summin silly with me coat, which meant I didn't have it when i went out earlier, which meant I had no cash and no wallet tonight... I was in a grump anyway, this made me mooooody. Interesting that the tube network decided to close real early tonight, leaving me stranded at oxford st tube at 23:25 with no trains in either direction!!! MADNESS I TELL THEE...  I stood outstide the dominion for over an hour in the freezing cold (with no coat remember) waiting for a lift home, not that it was a forthcoming lift, I had to argue and run a massive guilt trip to get it.... but enough of my moaning eh?  I mean, tonight I did take Genevieve to see No One Ever Really Dies, and they were ok, y'know?? Not too bad a set, although I swear I saw Justin Trousersnake onstage metres from me in the icckle Brixton Academy. I've never seen anything like it, J-to-the-fuckin-T erupted the place, they interchanged between N.E.R.D. trax and the better ones from Justified - all of which were fairly unrehearsed and blindingly good. To say he turned a mediocre gig into an unforgettable one is an understatement.. I left that building with such a huge grin on my face.. and Gen seemed HELLA jealous that she wasnt able to get on stage to dance with the other gals they pulled up "Im so tempted to crowd surf to teh front right now..." she said!!   On a slightly downbeat note, I'm EXTREMEMLY upset and disappointed, not to mention shocked and dismayed at learning the news that Fearne Cotton is all shacked up with that Peter bloke off Fame Academy... the World isn't fair, but hey, I wud've never've stood a chance should I have ever met her anyway! booooo

      Bush is in the UK, I can't be bothered to go and protest, it's a futile thing to do in this instance. Just let him come and do his thing and then bugger off as quickly as possible. The American public aren't stupid, I mean technically they never voted Bush into power anyway - at least thats the truth seen through Michael Moores very believable and fact filled eyes.  Time for a lousy plug.. visit  urlLink PUNKISH   and find out about the next gig night that you MUST come too. Just in case you cannot be arsed to visit the link check this..

      It's been a funny old weekend.  I've spent a LOT of time working on the punkish gig, and the rest of the time watching many, many films.  Yesterday evening I went with a few people to take my niece to see the utterly brilliant Finding Nemo (which I've now seen over 20 times - gawd bless DVD!).   After that I watched two films, both on the same subject, both captivating me and making me relate, both very different films with very different sentiments.  The first I put on at 2am this morning without realising just how long it was, but time just flew... "Amores Perros" - translated that is "Love's a Bitch". I cannot bang on about how good this film is, it made me want to cry, at times it made me never want to love again but ultimately left me feeling that without love and without that bond or connection, if you like, we are nothing but animals, savages, just like the dogs that feature in the story. Feelings aside, this was cinematically stunning, with some sequences that had me gripped.  The second was "Love Actually" which I watched this evening at a special screening. Now I know that the reviewers are all saying it's WAY too sugary, but I really don't give a fuck. I dare anybody to come out without a smile, and without thinking about the people that you love and that love you during this film. The ending to this is as close to a proper feelgood as the one you get at the end of "It's A Wonderful Life" as I've ever experienced in a modern movie, and I think that's the intended deal with Love Actually.  - I was wondering how they were going to get such sentiment out of a film with so many characters, apart from the cast leaving the director to do very little in terms of direction, Richard Curtis has written a string of wonderfully endearing moments that all connect that will make you laugh and cry. Kris Marshall (think the 'alright dad' son in My Family) steals the show, as I knew he would, although Andrew Lincoln comes a close second.. look out for cameos from both brits and yanks.  Best moment was nearly the CD:UK-a-like bit "Yes, Ant  or  Dec..." but i just loved the moment when Andrew Lincoln managed to silently tell Kiera Knightly's character that he loved her without uttering a word..    "My wasted heart will love you, until you look like this... "   mmmm.. i'm a softie at heart.

      I had the royal variety performance on the tele in the background tonight whilst I worked... I'm disappointed in Jamie Cullum, I mean the song he sand was an AWFUL rendition of I could've danced all night, admitidly I haven't listened to the entire album (even tho i own it) cause that is on it.. Still it was nice to see him singing live, he was almost the only one who managed NOT to mime.  ahhhh, tmr night I finally get to see Radiohead live, and if they do not do Paranoid Android live I will be a very very angry man indeed. And then after a few fab gigs during the week, next Thursday I get to see and (hopefully) photograph Muse in Brighton :P  followed the day after with (again, hopefully) a photie pass for the darkness.  Oh! and go buy tickets for the punkish gig I'm promoting!!! We've now tickets onsale at the wonderful Cavern Records in Walthamstow and online here  urlLink http://www.ticketweb.co.uk/user/?region=uk&query=detail&event=83508  EVERYONE should come, it will be rockin

      TO SAY IT'S APPARENT THAT I'M UNLIKED (for some unknown reason) IS AN UNDERSTATEMENT... I'm not the type of person that has regular emotional breakdowns and so I don't require my friends to be there for me on those kind of matters very often.. in fact even if i ever did need that kind of support I'm the type of being that would rather sort things out myself, apart from flippancy on my part I see the World as something only I can change and sort and make sense of by myself.  When I need a friend in the true sense of the word FRIEND it's normally help with something that I'm working on, but I only ever ask when it's my last resort..       ... I will quite happily admit that I've needed that kind of friendship over the past hour and a half and the fact that you wont help even when I offer you something else in return (IE so you'd be helping for something other than friendship) AND have explained the full situation to you, really helps clear the steam off of the mirror..  Let's just say that potentially you've contributed to the partial downfall of my biggest project at the moment, one that you know will leave me near pennyless if it goes wrong... no chrimBo present for you then I take it.  I'M NOT UPSET, IN FACT I'M GROSSLY DISAPPOINTED. at least I know what loyalty means.  I seriously do not what to talk to you at the moment.    ...elsewhere in the World, the new song by Texas = "What the World needs now, is love, sweet love"????

      I'm fed up with ticketweb.. they've had over a week to get my punkish ticketshop open and it still hasn't happenned. I've resorted to setting up my own shop, it was surprisingly easy - paypal is a marvellous thing! In fact it got me thinking about setting up an online store of some kind!  I've been dizzy and weird today, poss a bug, poss a knock on effect of being out in the wind and rain all yesterday. I watched the latest Will and Grace, Friends and Scrubs from the states this afternoon, they're all fabulous. I wish I had NBC on the uk Sky system, until then the internet will meet my needs.  ANYWAY.. go buy punkish tickets and bring a whole bunch of friends along too.

      Man, Im ill.. had yesterday off work, at home now too.. I started off feeling dizzy/uneasy and then throughout the day my lower throat/neck started to feel as though it was being crushed, just like darth vader did to one of his evil henchmen in the original star wars! Yeh, it's definately swelling in there and is feeling quite tight :(  apparently it's this new flu strain doing the rounds that affects the respiratory system, that would be my windpipe then, yes. hmm  I've heard reports and rumours about a large number of special guests at this JT gig on sunday night. To me its starting to sound like a blindingly good aftershow!! Yeh, according to sources one of the onstage guests is going to be Madonna!! I dunno how true that is, but, wow. If Cameron D turns up I will die... and if a certain british young lady i really fancy turns up i'm going to need a pretty darn good and casual chat up routine! You're all welcome to come watch me make a pleb of myself, if, that is, you can get hold of tickets ;D  I need to get out and buy this weeks kerrang! and nme to see if punkish is listed, but technically i'm too ill.. boooo.

Gen's Djing was also fabulous and as inspired as ever and I was so fuckin impressed with the way she eventually coped with the HUGE cd player problems, I so love that gal and she knows that she totally rocks! x  The unexpected twist of the night was when Matt from Busted turned up!! T'was interesting!   I must also say, get the R*E**P*E*A*T* Love Music Hate Racism album out this week because its fab, and the new King Adora single... my god.. its T-REX!!!

JUSTIN FUCKIN RULES  I got there a coupla hours early to queue, it was FREEZING, when Gen arrived she'd bought me a coupla croissants and some sweets which was ever so lovely of her :)   We were *RIGHT* at the front and got treated to the musical part of the arena show (bar a coupla tracks methinks) right upclose, between her cam and my phone - which we swapped - I also think we got some publishable pictures! I will show u exactly how close we were once the MMS i sent to my email arrives...  *waits....*  bearing in mind the cam is crap and can't take anything unless its right on top of you..     and now bed

      I'm feeling better since yesterday.. I know what's really upsetting me about what happenned, and those who have had it explained know... thats all I'm saying. Suffice to say I didn't want a confrontation today, so stayed at home by meself all day again. I watched some tele, went for a lil walk and edited a film for work.  Rocky Horror is on ITV at the moment. I wanna goto singa-longa rocky horror, but none of my friends are into it.... I'm often asked why I like it, I dunno, it's just a fun free liberating movie/musical.. extremely pointless, but if having fun ain't harming then who cares? I found a really good description of the cinema experience here: http://www.angelfire.com/az2/taylorjameson/rants/rockyhorror.htm

      I'm  INCREDIBLY  upset.  After having the nicest Christmas day I've ever had (as to why I will explain shortly), one sole person COMPLETELY ruined it within five seconds of NOT even saying "Hello." to me.  You see for many years my parents have run a Christmas charity which provides a free Christmas lunch and dinner to those who are lonely on the 25th December within the london borough that we live in. It's kind of like what the homeless charity shelter do, just for those who are becoming old and frail, or have no family around (age doesn't matter). On top of the meal, entertainment is provided at each centre to help while away the hours.  For numerous reasons - which I won't go into here, those who know me have heard me bang on about it - this year I've decided that I don't want to be involved in the group. I'd quite like to have a peaceful xmas at home for the first time in 23 years, not too much to ask for. After getting to bed at about half five this morning, I had a painful wake up call at eight to open presents with my family and play with my niece/get her toys working. It was lovely. at about midday I came back to my room, had a look at the few presents I had (I don't need presents, but they're always nice!), texted my friends, proceeded to watch tv, etc (yes, i did watch the tigger movie and my fair lady!). I might've been on my own whilst my family were off working (ironic given the aim of the charity), but for once I think I needed the rest and peace.   My mum and niece arrived home just before eight, we sat and had a cuppa and watched eastenders, it was nice. Once my dad and sis #1 got back we went round to the house of the family friends that run the group with us, let's call them family a. Also at this house were family b, parents of my ex-girlfriend but still very lovely people. The daughter of family a "manages" the running of the main centre during the day, she's always quite bossy on the day and I figured that I might be expecting a few snide comments about not helping this year... because she can get quite bitter about these things - again I'm not going into it.  We arrive, everyone says hi. As I walk into the main room (which is fairly empty as people are getting food from the kitchen) the daughter of family a doesn't day hello to me, instead she PROCLAIMS, and quite loudly...  "I thought we were chucking Ian out because he doesn't deserve to be here..."  That is one of the most hurtful and harshest comments ever directed straight at me, not in the least because it was incredibly succint with the precision of a bullet, but also because I consider family a to be extended family, they have always been there for me and vice versa. It's also the most un-festive thing that I can think of to say, and is also an extremely juvenile comment and attitude (when you bare in mind that she's about 38 years old).  My typical response would be to make a sarcastic quip back - but not in the same tone, although it was immediately tempting. Instead the words hit me and I felt incredibly hurt. In honesty I wanted to burst into tears - thats how much it got to me.. I'm still welling up but holding back as I type this. After a slight pause I muttered under my breath (but loud enough to be heard) "and a very merry christmas to you too".  As fate would have it I then realised I was missing a present to give, which gave me a perfect excuse to get completely out of the room, in fact out of the house.   I spent the rest of the night feeling most unwelcome, but only from that one person - it was enough to grate me, I felt extrememly closed off for the entire time I was there. My mum sensed something was wrong because I was incredibly quiet and timid, wheras normally I'm sociable, talkative and jolly. I didn't want to say anything to anyone because the mood was good and I didn't want to ruin anyone else's Christmas nor detriment from the sense of achievement at the groups successful day.  There were no friendly faces around either.. I really yearned for my friends, any of them, I've needed a smiley face or huge long hug since about 9:30 tonight. Becky (my ex) would've done me just fine because we still get along, but unfortunately she's not been well today and wasn't there.  I NEVER want to see or speak to said person ever again.  How to ruin a lovely day in ten seconds.

      I've had this horrible cold thing, i won't bang on about it, but i'm starting to feel better now.  I'm officially becoming anti-christmas, call me a humbug if you like. I've gotten *some* presents already and went out to finish on Saturday. EVERY SHOP HAS EXACTLY THE SAME IN IT - the same gadgety stuff, all rebranded per store; the same cds/dvds on shelf; the same clothes; even the same cards!! Who's taken over Christmas?? All of these things are lame, and in my opinion is setting us on the path of a homogonised festive period - the chances of you giving and recieving the same gifts and cards increase, a gift you don't necc want anyway. Therefore xmas becomes a simple excercise of giving your dosh to a huge multi-national company.   OK, i know I'm becoming more anti-corporate than usual, but it's ruining this time of year for me. When you're surrounded by people who don't share these views, you eventually feel suckered into it regardless. I get presents and stuff for most of my friends throughout the year, so I've decided to scale down for chrim-bo 2003. The things I am giving are more personal... ebay is a wonderous thing after all :D  In a completely offbeat moment - I am wondering why a four part harmony boy band (such as Blue, who happen to be on ch4 at the mo) need a set of highly tuned backing singers.

      If everyone changes their MSN names to "Happy New Year" then how the fuck am I s'posed to tell who is who? Thought of the day for you there.  Can I wish you all a HAPPY NEW YEAR, may the next twelve months of life bring you much happiness and success.  I don't see the point in making resolutions - it's just stupid, if I want to make a change in my life then it will happen as and when, there's no point in waiting till new year. I will say that I'm going to make this a tough year for myself, I will push myself to new extremes, things are happenning and I'm determined to have set the groundwork and have everything I desire both personally and professionally this time next year. *nods*  The year was seen in with style.. just myself and mr paul... andy (and our night's supplies) failed to turn up because of "BABES IN THE PUB" lol, so it was just us two. At midnight we totally trashed his living room, I've SERIOUSLY never made such a mess in such a short space of time. 7 firework bombs, chinese lanterns, party poppers x40, streamers, confetti and other things that exploded and threw crap everywhere :P  There are photos of me blowing things up, making junk angels and dancing to jools holland :) :) :)  I've also managed to down nearly and entire litre bottle of vodka in the past few hours too. Hmm.. it seems to have had little effect!  The main party is Saturday night round here :)   Watching High Fidelity last night, it suddenly dawned on me that I am becoming Rob Gordon, which is scary/interesting.

      GOD - FUCK - MEH  I'm stessed, tired, relieved, schleepy.  Today I was back at work, this translates to the first day I have to be up before noon in nearly three weeks. coupled with the fact that at the moment I've serious problems with getting to sleep this in turn translates to IT FUCKING CANED. It hurt more than I care to described.   Work over, my attention transfers SOLELY to Gen. I was going to go and meet Tom Cruise at the Last Samurai premiere, I have an ultra rare vinyl edition of the Vanilla Sky OST (theres only a thousand or so in the World) and I wanted him to sign it... knowing that I'd already agreed to meet gen and help her meant that I was bound to my word, so I couldn't do this. The media mocked me all day one by one reporting that he had GUARANTEED to sign an autograph to any and every fan that wanted one.   Gen made it down to Ilford early evening, we proceed back to my place to start work on sorting some photos, snapping some paintings, altering digital images and then printing / splicing everything onto photographic paper. It was a little demanding because her art coursework is due in tmr morning, but ultimately I think we made it as fun as it could possibly be.   Time ran away, it was midnight, and then just gone midnight... we got into Ilford, the things we had done are only the start of the work she has to get finished by 10am and she was getting more and more and more tense. At the train station NO MORE TRAINS INTO LONDON. simply, FUCK. This made her more tense, apart from anything else a minicab was gonna cost money she doesn't have.   She left as tense as I've ever seen her, rolling everything through her mind over and over and over again, which in turn is making me worried because I care just too much for her and I don't want her to fail this first part of her artcourse, that should be evident because I've sacrificed a heck of a lot - including rest and food today - to be of any useful help that i can. I can;t think about anything else at the moment  I can't sleep... again.   Listening to --> nowt Thinking about --> Gen Wanting to punch --> The person who texted me half hour ago saying "he signed over 5000 autographs tonight"

      it's been a bizzare day. My sister was having non-stop fits and convulsions since early this morning, my parents phoned the hospital and they sent out an ambulance, as i discovered when I woke up extremely late today. The fits haven't stopped and she's been in resuss all day. They've just injected some anesthetic into her to knock her out and have transferred her to the nearest intensive care unit... in the meantime me and my other sis have been babysitting my niece.. it's not been a particulary fun day for anyone.   Today's also gonna have some bad repurcussions, i'm certain that the question of my sister living here is going to be raised, it's quite evident that she's in need of round the clock attention... and then that raises issues with social workers and the welfare of my niece.. bum bum  in other news, over the past two days i've blagged free prview tickets to three films over the next couple of weeks, and also been sent a bunch of tickets to go watch never mind the buzzcocks being taped - which is ALWAYS the best and funniest night out you can ever have. I like free things, esp when its at expense of giant corporations.   I've also come up with a new idea for raising gen much needed cash... this is the testbed  urlLink http://cgi.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&category=2312&item=3378075064  so go have a lookie!  taraa for now    Now playing --> Oceansize live at the barfly (aint bootlegging great?)

      I've had a few different resignation letters on my machine for a couple of months now.   I've one day left tmr at work, because Friday I'm using up a Long Service Day. Then a week off, which i want to be as productive as hell, I want one short film based on the idea to be written and part storyboarded, I've got the whole week barr one morning when I'm setting up a studio with Stan, so much time.   Then first day back, I'm printing out one of those letters and handing it in. To hell with the consequences. I'm past caring.   I'm convinced that the changes being made to my job are being done unfairly (thinks about joining union) and due to the scale in which this will become I will technically need my job re-evaluated - but its hassle - hassle that will produce nothing except friction. Add to this the tension and jibes I will get from my so called "BOSS" because the one above her has collared me away from my duties (which include wiping, cleaning and rectifying the fractures in her ass caused by her own in-ability). Essentially to complete the chores that have been burdened upon me, I will have to work outside of my current office, with the size of the role essentially this means that I'm being given a new job without any official promotion, consultation or evaluation.   .. and to be honest, I really cannot be bothered for an arguement/wrangling. It's not as if this change is going to do me any good, they've gotten me doing this because they know I've had a shitload of good and succesful experience - doing more will not help develop or evolve me and my skills - it wont even make my CV look any better!!..   Thats it.  I'm through.

      There's no time in this World to sit and think is there? I mean - at least in my experience - no time to sit and think about what on Earth is going on around me, what this change would imply, how much deeper and more involved i'm getting without even realising it, how I already know the answers to all of these and many other questions but just didnt know i knew because I haven't had time to think about the q's in the first place, therefore bottling it all up inside unwittingly.  It's work, out/socialise/make plans with friends, sleep (if ur lucky).. then work.. etc.. a continuous cycle. No time to assess or critique ANYTHING..  I've just sat on my stairs in silence for ten minutes, close to crying, the thought going round in my mind is i need to make this time.. but right now I've got to get my head down and concentrate on this task.....   Why I actually want to now help promote a man who was incredibly rude to not just me, but also Gen the other night - being rude to me is one thing, it's always duely noted, being rude to whoever i'm with infuriates me another notch, theres just no need for it.. being rude to Gen, esp when said person also knows her and it was uncalled for, just engulfed me with a degree of fury.... cunt.. BTW - did i say promote? that can be translated to "help make money for...". At least I know tmr he cannot escape us, and he HAS to be polite to us because the landing spot of this interview isn't my turf, but grass which long, important and the most dedicated member to his cause. I'm wondering if there'll be an apology, even if it is along the lines of "i'm sorry, i was so drunk the other night - were u there?"

      My job is changing in bizzare ways. I dont know whether for good or for bad, but theres going to be friction.... why don't I just give up and quit on it all now? Im so fudging fed up with it all, why the fuck is it not just possible to ditch that and follow the dream?...  why?  for starters, a plethora of nagging family and friends all telling me that im being fuckin stupid in not pursuing a full time job for cash to survive, telling me im an idiot for wanting to get part time dosh and to live on next to nowt whilst producing the baby - a total attempt at depressing my character at a time when i should be supported and encouraged by those that i thought cared for me and what I - yes thats WHAT I - want to do with my life... not what my father tells me im good at, what I think... please just fuck off the lot of you, i just want to spazz out and do something for me... theres only one person that i know will support me, and hopefully come on the dream with us.. i know this.. hmmmmm  *in a weird mood*

      It's wrong that I'm up at 4:30 in the morning. It's wrong that I seemingly find myself falling for the wrong people constantly. It's wrong that people tell me what to do, how to live my life. It's wrong that everyone around me constantly tells me *edit,snip* - some may see it, I don't ness, I don't see how anyone is capable of loving me,  no one  ever has as far as i'm aware - it would be nice tho.  It's wrong that MTV2 plays a looped videotape after midnight. It's wrong that I'm writing this.   I'm confused, i don't know what i want, at least i dont think i do. So many people tell me so many things, and im fed up with listening. The result of this is I'm totally screwed up and I can't think for myself. I fear that by the time I work things out I will have missed out on something big, whatever form that may be in.  - EDIT: I've removed the remainder of this post, it was WAY too self involved for my own liking!

      How the fuck does outkast followed by beyonce constitute as a collaboration? (it doesnt) Who on earth thinks that Lemar is best urban act?? (its dizzee rascal from that list) Why did Lemar's acceptance speech make him sound like a cunt? (er, because he is?) Why did charlie busted use the f word? (because he think's it will be more contraversial than janets floppy boob) Why did Jamie Cullum feel the need to ruin a great record? (because that's his job) Why did Duran Duran not play girls on film? (because its to make u wish u had a ticket for their wembley gig - tho yay for hungry like he wolf)  You see. I hold all of these and life's answers. Yet I still have problems making my own fuckin mind up on some things.   Yesterday was fabulous, if you forget one issue which I'm not going into, it was a really nice full day. Went shopping super early in town to get Span's Mass Distraction CD, one for me, one for Gen. Andy came with, we then did more shops and worked our way down to the cinema to see "The Dreamers" which is an absolutely fantastic and beautiful film. Everyone should see it. Also going in the afternoon meant it only cost £4 to get in, which rocked.  After this I gave Gen a ring, and we met up so I could give her some stuff. She then dragged me along to the first art exhibition that I've ever been too and it was great.   Today i was a lil lazy, thought a lot about several projects ive got on the go. Made pages of notes and ideas. This afternoon I chatted to and interviewed the ever so nice Simon Williams of Fierce Panda fame. By the sounds of it, he used to do similar things to me to get into where he is now. Interesting.   Because of a certain issue regarding photos I found it very hard to get to sleep last night. The first thing i knew before i got home was a slight disappointment, and very wrong, it affected more than just me. The second offence is disgraceful, and truthfully i was kind of gutted and extremely upset as I lay on my bed at just after 3am. I really just needed a hug from someone close to me, but for some annoying and frustrating reason (probably me) I just don't have that.   I would like to thank people for their un-prompted concern on a non-photo related issue, it's nice to know that there are some people out there who actually think i deserve something for a change.

      Yesterday was interesting... apart from that fact i woke up at half three in the afternoon due to not sleeping for 48 hours, it was my sisters 18th birthday and hence a big meal in the evening.  That wasn't the interesting thing though.  Someone said something interesting to me online late afternoon (at least it think it was afternoon - it all seemed like morning to me!) which was kind of similar to things people say to me quite often, something which i kiiiinda laugh off, just this time it was put a little bit more succint. What with a realisation over discussion with my dad's cousins last night, it did get me thinking..   Had a fantabulous few days tho, Thursday has officially been dubbed "Best Night Ever", me and gen trekked down to southend to interview Span - even though I have nothing whatsoever to do with Drownedinsound.com the whole thing was done for them. everything was just perfect from the second I left work... Jarle was most thoughtful and got us a coupla drinks when we arrived, and then we went out in search of food with the guys. Southend seems to be a ghost-town come 7pm, so all we managed to find was a Wimpy bar. It bought back memories of my local wimpy, mainly because i didn't know the company still existed. T'was also Gen's first Wimpy experience...it's such a shame the quality of their food is still shite.   We then spent the best part of an hour in a lil seafront pub, checking out the guys whoop each others arses at pool.. t'was much fun, even if Kim did manage to get some video footage of the two of us :|  :|   The interview went pretty damn well too, we got a overly nice description of Jarle's recent stay in a foreign hospital, he's such a good story teller, but at times I didn't know whether to laugh out loud or be serious - one second he's giving the funniest description of the noises around him in his ward, the next telling us how he saw his girlfriend go over the handles of their motorbike, and all he could think about was how he was so afraid that she was going to die.   They fuckin rocked too, such a good gig.. Kim just makes the band younger and more full of energy, it totally changes the dynamic for the better :D:D  after a short trek on the beach we came back here, and somehow killed a few hours :) oh and GEN, my homer cube is still totally mashed up, i did tell you that two twists would screw it up didn't i???????  JUNE!!!... fuck it, i kinda decided i was fed up with waiting for them to come over... time to do something that so very very nearly happenned when I went to LA a few years ago. AEROSMITH BABY!!! Im gonna buy tickets when the next batch go on sale, if they announce UK dates in the meantime, then FAB, regardless am still prob gonna dash over to see them live on home turf :D :D  It'll either be - Dallas, or somewhere in the New York area. ohhh, and i'm going to take Gen with me, partly because she rocks my world, partly because if i didn't she would hate me and never ever talk to me again..

      The idea/brainwave i had for my friends bday present was almost spoiled a few moments ago. We wanna ensure he gets outta the house, so as well as a west end show (jerry springer the opea (its not an opera tho), lion king, when harry met sally, reduced shakespere, or other??) we're gonna try and club together to see if we can get a buncha people together to go upto and around london town in a plush limo. I sent links thru to his bro, not knowing that HE was logged in as his bro. fear.  tongiht my music match is playing everything in my kazaa folder on shuffle. Just at the moment I thought I was seriously starting to lose my mind tonight it started to play "The Candyman" as recorded by mr sammy davis jnr - to help aid my insanity - followed by a deeply serious prelude in e minor by chopin to make me think deeply, followed by the emotionally raw when a man loves a woman - just to test my limits. If I wasn't losing my marbles or having a breakdown previous to these three, i prob am now.  A Ha were so good. The video for take on me used to have me mesmorised as a kid, it's prob why im as strange as i am today!   Now playing --> A HA "Take On Me"

       Nice song  I love beverly knight.  Gold Written By Knight  Some people never recognise it Though it's right before their eyes And shines in all its glory They never ever see They choose something that looks just like it And it may glitter all the time But gold it will never be I guess you never held on to quality Or you woulda recognised by now Something so special so true When it's standing right in front of you  I'm gold babe Catch me in the slipstream Passing by the fools who just don't know Pure gold babe You're looking at the real thing If you knew my worth you wouldn't let go   Gold lies in rivers undiscovered Hidden from the sight of those Who don't know what to look for (They ain't never gonna find it) Sometimes the value is uncovered Other times it's cast aside By those who are just unsure  I guess you never held on to quality Or you would of recognised by now Something so special so true When she's standing right in front of you  Chorus  All the things you failed to see Separated you from me I decide who wins my time And who comes inside yeah Cause what is true and what is real Finds a way of being revealed I don't have to even try

      I've just finished writing a letter of complaint to Island records - something that I'm sending not just on my behalf, but also on behalf of a fellow photographer. We're going to sort out this problem properly, and I've jsut written an Ian classic, well I think I've written a classic!! I'm not after cash, but for the moment the letter is designed to see what they do actually come back with. It's been a cathartic few hours nonetheless, I'm feeling quite satisfied as a result.  Tonight I heard that one of my best friends used the same sentance as what I've heard several people I know say over the past couple of weeks, but it wasnt to me, I was just informed of this. It's like it's becoming word on the street, if that makes sense... BAH...   This evening stories of my drunken antics on Thursday night were relayed back to me, I think they were fairly accurate observations too, no chinese whispers going on there then!!  Im tired. I need sleep and I need a change.  Now playing --> Aerosmith "Crazy", and yes, I'm still going to buy tickets to a smiff june gig, even if i dont use them.

      I've been a bit pissed off today, kinda for the wrong reasons i think, i prob mis-understood something because I'm exceptionally tired, i'm guessing ditto on the other end, so i'm not as fussed about it now. Truth is, i woke up late and sleepy and also extremely GROUCHY because of it, things didn't get much better, i wasn't feeling tip top all day and only uttered the few minimum words which i could get away with.   It's also wrong that i took my aggrevations out on a few kids at work, sure they were not doing as they were told and sure they get away with this on a regular basis, but i TOTALLY let rip. Truth is it felt totally fantastic, so i don't care how right or wrong it was of me to do so, and Diane seemed appreciative cause this bunch constantly give her problems... LOL, not many people have seen the intimidating side of my character, hell hath no fury! especially when it comes with a barbed/sarcastic/biting/quick wit.   I fell asleep practically as soon as i got in though, which is worrying, but understandable to a certain degree as I've lacked sleep (again) this week for a various number of reasons. I woke up at 9pm, bewildered by a number of MSN messages that'd been left for me on my machine. Once i came around I also realised that I didnt text gen to say whether or not i was gonna come out tonight, which makes me a little shit - admittidly i WAS going to, but sleep kicked in and that meant i wasn't, so good job i sent nothing then eh? When i checked my emails I found I actually had a few tickets on the door waiting for me for the said outing. Fuck.   Since then I've had a couple of self-chats about how i get down on myself occasionally, things are a bit tough at the moment - i know one person knows 95% of whats up, most of my friends don't. Theres a lot of this going on in my mind at the moment because I recieved an email which *might* cause an interesting offer for me, but this had the wrong effect on me, instead of getting me potentially excited it instantly caused a negative thought process. If I published what it was about, then that would probably make more sense, I'll tell someone eventually, hopefully before i have a full breakdown!! :D   if i stop being a bit self involved for a few minutes.. I've gotten Gen a commission for a piece of work :D:D:D:D I'm quite pleased and proud of meself, and happy that i'm getting a few coffers into her pocket :)  although (and i've already told u this) i hope that the money is put aside for, say, smiff'ness..ok???   A few people seem worried about me, at work Ben and Di asked me at separate intervals if i was ok, even Adele sensed a tone of dryness via email! And tonight my parents - who i've hardly seen or spoken to in the past coupla weeks - asked if everything was cool. I suppose they're worried because I've been sleeping for hours and am a bit bitey. I think I'm in need of a bit of TLC, a really nice long hug or two would be a good start. Anyone who feels the need to have a deep and lengthy discussion about the woes of the world over the next coupla nights, please let me know! I can provide food, vodka, JD, archers, lemonade, wine, music even a movie (take ur pick) in exchange for such services.    Now Playing --> Nothing! A rarity!  Next task --> Going back to my book. GodDamn i am ill! :P

      Gah, it always happens on the weekend doesn't it??  About this time last night, there was me chatting quite happily with Gen on msn, for some reason sending over an animation i did years ago in the vain hope it would inspire animation with play doh!.. when all of a sudden i started to feel a little weak, then my throat flamed right back up again. I put it down to tiredness and carried on, about an hour later the mother of all headaches came on, it hurt so much it caused pain in other areas of my body.  Maybe, i thought, i was feeling ill cause i hadnt eaten for over 24 hours???? So i sorted out a nice big meal, ate away. The headache and throat didnt go away, instead i started to feel a little dizzy and extremely nauseous. I managed to get a coupla hours sleep after Parky finished on the tele, I woke up minus the headache, but still feeling weak and sick.   Cut to this morning (ok - so i woke up at about 2pm again), checklist after standing up:- - Nausea: CHECK - Headache: CHECK on and off - Dizzyness: soso - Sore Throat: MEGA CHECK  New ailments, apart from my nose itching and streaming, i felt disorientated, i know this kinda comes under nausea, but, I felt as though the World had become bigger, my head was floating; everything was intimidating to me. Cue back to bedness and a mixture of sleep and E4. I've kept my room warm today, warm rooms are always an important thing, but today its been WARM, goddamn, i think i have flu. At least i hope its that - my sister has had tonsilitus for the past few weeks, im certain that im not that unlucky, my throat isnt red and gunky enough for that right now anyway.   Meh and a big big BIG BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!! yes, thats boo. You'll see, I'll be fine in time for work tmr morning!  In other news... This week has seen much greatness and fun. Monday nt, somehow managed to blag tickets for Colour Of Fire/Placebo, then somehow managed to talk my way into Brixton Academy when we got there to find that our tickets hadn't been left on the door as of the time we arrived! The first band were GOD AWFUL, Colour Of Fire were awesome aside from the bad sound - the songs were all there just there was no bass and I kinda gather it needs EVERY element to work, Placebo, well, we didnt stick around!!!!... some say thats criminal, but ive seen them several times and i've always been disappointed. Wed was Fountains of Wayne, apart from the fact I realised i knew far fewer songs than i thought i remembered from back in the day, they were just fantastically good, every song was a winner. Something happenned here at home during this which kinda ruined my enjoyment a little, but thats not going to score points away from the godlyness of the wayne. Thursday was Stellastarr*, who were frankly disappointing as fuck, there's not much more I'd like to add other than their support act The Killers were quite good, worth checking again!  oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh OH!!!... and..... I have to round off by saying WE'VE TICKETS TO SEE AEROSMITH IN JUNE!!!! It's in Buffalo - north of the NY supper state (yes, thats niagra falls) - gonna get there via the awesome NYC, ohhhh and the seats are located RIGHT up at the front, check  urlLink here  we're gonna be in the first few rows of block 100 :D :D :D :D :D :D :D  of that 21,000+ seated amptitheatre. It gets better...  urlLink this is the tour stage layout...  the stage comes right out too!!! How awesome. This is so going to make up for the cock up of not getting the smiff gig i had tickets for when I went to LA a few years ago, i've regretted that since, not this time. I've just gotta sort out the small things and try and keep things as cheap as possible so that it becomes affordable for Gen, because she will be gutted if it all becomes too expensive (and hence cannot go).   ITS ALL HAPPENIN' people,  back to bed *sniff*

      Right about now I should be enjoying the live delights of Aereogramme and Isis at ULU, instead i will grumble to myself about being stuck at home.   Y'see I've had a bit of a minging throat infection over the past week and a half. It's made me a little ratty and very tired. So tired that I've spent literally 3/4 of the past week asleep. The medication I'm on has helped to clear things up, and today I went into work for my first full shift in seven days. I was actually feeling pretty good all day, after work i got home and found my britney tickets had arrived in the post, i even popped into town to sort out some mothers day presents. Then I blacked out (fell asleep), I have no idea what time but it was prob around 5, the next thing i remember is waking up, head on my desk at about half eight. The strange thing is, if i fall asleep, i know that i have, i remember going under. This was just like I'd lost a splice of my life.  I could've rushed up to the gig, but I wouldn't've been ready to leave here until near nine, reach the train station by quarter past, etc, etc, I prob would've only have seen 15/20 minutes of the band.   In honesty, I suppose I'm just worried that things might go as they did years ago. Everything's so familiar, it's almost as if I've just discovered my time machine actually works! If I was that unlucky I'm pretty certain it would destroy my life this time around. Things never go my way when things are going well which I know makes me sound as though I see myself as being a little hard done by, far from it, i have a fabulous few friends who make life totally worth living! It's just something always seems to get in the way whenever good career opportunities present themselves, aside from my own projects, a few interesting offers have been coming my way recently. So I'm determined to make sure that I don't get myself down. I shouldn't even be thinking about what's been and past, but it's always in the back of my mind.  God, I know that I'm worrying about nothing. I suppose I'm just pissed off about missing the gig, at least I should be thankful that I didn't blackout whilst out :P

      i'm hacked off, with just about everything tonight. I don't expect anyone to really pay any attention, so I will just ramble the fuck on.  1. WORK I've had enough. I'm more than irate, i get livid just thinking about the place. It's one thing having pretty much all of your responsibilties snatched away from you and given to the newbie thats been hired to do the dogsbody work without even a whiff of consent or consultation. Whatever, I don't really give a shit anymore. But it's even more frustrating that I'm being giving a SHITLOAD of - not just editing - but video and film work to do under the job title of an ict technician. I'm not being paid extra to make these films, and i'm having to live with the increasingly exhausting situation of having to do my normal duties alongside this. Oh, and lets not forget the friction that doing this work is causing amongst my immediate colleagues, one of whom just loves the snide fucking little side comments. Yes luv, insult me, i will get moments to insult you back, i live in the knowledge that i'm NOT struggling to get to grips with a BASIC it course that i've NOT been placed on. I also live in the knowledge that I don't have to spray myself with a layer of furniture polish at least four times a day in order to try and smell acceptable.   The job is dead end. I'm only sticking it out for the money it brings in, the fact that i'm pretty much un-firable and beacuase my abundance of patience always seems to kick in a few hours after i fucking rant myself dry about it. I don't want to be patient, I want to lose the rag more often whilst I'm at work. I want my notepads of observersances and aggrevations to become an international best-fuckin-seller.   But for the moment I'm STUCK. I've got short and long film ideas on the boil. I've got a tv show format mapped out ready to rock and roll. I've an increasing portfolio of photography work. Someone even told me my writing - even the shit colour of fire review i did - is getting better, shock horror. But yet I'm never the sod that GETS the lucky break in the film, photography, tv, radio, writing stakes - I'm not going to be egotistical and say that i am the best and that i have the talent, I'm not and I don't necc, but it's about fucking time someone at least gave me a shot at proving myself. No one ever seems to help me or want to give me opportunities, I'm forever having to forge them myself and there's only so far which that will take you. More often than not people have visciously used me to leapfrog into things which i should've gotten. To say I'm wary of a lot of people is an understatement.  I lie, there is a possible break for me... which leads me onto item #2...    2. A FUTURE ELSEWHERE? I've resisted telling anyone this. I think I've only told one person EVERYTHING, I've kept it pretty much to myself for just over a month now, part of the problem lies with the fact that i don't particulary know how to tell some people this nor want to put it out there because it's an "IF".  Fuck it... There's a chance that I *might* be offered a radio presenting job in yankie-doodle-land. I'm not yet sure what type, or when, but my old demo has been picked up and interest has been expressed. It sounds like a dream picking up/modifying a show thats already going out over a few stations owned by CC, but in reality I'm presuming that it's not going to be as good as it does sound, prob a 3am show that no fucker listens to where the DJ has to stick to the format handed to him by the printer and computer's automatically generated playlist. Nonetheless, it's still something i need to persue, currently I've got to sit and record a new fresh demo, a fact which has been hindered somewhat by my throat infection.   Thing is, before I even get anywhere near having an offer defiantely on the table - which could be months away - I really should think about whether I want to ditch england and move to the states (prob NYC). I started to think about what currently is my life, and in doing so it's seriously been fucking with my head. What do i actually have to stay for?  Life at home is tough at the moment, my sister's epilepsy is getting worse and worse and it's screwing this household up. Twice last week I had to drop what was happenning, most annoyingly on thursday, I was sposed to go and support the DOpamine boys. whom i haven't seen in months. As a result I'm trying to stay either out as much as possible, or confined to my room with LOUD music. Friends wise, I struggle, if not find it impossible to count the number of true  friends  i have on anything more than one hand. Even some of them at times only seem to want to know me when i can do something for them, one of them (one of the people i've known for a very long time) has become an arrogant little shite in recent weeks. True, my life probably revolves entirely around one, maybe two, people. I have no qualms in that, i'm proud of the strong realtionships i have, in terms of leaving they're probably the thing that will keep me here. GIrlfriends?? HA! don't make me fucking laugh, I haven't had a girlfriend in over FOUR long harsh years, don't ask me why, what the fuck am i doiing wrong there?  Truth is, I have to ask myself, which would i be more content with: Happy in work and career life, or happy in LIFE life? I'm pretty certain that without the coupla people i do have I would lose the plot juuuust a little bit. and that will keep me here, probably. Career is always uncertain, esp in an unknown land, I would amble around like I was in "Lost In Translation", just, minus the befriending a stunning (or any) american lady. I would be a mess. Just in the meantime I have to find ways to remain calm about the current work situation and/or find ways of dodging the nightmare of the office 9to5 job.   3. IGNORE ME A lot of people do. I'm used to it   4. I'm PLAGUED The throat infection and the few colds before hand have almost been an immense deja-vu experience for me. When I was 16 and bid-ridden for six months, being awake for no more than five hours a day i didn't think it was going to get much better. But I beat the ME (aka chronic fatigue syndrome, (aka lazy bastid syndrome)), even though doctors knew nothing about it then and still know next to nothing about it now.   I just have to keep telling myself that I'm not rid of this throat infection, I'm still exhausted but keeping on going with my life, my mind has been a little misty lately and muscle pain, fatigue and twitching has slowly been creeping in. The throat infection even showed all the signs of glandular fever - which is what the docs orignally thought i had all those years ago. Well, it stops here, I'm still beating the throat infection, as is my sister and a few other people i know. IT'S THAT. Don't ever let me say I'm going downhill again, keep my thoughts upbeat, because I'm certain that ME is bought on not just by pressure (fact) but also by some form of depression, however mild.    5. MY TIME IS PRECIOUS I'll sound like an obnoxious cunt for saying this, but i feel that my time is precious, and if you get some of my time then you're either paying me (and i'm at least semi-happy about what you're paying me for) or you are extremely deserving of it - told you that would sound obnoxious didn't i?   I do not appreciate being asked to attend meetings at work which start an hour after I'm supposed to leave and fiinish two hours after I'm supposed to leave. Oh and lets not forget the matter that I don't get time for a lunchbreak whilst on site - i just leave an hour early obviously - except in doing this meeting that won't happen. I worked CONTINUOUSLY doing the two jobs i appear to be doing from 8am until well gone 5pm, with no actual second to breath on my own terms in-between... well with the exception of the five minutes i got the reading press release at ten am, when i frantically texted the lame headliners to everyone - i know the smaller stages will be better - still, yay morrisey.   6. I'M JUST GETTING PETTY THe record shops all closed early in town tonight. Literalyl at the second I got to them. I was annoyed. It pissed me off. Not one single person - not even a vague face i know - turned up at the Bull and Gate for C:B tonight, it was as if a vortex sucked the world i knew into a jam jar on mars. Armed with no company and a need to get home to possibly help with another problem, i farked off home just after ten pm. I am fully aware that everyone prob turned up one minute before the band hit the stage.   On day's like today I just feel like ramming my head straight on through the nearest double glazed window at breakneck speed. There are some good things going on. Honest. June = New York and New York = Aerosmith. This is good, but will bankrupt me :) which is also good, because it makes me appreciate money more.   Shall i shut up now?  Goodnight

      awesome.  The new Dawn of the Dead is surprisingly good. Not in the least because I've fallen in love with the star, Sarah Polley   I dunno why, i really cannot be arsed with the passion of the christ. If it wasn't for the fact they're depicting christ, then it would be a lame arsed movie - 25th hour has a similar idea and probably pulls it off a helluva lot better. I don't give a toss for the religion aspect, which probably makes it a totally benine movie. I doubt my apathy will halt it's box office success.... *yawn*  had an interesting weekend. not that there's much to report. just things have been happenning.  OHHHH, another movie you should all catch - eternal sunshine of the spotless mind - it's rather gud.   I've just updated www.rocktographer.co.uk for anyone who's ineterested. There's another update to come...

      It makes you feel old when you get post inviting you to the christening of an old school friend's newborn. It's all that, and (for those who believe in it) weddings from now on. It's really strange that I have no actual aims or visions of settling down in the traditional way, it's just not me, but at the same time I realise that all those who I went to school with are/have become 'grown ups'.  I suppose it's only, fuck, 2/3 years until the 10 year reunion party comes around. Scary.   THe previous issue still hasnt resolved as such. I need someone to talk to about it, one of a few specific people. I really want to post more on LJ in the absence of people, but i seriously don't like that place, because of this my entry yesterday ended up being vague. What to do....   My voice is fucking up, which is not only preventing the recording of this demo but also stopping me from calling someone to talk to.

      There's something happenning right now, it started yesterday evening, which is really really bugging me. I can't really write about it up here because I'm pretty certain that the person this refers to knows of this page and read's it, so I've written about it on my LJ, which again leads to vagueness because i dont like or trust how LJ works particulary.   Those who know my LJ username can go rock on the little I wrote, the person who this all refers to has no idea of it (as far as I'm aware). There was no one online last night to talk to, ditto today, hence the need to write something somewhere. I could talk to someone on the phone, but apart from not being a phone person, I feel like utter shite today.   Yesterday I took me niece out to London. We did Hamleys, McD's, HMV, Sweet Factory and SCooby Doo Two. It was knackering! I'm feeling the effects of that and staying awake till about 4am today.  I'm off for a much required hairchop.

      Its the Easter Hols, which is nice. I've spent the last day or two largely resting here - beating a damn headcold, at least its a bearable one. I've also been doing a shitload of writing, on various things. Check www.fortheloveofit.co.uk and see the last coupla reviews I've scribed, surprising comments were made to me about the CoF one, and I'm personally rather happy with the Eternal Sunshine one.  It's strange how suddenly I'm throwing myself into and really enjoying writing. It's not that I've ever hated it, just I've never felt that a) I was any good and b) sometimes it was a burden, as in i HAD to write this or that.. I dunno, maybe i'm just imagining things.  One other thing that might just be my paranoia is a sense that i'm being avoided, I'm saying nothign more than that.  Theres a large number of Kill Bill vol 2 screenings happenning around town over the next two weeks. I'm desperately trying to get into one, I HAVE to see it and i WANT to write a review. One of the showings is entry via a competition, and I'm frantically clicking away to enter. I think I've entered near a thousand times now :|  Seriously! I'm crazy, I know. I'm just feeling lucky, like I'm destined to get in, just as with the premiere of the last one.   Right now I'm taking a break with a bud and a smile before I find the RSI sets in.

      The Good News: I have a new camera to replace my old faithful, which currently has a failing smart media drive.  The Bad News:  Said camera seems to be the only thing that doesn't enjoy fucking me over.    I'm fed up with quite a lot of things. It's nice to see some people's true colours, but at the same time it does just make me want to curl back up and think about my cynical view of the world, that is being wary of everyone - something which has relaxed slightly over recent times. I don't see why I ever bother doing anything, i mean, who really see's what I'm good at?  This is tirdness talking, but with an element of truth syrum.

      QT didn't fly into London on the weekend for some reason (illness cited), so the Q and A i went to was cancelled.   Still on the brightside, I've met him before and it might be rescheduled. Even further on the brightside, I had a relaxing half hour lying on a bench in L sq reading a book, the weather was just gorgeous. Obviously I then went shopping - who wouldn't?  I've spent the evening doing writing of various varieties. Hit writers block too. Has been mixed, so I've been chilling and seeking inspiration from Pam and Joe's latest CD release :P   Right now I'm trying to find some posts i made about a year ago. Am searching for some poems I wrote and am certain I posted at some point.

      I feel the urge to bemoan, I apologise, the past two hours have been unbearable, I've found myself having the worst arguement with someone simply because a) they like to dramatise and b) because they never give in until they've won ANY dispute, even a small one. This small dispute got bigger and bigger fo said reasons, until it became a HUGE slagfest. In my current state this is bad, I am extremely tired, and tiredness makes me ratty. Also I'm at a stage where I just can't be bothered with said person, there's a few hours a day i have to put up with, and then thats it, I just live with it because thats all i can do and occurances such as this really frickin grate on me.  I can go home soon, mmmmm the lure of a bed and more sleep.   In good happennings, Britney Spears was fantastic on Monday night. She didnt sing a sole live note and also mimed to a large portion of her banter, which annoyed/shocked me. However the seats were along the side of the stage - LITERALLY - so even though we were up high the view was pretty good. Also being placed where we were, we found that we could also see EVERYTHING going on behind the scenary and the magic. Whilst this would bother most people, I personally found it facsinating! In no way was this to do with the fact that we were right next to and had perfect view of her onstage quick change area, oh no no.

          In exactly four weeks time I'll be on a plane flying somewhere over the big atlantic blue, on the first part of another r'n'r advernture with the gal who rawks, this time to see Aerosmith LIVE feet in front of us and also to live and shop in New York City. Mmmmm.  I'm so excited.  And i've told four people this today, not on purpose though, oddly each person has asked how long it is until my holiday. Spooky timing.  I'm also thinking of buying an ipod for the journeys and hotel room entertainment - please suggest any other bits of gadgetery that might do the job more cheaply! I'm tempted towards the apple baby though.  This HORRIBLE franz ferdinand song is on XFM again. I think this is the worst record of the naughties so far. YES. I think I'd rather listen to the fast food rockers for an entire day instead of the dragging 3 minutes of matainee.

        Well fudge me with a lamp-post. Blogger's changed!!  T'was about time, too, stacks of competition on places like Live Journal, nice  to see the Google millions being used effectively.       &nbsp;    So from what I can tell i can now post by email  (doing this now), there are new templates and articles are archived efficiently  now. Oh and there are now comments, about bloody time too. I also hear on the  bbc news site that the option to upload photos directly is coming soon as well.  Now, not that i want the world.. allow blog updates via SMS and photo updates  via MMS and i will be SERIOUSLY impressed. Only then will the world be totally  under the wing of real life experiences and not just what the media portray - i  mean - saddam pax was a great example of beating a regime but also a fabulous  way to tell the real story that you didn't always see on the news. Imagine if  you could do that anywhere, either where something happenned that was newsworthy  - with a pic from your phone - or a review of a live gig up on the site, or even  just a memory of the thought in your head, be it happy or morose... all done and  online before you even got home to your pc. Thats when this stuff becomes mind  blowingly woah.      &nbsp;    Hmm. I will post something more interesting about  what i've been upto later. For now I'm just musing about what's going down here  on the big B.       &nbsp;    over and out     Ian      &nbsp;     &nbsp;     Now playing --&gt; Keane  "Bedshaped"       &nbsp;   &nbsp;

      I can't quite believe it.  The gal behind "Secretary" is putting together a movie on the life of Ian Curtis. It's strange how I'm reacting to the news, after recently reading "Touching From A Distance" which is a book written by his widow Deborah, part of me knows that its a tale which will make a fascinating film. Part of me also knows that it's got to be put together seriosuly well so that it doesn't depict him incorrectly - fans will revolt if they get it wrong. Fuck the fans - I will be annoyed if they fuck it up.  The book is absolutely beautiful, one of the most compelling things I've read in a long time, it convey's the rise and fall of Joy Division, obviously, but also looks at the man behind the public poet, his mental state, his will to want to die young and as an icon, his seductiveness and then manipulative and controlling nature. It was something that has helped me understand a character me and gen are slowly putting together for a film, as i read the story I knew it would be a fantastic film if you're brave enough to tackle it.   I wish them (whoever's doing this) luck!   In other news, its sunny! :D  :D  which is a bitch when you're stuck in an office, i mean, CUPBOARD at work, but enjoyable once you get home. I've spent a couple more hours looking up other venues in NYC and brooklyn to check up listings. Nothing much new, though we're going to go and catch Bobby Conn and Trans AM the night after the mighty /^^(A)^^\  Just three weeks to go, I still can't quite believe I'm going to finally see them! It makes up for the LA disaster/disappointment. In Buffalo we're hooking up with a kind soul who's looking after us/driving us to and from the gig. We're gonna go partay pre show at the venue - wow - party time in america, with some americans!!! I know it's no big deal, but a first for me!! Afterwards there's a fan meetup/party "by the pool" I dunno if we're gonna get there as our host may wanna drive home, personally i hope not, i've always wanted to check out a poolside happenning. The whole buffalo side of the trip is sounding soooooooooooooooo Dazed and Confused, and that rings true - first prority of the trip (summer) is to get our aerosmith tickets!  My final comment of the day - you can download a perfect copy of the first five minutes of shrek 2 at www.shrek2.com - it's totally legit! What a fantastic idea that is! It also rocks too, I can't wait to check it out.  Now Playing --> SNoop Doggy Doogy "Doggystyle" album

      THE RASMUS and MAROON 5  PLEASE GET OFF MY TV SCREEN and PLEASE STOP HURTING MY EARS  Just bought myself another new camera, this time a simple little digital for sneaking into aerosmith and such. Little polaroid, 3x zoom, 3.2 Megapixels and it takes my old smart media cards, of which i have many. Only problem is it bleeps like a maniac on a heart monitor, so i might just have to open it up and break the speaker on purpose.

      I'm - i think the word is shellshocked - for the first time in a good coupla years. Shellshocked in a fantastic way mind you. I've just gotten back from my last minute excursion to see Six By Seven at the ICA tonight. Every single opportunity I've had to see them over the past few years has always ended in disaster, it was almost as if I was never meant to see them. Now I just cannot believe what I've been missing. I was fine until about a minute after we left the venue, at which point something just struck me and I was pretty much unable to string the most basic of sentances together.. apologies for my sudden muteness dude. As I walked up Charing X Rd, a lump - still present to this second - formed in the back on my throat. I don't think I blinked for several minutes. I'm currently somewhere in between wanting to cry and not having any words to vocalise. All this from what I'm lead to believe was a "weaker" performance. Anyone who knows me will be aware that this kind of effect is rather rare, even when I goto the best gigs, the most I will normally suffer is wibblyness or the after effects of a hypnotic state. Just. Och.  I also got some shots with the new cheep camera I purchased to sneak into a big gig next week. Now, I must say, for £60odd, the quality in which these have come out has impressed me, esp as the light was low! Again, apologies, I'm not at one with the LJ cut thingy so you'll have to put up with three photos...          In other, less emotional news, I want to make a pit stop in Louisiana next Friday. Paramount pictures have announced an open casting call for background extras to work on Cameron Crowe's new movie. I've never had aspirations to be on celluoid before, but this is the Big C we're talking about here. Any other day I'd laugh the thought of flying 4000 miles to do this, but as I'm in the country and only a coupla hundred miles... it's sorely tempting to make a slightly expensive diversion. I doubt this will happen, but y'know, it might, if I get my insane way :P    Look at me babbling. I need a drink and a youghrt. Nights.

      I've been better. It's been a horrible day for me, and I don't even think that the prospect of America in two days time will cheer me up, for certain specific reasons.  A number of things have gone wrong. The first of which was completely screwing up my first outside photography job. I ballsed up in spectacular fashion. It's too good to even tell.  Other things have just knocked me down further, and there's been few encouraging words in-between. One of my friends decided to start having a go at/knock some sense into me about one thing that they're fed up with seeing me go through. Whilst it's good of them to be a friend and lookout for me - which few do actually do - it really wasn't the time or place. In fact it's put me down lower than I think I ever have been, because now they've installed the realisation of making a big decision into my head. If I don't act on it before I go away then it's going to chomp at me constantly and then I will be a miserable asshole to be around all holiday, which i wouldn't want my partner in crime to have to suffer. Similarly if I act before I go away then I risk being a miserable cunt on holiday. It's just another win win situation. Boy, I love Sundays.   Something else I've just realised. It's almost a year to the day since I wrote some poetry up on this blogger thing. Why does someone want me to realise it's anniversary? I just re-read said poem, and it made me cry. Wow, I guess some people were right about it after all. Blah.  It's also bizzare that the strongest sense of sympathy and encouragement I've recieved tonight is from a 15 year old girl that I hardly know.  --> Now Playing "The King's Highway" Bubba Ho-Tep OST, Brian Tyler

      I'm a man who continues to beat himself up. I'm stupid.  Yes I know I'm not the only person in the World to be going through what I currently am. But when you are in the middle of it all, it seems as though you are the only living soul to have ever felt these torturous pains.  What would help me more than anything would be for a certain someone to carry on as normal, with a little sensitivity. It's the only way that I will get past this with our friendship intact. Avoiding and  Blocking  do nothing but harm, and know that in doing so, you are gradually destroying me. Please. Just. Be the friend I thought you were???  What the hell, you don't care enough about me to read my main blog anyway. This is a pointless post.

          Oh dear. I feel I've crossed a line in my bad jokes. I apologise. But it cheered me up no end yesterday.   I'm bored. There's no one online and I'm coughing like a maniac, so in the absense of company I'm going to go and watch Runaway Jury.  I will briefly mention the holiday. It rocked. It was simply the best holiday I've ever had. Tyler is a God, as is Perry. BUffalo people are kind and lovely and fun. Greenwich Village and general downtown NYC is the best place in the World aside from London. I want to go back now, this week, Oceansize play the mercury lounge Tuesday, The Killers play the same small venue Wed, and SMIFF play long island Thursday. Damn that interference called work.
