      There is no way I could have gotten better out of life what this program has given me.    Plain and simple.   15 years ago, I was a walking disaster.  I watch Anna Nicole Smith and I think, man, I was messed up like that, just without the money. I had the manipulation down, the beauty, I had the alcohol, the chaos, the insanity, the egotism, I had it all and thought I was it all. But I wasn't. I was a train wreck on four inch heels.   Never did I expect that I would find a partner who would love me, care for me, respect me enough not to hit me or use mindf***'s to control me. But this program gave him to me. I wasn't even a year sober, and after being stupid and not listening to my team of sponsors, I let a guy into my life and my house who almost destroyed me and everything I had gained in those first few months of sobriety, I wasn't about to walk into another relationship until I was a year sober.   Frustrated with this guy making moves on me, I finally said, enough! And I spilled it. My anonymity on a conservative Christian college I held dear enough to me to cover my big book in contact paper so you'd have to open it up to see what it was.  I figured, this guy, if he was really worth his salt, if I told him he'd either still pursue me or he'd leave me the heck alone.  Well.... I told him. He said, 'That's cool, my grandpa was an old timer in AA and knew the founders."   His grandmother became my sponsor and helped me through a difficult time in my life. She twelve stepped me into the other side of the program after watching the insanity of those who raised me at a bridal shower (my grandmother had pink hair from where my mother dumped Hawaiian Punch in her helmet hair the day before) and of course, my mother was no where to be found.  She said to me, "Lisa Mae, you and I have to talk when this is over. Because if you dont learn how to detach from these people, you're never going to stay sober, because they wont let you."  How right she was.  AA got me sober, and Alanon taught me how to live with my alcoholics.   In fifteen years, I got married, found success in my career, got a degree, got published, realized that no matter how much I wanted to walk away from my writing that it was virtually impossible and kept at it.  I dealt with the abuse in my life and learned how not to carry on that family tradition.  God blessed me over and again abundantly.  In Dec. of 1996, I wanted a baby for Christmas and was pregnant with number one, the following Christmas we had three babies!    He came alone in early January of 97.  WIth him, I had a stroke. I learned that while I wanted to have a relationship with my alcoholic mother again, she once again played me with a creul mindf*** and tried to steal my son from me.  I went home, sad, dejected, confused, baby in my arms and unsure of how to deal. I still had to push him in the stroller in the apartment, I didnt have enough strength to carry him.  Simple tasks I had done at work seemed insurmountable and work hardly understood.  Then, in May of 1997, I found out we were pregnant with twins.    Finally, after five years of trying, we had success with pregnancy, but neither of us expected three babies in a year!  I had no choice but to heal myself. I had to do my own occupational therapy, I had to strengthen myself and deal with my defects from the stroke and will myself to get better all over again.  My twins were born and I had staph and was quarantined from them for almost three weeks.    That was hard. But my higher power never left me. The one thing I got through this program that I never had before was perseverence.  After my youngest was born two years later, we had the tubes tied.  WIth her came another stroke worse than the first, but I had my child healthy, I had three children who were healthy, and a good husband. Nothing else mattered. I lost my job on maternity leave. That didnt matter.  One of my twins started to act strangely. He gave me a hard time, was angry and upset, wouldnt communicate. After a move home for a job, we entered him in preschool and the teacher told us to have him tested.   Autism. Asperger's Syndrome. Two words I never knew became a big part of my life. I remember grieving this diagnosis, but not once was drinking an option. I put myself to work. HARD WORK for a child who deserved the best that life had to offer him.  I persevered.  I didnt drink, I learned endurance and what it meant to complete something for the first time in my life.  He was mainstreamed with his twin in kindergarten last year, and will be likewise in first grade this year.  When things got bad, when I felt at my worst, I picked up a phone, I called a friend, I went to a meeting, whether online or in person, I got there, because I needed it not just for me but for my children. They needed me to be the best I could be for them. So very hard when the rest of the world doesn't believe you can do it, that you'll ever amount to anything. But how gratifying it is to prove them wrong!   WIthout this program, without my higher power, without the people who are lifelines and sponsors who told me I could make it when I believed I couldn't, I would never have given myself these gifts. Back then, as far as I was concerned, I didnt deserve them.  Sometimes, in a moment of gratitude, I still believe that. But I'm glad that with this program, my higher power and those who love me, I know otherwise today.    My favorite thing to tell a newcomer is "You deserve the good life that Serenity and Sobriety have to offer you." And I mean every word of it.

      Oh boy, where to start? My biggest problem is that when things go wrong, I don't ask for help. I don't make phone calls, I don't write in my journal and in hence give it over to my HP. Nope, I held my cards close to my chest when I was drunk and I do it now that I'm sober. Wonder if htat will just get me back there someday?  When the secrets and shame can't be covered up any more? When they spill like the pop bottles in the closet, exploding their lids off again, landing me back into the pit of despair and angst.    I have to give this over...every bit.  We had an interesting lesson in powerlessness and refusing to be powerless in twenty four hours, and of course, it all had to do with Joshua.  On Tuesday, I was about to make dinner when I got a call from Josh's TSS. I could hear Josh screaming and crying in the background and immediately, my mother's heart began to race. My baby was hurt. I know that sound. She told me that on their way home from the park, they were driving past a golf course and a golf ball went through the window where Josh had been sitting in the back seat and the ball hit him in the head. Glass shattered about him, he was a wreck.  I told her I would be there in five minutes. I was with three kids in their carseats.  Josh, when he saw me, wanted me to pick him up immediately, and I did and wouldnt let him go either.  His TSS handed me the pair of sunglasses he was wearing and his hat was still on his head. One thing, with our fair skin, I always insist on sunblock, hats and sunglasses.  Josh wouldnt let us take off his hat, but eventually I figured where he had gotten hit and we were on our way to the hospital and he began having a meltdown that lasted about two hours.   We cornered him in triage, and the triage nurse told me they were an hour backed up, that it was up to me to take him elsewhere. I didnt know what to do. I had left marc a note saying I was here, I didnt know if he knew how to get to farrell hospital, so i gave up and waited. THey put us in the grieving waiting room off the ER. You know, the soundproof one with the nice couches and television set in it.  As soon as the door was shut, he calmed down and quit screaming. He sat down as soon as I put on cyberchase for him.    WHen a nurse would enter, he'd have a conniption until the door htat shut the hospital out was closed.  What had him upset?  Two things: He did not want to go to the hospital and he was mad that hte golfer who hit him wiht the ball never came to say he was sorry.  That upset JOshua the most.   THen they decided to do an X-ray. I'm like, "God, grant me the serenity RIGHT NOW!!!" as Josh began his diatribe of "no x-ray, no x-ray...and then he saw the CT Machine. That did it... we had a 45 minute fight on our hands that finally ended in Josh running out of the room, down the hall shrieking and me, on 3.5 inch sandals running after him and getting him back into the hold position.  Finally, they gave up and I was exhausted. I got him home in time for me to turn around and go to a meeting.  I needed it last night, and it was on courage.    I thought about all the courage it took for me to realize that I'm a good writer and that I ought to submit my works for publishing regardless of what my parents or anyone else in my life had to say about it.  The courage its taken to carry through on many promises to Marc over the last few weeks, when I could have bailed on him and taken the 'easier softer way' out of this situation.    I kept waiting to hear when there was going to be an IEP meeting for Josh... finally tired of leaving messages on IU voicemail, I called the disabilities specialist at the school who told me they had a meeting WITHOUT US on the last day of school.  How nice. They decided Josh couldnt handle it, we all knew otherwise.  So he set up an Emergency IEP meeting and I got our BSC and Marc there.  We fought for 2.5 hours to get the IEP the way we wanted it with Josh COMPLETELY mainstreamed into the first grade.  Now I have to locate his principal and finish fixing it with Josh and Joy in Mrs. Hammond's class so I can be her room mother again. :)  Today, the dreaded board stirred crap with Marc again, so I'll spend most of the night settling him down. We'll hope, anyway.  Today I got to let go and let God.

      Tonight at Fatima, a woman led, and she talked about how when she was a child she kept running away. Her family would move farther and farther out into the country in hopes of keeping her at home, but it didn't stop her.    I had to smile when she said that and thought of all the times in my life when I ran away from the reality, the issues, the pain, and found an easier, softer way.  I went to 10 schools before I graduated high school, three colleges before I had a bachelor's degree.  For me, geographical cures never worked whether I was drinking or not...well, one time I thought they really did, only to realize I had fooled myself with my own deception.   I could relate to her battles with mental illness, and then knew there was a reason I was to bring C. with me. She got the lead's phone number afterwards (they share the same dx), and I was real glad to see her whole outlook improve as the meeting went on.     Today has been a day of mixed blessings.  My mother called to tell me that a cousin's son has been dx'ed with Asperger's Syndrome, just like my Josh.  He's a year older than Matt, and I know it's hard when you first find out.  I need to reach out to them somehow, but I'm not certain how to go about doing that without coming out and saying,  'the whole family is talking about how you've kept this a secret because you're ashamed of it.'  Know what? I totally understand.  Josh's bad behavior was blamed on my supposedly  bad  parenting skills.  My other three were fine, but he was  AWFUL  as far as the old ladies in my life were concerned. And God knows that I did my best with what I had to do with before and after the dx.   I could have run away from Josh's dx.  I could have stayed in a placated attitude of denial, but even I knew where that would lead me.  If there's one thing the program has taught me, its to be brutally honest with myself, first and foremost. As a kid who had a lot of learning and physical issues growing up, I had to immobilize myself, I had to work through my grief, and get to work on his behalf.  The insurance company began to reject bills for his autism, claiming mental parity.  So there was no OT or Speech therapy for him. We became his OT and speech therapist, but I was the primary one and gave Marc direction on how to take over when I wasn't there to be the center of the universe. Some things, no matter how long I'm sober I dont think will ever change...me being a controlling b*tch is probably one of them.   When Josh was diagnosed, I believe that was the first time in my life that I didn't run away from something that hit me like a ton of bricks.  Yes, indeed, it was life changing, yes, it was hard, yes, I began to see my own fallibility and fear the worst in my genes as I watched Hope, the baby reach the age where the autism bomb would make her most vulnerable.   Running away never helped me. It enabled me, it kept me drunk, it helped me lie to myself that everything was going to be better and work out for the best, but if there was one thing running away did for me, it gave me empty hope to a self-fulfilling prophecy.  I would not be popular where I was going, I would end up being the same odd kid that the others messed with. The one bullied and picked on... that was never going to change, and I fooled myself into believing it every time until the first day of school when just showing up fulfilled that prophecy for me.   This whole thing with R. has me worried about that. That running away from here, where things are good for Josh, where we live in a lovely house and not a rat trap in a bad neighborhood, that it will begin to instill in my children that false hope, that will eventually eat them alive as they reach for alcohol to cover it up.  That's not what I want for my children. Likewise, I want them to know that no matter what happens, I want them to realize as it says in the Promises of the AA program, "As God's people, we stand on our feet, we do not crawl before anyone" (Big Book, 83). And if that means that we have to shake the dust off of ourselves and move on, then so be it, but we do not allow it to destroy us and our family in the process.    I don't like giving her power.  This will probably be the last time I mention her.  Every day, I pray for her. I ask God to forgive her for what she's done to us, to herself and to her children.  I ask God to protect them from the guns that lay about the house, and what's more I ask God to protect them from their mother's insanity until she realizes that there is help for her.   A good thing happened today...Marc sent me to get pull-ups and coffee (two things we were NOT going to make it without UNTIL Friday) at WalMart and I had with me two gift cards. One, I had found in my wallet, sure there was a couple dollars on it, probably enough to cover the tax, and the other was the $10 gift card that the preschool had sent me as thanks for all I did for them this year.   I grumbled to Marc on my way out that I never get to buy anything for myself. It's true. If someone gives me money, its instantly spent on children, bills, groceries, but not on myself.  So I handed the cashier the gift card I found in the back of my wallet and it had 10 bucks on it! I just had to come up with 4 cents!  Well, of course, I had no change in my purse, I used it all at the store earlier in the week for milk.  The man behind me had three pennies and the cashier had one penny, so I was all set. I put my gift card back into my purse, glad that I had saved it yet again.    I went back into the store, still having at least a half hour before I had to pick up C. for the meeting. Of course, I had to check out the clothes and found a hot pair of denim F*** Me sandals. I know, I know, I will never get over wearing heels. With my arches, how could I? Every pair of low ones I put on, I knew I'd end up falling in. Put me in a pair of high sandals at least 4 inches high, and I'm in heaven and not falling anywhere any time soon.  They were $12.86, so I didnt have enough and put them back on the rack, certain I'd have them on Friday when payday came around on Friday.   Although I didnt spend the gift card, I got to spend some time in a store looking at things for ME, not anyone else in the family.  Not even the cats (Sorry Thomas and Cinnamon). It was time without children, time by myself, time to breathe and put it altogether before I went to get C. and take her to the meeting.    So here's my gratitude list for tonight:   1. For the realization that Joshua's dx has not been a burden but a gift.  I couldn't see that then, but I do see it now.  2. For AA and the gift of honesty it gave to me.  3. For being asked to lead on July 26th by Rich (at Fatima).  4. For $10 I didnt know I had and the coffee and pullups to get through the week.  5. Being able to feed a family of six on $41.57 for a week.  6. For realizing that I'm wasting my afternoons by not putting in my own hard copy revisions while Joshua is gone with his TSS.  7. For "Buttermilk Banana Cake" and "Butter cookies" to please children.  8. For my Mom who helped me hold it altogether when Josh was diagnosed and going to all IEP meetings with me as my advocate.  9. For losing 8 lbs thus far.  10. For letting God take care of it all.

      Wow, what a day we had today. We got up early and made Daddy breakfast of waffles, ham and eggs and toast.  The children also made him cards and they got to give them to him then.  We had no money this year for anything, so we packed ourselves a picnic lunch and went to Buhl Park for the afternoon.  The kids packed their lunches in their insulated lunchboxes and we had a blast going from playground area to playground area all day long.  While the kids ate lunch, I read them the first half of the first chapter of Harry Potter's second book and before we left, while having lemonade at a picnic table, I read them the other half.  Daddy and I have been fighting over the book since we got home. I hope he'll get caught up to me before kids bedtime so afterwards we can sit on the couch and SHARE the book...not something we've done since seminary.  I miss those days, sitting close on the couch, a book between us and a cat on each lap.  Silence, just the book and the purr of a cat and snuggled with my sweetie.  Seems like eons ago, really.   We played all day with the kids. Matt took his bat, ball and glove and he and daddy had a blast playing ball for spurts during the day. We did the walking trail and then stopped to ride on the swings. Of course, Daddy pushed everyone, including Mommy who he enjoyed pushing REAL HIGH just to get me to fuss and for the kids to laugh.  Then he played his game... this silly game he has played with them since they were babies where he pushes them, then he walks around in front of them, just close enough so their feet tap him and he feigns to be knocked over or shoved...so dramatic...anyway, he'll stop and ask them,  'hey, did you do that?'  and they just cackle in laughter.  The longer the game goes on the more dramatic he gets, flipping himself onto the ground, making them laugh until their tummies hurt...just a good time.    Why is it whenever I read a series of books together they all seem to focus on a general point...or rather make me focus on a general point of my own character defects?  In the Samuel Butler's  The Way of All Flesh  the narrator tells of the character's issues with his father, the yelling and reprimanding without love... I still haven't picked up Dyer since Thursday? Friday?   For the good of the cause, here's my gratitude list for the weekend:   1. For finding simple pleasures in a free picnic in the park.  2. For having a wonderful husband and father for my children.  3. For four kids who love their parents.  4. For expecting my grandmother to make me crazy in five minutes with a phone call then not letting her suceed.  5. For Marc's realistic realization that he wont always be a law librarian and is willing to try out the public sector.  6. For his willingness to fill out and send that application to AFL in CA yesterday.  7. For not needing to yell and trying hard not to swear (only three times today, that's good for me!)  8. For sunny days and blue skies with white clouds passing by.  9. For a big hat and sunblock. :) 10. For having only three pieces of meat in the freezer and a half a gallon of milk to last us this week, knowing that somehow, somewhere, my higher power will take care of us this week.

      when Marc would decide that it would be an okay thing for him to switch gears in his career.  I never expected, when I found that job posting, that he'd actually let me send a resume for it.  Sure it was one of the best paying jobs there, sure it was in a posh area on the west coast. That, above all else, said to me that he would in no way go there.  Then I took the plunge and began to fill out the online application until I got to the list of seven questions that I could not answer even off the cuff with as much as I knew about him, there's a point where if he wanted this, he'd have to do it.  So I told him... 91K... sure beats 38K... affluent area, a Canfield the size of Youngstown... He answered the questions, I tweaked them, and certified the application and submitted it.  Now its out of our hands completely.    Marc started looking up the location on the map, checking out the schools, the cost of living increase for us, the amount it would cost to relocate... and when he read the job posting, he realized that I was right all along, it was a perfect job for him.  Now to convince the Human Resources dept likewise.   So tonight, I'm going to let go and let God, await for his transcripts to come in so I can send in the paperwork for the adjunct professorship at a local college sometime this week.    I'm real tired, have a busy day tomorrow. Matt won his baseball game today. They came behind and won 11-10.  I worked in the concession stand and then went to Grayden's birthday party next door with the kids.  They sent home a feeder fish that died within the hour we got home, and Josh was disappointed because it was black like "swimmy" the fish from the book  Swimmy .    Tomorrow is Father's day, I didnt even get him a card as I had no money to do it. I feel bad, but I'll let him sleep in tomorrow and let the kids make him one with crayons while I make him waffles for breakfast.    I'm going to skip the gratitude list tonight just because I'm exhausted, but promise to do one tomorrow. The girls want to do yoga tomorrow and their step aerobics, so I gotta see what time those shows are on so they can have their fun and their dad can see how silly they are when they do it.  Knowing him, he'd probably will start doing it with them.

      Our newcomer went back out... we're sad, we're concerned, and we hope she makes it back. All we can do now is pray and remember that God takes care of fools and drunks.   Tonight, we let go, we let God and we hope she'll be okay.    In search of my own joy, here's my top ten list for the night:   1. For Marcus, who read harry potter to his children even though three years ago he said he'd 'never' read it to them.   2. For my children who tried really hard to have a good day with mom, and even did yoga with her, making downward dog and crescent poses look easy.    3. For Thomas Cuppycake Fly Slayer...and his antics while trying to catch a fly that Josh thought was a bee.   4. For the young man who stopped me and told me I had a flat, and later saw me walking with the kids, just to check to make sure we were all right and the tire had been fixed.   5. For Steve and Richard, who helped us when the flat occured and let me use their phone to call marc, then later gave four children and their mother a ride home to their house.   6. For having someone as special as Jane in my life who cares about me and others regardless of whether we can make it or not, and for taking over the manuscript project for me.   7. For understanding why Samuel Butler's novel, "The Way of All Flesh" was published posthumously, because it was autobiographical and he was a child who was abused and a son of a vicar. That I have more chutzpah and will publish mine, even if it means a divorce from the family.   8. For a good meeting on Powerlessness that reminded me once again that "Mistakes are the opportunities to gain the wisdom to know the difference."   9. Not spending the day worrying, squirrel caging or feeling anxious. Even when the tire went flat, i was calm and able to think clearly.   10. For taking a few minutes to watch two little girls doing step aerobics and coordinating their efforts on a singular aerobic step so that they didnt bump into each other. I needed a laugh like that today.

      I had to stop the other day after J. said to me, 'do you want them to grow up to be an alcoholic like you?' She chastized me for not praising them, for losing my cool, for arguing with a whining six year old who obviously was not going to get her way but she was going to work me down to see if that was possible.   I knew she was right, but I never thought about it that way.  I always said that I was born an alcoholic.  I don't believe that there was any way I could have prevented becoming an alcoholic, and it wasn't as if I wasn't educated in that vein, but it wasn't a matter of education, its a matter of confidence, of self worth and approval, not necessarily something I had much of back then, if any at all.    The only thing I was confident about was how I was going to get what I wanted from men, how I was going to get my booze and paid for at that, and how I was going to get what I wanted.    So will by my changing my ways from deranged writer and exhausted mother to Donna Reed keep my children from becoming alcoholics? If I keep my house clean and iron everything, if I do all the laundry all the time and make sure the sinks shine, will they become alcoholics? Well, it certainly didnt work for my grandmother.  ANd having a house that was unkept didnt work for my mother...  Maybe its not about the condition of the house, but that of the inhabitants?    My house is fairly clean. Well, the carpets need cleaned as usual, and Josh drew on my door with purple crayon last night, purple daisies so that the door looked like Boo's Door from Monster's Inc.  Well, at least he didnt color them in, they're just line drawings... gotta get a magic eraser to take care of that. But I didnt get mad at him for drawing on the door. I probably should have, but I look at it this way:    A year ago, I couldnt get him to hold a crayon. He could barely write his name, now he's drawing and vertically drawing at that.  Sorry, I'm not going to get mad over that. Would I have felt the same last week? That's doubtful. I stopped and thought about it. Would it satisfy me to blow my top at my clean white door now covered in purple daisies?  Would it encourage him to continue in his efforts to draw and write? I know the answer to that one, and its no, not Josh.  Lately, he's been writing and drawing on everything.  Hope just grew out of that phase about three months ago, and she's 4 1/2.  Josh is finally getting there, I guess, and well, who am I to squelch improvement or maturation?    Today, this morning, I got a flat tire. About eight blocks from my house. At least it wasn't eight miles.  I didnt get upset. I quietly asked the children to remain in the car while I tried to evaluate the situation and they did so. When a neighbor offered to help me, I let the children out of the van and told them to stay there in the front yard and dont go into the street. Even Joshua listened.  He walked near the sidewalk, grabbed my hand and said to me, "Mom, you keep me safe, Mom?"  "Sure, Joshy," I said and hugged him and held his hand.  Marc was called, the neighbor drove us home and in two hours Marc had my tire fixed.    After Josh went with his TSS this afternoon, the three of us walked down to get the van.  Matt and I walked, the girls rode in the  boogie-wagon  which is a bike trailer with a stroller bar across the back of it. We rode home, and I didnt have to fight with anyone to help me put the boogie wagon away, get the carseats hooked back into the van, they were eager to help and wait on me.   I read a little Dyer this afternoon, little being the optinum word.  I found something that I was proud of myself for already doing.  Dyer writes:    "The important self-confidence builder here is in talking to your children as if they were already achieving their potential, and conveying to them that you believe in them, as opposed to being a parent who points out flaws and constantly reminds children that they are limited in their abilities" (48).    When it comes to school and sports, I do this. A lot with Matthew.  Here's the difference between his dad and me going to one of Matt's basketball games.  I had to give it to Marc for being critical of Matt when Matt came home after scoring only one shot the whole game last January.  I went with Matt to his next game, all week long talking to him about it, sending him downstairs when he bemoaned "I'm bored" to go dribble or set up shots into his shorter hoop.   He scored half of the points for the team and they won.  This continued through the rest of the season because I'm his cheerleader.  Daddy has made great improvements in this area with baseball this summer.  Matt is a consistent batter, hits every one pitched to him, where those others who are older than him, they whiff it all the time, maybe getting a few in. Once he realized that he had a good eye, that he was a great player (he was no slouch in T-ball last year either and hit out into the outfield whenever possible)and that was reinforced, he believed it.   I remember two of my favorite mother role models, Susan and Moon, giving me probably the most valuable parenting advice before the birth of Matthew.  "Every night you tell that child that he's brilliant and that you love him." I tell all four of them this, and even after Joshua's diagnosis, I told him this and what's more, I'd get up in the middle of the night and tell him this, hoping subliminally it would have an effect on him.   As a writer, I know the importance of constructive criticism.  As a child criticized for everything, I could never live up to the expectations that my mother, grandmother or anyone else had for me.  In my ears, I would never be good enough in their eyes.  When I criticize, I stroke before I criticize, and would you believe, I do this with critiques as well, and book reviews. I've had editors chastise me for not "ripping apart an author for a disasterous piece of work" but I dont believe that's my place to do that.  Regardless of whether or not I thought it was a mess, someone put a lot of effort into it, and somewhere, somehow it struck some publishers' nerve to publish it.  WHat good does a bad review do but keep those who might need to read it from reading it? But I'm not always this way with my children.    But not all of my words are sweet. Some are harsh and irritating. On Wednesday, Joy was horribly whiny.  Non stop whining. I was stressed, tired of waiting to hear the board's decision, finding it harder to keep my cool when dealing with her.  Finally, I said to her, "Joy, you are not being a joy today. I think you need to go upstairs for a time out." I was talking to Brandon at the time, and I could hear an admonishment coming from him for this. But he knew I was stressed and didnt jump on me for it. I told Joy to go to her room, take a time out and let me be. See, this is the thing. I need a time out, I send them to their rooms, so I can explode in what Dave Pelzer in  Healing Yourself  describes as a  controlled eruption,  only for them to throw themselves down and refuse to go, so I leave the room, hoping in a minute I could gain some composure, but then they  FOLLOW ME!  Mom, what are you doing out here? Mom, why can't I do ... why wont you let me ... Non stop. THey know very well how to overload me.   Like, when I'm stressed, and I'm late at getting something done, and I send them with  EXPLICIT  instructions on where to find somehting and they come back with empty hands, saying that they can't find it.  My mother used to go off on me for that. Most of the time, my bifocal glasses were so dirty, it was a miracle i saw where I was going let alone anything else in front of me. Besides, I knew her reaction when I didnt find it. SHe'd get mad, storm off and find it herself, probably whack me for it.  I did that a couple times...and hated myself for it later, wondering, why can't I shut that out or stop it before it happens? They are children!!!   I guess in that instance I learned that prioritizing what's really important, a clean house or dinner finished on time.  Kids dressed or kids content? Instead of all four, I ended up with none in the above instance.    The rest of his chapter is pretty rough. The next section," How We Indvertently Lower Self-Confidence and Self-Worth in our Children,"  will not be an easy read. It never is. I guess I should warn you ahead of time, this isn't my first trip through this book, this is probably the fifth since 1993 when I had to read this book for a class. This is just the first time I am journalling about what I'm reading, forcing myself into processing it.    My girls are playing house behind me, in the other part of the dining room. I remember my mother's snickering and taunting about playing that with my brother or friends. I just say nothing and smile, enjoying their banter and listening to see just how they model me, afraid to hear what I don't want to...or is it what I need to?

      Roy asked me that...and that's one question I've avoided like the plague until this last bit of insanity grounded me to a HOW Halt, when I had to ask myself, Am I really being Honest, Open and Willing to be honest with myself for the sake of myself? Who am I fooling?  Why do I feel as though I have to fool myself into believing I have it all together, when honestly, I just don't?    Whenever I take the focus off of me, whenever I go chasing after someone who I deem  needs my help, guidance, assistance or love--a rescue case  I suffer.  Why do I do that? It's simple. It's eaiser for me to work on a pet project and be the CEO of someone else's life than my own.  Then they disappoint me, they get me caught up in their drama...er, rather I get caught up in  THEIR  drama, cause some chaos with a hint of cynicism, and I'm a mess all over again.  That is the virtuous victim...  I try really hard not to get caught up being the 'front desk clerk' the one whose eye is on the door to AA lobby. On one side, there's a door that swings in and in the middle there's a door that revolves, and on the other side is a door that goes out.  While I care about newcomers a lot, while I pray for them, and listen when they call, when they head for the doors to exit the lobby, I'm afraid to see if they are going out the revolving door or the out door.  At least if they go through the revolving door, they might be back.  But then again, if they go through the out door, they might be back after they have truly hit their bottom and finally realized that they were sick and tired of being sick and tired.  THe only problem with the revolving door is that those who use it aren't ones who take the program seriously.  In and out, around and around, a few months out there, a few days in here, until on a recurring trip they walk through the in door and the out door.    One newcomer I've been very concerned about and have prayed for a lot, but we believe she must have another drunk left in her. She's now avoiding us, those who care about her and want to see her succeed, who could love her until she could love herself, just as I was loved by a team of women sponsors before I could learn to love myself.    So while I'm concerned about her, to a degree I have to detach from her, from her need to sit on the railroad track once again, hoping she will successfully jump off of it in time and not let it or the alcohol destroy her beyond repair.    Just talking to other women in the program yesterday, helped me so much, just to open up and say things are nuts, I feel powerless and need to let go of this. Of all of this...For myself, I did that yesterday.     What can I do from falling into the trap of the V.V. once again?     1. Keep the focus on me.  2. Practice a selfish program and utilize detachment whenever necessary as a protection mechanism.  3. Ask my higher power for help in doing so, realizing that while I am a V.V., there's always room for improvement.  In Grateful Thoughts, Moses Yoder wrote that "The largest room in the house, is the room for improvement."     J. says I need to write a gratitude list daily. I haven't done that for a good long time. So here it goes:    1. For my husband who has given me the best years of my life and whom loves and appreciates me.  2. For my beautiful children who are my most precious possessions.  3. For my two cats who are four legged empaths who know when I need some stroking and loved with a cat in my lap.  4. A good home.  5. For getting in the top 25 of the lit. competition.  6. For being on the last draft of Unspoken Vows (Book One).  7. For finishing the current draft of Everlasting Heartbeat (Book Three).  8. For my AA/Alanon friends, Roy & Brandon & Tiffany who are always ready to listen.  9. For my sober life.  10. For the angels my higher power has put in my way over the last fifteen years to force me to realize that I am worthy of the good life of sobriety and serenity.   "Gratitude must be our Attitude."

      For the first time in months, I began to watch the words I said to the children. Sometimes, I'm in a daze, a haze--mind you, and its not from drinking (because I don't), but I'm like in a separate world, fighting with this muse of mine who deserves to be bound and gagged on occasions...  she has a real FINE attitude, always nagging me to write this or do that her way...gee, I don't know who that sounds like...  and if I want to write and people are in my way, appointments need to be met, kids picked up or dropped off, I just fly off in utter stagnated disgust.  I have a mouth that could make a sailor blush on a rainy day, and too many times it has gotten the best of me.   I said something that reminded me of how my mother talked to me last week...I think that's what awoke me to the realization that I had to learn to shut up and think before I let loose. It's not as if I haven't been under any other kinds of stresses either, right? So I knew what I needed to do. I've done it before, and it works every time I get this way, I get out Dr. Wayne Dyer's "What Do You Really Want for Your Children?" and read it bit by bit, digesting it, forcing myself to think and consider in his nagging prose NOT TO BE SO DAMN NEGATIVE AND PESSIMISTIC!  They are but CHILDREN, they are not the little adults your parents treated you as, or how they treat them as now.  Let them be kids, expect them to do kid things and encourage and praise them for good effort.   Tonight was the first time in a long time that I let the kids help me make dinner. Actually let them participate. I always loved to cook and bake with my children, but lately, with all the stress, I rush through dinner's preparation, not caring what condition it came out in, just as long as it was on the table. Joy did the corn and took the cans out to the recycling, Matthew spun the salad then he and Hope ripped the romaine lettuce into the bowl.  Joy washed and set the table.    I didnt get mad when Josh wouldnt eat the keilbasi he requested. I just went out to the kitchen and nuked him a hotdog and then sat down and ate my dinner.  I just wasn't going to argue with him tonight.   THe kids did their bookwork today, so pleased that I sat down with my book and read while they were busy doing their worksheets of phonics, math and coloring.  I was pleased too.    Dyer wrote that   "Learning how to enjoy life is an attitude. ... you must be able to model what you are attempting to teach" (Dyer 31).     Lately, I've been doing anything but enjoying life. I'm not sleeping at night, I'm anxious during the day, I just want this whole mess over with so we can move on if we need to, stay if we have to, but either way, we just need to know.  Bit by bit, I'm letting go of this situation. Last night, Matthew was still up when I got home. I know why, he was worried about me. See, he's my caretaker child...the child closest to me and in so many ways emotionally a carbon copy of me. He wants to love and care for everyone.  I just have to teach him how to armor-plate his heart to keep it from getting trampled on.    I went upstairs to him, and I leaned over him and kissed him and said, "Matty, I dont want you to worry about anything. Mommy's doing enough worrying for all of us, you dont have to, okay?" He smiled, hugged me and said 'Okay,' and was better today.  Regardless of how much we want to believe that they are oblivious to what's happening, they aren't. They hear us talk, they are around when we try to close ourselves off from them.   Josh read three stories to me today. I can't get over how well he reads and comprehends what he reads now. It was so bad last year, and what a difference 10 hours a week wraparound work did for him during the school year. Now 20 hours a week, I'm still trying to adjust to him being gone for four hours a day. I think he is too for a change, and that if he had it his way, he'd be home in front of his TV.  It's definitely given me more time with the others, which I can tell they appreciate.  I've taken on immense guilt since Joshua's diagnosis of AS in '01 that I spend so much time with Josh and not enough with them.  I was Josh's OT and speech therapist, his bsc and his mother.  How could I not?   Dyer's whole premise on WHAT YOU KNOW vs. HOW YOU FEEL...hit me like a brick to the forehead.  I push these children to read, to know their alphabet and their numbers, to add and subtract... So worried that they will not be prepared enough to face their peers, then they are all above their peers and worried about Mommy's approval if they dont bring home all fantastic marks. But what I dont seem so concerned about is "HOW THEY FEEL," and I had to really have a sit down with myself over this one.   What was the one thing that I know would have made life in school easier? If I FELT as though I had support or encouragement from home. It wasn't as if I was smart enough, I had a 12th grade reading level by the eighth grade, it was that no one told me I could succeed, that I could do something other than what they had planned for me in the box that they lined with government checks and minimum wage jobs.  I was berated as a kid, dealt with an overbearing chaotic mother and grandmother who criticized me rather than praised me for anything.    I realized in college that I couldnt record over those tapes in my head that called me a failure, a loser, that I was fat and ugly to their standards, that college was a waste of time and money for me, and that I would never make it as a writer--no, I had to throw out the tapes and trash the cassette player. I replaced it with a CD player that wasn't completely positive, but at least it was my voice I heard.    At that point, I had the choice to record the stuff from those tapes onto those CD's or positive absolutes and encouragements.  At first, the CD's were filled with scripture, and scripture that judged me and damned me the same way it did as a child of a pentecostal whom never felt as if I was good enough. Who discounted my disability as a figment of my mother's imagination, but felt it necessary to take me to faith healers and force me farther into that whole unworthy abandoned self that hid in the closet.     Then I tossed those CD's and began recording secular on it, but even then, those words were not completely optimistic. No, they were just the words of my anger and contention, my frustration and longing to be in control when financially I was powerless at the moment of diagnosis.  There was no way I could go back to work back then. I was destined to remain home until the baby was in kindergarten.  Eventually, after my first literary nod and print publishing, I began to realize that I was going to make it, that I was a talented writer. Now it's all a matter of effort and timing.   In closing, I want all of my children to find success and become these no-limit people that Dyer talks of:   "You want them to feel successful rather than having some external factor determine their degree of success" (29).   We may not have much. We do not own our own home, our vehicles are 12 years old at the least, and we're on the higher end of poverty level for a family our size.  But when it comes down to all that I have done in the last 15 years for myself, what I've done to better myself, force myself to look honestly at my lifeand to change the things that I can, to graduate from college, to marry a good man, to bear children and be a good mother, to be a wanted speaker or asked to write an article as a contributor, to get two literary nods on one novel... I may not have the monetary items that say success, but in my heart, I'm successful.   Now it's time to live a life successful in sobriety instead of that virtuous victim... and teach my children how to do likewise.

      For the last two months, my husband and I's marriage has been strengthened through adversity.  Most marriages fall to bits when things don't go right, but for us, it's been different.  We both share the blame of this blunder that could affect his livelihood and our relationship.    I don't want to go into detail and give the person who chose to be the vindictive drama queen she is any more drama or power than she thinks she already has. The truth is, she doesn't, even though she thinks she does. The only power she has is when she affects our thoughts, when she forces our brains to rush around in circles like squirrels in a cage, or what we affectionately call 'squirrel caging.'  Otherwise, she is deemed powerless, and what she has done has deemed us likewise powerless.    When I got home from my meeting last night, Marc was still in a bad way.  Dealing with what he had endured that day, I'm sure anyone would have been as bad off as he is, and I doubt if many wives would have reacted the way I did when the going went rough and things looked REAL bad.    I picked up the CTC ( Courage to Change ) and read aloud to him the pages on powerlessness.  I think he was shocked that I wouldnt let him continue in his vein of pity, anger, fear, worry and depression.  We talked about each page and as we talked, he kept going back into that gear of replaying a board meeting, every response, every question, and I'd stop him and read some more.  I wasn't shutting him out. I had heard it all four times over, but he needed to hear something different.  So this is what I told him:   1. I loved him no matter what.  2. We were going to get through this--together. 3. He was powerless over the situation now.  4. He had to let go and let God take over and leave it in God's hands.   We were on the last page of the powerlessness pages (p. 285)... after an enlightening quote from Kierkegaard, "Life can only be understood backwards, but it must be lived forwards," Marc realized that he had to go on, regardless of what the board's decision is, life must go on for him, he cannot dwell on this mistake, this error, this blunder or lapse in judgment.   Then...I looked across the book to page 284, October 10th, and under the  Today's Reminder  was this: "Mistakes can be opportunities to gain the wisdom to know the difference."   I read this to Marc and we both shared a smile.  We'd learn from this mistake if anything, and would be VERY CAREFUL to never end up where we are again.   The lesson that we've learned and the strength that we've gained are what I'm taking from all of this adversity.  The Courage to change the things I can...  I could have taken a lot worse from this situation. I could harbor a resentment towards this person.  I could call Children's Services, Animal Control, the Police, I could have made a LOT of trouble for her.   But I chose not to.  Why? What would it have proved? That I was just as vindictive and evil as she was? That once again, I'd hand the drama queen a little more drama, a lot more chaos, and feed into her desire for it all the more?  By doing nothing, I've diffused her. Even if Marc ends up losing his job over this, and we have to move on, doing or saying anything to her will only give her more encouragement to keep on with her game.    Just what was her game, what was she trying to do? Let's see, I know her primary goal was to ruin our marriage.  When she didnt do that, she chose to ruin his career, hoping it would be the breaking point for us.  In short, RENEE (I have no problem naming the PROBLEM) wanted us to be as miserable as she is with her whatever he is to her.    Do I hate her? I've been praying, God and my angels know I've been praying to release this inner anger I have for her and to channel it into remorse and pity, for that's all she deserves.  She is miserable. If I harbored that anger, I'd be just as miserable today, and that's something I refuse to be--Miserable. If I took a drink and got drunk today, I would be making her day, and ruining mine in the process.  No, today Marc needs my strength, my optimism, and my program until he gets one of his own. Hopefully through this, he will come to realize that 'no problem is too great to be lessened.'   Some who I've shared this with asked me why I chose to stay with him, one accused me of 'codependency' and I had to laugh at her. Hell yeah, I'm a codependent. I learned from the best! My response to these was simply, "I can't see myself without him, he's my best friend, who has seen me through the worst times and has given me the best years of my life. Why should I leave him for probably someone far worse?  On my way to the meeting, I heard on Deliliah's show, an old J.T. song that for some crazy reason has stuck with us or maybe we've stuck to for the last thirteen years.  I sat there with him, and reminded him of a song that somehow when things were messed up and we were either upset at each other or didnt have two cents to rub together, so I leaned over and sang to him, making him smile:   "Even though, we aint got money,  I'm so in love with you honey,  everything will bring a change and  whoa oh oh oh  In the morning when I rise  You bring a tear of joy to my eye  and tell me everything's gonna be all right."

      Today was rough...I helped Brandon sort through the remainder of his library, books that were given to him by Eli, who was his mentor and had passed on and had left Brandon his library. With Brandon so transient now, he couldnt keep all the books. Knowing my love of art and literature, he had me come over and pick out which books I wanted.I brought home three boxes. We got here and I made the potato salad for dinner, we ate the chicken that Brandon had bought, and I baked the peach pie.  It was a long evening, Jess was over and brought her jewelery and Brandon decided that he wanted her to make him a couple pieces so they talked and discussed styles and stones. I saw that David was home next door so I went to see if he was taking care of the dogs or if I was getting stuck doing that tomorrow. As luck woudl have it, I am, in the midst of everything else that I have to do, I am also taking care of the dogs. I only have to make potato salad, get kids dressed and to a picnic at one, then turn around get them to VBS by 5.30. I go see David and he tells me that BJ believes that I called CYS on her. I did no such thing. I wouldnt do that to anyone. Not after what I endured, I certainly wouldnt do that to another mom unless the kid was bleeding and starving. Her kids aren't that.  Her kids are clean, they're fed, their clothes are washed. I wish she'd keep a closer eye on them, so I could get something done instead of hving kids in my house all the time. She tells David that she's buying a lock for the gate and our kids won't be able to play together. That will crush my kids. I can't do much more than say, "I didn't do it." I went out of my way and took care of the kids last week, took care of the dogs on one of the busiest weekends of this month, but I didnt call CYS on her. I wouldnt do that.  Who called her and told her that CYS was called in the first place? Hmmm....crazy carrie????? Gee... I think I'd be more concerned about that psycho than me... when she called me asking me if i called or if somoene called, i told her the truth. I didnt call, no one said they were going to call...at least they didnt say it to me. I can only be held accountable for myself, no one else. Going to quit squirrel caging about this now.

      Last night, I led for the first time in I think 8 years?&nbsp; I know its been a long time, since Philly, that I did it.&nbsp; I am not fond of leading, and have avoided it since I moved back to Ohio, only because I dont always trust that tradition of what you see here, when you leave here, let it stay here... and my people have moles everywhere.&nbsp; At least, when I hid out in Alanon, no one really knew me there, and I went to discussion meetings so no one really asked to hear my 'story.'  Too much blatant honesty for me... too much getting real. I rather listen than speak in AA, I do enough speaking. But I got asked to lead at two other places in September and I'm leading again in August. I know I have a great story when it comes to what the program has done for me. I know that...its just...most of mine is such an Alanon lead, to try to dicipher my AA lead from my Alanon lead doesn't work coming from an Alcoholic family.   &nbsp;  &nbsp;

      Boston was wonderful...I didnt want to come home...well, I missed my kids and wanted them to be with me, but I was not in the mood to return home.&nbsp; Everything went all kerflooey when I walked into Logan Airport to return home that day...&nbsp;   Marc, early as usual, had me out of the hotel by eight that morning with one cup of coffee in my system.&nbsp; I had packed our bags like none other because of ALL THE STUFF he brought home with him from convention, and they were heavy and stuffed to the brink.&nbsp; We're talking zipper splitting packed.&nbsp; I pity those who had to inspect baggage that day!   Anyway, we take the T to the airport.&nbsp; Couldn't beat it a buck twenty five a piece to go to the airport rather than thirty bucks in a cab.&nbsp; Well, I think its a universal thing... no such thing as a cabbie in a city that either A. speaks your language or B. Knows where he is going. I couldnt believe the ONE TAXI i took there, I had to tell him where the BOSTON COMMON was... nuts, purely nuts.   Marc says, 'our return flight is at 11.30.' Okay, so we fly through the inspections, and done by nine thirty, to see on the ticket that it leaves at ten. I'm like, goodie, lets get home faster!&nbsp; We get to the terminal after we check our bags and find out it has a '2 hour' delay.&nbsp; That, it would be there by 11.30.&nbsp; I go edit Crossings some more, reread what I did work on while away and decided that I really fucked that draft up, so I was crossing stuff that I had written out, telling my creative muse to shush, and letting the critical muse tell her off for a few minutes. I wish the two of them would MAKE UP THEIR MINDS about this manuscript.&nbsp; That would be asking too much, I'm afraid.   We get on the plane...wait for 45 minutes to take off, call Mom Katie when we arrive in Pittsburgh, telling her we just got in, and then we wait on our luggage. And we wait, and we wait...finally going to baggage claim office where they tell us they have no idea where any of our four bags are! At that moment, I'm really concerned. I checked all of the kids' souveniors, all of the girls' from marc's library's goodies beneath, and they have no record of our bags? Not anywhere????   THank goodness I had the claim checks!&nbsp; THey put them in the computer so it had the heads up when they put them in and put them on in Boston to fly there sometime that night.&nbsp; He said, "I should have them to you by tomorrow, someone will deliver them to your house."&nbsp; We leave, an hour and half late, drive home, get home to find my house trashed...and Thomas Cuppycake missing. Oh boy...I didnt need either of those.&nbsp; I go out in the neighborhood armed with pictures of the wayward kitty and all of my neighbors tell me they had seen him out as of last night. One said he even fed teh cat.&nbsp; Jess said that Ms Kitty wouldnt come in last night, she hung out in the yard with another cat, didnt realize it was Thomas until after the naughty boy came home. SHe said, "if your mother in law had told us your cat was missing, I would have brought him home."&nbsp;   Around 8 that night, the airport called, and had found my luggage and before I could get off the phone, Marc had Thomas Cuppycake in his hand.&nbsp; I was so relieved.&nbsp; My hp had taken care of everything.   &nbsp;

      Last night I went to a picnic with other AA'ers.  We had a great dinner and then drove to a nearby college town for their fireworks display.  All week, I had been priming my autistic son for this, and even included his wraparound aide in it.  She read him books about fireworks, made a gameplan between us that if its too loud, he could pull his special hat down over his ears and hold his ears and not scream.  This was the first fireworks display that didnt result in a screamfest.    He watched it, he enjoyed it and then he said to me, "Mom, this is the best day of my life." Okay, I cried. How could I not?  The same way I as a sober person ought to enjoy watching fireworks without inebriation, so should this child with his sensory issues be able to enjoy something as beautiful as that.  I know that without this program I'd never be the parent I am to him and he wouldnt be where he is now without me.    This year he joins his twin in mainstreamed first grade.  I used to loathe the 4th when I was first sober. When I was drunk, family fights used to start at 4th picnics, just like they do at Christmas dinners, etc.  Now I can sit back and watch the rest act like fools and know that I have the better life.  For that I am most grateful. So today I truly celebrate Independence day, not only for our country but also for me, an independence from the bonds of alcoholism that used to restrain me from seeking out serenity and finding peace.
