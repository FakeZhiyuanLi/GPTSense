      You learn something new each day.&nbsp; Even at 41.  I can NOT believe what some young buck....said this eve......okay let me refer to him as "dinner and drinky poos".......out of the clear blue sky......Mr. Dinner and Dinky Poo's came up and said -- "You'd be in LOVE and I'd Be Asleep!" ----- I could not wait for Paul to come into work.&nbsp;I needed to ask a "male" question and Paul is the only one I can trust for a true -- "that's the way it is --- cultured answer".  Before I could ask Paul my question......"My dinner and drinky poos" comes over ----and I make a suttle comment to him about what he said --- and he tells Paul the situation.  I asked Paul 'what did that mean' and he was honest enough to tell me......... "While Mr. Dinner and Drinky Poo's "FUCKING YOU" --- You will fall in love with him --- and while you're FUCKING HIM BACK ---- He will fall asleep".  Ohhhhhhhhhhh Myyyyyyyyyy Gooooddddddddddddddd --- how old am I getting to be -- I have never heard this before in my life ---   My first mental comment was...."Well ask Mr. Harley Ride" -- he begs to differ.......!"  My second mental comment was...."Well It's Obvious You Are NOT Talking About Yourself -- Mr. Dinner and Drinky Poo --- because "Who Does Not Go Home Alone EACH and EVERY By His Lonesome Self!!!!!!!!!!!"&nbsp; (Trust me -- a woman would be following Mr. Green Jeans around the ole farm like a new puppy"  My last evil mental comment was....."Yeah RIGHT -- THE POWER OF COBB WEBBs --- People like YOU is the reason why I keep them.......Asshole".  Well,&nbsp;&nbsp; I feel better now --   I CUNTFRONTED "Mr. Dinner and Drinky Poos" and said..... "That was a really FUCKED-UP Thang to Say"  &nbsp; More to follow.......  &nbsp;

      Well Hello,  I wanted to write in about new happenings in my social life.  I will be offically D-I-V-O-R-S-E-D on August 30th.&nbsp; I have been faithful thus far to this "dead-end; lonely" relationship for over 20 years.  I need to wait.......until the 30th to act on some 'decent proposals' for dinner and drinks.&nbsp; Well one is for 'dinner and drinky poos' the other is for a weekend Harley ride.  Let's see.............if I had to chose one-----------ummmmmmmmmmm I think.....I would/will chose the "Harley Ride".&nbsp; Not sure if the person offering could stand-up to the plate -- but ready and willing to 'give 'em a try'.  I am a bit concerned about my "Cobb Webb" factors.&nbsp; They are quite high these days.&nbsp; "If you know what I am sayin'!!!!"  I am hoping it is like 'dancing' -- I had not danced for over 2 years and we went dancing last Friday eve -- and ohhhhh yessss "Sherry could still get her groove on'.&nbsp; I am hoping that this will be the same scenario for when I try to exterminate my COB WEBBs.  Well --- enough for now -- I feel as if I am SLIPPING off my seat.  &nbsp; Later, Sherry NeeHigh (a.k.a "Currently with Cobb Webbs; hoping to get ride of them")
