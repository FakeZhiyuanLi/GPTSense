      How can I ignore Lances calls and spite him if he doesn't call.  Who knew when I said never to FUCKING call me again,  he would actually follow that request.  Too bad business is tied up with him.  I am being PROFESSIONAL damnit.  It does make it harder.  I think I do cold turkey better.  That way you have a couple of weeks of pain,  but it goes away and you begin to think clearly.  OK - So what is UP with Al Gore.  Although I affiliate with neither the Dems or Repubs. . there is something seriously wrong with the hysterical rantings of a few of them this year.    It's like reason has left the Democratic party (as if they had any at some point).  I wish I would have followed politics more when Clinton was in power.   Although,  points for using "bungling" in a speech.  I think he gets to take a drink.  Preserved lemons rock  THANK GAWD!  It's poker night.  I've got like 1000 calories left to go for the day so I am calorie-budgeting for 2 beers!  whoo whoo or 2 vodka martinis.   We are going to go play at a mexican place,  CHA CHA'S that has an outdoor patio.  It's been too long since I played. . almost 2 weeks.  AND I'm going to Dallas to visit David this weekend.  We call these trips of ours therapy because we will both spend the weekend trying to buck each other up about the sorry state of men in our life.  It's so fucking fag-haggy I should be embarrassed.  I am not however as David and I have stood the test of time.  Going on 18 years as friends.  whoa.

      Am I really so lame as to start a blog.  Seems so.  Do I post a pic?  Will it help.  Do I want people to look at this?  Only if they tell me how much they love my blog and they think I'm brilliant.    Because I am.  I keep IMing with Lance.  Why oh WHY do I do such things?  I am trying to keep it strictly business and only discuss business w/him.  HA.  I'm not even going to try and be in denial.  I sure hope I decide to drive up to Dallas this weekend.  If I'm out of town,  then I can not be around AT ALL should he decide to make fake-plans with me again.  It's almost 5:00!  Too bad I've got training tonight.  I could slip into a heap of lazy-do-nothing-eat-sweets rigor mortis LIKE THAT.  So far my diet is ok to stick to.  I don't think I've lost any weight though.  What a catch-22.  I suppose it's not really a diet then.  On the other hand it's been 1 week and I'm afraid to actually weight myself so who knows.  I best get to printing up my "food diary".  My trainer JON will ask for it tonight.  I do hate to dissapoint.  Is all this vain bs as obnoxious to other people as it is to moi?  I must figure out how to maximize the usefulness of this medium.  I can only hope if I can manage to not actually see Lance in person for a month (which should not be hard.  reminder:  you've only seen him a total of like 8 hrs in the previous month) that I'm more beautiful and look so radiant it will pain him more for me to not want him.  I think I might be channeling Spalding Grey.  I feel his pain for sure.  It's a good thing I don't have a gun.  I'm sure the temptation would have taken over at some point this past month.  Suicide/Homicide it could be either depending on the day.
